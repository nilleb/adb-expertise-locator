It is aligned with \nthe Pacific Approach\u2019s priority of managing risks and building economic resilience to protect the \npopulation from hardships;2 and the Strategy 2030 priority of directing ADB grant resources to the \nmost vulnerable developing member countries.3 The FSM meets all of the access criteria of ADB\u2019s \nCPRO, which include sound macroeconomic management, undertaking key structural reforms, a \npro-poor countercyclical expenditure program, and debt sustainability (Table 1).4   \n \n\nTable 1: Summary Assessment of Compliance with the Access Criteria for the \nCountercyclical Support Facility and the COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option \n\nAccess Criteria \n1. Adverse impact of \nexogenous shock \n\n2. Countercyclical \ndevelopment \nexpenditure \n\n3. Pre-shock record \nof generally sound \nmacroeconomic \nmanagement \n\n4. Structural reforms  \n\n5. Debt sustainability \n\nADB Assessment \nThe FSM economy is projected to contract by 5.4% in FY2020 and by a further 1.8% in \nFY2021.  Total  formal  job  losses  across  sectors  are  estimated  at  1,975  (up  to  70%  are \nwomen) by the end of FY2021. Per capita income is expected to fall by 3.6% from FY2019 \nto  FY2021,  with  the  poverty  rate  rising  from  32.3%  to  36.8%  over  the  same  period. \nThis translates to more than 4,500 people falling below the poverty line, with more severe \nimpacts on female-headed households.  \nThe  government  has  approved  total  countercyclical  expenditures  of  $58.7  million \n($28.6 million in FY2020 and $30.1 million in FY2021). Mainly funded through grants and \nfunds  realignment,  these  development  expenditures  include  (i)  a  health  action  plan \n($29.0 million)  on  COVID-19  preparedness  and  response,  (ii)  an  economic  stimulus \npackage  ($18.4  million)  to  assist  affected  businesses  and  workers,  and  (iii)  social \nprotection programs ($11.3 million) for the poor and vulnerable groups.  \nThe FSM\u2019s GDP grew by an average of 1.9% annually in FY2015\u2013FY2019, largely driven \nby the services sector (trade, financial intermediation, and real estate). Inflation was low, \nat  0.1%,  over  the  same  period.  With  higher  grants  and  revenues  (74.6%  of  GDP  in \nFY2015\u2013FY2019), and restraints on recurrent expenditure (at 59.8% of GDP), annual fiscal \nsurpluses rose to 14.8% of GDP in FY2015\u2013FY2019. The surpluses were used mainly to \nbuild up the FSM Trust Fund and reduce public debt.  \nStrong actions in the form of early travel restrictions and border closures have prevented \na  COVID-19  outbreak.  The  government  is  implementing  a  COVID-19  Response \nFramework  to  develop  quarantine  and  isolation  facilities  across  the  nation,  provide \nmandatory infection control training for all first responders, and increase testing capacity \nand ventilators for each island state in the FSM. All four state hospitals are now equipped \nwith  COVID-19  testing  machines.  Risk  communication  and  community  outreach  are \nongoing to educate the public on COVID-19 awareness, in coordination with development \npartners.  Under  the  2023  action  plan  to  enhance  economic  and  financial  stability,  the \ngovernment is working to improve public financial management, strengthen tax reforms, \nand  contain  expenditures,  including  on  the  public  wage  bill.  Annual  contributions  to  the \nFSM  Trust  Fund  were  increased  through  laws  mandating  mandatory  percentages  from \nfishing license fees and corporate income taxes.  \nThe  FSM\u2019s  public  debt  stock  is  relatively  low  (at  20%  of  GDP  in  FY2019),  but  the  IMF \nclassifies the country to be at high risk of debt distress in view of the fiscal uncertainties \nafter  FY2023,  with  the  expiration  of  the  economic  provisions  of the second  Compact  of \nFree Association with the US.

It is a lower middle-\nincome  island  nation  with  a  small  population  of  104,468  in  2018,  of  whom  about  45%  live  in \nChuuk,  37%  in  Pohnpei,  11%  in  Yap,  and  7%  in  Kosrae.  The  country  is  vulnerable  to  climate \nchange, facing frequent natural hazards and rising sea levels. The public sector dominates the \neconomy,  with  private  economic  activities  focused  mainly  on  subsistence  farming  and  fishing, \nwholesale and retail trade, transportation, and tourism services. Less than 15% of the population \nwas in formal employment in 2010, with significantly more people directly or indirectly  depending \non them: those under the age of 15 (36%), outside the labor force (27%), or in the subsistence \nsector  (16%).5 In  FY2018,  the  government  and  public  enterprises  accounted  for  32%  of  gross \ndomestic product (GDP), followed by households (26%), private enterprises (19%), and financial \ninstitutions (16%).6 The FSM has one of the highest estimated rates of poverty in the Pacific, with \n41% of the population living below the total poverty line and 10% below the food poverty line in \n2014.7 The  United  Nations  Development  Programme\u2019s  Human  Development  Index  ranked  the \nFSM 135th out of 189 economies for 2019.8 \n \nDespite  the  geographic  isolation  of  the  Pacific,  the  risk  of  COVID-19  transmission  to \n4. \nvulnerable  populations  remains  high,  with  confirmed  cases  in  Fiji,  Papua  New  Guinea,  and \nSolomon  Islands. 9 As  a  small  island  developing  state,  the  FSM  faces  distinct  challenges  in \naddressing  the  threat  of  the  pandemic,  such  as  weak  health  infrastructure,  geographically \ndispersed populations, and institutional capacity constraints. While COVID-19 has not yet spread \nto  the  FSM  (no  confirmed  cases),  the  projected  health,  economic,  and  social  impacts  of  the \nCOVID-19 pandemic are already significant. \n \nVulnerability  to  external  shocks.  The  narrow  economic  base,  reliance  on  external \n5. \nrevenue  sources,  and  vulnerability  to  climate  change  and  natural  hazards  make  the  FSM \nsusceptible to external shocks. The economy benefited greatly from the fishing industry, which \nhas  attracted  substantial  increases  in  domestic  revenues  from  fishing  licenses  sold  to  foreign \n\n \n\n5  FSM Office of Statistics, Budget, Overseas Development Assistance and Compact Management. 2012.

However, fiscal policy is dependent \non official development assistance and grants, particularly from the United States (US) via the \namended  Compact  of  Free  Association  Agreement  that  became  effective  in  2004.10 Compact \ngrants  provide  funding  for  education,  health,  private  sector  development,  environment,  public \nsector capacity building, and enhancing reporting and accountability. The annual sector grants \nstarted at $76 million in FY2004 and have been reduced by $0.8 million annually since FY2007. \nThe difference between the total contribution and the annual sector grant levels is deposited into \nthe  Compact  Trust  Fund  (CTF).  Compact  grants,  at  around  20%  of  GDP,  are  projected  to  be \nreplaced by investment returns from the CTF (expected to be around 11% of GDP) beyond 2024, \na  substantial  reduction  in  revenues.    Unless  arrangements  under  the  Compact  are  renewed \nbefore expiry in 2023, the FSM\u2019s fiscal position will experience severe revenue volatility afterward.  \n \nWeak health system and preparedness to deal with a pandemic outbreak. The state \n6. \ngovernments manage and regulate the FSM\u2019s health care system. Each of the four states has a \nmain public hospital, and the country has one private hospital. At the municipal level, including \nthe outlying islands, health care is available only through dispensaries, which function as health \nclinics  for  basic  diagnosis  and  treatment.  The  FSM  lacks  the  health  infrastructure  and \npreparedness to cope with a pandemic outbreak, with less than 20 beds available for the isolation \nof suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients, and isolation rooms only available in one of the \nfour  island  states.  Essential  medical  supplies  and  equipment,  such  as  personal  protective \nequipment  and  ventilators,  have  arrived  in  the  FSM  in  batches;  and  the  training  of  frontline \nworkers has yet to be completed. The capacity to undertake infectious disease surveillance and \ncontact tracing is limited, with inadequate routine reporting of severe acute respiratory illnesses \nand influenza-like illnesses. The FSM has only 38 skilled health workers per 10,000 population, \nshort of the recommended indicator of 59.4 of the World Health Organization (WHO).11 \n \n7. \nThe high incidence of noncommunicable diseases and comorbidities in the FSM increases \nits  population\u2019s  susceptibility  to  COVID-19,  and  to  the  risk  of  a  heightened  mortality  rate.  A \nCOVID-19 outbreak would be even more challenging for people living in communal and informal \nsettlements, which are densely populated and have poor access to basic services such as health \ncare, water, and sanitation facilities. The impact of a localized epidemic in the Pacific was seen \nin  October  2019  during a  measles  outbreak  in  Samoa.  The  FSM  has  had  epidemic  outbreaks \nrelated to dengue and waterborne diseases, which have been expensive for the cash-strapped \nstate  and  national  health  departments.  In  2019,  the  Global  Health  Security  Index,  which \nbenchmarks countries on pandemic preparedness, ranked the FSM 124th of 195 countries.12 \n \nStrong government measures to contain the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic. The \n8. \ngovernment enacted strong and timely containment measures to limit the risk of a local outbreak \nby  introducing  travel  restrictions  and  closing  its  borders,  requiring  14-day  self-quarantine  in  a \nCOVID-19-free  area  before  entry  to  the  FSM,  restricting  residents  from  traveling  abroad  and \nimplementing social distancing standards. A state of public health emergency remains in effect \nsince  31  January  2020.  The  government  has  been  implementing  its  COVID-19  Response \nFramework, with important progress in strengthening health screening and surveillance at points \nof entry in airports and seaports, and in procuring essential medical supplies and equipment. All \nfour  state  hospitals  have  COVID-19  testing  capacity.  While these  measures  are  critical  from  a \n\n \n\n10 The Compact of Free Association between the FSM and the US provides for US economic assistance (including \neligibility for certain US federal programs) and defense of the FSM in exchange for US military and other operating \nrights within the FSM\u2019s territory.

No confirmed cases have been reported.  \n \n9. \nPre\u2013COVID-19  sound  macroeconomic  management.  The  FSM\u2019s  economy  has \ngenerally been performing well in the past 5 years, with GDP growth averaging 1.9% per annum \nin FY2015\u2013FY2019 (Table 2 and Appendix 4). Its fiscal position has recorded budget surpluses \nbecause  of  strong  revenues  from  fishing  license  fees  and  large-scale  offshore  corporate  tax \npayments,  while  expenditures  (in  particular,  public  sector  wages)  were  restrained. 13  With \nrevenues averaging 74.6% of GDP, while expenditure was 59.8% of GDP, the average surplus \nwas 14.8% of GDP in FY2015\u2013FY2019.

The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted \n10. \nFSM\u2019s economy. Extended border closures amid the pandemic are projected to result in economic \ncontractions of 5.4% in FY2020 and 1.8% in FY2021, largely through constraints on trade and \ntravel  flows  affecting  agriculture  and  services. 15 Table  3  summarizes  the  adverse  economic \nconsequences of the pandemic for the FSM through several channels. \n \n\nTable 3: Key Transmission Channels for COVID-19 \n\nIssues \n\nTransmission \nChannel \nAgriculture \n\nFisheries \n\nAgriculture  is  largely  based  on  smallholder  farms  producing  root  crops,  vegetables,  fruit,  and \nlivestock  for  household  consumption  and  local  sale.  Commercial  agriculture  remains  largely \nundeveloped. Although 63% of households engage in agriculture activities, only 24% sell any of \ntheir production. Hence, agriculture\u2019s contribution to GDP remained low at an average of 14% in \nFY2015\u2013FY2019.  Restrictions  on  international  and  local  travel  constricted  demand,  severely \nlimiting opportunities available to small farmers to sell their produce.  \nAlthough fisheries contributed only about 11.5% of GDP in FY2015\u2013FY2018, royalties from fishing \nlicense fees increased significantly from 6.0% of GDP in FY2011 to an average of 19.4% of GDP \nin FY2015\u2013FY2018. Travel and quarantine restrictions have prevented purse seine fishing vessels, \n\n \n\n13  In 2005, the FSM passed corporate tax legislation that enabled the creation of an overseas domicile for companies \nwith  a  corporate  tax  rate  of  21%,  which  makes  the  FSM  an  attractive  domicile  (primarily  for  Japanese  captive \ninsurance companies and other corporations).  \n\n14  Under  a  series  of  legislation  (Public  Law  18-107  and  Public  Law  20-134),  the  government  has  specified  annual \ncommitments  to  the  fund.  Under  Public  Law  20-134,  it  allocated  50%  of  corporate  tax earnings  from  the captive \ninsurance and large corporation segment to the FSM Trust Fund (about $6 million in normal years). It also allocated \n20%  of  fishing  fee  revenue  to  the  fund  (about  $12  million).  In  total,  the  government  has  legislated  to  contribute \n$24 million annually to the FSM Trust Fund on a conservative basis.  \n\n15 ADB. 2020.

Transshipment output is \nexpected to fall by more than a third from FY2020 to FY2021. Container vessel visits have also \nfallen, especially to the two smaller states of Yap and Kosrae. Fishing license fee revenues are \nexpected to decline from 20.6% of GDP in FY2019 to 18.0% in FY2020 and 16.2% in FY2021. \nTrade and travel restrictions are also affecting small-scale exporters of fish and other agricultural \nproducts, which are transported by air cargo or hand-carried by travelers.   \nTourism-related  industries  contributed  revenues  of  about  $43  million  in  2019  (15.3%  of  total \nrevenues and grants). It is one of the largest formal sector employers outside the public sector, \nemploying 1,048 people directly in FY2019 and more indirectly through ancillary services. More \nthan 60% of employees in accommodation and food service activities are women. The hotel and \nrestaurant  industry,  which  caters  mostly  to  overseas  and  interstate  visitors,  is  projected  to  lose \n669 jobs. It accounted for 6.7% of formal employment in FY2019 and 1.7% of GDP during FY2016\u2013\nFY2018 but is projected to fall by 46% in FY2020 and a further 75% in FY2021.  \nWith  international  passenger  flights  reduced  to  one  flight  per  month  and  only  outbound  traffic \npermitted,  the  cargo  airline  that  picks  up  fresh  fish  from  Pohnpei  and  Kosrae  provides  a  cargo \nservice 3 days a week, which allows continued imports by air of critical medical equipment and \nsupplies. The country also depends on food imports, which creates an added challenge of ensuring \nfood security during the pandemic crisis. Despite some difficulties with transport to the outer islands \nand delays related to quarantine restrictions, no shortages of supplies have been reported. The \ntransport  sector  is  projected  to  decline  by  27%  in  FY2020  and  a  further  14%  in  FY2021.  An \nadditional loss of 609 jobs across transport, shipping, port services, aviation, and airport ground \nhandling is projected, along with 248 extra job losses in wholesale and retail trade. \n\nConstruction  Current travel restrictions and the border closures impact the supply of construction materials and \nconstrain the travel of engineers and personnel, resulting in project delays (as seen in delays in \nthe  construction  of  PetroCorp\u2019s  coconut  processing  project  in  Chuuk).

The continued threat of COVID-19 and the closure of \n11. \nthe  FSM\u2019s  borders  are  severely  affecting  the  economic  activities  and  livelihoods  of  its  already \nsmall and vulnerable population. Total formal job losses across sectors are projected to reach \n1,975  (of  whom  women may  account  for  up to  70%)  by the  end  of  FY2021,  a  12%  drop  from \nFY2019  employment  levels. 16  Unemployment  will  be  more  significant  in  the  private  sector. \nPoverty levels are heightened for people in the informal economy, comprising small businesses \nand individual workers, as businesses shut down and those reliant on the cash-based enterprises \nlose their income. As the FSM also depends on food imports, the loss of employment and reduced \nincomes create the added challenge of ensuring food security. Increasing poverty levels heighten \nthe vulnerability of women, children, the elderly, and persons with disabilities.

Indirect health risks include worsening health outcomes for women \nand girls, as essential services such as maternal and reproductive health have a lower priority \nbecause  of  COVID-19  and  women  may  be  reluctant  to  seek  health  care  because  of  fear  of \nCOVID-19 infection. Women are more vulnerable to economic hardships given their reliance on \nremittances and informal work, particularly in travel and tourism-related industries. In the formal \nsector, 39% of employees were women, who received 36% of gross earnings and earned 13% \nless than men, on average.17 About 20% of total households are female-headed, and they face \nan increased risk of poverty. Before the COVID-19 crisis, 50% of female-headed households were \nbelow the poverty line compared with 39% of male-headed households. Existing prevalence data \nindicate  that  one  in  three  women  in  the  FSM  have  experienced  some  form  of  gender-based \nviolence (GBV) in their lifetime, and this is likely to increase because of COVID-19 measures.18 \n  \nB. \n \n13. \nTo  mitigate  the  adverse  impacts  of  COVID-19,  the  government  has  formulated  a \ncomprehensive countercyclical response program of $58.7 million\u2014$28.6 million for FY2020 and \na $30.1 million for FY2021\u2014comprising three components, as summarized in Table 4. \n \n\nGovernment Countercyclical Development Expenditure Program  \n\nTable 4: Federated States of Micronesia\u2019s Countercyclical Response Program ($) \n\nComponent \nHealth Action Plan \nA.

It  also  includes  a  risk \ncommunication  plan  that  guides  the  mitigation  interventions  in  the  event  of  community \ntransmission. As the pandemic shows no signs of abating, the government is increasing the health \nstimulus by another $9 million as part of the FY2021 budget to include a vulnerable population \nmitigation  plan  to  decentralize  clinical  services  and  establish  remote  consultation  options  for \nvulnerable groups, such as the elderly and those with pre-existing comorbidities. \n \nEconomic Stimulus Package ($18.4 million). In March 2020, the FSM Congress passed \n15. \nPublic Law 21-104 setting up the Tourism Mitigation Fund, appropriating an initial $1 million of \nfinancial assistance for the tourism industry, which is heavily affected by travel restrictions and \nborder closures. As COVID-19 evolved into a global pandemic, with a sustained and deep impact \non the economy, the government formulated the Economic Stimulus Package (ESP). On 22 April \n2020, the government passed Public Law 21-105, which temporarily diverts funding from fishing \naccess fees and revenue derived from major corporations to the country\u2019s ESP, which otherwise \nwould have been diverted to the FSM Trust Fund. The ESP includes: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nFinancial support to an estimated 186 affected tourism businesses that have been \nheavily  hit  by  the  pandemic  through  the  provision  of  wage  subsidies,  interest \npayment  relief  on  business  loans,  and  social  security  and  gross  revenue  tax \nrebates  to  help cushion the  impact  on  economic  activity  and  protect job losses. \nAssistance  will  also  be  expanded  to  other  business  sectors  affected  by  the \npandemic, subject to approval by Congress.  \nA concessional credit line through the FSM Development Bank to provide loans to \nat least 200 micro and small enterprises, with up to 50% of the loan amount to be \nallocated to women-owned businesses. This provides access to affordable credit \nand grants to support the growth of microenterprises and small businesses.  \nTemporary  unemployment  assistance  to  support  an  estimated  100  migrant \nworkers who have lost their jobs because of the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n\n \n16. \nThe program will support the implementation of the FY2021 stimulus response. The ESP \nis complemented by a separate grant of $36 million from the US through a temporary Pandemic \nUnemployment Assistance (PUA) program for both US and FSM citizens in the country who have \nlost their jobs or suffered reduced hours as a direct result of the pandemic.20  \n \nSocial  protection  programs  ($11.3  million).  Recognizing  the  severe  challenges  and \n17. \nvulnerabilities facing the poor, the elderly, persons with disabilities, and survivors of GBV during \nthe crisis, the government developed social protection programs (SPP) comprising:21   \n\n(i) \n\nCash transfer grants to support an estimated total of 4,500 low-income households \noutside  the  PUA  program  (inclusive  of  low-income  female-headed  households). \n\n \n\n20 In March 2020, the Government of the US signed into law the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, \n2020,  creating  the  temporary  PUA  program.  Eligible  individuals  receive  a  minimum  payment  of  $166  per  week \nbackdated from 27 January up to the end of December 2020. The FSM Department of Finance and Administration \nadministers the PUA and the US Department of Labor oversees the PUA program. The PUA, like all grants, flows \nthrough the FSM Government General Fund account. Only off-budget amounts are in-kind grants (medical equipment \nand supplies). \n\n21 Details of the estimated number of target beneficiaries, eligibility criteria, and implementation mechanisms (including \ngrievance mechanisms) of the subcomponents under the ESP and SPP are in the Summary of Economic and Social \nProtection  Measures  of  the  Government\u2019s  COVID-19  Response  Program  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2).  \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nThis will provide temporary cash relief for affected informal workers to help meet \ntheir immediate cash needs in the absence of any income replacement. \nA  food  security  program  for  community  groups  and  low-income  households  to \nenhance  food  production  through  subsistence  livelihood  training  and  the \ndistribution of seeds, planting, and fishing materials at no cost. \nCOVID-19  community-based  small  grants,  working  with  nongovernment \norganizations and civil society organizations to strengthen community awareness \nof  COVID-19;  education  on  handwashing  and  social  distancing;  distribution  of \nsoaps,  masks,  and  information  materials  to  remote  areas;  and  adapting  GBV \nservice provision, including pilot testing a GBV hotline in Pohnpei.  \nFinancial assistance to vulnerable groups (including low-income households, the \nelderly,  persons  with  disabilities,  and  survivors  of  GBV)  through  (a)  temporary \nwaivers  of  medical  expenses  not  included  under  the  Compact  Funds  (i.e.,  in-\npatient,  medicine,  ambulance,  transportation  from  households  to  hospitals,  and \nphysical  therapy);  (b)  electricity  subsidies  to  an  estimated  2,000  low-income \nhouseholds  with  dependents  who  have  disabilities;  (c) the  distribution  of  solar \nlamps to at least 5,000 households on the outer islands, which are not connected \nto the grid; and (d) clinical management of rape and intimate partner violence kits \nand consultation options for survivors of GBV in community health centers. \nOne-off cash payments to an estimated 900 stranded FSM citizens and students \nabroad.  \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nProposed Program, Impact, and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n\n \nC. \n \nThe government has requested CPRO assistance. The proposed program will provide the \n18. \ngovernment  with  fiscal  space  and  timely  support  for  the  implementation  of  its  countercyclical \nCOVID-19 response. It will contribute to the government\u2019s efforts in containing the pandemic and \naddressing its economic and social impacts, particularly on the poor and vulnerable. The effect of \nthe program will be adverse effects of COVID-19 on the FSM\u2019s citizens and businesses reduced. \nThe program will have three outputs: (i) measures to combat the entry and spread of COVID-19 \nin  the  FSM  delivered;  (ii)  measures  to  provide  economic  stimulus  relief  to  businesses \nimplemented;  and  (iii)  measures  to  provide  social  protection  to  poor  and  vulnerable  groups \nenhanced.  The  program  is  also  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030\u2019s  operational  priorities  of \naddressing remaining poverty and reducing inequality, accelerating progress in gender equality, \nand strengthening governance and institutional capacity. The design and monitoring framework \nis in Appendix 1. \n \n19. \nADB\u2019s  value  addition.  The  program  is  part  of  a  comprehensive  package  of  ADB \nassistance that covers the immediate response to COVID-19, short-term financing support for the \ngovernment\u2019s  fiscal  response  to  manage  adverse  socioeconomic  impacts,  and  medium-term \ninterventions to promote recovery and resilience. In the immediate aftermath of the pandemic, the \nFSM drew down $6 million in grants from the Pacific Disaster Resilience Program for contingent \ndisaster financing.22 ADB provided $474,000 in technical assistance (TA) and collaborated with \nUNICEF  in  the  procurement  of  essential  medical  equipment  and  supplies. 23  The  FSM  also \naccessed $470,000 from the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund to meet immediate financing \ngaps, such as overtime renumeration for frontline workers, quarantine and contact tracing costs \nof suspected COVID-19 patients, and other logistics costs. The FSM received a further allocation \nof $1.03 million from the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund, financed by the Government of \n\n \n\n22 ADB. 2017.

ADB\u2019s regular dialogue with the government was key \nin the design of the SPP. In terms of post-COVID-19 recovery efforts, ADB will continue to support \nclimate  and  disaster-resilient  infrastructure;  build  a  social  protection  system  for  the  poor  and \nvulnerable  groups;  reorient  the  design  of  health  and  social  sector  projects  to  strengthen  the \nresilience of the FSM to health emergencies and outbreaks; and replenish the contingent disaster \nfinancing  for  future  disasters  caused  by  natural  hazards  and  health  emergencies. 25 ADB  is \nworking closely with key development partners in the Pacific to encourage policy and legislative \nreforms  that  will  strengthen  the  business  environment,  spur  investment  and  private  sector-led \ngrowth, and support financial inclusion, including for women.  \n \n20. \nLessons  learned.  The  program  applies  lessons  from  ADB\u2019s  experience  in  providing \nbudget support for effective countercyclical aid to its developing member countries in response to \ncrises, as evident in the Economic Recovery Support Programs for Pacific countries during the \n2008  global  financial  crisis. 26 Timeliness  is  critical  in  crisis  response\u2014earlier  responses  are \nusually  more  effective.  Social  protection  programs  are  also  effective  crisis-mitigating  and \nresponse instruments, as they protect the poor and vulnerable who are the first to be affected by \na  crisis.  The  program  leverages  these  lessons  and  ensures  that  ADB  support  is  timely  and \ntargeted at the poor and vulnerable groups. \n \nDevelopment partner coordination. To ensure the pandemic responses are well-aligned \n21. \nand complementary, ADB coordinated with partners during virtual country programming and fact-\nfinding  missions  in  July  and  August  2020. 27  ADB  provided  immediate  support  for  the \nimplementation of the government\u2019s stimulus response for FY2020, under various TA funds (para. \n19). The government also received funds and donations of medical supplies and equipment from \npartners. The US provided (i) an emergency allocation of $7 million from unexpended Compact \nsector grant funds for health sector needs; (ii) a $36 million PUA to compensate for job losses \nunder the US Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (para. 16); and (iii) an allocation \nof  about  $1.3  million  from  the  US Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention\u2019s  emergency \nresponse.  The  World  Bank  provided  $2.5 million  contingency  emergency  response  for  health \nsector preparedness and the procurement of medical supplies. The People\u2019s Republic of China \nand the Government of Japan provided cash donations and in-kind assistance through medical \nmasks, protective clothing for first responders, and medical supplies.  \n \n22. \nADB took the lead in coordinating policy advice from development partners to support the \ngovernment in preparing the ESP and SPP. The WHO, together with UNICEF, Micronesia Red \nCross,  and  local  nongovernment  organizations,  is  supporting  the  FSM  in  implementing  a \ncomprehensive COVID-19 community outreach package that aims to empower communities to \nprotect  themselves from  COVID-19  infection.  This  will  also  be  supported  by  community-based \nsmall grants under the program.  Moreover, ADB and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have \nhad regular bilateral meetings on macroeconomic and fiscal issues through participation during \nArticle IV  missions  (the  latest  was  held  in  June  2019  in  Pohnpei),  and  as  part  of  wider \ndevelopment  partner  discussions  on  supporting  the  government  during  the  crisis.

Because of the adverse economic and fiscal impact of the COVID-19 \npandemic, the government\u2019s financing needs are projected to increase to $16.5 million in FY2020 \nand  a  further  $33.4  million  in  FY2021.  The  government  has  requested  a  grant  not  exceeding \n$14.0 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian Development Fund) to help finance the \nprogram.  The  grant  proceeds  will  support  development  financing  needs. The  government  also \nplans to seek additional grants from development partners. In the absence of further grants, the \ngovernment plans to reprioritize expenditures, mobilize revenues, or rely on domestic resource \nefforts to help narrow the financing gap (Table 5).  \n \n\nTable 5: Federated States of Micronesia\u2014Development Financing Needs, \nFY2020 and FY2021  \n($ million) \n\nMajor Budget Categories \n \nRevenues \nExpenditures \nOverall Fiscal Balance \nTotal Financing Needs \nFSM Trust Fund \nRealignment and transfer from \ndomestic funds \n ADB CDF \nADB CPRO \nWorld Bank \nTo be determined \n\nFY2020 \n\nPre-\nCOVID-19 \n283.2 \n257.2 \n  26.0 \n (26.0) \n (26.0) \n \n\nCOVID-19 \nAdjusted \n252.4 \n268.9 \n  (16.5) \n  16.5 \n \n  5.5 \n\n% of GDP \n74.4 \n79.3 \n  (4.9) \n  4.9 \n \n  1.6 \n\nFY2021 \n\nPre-\nCOVID-19 \n286.1 \n260.5 \n  25.6 \n  (25.6) \n  (25.6) \n \n\nCOVID-19 \nAdjusted \n236.0 \n269.4 \n  (33.4) \n  33.4 \n \n  17.0 \n\n \n \n \n \n\n  6.0 \n \n  2.5 \n  (2.5) \n\n  1.8 \n \n  0.7 \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n  14.0 \n \n  (2.4) \n\n% of \nGDP \n69.7 \n79.6 \n  (9.9) \n  9.9 \n \n  5.0 \n\n \n  4.0 \n \n \n\n( ) = negative, ADB = Asian Development Bank, CDF = contingent disaster financing, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, \nCPRO = COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option, FY = fiscal year, GDP = gross domestic product.  \nNote:  Realignments  under  consideration  by  the  government  include  the  reduction  of  travel  budgets,  contractual \nservices, and other  nonessential spending, as  well as  further  diversion  of  fishing  license  and corporate  income  tax \nrevenues toward the Economic Stimulus Package and the Tourism Mitigation Fund. Any unfunded COVID-19 elements \nwill be financed through savings elsewhere in the budget. \nSources: IMF. 2019. IMF Country Report. No. 19/288. Washington, DC. (pre-COVID-19); and ADB estimates, based \non data provided by the Government of the FSM, Department of Finance and Administration (adjusted for COVID-19). \n \n24. \nDebt sustainability. No new loans are expected within the forecast horizon, as the deficits \nare expected to be financed through external grants and the realignment of domestic resources. \nBefore COVID-19, the IMF\u2019s debt sustainability analysis (DSA) assessed the FSM to be at high \nrisk of external and overall debt distress in 2019. The analysis suggests that DSA thresholds on \nthe present value of external debt will be breached within a 20-year horizon. With the outbreak of \nCOVID-19,  the  FSM  economy  is  now  projected  to  contract  while  fiscal  deficit  is  expected  to \ndeteriorate further, thereby, increasing the public debt\u2013GDP ratio moderately. DSAs by ADB and \nthe IMF (through a June 2020 assessment letter) maintains the high risk of debt distress rating \nbut concludes that the FSM\u2019s public debt remains sustainable. The high risk of debt distress stems \nfrom  a  projected  fall  in  revenues  in  FY2024,  with  greater  revenue  volatility  afterward,  unless \neconomic  provisions  of  the  Compact  Agreement  are  renewed.  Compact  grants  and  fiscal \ntransfers  totaling  20%  of  GDP  will  expire  in  FY2023  and  be  replaced  by  investment  returns \naccruing to the CTF, projected at about 11% of GDP in FY2024. While debt is expected to be \nfinanced by non-debt creating flows (such as grants), the risk of a fiscal cliff after FY2023 remains. \nADB\u2019s assessment corroborates these views. Although economic contraction is expected to be \nmore  severe  than  the  IMF\u2019s  post\u2013COVID-19  assessment  (\u20135.4%  in  FY2020  and  \u20131.8%  in \nFY2021), the revenue shortfall is expected to be covered by grants from development partners \nand  the  realignment  of  domestic  revenues  and  expenditures.  Hence,  the  debt\u2013GDP  ratio  will \nremain  sustainable.  However,  longer  containment  measures  and  a  further  decline  in  domestic \n\n\f11 \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nand  external  demand  could  have  a  potential  adverse  impact  on  macroeconomic  stability  and \ncompromise the debt\u2013GDP trajectory. Nevertheless, the analysis suggests the overall debt\u2013GDP \nratio will remain sustainable in the medium to long run. \n \nE. \n \n25. \nA program steering committee co-chaired by the secretary of finance and administration \nand  the  secretary  of  health,  and  comprising  key  government  officials  from  the  Department  of \nFinance and Administration (DFA) and the implementing agencies, and the finance directors of \neach  state  government\u2014will  oversee  and  monitor  the  budget  execution  and  flow  of  funds  for \ncountercyclical measures through the DFA\u2019s monthly reports. The program steering committee \nwill provide a monthly update to the President of the FSM on the program\u2019s overall progress and \noutcomes. The DFA will be the executing agency for the program and will oversee and coordinate \nthe  program  implementation.  The  implementing  agencies  will  include  (i)  the  DFA,  (ii)  the \nDepartment of Health and Social Affairs, (iii) the Department of Resource and Development, and \n(iv) the FSM Development Bank, to ensure the efficient implementation, monitoring, and reporting \nof the C-HAP, ESP, and SPP. The ESP and SPP will mostly use implementation mechanisms \nalready established for the PUA to reach the target beneficiaries. The implementation of the C-\nHAP will be reported through the National COVID-19 Taskforce. The implementing agencies will \npartner with municipal governments, nongovernment organizations, or civil society organizations \nto provide welfare services to the poor and vulnerable. ADB TA will support the implementation \nof targeted schemes for the poor and vulnerable groups, and monitoring of social outcomes using \nsex-disaggregated  data. 29  The  executing  agency  will  provide  quarterly  reporting  to  ADB  for \nmonitoring  of the  program  outcomes  and  indicators,  as  specified  in  the design  and  monitoring \nframework, summary of economic and social protection measures of the government\u2019s COVID-\n19  response  program  and  gender monitoring  matrix.  The  program  will  be  implemented  from  1 \nDecember 2020 to 30 September 2021. The proceeds of the policy-based grant will be withdrawn, \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \n\n26. \nGovernance. The FSM\u2019s strong recent record of sound fiscal management is exhibited \nby the achievement of annual consolidated fiscal surpluses since FY2012, as well as the steady \nbuildup of fiscal buffers in the FSM Trust Fund, which has more than quadrupled in value since \nFY2015. However, the latest IMF assessments point to lingering weaknesses in public financial \nmanagement  (PFM),  including  inadequate  procurement  procedures  and  deficiencies  in  the \nscreening of capital projects.30 A Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability self-assessment \nwas conducted by the government in 2016 to assess progress made since the FSM\u2019s first formal \nPublic Expenditure and Financial Accountability assessment conducted in coordination with the \nPacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre in 2013. The resulting PFM Roadmap, 2017\u20132020 \nprioritizes (i) implementing a new financial management information system (currently supported \nby  a  World  Bank  project);  (ii)  reviewing  and  updating  the  FSM\u2019s  financial  management \nregulations;  (iii)  improving  reporting  standards,  including  through  a  new  DFA  website;  and \n(iv) sustaining  capacity  development  efforts,  particularly  in  accounting,  auditing,  and  financial \nmanagement. 31  The  President  of  the  FSM  approved  the  updated  financial  management \nregulations  in  February  2019\u2014strengthening  integrity  in  PFM\u2014but  final  thresholds  for \nprocurement,  asset  capitalization,  and  open  bidding  in  the  public  sector  remain  pending  with \n\nManila. \n\n \n\n29 ADB. 2020.

The FSM is a fragile state whose structural constraints translate to thin capacities for \neffective  governance.  Based  on  ADB\u2019s  2018  country  performance  assessment,  the  country\u2019s \nratings  are  particularly  low  (2.0\u20132.5  on a  scale of  1.0\u20136.0,  where  higher  scores  indicate  better \nresults)  for  critical  areas  including  the  business  regulatory  environment,  the  equity  of  public \nresource use, and the quality of public administration.32 Thus, further interventions in the FSM will \nbe  anchored  on  lessons  from  ADB\u2019s  ongoing regional  TA  supporting  effective  and sustainable \ndelivery of development results in fragile situations in the Pacific.33 ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government. \n \n27. \nSocial and poverty impact. The government\u2019s comprehensive and targeted schemes for \npoor households and vulnerable groups will prevent poverty exacerbation. A cumulative increase \nin real per capita incomes of 10.8% during FY2014\u2013FY2019 is estimated to have reduced poverty \nincidence to 32.3% just before the COVID-19 crisis, but the projected 6.9% contraction in incomes \nhas  the  potential  to  push  poverty  back  to  36.8%  of  the  population  by  the  end  of  FY2021. 34 \nUnconditional  cash  relief  targeted  at  low-income  households  and  those  outside  the  formal \neconomy  will  provide  supplementary  income  and  avoid  negative  coping  mechanisms  such  as \nselling assets and incurring debts to support basic needs. These households are likely to have \nmore  children,  be  female-headed,  have  lower  education  attainment  levels,  and  be  without  a \nreliable  source  of  income.  The  risks  of  heightened  vulnerability  of  persons  with  disabilities, \nchildren,  and  the  elderly  from  lack  of  access  to  services  and  adequate  food  supply  will  be \naddressed through additional cash assistance, utility subsidies, and medical waivers. A targeted \napproach will prevent their welfare from being compromised during the COVID-19 pandemic. \n \nGender.  The  program  is  classified  effective  gender  mainstreaming. 35  The  program \n28. \nincludes  proactive  measures  to  reduce  key  negative  impacts  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and \nsupport  women  and  girls\u2019  health  and  economic  empowerment.  Schemes  supporting  women \nemployees  and  women-owned  businesses  include  (i)  support to  tourism-related  businesses  to \nmaintain employees and pay salaries, including 418 female employees (out of 863 employees); \n(ii) support to 14 women-owned tourism businesses (out of 186 total businesses); and (iii) support \nto  women  migrant  workers  in  the  tourism  industry  who  have  become  unemployed  because  of \nCOVID-19.  In  addition,  grants  and  loans  will  be  offered  to  micro  and  small  enterprises,  with  a \ntarget of 100 women-owned enterprises. Several schemes support low-income households and \nfemale-headed  households,  including  (i)  a  one-off  cash transfer scheme  for  4,500  households \nwith additional payments for those with caring responsibilities, such as children and the elderly; \nand (ii) a utility subsidy allowance for at least 2000 households. Actions to prevent and respond \nto GBV include (i) provision for the clinical management of rape and intimate partner violence in \neight health clinics across all states; (ii) medical waivers for survivors of GBV; and (iii) measures \nto  establish  GBV  services  and  referral  pathways.  Women\u2019s  health  is  further  supported  by \nringfencing budget for maternal, child, and reproductive health services; and investing in providing \nquality decentralized services so that women and girls do not need to travel to a hospital and put \nthemselves  at  increased  risk  of  COVID-19  infection.  Finally,  the  community-based  COVID-19 \npreparedness scheme supports  women\u2019s  organizations,  and  all  proposals  will  be  assessed  on \ngender equality criteria.   \n \nSafeguards.

ADB is also preparing a program to improve disaster \nrisk management and provide quick-disbursing funds in the event of a \ndisaster. \n\nThe Economic Stimulus Package and social protection programs use \nexisting  mechanisms,  where  available.  These  mechanisms  are \nassessed  as  adequate,  with  functional  structures,  processes,  and \nstaffing. The government will employ temporary staff to assist during \nimplementation.

Adverse impact of \nexogenous shock \n\nASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH ACCESS CRITERIA FOR THE COUNTERCYCLICAL SUPPORT FACILITY AND COVID-19 \nPANDEMIC RESPONSE OPTION ACCESS CRITERIA \n\nADB Assessment \n\nThe FSM economy is projected to contract by 5.4% in FY2020 (ends 30 September 2020) and by a further 1.8% \nin FY2021 (Figure 1). This reflects adverse impacts of ongoing border closures and social-distancing measures \non  agriculture  and  fisheries,  trade,  transportation,  and  tourism-related  services  sectors,  as  well  as  on  the \nimplementation of infrastructure projects. The temporary closure of the fisheries observer program which monitors \nthe fish catch of the purse seine fleet and reduced demand for vessel days result in loss of revenues.  \n\nThe economic contraction, can result in the loss of 1,975 full-time formal sector jobs by FY2021, representing a \n12% drop from FY2019 levels.a  With losses concentrated in hotels and restaurant (671); transport, storage, and \ncommunications (585); public administration, education, and health (476); and wholesale and retail trade (132). \nUp to 70% of those who are expected to lose their jobs are women (around 1,400). While some women would \nmove  to  the  subsistence  sector,  more  are  expected  to  withdraw  from  the  labor  market  leading  to  greater \nvulnerability. \n\nPer capita income is seen to fall by 3.6% from $3,427 in FY2019 to $3,305 in FY2021 (Table 1). An additional \n4,500 people can be pushed below the poverty line with poverty rates rising from 32.3% in FY2019 to 36.8% in \nFY2021 (Figure 2). Female-headed households, accounting for 20% of total, are expected to be more severely \naffected with poverty rates at 50%, compared to 39% for male-headed households.b  \n\n2. Countercyclical \n\ndevelopment expenditure \n\n  \nTo  address  the  emergency  and  immediate  financing  requirements  caused  by  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  the \ngovernment has approved a total package of $28.6 million in FY2020 (8.4% of GDP) and $30.1 million in FY2021 \n(8.9% of GDP). Key components of these development expenditures, include (i) a health action plan ($29 million) \non  COVID-19  preparedness  and  mitigation  response;  (ii)  an  economic  stimulus  package  ($18.4  million)  which \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n23 \n\nAccess Criteria \n\nADB Assessment \n\n 3. Pre-shock record of \ngenerally sound \nmacroeconomic \nmanagement \n\n4. Structural reforms \n\nincludes a Tourism Mitigation Fund, pandemic unemployment assistance, and for concessional loans to micro and \nsmall enterprises, with mandatory allocation of 50% of the total loan amount supporting women-owned enterprises; \nand (iii) social protection programs ($11.3 million) for the poor and vulnerable groups, including women, elderly, \npersons with disabilities, and victims of gender-based violence and sexual abuse. These are mainly funded through \ndevelopment  partner  grants,  with  the  rest  through  realignment  of  domestic  expenditures  and  funds,  including \nintended contributions to the FSM Trust Fund. \n\nAfter contracting by an average of 2.6% of GDP annually in FY2012\u2013FY2014, the economy grew by an average \nof 1.9% annually in FY2015\u2013FY2019. Main contributors were in the services sector: wholesale and retail trade, \nreal estate, and financial intermediation. Transport and communications, public administration, and agriculture and \nfisheries also contributed to the growth. The FSM had been running annual fiscal surpluses since FY2009, except \nfor a small deficit (1.8% of GDP) incurred in FY2011. Total grants and revenues\u2014mainly from fishing license fees \nand  corporate  income  tax  from  offshore  companies  reached  74.6%  of  GDP  in  FY2015\u2013FY2019,  while  total \nexpenditure was only 59.9% of GDP\u2014mainly due to restraint on the public sector wage bill. Fiscal surpluses rose \nsharply in FY2015\u2013FY2019, averaging 14.1% of GDP (Figure 3). These fiscal surpluses were used mainly to build \nup the FSM Trust Fund, which increased from $22 million in FY2014 to $270 million by FY2019 (the trust fund can \nonly  be  drawn  upon  after  FY2023  when  the  economic  provisions  under  the  Compact  Agreement  with  the  US \nexpire). The surplus was also used to reduce external debt from $81.1 million in FY2014 to $71.1million in FY2019 \n(from 28.1% of GDP to 20.2%). \n\nIn  preparation  of  a  potential  reduction  in  revenues  with  the  expiration  of  the  economic  provisions  of  the  US \nCompact  in  2023,  the  government  unveiled  in  2014  the  2023  Action  Plan.  Aimed  to  enhance  economic  and \nfinancial  stability,  the  plan  set  goals  in  terms  of  revenue  enhancement,  expenditure  management,  and  overall \neconomic reform. In FY2015, pay structure and staff grading of national government were reviewed and revised, \nrestraining increases in the public wage bill. Annual contributions to the FSM Trust Fund was increased through a \nseries of laws mandating mandatory percentages from fishing license fees and corporate income taxes. The share \nof state governments from the Compact Fund was also increased, providing  additional resources for states  for \nsocial spending. Since 2017, tax collection methods have been enhanced with further improvements expected as \nthe  new  automated  Revenue  Management  System  is  implemented  in  FY2020.  In  FY2019,  the  Financial \nManagement Act and related internal procedures were also updated. \n\nBoth the national and state governments took early and pre-emptive actions to contain the threat of the pandemic \noutside FSM borders. Interventions include the declaration of National Public Health Emergency which remains in \neffect;  closure  of  borders  for  all  international  arrivals;  mandatory  health  screenings  of  interstate  travelers;  and \nschool  closures.  The  government,  with  technical  support  from  WHO  and  UN,  has  developed  a  COVID-19 \nResponse Framework, which is the platform of the country\u2019s COVID-19 Health Action Plan (C-HAP) to strengthen \nthe  health  system\u2019s  capacity  for  surveillance  and  early  detection  of  diseases,  infection  prevention  control, \nquarantine,  isolation,  contact  tracing,  clinical  case  management,  and  laboratory  for  local  testing.  Risk \ncommunication and community outreach are also being implemented, in coordination with development partners, \n\n \n\n\fAccess Criteria \n\nADB Assessment \n\nto create public awareness on COVID-19. This framework also guides the mitigation interventions at both national \nand state levels, and across five scenarios based on the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases with an operational \nbudget disaggregated by sector and across the four states. The country has made progress in strengthening health \nscreening  and  surveillance  at  point-of-entry  in  airports  and  seaports,  procuring  essential  medical  supplies  and \nequipment.  The  framework  also  provides  for  separate  plans  for  vulnerable  populations  through  decentralized \nclinical services.  \n\nAlthough the FSM\u2019s public debt stock is relatively low, equivalent to 20.2% of GDP as of FY2019, the IMF rates \nthe  country\u2019s  risk  of  debt  distress  as  \u201chigh\u201d  in  view  of  a  reduction  in  revenues  after  FY2023  (Figure  4).  Debt \nsustainability analysis by ADB and the IMF (through a June 2020 assessment letter) maintains the high risk of debt \ndistress rating but concludes that the FSM\u2019s public debt remains sustainable. The COVID-19 crisis is projected to \nreverse the fiscal position to a deficit at least in FY2020, but the impact on  debt is expected to be moderate if \nfinancing  needs  continue  to  be  financed  by  grant  assistance  from  the  FSM\u2019s  development  partners.  The  IMF \nrecommends the development of a comprehensive fiscal adjustment strategy that accounts for the potential near-\nterm  impacts  of  the  pandemic,  the  medium-term  implications  of  the  fiscal  cliff,  and  the  long-term  impacts  of \ndisasters to safeguard debt sustainability. Tax and tax administration reforms, along with steady improvements in \npublic financial management, will be crucial elements of such a fiscal adjustment strategy.  \n\nADB  has  been  closely  coordinating  with  the  IMF  and  has  built  strong  relationships  through  active  participation \nduring  Article  IV  missions  and  staff  visits  to  FSM.  In  an  Assessment  Letter  (dated  25  June  2020),  the  IMF \nexpressed its support for the proposed CPRO and expressed agreement with ADB\u2019s views on: (i) FSM\u2019s pre-shock \nrecord of generally sound macroeconomic management, as reflected primarily by the achievement of annual fiscal \nsurpluses over a sustained period; and (ii) public debt remains sustainable, though the risk of debt distress is high \nmainly due to uncertainties pertaining to the renewal of the economic provisions of the Compact Agreement with \nthe US (currently under negotiations) expiring in 2023.  \n \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, CPRO = COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option, FSM = Federated States of Micronesia, FY = \nfiscal year, GDP = gross domestic product, IMF = International Monetary Fund, US = United States. \na  ADB estimates; Graduate School USA Pacific Islands Training Initiative. 2020.
