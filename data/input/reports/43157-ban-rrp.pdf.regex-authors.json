The proposed CSF will help the \nGovernment implement its countercyclical development program.  \n   \nRationale for the  Sound economic management enabled Bangladesh to withstand major \nPESF and CSF   external shocks while sustaining its growth momentum. The economy \nwas severely tested in FY2008 when it experienced repeated floods \nand the catastrophic cyclone Sidr, with major loss of life and destruction \nof property and crops; and the external shock resulting from surging \npetroleum and other commodity prices.  \n \nAlthough Bangladesh reduced poverty significantly between 1991 and \n2005,  the  country  still  remains  poor\u2014with  an  estimated  56  million \npeople or 40% of population in poverty in 2005. While Bangladesh is on \ntrack  to  achieve  the  2015  Millennium  Development  Goals  target  of \nreducing  income  poverty  by  half,  income  inequalities  widened \nespecially in the 1990s. Progress in poverty reduction has also been \nhighly uneven across regions.  \n \nEven without the global economic crisis, the development challenges in \nBangladesh  are  daunting.  Growth  in  exports  and  remittances \ndecelerated significantly since October\u2013December 2008 (the second \nquarter of FY2009). The economic slowdown is also affecting revenue \n ", "ii \n \ncollection. With more than 2.2 million workers directly engaged in the \nready-made  garments  sector,  and  an  equal  number  of  workers \nemployed in ancillary activities, the slowdown in exports translates into \nwidespread poverty in both urban and rural areas. Further, slowdown in \nthe growth of remittances will cause hardship for recipient households \nand deepen poverty. The decline in the number of workers leaving for \noverseas jobs will also create pressure on the already slack domestic \njob market. \n \nThe Government's development agenda, which pays particular attention \nto economic stability, elimination of poverty, energy security, combating \ncorruption,  and  good  governance,  reflects  its  concerns  about  the \neconomic  and  social  implications  of  the  crisis,  the  prevailing  high \npoverty  incidence,  and  the  effect  of  recent  natural  disasters.  The \nGovernment established a task force to monitor national and global \nevents, and provide prompt advice to enable decisions for mitigating the \nimpact of the crisis. In April 2009, the Government announced a fiscal \nstimulus  package  for  Tk34.2  billion  ($495  million)  for  exports, \nagriculture, power, and SSNPs.  \n \nThe  FY2010  budget  affirms  the  Government's  commitment  to \nmaintaining  macroeconomic  stability  and  undertaking  fundamental \npolicy and institutional reforms to attain pro-poor inclusive growth. A \ncountercyclical development program in the form of additional fiscal \nexpenditures was announced in the FY2010 budget in June 2009. The \nGovernment's  countercyclical  development  program  has  four  broad \ncomponents:  (i)  a  fiscal  stimulus  package;  (ii)  an  expansion  of  the \nSSNPs; (iii) a substantial increase in the Annual Development Program; \nand (iv) introduction of a new public\u2013private partnership (PPP) scheme. \n \nThe Government is aware that putting the economy on a higher growth \ntrajectory, and achieving rapid and sustainable poverty reduction will \nrequire large-scale investments well beyond what the Government can \nprovide.  More  investment-enabling  policy  measures  will  clearly  be \nneeded  to  induce  large-scale  domestic  and  foreign  investment.  To \nensure timely implementation of development programs, the capacity of \nline  ministries  will  also  need  to  be  enhanced.  In  addition,  ensuring \ncontinued flows of credit to the private sector, and strengthening the \ncapital market, would help attract investors to close the investment gap. \nMore support to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and the \nhousing sector would also contribute to making growth more inclusive.  \n \nIn  mitigating  the  adverse  impact  of  the  global  economic  crisis,  the \nGovernment's  emphasis  is  on  protecting  investments  in  human \ndevelopment through enhanced and effective spending on SSNPs. The \ncrisis has prompted the Government to undertake policy reforms to \nensure development momentum well into the future and to preempt \nhardships. Accordingly, support to the Government to deal with the \nimpact  of  the  global  crisis,  while  also  helping  to  address  some \ninstitutional limitations, is proposed to be provided through the PESF \nand the CSF. The objective of the PESF is to accelerate reforms that ", "iii \nare  essential  for  higher  long-term  economic  growth,  while  also \nimproving  service  delivery  for  social  protection.  The  CSF  will \nsupplement  the  PESF  by  providing  support  to  scale  up  the \nGovernment's countercyclical development program.  \n \nImpact and Outcome  The impact of the proposed PESF is to enhance pro-poor and gender-\ninclusive  growth  and  improve  living  standards  of  the  vulnerable \npopulations. The objective of the  proposed PESF is to  support the \nGovernment to better address the adverse impact on the economy from \nexternal  shocks  as  well  as  inherent  weaknesses  in  the  enabling \nenvironment for private sector development and social service delivery. \nThe outcome of the PESF is a stable macroeconomic environment \nwhere private sector development is emphasized and where women \nand  vulnerable  populations  have  greater  access  to  social  services, \nincluding through effective gender targeting. \n \nThe proposed PESF will support the Government to put in place policy \nactions in three areas: (i) delivering services effectively\u2014by supporting \nthe  Government  in  undertaking  a  significant  scaling  up  of  SSNPs, \neffective  gender  targeting,  and  legal  measures  for  greater  say  in \nensuring quality and effectiveness of service delivery; (ii) developing a \nconducive  investment  climate\u2014by  strengthening  the  Government's \nability  to  attract  private  investment,  in  particular  through  PPPs,  in \nsectors critical to sustaining and accelerating economic growth; and (iii) \nstrengthening the public financial management system\u2014by helping the \nGovernment to increase fiscal space through enhanced efficiency and \nintegrity in public spending, and higher revenue generation. \n \n  The  impact  of  the  proposed  CSF  is  to  contribute  to  Government's \nefforts to achieve higher growth and improve living standards given the \ncountry's exposure to external shocks. The objective of the proposed \nCSF  is  to  help  the  Government  implement  its  countercyclical \ndevelopment program for coping with the effects of the global crisis. \nThe outcome of the proposed CSF is macroeconomic stability, higher \npublic and private investment, and greater access to social services by \nwomen and vulnerable populations. \n \nFinancing Plan  A.   The proposed loans for the PESF are as follows: \n   \n  (i)     Two loans totaling $144.85 million equivalent from the Special \nFunds resources of the Asian Development Bank (ADB): (a) a \n\u201chard-term\u201d  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF)  loan  of  $44.85 \nmillion equivalent, and (b) a \u201csoft-term\u201d ADF loan of $100 million \nequivalent. The ADF loans will both have a term of 24 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years; interest under the hard-term \nADF loan will be at 1.6% per annum for the life of the loan while \ninterest under the soft-term ADF loan will be at 1.0% per annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. Other \nterms and conditions will be set forth in the related draft Loan \nAgreements. \n ", "iv \n \n   \n  (ii)     A loan of $100 million from ADB's ordinary capital resources \nwill be provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have a 15-year \nterm  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  and  interest  rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such \nother  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan \nAgreement. \n   \n  B.     For the CSF, the proposed loan is as follows: \n   \n  A loan of $500 million from ADB's ordinary capital resources. The loan \nwill have a 5-year term including a grace period of 3 years, an annual \ninterest rate equal to ADB's LIBOR-based lending facility plus 2.0%, \nand  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan \nAgreement.  \n   \nProgram  Period  and  The implementation period for the PESF and the CSF is from October \nTranching  2009 to December 2010. All policy actions and disbursements under \nthe PESF will be implemented within this period. The PESF loans are \nproposed to be released in two tranches, subject to the Government \nmeeting the conditions for release of the tranches. The CSF will be \ndisbursed in a single tranche upon loan effectiveness. \n   \nCounterpart Funding  The local currency generated from the proceeds of the PESF loans will \nbe  used  to  finance  adjustment  costs  under  the  PESF,  including  (i) \nscaling up of SSNPs, (ii) mainstreaming PPPs and supporting SMEs, \nand (iii) enhancing public financial management. The local currency \ngenerated from the proceeds of the CSF loan will support SSNPs.  \n   \nExecuting Agency  The Ministry of Finance (MOF) \n   \nImplementation  The  MOF  will  be  responsible  for  the  overall  implementation  of  the \nArrangements  PESF,  including  compliance  with  all  policy  actions,  facilitating \nadministration,  disbursements,  and  maintenance  of  records.  A  joint \nsecretary of the Finance Division, MOF, will act as the program director. \nThe implementing agencies for the PESF will consist of the relevant \nministries  and  agencies,  as  described  in  this  report  and \nrecommendation of the President. The implementing agencies will be \nresponsible  for  meeting  the  policy  actions  under  their  respective \njurisdictions. A program steering committee (PSC) will be established \nand will be responsible for overall direction, guidance, monitoring, and \noversight. Its members will include representatives not below the rank \nof joint secretary from all the relevant implementing agencies and the \nEconomic Relations Division. The finance secretary will chair the PSC. \nThe PSC will meet at least quarterly to discuss the progress of the \nfacility  and  review  macroeconomic  conditions  to  ensure  continued \nstability.  ", "v \n  The implementation arrangements for the CSF will be the same as \nthose for the PESF, with the MOF acting as the executing agency. The \nimplementing  agencies\u2014the  same  as  those  for  the  PESF\u2014will  be \nmaintained for monitoring purposes. \n \nProcurement and  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange \nDisbursement  costs (excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and procured \nin  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports \nfinanced by other bilateral and multilateral sources. The Government \nwill  certify  its  compliance  with  this  formula  with  each  withdrawal \nrequest. Otherwise, import documentation under existing procedures \nwill be required. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of the loan \nproceeds and verify the Government's certification. The loan proceeds \nwill be disbursed to the Borrower in accordance with the provisions of \nADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements for Program Loans. \n   \nProgram Benefits  Scaled up SSNPs will help to cushion the impact of the crisis; improve \nand Beneficiaries  household well-being; and help reduce poverty through better nutrition, \neducation, and improved opportunities to participate in the economy. \nIncreased spending on SMEs, housing, and infrastructure will promote \nhigher long-term growth, create jobs, and raise incomes. Other benefits \ninclude: \n \n(i)   As a result of reforms supported by the PESF, the poor will be \nempowered to claim and receive the benefits they are entitled \nto because of enhanced access to information and oversight. \nThe Employment Generation Program for the Hardcore Poor \nwill help improve economic opportunities.  \n \n(ii)   The PESF and CSF will provide additional resources to help \nexpand SSNPs to also cover people who previously were not \npoor but who are hurt by the crisis, such as households highly \ndependent  on  remittances,  laid  off  expatriate  and  factory \nworkers  in  affected  export  sectors,  women  forced  into  low-\npaying  and  insecure  jobs,  and  the  large  number  of  young \npeople  joining  the  labor  market  at  a  time  of  shrinking  job \nopportunities.  \n \n(iii)   The  PESF  and  CSF  will  create  fiscal  space  to  enable  the \nGovernment to finance scaled up infrastructure investment and \nfiscal  stimulus  spending.  These  additional  expenditures  will \nhelp reduce the risk of unemployment and income loss in the \nimmediate term, and also enhance long-term growth prospects \nwithout compromising macroeconomic stability or crowding out \nprivate investment.  \n \n(iv)   Successful PPPs in infrastructure and social sectors over the \nmedium- to long-term will enable higher investment in social \nexpenditures  and  broaden  management  capacity  for \ninfrastructure projects.  \n ", "vi \n \n(v)   The results from performance monitoring and reporting systems \nwill feed into the planning and budgeting process to ensure \naccountability on public spending and to control irregularities. \nEnhanced internal and external control measures and oversight \nwill  have  been  put  in  place  to  reduce  the  opportunities  for \ncorruption.  \n   \nRisks and  (i)    A prolonged economic downturn would likely result in lower \nMitigations  fiscal  revenue  and  accentuate  the  risk  of  the  budget  deficit \nexceeding 5% of gross domestic product. This would lead to a \ncorrespondingly  higher  government  borrowing  requirement, \nwhich would be inflationary and seriously limit the availability of \ncredit to the private sector. The countercyclical measures to \nsupport affected sectors and broaden access to credit for SMEs \nand  women  entrepreneurs  will  provide  some  relief  to  those \nmost likely to be affected.    \n \n(ii)   A further decline in remittances would have a negative impact \non the livelihood of many rural households heavily dependent \non such income. SSNPs targeting people with low income and \nno assets will mitigate this risk.  \n \n(iii)   Leakages,  poor  targeting,  and  corruption  could  reduce  the \neffectiveness of expenditures. However, actions taken under \nthe PESF to enhance access to information for the poor and \nvulnerable groups and to strengthen oversight will help mitigate \nsuch concerns.  \n \n(iv)   Limited  absorption  capacity  could  continue  to  constrain \nimplementation  of  development  projects.  Government  line \nministries have been instructed to advance the preparation of \nproject approval and procurement documents in FY2010 and \ntheir  performance  is  being  more  closely  monitored,  which \nshould help accelerate investment spending.  \n \n(v)       Relief and reconstruction efforts in the case of natural disasters \ncould potentially disrupt infrastructure investments and impose \na heavy burden on government finances. The higher allocation \nin the FY2010 budget for the Fund for Climate Change and \nfiscal space created through the PESF and CSF would facilitate \nGovernment's response to such events.  \n \n \n ", "   \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto the People's Republic of Bangladesh for the (i) Public Expenditure Support Facility (PESF) \nProgram and (ii) Countercyclical Support Facility (CSF) Support Program.1 The design and \nmonitoring framework for the PESF is in Appendix 1 and for the CSF in Appendix 2.2 \n \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \nA.  Recent Economic Performance  \n2.   The effect of the global economic crisis (global crisis or crisis) on the Bangladesh \neconomy is significant. While limited exposure to the global financial system kept Bangladesh \nlargely  untouched  by  the  first-round  effects  of  the  crisis,  the  country  started  experiencing \nsignificant deceleration in growth of exports and remittances from the second quarter of FY \n2009 (i.e., October\u2013December 2008). Since October 2008, the second round effects (slowdown \nin exports and remittances spreading to the broader economy) of the crisis have adversely \nimpacted the real economy, as the global crisis transformed into a global recession. Growth in \nexports during FY2009 declined to 10.1% from 17.4% in FY2008. On a year-on-year basis, \nexports declined by 2.3% in April 2009, grew by only 4.3% in May, but declined again by 3% in \nJune 2009 and a further 6.8% in July 2009. Growth in remittances, a key driver of growth in \nBangladesh, started falling on a year-on-year basis from October 2008 (16% in that month) after \ngrowing at a monthly average of 43.5% during July-September 2008. Growth in remittances \ndropped to only 10.1% during February-April 2009, and after a brief spike in May\u2013June 2008, \nfell  to  8%  in  July  2009.  The  global  economic  slowdown  is  seriously  affecting  revenue \ncollection\u23aftax revenues in FY2009 (accounting for around 80% of total revenues) grew by only \n10.7%, down from 27.3% in FY2008.  \n \n3.  Prudent  macroeconomic  management  in  Bangladesh  had  contributed  to  achieving \nrobust economic growth while maintaining internal and external balances until the onset of the \ncrisis (Table 1). These results were achieved in the face of repeated natural disasters. Fiscal \ndeficits  remained  less than  4%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  during  FY2003\u2013FY2007. \nRobust  growth  in  exports  and  remittances  underpinned  steady  current  account  surpluses \nbetween FY2002 and the early part of FY2009 (except in FY2005) and contributed to healthy \nforeign  reserves.  Inflation  remained  below  7%  between  FY2002  and  FY2005,  and  slightly \nexceeded 7% in FY2006\u2013FY2007. Because of the effects of the natural disasters and the rise in \nfood and commodity prices in 2008, inflation shot up to 9.9% in 2008 and the fiscal deficit rose \nto 4.7% of GDP as a result of larger budgetary allocations needed to alleviate the effect on the \n                                                 \n1  The PESF is the outcome of policy dialogue with the Government of Bangladesh to address critical constraints to \neconomic growth, social development, and good governance. Realizing the challenges in fulfilling its development \nagenda especially during the global economic crisis, the Government agreed to accelerate critical reforms that are \nbeing supported by the PESF. Building on the PESF reforms, the CSF supports social safety net measures under \nthe Government's countercyclical development program.  \n2  The PESF follows the standard program loan format and the CSF is in accordance with guidelines for implementing \nthe CSF (ADB. 2009. Enhancing ADB's Response to the Global Economic Crisis\u2013Establishing the Countercyclical \nSupport Facility. Manila). Processing of the PESF as a program loan with two management review meetings also \nenabled a detailed review of the Government's countercyclical development program to be supported by the CSF. \nWhile  the  core  aspects  of  the  PESF  and  the  CSF  have  been  discussed  separately  in  the  report  and \nrecommendation of the President (including the design and monitoring frameworks and the development policy \nletters), the sections such as on implementation, special features, benefits and impact have been presented jointly, \nreflecting their complementarity. In this report, the term \"Program\" refers to the PESF and the CSF jointly.  \n ", "2 \n \npoor. In FY2009, the inflation rate declined to 6.7% and the fiscal deficit is estimated to have \ndeclined to a little over 4%.  \n \nTable 1: Bangladesh \u2013 Selected Economic Indicators \nItem  FY2005  FY2006  FY2007  FY2008  FY2009a \nA.

Bangladesh achieved an average real GDP growth of 6.2% during the period FY2004\u2013\nFY2009, which is respectable but has been inadequate to achieve a major dent in the level of \npoverty,  and  lower  than  the  7%  growth  envisioned  in  the  first  national  poverty  reduction \nstrategy.3 GDP growth in FY2009 is estimated at 5.9% (down from 6.4% in FY2007 and 6.2% in \nFY2008) even after countercyclical measures (paras. 6 and 8) due to the effects of the global \neconomic slowdown, and GDP growth is expected to be yet lower in FY2010 (at 5.2% as \ncompared to 5.9% in FY2009). Although agriculture has recovered, underpinned by favorable \nweather conditions and strong public policy support, and will be an important rebalancing factor, \nslower growth of exports and remittances had knock-on effects on industry and services in \nFY2009 that will continue into FY2010, through weaker external and domestic demand. The \nservices sector will moderate due to the slowdown in industrial activities and trade as well as \nweaker private consumption due to the slowdown in remittance inflows. The growth of GDP is \nexpected to be lower in FY2010 also on the basis of the lower growth in industrial term loans \nand sharp decline in the opening of letters of credit for capital machinery.  \n                                                 \n3  Government of Bangladesh. 2005. Unlocking the Potential: National Strategy for Accelerated Poverty Reduction. \nDhaka. ", "3 \n5.  Although Bangladesh made significant progress in poverty reduction between FY1991 \nand FY2005,4 the country still remains poor\u2014with an estimated 56 million people in poverty in \n2005. While Bangladesh is on track to achieve the 2015 Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \ntarget of reducing income poverty by half, and has made progress in other indicators of well-\nbeing (such as for infant and child mortality, and has met the target for gender parity in primary \nand secondary schooling), income inequalities widened especially in the 1990s. In terms of \ncalorie intake, although the incidence of poverty has declined in rural areas, it has increased in \nurban areas. Progress in poverty reduction has also been highly uneven across regions.  \n \nB.  Government Strategy  \n6.  The global economic crisis began to have an impact on Bangladesh during the second \nquarter  of  FY2009,  which  coincided  with  the  transition  from  a  caretaker  government  to  a \ndemocratically  elected  one.  This  transition  also  coincided  with  a  general  perception  that \nBangladesh may largely remain immune to the global crisis given its strong macroeconomic \nperformance and limited exposure to financial contagion. However, as soon as the current \nGovernment assumed office in January 2009, the second round impact of the crisis became \napparent. The Government promptly established a task force to develop a comprehensive \ninformation center, continually monitor national and global events, and provide prompt advice to \nhelp make the decisions needed to mitigate the impact of the crisis. The Government's first \nresponse to the crisis, announced in April 2009 (para. 74), was a Tk34.2 billion ($495 million) \nstimulus package for exports, agriculture, power, and social safety net programs (SSNPs).5   \n \n7.  Cognizant of the economic and social implications of the crisis and the prevailing high \npoverty incidence, the election manifesto6 of the Government in late 2008 had already outlined \nan  ambitious  development  agenda  with  particular  attention  to  inclusive  growth.  The \ndevelopment strategy in the manifesto covers five key issues: (i) economic stability and control \nover commodity price hike, (ii) elimination of poverty and inequity, (iii) energy security, (iv) \nanticorruption, and (v) good governance. To align with these priorities, the Government is \nrevising the National Strategy for Accelerated Poverty Reduction (NSAPR-II)7 prepared by the \ncaretaker government in October 2008. No major overhaul is envisaged since the NSAPR-II \nalso stresses strengthening SSNPs, creating job opportunities, ensuring regional balance in \ndevelopment, and facilitating decentralized growth. The emphasis in the NSAPR-II on improving \ngovernance, controlling population growth, strengthening focus on women's advancement, and \nensuring environmental protection is also in line with Government priorities. \n \n8.  In its first budget (for FY2010) in June 2009, the Government provided its medium-term \ndevelopment  agenda.  The  FY2010  budget  attaches  high  priority  to  infrastructure,  human \nresource development, and capacity building. It seeks to raise the level of investments by \nmobilizing more resources, with a major thrust on public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs), and \nsimplifying  investment-related  laws  and  regulations.  Expansion  of  SSNPs,  ensuring  food \nsecurity and addressing the effects of climate change are prominent features of the FY2010 \nbudget.  Based  on  the  task  force  recommendations,  the  Government\u2019s  April  2009  stimulus \n                                                 \n4  The latest Household Income and Expenditure Survey was conducted in 2005. During 1991\u20132005, the compound \npoverty reduction rate per year is recorded at 1.3% although the rate of reduction in urban areas is faster than that \nin rural areas. During the period 2000\u20132005, income poverty was reduced from 48.9% to 40% (1.8% annually).  \n5  SSNPs collectively refer to Government programs to support  those who are  geographically, socially,  and \nseasonally vulnerable (see paras. 13 and 14, and Appendix 3 for details).  \n6  Government of Bangladesh. 2008.

Dhaka.  \n ", "4 \n \npackage (paras. 6 and 74) was further expanded in the FY2010 budget to give impetus (paras. \n75-77) to exports, infrastructure investments, and scaling up of SSNPs.  \n \n9.  The Government recognizes that in FY2010, it will face constraints in implementing its \nessential spending programs in the social sectors as well as infrastructure investments\u2014the \nsituation will be compounded by the likely weaker revenue collection. Lower revenues will also \nmake it difficult for the Government to mobilize required counterpart funds for donor-funded \nprojects. The global economic slowdown may also affect the flow of external aid, especially from \nbilateral sources. The Government is concerned that the current global crisis will also have \nadverse effects on its efforts to reduce poverty if there is reduced economic growth, job losses, \nand shrinking job opportunities. To mitigate the impact of the global economic crisis on the poor, \nthe  Government  is  willing  to  undertake  long-term  policy  reforms  so  as  not  to  disrupt \ndevelopment  momentum  and  at  the  same  time  scale  up  SSNPs  and  expand  essential \ninfrastructure in the event of pronounced growth slowdown. In this context, the Government \nrequested  ADB  to  help  prioritize  and  sequence  the  reforms  in  the  overall  context  of  its \ndevelopment agenda (para. 8), help catalyze recovery and long-term inclusive growth, and also \nsupport its countercyclical development program.  \n \nIII.  SECTOR ANALYSIS FOR THE PUBLIC EXPENDITURE SUPPORT FACILITY \nPROGRAM  \nA.  Problems and Opportunities8 \n1.  Key Problems \n10.  Unleashing Bangladesh's development potential is a long and complex process, which \nrequires  far-reaching  policy  and  institutional  reforms  and  substantial  investments  in \ninfrastructure  and  human  development.  At  the  same  time,  protecting  the  poor  and  the \nvulnerable sections9 of society is particularly important in view of the country's high poverty \nincidence and extreme vulnerability to natural disasters. The global crisis has accentuated these \nvulnerabilities. While inclusive growth would enable the poor to contribute to, and benefit from, \neconomic recovery and future growth, Bangladesh has been slow to realize this potential due to \ndeficiencies in, among others, social protection and social service delivery, investment policies, \nand public financial management (Appendix 3).10  \n \na.  Social Protection and Social Service Delivery \n11.  Notwithstanding the substantial gains in poverty reduction, progress in reducing poverty \nhas been uneven across regions. The largest decline in poverty incidence occurred in the \neastern part of the country but the poverty headcount ratio stagnated or rose slightly in the \nwestern  region,  where  half  of  the  population  remains  poor.  In  rural  areas,  earnings  are \nconstrained by low rates of return from agricultural and few nonfarm employment opportunities. \n                                                 \n8  The Problems and Constraints Analysis is in Supplementary Appendix A and Poverty Analysis is in Supplementary \nAppendix C. \n9  The groups particularly vulnerable to risks include: (i) infants and children that face the risk of poverty, malnutrition, \nlow human capital accumulation, and exploitation in the labor force; (ii) working age adults that face the risk of \nunemployment and low productivity; (iii) elderly adults that lack adequate safety nets; (iv) special and excluded \ngroups that need assistance; and (v) a majority of women who have very limited access to empowerment and \nproductive employment opportunities. \n10 For the purposes of the PESF, the term sector refers to (i) service delivery in the domain of SSNPs; (ii) public \nfinancial  management,  particularly,  public  expenditure  management,  public  sector  efficiency  and  revenue \nmobilization, and financial and fiscal management; and (iii) private sector development especially through PPPs.  ", "5 \nLandless seasonal workers face a yearly threat of survival during the monsoon. Moreover, \nfrequent natural disasters cause severe losses in terms of life and property damage. Most \nrecently, cyclone Aila hit the coastal areas of the southwest region of the country causing \ndamage to life and property.11 As the poor live in, and depend disproportionately on, marginal \nlands, including coastal belts, they are the most vulnerable to natural disasters. These disasters \nalso impose a huge budgetary burden on the Government through higher allocations for relief \nand reconstruction as well as tax its implementation capacity.  \n \n12.  Women are more vulnerable to poverty in Bangladesh because of their limited access to \neconomic resources, their lower level of education,12 and their extremely low participation in \nwage work or self-employment opportunities in nonfarm activities. Women comprise the majority \nof  the  export  manufacturing  workforce,  but  concentrate  mostly  in  insecure  jobs  with  low \nearnings. The current global crisis could throw a large number of women out of work, especially \nin the ready-made garments industry that employs 2.2 million workers, mostly women, or push \nthem into insecure jobs. Reduction in remittances could severely affect household food security, \nespecially as many families are still battered by the impact of the food crisis in 2008. Returning \nmigrant  workers  could put  more  pressure  on the  already  limited  land  resources  and  rural \nnonfarm employment opportunities.  \n \n13.  The Government provides extensive SSNPs to support those who are geographically, \nsocially, and seasonally vulnerable (Appendix 3 and Supplementary Appendix B). Up to FY2009, \nthere were 57 SSNPs, and SSNP-related expenditure amounted to 2.3% of GDP. These SSNPs \ninclude: (i) special allowances and cash transfers for different underprivileged sections of the \npopulation; (ii) food security-based activities; (iii) employment generation for poverty reduction \nthrough microcredit programs; and (iv) education, health, training, and technical assistance to \nmake the new generation more self-reliant. Nearly 72 million beneficiaries accessed the SSNPs \nduring FY2009 (although this number includes those that accessed more than one SSNP). \n \n14.  It is widely recognized that SSNPs have played a major role in helping the poor and \nvulnerable to improve their livelihoods, and health and nutrition status, as well as protecting \nthem from the impact of a worsening environment. Nearly half of the SSNP beneficiaries are \nwomen. Yet, the SSNPs face considerable challenges because of insufficient targeting and \ninefficiencies in service delivery (para.79). Weak implementation capacity of local governments \nand agencies and low oversight of project execution are additional issues. Despite efforts by \nsuccessive  governments,  service  delivery  mechanisms  in  the  public  sector  have  remained \nweak. The main constraints to developing an effective service delivery system are lack of \ntransparency and the absence of a legal framework to enable the citizens to have access to \ninformation to empower them to demand protection from abuses. In addition, as consumers, the \npeople in general, and the poor in particular, have little, if any, legal protection on the quality of \ngoods and services.  \n \n                                                 \n11 Cyclone Aila, in May 2009, left more than 200 people dead and set the economy back considerably, while cyclone \nSidr, in November 2007, left a death toll of almost 4,000 people and an economic loss of approximately $1.4 billion \n(approximately 2% of GDP). Economic costs of natural disasters are also felt hard by small businesses situated in \nthe coastal areas. In the seven Upazilas (sub-districts) of Cox's Bazar district alone, cyclone Aila caused damage \nto the fish and shrimp industry of approximately $6 million (Source: Star Business. 2009).  \n12 This is despite Bangladesh having already met the MDG targets for gender parity in primary and secondary \nschooling. \n ", "6 \n \nb.  Investment Climate  \n15.  With scarce public resources, it is imperative for Bangladesh to attract private sector \ninvestment for enhanced efficiency and productivity. However, inadequate infrastructure, low \nskill level of laborers, scarcity of skilled mid-level and senior managers, unstable regulatory \nenvironment, and a weak contract enforcement system all work against the private sector as \nwell as foreign direct investment in Bangladesh. While the oil, gas, and telecommunications \nsectors have attracted foreign direct investment in recent years, projects are still delayed by \nlong approval times. Overall, doing business remains difficult in Bangladesh, which was ranked \n110 out of 181 countries in 2009 in terms of ease in doing business.13  \n \n16.  Sustained  growth  with  poverty  reduction  in  Bangladesh  cannot  be  attained  without \nsubstantial  investments  in  infrastructure.  Although  infrastructure  is  a  critical  feature  of  a \ncountry's investment climate, under-investment over the years has resulted in acute deficiencies \nin the availability of infrastructure, especially in power and energy, ports, and roads, which \nrestrict business opportunities and access to public services. Erratic and insufficient power \nsupply is estimated to cost Bangladesh some 2% of GDP growth every year. The situation for \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is even worse, as they cannot afford generators of \ntheir own.  \n \n17.  Mobilizing finance for private investment in infrastructure is a major challenge in the \nabsence of a well-developed domestic capital market and a lack of appetite of foreign private \ninvestors for investment in infrastructure. Attempts to attract the private sector under PPP \nschemes have had only limited success, in part due to inadequate (i) project development \nefforts and skills, (ii) coordination mechanisms and leadership, and (iii) clarity on the legal \nframework for PPPs. Even though the Private Sector Infrastructure Guidelines (PSIG) issued in \n2004 are currently the basis for implementation of PPP projects, there is a lack of clarity on the \nconsistency  between  the  Public  Procurement  Regulations  and  private  sector  project \ndevelopment, approval, and financing provisions under the jurisdiction of PSIG.   \n \n18.  While significant financial sector reform14 initiatives are underway, market gaps remain. \nCredit for SMEs and the rural nonfarm sector remains inadequate notwithstanding their critical \nrole in poverty reduction through employment generation in rural nonfarm activities. Specialized \nfinancial institutions like Bangladesh Shilpa Bank and Bangladesh Shilpa Rin Shangstha have a \npoor  record  of  lending  to  SMEs.  The  limited  capacity  of  the  credit  information  bureau  at \nBangladesh Bank (the central bank) has impeded access to reliable information on potential \nclients. Notwithstanding the major ongoing capital market development efforts, the market is not \ndeep enough for mobilizing resources to support private sector activity and promote economic \ngrowth in a substantial manner. \n \n                                                 \n13 In a related indicator of doing business, typical property registration procedures take around 245 days to be \ncompleted, while the same procedures take only 5 days in Nepal, 45 days in India, and 50 days in Pakistan. In the \n'shipping difficulty index' (where the higher the score, the greater the difficulty), Bangladesh scored 112 compared \nto India 79, Sri Lanka 60, and Malaysia 21. Doing Business 2009, World Bank 2009. http://www.doingbusiness.org/; \nInternational Finance Corporation. 2009. http://www.enterprisesurveys.org/  \n14 Reforms supported by the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and ADB in the financial sector focus on \n(i) greater autonomy for Bangladesh Bank (the central bank), (ii) strengthening Bangladesh Bank\u2019s capabilities to \nperform its enhanced responsibilities, (iii) strengthening prudential regulations and supervision, (iv) restructuring \nthe  management  and  internal  processes  of  state-owned  commercial  banks  and  ultimately  privatization,  (v) \nstrengthening legal and judicial processes, and (vi) improving money and debt markets.  ", "7 \nc.  Public Financial Management15 \n19.  Although Bangladesh has carried out fiscal reforms with some success in recent years, \nrevenues  have  remained  low  because  of  a  narrow  tax  base,  extensive  use  of  ad-hoc \nexemptions and exclusions, and excessively complex tax rules and administrative procedures, \nas well as weak tax administration, which have encouraged pervasive tax evasion. Outdated tax \nlaws and regulations have further complicated enforcement of fiscal discipline. Government tax \nrevenue collection at 9.0% of GDP is low by international standards reflecting weaknesses in \nthe  public  resource  management  system.  Low  revenues have  constrained  essential  public \nexpenditure, resulting in a level of public expenditure (15.3% of GDP in FY2009) that is low by \ninternational standards.  \n \n20.  The public financial management (PFM) system has remained weak because of rigidities \nconstraining line ministry spending, poor monitoring, low budget allocation for operation and \nmaintenance, inconsistency between sector allocations and development priorities, and lack of \na  unified  budget  preparation  system  that  clearly  distinguishes  capital  from  recurrent \nexpenditures. Weak management capacity, and insufficient transparency and accountability, \nhave hampered the efficiency of public spending despite the introduction of the Medium-Term \nBudgetary Framework (MTBF) in 2005 to strengthen the links between planning and budgeting \nas well as between resource allocation and performance. The Government has been unable to \nscale up public infrastructure spending. While the budget allocation for the Annual Development \nProgram16 (ADP) has remained broadly steady, actual spending has declined from 5.0% of GDP \nin FY2005 to 3.2% in FY2009, mainly because of poor planning and weak implementation \ncapacity (para. 80) in government agencies. In addition, prioritization of spending has been \ninsufficient; transfers and subsidies to loss-making state-owned enterprises still absorb a large \nshare of resources.  \n \n21.  Public expenditures at lower levels of Government and state-owned enterprises are still \nnot systematically consolidated in the fiscal accounts and reporting framework, making it difficult \nto assess and improve the use of public resources. The audit function remains weak with little \nfocus on outcomes and performance of the programs, resulting in little impact on financial \naccountability. Both the annual accounts and audit reports are issued with a considerable time \nlag (more than 12 months from the end of the fiscal year).  \n \n2.  Opportunities  \na.  Enhancing Service Delivery  \n22.  In the context of the global crisis, and in response to recent natural disasters (most \nrecently, cyclone Aila), the Government has taken a conscious policy decision to scale up \nSSNPs to prevent large segments of the population from sliding deeper into poverty, and to \nprovide relief to the additional non-poor who are expected to fall into poverty. Increasing the \ncoverage and improving the quality and effectiveness of service delivery will be critical to ensure \nthat expanded SSNPs achieve the desired results. The Government is aware of the need to \n                                                 \n15 As used in this document, the term 'public financial management' refers to broader perspectives of fiscal and \nfinancial management.  \n16 The ADP is the annual budget for financing development investment projects in Bangladesh. As capital expenditure, \nADP is the main channel for public investment in infrastructure. Development Partners are actively involved in \nhelping the Government prepare and implement ADP projects and provide substantial financing. The allocation for \nADP  in  the  FY2010  budget  is  nearly  $4.4  billion  compared  to  $3.3  billion  in  FY2009.  The  Government's \ncountercyclical development program includes a large increase in ADP allocations.  \n ", "8 \n \nincrease the focus on SSNPs that contribute to human capital development and reduce the \nimpact of seasonality in the availability of work. The Government is willing to enhance the \neligibility criteria for better targeting and minimizing leaks and to implement gender budgeting \nguidelines for tracking gender disaggregated expenditures. \n \n23.  The  Government  has  increasingly  recognized  the  need  for  addressing  the  generic \nproblem of deficiencies and weaknesses in the broader governance agenda in the country, \nwhich impacts effective service delivery. Accordingly, the Government is institutionalizing a \nnumber  of  initiatives  for  enhancing  transparency,  accountability,  and  service  delivery \nmechanisms in government agencies.17 These include access to information to help improve \ntransparency in public service provision and to protect the rights and interests of consumers \nthrough legislative means.  \n \nb.  Investment Climate  \n24.  The Government is aware that significant acceleration of economic growth with rapid \nand sustainable poverty reduction will require substantial scaling up of infrastructure investment \nfrom current levels, which is well beyond the financial capacity of the Government. Government \nestimates, released in June 2009, suggest an investment gap of $28 billion from FY2010 until \nFY2014 to achieve an annual GDP growth rate of 8% by 2013.18 Therefore, the Government \nhas launched reforms to establish an enabling environment for PPPs19 to improve the regulatory \nregime  and  simplify  procedures  as  well  as  to  provide  resources  for  mainstreaming  PPPs \nthrough  project  development,  credit  enhancement,  and  refinancing  facilities.  Further,  the \nGovernment  is  keen  to  develop  the  capital  market20 to  help  attract  investors  to  close  the \ninfrastructure investment gap. If successfully implemented, PPPs would make an important \ncontribution  to  both  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  because  investment  in  social \ninfrastructure  as  well  as  in  transport  and  power  would  benefit  the  poor  both  directly  and \nindirectly through better access to health facilities, job opportunities, and market outlets.21 \n \n25.  Keen to create space for SMEs to play their dual role of contributing to growth and \nincreasing employment and incomes for poverty reduction, the Government has initiated actions \nto facilitate SMEs' access to credit information and is pursuing the enactment of a secured \n                                                 \n17 ADB is extending support to enhance anticorruption measures, transparency, and accountability in public service \ndelivery through ADB. 2007.

Public Financial Management \n   \n26.  The Government has demonstrated strong ownership of the PFM reform agenda in \npreparing a Medium-Term Rolling Action Plan that outlines its PFM vision, strategic objectives, \nand priorities (Appendix 3). Progress has been achieved in terms of improving procedures, \ndeveloping a computerized database, streamlining administrative practices, reducing time lags \nin the preparation of budget and accounting reports, and developing capacity in budgeting, \naccounting, and auditing. Recent PFM reforms have meant that timeliness of fiscal reporting \nhas  improved.  To  strengthen  budget  execution,  efforts  have  been  made  to  improve  the \naccuracy  and  timeliness  of  accounts  by  further  computerizing  accounting  transactions.  In \naddition, the process of preparing the Annual Finance and Appropriation Accounts has been \nstreamlined. Government is also increasingly generating data on its contingent liabilities vis-\u00e0-\nvis state-owned enterprises and reporting them. Increased transparency and timeliness provide \nthe basis for enhancing incentives for cost saving and improved resource management. The \nGovernment is also reviewing civil service salaries and emoluments for providing adequate \nincentives. \n \n27.  Several new measures announced by the Government to raise the tax-to-GDP ratio \nprovide opportunities to expand the tax base, withdraw certain exemptions and exclusions, \nsimplify procedures, amend laws, and streamline tax administration. The Government is also \ncommitted to enhancing transparency in the procurement process. Steps have also been taken \nto develop awareness regarding information on progress of implementation, purchase plans, \nand monitoring of important projects included in the ADP. The MTBF is being introduced in \nadditional  ministries.  These  measures  set  the  basis  to  better  manage  public  resource \nallocations and enhance the link between the poverty reduction strategy and the annual budgets. \n \nB.  ADB Strategy and Operations \n28.  ADB\u2019s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2006\u2013201024 seeks to assist Bangladesh in \naddressing  the  critical  constraints  to  economic  growth,  social  development,25 and  good \ngovernance. The continued validity of these three CPS strategic pillars has been reconfirmed by \nrecent economic and political developments, and progress in poverty reduction and human \n                                                 \n22 This is supported by a project started in May 2009 funded by the Department for International Development (DFID) \nof  the  United  Kingdom  and  managed  by  the  International  Finance  Corporation\u2019s  South  Asia  Enterprise \nDevelopment Facility (SEDF). \n23 These measures are based on recommendations under ADB\u2019s ongoing SME Sector Development Program (ADB. \n2004.

While  the  new  government  is  reviewing  the  NSAPR-II  against  its  election \nmanifesto (para. 7), dialogue with key government officials during the recently conducted CPS \nmidterm review indicated no major change in development priorities. The Country Operations \nBusiness Plan 2010\u20132012, which is an appendix to the CPS midterm review, takes into account \na possible slowdown in revenue collection in view of the global crisis, which could constrain the \nGovernment\u2019s ability to finance essential public spending on infrastructure and social sector \nprograms.  \n \n29.   During 2010\u20132012, ADB is expected to continue to play a major role in supporting \ninvestment and policy and institutional reforms in energy and power, transport, education, and \nintegrated urban infrastructure (including water supply and sanitation). ADB will also continue \nintegrating governance concerns into its sector operations as well as its support for building \nlocal  government  capacity  to  plan  and  deliver  services  in  urban  primary  health  care,  and \nparticipatory  water  management,  as  well  as  rural  development  (including  agriculture).26 In \nparticular,  the  surge  in  global  food  prices  in  2008  underscored  the  continued  need  for \nassistance to enhance the long-term productivity of agriculture. In view of the success of earlier \nprograms, ADB will consider providing further assistance to improve core governance through \nprograms to combat corruption, improve access to justice, and move ahead with civil service \nreform, and to develop the SME sector. Considering the emerging concerns and impact, ADB \nwill also scale up support for enhancing the Government\u2019s preparedness to cope with the effects \nof climate change. To effectively deliver development results, ADB will seek to strengthen \ncooperation with development partners, mobilize greater cofinancing, catalyze private sector \nand civil society involvement in development activities, promote PPPs, further improve portfolio \nperformance, and enhance subregional cooperation. \n \nC.  External Assistance and Development Partner Coordination \n30.  Several development partners27 are supporting effective social service delivery, creating \na more conducive investment climate, and strengthening the PFM system (Appendix 4). \n   \n31.  For implementing the SSNPs, multilateral agencies have focused on providing budgetary \nsupport. The World Bank is expected to provide in the first half of 2010 budgetary support \n(including likely support for SSNPs) to the Government after the NSAPR-II is revised and \napproved and its new Country Assistance Strategy is finalized. The World Bank is financing \nprojects for supporting safety nets and employment creation and also providing assistance for \nextending social care services for persons with disabilities and vulnerable children as a means \nof promoting equity and social inclusion. In addition, the World Bank is supporting a Social \nInvestment Program to improve livelihoods for families affected by cyclone Sidr. The European \nUnion (EU) is financing three social safety net projects. Support from bilateral and United \nNations agencies have focused on food procurement and distribution through a well-coordinated \n                                                 \n26 Reforms in the PFM and service delivery as proposed in the PESF will further strengthen the governance reforms \ninitiated under the ADB. 2007.

Manila.  \n27Bangladesh  has  a  well-functioning  development  partner  coordination  mechanism  in  place  through  a  local \nconsultative group (LCG). The LCG plenary, the apex body of the LCG, is co-chaired by the secretary of the \nEconomic Relations Division, Ministry of Finance (MOF), and the head of a designated development partner \nagency. The LCG meets frequently, at least once every month. It has subgroups for several sectors composed of \nthe representatives of the concerned development partners. ADB coordinates the energy and transport subgroups \nand actively participates in numerous others. The subgroups meet several times a year. In August 2008, 15 \ndevelopment partners signed with Government an agreement to move toward a Joint Cooperation Strategy for \nbetter harmonization and alignment of development partner support, which is under preparation. ", "11 \napproach. The Department for International Development (DFID) of the United Kingdom is \nfunding  a  project  on  Economic  Empowerment  of  the  Poorest  to  improve  their  livelihoods, \nparticularly women and children. The United States Agency for International Development is \nfinancing a Food Assistance Program that provides a safety net for the poor through food and \ncash for work projects. In parallel with the ADB's Emergency Assistance for Food Security \nProject (footnote 25), the World Bank provided budgetary support in response to the food price \ncrisis in 2008. In addition to their regular programs, development partners (including ADB) \nroutinely provide food aid and support for relief and reconstruction following natural disasters.  \n \n32.  For improving the investment climate, DFID and the EU are supporting the activities of \nthe Bangladesh Investment Climate Fund managed by the International Finance Corporation \n(IFC).  The  World  Bank,  DFID,  Canadian  International  Development  Agency,  and  the \nGovernment of Japan (Debt Cancellation Fund) are funding the Private Sector Development \nSupport  Project  aiming  to  improve  Bangladesh\u2019s  investment  climate  by  streamlining  key \nregulations, building capacity of a selected group of government officials, and, as a special \nfocus, developing special economic zones with international standard infrastructure. The South \nAsia  Enterprise  Development  Facility  (SEDF)  is  supported  by  ADB,  EU,  DFID,  IFC,  the \nGovernment of Norway, Canadian International Development Agency, and the Government of \nthe  Netherlands.  The  Investment  Climate  Assessment  component  of  the  SEDF  works  in \npartnership with the development partners to produce comprehensive analytical and diagnostic \nstudies on the overall investment climate and specific elements of the business environment. \nOne  of  the  largest  projects  for  SME  promotion  in  Bangladesh  is  KATALYST  (Developing \nBusiness Service Markets), which aims to improve market access, management and technical \nskills, and production methods.28 KATALYST also identifies key constraints and opportunities in \nsectors and promotes mechanisms that improve business. \n \n33.  In the area of PFM, the Financial Management Reform Project, funded by DFID and the \nGovernment of the Netherlands, and which sought to strengthen PFM capacity of the Ministry of \nFinance (MOF) and selected line ministries, has just been completed (July 2009). A new project \n(2009\u20132014), to be financed through a multi-donor trust fund to be managed by the World Bank, \nis soon expected to be commissioned which will modernize budget management institutions \nwith emphasis on performance orientation in PFM, and improve the effectiveness of the formal \ninstitutions of financial accountability such as the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General \nand relevant parliamentary bodies. The local consultative group (LCG) of development partners \non PFM/Financial Oversight works as a regular forum for coordination, information sharing, and \nliaison with the Government and Parliament on all PFM issues related to budgeting and financial \noversight. Development partners are also supporting the improvement of public expenditure \nsystems, including capacity building for PFM and enhancement of the mechanisms for local \naccountability.  \n \nD.  Rationale \n34.  While Bangladesh's GDP growth is respectable, it is inadequate to make a major dent in \nthe level of poverty within a reasonable time frame. The country needs further economic policy \nmeasures along with institutional reforms to lock in on a higher growth trajectory, which is \nnecessary for accelerated poverty reduction. The lack of fiscal space and weak implementation \ncapacity has further constrained the Government's ability to undertake reforms for spurring \nhigher economic growth and accelerating poverty reduction. At the same time, the Government \n                                                 \n28 KATALYST is funded by DFID, Swiss Development Corporation, Netherlands Development Organization, and \nCanadian International Development Agency. \n ", "12 \n \nneeds additional resources to protect vulnerable groups, mostly women and children through \nappropriate  SSNPs.  The  new  Government  has  shown  the  resolve  to  deal  with  the  twin \nchallenges of accelerating reforms and protecting vulnerable populations through quick and \ntransparent policy actions to preempt hardships and prevent a deeper crisis. The crisis is seen \nby  the  Government  as  an  opportunity  to  undertake  policy  reforms  to  ensure  development \nmomentum well into the future.  \n \n35.  Bangladesh has requested assistance to deal with the impact of the global crisis and \nother exogenous shocks. It has sought additional resources to meet the adjustment costs of \ncontinued  policy  and  institutional  reforms  that  would  help  consolidate  earlier  gains  from \neconomic growth and poverty reduction by scaling up public\u2013private investments in essential \ninfrastructure while also helping to broaden the coverage of SSNPs and eliminating internal \ninstitutional limitations that reduce effectiveness of service delivery. Accordingly, support is \nproposed through two facilities: the PESF and the CSF.  The objective of the  PESF is to \naccelerate  reforms  that  are  essential  for  long-term  economic  growth  while  also  improving \nservice delivery for social protection. The CSF will supplement the PESF by providing support to \nscale up the Government's countercyclical development program.  \n \nIV.  PROPOSED PUBLIC EXPENDITURE SUPPORT FACILITY PROGRAM \n36.  The proposed PESF aims to support the Government to better address the adverse \nimpact on the economy from exogenous shocks as well as inherent weaknesses in economic \nand social service delivery. The Design and Monitoring Framework is in Appendix 1, and the \nDevelopment Policy Letter and the Policy Matrix for the PESF are in Appendix 5. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n37.  The impact of the proposed PESF is to enhance pro-poor and gender-inclusive growth \nand improve the living standards of the vulnerable populations. The outcome of the PESF is a \nstable  macroeconomic  environment  where  private  sector  development  is  emphasized  and \nwhere women and vulnerable populations have greater access to social services, including \nthrough effective gender targeting. \n \nB.  Outputs \n38.  The proposed PESF supports the Government in putting in place policy actions in three \nareas: (i) effective service delivery\u2014by supporting the Government to undertake a significant \nscaling up of SSNPs, effective gender targeting, and legal measures for greater say in ensuring \nquality  and  effectiveness  of  service  delivery;  (ii)  conducive  investment  climate\u2014by \nstrengthening the Government's ability to attract private investment, in particular through PPPs, \nin sectors critical to sustain and accelerate economic growth; and (iii) strengthening the PFM \nsystem\u2014by helping Government to increase fiscal space through enhanced efficiency and \nintegrity in public spending, and higher revenue generation. \n \n39.  The PESF is a culmination of sustained policy dialogue and development coordination \non ongoing social, infrastructure, governance, and financial sector interventions. Anchored in \nthe Government\u2019s medium- and long-term reform strategies for addressing weaknesses and \nvulnerabilities, the design of the proposed PESF benefited from the Government's proactive \nreform stance. The Government, in consultation with ADB, identified specific actions to address \nthe weaknesses and vulnerabilities and made corresponding resource allocations in the FY2010 ", "13 \nbudget. The clear priorities of the Government and the concern over the impact of the global \ncrisis enabled substantial progress on the reforms supported by the PESF.  \n \n1.  More Effective Service Delivery \n40.   Expanded Social Safety Net Programs. Considering Bangladesh's low income level \nand high poverty incidence, as well as its vulnerability to disasters, the Government expanded \nthe existing SSNPs for the vulnerable populations (Appendix 3, Table A3). The total allocation \nfor SSNPs at Tk173.3 billion ($2.5 billion) in FY2010 is a 25.2% increase over FY2009 (paras. \n75 and 77). The number of beneficiaries29 is also expected to increase substantially. The \nGovernment has introduced a new Employment Generation Program for the Hardcore Poor30 \nwith an allocation of Tk11.8 billion ($170 million) for an estimated 4.9 million person-months. \nThe Government will spend at least 60% of the budget allocated to the Employment Generation \nProgram for the Hardcore Poor before release of the second tranche of the PESF. Further, the \nGovernment will finalize an operational plan31 for developing a comprehensive list of hardcore \npoor and other vulnerable populations for more effective targeting of SSNPs. \n \n41.  For ensuring food security, an integral part of SSNPs, the Government has drawn up a \ndetailed  plan  of  action  outlining  strategic  areas  of  intervention,  and  priority  actions  to  be \nundertaken in the short, medium, and long-term during 2008\u20132015. The plan of action identifies \nresponsible  government  and  non-government  agencies  and  defines  policy  targets  and \nindicators for monitoring progress. Aligned with the NSAPR-II, the plan provides guidelines on \ninter-ministerial coordination and sectoral planning and budgeting for effective implementation.  \n \n42.  Gender Targeting. In line with the constitutional requirement for promoting social and \neconomic equality as well as for better targeting of SSNPs, the Government has finalized \ngender  budgeting  guidelines  for  tracking  gender  disaggregated  expenditures  to  inform \nbudgeting decisions and guide policy reform priorities. Further, the budget and beneficiary data \nfor four ministries have been disaggregated on a gender basis and a report on Women's \nAdvancement and Rights in Four Ministries' Activities32 was submitted to the Parliament. The \nGovernment will implement the budgeting guidelines in the 20 line ministries that have adopted \nthe  MTBF  (para.  53)  to  ensure  greater  transparency  and  accountability  of  the  share  of \nexpenditure for women's development.33  \n \n43.  Oversight Opportunities for Vulnerable Groups. The enhancement of the SSNPs and \nintroduction of gender budgeting guidelines will not necessarily ensure that services are being \nprovided effectively. To improve service delivery, the Government has enacted the Right to \nInformation (RTI) Act, 200934 which provides for access to information on public service delivery \n                                                 \n29 Poor people having less than $1 dollar daily income, especially women and destitute workers, who are bypassed \nby the growth process and also miss out on most of the targeted interventions.   \n30 This will replace an earlier '100 days Employment Scheme' which was disbanded due to widespread leaks and \npoor targeting.  \n31 The Government intends to utilize the National Identity Cards, prepared for the 2008 elections, and link them with \nthe database of the MOF and with the lists of SSNP beneficiaries.  \n32 The report reviews how issues of women's advancement have been dealt with as well as the decision making \nstructure from a gender perspective by analyzing the employment structure and salary distributions in the ministries \nfor education, health and family welfare, social welfare, and food and disaster management. \n33 The gender budgeting guidelines have a specific section on poverty and gender impact to be adhered to by the \nministries that are using the MTBF. \n34 ADB's Good Governance Program (footnote 17) had provided assistance to the Government to prepare the act, \nand has also set aside resources to support its implementation. The RTI Act is part of the broader perspective on \ngood governance being taken by Government as contained in the National Integrity Strategy that it is developing. \n ", "14 \n \nto ensure proper accountability of local officials. The RTI law became effective from 1 July 2009 \nwith the appointment of the Chairman and two Commissioners of the Information Commission \nalong  with  provision  of  a  new  office  and  some  staff.  The  organization  structure  of  the \nInformation Commission will be approved by the Government, and operational staff appointed. \nIn addition, the Government, with the assistance of the United Nations Development Program, \nwill  develop  an  action plan  to  put  in  place  a  citizen's charter35 for  public sector  agencies \nincluding its dissemination across the country for improving service delivery and implementation. \n \n44.  In  addition  to  the  RTI  Act,  the  Government  also  enacted  the  Consumers'  Right \nProtection Act, 200936 for enhancing the quality of services. The Consumers' Right Protection \nAct, which became effective in April 2009, aims to protect the rights of consumers and prevent \nactivities that interfere with consumer rights. To implement the act, a National Consumers' Right \nProtection Council will be established with financing provided from the block allocations in the \nFY2010 budget. The National Consumers' Right Protection Council will undertake elaborate \npublicity and awareness building campaigns through print and electronic media, and by holding \nseminars, workshops, and symposiums.37  \n \n2.  More Conducive Investment Climate \n45.  Private  Sector  Development  and  Public\u2013Private  Partnerships. Mainstreaming \nPPPs has emerged as a key Government priority for bridging infrastructure gaps across all the \neconomic sectors. Drawing lessons from international best practices, the Government has taken \na comprehensive approach for implementing PPPs that covers (i) a position paper on PPPs for \ninvestment and operations; (ii) allocation of funds for a viability gap fund38 for enhancing the \nbankability of projects, attracting private capital, and catalyzing private sector efficiencies; (iii) \nallocation of funds for a technical assistance fund for financing PPP project preparation activities \nsuch as feasibility studies; and (iv) allocation of funds for a PPP infrastructure investment fund \nto finance bankable PPP projects on a loan or equity basis.  \n \n46.  Going forward, the Government will revise and reissue the 2004 PSIG to place a concise, \ntransparent and strong legal and institutional framework for PPPs. In addition, a PPP Cell will be \nestablished and operationalized for coordinating the mainstreaming of PPPs. The progress of \nPPPs in infrastructure in Bangladesh, including the legal and institutional frameworks, will be \nmonitored and assessed and review reports posted on the MOF website.  \n \n47.  Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise and Housing Sector Development. Harnessing \nthe SME sector's potential for creating jobs and providing greater access to housing is both an \nimmediate priority as well as fundamental for setting the basis for higher long-term growth.39 \nAccordingly, the Government has raised the size of allocations from TK8.0 billion ($116 million) \nto Tk11 billion ($159 million) to its Small and Medium Enterprises Fund and Housing Fund \nmaintained with the central bank. In addition, during the PESF, the Government will prepare an \n                                                 \n35 In May 2007, the Government instructed all ministries and agencies to formulate a \"citizen's charter\" that includes \nthe duties and responsibilities of officials along with their telephone numbers to be displayed including on the web. \n36 The scope of the act covers price, quality, weight, and availability of, and access to goods and services. The \nnational council and the district committees under it will create awareness about consumers' rights, and supervise \nthe activities of enterprises selling goods or rendering services with the objective of protecting consumers' rights. \n37 Supplementary Appendix E provides summary of the laws enacted as part of the PESF.   \n38 This support is especially important for sectors where financial rates of returns are low but social returns are high.  \n39 Because of higher employment-intensity and lower capital requirement, the expansion of the SME Fund is \nexpected to boost the SME sector, create more job opportunities, and raise domestic demand by increasing the \npurchasing power of households. This will add stimulus to the economy through the linkage effects to other \ndomestic sectors, and create jobs. ", "15 \naction  plan  to  support  SME  centers,  women's  entrepreneurship,  and  one-stop  facility  for \nenterprises. The Government will also merge two state-owned banks, Bangladesh Shilpa Bank \nand Bangladesh Shilpa Rin Shangstha, for streamlining their operations and enhancing SME \nfinancing.  \n \n48.  Enhanced Business Environment. Bridging the major investment gap, especially in \ninfrastructure,  requires  significant  foreign  direct  investment.  Bangladesh's  approval  of  the \nMoney  Laundering  Prevention  Act  in  February  2009  demonstrates  the  Government's \ncommitment to transparency and good governance and is likely to enhance investor confidence. \nThe Act equips the Anti Corruption Commission and Bangladesh Bank with powers to deal with \noffences  related  to  money  laundering.  The  Government  has  established  the  Bangladesh \nInstitute of Capital Markets to foster a policy environment and institutional structure necessary \nfor growth and development of the domestic capital market. The Government has also extended \nmerchant banking facilities to three state-owned commercial banks to increase trading volumes \nin the capital market.  \n \n3.  Strengthened Public Financial Management  \n49.  Public  Sector  Efficiency  and  Revenue  Mobilization.  A  strong  PFM  system\u2014\nespecially where the state takes on a considerable role to provide services\u2014relies substantially \non prioritizing expenditures and enhancing revenues. The Government has taken major steps in \npursuit  of  its  policy  for  corporatizing  public  sector  enterprises  to  improve  service  delivery, \nviability, efficiency, and competitiveness, and to reduce subsidies. Specifically, the Government \nhas (i) divested 30% of its shares of Jamuna Oil and Meghna Oil for subscription by the general \npublic; (ii) converted the national air carrier Bangladesh Biman into a limited liability company \nunder the Company Act through the Bangladesh Biman Corporation (Amendment) Act, 2009; \nand  (iii)  converted  the  Bangladesh  Telegraph  and  Telephone  Board  into  a  limited  liability \ncompany  under  the  Company  Act  through  Bangladesh  Telegraph  and  Telephone  Board \n(Amendment) Act, 2009. \n \n50.  Along with divestments and corporatization, the Government has amended the Income \nTax Ordinance, 1984, to streamline income tax administration, simplify tax collection procedures, \nand introduce revenue-enhancing and rationalization measures. As a step toward phasing out \nthe tax holiday schemes by 2012, a reduced tax rate for certain sectors40 has been introduced \nto gradually prepare them to shoulder a normal tax burden. With regard to administrative \narrangements, the appointment of the chairman of the National Board of Revenue (NBR) has \nbeen  streamlined  through  the  National  Board  of  Revenue  (Amendment)  Act,  2009.41 The \nGovernment has also implemented a debt service liability management system for keeping \nmore accurate records and improving transparency of liabilities resulting from borrowings by \nstate-owned enterprises. During the PESF, the Government will finalize plans to expand the tax \nbase by identifying new taxpayers through surveys covering city, district, and sub-district levels. \nThe Government will also improve the incentive structure for civil servants by implementing the \nrecommendations of the Pay Commission.  \n \n                                                 \n40 These are for sectors such as agro-processing, rubber-based goods, textile industries and machinery, spinning \nindustries, and garments-producing industries. \n41 Earlier, the provision was to appoint one of the members of the Board as the NBR chairman. In practice, a \nsecretary to the Government is always  appointed as  the NBR chairman. The National Board  of Revenue \n(Amendment) Act, 2009 provides for appointment of a secretary to the Government as chairman of the NBR and \nremoves the anomaly and legal contradiction. \n ", "16 \n \n51.  Streamlined Financial Management Processes. As part of the efforts to streamline the \nfinancial management process and enhance transparency, the web-based Integrated Budget \nand Accounting System for facilitating daily consolidation of accounting data has been extended \nto 58 districts to make it easier to share on-line information for budgeting and accounting \npurposes.42 In this context, the Government will issue policy directives and prepare an action \nplan to improve the quality and timely submission of the annual accounts of the government \nagencies.43  \n \n52.  Slow implementation of public sector investment projects is a major factor hindering \ninfrastructure development in the country. Recognizing this, the Government will review and \nrevise public sector project approval procedures to bring greater dynamism and speed in project \nprocessing. The Government will also set up a high level task force to enhance monitoring of \nmajor public sector projects covered by the ADP. The aim is to improve project implementation \nthrough more intensive monitoring, closer scrutiny, and regular supervision (para. 80).  \n \n53.  Mainstreaming  Medium-Term  Budgetary  Framework.  The  Government  is \nmainstreaming the MTBF for integrating revenue and development budgets and strengthening \nthe link between the national poverty reduction strategy and annual budgets. The application of \nthe MTBF in 20 ministries during FY2010 is intended to strengthen fiscal management and the \nflexibility and capacity of the line ministries to manage resource allocation. The Government will \nestablish a planning and budget wing in at least five ministries where the MTBF has been \nadopted to ensure dedicated staff and developing adequate capacity for its implementation. \nFurther, as an initial step toward a decentralized budget, the Government will finalize plans to \npresent  a  district-wise  budget  starting  with  one  district  per  administrative  division. \nComplementing these measures, the NSAPR-II is being revised to embody the development \npriorities of the Government. The Government has also established a Macroeconomic Wing in \nthe Finance Division headed by a full time joint secretary and supported by a number of \nqualified  staff  for  enabling  the  MOF  to  deal  with  evolving  macroeconomic  developments \npreemptively.  \n \nC.  Important Features  \n54.  The most important feature of the proposed PESF is its human and gender dimensions, \nBy undertaking actions to mitigate the social impact of the crisis, and protect as well as enhance \ninvestments in human capital, it broadens support for reforms. The PESF builds on the political \ncommitment of the Government to bring about necessary economic reforms in the country. The \nreforms  reflect  the  continuum  of  policy  actions  and  ADB  engagement  in  the  sectors  and \nsubsectors which are proposed to be supported. The PESF is (i) based on Government's \nstrategy for poverty reduction, (iii) aligned to the outcomes sought from other ADB programs, \nand (iii) fully consistent with the interventions of other development partners.  \n \n55.  Good  governance,  one  of  the  drivers  of  change  under  ADB's  Strategy  2020,  is \nintegrated in the design of the PESF through measures for creating access to information for \nimprovement of service delivery, protection of citizens' rights, effective gender budgeting, and \nenhancing PFM. The PESF also facilitates private sector development, which is the first driver \nof change under ADB's Strategy 2020. Corporatization and divestment will enable more \nspace  for  private  sector  participation  in  industry,  infrastructure,  and  service  delivery. \n                                                 \n42 The network will be expanded to Upazila (sub-district) accounts offices during the next phase of PFM reform.   \n43 There is no legal deadline for submitting the Annual Finance and Appropriation Accounts to Parliament. Delays in \ngetting certification from the Office of Comptroller and Auditor General on these accounts lead to a considerable \ndelay in the publication and submission of these documents to Parliament. ", "17 \nGreater  fiscal  space  will  enable  the  Government  to  allocate  more  resources  to  much-\nneeded social and economic infrastructure, which, in turn, provides more opportunities for \nthe private sector. \n \nD.  Program Cost \n \n56.  The PESF reflects the development financing needs of the Government as specified in \nthe  FY2010  budget  (Table  2).  The  Government  aims  to  increase  development  and  social \nspending in FY2010 given the stress imposed on the economy (and especially the vulnerable \ngroups) by the global crisis and natural disasters. Given this need for additional funding, a \nbudget deficit of 5.0% of GDP is targeted for FY2010.  \n \nTable 2: Gap and Borrowing in Overall Budget for FY2010 \n($ million) \nItem  Sub-total Total \nDomestic revenue  11,506   \nForeign grants  743  \n  Total revenue 12,249 \n   \n  Expenditure 16,481 \n  Resource gap 4,232 \nTo be covered by:   \nForeign borrowing  1,256   \nDomestic borrowing  2,976   \n    4,232 \n    Source: Government of Bangladesh FY2010 Budget. \n \n57.  The PESF only meets a fraction of the related adjustment costs (Appendix 6). A detailed \nbreakdown of ADB support for SSNPs through the PESF is in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \nE.  Financing Plan \n58.  The Government has requested a program loan of $244.85 million from ADB for the \nPESF which consists of:  \n \n(i)  $100 million loan from ADB's Ordinary Capital Resources (OCR). The loan will \nhave  a  15-year  term  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  an  interest  rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions as \nset forth in the draft Loan Agreement. The Government has provided ADB with (i) \nthe reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility \non the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these \nchoices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. \n \n(ii)  $100 million loan from ADB\u2019s special funds resources, which will have a fixed \nterm of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; interest will be at 1.0% per \nyear during the grace period and 1.5% per year thereafter (ADF soft term). \n \n(iii)  $44.85 million loan from ADB's special funds resources, which will have a fixed \nterm of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; interest will be at 1.6% per \nyear for the life of the loan (ADF hard term).  \n ", "18 \n \nF.

PROPOSED COUNTERCYCLICAL SUPPORT FACILITY SUPPORT PROGRAM \nA.  Country Context under the Global Economic Crisis44  \n60.  Despite numerous external and domestic shocks, Bangladesh\u2019s economic performance \nhas been sound in recent years. Gains have been made on the macroeconomic front and social \nsector development including on poverty alleviation. Real economic growth has been sustained \nat above 6%, inflation ranged between 6.5\u20137.2% except during the commodity price shocks of \n2008, and the external current account balance has been consistently in surplus due to buoyant \nexport and remittance inflows. Gains on social indicators have also been impressive although \nmuch remains to be done with 40% of the population still below the poverty line. \n \n61.  Such strong macroeconomic performance is the outcome of a long track record of \nprudent demand management policies of successive governments. By limiting the level of the  \nfiscal deficit in relation to GDP to well below the level considered debt-stabilizing, both the debt-\nto-GDP  and  debt  service  ratios  have  declined  significantly  over  time  and  are  currently  at \nreasonably low levels. Sound macroeconomic management has also enabled the country to \nwithstand major external shocks while sustaining its growth momentum. The economy was \nseverely tested in FY2008 when it experienced repeat floods and the catastrophic cyclone Sidr, \nwith major loss of life and destruction of property and crops; and the external shock resulting \nfrom surging petroleum and other commodity prices.  \n \n62.  The economy had rebounded strongly from these shocks, and gained further momentum \nin the first quarter of FY2009 (July\u2013September 2008) before the impact of the global crisis set in. \nExport receipts grew by 42.4%, import payments rose by 34.9%, workers\u2019 remittances surged \nby  43.5%,  private  sector  credit  expanded  rapidly  (26.5%),  and  firms  were  in  the  midst  of \nexpanding their production capacity. The overall bullish environment was also reflected in the \nindex of manufacturing, which grew by more than 12% and term lending for investment, which \ngrew by 30%. \n                                                 \n44 In reviewing the country\u2019s macroeconomic policies and public finances, the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) \nlatest Article IV consultations were referred to. The latest IMF consultations with the Bangladesh authorities were \nheld in September 2008. ", "19 \n63.  Up to the end of the first quarter of FY2009, all indicators were pointing to a robust \nmacroeconomic  outlook  for  FY2010  with  higher  economic  growth,  and  with  moderate \ninflationary  pressure  due  to  exogenous  price  shocks  as  the  only  major  challenge  for  the \nGovernment. Its intensified efforts to boost agricultural output were also paying dividends with \nsuccessive bumper rice crops. Bangladeshi textile exporters had their order books full and were \nlooking forward to brisk business. At the start of the global crisis, there was a general perception \nthat Bangladesh would be largely spared given its limited linkages with the global capital market. \nHowever, as the crisis deepened, its impact started to be felt in Bangladesh as well. \n \n64.  Key Transmission Channels: First Round Effects. The direct impact of the crisis on \nBangladesh economy could primarily be felt through three channels: financial sector contagion; \nforeign  trade;  and  workers\u2019  remittances,  with  the  extent  of  transmission  depending  on the \nlinkage and exposure of the sector in question to the rest of the world. \n \n1.  Financial Sector Contagion \n65.  Bangladesh\u2019s financial sector did not experience any turbulence from the meltdown in \nthe global financial sector because of its limited connectivity with the international financial \nsystem. Extensive capital controls, strict guidelines on the net foreign exposure of Bangladeshi \nfinancial  institutions,  and  controls  on  the  quality  and  types  of  investments  that  financial \ninstitutions are allowed to make limited the exposure of Bangladeshi financial institutions and \ntheir potential losses, particularly to toxic mortgage\u2013based assets. The prompt steps taken by \nBangladesh Bank by asking all domestic financial institutions to deposit their foreign assets with \nit and converting them into safe assets helped minimize any loss from the collapse of many \ninternational financial institutions. These developments notwithstanding, because of the sharp \nmovements in exchange rates among major currencies, Bangladesh Bank had to incur a sizable \nvaluation loss in its holdings of foreign assets.  \n \n66.  The stock market in Bangladesh suffered only moderate losses relative to its global \ncounterparts. At the peak of the global financial meltdown when major stock markets lost almost \none-third to one-half of their market capitalization, the Dhaka Stock Exchange remained largely \nunaffected. This was attributable to many factors, including (i) foreign investment in the stock \nmarket was estimated to be only about 3%, and because of small exposure, its impact on the \ndomestic market was minimal; and (ii) the real estate sector in Bangladesh is not leveraged and \ndid not experience any softening in prices, despite the unprecedented appreciations (250%\u2013\n350%) in property values in recent years. \n \n67.  Since the financial sector in Bangladesh, dominated by commercial banks, was not \ndirectly affected by the crisis abroad, there was no liquidity and financial crisis in the domestic \neconomy. Deposit growth and credit demand both remained healthy and asset quality was not \nadversely affected by the first round impact of the crisis. There was also no visible adverse \nimpact on the availability of trade financing for Bangladeshi exporters and importers. \n \n2.  Foreign Trade \n68.  After a very strong first quarter of FY2009, exports slowed down markedly. Almost all \ncategories of exports registered a sharp slowdown (such as for readymade garments and \nknitwear) or a sharp decline (for almost all non-garment exports). The extent of the fall in export \ngrowth and the speed of the fall were unprecedented in Bangladesh, and can only be explained \nby the external demand and price developments promoted by the crisis. \n ", "20 \n \n69.  The growth in exports decelerated sharply after October 2008 with the beginning of the \neconomic crisis in the industrial countries (the major destinations of Bangladeshi exports) when \nall categories of exports started to fall significantly. From October 2008 to June 2009 (the last \nthree quarters of FY2009), year-on-year export growth was only 1.4%, a major drop from the \n23.7%  growth  in  the  corresponding  period  in  FY2008.  Three-fourths  of  the  shortfall  is \nattributable to textile products and other export categories, while all other important export \ncategories also recorded significant shortfalls. Based on the export performance since October \n2008, significant slowdown in export growth is expected in FY2010. \n \n3.  Workers' Remittances \n70.  The flow of workers\u2019 remittances, while still growing in dollar terms, is decelerating \nrapidly and the number of workers going abroad has declined sharply. Growth of workers\u2019 \nremittances slowed to 15.5% during January to June 2009, down from 43.5% growth recorded \nin the first quarter of FY2009. In March and April 2009, the growth rates in remittances were \n9.5% and 7.6%, respectively. Although the growth rates in May and June picked up to 22.6% \nand 22.0% respectively, the growth rate fell again to 8.0% in July 2009.  \n \n71.  The monthly rate of overseas worker departures declined from almost 92,000 in January \n2008 to 38,568 in June 2009. Much of the rise in the growth of workers going abroad during \n2007\u20132008 originated from the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries following the oil price \nsurge. The decline in the number of workers going abroad in recent months has also originated \nfrom the GCC countries in the aftermath of the decline in oil prices due to the global recession. \nCutbacks and postponement of investment plans in the GCC countries have contributed to this \nreduction in labor demand. The growth of remittances, which still continues, is attributable to the \nlagged effect of the large number of workers who left the country up to October/November 2008. \nGenerally, it takes several months before the workers start remitting money. After accounting for \nthis lag, the growth rate of remittances is expected to decline further in the coming months.  \n \n72.  Second Round Effects of the Crisis. The adverse impact of the marked slowdown in \nexport and remittance growth is spreading to the broader domestic economy. Exports and \nremittances have been important factors contributing to domestic growth. Millions of ordinary \nBangladeshi households across the country are direct beneficiaries of remittance inflows and a \nlarge part of domestic demand expansion also depends on such inflows. Manufacturing sector \nperformance is significantly dependent on export sector developments and thus on the health of \nthe global economy. With global economic activity likely to be in difficulty in the first half of \nFY2010 before moving to a recovery phase, both domestic and foreign demand for Bangladeshi \nproducts is expected to remain subdued due to slower growth in remittance inflows and lower \ndemand  for  exports  leading  to  slower  manufacturing  growth.  The  uncertainties  about  the \neconomic outlook created by the global crisis have contributed to slower private investment. \nEven firms, which are expanding their volume of production, are postponing or delaying their \ninvestment programs in order to ride out the slowdown in the global economy. Reflecting this \nsentiment, demand for industrial term loans fell by 9.6% during July\u2013March FY2009 compared \nwith a 66% rise recorded in the corresponding period of the preceding fiscal year. \n \n73.  The Government is also facing a significant tax revenue shortfall compared with the \ntarget because of lower imports and slower domestic activity. The revenue performance was in \nsurplus relative to target during the first quarter of FY2009 but, thereafter, sharply turned into a \ngrowing shortfall. The shortfall in tax revenue, primarily from import-based taxes, was more than \nTk20 billion ($290 million) in FY2009. After achieving record growth in tax revenue in FY2008 ", "21 \n(27.4%),45 the Government set the tax revenue target at Tk545 billion ($7.9 billion) for FY2009. \nAt that time, it was envisaged that the targeted revenue growth of 15.5% was not ambitious \ncompared with recent performance. The actual revenue growth in FY2009 was 10.7%, down \nfrom 27.4% in FY2008. All major taxes recorded sluggish growth after September 2008.  \n \nB.  Government\u2019s Countercyclical Development Program and Capacity Assessment \n74.  In April 2009, the Government announced a fiscal stimulus package for Tk34.2 billion \n($495 million) to support the sectors adversely affected by the global meltdown. Cash incentives, \nconsisting primarily of direct transfers to exporters, were raised for sectors like leather, jute, and \nfrozen foods. The total allocation for the export sectors was Tk4.5 billion ($65 million). The \npackage also allowed for greater flexibility in repayment of bank loans for all manufacturing \nexporters. Allocations under various special refinancing schemes were also raised for SMEs \nand the housing industry, while larger allocations were made for agriculture, power, and SSNPs. \n \n75.  Policy  Responses  through  the  Budget.  The  Government's  countercyclical \ndevelopment program announced through the FY2010 budget has four broad components: (i) a \nfiscal stimulus package; (ii) an expansion of the SSNPs; (iii) a substantial increase in the ADP; \nand  (iv)  introduction  of  a  new  PPP  scheme.  In  selecting  these  components  and  making \ncorresponding resource allocations in the FY2010 budget, the Government in consultation with \nADB  focused  on  measures  that  mitigate  the social  impact  of  the crisis and  help  catalyze \neconomic  recovery  and  long-term  growth.  The  Government  expects  these  measures  to \ncontribute  significantly  in  offsetting  the  effects  of  the  global  recession  on  the  Bangladesh \neconomy.  \n \nTable 4: Government's Countercyclical Development Program \n ($ million) \n    FY2010  FY2009  % Increase \nFiscal Stimulus Package  724  495        46.3% \nSocial Safety Net Programs  2,509  2,005        25.2% \nAnnual Development Program  4,416  3,330        32.6% \nPublic\u2013Private Partnership  362  0  Introduced in FY2010 \n           Source: Government of Bangladesh  \n \n76.  The  Government  has  announced  that  it  will  continue  the  fiscal  stimulus  package \nannounced in April 2009 (para. 74) through FY2010 and expand the package further based on \nhow the situation evolves. The Tk50 billion ($724 million) fund established in the FY2010 budget \nwill allow the Government to have the required flexibility to respond in a timely manner to the \nproblems  faced  by  different  sectors.  The  cash  incentives  announced  in  the  first  stimulus \npackage will also continue and the funds will be disbursed in six-monthly installments through \nBangladesh Bank. Roughly one-third of the new FY2010 fiscal stimulus allocation is earmarked \nfor the export sector to offset the effects of the global recession on export items such as textiles, \nfrozen foods, leather goods and certain other items. The power sector is also expected to get a \nsubstantial part of the fiscal stimulus package, in addition to agriculture. The Government has \nalso announced measures to reduce the tax burden on certain export items.  \n \n77.  Consistent with the Government\u2019s political commitment to alleviate poverty, about 15.2% \nof the total non-development and development budget (2.5% of GDP) has been allocated for \nSSNPs.  The  existing  SSNPs  have  been  strengthened  and  some  new  ones  introduced \n                                                 \n45 The stronger revenue collection was due to tax revenue collected by the NBR, which accounts for over 95% of tax \nrevenues, and over 78% of total revenues. \n ", "22 \n \n(Appendix  3).  The  major  components  of  the  SSNPs  include  cash  transfers,  food  security, \nmicrocredit, employment generation, and stipends for students. In addition, the enhanced ADP \nand new PPP scheme, if implemented fully, would amount to a 44% ($1.45 billion) rise in \ngovernment capital spending in FY2010. In addition to boosting domestic activity, if executed \neffectively,  the  additional  spending  through  the  ADP  and  PPPs  would  help  bridge  the \ninfrastructure gap and contribute to future growth.  \n \n78.  Capacity  Assessment.  The  Bangladesh  authorities  have  a  long  experience  in \nadministering SSNPs and the ADP. However, implementation has been less than effective due \nto a number of factors including governance, capacity, and monitoring.  \n \n79.  During the last two decades, the Government has been pursuing a number of SSNPs. \nSSNPs  are  mainly  administered  through  the  Ministry  of  Food  and  Disaster  Management, \nMinistry of Social Welfare, and the Ministry of Women and Children\u2019s Affairs. Many SSNPs are \nimplemented in collaboration with nongovernmental organizations and are often cofinanced by \ndevelopment  partners  (para.  31). Greater  attention  is  needed  to  (i)  increase  the  focus  on \nprograms that contribute to human capital development, (ii) reduce the impact of seasonality in \nthe availability of work, (iii) increase the focus on the urban poor, and (iv) increase the focus on \nother disadvantaged groups. For reducing leakages and improving targeting, implementation \ncapacity at the level of local administration and agencies needs to be enhanced, oversight of \nproject execution needs to be improved and transparency about entitlements needs to be \nensured (paras. 40-44). The Government is aware that greater emphasis on external monitoring, \nas well as building monitoring capacity of the line agencies, is needed to minimize leakages and \nit has taken steps to address these issues. \n \n80.\u00a0 Implementing  the  infrastructure  components  of  the  Government\u2019s  countercyclical \ndevelopment program will also be a challenge. In recent years, ADP implementation has been \nmuch lower than target. The size of the ADP has declined by half in relation to GDP over the \nyears. A review of the last five fiscal years\u2019 actual ADP spending against the budget targets \nsuggests an average shortfall of 15% in ADP implementation. The key factors contributing to the \nunsatisfactory ADP implementation are: (i) inadequate capacity of the implementing agencies; \nand (ii) a lack of proper monitoring of these agencies. Because of these and other constraining \nfactors, ADP utilization has failed to grow in line with the growing needs of the economy. The \nefficiency of the government implementation ministries and agencies needs to be enhanced by \nstrengthening their administrative capacity and accountability. Close monitoring of the agencies \nimplementing the ADP program would be needed for reaching the target level (para. 52).  \n \n81.  The Government is fully aware of the implementation challenges due to the ambitious \nsize of the ADP, and is adopting the following approach to accelerate implementation: \n \n(i)  reforming the time consuming and complex project approval process; \n(ii)  emphasizing preparation of procurement plans earlier in the fiscal year; \n(iii)  paying greater attention to the efficiency of project directors, given their crucial \nrole in project implementation; \n(iv)  bringing the 10 ministries, which implement 78% of the ADP, under special and \nintensive monitoring arrangement; and \n(v)  monitoring  the  major  projects  through  critical  path  method  process  by \nestablishing a task force.  \n \n82.  The authorities, under the chairmanship of the minister for planning, have been regularly \nreviewing project preparation in ministries. Ministries and line agencies have been instructed to ", "23 \nstart  preparing  the  development  project  proposal  (government  project  document)  from  the \nbeginning of the fiscal year, prepare procurement plans within the first two months of the fiscal \nyear, and prepare tender documents alongside the preparation of the development project \nproposal. Secretaries of development ministries are regularly following up on project preparation \nto ensure that projects are ready for approval on time. Policy actions on improving service \ndelivery, creating a more favorable investment climate, and strengthening PFM will also help \nimplement the countercyclical development program. \n \nC.  Poverty Impact  \n83.  The adverse impact in the export sector will affect poverty through job losses and wage \ncuts (para.12, Appendixes 3 and 11, and Supplementary Appendix C). With more than 2.2 \nmillion workers directly engaged in the ready-made garments sector, and an equal number of \nworkers employed in ancillary activities, the slowdown in the ready-made garments sector will \ntranslate into widespread poverty both in urban and rural areas. The slowdown in income \ngrowth will hit the existing poor the hardest. This group consists of a variety of vulnerable \ngroups, mostly the old, children, and women. SMEs are also disproportionately vulnerable to the \nglobal economic crisis, which has potentially huge poverty implications.  \n \n84.  The slowdown in growth of remittances will cause hardship for the recipient households \nand deepen poverty. For many households in rural areas, remittance earnings are the main \nsource of income and livelihood. A fall in remittance income will directly affect consumption and \nthe nutritional status of a large number of families in rural areas and have effects on overall \npoverty incidence. The fall in the number of workers leaving for overseas jobs will create \npressure on the already slack domestic job market and the rise in the number of workers \nreturning home after losing jobs, who often sell their land and other belongings to buy job \ncontracts and pay for air tickets, could mean additional people slipping into poverty. \n \nD.  Impact, Scope, and Coverage  \n85.  The impact of the CSF is to contribute to Government's efforts to achieve higher growth \nand improve living standards given the country's exposure to external shocks. The objective of \nthe  CSF  is  to  help  the  Government  implement  its  countercyclical  development  program \nannounced in the FY2010 budget for coping with the effects of the global crisis. The outcome of \nthe proposed CSF is macroeconomic stability, higher public and private investment, and greater \naccess to social services by women and vulnerable populations. \n \n86.  The CSF loan will directly contribute to implementing the expanded SSNPs to cushion \nthe impact of the global economic crisis on the poor and vulnerable. Implementing the expanded \nSSNPs will serve the twin functions of immediately addressing the needs of the poor and \nvulnerable affected by the global crisis through income and food support, and also providing \nstrong stimulus to growth, as such spending will directly raise aggregate demand. This, in turn, \nwill free up fiscal space for financing the other components of the Government's countercyclical \ndevelopment program\u2014in particular, the planned scaling up of infrastructure investment, so that \nefforts to enhance longer-term growth potential or macroeconomic stability are not compromised. \nThe Design and Monitoring Framework is in Appendix 2 and the Development Policy Letter and \nthe Access Criteria are in Appendix 7. \n \n \n \n \n ", "24 \n \nE.  Financing Plan  \n87.  The Government has requested a loan of $500,000,000 under the CSF from ADB's OCR. \nThe  loan  will  have  a  5-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years;  an  interest  rate \ndetermined in accordance with ADB's London interbank-offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility plus 200 basis points, commitment charge of 75 basis points on undisbursed loan \nbalance, and such terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth \nin the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board. The Government has provided ADB with (i) \nthe reasons for its decision to borrow under the ADB's LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis \nof  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices  were  its  own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB.  \n \nF.  Implementation Period  \n88.  The CSF loan will be implemented during October 2009 to December 2010. \n \nG.  Justification and Estimate of Resource Requirements  \n89.  Bangladesh has a strong case for accessing the CSF and is in full compliance with the \naccess criteria (Appendix 7, Supplementary Appendix G). Bangladesh is experiencing a sharp \nslowdown in exports and remittances and slower economic growth. The country is also facing \nfiscal constraints as the growth in revenue collection is decelerating. In addition, Bangladesh is \nstill very poor and is vulnerable to natural disasters. It is also affected by an economic crisis not of \nits making. Further, as a developing member country with access to blend resources from ADB, \nBangladesh is not able to access the additional $400 million in ADF resources being provided in \nthe context of the crisis. The need for enhanced financial support from external sources to carry \nout  the  countercyclical  development  program  is  also  underlined  by  (i)  the  likely  revenue \nshortfalls, (ii) crowding out concerns of the private sector, and (iii) securing external financial \nassurance for the budget. The proposed CSF will not have any significant negative impact on \ndebt sustainability. The estimated resource requirement is in Table 2. \n \n90.  Likely Revenue Shortfalls. In the coming fiscal year, when the Government needs a \nlarge amount of revenue to finance its spending plans, revenue potential will be constrained by \nsubdued growth in taxes due to lower import prices and the effect of slower economic growth \n(as has already happened in FY2009). Furthermore, domestic demand would also be less \nbuoyant because of slower growth in remittance inflows. Thus, while the budget targets a 15% \ngrowth in revenue, this is not expected to be more than 10\u201312% even with some additional \nrevenue measures.  \n \n91.  Crowding Out Concerns of the Private Sector. Because of the lack of depth in the \nfinancial system, non-inflationary domestic financing of the fiscal deficit is difficult. Due to the \nrelatively narrow base of the financial sector\u2014with a very low financial assets-to-GDP ratio\u2014the \nGovernment is significantly constrained by its reliance on domestic financing of the budget. \nTraditionally,  this  problem  has  been  addressed  through  recourse  to  reliance  on  external \nfinancing. In this fiscal year, owing to the larger size of the deficit, the dependence on both \ndomestic and foreign financing will be correspondingly higher. \n \n92.  The Government's spending plans to overcome the global crisis, combined with an \noptimistic revenue target, have accentuated the risk for the budget deficit to exceed the 5% of \nGDP target leading to a correspondingly higher borrowing requirement. Larger deficit financing \nfrom the banking system than envisaged in the budget would seriously limit the availability of ", "25 \ncredit for the private sector. Nevertheless, in the event of a significant shortfall in external \nfinancing, the Government would be forced to curtail its spending plans or resort to more \ndomestic borrowing. The average historical level of external borrowing amounting to $1.8 billion \nper year would lead to a correspondingly higher government borrowing requirement from the \nbanking system. Borrowing of this magnitude is not possible without sharply reducing private \nsector borrowing from the banking system. The proposed financing through the CSF will reduce \nthe  potential  crowding  out  of  the  domestic  private  sector  credit  by  reducing  government \nborrowing by an equivalent amount. A disbursement of $500 million under the CSF will reduce \nbank financing requirement of the Government by an equivalent amount thus allowing for a \nhealthy flow of credit to the private sector.  \n \n93.  Securing  External  Financial  Assurance  for  the  Budget.  The  FY2010  budget \nenvisages Tk35 billion ($500 million) as special support/credit for development. The authorities \nexpect to secure this amount from development partners as budget support. Discussions are \nunderway with the World Bank although the availability of these resources will have to await the \nWorld Bank-International Monetary Fund (IMF) Joint Staff Assessment of the NSAPR-II (to be \nfinalized) and approval of the World Bank\u2019s country assistance strategy. The CSF would help \nthe authorities partly offset any potential shortfall in revenue and reduce Government\u2019s recourse \nto domestic bank financing. \n \n94.  Debt Sustainability. As macroeconomic management in Bangladesh has always been \nprudent, the intended increase in borrowing under the CSF will not have any significant impact \non debt sustainability. The IMF's debt sustainability analysis (DSA) indicates that Bangladesh\u2019s \nprimary deficit has always been less than what is required for stabilizing public debt in relation to \nGDP and that performance is expected to hold in the future, pointing to a steady decline in the \ndebt-to-GDP ratio from 42.9% in FY2008 to 33% by FY2028. These conclusions are also \nsupported by the analysis done by ADB (Appendix 8) using assumptions broadly consistent with \nthose underlying the IMF's DSA. The proposed CSF financing will not have any adverse impact \non the overall public debt level, since it will only change the composition of public debt. The \nexternal component of public debt will go up by $500 million, while the domestic borrowing \nrequirement and consequently domestic debt will be lower by an equivalent amount.  \n \n95.  The change in the composition of public debt in favor of external debt may also have a \nfavorable impact in two important ways. First, interest payments on external debt would be less \nthan the interest payments on borrowing from domestic sources by issuing debt of equivalent \nmaturity. The interest rate on 5-year domestic debt instruments is 12.5% while the rate of \ninterest payable on CSF borrowing would at most be between 5\u20136% (assuming a 5-year swap \nrate). Although there could be costs associated with exchange rate movements, the spread \nbetween the domestic interest rate and the CSF borrowing rate is wide enough to make it much \nless costly to borrow from ADB. Second, by allowing more credit to flow to the private sector \nand also facilitating capital spending, the CSF would facilitate more effective execution of the \ncountercyclical  development  program  and  thereby  boost  domestic  activity.  Such  positive \neconomic impacts would also enhance the public sector\u2019s capacity to service debt. \n \n96.  Servicing of external debt, however, will increase. But given Bangladesh\u2019s low and \ndeclining external debt service ratio, comfortable and growing levels of official foreign exchange \nreserves of the central bank, and its track record of strong balance of payments positions \ncharacterized  by  both  external  current  account  and  overall  balance  of  payments  surplus \npositions, debt servicing should not be major cause for concern (Appendix 8).  \n \n ", "26 \n \nVI.  IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS, BENEFITS AND IMPACT, AND RISKS AND \nSAFEGUARDS FOR THE PUBLIC EXPENDITURE SUPPORT FACILITY PROGRAM AND \nCOUNTERCYCLICAL SUPPORT FACILITY SUPPORT PROGRAM \nA.  Implementation Arrangements46 \n1.  Program Management \n97.  MOF  will  be  the  executing  agency,  and  will  be  responsible  for  the  overall \nimplementation of the Program (the PESF and the CSF) including compliance with all policy \nactions and administration, disbursements, and maintenance of records. In principle, MOF will \nbe responsible for day-to-day implementation activities, report implementation progress, and \nprovide guidance and direction to the implementing agencies. A joint secretary of the Finance \nDivision, MOF, will act as the program director. The program director will be responsible for \ncoordinating and ensuring that the work of the executing agency, the implementing agencies, \nunder the guidance of the Program Steering Committee (PSC, para. 98) is carried out on time, \nso as to ensure Program implementation as scheduled.  \n \n98.  The implementing agencies will be (i) Finance Division of MOF; (ii) National Board of \nRevenue under MOF; (iii) Ministry of Food and Disaster Management; (iv) Ministry of Women \nand Children Affairs; (v) Local Government Division of Ministry of Local Government, Rural \nDevelopment, and Cooperatives; (vi) Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation Division of \nMinistry of Planning; (vii) Socioeconomic Infrastructure Division of the Planning Commission, \nMinistry of Planning; (viii) Roads and Railways Division of Ministry of Communications; (ix) \nPower Division and Energy and Mineral Resources Division of Ministry of Power, Energy, and \nMineral Resources; and (x) Ministry of Commerce. Each of the implementing agencies will be \nresponsible for meeting the policy actions of the PESF under their respective implementing \nagencies. Since there are no policy actions for the CSF, the implementing agencies will function \nand provide support for the purpose of monitoring expenditures financed by the CSF. \n \n99.  The PSC for the Program will be formed and will be chaired by the secretary, Finance \nDivision, MOF. The members will include representatives not below the rank of joint secretary \nfrom each of the implementing agencies and the joint secretary of the Economic Relations \nDivision. The PSC will be responsible for providing overall direction, guidance, monitoring, and \noversight under the Program. The PSC will meet at least on a quarterly basis to discuss the \nprogress of the PESF and review macroeconomic conditions to ensure continued stability.   \n \n2.  Procurement and Disbursement \n100.  The PESF will be released in two tranches and the CSF in a single tranche upon loan \neffectiveness.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange  costs \n(excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and procured in ADB member countries, no \nmore than 180 days before the effectiveness date of the loan. Items specified in the list of \nineligible items (Appendix 9) and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources are \nexcluded.  In  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement \nProcedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans (1998), the loan proceeds will be \ndisbursed  to  the  People's  Republic  of  Bangladesh  as  the  Borrower.  No  supporting  import \ndocumentation will be required if during each year that loan proceeds are expected to be \ndisbursed, the value of Bangladesh total imports minus imports from nonmember countries, \n                                                 \n46 See Supplementary Appendix I for further details on the implementation arrangements. ", "27 \nineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development assistance is equal to \nor  greater  than  the  amount  of  the  loan  expected  to  be  disbursed  during  such  year.  The \nGovernment will certify its compliance with this formula with each withdrawal request. Otherwise, \nimport documentation under existing procedures will be required. Disbursements will be made \nunder  the  simplified  procedures  for  program  loans.  In  accordance  with  the  simplified \ndisbursement procedures and related requirements for program loans, all goods and services \nproduced and originating in ADB member countries will be procured, with due consideration to \neconomy and efficiency, in accordance with the Government\u2019s standard public procedures and \nnormal private sector commercial practices acceptable to ADB. Goods commonly traded on the \ninternational commodity market will be procured in accordance with procedures appropriate to \nthe trade and acceptable to ADB. \n \n3.  Counterpart Funds \n101.  The local currency generated from the proceeds of the PESF will be used to finance \nadjustment costs under the PESF, including (i) delivery of scaled up SSNPs, (ii) strengthening \nof the funding and implementation of PPPs, and enhancement of access to credit for SMEs and \nthe housing sector, and (iii) revenue mobilization measures, reforms in PFM processes, and \napplication of the MTBF. The CSF will supplement the PESF by funding additional SSNPs \n(Appendix 3, and Supplementary Appendix B), including for returning migrants, unemployed \nyouth, stipends to keep students in school, pensions, public works in disaster-prone areas, and \nfood-based assistance. Supplementary Appendix F provides breakdown of support for SSNPs \nthrough the PESF and the CSF. \n \n4.  Anticorruption Policy and Governance Risks \n102.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Program. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations \nand the bidding documents for the Program. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the Program shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of the EA and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and \nother service providers as they relate to the Program. \n \n103.  As part of preparation for the Program, a governance risk assessment was conducted \nalong the lines prescribed by the implementation of the Second Governance and Anticorruption \nAction Plan (Supplementary Appendix H). A close review of the PFM and other systems shows \nthe following areas that are of particular concern: \n \n(i)  Weak  institutional  capacity.  In  order  for  the  Program  to  succeed,  it  is \nimperative that relevant institutions are strengthened.  \n \n(ii)  Non-sustainability of policy reforms. There should be continuous engagement \nwith the Government and other relevant stakeholders on the reform measures to \nensure  appropriate  buy-in  and  ongoing  commitment.  Civil  society  and  other \ndevelopment partners should be consulted as part of this on-going process. \n \n(iii)  Mismanagement  of  resources  in  the  public  sector.  Adequate  auditing \nprovisions, and a fully functional and effective Ombudsman office, supported by a \n ", "28 \n \nconstantly vigilant media and civil society, would lessen mismanagement in the \npublic  sector.  Close  performance  monitoring  will  also  be  necessary  to  help \nreduce the negative effects of implementation delays due to capacity constraints.  \n \n(iv)  Weak coordination. The MOF will have to play a much stronger role to ensure \nproper coordination across government departments, particularly in light of the \nfocus on implementation of the MTBF under the PESF. \n \n(v)  Fiduciary risks. Quarterly reporting arrangements are built into the Program.  \n \n104.  The  success  of  the  Program  depends  on  the  Government\u2019s  continuing  strong \ncommitment to governance reforms in general and, more specifically, to successfully countering \nendemic and widespread corruption. There is a risk that recently initiated reforms may be \nreversed; this risk may be mitigated by continued policy dialogue, not only with the Government \nbut also with other stakeholders. The ongoing ADB-funded Good Governance Program provides \nadequate support to all levels of Government to ensure that mismanagement of resources is \nmore effectively addressed. It has also set aside resources for capacity building to ensure that \ngovernment agencies are building the relevant capacity for grievance handling and service \ndelivery feedback.47  \n \n5.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n105.  The Government will maintain separate records of accounts for the Program (PESF and \nCSF). To ensure proper fund management, ADB retains the right to audit the use of program \nloan proceeds. The accounts will be managed, operated, and liquidated in accordance with \nterms satisfactory to ADB. For the PESF, the Finance Division, MOF, will prepare a quarterly \nconsolidated progress report on policy and institutional reforms implementation and will forward \nthe same to ADB at the time of submission to the PSC. The reports will describe progress made \nin  the  PESF  and  any  changes  to  the  implementation  schedule,  and  will  also  identify  any \nproblems  encountered  and  remedial  actions  taken.  Not  later  than  3  months  after  PESF \ncompletion, the Government will provide ADB with a PESF completion report, including an \nassessment of overall PESF performance.  \n \n106.  For the CSF, the Finance Division, MOF, will maintain all monitoring data and evaluate \nthe benefits of the CSF, and will also submit a semiannual progress report to ADB that reviews \nthe macroeconomic and fiscal conditions. Within three months after the CSF completion, the \nGovernment will provide ADB with a CSF completion report that includes an assessment of the \nextent of progress and the impact of actions under the CSF. \n \n6.  Program Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n107.  The Government and ADB have agreed on a set of indicators and targets that will be \nused  to  assess  progress  toward  meeting  the  objectives  of  the  Program.  MOF  shall  be \nresponsible for maintaining all monitoring data and evaluating benefits. The PSC will monitor \nimplementation and outcomes of the core components as follows: \n \n                                                 \n47 The ADB-funded ongoing Good Governance Program (footnotes 17 and 34) makes provision of approximately $15 \nmillion for 2009 and 2010 to build the capacity of sector agencies as well as local authorities for implementation of \nthe National Integrity Strategy, a key part of which is supporting application of the Right to Information Act, \nanticorruption-related reforms, and strengthening grievance-handling mechanisms. ", "29 \n(i)  Macroeconomic and fiscal monitoring will be based on data from the Bangladesh \nBureau of Statistics, MOF, the Planning Commission and Bangladesh Bank, as \nwell as data from the IMF.  \n(ii)  To monitor progress in enhancing the provision of safety nets and empowerment \nprograms for the poor and vulnerable, the PSC and ADB will rely on SSNP data \nrecorded  by  local  administrations  and  agencies;  Ministry  of  Social  Welfare; \nMinistry of Local Government, Rural Development, and Cooperatives; Ministry of \nFood  and  Disaster  Management;  and  MOF,  as  well  as  quantitative  and \nqualitative  information  available  from  development  partners,  civil  society \norganizations  and  nongovernment  organizations  active  in  this  area\u2014when \navailable, data from the Household Income and Expenditure Survey conducted \nafter 2005, and gender-disaggregated data from existing gender budgets, will \nalso be used.  \n(iii)  MOF, Ministry of Planning, Bangladesh Bank, and Federation of Bangladesh \nChambers of Commerce and Industry will be the primary sources of information \nto monitor progress in putting in place the necessary PPP framework and in \naccelerating implementation of public infrastructure projects under the ADP and \nPPP; information from IMF will also be consulted.  \n \n108.  For each of these indicators, progress will be measured against a baseline in FY2009 \n(Appendix 1 and Appendix 2). The responsible line ministries working in these sectors will \nreview these frameworks every three months to determine progress and identify constraints. \nThe executing agency will have the primary responsibility for monitoring implementation and \noutcomes and assessing the status of reforms. It will closely coordinate the monitoring of \nreforms in social protection, private sector investment, and PFM with development partners \nworking in these areas through regular reviews; and it will report to ADB on the status of the \nProgram targets and indicators. ADB will also review progress in implementation of reforms \nthrough review missions, in consultation with other development partners, as needed. A detailed \ndescription of the monitoring arrangements is in Appendix 10. \n \n109.  Program  reviews  will  be  undertaken  on  a  continuing  basis.  MOF  will  conduct  joint \nquarterly meetings with the PSC and the implementing agencies to review progress. MOF will, \nas needed, hold consultative meetings with the private sector and development partners to \nsolicit their feedback on emerging policies and on the impact of the Program. A review of the \nPESF will also take place prior to the scheduled release of the second tranche. This review will, \namong others, (i) assess implementation performance against the tranche release conditions \nand covenants; and (ii) identify relevant problems and constraints. If the reviews determine that \nchanges are required, the Government and ADB will agree on measures, including changes in \nimplementation arrangements, to ensure that the Program obligations are met. \n \n110.  The PSC and ADB shall jointly conduct semi-annual reviews of the macroeconomic and \nfiscal conditions of the economy and assess the impact and evaluate the benefits of actions \nunder  the  CSF  on  the  real  economy  and  the  social  sectors,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nperformance management review requirements. MOF shall be responsible for maintaining all \nmonitoring data and evaluating the benefits of the CSF. Within three months after the CSF \nperiod, MOF, with the support of the implementing agencies will submit a CSF completion report \nto ADB that assesses the extent of progress under the CSF. The economics, governance, and \nportfolio  management  units  at  the  ADB  resident  mission  will  continue  to  closely  monitor \nmacroeconomic performance, status of reforms, and the impact of the measures taken even \nafter Program completion.  \n \n ", "30 \n \nB.  Expected Benefits and Impact \n111.  The Program will provide financing for scaling up SSNPs and will support reforms to \nimplement the SSNPs more effectively through better targeting. Regardless of the global crisis, \nexpanding the coverage of SSNPs and improving targeting would have been critical to prevent \nthe hardcore poor and most vulnerable segments of the population, especially women and \npeople living in disaster-prone areas, from falling more deeply into poverty. As a result of \nreforms supported by the Program, the poor will be empowered to claim and receive the \nbenefits they are entitled to, because of enhanced access to information and oversight. Training \nand microcredit schemes (such as that provided through the Palli Karma Shahayok Foundation) \nwill also help improve economic opportunities for the poor. The immediate benefit from these \nwill be to safeguard the gains in economic and social welfare in a very poor country. The \nSummary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy is in Appendix 11.  \n \n112.  In the context of the economic slowdown and lower revenue collection, the Program will \nprovide additional resources to help expand SSNPs so as to also cover people previously non \npoor who are hurt by the crisis, such as households highly dependent on remittances, laid off \nexpatriate and factory workers in affected export sectors, women forced into low-paying and \ninsecure jobs, as well as the large number of young people joining the labor market at a time of \nshrinking job opportunities. The SSNPs will make it possible for poor, including female-headed \nhouseholds, to preserve adequate food intake through various food relief schemes, and to \ninvest in their children's education with the help of stipends for primary, secondary, and drop-out \nstudents. Thanks to uninterrupted pension payments, poor pensioners will be able to continue \nsustaining  their  families.  The  'Skill  Development  Fund  for  Expatriate  Returnees  and  New \nEntrants to the Labor Market', as well as the 'Ghare Fera (Returning Home) Program' will \nfacilitate  the  economic  and  social  reinsertion  of  migrant  workers.  Rural  employment \nopportunities will also help absorb some of the excess labor force and ensure a minimum \nlivelihood to people with no other resources.  \n \n113.  In addition to the direct benefit for the poor, the Program will create fiscal space to \nenable the Government to finance scaled up infrastructure investment and a fiscal stimulus \npackage. These additional expenditures will help reduce the risk of unemployment and income \nloss  in  the  immediate  term,  and  also  enhance  longer-term  growth  prospects  without \ncompromising  macroeconomic  stability  or  crowding  out  private  investment.  Moreover,  the \nbenefits from the structural reforms supported under the PESF will be felt in the medium and \nlong term by helping to remove institutional impediments to higher private sector participation in \ninfrastructure investment.  \n \n114.  Successful PPPs in infrastructure and social sectors, over the medium- to long-term will \nenable  Government  to  expand  the  level  of  social  expenditures  and  broaden  management \ncapacity for infrastructure projects. In the short run, a key benefit from scaled up investment in \ninfrastructure  will  be  job  creation,  which  will  help  absorb  the  large  labor  force,  preserve \nlivelihoods and sustain demand at a time of collapsing income-earning opportunities at the \nglobal level. These investments will also build potential for more rapid growth in the medium \nterm. SMEs would receive adequate support, thus helping to contribute to more inclusive growth.  \n \n115.  The  results  from  performance  monitoring  and  reporting  systems  will  feed  into  the \nplanning and budgeting process. The Public Accounts Committee will use the audit results to \nensure accountability on public spending and control irregularities. Internal and external control \nmeasures and oversight will have been put in place to reduce the scope for corruption.  \n ", "31 \nC.  Program Risks and Safeguards \n116.  Risks.  Success  of  the  Program  depends  on  Government's  continuing  strong \ncommitment to the economic reform agenda as demonstrated in the FY2010 budget. Some of \nthe risks include (i) continuation of the global crisis and its impact on the Bangladesh economy \nthat would accentuate the risk of the budget deficit exceeding 5% of GDP\u2014this would lead to \ncorrespondingly higher borrowing requirement, which would seriously limit the availability of \ncredit for the private sector and could compromise macroeconomic stability, (ii) a further decline \nin remittances, which would reduce livelihoods for many rural households heavily dependent on \nsuch income, (iii) lack of targeted focus on capacity enhancement in Government to implement \nthe economic reform agenda, (iv) leakages, poor targeting, and corruption that could reduce the \neffectiveness of expenditures through mismanagement of resources, weak business processes, \nand weak internal accountability in the system, (v) reduced focus on the enabling conditions \n(such as appropriate legal and policy framework) for reform efforts such as on PPPs, and (vi) \nineffective service delivery as a result of low capacity at the local level. \n \n117.  Mitigation  Measures. The countercyclical development program to support affected \nsectors will reduce the risk of job shedding, and broaden access to credit for SMEs and women \nentrepreneurs. SSNPs targeting people with low income and no assets will provide protection in \nthe event of a further decline in remittances. Actions taken under the PESF to enhance access \nto information and to strengthen the representation of the poor and vulnerable groups will help \nmitigate some of the concerns regarding possible leakage, mismanagement, or corruption. Line \nministries, being instructed to advance the preparation of project approval and procurement \ndocuments  in  FY2010  and  their  performance  being  monitored  more  closely,  should  help \naccelerate actual investment spending. Additional measures to mitigate these risks include (i) \nring-fencing of specific PESF-supported reforms so that Government commitment to fund them \nis maintained, (ii) targeted capacity building by Government for specific areas of PESF focus, \nand (iii) continued engagement with Government on governance reform measures, such as that \ncurrently in place.  \n \n118.  Safeguards.  The Program has been reviewed for its impact on the various relevant \nADB and Government safeguards, and no adverse impact is expected on the environment, \nresettlement, or indigenous population as a result of the policy interventions. For all three areas, \nthe Program is rated a category C. \n \nVII.   ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n119.  For the PESF, in addition to the standard assurances, the Government will be requested \nto give the following specific assurances, which will be incorporated in the Loan Agreements: \n \n(i)  The Government will (a) ensure that all policies adopted and actions taken under \nthe PESF, as set forth in the Policy Letter and the Policy Matrix, will continue to \nbe in effect for and beyond the duration of the PESF, and (b) promptly adopt and \nimplement the policies and actions included in the Program PESF set forth in the \nPolicy Letter and the policy Matrix. \n \n(ii)  The  Government  will  give  due  consideration  to  the  findings  and \nrecommendations  proposed  as  a  result  of  the  PESF  while  carrying  out  the \npolicies and actions under the PESF. \n ", "32 \n \n \n(iii)  The Government will keep ADB informed of, and the Government and ADB will \nfrom time to time exchange views on, the progress made in carrying out the \npolicies and actions set out in the Policy Letter and the Policy Matrix and in the \nformulation and implementation of new related policies. \n \n(iv)  The  Government  and  ADB  will  promptly  discuss  problems  and  constraints \nencountered during the implementation of the PESF and appropriate measures \nto overcome or mitigate such problems and constraints. \n \n(v)  The  Government  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  policy  discussions  with  other \nmultilateral  and  bilateral  aid  agencies  that  may  have  implications  for  the \nimplementation  of  the  PESF  and  will  provide  ADB  with  an  opportunity  to \ncomment  on  any  resulting  policy  proposals.  The  Government  will  take  into \naccount ADB\u2019s views before finalizing and implementing any such proposals.  \n \n(vi)  The Government will ensure that the counterpart funds are used to finance the \nlocal currency cost relating to the implementation of the PESF and other activities \nconsistent with the objectives of the PESF and will provide the necessary budget \nappropriation  to  finance  the  structural  adjustment  costs  relating  to  the \nimplementation of reforms under the PESF, including (a) revenue mobilization \nmeasures, reforming financial management processes, and application of MTBF, \n(b) strengthening the funding and implementation of PPPs, and (c) delivery of \nsocial safety nets. \n \n(vii)  The  Government  will  undertake  periodic  reviews  during  the  PESF \nimplementation to evaluate the scope, implementation arrangements, progress \nand  achievement  of  the  objectives  of  the  PESF.  In  addition  to  the  periodic \nreviews, a review of PESF will take place prior to the second tranche release. \nThe Government will ensure that ADB will have the opportunity to participate in \nthese reviews. \n \nB.  Conditions to Loan Effectiveness \n120.  The following are the conditions for program loan effectiveness:  \n \n(i)  All conditions for the release of the first tranche of the PESF, as specified in the \nPolicy Matrix, have been complied to the satisfaction of ADB;  \n(ii)  The Government will have established the PSC and appointed the implementing \nagencies for the PESF and the CSF;   \n(iii)  the loan agreements for the PESF will have been duly executed and delivered on \nbehalf of Bangladesh and all conditions precedent to their effectiveness (other \nthan conditions requiring the effectiveness of the CSF loan agreement) will have \nbeen fulfilled; and \n(iv)  the loan agreement for the CSF will have been duly executed and delivered on \nbehalf of Bangladesh and all conditions precedent to their effectiveness (other \nthan conditions requiring the effectiveness of the loan agreements for the PESF) \nwill have been fulfilled.  \n ", "33 \nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n121.

Overview1  \n1.  The ongoing global economic crisis, as well as the recent natural disasters, has had a \nsevere impact on Bangladesh and its economy. Chief among the impacts has been the slide of \nmillions of vulnerable people (paras 2 and 3) towards greater poverty in a country where nearly \n40% of the population are already below the poverty line.2 Concerned at this development, the \nGovernment of Bangladesh (the Government) is aware that (i) on the one hand, it is vital that \nthe short-term impacts of the crisis on vulnerable people be immediately addressed; and (ii) in \nthe medium- to long- term, it is important that measures be in place to improve the public \nfinancial  and  expenditure  management  system,  and  make  the  investment  climate  more \nconducive for the private sector to augment public sector investments. The Public Expenditure \nSupport Facility (PESF) Program is aligned with these specific measures taken by Government.  \n   \nB.  Definition of Vulnerable People  \n2.  While data limitations do not allow measuring the extent of vulnerability, poverty and \nvulnerability are often closely linked, with the poor being the most vulnerable to falling into \ndeeper poverty as a result of life cycle and aggregate climatic shocks. Poor households have \nlimited human and physical assets, and shocks to individual members (e.g., illness, loss of job) \nor the community (e.g., floods) force them into ineffective risk coping strategies (child labor, sale \nof productive assets, informal lenders) that push them deeper into poverty. \n \n3.  The groups particularly vulnerable to risks include: (i) infants and children that face the \nrisk of poverty, malnutrition, low human capital accumulation, and exploitation in the labor \nforce;3 (ii) working age adults that face the risk of unemployment and low productivity; (iii) \nelderly  adults  that  lack  adequate  safety  nets;  (iv)  special  and  excluded  groups  that  need \nassistance;4 and (v) a majority of the women who have very limited access to empowerment \nand productive employment opportunities. \n \nC.  Social Safety Net Programs  \n4.  Bangladesh relies on a range of informal and formal instruments to mitigate the risk of \nvulnerable populations falling into poverty, and to help them cope with poverty. The Government \nhas  initiated  numerous  social  safety  net  programs  (SSNPs),5 including  safety  nets,  social \ninsurance (e.g., pensions, unemployment benefits), and labor market policies/programs to (i) \n                                                 \n1  For purposes of the PESF, the term sector refers to the public expenditure domain, particularly, public financial \nmanagement (including public sector efficiency and revenue mobilization, and financial and fiscal management), \nprivate sector development, and service delivery in the domain of SSNPs. These three are inter-related sub-\ncomponents of the PESF. \n2  Poverty line constructed using the cost-of-basic needs method represent the level of per capita expenditure at \nwhich the members of a household can be expected to meet their basic food calorie requirement (2,122 kilo \ncalories per day per person) and also non-food consumption.    \n3  Over 60% of households in Bangladesh with multiple children are poor. Access to education is still inequitable with \nonly 24% of expenditures at the secondary level, and only 17% of expenditures at the tertiary level accruing to the \npoor. About 20% of children aged 5-17 years are working and over four-fifths of these come from poor households. \nMalnutrition remains a serious concern, with nearly half of all children under 6 years of age being underweight or \nstunted.  \n4  Special categories include the disabled, widowed women, hill tribes, and other minorities and groups that are \namong the poorest and most marginalized in Bangladesh. Hill tribes, for example, constitute only about 1% of the \npopulation, but their needs are extreme. \n5  Further details on SSNPs are in Table A3 and Supplementary Appendix B.  \n ", "44      Appendix 3     \nhelp the poor and those vulnerable to cope with shocks to their incomes and livelihoods; (ii) help \nworkers retrenched during industrial restructuring, including by providing access to credit; and \n(iii) strengthen disaster prevention and mitigation strategies. Income transfers from SSNPs have \nalso  played  an  important  role  in  protecting  and  expanding  asset  bases  of  the  poor  and \nvulnerable.  Notwithstanding  these,  the  SSNPs  face  several  challenges  including  coverage, \nleakages, targeting, and oversight opportunities. The PESF aims to address some of these \naspects  in  a  substantive  manner.  In  addition,  the  Countercyclical  Support  Facility  Support \nProgram facilitates the scaling up of the SSNPs and frees up fiscal space for other areas of the \nGovernment's countercyclical development program.  \n \n5.  Coverage. Increasing the coverage of the SSNPs is a major challenge.6 As a result, the \ncoverage of food security, a primary element in the SSNPs, is considered inadequate. The \nexpansion of SSNPs for mitigating the adverse impacts of natural disasters and external price \nshocks on the food security of vulnerable populations is constrained by limited fiscal space and \nalso by weak institutional capacities of the relevant government agencies. \n \n6.  Leakage.7 Leakage  in  SSNPs  and  the  service  delivery  system  is  also  a  serious \nchallenge in Bangladesh. Minimizing the number of intermediaries in service delivery, realigning \nincentives for more efficient service delivery, and making the decisions of intermediaries more \ntransparent  are  some  solutions.  Given  that  leakage  and  misallocation  problems  may  go \nundetected for long periods of time if monitoring and management capacity are inadequate, \nputting greater emphasis on monitoring capacity within line agencies is critical. There is a need \nfor digitization and greater use of information technology to make SSNPs more effective.  \n \n7.  Targeting. While the new SSNPs introduced in the FY2010 budget (Table A3) will \ncertainly help address the adverse impacts of the global crisis, there is an equally pressing need \nfor enhancing targeting of SSNPs for maximizing their impact. SSNPs can be made more \neffective by improving targeting criteria,8 for which it will be necessary to target households \nusing criteria that are more closely related to occupation and income than to assets such as \nland. At a systemic level, the Government will need to put in place stronger gender budgeting \nguidelines for greater accountability of the share of expenditure for women development.  \n \n8.  Oversight Opportunities. In order to strengthen gender targeting and for more effective \nservice  delivery,  it  is  important  to  ensure  that  oversight  opportunities  are  available  to  the \nvulnerable people that access SSNPs to ensure that service provision is being done in a \ntransparent and accountable manner. In this regard, legislative measures such as the Right to \n                                                 \n6  Although the number of beneficiaries covered under SSNPs looks high from Government records, it may be noted \nthat the same beneficiary could be included in separate programs and counted more than once. \n7  Leakage is manifested by a gap between the value of a good or a service delivered and a reasonable cost of the \nitem for the producer and the service provider. Leakage could be the result of a technical loss, weak financial \nmanagement, theft, and/or corruption.  \n8  To facilitate better targeting, it is necessary first to prepare a comprehensive list of the hardcore poor and other \nvulnerable populations. At the moment, the Government does not have the complete picture of the true variance \nbetween those in need of the coverage and those that are actually accessing the SSNPs. This gap in service \ndelivery is serious, and requires that the Government take a concerted approach to prepare an operational plan to \ncollect the necessary information from all the districts and sub-districts. ", "  Appendix 3  45 \nInformation Act, and the Consumers' Right Protection Act need to be operationalized. Also \nuseful will be application of the citizen's charter in public sector organizations.9  \n \nD.  Public-Private Partnerships  \n \n9.  The second critical element of the sector, and one that is substantively related to the \nfirst,10 has to do with the manner in which the Government is able to focus on the more long-\nterm requirement of infrastructure development for fostering economic growth. Over the last few \nyears, public investment in infrastructure in Bangladesh has remained stagnant at under 5% of \nthe  gross  domestic  product  (GDP).  Persistent neglect  of public  infrastructure services  has \nhampered  domestic  economic  growth  and  restrained  Bangladesh  from  living  up  to  its  full \npotential  from  a  regional  standpoint  of  being  able  to  assume  the  role  of  a  transport  and \ntransshipment hub for the subregion. Furthermore, inadequate infrastructure limits the country\u2019s \nopportunities for integrating economically with its neighbors.  \n \n10.  As is the case in most of South Asia, the public sector has been the main provider of \nbasic infrastructure in Bangladesh. However, public financing alone will not be able to generate \nthe investments needed to provide the required level of infrastructure facilities. Aware of this \nlimitation, the Government agencies\u23afInfrastructure Development Company Limited, Investment \nPromotion  and  Financing  Facility,  and  Infrastructure  Investment  Facilitation  Center\u23afare \nengaged in enhancing private sector investments in infrastructure services.  \n \n11.  Notwithstanding  some  limited  success,  significant  scaling  up  of  infrastructure \ndevelopment  still  faces  formidable  challenges.  While  earnest  efforts  have  been  made  to \nupgrade the existing public\u2013private partnership (PPP)11 guidelines, no detailed PPP framework \nhas emerged so far. Gaps in technical and management capabilities and in identifying market \nopportunities also severely impede the potential for PPPs. Even though the Private Sector \nInfrastructure  Guidelines  (PSIG)  issued  in  2004  are  the  basis  for  implementation  of  PPP \nprojects, there is lack of clarity and consistency between the Public Procurement Regulations \nand PSIG. Mobilizing finance for private investment in infrastructure is also a major challenge in \nthe absence of a well-developed domestic capital market.  \n \n12.  Realizing  its  role  in  catalyzing  infrastructure  development12 the  Government  in  its \nFY2010 budget has taken a comprehensive approach13 for mainstreaming PPPs, which include:  \n \n(i)  PPP Cell for coordinating the mainstreaming of PPPs nationwide;  \n                                                 \n9 Citizen's charters allow the service recipients to be not only aware of their entitlements but also of their rights in \naccessing those entitlements. Where such tools have been used effectively, they have been powerful tools to give \nservice recipients greater voice in the service delivery process. Such tools, however, have to be applied in \nconjunction with legislative measures such as the right to information so that lapses in service delivery can be \neffectively reported and corrective action taken by service providers. \n10 Largely through better access to health facilities, job opportunities, and market outlets.  \n11 PPP projects are typically projects developed, implemented, and operated by bidders (stand-alone special purpose \nvehicles). Further, these projects are selected on the basis of a competitive and transparent bidding arrangement \nand are expected to be build-and-operate infrastructure based on a concession arrangement with the Government.  \n12 The Government has reviewed and drawn lessons from ADB's ongoing support for mainstreaming PPPs in India. \nADB. 2006.

The allocations made for the above measures in the FY2010 budget are approximately \n$362 million. The Government will also revise and reissue the 2004 PSIG to place a strong legal \nand  institutional  framework  for  PPPs.  The  ongoing  financial  sector  reforms,  especially  on \nimproving money and debt markets, are also being pursued to ease financing constraints. While \nthe measures taken by the Government reflect its intent to usher in private sector investment in \ndelivery  of  infrastructure,  the  convergence  of  policy,  legal,  and  institutional  aspects  for \nmainstreaming  PPPs  is  a  medium  to  long-term  process.  Accordingly,  further  assistance \nespecially for strengthening capacity building14 would be considered by ADB on the completion \nof the PPP reforms initiated under the PESF.  \n \nE.  Public Financial Management  \n14.  Efficient and accountable public financial management (PFM) and financial management \ninstitutions  are  key  elements  of  good  governance.  Sound  public  financial  management \nencompasses four broad elements: (i) maintenance of sound fiscal policies, (ii) allocation of \nresources in accordance with the stated policies and priorities of government, (iii) appropriate \nuse of budgeted funds and assets, and (iv) adherence to internationally accepted accounting \nand auditing standards and firm internal control measures. While Bangladesh has achieved a \nsustainable fiscal balance and low budget deficit, there is need for improving coordination and \nefficiency in the three other financial management elements.   \n \n15.  In light of the global crisis and its short- and medium-term impacts on the economy, the \nGovernment  realizes  that  there  is  need  to  ensure  strong  PFM  as  well  as  efficient  public \nexpenditure management systems. Towards this end, several specific areas of reforms are \nbeing targeted under the PESF including (i) public sector efficiency and revenue mobilization, \n(ii) accounting, auditing, and project approval process, and (iii) wider application of the medium-\nterm budgetary framework (MTBF). \n \n16.  Efficiencies and Revenue Mobilization. For enlarging the fiscal space, and making \nmore resources available for public investment in infrastructure and human capital development \nmeasures  need  to  be  stepped  up  to  increase  the  public  resource  envelop  not  only  by \nstrengthening  the  tax  system  but  also  by  improving  efficiencies  in  the  public  sector.  The \nGovernment can, through corporatization and divestiture, reduce its expenditure burden (thus \nfreeing  up  resources  to  be  channeled  for  investments  and  for  SSNPs).  To  this  end,  the \nGovernment can use measures that are legislative (such as amendments to the Income Tax \nOrdinance),  or  institutional  (such  as  reconstituting  companies  under  the  Company  Act,  or \n                                                 \n14  Capacity development for refining the PPP policy and regulatory framework; meeting compliance/public safety \nnorms;  improving  information;  improving  bidding  documents  and  procedures;  determining  risk  sharing;  and \ndetermining  adequate  monitoring  arrangements.  ADB's  ongoing  support  for  financing  infrastructure  projects \nincluding PPPs is also providing capacity building support for developing PPP framework and guidelines. ADB. \n2008. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Loans and Technical \nAssistance Grant to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Public-Private Infrastructure Development Facility. \nManila. \n ", "  Appendix 3  47 \ndivesting shares from state-owned enterprises). Government also has plans to expand the \nincome  tax  base  by  identifying  new  taxpayers  through  relevant  surveys  covering  areas  in \ndistricts and cities that are still outside the income tax net, and expanding the tax net to Upazila \n(subdistrict levels). \n \n17.  A stronger revenue administration is critically important for raising revenue significantly. \nThe National Board of Revenue (NBR), which collects direct and indirect taxes (accounting for \naround 95% of tax revenues), has over the years sought to modernize and attract skilled staff, \nand carry out its statutory functions. Yet, past reform programs have not fully addressed all the \nareas needing improvement and modernization. The business community generally feels that \ntax administration needs to be improved to make it more responsive to business needs, ensure \nmore  stable  tax  policies  and  more  consistent  and  uniform  application  of  tax  laws.  Tax \nregulations  also  need  to  be  modernized  in  step  with  the  changing  needs  and  practices \nworldwide.  \n \n18.  Public Sector Accounting and Fiscal Reporting.  Public  sector  accounting  standards \nand  practices  in  Bangladesh  need  to  be  updated.  The  Government  follows  a  cash-based \naccounting standard (rather than an accrual-based system) that recognizes expenses only \nwhen actual cash is paid rather than when commitment of resources is made. The practice \nunderestimates future expenses in the present fiscal year and complicates the budgeting process. \nAccuracy of government accounts also need to be enhanced by ensuring greater consistency \nbetween  bank  balances  shown  in  the  government  balance  sheet  and  those  reflected  in \nBangladesh  Bank  statements.  Control  mechanisms  need  to  be  strengthened  to  prevent \nmisclassification of public expenditure accounts, and any concealment of misappropriation of \nresources. Foreign-assisted expenditure also needs to be properly reflected in the consolidated \nmonthly accounts, to ensure accuracy of the information on public expenditure.  \n \n19.  Monthly financial reports showing actual expenditures against the budgeted levels are \nproduced within five weeks after the end of each month. Although all significant expenditures of \nthe central government are included in the fiscal reports, fiscal reporting remains incomplete as \nthe expenditures of the local government and state-owned enterprises are not incorporated. \nAnnual Finance Accounts of the government are also submitted with considerable time lag, \nmore than 12 months after the close of the financial year. While the Government generates \ninformation on its contingent liabilities, the lack of comprehensiveness in the report on liabilities \nindicates  a  low  reliability  of  fiscal  reporting.  Finally,  approval  and  reporting  processes  for \ndevelopment projects are lengthy and complex, which has jeopardized the pace of completion \nof the Annual Development Program (ADP). \n \n20.  Budget Preparation and Execution. While the Government has put in place a MTBF \n(which has been adopted in 20 of the 42 government ministries/divisions, covering 53% of total \nbudget and 86% of ADP), application of the MTBF needs to be made uniform across the public \nsector. Also important is to institute the budgeting process in the 64 districts of the country. Given \nthat  Bangladesh does not have a federal form of  government,  much of the impetus in the \neconomic and fiscal realms stems from the center. As service delivery needs to be delegated to \nthe local levels, if it is to be effective and efficient, there is a corresponding need to strengthen \ndistrict  budgeting  processes,  which  will  also  ensure  transparency  of  public  expenditure  and \ngreater accountability in program implementation. The Government is contemplating the first step \nin this regard, by preparing a district budget for one district in each administrative division of the \ncountry in the national budget for FY2011. \n \n ", "48      Appendix 3     \n21.  To improve the effectiveness of application of the MTBF across public sector agencies, \nthe capability of the agencies that are currently implementing it needs to be enhanced. The \npractice of rotating staff in the administration, particularly at the senior level, also needs to be \nrationalized for facilitating efficient mainstreaming of the MTBF within the agencies. This will be \nessential  to  achieve  a  sustainable  MTBF  process  that  can  contribute  effectively  to  the \nrealization of improved budget outcomes.

Overview \n \n1.  Debt  sustainability  analysis  indicates  that  Bangladesh  does  not  have  a  debt \nsustainability problem. Bangladesh\u2019s external debt burden indicators do not breach the relevant \nindicative thresholds established under the International Monetary Fund (IMF)\u2212World Bank debt \nsustainability analysis (DSA) framework. Debt burden indicators are somewhat worse when \ndomestic debt is included in the analysis, in part because of higher interest rates on such debt.   \n \n2.  Box A8 summarizes the medium-term macroeconomic framework underlying the DSA \nexercise.  It is based on the projections of real gross domestic product (GDP) growth that are in \nline  with,  but  slightly  lower  than, Government\u2019s  medium-term  framework,  and  estimates  of \nexternal assistance that reflect natural growth while pointing to diminishing dependence on \nexternal financing over the long term, in line with the trend observed in recent decades. Export \ngrowth is slightly higher in the medium term in line with recent export performance, but tapers \noff to more moderate levels in the outer years. Both the GDP and export growth assumptions \nare broadly similar to the assumptions in the IMF\u2212World Bank DSA prepared in 2008. Import \ngrowth is also projected to be significantly higher than the historical average throughout the \nprojection period in line with in the IMF\u2212World Bank DSA. Finally, due to strong growth in \nremittances from the oil exporting Gulf Cooperation Council states, United States, Europe, and \nMalaysia, private net current transfers are expected to remain buoyant.  \nBox A8: Bangladesh: Macroeconomic Assumptions Underlying the Debt Sustainability Analysis \n \nThe macroeconomic assumptions are as follows: \nReal GDP growth in the medium term is projected to be between 6-6.5%, slightly above the recent historical \naverage of 6%, and it picks up in the outer years to 7%. This is close to (but slightly lower than) the Government's \nown medium-term projection, and assumes continued progress in broad-based structural reforms and increased \nopenness of the economy that should allow Bangladesh to benefit from dynamic growth elsewhere in the Asian \nregion. \nInflation, as measured by the GDP deflator, increased in 2008 due to higher food and energy prices, but then \ndeclines and stabilizes at around 5.5% over the medium and long term. \nThe growth of both exports and imports is strong in the medium term, in the 12-15% range. As the economy \nopens, both will increase in percent of GDP with imports gaining the most as imports of investment and \nintermediate goods increased. \nThe current account (including grants) moves from a small surplus to a deficit, which peaks in the outer years at \nabout 2% of GDP, as a result primarily of continued strong growth of capital and intermediate goods imports \nrelated to increasing investment projects. These effects are offset to some extent by strong growth of remittances, \nwhich are projected to grow at an annual average of about 12% and 10% over the medium and long term, \nrespectively. \nThe current trend of declining reliance on external financing of the budget deficit will continue over the medium and \nlong term. The level of foreign grants is assumed to remain unchanged at the current level of $700 million per year \nthroughout the projection period. Gross external financing will increase slowly over the long term to about $4 billion \nper annum from the current level of $2.0 billion \u2212 $2.5 billion. The grant element of external loans will also decline \nover time. \nThe overall fiscal deficit (excluding grants) is assumed to remain close to the historical average (around 4% of \nGDP), while the primary deficit declines slightly over time. A modest rise is assumed in the revenue-to-GDP ratio \n(excluding grants) in the initial years (from 11.5% in FY2008 to 13% in FY2013), supported by efforts to mobilize \ndomestic revenues. Higher revenues will allow for correspondingly higher public sector spending in relation to GDP \nallowing for improved quality of public services. \nReal interest rate on domestic debt is assumed to stay more or less constant at about 5.5%. There is scope for \nreducing the real interest rate significantly, if the authorities initiate major financial sector reforms. If that happens, \nthe debt profile will improve in future, or will release more resources for higher government spending. \nGDP = gross domestic product. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n ", "70  Appendix 8 \n \nB.   External Debt Sustainability Analysis \n \n3.  All  external  debt  indicators  remain  well  below  the  policy-dependent  debt  burden \nthreshold under the baseline scenario.  Given the growing dependence on domestic debt over \ntime and the fiscal deficit at its historical level of about 4% of GDP (excluding grants), external \ndebt in relation to GDP would tend to fall very rapidly (Table A8.1 and Table A8.3). Total public \ndebt in relation to GDP will also fall, albeit at a much slower pace, by 8% points to 34% of GDP \nby FY2028.  \n \nTable A8.1: Total and External Debt in Relation to GDP and Total \nExternal Debt Service in % of Exports and Remittances \nTotal Government  Total External Debt Service \nFiscal  Debt Outstanding  External Debt  (% of exports and \nYear  (% of GDP)  (% of GDP)  remittances) \n2008  42.7  25.4  3.7 \n2009  40.8  23.2  3.9 \n2010  40.8  22.1  3.7 \n2011  40.7  20.6  3.4 \n2012  40.1  19.2  3.1 \n2013  39.1  17.9  2.8 \n2014  38.6  16.7  2.5 \n2015  37.2  15.6  2.3 \n2016  36.6  14.5  2.1 \n2017  36.3  13.6  2.0 \n2018  35.6  12.7  1.8 \n2019  35.2  11.9  1.7 \n2020  34.9  11.2  1.6 \n2021  34.7  10.5  1.5 \n2022  34.5  9.9  1.3 \n2023  34.4  9.3  1.2 \n2024  34.3  8.7  1.1 \n2025  34.2  8.2  1.1 \n2026  34.1  7.7  1.0 \n2027  34.1  7.2  0.9 \n2028  34.1  6.7  0.8 \nGDP = gross domestic product. \nSource: Ministry of Finance. \n \n4.  Bangladesh\u2019s external debt service ratio is already low at less than 4% of export and \nremittance receipts. Given the buoyant trend in export and remittance inflows projected in the \nDSA analysis, external debt service in relation to exports and remittances will decline to less \nthan  1.0%  by  FY2028  (Table  A8.1).  This  scenario  also  assumes  a  reduction  in  the \nconcessionality of external debt as the average interest rate on foreign debt is projected to \nincrease slightly. \n \n5.  Although no present value analysis has been prepared because of a lack of data on the \nconcessionality of individual loans, the analysis prepared by the IMF indicates that the debt \nratios would tend to fall significantly if foreign debt is expressed in net present value terms.

Public Debt Sustainability Analysis \n \n6.  Domestic debt has been relatively stable over the past 5 years. Gross domestic debt has \nremained at about 17% of GDP during the period FY2002 through FY2008. The majority of \ndomestic debt is in the form of treasury bills and savings certificates held by nonbank financial \ninstitutions; and just a quarter is held by the central bank. \n \n7.  The baseline scenario (Table A8.3) entails a steady decline in the public debt-to-GDP \nratio, with external debt declining but domestic debt increasing in relation to GDP. This is the \nnatural outcome of the trend observed in the last two decades, with a growing reliance on \ndomestic financing of the budget deficit. External aid, which was in the range of $2 billion per \nyear in the 1980s, has remained in the same range in nominal terms in recent years. The \noutlook for concessional external financing is also not so favorable. However, the scenario still \nallows for gross external financing of the budget to increase to more than $4 billion by FY2028, \ncompared with the $2.0 - $2.6 billion received in recent years. \n \nD.   Capacity to Pay to ADB \n \n8.  The  Government  of  Bangladesh  has  requested  $500  million  under  the  ADB's \nCountercyclical Support Facility Support Program to help cover its budget financing needs. In \naddition, the Government has also requested for an additional $245 million (approximately) for \nbudget  support.  This  additional  borrowing  by  the  Government  would  increase  the  overall \nexternal debt service payments in the medium term, in particular to ADB. \n \n9.  Analysis presented below (Tables A8.4\u2212A8.6) indicates that while such additional external \nborrowing of $745 million (approximately) will increase interest and amortization payments to ADB \nin the coming years, it will not have any significant adverse impact on Bangladesh\u2019s capacity to \nservice its obligations. In relation to receipts of exports and remittance inflows, total external debt \nservice to ADB (by FY2015) will still be about 1%. In relation to the level of reserves, debt service \npayments to ADB will be below 5% at their peak in FY2014, which would be quite manageable. \n ", " \n7\n2\n \nTable A8.3: Debt Sustainability

Introduction \n \n1.  The monitoring framework of the Public Expenditure Support Facility (PESF) Program \nand the Countercyclical Support Facility (CSF) Support Program is structured around three main \nfeatures: (i) use of baseline indicators already collated during the processing of the Program \n(the PESF and the CSF), (ii) leveraging existing systems and protocols at country level, and (iii) \ncoordination  across  development  partners.  Figure  A10  shows  the  overall  design  of  the \nmonitoring framework. \n \n2.  Use of Baseline Indicators: The design and monitoring frameworks for both the PESF \nand CSF contain baseline indicators already collated. These indicators (listed in Appendix 1 and \nAppendix 2) are benchmarks against which progress will be monitored. \n \n3.  Existing Protocols and Systems at the Asian Development Bank (ADB): ADB at \npresent already has an existing set of activities to monitor the elements of the Program. This \nincludes not only the work of the Bangladesh Resident Mission (BRM) but also other ongoing \nADB-funded interventions.  \n \n(i)  BRM. Over 70% of the portfolio has been delegated to BRM (the highest among \nthe ADB Resident Missions), and there is considerable capacity to maintain a monitoring \nprotocol that will be used to conduct economic surveillance and assess, on a continuing \nbasis, the performance and direction of the Program. This protocol includes: (i) BRM's \nEconomics  Unit,  which  undertakes  regular  monitoring  of  macroeconomic  and  fiscal \ndevelopments and reform progress in the country, and publishes the results in, for \nexample, the Quarterly Economic Update and bimonthly Economic Indicators Update; (ii) \nefforts  of  the  Portfolio  Management  Unit  of  BRM  on  Annual  Development  Plan \nimplementation issues in the context of ongoing ADB projects and programs; and (iii) the \nannual Country Portfolio Review Mission which provide important monitoring milestones. \n \n(ii)  Existing and proposed programs. These include, for example, (i) the proposed \nsmall-scale technical assistance on strengthening macroeconomic and fiscal monitoring \nat  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF);  (ii)  the  Good  Governance  Program,1 which  has \nconducted a vulnerability to corruption assessment in several sectors, including health, \nrailways, port operations, and education; and (iii) Regional Technical Assistance 6445: \nSupport for Implementation of the Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan, \nunder which assistance is provided in the monitoring of governance indicators, including \non service delivery, as part of the work on the National Integrity Strategy. Results from \nthese  assessments  also  serve  as  benchmarks  against  which  the  progress  of  the \nProgram, as applied in these sectors, will be monitored. \n \n4.  Donor Coordination: This is largely done through the local consultative group (LCG), \nwhich  brings  together  development  partners  in  Bangladesh,  including  the  Joint  Strategy \nPartners (World Bank, Japan International Cooperation Agency, Department for International \nDevelopment of the United Kingdom, and ADB). A separate LCG working group on public \nfinancial management is currently being formed which, along with the existing governance \nworking group, will also be involved in helping monitor the broader context of the CSF.

Manila. \n ", "Appendix 10    Appendix 10        77 \n    77 \naddition, there are numerous sector-specific LCG working groups that closely monitor public \nexpenditures in their respective areas of focus that can be drawn upon to assist in the broader \nmonitoring effort. \n \nB.  Proposed Measures  \n \n5.  The proposed monitoring system consists of the following: \n \n(i)  Program steering committee (PSC). The PSC will meet regularly to review the \nprogress of the Program and report it to ADB. There will also be liaison with the \nprivate sector and development partners to solicit their feedback on emerging \npolicies  and  the  impact  of  the  Program.  semi-annual  reviews  of  the \nmacroeconomic and fiscal conditions will also be carried out by the PSC.   \n \n(ii)  Monitoring  macroeconomic  performance.  ADB  will  review  and  assess \ndevelopments in the key macroeconomic indicators presented and described in \nthe Access Criteria Matrix and the design and monitoring framework for the CSF, \nincluding quarterly fiscal data and budget outturns, public debt ratios, external \nbalance and monetary survey. In assessing the macroeconomic performance, it \nwill draw on International Monetary Fund reports on Bangladesh including the \nSelected Issues and its annual Article IV Consultations with the Government, and \nother relevant materials.  \n \n(iii)  Monitoring the Government's countercyclical development program. ADB \nwill monitor and review aggregate budget outturns for the CSF and disbursement \nrates  of  the  key  line ministries  implementing  the  social  safety  net  programs \n(SSNPs).  In  coordination  with  the  MOF,  ADB  will  also  monitor  progress  of \nimplementation of the Government\u2019s countercyclical development program on the \nmajor SSNPs, especially those implemented under the administrative control of \nthe  Ministry  of  Food  and  Disaster  Management,  Ministry  of  Women  and \nChildren's Affairs, and the Local Government Division of the Ministry of Local \nGovernment, Rural Development, Cooperatives. The information will be available \nfrom the Government\u2019s public financial management systems, including reports \nfrom the office of the Controller General of Accounts, a department under on the \nMOF. \n \nC.  Implementation Mechanisms for SSNPs \n \n6.  Policy directives on SSNPs are provided in the budget documents and the directives \nissued by the MOF, while implementation is the responsibility of various line ministries. The \nSSNPs are implemented through the Government's various programs or projects, such as, \nallowances for the destitute women, rehabilitation of physically disabled, 'one household, one \nfarm', employment generation for the hardcore poor, rural roads maintenance program, Test \nRelief, Food for Works Program, vulnerable group development for ultra poor women, micro \ncredit through nongovernment organizations, old age pension, vulnerable group feeding, school \nfeeding  program,  and  rural  road  maintenance  program.  Respective  line  ministries  prepare \nprogram or project documents, which need to be approved by the ministry in consultation with \nthe MOF. Each SSNP is budgeted and its annual allocation is provided in the Government's \nrecurrent or development budget. Line ministry formulates guidelines on the roles of each \nimplementing agency, departmental field offices, district administration and local governments; \nand  on  the  arrangements  for  implementation,  and  also  defines  entitlements  and  benefits. \n ", "78  Appendix 10 \nModality for involving elected local officials, and setting up local level committees for oversight is \nalso determined by the line ministry.  \n \n7.  Food related assistance schemes are implemented by the Ministry of Food and Disaster \nManagement with the assistance of the departments under it, district administration, union \nparishads  (sub-districts)  and  departmental  field  offices.  The  Ministry  of  Food  has  a  well-\nfunctioning and reliable monitoring system to ensure transparency in the procurement and \ndistribution of food grains. The food planning and monitoring unit under the Ministry provides a \ndaily countrywide report on the Public Food Distribution system by collecting data from food \nsilos, ports, and other food warehouses located at the district and sub district level. The Ministry \nof  Food  also  submits quarterly  progress  reports  to  the Finance  Division  of  MOF  covering \nprogress on food distribution through different SSNPs.  \n \n8.  Ministry of Social Welfare is the line ministry, while the Directorate of Social Welfare is \nthe implementing agency for the old-age allowance program. Old-age allowances are delivered \nby the  Ministry, based on the list of eligible recipients prepared by the field administration \nfollowing specified selection criteria. The fund is channeled through five state-owned banks. The \nDirectorate receives reports from the field offices on utilization of funds by the banks. In addition \nto the central monitoring done by the Directorate, arrangements exist for local monitoring by its \nfield offices.  \n \n9.  Employment generation for the hardcore poor is a new program, being implemented by \nthe Ministry of Food and Disaster Management. The field level project implementation units are \nresponsible for fund management, implementation and monitoring.  \n \n10.  The Local Government Division of the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development \nand Cooperatives and the Local Government Engineering Department under it, with support of \nthe union parishads, implement the rural roads maintenance program. Allocations are provided \nthrough the annual budget of the Government and there are guidelines on the implementation \nmodality and roles of different agencies. Destitute women are organized in Labor Contracting \nSocieties and provided the contract to maintain particular rural roads including tree plantation, \nand  they  receive  daily  wages  at  fixed  rates.  Similar  implementation  arrangements  and \nmonitoring systems are there for other safety net programs, including micro credit for small \nincome generating activities. \n \n11.  Release of funds for the SSNPs is subject to compliance with the financial and treasury \nrules of the Government. Accounts are maintained by the government accounts offices and the \nuse of funds is subject to audit by the government audit offices.  \n \n12.  Overall,  there  are  established  procedures,  controls,  and  systems  to  implement  all \nSSNPs. ADB will use the measures described above to monitor their performance. \n \n ", "Appendix 10    Appendix 10        79 \n    79 \nFigure A10: Monitoring Framework for the Program \n \n  Features: (i) baseline indicators already collated for the PESF and the CSF; (ii) leveraging off of existing protocols and systems; (iii) \n  coordination across development partners (through the LCG) \n \n \nFeatures: (i) semi-annual progress reports on macroeconomic and fiscal conditions; (ii) \n  consultative meetings with private sector and DPs; (iii) MOF to maintain all monitoring data   \n \nProgram  Steering \n \nCommittee (PSC) \n  BRM   (i) Economic surveillance; (ii) Portfolio Management Unit; (iii) \n  CPRM; (iv) work of Economics Unit and Governance Unit\n \nOrganizational \n  ADB \n \n(i) Good Governance Program; (ii) RETA 6445; (iii) SSTA on \n   \nOther  strengthening economic monitoring and surveillance\n  programs\n \n  Government  Ministry  of  Food  and  Disaster  Management;  Ministry  of  Women  and  Children's  Affairs; \nMinistry of Local Government, Rural Development, and Cooperatives\n \n \nMacroeconomic and fiscal monitoring, as well as monitoring of PPPs, based on data from, \n  among others, Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, MOF, Planning Commission, Bangladesh \n  Bank, Ministry of Planning, Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce and Industry, etc. \n \n(i) Review and assess developments in macroeconomic indicators in the Access Criteria \nMatrix and the DMF, including quarterly fiscal data and budget outturns, public debt ratios, \nMacroeconomic \nexternal balance and monetary survey; (ii) draw on IMF reports on Bangladesh including the \nperformance \nSelected Issues and its annual Article IV Consultations with the Government, etc. \nCounterpart  funds  for:  revenue  mobilization  measures,  reforming  financial  management \nprocesses and application of MTBF, strengthening the funding and implementation of PPPs, \nUsage  of  PESF  and delivery of social safety nets \nFocus of  funds  A\n(i) ADB to monitor and review aggregate budget outturns for CSF and disbursement rates of  p\nmonitoring  Countercyclical  key line ministries implementing SSNPs; (ii) ADB to also monitor progress of implementation  pe\nn\n  development  of the Government\u2019s countercyclical development program on the major SSNPs; (iii) reports  d\nix\nprogram  from the office of the Controller General of Accounts   1\n0\n  \n \n \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CPRM = Country Portfolio Review Mission, CSF = Countercyclical Support Facility, DMF = design and monitoring framework, DP =    \n \ndevelopment partner, IMF = International Monetary Fund, LCG = local consultative group, MOF = Ministry of Finance, MTBF = medium-term budgetary framework, PESF =  7\n9\nPublic Expenditure Support Facility, PPP = public-private partnership, PSC = program steering committee, RETA = regional technical assistance, SSNP = small-scale   \ntechnical assistance, SSTA = short-term technical assistance.  \n ", "80  Appendix 11  Appendix 12     \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \nCountry and Project Title: Bangladesh: Public Expenditure Support Facility Program and \nCountercyclical Support Facility Support Program \n \nLending/Financing  Policy-Based Program  Department/  South Asia Department/ \nModality:  Countercyclical Support  Division:  Financial Sector, and Public \nFacility   Management and Trade Division \n       \nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe proposed Program (PESF and CSF) is harmonized with the Government\u2019s National Strategy for \nAccelerated Poverty Reduction II (NSAPR II) and the Bangladesh Country Partnership Strategy \n(CPS) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The NSAPR II reaffirms that reducing poverty and \naccelerating the pace of social development are the most important long-term strategic goals for \nBangladesh. The NSAPR II aims to halve the number of poor people by 2015, and to achieve \nsubstantial improvement in all aspects of human development. The Program will provide assistance \nto the Government for implementing its social safety net programs (SSNPs), its primary tools for \npoverty reduction. The improved investment climate would lead to higher investment on power and \nenergy, transport, and urban services. ADB support will also foster macroeconomic stability by \nreducing the need for inflationary domestic borrowing (which is also costlier) and preventing crowding \nout  of  private  investment.  By  improving  public  financial  management  (PFM),  the  Program  will \nincrease the efficiency of public spending and create more fiscal space for spending that benefit the \npoor. Through these activities, the Program will help maintain satisfactory economic growth and \naddress poverty concerns of the vulnerable segments of the population.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                   Targeting Classification: Targeted Intervention (TI-M) \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nBangladesh has made mixed progress in reducing poverty. From 2000 to 2005, the depth and \nseverity of poverty declined simultaneously both in urban and rural areas. However, the number of \npeople living below the hardcore poor poverty line increased to 27 million in 2005 from 24.9 million in \n2000. The most severe poverty is located in urban slums and in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. Just less \nthan 20% of the population falls into the category of extreme poverty (lacking resources to acquire a \nminimum dietary intake). From 1991 to 2005, the poverty reduction rate per year was 1.3% points. \nHowever, from 2000 to 2005 income poverty declined from 48.9% to 40% (or 1.8% points annually, \non average). \nAdverse impacts in the export sector stemming from the global economic crisis will directly affect \npoverty via employment losses and wage cuts. With more than 2.2 million workers and equal number \nof workers employed in ancillary activities, a slowdown of ready-made-garment exports will translate \ninto widespread poverty both in urban and rural areas. As the majority of ready-made-garment \nworkers are female, a crisis in the ready-made-garment sector will have substantial poverty impacts. \nFurthermore, a deceleration in gross domestic product (GDP) growth and contagion of the crisis to \nother sectors will push a vast pool of the laborers and their families below the poverty line. Small and \nmedium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are disproportionately vulnerable to global economic crises; this \npotentially has huge poverty implications. A slowdown in income growth will hit existing poor people\u2014\nconsisting of a variety of vulnerable groups, mostly the elderly, children, and women\u2014hardest. \n \nLikewise, a fall in remittance inflows will result in direct income loss to recipient households. For many \nhouseholds in rural areas, remittance earnings are the main source of income and livelihood. A fall in \nremittance income will directly affect consumption and the nutritional status of many rural families. \nBecause of higher linkage effects, the poverty impacts of a fall in remittance income will have an \namplified effect on overall poverty incidence.    \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 11  81 \nA slowdown of economic activities will severely squeeze the Government's fiscal space. Given the \nuncertain aid inflow, fiscal revenue will be insufficient to finance poverty-related expenditures\u2014\nparticularly targeted social safety net programs (SSNPs).  \n \n2.  Design Features \n \nDesign features of the  Program that will help reduce poverty directly or indirectly include: \n \n(i)  Financial support to the Government to reduce the fiscal pressure on the budget arising from \nexpanded SSNPs. By reducing the financing gap, the Program will directly contribute to mitigating the \npotential adverse impacts of the global economic crisis on poverty by enhancing access to food and \nemployment opportunities, as envisioned in the SSNPs.  \n(ii)  The Program will support the Government\u2019s efforts to encourage greater private investment in \ninfrastructure, accelerate public infrastructure project implementation, and improve social service \ndelivery to maximize pro-poor growth. By mitigating the adverse impacts of the global crisis on fiscal \nspace to finance pro-poor development activities and promoting basic social service delivery and \ninfrastructure  spending,  the  Program  will  also  positively  contribute  to  income  acceleration  and \nemployment. \n \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis  \n \n1.  Discuss the impact channels of the policy reform(s) (direct and indirect, short and medium term) to \nthe country and major groups affected. \n \nThe Program will support the Government's immediate actions to mitigate the impacts of the global \ncrisis on the poor and vulnerable groups. They will also support reforms for enhancing pro-poor \ngrowth and improve living standards in the medium term. The poverty impact will be reflected in two \nparticular streams: (i) in the short term, budgetary support will help fill the financing gap stemming \nfrom global-crisis-related revenue shocks, which will allow critical public expenditure programs to \nremain  in  place  or  be  strengthened\u2014in  particular,  SSNPs;  and  (ii)  maintaining  macroeconomic \nstability will stimulate private investment and promote faster economic growth in the medium term\u2014\nthereby enabling the creation of an effective social safety net system that benefits poor and vulnerable \ngroups, and ultimately helps the country attain its poverty reduction goals. \n \n2.  Discuss the impact of the policy reform(s) on vulnerable groups and ways to address it/them (refer \nto social analysis). \n \nImproving and scaling up safety net operations will ensure increased access to food and social \nservices for the poor and help to also cover people previously non poor who are hurt by the crisis. \nMechanisms will be put in place that creates opportunities for poor and vulnerable people to be \ninformed about the benefits they are entitled to, and to claim their rights. Preparing a comprehensive \nlist of hardcore poor and vulnerable populations will also lead to improved targeting and effectiveness \nof SSNPs. The establishment of a reliable food security system will help to protect against food \ninflation and improve access for the poor.  \n \nIn addition, scaled-up infrastructure investment and a fiscal stimulus package will help reduce the risk \nof unemployment and income loss in the immediate term, and also enhance longer-term growth. \nCloser performance monitoring will strengthen accountability on the use of public resources and. \nreduce the scope for irregularities or corruption. Microcredit programs for women entrepreneurs and \nsupport for SMEs will contribute to make growth more inclusive.  \n \n3.  Discuss how the policy reform(s) contribute(s) to poverty reduction, pro-poor growth, and the \nMillennium Development Goals. \n \nThe Program\u2019s support of SSNPs will create fiscal space which will enable the Government to scale \nup infrastructure investment and implement a fiscal stimulus package while ensuring the continued \nflow of credit to the private sector. These actions will help reduce the risk of unemployment and \n ", "82  Appendix 11  Appendix 12     \nincome loss in the immediate term, and also enhance longer-term growth. Closer performance \nmonitoring will strengthen accountability on the use of public resources and. reduce the scope for \nirregularities or corruption. Providing support to improve the business environment is part of the \nGovernment's holistic approach to promoting private sector development and pro-poor growth. \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThe Bangladesh economy has been severely impacted by the global crisis. The coming months will \nsee the effects of the crisis compounded. Already overseas workers are returning home and export \norders  are  slowing.  The  resultant  drop  in  remittances,  migration,  and  exports  of  ready-made \ngarments  will  slow  economic  growth,  drive  down  household  incomes,  and  lead  to  rising \nunemployment in the formal and informal sectors. \n \nAt  the  household  level,  the  economic  downturn  is  reducing  job  opportunities,  incomes,  and \npurchasing power. This is forcing households to seek alternative work, mainly as casual laborers at \nreduced real wages. Opportunities for wage employment\u2014the top priority for the poor\u2014are already \ndecreasing. If the poor are earning less, the risk increases that they will fall into debt and/or be unable \nto afford proper healthcare, education, food intake, nutrition, or other vital services. Even though food \nprices have declined, the largest share of the average household budget is still spent on food (52%). \nLower income could force poor households to cut food spending, which could affect nutrition status \nand have long term adverse effects on health.  \n \nMicrofinance institutions that rely on commercial funding may face refinancing threats; this risk could \nbe magnified if donors reduce their support. Other potential social consequences are malnutrition, \nmorbidity,  frustration,  social  tension,  and  deterioration  of  law  and  order\u2014all  of  which  carry \nunquantifiable  costs.  Employment,  income,  availability  of  food  in  markets,  efficient  delivery  of \nservices, affordability of goods and services are all important issues. \n   \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nThe Program, processed in response to the economic crisis, was conceived by ADB jointly with the \nGovernment of Bangladesh (the Government). The needs assessment and consultation schedule \nwere drawn up jointly with the Government, with inputs from other development partners and relevant \nstakeholders. Components of the Program were designed after extensive consultation with the \nMinistry of Finance and the Ministry of Food and Disaster Management. As part of its CPS midterm \nreview, ADB discussed the idea of the Program (especially the PESF) with civil society, academic, \nand private sector representatives. Regular interaction with various agencies continued during the \npreparation phase. ADB's proposed support for strengthening safety nets for the poor and vulnerable \nwas supported by stakeholders. In addition, mechanisms to ensure benefits for the poor and for \nwomen through improved delivery of SSNPs, including through employment guarantee and food \nsecurity schemes, as well as support for SMEs and women entrepreneurs, were also discussed. \nDonors  thought  that  ADB's  support  was  useful  to  create  greater  fiscal  space  for  additional \ncountercyclical expenditures that could avert a sharper reduction in growth and employment. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation \nand monitoring?  \n   Information sharing       Consultation       Collaborative decision making     Empowerment \n \n ", "  Appendix 11  83 \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?    Yes      No  \n \nIf a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan \n(including budget, consultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \n \nThe Program was processed quickly to provide budgetary support to the Government, thus a full-\nfledged C&P plan was not prepared. However, a short C&P Plan has been prepared (Supplementary \nAppendix J) The plan includes the objectives and methods of involvement of various stakeholders in \nstrengthening and scaling up existing SSNPs to benefit the poor, women, and other vulnerable \ngroups. Local government institutions will be involved in implementing the SSNPs. Nongovernment \norganizations will be involved in identifying beneficiaries and in delivering and monitoring some old \nand new SSNPs.   \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.   Key Issues \n \nWomen generally face the challenges of managing households' food security and nutritional needs. \nDuring economic crises, they face an enormous challenge in managing their households' food supply. \nAccording to the International Labour Organization, the global crisis will plunge a huge number of \nwomen into unemployment and push them into insecure jobs. Women make up a majority of the \nexport manufacturing workforce, but concentrate mostly in insecure, low-wage, low-skill jobs. Women \nwho have migrated to urban areas and abroad are also being hard hit by the crisis. Their wages and \nremittances  are  important  sources  of  family  income.  Overseas  workers  are  returning  home  in \nincreasing numbers, affecting the family food security situation. Female garment workers are still \nreeling from last years' food crisis, and their situation is worsening. Though experts predict that the \nBangladesh economy will see few factory closures or job cuts, the pricing advantage in the garment \nsector over competitors will count little as demand for Bangladesh's exports in the West is shrinking. \nA drop in export prices would put pressure on workers' wages, the majority of whom are women. \nEmployers often exploit the low bargaining power of women to evade statutory labor rights, like \nsigning redundancy letters to avoid payment of severance benefits and replacement of regular \nemployees  by  casual  workers.  Enterprises  not  cutting  jobs  are  trying  to  cut  wages,  overtime \npayments, subsidized meals, transport, and other such benefits. The potential refinancing threat to \nmicrofinance  institutions  that  rely  on  commercial  funding  may  cause  problems  in  microfinance \noperations, affecting household food security and livelihoods where the majority of beneficiaries are \nwomen.   \n \nLacking  unemployment  insurance  and  cash  benefits,  unemployed  women  will  quickly  become \ndestitute. Often women sell their assets and resort to money lenders for survival. Female-headed \nhouseholds suffer the most from loss of income and employment. Family health and nutritional needs \nare  often  sacrificed,  resulting  in  long-lasting  negative  effects  on  their  children's  lives.  Often \nhouseholds cope by reducing the number of meals per day they feed their family, or reducing the \nquality of their diet. Women often forgo their own nutrition to ensure that other family members get \nenough to eat. This practice ends up severely affecting their own health. As Government revenues \nshrink and deficits rise, expenditures on SSNPs to protect households living in poverty will decline \nunless external aid is increased. \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: The proposed loans will allow the Government to maintain \nSSNPs focusing on poor households (especially households headed by women, who constitute the \nmajority of the poor population). The Government's annual budget for FY2010 allocates $2.5 billion \nfor SSNPs; about 83% of this will go toward social protection programs targeting mainly poor women. \nThe Program will allow the Government to generate 5 million person-months of work in rural areas; \nagain women will be the main beneficiaries. Budget support to preserve macroeconomic stability and \nstimulate private investment will also benefit poor and vulnerable groups by creating an environment \nfor additional employment in the private sector and infrastructure. \n \n ", "84  Appendix 11  Appendix 12     \n \n2.  Key Actions \n \n    Gender plan          Other actions/measures          No action/measure \n \nThe Program will contribute to the Government's plan to scale up SSNPs to cover 96 million beneficiaries \nwith livelihood support. The key indicators will be the number of women covered under social SSNPs, the \nnumber of women trained under various schemes, and access to work opportunities. The Program will \nmonitor the increase in coverage of vulnerable people by SSNPs (FY2009 estimated baseline: 72 million \npeople). The Government, assisted by development partners, has developed a strategy to monitor the \neffectiveness and reach of most ongoing SSNPs. The Government will soon finalize a plan to prepare a \nlist of hardcore poor that will serve as the basis for better targeting and monitoring. \n \nThe Government's initiatives to improve public financial management and the investment climate, and \nto create better mechanisms for SSNPs, will also benefit women. \n \nIII.
