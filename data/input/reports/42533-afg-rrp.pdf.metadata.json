The  Project  represents  a  first  phase \nof  a  larger  rail  network  planned  across  the  north  and  other  parts  of \nthe  country,  including  links  to  Herat,  Tajikistan,  and  Pakistan.  It  will \nexpand  the  existing  transport  network  in  Afghanistan  and  improve \nsubstantially  internal  and  international  connectivity.  The  Project  is \npart  of  the  Transport  Strategy  and  Action  Plan  agreed  under  the \nCentral  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC)  Program.  It \nwill add capacity to two transport corridors under CAREC and open \nup alternative routes of supply for national and international trade, as \nwell as for humanitarian relief to Afghanistan. \n \nThe  Project  has  two  components:  (i)  design  and  construction  of \n75  km  single-line  railway  and  associated \ninfrastructure;  and \n(ii)  project  management,  independent  supervision,  and  institutional \nsupport. The Project will be executed through a fixed price and fixed \ntime  delivery  engineering,  procurement,  and  construction  (EPC) \nturnkey  contract.  Once  constructed,  tested,  and  commissioned,  the \nrail service will be managed by an operator under an operation and \nmaintenance contract. \n \nThe  Project  has  strong  rationale.  First,  it  will  develop  a  reliable, \nefficient,  safe,  and  sustainable  transport  link  within  the  country  and \nbetween the country and its neighbors. Hairatan already doubles up \nas  Afghanistan's  most  important  dry  and  river  port,  acting  as  the \ngateway \nimports.  Key \ncommodities  and  goods  moving  through  this  point  include  oil  and \nfuel,  wheat  and  flour,  fertilizer,  construction  materials  such  as \ncement  and  bitumen,  agricultural  and  off-highway  equipment  and \nconsumer  goods.  Hairatan  is  also  a  largest  port  for  the  supply  of \nhumanitarian  relief  to  Afghanistan.  However,  the  existing  transport \ninfrastructure  and \nfacilities  at  Hairatan  cannot  cope  with  an \nexpanding  volume  of  trade  and  humanitarian  relief.  An  existing  rail \nline between Termez in Uzbekistan and Hairatan does not have a rail \nlink into Afghanistan. Freight  destined  for  Afghanistan  and  beyond \n\nfor  almost  half  of  Afghanistan's \n\ntotal \n\nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nProject Description \n\nRationale \n\n \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \n\nto \n\nfinanced  by \n\nthe  Ring  Road  being \n\nhas  to  be  off-loaded  and  reloaded  into  trucks  at  this  border.  This  is \nboth  slow  and  extremely  costly.  Moreover,  other  established  trade \nand  supply  routes  servicing  Afghanistan  are  disrupted  because  of \nsecurity  constraints.  The  Termez\u2013Hairatan  railway  line  helps  but \nAfghanistan  and  other  Central  Asian  countries  would  benefit  if  this \nwere  to  be  extended  into  Mazar-e-Sharif  \u2013  ending  at  the  airport \nthere,  which  is  being  expanded  with  German  assistance,  and \nconnecting \nthe  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). This expanded rail line will remove major \ncritical  physical  bottlenecks  at  the  border,  quadrupling  capacity  and \nultimately aiding regional trade. \n \nA second important feature of the Project is its strong strategic and \nlogistical  content  to  countries  in  Central  Asia.  Afghanistan  is  the \nnatural  transit  route  to reach  ports in  Pakistan and  the  Caspian,  for \nthe onward sale of goods to South and East Asia, Middle East, and \nEurope.  The  railway  line  cuts  bottlenecks  at  Hairatan,  raises  the \nprofile  of  Afghanistan  as  a  transit  route  and  complements  the \nconnectivity  improvements  arising  out  of  the  two  CAREC  corridors \n(3 and 6), now under construction.  \n \nThe  Project  fits  well  with  the  Government's  development  strategy \nand  ADB's  Country  Partnership  Strategy  for  2009\u20132013.  The  latter \nflags transport as a priority area for assistance. The Project also fits \nwell  with  the  CAREC  Transport  and  Trade  Facilitation  Strategy  and \nthe Action Plan. \n \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  in  line  with  ADB's  approach  to \nengaging with weakly performing countries.  \n \nThe Project will lead to greater economic growth and increased trade \nbetween  Afghanistan  and  the  region.  The  outcome  will  be  a  more \nefficient, safer, and sustainable railway transport network in northern \nAfghanistan,  resulting  in  increased  transport  volumes  and  reduced \ntransport  costs.  The  Project  underpins  regional  cooperation  and \nintegration in Central Asia. \n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \n\nProject Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\n \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost is estimated at $170 million equivalent. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nItem \n1.

This will have \na fixed price and fixed time delivery date, with appropriate penalties \nand  premiums.  All  technical  specifications  have  been  determined \nupfront.  These  will  guide \nfinal  design  and  construction. \nAn independent consultant will oversee the EPC contract, tests and \ncommissioning  and  quality  standards.  Payments  will  be  staggered \nand based on performance. An appropriate amount of funding will be \nretained  until  after  tests  and  commissioning.  Once  the  line  is \nconstructed,  tested,  and  accepted,  the  Government  will  sign  an \noperation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  contract  with  the  same  EPC \ngroup. This contract will also be performance based, and be subject \nto independent supervision and validation. Appropriate arrangements \nto  solve  disputes  between  the  parties  feature  in  the  two  contracts. \nADB  will  provide  the  required  technical  assistance  to  oversee  the \nexecution  of  the  Project,  and  subsequent  to  that,  its  management. \nHeadquarters and ADB Afghanistan Resident Mission staff will assist \nwith  project \nimplementation.  A  detailed  project  administration \nmemorandum has been prepared. \n \nThe  Government  will  establish  an  executive  committee  to  oversee \nthe  work,  with  representatives  from  the  ministries  of  finance,  public \ntransport  and  civil  aviation. \nworks,  commerce  and \nThe executive committee will be chaired by a minister-level official. \n \nA  project  implementation  unit  will  be  set  up  in  Mazar-e-Sharif.  ADB \nwill consider opening an extended mission in Mazar-e-Sharif for the \npurposes of this Project, and the completion of the Ring Road.  \n \nProcurement  of  civil  works,  goods, and  services  financed under  the \nADB  grant  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB  Procurement \nGuidelines.  The  EPC  contract,  and  later  the  O&M  mandate,  will  be \nawarded to a group from a member country of ADB. However, given \nthat the railway gauge  will be based on the Uzbekistan system, the \ntracks  required  for  construction  (and  maintenance),  will  need  to  be \nprocured \nthat  are  not  ADB  members.  The \nGovernment  therefore  requests  an  ADB  waiver  to allow for the \n\nfrom  countries \n\nindustry, \n\n \n\nProcurement \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nprocurement  of  track  components  from  nonmember  countries.  Due \ndiligence conducted by ADB indicates that, in this case, these track \ncomponents  can  be  more  quickly  procured  at  more  competitive \nprices from nonmember countries. \n \nIt  is  proposed  that  Uzbekistan  Temir  Yullari  (Uzbekistan's  Railway \nCompany, or UTY) be awarded two contracts: (i) an EPC contract for \ndesign and construction, and (ii) an O&M contract. \n \nDirect contracting to UTY is justified on the following grounds. First, \nthe  railway  line  is  a  de  facto  extension  of  the  current  Uzbekistan \nrailway  network  into  Mazar-e-Sharif.  This  is  based  on  the  current \nUzbekistan gauge system. Using the Uzbekistan system for this first \nphase of the rail network has considerable financial and operational \nlogic.  It  does  not  require  new  rolling  stock  and  the  management  of \nUTY  is  both  experienced  and  proven.  However,  this  approach  also \nmakes  the  project  potentially  less  attractive  to  other  contractors  in \nthe region since they would be unfamiliar with the system. \n \nSecond, UTY is the only company in the region with the track record \nto  design,  procure,  and  construct  a  railway  line  based  on  the \nUzbekistan system. UTY is also the sole operator of the Uzbekistan \nrail  network.  UTY  is  familiar  with  conditions  on  the  ground,  first  for \nconstruction and then for operations and maintenance. There are no \ncomparable operators in the region or beyond it, with the same track \nrecord. \n \nThird,  UTY  has  already  preliminary  designs  for  the  line.  These  are \nbased  on  past  work  commissioned  directly  by  the  Government  of \nAfghanistan.  This  design  work  increases  project  readiness  and \nsaves  considerable  time  and  costs.  It  accelerates  implementation, \nwhich in turn translates faster into fewer bottlenecks to trade.  \n \nFourth,  UTY  has  designed  and  executed  ADB-assisted  railway \nprojects in the past, including the railway link between Tashkent and \nSamarkand. The proposed Project has been given top priority by the \nmost  senior  authorities  in  Uzbekistan.  It  also  fits  with  UTY's  current \nproject  construction  pipeline.  The  company  has  sufficient  financial \nresources  to  implement  an  operation  of  this  nature,  and  the  right \npeople and skills to manage it later.  \n \nFifth,  an  extension  of  the  Uzbekistan  network  into  Mazar-e-Sharif \nmeans  Afghanistan  does  not  have  to  invest  or  lease  new  rolling \nstock  or  spare  parts.  This  cut  costs,  but  only  if  UTY  is  part  of  the \nto \npackage.  The  Uzbekistan  government \noutsource  to  a  third  party  the  management  of  Uzbekistan  trains \nrunning from Hairatan to Mazar-e-Sharif. Linking the EPC contract to \nthe  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  service  saves  costs  and \nensures  efficiency,  yielding  major  financial  and  logistical  benefits  to \nall parties. \n \n\nis  unlikely \n\nto  want \n\n\f \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries  \n\n \n\nv\n\nSixth,  ADB's  experience  in  Afghanistan  suggests  that  on  average \nonly  one  company  tends  to  bid  for  a  construction  contract.  Poor \nsecurity,  high  costs,  and  other  considerations  account  for  this.  This \npractice  has  not  resulted  in  much  competition  or  cost  savings  to \nAfghanistan.  Most  contractors  know  in  advance  the  size  of  the \nfinancing package and often submit bids close to that or even above. \nIn addition, the procurement process often takes a long time, and in \nseveral  instances  has  involved  retenders.  The  result  has  been  late \nstart-ups and slow project implementation. These delays have often \nled  to  changes  in  project  scope,  cost  overruns,  and  contract \nrenegotiations.  If  UTY  were  to  bid  for  the  Project,  it  is  likely  that  it \nwould be the only group doing so. On the other hand, if it were not to \nbid,  then  the  Government  would  have  to  secure  the  services  of \nanother  contractor.  But  such  contractor  would  effectively  have  to \nstart  from  scratch  with  the  design  work\u2014and  later  find  ways  to \naccess  information  from  Uzbekistan  on  the  gauge  and  operational \nsystem.  This  access  is  not  automatically  guaranteed,  putting  the \nproject  implementation  schedule  at  risk.  Finally,  a  third  party \ncontractor would not likely be able to operate Uzbekistan trains since \nthis is the exclusive mandate of UTY. \n \nThe  Project  will  require  210  person-months  (110  person-months \ninternational  and  100  person-months  national  and  regional)  of \nconsulting  services.  This  comprises  (i)  about  200  person-months \n(100  person-months  international  and  100  person-months  national \nand  regional)  from  an  international  firm  to  oversee  design  and \nconstruction  work;  and \nindividual \ninternational  advisory  services \nrailway  sector,  project \nmanagement,  reporting  and  institutional  development.  Consultants \nwill be selected and engaged according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants and the procurement plan agreed with ADB. The \nconsulting firm will be selected using ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based \nselection procedures and be subject to full technical proposals. \n \nCategory  B.  An  initial  environmental  examination  was  prepared \n(Supplementary  Appendix  E)  and  is  summarized  in  Supplementary \nAppendix F. \n \nThe Project will expand the transport network in Afghanistan and the \nregion and generate immediate benefits to freight operators, traders, \nbusinesses,  and  local  communities.  The  Project  has  some  gender \ncontent.  It  can  create  job  opportunities  but  also  reduce  health  risks \nassociated with current road  truck  operations (HIV/AIDS  vectors).  The \nrail  line  will  replace  some  road-based  cargo.  The  Project  will  cut \ntransport  costs  in  the  region  and  Afghanistan,  and  generate  time \nsavings  by  unlocking  current  logistics  and  transport  bottlenecks  at \nthe  Hairatan  marshalling  yard.  This  will  increase  truck  productivity \nand \nthe  profile  of \nAfghanistan as a transit route, make it easier to deliver humanitarian \nrelief  and  complement  other  modes  of  transport,  including  two \nCAREC  transport   corridors and  the soon to be expanded airport at \n\ntransport  capacity.  The  Project  will  raise \n\n(ii)  10  person-months  of \n\nfor \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\nMazar-e-Sharif.  The  Project  is  financially  sound  and  its  economic \ninternal  rate  of  return  is  estimated  at  15%.  Sensitivity  tests \ndemonstrate  the  Project  to  be  robust  across  a  broad  range  of  key \nparameter variations. \n \nThe  Project  assumes  maximum  coordination  efforts  by  Government \nagencies in Afghanistan, and the full commitment and support of the \nBalkh  Provincial  government, \nlocal  communities,  and  security \ninstitutions. Moreover, it is assumed that the Government will sustain \npolicies  conducive  to  economic  growth  and  remain  committed  to \nregional cooperation and integration.  \n \ntwo  major  potential  risks:  (i)  start-up  and \nThe  Project  has \nimplementation  delays,  and  (ii)  security.  The  Government  plans \nstrong measures to mitigate these risks. Advance actions are being \nbeen taken to speed up implementation readiness. The engagement \nof supervision consultants is already underway and discussions have \ntaken  place  with  UTY  on  basic  EPC  contract  terms  and  conditions, \nincluding  quality  standards,  the  fixed  price  concept,  and  fixed  time \ndelivery schedule. A request for a proposal from UTY has also been \nadvanced,  a  final  commitment  being  subject  to  formal  approvals  of \nthe financing, and other arrangements, by ADB and the Government \nof  Afghanistan.  ADB  will  act  throughout  as  a  facilitator,  including  at \nthe negotiations between the Government and UTY, and will engage \nthe  services  of  an  independent  railway  expert  to  verify  the  price \nproposals  by  UTY.  Implementation  delay  risks  can  be  mitigated  by \nthe  EPC  contract  and  the  fact  that  UTY  has  already  preliminary \ndesigns. This can reduce the risk of cost overruns and will lower the \nprobability  of  execution  extensions.  On  security,  the  Project  will \nprovide  sufficient  funds  to  mitigate  possible  security  disruptions \nduring  implementation.  Close  coordination  with  the  Ministry  of \nInterior has taken place.  \n \nActions  are  also  planned  to  mitigate  operational  risks.  A  railway \nagency  will  be  set  up  during  the  implementation  phase  to  manage \nthe rail assets and ensure their financial sustainability. An advisor will \nbe  engaged  to  prepare  an  operation  and  maintenance  agreement \nbetween  the  Government  and  UTY,  which  will  be  finalized  and \nsigned  before  Project  completion.  ADB  will  assist  with  this  contract \nnegotiation,  including  its  operational  criteria  and  basic  terms  and \nconditions.  The  agreement  will  cover  performance  benchmarks, \nmaintenance, risk sharing, and other arrangements between the two \nparties. \n \n\n\fAFGHANISTAN\nHAIRATAN TO MAZAR-E-SHARIF RAILWAY PROJECT\n\nUZBEKISTAN\n\nHairatan\n\nr\n\ne\n\nA m i r   R i v\n\nStart Point\n(Friendship Bridge)\n\nNIMRUZ\n\nKANDAHAR\n\nH A I R A TA N\n\n64  00'Eo\n\n72  00'Eo\n\nTAJIKISTAN\n\nTURKMENISTAN\n\nHairatan\n\nJOWZJAN\nMazar-e-Sharif\n\nFARYAB\n\nBADAKHSHAN\n\nUZBEKISTAN\n\nKUNDUZ\n\nTAKHAR\n\nBALKH\n\nBAGHLAN\n\nSAMANGAN\n\nPANJSHIR\n\nSAR-E-PUL\n\nBADGHIS\nAFGHANISTAN\n\nBAMYAN\n\nKAPISA\n\nNURISTAN\n\nKONAR\n\nPARWAN\nKABUL\nWARDAK\n\nLAGHMAN\n\nKABUL\n\nNANGARHAR\n\nGHOR\n\nDAIKONDI\n\nLOGAR\n\nPAKTIA\n\nGHAZNI\n\nKHOST\n\n36  00'No\n\nI R A N\n\nHERAT\n\n32  00'No\n\nFARAH\n\nORUZGAN\n\nZABOL\n\nPAKTIKA\n\nPAKISTAN\n\n32  00'No\n\n36  00'No\n\nHELMAND\n\n64  00'Eo\n\n72  00'Eo\n\nDawlatabad\n\nB A L K H\n\nN\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nKilometers\n\nD A W L A TA B A D\n\nB A L K H\n\nBalkh\n\nK A L D A R\n\nAlignment for the\nProposed Rail Line from\n   Hairatan to Mazar-e-Sharif (near Airport)\nTotal Lenght: 75 km (approx.)\nTake off Point: South End of\n   Friendship Bridge (km 0.00)\n\nH\n\na\n\ni\nr\n\na\n\nt\n\na\n\nn\n\n-\n\nN\n\na\n\ni\n\nb\n\na\n\nb\n\na\n\nd\n\n \n\nR\n\no\n\na\n\nd\n\nBuild-Up Area\n\nNational Capital\n\nProvincial Capital\n\nCity/Town\n\nProject Railway\n\nRing Road\n\nNational Highway\n\nProvincial Road\n\nOther Road\n\nPower Transmission Line\n\nRiver\n\nDistrict Boundary\n\nProvincial Boundary\n\nInternational Boundary\n\nN A H R E  S H A H I\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\n0\n9\n-\n1\n6\n5\n4\n \nH\nR\n\nE M M A M\n\nD E H D A D I\n\nDehdadi\n\nMazar-e-Sharif \n\nNahre Shahi\n\nR I N G   R O A D\n\nAirport\n\nGur-e-Mar\n\nEnd Point\n\nNaibabad\n\nN A I B A B A D\n\nR\n\nI\n\nN\n\nG\n\n \n\nR\n\nO\n\nA\n\nD\n\nKholm\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit,  for  your  approval,  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \ngrant to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for the Hairatan to Mazar-e-Sharif Railway Project \n(the Project). The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nTrade.  Intraregional  trade  is  growing  but  remains  seriously  constrained  because  of \nlimited  transport  infrastructure  and  facilities.  Trade  is  increasing  between  Afghanistan  and \nPakistan, Iran, and Central Asia. Annual growth rates exceed 10%. Total trade is now valued at \n$3.5  billion,  of  which  $500  million  are  exports  and  $3  billion  imports.  Volume  imports  exceed  \n2 million tons. Afghanistan is the crucial link for Central Asia to access South Asian markets. It \nis also a conduit to access warm-water ports in Pakistan and on the Caspian Sea for trade with \nEurope  and  the  Middle  East.  Fostering  regional  connectivity  will  help  countries  increase \ninvestment, trade, and employment. \n \n3. \nMost  border  roads  connecting  Afghanistan  with  Uzbekistan,  Iran,  Pakistan,  Tajikistan, \nand Turkmenistan are in bad shape. The Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program \n(CAREC)2 has  a  strategy  and  action  plan  for  six  transport  corridors  across  the  region  and  the \ndevelopment of railway networks in selected countries. These rail networks will complement the \nroad  corridors  and,  in  many  instances,  feed  into  port  and  airport  networks.  A  priority  railway \nnetwork under CAREC is in Afghanistan. This has three main sections: (i) Hairatan to Mazar-e-\nSharif, (ii) Mazar-e-Sharif to Herat, and (iii) Mazar-e-Sharif to Tajikistan. Later, other routes will \ninclude  Chaman,  border  line  between  Pakistan  and  Afghanistan,  to  Kandahar.  A  railway  line \nbetween  Sangan  in  Iran  and  Herat  is  under  construction  with  Iranian  assistance.  The  first \nsection  of  the  northern  network  will  be  a  new  railway  line  from  Afghanistan  border  town  of \nHairatan  to  Mazar-e-Sharif.  This  is  a  top  Government  priority  and  fits  well  with  the  CAREC \nTransport  and  Trade  Facilitation  Strategy  and  ADB's  country  partnership  strategy  for  2009\u2013\n2013.3 The sections from Mazar-e-Sharif to Herat and from Mazar-e-Sharif to Tajikistan are also \npriorities,  but  these  are  more  medium  term  propositions  as  they  will  cost  more  and  involve \nsignificant resettlement. These routes will become more economic once the Ring Road financed \nby the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is completed. \n \nRoad  and  railway  network.  Afghanistan\u2019s  current  transport  network  has  roads,  rail, \n4. \nairports, and inland waterways. The official road network is 38,500 kilometers (km) long, 3,300 \nkm  of  regional  roads,  4,700  km  of  national  roads,  9,700  km  of  provincial  roads,  17,000  km  of \nrural roads, and 3,800 km of urban roads. The total length of railways is only 25 km, being a 10 \nkm  cross-border  extension  from  Turkmenistan  to  a  transshipment  yard  in  Torghandi  and  a  15 \nkm  extension  from  Uzbekistan  to  a  transshipment  yard  in  Hairatan.  Hairatan  is  a  gateway  for \ncommercial goods entering and transiting Afghanistan. Hairatan accounts for about 50% of all \nimports. Hairatan is both a dry and river port. Import and transit items include oil and fuel, wheat \nand  flour,  fertilizer,  agricultural  and  other  equipment,  construction  materials  and  consumer \n\n                                                 \n1  Technical  assistance  (TA)  was  provided  to  prepare  the  Project.

Country Partnership Strategy 2009\u20132013, Afghanistan. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nproducts.  Hairatan  is  also  the  main  entry  point  for  humanitarian  relief  goods.  No  other  rail \nproject is being sponsored by a multilateral agency in Afghanistan. \n \n5. \nTransport  sector  institutions.  Various  ministries  have  regulatory  and  oversight \nfunctions  over  transit  trade  and  transport,  including  the  Ministry  of  Commerce  and  Industry \n(MOCI), Customs Department under Ministry of Finance (MOF), Ministry of Transport and Civil \nAviation,  Ministry  of  Public  Works  (MPW),  and  Ministry  of  Interior  (MOI).  Coordination  among \nthe ministries is not formalized. MPW plays a principal role in the construction and maintenance \nof road and rail infrastructure. Its project management capacity is weak. \n \n6. \nLand-based  transport  services.  In  2007,  the  number  of  registered  vehicles  included \n300,000  cars,  40,000  buses,  100,000  trucks,  100,000  motorcycles,  and  5,000  rickshaws. \nVehicle numbers have increased rapidly in recent years, with annual growth rates over the past \n3 years close to 23% for cars, 15% for trucks, and 48% for motorcycles, but only 2% for buses \nand rickshaws. Virtually all vehicles are second-hand imports. \n \nFreight is carried primarily by privately owned trucks. The truck population is based on \n7. \nheavy articulated trucks (20%), with the remaining 80% divided equally into heavy, medium, and \nlight  or  pickup  classes.  There  are  no  special  transit  charges  and  foreign  trucks  transporting \nfreight through Afghanistan pay only a 5% commission. Freight rail services at Hairatan move \nabout 250 wagons a day, while at Torghandi the number is 50 wagons a day. Airport facilities \nare  also  limited  and  in  a  poor  state  of  repair.  Besides  Kabul,  Mazar-e-Sharif  is  the  only  main \nairport  due  for  major  reconstruction  and  expansion.  A  new  3,000  meter  runway  is  being \nconstructed.  About  600  meters  of  the  existing  runway  are  being  repaired,  including  new \ntaxiways. This will increase capacity for the intermodal flow of commercial goods.  \n \nB. \n\nKey Problems and Opportunities \n\n8. \nThe  transport  sector  performance  is  affected  by  three  main  problems:  inadequate \ninfrastructure, limited government capacity, and insecurity. A transport sector assessment is in \nAppendix 2. \n \n\n1. \n\nKey Problems \n\nin \n\ninvestment \n\nInadequate \n\ninfrastructure  and \n\nfacilities.  Before  2001, \n\n9. \nroad \nreconstruction and maintenance was negligible. This has since increased, although only 7% of \nthe total road length is paved. About 70% of inter-provincial and inter-district roads are in a poor \nstate of repair, in many cases impassable during winter months. The investment requirements \nto improve the network are high running over the long term into billions of dollars. In the medium \nterm the estimate is about $1.7 billion for 3,000 km of national roads and $1 billion for 17,000 \nkm  of  provincial  and  rural  roads.  The  railway  network  is  negligible.  Capacity  at  the  Hairatan \nmarshalling yard is adequate but all cargo has to be unloaded and reloaded into trucks.  \n \n10. \nThe road network is incomplete. Various parts of the country are poorly connected or not \nconnected at all. Four provincial capitals remain unconnected to the regional network isolating \nthem  from  domestic  and  regional  markets.  The  coverage  gap  affects  connectivity,  which  cuts \ntrade  and  investment  opportunities,  increases  the  cost  of  doing  business  and  reduces  the \ncountry\u2019s  competitiveness  and  job  creation  capability.  This  increases  costs,  and  generates \nlosses. \n \n11. \nRegional connectivity is underdeveloped primarily due to cross-border bottlenecks. Key \nconstraints  to  the  expansion  of  cross-border  trade  among  Central  and  South  Asian  countries \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n3\n\ninclude inadequate customs facilities and a heavy reliance on cargo transshipment at borders, \naggravated by the need for transit permits, and lack of vehicle standard and axle load controls, \nas well as visa regulations, unofficial charges, and the protection given to local trucking. Transit \nagreements  are  either  nonexistent  or  poorly  enforced.  Link  roads  and  facilities  at  border \ncrossings are inadequate. The few existing cross-border railway links have not been developed. \n \n12. \nLimited  Government  capacity.  The  transport  sector  requires  clear  investment  plans \nand  stable  and  predictable  financing  flows.  These  investment  plans  need  to  distinguish  better \nbetween  capital  and  recurrent  expenditures,  especially  for  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M). \nSeed  capital  is  provided  by  donors.  However,  not  all  donors  include  infrastructure  in  their \nbusiness  strategies.  The  result  is  that  financing  will  likely  remain  a  binding  constraint  for  the \nforeseeable future. \n\n13.  MPW  has  a  weak  team  and  inadequate  project  management  skills,  systems,  and \nprocedures. It has talented staff but too few to cope with the job at hand. The skills mix is also \nweak,  lacking  engineers  and  project  managers.  Recruiting  advisors  within  and  outside  the \ncountry  is  a  challenge.  In  the  meantime,  the  workload  is  increasing,  particularly  if  all  the  road \nnetworks  are  taken  into  account\u2014national,  provincial,  rural,  and  city  based.  Managing \nprocurement is already a challenge. Turnkey contracts have seldom been used.  \n \nSecurity.  Insecurity  threatens  the  reconstruction  effort,  makes  it  difficult  for  the \n14. \nGovernment to extend basic public services, increases project costs, limits bidding interest from \nconstruction  companies,  makes  recruiting  international  contractors  and  consultants  (including \nexpatriate Afghans) difficult, and erodes popular support for government staff and international \npersonnel. \n \n15. \nThe  international  connections  in  southern  and  eastern  Afghanistan  are  currently  not \nsufficiently  safe  or  reliable.  Security  hinders  the transportation  of  goods and  humanitarian  aid. \nThere  is  a  need  to  expand  all  modes  of  transport  and  to  open  up  more  reliable  and  efficient \nroutes  for  trade  into  and  from  Afghanistan.  A  new  rail  line  in  the  north  will  support  economic \ndevelopment and poverty reduction in the country and the region. \n \n\n2. \n\nOpportunities \n\na. \n\nExternal Assistance and Lessons Learned \n\n16. \nADB  has  financed  the  improvement  of  nearly  1,100  km  of  regional  and  national  roads \nsince  2004,  mostly  in  the  northern  and  northwestern  parts  of  the  country.  ADB\u2019s  investment \namounts to over $600 million. The United States Agency for International Development and the \nWorld  Bank  are  other  large  players  in  the  road  sector.  The  European  Union  is  financing  an \nexperimental performance-based maintenance contract for a Kabul-Jalalabad road. The Japan \nBank for International Cooperation is helping MPW improve the management and use of road-\nmaintenance  equipment,  a  major  action  to  improve  institutional  effectiveness  and  project \nimplementation. \n \nThree  key  lessons  can  be  drawn  from  ADB's  experience:  (i)  project  costs  have  been \n17. \nunderestimated,  (ii)  the  procurement  of  works  and  services  has  been  slow  and  uncompetitive \ndespite being tendered, and (iii) stakeholder consultation has been weak. Unstable Government \ncofinancing and poor project management have been recurrent problems. \n \n18.  Most  transport  projects have  suffered  from  underestimated  capital  and  recurrent  costs. \nThis  problem  has  been  exacerbated  by  fast-rising  prices  for  materials  and  security  concerns. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nUnder these conditions, MPW has been unable to finance overruns, creating long delays and, in \nsome cases, actual contractual disputes. This problem has been aggravated by the approval of \nlarge stand-alone projects at a time. Financing has not always been well linked to the readiness \nof projects. The use of separate multitranche financing facilities by ADB for each priority sector \nunder  the  Country  Partnership  Strategy  (footnote  3)  provides  an  opportunity  to  allocate  the \nannual  funding  envelope  among  projects  (or  sections  of  projects)  more  efficiently.  Turnkey \ncontracts can also speed up contract awards, disbursements, and results on the ground. \n \nProcurement of works for design-build has been done mostly on the basis of quantities \n19. \nestimated  from  preliminary  designs.  This  has  led  to  many  variations  in  scope  and  scale  of \nworks. The consulting firms recruited according to quality- and cost-based selection have been \nunable to replace key specialists, who often leave at short notice due to security risks. Another \ncomplication has been the lack of contractor interest. Quite often, only one contractor tends to \nbid for projects. Given that contractors know in advance the size of the financing package, bids \nhave  always  been  close  to  or  even  higher  than  the  finance  envelope.  There  is  a  need  to \nconsider increasing the number of operations structured around engineering, procurement, and \nconstruction  (EPC)  contracts  supervised  by  independent  and  credible  firms.  Price  verifications \ncan precede these contracts and be carried out by independent advisors. \n \n20. \nStakeholder  consultation,  especially  with  local  communities,  has  been  difficult  because \nof security concerns. The result is that some communities have not bought into the projects, or \nwelcomed  foreign  contractors.  This  has  become  an  issue  affecting  implementation  and  the \nultimate success of projects. The establishment of community funds in road and energy MFFs \nwill cover the cost of basic community infrastructure services and increase their \"buy-in\" in these \nprojects. \n \n \n\nTransport Sector Strategy \n\nb. \n\n \n\nThe  Afghanistan  National  Development  Strategy,4 adopted  by  the  Government  in  April \n21. \n2008,  is  the  country\u2019s  main  strategic  platform  for  development  over  2008\u20132020.  It  aims  to \npromote  growth,  generate  wealth,  and  cut  poverty  and  vulnerability.  The  strategy  includes \ntransport  and  logistics.  In  this  regard,  it  sets  out  quantitative  and  qualitative  targets,  both \nphysical and nonphysical, and covers various systems, including roads and railways. \n \n22. \nThe main objective under the transport strategy is to develop corridors between Central \nAsia  and  South  Asia.  Two  regional  road  corridors,  North-South  and  East-West  have  been \nidentified and are at various stages of development. The North-South Corridor runs from Central \nAsia through Afghanistan to the Pakistani ports of Karachi/Port Qasim and Gwadar. The East-\nWest  Corridor  runs  from  Central  Asia  through  Afghanistan  to  the  Iranian  ports  of  Bandar-e-\nAbbas and Chabahar. \n \nKey  development  actions  are  (i)  investments  in  transport  and  trade  infrastructure;  \n23. \n(ii)  strengthening  trade-related  institutions  and  improving  the  efficiency  at  ports  and  customs;  \n(iii) harmonizing transport, trade, and tariff policies, standards, and regulatory frameworks; and \n(iv) fostering private sector involvement. \n \n \n\nRationale of the Project \n\nc. \n\n \n\n24. \nStrategic  priority.  A  reliable,  efficient,  safe,  and  sustainable  transport  link  between \nAfghanistan  and  its  neighboring  countries  is  essential  to  increase  regional  cooperation  and \n\n                                                 \n4  Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. 2008. Afghanistan National Development Strategy. Kabul. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n5\n\ntrade. It is also a key to expanding job creation, investment, and ultimately poverty reduction in \nAfghanistan. A railway network adds to the transport modes, including the existing roads being \nbuilt in the north and center of the country, and soon to the expanded airport at Mazar-e-Sharif, \nthe country's second-largest commercial center. The extension of the railway line from Hairatan \nto Mazar-e-Sharif is a top Government priority and fits its development strategy. \n \n25. \nUrgency.  Due  to  the  ongoing  conflicts  in  Afghanistan  and  Pakistan,  the  reliability  of \ntransport supply and trade routes into Afghanistan is impaired. The movement of goods by rail \nfrom the Uzbekistan border is relatively safe, and can become a cost effective transport mode. \nHairatan is already Afghanistan's main dry and river port, accounting for close to 50% of its total \nimports. But the movement of cargo is constrained by its unloading and reloading into trucks at \nthe border. This is costly, slow, and limits volume flows including humanitarian relief. Removing \nthis bottleneck is an urgent task.  \n \n26. \nEfficiency.  A  new  railway  line  between  Hairatan  and  Mazar-e-Sharif  complements \nCAREC corridors 3 and 6, which connect Central Asia to South Asia, Caucasus, and the Middle \nEast. The railway targets mainly the transport of bulk and nonperishable cargo such as cotton, \ncement, and bitumen for road construction, agricultural and off-highway construction equipment, \noil  and  fuel,  processed  foods,  and  consumer  products.  The  existing  rail  line  from  Termez  to \nHairatan  in  Uzbekistan  terminates  at  the  Afghanistan  border.  The  extension  of  the  Termez\u2013\nHairatan  link  into  Mazar-e-Sharif  (close  to  the  airport)  can  remove  physical  constraints  at \nHairatan  and  create  an  alternative  and  competitive  transport  made  for  trade  between \nAfghanistan and its neighboring countries. Mazar-e-Sharif's location close to the Ring Road and \nthe airport results in an integrated transport facility. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n27. \nThe  Project  will  lead  to  greater  economic  growth  and  increase  trade  between \nAfghanistan and the region. The outcome will be a more efficient, safe, and sustainable railway \ntransport  network,  which  will  increase  transport  volumes  and  reduce  transport  costs.  The \nProject underpins regional cooperation and integration in Central Asia. \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n28. \nThe Project will build a railway line linking Hairatan and Mazar-e-Sharif. It will have two \ncomponents:  (i)  railway  design  and  construction,  and  (ii)  project  management,  construction \nsupervision, and institutional development. \n \n29. \nsupport infrastructure and facilities. The outputs will be:  \n \n\nRailway  construction.  The  Project  will  construct  a  75  km  railway  line  and  associated \n\nupgraded marshaling yard and railway station at Hairatan, \na new single-line of 75 km,  \nrailway station and transshipment facilities at Mazar-e-Sharif, \nsignaling and telecommunication systems, and \nsafety facilities. \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n \nThe  Project  will  benefit  from  recently  modernized  custom  facilities  at  Hairatan,  which \n30. \nhave been funded by the European Commission. The first phase of this \u20ac13 million operation is \nalready completed. The second phase will follow in 2010.  \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nInstitutional  development.  This  component  will  cover  project  management, \n31. \nconstruction supervision, and institutional support. An advisor will be recruited and tasked with \ndeveloping (i) a railway sector institutional plan, (ii) a railway legal and regulatory framework, (iii) \nan O&M agreement, and (iv) a training program. \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n32. \nRegional  cooperation.  The  Project  will  promote  regional  cooperation  and  trade.  The \nfacility  will  attract  high-value  traffic  on  to  railways,  promote  intermodal  traffic,  and  encourage \nprivate sector shippers and freight forwarders to trade cargo to Afghanistan, Central Asia, South \nAsia, the Middle East, and Europe. The Project will complement CAREC road corridors.  \n \nEnvironmental benefits. The Project will improve environmental sustainability by using \n33. \nregenerative locomotives, and better technology for noise reduction and soil erosion prevention. \nIt will use double-stack containers to increase fuel-efficiency and environmental benefits. \n \n34.  Weakly  Performing  Country  principles.  ADB\u2019s  approach  on  Achieving  Development \nEffectiveness in Weakly Performing Countries5 (WPC paper) calls for flexibility when designing \nand implementing projects. The proposal to opt for direct EPC and O&M contracting and to relax \nprocurement eligibility rules is based on these principles. \n \nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\nThe investment cost is estimated at $170 million. A summary of the investment plan is in \n\n35. \nTable 1. More detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 3. \n \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nItem \n\n \n\nA.  Base Cost \n\n1.

The \nPIU  director  will  coordinate  the  work  of  the  EPC  contractor  and  supervision  consultant.  MPW \nwill ensure that throughout project implementation, the PIU is adequately staffed with experts in \nengineering,  financial,  controls  procurement,  environmental,  and  social  safeguards,  and \nequipped with the necessary office space, equipment, and facilities. The organizational structure \nfor the PIU is in Appendix 4. ADB is considering opening an extended mission in Mazar-e-Sharif \nfor the purposes of this Project and the completion of the Ring Road. \n \n38. \nA management information system will be used by the PIU to manage the Project. The \nPIU will prepare progress reports and submit these to the EA and ADB every quarter. It will also \nsubmit  other  required  performance  and  monitoring  reports  twice  a  year.  Overall  progress  and \ncompliance  with  conditions  of  the  Grant  Agreement  will  be  monitored  regularly  with  periodic \nreports to ADB. Reports will include the evaluation of issues or problems and remedial actions. \n \n39. \nEfforts  are  needed  from  the  Government  to  accomplish  the  Project  on  time.  This \nrequires various activities within limited time and thus decisions on a fast-track basis. In order to \nadminister the Project effectively, the Government will constitute an Executive Committee, with \nrepresentatives from MOF, MPW, MOCI, and MOI. The committee will be chaired by a minister-\nlevel  official.  The  committee  will  provide  overall  guidance,  facilitate  all  approvals  from  various \nagencies, and finalize agreements with UTY. It will also firm up the O&M contract before project \ncompletion. \n \n40. \nThe  committee  will  monitor  and  coordinate  implementation  with  the  PIU  director.  It  will \nhandle  all  administrative  matters  to  clear  security  and  land/resettlement  issues,  and  recruit \nadvisors.  ADB  will  provide  technical  assistance  to  oversee  the  execution  of  the  Project,  and \nsubsequent to that, its management. ADB staff including in Afghanistan Resident Mission, will \nassist in project implementation. A project administration memorandum has been prepared. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n41. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  18  months  including  testing, \ncommissioning, and trial operations. The design and construction activities are expected to start \nin November 2009. The tentative implementation schedule is in Appendix 5. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\nProcurement Mode. The Project will use direct contracting method based on a turnkey \n42. \ncontract covering  engineering,  procurement,  and  construction  (EPC).  The  proposed  contractor \nis Uzbekistan Temir Yullari (Uzbekistan Railways Company, or UTY). \n \nDirect  contracting  method  for  procuring  the  EPC  turnkey  contract  directly  from  UTY  is \n43. \nconsistent  with  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  is \njustified on the following grounds: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nThe line is a de facto extension of the current Uzbekistan network into Mazar-e-\nSharif  and  will  be  based  on  the  Uzbekistan  gauge  system.  This  approach  has \nconsiderable  financial  and  operational  logic,  and  it  does  make  the  Project \npotentially  less  attractive  to  other  contractors  in  the  region  unfamiliar  with  the \nsystem.  \n\nThere  are  no  comparable  operators  in  the  region  or  beyond  it,  with  the  same \nlevel of experience as UTY when it comes to designing, building, and operating a \nrailway line based on the Uzbekistan system, including its maintenance. UTY has \nmany years of experience in the field and is familiar not only with the system but \nalso with building and operating conditions on the ground. \n\nUTY  has  already  proprietary  preliminary  designs  for  the  Project  based  on  past \nwork  commissioned  directly  by  the  Afghanistan  Government.  This  design  work \naccelerates Project readiness, saving considerable time and costs. \n\nUTY  will  also  operate  the  railway  services  and  maintain  the  track  and  service \nthrough  a  separate  O&M  agreement.  An  extension  of  the  Uzbekistan  network \ninto Mazar-e-Sharif means that Afghanistan does not have to invest or lease new \nrolling  stock  or  spare  parts.  This  cuts  down  investment  and  operation  and \nmaintenance  costs\u2014but  only \nthe \noperator/concessionaire.  Uzbekistan  would  be  unwilling  to  outsource  such \nservice to a third party.   \n\nthe  package  as \n\nis  part  of \n\nif  UTY \n\nADB's  experience  in  Afghanistan  suggests  that  on  average,  only  one  company \nbids for a construction contract. Security, cost, and other considerations account \nfor  this.  The  situation  has  not  resulted  in  greater  competition  or  cost  savings  to \nAfghanistan. Most contractors know in advance the size of the financing package \nand often submit bids close to that or even above. In addition, the process takes \ntime  and  in  several  instances  involves  re-bidding.  The  end-result  has  been  late \nstart-ups  and  slow  project  implementation.  These  delays  have  caused  changes \nin project scope, cost overruns, and contract renegotiations. Further, if UTY were \nto bid for the Project, it would likely be the only group doing so. If it were not to \nbid, the Government would have to secure the services of another contractor that \nwould effectively have to start from scratch with the design work and find ways to \naccess  information  from  Uzbekistan  on  its  gauge  and  operational  system.  This \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n9\n\naccess  is  not  guaranteed,  putting  the  Project  implementation  schedule  at  risk, \nleading  to  substantial  delays  and  price  increases.  Opting  for  international \nstandards is an option. But this implies then having to buy or lease rolling stock \ninternationally.  Finally,  a  third-party  contractor  would  not  be  able  to  operate \nUzbekistan trains. UTY has this mandate on an exclusive basis. \n\n \n\n44. \nLinking  an  EPC  turnkey  contract  to  O&M  is  another  strong  feature  of  the  Project.  This \nyields  major  logistical  benefits  to  all  parties.  The  Government  and  ADB  will  oversee  design, \nconstruction, and commissioning through the independent supervision consultancy.  \n \n45. \nSource  of  materials.  The  Project  will  adopt  the  Uzbekistan  gauge  standard  for \nefficiency and economic reasons. The rail tracks are produced by countries adopting this gauge \nstandard.  A  number  of  them  are  not  ADB-member  countries.  ADB  procurement  eligibility \nrestrictions would effectively preclude UTY from seeking the best business terms from suppliers \nin these countries, and thus from submitting a competitive proposal. The Government requests \nADB  to  waive  the  eligibility  rule  to  allow  financing  of  the  rail  track  components  procured  from \nnonmember  countries  of  ADB.  Due  diligence  work  conducted  by  ADB  indicates  that,  in  this \ncase, procurement of rail track components could be quicker and more competitive. Considering \nthe  flexibility  allowed  in  the  WPC  paper  (footnote  5),  it  is  proposed  that  UTY  be  allowed  to \nprocure rail track components from countries that are not ADB members. \n \n46. \nUTY  qualifications.  UTY  is  the  sole  operator  of  the  Uzbekistan  rail  network  which \nextends up to the border town of Hairatan. UTY has designed and executed ADB rail projects in \nthe  past,  including  the  railway  link  between  Tashkent  and  Samarkand. 6 The  company  has \nadequate expertise and sufficient financial resources to support a project of this nature. UTY is \noperating and maintaining the existing railway line between Termez and Hairatan, including the \nHairatan station and marshalling yard. In addition, the following summarizes UTY's capacity: \n \n\nUTY  is  supported  by  two  specialized  railway  design  institutions  and  is  able  to \ndevelop  complex  detailed  designs  for  construction  of  new  railway  lines  and \nassociated facilities.  \n\nDuring the last 5 years, UTY has constructed about 1,000 km of railway lines at a \ntotal cost of $1.7 billion. \n\nUTY has experience in working with multilateral and bilateral institutions such as \nADB, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, European Union, \nKuwait Fund, and the French Government. \n\nUTY  has  a  good  base  for  supplying  materials,  such  as  concrete  sleeper's \nproduction,  a  facility  which  was  set  up  under  an  ADB  project.  It  also  has  the \ncapacity to source gravel, cement, bitumen, gasoline, and concrete structures. \n\nUTY is fully-equipped with a good pool of construction equipment, such as earth- \nmoving  machines  and  specialized  rail  track-laying  machines.  A  modern  rail \nwelding center is also in place in Tashkent. \n\n \n47. \nEPC  contract. The EPC contract will have a fixed price and fixed delivery period, with \nappropriate penalties for non-performance and a bonus for timely completion. A proposal for the \nEPC contract has already been requested from UTY under direct contracting, following relevant \n                                                 \n6  ADB.  2006.  Uzbekistan:  Railway  Rehabilitation  Project.  Manila.  (Project  completion  report).  ADB.  2008. \n\nUzbekistan: Railway Modernization Project. Manila. (Project completion report). \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nprovisions from ADB's standard bidding document for procurement of plant-design, supply, and \ninstall. The proposal will require UTY to adopt a competitive process similar to ADB's 'shopping' \napproach,  inviting  a  minimum  of  3  quotations  from  both  ADB's  member  and  non-member \ncountries  identified  for  this  procurement\u2014including  rail  track  components.  Award  of  single-\nresponsibility turnkey contract, such as the proposed EPC contract, under the direct contracting \nmethod will allow for expedient implementation but this will be monitored strictly.  \n \n48. \nProcurement process. At the request of the Government, ADB has agreed to advance \ncontracting  of  procurement  activities,  including  civil  works  and  consultants,  up  to  contract \nnegotiations.  Contract  negotiations  will  be  conducted  between  the  Government  and  UTY  in \nOctober 2009. ADB will assist the Government during the negotiations. The procurement plan is \nin  Appendix  6.  ADB  will  engage  an  independent  expert  to  help  with  bid  evaluation,  price \nestimation and validation. The EPC will be signed between the Government and UTY. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nConsultants will be recruited and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \n49. \nUse of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). A consulting firm will be selected to \noversee the design and construction work, using ADB\u2019s modified quality- and cost-based (90:10 \nratio)  selection  procedure.  Full  technical  proposals  will  be  required.  The  Project  will  require  a \ntotal  of  about  200  person-months  (100  person-months  international  and  100  person-months \nnational  and  regional)  of  consultancy  services.  At  the  request  of  the  Government,  ADB  has \nagreed  to  carry  out  the  recruitment  of  the  consulting  firm  for  design  review  and  construction \nsupervision. \n \n50.  MPW  will  procure  10  person-months  of  advisory  services  for  railway  sector  and \ninstitutional  development.  Individual  consultants  will  be  engaged  for  this  purpose.  The \nGovernment  has  agreed  to  recruit  individual  consultants  in  line  with  ADB's  procedures.  The \nselection  and  engagement  of  these  consultants  will  use  position-based  terms  of  reference \nincluded in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\nTo expedite project implementation, the Government requested advance contracting and \n51. \nretroactive  financing  of  works  and  consulting  services.  Advance  contracting  allows  the \nGovernment to commence procurement activities, at its own risk, prior to the signing of relevant \nlegal  agreements.  The  Government  was  informed  that,  in  order  for  expenses  incurred  under \nadvance  contracting  to  be  eligible  for  retroactive  financing,  such  procedures  (including \nadvertising)  must  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  and  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants,  subject  to  the  special  recommendation  proposed  under  para.  83(ii)  below.  Once \nthe  grant  becomes  effective,  up  to  20%  of  the  grant  amount  may  be  used  to  retroactively \nfinance  eligible  expenditures  incurred  during  the  period  not  exceeding  12  months  prior  to \nsigning of the grant agreement. Alternatively, the Government may opt for advance contracting \nwithout  retroactive  financing,  in  which  case,  the  procurement  procedures  completed  under \nadvance  contracting  do  not  conclude  with  the  award  of  contract  until  after  the  grant  becomes \neffective.  The  Government  acknowledges  that  any  concurrence  by  ADB  with  the  procedures, \ndocumentation,  or  proposal  for  award  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  such  expenses  or  the \nProject. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n11\n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n52. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  MPW.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \ngrant regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to \naudit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  PIU,  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n53. \nGrant  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook. Direct payment procedures will be used for large civil works contracts and consulting \nservices. MPW will establish an imprest account at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB, with \nan  initial  advance  equivalent  to  estimated  eligible  project  expenditures  for  the  next  6  months \nwhich are to be paid through the imprest account or 10% of the grant amount, whichever is less. \nThe  imprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook and detailed arrangements agreed by the Government and ADB. \nThe  statement-of-expenditure  procedure  will  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditure  and  to \nliquidate and replenish the imprest account for individual payments of $100,000 and below. \n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n54.  MPW  will  maintain  separate  Project  records  and  accounts  identifying  (i)  goods,  works, \nand services procured; (ii) funds received from ADB and MOF; and (iii) expenditures incurred. \nAuditors  will  be  selected  and  engaged  by  the  least-cost  selection  method  for  the  consultant-\nqualifications  selection  method  in  accordance  with  the  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants. \nThe  Office  of  the  Auditor  General  of  Afghanistan  may  also  conduct  annual  audits  of  overall \nMPW operations and Project accounts. Within 6 months after the end of each fiscal year, MPW \nwill  submit  to  ADB  the  audited  Project  accounts  and  the  auditor's  reports,  including  separate \nopinion  on  the  use  of  the  imprest  accounts  and  the  statement  of  expenditure  procedures \ncompliance  with  the  financial  covenants  of  the  grant  agreement,  all  in  the  English  language. \nMPW  will  also  furnish  to  ADB  other  information  concerning  such  accounts  and  financial \nstatements  and  the  audit  thereof  as  ADB  may  request  from  time  to  time.  Audited  financial \nstatements  should  be  prepared  in  conformity  with  sound  accounting  standards  acceptable  to \nADB. \n' \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n55.  MPW,  assisted  by  the  design  review  and  construction  supervision  consultant,  will \ndevelop a project performance monitoring system within 3 months from Project commencement, \nwhich  will  contain  baseline  values  of  indicators,  targets,  and  milestones  corresponding  to  the \nexpected  impacts,  outcome,  outputs,  and  activities  identified  in  the  design  and  monitoring \nframework, and other relevant measures agreed between ADB and MPW. \n \n56. \nThe design review and supervision consultants will help MPW compile periodic data on \nkey indicators on physical components of the Project. Data will be analyzed and results of the \nanalyses  and  corrective  measures  (if  any)  taken  will  be  reported  in  MPW's  quarterly  progress \nreport.  The  quarterly  progress  reports  will  also  include  physical  progress,  disbursements, \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nproblems  (if  any)  encountered,  actions  taken,  and  activities  planned  for  the  following  quarter. \nMPW will also perform a complete analysis of related primary and secondary data on impacts \nand  outcomes  within  1 month  of  completion  of the  Project. The  results of  that  analysis  will  be \ncontained in the Government's project completion report to ADB, which will be submitted within \n3 months of completion of the Project. \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\nADB will field an inception mission within 2 months of grant approval. Subsequently, the \n57. \nADB  mission  will  review  project  implementation,  including  procurement,  civil  works,  and \nenvironmental and social safeguards  based on quarterly progress reports. It will meet with the \nExecutive  Committee,  MPW,  and  PIU  to  discuss  implementation  progress\u2014focusing  on \nengineering,  environmental,  and  social  safeguards  of  the  Project;  compliance  with  grant \ncovenants;  and  review  of  the  financial  status  of  the  PIU.  Representatives  of  the  Executive \nCommittee  and  MPW  will  take  part  in  the  review.  The  review  will  allow  for  any  necessary \nmidcourse corrections to ensure successful implementation and the achievement of the Project \nobjectives. ADB missions, together with the Executive Committee, MPW, and PIU\u2014will perform \non-site  reviews  of  the  Project  6  months  after  the  project  starts.  This  review  will  focus  on \nidentifying causes and agreeing on measures to correct negative deviations from targets for (i) \nthe physical completion of works, (ii) disbursements, and (iii) financial and procurement audits. \n \nG. \n\nRailway Operation Plan \n\n1. \n\nNew Railway Institution \n\nThe  management  of  Hairatan  railway  station  is  under  Hairatan  Port  Authority,  a \n58. \ncorporate entity, under MOCI. Railway operations between Termez and Hairatan, including the \noperation  of  the  marshalling  yard,  are  part  of  an  Afghanistan-Uzbekistan  Railway  Agreement \nsigned in 2003. The train operation rules were agreed in 2008. \n \n59. \nAfter the Project is completed, there will be a need to establish a more stable institutional \nframework,  not  only  to  oversee  the  rail  link  from  Hairatan  to  Mazar-e-Sharif,  but  also  develop \nthe  Government's  capacity  for  railway  sector  planning.  The  Government  therefore  plans  to \ncreate  an  Afghanistan  Railway  Authority  (ARA),  a  semi-autonomous  agency.  ARA  will  be \nresponsible for O&M of the railways in Afghanistan. The following targets are envisaged: (i) ARA \nestablished by December 2010, (ii) key management and staff appointed by 2010, (iii) terms of \nreference developed, (iv) asset valuation finished, and (v) staff trained. UTY will assist the ARA. \nAn adviser will be recruited under the Project to draft an institutional plan based on preliminary \nassessment prepared under ADB's TA (footnote 1). This will be completed by April 2010. \n \n\n2. \n\nRailway Operation and Maintenance Agreement \n\nThe  Government  will  outsource  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  rail  service \n\n60. \nbetween Hairatan and Mazar-e-Sharif to UTY. \n \n61. \nThe  Government  and  UTY  already  agreed  in  principle  on  the  proposed  railway  O&M \nmodel. This will be signed before the Project is completed.7 An adviser will be recruited to draft \nthe agreement as part of the institutional development component. The Government agreed that \na draft agreement will be developed by July 2010. \n \n\n                                                 \n7  A memorandum of understanding on operation and maintenance between the Government and UTY  was signed \n\non 16 August 2009 in Kabul. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n13\n\nH. \n\nSecurity Arrangements \n\n62. \nThe  Government  will  provide  the  necessary  security  to  the  Project  teams  during  the \nconstruction  and  operation  of  the  railway  line.  UTY  will  have  an  international  security \ncoordinator  assigned  to  it.  The  coordinator  will  work  closely  with  the  police  and  MOI.  The \nGovernment  will  arrange  for  security  assessments  through  International  Security  Assistance \nForce (ISAF)8 and share the information with UTY and ADB (AFRM, Field Security office). The \nGovernment,  through  MOI,  will  provide  security  to  UTY  camps,  project  design  teams,  and \nconstruction  staff.  The  Government  will  provide  ISAF  coverage  to  the  Project  site,  including \nmedical and emergency services. Based on the discussions with ISAF, the Project area is likely \nto  be  relatively  safe  and  no  mines  are  prevalent  or  expected.  However,  the  Government  will \narrange  for  a  demining  assessment  of  the  route  before  the  start  of  civil  works.  Budget  for \nsecurity is tentatively reserved under contingencies. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nProject Benefits \n\n1. \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\n63. \nEconomic  analysis  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  for  the \nEconomic  Analysis  of  Projects.  The  methodology,  key  assumptions,  and  results  are \nsummarized in Appendix 7. The main project benefits comprise freight-cost savings, commodity \nloss  reductions,  increased  trade,  and  incremental  truck  productivity.  Other  benefits  include \navoided externality costs, reduction in road maintenance, and lower traffic. The potential Project \nbeneficiaries will be shippers, freight forwarders, and local communities. The Project's economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) is estimated at 15%. Women will also benefit from the Project. The \nrail line also has high regional cooperation content. \n \nSensitivity  tests  were  carried  out  to  assess  the  impact  of  different  benefit  and  cost \n64. \nvariables.  Under  a  combined  freight-cost  saving  reduced  by  20%  and  construction  costs \nincreased by 10%, the EIRR is estimated at 12%. Assuming that there is no productivity gained \nby  the  trucks,  the  Project  remains  feasible  with  an  EIRR  of  13%.  The  reduction  of  freight \ndiversion rate from 30% to 25% will reduce the EIRR to 13%. The sensitivity tests demonstrate \nthat the Project is robust across a broad range of variations in key parameters. \n \n \n\nFinancial Sustainability \n\n2. \n\n65. \nADB\u2019s  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects  was  used  to  evaluate  the \nProject's and the ARA's financial viability. In both cases, the revenue generated from fixed fees \nand revenue-sharing arrangements lead to financial sustainability.  \n \nProject  financial  viability.  The  Project's  annual  net  cash  flows  were  forecast  over  \n66. \n26  years  (2009\u20132035),  including  the  construction  period,  under  a  with-  and  without-project \nscenarios. Constant mid-2009 prices were used to calculate the financial internal rate of return \n(FIRR)  and  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC).  The  incremental  cash  flow  included  all \npayments incurred to construct, operate, and maintain the facilities over their useful life. Taxes \nand  physical  contingencies  were  included,  but  price  contingencies  were  excluded.  FIRR  is \nestimated at 4.5% and WACC at 1.9%. This is based on generating minimum revenue of 35% \n\n                                                 \n8  ISAF has a peace-enforcement mandate under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter and several UN Security \nCouncil  Resolutions  (www.nato.int/ISAF/topics/mandate/index.html).  ISAF  has  been  involved  in  site  security \nassessment, providing security advice regularly, and in emergency services in Afghanistan.   \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nbased  on  rail  freight  transport  tariffs.  The  project  financial  analysis,  including  its  sensitivity \nanalysis, is in Appendix 8. \n \n67. \nARA  financial  sustainability.  Projected  financial  forecasts  were  carried  out  on  the \nsustainability,  cost  recovery,  and  profitability  of  a  prospective  agency.  The  agency  financial \nperformance projection is reasonable as shown in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n\n \n3. \n\nFinancial Management \n\nFinancial  management  assessment  was  undertaken  for  MPW  to  evaluate  its  ability  to \n68. \nfulfill  ADB\u2019s  fiduciary  requirements.  A  financial  management  assessment  report  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix C. \n \n69.  MPW  manages  a  number  of  ADB-funded  road  projects  and  is  familiar  with  ADB \nrequirements.  The  current  organizational  structure  is  adequate  but  financial  and  accounting \nservices  will  need  to  be  outsourced.  The  financial  management  assessment  indicates  that \nMPW\u2019s  financial  and  accounting  staff  does  not  have  the  relevant  expertise.  Training  will  be \nprovided to MPW staff. \n \n\n4. \n\nSocial Dimensions and Poverty Reduction  \n\nA poverty and social analysis for the Project was conducted in August 2009. It involved \n70. \nkey  stakeholders  including  local  communities  (including  women),  pastoral  nomads,  MPW,  and \ndistrict government officials. \n \nThe  Project  is  located  in  the  Balkh  Province.  The  main  beneficiaries  will  be  local \n71. \ncompanies,  local  communities,  shippers,  and  freight  forwarders.  Women  will  also  benefit  from \nthe Project. The Project will generate considerable economic and social benefits. Railways will \nlikely  attract  additional  economic  activity  into  the  area,  thus  generating  job  opportunities, \nincluding for women. \n \n72.  Women and other vulnerable groups will benefit from the Project because the railway will \ngenerate  demand  for  local  labor,  increase  economic  activity,  including  small  business \nopportunities.  The  expansion  of  secondary  and  tertiary  industries,  due  to  increased  trade,  will \nhelp generate additional employment opportunities for both men and women. \n \n73. \nA summary poverty reduction and social analysis is in Appendix 9. The operation of the \nrailway  could  have  a  beneficial  impact  on  the  incident  of  HIV/AIDS  and  sexual  transmitted \ndiseases. Evidence has shown that long-haul truck drivers are a primary vector for geographical \nspread of HIV/AIDS. The Project will reduce the amount of long-haul truck operations, especially \ntrucking  across  international  and  provincial  borders.  Further,  providing  modern  transport \ninfrastructure reduces the migration of workers seeking employment elsewhere, again reducing \nsexually  transmitted  diseases  transmission  vectors.  The  Project  will  not  require  importing  a \nlarge number of workers.  \n \nB. \n\nProject Impacts  \n\n1. \n\nSocial Impacts and Involuntary Resettlement \n\n74. \nThe  Project  entails  minor  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  since  most  of  the  railway \nroute  passes  through  uninhabited  and  unused  desert  land.  The  impact  of  the  railway  route  is \nonly on 2 vacant plots. Based on this impact, the Project has been classified B for resettlement \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n15\n\npurposes.  A  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan  (LARP)  was  prepared  (Supplementary \nAppendix D). \n \n75. \nNone  of  the  people  affected  by  the  Project  belongs  to  groups  classified  as  indigenous \npeoples under ADB's Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). The Project has been categorized \nas C for impacts on indigenous peoples. A summary on social safeguards is in Appendix 10. \n \n\n2. \n\nEnvironmental Impact and Mitigation Measures \n\nThe  Project  is  classified  category  B.  The  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was \n76. \nprepared  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental  Assessment \nGuidelines (2003). The Project will have no major long-term adverse impact on the environment. \nShort-term impacts are considered insignificant and temporary and will be mitigated through the \nimplementation of an environmental management plan (EMP). \n \n77. \nThe  contractor  will  implement  appropriate  mitigation  measures  during  the  construction \nperiod. MPW, through the PIU, will be assisted by the supervision consultant to (i) ensure that \nEPC contract documents clearly set out the contractor\u2019s obligations to undertake environmental \nthe \nmitigation  measures \nimplementation  of  mitigation  measures  during  construction,  and \nthe \nenvironmental  monitoring  plan  including  reporting  requirements.  The  summary  IEE  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix E and the IEE is in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \nC. \n\nIEE  and  EMP,  (ii)  supervise  and  monitor \nimplement \n\nAssumptions and Potential Risks \n\nidentified \n\nthe \n\n(iii) \n\nin \n\nThe  Project  assumes  maximum  coordination  efforts  by  government  agencies  in \n78. \nAfghanistan,  and  full  commitment  and  support  of  the  Balkh  Provincial  government,  local \ncommunities, and security institutions. Moreover, it is assumed that the Government will sustain \npolicies  conducive  to  economic  growth  and  remain  committed  to  regional  cooperation  and \nintegration.  \n \n79. \nThe Project has two major potential risks: (i) start-up and implementation delays, and (ii) \nsecurity. The Government plans strong measures to mitigate these risks. Advance actions are \nbeing taken to speed up implementation readiness. The engagement of supervision consultants \nis  already  underway  and  discussions  have  taken  place  with  UTY  on  the  basic  EPC  contract \nterms  and  conditions,  including  quality  standards,  the  fixed  price  concept,  and  the  fixed  time \ndelivery  schedule.  A  request  for  a  proposal  from  UTY  has  also  been  advanced,  a  final \ncommitment  being  subject  to  formal  approvals  of  the  financing,  and  other  arrangements,  by \nADB and the Government of Afghanistan. ADB will act throughout as a facilitator, including at \nthe  negotiations  between  the  Government  and  UTY,  and  will  engage  the  services  of  an \nindependent railway expert to verify the price proposals by UTY. Implementation delay risks can \nbe mitigated by the EPC contract and the fact that UTY has already preliminary designs. This \ncan reduce the risk of cost overruns and cut the probability of execution extensions. On security, \nthe  Project  provides  sufficient \nto  mitigate  possible  security  disruptions  during \nimplementation. Close coordination with MOI has taken place.  \n \n80. \nActions  are  also  planned  to  mitigate  operational  risks.  A  railway  agency  will  be  set  up \nduring  the  implementation  phase  to  manage  the  rail  assets  and  ensure  their  financial \nsustainability. An advisor will be engaged under the Project to help prepare an O&M agreement \nbetween  the  Government  and  UTY,  which  will  be  signed  before  Project  completion.  ADB  will \nassist the Government negotiate the contract, including defining its operational criteria and basic \n\nfunds \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nterms  and  conditions.  The  agreement  will  cover  performance  benchmarks,  maintenance,  risk \nsharing, and other arrangements between the two parties. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  which  will  be  incorporated  in  the \n\n81. \nlegal documents in addition to the standard assurances: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nRailway  operation  and  maintenance. The Government plans to outsource the \nrailway O&M between Hairatan and Mazar-e-Sharif to UTY for a specific period \nof time, the duration of which will be decided by July 2010. An O&M agreement \nwill be executed between the Government and UTY by October 2010. \nConstruction  quality.  The  Government,  through  MPW,  will  ensure  that  the \nProject  is  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  applicable  technical  specifications \nand  design,  and  that  the  construction  supervision,  quality  control,  and  project \nmanagement  are  performed  in  accordance  with  applicable  standards  and  best \ninternational practices. \nRailway  safety.  The  Government,  through  MPW,  will  ensure  that  civil  works \ncontracts will include the contractor\u2019s obligation to comply with safety measures \nduring construction and operation. The Government shall cause ARA to monitor \nand report the accident rate after commencement of operation of the rail service. \nPerformance  targets. The Government will ensure that the civil works contract \nincorporates  specific  implementation  milestones  and  targets  with  appropriate \nreward and penalty provisions to provide reasonable economic stimuli for timely \nand qualitative Project completion. \nEnvironment. The Government, through MPW, will ensure that potential adverse \nenvironmental impacts arising from the Project are minimized by implementing all \nthe  mitigation  measures  presented  in  the  IEE  and  EMP.  The  Government  will \nalso  ensure  that  the  design,  construction,  and  operation  of  the  Project  are  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Policy  and \nthe  Government\u2019s \nenvironmental laws and regulations. The Government will cause MPW to ensure \nthat: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\nThe  contractor  has  primary  responsibility  for  implementing  the  mitigation \nmeasures  and  EMP  measures.  The  PIU  head  will  have  access  to \nsufficient  resources  to  ensure  that  all  environmental  management \nprovisions are included in the contract. \nThe PIU will monitor and record the implementation of the EMP prepared \nfor  the  Project,  under  the  guidance  of  the  State  Committee  for \nEnvironmental Protection-National Environment Protection Agency. \nThe PIU, with the assistance of the project management and supervision \nconsultant,  prepares  semiannual  environmental  reports  and  submits  to \nADB, within 3 months of the end of each half of the calendar year, from \nthe start of project implementation and until completion of the Project. The \nreport  will  include,  among  other  things,  a  review  of  progress  made  on \nenvironmental  measures  detailed  in  the  IEE  and  EMP,  and  problems \nencountered and remedial measures taken. \nDetailed  engineering  designs,  civil  works,  and  other  contracts  for  the \nProject facilities incorporate applicable environmental measures identified \nin the IEE and EMP. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n17\n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nCivil  works  contractor  is  supervised  to  ensure  compliance  with  the \nrequirements of the IEE and EMP. \n\n(e) \n \n \nProject  monitoring,  review,  and  reporting.  The  Government,  through  MPW, \nwill carry out the monitoring and evaluation of the Project in accordance with the \ndesign and monitoring framework agreed between the Government and ADB. \nLabor, gender, health, and social protection. The Government, through MPW, \nwill  include  a  specific  provision  in  the  EPC  contract  to  ensure  that  civil  works \nsubcontractors  (a)  comply  with  applicable  core  labor  standards  and  labor  laws, \nand  incorporate  applicable  workplace  occupational  safety  norms;  (b)  do  not \ndifferentiate  payment  between  men  and  women  for  work  of  equal  value;  (c)  do \nnot  employ  child  labor  in  construction  and  maintenance  activities;  (d) eliminate \nrespect  of \nforced  or  compulsory \nemployment;  (f)  allow  freedom  of  association;  and  (g)  to  the  extent  possible, \nmaximize  employment  of  local  poor  and  disadvantaged  persons  for  project \nconstruction, provided that the requirements for job and efficiency are adequately \nmet.  The  Government,  through  MPW,  will  ensure  that  appropriate  entities-for \nexample  nongovernment  organizations-disseminate  information  on  the  risks  of \nsexually  transmitted  infections,  including  HIV/AIDS,  to  the  employees  of  civil \nworks  contractors  engaged  under  the  Project  and  to  members  of  the  local \ncommunities surrounding the project railway, particularly females. \n \nThe Project is implemented (a) in compliance with ADB's Policy on Gender and \nDevelopment  (1998);  (b)  necessary  steps  are  taken  to  encourage  women  living \nin the project area to participate in the Project related activities; (c) in consultation \nwith  local  governments  and  communities,  and  nongovernment  organizations, \nindependent  monitoring \nthroughout \nimplementation of the Project. \n\n(e)  eliminate  discrimination \n\nis  carried  out  of \n\nthe  social \n\nimpacts \n\nlabor; \n\nin \n\n(viii)  Land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the \nProject  will  implement  LARP  and  follow  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy \n(1995). MPW will ensure that, subsequent to awarding civil works contract under \nthe Project, no notice to proceed is issued to contractors for respective sections \nor  parts  of  the  Project  until  the  applicable  provisions  of  the  LARP  (including  in \nparticular the timely delivery of compensation to affected families) and EMP have \nbeen complied with. \n \n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\nLARP  shall  be  prepared  in  consultation  with,  and  disclosed  to,  the \naffected persons. \nAll  land  and  rights  of  way  required  by  the  Project  shall  be  acquired  and \nmade available in a timely manner. \nAll  compensation  and  resettlement  assistance  shall  be  provided  to \naffected persons prior to their displacement and dispossession.  \nEfficient grievance redressal mechanism shall be in place in accordance \nwith  the  LARP  to  assist  affected  persons  in  resolving  queries  and \ncomplaints if any, in a timely manner. \nAdequate staff and resources shall be made available for supervising and \nmonitoring \nindependent  monitor \nacceptable to ADB shall be engaged to carry out external monitoring and \nevaluation  of  the  LARP  and  report  the  outcomes  to  ADB  semiannually. \nSemiannual reports shall be submitted to ADB within 3 months of the end \n\nimplementation  of \n\nthe  LARP.  An \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n(f) \n\nof  each  period  covered.  The  internal  monitoring  shall  be  carried  out  by \nMPW. \nIf  during  implementation  of  the  LARP,  any  changes  to  the  location, \nrailway  alignment,  or  additional  environmental  and/or  resettlement \nimpacts  are  identified,  the  LARP  shall  be  updated  and  prior  approval  by \nADB and the relevant government agency shall be obtained before further \nimplementation of the LARP. \n\n \nAny changes to the location, land alignment of railway, or environmental impacts \non account of detailed designs of related projects will be subject to prior approval \nby ADB and the relevant government agency. \nSecurity. The Government will make its best efforts to provide adequate security \nand demining measures for the smooth and uninterrupted implementation of the \nProject.  In  addition,  the  Government  will  ensure  that  the  civil  works  contracts \nhave  an  action  plan  for  adequate  security  and  smooth  and  uninterrupted \nimplementation  of  the  Project  and  that  the  cost  of  implementing  such  a  plan  is \nincluded in its budget. \nInstitutional. The railway agency will develop a plan to establish its institutional \nstructure with a goal to gradual and phased disassociation from the Government \nto attain financial and operational independence by Project completion. \nFunding  and  O&M. The Government will ensure that (a) additional funding will \nbe  provided  for  successful  Project  implementation;  and  (b)  in  each  fiscal  year \nadequate  funds  are  allocated  and/or  generated  for  O&M  and  that  the  Project \nfacilities  are  operated  and  maintained  according  to  sound  engineering  and \nbusiness practices. \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\n(xii) \n\n(xiii)  Financial  management.  MPW  will  ensure  that  it  will  establish  and  maintain  a \nsound  financial  management  system,  including  establishing  separate  bank \naccounts  and  maintaining  minimum  balances  to  ensure  smooth  cash  flow  and \nthe  timely  settlement  of  potential  project  construction  liabilities.  The  financial \nmanagement  system  shall  comprise  (a)  financial  planning,  budgeting  and \nbudgetary  control;  (b)  accounting  consistent  with  internationally  applicable \nstandards; (c) internal control; (d) data processing; and (e) financial reports. \n(xiv)  Auditing. MPW will ensure that the financial statements of the Project accounts \nwill  be  audited  annually  in  line  with  the  international  standards  and  ADB \nrequirements.  A  separate  auditor\u2019s  opinion  on  the  use  of  imprest  account  and \nstatement of expenditure will be incorporated in the audit reports. \n\n \nB. \n\nConditions for Disbursement \n\n82. \nNo  disbursements  from  the  grant  account  shall  be  made  for  the  Project  until  ADB  has \nreceived the Government\u2019s certification, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, that the PIU \nhas been established, has been adequately equipped and staffed as agreed with ADB, and has \nbecome fully operational to implement the Project. \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n83. \nI am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n19\n\nthe grant not exceeding $165,000,000 to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for \nthe  Hairatan  to  Mazar-e-Sharif  Railway  Project  from  ADB's  Special  Funds \nresources,  on  terms  and  conditions  that  are  substantially  in  accordance  with \nthose set forth in the draft Grant Agreement presented to the Board; and \n\nthe  proposal  set  forth  in  para.  45  of  this  report  that  rail  track  components \nprocured from non-member countries of ADB be eligible for financing under the \nHairatan  to  Mazar-e-Sharif  Railway  Project.  If  this  recommendation  is  not \napproved and the Board only approves the recommendation in para. 83(i), then \nrail  track  components  procured  only  from  member  countries  of  ADB  will  be \neligible for financing under the Project. \n\nC.

The  total  length  of  railways  is  25  km,  which  are  cross-border  extensions  from \nTurkmenistan  and  Uzbekistan  to  transshipment  yards  in  Torghandi  and  Hairatan,  respectively \n(about 10 km and 15 km from the respective borders). Inland waterways are limited to the Amu \nDarya and its tributaries,1 although only the formal inland port at Shirkhan Bandar is operational \nat present. There are more than 60 airports and airfields spread across the country. There are \ntwo  international  and  22  domestic  airports  that  meet  International  Civil  Aviation  Organization \n(ICAO)  Class  4  categorization  standards.2 By  2010,  the  Kabul  International  Airport  and  Herat \nAirport  are  expected  to  achieve  full  international  ICAO  compliance  while  Mazar-e-Sharif, \nJalalabad, and Kandahar airports will be upgraded.  \n \n2. \nAt the end of 2001, more than 90% of the transport system was unconnected and was in \npoor condition. Since then, the donors have helped improve key infrastructure, especially roads. \nAbout  86%  of  the  regional  road  network  is  scheduled  to  be  operational  by  end  2008  with  the \nremainder  to  be  completed  by  2010.  Work  is  underway  or  funding  has  been  obtained  for  the \nremaining  regional  roads,  with  the  exception  of  a  50  km  section  east  of  Herat.  The  improved \nroads  include  almost  2,100  km  (63%)  of  regional  roads,  650  km  (14%)  of  national  roads,  and \n6,000  km  of  provincial  and  rural  roads.  Roads  serve  90%  of  the  national  and  regional  travel \ndemand. \n \n3. \nRail services at Hairatan move about 250 wagons a day, while in Torghandi it is about \n50 wagons a day. The major imports are petroleum products and humanitarian food aid and at \nTorghandi, scrap metal is transshipped by truck to Pakistan. There is little reverse traffic except \nfor  some  seasonal  fruit.  The  Kabul  International  Airport  handled  approximately  0.5  million \ninternational  and  domestic  passengers  in  2005,  and  civil  aviation  generated  about  $40  million \nfrom commercial over flights and airport taxes.   \n \n4. \nIn 2007, registered vehicles included over 300,000 cars, 40,000 buses, 100,000 trucks, \n100,000  motorcycles,  and  5,000  rickshaws.  Vehicle  numbers  increased  rapidly,  with  annual \ngrowth over the past 3 years of 23% for cars, 15% for trucks, 48% for motorcycles, but only 2% \nfor buses and rickshaws. Virtually all vehicles are second-hand imports from Japan and Europe. \n \n5. \nDomestic  air  passenger  and  freight  services  are  provided  by  the  state  carrier  and \nseveral  private  carriers.  At  least  daily  flights  are  available  between  Kabul  and  most  cities.  \nInternational  services  between  Kabul  and  several  Asian  destinations  are  provided  by  both \nnational  and  international  carriers.  Airport  facilities  are  limited  and  in  a  poor  state  of  repair. \nBesides  Kabul,  Mazar-e-Sharif  is  the  only  main  airport  due  for  major  reconstruction  and \nexpansion.  A  new  3,000  meter  runway  is  being  constructed.  About  600  meters  of  the  existing \nrunway are being repaired, including new taxiways. This will increase capacity for the intermodal \nflow of commercial goods. \n \n\n                                                 \n1  Dachiku,  Kiyoshi  and  Azeem  Tahir.  2002.

A \nroad bridge across the Pyanzh River near Shirkhan Bandar was completed in 2007 with funding \nfrom the United States Agency for International Development. The traffic potential through this \nborder crossing is significant and plans are being made for full border facilities. \n \n7. \nTwo hundred and fifty-three private bus companies\u2014135 based in Kabul and 118 in the \nprovinces\u2014with a fleet of 38,568 buses operate intercity services on the regional and national \nroads.  The  remaining  buses  are  8-  to  12-seat  vans  owned  by  individuals  providing  informal \npassenger  transport  services  in  the  cities  and  connections  between  rural  areas  and  towns.  \nThe only cross-border bus service is between Jalalabad and Peshawar. An estimated 45 million \npassenger trips were made by bus transport in 2005.  \n \n8. \nMore than 150 registered taxi companies operate in the country\u201453 in Kabul with a fleet \nof  16,309  taxis  and  108  in  the  provinces  with  a  fleet  of  30,248.  In  2007,  the  taxi  fares  varied \nfrom  $0.01/km  to  $0.03/km  depending  on  various  classes  of  passenger  vehicles  and  terrain \ntypes  for  paved  roads,  whereas  it  varied  from  $0.015/km  to  $0.03/km  for  unpaved  roads. \nOperators pay a 3% commission to the Government at provincial or national borders and at the \noutskirts of major towns. \n \nFreight is carried primarily in private owned trucks. The truck population is approximately \n9. \n20% heavy articulated trucks with the remaining 80% divided equally into heavy, medium, and \nlight  or  pickup  classes.  Freight  charges  are  approximately  $0.07/ton-km  on  paved  roads  and \n$0.08/ton-km on unpaved roads. A 5% commission per trip is levied by the Government. There \nare  no  special  transit  charges  and  foreign  trucks  transporting  freight  through  Afghanistan  are \ncharged the 5% commission only. \n \nB. \n\nInstitutional and Regulatory Frameworks \n\n10.  Multiple  government  ministries  are  involved  in  operating  and  regulating  the  transport \nsector: Ministry of Public Works (MPW), Ministry of Transportation and Civil Aviation, Ministry of \nUrban  Development  (MOUD),  Ministry  of  Rural  Rehabilitation  and  Development  (MRRD),  and \nthe Ministry of Interior (MOI). Local authorities are also involved. In the road subsector, MPW is \nassigned  the  responsibility  for  planning,  designing,  constructing,  and  maintaining  regional, \nnational,  and  provincial  roads.  MRRD  is  responsible  for  rural  roads,  and  MOUD  and  the  local \nauthorities  administer  the  urban  roads.  There  have  been  discussions  at  a  high  level  about \ngovernance of the sector transitioning to international best practices within the Afghan context. \nThis  is  expected  to  be  achieved  by  merging  the  MPW  and  the  Ministry  of  Transportation  and \nCivil  Aviation,  plus  those  units  in  MRRD,  MOI,  and  MOUD  dealing  with  transport  into  a  single \nMinistry of Transport by 2009.  \n \n11.  MPW has a workforce of approximately 200 engineers and administrative staff, as well \nas  2,000  laborers  at  the  regional  maintenance  centers  and  provinces.  At  present,  however,  it \nserves  as  administrator  for  donor-financed  projects  and  executor  of  budget-financed  minor \nconstruction  and  maintenance  works.  MOTCA  issues  operating  and  transit  permits,  sets \ntechnical  standards  and  tariffs,  collects  road-user  fees,  and  enforces  standards  and  tariffs. \nIt also provides passenger and freight transport services using state-owned vehicles. Legislation \nin 2008 has authorized the Government to provide nationwide freight and passenger services. \nMOI carries out vehicle registration and administers driver training, testing, and driver licensing. \n \n \n\n \n\n\f24 \n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nC. \n\nPolicy and Legal Frameworks \n\n12. \nAfghanistan  is  yet  to  formulate  a  transport  policy.  However,  the  Afghanistan  National \nDevelopment Strategy, which was launched in April 2008, guides investment and reforms in the \nsector.  In  the  road  subsector,  the  MPW  Strategy  under  the  ANDS  calls  for  investments  to \nupgrade and maintain the Ring Road and roads to neighboring countries by the end of 2009, as \nwell as to establish a fiscally sustainable system for road maintenance using private contractors \nas much as possible by 2008. Also, it calls for 40% of all villages to be connected by all-weather \nroads  to  the  national  road  system  and  40%  of  all  roads  in  municipalities  to  be  improved  to  a \ngood  standard  by  2010.  The  current  situation  is  that  86%  of  the  regional  road  network  is \nscheduled  for  completion  by  end-2008  and  the  remaining  length  will  completed  by  2009  or \n2010. \n \n13. \nIn  addition  to  the  Civil  Aviation  Law,  Law  of  Highway  Traffic,  Law  on  Regulating \nMovement  and  Function  of  Land  Transportation  Vehicles,  Law  for  Punishment  of  Transport \nViolators,  and  Law  for  International  Transit  and  Transport,  which  have  direct  relevance  to  the \nsector,  much  new  legislation  affecting  its  performance  has  been  enacted  or  existing  laws \namended in the past 5 years. Among these are the Environment Law, Law on Preservation of \nHistoric and Cultural Artifacts, Customs Law, Procurement Law, and the Law on Taxing Driving \nPermits for Motor Vehicles. \n \nD. \n\nGovernment Plan for Railway Development \n\n14. \nRailway  development  is  a  solution  to  improve  undeveloped  regional  connectivity  as \nshown  in  the  problem  tree  analysis  (Figure  A2).  There  are  proposals  to  construct  three  new \nrailway links into Afghanistan; one from the Pakistan border at Chaman to Kandahar; one from \nSangan, in Iran territory, to Herat and the third from Hairatan (in Afghanistan, opposite from the \nUzbekistan town of Termez) to Mazar-e-Sharif. The only one of these routes where railway track \nexists  within  Afghanistan  territory  is  in  the  Afghan  town  of  Hairatan.  Another  rail  line  enters \nAfghanistan  at  Torghandi,  just  across  the  Turkmenistan  border.  The  line  terminates  at \nTorghandi  with  commodities  (mostly  fuel)  transshipped  to  Afghan  trucks  for  further  movement \nwithin Afghanistan. The existing rail line from Termez, in Uzbekistan, currently terminates at the \nAfghanistan border town of Hairatan. Freight destined for Afghanistan, or beyond, is off-loaded \nat Hairatan and reloaded to Afghan trucks for movement through Afghanistan. \n \n15. \nThe  Government  plans  to  develop  a  railway  network  in  north  Afghanistan  with  three \nmain  sections:  (i)  Hairatan  to  Mazar-e-Sharif,  (ii)  Mazar-e-Sharif  to  Herat,  and  (iii)  Mazar-e-\nSharif  to  Tajikistan.  The  Government  top  priority  is  to  construct  a  new  railway  line  linking \nHairatan with Mazar-e-Sharif. The primary transit traffic would be export cotton while most traffic \ndestined  for  Afghanistan  moving  through  this  border  post  is  fuel.  At  the  present  time,  most  of \nUzbekistan export cotton is moved by rail through Turkmenistan and Iran to the port of Bandar \nAbbas. An extension of the rail line into Afghanistan would make the new route to Charbakhar \nmore attractive. \n \nRail links to Afghanistan are important as bulk commodities (such as fuel) are brought to \n16. \nthe Afghanistan border by rail, then transshipped to truck for the movement within the country. \nTransport costs of bulk commodities are typically cheaper by rail than road; therefore, extension \nof these existing rail lines into Afghanistan would result in significant savings of transport costs \nfor  this  strategic  commodity.  While  Afghanistan  has  no  railways  at  the  present  time,  rail \ntransport costs can be estimated using results from studies recently undertaken in neighboring \ncountries. This comparison of road and rail transport costs results in a savings of $0.0256 per \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n25\n \n\nton kilometer. This differential in transport costs represents savings in transport costs if the rail \nis used, instead of road.  \n \n17. \nConstruction of a railway line through part of Afghanistan would improve the route that \nmay well generate this increase in cotton exports through Afghanistan. Considering only the fuel \nimports  plus  the  potential  for  cotton  movements,  a  total  estimated  traffic  volume  of  nearly  1 \nmillion tons could be moved over a new railway line. \n \nHairatan  station  had  a  capacity  of  handling  600  wagons  per  day.  But  the  capacity  has \n18. \nbeen  reduced  because  many  of  the  yard  lines  are  age-old,  deplorable  and  unsafe  for  train \noperation  (only  32  km  out  of  40  km  is  operative).  Uzbekistan  Railways  plans  to  augment  the \nwagon handling capacity from 300\u2013400 wagons a day to about 1,000 wagons (200\u2013280 trains) \na day. Majority of the traffic (more than 50%) handled in Hairatan is petroleum oil. The rests are \ntimber, steel, and food grains. \n \n\nFigure A2: Problem Tree Analysis \n\n \n\n \n\nUnsustainable Development \n\nInefficient Transport System \n\nLack and High Cost of \nTransport Services \n\nLow Transport Infrastructure \nDensity  \n\nUnderdeveloped Regional \nConnectivity \n\n \n \nPoor \nInfrastructure \n\n \n \nLimited \nTransport \nProviders \n\n \n \nLimited \nNetwork \n\n \nInadequate \nLand Use \nPlanning \n\n \n \nCross-border \nBottlenecks \n\n \n\n \nUndeveloped \nRailway \nPotentials \n\n \n \nLack of \nPlanning \n\nLimited Budget for Investment and Maintenance \n\nLack of Sector Coordination and \nHuman Resource Capacity \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fItem \n\nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES \n\n \n% of \n\n \nTotal \nCost  Base Cost \n  \n\nBy Financier \n\n% \n\n% \n\nADB \n\nADB  GOVT GOVT \n\n2\n6\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n3\n \n\ni\n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n0.5\n130.0\n4.0\n0.7\n4.5\n139.7\n\na.

Gross domestic product grew on average by about 11% per year. To accommodate the \ngrowing  demand  for  freight  transport,  two  options  could  be  considered:  (i)  expansion  of  the \nexisting road, or (ii) building of a new railway line between Hairatan and Mazar-e-Sharif.  \n \n2. \nTransport  costs  of  bulk  commodities  are  typically  cheaper  by  rail  than  road;  therefore, \nbuilding a new railway line would result in significant savings of transport costs. The new railway \nline  will  also  divert  the  road  transport  to  rail  that  reduces  the  transport  costs  by  road,  traffic \naccidents, pollution, and green house gasses. The diversion of road to rail freight will reduce the \nroad maintenance costs. It demonstrates that the proposed railway is the least cost option for \nmeeting the growing freight demand. \n \nThe  potential  demand  for  freight  by  rail  is  estimated  at  about  5,000  ton/day  at  the  first \n3. \nyear of operation and in 2026 will reach approximately 30,000 ton/day, which is considered as \nthe maximum capacity of the railway line.  \n \nThe existing rail line from Termez in Uzbekistan currently terminates at the Afghanistan \n4. \nborder town of Hairatan. Freight destined for Afghanistan, or beyond, is off-loaded at Hairatan \nand  reloaded  to  Afghan  trucks  for  movement  in  or  through  Afghanistan.  The  Project  will \nconstruct a new railway line linking Hairatan with Mazar-e-Sharif (approximately 75 kilometers) \nand  rehabilitate  the  marshalling  yard  in  Hairatan.  The  new  railway  line  will  eventually  be \nextended to the southwest of the country to the Iranian border and to the port of Charbakhar.  \n \n5. \nThe Project railway line is part of the larger railway network in Afghanistan. The Project \nbenefits will be higher once the railway network is completed. In the long run, the primary transit \ntraffic  through  Afghanistan  will  potentially  be  cotton  from  Uzbekistan.  At  present,  most  of \nUzbekistan's cotton export is moved by rail through Turkmenistan and Iran to the port of Bandar \nAbbas. An extension of the rail line into Afghanistan would make the new route to Charbakhar \nPort  in  Iran  more  attractive.  These  cotton  exports  could  be  routed  through  Afghanistan  to  the \nport of Charbakhar, if the route is to be constructed and improved. However, this will unlikely to \nhappen within the short period and therefore will not be quantified in the economic analysis. \n \nB. \n\nDemand Forecast \n\n6. \nThe  freight  traffic  on  the  existing  Hairatan\u2013Naibabad\u2013Mazar-e-Sharif  road  was  first \nprojected. Then, the diversion potential of the freight traffic to the railway mode was considered.  \nThe  growth  rates  of  freight  travel  demand  have  been  obtained  by  multiplying  the  elasticity  of \ndemand of freight traffic at the national level with respect to the dominant economic parameter \nwith the expected growth rate of dominant economic parameter.   \n \n7. \nThe freight rail traffic is expected from regional freight currently transported by trucks and \ncombined rail and truck. The freight can be divided into general and bulk cargo (mostly oil and \ngas  from  Uzbekistan).  It  is  assumed  that  oil  and  gas  transported  by  rail  will  continue  to  be \ntransported by rail to be unloaded in Mazar-e-Sharif. General cargo is transported by either rail \nor  rail-road  transport.  General  cargo  currently  transported  by  rail  will  likely  to  use  the  new \nrailway and some of those transported by road will shift to rail-road transport. Some will continue \nusing road transport especially those originating from or going to cities beyond Naibabad. \n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n33\n \n\nC. \n\nEconomic Analysis Approach \n\n8. \nAn  economic  analysis  was  carried  out  comparing  with-  and  without-project  scenarios. \nThe  base  case  reflects  expected  conditions  in  the  absence  of  the  Project,  with  maintenance \nsufficient  only  to  hold  the  railway  in  its  present  condition.  The  project  case  involves  initial \ninvestment followed by routine and periodic maintenance, but with expenditure and frequency of \nperiodic  maintenance  economically  optimum.  All  costs  and benefits  are  expressed  in  constant \nmid-2009 prices. The economic analysis covers the construction period of 2 years plus 25 years \nof operation and maintenance. \n \n9. \nEconomic analysis was conducted using border price numeraire. A standard conversion \nfactor  for  non-tradable  goods  was  applied  to  calculate  the  economic  price  of  non-tradable \ngoods. The shadow wage rates for skilled and unskilled labor were estimated by comparing the \naverage  labor  wage  in  the  region  and  the  project  labor  wage,  taking  into  consideration  the \nexisting  unemployment  rate.  The  shadow  wage  rates  for  skilled  and  unskilled  labor  were \nadjusted by the standard conversion factor.  \n \nThe  economic  costs  were  estimated  based  on  financial  costs,  including  physical \n10. \ncontingencies. Price escalation, contingencies, and taxes were excluded. Financial costs were \nconverted into economic costs using specific conversion factors of 0.98 for civil works and 0.90 \nfor railway maintenance. A specific conversion factor of 0.85 was used to convert the financial \nprice of transport cost and time value savings. Economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) were \ncalculated for various scenarios to evaluate the economic viability of the Project. \n \nD. \n\nEconomic Cost \n\n11. \nThe initial investment for civil works will be implemented over a 2-year period of 2009\u2013\n2010. The economic cost (taxes excluded) is summarized in Table A7.1. A residual value at the \nend of evaluation period is estimated at 20% of the initial investment.  \n \n\nTable A7.1: Unit Costs  \n \n\nCost \n$156.3 million (base cost and physical contingencies). \n1% of the capital cost per year  \n\n5% of capital cost in years 2016 and 2026  \n\nWorks \nCapital works \nRoutine maintenance and \noperation \nPeriodic maintenance  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\n1. \n\nFreight cost savings \n\nThe  primary  economic  benefits  are  freight  cost  savings.  The  cost  of  rail  transport  is \n12. \nestimated at $0.07 per ton-kilometer. An interview survey with freight forwarders shows that the \nroad transport cost for freight amounts to about $0.14 per ton-kilometer, resulting in a transport \ncost savings of $0.07 per ton-kilometer. \n \n \n\nTruck productivity gained \n\n2. \n\n13. \nThe trucks will not be required to travel to Hairatan either to load or unload their goods. \nThis  will  cause  savings  of  time  and  hence  increased  truck  productivity  especially  for  trucks \ncarrying  general  cargoes.  About  50%  of  the  trucks  will  benefit  from  2-3  hours  per  day  time \nsavings.  \n\n \nE. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n \n\n3. \n\nTime savings due to marshalling yard improvement \n\n14. \nThe  primary  economic  benefits  of  the  marshalling  yard  improvement  consist  of  lower \nshunting  costs,  reduced  wagon  detention  in  the  yard,  less  waiting  time  outside  the  yard,  and \nless  damage  to  wagons  and  freight.  It  is  assumed  that  the  improved  marshalling  yard  at \nHairatan will save 20 minutes handling per wagon. Valuation of commodity time is derived from \na truck net income estimate.  \n \n \n\nOther benefits \n\n4. \n\n15. \nThe Project will generate the benefit from the reduction in traffic accidents, pollution, and \ngreen house gasses. Carbon dioxide rate for freight rail is only about 10% of that of freight road. \nThe external cost saving estimates range from $7 to $70 per 1000 ton-kilometer.1 Benefits from \ngenerated  road  traffic  may  be  expected  but  is  assumed  to  be  negligible  in  the  base  case \nanalysis.  The  Project  will  also  reduce  the  road  maintenance  cost  due  to  lower  heavy  vehicle \ntraffic.  These  benefits  are  not  quantified  but  estimated  at  20%  of  the  quantifiable  benefits  for \nsensitivity analysis. \n \nF. \n\nResults \n\n16. \nA  summary  of  the  economic  analysis  is  presented  in  Table  A7.2.  The  Project  is \neconomically viable since it produces an EIRR of 15% and the EIRR will become 17% if other \nbenefits  as  defined  above  was  taken  into  account  The  Project  will  also  (i)  contribute  to \npromoting related development in the region and provide local benefits to the rest of society; (ii) \nstrengthen  the  Government\u2019s  broader  strategy  of  developing  strategic  corridors;  and  (iii)  be \nstrategically important to international trade. \n\n                                                 \n1  The  estimate  based  on  the  study  conducted  by  D.

The  first  study  undertaken  in  the  United  States  showed  the  savings  of \nabout $6/1,000 ton-kilometer, while the second performed for the European countries demonstrated a much higher \nsaving of $70/1,000 ton-kilometer. Both figures are only for accident, pollution, and green gas houses savings. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n35\n \n\nTable A7.2: Summary of Economic Analysis \n($ million) \n\nYear  \n\nCapital \nCost \n\nMaintenance \nCost  \n\nFreight \nCost \nSavings \n\nTruck \nProductivity \nGain Benefits \n\nWaiting Time \nValue Savings \n\nNet \nBenefits \n\n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \n2018 \n2019 \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \n2025 \n2026 \n2027 \n2028 \n2029 \n2030 \n2031 \n2032 \n2033 \n2034 \n2035 \n\n15.37 \n138.30 \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n(30.73) \n \n\n0.00 \n0.00 \n1.41 \n1.41 \n1.41 \n1.41 \n1.41 \n7.05 \n1.41 \n1.41 \n1.41 \n1.41 \n1.41 \n1.41 \n1.41 \n1.41 \n1.41 \n7.05 \n1.41 \n1.41 \n1.41 \n1.41 \n1.41 \n1.41 \n1.41 \n1.41 \n1.41 \n \n\n0 \n0 \n9.01 \n10.14 \n11.41 \n12.85 \n14.46 \n16.27 \n18.31 \n20.61 \n23.19 \n26.10 \n29.37 \n33.05 \n37.20 \n41.86 \n47.11 \n53.02 \n53.02 \n53.02 \n53.02 \n53.02 \n53.02 \n53.02 \n53.02 \n53.02 \n53.02 \n \n\n0 \n0 \n1.59 \n1.79 \n2.02 \n2.27 \n2.56 \n2.88 \n3.24 \n3.64 \n4.10 \n4.61 \n5.19 \n5.84 \n6.58 \n7.40 \n8.33 \n9.38 \n9.38 \n9.38 \n9.38 \n9.38 \n9.38 \n9.38 \n9.38 \n9.38 \n9.38 \n \n \n\n0 \n0 \n0.09 \n0.10 \n0.11 \n0.13 \n0.14 \n0.16 \n0.18 \n0.20 \n0.23 \n0.26 \n0.29 \n0.33 \n0.37 \n0.41 \n0.46 \n0.52 \n0.52 \n0.52 \n0.52 \n0.52 \n0.52 \n0.52 \n0.52 \n0.52 \n0.52 \n \n \n\n  (15.37) \n (138.30) \n9.28 \n10.63 \n12.14 \n13.83 \n15.75 \n12.26 \n20.32 \n23.04 \n26.11 \n29.56 \n33.44 \n37.81 \n42.73 \n48.27 \n54.50 \n55.87 \n61.51 \n61.51 \n61.51 \n61.51 \n61.51 \n61.51 \n61.51 \n61.51 \n92.24 \n14.5% \n\nEIRR \nNet present value (at 12% discount rate) \n( ) = negative. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n17. \nSensitivity  tests  were  carried  out  to  assess  the  impact  of  different  benefit  and  cost \nattributes.  Under  a  combined  freight  cost  savings  reduced  by  20%  and  the  construction  costs \nincreased by 10%2, the EIRR is estimated at 12%. Assuming that there is no productivity gained \nby  the  trucks,  the  Project  remains  economically  viable  with  EIRR  of  13%.  The  reduction  of \nfreight  diversion  rate  from  30%  to  25%  will  reduce  the  EIRR  to  13%.

Constant mid-2009 \nprices were used to calculate the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) and weighted average \ncost of capital (WACC). The incremental cash flows included all payments incurred to construct, \noperate, and maintain the Project facilities over its useful life. Taxes and physical contingencies \nwere included, but price contingencies were excluded. Salvage value of 20% was considered at \nthe end of the Project. The revenue generated from fixed fees or revenue sharing arrangements \nwith a prospective train operator (in this case UTY) is the main source of operating cash inflow.  \nThe  resulting  FIRR  is  estimated  at  4.5%  and  WACC  at  1.9%.  This  is  based  on  generating \nminimum  revenue  of  at  least  35%  of  rail  freight  transport  tariff  assumed  to  be  $0.07/ton-\nkilometers.  \n \nC. \n\nWeighted Average Cost of Capital \n\n3. \nIt  was  assumed  that  ADB  incurs  an  opportunity  cost  of  3%  based  on  a  5  year  forward \nLondon  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR).  The  real  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  was \ncalculated at 1.9%. Table A8.1 illustrates how the WACC was derived.  \n\n \nTable A8.1: Weighted Average Cost of Capital \n \n\nItem \nAmount ($ million) \nWeighting \nNominal Cost \nTax Rate \nTax-Adjusted Nominal Cost \nInflation Rate \nReal Cost \nWeighted Component of WACC  \nWeighted Average Cost of Capital (real) \n\nADB \n165 \n97% \n3.00% \n3.00% \n2.91% \n1.00% \n1.89% \n1.84% \n1.87% \n\nGovernment \n4.5 \n3% \n7.00% \n0.00% \n7.00% \n6.00% \n0.94% \n0.03% \n\n  \n\n \n \n \n \n\n  \n\nTotal \n169.5 \n100% \n \n\n1.87% \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, WACC = weighted average cost of capital. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005.

The  railway  operation  will  be  done  under  a \nleasing  agreement  between  the  train  operator  (UTY)  and  the  Government.  The  Project's \nfinancial  viability  depends  on  the  revenue  sharing  between  UTY  and  the  railway  agency.  The \nProject will be financially viable if the revenue from the Government comprises about 35% of the \ntariff. Without accounting for capital expenditure, about 3% of tariff will breakeven. As a result, \nabout  $0.025/ton-kilometers  of  fee  recovered  from  UTY  generates  a  financial  internal  rate  of \nreturn (FIRR) of 4.5% and a WACC of 1.9%. \n \n\nTable A8.2: Financial Analysis for Rail Equipment  \n($ million) \n\nYear \n\nCash Outflow \n\nCash Inflow \n\nCapital \nExpenditure \n   15.57 \n140.13 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(31.14) \n \n \n\nOperating \nOutflows \n0.00 \n0.00 \n1.56 \n1.56 \n1.56 \n1.56 \n1.56 \n7.79 \n1.56 \n1.56 \n1.56 \n1.56 \n1.56 \n1.56 \n1.56 \n1.56 \n1.56 \n7.79 \n1.56 \n1.56 \n1.56 \n1.56 \n1.56 \n1.56 \n1.56 \n1.56 \n1.56 \n \n \n\n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \n2018 \n2019 \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \n2025 \n2026 \n2027 \n2028 \n2029 \n2030 \n2031 \n2032 \n2033 \n2034 \n2035 \n \n \n\nOperating \nInflows \n0.00 \n0.00 \n3.57 \n4.02 \n4.52 \n5.09 \n5.73 \n6.44 \n7.25 \n8.16 \n9.19 \n10.34 \n11.63 \n13.09 \n14.73 \n16.58 \n18.66 \n21.00 \n21.00 \n21.00 \n21.00 \n21.00 \n21.00 \n21.00 \n21.00 \n21.00 \n21.00 \nFIRR \nNPV \n\nNet Free Cash \nFlow \n    (15.57) \n        (140.13) \n2.01 \n2.46 \n2.96 \n3.53 \n4.17 \n     (1.34) \n5.70 \n6.60 \n7.63 \n8.78 \n10.08 \n11.53 \n13.18 \n15.02 \n17.10 \n13.22 \n19.44 \n19.44 \n19.44 \n19.44 \n19.44 \n19.44 \n19.44 \n19.44 \n50.58 \n       4.48% \n  79.17 \n\n(  )  =  negative,  FIRR  =  financial  internal  rate  of  return,  NPV  =  net  present  value,  WACC  = \nweighted average cost of capital.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n                                                 \n2  The  European  Conference  of  Ministers  of  Transport.  2005.

The  Project  is  consistent  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)'s \nCountry Partnership Strategy (2009\u20132013), which aims to enhance pro-poor economic growth through transport infrastructure \ndevelopment. The railway will serve as a key transport link for Afghanistan because it has significant mineral, industrial, and \nagricultural  potential,  which  requires  a  reliable  and  cost-effective  transport  system.  From  the  neighboring  countries  like \nUzbekistan,  Tajikistan,  Turkmenistan,  Pakistan,  all  imports  and  transit  goods  are  brought  to  the  borders  by  rail,  and  then \ntransshipped onto the trucks for movement within Afghanistan or across the borders. The extraction of natural resources from \nmajor mines in Afghanistan requires a sustainable and safe mode of transport. Although the road network, which carries the \nmajority of the country's freight and passenger traffic, is being improved, the transport system remains inadequate, inefficient, \nand  unsafe.  Only  half  of  the  roads  that  connect  24  provinces  of  the  country  are  serviceable  throughout  the  year,  greatly \nrestricting job creation and economic growth. A railway network will complement roads. It will (i) offer an affordable means of \nmass  transport  for  sustained  growth  and  poverty  reduction,  (ii)  form  part  of  an  integrated  multimodal  transport  system  to \nenable  seamless  connectivity  from  origin  to  destination  for  goods  and  passengers,  and  (iii)  link  this  landlocked  country  to \nnearby seaports and trade centers.  \n \nThe  Project  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  by  (i)  constructing  a  railway  line  in  the  northern  region  of  Afghanistan,  (ii) \nserving  the  country  by  increased  economic  development,  employment  opportunities,  and  (iii)  contributing  to  the  social  and \neconomic development in the region by facilitating the increased mobility and accessibility of goods across Afghanistan. The \nProject will increase access to urban markets for both agricultural and mineral products, and improve rural people access to \neducation and health facilities.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nThe  development  of  the  Project  area  is  suffering  with  insufficient  resources  of  supply  and  high  prices  of  agricultural  inputs, \nconsumable goods, and construction materials. Local communities are not connected with regular transport system. Initiative \nfor local investment and scope of employment is handicapped. All such situations due to insufficient and unsecured transport \nsystem. The community people deprived from uniform delivery of health services and technical and higher education.  \n \nThere is no official data on the rate of poverty for Afghanistan or the provinces. ADB estimated about 53% of Afghan people \nliving in poverty. Most of them have a very low income. On average it is estimated about $2 per household per day. Including \nsmall  farmers,  landless  laborers,  ex-combatants,  war  widows,  war  orphans,  debtors,  sharecroppers,  returning  refugees, \ninternally displaced persons about six million Afghans are vulnerable.  \n \nThe main causes of poverty in the project areas are insufficient scope of irrigation, lack of infrastructure, and very limited and \nunsustainable  sources  of  livelihood.  Drought  is  one  the  major  constraints  for  agriculture  and  livelihoods  development  in \nAfghanistan. \n \nThe construction and operation of the project railway line will generate significant employment in local communities, which will \nbe  targeted  at  local  communities  with  high  priorities  for  the  poor  and  vulnerable  people  of  surrounding  villages  or \ncommunities. Construction access and roads connecting to the railway will directly benefit poor villages by helping extend the \nproject  benefits  and  opportunities  to  the  poor  communities.  Station  area  development  will  encourage  small  business \ndevelopment  among  local  people,  including  women  and  the  poor.  The  scope  of  local  and  rural  industries  will  be  increased, \nwhich will create jobs for the poor and vulnerable peoples.  \n\nThe Project will enable local people and community to get easy access to market network and social services by creating a \nsafe and cheaper transport network. Prices of essential commodities and construction materials will be cut. The initiative for \nrural and industrial development through exploiting local resources will increase. Local production and employment as well as \nincome  level  of  the  local  people  will  increase.  The  affordability  and  capacity  will  increase,  which  will  contribute  to  poverty \nreduction. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n41\n\n2.  Design Features \n \nThe Project will involve civil and railway works, using mostly machinery and skilled labor. Only a limited number of unskilled \nlabor will be needed during construction and maintenance. There will be small business opportunities to local poor at station \nareas during operation. \n \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nPoverty  and  social  assessment  has  been  prepared  based  on  secondary  data  and  consultation  and  meeting  at  different \nstages. Detailed poverty profile will be prepared through socioeconomic base line surveys. \n\nAccess to education in Afghanistan is limited. The primary gross enrolment rate has been recently estimated at 39% for boys \nand 3% for girls. According to the World Bank report (2002), infant mortality is estimated to be one of the highest in the world \nat around 165 per 1,000 live births, while 257 of every 1,000 live births die before they are five. The maternal mortality rate is \nestimated to be 1,700 per 100,000 live births, and life expectancy at birth is estimated at around 41 years of age.  \n\nAlthough Afghanistan has no significant  experience of vulnerability  of HIV/AIDS, there  will be need of increased awareness \nbecause the bigger transport infrastructure network may bears  risk of spreading of HIV/AIDS. Local government institutions \nand nongovernment organizations should be assigned responsibilities for information campaigning and supporting activities. \n\nThe  benefits  of  the  Project  can  be  classified  as  direct  and  indirect.  Direct  beneficiaries  include  the  people  who  will  be \nemployed  under  the  Project,  start  business  in  the  railway  stations,  and  use  this  railway  services  for  carrying  the  goods  for \nbusiness.  The  community  as  whole  will  be  the  indirect  beneficiaries  of  Project  as  they  will  have  scope  receiving  social \nservices and buying consumer goods and services at comparatively cheaper prices.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nConsultations were conducted on 20, 27, 30 July and 8 August 2009 at Taza Omed, Gore-e-More, Qalinbafan\u2019s Camp and \nHairatan, respectively. The issues discussed in the consultations included merits and demerits of the railway alignment, and \nland acquisition, and resettlement. The consultations were open for all to share and exchange views, ideas, and experiences. \nConsultation held with the people of Qalinbafan\u2019s Camp village on 14 August 2009 reassessed affected land, and presented \nposition and ownership of land and its price. Discussion held with the Ministry of Public Works on 14 August 2009 focused on \nissues relating to affected land, prices of land, and the process of compensation. \n \nDecisions and Recommendations of the Consultation Sessions are: \nRailway must go through government land; agriculture land should not be used because it is limited for production; affected \npeople  should  get  cash  compensation  of  any  affected  property  including  land  so  that  they  can  use  the  money  according  to \ntheir choice; they expressed their interest to establish the Project railway line because they  will have safe transpiration and \nthe prices will be cheaper and business facilities will be increased. \n \nIn  conclusion  of  each  consultation,  local  people  welcomed  this  Project  as  they  believe  the  Project  will  contribute  to  their \nsocioeconomic development. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \n \n\nC.  Gender and Development \n\n Yes    \n\n No  \n\n1.  Key Issues \n \nIn  Afghanistan  women  are  generally  denied  of  their  rights  in  participating  in  decision-making  in  the  community,  acquiring \neducation, and having adequate food and nutrition. Most literature indicates that women in the country are given lower status \nthan men. In practice, men exercise control over all aspects of women\u2019s lives in accordance to traditional value. \n \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\n \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nCulturally,  women\u2019s  role  is  limited  to  home  or  homestead  as  mothers  and  housewives  help  the  family  in  their  farming \nactivities. Sometimes they go to bazaar to purchase household items. In rural areas, they collect wood for fuel and drinking \nwater from well or river from the distance of one or two kilometers in some cases. \nThe Project is not expected to exacerbate gender inequities. It offers the possibility of increasing female participation in the \npaid  labor  force.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION \n\n \nAre social indicators included in the design and monitoring framework to facilitate monitoring of social development activities \nand/or social impacts during project implementation?  \n\n  Yes  (Reduced travel time)   \u25a1   No  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n44 \n \n\nSUMMARY SOCIAL SAFEGUARDS \n\n1. \nThe  Government  of  Afghanistan  has  requested  ADB  for  a  grant  for  the  Hairatan  to \nMazar-e-Sharif  Railway  Project.  The  Project,  with  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works  (MPW)  as  the \nexecuting agency, will include the construction of about 75 km-long railway between Hairatan and \nMazar-e-Sharif, with a station in the proximity of the Mazar-e-Sharif Airport.  \n \nA. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n2. \nThe  Project  entails  minor  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts  since  most  of  the \nrailway's  route  passes  through  uninhabited  and  unused  desert  land.  Along  the  75  km  railway \nbetween  Hairatan  and  Mazar-e-Sharif,  the  impacts  are  only  two  residential  plots  without  any \nstructure built on the plots. The two affected households will have to be compensated for their \nland.  \n \n3. \nTo plan the compensation of these impacts MPW has prepared a short land acquisition \nand resettlement plan (LARP). The document fit the provisions of the relevant Afghanistan laws, \nADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995),  and  Operations  Manual  F2  on  Involuntary \nResettlement  (2006).  Based  on  ADB's  policy,  project  appraisal  and  implementation  will  entail \nthe following land acquisition and resettlement related conditions: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nProject appraisal will be conditional to the LARP approval by the Government and \nADB and to their disclosure; \nProvision  of  notice  to  proceed  to  contractors  will  be  conditional  to  the  full \nimplementation of the LARP. \n\n \n4. \nThe  LARP  provides  clear  implementation  principles,  compensation  eligibility,  and \nentitlements  provisions.  It  lists  the  following  principles:  (i)  LAR  will  be  avoided  or  at  least \nminimized; (ii) compensation will guarantee the maintenance of the pre-project living standards \nof  the  people  affected;  (iii)  those  affected  will  be  fully  informed/consulted  on  compensation \noptions;  (iv)  their  socio-cultural  institutions  will  be  supported  and  used;  (v)  LAR  provisions  will \nequally apply to women and men; (vi) lack of formal title will not be a bar to compensation and \nrehabilitation; (vii) particular attention will be paid to female-headed households and vulnerable \ngroups;  (viii)  LAR  will  be  conceived  and  executed  as  an  integral  part  of  the  project  and  LAR \nbudgets  will  be  included  in  project  costs;  and  (ix)  compensation  will  be  fully  provided  prior  to \nground leveling and demolition. LARP also covers all issues relevant for effectively conducting \nLAR tasks in compliance with ADB policy (see next paragraphs).  \n \n5. \nInstitutional  Responsibilities:  MPW  has  overall  responsibility  for  LARP  preparation, \nimplementation, and financing and will exercise its functions a land acquisition and resettlement \nunit  tasked  with  management,  planning,  and  implementation  of  all  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement tasks. MPW will coordinate with the local governments that have jurisdiction over \nland administration, title verification, and valuation. Beside MPW and the local governments, the \nMinistry of Finance will be responsible for providing the required funds for land acquisition and \nresettlement  to  MPW.  The  local  Jirgas  will  assist  in  the  identification  of  affected  persons  with \ntraditional  rights  and  will  provide  support  to  community  consultation  and  to  the  solution  of \ngrievances.  \n \nGrievance  procedures:  Grievances  will  be  first  handled  at  the  village  level  with \n6. \ninvolvement of the local government. If no solution is reached, the persons affected will raise the \ncomplaint  to  the  PIU.  If  no  settlement  is  reached,  the  case  can  be  brought  directly  to  MPW.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n45\n\nIf  the  grievance  remains  unsettled  the  persons  affected  will  be  able  to  seek  redress  at  the \ncommunal court.  \n \n7. \nMonitoring  and  Evaluation:  The PIU will carry out the internal monitoring of LAR and \nwill report to ADB through the quarterly project implementation reports. External monitoring will \nbe carried out by an independent agency and will involve the preparation of a compliance report \nat the end of the implementation of the LARP as a condition to start civil works.  \n \n8. \nto $4,750.  \n \nB. \n\nCompensation Costs: The cost of the compensation program under the LARP amounts \n\nIndigenous Peoples Issues \n\n9. \nNo  communities  inhabited  by  persons  fitting  with  the  definition  of  indigenous  people  of \nthe  relevant  ADB  Policy  are  affected  by  the  Project.  The  Project  is  classified  as  C  in  terms  of \nimpacts on indigenous peoples and no specific action is required in this regard. \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 14 September 2009) \n \n\u2013 \n", "Currency Unit\n", "afghani (AF) \n", "AF1.00\n$1.00\n", "= \n= \n", "$0.02 \nAF50.00 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "Asian Development Bank \nAfghanistan Railway Authority \nCentral Asia Regional Economic Cooperation \nexecuting agency \neconomic internal rate of return \nenvironmental management plan \nengineering, procurement, and construction \nfinancial internal rate of return \ninitial environmental examination \nInternational Security Assistance Force \nland acquisition and resettlement plan \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Ministry of Commerce and Industry \n\u2013  Ministry of Finance \n\u2013  Ministry of Interior \n\u2013  Ministry of Public Works \nnet present value \n\u2013 \noperation and maintenance \n\u2013 \nproject implementation unit \n\u2013 \nUzbekistan Temir Yullari \n\u2013 \nweighted average cost of capital \n\u2013 \nweakly performing country \n\u2013 \n", " \n \nNOTES \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", "ADB \nARA \nCAREC \nEA \nEIRR \nEMP \nEPC \nFIRR \nIEE \nISAF \nLARP \nMOCI \nMOF \nMOI \nMPW \nNPV \nO&M \nPIU \nUTY \nWACC \nWPC \n", "(i) \n", " \n(ii) \n", "The  Afghan  fiscal  year  (FY)  coincides  with  the  Afghan  solar  year  (SY).  \nThe  current  FY,  SY1388,  runs  from  21  March  2009  until  20  March  2010.
