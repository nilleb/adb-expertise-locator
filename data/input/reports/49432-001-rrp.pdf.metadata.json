In  2015,  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  was  6.9%,  and  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  estimates that  GDP  growth  will  be  6.7%  in  2016.2 Strong  economic \ngrowth in the PRC lifted more than 600 million people out of poverty over two decades. Poverty \nhad  been  largely  eradicated  in  urban  areas  by  2008,  and  is  now  predominantly  a  rural \nphenomenon.  Approximately  13.0%  of  the  rural  population  in  the  PRC  was  living  below  the \ninternational  poverty  line  in  2012,  while  only  0.4%  of  the  urban  population  was  classified  as \npoor.  There  are  still  592  poverty-stricken  counties  designated  by  the  central  government, \ncovering large rural areas in the central and western regions of the PRC. \n \nIn the PRC, rural credit cooperatives (RCCs), with an estimated 70 million individual or \n3. \nhousehold  borrowers,  are  the  largest  providers  of  small-scale  rural  credit  and  currently  hold \nabout  6%  of  the  total  banking  industry  assets.  About  70%  of  loans  made  by  RCCs  are \nmicroloans  averaging  less  than  CNY50,000  ($7,692).  The  Postal  Savings  Bank  of  China \n(PSBC) is mandated by the government to develop commercially viable loan products for rural \nenterprises, migrant workers, and farmers. The PSBC has a network  of around 40,000 outlets \nand  had  provided  microloans  amounting  to  CNY970  billion  by  the  end  of  2014.  The  average \nPSBC  microloan  size  is  about  CNY60,000  ($9,231).  While  rural  commercial  or  cooperative \nbanks  also  focus  on  serving  micro-  and  small  enterprises,  their  average  loan  size  of  CNY1.2 \nmillion  ($184,615)  is  out  of reach for  individual  borrowers. There  has  been  a  large  increase  in \nthe number of village and township banks since 2006, although their average loan size of more \nthan CNY275,000 ($42,308) places them outside the reach of low-income households. In 2005, \nthe  People\u2019s  Bank  of  China  designed  and  tested  microcredit  companies to further  support  the \ndevelopment  of  inclusive  finance.  The  number  of  microcredit  companies  has  grown  rapidly, \nreaching 7,839 by the end of 2013 with outstanding loans of CNY819 billion. However, with an \nestimated average loan size of CNY400,000\u2013CNY600,000 ($61,538\u2013$92,308), most microcredit \ncompanies provide very little real microcredit.  \n \n4. \nDespite the rapid growth of the PRC\u2019s finance sector over the past few decades, existing \nfinancial  institutions,  including  banks  and  microcredit  companies,  are  unable to meet the huge \nmarket  demand  for  microcredit.  According  to  a  survey  carried  out  by  the  Southwestern \nUniversity of Finance and Economics in Chengdu in 2012, informal borrowings by households, \nwhich incur much higher interest rates, amounted to CNY8.6 trillion, of which 35% were used for \nagriculture  and business.  An  analysis  of  county-level  lending  and deposit-taking  data  between \n2006  and  2012  suggests  that  45%  of  the  rural  population  is  underserved  with  credit,  and  that \n20%  of  higher-income  rural  households  absorb  more  than  54%  of  formal  borrowings.  Overall, \n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. In the PRC, county refers to a local administrative division \ncovering  part  of  the  rural areas  of  a prefecture-level  city.  Poverty-stricken  counties  are  determined  based  on  the \nnumber of people in extreme poverty, the number of low-income people, the per capita income of rural residents, \nper capita GDP, and per capita fiscal revenue of the local government.  \n\n2   ADB. 2015. Asian Development Outlook 2015 Supplement: Growth Holds Its Own in Developing Asia. Manila. \n\n\f2 \n\nthere is an unmet demand of CNY1.3 trillion\u2013CNY2.3 trillion for formal credit from 10 million\u201317 \nmillion  households  and  microenterprises.  This  is  in  addition  to  the  41  million\u201348  million  rural \nhouseholds  that  would  still  need  to  access  informal  credit  with  an  average  loan  size  of \nCNY36,000 ($5,538). While 78.9% of the population in the PRC had access to bank accounts in \n2015, the ratio was lower for the rural population (74.3%) and women (74.3%).3 Women in rural \nareas perform most  of the  agriculture work,  and  they  are often marginalized  because of  lower \neducation and the lack of access to skills and information. Laws on land management and rural \nland contracting have been put in place to promote gender equality in land rights, but women\u2019s \nrights to land remain limited.4 A 2011 survey showed that only 17.1% of existing contracts and \n38.2% of existing certificates include women\u2019s names.5 \n \n5. \nThe  CFPA  Microfinance  Management  (CFPAMM)  was  identified  by  ADB  as  a  strong \npartner to provide microcredit to rural households and individuals in poverty-stricken counties in \nthe  PRC.  The  company  has  a  long  and  successful  track  record  in  providing  collateral-free \nmicroloans to rural women and microentrepreneurs. It has strong shareholders, good corporate \ngovernance,  an  experienced  management  team,  advanced  risk  management  systems,  and \nsatisfactory financial performance. It has experienced rapid growth since 2012 and has plans for \nsignificant further expansion. The long-term ADB finance will provide the much-needed funding \nto support its growth, which in turn will improve access to finance of the underserved segment in \nthe  PRC,  particularly  women  in rural  areas.  The  proposed  project  is  ADB\u2019s  first  private  sector \nloan in microfinance in the PRC. \n \nB. \n \nThe  CFPAMM  was  established  in  2008  to  manage  the  microfinance  activities  of  the \n6. \nChina Foundation for Poverty Alleviation (CFPA) under a joint program of the World Bank and \nthe Government of the PRC that had been in operation since 1996. The CFPAMM is currently \none of the largest microfinance institutions in the PRC in terms of branch network, loan portfolio, \nand  number  of  active  borrowers.  From  its  establishment  to  31  December  2015,  it  disbursed \nmore  than  1.26  million  loans  totaling  CNY12.6  billion.  [The  rest  of  this  paragraph  has  been \nredacted due to commercially sensitive information.] \n \nThe CFPAMM is a commercial microfinance institution dedicated to promoting financial \n7. \ninclusion in the PRC. Its business model is aligned with a social enterprise, focusing on offering \nmicroloans  to  borrowers  in  a  wide  geographic  segment  of  poverty-stricken  counties  and  in \nregions in the PRC that are underdeveloped or affected by natural disaster. It primarily targets \nunderserved  rural  women  clients,  most  of  whom  are  excluded  from  access  to  formal  financial \nservices.  Most  microloans  are  for  agricultural  and  farming  purposes,  while  the  rest  are  for \nindividual  microbusinesses  in  trade,  handicraft  manufacturing,  and  services.6 [The  rest  of  this \nparagraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information.]   \n\nBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\n \n8. \nIn 2014, the average loan size offered by  the CFPAMM  was CNY11,332 ($1,743), and \n69%  of  loans  were  for  less  than  CNY10,000  ($1,538).  About  63%  of  loans  were  used  for \nagricultural  and  farming  purposes.  The  vast  majority  of  its  clients  are  rural  households  (97%) \nwith  women  as  direct  borrowers  (94%).  In  this  segment,  the  CFPAMM  faces  only  limited \n\n                                                \n3   World Bank. 2015. The Little Data Book on Financial Inclusion 2015.

Its  main  competitive  advantage  is  its  superior  service \nquality. With more than 1,500 loan officers, all locally recruited, the company provides the \u201clast \nmile\u201d of financial services to remote areas. The loan application, contract signing, disbursement, \nand  collection  all  transpire  at  the  place  of  the  borrowers.  The  company  has  a  very  quick \ndecision-making process and 86% of the clients receive their loans within 7 days of application. \nBased  on  the  company\u2019s  2014  client  satisfaction  survey,  96%  of  the  borrowers  were  satisfied \nwith the efficiency of its services.  \n \n9. \n \nC. \n \nOwnership. The CFPAMM is majority owned by the CFPA (62.7%), a PRC-based NGO \n10. \nwith  a  close  relationship  with  the  government.  The  CFPA  was  established  in  1989  by  various \nretired  senior  government  officials,  and  is  currently  the  largest  NGO  working  in  the  field  of \npoverty  reduction  in  the  PRC.  It  is  supervised  by  the  State  Council  Leading  Group  Office  of \nPoverty Alleviation and Development. Currently, 13 out of 15 members of the governing council, \nincluding  the  chair  and  executive  vice-chair,  are  volunteers.  None  of  the  previous  or  current \ngoverning council members have beneficial ownership interest in the foundation. The other two \nshareholders are the International Finance Corporation (IFC), holding 19.2%; and a corporation \nfrom  Hong  Kong,  China  fully  owned  by  Sequoia  Capital  China  Fund,  a  PRC-focused  private \nequity  fund  registered  in  Cayman  Islands  and  managed  by  Neil  Nanpeng  Shen,  managing \npartner of Sequoia Capital China (holding 18.1%). \n \n11.  Management.  CFPAMM\u2019s  senior  management  team  is  composed  of  the  general \nmanager,  four  deputy  general  managers  (chief  operations  officer,  chief  financial  officer,  chief \nbranding  officer,  and  chief  risk  management  officer),  and  an  assistant  general  manager  (the \ninformation  technology  [IT]  manager).

The proposed loan will be governed by a loan facility agreement, \n\n \nA. \n \nADB will provide a senior secured term loan to the CFPAMM of up to $50 million (or its \n18. \nyuan equivalent) with up to a 5-year tenor. The proposed loan will fund CFPAMM\u2019s microfinance \noperations in counties designated by central and local governments as poverty-stricken areas. \nThe subloans will be primarily used for agricultural and farming purposes, and may also be used \nto  support  individual  microbusinesses  in  trade,  manufacturing,  and  services  as  well  as  other \nrural  economic  activities.  The  proposed  loan  will  benefit  women,  as  the  CFPAMM  specifically \ntargets  women  in  rural  areas  as  its  core  customers  and  women  currently  represent  94%  of \nCFPAMM\u2019s  borrowers.  It  will  promote  gender  equity  by  improving  rural  women\u2019s  access  to \nfinance through 121,000 collateral-free microloans to women borrowers.  \n \nB. \n \n19. \nwhich will contain terms customary for a loan of this nature and amount.  \n \n20.  Monitoring.  Monitoring  of  the  project  will  be  undertaken  by  ADB.  The  CFPAMM  will \nprovide  ADB  with  financial  and  other  reports  at  predetermined  regular  intervals  and  as \nrequested. These reports will include (i)  semiannual unaudited financial statements; (ii) annual \naudited  financial  statements;  (iii)  annual  compliance  certificates  for  financial  covenants;  (iv) \nannual  reports  on  the  subloan  portfolio;  and  (v)  annual  reporting  to  include  selected \ndevelopment  indicators  agreed  on  by  ADB  and the  borrower,  and  confirmation  on  compliance \nwith national laws and regulations, ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), Social Protection \nStrategy, and gender action plan implementation.7 \n \nEvaluation.  Pursuant  to  ADB  Operations  Manual,  monitoring  reports  will  be  prepared \n21. \nand submitted to ADB regularly and at least annually.8 The first such report will be submitted no \nlater than 12 months after the first disbursement. \n \nC. \n \n22. \n\nADB\u2019s loan to the CFPAMM will add value by helping to achieve the following: \n(i) \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\nProvide long-term finance to CFPAMM. As a nonbank financial institution, the \nCFPAMM  does  not  have  access  to  deposits  and  relies  entirely  on  wholesale \nfunding  to  support  its  operations.  [The  sentence  has  been  redacted  due  to \ncommercially  sensitive  information.]    It  will  reduce  CFPAMM\u2019s  funding  risk  and \nenable  the  company  to  develop  a  long-term  business  plan  with  more  funding \nthe  company\u2019s \ncertainty.  ADB\u2019s \nmicrofinance products and, as a result, the ADB loan can be rolled over several \ntimes, thereby maximizing development impact.  \nSupport  finance  sector  development.  Microfinance  in  the  PRC  is  still  in  the \nearly stage of development, and there is vast unmet demand for microcredit from \nthe  rural  population.  The  proposed  loan  will  support  the  development  of  one  of \nthe  few  microfinance  institutions  that  focuses  on  providing  real  microcredit  in \nrural areas, thus contributing to the development of this underdeveloped sector.  \n\ntenor  compared \n\nloan  has  a \n\nlonger \n\nto \n\n(ii) \n\n                                                \n7   ADB. 2003.

The  project  has  gender-specific  loan targets \nand is expected to directly benefit at least 121,000 women borrowers. A gender \naction plan has been prepared to support the gender equity theme classification \nof  the  project.  This  includes  gender  measures  to  improve  women\u2019s  financial \nplanning and literacy, other skills, and awareness of consumer protection issues.  \n \n\nKey  risks  include  the  following:  [The  rest  of  this  paragraph  has  been  redacted  due  to \n\nRisks \n\nD. \n \n23. \ncommercially sensitive information.] \n\n \n\n24. \n \n\n \nA. \n\n[This paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information.] \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Output \n \n25. \nImpact.  The  project\u2019s  impact  will  be  enhanced  financial  inclusion  of  rural  households \nand improved access to finance for microentrepreneurs in poverty-stricken and underdeveloped \nregions,  thus  contributing  to  economic  development  and  poverty  reduction.  ADB\u2019s  funding  will \nenable  the  CFPAMM  to  scale  up  its  business,  reach  significantly  underserved  customer \nsegments, and provide urgently needed microcredit to rural households for improving livelihood \nand poverty alleviation. \n \nOutcome. The project\u2019s outcome will be sustainable growth of CFPAMM\u2019s microfinance \n26. \noperations in poverty-stricken counties designated by central and local governments, as well as \ncounties in regions that are underdeveloped or affected by natural disaster. This will help boost \nincome opportunities and reduce poverty in the target regions.   \n \n27. \nOutput.  The  output  will  be  the  expansion  of  CFPAMM\u2019s  microfinance  lending  to  rural \nhouseholds and microentrepreneurs in poverty-stricken counties. Based on the historical profile \nof  CFPAMM\u2019s  microloans,  the  proposed  ADB  loan  is  expected  to  benefit  about  129,000 \nmicroloan  borrowers,  of  which  125,000  are  expected  to  be  rural  households,  121,000  will  be \nwomen borrowers,  and 104,000  will  be  borrowers  with no  access to financial  institutions  other \nthan the CFPAMM. \n \nB. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n28. \nConsistency  with  ADB  strategy  and  country  strategy.  The  project  supports  two \npriorities identified by the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: (i) poverty reduction and inclusive \neconomic  growth,  and  (ii)  private  sector  development  and  operations. 9 The  midterm  review \nhighlights  ADB\u2019s focus  on reducing  vulnerability  and inequality  and  promoting inclusive growth \nin middle-income countries. It is consistent with the country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 for \nthe PRC10 and the country operations business plan, 2015\u20132017 for the PRC, which prioritizes \npromoting  balanced  development  of  rural  and  urban  areas,  supporting  catalytic  nonsovereign \n\n                                                \n9   ADB. 2014.

The proposed \nproject  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Financial  Sector  Operational  Plan,  which  notes  that  ADB  will \nsupport  broad-based  household  access  to  microfinance. 13 ADB\u2019s  Microfinance  Development \nStrategy  calls  for  tapping  the  increasing  potential  of  the  poor  by  expanding  access  to \nmicrofinance.14 ADB\u2019s  enhanced  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  also  states  that  ADB  seeks  to \npromote  sound  and  efficient  financial  markets  to  improve  access  to  finance  and  achieve  pro-\npoor  growth. 15  The  proposed  project  is  also  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  earlier  support  in  the \nmicrofinance sector.16 \n \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  proposed  loan  is  classified  category  FI  (treated  as  C)  for  environment,  involuntary \n30. \nresettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples  impacts  following  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \n(2009). The loan will fund CFPAMM\u2019s microfinance operations in counties designated by central \nand local governments as poverty-stricken areas. In particular, the subloans will be provided to \nwomen,  under  a  joint  liability  model,  with  a  maximum  limit  currently  set  at  CNY16,000  per \nborrower.  The  majority  of  the  subloans  will  be  provided  to  rural  households  for  agribusiness \n(e.g.,  livestock,  fish,  and  crop  farming)  and  microentrepreneurial  purposes  related  to  trade, \nhandicraft  manufacturing,  and  services. 17  The  subloans  under  the  proposed  ADB  loan  are \nexpected  to  have  minimal  environmental  and  social  impacts.  No  land  acquisition,  physical  or \neconomic displacements, or impact on  indigenous peoples communities is foreseen in relation \nto  any  activities  of  the  subborrowers.  The  CFPAMM  will  apply  the  Prohibited  Investment \nActivities  List  in  Annex  5  of  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  comply  with  the  relevant \nnational laws, standards, and regulations. The project will exclude all individual subloans (which \ncurrently have a maximum limit of CNY50,000) and all subloans that are classified category A or \nB for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. The CFPAMM will monitor \nand  provide  information  on  its  compliance  with  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  with \nrelevant national laws, standards, and guidelines in its annual report. \n \n31. \nADB\u2019s loan is categorized as having a gender equity theme as it will support CFPAMM\u2019s \ngroup lending portfolio, which primarily provides microloans to groups of women in rural areas. It \nis  expected  that  under  ADB\u2019s  loan  facility,  the  CFPAMM  will  provide  microloans  to  129,000 \nclients  of  which  94%  will  be  women.  Measures  to  further  empower  and  benefit  women \nborrowers and staff have been identified and will be incorporated in the project design, including \n\n                                                \n11  ADB. 2015.

With the small available loan size, the \namount of pesticides that will be acquired is relatively low. In addition, to ensure that women farmers have minimal \nexposure to pesticides, under the gender action plan the project will include training on proper pesticides handling, \nstorage, and disposal that is aligned with integrated pest management approaches. \n\n\f7 \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n(i)  induction trainings for  all  women borrowers;  (ii) formal  and informal  trainings  (e.g., financial \nliteracy,  farming  techniques,  integrated  pest  management  approaches, 18 and  handicrafts)  to \nenhance  skills  and  capacity  of  women  borrowers;  (iii)  development  of  networks  of  women \nentrepreneurs  to  facilitate  knowledge  exchange;  and  (iv)  annual  trainings  for  CFPAMM  loan \nofficers  and  other  staff  to  better  understand  the  special  needs  of  women  borrowers.  The \nCFPAMM  will  also  enhance  its  data  collection  to  track  and  monitor  information  on  women \nborrowers as well as refine its client satisfaction survey to increase focus on  the experience of \nwomen borrowers. The CFPAMM will comply with national labor laws and will take measures to \ncomply  with  internationally  recognized  core  labor  standards  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Social \nProtection strategy (footnote 14).  \n \nB. \n \n32. \nThe  CFPAMM  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  of  implementing  best  international  practice \nrelating  to  combating  corruption,  money  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism.
