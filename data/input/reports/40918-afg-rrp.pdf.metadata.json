Today, being cut \noff  from  basic  telecommunications  services  is  a  hardship  almost  as  acute  as  these  other \ndeprivations, and may indeed reduce the chances of finding remedies to them.\" - UN Secretary \nGeneral Kofi Annan1 \n \n2. \nRoshan is the largest provider of mobile telecommunications services in Afghanistan. In \nNovember  2004,  ADB  approved  a  loan  of  $35  million  to  finance  the  expansion  of  Roshan\u2019s \nmobile cellular telephony network and the restructuring of its capital base. Since inception of its \nservices,  Roshan  has significantly  exceeded  its  subscriber  and  traffic growth  targets.  To  meet \nthe  tremendous  demand,  ensure  quality  service,  and  reap  the  competitive  benefits  from  this \ngrowth,  Roshan\u2019s  capital  expenditure  program  has  had  to  be  accelerated.2 Therefore,  ADB\u2019s \nloan was rapidly fully drawn. \n \n3. \nTo  finance  the  next  (second)  phase  of  the  accelerated  rollout  plan,  Roshan  requested \nadditional debt funding from ADB and other current and prospective senior lenders in December \n2005.  The  concept  of  this  Project  was  cleared  on  23  February  2006,  and  due  diligence  was \ncarried  out  in  Kabul,  Afghanistan,  from  5  to  8  March,  2006.  Additional  meetings  were  held  in \nParis and London to coordinate the financing approach. \n \n4. \nThe Project involves the phase-II expansion of Roshan\u2019s cellular network to provide for \naccelerated near-countrywide coverage, additional network redundancy, and a network upgrade. \n \n5. \nIn early 2004, ADB approved a similar loan to GrameenPhone in Bangladesh to finance \nits phase-II expansion.3 The identified development impact included (i) continued expansion of \nthe  telecommunications  sector,  which  still  had  large  unmet  demand  and  unserved  regions;  (ii) \nexpanded  role  of  small  and  medium-sized  service  providers,  which  are  subcontractors  of \nGrameenPhone;  (iii)  expansion  of  village  pay  telephones  (VPTs)  to  unserved  rural  areas;  and \n(iv) support for GrameenPhone\u2019s unique contributions for good governance in the Bangladesh \ntelecommunications sector. The phase-II expansion financing for Roshan has a similar profile (a \nsecond loan following a rapid and successful phase-I rollout by a successful market leader in a \nnascent  telecommunications  market  with  significant  demand\u2013supply  gap)  and  rationale,  and \narguably even more compelling development characteristics. \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1   The US National Commission on Libraries and Information Science speech at Telecom 99 in Geneva, Switzerland. \n2   If the acceleration of the phase-II expansion were not to take place, the higher-than-expected traffic and number of \nsubscribers  would  lead  to  capacity  and  quality  concerns.  Roshan  would  have  to  halt  its  expansion  programs  to \nfocus on capacity and quality upgrades. This would be to the detriment of all stakeholders and beneficiaries. \n\n3  ADB.  2003.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n  \n\nIII. \n\nBACKGROUND AND RATIONALE, SECTOR PERFORMANCE,  \nPROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nTelecommunications Sector in Afghanistan \n\n6. \nAfghanistan  continues  to  suffer  from  a  critical  lack  of  communications  infrastructure. \nTravel  is  impeded  by  poor  (albeit  slowly  improving)  road  conditions,  long  distances,  and  low \nvehicle ownership rates. The postal system is still slow and basic. In a recent investment climate \nsurvey,4 26%  of  the  surveyed  firms  still  mentioned  telecommunications  as  a  major  or  severe \nproblem.  The  fixed-line  telephone  system  remains  rudimentary  and  thus  communication  by \nfixed-line  fax  is  also  largely  unavailable.  Almost  everybody,  including  the  foreign  security  and \nfunding agencies and the Government, depend on the cellular network for even their most basic \noperations. \n \n7. \nCellular  telephony  is  seen  not  only  as  the  only  viable  method  of  providing  reliable, \ncountrywide communications coverage in Afghanistan, but also as the most attractive, because \nof  the  lower  roll-out  complexity  compared  with  fixed-line  telephony.5 Studies  of  the  economic \nbenefits  of  telecommunications,  specifically  rural  telecommunications,  show  that  benefits  are \nbroader and benefit\u2013cost ratios are higher than indicated by the usual project economic analysis.6 \nThis is particularly true in Afghanistan, where telecommunications have become a vital part of the \nredevelopment  process  in  the  economy,  health  care,  and  security.  The  large  external  refugee \ncommunity and importance of remittances into Afghanistan from this community adds a further \ndimension  to  the  importance  of  telecommunications  for  development.  Appendix  2  gives  an \noverview of the telecommunications sector in Afghanistan. \n \nB. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n8. \nWhile coverage has grown impressively in the last 2 or 3 years in response to exploding \ndemand, it is still far from nationwide, and requires significant additional investment, particularly \nto  reach  the  more  dispersed  and  underserved  segments  of  society.  Current  (mobile)  tele-\ndensity7 is estimated at around 46 (or 4.6%). This can be compared with the 2003 (latest) data \nfor  other  comparable  countries:  Sudan  at  4.7%,  Somalia  at  4.8%,  Zimbabwe  at  5.8%,  and \nLesotho at 6.3%. Among all countries surveyed by the International Telecommunications Union \n(ITU),  only  Ethiopia,  Myanmar,  Guinea-Bissau  and  Eritrea  had  lower  tele-densities  than \nAfghanistan (and in 2004 when ADB commenced funding for Afghanistan, the country had one \nof the lowest teledensities in the world).8 \n \n\n                                                 \n4   World Bank. 2005. The Investment Climate in Afghanistan \u2013 Exploiting Opportunities in an Uncertain Environment \n\n5   Including  the  lower  risk  of  triggering  land  mines.  Morajee,  R.  2005.  Afghan  Telecoms  Stay  Above  Ground. \n\n(draft). Washington, DC. \n\nFinancial Times. {City.} \n\n6  ADB.  1997.  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Telecommunications  Projects.  Manila;  and  ADB.  1996. \nSocioeconomic Impact Study of Rural Telecommunications in Thailand. Manila (TA 2381-THA). The studies conclude \nthat the economic benefits of telecommunications are at least twice what subscribers pay for the service, and much \nhigher  for  some  user  groups.  Additional  benefits  are  derived  in  education,  employment,  agriculture,  environment, \nhealth, and safety. \n\n7   Telephones per 1,000 people. \n8   UNDP. 2005. Millennium Indicator: 'Telephone lines and cellular  subscribers per 100 population (ITU estimates)'. \nHighly  developed  countries  such  as  Luxemburg,  Sweden,  or  Switzerland  have  tele-densities  of  170\u2013200%.  The \nPhilippines had a tele-density of 31% in 2003. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nC. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nLarge Investment Needs \n\n 3\n\n  \n\nLinked  to  GDP,  tele-density  forecasts9 place  achievable  targets  for  Afghanistan  at  120 \n9. \nby 2015 (a level comparable to that of Mongolia or Gabon in 2000). Most of this growth will be \naccounted  for  by  cellular  telephony  and  will  be  led  by  the  private  sector.  The  estimated \nnecessary  network  build-out  investment  (by  Roshan  and  its  competitors)  is  approximately  $1 \nbillion.10 On average, Afghanistan will need some $76 million of investments per year to reach \nthe forecasted levels.  \n \n10. \nThe  cellular  market  is  served  by  two  private  cellular  network  operators,  Roshan  and \nAfghan  Wireless  Communications  Company  (AWCC), 11 and  the  state-run  fixed-line  operator \nAfghan Telecom (AT). Thanks to competition and the possibility for operators to take advantage \nof  economies  of  scale,  affordability  has  improved  significantly,  and  the  introduction  of  prepaid \nsubscriptions  means  low  barriers  to  adoption  for  a  broad  spectrum  of  users.  A  further  cellular \nlicense  was  awarded  in  late  2005  to  a  third  entrant,  the  Investcom  Consortium  (Investcom), \nwhich is expected to commence operations in the second half of 2006. With the addition of the \nnew operator, Afghanistan\u2019s six major cities and their surrounding areas will benefit from further \ncompetition, as Investcom is bound by a license requirement to build out these areas within 6 \nmonths of commercial launch. A fourth license12 will be acquired by Etisalat of the United Arab \nEmirates (UAE). \n \n\n2. \n\nNascent Regulatory Environment \n\n11. \nThe Ministry of Communications (MOC) is responsible for formulating sector policy. The \ntelecommunications  regulatory  environment  is  undergoing  extensive  reform,  as  state-owned \noperating companies are being prepared for eventual privatization, and the regulatory functions \nare being disengaged from the operating units within MOC. The World Bank has had a central \nrole  in  helping  establish  a  telecommunications  law  and  telecommunications  regulatory \nenvironment and has contracted long-term consultants to work with MOC and with the nascent \nregulatory  authority.  A  telecommunications  law 13  (the  Telecom  Law)  was  promulgated  in \nDecember  2005,  and  a  regulatory  board,  the  Afghanistan  Telecommunications  Regulatory \nAuthority  (ATRA)  has  been  set  up  under  the  auspices  of  MOC  (it  will  ultimately  be  an \nindependent  agency,  funded  by  levies  on  the  operators).  ATRA  has  been  formed  out  of  the \ninterim Telecommunications Regulatory Board of Afghanistan, set up set up in 2003 as a direct \nresponse to the need for regulation thanks to the introduction of competition through the entry of \nRoshan as second operator. A regulatory sub-body, the Radio Inspection Department, has been \nestablished  (under  MOC)  for  mobile  spectrum  management  and  monitoring  of  frequency \ninterference in accordance with the standards and recommendations of the ITU.  \n \n \n\n                                                 \n9   Fay,  M.  and  T.

It \nis likely that the Government will re-tender the license (a possibility which is factored into Roshan\u2019s business plan). \n\n13  Law for Regulation of Telecommunication Services, 18 December 2005. \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n  \n\nD. \n\nADB\u2019s Operations in the Country and Sector \n\n1. \n\nIn Afghanistan \n\n \nSince the resumption of its activities in Afghanistan in 2002, ADB had through to the end \n12. \nof  2005  approved  nearly  $1  billion  in  loans,  grants,  technical  assistance,  and  private  sector \ninvestments to support Afghanistan's development and is administering a further $82.6 million in \nfunding agency-financed or cost-shared activities, including assistance through the Japan Fund \nfor Poverty Reduction. \n \n13. \nADB  funds  have  helped  rebuild  important  road  and  power  infrastructure  and  irrigation \nsystems in northern Afghanistan, and have promoted agricultural growth and poverty reduction \nby  developing  a  sound  policy  framework  and  efficient  sector  institutions.  ADB  has  pledged  to \nconsider assistance of about $1 billion in loans and grants over the coming five years, subject to \nthe  outcome  of  ongoing  negotiations.  This  assistance  would  include  loan  and  equity \ninvestments of up to $100 million in partnership with local and foreign investors, and guarantees \nof about $100 million to catalyze private investments. Appendix 3 presents a summary of ADB\u2019s \nassistance for Afghanistan. \n \n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy \n\n2. \n \n14. \nADB\u2019s role in the information and communication sector, while more modest than that of \nother  multilateral  and  bilateral  institutions,  includes  (i)  supporting  the  private  sector,  which  is \nexpected  to  lead  in  developing  information  technology  (IT)  networks;  (ii)  encouraging \ngovernments  to  create  a  predictable,  transparent,  and  nondiscriminatory  policy  and  regulatory \nenvironment;  and  (iii)  ensuring  that  IT-related  rules  and  practices  are  responsive  to  the \nemerging revolutionary changes in the way people conduct business using IT.14 To date, ADB \nhas made private sector loans to telecommunications companies in the Philippines, Bangladesh, \nand Afghanistan. Appendix 4 gives  an overview of ADB assistance to the telecommunications \nsector. \n \nE. \n\nCorporate Overview of Roshan \n\n15. \nRoshan\u2019s commercial expansion has been remarkable. Over its short operating history, \nRoshan  has  overtaken  the  first  entrant,  capitalizing  on  several  key  comparative  advantages, \nincluding  superior  technology,  greater  national  coverage,  a  strong  dealer  network,  innovative \nmarketing,  and  a  general  reputation  for  quality  of  service  and  in  being  first  mover  in  new \nbusiness and services.

AKFED  also  participates  in  a  GSM  mobile  communications  venture  in  neighboring \nTajikistan.  In  addition,  Monaco  Telecom  International  (MTI),  indirectly  controlled  by  Cable  & \nWireless,  holds  36.75%,  and  MCT  Corporation  (MCT),  a  US-based  provider  of  mobile \ntelecommunications to Central Asia and Russia, owns the remaining 12.25%. See Appendix 5 \nfor more details on the shareholders. \n \n17. \nThe  core  management  team  has  been  in  place  since  operations  started.  ADB  has \nworked closely with Roshan\u2019s board of directors and management over the last two years. See \nAppendix 6 for brief biographies of Roshan\u2019s directors and management team. \n \n\n2. \n\nCompetitive Environment \n\nAfghanistan  has  three  mobile  telephone  service  providers:  Roshan,  AT,  and  AWCC. \n\n18. \nRecently, a fourth entrant, Investcom, was awarded an additional license.  \n \n19. \nAWCC  is  80%  owned  by  Telysint,  a  private  Afghan  company,  and  20%  by  the \nGovernment of Afghanistan (the Government). AWCC was granted the first operating license in \n1999.  This  subsequently  fell  into  abeyance  and  was  then  effectively  renewed  in  2001.  AWCC \nresumed commercial operations in April 2002.

It has recently \n21. \nbeen corporatized. It has also been rumored that Etisalat may be awarded the fourth license to \nbe issued. AT operates a code division multiple access (CDMA) network, covering 21 provinces. \nAppendix 7 gives further details on the competitors. \n \n\n3. \n\nSocial Impact and Program \n\n22. \nSince its commercial launch in July 2003, Roshan has built a national mobile telephony \nnetwork  which  is  used  daily  by  about  800,000  Afghans  across  150  towns  throughout \nAfghanistan. Roshan indirectly employs over 15,000 Afghans through its network of contractors, \ndistributors, and resellers and support businesses.  \n \nIn  addition  to  Roshan's  core  commercial  operations,  which  bring  significant  inherent \n23. \nsocial  benefits,  Roshan  enjoys  a  good  market  reputation  and  brand  recognition  thanks  to  its \nsocial development efforts. It has a number of programs to benefit not only its employees, but \nthe  community  as  a  whole.  In  2006,  the  Roshan  board  approved  the  formal  creation  of  the \nSocial Program. The key social programs/impacts include the following: \n \n\n(i) \n\nMobile  credit  and/or  electronic  cash  transfers.  More  people  in  Afghanistan \nhave mobile phones than bank accounts. The creation of a mobile credit transfer \nsystem whereby individuals can transfer value across Afghanistan to each other \nand/or to banks or money dealers licensed by the Afghanistan Central Bank (Da \nAfghanistan Bank [DAB]) could fundamentally impact how Afghans transact and \nsave and transfer money. Such a system, as well as enabling economic activity, \nwould serve the policy goals of the Government and DAB by establishing greater \nvisibility over domestic as well as international remittance currency flows. Roshan \nexpects to try out a mobile credit transfer initiative in Q4 2006.15  \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\nPublic  call  office  (PCO)  program.  A  program  similar  to  GrameenPhone\u2019s \nVillage  Phone  project, 16  whereby  people  without  access  to  phones  can  still \naccess  mobile  phone  services.  Roshan  has  some  360  active  PCOs17 operated \nby individual entrepreneurs around the country. Roshan is looking to expand this \nmodel,  e.g.,  by  working  with  women\u2019s  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  to \nroll  out  in  the  south,  and  by  employing  extended  range  antennas,  which  will \nenable  expansion  into  previously  uncovered  rural  areas  in  2006.  Through  a \npartnership  with  First  Microfinance  Bank,  entrepreneurs  can  borrow  for  the \ncapital expenditure in acquiring a PCO unit.  \n\n \n(iii) \n\nRural  telephony.  The  Roshan  network  covers  about  35%  of  the  population. \nExtending Roshan\u2019s coverage to less developed (and predominantly rural) areas \nis a priority of the Social Program. \n\n \n(iv)  Medical  and  health  program.  Roshan  has  started  a  state-of-the-art \nmedical/dental clinic in an unused leased building ( its former head office), which, \n\n                                                 \n15 While  Roshan  considers  the  implementation  of  a  mobile  credit  system  a  high  and  urgent  priority,  issues  such  as \ntechnology integration, testing, and obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals from DAB and ATRA may take time. \n16  See  Appendix  8  for  a  description  of  the  Village  Phone  project.  It  was  awarded  the  Development  Gateway \nFoundation\u2019s  first  Petersberg  prize  for  \u201coutstanding  achievement  in  the  use  of  information  and  communication \ntechnologies to improve people\u2019s lives\u201d. \n\n17 Not all PCOs issued are active: 130 of the active PCOs are run by former combatants through the United Nation\u2019s \n\nDemilitarization, Demobilization and Reintegration program. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 7\n\n  \n\nin addition to providing staff with access to checkups and medical/dental services, \nalso  conducts  training  for  all  staff  in  first  aid  and  dental  hygiene,  as  well  as \ntrauma  response  (for  selected  personnel).  The  clinic  covers  operating  costs  by \nproviding  health  services  also  to  other  organizations  such  as  embassies  and \nNGOs. Staff members pay a fee for the services but receive a monthly medical \nstipend  ($15)  to  cover  expenses.  Part  of  the  health  professionals\u2019  time  is  also \nallocated to outreach activities, e.g., working with local and rural orphanages on \nhealth  education  and  prophylaxis.  Roshan  also  sponsors,  together  with  the \nMinistry  of  Public  Health,  training  for  laboratory  technicians  at  the  Aga  Khan \nUniversity in Pakistan. \n\n(v) \n\nSocial  welfare.  Aimed  at the 50% of the population which is below 15 years of \nage,  Roshan  has  a  number  of  purely  social  initiatives  across  the  country, \nincluding the following: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n(c) \n\n(d) \n\nSupport  for  Aschiana  Orphanage.  The  orphanage  provides  some  600 \nstreet  children  in  Kabul  with  shelter,  food,  and  half-day  education  (the \nother half of the day the children can retain income-generating activities). \nRoshan supports the activities through sponsorship (e.g., a soup kitchen \nduring winter) and through its health programs. \nPlayground and park renovation. \nTextbook  and  stationery  for  orphanages  and  schools  in  northern \nAfghanistan. \nSport  and  recreational  events,  such  as  kite-flying  festivals  and  poetry \ncompetitions. Such events were banned under the Taliban and now serve \nto rebuild collective civil pride based on culture. \n\nVoter  information  outreach.  In  2005,  Roshan  provided  a  toll-free  number, \ncomputers  and  phones  free  of  charge  to  the  Joint  Electoral  Management  Body \nSecretariat  for  voters  to  access  information  on  the  parliamentary  and  provincial \nelections,  providing  access  for  the  many  people  who  are  unable  to  travel  to \nparticipate in civic education seminars. In the first 2 months, some 61,000 callers \naccessed the service. Roshan also provided technical support. \n\n \n(vi) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nProject Description \n\n24. \nThe  Project  includes  expanding  Roshan\u2019s  BTS  network,  building  out  a  synchronous \ndigital hierarchy (SDH)18 fiber-optic microwave ring, implementing alternative power solutions,19 \nincreasing capacity in existing cities, and enhancing network redundancy. \n \n25. \nIn  2005,  Roshan  started  to  build  out  an  SDH  microwave  backbone  to  reduce  the \ndependency  on  very  small  aperture  satellite  terminal  (VSAT). 20  The  move  from  VSAT  will \nreduce long-term transmission costs, improve local call quality and accelerate the ability to add \nadditional  capacity.  To  cater  to  the  projected  increase  in  subscribers  and  traffic,  additional \n\n                                                 \n18 A fiber-optic transmission system for high-speed digital traffic. \n19 Solar power is being evaluated as a replacement for diesel to power BTS sites. \n20 A small earth station for satellite transmission that handles up to 56 Kbits/sec of digital transmission.  \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n  \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n\ncapacity  will  be  needed  in  Kabul  and  the  other  main  cities.  To  meet  anticipated  increased \ncompetition in these areas, Roshan will continue to improve network quality. \n \n26. \nRoshan  is  connected  with  Pakistan  via  microwave  links  for  interconnecting  traffic \nbetween  Roshan  subscribers  and  Pakistan  operators.  In  2006,  Roshan  is  looking  to  transmit \ninternational  transit  traffic  through  Pakistan  via  fiber-optic  cable  in  Pakistan,  thus  improving \nquality and reducing VSAT costs later. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome  \n\n27. \nThe Project will directly benefit the current users within the coverage area, through better \nand cheaper services; potential new users in areas to which coverage will be expanded through \nthe Project; and users anywhere (within as well as outside Afghanistan) able to connect to the \nRoshan  network  through  better  service,  lower  prices,  and  a  wider  user  base  with  which  to \nconnect.  The  Project  will  also  directly  benefit  Roshan  stakeholders,  including  dealers, \nemployees, and recipients of its social development programs. Last, it will indirectly benefit all of \nAfghanistan and its trading partners by promoting economic activity, including lower transaction \ncosts. \n \n28. \nThe  Economist  ranks  the  growth  of  the  telecommunications  industry  as  the  \u201cbiggest \nsuccess  story\u201d  in  Afghanistan.  It  states  that  the  spread  of  mobile  phones  has  had  a \n\u201crevolutionary\u201d  impact  on  business,  even  among  local  farmers,  who  can  \u201ccheck  prices  before \nherding their sheep to market.\u201d 21 Roshan is considered to be one of the soundest private sector \ncompanies in the market, and the development impact of the proposed financing is believed to \nbe compelling. Roshan\u2019s phase-II expansion will have the following development impact: \n \n\nAccelerated,  wider  network  coverage  will  help  meet  substantial  unmet  demand \nfor \ntelecommunications  services,  promoting  economic  growth.  Agriculture, \nmerchandising,  manufacturing,  and  financial  services  benefit  from  improved \ntelecommunications. In addition, the Project is expected to improve the  delivery \nof services such as health care, education, and security throughout the country; \n\nExpanded coverage to remote areas will support rural development and pro-poor \neconomic  growth.  The  project  expansion  provides  critical  and \nflexible \ninfrastructure to meet the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises and the \nfarming sector where there is no access to other efficient forms of communication. \nThe project expansion will extend coverage of the PCO program to smaller towns \nand ill-served rural areas to a far greater extent than competitors\u2019 coverage. By \nopening up in smaller towns and cities, Roshan can, in the words of an industry \nobserver, \u201cpush these areas out of the middle ages and into the 21st century\u201d.22 \n\nThe  expansion  project  will  provide  direct \njobs,  and  business \nopportunities  in  underdeveloped  areas  to  staff,  dealers  and  subcontractors, \nincluding the MicroReach program, targeted at women.  \n\ntraining, \n\nIt will directly promote regional integration through its interconnectivity initiatives \nwith  neighboring  countries,  drawing  on  the  links  forged  by  Roshan  and  its \n\n                                                 \n21 The Economist.  2006.

Evaluation of the Project will \nbe  based  on  three  levels:  (i)  the  success  of  the  Project  itself,  (ii)  development  of  the \ntelecommunications  sector  in  general,  and  (iii)  private  sector  development.  Please  see \nAppendix  1  for  the  development  impact  and  performance  monitoring  framework,  including \nrelevant performance indicators. \n \nE. \n\nProject Review \n\nThe  Project  will  be  reviewed  regularly  as  per  standard  ADB  portfolio  management  and \n\n31. \nproject evaluation practice. \n \nF. \n\nEnvironmental and Other Safeguard Policy Aspects \n\n32. \nRoshan\u2019s  construction  works  have  virtually  no  negative  impact  on  the  environment. \nThere  will  be  minimal  cable  construction,  and  masts  will  be  located  on  existing  buildings  or  in \nopen fields. The environmental category of the phase-I project was C, and the Project has been \nassigned  the  same  classification.  The  due-diligence  assessment  showed  that  Roshan  has  in \nplace  satisfactory  procedures  for  site  selection  and  construction  of  BTSs,  fuels/hazardous \nmaterial (batteries) use, and disposal of BTSs and waste management (solid and liquid wastes \ngenerated  as  part  of  the  installation  of  BTSs).  Neither  the  original  construction  nor  the \nexpansion  will  result  in  any  resettlement,  and  the  Project  has  accordingly  been  classified  as \ninvoluntary resettlement category C. The Project is not foreseen to have any negative impact on \nindigenous  peoples,  and  is  consequently  under  category  C.  The  indigenous  people  and \ninvoluntary resettlement categorizations are also unchanged from phase I. \n \n \n\nV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nOverview \n\n33. \nADB was first approached by Roshan and AKFED in early 2004 about possible financing \nof the first phase of Roshan\u2019s national network expansion. The phase-I expansion project was \nselected for ADB support, given the technical and financial sustainability of the business model, \nthe  economic  and  social  benefits  of  the  Project,  including  environmental  sustainability,  the \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n  \n\nunmet  need  for  medium-term  finance  from  the  commercial  market,  its  role  in  advancing \nregulatory reform, and its full compatibility with ADB\u2019s CSPU. \n \n34. \nFollowing the completed disbursement of phase-I financing, in December 2005 Roshan \nrequested ADB and its other senior lenders, PROPARCO and SB, for further funding. Access to \nsuch  additional  funding  would  allow  for  a  quicker  response  to  higher-than-expected  market \ndemand. Without the phase-II funding, Roshan\u2019s pace of expansion will have to be significantly \nreduced. \n \nB. \n\nNature and Amount \n\n35. \n\nADB\u2019s proposed financial assistance is expected to consist of the following components: \n(i) \n(ii) \n\na term loan of up to $40 million without government guarantee; and/or \na CFS in two tranches, of (a) about $15 million23 and (b) $5 million\u2013$15 million24; \nand \na possible PRG for CFS tranche 2 of the same amount. \n\n(iii) \n\nDepending  on  the  final  size  of  the  PRG,  the  loan  could  range  from  $32.5  million  (with \n\n \n36. \nPRG for $15.0 million in CFS tranche 2) to $40.0 million (no PRG for CFS tranche 2). \n \nC. \n\nValue-Added by ADB \n\n37. \nIt  must  be  appreciated  that  any  investment  or  loan  in  Afghanistan  is,  by  virtue  of  the \npolitical  and  security  environment,  inherently  risky.  In  such  risky  environments,  ADB  can  (in \naddition  to  the  direct  development  impact  of  ADB\u2019s  financing)  add  value  by  mitigating  other \nlenders\u2019 risk through use of its CFS or PRG products. In this way, the development impacts can \nbe amplified. In the Project, ADB will add value through the following measures: \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nfinancing,  mobile  network  expansion \n\nCatalyzing  further  commercial  financing  to  a  thriving  sector  in  Afghanistan. \nWithout  secure,  medium-term \nin \nAfghanistan  will  be  constrained,  which  will,  in  turn,  constrain  economic \ndevelopment.  No  local  debt  market  exists  at  present  and  offshore  commercial \nand  export  credit  debt  sources  are  not  yet  prepared  to  extend  uncovered \nfinancing  to  businesses  in  Afghanistan.  Without  the  proposed  financing  and \nADB\u2019s CFS-PRG structure, it is possible that Roshan\u2019s expansion program may \nhave  to  be  significantly  scaled  back  and/or  delayed  as  the  commercial  bank \nfunding would almost certainly not be forthcoming. \n\nDemonstrating  the  continued  support  for  a  sustainable,  well-capitalized,  private \nsector-led,  Afghan  reconstruction  effort  success  story  (of  which  there  are  not \nto  consider \nmany),  encouraging  entrepreneurs  and \ninvestments  in  key  sectors  in  Afghanistan,  and  forcing  competitors  to  improve \nservice offering and performance, and \n\ninvestors \n\nfinancial \n\nSupporting  a  professional,  well-managed  and  respected  industry  participant  in \nleading  the  dialogue  with  government  and  other  stakeholders  about  sector \ndevelopment,  and,  in  this  context,  enhancing  the  value-added  that  ADB  has \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\n                                                 \n23 Amount  equivalent  to  the  remaining  vendor  financing  (originally  from  Alcatel)  outstanding  at  the  date  of  signing \n\n(currently \u20ac12.5 million) . \n\n24  Depending on level of commercial bank interest. \n\n\f \n\n 11\n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\ndemonstrated by recently and decisively engaging with the government regarding \nsafeguarding private sector interests. \n\n \nD. \n\nLink to Country Strategy and Program \n\n38. \nThe  proposed  loan  is  fully  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  update \n(CSPU)  and  the  Government\u2019s  strategic  intentions.  ADB\u2019s  most  recent  CSPU 25 reports  the \nGovernment\u2019s  endorsement  of  ADB\u2019s  three-pronged  approach  to  reconstruction  through  (i) \nbuilding  capacity,  (ii)  establishing  appropriate  policy  and  institutional  frameworks,  and  (iii) \nrehabilitating essential infrastructure. Aiming at expanding the cellular communications network \nnationwide,  the  Project  is  part  of  the  third  prong.  Since  the  Project  is  designed  to  promote \neconomic  growth  through  improved  telecommunications  (benefiting  all  productive  sectors  and \nconsumers) and related spill-over effects, it is fully in line with the CSPU\u2019s assertion that ADB\u2019s \nentire public sector lending program for 2005\u20132008 will be allocated to economic growth.  The \nCSPU  specifically  mentions  telecommunications  as  an  area  offering  private  sector  investment \nopportunities. The nationwide coverage, focusing on rollout into rural towns, further supports the \nCSPU  in  that  it  would  contribute  towards  \u201creducing  rising  inequalities  in  incomes  in  different \nregions as well as gaps between urban and rural areas.\u201d  \n \n39. \nRoshan\u2019s  active  efforts  to  promote  regional  integration  via  interconnection  agreements \nwith  operators  in  neighboring  countries  are  also  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  CSPU  pledge  to  support \nactivities  that  will  strengthen  Afghanistan\u2019s  links  with  its  regional  neighbors,  and  that  \u201cmore \nefforts  will  be  made  to  incorporate  a  regional  dimension  in  loan  projects,  such  as\u2026ensuring \nconnectivity  with  regional\u2026grids\u201d.  26 Last,  the  CSPU  states  explicitly  that  no  change  is \nanticipated in ADB\u2019s deep engagement in the telecommunications sector (via the existing loan \nto  Roshan,  and  also  through  ADB\u2019s  membership  in  the  consultative  group  for  energy,  mining \nand  telecommunications),  as  \u201cADB\u2019s\u2026private  sector  support  to  the\u2026telecommunications \nsectors\u2026\u201d is \u201chighly appreciated\u201d by the Government of Afghanistan. \n\nE. \n\nCompliance with Investment Limits \n\n40. \nThe  proposed  investment,  ADB\u2019s  fifth  private  sector  investment  in  Afghanistan,  would, \nonce  approved  by  the  Board,  represent  2.26%  of  ADB\u2019s  total  private  sector  exposure,27 and \nincrease ADB\u2019s private sector investment (i) in Afghanistan from 2.14% to 4.35% total exposure, \nand  (ii)  in  the  telecommunications  and  communications  sector  from  3.06%  to  5.26%  total \nexposure. ADB's exposure to Roshan would increase from $35 million to (up to) $75 million. The \nproposed investment is within approved aggregate, country, industry, group, and single-project \nexposure limits for ADB's private sector projects. \n \nF. \n\nAnticorruption  Measures:  Combating  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of \nTerrorism  \n\n \n41. \nRoshan  has  been  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  policies  to  combat  corruption,  money  laundering, \nand financing of terrorism. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, \nand  transparency,  ADB  will  require  Roshan  to  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with  internal \nprocedures and controls following international best-practice standards to prevent corruption or \n\n                                                 \n25 ADB. 2005.

Manila. \n26 While this statement specifically refers to power transmission, an analogous argument can be made for support for \n\nconnectivity to regional telecommunications grids.   \n\n27 Exposure  is  defined  as  (outstanding  portfolio  and/or  disbursements)+(undisbursed  commitments).

The  Ministry  of \nCommunications  (MOC)  said  there  were  only  33,000  lines  in  service  in  the  country\u2019s  major \ncities, while lines in provincial and rural areas had not been considered as so few were working. \nAs a result of a complete lack of investment in fixed-line telephony since the Soviet occupation \nin  1979,  Afghanistan's  existing  infrastructure  was  either  neglected  through  lack  of  funding  or \ndamaged in the armed conflict that spanned nearly 26 years. The capital, Kabul, was estimated \nto have just 20,150 fixed lines in the late 1990s, serving over 2 million people, with most calls \ndialed being either dropped or never connected. \n \n2. \nfirms  mention \ntelecommunications  as  a  major  or  severe  problem.  Afghanistan\u2019s  tele-density3  in  2005  is \nestimated  at  around  46  (or  4.6%).  This  can  be  compared  with  the  latest  data  (2003)  for  other \ncomparable  countries:  Sudan  at  4.7%,  Somalia  at  4.8%,  Zimbabwe  at  5.8%,  and  Lesotho  at \n6.3%.

Millennium  Indicator:  \u201cTelephone  lines  and  cellular  subscribers  per  100  population  (ITU \nestimates)\u201d. Geneva. Highly developed countries such as Luxemburg, Sweden, or Switzerland have tele-densities \nin the 170\u2013200% range. The Philippines had a tele-density of 31% in 2003. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nLinked  to  GDP,  tele-density  forecasts5  place  achievable  targets  for  Afghanistan  at  120 \n4. \n(12%, or 3.5 million subscribers) by 20156 (comparable to that of Mongolia or Gabon in 2000). \nMost  of  this  growth  will  be  accounted  for  by  cellular  telephony  and  will  be  led  by  the  private \nsector.  The  estimated  necessary  network  build-out  investment  is  about  $1  billion.7  Current \nprivate  investments  in  mobile  networks  stand  at  some  $240  million.  Thus,  on  average, \nAfghanistan  would  need  some  $76  million  of  investments  per  year  to  reach  the  forecasted \nlevels. \n \nB. \n\nSector Policy and Regulatory Environment \n\n5. \nMOC  is  responsible  for  formulating  sector  policy.  The  telecommunications  regulatory \nenvironment  is  undergoing  extensive  reform,  as  state-owned  operating  companies  are  being \nprepared for eventual privatization, and the regulatory functions are being disengaged from the \noperating  units  within  MOC.  The  World  Bank  has  had  a  central  role  in  helping  establish  of  a \ntelecommunications  law  and  telecommunications  regulatory  environment  and  has  contracted \nlong-term consultants to work with MOC and with the nascent regulatory authority. \n \nThe    Telecom  Law8  was  promulgated  in  December  2005,  and  a  regulatory  board,  the \n6. \nAfghanistan  Telecommunications  Regulatory  Authority  (ATRA)  has  been  set  up  under  the \nauspices  of  MOC  (it  will  ultimately  be  an  independent  agency,  funded  by  levies  on  the \noperators). This law replaced the Laws on Regulation of Telephone Services 1964, 1968, and \n2000. New salient features include provisions for regulating tariffs of operators with \u201csignificant \nmarket power\u201d, and for the oversight by ATRA of the Telecom Development Fund, the objective \nof  which  is  to  fund  telecom  development  projects  that  may  not  be  undertaken  on  commercial \ngrounds by the operators, funded by levies on operator revenues. ATRA was formed out of the \ninterim Telecommunications Regulatory Board of Afghanistan (TRAB), set up in 2003 as a direct \nresponse to the need for regulation thanks to the introduction of competition through the entry of \nRoshan as second operator. The Telecom Law was expected to be enacted as early as in late \n2004, but was only promulgated in December of 2005.  \n \n7. \nThere  remains  an  access  agenda  for  rural  areas,  a  need  to  considerably  improve  the \nquality  and  range  of  services  and  to  further  reduce  prices.  Nonetheless,  progress  to  date  has \nbeen remarkable. The Telecom Development Fund will play a role in this area. \n \n8. \nOver  the  past  4  years,  as  the  telecommunications  sector  has  continued  to  develop, \ntelecommunications revenues have grown to become a significant portion of the Government\u2019s \nbudget. \n \n9. \nToday, the main objective of Government policy for communications is to modernize and \nrapidly expand telecommunications networks and services, and to achieve universal access to \ntelephony  across  the  country.  The  Government  is  also  focusing  on  information  and \ncommunication  technologies,  seeking  to  create  opportunities  for  disadvantaged  groups,  and \ninvesting  in  developing  such  opportunities.  The  Government  recognizes  the  significance  of \ncreating  the  right  conditions  for  open  competition  and  private  sector  investment  by  ensuring  a \nstable  and  transparent  policy,  legal,  and  regulatory  environment.  More  recently,  initial  steps \n\n                                                 \n5  Fay,  M.  and  T.  Yepes.  2003.  Cited  in  M.  N.  Naseri.  November  2005.

The  ministry  inherited  two \nseparate fixed-line networks, one outdated analogue system dating back to Soviet rule, and a \nnewer fiber-optic network used by the Taliban. Neither network extended beyond the country\u2019s \nborders nor did they offer reliable interconnectivity, hence Afghanistan relied heavily on satellite \nconnectivity  for  international  calls  and  limited  data  transmission,  as  well  as  for  most  domestic \nlong-distance services.  \n \n11. \nDespite the significant domestic and international support, rehabilitation of the fixed-line \ntelecommunications  sector  has  moved  very  slowly,  hampered  by  security  issues  and  the \nabsence  of  infrastructure.  After  securing  new  funding  from  a  number  of  sources  in  2003,  the \ninterim Government announced a number of emergency equipment tenders in a bid to establish \na base for launching the new fixed-line network. Among the institutions providing financial help \nwas the Afghan International Development Trust Fund, which pledged $3 million in grants, and \nthe World Bank, which approved a $22 million loan. \n \n12. \nThe Government\u2019s priority has been to provide backbone services, fixed mobile services \nin major urban areas and service provision in the districts. The MOC\u2019 investment program over \nthe next few years includes the following: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\ntelecommunications  infrastructure,  including  a  fiber-optic  ring  as  well  as \nmicrowave  spurs  to  link  towns  and  cities  that  are  not  on  major  roads,  a  district \ncommunications  initiative,  an  expansion  of  the  MOC-owned  fixed  wireless \nnetwork  to  uncovered  provinces  and  other  items,  including  billing  systems  and \nspectrum management; \nrehabilitation and construction of facilities in Kabul, regional capitals, districts and \nairports, and hotels; \nconstruction  and  operation  of  facilities  for  the  training  of  management  and \ntechnical staff; and \nsupport to the regulatory and legal frameworks and restructuring of each postal \nand telecommunications operator into viable entities. \n\n \nAlthough no second fixed-line operator is licensed in Afghanistan, the regulator has set \n13. \naside  within  its  numbering  plan  the  possibility  of  two  further  licensees.  There  are  currently  no \nplans to award additional fixed-line licenses in Afghanistan. \n \nD. \n\nMobile Telephony Market \n\n14. \nDriven  by  a  competitive  market  and  $200  million  in  private  investment,  the  mobile \nfootprint covers as much as 50\u201360% of the population. Statistics on the population and size of \nsettlements  are  limited  and  unreliable,  hence,  estimates  as  to  the  penetration  of  mobile \ntelephony are approximate. Similarly, not all operators publicize subscriber numbers.  \n \n15. \nFollowing  the  first  commercial  launch  in  Kabul  in  April  2002,  mobile  services  have \ndeveloped rapidly, reaching more than 1.1 million subscribers by December 2005 and expected \nto reach 2.2 million by the end of 2006.  \n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nGiven the low penetration rate of 4.6% at the end of 2005, and the fact that 50% of the \n16. \npopulation  are  15  years  of  age  or  younger,  the prospects  for  market  growth  are  significant.  In \n2003, the MOC estimated that by 2015 there would be about 3.5 million telephony subscribers \nfor  both  fixed  and  mobile  services;  this  estimate  now  seems  to  have  been  conservative  given \nthe  expected  2.2m  mobile  subscribers  by  the  end  of  2006  (which  equates  to  a  penetration  of \njust  8.4%).  Similarly,  the  Government\u2019s  target  of  12%  mobile  penetration  by  2015  also  seems \nconservative. \n \nConfidence  in  the  sector  has  resulted  in  significant  private  sector  investments,  most \n17. \nrecently evidenced in 2005 by the $40.1 million paid by Investcom for Afghanistan\u2019s third mobile \nlicense.  Investcom  is  expected  to  launch  services  during  Q3  2006.  The  significant  mark-up  in \nlicense fee compared with the $5 million paid by Roshan is further evidence of the confidence of \nthe private sector in the growth prospects of this market. Nonetheless, the anticipated arrival of \nInvestcom as one of two new operators should boost subscriber figures further for all operators, \nby  improving  market  awareness  of  mobile  telephony,  and  by  expanding  network  coverage  to \nnew areas. \n \n\n1. \n\nMarket Structure \n\n18. \nThe cellular market is currently served by two private cellular network operators, Roshan \nand AWCC  and the state-run fixed-line operator Afghan Telecom. Competition has resulted in \nprice decreases, which has dramatically increased affordability to users, and the introduction of \nprepaid subscriptions means low barriers to adoption for a broad spectrum of users. \n \nBoth  AWCC  and  Roshan  offer  national  and  international  mobile  calling,  voice  mail, \n19. \nnational and international SMS, and data services, on prepaid pricing plans. Roshan also offers \na limited, by invitation only, postpaid pricing plan to corporations. The unreliability of the postal \nservice and lack of retail banking infrastructure, remain a barrier to the further development of \nthis product.  \n \n20. \nAlongside  the  three  operators,  there  is  also  a  GSM  network  run  by  Ericsson  for  the \nUnited Nations forces and international aid organizations in Kabul. It was launched in 2002 and \nhas capacity for about 5,000 users. \n \nA further cellular license9 was awarded in late 2005 to a third entrant, Investcom.  With \n21. \nthe addition of the new operator, the six major cities and their surrounding areas will become a \nkey competitive area, as Investcom is bound by a license requirement to build out these areas \nwithin six months of commercial launch. \n \n22. \nfourth mobile license. A credible rumored buyer is UAE\u2019s Etisalat.  \n \nE. \n\nAs of the end of March 2005, MOC had made no public statements on the award of a \n\nSource: Roshan, Standard Bank. \nInternet Communication \n\nThe internet has come to be one of the most efficient ways for firms to communicate and \n23. \nto conduct business with distant clients. However, in Afghanistan, business use of the internet is \nnearly nonexistent outside of a few of the largest cities. On average 15% of the surveyed firms10 \n\n                                                 \n9  A  second  license  was  awarded  in  late  2005,  but  as  the  awardee  failed  to  pay  the  license  fee,  the  award  was \n\nwithdrawn. \n\n10 World Bank. December 2005. \n\n\fregularly use e-mail in interactions wit their clients and suppliers and 9% use web pages. There \nis  a  distinct  regional  difference  in  the  use  of  the  internet.  Almost  a  quarter  of  enterprises  in \nKabul, Herat, and Mazar-e-Sharif reported using the internet. But in Jalalabad and Kandahar no \nfirms reported using websites and only 6% of the sample in Kandahar used e-mail. \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n19 \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nADB ASSISTANCE FOR

AKDN,  which  has  been  supporting  humanitarian  assistance  and \nrehabilitation in Afghanistan since 1996, works for the common good of all citizens, regardless \nof  their  gender,  origin  or  religion.  Its  underlying  impulse  is  the  ethic  of  compassion  for  the \nvulnerable  in  society.  Its  programs  in  Afghanistan  come  under  a  comprehensive  development \nagreement signed by the Aga Khan and President Hamid Karzai.  \n \n3. \nFor more than 50 years, AKFED has made investments and operated companies in the \ndeveloping nations of Africa, South Asia, and Central Asia. AKFED seeks to create profitable, \nsustainable enterprises through long-term investments that result in strong equity positions. This \nin  turn  allows  AKFED  to  take  a  \u201chands-on\u201d  approach  by  providing  managerial  and  technical \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nexpertise.  Profits  generated  by  the  Fund  are  reinvested  in  other  economic  development \ninitiatives under the AKFED umbrella. \n \n4. \nAKFED often works in collaboration with local and international development partners to \ncreate  and  operate  companies  that  provide  goods  and  services  essential  to  economic \ndevelopment.  These  range  from  banking  to  electric  power,  agricultural  processing,  hotels, \nairlines  and  telecommunications.  AKFED  also  works  with  governments  to  help  promote  the \ncreation of enabling legal and fiscal structures that encourage the growth of the private sector.  \n \n5. \nAt  the  invitation  of  several  governments,  AKFED  has  helped  critical  sectors  make  the \ntransition  to  market  economies  through  privatization.  These  include  such  as  banking,  power \ngeneration, tourism, manufacturing, and agriculture in countries as varied as Uganda, Tajikistan, \nPakistan,  and  Afghanistan.  AKFED\u2019s  approach  emphasizes  the  development  of  local  human \nresources  over  time,  including  managerial,  technical,  marketing,  and  financial  skills.  Other \ncharacteristics  of  this  approach  include  providing  essential  seed  capital  to  launch  projects  in \nthose  sectors  and  countries  where  attracting  investment  is  difficult.  AKFED  takes  a  long-term \nview in order to build viable, self-sustaining, and profitable companies. It also participates in the \nmanagement of companies in which it invests with the aim of preparing companies for broader \nownership by local interests. \n \n\na. \n\nFinancial Services  \n\n6. \nTo  encourage  the  creation  of  strong  and  efficient  capital  markets,  AKFED  provides  an \ninstitutional  umbrella  for  banks,  insurance  groups,  and  property-owning  and  management \ncompanies in eastern Africa, Central Asia, and South Asia.  \n \n7. \nAKFED\u2019s  investments  include  a  controlling  interest  in  Habib  Bank  Limited  (HBL), \nPakistan\u2019s largest private bank (acquired through a government privatization program in 2004) \nand the Development Credit Bank Limited (DCB) in India. AKFED is also the founder and lead \nshareholder in the Kyrgyz Investment and Credit Bank (KICB), which focuses on the corporate \nsector  and  on  medium  and  long-term  finance  that  will  contribute  to  the  growth  of  the  banking \nindustry and stimulate entrepreneurial activity. In Bangladesh, AKFED is the majority owner of a \nleading provider of corporate finance and lending services to major businesses and projects.  \n \n8. \nIts  holdings  in  East  Africa  include  the  Diamond  Trust  Bank,  which  was  founded  in  the \n1930s in Kenya to help recycle local savings into loans for home building and small businesses. \nIt  now  offers  a  range  of  retail  banking  products.  The  Jubilee  Insurance  Group  provides \ninsurance across the region. In Pakistan, New  Jubilee Insurance and New Jubilee Life offer a \nrange of products.  \n \n\nb. \n\nTourism Development  \n\n9. \nAKFED\u2019s  Tourism  Promotion  Services  (TPS)  seeks  to  develop  tourism  potential  in \nselected  areas  in  the  developing  world,  particularly  in  underserved  regions.  It  builds, \nrehabilitates, and manages hotels and lodges that contribute to economic growth and the overall \ninvestment climate in an environmentally and culturally sensitive manner.  \n \n10. \nAKFED  owns  and  manages  properties  in  Afghanistan,  Kenya,  Mozambique,  Pakistan, \nTajikistan, Tanzania, and Uganda, operating under the brand name Serena. Serena hotels and \nlodges  contribute  to  the  local  economy  through  the  training  of  skilled  manpower,  the \nthrough  sensitive  conservation  or \nindustries,  and \nreinvigoration  of  artisans  and  craft \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n27 \n\nTPS  often  seeks \n\nto  develop  properties \n\ndevelopment of the surrounding area. This includes placing priority on the hiring and training of \nlocal residents for employment at all levels of the organisation.  \n \n11. \nrequire \naccommodation  of  an  international  standard\u2014accommodation  that  supports  tourism  and \nbusiness development\u2014but which often are ignored by commercial hotel chains.  \n \n12. \nAt  each  hotel,  the  policy  is  to  minimize  the  impact  on  the  local  environment  while \nseeking  to  maximize  socioeconomic  benefits  to  the  local  economy.  In  Tanzania,  for  example, \nbefore  the  creation  of  new  facilities  in  the  country\u2019s  national  parks,  four  environmental  impact \nstudies were carried out. The Serena Hotel in Mombasa maintains a sanctuary for indigenous \nbutterflies and also works with local residents on a program to protect sea turtle nesting sites. \nThese measures have earned the Serena hotels numerous environmental awards.  \n \n\nless-travelled  areas \n\nthat \n\nin \n\nc. \n\nIndustry  \n\nAKFED has invested in and manages over 50 industrial project companies in Africa and \n13. \nAsia. In the early 1960s, a group of companies was set up under the corporate name Industrial \nPromotion  Services  (IPS).  Each  company  was  created  to  provide  venture  capital,  technical \nassistance, and management support to encourage and expand private enterprise in countries \nof  sub-Saharan  Africa  and  South  Asia.  Growth,  privatization  and  a  reorientation  away  from \nimport  substitution  and  toward  export  promotion  resulted  in  adjustments  to  IPS\u2019  approach. \nExpansion into areas such as agribusiness, packaging, and infrastructure in sub-Saharan Africa \nwere accompanied by the need for new investments in the emerging economies of Central Asia \nin the 1990s and 2000s, in particular, in Tajikistan and Afghanistan. Today, IPS companies play \na vital role in local and regional economies.  \n \n\nd. \n\nFood and Agroprocessing  \n\n14. \nOne  of  IPS\u2019  core  operational  sectors,  agroprocessing,  includes  companies  that  supply \ngoods  for  local  and  export  markets.  They  also  play  a  significant  role  in  supporting  the  rural \neconomy.  In  Kenya,  for  example,  Frigoken  provides  agricultural  extension  services  to  25,000 \nKenyan bean farmers. The beans are processed and exported to European markets. Loans are \nprovided to the farmers by the nonprofit Aga Khan Agency for Microfinance to assist them with \nfinancial needs that arise before receiving harvest revenues.  \n \nIn  West  Africa,  AKFED  supplies  agricultural  extension  services  to  more  than  45,000 \n15. \ncotton  farmers,  operates  cotton  ginneries,  and  exports  finished  products.  Its  social  programs \noffer microfinance, education, health, and sanitation to the farmers.  \n \nIn  addition  to  promoting  the  employment  of  women,  these  companies  have  become \n16. \nnational  role  models  in  matters  of  employee  welfare,  including  the  provision  of  child  care  and \nhealth care.  \n \n\ne. \n\nInfrastructure  \n\n17. \nAKFED  works  with  governments,  international  corporations,  international  financial \ninstitutions, and funding agencies to create solutions to pressing infrastructure needs, including \npower generation, telecommunications and water supply services. AKFED\u2019s first investment in \nthe  power  sector,  the  $225  million  Azito  energy  project  in  the  Ivory  Coast,  was  the  largest \nprivate  sector  power  plant  in  sub-Saharan  Africa.  It  was  followed  by  the  Tsavo  power  plant  in \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nMombasa,  Kenya\u2019s  first  privately  financed  \u201copen-bid\u201d  project  and  the  first  such  plant \nsuccessfully constructed under an updated and more stringent environmental law.  \n \n18. \nAKFED  is  also  working  with  partners  to  rehabilitate  and  expand  a  Soviet-era \nhydroelectric  power  plant  that  will  boost  the  eastern  province  of  Tajikistan\u2019s  inadequate \nelectricity  supply,  reduce  deforestation,  and  contribute  to  the  region\u2019s  economic  recovery.  In \nUganda,  AKFED  is  leading  the  $500-million,  220-megawatt  Bujagali  Hydro  Power  Project,  to \nproduce critically needed electricity for the country, and for neighbouring Kenya.  \n \n19. \nAKFED\u2019s initial involvement in building telecommunications infrastructure was in Indigo, \na GSM mobile phone operation in Tajikistan. Subsequently AKFED was awarded Afghanistan\u2019s \nsecond  GSM  license  and  created  Roshan  which  is  today  one  of  the  largest  employers  in  the \ncountry. \n \n\nf. \n\nMedia Services  \n\nThe Nation Media Group, founded by the Aga Khan in 1960, has its origins in Kenya\u2019s \n20. \nTaifa  and  Nation  newspapers,  which  were  set  up  to  provide  independent  voices  during  the \nyears just before the country\u2019s independence. Majority owned and run by Kenyans, the Nation \nMedia  Group\u2019s  operations  include  a  growing  number  of  English  and  Kiswahili  national \nnewspapers, a regional weekly, and radio and television stations. In recent years, the group has \nexpanded its operations into Uganda and Tanzania.  \n \n\ng. \n\nAviation Services  \n\n22. \nThe aim of the aviation division is to maintain the critical aviation infrastructure in support \nof  economic  development.  The  division  provides  investment,  management,  and  operational \nexpertise  and  training.  AKFED  has  taken  a  majority  stake  in  Air  Burkina,  as  part  of  a \ngovernment privatization plan designed to ensure the long-term viability of the airline. In 2005, \nAKFED launched an airline in Mali to increase capacity in West Africa. \n  \n\n2. \n\nMonaco Telecom International \n\n21.

The focus within Monaco is on the quality of service while \nmaintaining pricing parity with neighbouring countries.  \n \n23. \nOn  18  June  2004,  Cable  &  Wireless  acquired  55%  of  Monaco  Telecom  from  Vivendi \nUniversal, for a total consideration of \u20ac162 million. Simultaneously with the acquisition, Cable & \nWireless  transferred  legal  ownership  of  6%  of  the  shares  of  Monaco  Telecom  to  Compagnie \nMone-gasque  de  Banque,  an  unrelated  third  party.  Cable  &  Wireless  contractually  retained \nvoting and economic rights in the shares as part of the arrangement. In addition, the 6% interest \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n29 \n\nis  subject  to  certain  put  and  call  options  that,  together  with  the  retained  voting  and  economic \nrights, provide full management control of Monaco Telecom to Cable & Wireless. \n \n24. \nCable & Wireless has also entered into a shareholders\u2019 agreement with Monaco, which \ncontains,  among  other  provisions,  a  prohibition  on  either  Cable  &  Wireless  or  the  principality \n(subject  to  certain  limited  exceptions)  selling  their  shares  in  Monaco  Telecom  for  5  years, \nmutual  preemption  rights  on  transfer  of  shares  and  certain  other  limited  rights  in  favor  of  the \nprincipality. The principality has a put option entitling it to put its 45% shareholding in Monaco \nTelecom  to  Cable  &  Wireless  at  certain  times  after  1  January  2008.  The  exercise  price  under \nthe put option is fair market value, taking into account the nature of the minority stake in Monaco \nTelecom. \n \n25. \nTelecom generated \u00a3100 million in revenues and \u00a317 million in operating profit. \n \n26.  Monaco  Telecom  is  developing  its  international  activities  in  network  management  and \nsatellite services.

In  May  2004,  President  Karzai  signed  a  decree  separating  the  regulatory  and \noperational functions of the ministry, spinning off the provision of telecommunications services \nand network management into a wholly owned subsidiary, the National Telecoms Company of \nAfghanistan  (Afghan  Telecom).  Similarly,  the  ministry  has  reoriented  itself  as  a  policy-making \nbody.  \n \n3. \nOn  17  August  2005,  the  presidential  decree  laying  the  foundation  for  the  formation  of \nAfghan Telecom was approved by the Ministry of Justice, and the operator was registered as a \nbusiness  with  the  Afghan  Investment  Support  Agency  (AISA);  the  ministerial  cabinet \nsubsequently  gave  its  final  approval.  The  MOC\u2019  long-term  plan  is  to  sell  off  stakes  to  private \ninvestors, both domestic and foreign, and to attract a strategic partner to manage the operator \npost-corporatization.  Press  reports  suggest  that  the  ministry  has  already  been  in  discussions \nwith Etisalat, the United Arab Emirates-owned operator.  \n \n4. \nAfghan  Telecom  has  a  presence  in  Kabul  and  all  33  provincial  centres  as  well  as  100 \ndistricts. Afghan Telecom operates a digital service mainly in Kabul, Herat, and Mazar-e-Sharif \nwhere  national  and  international  satellite  links  have  been  established.  Kabul  has  installed  a \n12,000  fixed-line  digital  switch  with  7,000  active  lines.  Herat  has  a  60,000  fixed-line  digital \nsystem  and  Mazar-e-Sharif  has  a  capacity  for  4,000  lines.  Afghan  Telecom  also  operates  an \nanalogue network mainly in Kabul with an estimated 8,000 active lines although the switch has \ncapacity for 15,000 lines; work is under way to convert these lines to digital. There is a VSAT \nnetwork  between  Kabul  and  the  four  of  the  five  \u201ctier  1\u201d  cities,  with  work  under  way  to  expand \nVSAT  connections  to  the  other  provincial  capitals.  The  Government  has  expressed  the  hope \nthat there will be 600,000 active subscriber lines within the next 18 months. In areas where no \ntelephony  services  exist,  Afghan  Telecom  plans  to  select  local  partners  which  will  build  and \noperate local networks on a build-operate-transfer (BOT) basis. \n \n5. \nPursuant  to  the  MOC\u2019  telecommunications  and  internet  policy  of  2003,  fixed-line \ntelephony licensees were entitled to provide mobile services effective 9 January 2006. Afghan \nTelecom  is  the  only  operator  positioned  to  benefit  from  this  policy,  particularly  given  the \ntechnically related procedures to transform Afghan Telecom into a prepaid mobile CDMA player \nfrom the fixed-wireless, limited mobility postpaid operation it is today. Similarly, albeit somewhat \nstrategically  less  appealing,  mobile  licensees  are  entitled  to  offer  fixed  services  effective  the \nsame date. This policy has been known to, and accepted by, the telecommunications industry \nsince  early  2005.  Afghan  Telecom  has  now  started  providing  services  and  carries  about  22m \ncalls/month.  Focusing  on  the  Government  and  district  communications  networks,  Afghan \nTelecom services are expected to reach every provincial and district capital within the next year. \n \nB. \n\nAfghan Wireless Communications Company (AWCC) \n\nAWCC is a joint venture between US-based Telephone Systems International (TSI) (as \n6. \n80%  shareholder)  and  the  MOC  (20%).  AWCC  was  founded  in  1999  and  launched  GSM \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nservices  in  Kabul  in  April  20021  with  four  base  stations,  investing  $60  million  in  its  network  in \nthat year, and achieving rapid subscriber growth in its first months of operation on the back of \nsignificant pent-up demand stemming from the lack of fixed-line infrastructure. Initially operating \nunder an interim mobile services authorisation, AWCC was awarded a full 15-year GSM licence \nin July 2003.  \n \n7. \nAWCC's customer base is largely concentrated around Kabul and, to some extent, in the \nlarger  urban  centres  of  Herat,  Mazar-i-sharif,  and  Kandahar.  By  the  end  of  2005,  AWCC\u2019s \nnetwork  provided  services  in  40  cities  and  towns  across  19  of  Afghanistan\u2019s  34  provinces, \nincluding coverage of the cities of Jalalabad, Kunduz, Baglan, Puli Kumri, Talaqan, Logar, Puli \nAman, Bagram, Charikar, Jabal Saraj, and Serobir. AWCC introduced international roaming in \n2004, and has expanded its offering to include 184 networks in 76 countries worldwide, as well \nas offering international SMS messaging. AWCC employs 1,720 employees, 905 of which are \nlocal Afghans. \n \nC. \n\nInvestcom Group (Investcom) \n\nleading \n\nin  1982, \n\nInvestcom \n\nEstablished \n\n8. \ninternational  provider  of  mobile \nis  a \ntelecommunications  services  operating  through  a  number  of  subsidiaries  and  joint  ventures  in \nthe  emerging  markets  of  the  Middle  East  and  Africa,  as  well  as  in  Europe.  Incorporated  in \nDubai, Investcom operates GSM mobile telephony networks in eight countries: Benin, Cyprus, \nGhana, Guinea Bissau, Liberia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen, where it offers local and international \nvoice and data, satellite, carrier and internet-related services. The total population under license \ncoverage area is more than 147 million and as at September 2005 Investcom had more than 3.7 \nmillion subscribers, having achieved number-one position in most of its markets.  \n \n9. \nInvestcom  is  majority-owned  and  -controlled  by  the  Mikati  family  of  Lebanon.  On  7 \nOctober 2005, Investcom offered 23.7% of its shares on the London Stock Exchange and the \nDubai International Financial Exchange. The offering valued the Investcom group at $3.3 billion. \n \n10. \nInvestcom  has  a  successful  track  record  of  earning  significant  returns  in  high-risk \nenvironments.  During  the  first  nine  months  of  2005  Investcom  generated  revenues  of  $646 \nmillion and EBITDA of $296 million, up from 46.3% and 55% respectively on the previous year. \n \n11. \nIn September 2005, Investcom was designated as the winner of the third license for the \nprovision of GSM services within Afghanistan, for which it paid $40.1 million. The license has a \nterm of 15 years and is renewable for a further 10 years. The license also requires Investcom to \nprovide  50%  population  coverage  in  Kabul  within  6  months  of  license  award  and  80% \npopulation  coverage  in  a  specified  list  of  major  cities  and  towns  within  12  months.  It  also \nprescribes a timetable for a minimum number of base stations to be deployed and operational. \nThe prior consent of the MOC is required for any assignment of the license. Investcom will also \nhave the right to own and operate an international gateway in Afghanistan.  \n \n12. \nInvestcom  is  expected  to  launch  in  Q2  2006,  using  its  existing  Areeba  brand  name.  It \nplans  to  build  a  nationwide  mobile  network  that  will  provide  mobile  services  throughout \nAfghanistan. It has already been announced that Investcom has been provided funding from the \nIFC;  the  project  consists  of  financing  the  license  fee,  network  build-out,  operating  losses  and \nworking  capital  needs  of  Investcom  for  2006\u20132009.  The  total  estimated  project  cost  is  $130 \n\n                                                 \n1  AWCC  was  granted  the  first  operating  license  in  1999.

Today, being \ncut off from basic telecommunications services is a hardship almost as acute as these other \ndeprivations, and may indeed reduce the chances of finding remedies to them.\" \u2013 Kofi Annan, \nUnited Nations Secretary General2 \n\nA. \n\nWhat Is Village Phone? \n\n \n\nVillage  Phone  is  a  methodology  that  creates  a  profitable  partnership  and  a  channel  to \n1. \nmarket to bring telecommunications services to the rural areas of a developing nation. It offers a \nframework  to  extend  telecommunications  service  to  the  rural  poor  in  countries  where  an \ninvestment has already been made in mobile phone infrastructure. Village Phone is based on a \nbusiness model that is sustainable for all of the participants and enables the poorest of the poor \nto have access to valuable communication services. Through this telecommunications service, \nrural individuals can also access information that increases their productivity, earns better prices \nfor their goods, and saves on the direct and opportunity costs of traveling. \n \n2. \nBy  leapfrogging  fixed  infrastructure  and  leveraging  existing  wireless  infrastructure, \nVillage  Phone  offers  a  viable  strategy  for  increasing  teledensity  in  developing  countries  and \nhelping the poor lift themselves out of poverty. \n \nB. \n\nHow Village Phone Works \n\n3. \n Many  rural  villages  have  no  telecommunications  services,  no  public  phone  booths,  no \nprivate  subscriber  fixed  lines,  and  no  individual  who  owns  a  mobile  handset.  People  have  no \noption but to travel to communicate. Studies have shown that there can be a cost to not making \na phone call\u2014up to eight times more expensive than the cost of the actual phone call. The rural \npoor cannot make telephone calls simply because there is no access, not because they cannot \nafford to or don\u2019t wish to. \n \n4. \nThe cost of developing and maintaining infrastructure to install telephones in rural areas \nis often prohibitive. Another barrier is the lack of a mechanism that allows telecommunications \noperators  to  interact  with  their  potential  customers,  selling  airtime  and  making  financial \ntransactions.  \n \nBy  their  very  nature,  microfinance  institutions  (MFIs)  have  deep  roots  in  rural \n5. \ncommunities. They are trusted institutions with detailed knowledge of the local communities and \nan existing infrastructure for regularly visiting these communities to transact financial services. \nThese  deep  community  links  are  essential  for  introducing  new  services  and  the  potential \ncontribution of MFIs to new business initiatives targeting rural communities is often undervalued. \nHere is a  \u201dchannel to market\u201d to bring telecommunications services to the rural poor. \n \n6. \nThe microfinance sector is historically missing from telecommunication operators\u2019 normal \ndistribution chain. By using MFIs as a channel to market, the telecommunications industries in \nBangladesh and Uganda were able to tap a market that was previously inaccessible because of \nthe prohibitively high cost of developing and maintaining a channel to this enormous market. \n \n\n                                                 \n1 Excerpt from Grameen Technology Center. 2005. VillagePhone Replication Manual. Washington, DC. \n2 The US National Commission on Libraries and Information Science speech at Telecom 99 in Geneva, Switzerland, \n\nUN Secretary General Kofi Annan. \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n39 \n\nAs  a  member  of  a  MFI,  a  potential  Village  Phone  operator  uses  a  loan  to  purchase \n7. \neverything needed to start their business. The Village Phone starter kit costs about $200\u2013$250 \nand  includes  a  mobile  phone,  prepaid  airtime  card,  external  Yagi  antenna,  charging  solution, \nsignage,  marketing  collateral,  and  other  materials  necessary  to  get  started.  The  starter  kit  is \ncreated by the Village Phone company, which establishes relationships with MFIs to bring this \nproduct to its customers. The Village Phone Company negotiates wholesale airtime rates from \nthe  telecommunications  provider,  who  provides  access  to  existing  telecommunications \ninfrastructure  for  the  Village  Phone  operators.  Individual  villagers  in  rural  areas  can  then  visit \ntheir local Village Phone operator and make an affordable phone call. \n \n8. \nWith  proceeds  from  the  business,  the  Village  Phone  operator  contributes  to  their  loan \nrepayment and also purchases additional prepaid airtime cards. The MFI earns money from the \nloan and also a percentage of the revenue from airtime sales. The telecommunications provider \nearns  money  through  volume  sales  of  airtime,  and  the  Village  Phone  company  earns  enough \nmoney to continue to promote and expand the program. There are no subsidies in this model. It \nworks because it is designed so that all parties in the partnership \u201cwin\u201d. \n \n\nTable A8: Village Phone Key Characteristics \n\n \nPartner \n\nEssential Service Provided \n\nHow They \u201cWin\u201d \n\nTelecommunications Company \n\nCommunications infrastructure \ncoverage to needed rural areas \n\nMicrofinance Institution \n\nVillage Phone Operator \n\nCommunity Members \n\nVillage Phone Company \n\nSource: GrameenPhone Limited. \n\nProvide  loans  to  village  phone \noperators  so  they  can  purchase \nequipment  to  start    a  village \nphone business \n\nNew revenue generated from \nairtime sales from a previously \ninaccessible market \n\nIncome from loans and airtime \nsales and a new product to \nmarket to clients \n\nAffordable telecommunications to \nmembers of their community \n\nProfitable business which earns \na steady income \n\nCustomer  base  for  village  phone \noperators \n\nAccess to affordable \ntelecommunications \n\nCrafts and manages \nrelationships, facilitates support, \nmanages overall program \n\nLong-term success of program, \nsustainable (profitable) operation \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nINTERNATIONAL ROAMING \n \n\nRoshan  offers  its  roaming  subscribers  services  in  59  countries  worldwide,  on  142 \n\noperator networks.
