It will focus on preservation and development of natural and cultural heritage, and \nincidental  services  linked  to  subprojects  including  municipal  services, 1  tourist  support \ninfrastructure  and  services,  and  tourist  destination  connectivity  infrastructure.  The  proposed \nMFF  is  provided  to  support  the  four  participating  states  of  Himachal  Pradesh,  Punjab,  Tamil \nNadu, and Uttarakhand to develop the tourism sector as a key driver for economic growth. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nIndia  has  experienced  impressive  economic  growth  recently.  Gross  domestic  product \n(GDP)  grew  at  an  average  annual  rate  of  7.7%  during  FY2002\u2013FY2007  and  is  forecast  to \nincrease to 8.7% during the 11th Five-Year Plan (2007\u20132012), making it one of the fast-growing \neconomies in the world.  \n \n4. \nIndia\u2019s economic growth aims at being inclusive. The percentage of the population below \nthe poverty line has declined from 36% in FY1994 to 27.5% in FY2005, but the rate of decline in \npoverty has not kept pace with GDP growth. The rural\u2013urban divide is rapidly rising in India, with \nper  capita  household  expenditure  in  rural  areas  estimated  at  less  than  half  of  that  in  urban \nareas.2 Economic growth across regions has also not been uniform.  \n \n5. \nHowever,  it  is  neither  easy  nor  effective  to  try  to  reduce  the  rural\u2013urban  disparities  by \nstimulating  the  growth  of  the  agriculture  sector  alone.  To  address  the  disparities  more \neffectively,  it  is  important  to  stimulate  the  rural  non-agriculture  sector  and  the  rural  service \nsector as a whole to generate more economic and employment opportunities. \n \n6. \nPotentially, India is one of the attractive tourist destinations in the world and its tourism \nsector  has  been  growing  rapidly.  Total  foreign  tourist  arrivals  have  increased  by  about  126% \nfrom 2.38 million in 2002 to around 5.37 million in 2008 (or 14.6% growth per annum). In 2008, \nabout $11.75 billion was generated in foreign exchange. Total domestic tourist visits have also \ngrown by about 109% from 269.6 million in 2002 to 562.9 million in 2008 (or 13.1% growth per \nannum).3 Virtually  every  kind  of  tourism\u2014cultural,  religious,  eco  and  adventure,  medical,  and \nrelaxation\u2014has  significant  prospects  in  the  country.  The  richly  varied  developed  and \nundeveloped  tourist  attractions  permit  product  differentiation  and  branding.  Rapid  expansion \nand upgrading of the sector\u2019s infrastructure and services to international standards will increase \nits  attractiveness,  efficiency,  and  competitiveness  against  other  international  destinations, 4 \nthereby  creating  significant  opportunities  for  employment  generation  and  growth  in  livelihood \nprograms. \n                                                 \n1   Municipal services includes water supply, sanitation, solid waste management, drainage and flood control. \n2  ADB. 2009. Country Partnership Strategy: India, 2009\u20132012. Manila. \n3  Government of India, Ministry of Tourism. 2009. India Tourism Statistics 2008. Delhi.  \n4  ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance for Improving Connectivity and Destination Management of Cultural and Natural \nResources  in  the  South  Asia  Subregion.  Manila  (TA  6504-REG,  approved  on  8  December  2008).  This  technical \nassistance (TA) looks into this aspect. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n7. \nIn  2002,  the  government  adopted  a  new  policy  that  recognized  tourism  as  one  of  the \nsectors with high potential for growth and employment generation, particularly in less-developed \nareas.  Based  on  2003\u20132004  surveys,  India\u2019s  tourism  sector  contributed  only  5.9%  of  GDP, \nsustaining around 41.8 million people in full-time jobs. However, such a level of contribution to \nGDP by the tourism sector is much lower than the world average of 10.4% in 2007.5 Increased \ninvestments  in  tourism  can,  therefore,  generate  significantly  more  direct  and  indirect \nemployment  because  of  tourism  sector\u2019s  forward  and  backward  linkages,  and  contribute  to \nmitigating the high levels of rural unemployment and poverty, and the rural\u2013urban inequalities. \nThis strategy is reflected in the government\u2019s 11th Five-Year Plan and the Asian Development \nBank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  India  country  partnership  strategy,  2009\u20132012  (footnote  2)  that  supports \ndevelopment  of  required  urban  infrastructure  to  strengthen  the  tourism  potential  of  heritage \ncities in an environmentally sustainable manner. \n \n8. \nTo  this  end,  the  government  committed  to  (i) assisting  the  state  governments  with \ntourism  development;  (ii) encouraging  private  sector  provision  of  tourist  facilities  and  services, \nsupported  by  public  sector  infrastructure  development;  and  (iii) providing  regulatory  support  to \nensure  sustainable  tourism.  A  tourism  sector  road  map  for  the  country,  prepared  with  ADB \ntechnical assistance (TA) support in the context of the government\u2019s 11th Five-Year Plan, sets \ntargets  to  increase  visitor  volumes,  and  their  average  length  of  stay  and  spending,  and \nemphasizes more equitable sharing of tourism benefits with local communities. Under the TA, a \nset of recommendations, which are part of the road map, was also made for capacity building \nand human resource development.6 While the tourism sector\u2019s growth during the 10th Five-Year \nPlan  (2002\u20132007)  period  was  impressive  as  is  mentioned  above,  11th  Five-Year  Plan  targets \nwere  rather  ambitious,  which  included  10  million  total  international  tourist  arrivals  and  812 \nmillion total domestic tourist visits by 2011, and are turning out to be challenging due to, inter \nalia, the global economic slowdown that started in 2008, badly affecting tourism throughout the \nworld. \n \n9. \nPrivate  sector  participation  in  the  tourism  sector  is  a  relatively  recent  phenomenon  in \nIndia. Many states are still in the transition from service providers to promoters and regulators of \ntourism development with increasingly more private sector service providers actively joining the \nindustry.  However,  the  public  sector  still  has  a  significant  role  to  play  in  infrastructure \ndevelopment  if  the  economic  potential  of  tourism  is  to  be  realized.  Inadequate  or  poor \ninfrastructure connecting the gateways from outside the states and connecting tourist attractions \nwithin  each  state,  as  well  as  the  lack  of  basic  services  at  tourist  destinations\u2014such  as  water \nsupply,  sanitation,  and  solid  waste  management\u2014need  to  be  addressed.  Infrastructure  to \nsupport community-based tourism is almost absent. \n \n10. \nThe  investment  program  will  assist  the  government  in  achieving  its  targets  by  tapping \nthe tourism sector\u2019s potential to contribute to sustainable and inclusive economic growth. It will \nrespond to the urgent need for developing tourism-related infrastructure in the four participating \nstates\u2014Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, and Uttarakhand (the three main states of the North West \nHimalayan Heritage Circuit), and Tamil Nadu (the anchor state of the South Heritage Circuit)\u2014\nto  promote  the  economic  potential  of  the  tourism  sector  within  a  planned  framework  and \naddress  weaknesses  in  management  capacity.  These  four  states  voluntarily  sought  to \nparticipate  in  the  implementation  of  the  road  map,  and  the  government  supported  their \n\n                                                 \n5  World Travel and Tourism Council http://www.wttc.org/eng/Home/ \n6  ADB.  2007.

The  government  prepared  a  more  specific  road  map  along  with  a  framework  for \nnecessary  policy  and  sector  reforms  for  each  of  the  four  states  under  follow-up  ADB \nassistance,7 and  proposed  the  MFF  modality  to  support  the  government\u2019s  medium-  and  long-\nterm goals. \n \n11.  While  infrastructure  supporting  tourism  is  being  put  in  place,  sector  reform  must  be \ncarried  out  in  parallel  to  attain  the  goals  of  more  sustainable  and  inclusive  tourism  sector \ndevelopment. Key challenges include existing limitations in (i) public sector financing; (ii) sector \npolicies on, and institutional capacities for, heritage site management; (iii) an effective enabling \nenvironment  for  enhanced  private  sector  participation;  (iv)  operation  and  maintenance  of \ntourism infrastructure; and (v) effective mechanisms to engage local communities in the tourism \nvalue chain. Detailed discussions about the national tourism development road map and tourism \nroad maps of the four participating states can be found in the framework financing agreement \n(FFA).8 \n \n12. \nThe  investment  program  includes  a  number  of  policy-driven  sector  reforms.  The \nparticipating states are committed to making investments in the tourism sector more attractive \nfor  private  sector  participation.  They  will  also  promote  homestay  programs  and  other \nnoncommercial  or  semicommercial  lodging  alternatives,  such  as  bed  and  breakfast  facilities. \nEach  state  will  develop  a  tourism  policy  to  mainstream  (i) balanced  distribution  of  economic \nopportunities  across  the  state  through  the  promotion  of  community-based,  tourism-related \neconomic  and  livelihood  activities,  and  ecotourism  development;  (ii) financial  sustainability  of \ntourism  destinations  and  their  heritage  assets,  and  connectivity  infrastructure;  and  (iii) policy \nand regulatory reforms to provide for adaptive reuse of publicly owned heritage buildings so that \nadditional means of cost recovery are established. \n \n13. \n The  MFF  modality  is  considered  suitable  for  the  proposed  intervention  because \ndeveloping  the  capacities  of  the  sector  agencies  as  facilitators  and  regulators  of  tourism \ndevelopment will be a gradual process requiring longer-term commitments. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  investment  program  will  enhance  the  contribution  of  the  tourism  sector  to \n14. \nsustainable  and  inclusive  economic  growth  during  its  10-year  implementation  period.  The \nimpact  can  be  assessed  by  a  50%  increase  in  local  employment  created  by  tourism  and \neconomic  activities  linked  to  tourism  in  each  participating  state,  and  a  30%  increase  in  the \naggregate  contribution  of  tourism  to  the  GDP  of  each  participating  state.  The  outcome  will  be \nincreased  volume  of  domestic  and  international  tourists.  More  private  sector  investments  in \ntourism and enhancement of destinations and attractions are also expected.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n15. \nThe investment program outputs will be (i) improved basic urban infrastructure (such as \nwater supply, sanitation, road and public transport, solid waste management, and environmental \nimprovement)  and  incidental  services  (such  as  public  toilets,  street  signage  and  lighting)  at \nexisting  and  emerging  tourist  destinations  and  gateways;  (ii) improved  connectivity  to  tourist \n\n                                                 \n7  ADB.  2007.

To complete phase 2, which \nfocuses  on  implementation  capacity  development  support  to  the  participating  states,  the  completion  date  was \nextended to 31 August 2011. \n\n8  Framework Financing Agreement (Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nattractions focusing on the improvement of last-mile connectivity; (iii) enhanced quality of natural \nand  cultural  tourist  attractions  to  ensure  convenience  and  safety  for  visitors;  (iv) greater \nparticipation  by  local  communities  in  tourism-related  economic  and  livelihood  activities;  and \n(v) strengthened  capacity  of  concerned  sector  agencies  and  local  communities  for  planning, \ndevelopment, management, and marketing of tourist destinations and attractions, and promoting \nprivate sector participation and small businesses. \n \n16. \nSupporting programs will be established for developing the capacities to promote private \nsector participation and small businesses to increase the benefits they gain from tourism, and \nstimulating  more  active  tourism-related  economic  and  livelihood  activities.  Consultancy  will \nsupport project implementation and programs for developing the capacities of sector agencies \nfor sustainable management of tourism and related infrastructure and services. Two batches of \nsubprojects  are  anticipated  from  each  participating  state,  which  the  government  will  then \nconsolidate, if applicable, and forward to ADB in the form of periodic financing requests (PFRs). \nThe  selection  criteria  set  out  in  the  FFA  apply  to  the  subprojects  to  be  financed  under  the \nsecond tranche onwards and the subprojects under tranche 1 have substantially followed these \ncriteria.  The  first  PFR  covering  the  respective  first  batches  of  two  participating  states  with \nadvanced project readiness (i.e., Himachal Pradesh and Punjab) is processed together with the \nMFF. Five PFRs (including the first one) are anticipated under the investment program. \n \nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n17. \nThe  road  map  covering  the  four  participating  states  during  2011\u20132020,  which  is \nidentified as priority investment, is estimated to cost $1.69 billion,9 of which $357.14 million will \nbe financed under the investment program (Table 1). \n \n\nItemb \nA.

There is an option to make this long-\nterm  engagement  possible.  Under  this  option,  each  contract  covers  the  entire  implementation  period  of  the \ninvestment program from 2011 to 2020. The initial loan will cover the consulting service contracts partially while the \nsubsequent loan will cover the remaining balances of the contracts. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n21. \nState-level  empowered  committee. Each state government will establish a state-level \nempowered  committee,  chaired  by  the  state\u2019s chief  secretary  and  comprising  secretaries  from \nline agencies, to take all decisions on behalf of the state and will (i) act as a policy making body; \n(ii) provide  overall  advice  and  guidance  to  the  state\u2019s  executing  agency  and  project \nmanagement unit (PMU); and (iii) accord all approvals under the investment program. \n \nExecuting  agency.  The  Department  of  Tourism  of  each  state  will  be  the  executing \n22. \nagency. All necessary powers to: (i) assume overall responsibility for the execution of the MFF; \n(ii) engage adequate permanent and fixed-term staff to implement the MFF; (iii) set up a state-\nlevel  project  management  unit  (PMU)  and  project  implementation  units  (PIUs);  (iv) provide \noverall  strategic  guidance  on  the  implementation  of  the  road  map;  and  (v) ensure  compliance \nwith the loan covenants and undertakings set forth in the FFA will be delegated to the respective \nexecuting agencies. \n \n23. \nstate will be the implementing agency. \n \n24. \nEach  PMU  will  be  headed  by  a  full-time  project  director  and  will  consist  of  personnel \ndeputed from state government departments and recruited from the market. Each PMU will also \nbe  supported  by  a  team  of  consultants.  PMU  will  be  the  nodal  agency  for  the  overall \nmanagement of all activities under the investment program and will be responsible for: (i) project \nplanning and budgeting; (ii) provision of day-to-day assistance, supervision and guidance for the \nPIUs  and  their  consultants;  (iii) review  of  subprojects\u2019  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  due  diligence \nrequirements  and  approval  of  subproject  proposals  submitted  by  PIUs  and  state  government \ndepartments; (iv) bidding, evaluation and contract award; (v) management and disbursement of \n\nImplementing  agency.

PIUs  will  mainly  consist  of  engineers  and  experts \ndeputed from state government departments. A team of design and supervision consultants will \nbe engaged by the executing agency concerned for each PIU to strengthen its capacity. PIUs \nwill  be  responsible  for:  (i) prioritizing  and  preparing  subproject  proposals;  (ii) providing  day-to-\nday  assistance,  supervision  and  guidance  for  the  design  and  supervision  consultants; \n(iii) conducting  detailed  assessments  and  surveys  including  public  consultation  and  input  from \nstakeholders;  (iv) preparing  detailed  designs,  specifications,  schedule  of  quantity,  bidding \ndocuments,  and  related  documentation;  (v) implementing  civil  works  and  related  activities; \n(vi) reporting  to  PMU;  (vii) preparing  regular  progress  reports  for  the  state-level  empowered \ncommittee,  the  executing  agency  and  ADB  through  PMU;  (viii) supervising  construction, \nconducting  quality  control,  approving  progress  payments  to  contractors;  and  (ix) maintaining \nrecords and accounts on an up-to-date basis and making these available to ADB for inspection. \n \n26. \nPhase  2  of  the  technical  assistance  for  Preparing  the  Inclusive  Tourism  Infrastructure \nDevelopment  Project,  which  focuses  on  implementation  capacity  development  support  to  the \nparticipating states, will cover the initial start-up period of the proposed investment program until \n31  August  2011  (footnote  7).  In  addition  to  the  usual  project  administration  support,  the \nconsultants  will  assist  the  PMUs  and  PIUs  in  the  formulation  of  (i) mobility  plans;  (ii) possible \npublic\u2013private  partnership  schemes;  and  (iii) community  participation  and  capacity  building \nschemes, including promotion schemes for homestay programs and bed and breakfast facilities, \nand training for community-based tourism activities, while letting the staff, private sector parties, \nand communities be exposed to international best practices. Loan-funded consultants will then \ntake  over  the  task  of  implementation  support  and  capacity  building  for  the  PMUs  and  PIUs. \nADB\u2019s  India  Resident  Mission  will  also  provide  strong  project  administration  support,  in \nparticular during the initial start-up period. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\n \nA. \n \nSupport  with  respect  to  planning  exercises  would  be  necessary,  particularly  in \n27. \naddressing  key \nissues  such  as  (i) peak-period  visitor  safety  concerns;  (ii) greenfield \ndevelopment  at  prospective  tourist  destinations,  focusing  on  proper  planning  and  regulations; \nand (iii) mobility and public transport planning in congested areas or mountainous terrain where \nthe  scope  of  physical  infrastructure  improvements  is  limited,  in  particular  focusing  on  possible \nadoption of innovative new solutions (i.e., the use of information technology, etc.). In addition, \npublic\u2013private partnership contract packaging will be explored in consideration of particular local \nconditions, market conditions, and the level of interest by potential bidders. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nThe economic analysis has reviewed11 the following aspects of the investment program: \n28. \n(i) the economic rationale for government intervention, (ii) goals, (iii) sector development plans, \n                                                 \n11 Analysis on the investment program was carried out in accordance with D. Dole. 2005. Assessing Aid for a Sector \n\nDevelopment Plan: Economic Analysis of a Sector Loan. ERD Technical Note. No. 14. Manila: ADB. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n(iv) associated economic policies, (v) economic risks, (vi) each state government\u2019s capacity, (vii) \nfiscal impact, (viii) each state government\u2019s commitment, (ix) coordination of foreign aid, and (x) \nconditions attached to the loan. The economic rationale for government intervention is justified, \nsince  the  investment  program  supports  basic  public  services  characterized  by  monopolistic \nconditions, externality management, and impacts on income distribution. \n \n29. \nIn  principle,  the  participating  states  will  ensure  that  admission  and  user  fees  of  tourist \nfacilities  created  or  rehabilitated  under  the  investment  program  are  set  at  levels  sufficient  to \nmake  their  operation  financially  sustainable.  Some  participating  states  intend  to  levy  user \ncharges on certain subprojects, such as adaptive reuse of publicly owned heritage buildings for \ncommercial  purposes.  However,  most  subprojects  either  cannot  earn  sufficient  revenues  or \ndirectly generate revenues. The participating states will, therefore, ensure that adequate funds \nare  provided  to  meet  any  shortfall  between  the  costs  and  revenues  for  the  operation  and \nmaintenance  of  those  tourist  facilities.  Most  of  the  proposed  subprojects  in  Himachal  Pradesh \nand  Punjab  under  the  first  PFR  are  not  revenue  earning,  but  the  forecast  increases  in  tourist \nvisits and incremental tourist spending from longer length of stay will generate higher sales tax \nrevenues.  The  additional  budgetary  requirements  created  by  the  subprojects  will  not  be  a \nsignificant burden for those states, considering their revenue surplus since FY2009. \n \n30. \nThe  proposed  subprojects  in  Himachal  Pradesh  and  Punjab  under  the  first  PFR \ngenerate  economic  benefits  in  the  form  of  additional  tourist  spending  from  the  increases  in \ntourist volumes and length of stay, and increased revenues from sales taxes due to additional \ninternational tourist spending. Other quantifiable and unquantifiable economic benefits are also \nexpected in the form of enhanced environmental quality and improved access (less travel time \nand vehicle operating costs). Based on the estimated economic benefits, the economic internal \nrates  of  return  for  the  subprojects  under  the  first  PFR  were  estimated  at  14.1%  for  Himachal \nPradesh and 22.3% for Punjab.   \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nin \n\nthe \n\nimplementing  agencies  of  each  state,  which \n\n31. \nThere  is  a  need  to  strengthen  the  financial  management  and  overall  project \nimplementation capacities of the executing agencies and implementing agencies. The financial \nmanagement assessment of the investment program showed that there were common financial \nmanagement  challenges \ninclude \n(i) procedures for internal audit; (ii) cash-basis accounting; and (iii) computerization of financial \nmanagement  processes.  As  part  of  the  project  management  consultancy,  financial  specialists \nhave  been  included  to  assist  in  (i) strengthening  internal  audit  procedures;  (ii) studying  the \nadoption  of  accrual-basis  (if  applicable,  double-entry)  accounting,  and  (iii) computerizing  the \nproject accounting system. Further strengthening of the overall governance will also be explored \nby  facilitating  sound  partnership  arrangements  among  sector  agencies,  local  business \ncommunities, and local civil societies. These will be addressed during the proposed investment \nprogram through the capacity building programs for sector agencies. \n \n32. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the Department of Tourism of each state. Specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the facility administration manual. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n33. \nThe  poverty  and  social  assessment  conducted  during  investment  program  preparation \nindicates that poor and marginalized people require skills training and credit for tourism-based \n\n\f9 \n\nthat  support \n\nlivelihood development. The investment program design, therefore, proposes tourist destination \nenhancement  with  community  participatory  activities \nlocal \nentrepreneurship  to  channel  economic  benefits  directly  to  the  surrounding  communities.  Poor \npeople  in  these  communities  will,  therefore,  benefit  from  the  prospective  interventions  through \nexpanded  tourism-related  business  opportunities,  generation  of  new  employment,  improved \nliving conditions for the local populations, and an increased stake in the management of natural \nand cultural tourism resources. A participation plan under the investment program will facilitate \nsuch  local  efforts.  The  gender  analysis  conducted  during  investment  program  preparation \nindicates  that  the  sector  can  provide  opportunities  for  women  to  participate  at  all  levels.  A \ngender action plan was prepared to ensure inclusive social impacts. \n \nE. \n\ntraining  and \n\nSafeguards \n\ntwo \n\nEnvironment.  Project  1 \n\nis  classified  environmental  category  B  and \n\n34. \ninitial \nenvironmental examinations with environmental management plans were prepared in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The initial environmental examinations conclude \nthat  no  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  are  anticipated,  and  any  impacts  during  the \ndesign  and  construction  stages  are  readily  addressed  through  mitigation  measures.  Key \nenvironmental  benefits  include  improved  on-site  and  off-site  hygiene  and  sanitary  conditions  at \ntourist  destinations,  and  enhanced  conservation  through  alternative  livelihood  opportunities  in \necotourism and increased environmental awareness. All subprojects are consistent with approved \nenvironmental  management  plans  (which  aim  to  conserve  natural  tourist  attractions)  and  with \ngovernment environmental regulations. An environmental assessment and review framework was \nprepared to guide environmental assessment in subsequent loans to ensure there are no adverse \nimpacts. \n \n35. \nSocial.  Project  1  is  classified  involuntary  resettlement  category  C  and  indigenous \npeoples  category  C.  Subprojects  under  project  1  do  not  result  in  any  physical  or  economic \ndisplacement  due  to  involuntary  acquisition  of  land,  or  involuntary  restrictions  on  land  use,  or \nmore  specifically  access  to  the  Pong  or  Keshopur  sanctuaries.  All  land  parcels  required  for \nthese  subprojects  are  owned  by  the  respective  state  governments  or  implementing  agencies. \nThere  are  no  indigenous  peoples  in  the  subproject  areas  under  project  1.  Because  no \ninvoluntary resettlement or impact on indigenous peoples is expected under these subprojects, \nno social safeguards planning documents have been prepared. A resettlement framework and \nan  indigenous  peoples  planning  framework  have  been  prepared  for  future  loans,  which  detail \nscreening  and  categorization,  assessment,  planning,  and  institutional  arrangements  and \nprocesses  to  be  followed.12 Implementation  arrangements  ensure  that  PMUs  and  PIUs  have \nadequate capacity to manage social impacts through consultant support and capacity building. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n36.
