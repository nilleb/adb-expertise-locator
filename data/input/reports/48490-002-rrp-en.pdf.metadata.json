It builds on ongoing technical assistance (TA) projects from the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) and other development partners, and supports the government\u2019s efforts to promote private \nsector-led  economic  growth  through  improvements  in  fiscal  management,  in  particular  public \nfinancial  management  (PFM);  the  policy,  legal,  and  institutional  framework  for  state-owned \nenterprises  (SOEs)  and  public\u2013private  partnerships  (PPPs);  and  the  business  and  investment \nclimate.2 The programmatic approach, with three subprograms in 2018, 2019, and 2020, will allow \nchronological sequencing of complex and politically sensitive reforms. \n \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nDevelopment  context.  Fiji  is  a  small  Pacific  island  nation  with  a  population  of  about \n885,000  people.  It  has  a  total  land  area  of  18,273  square  kilometers  covering  332  islands,  of \nwhich  only  110  are  inhabited.  Major  markets  such  as  New  Zealand  and  Australia  are                \n2,000\u20133,000 kilometers away. Like other Pacific islands, Fiji is vulnerable to disasters triggered \nby natural hazards, including cyclones and floods. These constraints have contributed to low and \nvolatile real growth in gross domestic product (GDP), averaging 2.9% during 1970\u20132015. \n \n4. \nRecent economic performance. Economic growth has picked up, averaging about 3.5% \nper year during 2010\u20132015. This is more than two times the annual growth during 2000\u20132009. \nEconomic revival since 2010 has been supported by accommodative fiscal and monetary policies, \nincluding tax cuts, low interest rates, and increased public investment. Capital expenditure, for \nexample, increased from 5.6% of GDP in 2010 to 9.7% of GDP in 2015, and spending on social \nservices and social protection programs also went up.  Growth fell to 0.4% in 2016 when Tropical \nCyclone  Winston  resulted  in  estimated  losses  of  29.2%  of  GDP.  Following  post-cyclone \nreconstruction efforts and large public infrastructure investments, the government estimated the \ngrowth to have recovered to 3.9% in 2017. In addition, revenue measures to eliminate dividend \ntaxes and raise the minimum  income tax  threshold  have had a positive impact  on  investment, \nconsumption,  and  value-added tax  receipts.  The  growth forecast  of  3.6%  in  2018  is  based  on \nexpectations of continued fiscal expansion to support reconstruction. \n \n5. \nFiji\u2019s small size, remoteness, and susceptibility to natural disasters has led to a high-cost \nbusiness environment that discourages the private sector, particularly those outside the tourism \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.

The  profitability  of  Fiji\u2019s  SOEs  has  also  increased  since  2010,  but  SOE \nproductivity  remains  low,  with  Fiji\u2019s  18  SOEs  contributing  only  4.0%  to  GDP  in  2014  while \ncontrolling an estimated 12%\u201317% of total fixed assets in the economy.5 Opening this space to \nthe private sector offers considerable potential gains. \n\n \n6. \nFiscal situation. Reliance on the public sector to drive growth has led to the net fiscal \ndeficit  averaging  about  2.4%  of  GDP  from  FY2010  to  FY2017  (Table  1).  In  FY2018,  public \nexpenditure is estimated at 35.3% of GDP, with a net fiscal deficit of 3.5% financed by external \nand domestic borrowings and asset sales.6 While the government has room to take on additional \nborrowing, public debt (estimated at 45.5% of GDP in FY2017) is close to the government\u2019s ceiling \nof 50% of GDP and the government recognizes the need for fiscal room in the event of external \nshocks such as natural disasters. With projected deficits of 3.0% of GDP in FY2019 and FY2020, \ndebt is expected to reach 47.9% in FY2020. Domestic financing of the deficit will crowd out private \ninvestments. Given the limited fiscal space, and the need to build fiscal buffers to ensure adequate \nresources for disaster response, the government needs to manage fiscal consolidation carefully \nagainst its impact on public investment levels and economic growth.  \n \n\nTable 1: Selected Economic and Fiscal Indicators \n(% of GDP unless otherwise indicated) \nFY2016 \n0.4 \n\nFY2017  FY2018p  FY2019p \n3.6 \n\nFY2014 \n5.6 \n\nFY2015 \n3.8 \n\n3.3 \n\nFY2020p \n2.9 \n\n0.5 \n\n1.4 \n\n3.9 \n\n3.0 \n\n3.0 \n\nItem \nReal GDP Growth  \n(% change) \nChange in CPI  \n(% change, end period) \n \nCentral Government \nBudget \n\nTotal revenue \nTotal expenditure \n\nOperating Balance \nAsset Sales \nNet Fiscal Deficit \n \nPublic Debt \n\nExternal debt \n\n \nNominal GDP ($ million) \n\n \n \n\n27.2 \n31.6 \n9.8 \n0.2 \n(4.2) \n \n49.4 \n15.9 \n \n4,463 \n\n \n \n\n26.0 \n29.8 \n8.8 \n0.1 \n(3.8) \n \n48.2 \n15.0 \n \n4,386 \n\n \n \n\n27.9 \n33.4 \n10.2 \n2.0 \n(3.5) \n \n48.4 \n12.9 \n \n4,682 \n\n3.9 \n \n3.3 \n\n \n \n\n27.7 \n29.1 \n10.7 \n0.1 \n(2.2) \n \n45.5 \n14.0 \n \n4,942 \n\n \n \n\n31.8 \n35.3 \n12.3 \n0.0 \n(3.5) \n \n47.5 \n13.9 \n \n5,269 \n\n \n \n\n29.5 \n32.5 \n11.7 \n0.0 \n(3.0) \n \n47.6 \n13.9 \n \n5,602 \n\n3.0 \n\n \n \n\n28.4 \n31.4 \n11.7 \n0.0 \n(3.0) \n \n47.9 \n14.0 \n \n5,930 \n\n( ) = negative, CPI = consumer price index, FY = financial year, GDP = gross domestic product, p = projection \nSource: Government of Fiji and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \nMacroeconomic challenges. The key macroeconomic challenge Fiji faces is to increase \n7. \nprivate  investment  and  reduce  reliance  on  public  investment  to  drive  economic  growth. \nAddressing this challenge  will  enable faster  and more  broad-based growth,  while ensuring the \ngovernment  has  sufficient  fiscal  room  to  respond  to  shocks  with  fewer  debt-financed  public \n                                                \n3   ADB. 2015.

The planned fiscal deficit in FY2017 was equivalent to 4.7% of GDP when the actual deficit was 2.2%. \n\nManila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fPolicy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n\ninvestments. The government  acknowledges that  it  needs  more private  investment  to meet  its \nlong-term growth target of 5%, which is estimated to require an investment\u2013GDP ratio of 25%.7 \nIn 2018, the International Monetary Fund advised the government that sustaining high growth will \nrequire  continuity  in  structural  reforms  that  lower  the  cost  of  doing  business  and  improve  the \noverall business climate.8 \n \n8. \nPast  ADB  engagement.  ADB\u2019s  past  engagement  in  public  sector  management  and \nprivate  sector  development  has  been  mainly  through  regional  TA  facilities  that  have  provided \nsupport  for  PFM,  SOE  reform,  and  business  climate  reform.9 Lessons  from  a  review  of  ADB\u2019s \nengagement  in  these  areas  during  2006\u20132013  include  (i)  identifying  champions  to  strengthen \nreform  commitment  and  lead  implementation,  particularly  for  SOE  reform  and  divestment;  (ii) \nobtaining endorsement so that reforms are not derailed if the leadership changes; (iii) pursuing \nmoderate, stepwise reforms in sequence, especially where institutional capacity is limited; and \n(iv) providing sufficient time to develop capacity and institutionalize reforms. 10 \n \nB. \n \n9. \nGovernment strategy. The government\u2019s National Development Plan, 2017\u20132036 (NDP) \nsets  out  a  vision  for  inclusive  socio-economic  development  through  a  strategy  to  become  a \nregional  hub of  the  South Pacific for  business, transport,  communications,  and  other  services; \nand sets out a goal of a four-fold increase per capita income by 2036.11 To achieve this goal, the \ngovernment recognizes the need for greater private investment and participation by accelerating \nstructural reforms over the medium term. \n \nStructural  reform  program.  Since  2007,  the  government  has  introduced  a  number  of \n10. \nsubstantive  and  progressive  structural  reforms  with  the  objective  of  improving  the  business \nenvironment  and  opportunities  for  private  sector-driven  growth.  Areas  of  focus  have  included \ntaxation,  telecommunications  market  liberalization,  introducing  competition  to  the  land  lease \nprocess,  and  strengthening  infrastructure  services.  With  support  from  ADB  and  other \ndevelopment partners, the government is accelerating its efforts to increase private investment. \nReform areas in the NDP prioritized for implementation are (i) fiscal management, in particular \nPFM; (ii) the policy, legal, and institutional framework for SOEs and PPPs; and (iii) the business \nand investment climate.12 The NDP, the product of consultations with private sector associations \nand civil society groups, provides the basis for policy dialogue and TA coordination between the \ngovernment, ADB, and other development partners such as the World Bank, the Government of \nAustralia, and the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC).  \n \n11. \nAssistance modality. The government has requested a programmatic policy-based loan \nseries with three subprograms (in 2018, 2019, and 2020) to support the implementation of the \nNDP. The government, ADB, and the World Bank have agreed to substantive policy actions that \nrequire sufficient time for preparation and constituency building to garner political support. The \nsequencing of reforms over three subprograms will accommodate the need for deficit financing \nfor FY2018 and match further program financing to anticipated budget needs, while allowing time \nfor  effective  and  sustained  implementation.  A  programmatic  approach  allows  for  prioritization \n                                                \n7   Macroeconomic Analysis: Summary (accessible from the list of supplementary documents in Appendix 2).   \n8   International  Monetary  Fund.  2018.

The  program  will  help  the  government  achieve  its  objective  of  inclusive \nsocioeconomic development (para. 9). It fully aligns with the government\u2019s policy priorities set out \nin the  national  budget  documents  and the  NDP.  The  program  is  consistent  with ADB\u2019s  Pacific \nApproach, 2016\u20132019 and its focus on reducing the costs of doing business, managing risks from \nnatural and economic shocks, and enabling value creation by supporting private sector growth.13  \n\n \n13. \nPolicy  actions.  The  implementation  of  the  government\u2019s  structural  reform  agenda \nunderpins the provision of policy-based lending from ADB and the World Bank.14 Under subprogram \n1,  ADB  supports  14  policy  actions  across  three  reform  areas  contained  in  the  program  policy \nmatrix and described in paras. 14-19. The government has completed all 14 actions. Additionally, \n21 indicative triggers are shown for subprogram 2 and 17 for subprogram 3, which will be refined \nbased on government priorities and capacity in the coming years. Subprogram 1 actions provide \nthe policy direction for subsequent reform implementation in subprograms 2 and 3, ensuring that \nthe formal policy underpinnings required are provided and that reforms are credible, consistent, \nand predictable.  \n \n14. \nFiscal management. The government recognizes that achieving a sound fiscal position \nrequires sound PFM systems and processes that promote fiscal discipline, strategic allocation of \nresources,  and  efficient  service  delivery.  Sound  PFM  provides  the  private  sector  with  policy \ncertainty  and  business  confidence,  particularly  regarding  public  procurement  and  public  sector \ncontracts. The policy actions supported under subprogram 1 include:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nPublic  financial  management  framework.  The  cabinet  has  approved  a  Public \nFinancial Management Improvement Programme (PFMIP), 2016\u20132019 to address \nweaknesses  identified \nthrough  a  2013  Public  Expenditure  and  Financial \nAccountability assessment. The PFMIP, which includes sequenced and prioritized \nactions  to  improve  PFM  systems  and  processes,  will  allow  greater  coordination \nwithin the government, and with development partners and technical agencies.15 A \nPublic Expenditure and Financial Accountability self-assessment, planned for 2018, \nwill provide the basis for measuring reform progress. \nBudget  transparency  and  accountability.  The  government  disclosed  to  the \npublic  budget  kits  that  highlight  FY2018  expenditure  programs  by  sector  and \nministry  to  raise  awareness.  The  Ministry  of  Economy  (MOE)  has  published \nquarterly budget in-year reports on its website to improve monitoring of policy and \nproject implementation. This information is important for private firms that engage \nwith the government regularly through the supply of goods and services. Audited \nfinancial statements for the whole-of-government, that is, Government ministries, \nagencies and departments, were brought up to date following the change in fiscal \nyear,  and  these,  together  with  the  annual  appropriation  statement,  have  been \n\n                                                \n13   ADB. 2016. Pacific Approach, 2016\u20132020. Manila. \n14   The NDP forms the basis for reforms contained in the program policy matrix (Appendix 4). The World Bank policy \nmatrix  for  its  parallel  program  contains  five  prior  actions,  of  which  two  are  shared.  These  two  actions  cover \nparliamentary approval of the International Arbitration Act, 2017 and the Regulation of Building Permits Act, 2017. \n15   The government, through the PFMIP, acknowledges that a strong PFM system is vital to macroeconomic stability. \nThe  PFMIP  outlines  a  time-bound  action  plan  to  implement  critical  and  ambitious  PFM  reforms.  Recent  PFM \nimprovements include (i) the introduction of pay-as-you-earn as a final tax and value-added tax self-assessment; \n(ii) the inclusion of performance management in budget documents at the program and activity level and tracking \nof the implications of new policy decisions; and (iii) the submission of annual procurement plans and their publication \non the Ministry of Economy (MOE) website. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fpublished  on  the  website  of  the  Parliament  of  the  Republic  of  Fiji.16 Work  has \ncommenced  to  assess  the  ability  of  the  MOE  to  formulate  and  implement  a \nmedium-term expenditure framework, which will highlight the government\u2019s public \ninvestment priorities and provide private firms with clear indication of opportunities \nfor future public sector contracts. The Civil Service Reform Management Unit17 has \nprepared  a  planning  framework  for  the  government  that  allows  devolution  of  a \nrange  of  functions  from  central  agencies  to  line  ministries,  to  better  align  their \nservice delivery, staffing, and corporate planning requirements. Reform progress \nwill be measured through Fiji\u2019s participation in the biennial Open Budget Survey.18 \nDebt management. The government is implementing a rolling debt management \nstrategy and adjusting it as appropriate to the government\u2019s annual financing needs \nwhile  minimizing  financing  costs.  Sound  risk  management  strategies  that  the \ngovernment  is  implementing  include  maintaining  low  and  stable  debt  servicing \ncosts  bearing  in  mind  risks  associated  with  foreign  exchange  fluctuations,  and \nmaintaining a stable and affordable debt maturity structure to reduce the burden of \nresettlement  and  minimize  exposure.  The  strategy  is  a  key  piece  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s  medium-term  debt  policy,  which  focuses  on  achieving  debt \nsustainability  by  reducing  fiscal  deficits  and  adopting  sound  risk  management \nstrategies (footnote 4). The strategy is also an important tool for private firms that \nsupply government agencies with goods and services. \nFinancial  management.  To  improve  the  integrity  of  its  payments  system,  and \nmake transactions smoother and more efficient,  including for private businesses \nthat supply the government with goods and services, the government has joined \nthe  United  Nations  Better  Than  Cash  Alliance  and  has  committed  to  increased \ndigitization and use of electronic payments.19  \n \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n15. \nSubprograms 2 and 3 will build on these reforms through cabinet approval of a revised \nfinancial management bill, which will strengthen accountability and clarify the financial authority \nof permanent secretaries, a key first step toward the devolution of decision-making authority. The \ngovernment will undertake public expenditure reviews that will help evaluate the effectiveness of \npublic expenditure,  consistency  with  policy  priorities,  and  results  achieved  and  develop  and \nimplement  the  medium-term  expenditure  framework.  The  planning  framework  prepared  by  the \nCivil Service Reform Management Unit will be pilot tested in at least two ministries before being \nrolled out to the rest of the government. The MOE will review its current financial management \ninformation system and commence implementation of the recommendations. The government will \ncontinue  to  implement  electronic  payments  through  digital  platforms.  ADB  TA  is  available  to \nsupport  several  of  these  reforms.20 Other  development  partners,  including  the  Government  of \nAustralia, the World Bank, and PFTAC, will also provide support. \n16. \nPolicy, legal, and institutional framework for state-owned enterprises and public\u2013\nprivate  partnerships.  Although  the  profitability  of  Fiji\u2019s  SOE  portfolio  has  improved  markedly \n\n                                                \n16   In March 2016, the government announced that from August 2016 it would change the fiscal year from a calendar \n\nyear to one beginning on 1 August and ending on 31 July. \n\n17   The Civil Service Reform Management Unit was set up within MOE to increase the efficiency, professionalism, and \n\naccountability of the Fijian public service.  \n\n18   Fiji\u2019s  performance  can  be  measured  through  the  biennial  Open  Budget  Survey  (http://news.ccf.org.fj/fijis-open-\nbudget-survey-results/). In 2017, Fiji ranked 41 out of 100 countries in terms of budget transparency, and 15th for \nboth public participation in the preparation of the budget and oversight of the budget by Supreme Audit Institutions.  \n19   The government continues to implement a strategic shift from cash and other paper-based medium of exchange to \n\nelectronic payment forms, such as for social welfare and land lease payments. \n\n20   ADB.  2017.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Republic  of  Fiji  for  Supporting  Public  Financial  Management  Reform. \n\nManila. \n\n \n\n5 \n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nsince  2010,  productivity  remains  low  and  the  government  seeks  to  improve  the  sector\u2019s \nperformance  (para.  5). 21  The  government  has  launched  a  program  of  SOE  divestment, \noutsourcing,  and  PPPs  to  bring  in  new  private  sector  investment,  innovation,  and  expertise. \nHowever,  progress  has  been  hindered  by  a  lack  of  consistent  and  predictable  policies  and \nprocesses.  With  ADB  support,  the  Ministry  of  Public  Enterprises  (MPE)  has  progressively \nimplemented the following subprogram 1 policy actions to address these issues (footnote 9). \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nState-owned enterprises reform. To progress of divestment of SOEs, the cabinet \nhas approved privatization guidelines to establish clear and transparent rules and \nprocedures for preparing and executing SOE divestments. These  guidelines are \nexpected to lead to more efficient transaction processes and will be published to \nencourage investor confidence. The MPE is progressing several SOE transactions.  \nPublic\u2013private partnerships reforms. The cabinet has approved a PPP policy, \nwhich allocates lead responsibility for PPPs to the MPE and establishes a robust \nprocess for the undertaking of PPPs by Fijian government agencies.22 The policy \nwill facilitate future foreign and domestic private investment in infrastructure and \npublic  service  delivery  in  Fiji.  The  government  has  appointed  the  International \nFinance Corporation as a transaction advisor for a PPP transaction for the Ba and \nLautoka hospitals, to attract both foreign direct investment and expertise. \n\n \n17. \nSubprograms  2  and  3  will  seek  cabinet  approval  to  table  a  public  enterprise  bill  in \nParliament to replace the Public Enterprise Act, 1996, which is outdated and no longer reflects \ninternational good practice. The bill, when enacted, will establish a clear framework to strengthen \nSOE  governance,  transparency,  and  accountability  and  to  improve  performance  and  service \ndelivery. Training programs for 75% of directors and 75% of senior management of SOEs on the \ncompliance requirements of the Public Enterprise Act will be conducted by MPE.23 To strengthen \nfinancial oversight and monitoring of SOEs, the government will develop and implement a new \nfiscal risk assessment framework, as well as a new policy framework for government guarantees \nand a new policy framework for onlending, support the reform of at least two SOEs, which may \ninclude a corporatization, partial privatization, divestment, liquidation, or substantial restructuring; \nor  formation  of  a  PPP,  develop  PPP  implementation  guidelines,  including  on  the  PPP \nprocurement  process  and  appoint  transaction  advisors  to  support  potential  PPP  transactions. \nADB will continue to support these actions (footnote 9).  \n \n18. \nBusiness and investment climate. Foreign direct investment in Fiji is rising, averaging \n7.3% of GDP during 2012\u20132016. However, this is lower than hoped and inadequate to support \ntarget rates of economic growth (footnote 3). This reflects a weak investment climate affected by \npolitical instability and policy uncertainty, delays in addressing underlying structural constraints, \nand gaps in the commercial legal framework. Since 2006, the government has introduced several \nprogressive  structural  reforms  including  simplifying  the  taxation  system,  liberalizing  the \n\n                                                \n21   State-Owned Enterprise Reform and Public\u2013Private Partnerships (accessible from the list of linked documents in \n\nAppendix 2) provides additional information on the SOE portfolio, performance, and reform efforts. \n\n22   The  PPP  policy  framework  applies  to  government  ministries,  local  government,  departments,  and  agencies. \nApplication of the policy to public enterprises will be considered project by project. The policy framework specifies \n(i) the scope and application; (ii) a typical PPP process and steps in the project development cycle where ministerial \nand  cabinet  approvals  are  required;  and  (iii)  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  various  government  stakeholders, \nincluding  the  MOE.  Fiji  previously  had  a  Public\u2013Private  Partnership  Act,  2006,  which  contained  provisions  that \nlimited foreign investment, and lacked clear guidelines for developing and transacting PPPs. This was repealed in \n2016, in line with ADB advice. \n\n23   A significant improvement over 2017 where less than 25% of directors and senior managers were trained. \n \n\n\ftelecommunications market, introducing competition in the land lease process, and strengthening \ninfrastructure services.24  \n \n19.  With support from ADB and other development partners, the government has taken further \nsteps  to  improve  the  business  and  investment  climate  in  consultation  with  the  private  sector \nthrough the following subprogram 1 policy actions. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nForeign  investment  and  trade.  To  boost  investor  confidence  and  reduce \nuncertainty around the resolution of international commercial disputes, Parliament \nhas passed international arbitration legislation that provides for arbitrations seated \nin Fiji and the enforcement of foreign arbitral awards in Fiji.25 The government has \nalso  ratified  the  World  Trade  Organization  Trade  Facilitation  Agreement  (TFA), \nwhich  will  facilitate  reforms  to  improve  trade  competitiveness.  26  The  TFA  is \nimplemented  through  a  National  Action  Plan,  which  has  been  endorsed  by  the \nNational  Trade  Facilitation  Committee  comprising  representatives  from  the \ngovernment, private sector, and civil society associations.27 In addition, the Ministry \nof  Industry,  Trade,  and  Tourism  has  consulted  stakeholders  for  a  review  of  the \nForeign Investment Act, 1999.28  \nAccess to finance. Parliament has passed the Personal Property Securities Act, \nwhich  will  enable  lenders  to  accept  movable  assets  as  security  for  loans  more \neasily, cheaply, and securely. This will facilitate financial product innovation and \nincrease  access  to  finance,  particularly  for  businesses.  The  existing  legal \nframework in Fiji had deficiencies, which increase the risk and cost to lenders, and \nrestricted lenders\u2019 willingness to accept such movable assets as security.29 \nEase  of  doing  business.  Parliament  has  legislated  the  Regulation  of  Building \nPermits Act, which establishes expedited processes for obtaining building permits, \nparticularly for commercial purposes, to reduce costs of doing business.  \n\n \n20. \nSubprograms 2 and 3 will support the drafting of an investment policy framework and an \ninvestment bill. Fiji\u2019s compliance with its World Trade Organization TFA commitments, including \nthe approval and implementation of the National Action Plan, will see the completion of at least \n11  category  B  commitments.  The  government  will  establish  the  Personal  Property  Securities \nRegistry, and regulations will be made under the relevant act. The government also plans to take \nthe necessary steps for the International Arbitration Act and the Regulation of Building Permits \nAct to come into force. Finally, the cabinet will approve legislation relating to trademarks, designs, \n\n                                                \n24   The  government  is  strengthening  its  competition  policies  and  legal  framework,  and  the  capacity  of  the  Fijian \nCompetition and Consumer Commission, including the regulation of tariffs for infrastructure services provided by \nmonopoly providers. The government seeks to achieve competitive neutrality for SOEs and private businesses. \n25   International  arbitration  provides  an  alternative,  cost-effective,  and  time-efficient  means  of  dispute  resolution \nbetween parties. It is recognized in 157 countries, including Fiji\u2019s major sources of foreign direct investment. Fiji\u2019s \nInternational  Arbitration  Act  2017  was  passed  after  extensive  consultations  with  private  sector  businesses  and \nlawyers.  It  implements  Fiji\u2019s  treaty  obligations  under  the  United  Nations  Convention  on  the  Recognition  and \nEnforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (New York, 1958), known as the New York Convention, which it acceded \nto in 2010.  \n\n26   Business and Investment Climate Reform (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) provides \n\nadditional information on barriers to private sector development and ongoing reform efforts. \n\n27   The  TFA  contains  provisions  for  expediting  the movement,  release,  and clearance  of  goods,  including  goods in \ntransit. It also sets out measures for cooperation between customs and other authorities on compliance issues.  \n28   The  new  investment  policy  framework  and  legislation  are  expected  to  cover  investment  generally,  rather  than \nforeign  investment  specifically,  which  is  now  international  best  practice.  This  is  expected  to  simplify  investment \napproval processes, strengthen investor protection, and review restricted and reserved investment lists.  \n\n29   Personal Property Securities Act 2017. Examples of movable assets include equipment, inventory, crops, livestock, \n\naccounts receivable, and vehicles. \n\n \n\n7 \n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nand  patents,  as  well  as  a  policy  framework  and  drafting  of  a  bill  relating  to  competition  and \nconsumer protection,  which are  all fundamental building  blocks for  private  sector  development \nand entrepreneurship. \n \nADB value addition. ADB has a longstanding engagement with the government on SOE \n21. \nand business climate reforms, though support for fiscal management and PFM reforms has been \nlimited. Through regional TA, ADB has provided advice on macroeconomic management and built \nfiscal planning and policy-making capacity.30 This experience and the strong relationship with the \ngovernment have helped ADB to play an important role in identifying and implementing critical \nstructural reforms \u2013 specifically ADB has directly supported the development of the medium term \nexpenditure  framework,  PPP  policy,  privatization  guidelines,  and  drafting  of  legislation  on \ninternational  arbitration  and  personal  property  securities,  and  will  provide  support  to  their \nimplementation. Given the recent administrative focus on post-cyclone reconstruction (para. 4) \nand  high  staff  turnover  of  middle  and  senior  management  in  the  government,  reform \nimplementation  would  have  been  difficult  and  costly  without  ADB  analytical,  technical,  and \nfinancial support. ADB will support subsequent subprogram reforms through these TA projects. \n \n22. \nDevelopment  partner  coordination.  The  program  is  part  of  a  well-coordinated  multi-\ndonor package of support for structural reform. It is aligned with the World Bank\u2019s development \npolicy operations, also planned for approvals in 2018 and 2019. ADB is working closely with the \nWorld Bank, the Government of Australia, and PFTAC to support implementation. \n \nC. \n \n23. \nImplementation  of  these  policy  actions under  the  Sustained Private  Sector-Led Growth \nReform Program is expected to improve the quality of budget systems and institutions, improve \nthe productivity and competitiveness of SOEs, and facilitate the creation of new businesses and \nformal  job  growth. 31  Research  indicates  that  strong  budget  institutions  help  improve  fiscal \nbalances and public external debt outcomes, supporting the expectation that the program\u2019s reform \nactions  on  fiscal  management  will  improve  the  fiscal  balance.  Improving  the  policy,  legal,  and \ninstitutional  framework  for  SOEs  in  Fiji  will  strengthen  governance,  transparency  and \naccountability, which is in turn expected to improve their performance and service delivery and \nhelp avoid unsustainable borrowing, reduce  contingent  liabilities,  create more room for  private \ninvestment,  and  improve  reliability,  efficiency,  and  affordability  of  public  services.  Finally,  Fiji\u2019s \nbusiness environment reforms are expected to increase the distance to frontier score from 60.7% \nin 2017 to at least 64.0% by 2020.32 This improvement will bring Fiji close to the performance of \nKyrgyz  Republic  (65.17),  South  Africa  (65.2),  and  Bhutan  (65.37)  in  2017.  Divanbeigi  and \nRamalho33 (2015) analyzed whether business regulatory changes, measured with the distance to \nfrontier scores, are linked to economic outcomes. Using panel data for 2003\u20132013 across more \nthan 180 countries, they found that an improvement of 10 points in the distance to frontier score \nis linked to an increase of around 0.5\u20130.6 new businesses per 1,000 working-age adults. Applying \nthe cross-country average effect in this study to Fiji, an improvement of 4 points in the DTF score, \nas indicated in the DMF, is expected to create about 95\u2013114 additional businesses annually. \n \n\nImpacts of the Reform \n\n                                                \n30   ADB. 2009.

Washington DC: World Bank.  \n\n\fDevelopment Financing Needs and Budget Support \n\nD. \n \n24. \nThe  government  has  requested  $180  million  in  financial  assistance  in  the  form  of  a \nprogrammatic approach, comprising loans of $15 million for subprogram 1 in FY2018, $55 million \nfor subprogram 2 in FY2019, and $110 million for subprogram 3 in FY2020 from ADB\u2019s regular \nordinary  capital  resources.  The  loans  will  have  a  15-year  term,  a  grace  period  of  3  years;  an \nannual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased  lending  facility;  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Parallel collaborative partner cofinancing from \nthe World Bank will comprise $15 million for subprogram 1 and $35 million for subprogram 2. It \nwill help meet the government\u2019s total financing requirements from FY2018 to FY2020, projected \nat F$1.1 billion (about $530 million), and help finance ongoing post-cyclone reconstruction and \nsocial services and social protection programs. The gap will be filled by concessional project loans \nand domestic bonds. The program has considered the government\u2019s financing needs, its ability \nto  rebuild  fiscal  buffers  to  respond  to  natural  disasters,  the  availability  of  alternative  financing \nincluding the estimated financial support from other partners, and debt sustainability. \n \nE. \n \n25. \nThe  program  is  expected  to  be  implemented  over  40  months  from  January  2017  to \nApril 2020. The  implementation  period for  subprogram  1 is  January  2017\u2013February  2018. The \nMOE will be the executing agency. The MOE, MPE, Ministry of Industry, Trade, and Tourism, and \nthe  Reserve  Bank  of  Fiji  will  be  the  implementing  agencies.  A  steering  committee  (to  be \nestablished) will oversee program implementation and will meet at least four times a year, with \nmore  regular  meetings  to  align  with  key  phases  in  the  national  budget  cycle  and  for  loan \nmilestones. The proceeds of the policy-based loan will be withdrawn in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time).34 \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \n26. \nFollowing  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  subprogram  1  is  classified \ncategory C  for  the  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples.  Program \nactivities  will  be  confined  to  policy  and  institutional  reforms.  No  activity  will  result  in  or  lead to \ninvoluntary resettlement, or negatively affect indigenous peoples or the environment. \n \n27. \nThe program is expected to have positive social outcomes (para. 23). The public sector is \na  key  provider  of  infrastructure  and  services  to  low-income  households.  Improved  fiscal \nmanagement will help ensure the government has the resources to respond to future economic \nshocks and disasters triggered by natural hazards (which tend to have an adverse effect on the \npoor) while maintaining critical public services. Improving policies and institutions for SOE reforms \nand  private  sector  participation  will  increase  competition,  and make  basic  goods  and  services \nmore affordable, while creating more jobs and opportunities in Fiji. The government also agreed \nto comply with ADB information disclosure and consultation requirements. \n \n28.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 2 and described in detail in \nthe  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.35 PFM  systems  are  assessed  as  capable  of \nsupporting  mostly  reliable  service  provision.  Policy  reforms  and  TA  support  will  address  other \nfiduciary risks. The overall risk of the operation is moderate. To mitigate the risks, the proposed \nprogram focuses on areas where the government has a strong record, selects options for policy \n\n                                                \n34   List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n35 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nactions  in  subprograms  2  and  3  that  would  help  maintain  reform  momentum  but  allow  some \nflexibility,  and  facilitates  strong  coordination  with  other  development  partners  to  ensure  timely \nprovision of TA to support policy implementation.
