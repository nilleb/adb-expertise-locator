Most  of  the  policy  actions  will  lead  to \nsubstantial  positive  environmental \nimpacts.  Any  potential  negative \nenvironmental impacts that may have resulted from increased expenditure \nin  the  water  supply  and  sanitation  (WSS)  and  health  sectors  have  been \nadequately addressed. \n \nThe  proposed  BDSSP  comprises \nloans,  an  Asian \nDevelopment Fund (ADF) grant for the control of human immunodeficiency \nvirus/acquired  immunodeficiency  syndrome  (HIV/AIDS)  and  infectious \ndiseases,  and  a  technical  assistance  (TA)  loan.  The  Program  will  support \npolicy  reforms  to  improve  education,  health,  and  WSS;  finance  social \nsector  performance  grants  to  the  districts;  support  capacity  building  and \ninstitutional strengthening for social service delivery in both provinces and \ndistricts; empower citizens to play a greater role in social service delivery; \nand  enable  the  private  sector  to  participate  in  public  and  private  social \nservice delivery.  \n \nBalochistan\u2019s  social  sector  indicators  are  among  the  most  challenging  in \nSouth  Asia:  female  primary  school  enrollment,  for  example,  is  just  above \n20%.  Balochistan  province  remains  largely  untouched  by  the  buoyant \neconomic growth witnessed in the past few years in Pakistan. Balochistan \nis the country\u2019s largest province, with nearly 44% of its surface area and a \nthinly  dispersed  population  of  around  6.5  million.  The  rugged  and \ninaccessible  terrain,  limited  water  resources  for  irrigation,  large  illiterate \npopulation,  ethnic  diversity,  and  traditional  women\u2019s  status  are  added \nchallenges  to  economic  growth  and  human  development  in  Balochistan. \nMany  of  these  factors  increase  the  cost  of  providing  social  services  in \nBalochistan.  The  predominantly  agro-pastoral  economy  and  severe \ndroughts in the last decade have led to internal migration and increased the \nvulnerability  of  the  poor  and  the  women.  Overexploitation  of  groundwater, \nthe  rapid  disappearance  of  traditional  surface  water  sources,  and  the \nlimited harvesting of surface water have further aggravated water scarcity.  \n \nHuman  capital  must  rapidly  improve  for  Balochistan  to  tap  internal  and \nexternal  markets,  and  capitalize  on  market-driven  economic  growth. \n\n\fiv \n\n       \n\n \n\nBalochistan  has  made  some  progress  in  its  education  and  health \nindicators;  but  the  interplay  of  geographic,  cultural,  ethnic,  historical, \npolitical,  and  other  factors  poses  governance  and  institutional  challenges \nwith major implications for the quality of social service delivery. Balochistan \nneeds to implement governance reforms and strengthen institutions in the \nsocial  sector  to  improve  the  effectiveness  of  public  and  private  social \nservice delivery.  \n \nThe government of Balochistan is determined to pursue a robust economic \nand  human  development  path,  as  stated  in  the  Balochistan  Poverty \nReduction Strategy Paper (BPRSP). However, it has limited resources and \nflexibility  to  support  its  development  needs.  Large  stocks  of  high-interest \ndebt  and  constrained  fiscal  space  have  limited  the  scope  for  financing \nhuman development in Balochistan. \n \nThe  challenging  social  sector  indicators,  challenges  in  social  service \nprovision, and low current investments in the social sectors justify need for \nhigher  investments  and  more  efficiency  in  the  social  sectors.  The \nBalochistan  Local  Government  Ordinance  (BLGO)  2001  has  created \ninstitutional  opportunities  to  improve  social  service  delivery  by  involving \nlocal governments and communities. However, policy reforms, institutional \nstrengthening,  and  capacity  building  of  both  managers  and  service \nproviders are needed to improve devolved social services. \n \nBDSSP  will  help  Balochistan  province  accelerate  progress  toward  the \nMillennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs)  and  BPRSP  goals  in  education, \nhealth,  and  WSS.  The  objectives  of  BDSSP  are  to  (i)  improve  access  to \naffordable, efficient, effective, and good-quality education, health, and WSS \nin the public and private sectors; (ii) decrease inequities in social services \nbased  on  income,  gender,  ethnicity,  and  geography;  and  (iii)  strengthen \nlocal  governments,  the  private  sector,  and  communities  to  improve  social \nservice delivery. \n \nThe  program  has  four  principal  policy  areas:  (i)  provincial  efficiency \nincentives,  to  strengthen  and  clarify  relationships  between  provincial  and \nlocal  governments;  (ii)  managerial  power,  to  strengthen  the  relationship \nbetween  the  local  governments  and  the  providers  of  social  services; \n(iii) citizen voice and empowerment, to strengthen the relationship between \ncitizens  and  policy  makers,  and  between  citizens  and  service  providers; \nand (iv) private sector engagement in service delivery. \n \nBDSSP will provide policy reform support for province-wide devolved social \nservices  (education,  health,  and  WSS)  through  performance  grants  and \nTA.  The  Balochistan  Performance  Grant  Rules  2005  define \nthe \nimplementation  arrangements,  procedures,  and  monitoring  and  reporting \nchannels for the performance grants to be supported by BDSSP. \n \nThe  additional  costs  associated  with  policy  and  institutional  reforms,  and \nmeasures to expedite progress toward education, health, and WSS\u2013related \nMDGs, are estimated to be at least $261 million equivalent. \n \n\n \nImpact and \nOutcomes \n \n\n \nCost Estimates \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fFinancing Plan \n\nThe  government  of  Balochistan  has  requested  financial  assistance  of \n$205  million  equivalent  comprising  $195  million  in  two  program  loans \n($130  million  from  ordinary  capital  resources  [OCR]  and  $65  million  from \nADF),  a  TA \nloan  of  $5  million,  and  an  ADF  grant  of \n$5 million for the control of HIV/AIDS and infectious diseases. \n \n\n \n\nv\n\nFinancing Plan \n($ million) \n\nSource \n\n \nA.

The ADF program loan of $65 million equivalent \nwill have a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; an interest \nrate of 1% per year during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter; and other \nterms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  Financing  and  Program \nAgreements. \n \nThe Government of Pakistan will on-lend the proceeds of the loans in local \ncurrency  to  the  government  of  Balochistan  on  terms  equivalent  to  those \ngiven  by  ADB.  However,  the  foreign  currency  risk  will  be  borne  by  the \nGovernment of Pakistan. \n \nBalochistan\u2019s  public  health  challenges  include  combating  high  morbidity \nand  mortality  from  malaria  and  tuberculosis;  preventing  the  spread  of \nHIV/AIDS in high-risk groups, and raising general awareness of HIV/AIDS \nin  a \nilliterate  population;  and  reducing  vaccine-preventable \nchildhood  infectious  diseases.  A  $5  million  ADF  grant  for  the  control  of \nHIV/AIDS  and  infectious  diseases  will  be  used  to  finance  specific \ncomponents  of  health  sector  performance  grants  that  will  have  a  high \nimpact  on  the  prevention  of  HIV/AIDS,  the  prevention  and  treatment  of \nmalaria  and \nthe  reduction  of  vaccine-preventable \nchildhood  illnesses.  The  grant  outputs  and  outcomes  will  be  carefully \nmonitored  through  the  reporting  mechanisms  of  the  program  loan,  and \nthrough  public  expenditure  tracking  surveys  and  quantitative  service \ndelivery surveys.  \n\ntuberculosis,  and \n\nlargely \n\n \nLoan Amount \nand Terms \n \n\n \nADF Grant for \nHIV/AIDS and \nInfectious \nDiseases Control \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \nThe  program  period  is  from  1  July  2006  to  30  June  2009.

At \nthe  provincial  level,  PUs  will  be  set  up  in  the  finance  department  and  the \nbureau of statistics. In the districts, a PU will be set up in the planning and \nfinance  office  of  the  district  government.  Consultants  recruited  under  the \nTA  loan  will  assist  in  developing  and  implementing  policy  reforms  under \nBDSSP,  including  studies  and  surveys.  Nongovernment  organizations \n(NGOs) or firms will be contracted by BDSSP to (i) support the bureau of \nstatistics in carrying out quantitative service delivery surveys (QSDSs), (ii) \nsupport the finance department in carrying out public expenditure tracking \nsurveys (PETSs), and (iii) conduct third-party validation of the process and \nresults of the surveys.  \n \nThe loan proceeds will finance the foreign exchange cost of items procured \nfrom  ADB  member  countries,  which  also  produced  the  items,  excluding \nlisted  ineligible  items  and  imports  financed  by  other  multilateral  and \nbilateral sources. The program loans will be disbursed according to ADB\u2019s \nsimplified disbursement procedures and audit requirements. \n \nThe counterpart funds generated from the ADF program loan and grant will \nsupport  performance  grants  to  finance  local  government  expenditures  in \neducation,  health,  and  WSS  until  30  June  2010.  The  counterpart  funds \ngenerated from the entire OCR loan will refinance the high-interest debt of \nthe  government  of  Balochistan,  and  the  fiscal  space  thus  created  will  be \ndedicated  to  providing  current  budget  support  in  devolved  social  sectors \nand  transferred  to  the  local  governments  under  the  provincial  finance \ncommission (PFC) award. \n \nThe TA will (i) support sector work on specific policy reforms and improve \nsector  performance;  (ii)  strengthen  sector  planning,  management,  and \nmonitoring; (iii) develop the capacity of local governments and communities \nfor the governance of social services; and (iv) support the implementation \nof  policy  reforms,  performance  grants,  and  capacity-building  activities \nunder BDSSP. \n \nThe  TA  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $6.25  million  equivalent,  comprising \n$0.18 million in foreign exchange costs and $6.07 million in local currency \ncosts.

Minor  packages  costing  $100,000  equivalent  or  less  may  be \nprocured through LCB or direct purchase. \n \nConsultants  and  consulting  firms  will  be  recruited  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory \nto  ADB.  Consultants  will  be  hired  individually  or  through  consulting  firms. \nThe  TA  Loan  will  provide  for,  among  others,  8.3  person-months  of \ninternational  consultants  and  104  person-months  of  domestic  consultants. \nIn addition, 4,242 months of contract staff will be hired in the provinces and \ndistricts during the program period to help with program implementation. \n \nThe  BDSSP  interventions  will  further  Balochistan\u2019s  progress  toward  the \nMDGs and the social sector targets set in the BPRSP.  \n \nBDSSP will increase funding for social services through performance grant \ntransfers and additional support for current expenditures. The performance \ngrants  are  designed  to  enable  local  governments  to  provide  a  flexible, \nneeds-based  response  to  local  conditions,  adopt  an  effective  demand-\ndriven  and  participatory  planning  process  to  identify  service  gaps,  and \nrationalize  and  develop  services  with  full  ownership  of  the  interventions \ndecided by them. At the same time, the grants target priority investments in \nthe  social  sectors  according  to  the provincial  policy  frameworks  to  ensure \nbalanced  progress  in  an  accelerated  manner  toward  the  MDGs  and  the \nBDSSP policy reforms. The additional support for current expenditures will \nhelp bridge critical gaps in non-salary expenditures in the social sectors. \n \nPerformance  grant  funding  to  local  governments  for  basic  social  services \nand  the  introduction  of  a  package  of  minimum  essential  services  will \nparticularly  benefit  the  poor  and  vulnerable.  The  TA  will  assist  the \ngovernment  of  Balochistan  in  developing  a  strategy  and  action  plan  to \n\n \n \nPeriod of \nUtilization under \nthe TA Loan \n \nExecuting \nAgency of the \nTA Loan \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \nfor the TA Loan \n \nProcurement \nUnder the TA \nLoan \n \n\n \nConsulting \nServices Under \nthe TA Loan \n \n\n \nProgram \nBenefits and \nBeneficiaries \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nix\n\nin  social  service  delivery; \npromote  public-private  partnership  (PPP) \ninnovating  improvements  in  the  quality,  access,  and  delivery  of  social \nservices;  and  evolving  and  implementing  a  self-regulatory  mechanism  for \nthe private sector. While programs such as BDSSP cannot directly address \nthe  issue  of  retrogressive  societal  norms  and  practices,  which  cause \nwomen  to  be  marginalized  in  Balochistan  society,  they  can  certainly \nimprove  the  quality  of  women\u2019s  lives  and  lay  the  groundwork  for  greater \nautonomy for women in both public and private spheres. \n \nBDSSP will strengthen the local government system. Its policy reforms will \nassist  the  government  of  Balochistan  in  defining  the  role  of  the  provincial \nsocial sector departments according to BLGO 2001. The program will help \nbuild the capacity of local councilors, including women councilors, to plan, \nimplement, and manage improvements in service delivery, and will provide \nlinkages  with  related  activities  that  are  ongoing.  In  addition,  the  program \nwill  further  institutionalize  the  involvement  of  the  community  and  civil \nsociety in local government affairs. \n \nPoverty in Balochistan is also marked by a general sense of powerlessness \nand a perceived lack of dignity. While BDSSP cannot directly address the \ngovernance issues that give rise to and perpetuate such feelings, program \ninitiatives  aimed  at  removing  inequities  and  ensuring  that  public  services \nare  managed  by,  and  in  consultation  with,  elected  representatives  and \ncommunity  members  can  help  reduce  apathy  and  insecurity  among  the \nvulnerable in Balochistan. \n \nThe  success  of  the  program  is  subject  to  a  number  of  risks  and \nassumptions.  Appropriate  risk  mitigation  measures  have  been  integrated \ninto the program design, and are discussed below. \n \nThe  government  has  a  wide  constituency  to  satisfy  and  is  therefore \nvulnerable  to  different  pressures.  The  porous  borders  with  neighboring \ncountries  allow  rampant  smuggling.  Law  enforcement  is  handicapped  by \nseparate  but  coexisting  rules  and  enforcement  systems  in  some  parts  of \nthe  province.  The  vast  size  and  rugged  terrain  of  the  province  and  the \nsparse,  poorly  connected  population  make  administration  all  the  more \ndifficult. BDSSP cannot mitigate all these risks, particularly those related to \ngeopolitics. But it will help mitigate some risks and would link with ongoing \nefforts  in  this  regard  under  BRMP,  DSP,  Access  to  Justice  Program,  and \nother programs. \n \nThere  is  a  risk  that  vested  interests  might  be  resistant  to  the  new \ntransparent  and  accountable  processes  and  reluctant  to  change  systems. \nTo  mitigate  such  risks,  high-level  support  and  a  high-level  steering \ncommittee  will  be  important.  Risks  are  expected  to  be  further  mitigated \nthrough such BDSSP policy actions as special audits, public availability of \naccounts  and  expenditures,  and  public  grievance  mechanisms.  A  major \nfocus  of  BDSSP  is  improving  social  sector  governance,  and  establishing \ntransparent  and  objective  decision-making  to  minimize  rent  seeking.  The \nimplementation  of  reforms  might  therefore  be  delayed  or  undermined  by \nvested  interests.  BDSSP  will  counter  such  risks  by  building  stakeholder \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n \n\n \n\n\fx \n\n       \n\n \n\nincluding \n\nthe  participation  of \n\nimplementation,  establishing \nownership  during  program  design  and \nprogram  oversight  mechanisms \nlocal \ngovernment  council  committees,  and  ensuring  synergy  with  other  reform \nprograms. \n \nFast-track  devolution  has  brought  with  it  a  substantial  agenda  of  political, \nadministrative, and fiscal restructuring; new systems, rules, and guidelines; \nand  the  need  to  train  administrators  and  councilors.  Local  government \nsystems  must  be  fully  operational  and  government  departments  and \nagencies geared to fully support the process. A major concern is the limited \nactual devolution of financial, managerial, and technical responsibilities and \nthe inadequate capacity of local government functionaries. These risks will \nbe mitigated by rationalizing the roles and responsibilities of the provincial \ndepartments  in  the  light  of  their  changed  relationship  with  the  local \ngovernments  under  BLGO  2001,  and  building  local  government  capacity \nunder the TA Loan. \n \nPakistan\u2019s  macroeconomic  parameters  have  been  strong  in  the  past \nfew  years  and  policy  reforms  are  beginning  to  show  positive  results. \nHowever,  poverty  remains  unacceptably  high  and  cannot  be  allowed  to \nstay  that  way.  The  country  is  highly  vulnerable  to  external  shocks.  To \nmitigate  such  risks  as  far  as  possible,  Pakistan  has  put  in  place  a \nconsistent economic management strategy to reduce debt and help ensure \nfiscal  stability.  The  government  of  Balochistan,  with  BRMP  support,  is \ndeveloping its own debt management strategy. \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f(cid:120)(cid:105)\n\n(cid:78) (cid:79) (cid:82) (cid:84) (cid:72)

\n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n\n2. \nPakistan\u2019s  macroeconomic  situation  has  improved  significantly  in  the  last  few  years. \nBefore  the  1990s,  external  capital  flows  drove  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  rates  of \n6%, causing major structural imbalances in public finance. The rapid accumulation of debt led to \nserious  fiscal  constraints  in  the  1990s:  average  GDP  growth  declined  to  4.4%  and \nunemployment  rose  from  4.7%  in  fiscal  year  (FY)  1993  to  7.8%  in  FY2000.2  Since  FY2000, \nhowever,  the  overall  economy  and  fiscal  balance  have  improved,  and  economic  performance \ncontinues  to  show  strength\u2014macroeconomic  fundamentals  are  better  than  at  any  time  in  the \npast decade. In FY2005, GDP growth was 8.4% (compared with 6.4% in FY2004), the highest \nin  the  last  two  decades.  But  the  fiscal  deficit  has  also  grown  to  3.2%  of  GDP  in  FY2005  from \n2.3% of GDP the previous year. \n \nIn  FY2006,  GDP  growth  is  likely  to  be  broad-based  and  is  expected  to  be  more  than \n3. \n7%, while the fiscal deficit will remain below 4%. The medium-term prospects for the Pakistan \neconomy  continue  to  improve,  but  sustained  economic  recovery  is  subject  to  certain  risks. \nThere are early signs of overheating\u2014inflation rose to 9.3% in FY2005. Imports are expanding \nrapidly, from 15.6% in FY2004 to more than 18% in FY2005. The current account went from a \nsurplus of 1.9% of GDP in FY2004 to a deficit of 1.4% of GDP in FY2005. \n \n4. \nThe  Government  has  embarked  on  a  major  decentralization  effort,  together  with \nnationwide  reforms  in  public  financing  and  management  and  a  poverty  reduction  strategy. \nStrong  economic  growth  in  the  last  few  years  and  a  substantial  increase  in  poverty-related \npublic  expenditure  over  the  past  5  years  have  had  a  positive  impact  on  poverty.  There  are \nencouraging trends in the achievement of the expenditure targets set in the Poverty Reduction \nStrategy  Paper  (PRSP)\u2014expenditures  increased  to  4.6%  of  GDP  in  FY2004  from  3.8%  in \nFY2002.  \n \n5. \nBetween 2001 and 2003, unemployment decreased from 8.3% to 7.7% in Pakistan but \nincreased  from  7.8%  to  8.2%  in  Balochistan.3  According  to  the  Labor  Force  Survey  (LFS) \n2003\u20132004, urban unemployment is 9.7% in Pakistan, and 12.5% in Balochistan. The increase \nin  unemployment  in  Balochistan  at  a  time  when  Pakistan\u2019s  economy  and  employment  were \nimproving indicates that Balochistan has not benefited much from the economic growth in other \nparts of Pakistan (Supplementary Appendix A).  \n \n6. \nOf the budgeted revenue receipts for FY2005, close to 95% are expected to come from \nfederal government transfers. The provincial tax base is narrow and limited. The government of \nBalochistan has a large stock of high-interest debt, and in FY2004, PRs2.6 billion, or 10.7% of \nits total current expenditure, went to debt servicing. The high-interest cash development loans \n\n                                                 \n1  The program design and monitoring framework of the proposed Balochistan Devolved Social Services Program is \n\nin Appendix 1. \n\n2  ADB. 2002.

There  is  significant  opportunity  to  create  additional \nfiscal space by refinancing the CDLs (Appendix 2 and Supplementary Appendix B).4 \n\nIII. \n\nTHE SOCIAL SERVICES SECTORS \n\n \n\nA. \n\nSector Description and Performance \n\n1. \n\nOverview \n\n7. \nIn  Pakistan,  Balochistan  has  the  highest  percentage  of  the  highly  deprived,  in  both \nincome  and  human  poverty  terms:  88%  of  its  people  live  in  highly  deprived  districts  (see \nSupplementary  Appendix  C).5  Human  development  indicators  in  Balochistan  are  the  weakest \namong  the  four  provinces  of  Pakistan  and  improvements  will  need  concerted  efforts  over  the \nlong  term  (Appendix  3).  To  expedite  human  development  and  reduce  income  poverty,  the \ngovernment  of  Balochistan  has  formulated  the  Balochistan  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  Paper \n(BPRSP) (2003),6 whose key pillars are engendering growth, managing scarce water resources, \nreforming governance, improving human development, and addressing vulnerability to shocks.  \n\n2. \n\nPoverty and Social Development \n\n8. \nBalochistan  has  a  predominantly  poor  rural  population,  which  is  thinly  distributed  over \nvast and difficult terrain. The province has 44.0% (350,000 square kilometers) of Pakistan\u2019s land \nmass  but  only  5.0%  of  the  population.  Poverty  in  Balochistan  is  a  consequence  of  several \nfactors,  including  geography  and  low  human  capital.  Inequality,  though  pervasive  (Gini  index: \n20), is less than in Pakistan as a whole (Gini index: 27) in 2001. Though poverty in Balochistan \nis more \u201cshared\u201d poverty, income-based inequities in human development must be addressed. \nThe  poor  are  recovering  from  the  devastating  drought  that  plagued  the  province  for  the  last  5 \nyears.  The  groundwater  is  rapidly  being  depleted.  Only  6%  of  the  land  is  cultivable  and \nproductivity  is  low  because  of  the  arid  conditions.  The  ethnic  diversity  and  predominantly \npatriarchal  social  structures  are  a  traditional  challenge  to  human  development  and  gender \nequity.  \n \n9. \nAddressing human development needs in Balochistan is made more costly and difficult \nby the spatial distribution of household poverty, the basic infrastructure, ethnic diversity, gender \nimbalances, generational distribution of poverty, fiscal framework and fiscal traps (including the \npublic  investment  needed  to  reduce  poverty,  and    the  debt  overhang),  physical  geography \n(including  transport  conditions  and  population  densities),  agronomic  conditions,  disease \necology,  governance  patterns  and  failure,  cultural  barriers,  and  geopolitics.  These  factors,7 \nwhich are absent in traditional economic analysis,   must be carefully considered when planning \ndevelopment assistance for Balochistan.  \n \nGender  and  Development.  Balochistan\u2019s  social  sector  indicators  underscore  the  high \n10. \ndegree of gender inequality: in primary school, for  example, the net primary enrollment rate is \n28%  for  boys  but  only  20%  for  girls.  Women\u2019s  inferior  status  is  perpetuated  by  their  curtailed \nmobility, discriminatory tribal and cultural practices, women\u2019s limited voice in critical household \ndecisions,  and  political  marginalization.  The  gender  reform  agenda  of  the  government  is \n\n                                                 \n4  Based on estimates from studies for the Balochistan Resource Management Program. \n5  Jamal, H., A.

Initiatives like the GRAP, Decentralization Support Program (DSP), BRMP, \nand BDSSP aim to give women more access to public sector services and greater participation \nin public sector management and in political and economic activities. \n\n3. \n\nDevolution to Local Governments \n\n11. \nCentralized  planning  and  management  of  social  services  has  created  indisciplined, \nunionized,  and  absentee  government  providers;  a  lack  of  focus  on  clients\u2019  needs;  central \nbureaucracies overwhelmed by transfers and service litigations; and communities indifferent to \nsocial  service  delivery.  As  a  result,  public  social  services  have  become  less  effective  and \nefficient and their quality has declined, even as they have become more inaccessible, especially \nto  the  poor  and  people  living  in  remote  areas.  The  Balochistan  Local  Government  Ordinance \n(BLGO)  2001,  as  amended  from  time  to  time,  most  recently  in  June  2005,  provides  an \ninstitutional  framework  that  empowers  district  governments,  tehsil  (sub-district  administrative \nunit) municipal administrations (TMAs), and union administrations to manage and administer the \neducation,  health,  and  water  supply  and  sanitation  (WSS)  sectors  with  the  help  of  local \ncommunities.  The  devolution  of  social  service  management  to  local  governments  presents  an \nopportunity  to  improve  service  delivery.  The  transition  from  provincial  to  local  government \ndelivery  involves  many  institutional,  capacity,  legal,  and  financial  challenges,  which  must  be \naddressed  though  policy  reforms  and  TA  to  prepare  the  provincial  line  departments  and  local \ngovernments  for  their  changed  roles  and  responsibilities.  The  government  of  Balochistan  has \nbeen  addressing  these transition issues  with  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  support  through \nthe DSP and BRMP. Further policy reforms and assistance are needed to consolidate ongoing \nreforms  and  implement  the  next  phase  of  reforms,  improve  the  capacity  of  managers  and \nproviders, and encourage the private sector and ordinary citizens to participate in social service \ndelivery (Supplementary Appendix D).  \n\n4. \n\nSocial Sector Financing \n\nBalochistan has limited room to increase its social sector expenditures partly because of \n12. \nits  high  debt-service  burden.  Currently,  social  sector  expenditures  mostly  go  to  salaries,  while \nnon-salary  expenditures  are  well  below  the  global  norms  for  the  efficient  and  effective \nfunctioning  of  the  social  sectors.  BLGO  2001  made  the  district  governments  primarily \nresponsible  for  education,  health,  and  WSS,  among  others.  However,  only  salary-related \nbudgets  have  been  devolved  to  the  local  governments;  the  province  has  retained  most  of  the \nnon-salary and development expenditures for the devolved social services. Understandably, the \ndevelopment effectiveness of the local governments has therefore been reduced (Appendix 2). \n\n5. \n\nMillennium Development Goals \n\n13. \nNet primary enrollment rates (goal 2) for both boys (28%) and girls (20%) are very low \nand improving slowly. Gender disparity in school education (goal 3) is decreasing, but is still a \nlong way from the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Substantial investments will have to \nbe made to achieve the MDG related to child health (goal 4). Maternal health indicators (goal 5) \nare low: only 26% of pregnant women have prenatal care, and only 21% are delivered by skilled \nbirth  attendants.  Malaria  and \nthe  human \nimmunodeficiency  virus/acquired  immunodeficiency  syndrome  (HIV/AIDS)  requires  determined \nefforts  to  contain  (goal  6).  Goal  7,  relating  to  access  to  drinking  water  and  sanitation,  is \nachievable but will need significant investments to improve access and infrastructure (Appendix \n4). \n \n\ntuberculosis  are  major  problems,  and \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n     \n\n6. \n\nEducation \n\n \n\n14. \nThough  the  government  of  Balochistan  has  assigned  priority  to  female  and  rural \neducation,  gender  and  regional  disparities  remain,  and  much  more  needs  to  be  done  to  meet \nthe  Education  for  All  (EFA)  and  Education  Sector  Reform  (ESR)  targets  and  the  MDGs.  The \nliteracy  rate  for  those  10  years  and  above  is  28%,  compared  with  the  national  average  of \n48%.The rural literacy rate (23%) is significantly lower than  the urban rate (54%),  and literacy \namong rural females (10%) is only one-third of rural males (37%) (Supplementary Appendix E).  \n \nLong walking distances, lack of basic amenities, and teacher absenteeism are some of \n15. \nthe main factors, together with poor-quality teaching and learning materials, that are responsible \nfor  low  enrollment.  Income-based  inequities  are  a  leading  cause  of  low  access  to  school \neducation. While the enrollment ratio between boys and girls in Pakistan is 1.5:1, in the lowest \nincome quartile it is 1.9:1, and in the lowest quartile in Balochistan it is 6.3:1. As income falls, \nparents\u2019 willingness and resolve to educate daughters falls faster, more so in Balochistan.8 The \ncontinuation  rate  from  primary  to  middle  school is  about  23%,  and  from  middle  to  high school \nabout  39%.  A  significant  discrepancy  in  number  between  primary  and  middle  schools  forces \nhigh dropout rates after primary school. \n \n16. \nThe  government  school  network  comprises  11,417  schools,  with  a  reported  enrollment \nof  813,763,  including  590  \u201cmosque\u201d  schools  with  20,611  students.  There  are  numerous \nshelterless  schools,  and  even  where  buildings  are  available,  these  are  in  disrepair  and  lack \nbasic amenities like drinking water, latrines, and electricity. The shortage of female teachers is \nreflected  in  the  student-teacher  ratios:  1:10  in  boys\u2019  schools  and  1:17  in  girls\u2019  schools  at  the \nprimary  level,  and  1:16  in  boys\u2019  schools  and  1:25  in  girls\u2019  schools  in  high  school.  During  a \nsurvey in rural Balochistan, 25% of the schools surveyed were not holding classes because of \nteacher  absenteeism.  The  same  survey  showed  that  even  in  those  schools  that  were  holding \nclasses only 85% of the teachers were present.9 The disruption of teaching is acute, as most of \nthe schools are either single- or two-teacher schools.  \n \n17. \nIn  the  urban  areas,  the  private  sector\u2014both  for-profit  and  not-for-profit  educational \ninstitutions\u2014is supporting the public sector in improving access to education. The Balochistan \nEducation Foundation was established to promote and finance the development of education in \nthe  province,  but  the  participation  of  the  private  sector  in  education  is  generally  more  limited \nthan  in  other  parts  of  Pakistan.10  Given  the  sparse  distribution  of  private  institutions  in  most \ndeprived  parts  of  Balochistan,  and  the  limited  interest  of  the  private  sector  in  providing \neducation  to  the  poor,  the  public  school  infrastructure  must  be  strengthened  to  give  better \naccess to the rural poor and girls.11 \n\n7. \n\nHealth \n\n18. \nThe National Health Policy 2001 gives priority to primary and secondary health care. The \nInterim  Population  Sector  Perspective  Plan  2012  (2004)  looked  forward  to  reducing  the \npopulation  growth  rate  to  1.9%  by  2004.  The  Balochistan  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  Paper \n(BPRSP) 2003 highlights strategies in line with national population policies. Since the passage \nof  BLGO  2001,  major  public  health  functions  have  been  devolved  to  district  governments. \n\n                                                 \n8  World  Bank.  1996.

Washington, DC. \n10 A  survey  of  private  sector  schools  in  Pakistan,  done  by  the  Federal  Bureau  of  Statistics  in  2001,  showed  that \nBalochistan  has  only  5%  of  the  36,096  private  schools  (Federal  Bureau  of  Statistics,  Government  of  Pakistan. \n2003. Census of Private Educational Institutional in Pakistan. Islamabad). \n\n11 International Crisis Group. 2004. Pakistan: Reforming the Education Sector. Islamabad. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nHowever,  the  following  vertical  programs  need  to  be  integrated  into  the  local  government \nsystem  to  improve  efficiency  and  effectiveness:  immunization,  tuberculosis,  malaria,  HIV/AIDS \ncontrol,  nutrition,  population  welfare,  and  lady  health  volunteers  program.  The  percentage  of \nprovincial  expenditures  allocated  to  health  increased  from  7.6%  to  8.7%  from  1991  to  1998. \nThere  is  an  acute  shortage  of  female  staff  at  all  levels  outside  Quetta.  Mean  bed  occupancy \nrates have been low: basic health units (19%), tehsil headquarters hospitals (35%), and district \nheadquarters  hospitals  (34%).  However,  around  38%  of  patients  use  government  facilities  for \ntheir first consultation in Balochistan, compared with 16% in Punjab.12 \n\n \n19. \nBalochistan province must overcome major challenges to achieve the MDGs related to \ninfant and maternal health. Around 158 out of every 1,000 children born do not reach their fifth \nbirthday (Supplementary Appendix F). Under-5 mortality in rural areas (164 per 1,000 live births) \nis much higher than in urban areas (130 per 1,000 live births). About 4 out of every 10 children \nare  underweight  for  their  age,  although  the  National  Nutrition  Survey  of  2001/02  projected  a \nslightly  lower  figure  of  35.3%  among  children  6\u201359  months  in  the  province.  Only  26%  of \npregnant women (53% urban and 21% rural) availed themselves of prenatal care services from \ntrained birth attendants. Skilled birth attendants assisted 21% of women (47% urban and 16% \nrural) during delivery. The use of postnatal care by women in the first 40 days after delivery was \nalso found to be very low (20% overall, with urban-rural variation of 44% and 15%, respectively). \nOnly  14%  of  married  women  use  modern  contraceptives  (15%,  if  all  other  contraceptive \nmethods are considered). The fertility rate for the province in 1998, according to the census that \nyear, was 5.4. \n \n20. \nHIV/AIDS  and  Infectious  Diseases.  Malaria  and  tuberculosis  pose  serious  threats  to \nthe  health  of  the  poor  in  Balochistan.  Tuberculosis  incidence  is  177  per  100,000  population. \nThere is a need to expand and strengthen directly observed therapy (DOTS) to deal effectively \nwith the tuberculosis problem in the province. The annual parasite incidence of 6.56 for malaria \nin  Balochistan  is  almost  30  times  the  parasite  incidence  for  the  whole  country.  Effective \nmeasures to control the malaria vector and treat malaria cases are important to improve health \nand  reduce  anemia  and  other  morbidities  in  women  and  children.  The  HIV/AIDS  epidemic  is \nmainly concentrated among injecting drug users in the province. A quick and concerted effort is \nrequired to control the spread of HIV/AIDS. HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis are discussed \nin detail in Appendix 5. \n \n21. \nThe private health sector comprises mostly private clinics run by a general duty doctor \nand a paramedic/nurse or a less qualified person. Private practice after office hours is common \namong public sector doctors. There are more than 3,500 registered pharmacies, mostly in urban \nareas,  which  sell  drugs  over  the  counter  with  limited  prescribing.  The  Balochistan  Health \nFoundation has, until September 2004, provided financial assistance to 17 projects. \n\n8. \n\nWater Supply and Sanitation \n\n22. \nNearly  one  half  of  the  population  of  Balochistan  relies  on  unprotected  wells,  ponds, \ncanals,  or  streams  for  their  drinking  water  needs.  In  rural  areas,  where  the  burden  of  fetching \nwater largely falls on women and girls, only 39% of households have access to improved water \nsources within a 2-kilometer distance or a half-hour walk from their homes.13 Over-extraction of \ngroundwater  resulting  from  both  population  pressures  and  electricity  subsidies  for  agricultural \ntube  wells  (refer  to  Supplementary  Appendix  G  for  details)  has  led  to  rapid  depletion  of  the \nwater  table.  Drinking  water  is  often  polluted  and  distributed  without  treatment.  Furthermore, \n                                                 \n12 World Bank. 1998.

Quetta, Bureau  of  Statistics, Government of \n\nBalochistan.  \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n     \n\n \n\ncontamination  also  occurs  in  the  water  distribution  network  through  corrosion  and,  due  to  low \nwater  pressure,  cross-contamination  from  nearby  sewers.  Water  quality  is  not  monitored \nregularly at the source or at the consumer end in the province.  \n \nAccess  to  adequate  sanitation  varies  considerably  among  the  districts  in  the  province:  \n23. \nin only five districts is sanitation accessible to more than 51% of the population; in nine districts \nadequate  sanitation  is  available  to  26\u201350%  of  the  population,  and  in  13  districts  household \nsanitation coverage is only 4\u201325%. Access to sewage disposal infrastructure is largely absent.  \nIn  most  districts,  less  than  3%  of  the  population  has  access  to  wastewater  disposal  facilities.  \nBalochistan  has  no  wastewater  treatment  facilities.  In  urban  areas,  household  sewage  is \ndischarged into natural drains (nullahs) and ultimately into low-lying areas of the town. Garbage \nlitters  the  landscape,  particularly  in  urban  areas  and  along  main  roads.  Apart  from  Quetta, \nGwadar, and Kila Abdullah towns, solid waste collection, transportation, and disposal coverage \nis less than 3%. Waste material is burned, dumped in open spaces, used for uncontrolled landfill \nand land reclamation, or thrown into drains and watercourses. \n \nBLGO 2001 also turned over responsibility for water supply, sanitation, and solid waste \n24. \ncollection  to  local  governments.  The  public  health  engineering  (PHE)  department  has  been \ndevolved  to  the  district  governments,  while  solid  waste  management  (in  both  rural  and  urban \nareas of the tehsil) is now the responsibility of TMAs. The district governments, with funds from \nthe provincial department, are responsible for the operation and maintenance (O&M) of all water \nsupply schemes built before 1992.  \n \n25. \nAfter  1992,  the  962  schemes  developed  by  the  PHE  department  were  handed  over  to \nthe  communities  for  O&M.  The  communities  report  difficulties  in  meeting  operation  costs, \nbecause of very high electricity bills and bills with varying tariff structures. In Quetta, WSS is the \nresponsibility  of  the  Quetta  Water  and  Sanitation  Authority,  while  solid  waste  collection, \ntransportation,  and  disposal  are  undertaken  by  the  municipal  administrations  of  Chiltan  and \nZarghoon towns. No TMA has proper facilities for the collection and sanitary disposal of hospital \nwaste.  The  water  agencies  and  municipal  bodies  traditionally  charged  with  managing  water \nsupply,  wastewater,  and  solid  waste  suffer  from  financial  weaknesses  that  prevent  them  from \ngenerating  capital  to  rehabilitate,  improve,  and  expand  infrastructure  and  facilities.  Private \nsector  operators  have  developed  tube  wells  on  private  land,  particularly  in  Quetta,  for  the \npurpose of selling water to water vendors. The private sector participates in the transportation of \nsolid waste and in recycling schemes, which involve the purchase of materials such as paper, \nglass, and iron produced and segregated by households. Several nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs)  in  Balochistan  are  supporting  the  development  of  small  community-driven  WSS \nschemes.  NGOs  are  also  active  in  promoting  hygiene  and  sanitation  and  the  construction  of \nhousehold toilets, both in urban and rural areas. \n\nB. \n\nIssues, Opportunities, and Lessons \n\n1. \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n26. \nThe  government  of  Balochistan  is  committed  to  alleviating  poverty  and  gender \nimbalance  in  a  holistic  manner,  through  such  means  as  public  service  delivery.  The  local \ngovernment  system  put  in  place  by  BLGO  2001  offers  major  opportunities  for  reforms  and  a \nlevel  of  political  representation  that  is  closer  to  and  more  dependent  on  public  interests.  The \nbasis  for  the  devolution  of  social  service  delivery  is  a  clearer  definition  of  intergovernmental \nfunctions. Actual delivery responsibility is devolved to local governments with revenue-matching \nexpenditure assignments and associated control over establishment and service delivery outfits. \nThe  province  will  have  key  policy,  financing,  standard-setting,  mentoring/technical,  legality \ncontrol, and evaluation functions. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\n \n27. \nIt is evident that to make public service delivery more efficient, equitable, effective, and \nsustainable,  serious  problems  in  the  economic,  social,  legal,  and  political  aspects  of \ngovernance,  participation,  and  financing  must  be  addressed.  ADB  and  other  development \npartners  support  both  BPRSP  and  the  strengthening  of  the  financial  framework  through  better \nbudget planning and execution and smoother intergovernmental flows, to make decentralization \nwork.  The  BRMP  provides  major  policy  reforms  to  strengthen  devolution  and  improve  public \nservice  delivery.  The  recently  notified  Balochistan  Performance  Grant  Rules  (BPGR)  2005 \nprovide  a  flexible  mechanism  for  providing  conditional  transfers  to  local  governments  to  make \npro-poor  service  delivery  more  responsive  to  local  needs,  within  the  policy  priorities  of  the \nprovince. \n \nIn  Balochistan,  the  following  opportunities  can  be  tapped  to  improve  social  service \n28. \ndelivery:  (i)  giving  provincial  line  departments  an  effective  role  in  policy  making  and  standard \nsetting  while  leaving  the  management  and  control  of  devolved  subjects  to  local  governments; \n(ii) assigning responsibilities to local governments by passing supporting rules to transfer power \nof  appointing  and  transferring  staff; approve  and  sanction development  schemes; and  enforce \nefficiency  and  discipline  rules;  and  (iii)  restructuring  vertical  programs  and  the  public  sector \ndevelopment program to bring them in line with the mandate of BLGO 2001. ADB\u2019s support for \nBalochistan  is  growing  (Supplementary  Appendix  H)  and  is  significant  given  the  immense \nhuman development challenges in Balochistan and the limited donor presence (Appendix 6). \n \n29. \nThrough  appropriate  policy  reforms  and  capacity  building,  the  following  issues  can  be \naddressed  more  effectively  by  provincial  and  local  governments:  accountability  of  providers; \ncorruption  and  misconduct;  use  of  staff  resources;  staff  absenteeism;  performance-based \nincentives;  female  staff  deployment;  sector  strategic  frameworks  and  action  plans  and  sector \nplanning capacity in the local governments; constraints posed by the dispersed population; the \nfailure of the \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d formula in the provision and location of facilities; and the absence \nof priorities or thresholds for various types and levels of service. \n \n30. \nPredictable  financing  for  devolved  social  sectors,  including  development  budgets \nconsistent with BLGO 2001 and expenditure assignments from the provincial budget, is critical. \nOther issues related to financial management are: (i) absence of reliable, timely, and complete \ninformation  on  provincial  and  district  government  transactions;  (ii)  poor  financial  controls  at  all \nlevels; (iii) inadequate budgetary and financial discipline; (iv) delays in audits; (v) lack of public \naccess  to  financial  statements;  (vi)  inadequate  expenditure  prioritization;  and  (vii)  absence  of \nexpenditure yardsticks for the allocation of non-salary expenditures. \n \n31. \nThe  centralization  of  decision  making  in  the  province  leaves  little  room  for  citizen \nparticipation  in  government  functioning  at  the  local  level.  There  is  limited  transparency,  little \npublic participation at the local level, and no direct accountability to stakeholders since (i) very \nfew  documents  are  available  to  the  public;  (ii)  there  are  no  reports  on  the  performance  of  the \nprovincial or local governments; (iii) there are no mechanisms for the redressal of grievances; \nand  (iv)  the  partnerships  between  government  and  civil  society  or  the  private  sector  remain \nlimited. \n \n32. \nTo  increase  accountability,  the  BLGO  emphasizes  the  role  of  the  community,  citizen \ncommunity  boards  (CCBs),  public-private  partnerships,  and  the  private  sector  in  expanding \nsocial services, and provides for citizen oversight in the social sectors. This links well with the \nrealities on the ground, where communities and the private sector (including NGOs) have been \nassisting in the expansion of social sector service delivery. However, it does require a change of \nmind-set. Devolution provides a unique opportunity to make this happen.  \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n     \n\n \n\n2. \n\nLessons Identified \n\n33. \nImportant  lessons  learned  from  past  donor  support  and  ADB\u2019s  own  experiences  in \ngeneral and devolved social services programs in Sindh and Punjab have been incorporated in \nthe  program  design.  The  experiences  of  the  Social  Action  Program  (SAP)  and  the  lessons \nlearned are given in Supplementary Appendix I. The decade-long SAP did not lead to tangible \nimprovements in the delivery of basic social services. The breakdown of governance, where the \npoor were marginalized by limited or no access to public facilities, characterized the SAP period. \nGovernment facilities remained weak, with many facilities cited not functioning because of lack \nof staff, especially teachers and health workers, despite SAP investments.  \n \n34. \nThe  DSSPs  of  Sindh,  Punjab,  and  Balochistan  are  compared  in  Supplementary \nAppendix  J.  Integration  with  other  ADB  programs,  including  DSP  and  BRMP,  is  expected  to \ngenerate  synergy  for  the  success  of  BDSSP  by  ensuring  better  risk  mitigation  measures, \nbuilding  on  the  enabling  environment  created  by  these  programs,  and  prioritizing  issues  for \npolicy  dialogue.  BRMP  supported  the  notification  of  BPGR  2005,  which  will  facilitate  the \nimplementation  of  performance  grants  in  BDSSP.  Advance  actions  to  ensure  timely  TA  have \nemerged  as  critical  to  program  success.  For  policy  dialogue  and  sustained  reforms,  a  robust \nframework  for  devolved  social  services  was  deemed  necessary.  Clear  policies  arrived  at \nthrough  rigorous  policy  dialogue  were  considered  essential,  as  were  clear  agreements  with \nspecific,  achievable,  measurable,  realistic,  and  timely  policy  action  indicators.  It  was  also  felt \nthat the strong incentives for the province had to be part of the program design.  \n \n35. \nThere is an urgent need to fix social service delivery by also addressing the underlying \ngovernance issues. The traditional project emphasis on specific project components has limited \nimpact  on  governance  and  institutional  issues.  Ongoing  investments  in  public  social  services \nmust  be  improved  through  governance  and  institutional  reforms\u2014mainly  through  policy \nreforms\u2014while increasing the scope for effective and well-targeted investments in public social \nsectors.  The  BDSSP  design  will  include  both  policy  reforms  and  additional  investments  in \ndevolved  social  services  through  performance  grants;  the  investments  must  be  targeted  and \ncapable  of  being  tracked  and  measured.  However,  reform  is  a  long-term  endeavor,  and  will \nrequire long-term support from external donor partners, including ADB. The policy and program \nresponses must build on past successful approaches, adapted to a devolved setting. Targeting \nsocial sector investments to reach the poor, in areas of maximum impact on poverty reduction, \nis critical. BDSSP proposes social sector investments through performance grants in areas with \nthe  highest  impact  on  poverty  reduction,  and  includes  public  expenditure  tracking  and \nquantitative  service  delivery  surveys  to  assess  the  quality  of  targeting  and  the  development \nimpact of the program. The problem-tree analysis and options are discussed in Supplementary \nAppendix K. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\n36. \nThe  goal  of  BDSSP  is  to  expedite  Balochistan\u2019s  progress  toward  the  MDGs  and  the \nBPRSP  goals14  in  education,  health,  and  WSS.  The  objectives  of  BDSSP  are  to  (i)  improve \naccess  to  affordable,  efficient,  effective,  and  good-quality  education,  health,  and  WSS  in  the \n                                                 \n14  The  human  development  goals  set  in  Balochistan  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  Paper  are:  (i)  better  access  to \neducation,  with  emphasis  on  technical  and  vocational  education  and  training,  especially  of  girls;  (ii)  provision  of \nsafe  drinking  water;  (iii)  better  health  and  nutrition,  particularly  for  vulnerable  groups  (women  and  children);  (iv) \nhousing,  sanitation,  and  solid  waste  management;  and  (v) use  of  information  technology  to  disseminate  the \nimprovements in health, nutrition, sanitation, and education. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\npublic  and  private  sectors;  (ii)  decrease  inequities  based  on  income,  gender,  ethnicity,  and \ngeography  in  the  education,  health,  and  WSS  sectors;  and  (iii) strengthen  local  governments, \nthe  private  sector,  and  communities  to  improve  social  service  delivery.  These  goals  and \nobjectives will be achieved by enhancing the capacity of the provincial and local governments to \nfulfill their realigned roles and responsibilities in social service delivery. The policy reforms and \nTA  would  lead  to  improved  governance  and  social  service  management.  The  performance \ngrants to local governments would improve access to social services, particularly for the female \nand poor, reducing gender- and income-based disparities and promoting social service equity, \naffordability,  efficiency,  and  sustainability.  The  program  design  and  monitoring  framework  is \ngiven in Appendix 1. \n\nB. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions \n\n1. \n\nPolicy Framework \n\n37. \nThe  conceptual  framework  for  the  policy  reforms  is  adapted  from  the  framework \nproposed in ADB, World Bank, and Department for International Development (DFID) report on \ndevolution  in  Pakistan.15  The  role  of  the  private  sector  in  the  delivery  of  social  services\u2014both \npublicly  and  privately  financed\u2014has  been  increasing  in  importance  (Supplementary  Appendix \nL);  hence,  strengthening  the  role  of  the  private  sector  in  a  devolved  setting  is  included  in  the \nframework as a policy reform outcome. Figure 1 summarizes the conceptual framework and the \nfour major policy reform areas and outcomes. The government of Balochistan has expressed its \ncommitment  to  the  reforms  and  to  increased  social  sector  spending  (Appendix  7).  The  policy \nreform  outcomes,  policy  reform  areas,  and  agreed  actions  are  given  in  the  policy  matrix \n(Appendix 8). The four major policy reform areas are described below. \n\n2. \n\nPolicy Reform Outcomes \n\n38. \nThe  program  has  four  principal  policy  areas:  (i)  provincial  efficiency  incentives; \n(ii) managerial power; (iii) citizens\u2019 voice and empowerment; and (iv) private sector engagement. \n \n39. \nProvincial Efficiency Incentives. These incentives strengthen the relationship between \nprovincial and local governments so that social service delivery is improved through efficiency \ngains  including  budgetary  certainties,  greater  autonomy  in  budget  preparation,  and  incentives \nfor improved fiscal management by local governments.  \n \n40.  Managerial  Power.  This  aims  to  strengthen  the  relationship  between  the  district \ngovernments and the providers of social services. The local governments engage with service \ndelivery  providers  through  managerial  power,  which  reflects  their  ability  to  require  service \nproviders to follow particular standards of behavior and service. The reforms in this area would \ndeal,  among  others,  with  posting  and  transfers,  authority  of  district  governments  over  senior \nstaff, external oversight, and adequate deployment of staff.  \n \n41. \nCitizens\u2019 Voice and Empowerment. The reforms under this heading will strengthen the \nrelationship between citizens and the provincial and district policy makers, and will offer citizens \na channel through which their demands for better social services can be heard. The reforms will \n\n                                                 \n15  The  framework  to  make  social  services  reach  the  poor  was  first  proposed  in  the  World  Bank.  2004.  World \nDevelopment  Report:  Making  Services  Work  for  the  Poor.

The empowerment  of citizens, \nwhich  strengthens  the  relationship  between  the  clients  and  the  providers  of  the  services,  will \nprovide  potential  service  recipients  with  direct  means  to  influence  how  the  services  are \nprovided. The reforms in this area will include citizen dispute resolution and grievance redressal \nmechanisms, and community management of facilities. \n \n42. \nPrivate Sector Engagement. Sector NGOs and voluntary groups are making valuable \ncontributions  in  education  and  health  services,  including  women\u2019s  literacy  and  sensitive  areas \nlike sexual and reproductive health and the control of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and \nHIV/AIDS,  but  their  overall  contribution  is  small  because  of  capacity  constraints.  The  private \nsector is growing rapidly in the urban areas and is the leading provider in the health sector. The \ngovernment has been exploring the possibility of public-private partnerships (PPPs) sponsoring \nNGOs  proposed  by  local  governments  to  support  communities  and  improve  social  service \ndelivery.  At  the  same  time,  the  private  sector  also  needs  support  to  provide  good-quality \nservices more effectively (Supplementary Appendix L). The policy reforms related to PPP and \nprivate  sector  participation  (PSP)  are  closely  linked  to  the  achievement  of  the  social  sector \ntargets set in the BPRSP and strengthened implementation of local government legislation.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\n3. \n\nPolicy Reform Areas \n\na. \n\nProvincial Efficiency Incentives \n\nPRA  1.2:  Autonomy \n\n43. \nPolicy  Reform  Area  (PRA)  1.1:  Budget  Certainty  for  Social  Sectors.  One  of  the \nobjectives of BDSSP is to improve the availability and certainty of funding to local governments \nfor  their  social  sectors.  The  performance  grant  mechanism  under  BPGR  2005  is  to  be \noperationalized.  A  TA  loan  will  support  a  study  on  the  integration  of  the  present  vertical \nprograms in social sectors that are funded or supported by the federal Government, to allow the \ntransfer of funds to local governments. The study is expected to lead to agreed actions and, if \nnecessary,  those  will  be  taken  up  with  the  Government  of  Pakistan.  Further,  the  scope  of \nperformance grants to local governments would be enlarged to include special programs, block \ngrants, and umbrella projects/programs in the devolved social sectors. \n \n44. \nin  Budget  Preparation  and  Administrative  Actions.  \nThe  mandate  of  the  local  governments  to  govern  and  to  plan,  prioritize,  implement,  manage, \nand deliver devolved social services requires them to be thus empowered under the rules and \nprocedures.  Local  governments  must  have  powers  to  approve  and  sanction  schemes.  In \naddition,  the  responsibilities  of  provincial  departments  for  the  devolved  social  sectors  would \nneed  to  be  redesigned  to  conform  to  their  new  role  under  the  provincial-local  relationships \nnecessitated by BLGO  2001. BDSSP, through a TA loan, will support a study on the role and \nresponsibilities  of  the  provincial  departments  (education,  health,  public  health  engineering), \nconsidering  the  need  to  strengthen  their  policy  formulation,  standard  setting,  and  technical \nsupport  and  capacity  building  of  local  governments,  and  will  assist  in  implementing  its \nrecommendations. \n \n45. \nPRA 1.3: Improved Quality of Social Services. This is an area of central concern, and \nBDSSP  would  support  measures  taken  by  the  government  of  Balochistan  to  provide  and \nstrengthen  the  framework  for  quality  improvements  at  the  local  level.  These  measures  would \ninclude  (i)  sector  strategy  and  action  plans,  (ii)  expenditure  allocation  yardsticks,  (iii)  sector-\nspecific  actions  such  as  introducing  a  package  of  essential  services  in  the  health  sector,  and \n(iv) institutional  support  to  build  the  capacity  of  sector  managers  and  service  providers  by \nstrengthening the planning cell in the provincial health department, creating a provincial corps of \ntrainers  to  prepare  master  trainers  at  the  district  level  for  in-service  teacher  training, \nstrengthening the Institute of Public Health in Quetta and the paramedical and nursing training \nschools outside Quetta, and other means. \n\nb.  Managerial Power \n\n46. \nPRA  2.1:  Authority  to  District  Governments  to  Appoint  and  Transfer  Staff. \nPersonnel  management  is  controlled  by  the  government  of  Balochistan,  which  continues  to \nexercise  administrative  powers  over  appointments  and  transfers.  District  government  staff \ncontinues  to  have  direct  links  with  their  administrative  departments  at  the  cost  of  horizontal \nlinkages, coordination, harmony, discipline, and accountability. This situation seriously hampers \nthe  ability  and  performance  of  local  governments.  BDSSP  policy  reform  therefore  involves \ngiving  local  governments  authority  to  appoint  and  transfer  staff  and  to  enforce  efficiency  and \ndiscipline rules in the education, health, and public health engineering departments. \n \n47. \nPRA 2.2: Adequate Deployment of Staff. To ensure adequately staffed facilities and to \nprovide greater accountability at the community level, BDSSP would support the development of \na system of contract appointments for specific facilities in the education and health sectors. The \nappointments,  which  may  involve  hiring  retired  government  servants  on  contract,  cannot  be \nregularized. \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n     \n\n \n\n \n48. \nPRA  2.3:  Improved  Capacities  of  District  Managers  and  Service  Providers.  \nManagement support systems, such as database and management information systems (MIS), \nwill  be  strengthened  in  the  education  and  health  sectors,  particularly  at  the  local  government \nlevel,  and  will  be  developed  for  the  WSS  sector.  An  ongoing  health  MIS  initiative  will  be \nassessed to identify gaps and areas for further support. BDSSP will provide TA for the required \nsystems  strengthening.  Further,  the  BDSSP  TA  will  support  the  development  of  a  system  of \nperformance-linked incentives for sector managers and service delivery staff, and performance \ngrants will fund pilot implementation.  \n \n49. \nAlong  with  the  strengthening  of  management  support  through  the  timely  availability  of \nimproved data, sector managers at the district level will become better able to prepare medium-\nterm and annual work programs and budgets, and undertake financial management monitoring, \nreporting, and audit. BDSSP will provide TA to develop training courses and to conduct training \nat  the  district  level.  The  quality  of  social  services  depends  on  the  capacity  of  the  front-end \nservice  providers,  especially  in  the  case  of  schoolteachers  and  primary  health  care  staff. \nBDSSP  will  support  the  training  of  master  trainers  at  district  headquarters  by  the  provincial \ncorps of trainers developed under the TA. These master trainers will provide in-service training \nat  various  locations  within  the  district  to  schoolteachers,  high-school  head  teachers  in  school \nmanagement, and school supervisors. In the health sector, in-service training according to the \ntraining plan developed under the TA will be supported at the district level. \n\nc. \n\nCitizens\u2019 Voice and Empowerment \n\nlinkages  with  programs  supporting \n\n50. \nPRA  3.1:  Grievance  Redressal  Mechanisms.  BDSSP  will  provide  TA  support  to \ndevelop and institute grievance redressal mechanisms in the provincial and local governments, \nparticularly  at  the  service  delivery  level.  Support  will  be  provided  to  operationalize  the \nmechanisms  envisaged  under  BLGO  2001,  including  complaint  cells.  The  TA  will  help \nstrengthen local government monitoring committees. \n \n51. \nPRA  3.2:  Community  Management  of  Facilities.  The  creation  of  CCBs  to  foster \ncommunity participation in local government and service delivery are envisaged in BLGO 2001, \nand  local  governments  are  obliged  to  provide  25%  of  their  development  funds  to  support  the \nthe  promotion  and \nCCBs.  BDSSP  will  establish \nstrengthening of CCBs. It will provide a TA loan for the drafting of a communication strategy to \npromote  and  strengthen  community  involvement  in  the  management  of  facilities,  and  will \nsupport  the  implementation  of  the  strategy.  In  the  education  sector,  parent-teacher  school \nmanagement  committees  (PTSMCs)  have  been  formed  in  many  schools,  and  their  formation \nand  strengthening  is  being  promoted  under  the  ongoing  Environmental  Sector  Reform \nAssistance (ESRA) program funded by the United States Agency for International Development \n(USAID).  BDSSP  will  develop  linkages  in  the  districts  where  the  ESRA  program  is  being \nimplemented,  and  support  the  process  in  all  other  districts  where  the  program  is  not  being \nimplemented. BDSSP will develop and introduce hospital management boards in district and 50-\nbed hospitals on a pilot basis and will later expand this support to include all district and 50-bed \nhospitals. \n \n52. \nPRA  3.3:  Civil  Society  Monitoring  of  Social  Service  Delivery,  and  Citizen \nOversight.  Citizens\u2019  voice  and  community  empowerment  are  important  features  of  the  local \ngovernment system under BLGO 2001, particularly in the delivery of social services. However, \ncitizens\u2019 monitoring of elected public representatives, as provided under BLGO 2001, is not yet \nwell  established.  BDSSP  will  therefore  facilitate  and  support  the  operationalization  of  citizen \noversight and monitoring programs. First, the BDSSP TA will prepare a program of civil society \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nmonitoring,  look  at  the  various  mechanisms  for  local  government  monitoring  and  citizen \noversight, and implement a system of citizen report cards on a pilot basis in the city district of \nQuetta. The TA will, in addition, support the provincial finance department in introducing public \nexpenditure  tracking  surveys,  and  the  provincial  bureau  of  statistics  in  introducing  quantitative \nservice delivery surveys and validating the results. The provincial and district governments will \nbe  required  to  make  available  to  the  public  all  reports  on  the  surveys  and  the  third-party \nassessment and validation. \n\nd. \n\nPrivate Sector Engagement \n\n53. \nPRA 4.1: Private Sector Participation. BDSSP will provide support under the TA loan \nfor a comprehensive review of policy options for PPP and PSP, and prepare a strategy and plan \nfor  the  consideration  and  approval  of  the  government  of  Balochistan.  The  TA  will  examine \nalternative options for the delivery of health services in sparsely populated areas and implement \nselected options on a pilot basis. In the education sector, the TA will support the development of \nan  action  plan  for  engaging  the  private  sector  in  the  development  of  innovative  teaching \nmaterials.  \n \n54. \nPRA 4.2: Self-Regulation by the Private Sector. To address the issue of the quality of \nprivate sector services, TA support will be made available for the development of a strategy for \nself-regulation by the private sector in education and health, and it\u2019s the implementation of the \nthe \nstrategy  after \nimplementation by the local governments of the approved strategy and plan for PSP and PPP \nprepared  under  the  TA.  Performance  grants  will  also  be  provided  to  support  the  wider \nimplementation of successful initiatives implemented on a pilot basis under the TA. \n\nthrough  performance  grants,  will  support \n\nis  approved.  BDSSP, \n\nit \n\n4. \n\nPerformance Grants \n\n55. \nPerformance  grants  to  eligible  district  governments  and  TMAs  will  be  allocated \naccording to the agreed formula under the provincial finance commission (PFC) award for the \ndistribution  of  resources  between  districts  and  eligible  TMAs.  The  administration  of  the \nperformance grants will follow the implementation arrangements under BPGR 2005, as already \nagreed  under  BRMP.  The  performance  grants  will  support  district  governments  and  eligible \nTMAs  in  accelerating  progress  toward  the  MDGs  in  education,  health,  and  WSS,  within  the \nbroad  policy  reform  framework  agreed  with  the  government  of  Balochistan.  The  performance \ngrants  will  be  funded  from  two  sources:  a  $65  million  ADF  loan  and  a  $5  million  ADF  grant. \nThese grants will be restricted to the education, health, and water supply and sanitation sectors. \nThe district governments and the TMAs will have flexibility to allocate funds from the $65 million \nADF loan among these three sectors according to local needs as long as each sector receives \nat least 20% of the allocations. This will enable the local governments to adopt more effective, \ndemand-driven, and participatory planning to identify gaps and rationalize and develop services \nwith full ownership of the interventions decided by them. However, to ensure balanced progress \nin an accelerated manner toward the MDGs and to enable implementation of the policy reforms, \ncomponents  targeting  priority  investments  in  education,  health,  and  WSS  within  the  policy \nreform  framework  have  been  defined  (Appendix  9).  A  $5  million  ADF  grant  for  HIV/AIDS  and \ninfectious diseases will support a specific sub-component of the health sector (sub-component \n07B  in  Appendix  9)  to  prevent  HIV/AIDS  and  to  prevent  and  treat  malaria,  tuberculosis,  and \nother infectious diseases.  \n\nC. \n\nImportant Features \n\nBDSSP  is  the  first  ADB-supported  program  loan  for  the  social  sectors  in  Balochistan. \n56. \nGiven past experiences, the importance of supporting governance reforms in the social sectors \ncannot  be  underestimated.  This  aspect  assumes  greater  significance  in  the  context  of \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n     \n\n \n\ndevolution  and  the  local  government  structures  introduced  under  BLGO  2001.  BDSSP  can \ntherefore be seen as primarily a governance program for the devolved social sectors that aims \nto  build  local  government  responsibility,  accountability,  and  capacity  while  at  the  same  time \nimproving  intergovernmental  frameworks  to  enable  local  governments  to  exercise  their \nmandates  under  BLGO  2001.  Thus,  local  governments  would  be  able  to  effectively  plan  and \nefficiently implement and manage social services according to their own needs and priorities. \n \n57. \nBDSSP  can  be  seen  as  phase  three  of  ongoing  support  to  the  government  of \nBalochistan.  The  DSP,  in  the  first  phase,  provided  support  for  the  strengthening  of  local \ngovernments, and laid out the institutional context. BRMP, in the second phase, supported and \nstrengthened  resource  management,  and  initiated  the  strengthening  of  social  sector  delivery. \nBDSSP  will  continue  the  reforms  of  DSP  and  BRMP,  and  create  synergistic  linkages  with  the \nearlier  reforms.  BDSSP  policy  reforms  have  been  designed  through  an  iterative  process \ninvolving  the  provincial  government,  local  governments,  civil  society,  service  providers,  and \nclients.  The  performance  grants  were  designed  with  the  full  participation  of  the  local \ngovernments  at  all  levels:  district,  tehsil,  and  unions.  Participatory  meetings  at  the  district  and \nTMA levels were attended by elected representatives, sector managers of the education, health, \nand WSS sectors, and front-end service providers. Further dialogues were held at the provincial \nlevel  with  the  participation  of  provincial  officials,  civil  society,  sector  NGOs,  and  local \ngovernment functionaries.  \n \n58. \nBDSSP  has  special  provisions  for  promoting  gender  equity  and  the  participation  of  the \npoor,  the  vulnerable  and  marginalized  groups.  Particular  attention  has  been  focused  on \nimproving  access  to  education  for  girls  and  to  providing  and  expanding  reproductive  health \nfacilities. The expansion of the pool of female teachers, female health service providers (LHVs, \ncommunity  midwives,  paramedics)  supported  by  the  program  is  an  integral  part  of  the  design \nstrategy. Further, the improvement of water supply and the focus on sanitation at the household \nand community level will be of benefit to women by reducing the drudgery associated with water \ncollection and maintaining hygiene. BDSSP has built-in synergies in its TA component and also \nprovides  for  linkages  with  ongoing  initiatives  aimed  at  supporting  devolution  and  the  local \ngovernment system.  \n \nD. \n\nADF IX Grant for HIV/AIDS and Infectious Diseases Control \n\n59. \nCombating high morbidity and mortality due to malaria and tuberculosis, preventing the \nspread of HIV/AIDS in high-risk groups, and raising general awareness of HIV/AIDS among the \nlargely  illiterate  population  of  Balochistan  will  be  challenging  and  resource-intensive.  The \nvarious  aspects  of  the  challenge  are  described  in  Appendix  5,  while  the  serious  resource \nconstraints that hamper the measures against HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases are given \nin  Appendix  2.  The  $5  million  HIV/AIDS  and  infectious  diseases  grant  from  ADB\u2019s  ADF \nresources will finance specific components of health sector performance grants that will have a \nhigh impact on the prevention of HIV/AIDS, and on the prevention and treatment of malaria and \ntuberculosis.  As  described  in  Appendix  9,  this  grant  will  finance  specific  components  to \n(i) increase  awareness  of  HIV/AIDS  and  measures  to  control  its  spread;  (ii)  improve  case \ndetection  of  tuberculosis  and  increase  access  to  treatment,  mainly  through  directly  observed \ntherapy;  (iii)  control  malaria  vectors,  and  detect  and  treat  malaria  cases;  and  (iv)  control \nchildhood infectious diseases by increasing access to the expanded program on immunization. \nThe  grant  outputs  and  outcomes  will  be  carefully  monitored  through  the  routine  reporting \nmechanisms  of  the  program  loan  and  through  public  expenditure  tracking  surveys  and \nquantitative service delivery surveys. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nE. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n60. \nIn support of the program, the Government of Pakistan has requested a program loan of \n$65 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s special fund resources (ADF), an ADF grant of $5 million, and \na  program  loan  of  $130  million  equivalent  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  (OCR) \n(Table 1).  The  loans  will  support  the  policy  reforms  described  in  the  development  policy  letter \nand  policy  matrix.  The  cost  of  adjustment  is  estimated  at  $261  million  equivalent  to  include \nsupport for provincial efficiency incentives, the strengthening of managerial powers in the district \ngovernments,  the  promotion  of  citizens\u2019  voice  and  empowerment,  and  private  sector \nparticipation  and  public-private  partnership    (Appendix  2).  The  high-interest  debt  refinancing \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  OCR  will  create  fiscal  space,  and  make  available  additional  sustainable  social \nsector financing.  \n \n\nTable 1: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nPurpose \n \nSource \nTo meet program adjustments \nA.

The \nOCR  program  loan  of  $130  million  will  have  a  term  of  15  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  \n3  years;  an  interest  rate  to  be  determined  according  to  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)\u2013based  lending  facility  (LBL),  including  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  year;  and \nother  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Program  Agreements.  The \nGovernment of Pakistan has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under \nADB\u2019s  LBL  facility  on  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  it  made  these \nchoices  independently  and  without  relying  on  any  communication  or  advice  from  ADB.  The \nGovernment  of  Pakistan  will  transfer  the  loan  to  the  government  of  Balochistan  on  the  same \nterms and conditions, but will bear the foreign currency risk.  \n \n62. \nThe loans are in support of policy reforms that address long-standing issues in the social \nsector  and  propose  major  sustainable  adjustments  in  the  organization  of  devolved  social \nservices to improve the impact of the services and the participation of the poor. The reforms are \ncritically  linked  to  and  complement  the  agreed  reforms  that  are  being  implemented  under \nBRMP. The policy loans are justified by the content and expected impact of the policy reforms \nand the associated adjustment costs.  \n\nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProgram Management \n\nThe planning and development department (P&DD) of Balochistan will be the Executing \n63. \nAgency (EA) of the program. The organization structure for program implementation is given in \nAppendix 10 and will consist of: (i) program specific mechanisms, (ii) provincial arrangements, \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n     \n\n \n\nand  (iii)  arrangements  at  the  district,  TMA,  and  community  levels.  A  key  challenge  will  be  to \nintegrate the performance reviews and management decisions of the steering and management \nbodies  for  DSP,  BRMP,  and  other  ADB-supported  programs/projects  in  Balochistan,  whose \nmandates  and  memberships  overlap  with  those  of  the  BDSSP,  and  thus  gain  efficiencies  in \nimplementation. \n\na. \n\nProgram-Specific Mechanisms \n\n64. \nProgram  Steering  Committee  (PSC).  The  PSC  will  (i) give  policy  guidance  to  the \nprogram;  (ii)  supervise  program  activities;  (iii)  approve  the  annual  work  plan  for  the  TA \ncomponent and its budget; (iv) monitor the performance of the provincial program office (PPO), \nthe program units (PUs), and the international and domestic consultants; and (v) ensure BDSSP \ncoordination with DSP, BRMP, and other programs and projects. The PSC will be chaired by the \nadditional  chief  secretary  (development),  with  the  secretary  of  finance  as  alternate  chair,  and \nwill  have  the  following  as  members:  the  chief  economist,  the  secretaries  of  education,  health, \npublic  health  engineering,  services  and  general  administration,  and  local  government,  and  the \nBDSSP coordinator (PSC secretary). Program managers from DSP and BRMP will join the PSC \nas observers.  \n \n65. \nProvincial  Program  Office  (PPO).  The  PPO  will  (i)  plan,  coordinate,  facilitate,  and \nmonitor  BDSSP  implementation;  (ii)  coordinate  activities,  particularly  capacity  building,  with \nDSP, BRMP, and other programs; (iii) interact, communicate, and coordinate policy reforms with \nprovincial departments, and the implementation of BDSSP performance grants with the finance \ndepartment  (and,  where  required,  the  PFC);  (iv)  institute  appropriate  monitoring  mechanisms \nthrough  the  bureau  of  statistics,  finance  department  (public  expenditure  tracking  surveys  and \nreporting from local governments), and third-party validation; (v) prepare and publish as public \ndocuments  reports  documenting,  analyzing,  and  reviewing  BDSSP  progress  and  results; \n(vi) manage contracts awarded at the provincial level; and (vii) liaise with district governments, \nselected TMAs, and provincial departments through their PUs in the capacity-building activities \nunder BDSSP.  \n \n66. \nThe  provincial  program  office  will  comprise  provincial  government  (counterpart)  staff \nposted for the duration of the program and BDSSP-contracted staff recruited under the TA loan. \nThe  government  (counterpart)  staff  will  comprise  a  full-time  program  coordinator  (basic  pay \nscale [BPS] 19 or 20), who will be assisted by  a program officer (BPS 17 or 18), two full-time \nprogram  assistants  (at  least  BPS  15),  and  other  supporting  staff  as  required.  The  BDSSP-\ncontracted  staff  will  comprise:  (i)  a  senior  program  officer,  (ii)  a  reporting  officer,  (iii)  a \ncoordination  assistant,  (iv)  two  database  operators,  (v)  a  finance  officer,  and  (vi)  an  accounts \nassistant.  Appendix  10  shows  the  coordination  and  linkages  with  PSC,  PUs,  and  district \ncommittees.  \n \n67. \nThe government (counterpart) staff will be part of the government contribution for the TA \nloan  as  approved  in  the  government  project  document  (PC  II),  which  provides  for  their \nallowances, travel, and per diem. The government will also provide office accommodation and \nprocure a vehicle for the program. BDSSP contract staff will be financed under the TA loan. In \naddition,  the  capital  cost  of  equipment  and  furniture,  and  operating  costs  (supplies,  utilities, \ncommunication, and occasional vehicle rental, where necessary), will be financed under the TA \nloan. International and domestic consultants will be recruited to support the PPO.  \n \n68. \nDistrict  and  TMA  Program  Committee.  A  district  program  committee  (DPC)  to  be \nformed  in  each  district  government  will  oversee  the  implementation  of  (i)  the  policy  reforms \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nunder BDSSP insofar as they relate to the district governments, (ii) the TA support, and (iii) the \nperformance  grants  under  BDSSP.  The  committee  will  meet  at  least  once  a  month  (or  more \noften if needed) to ensure full compliance with (i) the grant procedures specified in BPGR 2005, \n(ii) the instructions of the provincial finance department under the rules issued from time to time, \n(iii) the  specific  conditions  for  the  grants,  and  (iv)  the  terms  of  the  partnership  agreement  with \nthe  provincial  government.  The  DPC  will  be  headed  by  the  district  nazim,  with  the  district \ncoordination  officer  as  the  alternate  chair,  and  will  have  as  members  the  executive  district \nofficers  (EDOs)  of  the  social  sector  group  of  offices  (education,  health,  public  health \nengineering) and the EDO for finance and planning as secretary. It will fulfill its mandate through \nthe PU setup in the office of the EDO for finance and planning. TMA Program Committee will be \nestablished  within  2  weeks  of  the  date  a  TMA  has  been  declared  eligible  for  the  performance \ngrant. The TMA program committee will be headed by the tehsil nazim with the tehsil municipal \nofficer  as  the  alternate  chair  and  the  tehsil  (infrastructure  and  services)  as  member-secretary. \nThe  committee  will  oversee  all  matters  in  connection  with  the  implementation  of  (i)  the  policy \nreform under the Program in as far as related to the TMA, and (ii) the performance grants.  \n \nProgram  Units  (PUs)  will  be  set  up  in  (i)  the  finance  department,  (ii)  the  bureau  of \n69. \nstatistics, (iii) the planning and finance office in each of the 28 districts16 and (iv) TMAs selected \nto receive BDSSP grants. The PUs will comprise government (counterpart) staff posted for the \nduration of the program and BDSSP contracted staff recruited under the TA loan. The PU in the \nfinance  department  will  be  headed  by  the  additional  secretary  of  the  department,  who  will  be \nassisted  by  a  program  officer,  a  program  assistant,  and  supporting  staff  as  required.  In  the \nbureau  of  statistics  the  PU  will  be  headed  by  the  bureau  director,  who  will  be  assisted  by  a \nprogram  officer  and  an  accounts  assistant.  In  both  the  finance  department  and  bureau  of \nstatistics PUs, the program officer and assistants will be financed under the TA loan.  \n \n70. \nIn each district government the PU will be headed by the EDO for finance and planning, \nwho will be assisted by a program assistant, an office support worker, and a driver. Under the \ndirection  and  with  the  approval  of  the  district  program  committee,  the  district  PU  head  will \nmaintain  contacts  and  links  with  the  provincial  program  office  as  necessary  for  the \nimplementation of the policy reforms (insofar as they relate to the district government) and the \nimplementation of the TA. The provincial finance department will prescribe the procedures to be \nfollowed by the TMAs selected for BDSSP performance grants. The TMA PU will be headed by \ntehsil  municipal  officer  and  assisted  by  a  program  officer.  The  TMA  PU  will  implement  the \neligible activities under the performance grants in their respective tehsils.  \n \nFunding and logistical support from the TA loan will be provided to the program units. TA \n71. \nand  capacity  building  will  be  provided  by  international  and  domestic  consultants,  and  contract \nstaff  recruited  under  the  TA  loan.  The  functions  of  PUs  are  described  in  Appendix  10  (Table \nA10.1). \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n72. \nThe program support and policy reforms will  be implemented over 3 years, and will be \ncompleted by 30 June 2009. The performance grant support from counterpart funds generated \nout of the program loan and the grant will be implemented over a period of 4 years, until June \n2010. \n\n                                                 \n16 The 28th district was announced in 2005. All previous references prior to 2005 refer to only 27 districts. \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n     \n\n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement  \n\n73. \nThe  program  loans  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  standard  procedures  for  procurement  and \ndisbursement.  The  loan  proceeds  will  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange  cost,  excluding  local \nduties  and  taxes,  of  eligible  items  procured  from  ADB  member  countries,  which  must  have \nproduced  the  items,  excluding  listed  ineligible  items  (Appendix  11)  and  imports  financed  by \nother  multilateral  and  bilateral  sources.  All  procurements  under  the  program  loan  will  be \nundertaken  through  normal  commercial  practices  for  the  private  sector  or  the  federal \nGovernment\u2019s  prescribed  procurement  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB,  while  taking  economy \nand  efficiency  into  account.  Program  loan  and  grant  disbursements  will  be  made  in  line  with \nADB\u2019s simplified disbursement procedures and audit requirements.17 To withdraw the loan and \ngrant  proceeds,  the  Government  of  Pakistan  must  certify  that  the  value  of  eligible  imports \nexceeds  the  amount  of  ADB\u2019s  projected  disbursements  under  the  program  loans  in  a  given \nperiod. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy \nof the certification from the government.  \n \n\n4. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n \n74. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998) was explained to and discussed with the Government \nof  Pakistan,  government  of  Balochistan  and  the  Planning  and  Development  Department  (the \nexecuting  agency).  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these \nefforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations \nand  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Program.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n\n5. \n\nCounterpart Funds and Tranches \n\nlocal  government  expenditures \n\nin  education,  health  care,  and  WSS \n\nThe counterpart funds generated from the ADF program loan and grant will be used to \n75. \nfinance \nthrough \nperformance grants until June 2010. The performance grants will be implemented according to \nBPGR  2005.  The  $65  million  ADF  program  loan  and  the  $5  million  ADF  grant  will  each  be \nreleased  in  two  tranches.  The  first  tranche  ($22.5  million  of  the  ADF  program  loan  and  $2.5 \nmillion  of  the  ADF  grant)  is  expected  to  be  released  by  July  2006  upon  fulfillment  of  the  first-\ntranche  policy  actions.  The  second  tranche  ($42.5  million  of  the  ADF  program  loan  and  $2.5 \nmillion of the ADF grant) is expected to be released by July 2008 upon fulfillment of the second-\ntranche policy actions. The counterpart funds generated from the entire OCR loan will be used \nto restructure the high-interest debt of the government of Balochistan, and the fiscal space thus \ncreated will provide current budget support in devolved social sectors and will be transferred to \nthe  local  governments  under  the  PFC  award.  Like  the  ADF  program  loan  and  ADF  grant,  the \nOCR loan will be released in two tranches, contingent on the fulfillment of policy actions: $110 \nmillion  once  the  first-tranche  policy  actions  are  fulfilled,  and  $20  million  upon  fulfillment  of  the \nsecond-tranche policy actions. \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n76. \nThe government of Balochistan must open an account with the State Bank of Pakistan to \nreceive all loan proceeds. The account must be established, operated, and managed to ADB\u2019s \n\n                                                 \n17 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements of Program Loans. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19\n\nsatisfaction.  The  local  governments  receiving  BDSSP  performance  grants  will  maintain \naccounting,  reporting,  and  auditing  procedures  as  prescribed  in  BPGR  2005.  Among  the \nreporting requirements will be an annual report from PFC on the performance grants.  \n\n7. \n\nProgram Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n77. \nTo  measure  progress  and  assess  compliance  with  targets,  the  government  of \nBalochistan and ADB have agreed to certain specific actions indicated in the policy matrix, loan \nagreements,  and  the  program  administration  memorandum.  ADB  and  the  government  will \nmaintain  a  continuing  dialogue  throughout  program  implementation.  To  monitor  BDSSP \nimplementation, the government will prepare quarterly progress reports and an annual report on \nprogram implementation and submit these reports to ADB. The quarterly and annual progress \nreports will track the implementation of policy reforms, progress on the grant for the control of \nHIV/AIDS and infectious diseases, the TA under the program, performance grant utilization by \nthe  local  governments,  and  general  improvements  in  administrative  and  financial  parameters \nincluding  social  sector  budget  allocations  and  utilization,  and  staff  recruitment,  vacancies,  and \nfrequency  of  transfers.  Attached  to  the  annual  report  will  be  the  PFC\u2019s  annual  report  on \nperformance grants.  \n \n78. \nThe  monitoring  and  reporting  on  the  performance  grants  will  follow  the  procedures \nprescribed in BPGR 2005. The government of Balochistan will implement, with TA loan support, \nprovincial  expenditure  tracking  surveys  and  quantitative  service  delivery  surveys.  Third-party \nassessment and validation of the surveys will be made by contracted NGOs. The surveys and \nthird-party  assessments  will  assist  in  monitoring  and  evaluating  the  program  outcomes  and \nimpact. \n\n8. \n\nProgram Review \n\n79. \nThe government of Balochistan, acting through the PPO, will prepare necessary reports \nto  document,  analyze,  and  review  BDSSP  progress  and  results.  The  reports  will  include \nquarterly progress reports and annual reports. The quarterly reports will be submitted within 6 \nweeks  of  the  end  of  each  quarter.  The  annual  report  will  be  submitted  within  3  months  of  the \nend of each year. The government will also submit an inception report within 2 months of loan \neffectiveness,  and  a  program  completion  report  within  3  months  of  the  completion  of  the \nProgram.  \n \n80. \nADB  will  conduct  at  least  on  a  semi-annual  basis  review  missions  jointly  with  the \ngovernment  of  Balochistan  to  evaluate  compliance  with  the  conditions  and  advise  on  actions \nrequired  to  keep  program  implementation  on  course.  Among  others,  the  joint  review  missions \nwill review BDSSP coordination and collaboration with other ongoing reform programs including \nDSP  and  BRMP.  To  encourage  a  policy  dialogue  approach  to  the  review  process,  the \ngovernment of Balochistan, local governments, and ADB will also conduct a joint annual review \nof  the  program.  The  government  of  Balochistan  and  ADB  will  also  conduct  a  comprehensive \nmidterm review mission in the second year of program implementation to evaluate progress on \npolicy reforms and the investments under BDSSP performance grants. \n\nV. \n\nPROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT \n\n81. \nObjectives.  The  TA  aims  to  (i)  support  sector  work  on  specific  policy  reforms  and \nimprove  sector  performance;  (ii)  strengthen  sector  planning,  management,  and  monitoring;  \n(iii)  develop  the  governance  capacity  of  local  governments  and  communities  in  the  social \nservices;  and  (iv)  support  the  implementation  of  policy  reforms,  the  performance  grants \nmechanism, and capacity-building activities under BDSSP. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n     \n\n \nA. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n \n\n82. \nSector  Policy  Reform.  The  TA  project  will  support  the  PPO  in  undertaking  studies  to \nimplement the policy reforms envisaged in the agreed policy matrix. The PPO will process the \nstudies,  and  coordinate  review  and  approval  by  the  relevant  departments  and  the  necessary \nfollow-up  actions.  The  relevant  sector  departments  of  the  government  of  Balochistan  will \nmaintain  close  contact  with  the  consultants  working  on  the  studies  and  provide  them  with \naccess  to  required  information  and  data,  as  well  as  timely  review  of  and  comments  on  their \nwork. \n \n83. \nSector  Planning,  Management,  and  Monitoring.  The  TA  project  will  support  sector \nplanning and the development and improvement of management and monitoring systems. This \nwill  include  the  development  of  sector  strategies  in  education  and  health  and  a  policy  and \nstrategy  to  promote  sanitation  and  hygiene;  the  preparation  and  approval  of  expenditure \nyardsticks; the strengthening of MIS in the education and health sectors and the development of \na database for the WSS sector; and other support in sector planning and management. \n \n84. \nNongovernment organizations (NGOs) or firms will be contracted by BDSSP to support \nand  assist  the  provincial  and  district  governments  and  selected  TMAs.  At  the  provincial  level, \nNGOs  will  be  contracted  to  (i)  support  the  bureau  of  statistics  in  carrying  out  service  delivery \nsurveys  (QSDS);  (ii)  support  the  finance  department  in  public  expenditure  tracking  surveys \n(PETS);  and  (iii)  conduct  third-party  validation  of  the  process  and  results  of  the  surveys.  The \ncontract  at  the  district  level  will  be  between  the  district  government,  the  provincial  program \noffice, and the NGO.  \n \n85. \nLocal  Government  and  Community-Based  Governance.  The  TA  will  support  the \nbuilding  of  governance  capacity  through  the  PPO  activities  implemented  by  consultants, \ncontracted NGOs, and provincial training institutions, and also through linkages to other reform \nprograms  like  DSP  and  the  USAID-funded  ESRA  programs.  Capacity-building  support  will  be \nprovided to sector managers in the districts in the preparation of medium-term and annual plans \nand  budgets,  financial  management,  monitoring,  and  reporting.  Supervisors  and  front-end \nservice  delivery  staff  will  be  provided  with  in-service  training.  Support  will  be  provided  either \ndirectly  or  through  linkages  with  other  ongoing  initiatives  to  relevant  stakeholders  to  promote \ncommunity  management  of  social  service  facilities.  A  program  of  civil  society  monitoring  of \nsocial  services  will  be  prepared,  and  selected  initiatives  will  be  implemented  on  a  pilot  basis \nunder the TA loan. \n \n86. \nBDSSP  Implementation  Support.  This  includes  (i)  implementation  support  to  PPO; \n(ii) implementation support to PUs in the provincial finance department, the bureau of statistics, \nand  all  district  governments  and  TMAs  participating  in  the  DSSP;  and  (iii)  ad  hoc  recruitment \nsupport  to  PUs  and  local  governments,  to  fill  their  need  for  experts  for  various  aspects  of \nprogram implementation and capacity building.  \n \nB. \n\nCost Estimates, Implementation Arrangements, and Other Aspects \n\n87. \nCost Estimates and Financing Plan. The TA project is estimated to cost $6.25 million \nequivalent,  comprising  $0.18  million  in  foreign  exchange  costs  and  $6.07  million  in  local \ncurrency  costs.  The  Government  of  Pakistan  has  requested  a  loan  of  $5  million  from  ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources (ADF) to help finance the TA project. The loan will have a term of 32 \nyears,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  an  interest  rate  of  1%  per  year  during  the  grace \nperiod and 1.5% thereafter; and other terms and conditions set forth in the draft TA Loan and \n\n \n\n\f \n\n21\n\nProject Agreements. The government of Balochistan will contribute $1.25 million, which is 20% \nof  the  total  TA  project  cost.  The  contribution  will  be  in  the  form  of  office  accommodation, \ncounterpart  staff,  travel  allowances  and  per  diems  for  government  counterparts,  and  vehicle \nprovision  and  operation  for  the  PPO  and  PUs  at  the  provincial  and  district  government  levels. \nThe  detailed  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan  are  given  in  Appendix  12  and  Supplementary \nAppendix M on the TA. The Government of Pakistan will transfer the loan to the government of \nBalochistan  on  the  same  terms  and  conditions,  except  for  foreign  currency  risk,  which  will  be \nborne by the Government of Pakistan. \n \n88. \nExecuting  Agency  and  Implementation  Period.  The  provincial  P&DD  will  be  the \nExecuting  Agency.  The  organization  structure  for  implementation  is  similar  to  that  for  the \nprogram  loan.  The  TA  loan  is  intended  to  facilitate  program  reforms  and  would  therefore  be \nintegrated  with  the  program  loan  implementation.  The  government  of  Balochistan  will  strive  to \nintegrate common activities and processes among ADB-supported programs/projects including \nDSP and BRMP, and thereby gain efficiencies in the implementation, especially in procurement \nand consultant selection. The TA will be implemented over a period of slightly more than 4 years \nand  will  be  completed  by  June  2010,  a  year  later  than  the  program  loan  completion  date \n(June 2009). The training programs will be supervised by the PPO and the training materials will \nbe prepared by PPO with the help of consultants. The logistics for the training program at the \nprovincial  and  district  levels  will  be  managed  by  local  institutes,  which  have  organized  similar \ntrainings  in  the  past  and  have  large  physical  and  human  infrastructure  that  can  be  efficiently \ndeployed for program training.  \n \n89. \nProcurement and Consultant Selection. All ADB-financed procurement for the TA will \nbe  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Contact  packages  for  $500,000 \nequivalent or less will follow local competitive bidding or, as acceptable, international shopping \nas described in Chapter III of the Guidelines for Procurement. Minor packages costing $100,000 \nequivalent  or  less  may  be  procured  through  local  competitive  bidding  or  direct  purchase  in \naccordance  with  standard  procedures  of  the  government  of  Balochistan,  acceptable  to  ADB.  \nThe  training  programs  at  the  provincial  and  district-level  would  be  managed  by  local  training \ninstitutes to be selected following procedures acceptable to ADB.  \n \nConsultants and consulting firms will be recruited under ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \n90. \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the recruitment of local consultants. \nConsultants will be hired both individually and through consulting firms. The consulting services \nrequired will include (i) 8.3 person-months of international consultants for specific tasks; and (ii) \n104  person-months  of  domestic  consultants  to  support  (a) the  development  of  a  training  plan, \nmodules, and materials, and to train trainers, PTSMCs, water user committees, head teachers, \nschool supervisors, health service providers, and the provincial health department planning cell; \n(b) capacity building of social sector managers and service providers, women members of local \ncouncils,  and  district  staff  in  MIS  and  monitoring;  (c)   the  training  in  planning  and  modern \nfinancial management systems for finance and planning office staff and social sector managers \nof the district government; and (d) the conduct of surveys and studies for the policy reforms. In \naddition,  contract  staff  will  be  hired  for  a  total  of  4,242  person-months  at  the  provincial  and \ndistrict  levels  to  help  in  program  implementation  at  the  provincial  program  office  and  the \nprovincial and district PUs. \n \n91. \nDisbursement,  Auditing,  and  Reporting.  The  government  of  Balochistan  will  open  a \ndollar imprest account with the National Bank of Pakistan within 15 days of loan effectiveness. \nThe  imprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  according  to \nADB\u2019s Handbook on Loan Disbursements, as amended from time to time. ADB will advance 6 \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n     \n\n \n\nmonths  of  estimated  expenditures  or  10%  of  the  loan  amount,  whichever  is  lower,  into  the \nimprest account. The ADB statement of expenditure procedure will be used when reimbursing \neligible expenditures or liquidating and replenishing the imprest account for individual payments \nof not more than $50,000. The government of Balochistan will maintain separate accounts and \nrecords  for  the  imprest  fund  and  TA  loan  expenditures  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting \nprinciples.  The  government  will  have  those  accounts  and  records  audited  by  external  auditors \naccording  to  standards  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  annual  audit  report  will  comprise  the  audit \nfindings  on  the  imprest  accounts  and  statement  of  expenditure  (SOE)  procedures,  and  a \nseparate audit opinion on the use of the imprest accounts and SOE procedure. Certified copies \nof  the  audit  report  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  within  6  months  after  the  close  of  the  fiscal  year. \nThe reporting and review of the TA loan will be combined with that of the program loan and will \nfollow  the  procedures  laid  down  for  the  program  loan.  The  quarterly,  annual  and  TA  loan \ncompletion  reports,  included  with  the  reports  on  the  program  loan,  will  include  a  summary \nfinancial report on the TA loan. \n \n\nVI. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nProgram Benefits \n\nInstitutionalized  Planning.  Social  sector  planning  has  so  far  been  largely  ad  hoc, \n92. \nnonparticipatory,  and  non-transparent.  The  social  sector  functionaries  assigned  to  the  districts \nhave  no  planning  and  budgeting  capacity  in  the  past.  Among  the  BDSSP  policy  reforms  are \nempowering  local  government  functionaries  and  providing  TA  support  in  developing  strategic \nplans, promoting public-private partnerships, developing self-regulation by the private sector at \nthe provincial level, and building the capacity of social sector managers in local governments to \ninstitutionalize  district  planning  and  programming  and  develop  management  capacity.  BDSSP \nwill work closely with BRMP and establish synergy with other ongoing reform programs like DSP \nand the USAID-funded ESRA program. \n \n93. \nPerformance  Grants.  BDSSP  will  increase  funding  for  the  social  services  through \nperformance grant transfers under the BPGR 2005 promulgated by government of Balochistan. \nThe performance grants are designed to enable local governments to provide a flexible, needs-\nbased response to local conditions, adopt an effective demand-driven and participatory planning \nprocess to identify service gaps, and rationalize and develop services with full ownership of the \ninterventions  decided  by  them.  At  the  same  time,  the  grants  and  sub-grants  target  priority \ninvestments in the social sectors in accordance with the provincial policy frameworks to ensure \nbalanced progress in an accelerated manner toward the MDGs and the BDSSP policy reforms. \nThe TA will assist in developing the capacity of local governments to effectively plan, implement, \nand manage their development activities. \n \n94. \nPro-poor  Services.  BDSSP  interventions  especially  target  the  needs  of  the  most \nvulnerable,  including  women  and  the  poor.  The  provision  of  merit  scholarships  and  basic \namenities  in  girls\u2019  schools  will  improve  access  to  education  for  girls.  Similarly,  trained  lady \nhealth  volunteers  and  female  doctors  in  health-care  facilities  would  provide  poor  women  with \nbetter  maternal  health  care.  Performance  grant  funding  to  local  governments  for  basic  social \nservices and the introduction of a package of minimum essential services will especially benefit \nthe poor and vulnerable.  \n \n95. \nPublic-Private  Partnerships  and Community  Involvement.  The  BDSSP  TA  will  help \nthe  government  of  Balochistan  develop  a  strategy  and  action  plan  to  promote  public-private \n\n \n\n\f \n\n23\n\npartnerships  in  social  service  delivery;  innovate  improvements  in  the  quality,  access,  and \ndelivery  of  social  services;  and  develop  and  implement  a  self-regulatory  mechanism  for  the \nprivate sector. Performance grants to local governments will support the implementation of the \nstrategy  developed  under  the  TA  and  promote  community  and  private  sector  initiatives  in  the \ndelivery of services to hard-to-reach, sparsely populated areas.  \n\nB. \n\nImpacts \n\n96. \nSocial  Impact.  BDSSP  will  further  Balochistan\u2019s  progress  toward  the  MDGs  and  the \nsocial sector targets defined in the BPRSP. Initiatives aimed at improving access to education \nwould,  in  the  long  run,  help  increase  net  enrollment  in  and  encourage  completion  of  primary \nschool,  and  help  reduce  the  gender  gap  in  enrollment  and  completion  rates.  Similarly,  better \naccess  to  health  services  would  help  reduce  the  number  of  underweight  children,  and  lower \nchild mortality and maternal mortality rates. The availability of basic sanitation facilities and the \nprovision  of  safe  drinking  water  would  improve  living  conditions,  reduce  the  incidence  of \ndisease, and ultimately assist in raising the productivity of the population (Appendix 13).  \n \nGender  Impact.  BDSSP  can  improve  the  quality  of  women\u2019s  lives  and  lay  the \n97. \ngroundwork  for  greater  autonomy  for  women  in  both  the  public  and  private  spheres. \nInterventions targeting girls will accelerate progress toward increased enrollment and continued \neducation for girls at all levels of schooling. An increase in the number of women with secondary \neducation  would  also  advance  their  economic  independence  and  empowerment,  and  also \nreduce infant mortality. Increasing the capacity of female elected representatives would enable \nthem to be actively involved and have their voice heard in the management and monitoring of \npublic service facilities. In general, women\u2019s participation in public affairs would be strengthened \n(Supplementary Appendix N).  \n \n98. \nInstitutional  Impact.  BDSSP  will  strengthen  the  local  government  system.  Its  policy \nreforms  will  assist  the  government  of  Balochistan  in  defining  the  new  role  of  provincial  social \nsector  departments  under  the  changed  relationships  prescribed  in  BLGO  2001.  BDSSP  will \nassist  in  and  provide  linkages  with  ongoing  activities  to  support  the  capacity  building  of  local \ncouncilors, especially women councilors, to make them better able to effectively plan, manage, \nand  implement  initiatives  to  improve  service  delivery.  It  will  further  institutionalize  community \nand  civil  society  involvement  in  local  government  affairs,  particularly  through  strengthened \nmonitoring  by  elected  representatives  and  civil  society,  and,  community  involvement  in  the \nmanagement  of  social  services  through  CCBs,  PTSMCs,  hospital  management  boards,  and \nother innovative mechanisms to institutionalize citizens\u2019 voice and empowerment.  \n \n99. \nthrough \nImpact.  By  enabling \nperformance grants, to spend more than they have been doing on education, health, and water \nsupply and sanitation, BDSSP will help gain greater access for the poor and vulnerable to basic \nsocial  services.  BDSSP,  even  in  a  small  way,  will  help  open  up  employment  and  income \nopportunities  and  create  human  and  physical  assets  particularly  in  the  remote  and  sparsely \npopulated  areas,  through  local  recruitment  support  to  local  private  service  providers  in  setting \nup  service  delivery  outlets.  Public-private  partnerships  will  also  facilitate  the  creation  of \nproductive opportunities (Supplementary Appendix O). \n \n100.  Environmental Impact. The program loan is classified as environmental category B on \nthe  basis  of  the  environmental  assessment  of  the  proposed  BDSSP  carried  out  to  identify \npotential environmental outcomes and measures to prevent or mitigate adverse environmental \nimpacts. The environmental assessment of the four policy interventions has shown that most of \nthe  policy  actions  will  have  substantial  positive  impact  on  the  environment.  Any  potential \n\nPoverty  and  Economic \n\nlocal  governments, \n\nthe \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\n     \n\n \n\nthe  policy  actions  and  an  environmental  management  plan,  are \n\nnegative  environmental  impacts  of  increased  expenditure  in  the  water  supply,  sanitation,  and \nhealth  sectors  are  adequately  addressed  through  the  eligibility  criteria  for  the  performance \ngrants  and  the  increased  capacity  building  for  environmental  management,  to  be  supported \nunder  the  associated  TA  loan.  The  environmental  assessment  summary,  including  an \nin \nassessment  of \nSupplementary Appendix P. \n \n101.  Sustainability  Impact.  Program  sustainability  is  a  key  issue.  Various  factors  including \nprogram  design  strengthen  sustainability.  BDSSP  is  designed  to  support  the  provincial \ngovernment\u2019s own initiative mainly emanating from BLGO 2001, which devolved social services. \nBDSSP  is  closely  integrated  and  builds  on  the  enabling  environment  created  by  DSP  and \nBRMP. The performance grants will be administered through the institutional framework of the \ngovernment  (BPGR  2005).  The  refinancing  of  high-interest  debt  with  OCR  funds  will  create \nsustainable fiscal space. The TA support to build evaluation capacities and processes will also \nhelp  make \nlocal \ngovernments  and  citizens  are  expected  to  play  key  roles  in  sustaining  the  program \ninterventions.  By  supporting  public  expenditure  tracking  and  quantitative  service  delivery \nsurveys,  the  program  will  institutionalize  strong  monitoring  systems,  and  thus  improve \nefficiencies  and  sustainability  in  the  long  run.  If,  as  anticipated,  there  will  be  less  human  and \nincome poverty, with the help of the program, there will ultimately also be less demand for social \nsector expenditures.  \n\ninterventions  more  sustainable.  Moreover,  empowered \n\nthe  program \n\nC. \n\nRisks  \n\n102.  Political  Risks.  The  political  situation  in  Balochistan  tends  to  be  difficult.  The  coalition \ngovernment  has  a  wide  constituency  to  satisfy  and  therefore  faces  contending  pressures. \nDevolution is seen in some political quarters as giving up too much provincial power, so much \nso  that  there  could  be  attempts  to  recentralize.  Recent  local  government  elections  (August\u2013\nSeptember 2005), while ushering in local government representatives with a fresh mandate, had \na large number of uncontested seats, providing a grim reminder that the process is evolving and \nfar  from  perfect.  The  issue  is  more  a  matter  of  perspective  and  appreciation  of  the  realigned \nroles  and  responsibilities  of  provincial  and  local  governments  under  BLGO  2001.  The  policy \ndialogue  during  the  program  design  must  continue  during  program  implementation  to  mitigate \nthe  risks.  BDSSP  is  better  positioned  to  be  involved  in  serious  policy  dialogue  and  mitigate \nsome  of  the  political  risks.  ADB  has  sustained  policy  dialogue  and  interaction  with  senior  civil \nservices  and  civil  society  in  Balochistan  over  the  past  half-decade,  starting  with  DSP  and \ncontinuing  with  Access  to  Justice  Program  and  more  recently  with  BRMP.  This  medium-term \ninvolvement in Balochistan and well-orchestrated support at the program level will substantially \nreduce the perceived political risks. \n \n103.  Governance and Bureaucratic Risks.  There is a risk that some people will resist the \nnew  transparent  and  accountable  processes  and  will  be  reluctant  to  change  systems.  \nTo  mitigate  that  risk,  high-level  support  and  a  high-level  steering  committee  will  be  important. \nFurther  risk  mitigation  is  expected  through  BDSSP  policy  actions  including  special  audits, \npublicly available accounts and expenditures, and public grievance mechanisms. A major focus \nof BDSSP is improving social sector governance such that decisions become more transparent \nand  objective  and  rent  seeking  is  minimized.  Vested  interests  might  therefore  be  expected  to \ndelay  or  undermine  the  implementation  of  reforms.  BDSSP  includes  such  risk  mitigation \nmeasures  as  building  stakeholder  ownership  during  program  design  and  implementation, \nestablishing  program  oversight  mechanisms  including  the  participation  of  local  government \ncouncil  committees,  and  ensuring  synergy  with  other  reform  programs.  Strengthening \n\n \n\n\f \n\n25\n\nmonitoring  systems  and  emphasizing  transparency  and  public  disclosure  would  also  help \nmitigate this risk. \n \n104.  Capacity Constraints. Fast-track devolution has brought with it a substantial agenda of \npolitical,  administrative,  and  fiscal  restructuring,  new  systems,  rules,  and  guidelines,  and  the \nneed  to  train  administrators  and  councilors.  However,  the  local  government  systems  must  be \nfully  operationalized  and  the  provincial  departments  and  agencies  must  be  geared  to  fully \nsupport  the  process.  A  major  concern  is  the  limited  financial,  managerial,  and  technical \nresponsibilities  that  have  been  devolved  in  practice  as  well  as  the  narrow  capacity  of  local \ngovernment functionaries. These risks will be mitigated by policy reforms to rationalize the roles \nand responsibilities of the provincial departments in the light of their changed relationship with \nthe  local  governments  under  BLGO  2001,  and  by  the  local  government  capacity-building \nactivities financed under the TA. \n \n105.  Fiduciary  Risk.  During  the  preparation  of  the  BRMP,  the  fiduciary  risk  to  public  funds \narising from the lack of accountability and transparency in financial management was identified \nas  a  concern.  BRMP  policy  reforms  are  helping  to  establish  reliable,  transparent,  and \naccountable  financial  management  systems  to  address  this  fiduciary  risk.  In  addition,  specific \nfinancial management arrangements for the performance grants that will be funded through the \nADF  loan  and  grant  have  been  agreed,  including  the  regular  audit  of  the  performance  grant \nprogram.  The  ongoing  efforts  to  strengthen  public  financial  management,  the  project-specific \nfinancial management arrangements, and other measures and assurances will mitigate this risk. \n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n106. \nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  government  of  Balochistan  has  given  the \nfollowing  specific  assurances,  which  will  be  incorporated  in  the  legal  documents.  The \ngovernment of Balochistan \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nwill ensure (a) that the objectives achieved, policies adopted, and actions taken \nprior to the date of the Loan Agreements, as set forth in the development policy \nletter and accompanying policy matrix, will continue to be in full force and effect \nfor  the  duration  of  the  program  period  and  subsequently;  (b)  proper  and  timely \nachievement,  adoption,  compliance,  and  implementation  of  the  objectives, \npolicies,  and  actions  to  be  achieved,  adopted,  complied  with,  and  implemented \nas set forth in the development policy letter and accompanying policy matrix; and \n(c)  that  once  achieved,  adopted,  complied  with,  and  implemented,  such \nobjectives, policies, and actions will continue to be in full force and effect during \nand subsequent to the program period. \n\nwill improve social sector performance through a long-term commitment. \n\nwill  take  all  steps  and  actions,  including  provision  of  staff  resources,  to  ensure \nsatisfactory  completion  in  a  timely  manner  of  all  program  outputs.  The \ngovernment  will  also  implement  the  program  and  monitor  and  evaluate  its \nperformance in line with the program administration memorandum as agreed with \nADB. \n\nwill  use  the  entire  counterpart  funds  generated  out  of  the  proceeds  of  ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds (ADF) program loan as performance grants in the social sectors. \nThe  performance  grant  will  be  transferred  as  additionality  to  the  regular  PFC \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\n     \n\n \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\naward  transfers  to  local  governments,  and  each  eligible  local  government  will \nallocate  a  minimum  of  20%  of  this  performance  grant  to  each  of  the  social \nsectors.  \n\nwill use the entire counterpart funds generated out of the proceeds of ADB\u2019s ADF \ngrant  as  performance  grants  to  be  utilized  exclusively  for  any  of  the  following \nactivities:  (i) increase  awareness  of  HIV/AIDS  and  measures  to  control  its \nspread;  (ii)  improve  case  detection  of  tuberculosis  and  increase  access  to \ntreatment, mainly through directly observed therapy; (iii) control malaria vectors, \nand detect and treat malaria cases; and (iv) control childhood infectious diseases \nby increasing access to the expanded program on immunization.  \n\nwill  use  the  entire  counterpart  funds  generated  out  of  the  proceeds  of  ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources to restructure the provincial debt through retirement of \nhigh-interest  cash  development  loans.  The  fiscal  space  created  by  such \nretirement will be utilized to provide budgetary support to the local governments \nfor the social sectors under the PFC award. \n\n(vii)  will  provide  the  devolved  social  services  with  appropriate  administrative, \nfinancial,  and  operational  autonomy  and,  for  areas  where  powers  have  not  yet \nbeen devolved, will formulate a transition arrangement indicating when and how \nsuch powers will be devolved. \n\n(viii)  will  ensure  that  none  of  the  functions  and  responsibilities  devolved  to  the  local \n\ngovernment will be recentralized. \n\nwill undertake appropriate actions to achieve clarity on the roles, responsibilities, \nand accountabilities of the provincial social sector departments in the context of \nBLGO  2001  to  ensure  clear  distinctions  in  the  mandates  of  social  sector \ndepartments in the district governments. \n\nwill  ensure  continuous  support  and  assistance  to  the  local  governments  to \nimprove  their  (a)  budgeting  and  financial  management  capacity;  (b)  planning, \nprogramming,  and  design  of  development \nschemes  and  projects;  \n(c)  supervision  and  implementation  of  development  works;  (d)  operation  and \nmaintenance; and (e) monitoring and evaluation.  \n\nwill  ensure  that  the  performance  grant  mechanisms  and  procedures  including \nthose for the eligibility of local governments, award of grant, and timely transfer of \ngrant, monitoring, reporting, audit, and other aspects, will be consistent with the \nBalochistan Performance Grants Rules 2005. \n\n(xii)  will  ensure  that  the  implementation  of  works  under  performance  grants  will  not \nentail  any  land  acquisition  or  resettlement.  In  the  event  of  unforeseen  land \nacquisition or resettlement, the government will ensure that (a) all land acquired \nfor  the  program  will  be  state  land,  free  from  any  encumbrances,  structures, \nhuman  settlements,  or  cultivation;  (b)  no  person  will  be  adversely  affected,  as \nprovided  in  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement;  and  (c)  the  requisite \nresettlement  plan(s)  are  prepared,  in  consultation  with  ADB  and  in  accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement.  In  that  case,  any  award  of  civil \nworks  contracts  will  be  conditional  on  ADB\u2019s  approval  of  such  resettlement \nplan(s). \n\n(xiii)  will  ensure  that  the  program  and  the  TA  project  loan  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance  with  the  environmental  rules  and  regulations  applicable  in  Pakistan \n\n \n\n\f \n\n27\n\nand  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Policy  (2002).  The  government  will  ensure  that \nadequate  environmental  protection  and  safety  measures  are  included  in  the \ndesign  of  the  program  facilities  and  that  the  program  facilities  are  constructed, \noperated,  and  maintained  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Policy.  The \ngovernment  will  ensure  the  implementation  of  environmental  monitoring  and \nmitigation  measures  and  the  environmental  plan  set  out  in  Supplementary \nAppendix P, and will also ensure that the environmental criteria for performance \ngrants  components  adhere  to  overall  selection  requirements  and sector-specific \nrequirements laid out in Supplementary Appendix P.  \n\n(xiv)  will  allocate  and  make  available,  in  a  timely  manner,  the  necessary  counterpart \nfunds from its budget for each fiscal year to ensure the smooth implementation of \nthe TA Project. \n\n(xv)  will ensure that in carrying out the policy measures and activities included under \nthe program loan and the policy matrix, due consideration is given to the findings \nand  recommendations  of  the  TA  Project.  The  Government  will  allow  ADB  to \nprovide comments on the findings and recommendations of the TA project loan, \nfor  consideration  in  policy  measures  for  this  and  upcoming  programs  in \nBalochistan or other programs of similar nature in Pakistan. \n\n(xvi)  acknowledges,  with  the  Government  of  Pakistan  that  ADB,  consistent  with  its \ncommitment to good governance, accountability and transparency, reserves the \nright  to  undertake,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  investigation  of  any  public \nimpropriety  in  the  conduct  of  the  program.  The  Government  will  cooperate  fully \nand  ensure  that  all  agencies  of  the  provincial  government  cooperate  with  any \nsuch  investigation  and  extend  all  necessary  assistance,  including  access  to \nrelevant books, files, and records.  \n\nB. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\n107.  The  following  conditions  for  loan  effectiveness  of  the  program  loan  and  the  TA  project \nloan will be incorporated into the loan agreements: (i) the Planning Commission Proforma II for \nthe  TA  project  loan  will  have  been  duly  approved  by  the  competent  authority;  and  (ii)  the \nprovincial steering committee under BDSSP will have been established.  \n \n\nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loans  and  grant  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \n\n108. \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve: \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nthe  loan  of  $130  million  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  Balochistan \nDevolved  Social  Services  Program  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with \ninterest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered \nrate (LIBOR)\u2013based lending facility;

The  government  of  Balochistan  requires  additional  financial  resources  to \nachieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and targets set in the Balochistan Poverty \nReduction Strategy Paper (BPRSP). The government has expressed its commitment to improve \nthe  provision  of  social  services  in  the  BPRSP,  which  is  based  on  the  MDGs.  The  estimated \nfinancial  implications  of  the  BPRSP  were  included  in  the  medium-term  budgetary  framework \n(MTBF)  for  FY2004\u2013FY2006,  and  updated  in  the  medium-term  fiscal  framework  (MTFF)  for \nFY2006\u2013FY2008. \n \n2. \nUnfortunately, budget growth has been less than the worst-case scenario in the MTBF. It \nis  also  necessary  to  accelerate  improvement  in  the  social  sectors,  to  improve  the  social \nindicators  to  the  levels  achieved  in  other  provinces  in  Pakistan,  and  to  achieve  the  MDGs  on \ntime.  The  government  of  Balochistan  therefore  needs  a  large  amount  of  additional  financial \nresources  for  the  social  sectors  for  the  next  several  years.  The  Balochistan  Devolved  Social \nServices Program (BDSSP) will provide the provincial government with the additional financial \nresources  to  meet  the  resource  gap  and  finance  eligible  district  governments  through \nperformance grants. \n \nResources of the Government of Balochistan. The revenue receipts of the provincial \n3. \ngovernment  are  heavily  dependent  on  transfers  from  the  federal  Government,  but  the  recent \nincrease  in  revenue  receipts  was  primarily  due  to  a  gradual  increase  in  the  revenues  of  the \nprovince  itself.  Revenue  receipts  grew  at  an  average  annual  rate  of  10.5%  between  FY2002 \nand FY2005, and totaled PRs30.9 billion in FY2005 (Table A2.1). The revenue receipts consist \nlargely of federal transfers and grants (about 95%); provincial revenues make up about 5%. The \nfederal  transfers  grew  by  an  average  1.8%  yearly  between  FY2002  and  FY2005,  while \nprovincial revenues increased yearly by an average of 13.1%. The resources for development, \non the other hand, come from four major sources: net surplus from revenue, capital, and public \naccounts, and development receipts. Development resources were PRs12.8 billion in FY2005. \n \n4. \nExpenditure of the Government of Balochistan. The major revenue expenditure items \nof  the  government  have  been  provincial  allocable,  general  administration,  and  debt  servicing. \nThe revenue expenditure increased at an annual average rate of 12.9% between FY2002 and \nFY2005, and totaled PRs28.5 billion in FY2005. As a result of the administrative and financial \ndevolution  following  the  passage  of  Balochistan  Local  Government  Ordinance  (BLGO)  2001, \nmore  than  two  thirds  of  the  revenue  expenditure  has  been  allocated  to  provincial  allocable. \nGeneral  administration  has  been  allocated  9.5\u201314.3%,  and  debt  servicing  10.8\u201315.2%.  The \ndevelopment  expenditure,  on  the  other  hand,  has  been  equal  to  development  resources;  the \ngovernment of Balochistan has used all development resources each year. \n \n5. \nProvincial  Allocable.  Since  the  passage  of  BLGO  2001,  several  functions  of  the \nprovincial  departments  have  been  devolved  to  the  local  governments.  As  a  result,  a  large \nportion of the revenue expenditure was allocated to provincial allocable, most of which went to \nlocal  governments  as  grants.  In  the budget  for FY2002,  out  of  the  total  current  expenditure  of \nPRs19.8  billion,  PRs6.7  billion  (33.8%)  was  allocated  to  provincial  allocable.  This  portion  has \nincreased at an average annual rate of 15.2%, and reached PRs10.4 billion in FY2005. \n \nThe  provincial  allocable  in  Balochistan  is  shared  among  the  local  governments  by  the \n6. \nprovincial  finance  commission  (PFC)  according  to  the  governments\u2019  historical  expenditure \npatterns.  Such  an  allocation  mechanism  is  possible  because  the  grants  primarily  support  the \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\n      Appendix 2 \n\n \n\nsalaries of local government staff, whose number does not substantially change from one year \nto the next, and charged expenditures, such as utility payments. \n \n\nTable A2.1: Summary of Fiscal Accounts of the Provincial Government of Balochistan \n(PRs million) \nFY2002 \nRE \n\nFY2003 \nRE \n\nFY2004 \nRE \n\nFY2005 \nBE \n\nItem \n \n\nA.

The  total  debt  liability  of  the  government  of  Balochistan  at  the  end  of \nFY2003  was  PRs38.1  billion.  This  entails  a  large  debt  service.  Foreign  and  local  loans  in \nFY2003 were PRs22.7 billion and PRs15.4 billion, respectively. Local loans are predominantly  \ncash  development  loans  (CDLs)  (PRs12  billion  in  FY2003)  from  the  federal  Government.  Of \nthese  loans,  PRs10.1  billion  carries  interest  of  more  than  14.5%  yearly,  PRs6.3  billion  bears \ninterest  ranging  from  15.1%  to  17%,  and  PRs0.76  billion  bears  interest  above  17%.  The \nservicing cost of all loans in FY2004 was PRs2.6 billion (of which PRs2.3 billion was for CDLs), \nabsorbing  10.7%  of  total  revenue  expenditure.  The  debt  service  increased  to  3.5  billion  in \nFY2005,  or  12.5%  of  total  revenue  expenditure.  The  Balochistan  Resource  Management \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                         Appendix 2 \n\n35\n\nProgram  (BRMP)  is  providing  $110  million,  which  will  be  used  to  restructure  PRs6  billion  of \nCDLs,  leaving,  the  province,  by  its  own  estimates,  with  around  PRs8.5  billion  in  high-interest \ndebt. \n \nSocial Sector Expenditure. The revenue expenditure for the social sectors appears to \n8. \nbe comparatively small at first glance, but in fact took up more than a third of the total revenue \nexpenditure  in  FY2004.  After  the  passage  of  BLGO  2001,  the  provision  of  education,  health, \nand  water  supply  and  sanitation  (WSS)  services,  among  others,  became  the  responsibility  of \nboth  the  provincial  government  and  the  27  district  governments.  Since  FY2003,  the  provincial \ngovernment  budget  has  been  prepared  and  approved  by  the  provincial  government,  and  the \ndistrict government budget by the respective district councils. To capture the whole social sector \nbudget of Balochistan, therefore, the social sector expenditure of each district government has \nto be taken into consideration, in addition to the social sector budget of the province. Because of \nthe limited availability of budget data in district governments,1 Table A2.2 uses FY2004 figures. \nThe revenue expenditure of the provincial government for the social sectors was only 8.4%. In \naddition to this, 25.1% of the total revenue expenditure was allocated to the social sectors of the \n27  district  governments.  Overall,  33.5%  of  the  revenue  expenditure  was  spent  on  the  social \nsector in FY2004. \n \n\nRevenue / \nDevelopment \n\n1. Revenue Expenditure \n\na. Salary  \nb. Non-salary  \n\n2.

Manila (TA 4356-PAK, approved on July 2004, for $400,000). \n \n9. \nThe  prominent  characteristic  of  the  social  sector  expenditure  is  that  there  is  a  large \nproportion  of  salary  payment  and  thin  non-salary  and  development  expenditures.  The  total  of \n                                                 \n1  The provincial finance department did not have complete sets of FY2002/3 budgets for 26 district governments and \n\nhad not yet received the FY2004/5 budgets from the districts. \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\n      Appendix 2 \n\n \n\nthe  revenue  expenditure  and  public  sector  development  program  expenditure  in  FY2004  was \nPRs41.2  billion,  of  which  26.9%  (PRs11.1  billion)  was  allocated  to  the  social  sector.  The  total \nrevenue expenditure of the provincial and district governments for the social sectors in FY2004 \nwas PRs8.2 billion; most of this was used for salary payment and a small proportion was left for \nnon-salary  expenditure.  Salary  payments  took  up  90.1%  of  the  revenue  expenditure  for \neducation, 66.2% for health, and 40.4% for WSS. Overall, salary payments made up 73.9% of \nthe revenue expenditure for the social sectors. \n \nThe development expenditure, on the other hand, was PRs2.8 billion in FY2004, all for \n10. \nthe  provincial  government;  no  allocation  was  made  to  the  district  governments.  The  provincial \ndevelopment programs included schemes that fall within the mandate of the local governments \nas defined by BLGO 2001, such as construction of boundary walls around schools, addition of \nclassrooms, or provision of drinking water, toilets, or electricity connection. \n \n11. \nAmong  three  social  sectors,  education  was  the  priority  sector  in  both  provincial  and \ndistrict  governments.  Of  the  social  sector  expenditure  of  PRs11.1  billion,  education  had  the \nlargest share at 61.2%, health 22.7%, and WSS 16.2%. \n \n12.  Medium-Term  Budget  Framework  (MTBF).  The  MTBF  provided  rudimentary  revenue \nprojections  and  estimates  of  the  additional  amounts  needed  for  poverty  reduction  between \nFY2003 and FY2005, but the actual budgets of the province for the same period were less than \nthe  worst-case  MTBF  projection.  Two  different  scenarios  were  presented  in  the  MTBF  on  the \nbasis  of  different  assumptions  for  the  revenue  projections.  The  best-case  scenario  estimated \nthe  3-year  revenue  at  PRs102.0  billion;  the  worst-case  scenario  at  PRs82.8  billion.  The \nassumptions for the expenditure projections were the same for both best-case and worst-case \nscenarios\u2014an  annual  increase  of  9%  for  revenue  expenditure  and  12%  for  development \nexpenditure. \n \n13.  MTBF  envisaged  the  allocation  of  the  revenue  surplus  during  the  3-year  period\u2014 \nestimated at PRs13.2 billion under the worst-case scenario and PRs18.0 billion under the best-\ncase  scenario\u2014to  poverty  reduction.  Assuming  that  allocation  to  social  sector  expenditure  in \nFY2003\u2013FY2005  would  be  the  same  as  in  FY2004  (26.9%  of  the  revenue  surplus),  \nPRs3.6  billion  would  have  been  allocated  under  the  worst-case  scenario,  and  PRs4.8  billion \nunder the best-case scenario, just to balance revenue and expenditure. Unfortunately, however, \nthe  actual  revenues  in  FY2003\u2013FY2005  were  15%  lower  than  foreseen  in  the  worst-case \nscenario.  Accordingly,  the  level  of  the  expenditure  was  also  downsized  to  match  the  actual \nrevenue. Insufficient social sector expenditure in comparison with the MTBF base-case scenario \nsuggests  that  less  progress  was  made  in  achieving  the  BPRSP  goals  between  FY2003  and \nFY2005. \n \n14.  Medium-Term  Fiscal  Framework  (MTFF).  The  MTFF  included  in  the  white  paper  for \nFY2005  budget  projected  a  financial  gap  between  FY2005  and  FY2008.  The  MTFF  assumed \nthat  the  transfers  from  the  federal  Government  would  increase  by  13.2%  and  provincial \nrevenues  by  12.0%.  On  the  expenditure  side,  the  salary  expenditure  and  pensions  were \nexpected  to  increase  by  5.0%,  and  non-salary  expenditure  was  seen  to  grow  by  15.0%.  As  a \nresult  of  a  budgetary  simulation,  a  financial  gap  of  PRs91.2  billion  was  identified  between \nFY2006 to FY2010. It was expected to be financed through regular foreign project and program \nassistance, and grants from the federal Government. If 26.9% of the total expenditure were to \nbe  allocated  to  the  social  sectors,  the  financing  gap  in  social  sectors  between  FY2006  and \nFY2010 would be about PRs24.8 billion ($415 million). \n \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                         Appendix 2 \n\n37\n\nBDSSP  and  MTFF.  The  program  is  in  line  with  MTFF  and  the  poverty  reduction \n15. \nstrategy,  and  will  provide  budget  support  to  fill  part  of  the  financing  gap  in  the  social  sectors. \nThe funding required for achieving the program outcomes would be less than the financing gap, \nsince  the  MTFF  incorporates  a  wider  scope  of  activities  in  the  social  sectors.  An  attempt  was \nmade to estimate the funding requirement, by calculating the approximate cost of achieving the \nmajor target indicators in the program outcomes between 2006 and 2010. \n \n16. \nEducation Sector. It is assumed that female net enrollment rates in primary school and \ngross  enrollment  in  middle  schools  will  improve  from  24%  to  40%  and  from  18%  to  30%, \nrespectively,  between  2006  and  2010.  This  will  result  in  an  increase  of  about  493,000  pupils. \nFinancing  will  be  required  for  2,100  new  schools.  If  the  per  capita  annual  recurrent  cost  is \nassumed  to  be  PRs4,700  for  primary  education  and  PRs5,300  for  middle  education,  and  the \nconstruction cost of a building is PRs500,000 for primary education and PRs750,000 for middle \neducation, the total cost between 2006 and 2010 would be about PRs5.0 billion. \n \n17. \nHealth Sector. It is assumed that full child immunization will increase from 24% to 70%, \nand child delivery by skilled attendants from 24% to 35% between 2006 and 2010. As a result, \nan additional 1.6 million under-5 children will have to be fully immunized and more than 2 million \nwill  have  to  be  provided  other  child-care  needs  to  reduce  child  mortality.  In  addition,  132,000 \nmore  children  will  be  delivered  by  skilled  attendants.  The  additional  cost  of  combating \nHIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria is expected to be more than PRs1 billion, while the cost of \nreducing  child  mortality  and  morbidity  is  expected  to  be  PRs2.5  billion.  The  expected  cost  of \nreducing  maternal  mortality  and  morbidity  is  PRs1.3  billion.  The  total  additional  cost  for \naccelerating  progress  toward  health  MDGs  between  2006  and  2010  would  be  about  PRs4.8 \nbillion. \n \n18.  WSS  Sector.  It  is  assumed  that  access  to  excreta  disposal  will  increase  from  40%  to \n55%,  access  to  solid  waste  collection/disposal  from  5%  to  10%,  and  access  to  water  supply \ncoverage from 5% to 10% between 2006 and 2010. This will mean that 1.5 million more people \nwill  have  access  to  excreta  disposal,  426,000  more  will  have  access  to  solid  waste \ncollection/disposal, and 1.4 million more will have access to water supply. Since the unit costs of \nexcreta  disposal,  solid waste  collection/disposal,  and  water  supply  are  PRs1,500,  PRs25,  and \nPRs2,500, respectively, the total cost between 2006 and 2010 would be PRs5.8 billion.  \n \n19. \nThe  total  cost  of  implementing  policies  and  facilitation  is  estimated  at  PRs15.7  billion \n($261 million) and is summarized in Table A2.3. It must be noted, however, that the real funding \nrequirement  is  higher  than  the  estimate,  as  the  costs  of  some  inputs  required  to  achieve  the \nprogram outcomes have not been captured because of the limited availability of information. \n \nTable A2.3: Funding Requirement to Achieve BDSSP Outcomes, 2006\u20132110 \n(PRs million) \n2007 \n2006 \n\nTotal \n\n2008 \n\n2009 \n\nItem \nEducation Sector \nHealth Sector \nWSS Sector \n \n\nTotal \n\n650 \n600 \n990 \n2,240 \n\n800 \n700 \n1,070 \n2,570 \n\n950 \n900 \n1,157 \n3,007 \n\n1,100 \n1,100 \n1,251 \n3,451 \n\n2010 \n1,540 \n1,500 \n1,353 \n4,393 \n\n5,040 \n4,800 \n5,821 \n15,661 \n\nBDSSP = Balochistan Devolved Social Services Program, WSS = water supply and sanitation. \nSource:  ADB.  2005.

Balochistan\u2019s  gross  primary  school  enrollment  rates  (government \n2. \nschools,  excluding  classes  functioning  in  temporary  buildings)  shows  a  significant  disparity \nbetween  male  and  female  enrollment  (Table  A3.2).  At  the  middle  school  level,  there  is  an \nincreased  disparity  between  male  and  female  enrollment  in  urban  areas,  and  this  disparity  is \nparticularly  significant  in  the  rural  areas,  where,  apart  from  Sindh  with  its  female  gross \nenrollment  rate  of  8%,  the  enrollment  rate  of  11%  in  Balochistan  is  much  lower  than  in  other \nprovinces.  Similar  gender  disparities  appear  at  the  matriculation  level.  At  29%,  the  overall \nmatriculation  enrollment  rate  for  Balochistan is the  lowest  in  the  province  (Punjab  44%,  Sindh \n42%, and North West Frontier Province 41%). \n \n3. \nContinuation.  Table  A3.3  shows  that  in  2003,  the  government  school  system  in \nBalochistan  had  a  total  enrollment  of  566,242  students.  The  continuation  rate  from  primary  to \nmiddle school was about 23%, and from middle into high school about 39%. The enrollment at \nthe middle level urban schools was about 40% of the primary level enrollment, but in the rural \nareas  this  was  only  about  14%,  highlighting  the  significantly  reduced  continuation  rates  from \nprimary  schooling  for  rural  populations.  The  continuation  rate  from  middle  to  high  school  was \nabout 44% for urban enrollment, and about 30% for rural enrollment. This indicates that for rural \nstudents  completion  of  primary  school  significantly  improves  the  likelihood  of  continuation  into \nhigh school.

Pakistan  is  a  signatory  to  the  Dakar \nGoals and the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) to eliminate gender disparities in primary \nand  secondary  education  by  2005,  and  achieve  gender  equality  in  education  by  2015.  Part  of \nthe National Education for All (EFA) National Action Plan (2000\u20132015) is the Education Sector \nReform  (ESR)  Action  Plan  2001\u20132004,  with  a  range  of  medium-term  targets.  The  targets  for \n2001\u20132004 included improvement in the literacy rate from 49% to 60%; the primary enrollment \nrate  from  66%  to  76%;  middle  school  enrollment  from  47.5%  to  55%;  and  secondary  school \nenrollment from 29.5% to 40%. Given the data provided above for ESR literacy and the primary, \nmiddle  school,  and  secondary \nin  Balochistan  requires \nimprovements of 24%, 19%, 22%, and 11%, respectively, in these areas just to reach the 2004 \nESR targets. In Balochistan, therefore, a serious weakness exists in achieving two dimensions \nof  the  universalization  of  primary  education,  i.e.,  universal  access/enrollment,  and  universal \nretention. Despite the fact that the provincial government has assigned priority and given focus \nto female and rural education, gender and regional disparities remain, and these are well behind \nESR targets. \n \n5. \nBuilding  on  Past  Successful  Approaches  in  Education.  A  number  of  innovative \napproaches have been widely recognized as successful in increasing girls\u2019 access, enrolment, \nand  retention;  increasing  community  participation  in  school  management;  and  involving  the \nprivate  sector  in  school  education.  The  policy  and  program  responses  to  the  challenging \neducation scenario must build on past successful approaches, adapted to a devolved setting.1  \n\nthe  education  system \n\ntargets, \n\n                                                 \n1 The Community Support Process, launched in 1992, as part of a mobile female teacher training program, has led to \na partnership  between  government  and girls\u2019 parents  in the  communities that  was facilitated by  village education \ncommittees.  The  mobile  female  teacher  training  program,  with  its  cluster-based  approach,  was  successful.  The \nrequisite qualification for teaching appointments was relaxed in difficult areas. The Fellow School Program was an \nimportant  and  innovative  component  of  the  Balochistan  Primary  Education  Project.  The  schools  were  given  a \nsubsidy  for  facility  maintenance,  an  enrollment  subsidy,  and  an  attendance  bonus.  In  1995\u20131998,  more  than \n10,000  parent-teacher  school  management  committees  (PTSMCs)  were  formed.

The infant mortality rate (IMR) in Balochistan is 104, with an urban-rural \nvariation  of  88  and  106  per  1,000  live  births,  respectively,  and  a  male-female  sex  variation  of \n101 and 108, respectively (Table A3.4). Around 158 out of 1,000 children do not reach their fifth \nbirthday.  Under-5  mortality  in  rural  areas,  at  164,  is  much  higher  than  in  urban  children,  at  \n130 per 1,000 live births. On the pattern of IMR, children of literate mothers have a much lower \nmortality  of  97  per  1,000  live  births,  compared  with  children  of  illiterate  mothers,  at  168  per \n1,000 live births. About 4 out of every 10 children (43.3%) are underweight for their age, while \nthe  National  Nutrition  Survey  of  2001/02  projected  a  figure  of  35.3%  among  children  \n6\u201359  months  in  Balochistan  province.  The  bacillus  Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin  (BCG)  scar  was  noted  in \n32% of children under 2 years, with reporting as low as 5% in certain districts (Killa Abdullah, \nBarkhan,  and  Kohlu).  According  to  the  EPI  coverage  survey  of  2001,  35%  children  \n12\u201323 months old were fully immunized. \n\nTable A3.4: Maternal and Child Health in Balochistan and Pakistan Compared  \n\n  \n\nPakistan  \n\nBalochistan \n\n1995/96 \nPIHS \n \n\n2001/02 \nPIHS \n \n\n \n\n \n\n2003 MICS \n\nTotal \n\nUrban  Rural \n\nInfant mortality rate, per 1,000 \nFull immunization rate (%), 2\u201323 months \nTotal fertility rate \nDelivery by skilled attendant (%)  \nContraceptive prevalence rate (%) \nMICS = multiple indicator cluster survey, PIHS = Pakistan Integrated Household Survey. \nSources:    Government  of  Pakistan.  1996.

Sibi region is cited to show rich-poor differences (taking Dera Bugti and Kohlu districts \nas poor), with IMR and U5MR among the poor of 119 and 187 per 1,000 live births, respectively, \ncompared with 67 and 94, respectively, in better-off families.  \n\n8. \nMaternal Health. According to the multiple indicator cluster survey (MICS), 2003 20% of \npregnant  women\u201442%  urban  and  16%  rural\u2014availed  themselves  of  prenatal  care  services \nfrom trained birth attendants. Skilled birth attendants assisted 21% of women during delivery\u2014\n44% urban women and 16% rural women. The use of postnatal care by women in the first 40 \ndays after delivery was also found to be very low, at 19% overall, with an urban-rural variation of \n41% and 17%, respectively. Overall, one of every five pregnant woman in Balochistan used the \nservices  of  a  trained  birth  attendant  during  pregnancy  and  delivery,  and  in  the  postpartum \nperiod.  The  use  of  modern  contraceptives  was  as  low  as  14%  (21%  for  all  methods);  in  12 \n\n                                                                                                                                                          \nWashington,  DC;  Government  of  Pakistan.  2002;  World  Bank.  1998.

Pakistan\u2019s  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  Paper  (PRSP)  2003  sees \nthe revival of growth and the reduction of poverty as twin challenges for Pakistan, and considers \nthe Government\u2019s commitment to improving public service delivery as central to achieving these \ngoals.  The  human  development  strategies  focus  especially  on  women  and  children,  the  most \nvulnerable  sections  of  society.  The  National  Health  Policy  (NHP)  of  2001  focuses  on  health \nsector  investments  as  part  of  poverty  reduction,  and  also  accords  priority  to  primary  and \nsecondary  care  delivery  systems.  Both  the  federal  PRSP  and  the  NHP  refer  to  tackling \nmalnutrition  and  other  nutritional  deficiencies,  which  afflict  mostly  women  and  children.  \nA  national  nutrition  program  is  also  part  of  this  strategy.  The  Perspective  Development  Plan \n2001\u20132011  contains  strategies  for  addressing  nutrition  issues.  The  Interim  Population  Sector \nPerspective  Plan  mentions  population  stabilization  as  a  means  of  achieving  the  goals  of  the \nfederal  PRSP,  and  proposes  reducing  the  population  growth  rate  to  1.9%  by  2004  (not \nachieved).  The  related  targets  include:  (i)  increasing  contraceptive  prevalence  rate  (CPR)  to \n57% by 2012; (ii) sustaining the increase in the marriageable age for girls; and (iii) decreasing \nthe  population  growth  rate  to  1.6%  by  2012.  In  health,  innovative  methods  of  recruiting  lady \nhealth  volunteers,  including  identifying  high  school  girls  and  supporting  them  with  stipends  as \nfuture paramedical trainees, have been appreciated.2 \n \n10. \nThe  Balochistan  PRSP  2003,  in  line  with  the  federal  PRSP  and  national  population \npolicies, has highlighted the following strategies to improve the health status of the population \nand  address  the  poverty  of  opportunities:  (i)  significantly  improve  the  health  indicators  for  the \npoor;  (ii)  improve  the  health  management  structure;  (iii)  reorganize  health  facilities  and  fill \nservice  gaps;  (iv)  control  population  growth;  (v)  improve  health  service  delivery  through \nincreased  resources,  efficiency,  and  responsiveness  particularly  for  communicable  diseases \nand  services  for  women  and  children  (MDGs  4,  5,  and  6);  (vi)  promote  public-private \npartnerships; and (vii) increase reliance on the private sector with adequate regulation. \n\n11. \nPrivate  Health  Sector.  The  private  health  sector  comprises  mostly  private  clinics \nmanned  by  a  general  duty  doctor  and  a  paramedic/nurse  or  a  less  qualified  person.  Inpatient \nand  outpatient  specialized  services  are  also  available  but  only  in  Quetta  city.  The  22  private \nhospitals  manage  low-risk  patients  while  charging  high  rates.  State-of-the  art  private  tertiary \ncare hospitals do not exist in the province. Moonlighting (practice after office hours) is common \namong  by  public  sector doctors.  The  more  than  3,500  registered  pharmacies,  mostly  in  urban \nareas, sell drugs over the counter with limited prescribing. \n\nWater Supply and Sanitation \n\nC. \n \n12. \nfor the country as a whole, and the disparity is even greater in the rural areas (Table A3.5).  \n\nOverview. The water supply and sanitation indicators for Balochistan are far lower than \n\n13. \nNearly  one  half  of  the  population  of  the  province  relies  on  unprotected  wells,  ponds, \nrivers, canals, or streams for their drinking water needs. In the urban areas, nearly 80% of the \npopulation has access to piped water inside (74%) or outside (5%) the house and another 10% \nto  other  improved  sources.  In  rural  areas,  these  figures  are  15%,  3%,  and  26%,  respectively, \nwith only 38% of the rural population having access to improved sources of water within a 2 km \nor half-hour distance from their homes. The burden of fetching water largely falls on the women \nand  girls.  Where  groundwater  is  available,  there  is  the  problem  of  overdrawing  due  to \n                                                 \n2  World Bank. 1998.

Adequate  excreta  disposal  facilities  are  not \navailable  to  71%  of  the  rural  population,  wastewater  disposal  is  available  to  barely  1%,  and \nthere is no solid waste collection and disposal system. Most schools lack proper latrines, posing \nproblems  especially  for  girls.  Garbage  litters  the  landscape,  particularly  in  urban  areas  and \nalong main roads. Urban solid waste coverage outside Quetta is mainly in Gwadar district (13%) \nand Kila Abdullah district (10%); in other districts it is less than 3%. There is no sanitary landfill \nsite and wastewater treatment plant in any urban or rural settlement in Balochistan.   \n\n14.  Water Supply. As shown in Table A3.6, there are wide variations in access to improved \nsources of water inside the house among the various districts of the province. There are 6,554 \nrural  settlements  (of  which  540  are  uninhabited)  with  a  population  of  4,997,105.  The  public \nhealth  engineering  department  (PHED)  has  developed  1,658  water  supply  schemes;  of  these, \n373 schemes are not functioning for various reasons. Of the total schemes, 696 are managed \nby  PHED  and  962  were  handed  over  to  the  communities  to  operate  and  maintain  by \nthemselves.  \n\nTable A3.5: Water Supply and Sanitation Service Coverage in Balochistan \n\nPakistan \n\n1995/96,\nPIHS \n\n2001/02,\nPIHS \n\n \n\n1995/96,\nPIHS \n\nBalochistan \n\n2003, MICS \n\nIndicator (%) \n84 \nAccess to improved drinking water \n48 \nAccess to excreta disposal \nAccess to wastewater disposal \n59 \nAccess to solid waste collection and disposal  \u2014 \n\u2014  = not available. \nMICS = multiple indicator cluster survey, PIHS = Pakistan Integrated Household Survey. \nSources: Government of Pakistan. 1996.

Vendors transport this water \nthrough tractors/tankers to user doorsteps and sell it at PRs200\u2013250 per 1,000 gallons. Selling \nwater on drums in donkey carts is common in both rural and urban areas. In urban areas private \nhousing  societies  have  developed  their  own  water  supply  systems,  and  operate  and  maintain \nthese through user charges.  \n\nTable A3.6: Access to Improved Water Supply Inside the House \nin the Districts of Balochistan \n\nLow (6%\u201325%) \n\nMedium (26%\u201350%) \n\nHigh (51%\u201385%) \n\nBarkhan, Dera Bugti, Kohlu, \nMusakhel, Ziarat \n\nBolan, Jafarabad, Jhal Magsi, Kalat, Khuzdar, \nKila Abdulla, Kila Saifullah, Lasbela, Loralai, \nMastung, Nairabad, Sibi, Zhob \n\nAwaran, Chaghai, Gawadar, Kech, \nKharan, Nushki, Panjgur, Pishin, \nQuetta  \n\nSource:  Government  of  Balochistan.  2003.

In  Quetta,  the \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n               Appendix 3 \n\n \n\n43\n\ntown  municipal  administrations  of  Chiltan  and  Zarghoon  towns  take  charge  of  solid  waste \ncollection, transportation, and disposal. Less than 50% of the solid waste generated in Chiltan \ntown is collected by the tehsil municipal administration (TMA). The remaining solid waste is left \nlying in the streets or in open plots. The solid waste is transported to the dumping site outside \nthe city. Similarly no TMA has proper facilities for the collection and sanitary disposal of hospital \nwaste.  In  other  towns,  overall,  only  26%  of  the  population  has  solid  waste  disposal  facilities. \nHouseholds  dump  their  solid  waste  in  adjacent  open  plots  or  in  the  lanes.  In  the  absence  of \ndisposal  systems,  solid  waste  piles  up  in  every  village.  Dumping  the  waste  in  plastic  bags \nprevents  it  from  being  used  as  manure  in  the  fields.  The  private  sector  is  participating  in  the \nrecycling of materials, like paper, glass, and iron, produced as waste from the houses.  \n\nLow (4\u201325%) \n\nTable A3.7: Access to Adequate Sanitation \nin the Districts of Balochistan \nMedium (26\u201350%) \n\nAwaran, Barkhan, Dera Bugti, Jhal Magsi, \nKharan, Killa Abdullah, Killa Saifullah, Kohlu, \nLoralai, Musakhel, Pishin, Zhob, Ziarat \n\nBolan, Chagai, Gawadur, Jafarabad, \nKhuzdar, Lasbela, Nasirabad, Nushki, \nSibi \n\nHigh (51\u201385%) \n\nKalat, Kech, Mastung, \nPanjgur, Quetta,  \n\nSource:  Government of Balochistan. 2003.

Reduce \nthe under-5 \nmortality rate  by \ntwo thirds \nGoal 4: Maternal \nHealth. Reduce \nmaternal mortality \nby three fourths \nGoal 6, Target 8: \nHalt by 2015 and \nbegin to reverse \nthe spread of \nHIV/AIDS, malaria, \nand other \ndiseases \n\nGoal 7, Target 10: \nWater Supply. \nHalve, by 2015, \nthe proportion of \npeople without \nsustainable \naccess to safe \ndrinking water  \nGoal 7: \nSanitation \n\n \n\nThe primary schools gross enrollment ratio of girls to boys has increased from 0.34 in 1991 to \n0.58  by  2003,  but  the  increase  falls  short  of  MDG  of  achieving  gender  parity  by  2005.  The \nratio of girls to boys in net enrollment increased from 0.45 in 1991 to 0.61 in 2001, which again \nfalls short of the goal. \nThe under-5 mortality at the national level fell from an estimated 138 in 1990 to 110 per 1,000 \nlive  births  in  2000.  Balochistan  has  a  higher  U5MR;  substantial  investments  would  therefore \nbe needed to expand and implement internationally accepted strategies to lower U5MR in the \nprovince. \n \nIndicator  17:  Prenatal  care.    Prenatal  care  services  improved  by  0.5  percentage  point  per \nyear over the previous 15 years, from 14% in 1986/91 to 21% in 1999/2001. \nAssistance during delivery. Only 21% of deliveries were attended by trained birth attendants \nin 2003, compared with 10.4% in 1990.  \nHIV/AIDS:  From  a  status  of  low  prevalence  but  high  risk,  HIV/AIDS  in  Pakistan  became  a \nconcentrated  epidemic  in  2004  reportedly  because  of  injecting  drug  users  in  Larkana  and \nKarachi cities, and in Quetta city. Current users of any method of family planning among non-\npregnant women 15\u201349 years increased from 2% in 1990/91 to 21% in 2003/04. \nMalaria:  The  malaria  control  program  is  being  implemented  in  line  with  the  World  Health \nOrganization\u2019s \u201cRollback Malaria\u201d strategy. It is likely that Balochistan province can meet goal \n6 provided additional resources are made available to address the challenges. \nTuberculosis.  The  overall  incidence  of  tuberculosis  is  177  cases  per  100,000,  and  that  of \nsputum-positive  pulmonary  tuberculosis  is  80  cases  per  100,000  population,  according  to  a \n1987/88 survey. \nThe  MDG  for  water  supply  would  therefore  be  to  reduce  the  percentage  of  the  population \nwithout access to water supply from 54% in MICS 2003/04 to 27% by 2015. In 1998\u20132001 the \npopulation without access to water decreased by about 2% per year, whereas between 2001 \nto 2003 the decrease was 8%, for an average of 4.4% per year during the 1998\u20132003 period. \nIf the population  without access continues to decline according to this trend  with the present \nlevels of investment in the sector in real terms, the population without access in the year 2015 \nwould be 32%. This leaves an unmet gap of 5% when compared with the MDG target of 27%. \nThe additional investment under BDSSP would help bridge this gap. \nMDG  targets  for  sanitation  for  2015  are  not  defined;  therefore,  targets  similar  to  those  for \nwater supply have been adopted. Taking MICS (2003) as the basis, the MDG targets for 2015 \nwould be to halve the population without access to sanitation\u2014from the 90% reported in MICS \nto  45%  by  2015.  In  1998\u20132001  the  decrease  in  population  without  access  to  sanitation  was \n2.3%  per  year.  This  trend  has  been  assumed  to  continue  till  2015,  resulting  in  63%  of  the \npopulation  without  access  to  sanitation  by  2015,  compared  with  the  MDG  of  45%,  leaving  a \nvery  large  unfilled  gap  at  the  present  low  levels  of  investment  in  sanitation.  If  a  significant \nproportion of the sector investment under BDSSP were to go to sanitation, a part of this gap \nwould be filled. \n\nBDSSP  =  Balochistan  Devolved  Social  Services  Program,  HIV/AIDS  =  human  immunodeficiency  virus/  acquired \nimmunodeficiency syndrome, MDG = millennium development goals, MICS = multiple indicator cluster survey, U5MR \n= under five mortality rate.  \nSource:  ADB.  2005.

Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS) \n \nBalochistan can no longer be classified as a low-prevalence province, as a concentrated \n1. \nepidemic  has  already  occurred  among  injecting  drug  users  (IDUs)  in  the  provincial  capital, \nQuetta. There are about 500\u20131,000 people living with AIDS (PLWAs) in the 10\u201324 age group in \nthe  province.  The  slow  pace  in  expanding  the  response  to  human  immunodeficiency \nthe  Balochistan \nvirus/acquired \nEnhanced  HIV/AIDS  Control  Program1  is  cause  for  concern,  as  the  window  of  opportunity  in \nresponding  to  the  epidemic  is  fast  closing  and  further  delays  could  lead  to  a  generalized \nepidemic.  \n  \n2. \nin  effectively  serving  known  high-risk  groups  are:  \n(i)  the  absence  of  a  package  of  preventive  services,  including  sexually  transmitted  infection \n(STI)  and  voluntary  counseling  and  testing  (VCT)  services  and  condom  availability,  to  protect \nthe laborers who have flocked to Gawadar because of its port development project; and (ii) the \nabsence  of  a  comprehensive  response  to  the  IDU  population,  e.g.,  detoxification  and \nrehabilitation  preparatory  to  reintegration  into  society,  in  addition  to  harm  reduction,  the  only \nservices planned.  \n \n3. \nThe STI control services through approved programs are restricted to the training of 50 \ndoctors from public sector teaching and district hospitals and 30 private sector doctors from the \ncapital city, the development of guidelines for syndromic management of STI cases, and limited \nsupply of STI drugs to public sector hospitals. Potential gaps include: (i) lack of skills among the \nmedical  staff  in  general  in  the  syndromic  approach  to  STI  services  and  counseling  of  STI \npatients on condom use and other matters, and the scanty allocation in the ongoing project for \ntraining in STI service management in the public sector; (ii) limited access of patients to good-\nquality  STI  services  including  counseling,  in  both  public  and  private  health  sectors;  (iii)  limited \nawareness, especially among high-risk groups, of STI services in the province; and (iv) irregular \nconduct of drug sensitivity tests to monitor the  efficacy of drugs included under the syndromic \nmanagement protocols. \n \n4. \nReducing  the  vulnerability  of  youth  to  HIV/AIDS  through  increased  awareness  and \npractice  of  HIV/AIDS  preventive  measures  is  an  important  area  not  addressed  in  the  ongoing \nproject. The province has a young population. Adolescents (10\u201319 years) make up about 20%. \nThere  is  little  awareness  among  this  group  of  what  causes  HIV/AIDS  and  how  it  can  be \nprevented.  \n \n5. \nThere  are  no  plans  to  involve  sectors  other  than  health  (e.g.,  police,  corporate  sector, \nsocial welfare) in combating the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The health department must work through \nthe Provincial AIDS Control Program with other departments, the corporate sector, labor unions, \nand  the  chamber  of  commerce  to  conceptualize  the  agenda,  develop  interventions  in  the \nworkplace, prepare a plan of action, and then train staff to carry it out. There is also no plan to \nteach a life skills\u2013based curriculum to students in private schools, universities and colleges, and \nreligious institutions and to street children. \n \n6. \nAn anti-retroviral (ARV) treatment and continuum care center is in the conceptual stage. \nAn  international  expert  should  be  hired  to  help  the  designated  hospital  conceptualize  the \n\n                                                 \n1  The  5-year,  PRs234  million  HIV/AIDS  control  program  for  Balochistan  province  is  financed  mainly  by  the  World \n\nBank. \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n \n\n \n\nTuberculosis \n\nprinciples  of  ARV  treatment  and  continuum  care  and  support  for  people  infected  or  otherwise \naffected  by  HIV/AIDS.  According  to  the  estimates  of  the  department  of  health,  there  are  \n114  private  sector  blood  banks  in  the  province  but  only  three  are  state-of-the  art.  A  provincial \nblood  transfusion  authority  (BTA)  has  been  established;  now  the  rule  of  business  must  be \neffectively enforced.  \n \nB. \n \n7. \nPakistan has the sixth-highest tuberculosis burden among all countries. The incidence of \ntuberculosis  is  determined  through  periodic  tuberculin  and  disease  surveys.  The  overall \nincidence  of  tuberculosis  is  177  cases  per  100,000  population,  and  that  of  sputum-positive \npulmonary tuberculosis is 80 cases per 100,000 population, according to a 1987/88 survey.  \n \nAs  of  2004,  the  Balochistan  department  of  health  had  extended  directly  observed \n8. \ntherapy  for  tuberculosis  (TB-DOTS)  services  to  23  out  of  27  districts  by  establishing  46 \nfunctional diagnostic and 189 treatment centers. Each functional diagnostic center is to provide \nTB-DOTS  services  to  about  150,000  persons,  on  average.  Its  total  case  load  would  be  about \n270  tuberculosis  cases,  including  120  sputum-positive  cases.  Each  district  has  one  to  three \ndiagnostic centers, except Quetta district, which has five centers for its population of 879,000. \nThe  population  of  eight  districts  has  been  declared  covered  under  DOTS  with  only  one \nfunctioning diagnostic center. Case detection for all forms of tuberculosis increased from 1.15% \nin 1998 to 28% in 2004. For sputum-positive cases, the case detection rate for 2004 was 31% \nagainst  a  target  of  70%  for  2005.  The  case  detection  rate  for  new  smear-positive  cases  was \nbelow  10%  in  seven  districts  in  2004.  Five  of  these  seven  districts  have  only  one  functional \ndiagnostic center. The sputum conversation rate in 2004 was 88%, the treatment success rate \n81%, and the default rate 12%. The quality assurance system for sputum microscopy is not fully \nestablished to detect false-positive and false-negative sputum slides.  \n \n9. \nThe tuberculosis control program objectives, in line with national objectives and targets \nset  by  the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO),  are  to  (i)  provide  DOTS  coverage  to  the  entire \npopulation of the province by 2005; (ii) successfully treat 85% of tuberculosis cases using the \nDOTS strategy and detect 70% of tuberculosis cases by 2005; and (iii) reduce prevalence and \ndeaths  from  tuberculosis  by  50%  by  2010.  The  target  under  Millennium  Development  Goal \n(MDG) 6 is to halt and begin to reverse the spread of TB by 2015. Two indicators for monitoring \nMDG 6 are: (i) incidence of tuberculosis per 100,000 people; and (ii) proportion of tuberculosis \ncases detected and cured under DOTS. \n \nThe  public  sector  health  infrastructure  comprises  40  hospitals  at  various  levels \n10. \n(teaching,  district  and  tehsil  hospitals),  71  rural  health  centers,  511  basic  health  units,  21 \ntuberculosis  centers,  and  700  other \nfacilities \n(dispensaries  and  maternal  and  child  health  centers).  Although  131  health  facilities  (39 \nhospitals, 71 rural health centers, and 21 tuberculosis centers) are potentially eligible to become \ndiagnostic  centers  for  TB-DOTS,  only  46  functional  diagnostic  centers  provide  so-called \ncoverage to the population of 23 districts. The department of health has not been able to make \neven all the tuberculosis centers function as diagnostic centers.  \n \n11. \nThe  tuberculosis  control  program  is  fully  integrated  with  the  health-care  system  in  the \ndistrict  governments  (DGs),  as  the  health  offices  of  the  DGs  are  responsible  for  TB-DOTS \nplanning  and  implementation.  The  DGs  finance  staff  salaries  and  utility  costs  from  their \nrespective  district  budgets  through  Account  IV  but  hardly  finance  any  non-salary  items,  which \nare generally funded by the Balochistan health department from its development budget.  \n \n\nlower-level  primary  health  care  (PHC) \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n47 \n\n12. \nIn  2003,  the  National  Tuberculosis  Control  Program  (NTP)  received  a  onetime  grant \nfrom  the  Global  Drug  Facility  for  the  procurement  of  anti-tuberculosis  drugs  for  a  period  of  2 \nyears. The drugs are shared with those DG health services where the DOTS strategy is being \nimplemented. The stocks are expected to be consumed by 2005 and the provincial government \nor  the  DGs  will  have  to  procure  anti-tuberculosis  drugs  from  their  own  budgets.  The  NTP  has \nalso secured grant funds from Global Fund, WHO, and United States Agency for International \nDevelopment (USAID). These funds, invested at the DG level, are intended to support technical \nassistance and public-private partnerships on a limited scale, but are provided outside national, \nprovincial, and district accounts. The for-profit private sector does not take part in implementing \nthe  TB-DOTS  strategy;  instead  it  uses  its  own  protocols  in  treating  tuberculosis  cases.  Two \nnongovernment organizations\u2014the Balochistan chapter of the Anti-tuberculosis Association and \nMercy  Corps\u2014are  implementing  the  TB-DOTS  strategy  in  partnership  with  the  public  sector \nTuberculosis Control Program.  \n \n13. \nThe  NTP  has  expanded  over  time  and  achieved  satisfactory  progress.  Acceleration \nbeyond this level to maintain its 85% treatment success rate and detection rate of up to 70% of \ntuberculosis cases is a daunting task, but it must be done to reverse the spread of tuberculosis \nby 2015. The main challenges faced by the district and provincial program units are: (i) lack of \ndoctors  and  technicians  at  peripheral  facilities,  preventing  the  establishment  of  diagnostic  and \ntreatment  centers;  (ii)  absence  of  linkages  between  the  public  sector  and  the  for-profit  sector, \nand the limited involvement of the not-for-profit private sector; (iii) lack of resources to establish \nperipheral diagnostic laboratories; (iv) absence of resources to establish referral laboratories for \nquality control; (v) meager non-salary budget at the district level, both for implementation and for \nmonitoring; and (vi) geographically dispersed population, separated by long distances. \n \n14. \nOptions  for  expanding  the  NTP  must  be  found.  DGs  and  the  Balochistan  health \ndepartment  should  explore  the  following  interventions  by  investing  more  resources,  either \nthrough donor grants or out of their own development budgets: (i) establishing new diagnostic \ncenters in the public sector; (ii) establishing new diagnostic and treatment centers in the private \nsector;  (iii)  training  new  staff  in  the  DOTS  diagnostic  and  treatment  protocols;  (iv) establishing \nregional quality control laboratories; (v) expanding TB-DOTS in the remaining four districts; and \n(vi) establishing referral services to deal with complicated cases. \n \nC. \n\nMalaria \n\n15.  Malaria has been a major public health problem in Balochistan and threatens the health \nof millions of people, especially pregnant women and children under 5 years. Rapid population \ngrowth,  the  influx  of  Afghan  refugees,  and  haphazard  urbanization,  together  with  deteriorating \nsanitation  has  increased  malaria  incidence  in  Balochistan.  Both  Plasmodium  falciparum  (P.f) \nand  Plasmodium  vivax  (P.v)  types  are  widely  distributed.  The  major  vector  species  are \nAnopheles  culicificies  and  A.  stephensi.  The  major  transmission  period  is  from  July  through \nNovember,  but  there  is  also  a  short  spring  transmission  during  April  and  May.  More  recently \nmalaria cases have been observed throughout the year in coastal areas, and this is cause for \nconcern. \n \nBalochistan  province  has  a  high  incidence  of  malaria  compared  with  the  rest  of  the \n16. \ncountry.  The  annual  parasite  incidence  (API)  measures  the  number  of  cases  per  1,000 \npopulation occurring in a year. The overall API for the country was 0.73 per 1,000 in 2001 and \n0.21  per  1,000  in  2004.  In  Balochistan,  API  was  9.93,  8.79,  6.69,  7.95,  and  6.56  per  1,000 \nbetween  2000  and  2004.  A  total  of  40,730  confirmed  cases  (32%  of  all  malaria  cases  in \nPakistan)  were  detected  in  the  province  by  the  public  sector  in  2004.  Since  about  25%  of  the \npopulation  uses  public  sector  health  facilities,  the  total  number  of  malaria  cases  should  be  at \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n \n\n \n\nleast four times higher. Therefore, by conservative estimates, about 163,000 cases may occur \nevery year at an API of 6.56 per 1,000\u2500a very high morbidity level. In 2004, 35% in Balochistan \nand 26% nationwide had P.f malaria. P.f malaria is generally prevalent in coastal areas, causes \nmany  deaths  in  children  and  results  in  low-birth-weight  babies.  In  the  following  11  high-risk \ndistricts  in  the  province  API  has  remained  quite  high  in  2002-2003:  Kech,  Panjgur,  Kharan, \nLoralai, Chagai, Ziarat, Zhob, Gawadar, Sibbi, and Jaffarabad. \n \n17. \nP.f  malaria  has  become  resistant  to  chloroquine  throughout  the  country.  Resistance  \nlevel I (RI) is common (30\u201384%), RII resistance is rare (2\u201336%), while resistance level III (RIII) \nhas not yet been detected. The upsurge of P. falciparum in Balochistan could be partly due to \nthe increase in resistance to chloroquine. Vector resistance to insecticides has been one of the \nmajor  technical  problems.  Both  malaria  vectors,  i.e.,  A.  culicifacies  and  A.  stephensi,  are \nresistant to organochlorines (DDT, Dieldrin, and BHC). Recently A. stephensi has also become \nresistant to Malathion (organophosphate). The Malaria Control Program now uses Deltamethrin \n(a synthetic pyrethroid) for selective residual indoor spraying to contain focal epidemics. \n \n18. \nThe  objective  of  the  Malaria  Control  Program,  in  line  with  the  national  objective  and \ntargets set by WHO for its Rollback Malaria (RBM) program, is to reduce malaria morbidity by \n50% by 2010. The target under MDG 6 is to halt and begin to reverse the spread of malaria by \n2015. Two indicators for monitoring MDG 6 are: (i) prevalence and death rates associated with \nmalaria;  and  (ii)  proportion  of  the  population  in  malaria  risk  areas  that  uses  effective  malaria \nprevention  and  treatment  measures.  Three  strategies  used  by  the  Pakistan  Ministry  of  Health \nand the department of health of Balochistan to reduce malaria morbidity by 50% by 2010 are: \n(i) strengthening preventive, diagnostic, curative, and surveillance services under the devolved \nsystem; (ii) implementing integrated vector control with the participation of the public and private \nsectors  and  communities;  and  (iii)  increasing  community  awareness  through  appropriate \nmeasures.  \n \n19. \nThe  challenges  and  gaps  in  the  Balochistan  Malaria  Control  Program  are  as  follows: \n(i) outdated monitoring tools, which were developed in the 1960s and are no longer relevant to \nthe RBM strategy; (ii) poorly defined roles and responsibilities at the provincial and district levels \nin the implementation of the RBM strategy in a devolved setting; (iii) high vacancy rate for many \nyears among sanctioned posts for field workers; (iv) major funding gaps in community advocacy \nand  mobilization  for  early  diagnosis  and  prevention,  public-private  partnerships  in  early \ndiagnosis and prompt treatment, urban malaria prevention and treatment, in-service training of \nhealth staff (including lady health volunteers) in RBM concepts, provincial and district monitoring \nand  supervision,  development  of  peripheral  diagnostic  facilities  in  eight  districts,  preventive \ninterventions (like insecticide-treated bed nets) for high-risk malaria districts, periodic preventive \ntreatment, and community treatment of children under 5 years; and (v) low awareness among \nthe district governments of their financial obligations following devolution, including the funding \nof RBM interventions. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n49 \n\nDEVELOPMENT COORDINATION MATRIX \n \nOther Multilateral Agencies \n\nAsian Development Bank \n\nProvide assistance to \ngovernment in its reform agenda \nto improve governance across \nthe board, including management \nof development process, public \nresources, and expenditure; \ntransparency and accountability \nof economic policies; \nstrengthening of institutions, \nsystems, and capacity; and \npromotion of local participation \nand ownership. \nProvide support for the \ngovernment\u2019s poverty reduction \npolicy and strategy by \nimplementing decentralization, \ngender, and social development \nreforms. \nProvide support to integrate \naccess to justice issues into \ndevelopment.

The  counterpart  program \n\n1. \nIntroduction.  Within  the  framework  of  the  Balochistan  Performance  Grant  Rules \n(BPGR)  2005,  performance  grants  under  the  Balochistan  Devolved  Social  Services  Program \n(BDSSP)  will  be  allocated  to  district  governments  (DGs)  as  non-matching  grants  to  achieve \nprogress  toward  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs)  in  education,  health,  and  water \nsupply and sanitation (WSS) and the goals stated in the Balochistan Poverty Reduction Strategy \nPaper (BPRSP).1 \n \n2. \nAdministration Process. The performance grants will be administered according to the \nprocedure defined in BPGR 2005; salient features are as follows: (i) public announcement and \nnotification by the government of Balochistan; (ii) circulation of the eligibility criteria and contract \nconditions  to  DGs  by  the  provincial  finance  commission  (PFC)  secretariat;  (iii)  transmission  of \neligibility  certificates  and  documents  from  DGs  to  the  PFC  secretariat;  (iv)  review  of  DG \ndocuments  by  the  PFC  secretariat  to  check  for  eligibility  and  completeness  of  requirements;  \n(v) submission by DGs of any information needed to complete the requirements; (vi) preparation \nof  list  of  eligible  DGs,  and  issuance  of  invitation  to  DGs  to  complete  contractual  formalities;  \n(vii)  completion  of  contractual  formalities;  (viii)  DG  submission  of  monthly  expenditure  reports \nand  quarterly  progress  reports  to  PFC;  and  (ix)  monitoring  by  provincial  governments  through \nsector line departments. \n \n3. \nfrom  Asian \nDevelopment Fund (ADF) loan ($65 million) and the ADF grant for the control of HIV/AIDS and \ninfectious diseases ($5 million) will be allocated among all eligible DGs as performance grants \naccording to a formula established by the PFC.2 \n \n4. \nSector Allocations. The performance grants allocated to the DGs will be used for three \nsectors: education, health, and WSS. To conform to national and provincial priorities and ensure \naccurate  monitoring,  the  use  of  the  performance  grants  will  be  restricted  to  the  funding  areas \nindicated in Table A9, which may be further expanded by the program steering committee. To \nprovide flexibility for local needs and ensure sectoral balance, each of the three sectors must be \nallocated at least 20%. The remaining 40% of the DG allocation may be used at their discretion \nin the three social sectors. This would enable them to adopt more effective, demand-driven, and \nparticipatory  planning  processes  to  identify  service  gaps  and  rationalize  and  develop  services \nwith full ownership.  \n \n5. \nImmunodeficiency \nSyndrome  (HIV/AIDS)  and  Infectious  Diseases  Control.  The  counterpart  funds  generated \nfrom  the  $5  million  ADF  grant  for  HIV/AIDS  and  infectious  diseases  control  will  be  used \nexclusively  to  support  components  in  health  sector  that  relate  to  HIV/AIDS,  malaria, \ntuberculosis,  and  childhood  infectious  diseases  control  (component  07B  of  health  sector).The \nspecific components that would be financed by this grant are as follows: \n \n\nImmunodeficiency  Virus/Acquired \n\nADF  Grant  for  Human \n\nfunds  generated \n\n(i) \n\nIncrease  awareness  of  HIV/AIDS  and  measures  to  control  its  spread,  including \ninterventions to increase knowledge and  measures to prevent HIV/AIDS among \ngeneral  public,  especially  illiterates;  identification  and  counseling  of  high-risk \ngroups  to  change  high-risk  behavior;  measures  to  prevent  spread,  including \ndistribution of condoms; and treatment support for sexually transmitted infections. \n\n                                                 \n1  See Supplementary Appendix Q for the Balochistan Performance Grant Rules 2005. \n2 The current allocation formula is based on the fiscal needs of DGs: 50% of the funds are allocated on the basis of \n\npopulation, and the remaining 50% on the basis of area.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n        Appendix 9 \n\n59 \n\nCategory \nA.

The  performance  grants \nunder BDSSP will be disbursed from the government of Balochistan to DGs at one time as an \nadvance  or  in  quarterly  instalments  according  to  BPGR.  All  funds  will  be  transferred  to  the \nrelevant DGs though Account IV. The performance grants will be monitored principally through \nthe  mechanisms  and  systems  specified  in  the  BPGR,  as  follows:  (i)  annual  monitoring  of \nallocations/program/work  by  the  relevant  provincial  sector  department;  (ii)  monitoring  by  the \nrelevant  offices  and  monitoring  committees  of  DGs;  and  (iii)  special  monitoring  by  the  finance \ndepartment  when progress in the quarterly progress reports is unsatisfactory (Figure A9). The \nADF grant\u2013financed HIV/AIDS and infectious diseases control component will be monitored as \na  separate  component  to  track  grant  effectiveness.  The  grant  outputs  and  outcomes  will  be \ncarefully monitored through the routine reporting mechanisms of the program loan and through \npublic expenditure tracking surveys and quantitative service delivery surveys. \n \nBDSSP shall: (i) through the program units (PUs) in the DGs, review the reports of the \n7. \nmonitoring  committees  of  the  union  level;  and  (ii)  through  the  PU  in  the  finance  department, \nreview the reports of the monitoring committees of the district councils with regard to schemes \nand initiatives receiving performance grants. In addition, the government of Balochistan plans to \nintroduce the following: (i) a public expenditure tracking survey (PETS); (ii) a quantitative service \ndelivery survey (QSDS); and (iii) a citizen report card, which will be implemented on a pilot basis \nto  obtain  public  perceptions  of  the  quality  of  service  delivery.  BDSSP  will  provide  technical \nassistance  in  developing  and  implementing  these  mechanisms  (see  Supplementary  Appendix \nR). DGs are required to facilitate these surveys under the terms of their partnership agreement \nwith  the  provincial  government.  The  BDSSP  provincial  program  office  will  be  responsible  for \noperationalizing BDSSP assistance and support through contracted assignments including third-\nparty  assessments/validation  through  contracted  NGOs.  The  survey  reports  and  third-party \nassessments/validation  will  be  used  by  the  provincial  PU  and  provincial  program  office,  along \nwith financial and implementation progress reports, to evaluate outputs and impacts. \n \n8. \nReports include those: (i) To be submitted by DGs: a monthly financial report along with \ndetailed  expenditure  statements  for  each  category  of  grant,  to  be  submitted  to  the  PFC \nsecretariat  and  the  finance  department;  a  quarterly  progress  report  on  the  financial  position, \nprogress on implementation, and detailed expenditure statement for each category of grant, to \nbe submitted to the PFC secretariat; and an annual progress report to be submitted to the PFC \nsecretariat  and  the  provincial  finance  department;  and  (ii)  To  be  submitted  by  the  PFC \nsecretariat: all reports submitted by DGs, consolidated into a database and as an annual report \non PGs, and published for each financial year.

District  governments  have  the  statutory  mandate  for  school  and \ncollege education and basic health and tehsil/district hospital services. The district government \nwill:  subject  to  rules,  be  eligible  for  BDSSP  performance  grants;  use  BDSSP  performance \ngrants in accordance with the specific criteria and conditions defined for BDSSP and follow the \nprocess  and  procedures  laid  down  for  monitoring,  accounting,  and  reporting  in  the  rules,  and, \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f64 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n \n\n \n\nthe  specific  conditions  of  the  terms  of  partnership;  ensure  transparency,  equity  and \naccountability in the participatory planning, allocation, and use of BDSSP performance grants; \nand  encourage  and  facilitate  citizens\u2019  participation  and  involvement  and  public-private \npartnership in planning, monitoring, and implementing service delivery. \n \n4. \nTehsil  Municipal  Administration.  Tehsil  municipal  administrations  have  the  statutory \nmandate for land-use planning and management, enforcement of municipal regulations, delivery \nof municipal services (water supply, sanitation, roads and streets, street lighting). Selected tehsil \nmunicipal administrations will, subject to rules: qualify for BDSSP performance grants; use the \ngrants according to specific criteria and conditions defined for BDSSP and follow the procedures \nlaid  down  in  the  monitoring,  accounting,  and  reporting  rules  and  the  specific  terms  of  the \npartnership;  ensure  transparency,  equity,  and  accountability  in  the  participatory  planning, \nallocation,  and  use  of  the  grants;  and  encourage  and  facilitate  citizen  participation  and \ninvolvement  and  public-private  partnership  in  planning,  monitoring,  and  implementing  service \ndelivery. \n \nCouncil  and  Committee  Level.  Table  A10.2  provides  details  of  the  roles  and \n5. \nresponsibilities of various existing committees and new arrangements proposed at council and \ncommunity level in the Program.  \n \n\nTable A10.2: Roles and Responsibilities of Different Committees/Boards at Council and \nCommunity Level \n\nRoles and Responsibilities \n\nThe  councils  are  required  to  endorse  the  applications  for  performance  grants  and  approve  the \nexpenditure reports submitted to the provincial finance department. The councils have the statutory \nmandate  to  approve  district  government/  tehsil municipal  administration  budgets  and  monitor  their \nperformance. Under the rules, BDSSP will, through the provincial program office, liase and establish \nlinkages  with  initiatives  for  the  strengthening  and  capacity  building  of  elected  institutions  and \nfunctionaries, particularly women and labor/ peasant representatives.  \nThe monitoring committees of the councils have the mandate to monitor and submit quarterly reports \nto  the  councils  to  contain  an  evaluation  of  performance  in  relation  to  achievement  of  targets; \nresponsiveness  to  citizen  difficulties;  efficiency  in  delivery  of  services;  and  transparent  functioning \nand  may  require  the  respective  nazim  to  take  action.  Further,  the  committees  may  recommend \nbonus or performance  pay to government functionaries in recognition  of their  efficient performance \n(subject  to  availability  of  funds  for  this  purpose),  and  identify  inefficiency  or  corruption  and  require \nthe nazim concerned to take appropriate action and remedial measures, regarding which the nazim\nhas  to  report  the  action  taken  to  the  council  within  30  days.  BDSSP  shall,  through  the  provincial \nprogram  office,  liase  and  establish  linkages  with  initiatives  to  make  monitoring  committees  more \neffective. \nBDSSP  shall,  through  the  program  unit  in  the  finance  department,  review  the  reports  of  the \nmonitoring  committees  of  the  zila  and  tehsil  council  with  regard  to  matters  relating  to  the  schemes \nand initiatives receiving BDSSP performance grants. \nBDSSP  shall,  through  the  program  units  in  the  district  government,  review  the  reports  of  the \nmonitoring  committee  at  the  union  level.  In  addition,  the  union  administration  and  elected  union \nfunctionaries shall be consulted during the QSDS, PETS, and third-party validation. \nThe accounts committees of the councils are required under the rules to ensure that public funds are \nused as planned and after public hearings submit their reports to the council. BDSSP shall utilize the \nreports of the accounts committee of the zila council to review transparency and accountability in the \nuse of performance grant funds. \n\nB. School \nManagement \nCommittee \n(SMCs) \n\nSMCs  or  parent-teacher  school  management  committees  (PTSMCs)  are  being  revived  under  the \neducation  sector  reform  program  and  being  provided  funds  and  capacity-building  support.  BDSSP \nwill  expand  support  to  SMCs  in  two  ways.  First,  BDSSP  will  assist  the  provincial  government  in \nannouncing  an  agreed  policy  framework  (i)  increasing  the  participation  of  communities  to  improve \nschool operation and maintenance, including purchase of textbooks and school supplies, repairs and \n\n \n\nLevel \n\nA.

Citizen \nCommunity \nBoards \n(CCBs) \n\nmaintenance, provision of basic facilities and furniture, and contracting of female teachers on school-\nspecific  contracts;  and  (ii)  allocation  formula  (PRs/pupil)  and  limits  for  procurement  (PRs/contract), \nprocess of transferring funds to SMCs, and instruction and guidelines for SMCs including accounting \nand auditing.  Second, district governments  will be assisted in implementing the framework through \nBDSSP  performance  grants  to  fund  SMCs  and  to  provide  capacity-building  support  (other  than  to \nthose  supported  under  ESRA).  Further,  BDSSP  may,  at  a  later  stage,  consider  expanding  SMC \nsupport coverage to all schools/intermediate colleges (up to class 12). \n\nHospital boards and patient welfare associations can play an important role in improving efficiency, \nquality,  governance,  and  accountability.  BDSSP  will  assist  (i)  in  defining  the  framework  for  the \nfunctioning of hospital boards in district/tehsil hospitals, and (ii) provide performance grants to district \ngovernments  to  operationalize  the  boards  to  improve  hospital  services,  maintenance  and  repairs, \nprocurement  of  equipment  and  supplies,  and  provide  incentives  and  facilities  for  female  staff. \nBDSSP  will  assist  the  provincial  government  in  developing the  framework  and  pilot  a  model  of \nautonomy for the four provincial government health institutions, considering possible legislation and \nrules  of  business  defining  the  role,  functions,  and  modalities  of  the  board  and  its  committees.  (In \nPunjab, hospital boards for teaching hospitals were established under provincial legislation. A third-\nparty  evaluation  showed  visible  improvement  in  outpatient,  emergency,  and  laboratory  services, \nutilization of hospital beds (by 90% in one case) and equipment.) \n\nThe  Balochistan  Local  Government  Ordinance  2001  envisages  that  the  CCBs  will  work  with  local \ngovernments  (LGs)  to  mobilize  the  community  and  stakeholders  to improve  existing  facilities  and \nservices, develop new public facilities, increase access of vulnerable groups to income opportunities, \npublic  services,  and  welfare  programs;  and  for  this  purpose  LGs  are  required  under  the  law  to  set\naside  25%  of  their  development  budget  for  CCB  activities.  A  number  of  government  and  foreign-\nassisted  programs,  national  and  international  organizations  are  providing  support  in  the  formation \nand  capacity  building  of  CCBs.  BDSSP  will,  through  the  provincial  program  office,  work  in  close \ncollaboration  with  ongoing  initiatives, in  particular  the  Decentralization  Support  Program    and  the \nUnited  Nations  Development  Program\u2013supported  Devolution  Trust  for  Community  Empowerment. \nBDSSP  performance  grants  will  be  provided  for  CCB  activities  to  the  district  government  in  the \neducation  and  health  sectors  and  to  selected  tehsil  municipal  administrations  for  water  supply  and \nsanitation sectors. \n\nE. Local \nNGOs/ CBOs  \n\nBDSSP performance grants to district governments and tehsil municipal administrations to promote \ngrassroots (community) participation and public-private partnership in service delivery may be used \nto fund involvement of local NGOs/CBOs in these activities and, where the local NGO/CBO demands\nit, to facilitate their registration and functioning as CCBs. \n\nF. Existing \nVillage/Water \nCommittees \n\nWater  user  committees  for  rural  water  supply  schemes  were  established  under  various  foreign-\nassisted projects and by the public health engineering department under the Social Action Program \nframework in the 1990s. Some committees are still active but others have been inactive and many \nschemes  are  non-functional:  schemes  can  be  sustained  and  maintained  by \nthe \ncommittees/communities  only  if  they  are  demand-based,  the  community  contributes  to  the  project \ncost  and  participates  in  its  implementation.  BDSSP  will  assist  district  governments/tehsil municipal \nadministrations in sustaining such water committees as are still functioning. \n\nG. Water and \nSanitation \nCommittees \n\nBDSSP performance grants will facilitate the formation of village and mohalla-based citizens\u2019 groups \nfor sustainable community management, operation and maintenance of water supply and sanitation,\nparticularly  for  solid  waste  in  urban  areas  at  the  local  level  in  partnership  with  the  LGs concerned \neither as water and sanitation committees or as CCBs. \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  BDSSP  =  Balochistan  Devolved  Social  Services  Program,  CBO  =  community\u2013\nbased  organization,  CCB  =  citizen  community  board,  ESRA  =  education  sector  reform  assistance,  LG  = local \ngovernment, PETS = public expenditure tracking survey, PRs = Pakistan rupees, PTSMCs = parent teacher school \nmanagement committee, QSDS = quantitative service delivery survey, SMC = school management committee. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\n \n\n\f66 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \n\n \n\nINELIGIBLE ITEMS \n\n \n1. \nThe proceeds of the loan will be used to finance the foreign exchange expenditures for \nthe  reasonable  cost  of  imported  goods  (excluding  any  duties  or  taxes)  required  during  the \nexecution  of  the  Balochistan  Devolved  Social  Services  Program.

Two  thirds  of  its  population  of  6.5 \nmillion  resides  in  rural  areas  comprising  scattered  settlements  of  sparse  populations.  The  population  is  ethnically \ndiverse, consisting, among others, of Balochi and Pushto speakers. Agriculture is the main source of income for the rural \npopulation, employing 65% of the total labor force and yielding 60% of the gross provincial domestic product. However, \nonly a third of the land area is productive for agricultural or grazing purposes. Half the productive land area is owned by \n10%  of  large  farmers  while  most  tenants  work  on  small  farms  with  incomes  below  the  poverty  line.  Agricultural \nproduction and livestock rearing have been seriously damaged by the drought that has prevailed in the province in the \nlast 5 years. Poverty in Balochistan increased from an estimated 28.6% in 1993 to 38.4% in 1997. In 2003, the provincial \ngovernment estimated poverty levels at between 41.3% and 47%. Rural poverty is much greater than urban poverty. The \nsocial  sector  indicators  for  Balochistan  (health,  education,  and  WSS)  also  show  that  the  province  faces  acute \ndeprivation. \n \nThe Balochistan Provincial Poverty Strategy (BPRS) 2003 and the local government system (implemented in 2001) are \naimed at facilitating poverty reduction, addressing local needs, and improving public service delivery systems. BPRS is \ngeared toward: (i) engendering growth, (ii) managing the  scarce  water resources, (iii) introducing  governance reforms, \n(iv) improving human development, and (v) addressing vulnerability to shocks. The local government system has placed \nlocal administration under an elected nazim and aims to prioritize in accordance with local needs and to facilitate better \nservice  delivery.  However,  while  public  service  delivery  systems  have  improved  in  some  districts,  in  general  the \nfunctioning of local governments continues to be hampered by incomplete transfer of power and resources, overlapping \nof functions and friction between provincial and local governments as well as between different tiers of local government, \nand  institutional  capacity  gaps.  The  poverty  partnership  between  the  Government  of  Pakistan  and  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) reflects the Government\u2019s vision for poverty reduction, including the need to improve access \nto  and  quality  of  social  services  for  the  poor.  The  Government  has  agreed  that  poverty  reduction  requires  good \ngovernance,  increased  allocation  of  funds  for  social  sectors,  and  improved  basic  social  services  to  enhance  human \ndevelopment.  ADB  supports  the  Government\u2019s  governance  reforms  through  the  Decentralization  Support  Program \n(DSP)  and  other  projects.  The  Balochistan  Devolved  Social  Services  Program  (BDSSP)  has  strong  linkages  with  the \nBalochistan  Resource  Management  Program  (BRMP),  and  supports  the  aims  of  the  BPRS  and  the  implementation  of \nthe local government system. \nB.        Poverty Analysis  \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nThe  \u201cperceptions  of  poverty\u201d  among  the  poor  in  Balochistan  also  go  beyond  the  economic  aspect  to  include  political, \ncultural,  and  institutional  dimensions.  Poverty  in  Balochistan  also  has  a  distinct  spatial  dimension,  with  24  of  its  27 \ndistricts, consisting of 92% of its population, falling under the category of regions of \u201chigh\u201d deprivation. Poor households \nin  Balochistan  are  characterized  by  low  levels  of  education,  poor  health,  and  absence  of  safe  drinking  water  and \nsanitation facilities. Overall,  more than half of the total population, of  which 78% is female, has never attended school \nbecause of poverty, social constraints, inaccessibility of schools, lack of basic amenities in educational institutions, and \npoor  quality  of  education  (poor  teaching  methods,  teacher  absenteeism,  etc.).  The  health  indicators  show  that \nmalnutrition is rampant among children. Infant and child mortality rates are high, especially among poor households in \nrural areas, and nearly one tenth of infants die before the age of 1 year mainly because of diarrhoeal diseases, perinatal \ndiseases, and pneumonia. Immunization coverage is also low.  \n \nA very small minority of rural households have access to piped water inside or outside the house. Sixty-three percent of \nthe total population, and 72% of the rural population is dependent on unprotected sources for their drinking water. Only \nabout a third of the rural population has access to excreta disposal facilities while a negligible proportion has access to a \nsewerage system. Solid waste collection and disposal service is not available to the rural population while only less than \na  third  of  the  urban  population  has  access  to  this  facility.  Poverty  in  Balochistan  is  also  exacerbated  by  governance \nissues such as strained federal-provincial relations, leading to a general perception of discrimination, neglect, and denial \nof rights; prevalence of a strengthened tribal system that perpetuates the denial of political and fundamental democratic \nrights  (especially  for  women  and  the  poor)  and  the  subjugation  of  the  populace  through  inordinate  influence  on  the \nsystem of justice and law enforcement agents; lack of adequate public resources and weak governmental management \nsystems; low level of public safety and deteriorating law and order situation, leading to an increased sense of insecurity; \nand the existence of multiple systems of justice, which diminishes the quality of justice available and creates problems \nfor those seeking redressal. \n\n                              Targeting Classification: Targeted interventions \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n                 Appendix 13   \n\n69\n\nDuring the 1990s, the government implemented the Social Action Program to improve the management and delivery of \nsocial services. However, this program had very limited success because of lack of political commitment to reforms and \npolicies, poor governance, and lack of community involvement.  \n \nThe  goal  of  BDSSP  is  to  aid  Balochistan\u2019s  progress  toward  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs)  in  health, \neducation,  and  WSS.  Its  objectives  are  to  increase  access  to  affordable,  effective,  and  quality  social  services    in  both \npublic and private sectors; reduce disparities in access to services on the basis of gender, ethnicity, income group, and \nregional  affiliation;  and  ensure  that  strengthened  local  governments,  private  sector,  and  communities  improve  social \nservice  delivery.  To  this  end,  BDSSP  will  implement  policy  reforms  and  fund  local  governments  to  improve  service \ndelivery and build institutional capacity. The areas of policy reforms include: (i) provincial efficiency incentives\u2014to clarify \nthe  relationship  between  provincial  and  local  governments,  (ii)  managerial  power\u2014to  strengthen  relationship  between \nlocal  governments  and  social  service  providers,  (iii)  citizens\u2019  voice  and  empowerment\u2014to  involve  citizens  in  policy \nmaking and management of social sector facilities, and (iv) private sector engagement. BDSSP will employ the systems \nof \u201cefficient resource management\u201d and allocation of performance grants (developed under BRMP) to local governments \nto ensure the financial sustainability of reforms and to secure the delivery of social services (focusing on the needs of the \nmost vulnerable) on a sustainable basis.  \n \nBDSSP  interventions  will  be  low  cost  and  high  impact  and  will  strengthen  progress  toward  the  poverty  reduction  and \nhuman development targets laid out in the BPRS. Sector strategies will be implemented for health and education (within \nthe  national  and  provincial  policy  framework)  and  for  improvements  in  sanitation  (with  the  civil  society  and  NGOs). \nInterventions  to  improve  education  sector  targets  and  quality  of  and  access  to  education  include  refurbishing  school \nbuildings;  upgrading  schools  (from  primary  to  middle  and  from  middle  to  high  school);  providing  scholarships  for \ndeserving  students;  providing  free  textbooks  in  primary  schools;  improving  teaching  methods/learning  materials; \nproviding  financial  support  for  maintenance  and  consumables;  and  forming  and  strengthening  parent  teacher  school \nmanagement  committees  (PTSMCs).  Improvements  in  health  sector  targets  and  in  quality  of  and  access  to  health \nservices  will  be  achieved  by  implementing  interventions  for  the  uplift  of  district  hospitals;  addressing  the  residential \naccommodation  needs  of  hospital  and  rural  health  staff;  providing  grants  for  the  training  of  local  residents  and  the \nestablishment  of  private  practice  for  private  paramedics,  dispensers  etc.;  developing  and  implementing  a  hospital \nemergency  services  plan;  and  sustaining  district  hospital  boards.  The  problem  of  inadequate  staff,  in  both  health  and \neducation facilities, will be addressed by instituting a system of facility-specific non-regularizable contract appointments. \nBDSSP  will also involve the private sector  and promote public-private  partnerships to enhance public service delivery. \nInterventions include developing alternative options for health service delivery in sparsely populated areas; developing \ninnovative  teaching  materials  and  mother-tongue-based  teaching  learning  materials;  and  launching  a  strategy  for  self-\nregulation of the private sector in health and education. Measures to ensure implementation and staff capacity building \ninclude strengthening of monitoring systems; civil society and third-party  monitoring;  performance awards for staff  and \nservice  delivery  facilities;  training  of  trainers  to  form  a  core  group  of  master  trainers  at  the  district  level  for  teacher \ntraining; training of school supervisors; training of head teachers in school management; strengthening of paramedical \nand nursing training schools outside Quetta; and in-service training for health providers.  \n \nC.        Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nA cross-section of stakeholders, including elected representatives of local governments, officials of provincial and local \ngovernment departments, service providers and, representatives of civil society organizations participated in 13 district, \n4 regional, and 1 province-level workshops. Discussions focused on areas of policy reforms and concerns and priorities \nrelated to delivery of social services, with special focus on the needs of women and the poor. The grassroots perspective \nwas  also  gathered  through  a  series  of  focus  group  discussions  with  communities  and  frontline  service  providers, \nparticularly women. \nIs there a participation strategy? \nBDSSP  provides  TA  support  to  develop  and  institute  grievance  redressal  mechanisms  in  provincial  and  local \ngovernments  at  the  service  delivery  level.  Additionally,  local  governments  are  obliged  to  provide  25%  of  their \ndevelopment  funds  to  support  citizen  community  boards  to  facilitate  participation  of  communities  in  local  government \nplanning  and  service  delivery  activities.  BDSSP  will  develop  a  communication  strategy  to  promote  and  strengthen \ncommunity  involvement  in  the  management  of  service  facilities  and  to  support  implementation  of  BDSSP  in  general. \nBDSSP will prepare a program of civil society monitoring to look at the various local government monitoring mechanisms \nfor citizen oversight including piloting a system of citizen reports cards in the city district of Quetta. The TA under BDSSP \nwill provide capacity development, among others, to local NGOs, CBOs, and community groups to promote community \nmanagement of facilities. \nD. \n\nGender Development \n\n   Yes               \n\n   No  \n\n  Yes \n\n   No \n\nStrategy  to  maximize  impacts  on  women:  Balochistan\u2019s  social  sector  indicators  highlight  the  high  level  of  gender \ninequality: the net primary school enrollment rate is 20% for girls and 28% for boys; the literacy rate is 16% for females \nand 39% for males; maternal mortality figures are high; and, a very small number of deliveries, especially in rural areas, \n\n \n\n\f70 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n \n\n \n\nare  handled  by  skilled  birth  attendants.  Women\u2019s  inferior  status  continues  to  be  perpetuated  because  of  curtailed \nmobility; prevalence of discriminatory tribal and cultural practices, limited voice in critical household decision making; and \nmarginalization  along  the  political  dimension.  The  government  of  Balochistan  is  committed  to  reforming  its  policies, \nsystems,  procedures,  and  administrative  structures  to  promote  gender  equality  in  accordance  with  its  national  and \ninternational commitments. The gender reform agenda of the government is articulated in a Gender Reform Action Plan \n(GRAP), which was approved by the Balochistan cabinet in July 2004. The goal of Balochistan GRAP is to bring about \nchanges in the structure and process of government to promote gender equity, and deliver on the rights and entitlements \nof women. Gender mainstreaming is the key strategy for realizing this goal. Initiatives such as the Gender Reform Action \nPlan  (GRAP),  DSP,  BRMP,  and  BDSSP  aim  to  enhance  women\u2019s  access  to  public  sector  services  and  to  strengthen \ntheir  active  participation  in  public  sector  management,  and  political  and  economic  activities.  BDSSP  aims  to  reduce \ngender  disparities  in  the  quality  of  and  access  to  public  services  by  paying  special  attention  to  the  needs  of  girls  and \nwomen  while  implementing  and  monitoring  interventions.  While  most  interventions  will  also  benefit  women,  some  will \nspecifically aim to reduce gender disparities. \nHas an output been prepared? \n    Yes \nGender Action Plan: Each of the provincial education, health, and public health engineering departments will develop, \nin  consultation  with  district  governments,  a  sector  strategy  in  their  respective  sectors,  which  will  address  increased \naccess to basic social services for the poor and for women in particular. Expenditure allocation norms will be established \nin line with minimum standards for social sectors that will have direct benefit for women. To enhance the effectiveness \nand  efficient  of  service  provision,  incentive  systems  will  be  developed  for  sector  managers  and  service  delivery  staff, \nincluding residential benefits for female staff.  \n(i)  Education. Interventions to improve girls' access to education will include equipping girl schools with basic facilities, \nsuch  as  boundary  walls,  drinking  water,  and  toilet/latrines,  and  providing  merit  scholarships  for  girls  with  primary \neducation to do their matriculation and for matriculate girls to continue intermediate level education.  \n\n   No \n\n \n\n \n\n(ii)  Health. Women\u2019s access to health care will be improved by interventions to provide residential accommodation for \nfemale  service  providers  (nurses  and  lady  health  volunteers  (LHVs))  in  district  and  tehsil  hospitals  to  ensure  their \npresence in health facilities, and provide financial support for the training of midwives and LHVs and for the setting \nup  of  private  practice  for  those  working  privately  so  that  the  reproductive  health-care  needs  of  women  are \nadequately  addressed.  Such  capacity  building  initiatives  will  also  improve  the  quality  of  health  care  available  to \nfemales. \n\n(iii)  Capacity  Building.  Grants  will  also  be  given  for  the  capacity  building  of  female  elected  representatives  to \nstrengthen their participation in PTSMCs and monitoring committees of union councils. This will ensure their active \ninvolvement in the management and monitoring of public service facilities. \n\n(iv)  Program  Implementation  and  Monitoring.  Preference  will  be  given  to  qualified  female  for  all  program-specific \nstaff positions. Consistent with all of the policy reform and project activities aimed at promoting gender equality and \nthe  empowerment  of  women  in  Balochistan,  adequate  representation  of  women  would  be  ensured  in:  program \nsteering Committee, provincial program office, program committee, and program units. Gender-disaggregated data \nwould be collected through public expenditure tracking surveys and quantitative service delivery surveys to monitor \nand evaluate the effectiveness of the gender action plan, among other things.  \n\nE.
