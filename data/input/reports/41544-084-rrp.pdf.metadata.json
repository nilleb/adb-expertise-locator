THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \npolicy-based  grant  to  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  for  subprogram  3  of  the  Investment  Climate \nImprovement  Program (ICIP).1 Subprogram  3  is  the  last subprogram  of  a  program  cluster \napproved in 2008 that has helped the government improve conditions for sustainable economic \ngrowth and employment-generating investments.2 The cluster program includes policy reforms \nin  business  regulation,  access  to  finance,  workers\u2019  skills  development,  and  public\u2013private \npartnerships (PPPs) that are expected to facilitate private investment in the country. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n \n2.  The Kyrgyz Republic is seen as the most democratic and open society in Central Asia. \nThe country has undergone significant economic changes following the collapse of the Soviet \nUnion, including an extensive economic liberalization program. Its transition from a centrally \nplanned to a market economy has been among the fastest and most ambitious in the region. \nLiberal  economic  policies  and  market  mechanisms  have  dramatically  impacted  society. \nPrivatization of state-owned enterprises helped the private sector grow significantly and become \nthe main economic driver. \n \n3.  However the reforms remain incomplete, with a limited modern legal and regulatory \nframework  and  weak  market-based  economic  institutions  and  processes.  Despite  notable \nexamples of entrepreneurship in some industries, such as garments and dairy, the private \nsector has limited productive capabilities. Only in 2011 did the country return to the level of \neconomic activity achieved before the breakup of the Soviet Union. \n \n4.  Economic growth in the Kyrgyz Republic continues to be unstable, with annual gross \ndomestic product (GDP) growth fluctuating from \u20130.5% to 10.5% during 2008\u20132013. Annual real \nGDP growth averaged 4.5% over this period. Internal and external shocks have caused wide \ngrowth fluctuations in the narrowly-based economy, while disruptive changes in government and \npolitical disputes have affected the socioeconomic situation. Absolute poverty declined from \n39.9% to 31.7% during 2006\u20132009, a period of strong economic growth. During 2010\u20132012, \npoverty increased to 38.0% as a result of the domestic political unrest and the global economic \ncrisis.3 \n \n5.  The  main  factor  contributing  to  poverty  reduction  in  2006\u20132009  was  the  growth  in \nremittances, which fueled private consumption. A steady and growing flow of migrants has led \nto  a  significant  increase  in  remittances,  with  transfers  coming  mainly  from  the  Russian \nFederation and Kazakhstan. In 2013, net remittance inflows were equivalent to 24.8% of GDP, \nwhile total external debt was 80.1% of GDP. Trade deficits have been mainly financed by \nremittances, given the country\u2019s difficulty in securing foreign capital via loans and grants. \n \n6.  The Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s investment climate has improved since 2008, when the ICIP \ncluster  implementation  began.  The  country\u2019s  ranking  in  the World  Bank\u2019s  Doing  Business \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided technical \nassistance to prepare subprogram 3. ADB. 2012. Proposed Policy-Based Grant for Subprogram 2 and Technical \nAssistance Grant to the Kyrgyz Republic for the Investment Climate Improvement Program. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2008. Proposed Program Cluster, Grant for Subprogram 1, and Grant Assistance to the Kyrgyz Republic for \nthe Investment Climate Improvement Program. Manila. On 14 October 2011, the ADB operations manual D4 on \npolicy-based lending was revised and the program cluster approach was renamed as programmatic approach. \n3  National Statistics Committee. http://www.stat.kg ", "2 \nReport has improved from 94th in 2007 to 68th in 2013.4 Investment has increased in recent \nyears and was estimated at 27% of GDP in 2013. Private investment has also increased from \n17% of GDP in 2007 to an average of 19% of GDP during 2011\u20132013 (footnote 3); foreign \ninvestment accounted for 32% of total investment and about half of private investment over this \nperiod. Half of foreign investment has been directed to manufacturing, most of it to the Kumtor \ngold mine.5 The country has attracted more foreign direct investment as a percentage of GDP \nthan Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, but performance is slow compared to Armenia and Georgia. In \nMay 2013, the Kyrgyz Republic filed an application to join the Customs Union of Belarus, \nKazakhstan and Russia. Accession is expected to change economic incentives in the country \nand present both opportunities and challenges. \n \n7.  Despite these positive results, further improvement of the private sector investment \nclimate is needed, in particular to enable economic diversification and reduce dependence on \nexternal assistance. The three primary constraints preventing private sector from growing and \nproducing higher-valued products and services are: (i) a challenging business environment that \nstill discourages many entrepreneurs and investors from expanding, investing, or lending in the \ncountry; (ii) an increasing shortage of skilled workers that prevents firms from moving up the \nproduction ladder; and (iii) expensive, short-term finance that is concentrated in a few sectors. \n \n8.  The National Sustainable Development Strategy, 2013\u20132017 is based on a vision of the \nKyrgyz Republic as a nation with robust economic growth that is attractive to investors.6 The \nstrategy foresees measures to effectively implement the rule of law and combat corruption to \ncreate an attractive environment for domestic and foreign investors. The country needs to \nattract  private  investment  that  increases  productive  capabilities  and  creates  jobs,  and  this \nrequires more certainty about business rules and their application in the economy. \n \n9.  Subprograms 1 and 2 of the ICIP were completed in 2008 and 2012. Subprogram 3 \nends the program cluster by completing key reforms needed to improve growth prospects and \nemployment  opportunities,  as  described  in  the  Development  Policy  Letter  (Appendix  3).  It \nincludes changes that improve the business environment, enhance human capital, and increase \naccess to finance, thereby addressing binding constraints to private sector development. These \nimprovements will enable more predictability, which the private sector needs for investment. The \nsupport of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is important because the political system is still \nnew and sometimes divided, and vested interests resist economic policy changes. Subprogram \n3 is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2014\u20132016, for the Kyrgyz Republic \nand is in line with the country partnership strategy for 2013\u20132017.7 The subprogram reinforced \nand benefitted from other ADB and development partner interventions.8 \n                                                \n4  World Bank. Doing Business Report Series. http://www.doingbusiness.org/reports/ \n5  The Kumtor mine produces the majority of the country\u2019s industrial output and exports. The concession has been \nrenegotiated twice since its operations started in 1997. In February 2013, the Kyrgyz Parliament directed the \ngovernment to renegotiate the agreement again amidst allegations that Kumtor operations have caused massive \nenvironmental  destruction.  Parliament  has  yet  to  ratify  the  non-binding  Heads  of  Agreement  on  potential \nrestructuring of the concession\u2019s ownership structure (signed by the government and the private partner in \nDecember 2013). ADB has shared its concerns with the government and other stakeholders regarding the \nimplications of the renegotiation on investor confidence, particularly if the concession agreement is unilaterally \nterminated. ADB has also advocated dialogue between parties.

The subprogram reinforced the project outcomes of development \n ", "3 \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  Subprogram 3 has maintained the expected impact and outcome of the ICIP cluster. Its \nexpected impact will be sustainable economic growth and employment creation. Its outcome is \nan improved investment climate and business environment. \nC.  Outputs \n11.  Subprogram  3  continues  to  focus  on  achieving  four  outputs:  (i)  reduced  cost  of \nregulatory compliance, (ii) improved access to finance, (iii) enhanced workers\u2019 skills, and (iv) \nfacilitation of PPPs. It is built on lessons from previous subprograms, particularly the need for \nimproved monitoring and coordination; dialogue with stakeholders; and close attention to ensure \nthat benefits are shared with all regions.

The International Monetary Fund program is supported by a 3-year \nSDR66.6 million (about $100.8 million) extended credit facility arrangement approved in June 2011. Five reviews \nhave been successfully completed with total disbursement of SDR 57.1 million (about $90 million). The program \nremains broadly on track. \n ", "4 \n \n12.  Output 1: Cost of regulatory compliance reduced. Subprogram 3 strengthens the \nreforms introduced in subprograms 1 and 2. It helps further reduce the regulatory costs of \noperating a business and makes regulatory acts more transparent and accountable, thereby \nnarrowing opportunities for corruption. \n13.  A new licensing law\u2014based on regulatory impact assessment and drafted with the \nsupport of the United States Agency for International Development\u2014was approved in October \n2013,  reducing  the  number  of  licenses  and  permits  from  347  to  fewer  than  200  and \nconsolidating all types of licenses and permits into a single law. The risk-based audit system of \nthe State Tax Service (STS) was improved and merged with the new integrated information \ntechnology (IT) system developed with ADB support. Beginning in June 2013, all tax offices are \nmandated to implement inspection plans generated in STS headquarters by the enhanced \nsystem.  This  is  expected  to  improve  targeting  of  tax  audits  and  reduce  the  burden  for \nbusinesses that have low risks of noncompliance. \n14.  A new legal and regulatory framework on electronic tax declarations using a \u201clogin-\npassword\u201d  system  was  approved.  This  enables  full  operation  of  the  new  ADB-financed \nelectronic  system,  which  will  increase  the  number  of  taxpayers  filing  electronically  (4,665 \ntaxpayers as of 30 June 2013) and reduce filing costs. The STS started pilots in Ortasai and \nMadina markets for electronic payment of tax patents through cash terminals and subsequently \nexpanded this approach nationwide, allowing thousands of patent holders to pay their taxes \nwithout having to go to a bank branch.9 The STS started accepting payment of some taxes \nthrough electronic cards, with ATM receipts as proof of payment. The STS has also reduced tax \ncompliance costs and scope for informal payments by introducing additional one-stop shops \nwith no-contact windows for taxpayers in rural areas. The STS has conducted a campaign to \nraise the awareness of taxpayers in all regions regarding the use of new mechanisms (e.g., the \nelectronic declaration and the call center) to comply with tax requirements. \n15.  Subprogram 3 continues to support implementation of a single window for foreign trade \nclearance, which was piloted under subprogram 2. The new system started operating in Bishkek \nin the fourth quarter of 2013 and has issued more than 200 clearance folders for foreign trade \ntransactions. More than 60 companies so far have benefitted from the new system. The State \nCustoms Service allowed all qualified importing and exporting businesses to access its new \nADB-financed IT system for automated customs clearance procedures. The IT system was \ngradually implemented starting in December 2012 and has now reached all customs posts. \n16.  Output  2:  Access  to  finance  improved.  Subprogram  3  strengthens  the  reforms \nintroduced  in  subprograms  1  and  2.  It  further  promotes  alternative  financial  products  and \nstrengthening  of  nonbank  financing  sources,  including  microfinance  organizations.  The \nsubprogram helps increase access to finance for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) \nand microenterprises\u2014particularly for businesses owned by female entrepreneurs, who account \nfor 75% of microfinance organization borrowers. \n17.  Protection  of  creditors\u2019  rights  and  the  dispute  resolution  framework  were  further \nimproved with the enactment of legal amendments that enable accelerated court enforcement of \narbitral awards. Under subprogram 3, the government has raised awareness of leasing as an \noption for female entrepreneurs, who are good credit risks but often cannot offer collateral. \n                                                \n9  The tax patent regime is targeted at individual entrepreneurs and applies to 132 types of business activities. \nIndividual entrepreneurs pay a fixed amount (called a tax patent) for a predetermined period. \n ", "5 \n18.  A  law  was  enacted  allowing  microfinance  organizations  to  offer  additional  financial \nservices by acting on behalf of banks, and to conduct foreign exchange transactions. The \ngovernment approved a program of required measures to provide deposit insurance for small \ndepositors  in  the  event  a  microfinance  organization  fails,  including  integration  of  these \norganizations  into  the  payment  system.  These  measures  will  increase  trust  in  financial \ninstitutions, and help expand the saving products available to lower-income households. To \nsupport prudent microfinance development, the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic (NBKR) \n(i) strengthened its risk-based supervisory capacities by adopting new operational procedures \nfor offsite and onsite supervision of microfinance organizations; (ii) strengthened consumer \nprotection  and  fostered  responsible  lending  practices  for  all  financial  institutions;  and  (iii) \nintroduced legal, regulatory, and supervisory changes to prevent over-indebtedness, establish \nresponsible  product  pricing,  and  increase  transparency  in  communications  between \nmicrofinance organizations and their clients. \n19.  Output 3: Workers\u2019 skills enhanced. The government continued to make its technical \nand vocational education and training system more responsive to market needs, and to address \nthe lack of qualified workers. Subprogram 3 has further strengthened the institutional framework \nfor workers\u2019 skills development that was introduced under subprogram 2, by establishing (i) \nappropriate rules on the composition and functioning of sector skills development councils, \nincluding  the  need  for  broad  participation  of  private  sector  stakeholders  and  female \nentrepreneurs; and (ii) councils to expand dialogue between businesses and government in two \nadditional sectors\u2014energy and mining. \n20.  The Agency for Vocational Education, with ADB support, has established competency-\nbased training for 18 occupations in more than 30 schools.10 The agency began implementing a \nmarketing plan that aims to increase female enrollment in technology-based and nontraditional \nvocational education training programs. This is expected to bring more women into better-paid \njobs and help reduce the salary gap between men and women. \n21.  Output  4:  Public\u2013private  partnerships  facilitated.  The  government  has  further \ndeveloped the policy, legal, and institutional framework for PPPs that was established under \nsubprograms 1 and 2. Under Subprogram 3, the government has amended relevant laws and \nregulations  to  align  them  with  the  PPP  Law,11 adopted  standard  development  and  tender \nprocedures for PPP projects, established a Project Development Support Facility (PDSF) with \nadequate rules and funding, and built initial capacity in the ministries of Economy, Finance, \nTransport  and  Communications,  and  Health,  as  well  as  in  the  Bishkek  City  Development \nAuthority, to prepare and implement PPP projects. \n22.  The PDSF will finance the development of potential PPP projects including costs of \nengaging consultants and transaction advisors to increase the quality and quantity of successful \nPPPs and government decision-making. The government has allocated $2 million to the PDSF \nin the 2014 budget and has committed to additional allocations in 2015 and 2016. \n                                                \n10 Electric and gas welder; electrician (household equipment); electrician (electric equipment); electrician (power \nstations and networks); motor mechanic; plumber; plasterer, paver; master gypsum plasterboard construction; \nmaster finisher; joiner-carpenter; junior veterinary assistant; farmer; operator on agricultural products processing; \nhotel industry worker; cook; tailor; cutter; and hairdresser. \n11 Amendments were enacted to the Tax Code, the Customs Code, the Land Code, the Law on Basic Principle of \nBudget Law, the Law on Financial and Economic Conditions of Local Self-Government, the laws on the Status of \nthe Capital City Bishkek and the Status of the City of Osh, the Law on Local State Administration, the Law on Local \nSelf Government, and the Law on Municipal Ownership to harmonize them with the PPP law. \n ", "6 \n23.  The pipeline of PPP projects has made good progress under subprogram 3, with 21 \nproject proposals identified to date by three line ministries and the City of Bishkek. The Ministry \nof Economy has prepared position papers on six project proposals being considered for PPPs.12 \nThree feasibility studies have been completed and two tender documents prepared for potential \nprojects. Pre-feasibility studies have been completed for five of the seven initial project ideas in \nthe health sector and two feasibility studies have been commissioned. \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n24.  The government requested a grant of $22 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources \nto finance its development program. The grant size is justified considering the government\u2019s \ndevelopment expenditures and financing needs (Table 2). The government is expected to close \nthe remaining financing gap with recourse to short-term domestic debt securities. The 2014 \nbudget  allocates  50.3%  of  available  resources  (or  13.9%  of  GDP)  to  social  expenditures \n(education, health, and social protection). The government has limited fiscal space\u2014domestic \nand external public debt were 3.4% of GDP and 44.6% of GDP at the end of 2013. \nTable 2: Kyrgyz Republic State Budget\u2019s Financing Gap for 2014 \nItem       Amount ($ million)  % of GDP \n1.

Implementation Arrangements \n25.  The Ministry of Economy is the executing agency. The implementing agencies are the \nMinistry of Economy, the Ministry of Finance, the NBKR, the STS, the State Customs Service, \nthe Agency on Vocational Education, the Single Window Center on Foreign Trade, and the \nDeposit Protection Agency. The Macroeconomic and Investment Policy Coordination Council\u2014\nchaired by the Prime Minister\u2014acts as a high-level steering committee overseeing program \nimplementation. The council convened twice during the implementation period. \n26.  Grant proceeds will be disbursed in a single tranche to the Government of the Kyrgyz \nRepublic as the recipient in accordance with ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement Procedures \nand Related Requirements for Program Loans,13 upon compliance with all policy actions and \nwith all conditions precedent to grant effectiveness. All 16 policy actions included in the policy \nmatrix of subprogram 3 have been complied with (Appendix 4). The grant proceeds will be used \nto finance the cost (excluding local taxes and duties) of items produced and procured in ADB \nmember  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and \nmultilateral sources. The implementation period for subprogram 3 is from November 2012 to \nApril 2014. Grant closing date is 31 December 2014. \n                                                \n12 The position paper is an in-principle approval or rejection of project proposals, submitted by line ministries and \nimplementing agencies, to proceed to the pre-feasibility stage. ADB has provided training to staff of the Ministry of \nEconomy and prepared a template for position papers (footnote 1). \n13 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n ", "7 \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n27.  Subprogram 3 supports economic growth through investment and employment creation. \nThe primary beneficiaries are current and future entrepreneurs and investors who will benefit \nfrom an improved legal and regulatory environment and have better investment opportunities. \nThe reforms are expected to provide indirect benefits to the working population, both employed \nand unemployed, as investment opportunities translate into job creation and better wages. \nWomen and rural entrepreneurs have been specifically targeted in subprogram 3. \n \n28.  Reducing  regulatory  costs  will  attract  more  businesses  to  the  formal  sector,  thus \nincreasing the number of formal jobs. More than 250 licenses and permits were eliminated in \n2013, bringing the total reduction under the program cluster (\u2013372) to more than 75% of the \ninitial number of licenses and permits in 2008 (470). This reduces the regulatory burden for \nfirms and scope for corruption. Mandatory use by all tax offices of centralized, computer-\ngenerated audit plans will reduce unjustified costs for firms that are in compliance.14 Labor costs \nincurred as a result of inspections is estimated to reduce total profits by 2.3% for individual \nentrepreneurs, 0.8% for SMEs, and 2.5% for farmers. The STS conducts the highest number of \ninspections  on  businesses,  visiting  71%  of  individual  entrepreneurs  and  65%  of  SMEs.15 \nElectronic tax collection will improve transparency and increase the financial system\u2019s depth. \nDocumentation for customs clearance requires an average of 23 days and $210 for exports, and \n25 days and $280 for imports. This adds up to a total of 63 days and $4,360 for a typical export \ntransaction, and 75 days and $5,150 for a typical import transaction.16 The two new IT systems \nimplemented by the Customs Service and the Single Window Center will reduce these costs. \n \n29.  Long periods before full enforcement of arbitral awards have constrained this alternative \ndispute resolution mechanism. The enactment of amendments to the Civil Procedures Code to \nenable accelerated court enforcement of arbitral awards by the state courts is expected to \nreduce the average enforcement period from 8 to 6 months. Given that 75% of arbitration cases \ninvolve loan transactions, the change is expected to reduce lending costs. The leasing market is \nstarting to benefit from the tax code revision supported by previous subprograms. The average \nvolume of leasing transactions increased from $2.3 million per year during 2008\u20132011 to $10.0 \nmillion  per  year  during  2012\u20132013.  The  government\u2019s  awareness  campaign  for  female \nentrepreneurs is expected to bring leasing benefits to female borrowers. The loan portfolios of \nmicrofinance organizations grew strongly in 2011 and 2012 to over 500,000 borrowers, but \nthere  were  increasing  cases  of  multiple  borrowing  and  possible  over-indebtedness.  NBKR \nsupervision initiated in 2012 resulted in closure of more than 180 noncompliant microfinance \norganizations, which led to a reduction of the average annual interest rates for microfinance \norganization  loans,  from  38.3%  in  2011  to  31.0%  in  2013.  Improved  supervision  of  and \nexpanded financial services (particularly deposits) offered by microfinance organizations and \nstrengthened consumer protection will ensure consumers benefit from financial transactions. \nOne of the largest microfinance organizations was transformed into a bank in November 2012, \ntaking advantage from the reforms implemented since subprogram 2. \n                                                \n14 In 2011\u20132012, with the support of the International Finance Corporation, STS introduced a concept of risk-based \nauditing and new software that creates audit plans based on pre-determined risk criteria. However, at the \nbeginning of subprogram 3, in about 50% of the offices, tax inspections were still conducted grounded on paper-\nbased plans proposed by the offices themselves. \n15 World Bank. 2011.

Workers receive premium wages in sectors that have fewer available \nworkers, particularly in manufacturing, electricity, gas and water, financial services, transport, \nand communications. For example, in 2012 monthly manufacturing worker salaries were 43% \nabove the national average. Improved standards in vocational schools, and more graduates in \nkey areas, will help firms to recruit qualified workers. Students will also benefit from increased \neconomic opportunities. \n \n31.  Subprogram 3 achieved significant milestones in the long-term process of developing an \nenabling environment for PPPs. The pipeline of potential PPP projects has been evolving, with \nimproved outcomes expected from investment projects in infrastructure and social services. \n \n32.  All  policy  actions  from  previous  subprograms  remain  intact.  Subprogram  3  did  not \npursue some previously envisaged actions, because due diligence indicated that other actions \ncan have a more immediate impact on the program\u2019s outcome, or that other development \npartners are implementing such actions. International Organization for Standardization (ISO) \ncertification of the new business registration system was not pursued because benefits will more \nlikely come from this certification after a few years of experience operating the system. The \ngovernment and female entrepreneurs have discussed the constraints to their businesses and \nfurther  actions  will  be  taken  under  the  ADB  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction Women\u2019s \nEntrepreneurship Development Project.17 The number of inspection agencies was reduced from \n21  to  12  in  2012.  As  a  consequence,  the  number  of  business  inspections  excluding  tax \ninspections declined from 21,000 in 2011 to 13,500 in 2013. The roll-out of the pre-customs \nsingle window in regions other than Bishkek and Chui requires more time and expertise, to be \nprovided by ADB\u2019s Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Regional Improvement of \nBorder Services Project.18 Online filing of pledges and payment of fees to enhance the secured \nlending framework is supported by the World Bank. No actions were deemed necessary to \nimprove credit information sharing, given the significant progress thus far.19 The subprogram \ndoes  not  include  a  data-sharing  mechanism  between  government  agencies  on  access  to \nfinance by women, because NBKR now collects sex-disaggregated data from microfinance \norganizations. Tendering  of  PPP  projects to the  private  sector  has been  delayed  pending \ndevelopment by the government of adequate guidelines on the use of budgetary funds to \nfinance project preparation. PPP sector policies will be developed in 2014 after the PPP policy \nis approved.  \n \nB.  Governance \n \n33.  The  legal  basis  for  public  financial  management  (PFM)  has  improved,  but \nimplementation challenges remain. The operational efficiency of PFM systems has improved in \nrecent years, including through automation of tax and customs operations, replacement of \nmanual reporting in some key PFM areas, introduction of management information systems, \nand modernization of treasury operations. The ongoing public expenditure review however \n                                                \n17 ADB. 2013.

In 2012, the government decided to shift from manual to electronic procurement to limit \nthe scope for corruption. The Public Procurement Development Strategy 2012\u20132014 is being \nimplemented and reaffirms the government\u2019s commitment to improved public procurement.21 \nThe Ministry of Finance, with ADB support, is establishing a centralized electronic procurement \nplatform. Five government entities are involved in pilot testing of electronic tendering.  \n \n35.  The  Kyrgyz  Republic  scores  poorly  in  Transparency  International\u2019s  Corruption \nPerception Index (150th out of 177 countries), although there has been some improvement \nfollowing the political events of 2010. Rent-seeking and corrupt practices are perceived to be \nconcentrated  in  government  agencies  that  collect  public  revenues  (e.g.,  taxes,  customs, \nelectricity fees, and social contributions), or that have regulatory or administrative powers (e.g., \ninspections,  licensing,  and  the  judicial  system).  Frequent  and  arbitrary  renegotiations  of \nconcession agreements undermine investor confidence. Legal amendments were passed in \nAugust 2012 to further increase the liability for corruption or economic crimes. Amendments \nwere made to the Constitutional Law in 2012 to lift the immunity of judges and members of the \nparliament. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed with the government. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n36.  Policy reforms are expected to have an indirect medium- and long-term impact on \npoverty,  mainly  through  increased  employment  opportunities  and  improved  livelihoods. \nReduction  of  regulatory  costs  and  increased  access  to  finance  will  increase  business \ninvestments and help economic activities. Enhancement of workers\u2019 skills is expected to have \nmore direct benefits on poverty if the poor continue to enroll in vocational schools. Subprogram \n3  includes  measures  targeted  at  the  population  outside  Bishkek,  where  poverty  is  more \ncommon. These measures include expansion of microfinance, establishment of one-stop no \ncontact windows in tax offices outside main cities, and a public information campaign in all \nregions on tax requirements. This is expected to increase the number of low-income households \nwho benefit directly from an improved business climate and better access to financial services. \n \n37.  Subprogram 3 includes policy actions designed to address obstacles faced by female \nentrepreneurs, and to promote a level playing field between male and female entrepreneurs. \nPatents (rather than other taxes) have been chosen for piloting electronic payments as they \nspecifically benefit women (70% of female entrepreneurs use the patent system). The number \nof terminals at which patents can be paid greatly exceeds the original target. Electronic filing of \ntaxes  and  no-contact  windows  in  tax  offices  will  deter  corrupt  practices  and  rent-seeking \nbehavior, which especially affects female entrepreneurs, given the existing stereotypes about \nthe role of women.22 Microfinance organizations will be able to offer additional services (e.g., \n                                                \n20 World Bank.

The expansion of leasing \nwill also benefit women, who are frequently unable to offer collateral to obtain bank credit. \nWorkshops were held to raise awareness among female entrepreneurs on the availability and \nbenefits of leasing products for business development. Increased participation by women in \ndecision making on skills development councils will promote consideration of their views in \ntechnical  and  vocational  education,  and  improve  outreach  to  girls.  Implementation  of  a \nmarketing plan to increase women\u2019s enrollment in technology-based, nontraditional vocational \neducation training programs started under subprogram 3. The government will track and report \nthe number of (i) female entrepreneurs, (ii) electronically filed tax declarations by women, (iii) \nleasing  transactions  by  women,  and  (iv)  women  who  enroll  in  modern  competency-based \ntraining for promising occupations. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n38.  Subprogram 3 has no impact on environment or on indigenous peoples, and does not \nentail any involuntary resettlement. It is classified as category C. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n39.  Major risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and \nrisk  management  plan.23 Economic  slowdown  in  neighboring  countries\u2014particularly  in  the \nRussian Federation\u2014may reduce inflow of remittances. Perception of weak government, high \nexpropriation  risk,  and  domestic  political  instability  may  deter  private  investment.  The \ngovernment  has  been  implementing  reforms  to  change  the  incidence  and  perception  of \ncorruption and expropriation risk. ADB supported a government working group that drafted \namendments to the investment legislation to ensure a more stable legal and taxation regime for \ninvestors. The overall risk assessment of the program is medium and the government has in \nplace necessary mitigating measures. The subprogram\u2019s integrated benefits and impacts are \nexpected to outweigh the costs. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n40.  The government and the Ministry of Economy have assured ADB that implementation of \nthe  subprogram  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning \nanticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the grant documents. \n \nV.
