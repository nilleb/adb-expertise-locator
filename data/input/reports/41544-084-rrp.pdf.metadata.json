Its  transition  from  a  centrally \nplanned  to  a  market  economy  has  been  among  the  fastest  and  most  ambitious  in  the  region. \nLiberal  economic  policies  and  market  mechanisms  have  dramatically  impacted  society. \nPrivatization of state-owned enterprises helped the private sector grow significantly and become \nthe main economic driver. \n \nHowever  the  reforms  remain  incomplete,  with  a  limited  modern  legal  and  regulatory \n3. \nframework  and  weak  market-based  economic  institutions  and  processes.  Despite  notable \nexamples  of  entrepreneurship  in  some  industries,  such  as  garments  and  dairy,  the  private \nsector  has  limited  productive  capabilities.  Only  in  2011  did  the  country  return  to  the  level  of \neconomic activity achieved before the breakup of the Soviet Union. \n \n4. \nEconomic  growth  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  continues  to  be  unstable,  with  annual  gross \ndomestic product (GDP) growth fluctuating from \u20130.5% to 10.5% during 2008\u20132013. Annual real \nGDP  growth  averaged  4.5%  over  this  period.  Internal  and  external  shocks  have  caused  wide \ngrowth fluctuations in the narrowly-based economy, while disruptive changes in government and \npolitical  disputes  have  affected  the  socioeconomic  situation.  Absolute  poverty  declined  from \n39.9%  to  31.7%  during  2006\u20132009,  a  period  of  strong  economic  growth.  During  2010\u20132012, \npoverty increased to 38.0% as a result of the domestic political unrest and the global economic \ncrisis.3 \n \nThe  main  factor  contributing  to  poverty  reduction  in  2006\u20132009  was  the  growth  in \n5. \nremittances, which fueled private consumption. A steady and growing flow of migrants has led \nto  a  significant  increase  in  remittances,  with  transfers  coming  mainly  from  the  Russian \nFederation and Kazakhstan. In 2013, net remittance inflows were equivalent to 24.8% of GDP, \nwhile  total  external  debt  was  80.1%  of  GDP.  Trade  deficits  have  been  mainly  financed  by \nremittances, given the country\u2019s difficulty in securing foreign capital via loans and grants. \n \n6. \nThe  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2019s  investment  climate  has  improved  since  2008,  when  the  ICIP \ncluster  implementation  began.  The  country\u2019s  ranking  in  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Doing  Business \n                                                 \n1  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in  Appendix  1.

Proposed Program Cluster, Grant for Subprogram 1, and Grant Assistance to the Kyrgyz Republic for \nthe  Investment  Climate  Improvement  Program.  Manila.  On  14  October  2011,  the  ADB  operations manual  D4  on \npolicy-based lending was revised and the program cluster approach was renamed as programmatic approach. \n\n3  National Statistics Committee. http://www.stat.kg \n\n\fReport  has  improved  from  94th  in  2007  to  68th  in  2013.4 Investment  has  increased  in  recent \nyears and was estimated at 27% of GDP in 2013. Private investment has also increased from \n17%  of  GDP  in  2007  to  an  average  of  19%  of  GDP  during  2011\u20132013  (footnote  3);  foreign \ninvestment accounted for 32% of total investment and about half of private investment over this \nperiod. Half of foreign investment has been directed to manufacturing, most of it to the Kumtor \ngold  mine.5 The  country has  attracted more foreign  direct  investment  as a  percentage  of GDP \nthan Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, but performance is slow compared to Armenia and Georgia. In \nMay  2013,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  filed  an  application  to  join  the  Customs  Union  of  Belarus, \nKazakhstan  and  Russia.  Accession  is  expected  to  change  economic  incentives  in  the  country \nand present both opportunities and challenges. \n \n7. \nDespite  these  positive  results,  further  improvement  of  the  private  sector  investment \nclimate  is  needed,  in  particular  to  enable  economic  diversification  and  reduce  dependence  on \nexternal  assistance.  The  three  primary  constraints  preventing  private  sector  from  growing  and \nproducing higher-valued products and services are: (i) a challenging business environment that \nstill discourages many entrepreneurs and investors from expanding, investing, or lending in the \ncountry;  (ii)  an  increasing  shortage  of  skilled  workers  that  prevents  firms  from  moving  up  the \nproduction ladder; and (iii) expensive, short-term finance that is concentrated in a few sectors. \n \n8. \nThe National Sustainable Development Strategy, 2013\u20132017 is based on a vision of the \nKyrgyz  Republic  as  a  nation  with  robust  economic  growth  that  is  attractive  to  investors.6 The \nstrategy  foresees  measures  to  effectively  implement  the  rule  of  law  and  combat  corruption  to \ncreate  an  attractive  environment  for  domestic  and  foreign  investors.  The  country  needs  to \nattract  private  investment  that  increases  productive  capabilities  and  creates  jobs,  and  this \nrequires more certainty about business rules and their application in the economy. \n \n9. \nSubprograms  1  and  2  of  the  ICIP  were  completed  in  2008  and  2012.  Subprogram  3 \nends the program cluster by completing key reforms needed to improve growth prospects and \nemployment  opportunities,  as  described  in  the  Development  Policy  Letter  (Appendix  3).  It \nincludes changes that improve the business environment, enhance human capital, and increase \naccess to finance, thereby addressing binding constraints to private sector development. These \nimprovements will enable more predictability, which the private sector needs for investment. The \nsupport of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is important because the political system is still \nnew and sometimes divided, and vested interests resist economic policy changes. Subprogram \n3  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan,  2014\u20132016,  for  the  Kyrgyz  Republic \nand is in line with the country partnership strategy for 2013\u20132017.7 The subprogram reinforced \nand benefitted from other ADB and development partner interventions.8 \n                                                 \n4   World Bank. Doing Business Report Series. http://www.doingbusiness.org/reports/ \n5  The  Kumtor mine produces the  majority  of  the  country\u2019s  industrial  output  and  exports.  The  concession  has  been \nrenegotiated  twice  since  its  operations  started  in  1997.  In  February  2013,  the  Kyrgyz  Parliament  directed  the \ngovernment to renegotiate the agreement again amidst allegations that Kumtor operations have caused massive \nenvironmental  destruction.  Parliament  has  yet  to  ratify  the  non-binding  Heads  of  Agreement  on  potential \nrestructuring  of  the  concession\u2019s  ownership  structure  (signed  by  the  government  and  the  private  partner  in \nDecember  2013).  ADB  has  shared  its  concerns  with  the  government  and  other  stakeholders  regarding  the \nimplications  of  the  renegotiation  on  investor  confidence,  particularly  if  the  concession  agreement  is  unilaterally \nterminated.  ADB  has  also  advocated  dialogue  between  parties.

Its \nexpected impact will be sustainable economic growth and employment creation. Its outcome is \nan improved investment climate and business environment. \n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n11. \nSubprogram  3  continues  to  focus  on  achieving  four  outputs:  (i)  reduced  cost  of \nregulatory  compliance,  (ii)  improved  access  to  finance,  (iii)  enhanced  workers\u2019  skills,  and  (iv) \nfacilitation  of  PPPs.  It  is  built  on  lessons  from  previous  subprograms,  particularly  the  need  for \nimproved monitoring and coordination; dialogue with stakeholders; and close attention to ensure \nthat benefits are shared with all regions.

The International Monetary Fund program is supported by a 3-year \nSDR66.6 million (about $100.8 million) extended credit facility arrangement approved in June 2011. Five reviews \nhave  been  successfully  completed  with  total disbursement of  SDR  57.1  million  (about  $90  million).  The  program \nremains broadly on track. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f \n12. \nOutput  1:  Cost  of  regulatory  compliance  reduced.  Subprogram  3  strengthens  the \nreforms  introduced  in  subprograms  1  and  2.  It  helps  further  reduce  the  regulatory  costs  of \noperating  a  business  and  makes  regulatory  acts  more  transparent  and  accountable,  thereby \nnarrowing opportunities for corruption. \n\n13. \nA  new  licensing  law\u2014based  on  regulatory  impact  assessment  and  drafted  with  the \nsupport  of the  United  States  Agency for International  Development\u2014was  approved  in October \n2013,  reducing  the  number  of  licenses  and  permits  from  347  to  fewer  than  200  and \nconsolidating all types of licenses and permits into a single law. The risk-based audit system of \nthe  State  Tax  Service  (STS)  was  improved  and  merged  with  the  new  integrated  information \ntechnology (IT) system developed with ADB support. Beginning in June 2013, all tax offices are \nmandated  to  implement  inspection  plans  generated  in  STS  headquarters  by  the  enhanced \nsystem.  This  is  expected  to  improve  targeting  of  tax  audits  and  reduce  the  burden  for \nbusinesses that have low risks of noncompliance. \n\nA  new  legal  and  regulatory  framework  on  electronic  tax  declarations  using  a  \u201clogin-\n14. \npassword\u201d  system  was  approved.  This  enables  full  operation  of  the  new  ADB-financed \nelectronic  system,  which  will  increase  the  number  of  taxpayers  filing  electronically  (4,665 \ntaxpayers  as  of  30  June  2013)  and  reduce  filing  costs.  The  STS  started  pilots  in  Ortasai  and \nMadina markets for electronic payment of tax patents through cash terminals and subsequently \nexpanded  this  approach  nationwide,  allowing  thousands  of  patent  holders  to  pay  their  taxes \nwithout  having  to  go  to  a  bank  branch.9 The  STS  started  accepting  payment  of  some  taxes \nthrough electronic cards, with ATM receipts as proof of payment. The STS has also reduced tax \ncompliance  costs  and  scope  for  informal  payments  by  introducing  additional  one-stop  shops \nwith  no-contact  windows  for  taxpayers  in  rural  areas.  The  STS  has  conducted  a  campaign  to \nraise the awareness of taxpayers in all regions regarding the use of new mechanisms (e.g., the \nelectronic declaration and the call center) to comply with tax requirements. \n\n15. \nSubprogram 3 continues to support implementation of a single window for foreign trade \nclearance, which was piloted under subprogram 2. The new system started operating in Bishkek \nin the fourth quarter of 2013 and has issued more than 200 clearance folders for foreign trade \ntransactions.  More than 60  companies  so far  have  benefitted from the  new  system. The  State \nCustoms  Service  allowed  all  qualified  importing  and  exporting  businesses  to  access  its  new \nADB-financed  IT  system  for  automated  customs  clearance  procedures.  The  IT  system  was \ngradually implemented starting in December 2012 and has now reached all customs posts. \n\n16. \nOutput  2:  Access  to  finance  improved.  Subprogram  3  strengthens  the  reforms \nintroduced  in  subprograms  1  and  2.  It  further  promotes  alternative  financial  products  and \nstrengthening  of  nonbank  financing  sources,  including  microfinance  organizations.  The \nsubprogram  helps  increase  access  to finance for  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs) \nand microenterprises\u2014particularly for businesses owned by female entrepreneurs, who account \nfor 75% of microfinance organization borrowers. \n\nProtection  of  creditors\u2019  rights  and  the  dispute  resolution  framework  were  further \n17. \nimproved with the enactment of legal amendments that enable accelerated court enforcement of \narbitral  awards.  Under  subprogram  3,  the  government  has  raised  awareness  of  leasing  as  an \noption for female entrepreneurs, who are good credit risks but often cannot offer collateral. \n\n                                                 \n9  The  tax  patent  regime  is  targeted  at  individual  entrepreneurs  and  applies  to  132  types  of  business  activities. \n\nIndividual entrepreneurs pay a fixed amount (called a tax patent) for a predetermined period. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fA  law  was  enacted  allowing  microfinance  organizations  to  offer  additional  financial \n18. \nservices  by  acting  on  behalf  of  banks,  and  to  conduct  foreign  exchange  transactions.  The \ngovernment  approved  a  program  of  required  measures  to  provide  deposit  insurance  for  small \ndepositors  in  the  event  a  microfinance  organization  fails,  including  integration  of  these \norganizations  into  the  payment  system.  These  measures  will  increase  trust  in  financial \ninstitutions,  and  help  expand  the  saving  products  available  to  lower-income  households.  To \nsupport  prudent microfinance  development,  the National  Bank  of the  Kyrgyz  Republic  (NBKR) \n(i)  strengthened  its  risk-based  supervisory  capacities  by  adopting  new  operational  procedures \nfor  offsite  and  onsite  supervision  of  microfinance  organizations;  (ii)  strengthened  consumer \nprotection  and  fostered  responsible  lending  practices  for  all  financial  institutions;  and  (iii) \nintroduced  legal,  regulatory,  and  supervisory  changes  to  prevent  over-indebtedness,  establish \nresponsible  product  pricing,  and \nin  communications  between \nmicrofinance organizations and their clients. \n\ntransparency \n\nincrease \n\n19. \nOutput 3: Workers\u2019 skills enhanced. The government continued to make its technical \nand vocational education and training system more responsive to market needs, and to address \nthe lack of qualified workers. Subprogram 3 has further strengthened the institutional framework \nfor  workers\u2019  skills  development  that  was  introduced  under  subprogram  2,  by  establishing  (i) \nappropriate  rules  on  the  composition  and  functioning  of  sector  skills  development  councils, \nincluding  the  need  for  broad  participation  of  private  sector  stakeholders  and  female \nentrepreneurs; and (ii) councils to expand dialogue between businesses and government in two \nadditional sectors\u2014energy and mining. \n\n20. \nThe  Agency for  Vocational  Education,  with  ADB  support,  has  established  competency-\nbased training for 18 occupations in more than 30 schools.10 The agency began implementing a \nmarketing plan that aims to increase female enrollment in technology-based and nontraditional \nvocational education training programs. This is expected to bring more women into better-paid \njobs and help reduce the salary gap between men and women. \n\n21. \nOutput  4:  Public\u2013private  partnerships  facilitated.  The  government  has  further \ndeveloped  the  policy,  legal,  and  institutional  framework  for  PPPs  that  was  established  under \nsubprograms  1  and  2.  Under  Subprogram  3,  the  government  has  amended  relevant  laws  and \nregulations  to  align  them  with  the  PPP  Law, 11  adopted  standard  development  and  tender \nprocedures  for  PPP  projects,  established  a  Project  Development  Support  Facility  (PDSF)  with \nadequate  rules  and  funding,  and  built  initial  capacity  in  the  ministries  of  Economy,  Finance, \nTransport  and  Communications,  and  Health,  as  well  as  in  the  Bishkek  City  Development \nAuthority, to prepare and implement PPP projects. \n\n22. \nThe  PDSF  will  finance  the  development  of  potential  PPP  projects  including  costs  of \nengaging consultants and transaction advisors to increase the quality and quantity of successful \nPPPs and government decision-making. The government has allocated $2 million to the PDSF \nin the 2014 budget and has committed to additional allocations in 2015 and 2016. \n\n                                                 \n10 Electric  and  gas  welder;  electrician  (household  equipment);  electrician  (electric  equipment);  electrician  (power \nstations  and  networks);  motor  mechanic;  plumber;  plasterer,  paver;  master  gypsum  plasterboard  construction; \nmaster  finisher;  joiner-carpenter;  junior  veterinary  assistant;  farmer;  operator  on  agricultural  products processing; \nhotel industry worker; cook; tailor; cutter; and hairdresser. \n\n11 Amendments  were  enacted  to  the  Tax  Code,  the  Customs  Code,  the  Land  Code,  the  Law  on  Basic  Principle  of \nBudget Law, the Law on Financial and Economic Conditions of Local Self-Government, the laws on the Status of \nthe Capital City Bishkek and the Status of the City of Osh, the Law on Local State Administration, the Law on Local \nSelf Government, and the Law on Municipal Ownership to harmonize them with the PPP law. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fThe  pipeline  of  PPP  projects  has  made  good  progress  under  subprogram  3,  with  21 \n23. \nproject proposals identified to date by three line ministries and the City of Bishkek. The Ministry \nof Economy has prepared position papers on six project proposals being considered for PPPs.12 \nThree feasibility studies have been completed and two tender documents prepared for potential \nprojects. Pre-feasibility studies have been completed for five of the seven initial project ideas in \nthe health sector and two feasibility studies have been commissioned. \n\nD. \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\nThe government requested a grant of $22 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources \n24. \nto  finance  its  development  program.  The  grant  size  is  justified  considering  the  government\u2019s \ndevelopment expenditures and financing needs (Table 2). The government is expected to close \nthe  remaining  financing  gap  with  recourse  to  short-term  domestic  debt  securities.  The  2014 \nbudget  allocates  50.3%  of  available  resources  (or  13.9%  of  GDP)  to  social  expenditures \n(education,  health,  and  social  protection).  The  government  has  limited  fiscal  space\u2014domestic \nand external public debt were 3.4% of GDP and 44.6% of GDP at the end of 2013. \n\nTable 2: Kyrgyz Republic State Budget\u2019s Financing Gap for 2014 \n\n% of GDP \n\n     Amount ($ million) \n\nItem \n1.

The Macroeconomic and Investment Policy Coordination Council\u2014\nchaired  by  the  Prime  Minister\u2014acts  as  a  high-level  steering  committee  overseeing  program \nimplementation. The council convened twice during the implementation period. \n\n26. \nGrant  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  a  single  tranche  to  the  Government  of  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic as the recipient in accordance with ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement Procedures \nand  Related  Requirements  for  Program  Loans,13 upon  compliance  with  all  policy  actions  and \nwith  all  conditions  precedent  to grant  effectiveness.  All  16  policy  actions included  in the  policy \nmatrix of subprogram 3 have been complied with (Appendix 4). The grant proceeds will be used \nto  finance  the  cost  (excluding  local  taxes  and  duties)  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB \nmember  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and \nmultilateral  sources.  The  implementation  period  for  subprogram  3  is  from  November  2012  to \nApril 2014. Grant closing date is 31 December 2014. \n                                                 \n12 The  position  paper  is  an  in-principle  approval  or  rejection  of  project  proposals,  submitted  by  line  ministries  and \nimplementing agencies, to proceed to the pre-feasibility stage.

More  than  250  licenses  and  permits  were  eliminated  in \n2013,  bringing  the  total  reduction  under  the  program  cluster  (\u2013372)  to  more  than  75%  of  the \ninitial  number  of  licenses  and  permits  in  2008  (470).  This  reduces  the  regulatory  burden  for \nfirms  and  scope  for  corruption.  Mandatory  use  by  all  tax  offices  of  centralized,  computer-\ngenerated audit plans will reduce unjustified costs for firms that are in compliance.14 Labor costs \nincurred  as  a  result  of  inspections  is  estimated  to  reduce  total  profits  by  2.3%  for  individual \nentrepreneurs, 0.8% for SMEs, and 2.5% for farmers. The STS conducts the highest number of \ninspections  on  businesses,  visiting  71%  of  individual  entrepreneurs  and  65%  of  SMEs. 15 \nElectronic  tax  collection  will  improve  transparency  and  increase  the  financial  system\u2019s  depth. \nDocumentation for customs clearance requires an average of 23 days and $210 for exports, and \n25 days and $280 for imports. This adds up to a total of 63 days and $4,360 for a typical export \ntransaction, and 75 days and $5,150 for a typical import transaction.16 The two new IT systems \nimplemented by the Customs Service and the Single Window Center will reduce these costs. \n \n29. \nLong periods before full enforcement of arbitral awards have constrained this alternative \ndispute resolution mechanism. The enactment of amendments to the Civil Procedures Code to \nenable  accelerated  court  enforcement  of  arbitral  awards  by  the  state  courts  is  expected  to \nreduce the average enforcement period from 8 to 6 months. Given that 75% of arbitration cases \ninvolve loan transactions, the change is expected to reduce lending costs. The leasing market is \nstarting to benefit from the tax code revision supported by previous subprograms. The average \nvolume of leasing transactions increased from $2.3 million per year during 2008\u20132011 to $10.0 \nmillion  per  year  during  2012\u20132013.  The  government\u2019s  awareness  campaign  for  female \nentrepreneurs is expected to bring leasing benefits to female borrowers. The loan portfolios of \nmicrofinance  organizations  grew  strongly  in  2011  and  2012  to  over  500,000  borrowers,  but \nthere  were  increasing  cases  of  multiple  borrowing  and  possible  over-indebtedness.  NBKR \nsupervision  initiated  in  2012  resulted  in  closure  of  more  than  180  noncompliant  microfinance \norganizations,  which  led  to  a  reduction  of  the  average  annual  interest  rates  for  microfinance \norganization  loans,  from  38.3%  in  2011  to  31.0%  in  2013.  Improved  supervision  of  and \nexpanded  financial  services  (particularly  deposits)  offered  by  microfinance  organizations  and \nstrengthened  consumer  protection  will  ensure  consumers  benefit  from  financial  transactions. \nOne of the largest microfinance organizations was transformed into a bank in November 2012, \ntaking advantage from the reforms implemented since subprogram 2. \n\n                                                 \n14 In 2011\u20132012, with the support of the International Finance Corporation, STS introduced a concept of risk-based \nauditing  and  new  software  that  creates  audit  plans  based  on  pre-determined  risk  criteria.  However,  at  the \nbeginning of subprogram 3, in about 50% of the offices, tax inspections were still conducted grounded on paper-\nbased plans proposed by the offices themselves. \n\n15 World Bank. 2011.

Workers  receive  premium  wages  in  sectors  that  have  fewer  available \nworkers,  particularly  in  manufacturing,  electricity,  gas  and  water,  financial  services,  transport, \nand  communications.  For  example,  in  2012  monthly  manufacturing  worker  salaries  were  43% \nabove the national average. Improved standards in vocational schools, and more graduates in \nkey areas, will help firms to recruit qualified workers. Students will also  benefit from increased \neconomic opportunities. \n \n31. \nSubprogram 3 achieved significant milestones in the long-term process of developing an \nenabling environment for PPPs. The pipeline of potential PPP projects has been evolving, with \nimproved outcomes expected from investment projects in infrastructure and social services. \n \n32. \nAll  policy  actions  from  previous  subprograms  remain  intact.  Subprogram  3  did  not \npursue some previously  envisaged actions, because due diligence indicated that other actions \ncan  have  a  more  immediate  impact  on  the  program\u2019s  outcome,  or  that  other  development \npartners  are  implementing  such  actions.  International  Organization  for  Standardization  (ISO) \ncertification of the new business registration system was not pursued because benefits will more \nlikely  come  from  this  certification  after  a  few  years  of  experience  operating  the  system.  The \ngovernment  and female entrepreneurs  have  discussed  the  constraints  to their  businesses  and \nfurther  actions  will  be  taken  under  the  ADB  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  Women\u2019s \nEntrepreneurship Development Project.17 The number of inspection agencies was reduced from \n21  to  12  in  2012.  As  a  consequence,  the  number  of  business  inspections  excluding  tax \ninspections  declined  from  21,000  in  2011  to  13,500  in  2013.  The  roll-out  of  the  pre-customs \nsingle window in regions other than Bishkek and Chui requires more time and expertise, to be \nprovided  by  ADB\u2019s  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  Regional  Improvement  of \nBorder Services Project.18 Online filing of pledges and payment of fees to enhance the secured \nlending  framework  is  supported  by  the  World  Bank.  No  actions  were  deemed  necessary  to \nimprove  credit  information  sharing,  given  the  significant  progress  thus  far.19 The  subprogram \ndoes  not  include  a  data-sharing  mechanism  between  government  agencies  on  access  to \nfinance  by  women,  because  NBKR  now  collects  sex-disaggregated  data  from  microfinance \norganizations.  Tendering  of  PPP  projects  to  the  private  sector  has  been  delayed  pending \ndevelopment  by  the  government  of  adequate  guidelines  on  the  use  of  budgetary  funds  to \nfinance project preparation. PPP sector policies will be developed in 2014 after the PPP policy \nis approved.  \n \nB. \n \n33. \nimproved,  but \nimplementation challenges remain. The operational efficiency of PFM systems has improved in \nrecent  years,  including  through  automation  of  tax  and  customs  operations,  replacement  of \nmanual  reporting  in  some  key  PFM  areas,  introduction  of  management  information  systems, \nand  modernization  of  treasury  operations.

The  Public  Procurement  Development  Strategy  2012\u20132014  is  being \nimplemented  and  reaffirms  the  government\u2019s  commitment  to  improved  public  procurement.21 \nThe Ministry of Finance, with ADB support, is establishing a centralized electronic procurement \nplatform. Five government entities are involved in pilot testing of electronic tendering.  \n \n35. \nInternational\u2019s  Corruption \nPerception  Index  (150th  out  of  177  countries),  although  there  has  been  some  improvement \nfollowing  the  political  events  of  2010.  Rent-seeking  and  corrupt  practices  are  perceived  to  be \nconcentrated  in  government  agencies  that  collect  public  revenues  (e.g.,  taxes,  customs, \nelectricity fees, and social contributions), or that have regulatory or administrative powers (e.g., \ninspections,  licensing,  and  the  judicial  system).  Frequent  and  arbitrary  renegotiations  of \nconcession  agreements  undermine  investor  confidence.  Legal  amendments  were  passed  in \nAugust  2012  to  further  increase  the  liability  for  corruption  or  economic  crimes.  Amendments \nwere made to the Constitutional Law in 2012 to lift the immunity of judges and members of the \nparliament.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed with the government. \n \nC. \n \nPolicy  reforms  are  expected  to  have  an  indirect  medium-  and  long-term  impact  on \n36. \npoverty,  mainly  through  increased  employment  opportunities  and  improved  livelihoods. \nReduction  of  regulatory  costs  and  increased  access  to  finance  will  increase  business \ninvestments  and  help  economic  activities.  Enhancement  of  workers\u2019  skills  is  expected  to  have \nmore direct benefits on poverty if the poor continue to enroll in vocational schools. Subprogram \n3  includes  measures  targeted  at  the  population  outside  Bishkek,  where  poverty  is  more \ncommon.  These  measures  include  expansion  of  microfinance,  establishment  of  one-stop  no \ncontact  windows  in  tax  offices  outside  main  cities,  and  a  public  information  campaign  in  all \nregions on tax requirements. This is expected to increase the number of low-income households \nwho benefit directly from an improved business climate and better access to financial services. \n \n37. \nSubprogram  3  includes  policy  actions  designed  to  address  obstacles  faced  by  female \nentrepreneurs,  and  to  promote  a  level  playing  field  between  male  and  female  entrepreneurs. \nPatents  (rather  than  other  taxes)  have  been  chosen  for  piloting  electronic  payments  as  they \nspecifically benefit women (70% of female entrepreneurs use the patent system). The number \nof terminals at which patents can be paid greatly exceeds the original target. Electronic filing of \ntaxes  and  no-contact  windows  in  tax  offices  will  deter  corrupt  practices  and  rent-seeking \nbehavior,  which  especially  affects  female  entrepreneurs,  given  the  existing  stereotypes  about \nthe  role  of  women.22 Microfinance  organizations  will  be  able  to  offer  additional  services  (e.g., \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n                                                 \n20 World Bank.

Major risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and \nrisk  management  plan. 23  Economic  slowdown  in  neighboring  countries\u2014particularly  in  the \nRussian  Federation\u2014may  reduce  inflow  of  remittances.  Perception  of  weak  government,  high \nexpropriation  risk,  and  domestic  political  instability  may  deter  private  investment.  The \ngovernment  has  been  implementing  reforms  to  change  the  incidence  and  perception  of \ncorruption  and  expropriation  risk.  ADB  supported  a  government  working  group  that  drafted \namendments to the investment legislation to ensure a more stable legal and taxation regime for \ninvestors.

Law no. 195, enacted on 19 October \n2013, reduces the number of licenses and permits to 98 \ntypes of activities and consolidates them in a single \nlaw. The law was prepared with USAID support. \n\n1.2 The STS to take further steps towards risk-based \nauditing of businesses by mandating all tax offices to \nimplement inspection plans generated at the central \nlevel by computer software. \n\nComplied with. In 2011\u20132012 the STS introduced with \nIFC support the concept of risk-based auditing and a \nnew audit software that generates audit plans based on \npre-determined risk criteria. However, at the beginning \nof ICIP subprogram 3, in about 50% of the tax offices, \ntax inspections were still conducted grounded on \npaper-based plans proposed by tax offices and \napproved at the regional or central level. This practice \nlacked adequate transparency and was not sufficiently \nrisk-based, imposing unjustified costs to businesses \nthat are in compliance. \n\nIn 2013, the risk-based audit system was enhanced \nand merged with the new STS integrated IT system \ndeveloped with ADB support. The enhanced system \nwas extended to all tax offices. \n\nAn STS Order was approved in May 2013 which \nmandates all tax offices to implement inspection plans \ngenerated in STS headquarters by the enhanced \nsystem starting from third quarter of 2013. This will \nimprove targeting of tax audits and reduce the burden \nfor businesses that have low risk of non-compliance. \n\n \n\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n4\n\ni\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1\n9\n\n \n \n\n \n\n\fDetailed Actions \n\nResults \n\nSubprogram 3 \n\n \n\n \n\nPrincipal Objective \n\nReduced tax \ncompliance costs \n \n\n1.3 Expand options for electronic tax filing and \npayments, with particular benefits for women \nentrepreneurs, by: \n(i)  allowing electronic submission of tax returns using \n\nlogin-password system, \n\n(ii)  starting a pilot for electronic payment of patents \n\nwhich is the tax regime for the majority of women \nentrepreneurs, and \n\n(iii) accepting payment of taxes using the national \nelectronic card payment system (Elkart). \n\n \n\n2\n0\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n4\n \n\ni\n\nComplied with. The Law no. 57 on electronic \nsubmission of tax returns using login-password system \nwas enacted on 24 April 2013. Government resolution \nno. 453, of 6 August 2013, details the implementation \nprocedures. The new system is now available to \ntaxpayers in Bishkek. It will significantly reduce costs of \nelectronic submission of tax returns and help increase \nthe number of taxpayers filing electronically (4,665 \ntaxpayers, as of 30 June 2013). \n\nIn 2013, STS started pilots in Ortasai and Madina \nmarkets for electronic payment of patents through cash \nterminals that can be used by thousands of patent \nholders. STS went beyond the initial plan and has \nalready expanded this approach: currently there are \n174 terminals across the country where patent holders \ncan pay their taxes without having to go to a bank \nbranch. Patent tax (rather than other taxes) was chosen \nfor piloting electronic payment as it specifically benefits \nwomen (70% of women entrepreneurs work under the \npatent system). \n\nSTS has signed an agreement with the Interbank \nProcessing Center accepting payment of taxes through \nthe Elkart payment system. Agreements have also \nbeen signed with 3 banks accepting payments with \ncards in ATMs. Government resolution no. 642/44/12, \nof 27 November 2013, authorizes the use of ATM \nreceipts as proof of payment of taxes. This is in line \nwith the State Program on Increase of Non-cash \nPayments. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nPrincipal Objective \n\n \n\n \n\nSubprogram 3 \n\nDetailed Actions \n1.4 Expand initiatives to reduce informal payments to \ntax officials in rural areas by establishing one-stop \nshops with no-contact windows in at least 10 tax \noffices outside main cities. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1.5 Conduct a public information campaign to raise \ntaxpayers\u2019 awareness in rural areas on how to comply \nwith tax requirements. \n\nImproved cross-\nborder trade \n\n1.6 Simplify foreign trade clearance by \n(i)  making the pre-customs single window (PCSW) \noperational with 150 customs clearance folders \nissued by the PCSW, for at least 20 companies, \nthat are electronically submitted to the Unified \nAutomated Information System (UAIS) of the State \nCustoms Service, and \n\n(ii)  implement and allow access of qualified importing \n\nand exporting businesses to the new UAIS. \n\nResults \nComplied with. STS has completed the construction of \n10 new one-stop shops with no-contact windows in the \nfollowing tax offices: Issyk-Ata, Kemin, Tyup, Jety-\nOguz, Ak-Suu, Batken, Kadamjay, Leilek, Batken city \nand Sulyukta city. \n\nThe new layout in the tax offices requires taxpayers \nand tax officials to discuss tax matters in an open \nspace where they are separated by a desk with a \nwindow. This will dissuade rent-seeking behavior that \noften occurs in closed rooms, which especially affects \nwomen entrepreneurs (given the existing traditional and \nreligious stereotypes about the role of women). \n\nComplied with. STS conducted a public \ncommunications campaign in the second half of 2013 to \ninform taxpayers about the new call center, the new \nwebsite, the new system of electronic tax declarations, \nand the new one-stop shops with no-contact windows. \nBillboards, seminars, and media clips were used in the \ncampaign. \n\nComplied with. The PCSW initiated its operations in \nBishkek in the last quarter of 2013. The system has \nbeen rolled out and nine government agencies are fully \nconnected. An agreement on electronic interchange of \ninformation between PCSW and Customs UAIS was \nsigned on 23 September 2013. As of 21 February 2014 \nthe PCSW had issued 208 customs clearance folders \nfor foreign trade transactions that have been \nelectronically received by Customs. The target for 2014 \nis 5,000 electronic clearance documents. More than 40 \ntraders and brokers have so far used the new system. \n\nThe State Customs Service has implemented the ADB-\nfinanced UAIS from October 2012 to December 2013. \nAll 40 customs posts and offices are now connected to \n\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n4\n\ni\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n2\n1\n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nPrincipal Objective \n\nDetailed Actions \n\nResults \n\nSubprogram 3 \n\nOutput 2: Access to Finance Improved \nImproved creditor \nrights and dispute \nresolution framework \n\n2.1 Enact the amendments to the Civil Procedures \nCode to enable accelerated court enforcement of \narbitral awards. \n\nDevelopment of \nfinancial leasing \nfacilitated  \n\n2.2 Ministry of Economy (i) approves and initiates \nimplementation of a time-bound action plan of \ntargeted workshops to raise awareness among \nwomen entrepreneurs on availability and benefits of \nleasing products for their business development, and \n(ii) allocates necessary resources for its \nimplementation. \n \n\nthe UAIS.
