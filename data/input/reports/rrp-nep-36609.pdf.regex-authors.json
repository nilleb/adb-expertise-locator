The  lending  will  be  a \nsector development program (SDP) loan in the total amount of \nSpecial  Drawing  Rights  (SDR)  10,418,000  ($15 million \nequivalent),  and  will  consist  of:  (i) a  program  loan  part  (the \nprogram loan) of SDR3,473,000 ($5 million equivalent) to finance \nthe initial operating costs for the proposed three key entities, i.e., \nthe Water Authority (WA) and the Water Utility Operator (WUO) \nfor Kathmandu Valley, and the National Water Supply Regulatory \nBoard (NWSRB), and subsequent rightsizing of the newly formed \nWUO  by  utilizing  the  existing  voluntary  retirement  scheme \nprocedures of the Nepal Water Supply Corporation (NWSC); and \n(ii) a  project  loan  part  (the  project  loan)  of  SDR6,945,000 \n($10 million  equivalent)  to  finance  the  performance-based \nmanagement contract, consulting services for the above three key \nentities to be established under the Program, and the completion \nof  the  computerization  of  the  billing  and  accounting  systems \ncurrently in progress under NWSC. \n   \nRationale  The absence of a clearly defined policy for urban water supply \nand  wastewater  services  has  handicapped  sector  progress  in \nNepal. The existing urban water supply utility, NWSC, which has \nbeen supported by a number of development partners for almost \n30 years, has not been able to deliver efficient services on a \nsustainable basis for the residents of the metropolitan/urban areas \nof  Kathmandu  Valley.  Undue  political  intervention,  weak \nmanagement,  and  preoccupation  with  new  investments  have \ncontributed  to  inadequate  and  inefficient  operation  and \nmaintenance, and weak revenue collection. Through a number of \nstudies, funded by the United Nations Development Programme \n(UNDP),  the  World  Bank,  and  more  recently  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), it has been recognized that since its \nestablishment,  NWSC  has  been  operating  primarily  as  a \nprocurement agency for new works and as such has not been \nable to develop the skills and corporate culture required for utility \nmanagement. ", "iv   \n   \n  The ongoing implementation of water resource development and \nwater supply projects, notably the Japan International Cooperation \nAgency-financed  Manohara  Project  and  multiagency-financed \nMelamchi Water Supply Project (MWSP), have drawn attention to \nthe great need to improve the competency and efficiency of utility \nmanagement  if  maximum  benefit  is  to  be  gained  from  these \nsubstantial investments. \n   \n  The inability of NWSC to adequately manage the existing water \nsupply and wastewater  systems has led to a clear consensus \namong the development partners and relevant agencies in the \nGovernment  of  Nepal  that  institutional  reforms  and  the \nintroduction of the private sector participation (PSP) modality for \nmanaging and improving water supply and wastewater services \nare essential to the sector\u2019s development. As a result, the PSP \nscheme  has  been  identified  as  an  integral  component  of  the \nMWSP. \n   \nObjectives and Scope  The  Program  aims  to  establish  an  appropriate  institutional \nframework  and  operational  environment  that  will  facilitate  the \nprovision of efficient and affordable water supply and wastewater \nservices in the metropolitan/urban areas of Kathmandu Valley. To \nachieve  this  objective,  the  Program  will  support  necessary \ninstitutional reforms, including the restructuring of NWSC, and the \nestablishment of three key entities, i.e., the WA and the WUO for \nKathmandu Valley, and the NWSRB. The Program will introduce \nthe PSP modality for managing water supply and wastewater \nservice  delivery  through  a  performance-based  management \ncontract. \n   \nThe Program Loan   \nObjectives  The objective of the program loan is to support the water services \nsector institutional reforms by establishing the three key entities to \nensure  a  professional  and  commercially  driven  operational \nenvironment  for  the  WUO  under  a  performance-based \nmanagement contract and by rightsizing the staff of the WUO to \nfacilitate efficient operations and management. \n   \nComponents and  The two key components of the program loan are the financing of \nOutputs  the initial operating costs for the proposed WA and WUO for \nKathmandu Valley, and the rightsizing of the newly formed WUO \nby  utilizing  existing  NWSC  voluntary  retirement  scheme \nprocedures. \n   \nProgram Loan Amount  ADB will provide a program loan of  SDR3,473,000  ($5 million \nand Terms  equivalent)  from  its  Special  Funds  resources  to  support  the \nGovernment\u2019s water services sector institutional reforms, including \nthe NWSC restructuring and the initial operating costs of the WA \nand  WUO  together  with the subsequent rightsizing of the WUO. ", "  v\n  The program loan will have a 24-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years, with an interest of 1% per annum during the \ngrace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter and such other terms \nand  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Program \nAgreements. \n   \nProgram Loan Allocation  The  Government  will  provide  SDR139,000  ($0.2 million \nand Relending Terms  equivalent) to the WA  in an equal mix of subloan and grant and \nSDR3,334,000 ($4.8 million equivalent) to the WUO in an equal \nmix  of  subloan  and  grant.  The  subloans  will  be  rupee \ndenominated and their terms and  conditions will be  defined in \nsubsidiary loan agreements, acceptable to ADB. The subloans will \nhave an interest of 9% per annum with a repayment period of 30 \nyears, including a grace period of 5 years.  Interest during the \ngrace period will be capitalized. The Borrower is the Kingdom of \nNepal. The Government will bear the foreign exchange risk. \n   \nProgram Loan Period  The  program  loan  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of \nand Tranching  approximately  9  months  commencing  from  program  loan \neffectiveness, with funds being released in two equal tranches \n$2.5 million  equivalent  each  upon  compliance  with  the  policy \nconditions  for  the  release  of  the  first  and  second  tranches, \nrespectively, as per the policy matrix (Appendix 3). The second \ntranche is expected to be released approximately 5 months after \nthe first tranche release. \n   \nThe Project Loan   \nObjectives  The objective of the project loan is to support the water services \nsector institutional reforms by introducing the PSP modality for the \nmanagement of water supply and wastewater service delivery in \nKathmandu  Valley  via  a  performance-based  management \ncontract. \n   \nComponents and  The key components of the project loan are: (i) the performance-\nOutputs  based  management  contract;  (ii) implementation  assistance \n(advisory consulting services for the three new key entities and \ncivil society/nongovernment organization monitoring); and (iii) the \ncompletion  of  ongoing  computerization  of  the  billing  and \naccounting systems for current NWSC branches in Kathmandu \nValley. \n   \nCost Estimates  The  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $15.0 million \nequivalent (including taxes and duties of $1.0 million), of which \n$7.4 million  (49.3%)  is  the  foreign  exchange  cost  including \n$0.39 million  in  interest  during  construction/project \nimplementation.

Until the establishment of \nthe WA and WUO, the EA will discharge its duties through the \nMelamchi  Water  Supply  Development  Board  (MWSDB)  as  an \nimplementing  agency  (IA),  with  the  Kathmandu  Valley  Water \nSupply Management Support Committee (KVWSMSC) being the \nproject coordination office in charge of overall management and \ncoordination  for  the  Program.  KVWSMSC  will  facilitate  the \nrequired actions for the  institutional  reforms  with  government \nagencies concerned, and will carry out the recruitment of the MC \non  behalf  of  MWSDB/MPPW.  NWSC  will  be  an  IA  for  the \ncomputerization  of  billing  and  accounting  systems.  A  contract \ncompliance unit that will be established within the board of  the \nWUO   will   assume   the   responsibilities   of   an   IA   once   the  ", "  vii \n  performance-based  management  contract  is  signed  and  will \ncontinue  as  an  IA  with  respect  to  the  supervision  of  the \nmanagement contract and other subsequent advisory consulting \nservice  contracts  for  the  WUO  until  the  end  of  project  loan \nimplementation. For the  advisory consulting services for the WA \nand the NWSRB, MPPW  will take over as an IA through the \nsecretariat of the WA. \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Physical Planning and Works \nProcurement  The procurement of all goods and services under the project loan \nwill  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement.  The  equipment  for  the  computerized  billing  and \naccounting systems required for NWSC and subsequently for the \nWUO will be procured under international shopping procedures. \nMinor items estimated to cost  $100,000 equivalent or less per \ncontract may be purchased directly, following proper procedures. \n   \nConsulting Services  For the advisory consulting services for  the three key entities, \nindividual international and domestic consultants will be recruited \nin accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \nOther arrangements satisfactory to ADB may be used for the \nengagement of domestic advisory consultants. Recruitment of the \nMC will also be carried out in accordance with ADB's Guidelines \non  the  Use  of  Consultants  using  the  quality-and-cost-based \nsection (QCBS) method with some adjustments. Consultants will \nbe  recruited  for  the  computerization  of  billing  and  accounting \nsystems  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  using  normal  QCBS  method.  Other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB may be used for the engagement of domestic \nconsultants  for  this  computerization.  Civil  society \ngroups/nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  for  the  periodic \nmonitoring/performance  benchmarking  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance with ADB's  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nusing the QCBS method based on biodata proposals. \n   \nProgram Benefits and  The  key  program  benefits  relate  to:  (i) increased  consumer \nBeneficiaries  surplus,  derived  from  improved  water  supply  and  wastewater \nservices, as well as health benefits from better environmental \nsanitation  and  personal  hygiene;  (ii) strengthened management \nefficiency; and (iii) improvements in the institutional structure, with \nthe establishment of a clearer framework for setting tariffs. \n   \n ", "viii  \nRisks and Assumptions  The main risks include: (i) general political instability and security \nissues  in  the  country  regarding  the  insurgency;  (ii) temporary \nabsence of Parliament and elected municipal government officials; \n(iii) uncertainty  regarding  the  new  decentralized  urban  service \ndelivery  modality  under  the  Local  Self-Governance  Act; \n(iv) insufficient  interest  in  the  prospective  performance-based \nmanagement contract among potential  operators  (consultants); \nand (v) the capacity of the EA and the IAs to implement the \nProgram. However, the Government has unequivocally given its \nutmost priority to the overall urban water supply sector reform as \nan essential component of the MWSP, and has continually shown \nits commitment to reform. Also, the insurgency is likely to have \nless impact on an urban-based and  institutional development- \nfocused  program  in  the  capital  region  like  this.  Indeed,  this \nProgram  can  proceed,  with  some  modifications,  even  if  the \ncommissioning  of  the  Manohara  Project  and  the  MWSP  is \ndelayed.  Furthermore,  there  is  broad-based  support  for  the \nreforms among civil society, and a number of potential operators \n(consultants)  have  already  indicated  serious  interest  in  the \nmanagement contract. The proposed ADB intervention under this \nSDP is, therefore, justifiable and timely. The EA and IAs  will \nreceive significant assistance from the main TA consultant team \nrecruited  under  TA  4096-NEP  (Kathmandu  Valley  Water \nManagement  Support  Project)  with  respect  to  the  institutional \nreforms, the recruitment of the MC, and the transition from NWSC \nto WUO/MC/NWSRB. \n ", "ix", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on two proposed \nloans to the Kingdom of Nepal for the Kathmandu Valley Water Services Sector Development \nProgram. \nII.  THE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Sector Description and Performance \n2.  The Ministry of Physical Planning and Works (MPPW) is responsible for all water supply \nand wastewater services in the country. It reviews and approves sector plans, policies, and \ndevelopment budgets. It also supervises several sector institutions, including the Department of \nWater Supply and Sewerage (DWSS), the Nepal Water Supply Corporation (NWSC), the Rural \nWater Supply and Sanitation Fund Board, and the Town Development Fund. The responsibility \nfor  water  supply  and  wastewater  services  in  the  urban  areas  of  Nepal,  including  the \nmetropolitan/urban areas of Kathmandu Valley, currently lies with NWSC. \n3.  The current piped water supply demand in Kathmandu Valley, including unaccounted-for \nwater, is estimated at 150 million liters per day (MLD). However, the combined production \ncapacity of the groundwater and surface water sources in the dry season is between 65 and 85 \nMLD and even in the wet season, the production capacity only reaches 140 MLD. Under these \nwater shortage conditions, NWSC has applied a rationing system whereby water is allowed to \nflow  to  different  sections  of  the  metropolitan/urban  area  in  rotation.  The  control  system \ndeveloped by NWSC is complex to implement as it requires NWSC staff to open and close over \n300 valves every day. The result is an inequitable distribution of water, particularly as the areas \nclose to the water sources are very difficult to isolate. While some parts of the city have an \nabundance of water, the majority of the population only receive water for a few hours every 2\u20133 \ndays and even then the pressure is low and the quality is poor. \n4.  As a result, it is common for people to sit up half the night waiting for water to arrive at \ntheir houses so that they can pump it to their roof-top storage tanks. Residents are obliged to \nspend money on ground-level water tanks, booster pumps, and water filters and even then all \nwater must be boiled prior to drinking. While the basic cost of piped water in Kathmandu may be \ncheap, the indirect costs associated with its use are unreasonably high. In a survey conducted \nunder Loan 1640-NEP (Melamchi Water Supply (Engineering) Project), it was found that 86% of \nhouseholds are compelled to use secondary sources of water such as shallow wells or private \ntanker supplies (costing in excess of $1.00/1,000 liters) just to meet their basic needs. The \nservice provided by NWSC is generally regarded as poor and the public holds NWSC in low \nesteem and does not believe that it is working in their best interests. \n5.  In addition to the poor distribution of water, the lack of adequate long-term water sources \nis one of the fundamental causes of the chronic drinking-water shortage in Kathmandu Valley. \nTo address this issue, the Government of Nepal initiated the Melamchi Water Supply Project \n(MWSP) under Loan 1820-NEP(SF), which consists of a river water diversion scheme from the \nMelamchi  Valley  to  Kathmandu  Valley,  construction  of  a  water  treatment  plant  and  bulk \ndistribution system, together with the  rehabilitation and  improvement of the secondary and \ntertiary  distribution  network.  The  MWSP  also  includes  a  wastewater  system  improvement \ncomponent. The first stage of the MWSP will convey 170 MLD, which, in combination with the \nexisting  water  sources  and  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA)-financed \nManohara Project (20.7 MLD) which will be commissioned in March 2004, will satisfy the water \ndemand of Kathmandu Valley up to 2012. ", "2  \n6.  Over the last two decades, various multilateral and bilateral agencies have attempted to \nstrengthen the performance of NWSC and its predecessors through a sequence of projects that \nhave combined technical assistance (TA), institutional support, and funds for investments. \nVarious  studies  and  reports  have  examined  how  far  these  efforts  have  improved  the \nperformance of NWSC, starting with the Pokharel Commission Report in 1987 and culminating \nwith  the  implementation  completion  report  for  the  World  Bank  Urban  Water  Supply  and \nSanitation Rehabilitation Project produced in 2000.1 These studies have identified a variety of \nfactors that explain the poor performance of NWSC, and they have emphasized the problems \ncaused by frequent and inconsistent political interference in the management of the utility. For \nexample,  the  World  Bank  report  points  out  that  NWSC  had  seven  general  managers  or \nexecutive chairpersons during the period of project implementation from October 1992 to March \n1999. There were also seven different chairpersons of the board of NWSC during this period. \nSuch frequent changes in key personnel have undermined the capacity of NWSC to develop \nand implement programs designed to improve its efficiency and quality of service. \n7.  Management problems have affected many aspects of NWSC\u2019s services and internal \noperations. For example: \n(i)  The water supply system is not only handicapped by poor management of the \ndistribution  system  and  insufficient  water  resources;  the  existing  treatment \nfacilities are also poorly managed and the distribution system itself has been \nexpanded beyond its ability to supply water. The distribution system comprises a \nmultitude of small diameter pipelines often laid in parallel along the same streets. \nIn some locations, up to 6 pipelines follow the same route; \n(ii)  Unaccounted-for  water,  which  cannot  be  accurately  measured  due  to  the \nabsence of 24-hour supply and nonfunctioning meters, is estimated at 30\u201340% of \nproduction.  Despite  substantial  investment  and  support,  NWSC  has  not \nsustained its programs to detect and fix leaks and prevent other technical losses; \n(iii)  NWSC computerized its billing records in one of nine branches in Kathmandu \nValley in 2002 and expects to computerize two more branches in 2003\u20132004. \nHowever, the majority of billing and all accounting of expenditures still rely on \nmanual ledgers. As a consequence, the company seems to be unable to produce \nproper management accounts for the whole company or each region; and \n(iv)  NWSC  has  been  criticized  as  operating  too  much  as  a  project \nexecution/procurement agency and clearly has not been able to develop the \nskills and  corporate culture required for utility management. Even then, the \neventual disbursement of the World Bank Rehabilitation Project amounted to less \nthan one third of the original project amount and only 60% of the reduced project \namount after the midterm review. \n8.  While  many  of  NWSC\u2019s  problems  are  linked  to  poor  management  and  incentives, \nequally important external factors have affected its performance. The critical one has been the \nreluctance of the Government to adopt and implement a consistent tariff policy. NWSC has \nstumbled from one financial crisis to another with tariff increases that are too small and too late. \nAs a result, the company has had problems in finding the financial resources to provide \ncounterpart funding for projects or to manage a proper program of network maintenance, \nreplacement, and extension. A large proportion of investments in increasing the coverage of \nwater distribution and sewage collection in Kathmandu Valley over the last 10 years has been \n                                                 \n1  See S. Shreshtra. 2001. Water Supply and Sewerage Service Situation in Kathmandu: A Review of Two Reports. \nWater Nepal, Vol. 8, No. 12, pp. 105\u2013120. ", "    3 \nfunded by customers or municipalities. As a consequence, NWSC has been unable to maintain \nthe technical integrity of its networks. \n9.  Funding agencies have worsened the tariff problem by failing to pursue consistent \npolicies on the conditions of their assistance. Tariff increases were required as conditions of \nappraisal and effectiveness for the World Bank Rehabilitation Project, but these conditions were \neither waived or delayed, and NWSC failed to comply with several loan covenants concerning \nits  financial  performance.  Since  the  end  of  the  World  Bank  project,  there  has  been  one \nsignificant tariff increase in February 2002 but the financial condition of NWSC is dire and the \ncompany is barely able to cover its operating costs. These financial problems are exacerbated \nby the lack of management accounting information and dubious accounting practices. \n10.  In summary, NWSC is seen in many quarters as an underperforming utility. It is unable \nto provide even the most basic services to many of its customers in Kathmandu Valley, who are \nunderstandably reluctant to pay more for what they do not receive. Remedying this situation will \nrequire an extended period of effort to improve operational performance and the quality of \nservice. At the same time, a significant increase in tariffs is unavoidable simply in order to cover \nthe immediate costs of operating and improving services. \nB.  Issues and Opportunities \n11.  The ongoing implementation of water resource development and water supply projects, \nnotably the JICA-financed Manohara Project and the multi agency-financed MWSP, have drawn \nattention to the great need to improve the level of utility management if maximum benefit is to \nbe gained from these substantial investments. \n12.  The inability of NWSC to adequately manage the existing water supply and wastewater \nsystems has led to a clear consensus among the MWSP development partners and relevant \ngovernment agencies that institutional reforms\u2014in  particular  the  introduction  of  the private \nsector participation (PSP) modality for managing and improving water supply and wastewater \nservices\u2014are  essential  to  water  services  sector  development.  Clearly  defined  policy and \ninstitutional reforms, improved governance, PSP, establishment of a  regulatory mechanism, \ncost recovery and sustainability, affordable service delivery for the poor, and optimization of the \nlimited water resources must be addressed to ensure success of the ongoing investment \nprojects. \n13.  Various options for PSP in the provision of water services in the metropolitan/urban \nareas of Kathmandu Valley were examined first by the World Bank and then  by the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) over the period 1998\u20132002. \n(i)  Full privatization or a concession contract for 20-plus years would be extremely \nrisky for any potential investor/operator. Therefore, it would be necessary to \nprovide very large incentives to induce firms to bid. Further, there is large public \nresistance to the notion of privatizing basic services such as water supply and \nwastewater. \n(ii)  The  World  Bank  attempted  to  implement  a  type  of  affermage  or  lease \narrangement\u2014called a management-lease contract\u2014under which the network \nassets were to be managed by a private operator. This operator would have \nbeen required to make limited investments in improving the network but it would \nnot  have  borne  the  full  revenue  and  investment  risks  associated  with  a \nconcession.  Two  separate  efforts  to  implement  this  arrangement  had  to  be \n ", "4  \ncancelled because too few firms with appropriate experience were willing to \nprequalify. The lesson learned from these unsuccessful efforts was that potential \nbidders regarded the risks of operating water services in Kathmandu Valley as \ntoo high relative to the investment of effort and funds required. \n(iii)  Since there is a clear reluctance among potential private parties to invest in the \nKathmandu  Valley  system,  it  seems  that  some  form  of  performance-based \nmanagement contract is the only realistic form of PSP that can be adopted in the \ncurrent circumstances. This conclusion is consistent with experience in other \ncities around the world where the existing system suffers from serious problems \nof  management  and  operations.  Such  a  management  contract  involves  the \nrecruitment  of  an  experienced  operator,  hereafter  termed  a  management \ncontractor  (MC),  to  provide  a  management  team  backed  up  by  corporate \ntechnical support to improve the utility\u2019s performance. The remuneration of the \nMC  would  be  based  on  a  combination  of  a  fixed  base  fee and additional \nrewards/bonuses for either achieving or exceeding specific performance targets. \nThere is some experience with management contracts in Nepal, but these have \nbeen on a fixed-fee basis and they have been designed for relatively short \ninterventions. It is desirable to incorporate stronger performance rewards in a \nlonger contract to ensure that the incentives for the utility and the MC are \nproperly aligned. \n14.  As a result of past experience and this assessment of the options for PSP, ADB \nconcluded that a performance-based management contract would be the most appropriate form \nof PSP for the metropolitan/urban areas of Kathmandu Valley. Since one of the goals of \nintroducing an MC is to ensure that the distribution network in Kathmandu Valley is improved so \nthat the water produced by the Manohara Project and the MWSP can be properly used, it is \nimportant  that  the  provisions  of  the  management  contract  should  be  consistent  with  the \ntimetable and goals of these projects. \n15.  Following  a  period  of  in-depth  consideration  and  consultation,  and  with  previous \nexperiences very much in mind, the proposal for PSP modality by using a management contract \nhas  been  developed  further.  This  essentially  involves  the  appointment  of  an  MC  for  the \noperation  and  management  of  the  water  supply  and  wastewater  services  in  the \nmetropolitan/urban areas of Kathmandu Valley for a predefined period of time. An experienced \ninternational operator (consultant) will be recruited via international competitive recruitment and \nwill be retained on the basis of a performance-based management contract. The level of risk, \nboth  for  the  Government  and  the  selected  MC  will  be  significantly  lower  than  under  the \npreviously considered World Bank-financed privatization scheme. \n16.  Other than the operation and management of the services, a very clear objective of the \nPSP modality and the appointment of the MC is to achieve extensive technology transfer and to \ndevelop the long-term capability of Nepalese managers and engineers to run the water and \nwastewater services either under public or local private management. The MC will assign a \nsmall team of international experts to work closely with local utility staff with the aim of easing \nthe current water crisis. The MC team will initially comprise about 5 staff but will fall to 2 to 3 as \nthe management contract proceeds. \n17.  A key component of the Program is the reduction of the number of staff working in the \nWater Utility Operator (WUO) with a view to streamlining operations, increasing organizational \nefficiency, and improving financial performance. NWSC currently has 2,100 positions, out of \nwhich 1,300 are in the Kathmandu Valley operations or in overall corporate management and ", "    5 \nadministration. The hierarchical breakdown of employees is senior management (2%), middle \nmanagement (6%),  support  staff (47%),  and  unskilled  and  semiskilled  labor (45%).  Studies \ncommissioned by the Private Sector Participation High-Level Committee, in charge of the \nrecruitment of the private operator under the earlier World Bank assistance, estimated surplus \nstaff at around 500 under the previous management-lease contract model. The studies also \nmade recommendations on functional transfer of operational support activities and  a  new \nbranch structure for the utility.2 \n18.  MC recruitment is now an essential element of the MWSP and, indeed, is an agreed \ncondition for the award of tunneling civil work contracts under both the ADB project and the \nNorwegian  Agency  for  Development  Cooperation/Swedish  International  Development \nCooperation  Agency  project  for  the  Melamchi  diversion  scheme.  As  the  award  of  these \ncontracts is now expected in 2005, MC recruitment is critical for the entire MWSP. Therefore, \nMC recruitment must be started as a matter of urgency if the current overall implementation \nschedule of the MWSP is to be maintained. \n19.  The  Kathmandu  Valley  Water  Management  Support  Project  (TA  4096-NEP)  was \napproved in April 2003 by ADB to provide support for the implementation of the Program, in \nparticular the recruitment of the MC and a number of associated institutional reforms. Several \nindividual (bridging) TA consultants have already been engaged under the TA, and the main TA \nconsultant team mobilized in mid-September 2003. This team will assist the Government until \nthe completion of the institutional reforms and successful recruitment of the MC in accordance \nwith its terms of reference that is presented in Appendix 17. The Program has been formulated \nbased on, among other things, the reports prepared by these individual consultants as well as \nby the special assistance for project implementation-2 consultant team of the Japan Bank for \nInternational Cooperation (JBIC), under the overall framework of the MWSP, which already \nincluded this Program conceptually as one of its integral components. \n20.  The proposed Program is highly relevant to ADB\u2019s country strategy and program for \nNepal to achieve sustainable poverty reduction through building effective institutions for basic \nservice delivery. In the water and wastewater sector, ADB policy advocates the adoption of an \nintegrated river basin management approach, improvement in access to quality water services, \nand  the  introduction  of  regulatory  control  and  partnerships  with  the  private  sector  for \ndevelopment, all of which are present in the Program.  Similarly, the Program is relevant to \nNepal\u2019s development objectives as defined in the Government\u2019s 10th 5-Year Plan and sets out \nas a prime objective the long-term goal of supplying a minimum level of drinking water services \nto the entire population of Nepal with increases in the level of service over the years. Further \nrelevant  objectives  of  the  plan  include  the  provision  of  appropriate  wastewater  services, \nreduction of water-borne diseases, and the removal of the burden of water fetching primarily \nassumed by women and children. \nIII.  THE PROPOSED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Objectives and Scope \n21.  The Program aims to establish an appropriate institutional framework and operational \nenvironment  that  will  facilitate  the  provision  of  efficient  and  affordable  water  supply  and \nwastewater services  in the metropolitan/urban areas of Kathmandu Valley. To achieve this \nobjective, the Program will support necessary institutional reforms, including the restructuring of \n                                                 \n2  The financing offered by the World Bank for this restructuring plan was subsequently withdrawn and the plan did \nnot materialize. \n ", "6  \nNWSC, and the establishment of three key entities, i.e., the Water Authority (WA) and the WUO \nfor  Kathmandu  Valley,  and  the  National  Water  Supply  Regulatory  Board  (NWSRB).  The \nProgram will introduce the PSP modality for managing water supply and wastewater service \ndelivery  through  a  performance-based  management  contract.  The  program  framework  is \npresented in Appendix 1 and the development policy letter is in Appendix 2. \n22.  The lending will be a sector development program (SDP) loan in the total amount of \n$15 million, and will consist of: (i) a program loan part (the program loan) of $5 million to finance \nthe initial operating  costs for the proposed WA and WUO for Kathmandu Valley, and the \nNWSRB, and subsequent rightsizing of the newly formed WUO by utilizing NWSC\u2019s existing \nvoluntary retirement scheme (VRS) procedures; and (ii) a project loan part (the project loan) of \n$10 million to finance the management contract, consulting services for the three key entities to \nbe  established  under  the  Program\u2014the  WA,  WUO,  and  NWSRB\u2014and  the  completion  of \ncomputerizing the billing and accounting systems currently in progress under NWSC. \nB.  The Program Loan \n1.  Objectives \n23.  The objective of the program loan is to support the water services sector institutional \nreforms by establishing the three key entities to ensure a professional and commercially driven \noperational environment for the WUO under a performance-based management contract and by \nrightsizing the staff of the WUO to facilitate efficient management and operations. The policy \nmatrix for the program loan is presented in Appendix 3. These reforms are essential for the \nprovision of efficient and affordable water supply and wastewater services in Kathmandu Valley. \nThe scope of the Program includes: (i) restructuring of NWSC and establishment of the WA to \nhold assets for water supply and wastewater services; determine policies and license/contract \nawards;  and  monitor  licenses/contracts  for  the  operation  of  water  supply  and  wastewater \nservices in Kathmandu Valley; and (ii) establishment of the WUO to operate the water supply \nand wastewater services in Kathmandu Valley, under a license granted by the WA; and the \nrightsizing of the WUO. \n2.  Components and Outputs \n24.  Implementation  milestones  for  the  program  loan  are  identified  in  the  policy  matrix \n(Appendix 3). The two key components of the program loan are  the financing of the  initial \noperating costs for the proposed WA and WUO for Kathmandu Valley, and the rightsizing of the \nnewly formed WUO by utilizing existing NWSC VRS procedures supplemented, as appropriate, \nby additional VRS procedures for all categories of NWSC contract/temporary staff who are not \ncovered under the current NWSC VRS procedures. \n3.  Important Features\u2014Water Sector Institutional Reforms \n25.  The water sector institutional reforms included under the program loan will involve the \nrestructuring  of  NWSC  and  the  establishment  of  the  WA  and  WUO,  together  with  the \nestablishment of the NWSRB as originally envisaged under the MWSP. The background to the \nselection  of  the  proposed  new  institutional  arrangement  is  presented  in  Appendix  4.  The \nbackground was extensively discussed and subsequently agreed among ADB and other MWSP \nexternal  funding  agencies,  in  particular  JBIC  and  its  special  assistance  for  project \nimplementation-2 consultant team. ", "    7 \na.  Water Authority \n26.  The main functions of the WA will be to: \n(i)  act as the asset owner of the water supply and wastewater systems in  the \nmetropolitan/urban areas of Kathmandu Valley. In due course, the infrastructure \ndeveloped under MWSP  will be transferred to the WA as well. As  the asset \nowner, the WA will be responsible for ensuring the development of the additional \ninfrastructure required for the expansion of the water supply and wastewater \nsystems in  the future. Major projects to develop infrastructure for  additional \ninterbasin raw water transfer schemes will also be the responsibilities of the WA, \nand may be delegated to a body established specifically for that purpose; \n(ii)  award and monitor a license for the operation and management  of the water \nsupply  and  wastewater  systems  serving  the  metropolitan/urban  areas  of \nKathmandu Valley; and to award and monitor contract(s) for the operation and \nmaintenance  of  the  interbasin  raw  water  transfer  scheme  infrastructure \nconstructed under MWSP and any subsequent projects; \n(iii)  develop  and  oversee  the  implementation  of  policies  for  water  supply  and \nwastewater services in Kathmandu Valley; and \n(iv)  identify the need and obtain funding for future development of the water supply \nand wastewater systems. \n27.  The WA will be governed by a board, with a chairperson appointed by the Government, \nand will include representatives of: the Government, five municipalities in Kathmandu Valley, \nthree district development committees (DDCs) in Kathmandu Valley, professional associations \nand the business community, and civil society. \n28.  The WA will have a small secretariat that will primarily focus on policy issues, financial \nmanagement of the authority\u2019s assets and liabilities, and monitoring the performance of the \nWUO.  It  will  appoint  independent  technical  auditors  to  audit  the  technical  and  service \nperformance of the WUO. It will be required to publish and make available to the public an \nannual report covering the performance of the water supply and wastewater systems, future \ninvestment plans, and major policy issues. \n29.  The assets and liabilities of NWSC relating to the water supply and wastewater systems \nin  the  metropolitan/urban areas  in  Kathmandu  Valley  will  be  transferred  to  the  WA.  The \nGovernment will allocate a proper portion of existing debts owed by NWSC to the WA. The \nprovisions of the operation and management license awarded by the WA to the WUO will \ninclude regular license fees to be made by the WUO to the WA that will cover the costs of \n(i) interest on outstanding debts linked to the assets of the water supply and wastewater \nsystems  transferred  to  the  WA,  (ii) depreciation  of  these  assets,  and  (iii) a  part  of  the \nadministrative costs of the WA. The WA will be required to maintain separate accounts for its \nadministrative activities as an asset owner. After meeting the costs of debt service, the WA will \nuse any surplus funds to finance investments in the water supply and wastewater systems in \nKathmandu Valley. \n30.  The establishment of the WA as the asset owner of the water supply and wastewater \nsystems in Kathmandu Valley will be carried out by  enactment of  a new act. This will  also \nrequire the existing Nepal Water Supply Corporation Act (NWSC Act) to be amended for NWSC \n ", "8  \nto look after the out-of-valley towns only. This will mean that NWSC will remain as the out-of-\nvalley water authority-cum-water utility operator. \nb.  Water Utility Operator \n31.  The responsibilities of the WUO will be to operate and manage the water supply and \nwastewater systems in Kathmandu Valley transferred from NWSC and from the municipalities in \nthe case of combined storm-water drains-cum-sewers, plus any further extensions to these \nsystems. It will be responsible for all financial and technical aspects of the operation and \nmanagement of water supply and wastewater services in Kathmandu Valley, including the \ncollection of tariffs, employment of staff, and dealing with customer complaints. \n32.  The powers and obligations of the WUO will be defined by the terms and provisions of \nthe operating license awarded by the WA. This license will include a provision to submit \ntrimesterly (once every four months) reports to the WA on specific indicators of the performance \nof  the  water  supply  and  wastewater  systems.  The  WUO  will  also  execute  a  program  of \ninvestment for the improvement and/or extension of the existing water supply and wastewater \nsystems  that  is  authorized  by  the  WA,  subject  to  the  provisions  concerning  procurement \nprocedures as stipulated in its legal framework. Each year, the WUO will prepare a rolling 5-\nyear plan for the future investment requirements of the water supply and wastewater systems. \nThis will be submitted to the WA for its approval and for the allocation of the necessary financial \nresources. As required by the WA, it will also help prepare technical plans and other project \ndocuments necessary for the future investment requirements. \n33.  The WUO will not own the assets of the water supply and wastewater systems, but it will \nbe responsible for maintaining these assets and for executing investment programs to improve \nand/or extend the systems as agreed with the WA. The WUO will be established with initial \nassets in the form of office equipment, inventories, and receivables from Kathmandu Valley \ncustomers transferred from NWSC, plus a subsidiary loan provided by the Government by \ndrawing upon the proceeds of the program loan to finance required working capital. \n34.  The WUO will be established as a limited liability company under the provisions of the \nCompanies  Act  2053.  The  shareholders  in  the  company  will  include  the  Government, \nmunicipalities within Kathmandu Valley, representatives of civil society, and a trust representing \nthe interests of employees. The Government will have an initial shareholding of less than 30% \nof the voting shares but will, in addition, hold nonvoting shares reflecting the remaining value of \nthe assets transferred from NWSC to the WUO. Provision will be made for converting these \nnonvoting shares into voting shares after the expiry of the management contract. This will allow \nthe Government to choose from various options for the delivery of water supply and wastewater \nservices in Kathmandu Valley by making appropriate use of its voting shares. \n35.  The objective of the company will be to undertake the delivery of water and wastewater \nservices in Kathmandu Valley in accordance with a high level of commercial and professional \ndiscipline. There will be no political/ex officio representation on the board of the WUO and the \narticles of association and shareholders' agreement will specify that directors of the board are to \nbe selected on the basis of specified professional and technical qualifications and experience. \n36.  The board will include four to six nonexecutive directors appointed for fixed terms of 4 \nyears, which can be renewed once or twice only, selected in accordance with a procedure and \ncriteria defined in the articles of association and shareholders' agreement. Each nonexecutive \ndirector will be paid an honorarium plus fee for attending board meetings. The directors will \nselect one of themselves to act as chairperson of the board. ", "    9 \n37.  The WUO will appoint an MC to manage all of its operations for an initial period of 4 \nyears, which will be extended, upon satisfactory performance, by an additional period of about 2 \nyears. The end of the extension period will approximate to 1 year after the commissioning of the \nMWSP. The relationship between the board of the WUO and the MC has not been finalized \nbecause it depends upon legal provisions concerning the role of directors under the Companies \nAct 2053 which are under review. The primary responsibility of the nonexecutive directors will \nbe to supervise, via a small contract compliance unit, the performance of the MC and  its \ncompliance with the provisions of the management contract. The contract compliance unit will \nbe supported, as necessary, by advisory consulting services funded under the project loan, in \nparticular for supervising the MC. The WUO board will have the power to approve or disapprove \ncertain types of strategic decisions that will have to be made by the WUO. These will include the \nrolling 5-year investment plans that must be submitted by the WUO to the WA. \n38.  The  WUO  will  prepare  an  annual  budget  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  its \noperating  license  as  the  basis  for  the  submission  of  a  proposal  to  the  NWSRB  for  the \nadjustment of tariffs. The terms of the license may specify the permitted tariff adjustments in the \nearly years of the license, in which case the role of the NWSRB will be to check that the tariffs \nproposed by the WUO comply with the provisions of the license. \n39.  The WUO will make a regular payment to the WA as defined in its operating license. In \naddition, it will pay a regulatory charge to cover the costs of the  NWSRB. The  MC will be \nrewarded by a combination of a fixed fee\u2014established at the beginning of the contract in \naccordance with its proposal\u2014plus a performance-based bonus calculated according to a \npreidentified formula  using a limited number of key performance indicators, which will be as \nsimple as possible, such as water production, revenues of the WUO, and the quality of service \nenjoyed by customers as measured by the proportion of households receiving water on a \nregular schedule. \n40.  The assessment of the performance of the WUO will be carried out by an independent \ntechnical auditor whose findings will be binding on both parties to the management contract. \nThe findings will also be shared with the NWSRB. \n41.  The  articles  of  association  and  shareholders\u2019  agreement  of  the  WUO  will  place \nrestrictions on the power to pay out dividends. The level of profits will be closely monitored by \nthe NWSRB. \nc.  National Water Supply Regulatory Board \n42.  The NWSRB will carry out proper regulatory functions to protect the public/consumer \ninterests. The function of the NWSRB may be limited to economic regulation\u2014similar to the \nfunction of the Electricity Tariff Fixation Commission\u2014focusing on review of tariff adjustment \nproposals. The TA consultant team, which will assist the Government until the completion of the \ninstitutional reforms and successful recruitment of the MC, will establish the detailed functions \nand structure of the NWSRB. After the demobilization of the TA consultant team, advisory \nconsulting services will be available for implementation assistance funded under the project loan \nduring the implementation period. The NWSRB may be a small entity\u2014only a few board \nmembers and small secretariat\u2014with mostly seasonal activities, usually once a year. The \nNWSRB will also handle customer complaints that cannot be resolved between customers and \nthe WUO. The findings of the performance assessment of the WUO to be carried out by an \nindependent technical auditor will be shared with the NWSRB. Also, the NWSRB will use the \nfindings of periodic monitoring/performance benchmarking of the water supply and wastewater \nservice delivery under the new institutional framework to be carried out by qualified civil society \n ", "10  \ngroups/nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  as  a  part  of  the  implementation  assistance \nfunded under the project loan. \nd.  Rightsizing of the Water Utility Operator \n43.  One of the primary components of the program loan is assistance in the rightsizing of the \nWUO. All NWSC staff, including all categories of contract/temporary staff, currently working on \nKathmandu Valley water supply and wastewater services will initially be seconded to the WUO \nfor a probation period of 1 year prior to becoming its full-time employees. Those staff who do not \nbecome full-time employees of the WUO will return to NWSC either during or at the end of the \nprobation period and will, subject to NWSC\u2019s decision, be eligible for the VRS or reassigned \nwithin  NWSC.  Alternatively,  those  staff  who  already  qualify  for  the  VRS  at  the  time  of \nsecondment to the WUO may elect for early retirement at that time. \n44.  Rightsizing  will  be  carried  out  under  the  existing  NWSC  Act,  in  particular  NWSC \nEmployees\u2019 By-Laws, which cover procedures for retrenchment and collective dispute resolution \nrelating to rightsizing, and the operational procedures of ADB with respect to monetary VRS \npackages and nonmonetary assistance. Appropriate grievance procedures will be developed. \nThe program loan will also finance nonmonetary assistance, such as skills training, business \nadvisory  services,  and  identification  of  new  jobs.  The  TA  consultant  team  will  help  the \nGovernment evaluate the past/existing VRSs adopted in Nepal, and design an appropriate \npackage for the program loan. \n45.  The TA consultant team will draw on the work of the Private Sector Participation High-\nLevel Committee on NWSC rightsizing and will recommend an operational structure, estimate \nupdated staff redundancies, and prepare a rightsizing plan. The design of the rightsizing plan for \nthe WUO will be in line with the past/existing VRSs of similar government entities and will be \ncarried out in a participatory and consultative manner with representatives of all relevant \nstakeholders, including employees of NWSC. \n4.  Financing Plan \n46.  ADB will provide a program loan of Special Drawing Rights (SDR) 3,473,000 ($5 million \nequivalent)  from  its  Special  Funds  resources  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  water  sector \ninstitutional reforms, including NWSC restructuring  and the initial operating costs  (e.g., staff \nsalaries) of the WA and the WUO during the first year of their operations, together with the \nsubsequent rightsizing of the  WUO. The program loan will have a 24-year term, including a \ngrace period of 8 years, with an interest of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum thereafter and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan and Program \nAgreements. The Government will provide $0.2 million to the WA in an equal mix of subloan and \ngrant, and $4.8 million to the WUO in an equal mix of subloan and grant. The subloans will be \nrupee  denominated  and  their  terms  and  conditions  will  be  defined  in  subsidiary  loan \nagreements, in form and substance, acceptable to ADB. The subloans will have an interest of \n9% per annum with a repayment period of 30 years, including a grace period of 5 years. Interest \nduring  the  grace  period  will  be  capitalized.  The  Borrower  is  the  Kingdom  of  Nepal.  The \nGovernment will bear the foreign exchange risk. \n5.  Implementation Arrangements \na.  Program Management \n47.  MPPW will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the program loan. Until the establishment \nof the WA and the WUO, the EA will discharge its duties through MWSDB as an implementing ", "    11 \nagency  (IA)  with  the  Kathmandu  Valley  Water  Supply  Management  Support  Committee \n(KVWSMSC) the project coordination office in charge of overall management and coordination \nfor the program loan. KVWSMSC will facilitate the required actions for the institutional reforms \nwith government agencies concerned, and will carry out the recruitment of the MC on behalf of \nMWSDB/MPPW. During this initial period, the executive secretary of the KVWSMSC will report \nall program-related issues and activities to the secretary of MPPW through MWSDB. Upon their \nestablishment, the WA and the WUO will assume the responsibilities of IAs and will continue as \nIAs until the end of program loan implementation. NWSC will closely collaborate with the WUO \nfor the implementation of NWSC's VRS. \n48.  The organizational arrangements for the implementation of the Program are presented in \nAppendix 5 and the implementation schedule is included as Appendix 6. \nb.  Period of Implementation \n49.  The implementation period of the program loan is 15 months, to be completed by June \n2005. \nc.  Procurement and Disbursement \n50.  The proceeds of the loan will be utilized to finance the full foreign exchange costs \n(excluding local taxes and duties) of items produced in and procured  from  ADB  member \ncountries. In accordance with the simplified disbursement procedures and related requirements \nfor  program  loans  (ADB  Policy  Document  R50-98),  goods  and  services  produced  and \noriginating in ADB member countries will be procured, with due consideration to economy and \nefficiency, in accordance with standard public sector procedures in Nepal that have been found \nto be acceptable to ADB, and normal private sector commercial practices acceptable to ADB. \nGoods commonly traded on the international commodity markets will be procured in accordance \nwith procedures appropriate to the trade, and acceptable to ADB. In accordance with provisions \nof ADB's  Simplification of Disbursement Procedure and Related Requirements for Program \nLoans, the proceeds of the program loan will be disbursed to the Government as the Borrower. \nThe  Government  will  (i) certify  that  the  value  of  eligible  imports,  as  defined  in  the  Loan \nAgreement for the period, is equal to, or greater than, the amount of requested withdrawal under \nthe Loan Agreement; and (ii) certify that the requested withdrawal will be used to finance eligible \nitems procured in accordance with the Loan Agreement. A list of ineligible items is presented in \nAppendix 7. \nd.  Counterpart Funds \n51.  The Government will ensure that the counterpart funds in local currency generated from \nthe  program  loan  proceeds  are  made  available  to  meet  the  costs  associated  with \nimplementation of the program loan, in particular: (i) the payment of all dues to staff of NWSC \nrelating  to  or  following  from  retrenchment,  whether  as  a  result  of  statutory  provisions  or \notherwise, including, but not limited to, wages in arrears and other benefits such as pension \ncontributions as well as severance benefits; and (ii) payments of other liabilities of NWSC. \ne.  Monitoring and Tranching \n52.  The program loan will be released over a 9-month period in two tranches of an equal \namount  to  meet  the  expected  occurrence  of  associated  costs.  The  first  tranche  of \nSDR1,736,000 ($2.5 million equivalent) will be released approximately 4 months after program \nloan effectiveness, and the second tranche of SDR1,737,000 ($2.5 million equivalent) will be \n ", "12  \nreleased approximately 5 months after the release of the first tranche, subject to compliance \nwith the conditions for their release. \n53.  Monitorable  and  time-bound  actions  are  reflected  in  the  policy  matrix.  Both  the \nGovernment and ADB will regularly and closely monitor program loan implementation. \nf.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n54.  An audit of the use of the loan proceeds will be undertaken if requested by ADB, and \nADB retains the right to (i)  examine any documents relating to the Program, and (ii) verify the \nvalidity of the certification issued by the Government for each withdrawal application. \ng.  Program Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n55.  The Government and ADB will jointly monitor and review the progress of the fund \nrelease conditions as specified in the policy matrix (Appendix 3) to ensure that they are met in \nsubstance and on schedule. \nC.  The Project Loan \n1.  Objectives \n56.  The aim of the Project is to improve, on a sustainable basis, the operation of the water \nsupply and wastewater services within the metropolitan/urban areas of Kathmandu Valley. The \nobjective of the project loan is to support the water sector institutional reforms by introducing the \nPSP  modality  for  the  management  of  water  supply  and  wastewater  service  delivery  in \nKathmandu Valley via a  performance-based management contract. There is a broad-based \nconsensus among the MWSP development partners and relevant government agencies that the \nintroduction of this approach can substantially improve the operation of water supply and \nwastewater services in Kathmandu Valley on a sustainable basis. \n2.  Components and Outputs \n57.  The key components of the project loan are: (i) the performance-based management \ncontract; (ii) implementation assistance (advisory  consulting services for  the WA, WUO, and \nNWSRB  and  civil  society/NGO  monitoring);  and  (iii) the  completion  of  the  process  of \ncomputerizing the billing and accounting systems for branches in Kathmandu Valley, which \nNWSC has already started. The bulk of the project loan will finance the  base fee payments \nunder the management contract for the 4-year initial contract term plus the extension period, \nwhile the Government will primarily cover the performance-based bonus payments through the \nWUO by means of improved tariff revenues through, e.g., better collections, higher volumes of \nwater sold, and higher tariff rates. Indicative contract packaging is proposed in Appendix 8. \na.  Management Contract \n58.  The introduction of the PSP modality in the operation of water supply and wastewater \nservices through a performance-based management contract is fundamental to the Program. In \nline  with  this  approach,  the  operation  of  the  water  and  wastewater  services  in  the \nmetropolitan/urban areas currently served by NWSC will be  reassigned to a new company \nestablished as the WUO under an operating license awarded by the WA.  An  MC will be \nrecruited  via  international  competitive  recruitment  to  manage  the  WUO.  The  MC  will  be \nresponsible for managing the operation and management of the water supply and wastewater \nservices, and the execution of investment programs to improve the distribution networks in \nKathmandu Valley. More specifically, the tasks of the MC will include: ", "    13 \n(i)  improving  the  long-term  performance  and  efficiency,  and  expanding  the \ncoverage, of water supply and wastewater services; \n(ii)  improving services to the poor through a targeted program of connections and \nservice improvements in low-income communities; \n(iii)  improving the operation and management of the water and wastewater systems \nthrough mechanisms such as more efficient revenue collection, implementation \nof  computerized  billing  and  accounting,  management  information  systems, \nimproved customer service, occupational safety and maintenance practices, and \nreduced leakage; \n(iv)  assisting and advising the WUO\u2019s board of directors in relation to strategic \nplanning, budget preparation, and tariff setting; \n(v)  improving  the  effectiveness  of  the  WUO\u2019s  human  resources  through  a \ncoordinated capacity-building program; \n(vi)  managing, in collaboration with the WA and others, the implementation of an \ninvestment program to improve the water distribution network, including bulk \nwater  metering,  properly  sequenced  network  rehabilitation,  and  renewal  of \nconnections; and \n(vii)  coordinating  the  distribution  network  improvement  investment  programs \nassociated with the construction of the Melamchi diversion scheme and water \ntreatment plant undertaken by others. \n59.  In addition to improving the performance and quality of water and wastewater services, \nan important objective of the management contract is to change the culture and operating \npractices of the utility in a manner that will permit local managers and engineers to continue to \noperate these services in an effective manner after the end of the contract. The MC will assign a \nsmall team of experienced international and domestic staff to work with the staff of WUO with \nthe goal of improving the quality of services provided for customers in Kathmandu Valley. It is \nexpected that the management team  of  the  MC will initially consist of at least 3 full-time \ninternational experts with additional experts and other specialist support being provided by the \nMC as required. The number of full-time international staff will be gradually reduced during the \ncourse of the management contract. \n60.  The management contract will be signed no later than early December 2004 and the MC \nwill commence its duties after a 1-month mobilization period. The contract will be for an initial \nperiod of 4 years, which will be extended, upon satisfactory performance, by an additional \nperiod of about 2 years. The end of the extension period will approximate to 1 year after the \ncommissioning of the MWSP in order to provide operational stability during this critical period. \nMWSDB currently projects commissioning in mid-2009. \n61.  While the MC will be primarily concerned with the overall operation and management of \nthe water supply and wastewater systems, its duties will also include the implementation of a \ndemonstration scheme, the basic concept of which is to show how well a water supply system \ncan be run when a capable and experienced management unit is put in place. This relates not \nonly to the quantity and quality of water supplied but also to the improved efficiency in meter \nreading, system maintenance, and response to customer requests/complaints. With regard to \nthe actual supply of water, the targets for the demonstration scheme can be summarized as \nfollows: \n(i)  satisfy the scheme area population\u2019s water demands so that they no longer need \nto utilize secondary sources; \n ", "14  \n(ii)  water should be of a potable standard and be esthetically pleasing; \n(iii)  water should be supplied at an adequate pressure; and \n(iv)  ideally water should be available on a 24-hour basis, although it should be \nrecognized  that  even  12  hours  supply  per  day  would  be  a  significant \nimprovement over the current situation. A key related aim is to keep the supply \nsystem full of water and under pressure so as to avoid both contamination and \nexcessive air entrainment. \n62.  Such a supply system would make filtering and boiling of water unnecessary and would \nimprove the health of the public. Through previous studies, it has already been proven that the \nwillingness to pay (WTP) for improved piped water supply services is very high. However, the \nsudden introduction of a demonstration scheme that has a significantly higher level of service \nmay not be socially acceptable because it may create the impression that an improvement in \nservice in one neighborhood is at the expense of the level of service in other neighborhoods, \nand  may  undermine  the  acceptability  of  the  MC.  In  order  to  address  this  issue,  the \ndemonstration scheme will be initiated only after a base-level service (e.g., 2\u20134 hours supply \nevery day on a regular schedule) has been achieved for the majority of the service area. Also, a \ndifferentiated tariff schedule will be proposed under which customers who receive a reliable and \nimproved level of service will be charged a higher tariff. The demonstration scheme should be \nintroduced gradually starting from a relatively small area and then expanded on a regular basis \nas the benefits of better management and operational performance are realized. The required \ndesign work for the demonstration scheme is to be carried out under the MWSP in parallel with \nthe recruitment of the MC. The actual physical works will be tendered and implemented by the \nMC  following  the  commencement  of  its  services  in  January  2005.  Further  details  of  the \ndemonstration scheme are presented in Appendix 9. Outline terms of reference for the MC is \npresented in Appendix 10. \nb.  Implementation Assistance (Advisory Consulting Services and Civil \nSociety/NGO Monitoring) \n63.  The WA and NWSRB will be established by 15 July 2004 and the WUO by 1 October \n2004. The TA consultant team and temporary staff will work with the new institutions in order to \nfacilitate a smooth transition from the NWSC management to the WA and WUO management. \nAlso, advisory consultants, including representation on legal issues related to the management \ncontract,  will  be  recruited  under  the  project  loan  as  needed  throughout  the  project  loan \nimplementation period. In addition, periodic monitoring/performance benchmarking of the water \nsupply  and  wastewater  service  delivery  under  the  new  institutional  framework  as  well  as \nevaluation of the effectiveness of the new institutional framework itself will be carried out by \nqualified  civil  society  groups/NGOs.  The  findings  of  the  periodic  monitoring/performance \nbenchmarking  and  the  institutional  effectiveness  evaluation  will  feed  into  the  project \nperformance  monitoring  and  evaluation  exercise.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for  the \nimplementation assistance is presented in Appendix 11. \nc.  Computerization of Billing and Accounting Systems \n64.  NWSC has begun a program to computerize its billing and accounting systems in its \nbranch offices serving Kathmandu Valley. It will be important for NWSC to continue with this \ntask and complete it for the remaining branch offices before the end of 2004, when its transition \nto the WA and the WUO is expected. An appropriate allowance for this task has been made \nunder the project loan. In addition, provision has been made for the computerization of the \ncentral accounting system. If NWSC cannot complete the task by its transition to the WA and \nthe WUO, the WUO will take over the  output of and  responsibility for the task, including ", "    15 \nremaining contractual responsibilities, together with  other initial assets (in the form of office \nequipment, inventories, and receivables) and obligations transferred from NWSC. \n3.  Cost Estimates \n65.  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $15.0 million equivalent (including taxes and \nduties of $1.0 million), of which $7.4 million (49.3%) is the foreign exchange cost including \n$0.39 million in interest during construction/project implementation (Table 1). The local currency \ncost is $7.6 million equivalent (50.7%). The bulk of the total cost consists of the  base fee \npayments (foreign exchange cost and local currency cost) and the performance-based bonus \npayments (local currency cost) under the performance-based management contract. \nTable 1: Summary of Cost Estimates for the Project Loan \n($ million) \n \nItem  Foreign  Local  Total \nExchange  Currency  Costs \nA.

Financing Plan \n66.  The Government has requested that ADB provide a project loan in the amount of \nSDR6,945,000 ($10 million equivalent) from its Special Funds resources, representing 66.7% of \nthe  total  project  cost.  It  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  such  a  loan  in  the  amount  of \nSDR6,945,000 ($10 million equivalent). The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years, with an interest of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum thereafter and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan and Project \nAgreements. It will cover the entire foreign exchange cost of the project loan in the amount of \n$7.4 million  (including  interest  during  construction/project  implementation  amounting  to \n ", "16  \n$0.4 million) and 34.2% or $2.6 million equivalent of the local currency cost. Local currency \nfinancing of $5.0 million equivalent, or approximately 33.3% of the total project cost, will be \nprovided by the Government and will primarily cover the performance-based bonus part of the \ncost of the management contract. The proposed financing plan is summarized in Table 2. The \nBorrower is the Kingdom of Nepal. The foreign exchange risk will be borne by the Government. \nThe Government will provide SDR347,000 ($0.5 million equivalent) to NWSC in an equal mix of \nsubloan and grant, SDR174,000 ($0.25 million equivalent) to the WA in an equal mix of subloan \nand grant and SDR6,424,000 ($9.25 million equivalent) to the WUO in an equal mix of subloan \nand grant by using the proceeds of the project loan. The subloans will be rupee denominated \nand their terms and  conditions will be  defined in subsidiary loan agreements, in form and \nsubstance acceptable to ADB. The  subloans will have an interest of 9% per annum with a \nrepayment period of 30 years, including a grace period of 5 years. Interest during the grace \nperiod will be capitalized. The Government contribution in local currency will primarily cover the \nperformance-based bonus payments due to the MC, which will be generated by the WUO by \nmeans of improved tariff revenues, through, e.g., better collections, higher volumes of water \nsold, and higher tariff rates. \nTable 2: Financing Plan of Project Loan \n($ million) \nSource  Foreign Exchange     Local Currency     Total          % \nAsian Development Bank  7.4  2.6  10.0  66.7 \nGovernment    5.0  5.0  33.3 \nTotal    7.4  7.6  15.0  100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n5.  Implementation Arrangements \na.  Project Management \n67.  MPPW will be the EA for the project loan. Until the establishment of the WUO, the EA \nwill discharge its duties through MWSDB as an IA, with the KVWSMSC being the project \ncoordination office in charge of overall management and coordination for the project loan. \nKVWSMSC will facilitate  the required actions for the  institutional reforms with  government \nagencies concerned, and will carry out the recruitment of the MC on behalf of MWSDB/MPPW. \nDuring this initial period, the executive secretary of the KVWSMSC will report all project-related \nissues and activities to the secretary of MPPW through MWSDB. Also during this initial period, \nNWSC will be an IA for the computerization of billing and accounting systems. A contract \ncompliance  unit  that  will  be  established  within  the  board  of  the  WUO  will  assume  the \nresponsibilities of an IA upon the  performance-based management contract signing and will \ncontinue  as  an  IA with respect to the supervision of the management contract and other \nsubsequent advisory consulting services contracts for the WUO until the end of project loan \nimplementation. For the advisory consulting services for the WA and the NWSRB, MPPW will \ntake over as an IA through the secretariat of the WA. \n68.  The organizational arrangements for the implementation of the Program are presented in \nAppendix 5 and the implementation schedule is included as Appendix 6. \nb.  Period of Implementation \n69.  The project loan will be implemented over a period of approximately 6 years and 8 \nmonths from about April 2004 to 31 December 2010. ", "    17 \nc.  Procurement \n70.  The procurement of all goods and services under the project loan will be undertaken in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The equipment for the computerized billing \nand accounting systems required for the WUO will be procured under international shopping \nprocedures. Minor items estimated to cost the equivalent of $100,000 or less per contract may \nbe purchased directly, following proper procedures to ensure economy, efficiency, and quality. \nd.  Consulting Services \n71.  For the advisory consulting services for the three key entities, individual international and \ndomestic consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB's  Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants. Other arrangements satisfactory to ADB may be used for the engagement of \ndomestic consultants. \n72.  The  proposed  performance-based  management  contract  is  different  from  normal \nconsulting service contracts. The MC will be recruited in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants using the quality-and-cost-based selection (QCBS) method with some \nadjustments,  which  are  elaborated  in  Appendix  10.  Consultants  will  be  recruited  for  the \ncomputerization of billing and accounting systems in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants using normal QCBS method. Other arrangements satisfactory to ADB may \nbe used for the engagement of domestic consultants for the computerization of billing and \naccounting systems. \n73.  Civil society groups/NGOs for the periodic monitoring/performance benchmarking will be \nrecruited  by  the  WA  and  the  WUO  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants using the QCBS method based on biodata proposals. \ne.  Disbursement Arrangements \n74.  A small contract compliance unit, reporting to the nonexecutive directors of the WUO, \nwill be responsible for preparing disbursement projections  for the ADB loan  and requesting \nbudgetary allocations for counterpart funds.  An imprest account  will be established  by the \nGovernment at Nepal Rastra Bank for the project loan. The imprest account ceiling shall be \nequivalent  to  6  months  estimated  expenditures  or  10%  of  the  total  project  loan  amount, \nwhichever is  less.  The  imprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,  and  liquidated  in \naccordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook and with detailed arrangements agreed \nby the Government and ADB. The contract compliance unit will coordinate timely release of \nfunds to the MC. The ADB statement of expenditure procedures will be used to liquidate and \nreplenish the imprest account for individual payments not exceeding $50,000. \nf.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n75.  Annual project audits will be conducted in compliance with international audit standards \nand Nepal\u2019s specific regulations. Project accounts and the corporate accounts of the WA and \nthe WUO will be audited annually or sooner if so required under the relevant acts under which \nthey are to be established. The accounts of the former NWSC will be separated accordingly into \nthose for the WA, WUO, and out-of-valley assets and operations. Also, auditors acceptable to \nADB will audit the use of the imprest account and statement of expenditure procedures. A \nseparate audit opinion of these should be included in the annual audit report. Audit reports will \nbe submitted to ADB within 9 months of the end of each fiscal year. \n ", "18  \ng.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n76.  In accordance with ADB's project performance management system (PPMS) guidelines, \na shortlist of verifiable performance indicators for monitoring and evaluation is to be prepared. \nPPMS activities will be conducted periodically to gather information through multiple sources, \nincluding those civil society groups/NGOs which will carry out periodic monitoring/performance \nbenchmarking of the water supply and wastewater service delivery and evaluation of the \neffectiveness of the new institutional framework, so as to determine whether the inputs for \nimplementing the project loan have rendered expected benefits to the intended beneficiaries. \nPPMS also seeks to detect any deficiency and discrepancy between the plan and the execution \nof the project loan in using the resources efficiently so that timely corrections can be made to \nadjust the design of the project loan. Further details of the PPMS are presented in Appendix 12. \nh.  Project Review \n77.  The project loan will be reviewed jointly by MPPW, WA, WUO, and ADB to assess the \nprogress semiannually and at midterm. The midterm review of the Project will concentrate on \nassessing the performance of the MC and will decide whether the option should be given to the \nMC to continue. Independent technical and financial auditors will assist MPPW, WA, WUO, and \nADB in this assessment exercise. The midterm review will also pay particular attention to the \nlevel of skills transfer that has taken place by this time and will assess the likelihood that the \nWUO will be in a position to operate and manage the water supply and wastewater services in a \nsustainable manner and without external support by the end of the extended management \ncontract period. \nIV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits and Impacts \n78.  The Program is expected to have the following benefits: \n(i)  Increased  consumer  surplus,  derived  from  improved  water  supply  and \nwastewater services, as well as health benefits from improved environmental \nsanitation and personal hygiene. Earlier studies have provided indications of a \nhigh WTP for  improved water supply services. Almost 70% of the  households \npresently connected are willing to pay a  monthly bill of NRs600 for improved \nwater  supply  services  while  almost  50%  of  the  households  presently  not \nconnected are willing to pay NRs500 per month for similar services, according to \na WTP survey carried out in 2001. These figures may be compared with a typical \nmonthly charge for an unmetered NWSC connection of NRs70 at the time the \nsurvey was carried out. For the households who are connected to the NWSC \nsystem,  the  median  WTP  is  NRs900  per  month  for  improved  water  supply \nservices, i.e., at least 50% of the sample is willing to pay more than NRs900 from \ntheir  monthly  income  to  obtain  the  improved  services.  The  mean  WTP  is \nNRs1,030  per  month  among  connected  households.  For  poor  households \ncurrently connected to NWSC system, the mean WTP is NRs800.3 The MC will \nhave  obligations  to  improve  the  availability  and  efficiency  of  water  supply \nservices, provide the services in a more equitable manner, and improve other \nrelevant aspects of the services. Benefits of providing improved services could \n                                                 \n3  The 95% confidence interval is NRs970\u20131,110 for all (poor and nonpoor) households with a connection. For the \npoor households with a connection, the 95% confidence interval is NRs680\u2013910. ", "    19 \nbe  valued  by  using  the  median  WTP  multiplied  by  the  total  number  of \nhouseholds, in order to represent the amount that households are willing to pay \nfor the improvement to the services; \n(ii)  Improved management efficiency. Existing staff morale is low. The MC could \ntransform the culture of the utility by offering commensurate rewards reflecting \nperformance and quality of service. The long-term impact of a better managed \nand more financially sustainable utility would be substantial, as opposed to the \ncurrent situation where the utility is a drain on public sector resources, since \ncurrent  tariffs  are  insufficient  to  cover  even  its  operating  costs,  let  alone \ninvestment costs; and \n(iii)  Improvements in the institutional structure, with the establishment of a clearer \nframework  for  setting  tariffs  (based  on  principles  established  in  the  legal \nframework) and an independent regulatory body in charge of tariff setting. In turn, \nthose  institutional  improvements  could  have  a  ripple  effect  on  institutional \nmanagement  (and  a  positive  impact  on  sustainable  urban  development)  in \nKathmandu  Valley  and  in  the  country  as  a  whole.  (There  are  few  shining \nexamples of successful private sector participation in Nepal and a success story \nin the water services sector could pave the way for other reforms aiming at \nintroducing private sector participation for efficiency improvements.) \n79.  The financial principles include the need for cost recovery, primarily from Kathmandu \nValley water consumers, demand management by proper pricing, ensuring access to water and \nits affordability for the urban poor, and facilitating payment of water bills. Financial projection \nreflects revenue generation improvements from the water tariff, reduction of nonrevenue water, \ngreater collection efficiency, and rightsizing of staff. With enhancement in overall operational \nefficiency, net income after depreciation and interest starts to emerge from year 2005, and cash \nsurplus  is  expected  by  year  2010  onward,  which  is  sufficient  to  serve  the  debt  service \nrepayments from year 2011. Further details of the economic analysis are presented in Appendix \n13 and of the financial analysis in Appendix 14. \n80.  In environmental terms, the Program is classified as category C. An initial environmental \nand social assessment of the Program has been carried out to identify any adverse impacts that \ncould arise as a result of its implementation. Measures to prevent or mitigate such detrimental \nimpacts have then been identified. The initial assessment reviewed and examined the scope of \nthe  potential  environmental,  health,  safety,  and  social  impacts  of  program  activities  and \ndeliverables.  The  environmental  assessment  of  the  Program  is  included  as  Appendix 15. \nParticular consideration will be given to incorporating pro-poor policies and incentives to ensure \nmore equitable distribution of resources and the provision of service levels that meet the needs \nof the poor and that are affordable. The design of such pro-poor policies will be based on \nexisting information about the poor\u2019s WTP for the services, the identification of the unconnected \npoor, and consultation exercises. \n81.  The Project does not involve any construction work directly but is focused on institutional \nrestructuring and improved asset management through a performance-based management \ncontract and start-up consulting services. Initial financing for related physical infrastructure will \nbe provided under the MWSP and other potential funding sources. The Program is an integral \ncomponent  of  the  overall  MWSP.  The  environmental  impact  assessment,  including  the \nresettlement policy framework and entitlement matrix for the overall MWSP, has been approved \nby the Government and was reviewed by ADB at the time of the MWSP project appraisal. The \nProgram will not cause any significant environmental impacts if it is carried out in accordance \nwith the applicable rules and regulations of Nepal, and with the findings of the environmental \n ", "20  \nimpact assessment. Also, there is no physical investment component under the Program that \nrequires involuntary resettlement. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy for the \numbrella MWSP has been included as Appendix 16. \nB.  Risks \n82.  The main risks include (i) general political instability and security issues in the country \nregarding  the  insurgency;  (ii) temporary  absence  of  Parliament  and  elected  municipal \ngovernment officials; (iii) uncertainty regarding the new decentralized urban service delivery \nmodality  under  the  Local  Self-Governance  Act;  (iv) insufficient  interest  in  the  prospective \nperformance-based management contract among potential operators (consultants); and (v) the \ncapacity of the EA and the IAs to implement the Program, in particular with respect to the \ncomplexity  of  the  proposed  institutional  arrangements.  However,  the  Government  has \nunequivocally given its utmost priority to the overall urban water supply sector reform as an \nessential component of the MWSP, and has continually shown its commitment to reform. Also, \nthe insurgency is likely to have less impact on an urban-based and institutional development-\nfocused project in the capital region like this. Indeed, this Program can proceed, with some \nmodifications, even if the commissioning of the Manohara Project and the MWSP is delayed. \nFurthermore, there is broad-based support for the reforms among civil society, and a number of \npotential operators (consultants) have already indicated serious interest in the contract. The \nproposed ADB intervention under this SDP is therefore justifiable and timely. The EA and the \nIAs will receive significant assistance from the TA consultant team in respect of the institutional \nreforms, the recruitment of the MC, and during the transition period between NWSC and the \nWUO/MC. In addition, the International Monetary Fund's Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility \narrangement for Nepal became effective as of 18 November 2003 to support the country's \neconomic reform. \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n83.  The Government has given the following specific assurances, in addition to the standard \nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents: \n(i)  The Government will ensure that the Program is maintained as a priority of the \nGovernment, and allocate and make available, in a timely manner, sufficient \ncounterpart funds from its budget for each fiscal year for the efficient and timely \nimplementation of the Project; \n(ii)  The Government will ensure that should the management contract be terminated \nby either WUO or the MC in accordance with the standard termination clauses \nincluded in the WUO/MC contract,  a replacement MC, acceptable to ADB, is \nappointed  without  delay  and  in  accordance  with  transparent  international \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures.  The  Government  will  further  ensure  that \nappropriate management arrangements are in place until the appointment of the \nreplacement MC to bridge the gap that may arise due to the termination of the \nmanagement contract; \n(iii)  The Government will ensure that, at all times, the board of the WUO will act \nindependently and impartially in accordance with the articles of association of the \nWUO and the shareholders\u2019 agreement entered into among the stakeholders of \nthe WUO. In addition, the Government will ensure that the nonexecutive directors \nof the WUO will be selected in accordance with the agreed criteria.

Rationale for Option 1 \n2.  The biggest factor in favor of Option 1 is that it will allow the clearest break from the \nprevious  situation  and  will  enable  the  Government  to  create  much  improved  governance \nstructures for the authority in Kathmandu Valley. Other options would require a much more \nprotracted transition process (either if the Water Authority (WA) is created at a later stage, as in \nOption 2, or if a National Urban Water Authority (or a de facto National Urban Water Authority) \nis created, as in Options 3 and 4, which would require consulting with municipalities outside \nKathmandu Valley to reach a consensus on the provision of water and sanitation services in \ntheir jurisdiction). In addition, it is in line with proposed decentralization policies for the sector, \nbecause it leaves open the question of the future arrangements for municipalities outside \nKathmandu Valley without prejudging them (as would be done with Options 3 and 4). At a later \nstage,  municipalities  may  choose  to  break  up  from  the  Nepal  Water  Supply  Corporation \n(NWSC) to create their own dual water authority/water utility operator institutional framework or \nmerely a water authority. Such process could potentially be supported by the Urban and \nEnvironmental Improvement Project (UEIP) loan, in the same way as it would be possible for \nOptions 3 and 4. \nB.  What Would Option 1 Entail? \n3.  Option 1 would entail the breakup of NWSC into three main entities: \n(i)  A WA would be established, to hold the assets for water supply and wastewater \nservices, determine policies, and award and monitor licenses/contracts for the \noperation of water supply and wastewater services in Kathmandu Valley; \n(ii)  A Water Utility Operator (WUO) would be in charge of operating water supply \nand wastewater services in Kathmandu Valley, under the terms of a license \ngranted by the WA; \n(iii)  NWSC would remain in activity in towns currently under its jurisdiction, at least \nduring an interim period. At a later stage, and according to a timeline to be \ndetermined by the municipalities themselves in accordance with the Government, \nwater supply and wastewater services in towns outside the valley could be \norganized on the basis of a model similar to what is recommended for the valley, \ni.e., the municipality would act as water authority and owner of the assets, while \na utility would be created to manage the services under the delegated authority \nof the municipality, or municipality runs its own public water authority-cum-water \nutility operator. \n4.  In addition, a National Water Supply Regulatory Board will be created to supervise the \nsector throughout the country. Its main function will be to set tariffs for the provision of water \nsupply and wastewater services on the basis of economic principles. It will also obtain and \npublish comparable information on the quality of water supply and wastewater services across \nthe country and will act as a secondary recourse mechanism for customer complaints that have \nnot been adequately addressed by the provider of water supply and wastewater services. \n ", " \nORGANIZATIONAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR IMPLEMENTATION \n \nRepresentation: \nWater Authority (WA)  Melamchi Water Supply \n- Ministry of Finance (MoF)  Development Board \n- Ministry of Physical Planning  WA Board of Directors  (MWSDB) \nand Works (MPPW) \n(Ex officio, political, advocacy) \n- Ministry of Water Resources \n(MWR) \nKathmandu Valley Water \n- Municipalities  WA Secretariat  Supply Management Support \n- District development  Committee (KVWSMSC) \ncommittees (DDCs)  Operating License \n- professional associations  er  Licensing/Economic Regulation  National Water Supply \nsf\n- Business community  an Economic Regulation  Regulatory Board \n- Civil society  et Tr SeSrvmicaell -PSrcoavlied er  Operating License  Management Contract  (NWSRB) \ns\ns Evaluation Committee \nA\nOwnership: \n(c/o KVWSMSC) \nBulk Water Supply Contract \n- Ministry of Finance (MoF) \n- Ministry of Physical Planning \nand Works (MPPW)  Water Utility Operator (WUO) \nPerformance-\n- Ministry of Water Resources    based  Management \n(MWR)  WUO Board of Directors  Management  Contractor \n- Municipalities  Contract  (MC) \n- District Development \nCommittees (DDCs) \n- trust representing interests of  Executive Committee  Nomination \nemployees \n- civil society \nWUO Board Member \nSelection Committee  WUO Staff  ApAp\n(c/o KVWSMSC)  pepe\nnn\ndd\nixix\n 5 3\nApplication/Nomination  Staff Transfer    \nEngineering consultants \nCivil work contractors \nGeneral Public/Civil Society  Nepal Water Supply  Equipment suppliers  Independent Financial  3333\nCorporation (NWSC)  and Technical Auditors  \nService contractors \n ", " \n3\n4\n \nIMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE \nA\np\nProject Component  2003  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008  2009  2010  pen\nd\n1  Institutional Reforms                                                                  ix 6\n                                                                     \n  Establishing KVWSMSC                                                                 \n                                                                   \n  KVWMSP TA                                                                 \n                                                                   \n  Bridging TA Consultants                                                                 \n                                                                   \n  Main TA Consultant Team                                                                  \n                                                                   \n2  Management Contractor                                                                  \n                                                                   \n  Short-listing                                                                 \n                                                                   \n  Proposal/Evaluation/Award                                                                 \n                                                                   \n  Management Contractor                                                                 \n                                                                   \n3  Melamchi Diversion Scheme                                                                  \n                                                                   \n  Access Roads & Power                                                                  \n                                                                   \n  Tunnel Construction                                                                 \n                                                                   \n4  Water Treatment Plant                                                                 \n                                                                   \n5  Dist\u2019n Network Improvement                                                                  \n                                                                   \n6  WW System Improvement                                                                 \n                                                                   \nKVWMSP = Kathmandu Valley Water Management Support Project, KVWSMSC = Kathmandu Valley Water Supply Management Support Committee, TA = \ntechnical assistance, WW = wastewater. \n \n ", "  Appendix 7  35 \nLIST OF INELIGIBLE ITEMS (NEGATIVE LIST) \n1.

Background \n1.  Over recent years, the level of water supply service provided to the urban population of \nKathmandu Valley has been very poor. As a result of the current rationing system operated by \nthe Nepal Water Supply Corporation (NWSC), water is only available on an intermittent basis \nand even then the pressure is low, the quantity of water small, and the quality poor. The general \npublic hold the NWSC in very low esteem and do not believe that it is working in the best \ninterests of the public. \n2.  It is common for people to sit up half the night waiting for water to arrive at their house \nso that they can pump it to their roof-top storage tanks. Residents are obliged to spend money \non ground-level water reservoirs, booster pumps, and water filters, and even then all water must \nbe boiled prior to drinking. While the basic cost of piped water in Kathmandu may be cheap, the \nindirect costs associated with its use are unreasonably high. The majority of people are obliged \nto look to secondary sources of water such as shallow wells or private tanker supplies just to \nmeet their basic needs. When tanker water costs in the order of NRs100 to NRs150 per 1,000 \nliters  (approximately  10  times  that  of  piped  water)  it  is  an  expensive  option,  especially \nconsidering that many tanker operators simply collect polluted water from the local streams and \nrivers. Where tanker supplies are unaffordable, people have no option but to go to the river to \nbathe or wash their clothes. The expense of not having an adequate supply of potable water is \ncompounded by the inevitable medical bills resulting from the treatment of water-borne diseases \n(typhoid, cholera, and hepatitis are common) and the loss of income due to sick time. \n3.  In contrast, some parts of the urban area, noticeably in the northeast, have a better level \nof service, primarily due to the their proximity to the sources and the difficulty of isolating \nsubzones during the rationing process. \n4.  There is a desperate need to achieve a more equitable distribution of water throughout \nthe urban area and to restore the public\u2019s faith in the ability of the Government to serve them \nwell. One of the principal aims of the proposed demonstration scheme is to show that a high \nquality of service can be achieved through the introduction of private sector management and \nthat if people do receive good service, then they are willing to pay a higher charge for it. At the \nsame time more realistic data can be obtained on water demand under \u201cnormalized\u201d piped \nwater supply service conditions. \nB.  Concept and Aims \n5.  The basic concept of the demonstration scheme is to show how well a water supply \nsystem can be run when a capable and experienced management unit is put in place. This \nrelates not only to the quantity and quality of water supplied but also to the improved efficiency \nin meter reading, system maintenance, and response to customer problems/complaints. With \nregard to the actual supply of water, the clear targets for the demonstration scheme can be \nsummarized as follows: \n(i)  satisfy the scheme area population\u2019s water demands so that they no longer need \nto utilize secondary sources; \n(ii)  water should be of a potable standard and be aesthetically pleasing; \n(iii)  water should be supplied at an adequate pressure; and \n ", "38  Appendix 9 \n(iv)  ideally water should be available on a 24-hour basis, although it should be \nrecognized  that  even  12  hours  supply  per  day  would  be  a  significant \nimprovement over the current situation. A key related aim is to keep the supply \nsystem  full  of  water  and  under  pressure  to  avoid  both  contamination  and \nexcessive air entrainment. \n6.  Such a supply system would make filtering and boiling of water unnecessary and would \nimprove the health of the public. Through previous studies, it has already been proven that the \nwillingness to pay for improved piped water supply services is very high. The demonstration \nscheme should have efficient systems with regard to: \n(i)  meter reading; \n(ii)  meter replacement/repair/calibration; \n(iii)  billing; \n(iv)  bill collection; \n(v)  where appropriate, the administration of water supply via public standpipes; \n(vi)  receiving customer complaints and feedback and responding accordingly; \n(vii)  installation of new connections; \n(viii)  water loss monitoring, leak identification and repair; \n(ix)  the  management  contractor  (MC)  being  seen  as  an  integral  part  of  the \ncommunity; \n(x)  hygiene education programs; \n(xi)  improved record keeping and data collection, especially water demand figures for \nthe purposes of further scheme design in the rest of Kathmandu Valley; \n(xii)  improved liaison with other utility service authorities; and \n(xiii)  financial management including operation and maintenance costs, depreciation \nof  assets,  debt  financing,  and  reinvestment  of  profits  in  further  system \nimprovement. \n7.  The MC should develop a computer model of each aspect of the water supply system, \nbut especially the demonstration scheme, and train counterpart staff in its use in order that it \ncan become one of the key planning tools for the future. The model should be linked with a \ngeographic information system and include details such as land topography, soil type, pipeline \nmaterial, customer identification, billing information, and payment records. \nC.  Timing and Social Issues \n8.  It is currently anticipated that the Manohara Project will be in operation by March/April \n2004, although it is possible that this will be delayed with ongoing land and power supply \nproblems.  This  date  is  approximately  9  months  before  the  MC  is  due  to  be  appointed \n(December  2004)  and  as  time  will  be  required  to  prepare  for  the  implementation  of  the \ndemonstration scheme, the situation may therefore arise whereby it will not be put into practice \nuntil at least 1 year after the Manohara Project has been commissioned. \n9.  There is a distinct negative aspect to this timing in that the water being supplied by the \nManohara Water Treatment Plant would already have been absorbed into the management \n ", "  Appendix 9  39 \nsystem  for  the  water  distribution  network  and  a  new  water  supply  versus  water  demand \nequilibrium established. From the social point of view, it may then be difficult to reallocate water \nto the demonstration scheme, as it will be seen to be having a negative impact on the parts of \nthe urban area not included. \n10.  The sudden introduction of a demonstration scheme that has a significantly higher level \nof service may not be socially acceptable and may undermine the authority and acceptability of \nthe MC. In order to address this issue, the demonstration scheme will be initiated only after a \nbase-level service (e.g., 2\u20134 hours supply every day on a regular schedule) has been achieved \nfor the majority of the service area. Also, a differentiated tariff schedule will be proposed under \nwhich customers who receive a reliable and improved level of service will be charged a higher \ntariff.  In  order  to  avoid  creating  the  impression  that  an  improvement  in  service  in  one \nneighborhood  is  at  the  expense  of  the  level  of  service  in  other  neighborhoods,  the \ndemonstration scheme should initially be introduced in only half of the area and be extended to \ninclude the second half once the benefits of better management and operational performance \nare realized. The required design work for the demonstration scheme is to be carried out under \nthe Melamchi Water Supply Project in parallel with the  recruitment of  the  MC. The actual \nphysical works will be tendered and implemented by the MC following the commencement of its \nservices in January 2005. \n11.  It is important that the general level of water supply is improved across Kathmandu \nValley in parallel with the implementation of the demonstration scheme and that a threshold \nlevel of water supply is reached before the scheme is fully implemented. This objective could be \nachieved by bringing forward the next phase of the bulk distribution system (BDS)/distribution \nnetwork improvement (DNI) design/construction program and to prepare the design of an \nintegrated BDS/DNI during the period of MC tender preparation and appointment. The aim \nwould be to develop a distribution system, which would have a more equitable delivery of water \nthan is currently experienced, but which would also be a first phase of the Melamchi Water \nSupply  Project.  As  suggested  in  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  special \nassistance for project implementation  report, it would be reasonable to expect overall cost \nsavings to be made in the BDS/DNI compared to the present design. Similarly, consideration \nshould also be given to conducting the detailed design of the new pipelines required within the \ndemonstration scheme in parallel with MC tender preparation and appointment. This approach \nwould have two other benefits: (i) if the operators preparing proposals for the MC contract can \nsee what construction work is about to be undertaken then they will have far greater confidence \nthat they will be able to achieve the required performance targets, and (ii) there would be a \nsaving of at least 1 year as construction work on the system upgrading could commence as \nsoon as the MC has been appointed. The need to introduce the demonstration scheme on a \nphased basis has been incorporated into the scheme planning and basic design. \nD.  Planning and Basic Design \n1.  Water Availability \n12.  Once the Manohara Water Treatment Plant has been commissioned, it is intended that \nbetween 12.2 million liters per day (MLD, in the dry season) and 14.8 MLD (wet season) of the \ntreated water produced will be conveyed to the Min Bhawan reservoir and between 4.8 MLD \n(dry season) and 5.9 MLD (wet season) will be conveyed to the Bode reservoir. It would not be \nappropriate to amend this proposed allocation of water produced by the Manohara water \ntreatment plant as: \n ", "40  Appendix 9 \n(i)  the timing is such that the water treatment plant might be commissioned at least \n1 year ahead of the demonstration scheme by which time the residents of \nMadhyapur Thimi/Bhaktapur would have already benefited, albeit in a small way, \nfrom the increase in water supply. It would not be appropriate, or indeed socially \nacceptable, to subsequently reduce the volume supplied to this area and return \nto the current situation; \n(ii)  land  in  the  Madhyapur Thimi/Bhaktapur area is already being developed in \nanticipation that water will soon be available. Reallocation of the water at this \nstage is likely to cause considerable difficulties; and \n(iii)  the 350 mm diameter transmission main from Manohara water treatment plant to \nthe Min Bhawan reservoir, which will soon be constructed, will not have the \ncapacity to convey the full 20.7 MLD flow. \nIt is therefore recommended that the demonstration scheme is established on the basis of using \na proportion of the currently allocated flow to the Min Bhawan reservoir (12.2 MLD in the dry \nseason and 14.8 MLD in the wet season). \n2.  Demonstration Scheme Location \n13.  In examining possible locations for a demonstration scheme, four key factors have been \ntaken into consideration: \n(i)  continuity of water supply to the service reservoir; \n(ii)  the  ease  with  which  the  supply  zone  can  be  isolated  from  the  rest  of  the \nKathmandu water distribution system; \n(iii)  the need for a variety of customer types as this will ensure that a comprehensive \ntariff system can be tested based on broad experience of the supply categories; \nand \n(iv)  the ease with which the demonstration scheme can be phased in over time. \n14.  Two possible demonstration schemes have been explored: \n(i)  a distribution zone served by the proposed Min Bhawan tank; and \n(ii)  a distribution zone served by the proposed Singha Durbar tank. \n15.  The supply of water to the Min Bhawan tank would be from the Manohara Project and \nwill be as secure as any in the city, as it will have a dedicated transmission main with no \nconnecting pipelines along its length. The existing distribution system in the vicinity of the tank is \nrelatively straightforward and can be isolated without excessive changes to the pipe network. \nThe demonstration scheme would have a balanced mix of medium standard housing, small \ncommercial businesses, schools and colleges, although there is no significant industry in the \narea. There are a number of poor areas, noticeably adjacent to the rivers, where squatter-type \nhousing exists. It would be relatively easy to subdivide the area into two zones, which could be \nincluded in the demonstration scheme in a phased manner. \n16.  The Singha Durbar tank would be supplied by the existing 600 mm diameter pipeline, \nwhich distributes water from the Mahankal Chaur water treatment plant, rather than by the \nManohara Project. Due to the high number of connections to this main and the ongoing \nrationing of water, the pressure in the main is low and there is considerable doubt as to whether \n ", "  Appendix 9  41 \nwater will actually be able to flow into the tank. The distribution system itself also receives water \nfrom a number of the other treatment plants serving Kathmandu. As a result of the multiple \nsupply sources, the distribution system in this part of the city is complex and it would be difficult \nto isolate the demonstration scheme. The area has a high ratio of government, army, and other \ninstitutional demands and as such would probably not be a good example for the rest of the city. \nIn addition, it would be very difficult to implement a demonstration scheme in a gradual manner. \n17.  Considering the above issues, a demonstration scheme based on the Min Bhawan tank \nwould have a good chance of success whereas one based on the Singha Durbar tank would \nnot. It is therefore proposed that efforts are concentrated on the establishment of the Min \nBhawan demonstration scheme. \n18.  It should be noted that there are other potential demonstration areas within Kathmandu, \nincluding the Chabahil area in the northeast of the city close to the Mahankal Chaur water \ntreatment plant and where there is also a good mix of customer types and isolation of the area \nwould be reasonably straightforward. However, the benefits of private sector participation will \nnot be quite so apparent here as the level of water supply is already better than average. This \narea could however be considered as a potential follow-up project once the success of the Min \nBhawan demonstration scheme has been established or indeed, consideration could be given to \nthe early imposition of a higher water tariff. \n3.  Basic Design \n19.  The Min Bhawan distribution zone, as defined in the Japan International Cooperation \nAgency basic design study report on the project for improvement of Kathmandu water supply \nfacilities (October 2001), will not be appropriate for the  demonstration scheme due to low-\npressure problems in the northern and eastern sections. The proposed limit of the zone, and \nhence the demonstration scheme, has therefore been modified and will comprise two distinct \nareas as follows: \n(i)  Area 1a\u2014located in the immediate vicinity of the Min Bhawan service reservoir \nand comprising the section of Ward 34 to the south of the New Baneswor Road; \nand \n(ii)  Area 1b\u2014located immediately to the west of Area 1a and comprising the section \nof Ward 10 to the south of the New Baneswor Road. \n20.  The housing in the demonstration scheme area is relatively new as a result of the rapid \ndevelopment over the last 5 to 10 years. The land adjacent to the New Baneswor Road is used \nfor  institutional  and  commercial  purposes.  The  area  is  served  by  a  number  of  pipelines, \nparticularly along the main road, but these are grossly undersized in comparison to the water \ndemand and the inhabitants generally rely on water tankers or shallow wells, as they receive \nvirtually no water during the dry season. New distribution pipes will be required for much of the \ndemonstration scheme area. \n21.  From an examination of available distribution network drawings, it would be relatively \neasy to isolate the two proposed areas from the rest of the Kathmandu Valley distribution \nsystem. Pipelines should not however be cut, but gate valves installed and closed as this will \nensure maximum flexibility in the future management of the distribution system. \n \n ", "42  Appendix 9 \n22.  An approximate estimate of the population has been made for each area based on the \nfigures presented for the wards in the 2001 population census: Area 1a has 13,500, Area 1b \nhas 8,500, giving a total of 22,000 people. \n23.  At this preliminary stage, it has been assumed that 100% of the population will be \nserved, 30% by full plumbing, 55% by yard tap, and 15% by public standpipe and that the per \ncapita demands for water are 150 liters per capita per day (lpcd) for full plumbing, 90 lcd for \nyard taps, and 25 lcd for public standpipes. On this basis, the average per capita demand \nacross the demonstration scheme would be in the order of 98 lcd. The total domestic demand \ncan then be calculated to be 2.2 MLD. If it is further assumed that 20% of the water will be used \nfor nondomestic purposes, then the total average water demand is 2.6 MLD. Adopting an initial \nfigure of 35.0% for physical water losses (not unaccounted-for water), the average total water \nrequired for the demonstration scheme to be successful is 4.0 MLD. \n24.  Applying the same variation in demand adopted in the Japan International Cooperation \nAgency study, but equating the peak month demand with the dry season and the low demand \nwith the wet season, the demonstration scheme water demand would be 4.4 MLD in the dry \nseason and 3.6 MLD in the wet season. Comparison with the water availability figures given \nabove of 12.2 MLD in the dry season and 14.8 MLD in the wet season indicates that there is \nmore than sufficient Manohara Project water to satisfy the needs of the demonstration scheme. \n25.  While this is clearly a satisfactory situation, the demand for water may change rapidly \nonce people see the benefits good service can bring and it would be reasonable to expect more \nhouseholds to upgrade their supply system to full plumbing or yard taps as appropriate. In \nparallel, people will also begin to invest in water-dependent devices such as washing machines, \nwhich, up to the present time, has been pointless. \n26.  In  line  with  the  social  issues  discussed,  it  may  be  preferable  to  introduce  the \ndemonstration scheme in three stages, commencing with Area 1a and following on with Area 1b \nlater, rather than in one sudden step. The separate water requirements are: Area 1a\u20142.7 MLD \nin the dry season and 2.2 MLD in the wet season; and Area 1b\u20141.7 MLD in the dry season and \n1.4 MLD in the wet season. \n27.  The aim would be to introduce each area to the demonstration scheme as improvements \nare  made  to  the  overall  water  distribution  system  serving  Kathmandu  Valley.  Using  this \napproach the development of the demonstration scheme would not unduly detract from water \nallocated to other parts of the urban area and hence the demonstration scheme will not be seen \nas a cause of increased hardship for those households not initially involved. The timing for the \nexpansion of the demonstration scheme to include Area 1b is highly dependent on both the \nsuccess  of  the  initial  demonstration  scheme  in  Area  1a  together  with  the  rate  at  which \nimprovements can be made throughout the rest of Kathmandu Valley. \n \n ", "  Appendix 10  43 \nRECRUITMENT PROCEDURES AND OUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR \nMANAGEMENT CONTRACTOR \nA.  Recruitment Procedures \n1.  In  view  of  the  earlier  unsuccessful  attempts  to  recruit  a  private  operator  under  a \nmanagement-lease contract,  the Government and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) have \nagreed to pursue a shorter performance-based management contract. Under this arrangement, \nthe management contractor (MC) will be reimbursed through a base fee (i.e., experts\u2019 inputs \nand out-of-pocket expenditures) for management services and additional  performance-based \nincentive bonus payments linked to its performance measured by a set of key performance \nindicators. A management contract, which does not require the MC to invest in the physical \ninfrastructure of the water supply and wastewater systems,  is more straightforward than  the \nearlier management-lease contract and will be more suitable given the current conditions in \nNepal. It should facilitate private sector participation by reducing risks for the Government as \nwell as for the MC and thus ensure a more competitive recruitment environment and better price \nfor the services. Recruitment of the MC will be carried out under ADB's Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants with some adjustments. \n2.  The MC will be a company or consortium (called the operator or consultant), which will \nhave direct responsibility for managing all of the operations of the Water Utility Operator (WUO). \nThe length of the contract is relatively long and greater flexibility will be allowed for the operator \n(consultant) in terms of its staffing arrangements. The MC will have to bear much greater risk \nthan a typical consultant. This is because a substantial amount of its total remuneration will be \ndependent upon its success in improving the performance of the WUO. Also, in preparing their \nproposals, operators (consultants) will have to investigate the state of the existing systems in \ngreater depth and, therefore, the costs of preparing a proposal will be higher than those \nnormally  incurred  by  typical  consultants.  Because  of  the  limited  number  of  operators \n(consultants) with required expertise, and possible limited interest in this assignment due to the \nhigh  cost  involved  in  preparing  a  competitive  proposal,  the  shortlist  may  not  meet  the \nGuidelines' requirement of \"normally 5\u20137 firms.\" \n3.  In order to come up with a shortlist of well-qualified potential operators (consultants), \nshort-listing criteria must include the following two elements: \n(i)  criteria  to  identify  potential  operators  (consultants)  that  define  the  basic \nrequirements  of  practical  operating  experience  and  financial  capacity  for \nparticipation in the preparation of proposals; and \n(ii)  a summary of the experience and skills of the operator (consultant) together with \ntheir brief responses to a specific list of questions that will focus on the way in \nwhich they have addressed or would propose to address problems similar to \nthose which will be faced by the WUO in improving the performance of water \nsupply and wastewater services in Kathmandu Valley. \n4.  Operators  (consultants)  meeting  the  criteria  will  be  considered  by  the  evaluation \ncommittee for possible short-listing based on expression of interest received.1 Primary weight in \nthis  evaluation  will  be  given  to  each  operator's  (consultant's)  corporate  experience  and \napproach to managing water supply and wastewater systems facing grave operational problems \n                                                 \n1  An interested company/consortium (consultant) will be given a preformatted expression of interest template to \ncomplete. \n ", "44  Appendix 10 \nsuch  as  those  prevalent  in  Kathmandu  Valley.  It  may  be  difficult  to  ensure  \"reasonable\" \ngeographic and country balance in the resulting shortlist of operators  (consultants), as the \nexpertise required for such services is not widely available. Therefore, it is proposed to waive \nthe Guidelines' \"reasonable\" geographic and country balance requirement for this particular \nrecruitment. However,  operators (consultants) are free to associate with any regional and \ndomestic firms and individuals from ADB member countries to strengthen their proposals. Also, \npotential operators (consultants) must demonstrate not only their in-depth technical strengths \nbut also high-quality back-up support to fulfill their commitment over the period of the contract. \nThe  short-listed operators  (consultants)  will  then  be  invited  to  submit  technical  proposals \ncontaining detailed technical plans for the operation of and improvement to the water supply and \nwastewater  systems  together  with  their  financial  proposals  according  to  the  request  for \nproposals documents, using the quality and cost-based selection method in accordance with the \nGuidelines. \n5.  The evaluation of the technical proposals submitted will give approximately equal weight \nto: (i) the qualifications of the proposed management team (i.e., a group of individuals); (ii) the \nexperience,  expertise,  and  support  facilities  of  the  operators  (consultants);  and  (iii) the \nproposals for the operation of and improvement to the water supply and wastewater systems of \nthe operators (consultants). The proposed management team for each operator (consultant) will \nbe required to make a presentation of their proposal in Kathmandu and to answer questions \nabout their experience and approach to addressing the problems faced by the WUO. The \nfinancial proposals will indicate their costs for performing the services (remuneration and out-of-\npocket  expenditures).  Under  the  contract,  the  operators  (consultants)  will  also  receive  a \nperformance-based bonus payment and details of this will be indicated in the request for \nproposals documents. Considering the unique and complex nature of this particular recruitment, \nan ADB observer will attend key evaluation committee meetings, in particular the presentation \nand interview sessions. \nB.  Outline Terms of Reference \n6.  The management contract will have the following key features:  \n \n(i)  performance-based contract, with remuneration comprising a fixed fee and \nperformance-based incentive payments; \n(ii)  performance-based payments will be linked to achievement of a limited number \nof easily measurable key performance indicators (key performance indicator \nbaseline levels will be determined during the first year of operations); \n(iii)  delivery of a number of service obligations as defined in the WUO license issued \nby the Water Authority (WA), which may include activities such as the \ncomputerization of billing, preparation of asset management plans, and specific \npro-poor activities; and \n(iv)  responsibility for implementing investments on behalf of WA/WUO and \nsupervising a major distribution network improvement program. \n \nIt is anticipated that the MC will bring in a limited number of expatriate staff and its management \nteam is likely to include several Nepalese nationals. \n \n1.  Brief Description of Scope of Work \n \n7.  The MC will be responsible for managing the operation and management of the water \nsupply and wastewater services, and the execution of investment programs to improve the \n ", "  Appendix 10  45 \ndistribution networks, in the metropolitan/urban areas in Kathmandu Valley, including the five \nmunicipalities of Kathmandu, Lalitpur, Bhaktapur, Kirtipur, and Madhyapur-Thimi in accordance \nwith agreed levels of service targets. In particular, among others, the tasks of the MC will be to: \n \n(i)  improve the long-term performance and efficiency, and expand the coverage of \nwater supply and wastewater services, in the defined service area; \n(ii)  improve services to the poor through a targeted program of connections and \nservice improvements in low-income communities; \n(iii)  improve the operation and management of the water and wastewater systems \nthrough mechanisms such as more efficient revenue collection, implementation \nof computerized billing and accounting, management information systems, \nimproved customer service, occupational safety and maintenance practices, \nreduced leakage, etc.; \n(iv)  assist and advise the WUO board of directors in relation to strategic planning, \nbudget preparation, and tariff setting; \n(v)  improve the effectiveness of WUO human resources through a coordinated \ncapacity building program; \n(vi)  manage, in collaboration with the WA and others, the implementation of an \ninvestment program to improve the water distribution network, including bulk \nwater metering, properly sequenced network rehabilitation and renewal of \nconnections; \n(vii)  coordinate the distribution network improvement investment program associated \nwith the construction of the Melamchi diversion scheme and water treatment \nplant undertaken by others; \n(viii)  implement a \u201cdemonstration scheme\u201d in a specified area including significant \nservice improvements early in the contract to demonstrate the benefits of \nimproved levels of service to customers; and \n(ix)  resolve customer complaints and measure customer satisfaction. \n \n2.  Contract Implementation Period \n \n8.  The management contract will be for an initial period of 4 years, which will be extended, \nupon satisfactory performance, by an additional period of about 2 years. The end of the \nextension period will approximate to 1 year after the commissioning of the Melamchi Water \nSupply Project. \n \n9.  It is anticipated that the WA, WUO, and National Water Supply Regulatory Board will \nbecome effective and commence operations on 1 November 2004, that the management \ncontract will be signed in early December 2004, and that the MC will mobilize during the first \nweek of January 2005.

Introduction and Approach \n1.  A project performance management system (PPMS) is a set of activities used to identify, \nrecord, and analyze (monitor and evaluate) information to ensure that a planned intervention will \nhave  the  desired  result  and  a  beneficial  impact.  It  seeks  to  establish  a  cause-and-effect \nrelationship between a project and the impact. \n2.  In accordance with the PPMS guidelines of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and with \nthe program objectives, the PPMS will assist the Program to bring about improvements in water \nsupply and wastewater services, which are expected to benefit people's well-being, health, and \ntheir environmental hygiene. Indicators pertaining to physical and socioeconomic development \nare identified in PPMS formats to facilitate monitoring and evaluation of benefits that will accrue \nfrom  the  program  components  to  the  beneficiaries.  Periodic  monitoring/performance \nbenchmarking of the water supply and wastewater service delivery under the new institutional \nframework as well as evaluation of the effectiveness of the new institutional framework itself will \nbe carried out by qualified civil society groups/nongovernment organizations (NGOs). The \nfindings of the periodic monitoring/performance benchmarking and the institutional effectiveness \nevaluation will feed into the PPMS. \n3.  Under this Program, the PPMS is further expanded as the technical audit to identify the \nachievements  on  the  key  performance  indicators  for  the  performance-based management \ncontract. \nB.  Project Performance Management System Framework \n4.  It  is  proposed  that  the  PPMS  will  cover  three  aspects  of  program  implementation, \nnamely: \n(i)  institutional strengthening of each of the three key entities, namely the Water \nAuthority (WA), the Water Utility Operator (WUO), and the National Water Supply \nRegulatory  Board  (NWSRB),  as  measured  by  the  increased  capacity  and \nefficiency to carry out its respective mandate; \n(ii)  implementation of the performance-based management contract/performance of \nthe  management  contractor  (MC)  including  (a) plan,  design,  tender,  and \nconstruction, (b) service delivery in terms of quantity and quality, and (c) number \nof beneficiaries; and \n(iii)  impact evaluation identifying changes in the areas of economic growth, public \nhealth,  poverty  reduction,  gender  discrimination  reduction,  and  community \nparticipation. \n5.  It  is  proposed  that  a  baseline  survey  be  carried  out  during  the  first  year  of  the \nperformance-based management contract in close cooperation with the MC to collect initial data \non physical, financial, and institutional strengthening, and impact indicators as outlined in the \nnext section. It is suggested that a midterm PPMS survey be performed to enable data to be \navailable at the time of the ADB midterm review, and a final PPMS survey be conducted at the \nend  of  the  Program  to  determine  the  overall  impact.  The  terms  of  reference  for  the \nPPMS/technical  audit  would  be  developed  by  the  advisor  (consultant)  for  the  WA  in \ncollaboration with the WA and the WUO. The next section elaborates potential preliminary \n ", "48  Appendix 12 \nperformance indicators, which could be included and refined in the terms of reference for the \nPPMS/technical audit. \nC.  Performance Indicators \n1.  Institutional Strengthening Indicators \na.  Revenue Generation and Financial Management \n6.  Performance indicators for institutional strengthening with respect to revenue generation \nand financial management of the WUO (and the NWSRB for item (vii)) will include the following: \n(i)  Ratio of total annual revenue to total annual expenditure; \n(ii)  Percentage change in generated revenue; \n(iii)  Percentage change in the volume of water billed; \n(iv)  Percentage change in the number of customers; \n(v)  Percentage change in nondomestic customers i.e., identify those who revert to \nusing the supply system rather than their private sources; \n(vi)  Change in tariff collection efficiency (total collected over total billed); and \n(vii)  Timely and appropriate-level tariff adjustments (the NWSRB) \nb.  Operation and Maintenance \n7.  Performance  indicators  for  institutional  strengthening  with  respect  to  operation  and \nmaintenance of the WUO will include the following: \n(i)  Budgeted and realized expenditure for improvements of the distribution network \nand all associated mechanical and electrical equipment; \n(ii)  Budgeted and realized expenditure on water treatment and disinfection; \n(iii)  Hours spent on staff training; \n(iv)  Nonrevenue water as a percentage of water produced; and \n(v)  Hours before responding to customer repair request/customer complaint. \n2.  Subproject Implementation Indicators \na.  Water Supply \n8.  Performance  indicators  for  subproject  implementation  with  respect  to  water  supply \noperations of the WUO will include the following: \n(i)  Increase  in  volume  of  water  delivered  in  new  systems or additional water \ndelivered in rehabilitated systems; \n(ii)  Planned vs. actual duration for detailed design, tender and construction; \n(iii)  Planned vs. actual subproject cost; \n(iv)  Delivery and use of water broken down by type of connection (house connection, \nstandpipe,  commercial,  industrial,  institutional,  other),  estimated  number  of \nbeneficiaries, volume of consumption, and hours of service; \n ", "  Appendix 12  49 \n(v)  Percentage reduction in customer complaints; and \n(vi)  Rates, collectibles, and accounts receivable. \nb.  Sewerage and Sewage Treatment \n9.  Performance indicators for subproject implementation with respect to sewerage and \nsewage treatment operations of the WUO will include the following: \n(i)  Type and size of facilities constructed; \n(ii)  Planned vs. actual duration for detailed design, tender  and construction, and \nprocurement of equipment; \n(iii)  Planned vs. actual subproject cost; \n(iv)  Volume of sewage treated as percentage of volume generated; and \n(v)  Beneficiary satisfaction surveys. \n3.  Impact Evaluation Indicators \na.  Economic Growth \n10.  Impact evaluation indicators for the overall institutional framework on the economic \ngrowth will include the following percentage increase in land values. \nb.  Public Health \n11.  Impact evaluation indicators for the overall institutional framework on the public health \nwill include the following: \n(i)  Percentage change in incidence of diarrhea and other water-borne diseases; \n(ii)  Percentage change in biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5) and e-coli count in a \nrepresentative sample of well water and/or pipe-borne water; \n(iii)  Percentage change in incidence of vector borne diseases from insects; and \n(iv)  Improved river quality at sampling points to be established early in the project by \nmeans of percentage changes in biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5) and \ne-coli count and dissolved air concentration. The Bagmati River will be given \nparticular attention. \n \n ", "50  Appendix 13 \nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \nA.  Objectives of the Program \n1.  The Program aims to establish an appropriate institutional framework and operational \nenvironment  that  will  facilitate  the  provision  of  efficient  and  affordable  water  supply  and \nwastewater services in Kathmandu Valley. This appendix outlines the economic rationale for the \nProgram, the main expected costs and benefits, and the distribution of such benefits. However, \nit should be noted that the Program is primarily one of institutional reforms with some intangible \nor difficult-to-quantify benefits (and costs), and that additional information is still to be collected \nfor finalizing the design of such reforms by the consultants for Technical Assistance (TA) 4096-\nNEP. \nB.  Identification of Problems \n2.  At present, water supply and wastewater services in the urban areas of Kathmandu \nValley are deficient, which creates a high degree of water stress in the valley, with the following \ncharacteristics: \n(i)  Approximately 30% of the urban population in the valley do not currently have an \nin-house connection, and it is estimated that around 60% of the unconnected are \npoor. According to recent estimates, approximately 10% of the total number of \nhouseholds were made up of unconnected poor although this is likely to be an \nunderestimate  as  this  evaluation  only  included  formal  housing  and  did  not \nenumerate slums, squatters, or informal renters. These groups constitute the \nbulk of poor people in the valley and are not currently receiving appropriate \nservices.  The  unconnected  poor  have  to  rely  on  traditional  stone-spouts, \nstandpipes,  shallow  wells,  tanker  supplies,  or  informal  connections.  Such \nsupplies  are  grossly  inadequate:  total  amounts  provided  are  insufficient for \nappropriate levels of hygiene, and a considerable time is spent on collecting \nwater (especially by women), either for extracting water through hand-pumps or \nqueuing at stand post delivery points; \n(ii)  For those with connections, water services are provided for approximately 2 \nhours  every  alternate  day.  The  pressure  is  very  low  and,  although  illegal, \npumping is typically required for extracting water out of the piped network. This \nsituation is worse during the dry season, when the gap between available supply \nand  demand  widens.  The  utility  operates  a  strict  rationing  program,  with \napproximately 60 dedicated staff (for operating valves and distributing scarce \nwater) employed in the valley. Although hours of supply are fairly regular, water \nis often distributed at odd hours (especially in the middle of the night), which \ncauses great inconvenience for customers. Households have had to invest in \nstorage  (both  ground-level water reservoirs and roof-top storage tanks) and \npumping facilities, in order to cope with intermittent supply at low pressures. Poor \nhouseholds cannot afford such expense and their storage capacities are often \nvery limited; \n(iii)  Due to the intermittency of water supply and network leakage, water quality is \npoor. There are no systems in place for monitoring water quality on a regular \nbasis. No drinking water standards have been adopted and no government \nagency has been made responsible for monitoring drinking water standards. \nTherefore,  the  Nepal  Water  Supply  Corporation  (NWSC)  is  practically  self-\nregulating  in  that  respect.  Health  problems  linked  to  such  poor  quality  are \n ", "  Appendix 13  51 \nfrequent, taking a heavy toll on labor productivity. Households cope with such \npoor quality through filtering and boiling water, but most poorer households find it \ndifficult to adopt such coping strategies; and \n(iv)  Many  households  have  dug  their  own  shallow  wells  or  rely  on  community-\nmanaged shallow wells. In addition, privately operated water tanker companies \nhave dug wells and sell water to the more affluent households in the city. There \nare no controls over such groundwater abstractions and no detailed analysis of \nthe impact of such abstractions on the aquifer. As the urban areas expand, such \nabstraction  levels  are  likely  to  be  unsustainable.  Several  wells  (particularly \nshallow wells used for household supplies) have already dried up. \n3.  Over the last two decades, various multilateral and bilateral agencies have attempted to \nstrengthen the performance of NWSC and its predecessors through a sequence of projects that \nhave combined technical assistance, institutional support, and funds for investments. Various \nstudies have examined and reported how far these efforts have improved the performance of \nNWSC,  starting  with  the  Pokharel  Commission  Report  in  1987  and  culminating  with  the \nimplementation completion report for the World Bank\u2019s Urban Water Supply and Sanitation \nRehabilitation Project produced in 2000.2 These studies have identified a variety of factors that \nexplain the difficulty in improving the performance of NWSC, and they have emphasized the \nproblems caused by frequent and inconsistent political interference in the management of the \nutility. For example, the World Bank report points out that NWSC had seven general managers \nor executive chairpersons during the period of the Rehabilitation Project\u2019s implementation from \nOctober 1992 to March 1999. There were also seven different chairpersons of the board of \nNWSC during this period. Such frequent changes in key personnel have undermined the \ncapacity of NWSC to develop and implement programs designed to improve its efficiency and \nquality of service. \n4.  NWSC computerized its billing records in one of nine branches in Kathmandu Valley in \n2002 and expects to computerize two more branches in 2003\u20132004. However, the majority of \nbilling and all accounting of expenditures still rely on manual ledgers. As a consequence, the \ncompany seems to be unable to produce proper management accounts for the whole company \nor each region. \n5.  NWSC has been criticized as operating too much as a project execution/procurement \nagency and clearly has not been able to develop the skills and corporate culture required for \nutility management. Even then, the eventual disbursement of the World Bank Rehabilitation \nProject amounted to less than one third of the original project amount and only 60% of the \nrevised (reduced) project amount after the midterm review. \n6.  While many of NWSC\u2019s problems are linked to poor management and incentives, there \nhave been equally important external factors that have affected its performance. The critical one \nhas been the reluctance of the Government to adopt and implement a consistent tariff policy. \nNWSC has stumbled from one financial crisis to another with tariff increases that are too small \nand too late. As a result, NWSC has had problems in finding the financial resources to provide \ncounterpart funding for projects or to manage a proper program of network maintenance, \nreplacement, and extension. A large proportion of investments in increasing the coverage of \nwater distribution and sewage collection in Kathmandu Valley over the last 10 years was funded \n                                                 \n2  See S. Shreshtra. 2001. Water Supply and Sewerage Service Situation in Kathmandu: A Review of Two Reports. \nWater Nepal, Vol. 8, No. 12, pp. 105\u2013120. \n ", "52  Appendix 13 \nby customers or municipalities. As a consequence, NWSC has been unable to maintain the \ntechnical integrity of its networks. \n7.  Funding agencies have worsened the tariff problem by failing to pursue consistent \npolicies on the conditions of their assistance. Tariff increases were required as conditions of \nappraisal and effectiveness for the World Bank Rehabilitation Project, but these conditions were \neither waived or delayed, and NWSC failed to comply with several loan covenants concerning \nits financial performance. Since the end of the World Bank project, there was one significant \ntariff increase in February 2002 but the financial condition of NWSC is dire and the company is \nbarely able to cover its operating costs. These financial problems are exacerbated by the lack of \nmanagement accounting information and dubious accounting practices. \n8.  In summary, NWSC is seen in many quarters as an underperforming utility. It is unable \nto provide even the most basic of services to many of its customers in Kathmandu Valley, who \nare understandably reluctant to pay more for what they do not receive. Remedying this situation \nwill require an extended period of effort to improve operational performance and the quality of \nservice. At the same time, a significant increase in tariffs is unavoidable simply in order to cover \nthe immediate costs of operating and improving services. \n9.  Finally, with high levels of leakage in the network, it would be extremely inefficient (and \ncostly)  to  introduce  the  Melamchi  Water  Supply  Project  (MWSP)  without  appropriate \nimprovements  to  the  system  as  the  additional  water  would  simply  be  lost  physically  or \nfinancially. Reforms are therefore needed to improve the quality of the network prior  to the \nintroduction of the MWSP and to alleviate the problems related to water scarcity during the \ninterim period, i.e., up to the commissioning of the MWSP. \nC.  Identification of Best Option \n10.  The recent history of development assistance to the water services sector in Nepal has \nshown that it was inefficient to invest funds in the systems, and particularly in distribution \nnetwork  improvement  or  the  improvement  of  commercial  activities,  without  accompanying \ninstitutional reforms that would increase the company\u2019s autonomy, establish a proper incentive \nframework, and reduce undue political interference. Attempts at reforming the NWSC Act in \norder to improve the autonomy of NWSC\u2019s board have repeatedly failed. Despite existing \nprovisions allowing NWSC to increase tariffs, they have not been increased even to keep up \nwith inflation due to the lack of a willingness to charge. As a result, NWSC went into a vicious \nspiral. The Government, therefore, decided to introduce the private sector participation (PSP) \nmodality and associated sector reforms in order to make a clear departure from this spiral by \nestablishing  a  proper  incentive  framework,  limiting  political  interference,  and  introducing \nrequired professional skills for improved management. \n11.  Various options for PSP in the provision of water services in the metropolitan/urban \nareas of Kathmandu Valley were examined first by the World Bank and then by ADB over the \nperiod from 1998 to 2002: \n(i)  Full privatization or a concession contract for 20-plus years would be extremely \nrisky for any potential investor/operator. Therefore, it would be necessary to \nprovide very large incentives to induce firms to bid. Further, there is large public \nresistance to the notion of privatizing basic social services such as water supply \nand wastewater management; \n ", "  Appendix 13  53 \n(ii)  The  World  Bank  attempted  to  implement  a  type  of  affermage  or  lease \narrangement\u2014called a management-lease contract\u2014under which the network \nassets were to be managed by a private operator. The operator would have been \nrequired to make limited investments in improving the network but it would not \nhave borne the full revenue and investment risks associated with a concession \ncontract. Two separate efforts to implement this arrangement had to be cancelled \nbecause too few firms with appropriate experience were willing to prequalify. The \nlesson  learned  from  these  unsuccessful  efforts  was  that  potential  bidders \nregarded  the  risks  of  operating  water  supply  and  wastewater  services  in \nKathmandu Valley as too high with respect to the investment funds required; and \n(iii)  Since it has been proven that there is a clear reluctance among potential private \nparties to invest in the Kathmandu Valley system, it seems that some form of \nperformance-based management contract is the only realistic form of PSP that \ncan be adopted in the current circumstances. This conclusion is consistent with \nexperience in other cities around the world where the existing system suffers \nfrom serious problems of management and operation. Such a management \ncontract involves the recruitment of an experienced operator, hereafter termed a \nmanagement contractor (MC), to provide a management team backed up by \ncorporate  technical  support  to  improve  the  utility\u2019s  performance.  The \nremuneration of the MC would be based on a combination of a fixed base fee \nand additional rewards/bonuses linked to specific key performance indicators. \nThere is some experience with management contracts in Nepal, but these have \nbeen on a fixed-fee basis and they have been designed for relatively short \ninterventions. It is desirable to incorporate stronger performance rewards in a \nlonger contract to ensure that the incentives for the utility and the MC are \nproperly aligned. \n12.  As a result of the discouraging past experiences in shoring up the existing public utility \n(i.e., NWSC), and this assessment of the potential options for PSP, ADB concluded that a \nperformance-based  management  contract  would  be  the  most  appropriate  option  for  the \nmetropolitan/urban areas of Kathmandu Valley. Since one of the goals of introducing an MC is \nto ensure that the distribution network in Kathmandu Valley is improved so that the additional \nwater produced by the Manohara Project and the MWSP can be properly used, it is important \nthat the provisions of the management contract should be consistent with the timetable and \ngoals of these projects. \n13.  Following  a  period  of  in-depth  consideration  and  consultation,  and  with  previous \nexperiences very much in mind, the proposal for PSP modality by using a management contract \nhas  been  developed  further.  This  essentially  involves  the  appointment  of  an  MC  for  the \noperation  and  management  of  the  water  supply  and  wastewater  services  in  the \nmetropolitan/urban areas of Kathmandu Valley for a predefined period of time (an initial period \nof 4 years, which will be extended, upon satisfactory performance of the MC, by an additional \nperiod of about 2 years). An experienced international operator (consultant) will be recruited via \ninternational competitive recruitment and will be retained on the basis of a performance-based \nmanagement contract. Under this scheme, the level of risk, both for the Government and the \nselected MC, will be significantly lower than under the previously considered World Bank-\nfinanced PSP scheme. \n ", "54  Appendix 13 \nD.  Program\u2019s Likely Benefits \n14.  The Program is likely to have the following benefits: \n(i)  Increased  consumer  surplus,  derived  from  improved  water  supply  and \nwastewater services, and health benefits from improved environmental sanitation \nand personal hygiene. It is rather difficult to separate the benefits of the MWSP \nfrom those of this Program. Basically, the MWSP is dependent on this Program \nwhile  this  Program  can  be  freestanding.  In  other  words,  this  Program  is \nnecessary for the MWSP while the MWSP will boost the benefits of this Program. \nEarlier studies have provided indications of a high willingness to pay (WTP) for \nimproved  water  supply  services.  Almost  70%  of  the  households  presently \nconnected are willing to pay a monthly bill of NRs600 for improved water supply \nservices while almost 50% of the households presently not connected are willing \nto pay NRs500 per month for similar services according to a WTP survey carried \nout in 2001. These figures may be compared to a typical monthly charge for an \nunmetered NWSC connection of NRs70 at the time the survey was carried out. \nFor the households connected to the NWSC system, the median WTP is NRs900 \nper month for improved water supply services, i.e., at least 50% of the sample \nare willing to pay more than NRs900 from their monthly income to obtain the \nimproved services. The mean WTP is NRs1,030 per month among connected \nhouseholds. For poor households currently connected to the NWSC system, the \nmean WTP is NRs800.3 The MC will have obligations to improve availability and \nefficiency of water supply services, provide the services in a more equitable \nmanner,  and  improve  other  relevant  aspects  of  the  services.  All  the  above \nbenefits are under the assumption that both the MWSP and the Program have \nbeen successfully completed. Without the MWSP, however, some of the above \nbenefits  are  still  expected  to  materialize  in  conjunction  with  the  proposed \ndemonstration  scheme  by  using  JICA's  Manohara  bulk  water.  Benefits  of \nproviding improved services could be valued by using the median WTP multiplied \nby  the  total  number  of  households,  in  order  to  represent the amount that \nhouseholds are willing to pay for the improvement to the services; \n(ii)  Improved management efficiency. Existing staff morale is low. The MC could \ntransform the culture of the utility by offering commensurate rewards reflecting \nperformance and quality of services. The long-term impact of a better managed \nand more financially sustainable utility would be substantial, as opposed to the \ncurrent situation where the utility is a drain on public sector resources, since \ncurrent  tariffs  are  insufficient  to  cover  even  its  operating  costs,  let  alone \ninvestment costs; and \n(iii)  Improvements in the institutional structure, with the establishment of a clearer \nframework  for  setting  tariffs  (based  on  principles  established  in  the  legal \nframework) and an independent regulatory body in charge of tariff setting. In turn, \nthose  institutional  improvements  could  have  a  ripple  effect  on  institutional \nmanagement  (and  a  positive  impact  on  sustainable  urban  development)  in \nKathmandu  Valley  and  in  the  country  as  a  whole.  (There  are  few  shining \nexamples of successful private sector participation in Nepal and a success story \nin the water services sector could pave the way for other reforms aiming at \nintroducing private sector participation for efficiency improvements.) \n                                                 \n3  The 95% confidence interval is NRs970\u20131,110 for households with a connection. For poor households with a \nconnection, the 95% confidence interval is NRs680\u2013910. \n ", "  Appendix 13  55 \nE.  Program\u2019s Likely Costs \n15.  The Program will require the following costs: \n(i)  Costs of the MC: the fixed base fee is to be paid for out of the project loan while \nthe performance-based bonus is to be paid for out of the WUO's own (improved) \nrevenues, primarily through water tariffs. While the first component is a net cost, \ncomparable to the costs of a TA project, the second component is to be financed \nthrough the efficiency improvements and corresponding revenue increments that \nthe management contractor would bring about; \n(ii)  Costs of the voluntary retirement scheme (VRS): a more realistic number of staff \nto be made redundant is to be estimated by the TA consultant team, but it is \ncurrently  estimated  that  approximately  800  staff  would  be  permanently \ntransferred to the WUO ultimately, out of a total of approximately 1,200 NWSC \nstaff currently working for its Kathmandu Valley operations. A total of 38 people \nhave so far taken part in the existing VRS scheme, at an average cost of \napproximately  NRs1 million  per  person  (approximately  $13,000).  In  addition, \napproximately 100 people are currently on a waiting list and many more have \napplied. The VRS scheme, therefore, appears to be attractive for certain workers, \nalthough such preference is not currently voiced by trade unions at a collective \nlevel. Accompanying activities would focus on assistance, for example, in the \nidentification of alternative employment for employees that have been made \nredundant and the retraining of employees, in particular the most vulnerable \nones. Therefore, there could be some benefits to be extracted from encouraging \nformer NWSC staff to take up other potentially productive activities. Expected \ngrowth in the total number of customers and the total value of services provided \nmay mean that the total number of staff will not be much smaller in 5 or 10 years \nthan at present, but the composition and skills of the work force will be quite \ndifferent; \n(iii)  Costs of the distribution network improvement program: in order to be able to \nbring about expected benefits, the MC would need to have access to public \nfinancing for carrying out a physical distribution network improvement program. \nThe exact costs of such a program are yet to be estimated, and would be \nfinanced separately; and \n(iv)  Other transition costs: the proposed institutional reforms are likely to require \nother transition costs linked to the restructuring of NWSC into three entities\u2014the \nWA,  the  WUO,  and  the  NWSRB.  The  remaining  NWSC,  which  will  be \nresponsible for areas outside Kathmandu Valley, could be further broken up into \nmunicipal or regional utilities (depending on an evaluation of the appropriate \nscale of service provision) in order to be more responsive to local needs outside \nKathmandu Valley, which have so far tended to be neglected due to a high level \nof focus on Kathmandu Valley requirements. \nF.  Distribution of Benefits \n16.  The increase in the average per capita volume of water supplied, resulting from the more \nefficient  operation  and  management  of  the  water  supply  and  wastewater  services,  the \noptimization of the water production facilities, the reduction in unaccounted-for water, and the \nmore equitable distribution of water throughout the metropolitan/urban area of Kathmandu \nValley will benefit the majority of the inhabitants of the area. However, it should be noted that \n ", "56  Appendix 13 \nthose people living adjacent to the existing water production facilities and transmission pipelines \nin the northern part of Kathmandu Valley are likely to undergo a reduction in water supply \nvolumes in the early  part of the program implementation period as better measures for the \ndistribution of water are implemented. This reduction will, however, be temporary and measures \nwill be taken to ensure that any reduction in supply volumes is not unreasonable. \n17.  Considerable attention will be paid in the design of the performance-based management \ncontract in order to ensure that the poor benefit from improved water supply services. Tariff \nincreases are not expected to affect the poor negatively, since they are the ones  who are \nusually  paying  the  highest  (real  or  opportunity)  volumetric  costs  for  water  at  present,  by \nobtaining water from alternative sources because they are unconnected or by coping with the \nintermittency or unreliability of water supplies (i.e., high coping costs). \n18.  Other than the operation and management of the services, a very clear objective of the \nPSP modality, and the appointment of the MC, is to achieve extensive technology transfer and \nto develop the long-term capability of Nepalese managers and  engineers to run the water \nsupply  and  wastewater  services,  either  under  public  or  local  private  management.  It  is \nanticipated that the entire workforce of the WUO and the overall Nepalese water supply industry \nwill benefit from such technology transfer. \n19.  The actual restructuring of NWSC will have a negative impact on some of the existing \nsenior  managers  whose  responsibilities,  and  therefore  importance,  within  the  government \nstructure will be adversely affected. Discussions will be held prior to the handover period in \norder  to  identify  ways  in  which  the  impact  of  imbalanced  senior  managers'  posts  and \nresponsibilities can be mitigated. \n20.  Rightsizing  the  WUO  via  the  NWSC's  VRS  scheme  will  have  both  beneficial  and \nnegative impacts on the current working-level NWSC staff. Many staff will see it as a benefit, as \nit gives them an opportunity to obtain a sum of money that will allow them to retire or start up \ntheir own business. A number of NWSC staff have already applied for voluntary redundancy\u2014\nsee para. 15 (ii). Where negative impacts are expected, the TA consultant team will develop a \nnonmonetary benefit program, such as identification of alternative employment and retraining in \norder to limit the impact on the most vulnerable employees. \n21.  Other adversely affected people may include water tanker owners/operators and drivers, \ntogether with street water vendors, whose business may be reduced with time. \n \n ", "  Appendix 14  57 \nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS  \nA.  General \n1.  Financial  analysis  and  calculation  of  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR) \nconducted under the project preparatory technical assistance were reviewed and revised in \naccordance  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Framework  for  the  Economic  and \nFinancial  Appraisal  of  Urban  Development  Sector  Projects.  For  revenue-generating \ncomponents, the FIRR was calculated for the Water Utility Operator (WUO) following ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for the Financial Analysis of Projects. The financial sustainability of the WUO was \nassessed  based  on  the  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Governance  and  Management  of \nInvestment Projects Financed by the Asian Development Bank. \nB.  Assumptions Used in Financial Projections \n1.  General Assumptions \n2.  The financial projection for the WUO consists of projected receipts and expenditures in \nNepalese rupees (NRs) and expressed in current prices incorporating projected general inflation \nover the forecast period FY2004\u20132020. WUO is assumed to take over Kathmandu Valley \noperations of the Nepal Water Supply Corporation (NWSC), whose operations will be managed \nand improved by the management contractor (MC). The financial projection assumes 60% of \noperations of NWSC, as considered within the Kathmandu Valley coverage, for allocation of \nfixed assets leased and the debt servicing. While all of the loans are not transferred from the \nNWSC, the WUO is assumed to remit funds to cover only the current debts (i.e., principal and \ninterest) servicing on all the wastewater loans and three fifths of the water supply loans. \n2.  Past Performance of Nepal Water Supply Corporation Operations \n3.  NWSC operations within Kathmandu Valley during the period FY2000\u20132002 showed a \ndecline in collection efficiency with average collection period ranging from 385 days in 2000, to \n466 days in 2001, and to 501 days in 2002. Nonrevenue water remained approximately at 37% \nin 2000 and 2001 respectively, and at 38% in 2002. The utility was overstaffed with a ratio of \n11.4 staff per 1,000 connections in 2002. NWSC was behind in debt servicing the loans of \nNRs1.2 billion, with accumulated arrears in principal amortization of NRs381 million and interest \npayments of NRs151 million. \n3.  Revenues \n4.  The average water tariff for all the categories of consumers is calculated and applied to \nthe demand forecast. It is assumed that the existing standpipes will be metered and charged at \nthe lifeline rate. For the sewerage revenues, it is assumed that 50% of the water bill of \nconsumers connected to the sewerage network is collected as sewerage revenues. Since not all \nin-valley water customers have sewerage connections, the sewerage revenues are assumed to \nremain at the current level of 26% of the total water revenues before the Melamchi Water \nSupply Project (MWSP) is completed. The existing sewerage connections are assumed to \nremain the same after the completion of the MWSP. Other operating revenues are assumed to \nbe  at  the  same  level  as  in  the  past,  currently  estimated  at  12%  of  the  water  revenue. \nNonoperating revenues, such as the interest earned on time-deposit investments in excess of \nthe WUO\u2019s monthly cash requirements, is assumed at 5% a year. \n \n ", "58  Appendix 14 \n4.  Expenditures \n5.  The total number of local personnel of the WUO is assumed to decline from 9.5 staff per \n1,000 connections in 2002 to 6.0 at the end of the first 4 years of the management contract. \nPower expenditure is assumed to remain the same until MWSP completion, as electricity is \nassumed to be the same unit cost per cubic meter of water produced in 2002, increasing over \nthe years due to inflation. This expenditure, however, is assumed to decline by 50% annually \nupon completion of the MWSP as the additional water will be gravity fed, and it will involve \nclosing  down  inefficient  pumping-dependent  groundwater  sources.  Fuel  for  vehicles  and \ngenerators, and chemicals are assumed to have the same unit cost per cubic meter of water \nproduced as in 2002, but increasing with inflation. Repairs and maintenance of the assets is \nassumed  to  be  2%  a  year  up  to  2005  and  lower  thereafter  as  the  distribution  network \nimprovement proceeds. Provision for bad debts is assumed to decline from 4.5% in 2002 to \n2.5%  for  the  period  2003  to  2007,  and  further  decline  to  2%  thereafter.  General  and \nadministrative expenses are assumed to be the same as in the past at 21.6% of the WUO\u2019s \npersonnel expenses. Management fees are assumed to cover the fixed fee and performance \nincentives payable to the MC. Regulatory expenses are assumed to be NRs170 million per \nannum. And sewerage expenses are estimated to remain the same as the current level, i.e., at \n21% of sewerage revenues. \n5.  Cost Recovery Policy and Tariff \n6.  The basis for setting the tariff includes the need for cost recovery, primarily from \nKathmandu Valley water consumers; addressing demands by proper pricing; increasing access \nto water and affordability for the urban poor; and facilitating payment of water bills. The financial \nprojection  includes  revenue  generation  improvement  from,  in  particular,  the  water  tariff, \nnonrevenue water rate, collection period, and staff rightsizing. It is assumed that the water tariff \nis substantially increased by 2005, with subsequent increases of 15% annually from 2006 to \n2009, followed by 30% and 25% in 2010 and 2011, respectively. This would result in a \nsimplification of the tariff structure and increases reaching NRs30/m3 in 2011, and NRs31/m3 \nfrom 2012 with an annual increase at the same rate as inflation. It is assumed that the \nnonrevenue water rate will decline from 38% in 2003 to 26% in 2009. It is assumed that the \ncollection period will improve from 120 days in 2003 to 45 days by 2009, and that the debt \nservice coverage ratio is improved by 0.9 and 1.0 times in 2011 and 2012, respectively, and at \nleast by 1.2 times from 2013. With institutional reforms and the ability of the private operator to \ndeliver  24-hour-a-day  potable  water  to  its  customers  leading  to  an  increase  in  overall \noperational efficiency and improved revenue generation, the financial projection shows that the \nWUO is capable of paying the lease payments and will be significantly self-sustained. \nC.  Financial Internal Rate of Return \n7.  Basic assumptions used in computing the FIRRs include the following: (i) all revenues \nand costs are expressed in constant July 2003 prices on an incremental basis; (ii) project \ninvestment costs were derived from estimated costs, less price contingencies and interest \nduring construction; and (iii) capital expenditures are recorded at the time they are incurred, \nwhile interest and depreciation are excluded. The purpose of the financial cost-benefit analysis \nis to assess the financial viability of the Program. It focuses on the additional financial benefits \n(usually in terms of additional revenues, and capital and operating cost savings or reductions) \nattributable to the Program for the WUO, rather than the economy as a whole. The resulting \nFIRR indicates the profitability of the Program, and should exceed the weighted average cost of \ncapital (WACC) to be financially viable. The WACC of the water supply component is estimated \nto be 4.0%. The resulting FIRR of 0.28% is due to comparatively less revenue generated \n ", "  Appendix 14  59 \nthrough deferment of construction of one half of the water treatment plant in favor of the \ndistribution network improvement. \nD.  Beneficiary Affordability \n1.  Willingness to Pay \n8.  A study on the willingness to pay (WTP) for improved water supply in Kathmandu Valley4 \nwas undertaken in 2001 to measure how much households are willing to pay for a reliable \nsupply of water amounting to 500 liters per day per household. A contingent valuation5 study \nwas  conducted  covering  a  total  of  1,500  randomly  sampled  households  in  five  urban \nmunicipalities of Kathmandu Valley (i.e., Kathmandu, Lalitpur, Bhaktapur, Madhyapur Thimi, \nand Kirtipur) to collect information on demand for improved water services. The study found \nconsiderable demand for improved water services.  \n9.  Almost 70% of the households that are connected to the NWSC system are willing to \npay a monthly bill of NRs600, and almost 50% of the households that are not connected to the \nNWSC system are willing to pay a monthly bill of NRs500. These figures may be compared with \na standard monthly charge for an unmetered NWSC connection of NRs70 at the time the survey \nwas carried out. For the households that are connected to the NWSC system, the median WTP \nis NRs900 per month for improved services, i.e., at least 50% of the sample is willing to pay \nmore than NRs900 from their monthly income to obtain the improved services. The average \nWTP is NRs1,030 per month among connected households. For poor households currently \nconnected to NWSC system, the mean WTP is NRs800.6 \n10.  Among unconnected households, the mean WTP for improved service from a private \nconnection, is NRs840 per month. The mean WTP for an improved water supply from a shared \nconnection, which is similar in all respects except that it will provide about 250 liters of water a \nday,  is  NRs230  per  month.7 The  mean  monthly  WTP  of  poor  households  currently  not \nconnected to the NWSC system is NRs630 for a private connection and NRs240 for a shared \nconnection. \n2.  Affordability Analysis \n11.  Applying the proposed water charges and wastewater surcharges with the expected \nwater consumption, the percentage of average monthly expenditure on water and sewerage \nwas assessed with reference to household incomes. Based on the 2001 census, median \nhousehold income in Kathmandu Valley is estimated at NRs14,000 per month, and the lowest \nquartile  median  is  estimated  at  NRs6,070  per  month.  Upon  completion  of  the  MWSP,  an \naverage monthly water bill of NRs540 can be expected for a household of six persons based on \nan assumed consumption level of 100 liters per capita per day (lpcd). This would equate to \n3.9% of the household\u2019s income, i.e., within the generally accepted expenditure level of 3\u20134% of \nthe median monthly household income.  \n                                                 \n4  Willingness to Pay for Improved Water Supply in Kathmandu Valley.

For poor households with a \nconnection, the 95% confidence interval is NRs680\u2013910. \n7  For the group of unconnected households, the 95% confidence interval is NRs700\u20131,010 for a private connection \nand NRs30\u2013380 for a shared connection. \n ", "60  Appendix 15 \nENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT OF KATHMANDU VALLEY WATER SERVICES SECTOR \nDEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \n1.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector identified as a national  Yes  Sector identified as a national  Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?  priority in country poverty  \n  partnership agreement? \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Nepal: \nThe Kathmandu Valley Water Services Sector Development Program (KVWSSDP or the Program) will provide a \nsolution to mitigate the socioeconomic stress caused by the inadequate supply of safe drinking water for Kathmandu \nValley residents. The Program will improve the water supply and wastewater services in the metropolitan/urban areas \nof Kathmandu Valley by supporting institutional reforms and by engaging a management contractor (MC) under a \nperformance-based management contract to operate and manage the urban water supply and wastewater systems in \nconjunction with the ongoing Melamchi Water Supply Project (MWSP). This will benefit 180,000 households in the \nvalley in terms of quantity, quality, and timeliness as well as more equitable distribution of water supply. The impact \nratio for the poor has been estimated to be four times that for the not-so-poor. The Project will also provide \nsocioeconomic benefits of reduced workload for women and children. These benefits have not been quantified and, \nto that extent, the economic benefits are understated. \nB.  Poverty Analysis    Proposed Classification: Other/Good governance \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nPoverty in Nepal \nThe recent estimate indicates that 42% of Nepal\u2019s total population are living below the official poverty line, and \npoverty reduction is the primary objective of the Government\u2019s development policy, as indicated in the Government's \n10th Development Plan (2002\u20132007). \n \nPoverty in the Kathmandu Valley \n(i) Although no official estimates of the extent of poverty in Kathmandu Valley are available, data derived from the \nNepal Living Standards Survey of 1995/96 indicate that, based on a poverty threshold of NRs9,000 per capita per \nannum, equivalent to about $122, the extent of the urban poor ranges from 10% to 13%. However, given that rents \nand other costs are higher in Kathmandu than in other urban areas of the country, 12\u201315% would be a conservative \nestimate of urban poverty in Kathmandu Valley. Nevertheless, income poverty alone is insufficient to understand the \nextent of poverty in the valley. \n \n(ii) Most of Kathmandu\u2019s poor live in very low-quality houses, squatter settlements, or rental accommodation. Rental \naccommodation is occupied by a range of low-income groups, such as daily wage earners, hawkers, and semiskilled \nlaborers. Squatters live mainly on marginal government-owned land. Their population has grown considerably and is \nnow estimated at 18,000. Overall, most poor live in small settlements in the midst of higher-income housing and, \nconsequently, are not very visible. \n \n(iii) Access to reliable water supplies is a problem for most low-income communities. Reliance on public supplies from \nthe Nepal Water Supply Corporation (NWSC) is minimal; most urban poor depend on private or traditional sources of \nsupply. Shallow wells are a popular source, but these are usually contaminated and responsible for a variety of water-\nborne diseases. About 67% of the population believes that the quality of water supplied by NWSC is poor; almost \n72% of households in Kathmandu Valley treat their water before consumption. Boiling and filtering, the most common \nmeans of treatment, involve considerable expense and impact mainly on the poor. Based on a 1999 survey \nundertaken during MWSP project preparation, 36% of the households suffer from water-related diseases. Diarrhea, \nstomach ailments, and dysentery are the dominant health problems and impact significantly on productivity and \nincome because of working days lost and treatment expenses. Diarrhea is a leading cause for child mortality \nthroughout Nepal. \n \n(iv) The hardships in accessing water in Kathmandu Valley are severe. With piped water supplies limited to 2 hours \nevery alternate day, most consumers, and particularly the poor, rely on secondary sources. Although the time spent \nby the poor in accessing water for domestic use varies, approximately 1 hour is required. A number of domestic \nfunctions are undertaken at the water point to minimize the volume of water to be carried home. Women are the \npredominant carriers of water. Residents of low-income areas carry home only about 10 liters per person of water \nevery day. This is insufficient to maintain basic hygiene and sanitation standards, and is a prime cause of the high \nlevels of morbidity and mortality. \n ", "  Appendix 16  63 \nC.  Participation Process \nStakeholder analysis: Yes \nThe umbrella project of KVWSSDP, MWSP, has been prepared with extensive participation of stakeholders, including \nbeneficiaries, adversely affected people, village development committees and ward representatives, district \ndevelopment committees and municipality officials and representatives, ministries concerned and the Melamchi \nWater Supply Development Board (MWSDB), the private sector, external funding agencies, nongovernment \norganizations, and consultants. MWSP will also undertake consensus building at all levels on issues such as water \nservices, environmental and social impact mitigation and compensation, and employment. Extensive consultations \nwith stakeholders will continue under KVWSSDP, in particular focusing on pro-poor service delivery strategy \ndevelopment. \n \nParticipation strategy required: Yes \nTo support the introduction of private sector participation (PSP) scheme for the water supply and wastewater services \nin Kathmandu Valley, the Kathmandu Valley Water Supply Management Support Committee (KVWSMSC) has been \nestablished under MWSDB. KVWSMSC will ensure that stakeholders are kept informed about KVWSSDP and are \ngiven an opportunity to express their views. It will carry out a proactive public relations campaign to identify any \npotential conflict area at an early stage, assist in consensus building between the Program and the local \ncommunities. \nD.  Gender and Development \nStrategy to Maximize Impacts on Women \nHardship in water management is more severe among the poorer households, and mostly among women, who bear \nthe predominant responsibility for water collection, storage, and treatment. Therefore, quite naturally, the Program will \nbenefit women significantly and disproportionally. \n \nGender Plan Prepared: Yes \nTo ensure that women's participation and gender concerns are fully addressed, a gender strategy has been \ndeveloped and is being implemented. Apart from this, it has been agreed that at least one of the members of the \nregulatory body will be female. \nE.

Therefore, the \nincreased water tariff will still be well within \nthe affordable level. \nOther Risks/  None    None \nVulnerabilities \n ", " \n6\n4\nTERMS OF REFERENCE FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CONSULTANTS (TA 4096-NEP)   \nA\nI.
