The  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  and  eight  other  joint  financing  partners  (JFPs)  will  finance  the  program  with  the \ngovernment during FY2017\u2013FY2021 through a sector-wide approach.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nStrategic Context \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nNepal at a crossroads.  Nepal has gone through major political upheavals associated \nwith  a  protracted  constitution-drafting  process  and  frequent  change  in  government.  Despite \nthese  challenges,  economic  growth  in  the  country  averaged  4.0%  annually  during  the  past \ndecade, and the proportion of people living below the poverty line declined from 31.0% in 2006 \nto 23.8% in 2015. Development of human capital is critical for Nepal\u2019s vision to emerge as an \ninclusive  and  prosperous  middle-income  country  by  2030.3  Continued  investment  in  school \neducation,  particularly  secondary  education,  will  help  the  country  graduate  from  its  least \ndeveloped  country  status  by  2022  and  achieve  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals.  Two \nimportant  recent  developments  are  opportune  to  strengthen  school  sector  reforms.  First,  the \nConstitution  of  Nepal  2015  envisages  education  as  a  fundamental  right  and  provides  for  free \nschool education (grades 1\u201312), thereby reinforcing the government\u2019s commitment. Second, the \nEighth Amendment to the Education Act (2016) paves the way for restructuring the fragmented \nschool sector into a holistic one and for implementing comprehensive reforms.4 \n \n4. \nSector performance. Steady progress has been made in increasing access and equity \nin  basic  education  (grades 1\u22128). The  net  enrollment rate  (NER) for  basic  education  increased \nfrom  73.0%  in  2008  to  89.4%  in  2015.5  Girls\u2019  participation  has  increased,  with  gender  parity \nachieved  in  enrollments  in  basic  education.  The  share  of  students  repeating  classes  has \ndeclined  and  the  continued  attendance  of  student  cohorts  from  grade  1  to  grade  8  has \nincreased. \n  \n5. \nDespite  good  progress,  challenges  remain.  Few  students  progress  to  secondary \neducation (grades 9\u201312). Although enrollment in basic education is high, the NER for grades 9\u2013\n10 is only 58.0% and falls sharply to 16.8% for grades 11\u201312. The share of Dalits (a historically \nexcluded  social  group)  in  total  enrollment  is  only  9%  at  the  secondary  level.  Girls  from  the \npoorest  quintiles  and  from  disadvantaged  backgrounds  do  not  benefit  adequately  from \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  eight  other  JFPs  are  Australia,  the  European  Union,  Finland,  the  Global  Partnership  for  Education,  Japan \n\nInternational Cooperation Agency, Norway, United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), and the World Bank. \n\n3  Government  of  Nepal,  National  Planning  Commission.  2015.  Sustainable  Development  Goals,  2016\u20132030: \n\nNational (Preliminary) Report. Kathmandu. \n\n4  Nepal\u2019s school sector is now divided into basic education (grades 1\u20138) and secondary education (grades 9\u201312). \n5   NER  denotes number  of  students  of official school  age  group  enrolled in  the  corresponding  level, divided  by  the \n\npopulation of the same age group. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fProgram Rationale \n\nsecondary education. The quality of student learning is inadequate. The National Assessment of \nStudent Achievement results reveal that average scores in grade 8 in 2013 were particularly low \nfor science (41%) and math (35%). There is a lack of subject teachers, particularly for science, \nmath,  and  English  and  inadequate  teacher  professional  development.  School  leadership  is \nineffective in leading school-based quality improvements.  Teaching and learning processes are \noutdated, relying heavily on teacher centered content delivery from textbooks. The percentage \nof  students  passing  the  grade  10  examination  in  2015  was  only  47.4%.  Assessments  and \nexaminations are largely focused on rote learning by students and do not adequately evaluate \ntheir ability to apply knowledge and skills.   \n \nB. \n \nOpportunities in school education. The SSDP is a new initiative of the government to \n6. \nimprove access, equity, and the quality of school education. The reforms proposed are geared \ntowards (i) the expansion of secondary education; (ii) improved teacher management to ensure \nadequate placement of trained subject teachers from grade 6 onward; (iii) a revamp in the way \nmath, science, and English are taught and learned; (iv) the augmented use of information and \ncommunication  technology  (ICT)-enriched  learning;  and  (v)  the  implementation  of  a  model \nschool  program.  Recognizing  that  disadvantages  can  be  multidimensional  with  economic, \nsocial,  and  geographic  aspects,  the  SSDP  will  implement  a  new  equity  strategy  to  reduce \ndisparities in access, participation, and learning outcomes.6 Institutional reforms are integral to \nSSDP.  A  National  Examinations  Board  will  be  established  to  improve  coherence  between \ncurriculum, textbooks, and assessments. The Education Review Office will be strengthened for \nregular  performance  audits  of  school  education.  The  SSDP  interventions  will  improve  the \nperformance of  public  schools  in relation to private  schools  and  upgrade  the  overall  quality  of \nhuman capital, and bring substantial individual and social returns. \n \n7. \nBuilding  on  its  extensive  experience  in  education,  ADB  will  support  the  government\u2019s \nSSDP  through  results-based  lending  (RBL).  Program-based  lending  was  the  appropriate \nmodality  to  support  the  School  Sector  Reform  Program  (SSRP)  which  preceded  SSDP.7  The \nRBL modality is most suited to support the SSDP because (i) the government has demonstrated \nstrong  leadership  and  commitment  to  implementing  reforms  in  critical  areas;  (ii)  the  program \nrequires greater emphasis on translating policies already in place to implementation; and (iii) the \nJFPs have agreed on a single results framework and a common disbursement-linked indicators \n(DLIs)  framework  with  the  government  which  increases  harmonization,  reduces  administrative \nburden  and  enables  effective  focus  on  results.  ADB  and  other  JFPs  have  coordinated  due \ndiligence assessments, harmonized key DLIs, and agreed on joint program reviews. A program \naction  plan  (PAP)  will  support  timely  DLI  achievement.  ADB\u2019s  due  diligence  assessments \nprovide reasonable assurance for effective achievement of results through RBL, with measures \nto strengthen program systems. \n \n8. \nThe  SSDP  builds  on  achievements  and  lessons  from  the  SSRP.  Midterm  and  final \nevaluations of the SSRP noted that while much progress had been made in access and equity \nin  basic  education,  quality  needed  a  stronger  focus.  The  SSDP  will  support  comprehensive \ninterventions to improve the quality of basic education and expand access to quality secondary \neducation. The SSDP will ensure that all newly built schools and classrooms meet disaster risk \n\n                                                \n6  Government of Nepal, Ministry of Education. 2014.

Kathmandu. http://www.doe.gov.np/assets/uploads/files/47441f6a3f1e62dedb7bb91655b8df92.pdf \n\n7   Program-based  lending  was  used  in  SSRP  to  facilitate  policy  development  which  was  crucial  to  create  enabling \nconditions for reforms. The SSRP was implemented during FY2010\u2013FY2016 and led to positive results in improved \nbasic education. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fresilience standards. The National Reconstruction Authority is implementing a large-scale post-\nearthquake  program  for  reconstruction  and  retrofitting  of  schools  in  31  districts,  including  an \nADB project.8 \n \nADB has been a leading development partner in education and the program will build on \n9. \nthis experience. ADB funding will provide much-needed financial leverage for more investments \nto  improve  access  to  and  quality  of  school  education,  with  particular  focus  on  secondary \neducation.  ADB  financing  will  add  value  through  key  initiatives,  such  as  the  model  school \nprogram,  examination  reform,  provision  of  subject  teachers,  and  improved  school  grant \nmanagement system. The program will catalyze capacity building and system strengthening in \nthe sector. ADB and other JFPs will adopt strong mitigation measures to address risks in public \nfinancial  management,  procurement,  social  and  environment  safeguards,  and  governance  in \nschool  education.  ADB  will  facilitate  innovative  knowledge  solutions  to  implement  key  SSDP \ncomponents  such  as  (i)  ICT-enriched  teaching  and  learning;  (ii)  teacher  professional \ndevelopment; (iii) activity-based pedagogy for math, science, and English; and (iv) model school \ndevelopment.    \n \nC. \n \n10. \nThe SSDP aims to improve the equity, quality, efficiency, governance, and management \nof  school  education.  The  program  will  reinforce  the  SSDP  objectives  by  prioritizing  and \nsequencing key outputs and targets in the first 5 years of the SSDP (Table 1). The sector-wide \napproach  in  the  SSDP  enables  the  program  to  leverage  the  entire  school  sector  budget  for \ngreater efficiency and effectiveness of public resources. \n \n\nProgram Scope \n\nItem \nOutcome \n\nKey outputs \n\nActivity types \n\nProgram \nexpenditure \n\nTable 1: Program Scope \n\n \n\nGovernment Program (SSDP) \n\nResults-Based Lending Program \n\nEquity, quality, efficiency, governance, and \nmanagement of the education sector improved \n\nEquitable access to quality secondary \neducation enhanceda \n\nComprehensive program outputs for early \nchildhood education development to grade 12 \neducation to increase access, equity, and \nquality; better qualified and trained teachers; \nnational curriculum revised; textbooks \nimproved; assessments and examinations \nimproved; and capacity for new federal \nstructure developed \n\nSchool infrastructure upgraded, teacher \ntraining revamped, curriculum renewed and \ntextbooks developed, pro-poor scholarships \nand free textbooks provided, EMIS improved, \nschool grant management system revised \n\nSame as in SSDP, but with particular focus \non secondary education through the \ndeployment of trained subject teachers, pro-\npoor scholarship scheme, improved \nexaminations, pilot testing of the model \nschool program, and improved school \ngovernance  \n\nSame as in SSDP, but focusing on \ninterventions for grades 6\u22128 of basic \neducation and grades 9\u201312 (secondary \neducation) \n\n$10.58 billion for FY2017\u2212FY2023 (estimate) \n\n$6.46 billion for FY2017\u2212FY2021 (estimate) \n\nMain financiers  Government of Nepal, ADB, Australia, EU, \n\nFAO, Finland, GPE, JICA, Norway, UNESCO, \nUNICEF, USAID, World Bank, and national \nand international NGOs \n\nGovernment of Nepal, ADB, Australia, EU, \nFinland, GPE, JICA, Norway, UNICEF and \nWorld Bank \n\n                                                \n8  ADB. 2015.

Manila. \n\nProgram Results \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nD. \n \n11. \nThe  program\u2019s  impact  will  be  a  more  qualified  human  resource  base  for  equitable \nsocioeconomic  development,  aligned  with  Nepal's  SSDP.  The  outcome  will  be  enhanced \nequitable  access  to  quality  secondary  education.  The  GER  for  secondary  education  will  be \nincreased  by  7.0  percentage points  over  the  baseline  for  boys  and girls (DLI  1). The  program \nwill  benefit  6.3 million  students,  153,200  teachers,  and  more  than  34,000  schools.  The  four \noutputs are: \n \n12. \nOutput  1:  Access  to  basic  and  secondary  schools  improved.  This  output  will  help \nimplement  a  revised  pro-poor  scholarship  program  in  all  75  districts,  and  will  include  targeted \ninterventions  for  girls  to  take  up  secondary  science  education  (DLI  1).  Many  students  do  not \nprogress  to  secondary  education  either  because  they  cannot  afford  it  or  the  learning \nenvironment in schools is poor. This output will redress the lack of affordability among students \nin  the  poorest  quintile  and  the  inadequate  participation  of  girls  in  science  subjects  compared \nwith  boys.  Teachers  often  cover  several  subjects  and  multiple  grades,  which  hampers  quality \nimprovement,  adversely  affecting  enrollment  and  retention  in  higher  grades.  This  output  will \nensure that 4,500 schools will each get separate individual subject teachers for math, science, \nand English in grades 6\u20138 and 9\u201312 (DLI 2, PAP 1.4).    \n \n13. \nOutput  2:  Quality  of  school  education  improved.  This  output  will  support  the \nprovision  of  activity-based  teaching  and  learning  materials  in  math,  science,  and  English  to \nschools (DLI 3, PAP 1.11); and additional ICT and e-resources to introduce students to modern \npedagogy (PAP 1.14). Schools do not have adequate access to materials to enable interactive \nlearning.  This  output  will  also  strengthen  the  continuous  professional  development  of  subject \nteachers  to  use  the  materials  in  the  classrooms  (DLI  2,  PAP  1.5).  An  autonomous  National \nExamination Board will be established to reform student assessment and testing to reduce the \nfocus  on  rote  learning  and  increase  the  emphasis  on  the  application  of  knowledge  and  skills. \nPublic examinations at the end of grades 8 and 10 will be reformed and standardized based on \ninternational good practice to improve the quality and relevance of student learning (DLI 4; PAP \n1.8, 1.9, and 1.10). \n \n14. \nOutput 3: Model school program pilot tested. This output will support the upgrading \nof  large  secondary  schools  to  model  schools  through  interventions  such  as  the  provision  of  a \nseparate  head \nteachers,  disaster  risk-resilient \ninfrastructure,  water  and  sanitation  facilities,  a  library,  a  science  laboratory,  ICT  facilities, \ninternet connectivity, and e-resources. Residential facilities will be provided in selected schools \nto ensure that poor and marginalized students have access to high-quality education. Innovative \n\nfull  complement  of  subject \n\nteacher,  a \n\n \n\n\fpedagogy  to  improve  teaching  and  learning,  especially  in  math,  science,  and  English,  will  be \nintroduced. With the provision of such comprehensive quality inputs, the model schools will act \nas demonstration sites for improving teaching and learning (DLI 5; PAP 1.12, 1.13, and 1.15). \n \nOutput 4: School system governance and management improved. This output aims \n15. \nto improve  management, monitoring,  and quality  assurance mechanisms  in  the schools.  It  will \nsupport the implementation of a revised school grant system that responds better to contextual \nneeds  and  is  performance  oriented.  This  output  will  lead  to  the  rollout  of  a  web-based \naccounting  and  procurement  system  in  all  the  districts  to  improve  fiduciary  management.  The \neducation  management  information  system  (EMIS)  will  be  upgraded  to  a  web-based  system \nthat  will  have  greater  accuracy  as  a  result  of  third-party  verification  (DLIs  6  and  7;  PAP  1.6, \n1.16, 1.17, 2.1 2.4, 3.2, and 3.3). \n \n16. \nThe seven DLI areas were derived from the SSDP results framework and the overall DLI \nframework  agreed  between  JFPs  and  the  government.  Financing  of  prior  results  DLIs  is \nenvisaged to ensure important enabling policy actions by loan effectiveness. These include the \nenactment of the Eighth Amendment to the Education Act, the development of selection criteria \nfor  model  schools,  and  formation  of  a  dedicated  program  management  and  technical  support \nteam for the program. The DLIs include an appropriate mix of outcome, output and institutional \nindicators. All output DLIs contribute to outcome (DLI 1). The DLIs are sufficiently ambitious as \nthey  ensure  a gradual  and sustained  scale-up  of results,  implementation  of  difficult  reforms  in \nteacher  management,  examinations  and  governance,  and  augmented  use  of  ICT.  The  PAP \nincludes key actions that are required for achieving the targets in the DLI framework and in the \nresults framework.

A  rigorous  verification  protocol,  including  independent  third-party  verification,  has \nbeen established. Verification of outcome and output DLIs will be based on the EMIS, which will \nbe  upgraded  to  a  web-based  system.  An  improved  EMIS  will  have  disaggregated  data  for \n\n120.0 \n\n100.0 \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fto  assess  progress  and \n\ngender  and  social  groups  and  increased  accuracy  from  two  rounds  of  independent  third-party \nverification.  The  JFPs  will  undertake  two  joint  review  missions  annually  (i)  to  verify  the \nachievement of DLIs, review financial management reports, and audit reports; and (ii) to review \nannual  work  plans  and  budgets.  In  addition,  the  attached  Capacity  Development  TA  will \nimplementation.  The \nundertake  periodic  surveys \nindependent Education Review Office will undertake regular quality audits of the school system.  \n \nE. \n \nProgram expenditures. The program expenditures are estimated at $6,461 million from \n18. \nFY2017 to FY2021. The total SSDP expenditures for the 7-year horizon (FY2017\u2013FY2023) are \nestimated at $10,577 million.

The  government  will  provide  $5,761  million  to  the  program,  while \nJFPs, including ADB, are expected to contribute about $436 million. Although the share of JFPs \nin  total  expenditure  is  low,  the  contribution  of  JFPs  is  significant  in  leveraging  development \nexpenditures, excluding salaries and remuneration that contribute to developmental outcomes. \nThe government has requested a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR85,507,000 from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the program. The loan terms and conditions are \nin para. 34. The government is likely to request additional financing from ADB and other JFPs \nupon  satisfactory  implementation  of  the  first  3 years  to  bridge  the  financing  gap  from  2019  to \n2021.

The loan proceeds will be disbursed over 5 years to the \ngovernment's treasury account based on the verified achievement of DLIs. The government will \nensure  that  total  program  expenditures  exceed  the  total  loan  amount  withdrawn.  ADB  will \nprovide  financing  for  prior  results  ($15  million),  to  be  achieved  by  loan  effectiveness.  MOE, \nthrough  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  will  submit  a  withdrawal  application  annually,  providing \nevidence on the achievement of DLIs, along with unaudited financial statements for the period \nconcerned.  Partial  disbursements  are  allowed  for  DLIs  1,  2,  3,  5,  and  6.  Disbursements  are \nallowed for early or late achievement of DLIs. \n \nF. \n \n21. \nThe  program  will  strengthen  capacity  in  the  school  education  sector  at  all  levels, \nparticularly  at  district  and  school  levels.  Capacity  development  activities  include  financial \nmanagement,  procurement,  gender  and  social \ninclusion,  and  social  and  environment \nsafeguards.  Key  initiatives  to  improve  quality  in  education  include  teacher  training  for  math, \nscience,  and  English  teaching;  student  assessment  and examination  reforms;  improvement  of \nthe reliability of EMIS; development of model schools; and ICT-enriched teaching and learning. \nThese are costed in the government\u2019s expenditure framework and incorporated in the PAP. \n \nG. \n \n22. \nThe  attached  capacity  development  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $625,000,  of  which \n$500,000 will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-\nV).  MOE  is  the  executing  agency.  The  government  will  provide  counterpart  staff,  office  and \nmeeting  space,  and  coordination  support.  TA  outputs  include  (i)  annual  fiduciary  reviews  to \nstrengthen financial management and procurement; (ii) independent verification of achievement \nof  DLIs;  (iii)  the  development  of  teacher  training  to  use  activity-based  materials  for  math, \nscience, and English; (iv) a road map for model school development; (v) safeguard compliance \nreporting; and (vi) the development of a scheme for pro-poor targeting of scholarships. The TA \nwill be coordinated through the Foreign Coordination Section of the Planning Division of MOE, \nwhich  will  function  as  the  program  coordination  secretariat  for  the  program.  The  TA  will  be \nimplemented immediately upon approval of the loan until 31 December 2021. \n \nH. \n \n23.  MOE  is  the  executing  agency  and  the  Department  of  Education  (DOE)  is  the \nimplementing  agency.  An  interministerial  SSDP  steering  committee,  chaired  by  the  MOE \nsecretary, will be established with the participation of key officials from MOE, DOE, Ministry of \nFinance, Financial Comptroller General Office, and the National Planning Commission; and the \nheads  of  central  line  agencies  in  education.  The  Foreign  Coordination  Section  of  MOE\u2019s \nPlanning  Division  will  function  as  the  program  coordination  secretariat.  A  technical  working \ncommittee will be set up in DOE for timely program implementation. These arrangements will be \ncommon  for  all  JFPs  supporting  the  program  and  will  include  dedicated  teams  for  SSDP \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fimplementation  to  cover  areas  such  as  program  management,  financial  management, \nprocurement, safeguard compliance, and DLI verification.9 \n \n\nIII. \n\nSUMMARY OF ASSESSMENTS \n\nProgram Technical Assessments \n\n \nA. \n \n24. \nTechnical assessments of the program were carried out through a joint appraisal of the \nprogram by JFPs and MOE. In addition, an external appraisal was carried out on behalf of the \nGlobal Partnership for Education. The main program interventions to support  the achievement \nof  the  key  targets  were  assessed  positively.  JFPs  and  the  government  agreed  on  a  single \nresults framework with yearly targets and a common DLI framework.10   \n \nThe  program  is  technically  sound  and highly  relevant  to the  development  needs  of  the \n25. \ncountry.  With  declining  enrollments  in  early  grades  because  of  population  trends  and  more \nstudents completing grade 8, the program will strengthen the government\u2019s focus on secondary \ngrades.  The  program  envisages  that  more  secondary  schools  will  offer  science  subjects  in \ngrades  11  and  12.  The  pilot  testing  of  200  model  schools  will  demonstrate  approaches  to \nschool-based quality improvement.  \n \n26. \nSubstantial  economic  and  social  benefits  are  expected  from  the  implementation  of  the \nSSDP.  The  three  sources  of  quantifiable  economic  benefits  are:  (i)  increase  in  the  number  of \nbasic and secondary education completers who earn higher wages (relative to non-completers), \n(ii)  better  quality  of  education  resulting  in  a  higher  wage  premium  for  all  basic  and  secondary \neducation completers, and (iii) less wastage of public and private resources as a result of fewer \ndropouts and repetitions. The economic analysis resulted in a sound economic internal rate of \nreturn  of  16.0%  for  the  program  (12.6%  for  basic  education  and  23.9%  for  secondary \neducation).  A  sensitivity  analysis  revealed  that  the  wage  premium  resulting  from  the  higher \nquality  of  education  affects  the  return  on  investment  more  than  other  variables,  implying  that \nelevating  the  overall  education  quality  of  the  workforce  would  bring  a  higher  return  on \ninvestment.  Social  analysis  confirmed  the  program\u2019s  strong  poverty  and  gender  focus.  The \nprogram is categorized as gender equity as theme. Increasing the participation of girls in grades \n11 and 12, particularly in science subjects, is a specific objective.   \n \nB. \n \n27.  Monitoring  and  evaluation  system.  The  EMIS  is  the  main  database  for  reporting  on \nkey  performance  indicators.  Information  on  program  and  financial  performance  is  provided \nthrough  annual  status  reports  and  financial  management  reports.  In  addition,  the  Education \nReview Office conducts periodic performance audits of the MOE system. These monitoring and \nevaluation mechanisms will undergo further strengthening and will be used for the reporting and \nverification  of  DLI  achievement.  EMIS  will  undergo  two  rounds  of  third-party  verification  to \nensure accuracy. EMIS data will also be used to generate school profile cards for social audits \nand sector performance reports. \n \n\nProgram Systems Assessments \n\n                                                \n9   Under  the  Joint  Financing  Arrangement,  a  framework  agreement  between  the  JFPs  (including  ADB)  and  the \ngovernment,  the  parties  have  agreed  on  a  common  procedure  for  the  government  to  conduct,  and  the  JFPs  to \nmonitor,  the  procurement  of  goods,  works,  and  services  under  the  program.  As  the  funds  of  ADB  and  all  other \nJFPs  will  be  commingled  to  jointly  finance  the  individual  procurement  packages  under  the  program,  universal \nprocurement  will  apply  (ADB.  2013.  Blanket  Waiver  of  Member  Country  Procurement  Eligibility  Restrictions  in \nCases of Cofinancing for Operations Financed from Asian Development Fund Resources. Manila). \n\n10 All JFPs support a common DLI framework, which will be included in the Joint Financing Arrangement. Some JFPs \nmay  have  simplified  procedures  that  do  not  require  DLIs  and  will  release  their  funds  based  on  satisfactory  joint \nreview missions and presentation of audit reports. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fFiduciary systems. The program will use program systems for financial management, \n28. \nprocurement,  and  anticorruption  measures.11  The  program  fiduciary  system  assessment  was \nundertaken  at  country,  MOE,  DOE,  and  District  Education  Office  (DEO)  levels.  The \ngovernment\u2019s Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment Report in 2015 had \nshown improvement in 16 out of 28 public financial management performance areas, compared \nwith  the  2008  assessment  report.12  However,  weaknesses  remain  in  internal  controls  and \noversight with capacity gaps in districts and schools. Problems of reconciliation between funds \nreleased  by  the  Financial  Comptroller  General  Office  and  expenditure  recorded  by  the  DEOs, \nand  the  lack  of  timely  action  on  audit  observations  prevent  efficient  functioning.  The  overall \nfiduciary  risk  is  substantial,  which  will  be  mitigated  through  a  continuous  program  of  system \nimprovement outlined in the Fiduciary Management Action Plan agreed between JFPs and the \ngovernment.  A  computerized  government  accounting  system  will  be  rolled  out  for  timely  and \naccurate  financial  management  reporting.  A  task  team  on  financial  management  in  MOE  will \nfollow up on audit observations.   \n \n29. \nThe program will follow program procurement systems. Country and sector procurement \ncapacity  was assessed, drawing on ADB\u2019s 2015  country and sector procurement assessment. \nWeaknesses found include: (i) lack of trained procurement staff, (ii) weak procurement planning \nand  compliance  monitoring,  and  (iii)  inadequate  monitoring  of  contractual  performance  in \nschools. The overall procurement risk is substantial, which will be mitigated by (i) filling vacant \npositions in DEOs to handle procurement; (ii) developing manuals for well-defined procurement \nprocedures  and  training  of  DEO  staff  in  procurement  oversight;  (iii) conducting  school-level \ntraining \nincluding  compliance  with  disclosure  of  contract \nopportunities  and  awards;  (iv)  performing  an  annual  technical  audit  of  the  construction  of \nschools;  and  (v)  promoting  an  electronic  government  procurement  system  with  training  for \nDEOs. The annual fiduciary review will diagnose bottlenecks and provide support to solve them. \n \n30. \nThe Guidelines to Prevent or Mitigate Fraud, Corruption, and Other Prohibited Activities \nin Results-Based Lending for Programs were explained to and discussed with the government.13   \n \n31. \nSafeguard  systems.  A  program  safeguard  system  assessment  was  carried  out  for \npotential  social  and  environment  impacts,  including  an  appraisal  of  applicable  laws  and \nregulations  and  institutional  capacity  for  mitigating  risks.14  The  major  risks  are  (i)  uneven \ncompliance  with  safeguard  regulations;  (ii)  weak  capacity  to  integrate  safeguard  measures  in \nprogram  implementation;  and  (iii)  inadequate  documentation  on  safeguard  compliance, \nincluding  the  transfer  of  land  titles  from  communities  to  schools  for  voluntary  land  donations. \nSafeguard  compliance  and  its  reporting  will  be  strengthened  with  the  establishment  of  a \nsafeguard desk with appropriate safeguard monitoring tools. The safeguard program actions are \nincluded in the PAP. The program safeguard systems assessment led to the categorization of B \nfor environment, C for involuntary resettlement, and B for indigenous people. \n \nC. \n \n32.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5. The risk ratings will be \nreduced  from  high  and  substantial  to  moderate  and  low  with  the  mitigation  measures.  The \noverall benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the risks and costs of mitigation. \n\nIntegrated Risk Assessment and Mitigating Measures \n\nin  procurement  procedures, \n\n                                                \n11 Program  systems  refer  to  country  systems  with  measures  for  improvements  as  agreed  between  ADB  and  the \n\nGovernment of Nepal. \n\n12 Government  of  Nepal,  Ministry  of  Finance.  2015.

It will rationalize the large number of existing discrete scholarship \nschemes. The revised pro-poor scholarship scheme will also include the \nprovision for scholarships for girls to study science subjects in grades 11 and \n12.The DLI is achieved when JFPs review and agree on the revised pro-poor \nscheme guidelines. \n \nThe revised pro-poor scholarship scheme is implemented in 15 districts, targeting \nthe poor, girls and boys, with the objective of increasing retention and completion \nrates for basic and secondary grades among poor students.  \n \nThis DLI is achieved when the MOE report confirming achievement of the DLI \ntarget is verified on a sample basis by an independent, third party recruited by the \nJFPs. \n \nPartial achievement is by the number of districts implementing the pro-poor \nscholarship scheme and the girls\u2019 science scholarship scheme.

Each of \nthese teachers may teach both the basic and secondary levels in the same \nschool. The 500 secondary schools exclude the model schools (see definition \nbelow in DLI5). The number of schools is cumulative over the years. \n \nThis DLI is achieved when the MOE report confirming achievement of the DLI \ntarget is verified on a sample basis by an independent, third party recruited by the \nJFPs. A school will be counted for the DLI only when it has at least one teacher \nfor each of math, science and English subjects.  \n \nPartial achievement of the DLI is by the number of schools meeting the DLI. Total \ndisbursement divided by 1,500 schools for Year 3 (2018), total disbursement \ndivided by 1,500 additional schools over Year 3 targets for Year 4 (2019), and \ntotal disbursement divided by 1,500 additional schools over Year 3 and Year 4 \ncumulative targets for Year 5 (2020). \n \nTrained subject teachers refer to the math, science and English subject \nteachers who have received the new one-month, subject-wise training \nimplemented by the NCED.

DOE and national resource \ngroup will provide detailed specifications for the standardized package of math, \nscience and English language kits to DEOs and schools. DEOs will provide \ngrants to schools and schools will purchase the kits from the market.  \n \nThis DLI is achieved when an independent, third party verifies, on a sample \nbasis, that the kits are available in the schools.
