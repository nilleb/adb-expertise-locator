The project will selectively enhance the \ndevelopment potential of medium-sized cities, small towns, and villages through (i) an inclusive \nurban  water  supply  system,  (ii)  urban  flood  risk  management  for  various-sized  rivers,  and  \n(iii)  improved  urban\u2013rural  road  connections.  Building  on  the  2010  project  experience, 2  the \nproject  will  demonstrate  new  approaches  for  integrated  urban\u2013rural  development  including \nclimate change adaptation, ecologically sound flood protection design, effective management of \ndrinking water quality, and enhanced road safety in seven districts and counties in Chongqing.3 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nChongqing is one of four centrally administered municipalities in the PRC. It is a part of \nthe less-developed western inland region targeted by the National Strategy for Development of \nthe  West,  which  has  contributed  significantly  to  accelerating  Chongqing\u2019s  economic  growth \nsince  2001.  However,  the  economic  benefits  have  been  unevenly  distributed  due  to \nChongqing\u2019s  topographical  characteristics  of  vast  hinterlands,  and  predominantly  hilly  and \nmountainous  terrain.4 In  Chongqing,  a  few  rapidly  developing  western  central  districts  coexist \nwith  high-poverty  peripheral  counties  in \nthe  northeast  and  southeast,  reflecting  wide \ndevelopment gaps.5 Imbalanced socioeconomic development is also evident within districts and \ncounties with urban expansion into rural areas.6 In 2011, the ratio of per capita gross domestic \nproduct  of  the  wealthiest  district  to  the  poorest  county  was  9:1;  the  ratio  of  the  urban\u2013rural \naverage  income  of  Chongqing  was  3.3:1.  Two  million  rural  residents  still  lived  below  the \ndesignated poverty line of CNY2,300 per annum. \n \nChongqing  is  the  first  PRC  provincial  demonstration  area  to  pilot  urban\u2013rural  reforms. \n4. \nSince  2008  Chongqing  has  made  continuous  efforts  to  achieve  more  sustainable  and  socially \ninclusive  development  by  reversing  the  trend  of  widening  urban\u2013rural  development  disparity. \nDuring 2008\u20132011, Chongqing invested CNY48.1 billion in public infrastructure and services to \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB.  2010.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loan  to  the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  the  Chongqing  Urban\u2013Rural  Infrastructure  Development  Demonstration  Project. \nManila. \n\n3   The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  a  project  preparatory  technical  assistance,  two  small  grants  for \nactivities under two regional technical assistance projects, and a pilot and demonstration activities under the Water \nFinancing Partnership Facility: ADB.  2011.

Manila. \n\n4   Chongqing\u2019s gross domestic product per capita in 2011 was CNY34,500 (approximately $5,308). \n5   There are 38 districts and counties under the jurisdiction of Chongqing municipality. In 2011, 66% of districts and \n\ncounties had lower per capita gross national product than the PRC average of $5,433. \n\n6   Sector Assessment (Summary): Multisector (water supply and sanitation, irrigation, drainage, and flood protection, \n\nroad transport) (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\naddress  inequalities.  The  2010  project  is  further  strengthening  basic  infrastructure  of  small \ntownships and villages in poor northeastern and southeastern regions.7 However, the progress \nof  closing  urban\u2013rural  development  gaps  has  been  very  slow.  Chongqing  still  follows  a \ntraditional centralized urban development pattern with the western central region producing 78% \nof  its  total  gross  domestic  product  and  continuing  as  a  major  destination  for  rural  migrant \nworkers.8 In Chongqing, no other regional urban center exists along the Yangtze river economic \ncorridor to rebalance its development. Many second- and third-tier cities remain less attractive \nfor  investment  to  support  economic  activities  due  to  risks  of  frequent  floods  and  lack  of  basic \nurban  infrastructure.  Many  of  the  Chongqing\u2019s  remote  rural  towns  and  villages  are  left  behind \nfrom its overall development because of the insufficient transport network and access roads. To \nrebalance development, Chongqing must support different levels of cities, towns, and villages to \nenhance its physical connectivity and economic competitiveness. The project will (i) strengthen \nthe  development  potential  of  Wanzhou  to  become  Chongqing\u2019s  second  regional  center  by \nimproving water supply service and drinking water quality; (ii) enhance flood resilience of county \ncapitals and cities to meet their need to become local economic centers in Rongchang, Wulong, \nand  Youyang counties; and  (iii)  provide  better social  and  economic  development  opportunities \nby  connecting  isolated  townships  and  poor  villages  in  Chengkou  and  Shizhu  counties,  and \nFuling district.  \n \n5. \nDemonstration  features.  The  project  incorporates  lessons  from  the  ongoing  2010 \nproject. The initial selection criteria for project components strongly emphasized supporting key \nregional  cities,  towns,  and  villages.  Accordingly,  to  foster  urban\u2013rural  integration,  selection \ncriteria  under  the  current  project  include  (i)  strong  demonstration  impact,  (ii)  geographic \nbalance, and (iii) local project management and financial capacity.  The project will demonstrate \nthe following special features of inclusive and environment\u2013friendly urban\u2013rural development in \nChongqing: (i) climate-proofing design based on a detailed climate change impact assessment \n(for the first time in an ADB project in the PRC); (ii) application of the water safety plan (WSP) \ndeveloped  by  the  World  Health  Organization  to  systematically  address  the  risk  of  unsafe \ndrinking water; (iii) adoption of an ecologically sound flood protection design that minimizes soil \nexcavation and retains natural river flows; and (iv) implementation of enhanced road safety and \nengineering  designs based  on  the  needs  of local  residents.  The project will  directly  benefit  25 \ntownships and 173 villages, while indirectly benefiting all districts and counties in Chongqing by \ndemonstrating effective financial support to balance urban\u2013rural development. \n \n6. \nStrategic  fit  and  lessons.  The  project  aligns with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership strategy, \n2011\u20132015 for the PRC9 and ADB\u2019s water and urban operational plans,10 which emphasize the \nvalue  of  ensuring  inclusive  growth,  environmentally  sustainable  growth,  flood  mitigation,  and \ninclusive  water  policy  reforms;  and  enhancing  cities\u2019  competitiveness \nthrough  urban \ndevelopment.  The  project  supports  the  PRC\u2019s  Twelfth  Five-Year  Plan,  2011\u20132015,  which \ntargets  rising \nimprovement,  and  regionally  balanced  and \nenvironmentally  sustainable  growth  to  attain  the  long-term  goal  of  building  a  harmonious  and \nmoderately  prosperous  society.  It  contributes  to  the  PRC\u2019s  achievement  of  Millennium \nDevelopment  Goal  7. 11 The  project  design  incorporates  lessons  from  the  2010  project  and \n\nincome  inequality,  livelihood \n\n                                                \n7   The  2010  project  is  financing  key  infrastructure  to  (i)  improve  small-scale  water  supply  systems  of  72,500  cubic \nmeters per  day  capacity  in  selected  small cities  and  townships,  and  (ii)  construct  and upgrade 362 kilometers  of \nrural roads in eight poor districts and counties. Project implementation is in its second year.  \n\n8  In 2011, about 5.0 million rural workers (55.2% of total migrant workers) migrated within Chongqing municipality. \n\nMost relocated from poor counties to the western central districts. \n\n9  ADB. 2012.

Technical  feasibility  was  assessed \nto  be  adequate  after  detailed  examination  of  the  project\u2019s  compatibility  with  local  conditions \nincluding projections of water demand, required level of flood discharge, and function of roads. \nAlternative  technical  options  identified  the  best  alignment  of  tunnels,  roads,  and  dikes;  WTP \nlocation;  water  treatment  systems;  and  sludge  management  in  terms  of  economic  and \nsafeguard aspects. The project will provide training under its capacity development component \nto  ensure  sustainable  O&M  of  project  facilities.  Learning  from  the  2010  project,  the  project \nmanagement consulting service includes six specialists with total inputs of  122 person-months \nfor rigorous review of technical designs. The demonstration features of the project engineering \ndesign  include  (i)  climate-proofing  through  a  combination  of  engineering  and  nonengineering \nmeasures in Youyang and Wulong counties; (ii) ecologically sound river enhancement design by \nretaining  natural  hydrological  features  and  habitat  diversity,  minimizing  water  pollution,  and \nimproving public access in Rongchang county; (iii) enhanced monitoring capacity and laboratory \nfacilities  to  ensure  sustainable  delivery  of  safe  drinking  water  based  on  the WSP  in Wanzhou \ndistrict;  (iv)  enhanced  road  safety  in  Fuling  district,  and  Shizhu  and  Chengkou  counties;  and  \n(v)  upgraded  web-based  project  management  and  information  system  to  enhance  institutional \ncoordination.16  \n \nB. \n \n14. \nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  was  estimated  by  comparing  with-  and \nwithout-project  scenarios.  The  analysis  evaluated  technical  options  and  confirmed  that  all \nsubprojects are the least-cost options to support Chongqing\u2019s long-term development plans and \neach district and county master plan. The EIRRs are 15.3% for the overall project, 19.6% for the \nflood management component, 12.3% for the road component, and 13.9% for the water supply \ncomponent;  all  exceed  the  economic  opportunity  cost  capital  of  12%.17 Quantifiable  economic \nbenefits  to  be  generated  by  project  interventions  include  (i)  increased  land  value  and \ndevelopment potential by minimizing flood risks, (ii) savings of vehicle operating costs and time, \n(iii)  income  gained  from  year-round  road  access,  and  (iv)  improved  water  supply  services \nmeasured  through  willingness  to  pay.  Economic  costs  include  capital  costs  including  physical \ncontingencies,  and  O&M  costs.  Sensitivity  analysis  indicates  that  the  overall  project  EIRR  will \ndrop to 13.3% if benefits are reduced by 10%. However, qualitative benefits of improved access \nto  social  services,  and  reduced  economic  activities  from  flood  damage  are  not  included, \nsuggesting that the project\u2019s economic benefits would be higher than the projections. \n \nThe financial viability analysis of the revenue-generating Wanzhou Yangliu water supply \n15. \nsubproject indicates that the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) is 6.1%, which exceeds the \nweighted average cost of capital of 3.7%. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the project is most \nsensitive to decreases in revenue, but the FIRR remains higher than the weighted average cost \nof  capital  at  4.4%.  Water  tariffs  are  expected  to  increase  by  10.0%  every  5  years,  which  is \nconsidered  conservative  compared  with  historical  tariff  revisions  in  Wanzhou.18 The  analysis \nconcluded  that  low-income  urban  households  will  be  able  to  afford  the  projected  tariff \n\n                                                \n16 The 2010 project (footnote 2) developed a web-based project information management system to strengthen ADB \n\nproject management and coordination in Chongqing. The system will be upgraded in the current project. \n\n17 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 The past tariff increases were 31% (1999\u20132001), 50% (2001\u20132004), and 21% (2004\u20132010). \n\n\fGovernance \n\nincreases\u2014the  share  of  income  expended  on  water  and  wastewater  will  be  about  2.6%  of  a \npoor  household\u2019s  monthly  income.  The  FIRR  drops  to  3.1%  in  the  combined  cases  of  (i)  a \n10.0% increase in capital costs, (ii) a 10.0% decrease in revenue, and (iii) a 10.0% increase in \noperating costs. The tariff will be closely monitored and policy dialogue will be conducted during \nproject implementation to ensure the subproject\u2019s financial sustainability. \n \n16. \nFinancial  analysis  of  nonrevenue-generating  flood  management  and  road  components \nwas  carried  out  to  ensure  fiscal  sustainability  during  implementation  and  operation.  The  fiscal \nimpact  on  the  project  district  and  county  governments  was  assessed  by  comparing  annual \nrevenues from identified financing sources with annual counterpart funds required for (i) capital \nexpenditures  during  project  implementation,  and  (ii)  recurrent  costs  for  subproject  O&M  and \ndebt  service  during  operation.  The  analysis  indicates  that  all  subprojects  have  sufficient \ncounterpart  funds  during  project  implementation  and  funds  for  O&M  and  debt  service  during \noperation.  Annual  counterpart  funds  and  interest  during  construction  will  range  from  0.3%  to \n2.0% of projected fiscal revenues during implementation. O&M and debt service will range from \n0.1% to 0.7% of projected revenues in 2019 when principal repayment of the ADB loan will start. \nThis indicates acceptable fiscal risk for the governments for counterpart funds. Training will be \nconducted to strengthen their capacity for public financial management.19  \n \nC. \n \n17. \nCMG  and  its  Project  Management  Office  have  successfully  managed  complex  urban \nsector  projects  funded  by  ADB  and  the  World  Bank.  All  project  districts  and  counties  have \nexperience with projects financed by international financial institutes. Procurement capacity and \nfinancial  management  assessments  conclude  that  the  project  district  and  county  governments \nand the project implementing units (PIUs) have adequate capacity for procurement and financial \nmanagement  in  accordance  with  ADB  policies  and  procedures,  and  national  laws  and \nregulations.  The  project  district  and  county  governments  follow  the  domestic  procurement \nprocesses  of  the  PRC  Tendering  Law  and  Chongqing  Municipality  Tendering  Regulations. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date), and Accountability Mechanism Policy \n(2012) were explained to and discussed with CMG, the project district and county governments, \nand the PIUs. The project district and county governments and the PIUs are receiving practical \nknowledge  support  for  procurement,  financial  management,  and  governance  issues  from  the \ndistricts and counties participating in the 2010 project. Training will be provided to enhance PIU \nfinancial management and internal audit system. \n \nD. \n \n18. \nAn  estimated  259,903  people  will  benefit  directly  from  the  project.  Six  of  the  seven \nproject  districts  and  counties  are  designated  poverty  counties  with  poverty  incidence  of  14%\u2013\n30%. The average rural poverty rate in villages in project areas is about 10%, with one reaching \n24%  (Chengkou).  The  project\u2019s  improvement  of  resilience  to  flood  events,  urban\u2013rural  road \nnetworks,  and  access  to  safe  drinking  water  will  contribute  to  more  balanced  social  and \neconomic development by (i) supporting development of key cities and towns in poor counties, \nand (ii) reducing constraints on socioeconomic development in more isolated, poor rural areas. \nThe  improved  water  supply  services  will  provide  better  public  health.  The  flood  management \ncomponent  will  reduce  economic  loss  for  poor  urban  families  from  crop  damage  and  attract \nmore investment in county urban centers. Road improvements will increase the incomes of poor \nrural  farmers  by  (i)  providing  them  with  better  options  for  marketing  their  goods,  (ii)  reducing \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n                                                \n19  Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nSafeguards \n\ntransport  costs  and  travel  time,  and  (iii)  enabling  them  to  grow  cash  crops.  In  addition,  the \nproject  will  have  more  indirect  benefit  to  overall  Chongqing  by  its  demonstration  impact  and \nreplication  potential.  A  social  action  plan  to  ensure  inclusive  benefits  will  be  monitored  by  a \nresettlement and social development specialist.20 \n \n19. \nGender benefits. The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. Results \nfrom the household survey and focus group discussions indicate that the primary responsibilities \nof  women  involve  all  housekeeping  activities,  care  of  family  members,  and  crop  farming. \nWomen in isolated villages are particularly affected by poor mobility and lack of job opportunity. \nThe  project  will significantly  improve their mobility  and access to social services,  employment, \nand  income  opportunities.  The  project  includes  a  gender  action  plan  (GAP)  to  help  ensure \ntargets  and  activities  such  as  (i)  increased  women\u2019s  participation  in  the  project,  including  a \ntarget  of  at  least  30%  employment  opportunities  for women, the  poor,  and/or  ethnic minorities \nduring construction; (ii) women\u2019s participation in gender-sensitive training on public road safety \nand  water  conservation  programs;  (iii)  sex  disaggregated  baseline  and  survey  data  collection; \nand  (iv)  implementation  and  monitoring  of  the  GAP  indicators.  The  district  and  county \ngovernments  with  the  assistance  of  the  resettlement  and  social  development  specialist  are \nresponsible for GAP implementation, and reporting on project progress and achievements.21 \n \nE. \n \n20. \nEnvironment.  The  project  is  classified  category  A  for  environment.  The  categorization \nwas  mainly  triggered  by  (i)  earthwork  and  soil  erosion  related  to  road  construction  in \nmountainous terrain; (ii) potential impacts on physical cultural resources in Youyang and Shizhu \ncounties,  and municipal  nature  reserves  in  Fuling  district  and  Shizhu  county;  (iii)  the  safety  of \nthe Yangliu WTP operations in Wanzhou district; and (iv) impacts of the river enhancement and \nflood management components in Rongchang, Wulong, and Youyang counties on river ecology \nand downstream areas. The subprojects\u2019 scope, project sites, road alignments, and the design \nof  flood  control  works  were  adjusted  at  the  feasibility  study  stage  to  minimize  land  acquisition \nand  earthwork,  and  avoid  impacts  on  sensitive  areas.  An  environmental  impact  assessment \n(EIA)  was  prepared  and  posted  on  the  ADB  website  on  15  August  2012.22 The  EIA  complies \nwith  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  EIA  concludes \nthat  anticipated \nenvironmental impacts and risks can be mitigated through implementation of the environmental \nmanagement  plan  (EMP),  which  defines  mitigation  measures,  monitoring  requirements, \ninstitutional  responsibilities,  and  training  and  institutional  strengthening  plans  to  ensure  proper \nenvironmental  management  throughout  project  construction  and  operation.  The  EMP  includes \nspecific  safeguard  plans  addressing  the  major  anticipated  impacts,  including  (i)  soil  erosion \nprotection  plans  for  each  subproject,  (ii)  a  physical  cultural  resources  risk  management  plan, \nand  (iii)  a  WSP  for  the  Wanzhou  Yangliu  water  supply  plant  subproject.  Environmental \nmanagement  is  supported  by  loan  covenants  and  capacity  development  and  institutional \nstrengthening activities under the project. The project district and county governments disclosed \nrelevant environment information to  potentially affected people, and the results and findings of \nthe  consultation  process  were  used  to  modify  project  design  and  the  EIA.  Consultation  and \npublic  participation  will  continue  throughout  project  implementation  and  any  environmental \ncomplaints  or  disputes  will  be  handled  in  accordance  with  the  grievance  redress  mechanism \ndefined for the project. \n\n                                                \n20 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The  \n\nsocial action plan is included in the PAM. \n\n21 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 Environmental Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\ffor \n\nInvoluntary  resettlement.  The  project  is  classified  category  A  for \n\ninvoluntary \n21. \nresettlement. 23  Seven  resettlement  plans  prepared  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  (2009)  were  approved  by  ADB  and  the  project  district  and  county  governments, \ndisclosed to the affected persons, and uploaded to the ADB website by 10 April 2013. Overall, \nthe project will affect 3,221 persons, of which 321 will be relocated. The project will permanently \nacquire  2,117  mu  of  collective  and  state-owned  land,  temporary  acquire  370  mu  of  land,  and \ndemolish  14,520  square  meters  (m2)  of  residential  and  nonresidential  buildings.24 The  project \ndistrict  and county  governments  have stated that  the funds  for involuntary  resettlement will  be \nmade  available  on  time.  Capacity  development  and  institutional  strengthening  activities  will \nsupport  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plans,  which  will  be  monitored  and  evaluated \ninternally and externally. The project district and county governments, and PIUs, which have at \nleast  two  full-time  staff  responsible \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement,  will  report \nimplementation progress regularly to CMG, which will summarize the progress in the quarterly \nprogress  report  to  ADB.  The  external  monitor  will  review  the  progress  and  general  welfare  of \naffected persons to assess whether they have fully regained their standard of living. Monitoring \nand evaluation reports will be prepared semiannually during implementation and annually for 2 \nyears  after  resettlement  completion,  and  submitted  and  published  on  the  ADB  website.  A \ntransparent  grievance  channel  will  provide  a  meaningful  consultation  mechanism,  and  trigger \nremedial action defined for the project. \n \nIndigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  classified  category  B  for  the  indigenous  peoples \n22. \nsafeguard. Shizhu and Youyang counties are autonomous ethnic minority counties and are also \ndesignated poverty counties. Two ethnic minority development plans were prepared, approved \nby ADB and the project district and county governments, and disclosed to the affected persons \nby 9 April 2013 to facilitate their participation and inclusion in the project benefits. Both Tujia and \nMiao  people  in  Chongqing  are  fully  integrated,  both  socially  and  economically,  with  the  Han \npopulation.  Ethnic minority  lands to  be  affected  by the  project  have formal  legal  titles,  and  will \nreceive  full  compensation.  The  poverty  and  social  assessment  survey  and  consultations \nconcluded that all beneficiaries, including ethnic minorities, will equally benefit from the project. \nThere  will  be  no  adverse  impacts  other  than  resettlement  impacts  on  1,001  ethnic  minority \npersons and construction of their new houses. The overall project design includes prioritization \nof ethnic minorities for construction jobs and O&M activities and the use of the local language, \nwhere necessary, in communication and outreach for consultations. \n \nF. \n \n23.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.25 Risks identified from implementation of the \n2010 project and appropriate mitigation measures are included.  \n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \n\n(i)  CMG and the PMC will conduct training on financial management to \n\nstrengthen creditworthiness of project districts and counties and identify \nalternative financing options. \n\nRisks \nHigh debt of some project districts and \ncounties may threaten the financial \nsustainability of the project \ncomponents causing late provision of \ncounterpart funding \nThe PIUs lack an effective \nanticorruption strategy or action plan \n                                                \n23  Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24  A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.667 square meters). \n25   Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n(i)  The PMC will organize seminars on ethical values and provide \n\n(ii)  The PMC will provide training for implementing agency and PIU staff to \n\nassistance to establish a public complaint system.  \n\navoid delays in disbursement. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks \nand relevant local institutions, hence \ntransparency and accountability is \nreduced \nComplex institutional coordination \nchallenges result in lack of information \nsharing and work synchronization, and \ndelays in project implementation \n\nMitigating Measures \n\n(ii)   CMG and the implementing agencies will check performance and \n\nremind relevant agencies of the loan covenant for day-to-day operation \nand communication. \n\n(i)  The PMC will establish a systematic information collection system, \nincluding upgrade of CMG\u2019s web-based project management and \ninformation system to regularly track project implementation.  \n\n(ii) The PMC will monitor project implementation by frequent site inspections \n\nand regular coordination meetings with CMG, project districts and \ncounties, PIUs, and other related agencies. \n\nChange in key personnel within CMG \nand project district and county \ngovernments affect project progress \nand continuity \n\n(i)  ADB will conduct regular consultations and dialogue with officials from \nthe PRC government, CMG, project district and county governments, \nand local beneficiaries to ensure continuous project support. \n\n(ii)   CMG and project district and county governments keep detailed project \n\nDelay in land acquisition and \nresettlement approvals and \nimplementation \n\nTownship O&M units of Youyang \ncounty lack knowledge to ensure \nsustainable operation of the flood \ndikes and associated facilities \n\nrecords to maintain good institutional documentation. \n\n(i)  Project districts and counties will make compensation funds for affected \n\npersons available early.  \n\n(ii)  CMG will transfer experience and knowledge from the 2010 project \n\ndistricts and counties to ongoing ADB-financed projects. \n\n(i)  The PMC will support the Youyang county government to establish \n\ntownship O&M units for flood dikes and associated facilities. \n\n(ii) The PMC will conduct capacity building to ensure assigned government \nbureaus and newly established PIU acquire up-to-date knowledge on \nlong-term dike O&M skills. \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  CMG  =  Chongqing  municipal  government,  O&M  =  operations  and  maintenance, \nPIU = project implementing unit, PMC = project management consultant, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\n \n24. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the project \nadministration  manual  and  loan  documents.
