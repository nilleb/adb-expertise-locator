The  Investment  Program \nhas \nframeworks. \nIndividual  tranches  or  batches  of  subprojects  are  backed  by  safeguards \nplans.  The  project  financed  from  the  first  tranche  (Tranche  1  Project)  has \nbeen subjected to due diligence work on environmental and social aspects. \nIndigenous  People\u2019s  issues  are  not  considered  relevant  in  this  case. \nThe  Tranche  1  Project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  the  purpose  of \nenvironmental  safeguards.  Subsequent  tranche  projects  will  follow  the \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  framework  and  the  resettlement \nframework, prepared by the Ministry of Public Works (MPW), examined and \nendorsed as sound by ADB. These frameworks (shown in Appendix 10 and \nSupplementary  Appendix  D  respectively)  set  out  the  policies,  principles, \nand  procedures  for  assessing,  managing,  and  monitoring  environmental \nand  resettlement  impacts.  The  Tranche  1  Project  does  not  involve  any \nsignificant land acquisition or resettlement issues. \n \nThe Afghanistan National Development Strategy (ANDS), launched by the \nGovernment \nfor \ndevelopment  over  the  period  of  2008\u20132020.  Its  aim  is  to  promote  growth, \ngenerate  wealth,  and  cut  poverty  and  vulnerability.  ANDS  goes  across  all \nkey  sectors  and  subsectors.  It  also  embraces  several  themes.  One  of  the \nmain  sectors  is  transport  and  logistics.  The  strategy  sets  out  quantitative \nand  qualitative  targets  (physical  and  nonphysical)  and  covers  various \nsystems,  including  roads  and  railways.  Within  the  road  subsector,  the \nstrategy  caters \nfor  national,  provincial,  rural,  and  city  roads,  and \nemphasizes  the  construction  of  new  assets  and  the  management, \nmaintenance,  and  repair  of  existing  ones.  The  underlying  objective  is  to \nimprove  connectivity  (within  the  country  and  with  neighboring  borders), \nimprove efficiency and safety of travel and goods transport, and strengthen \ninstitutions. Within the roads arena, the national roads take priority over the \nothers, at least in the short to medium term (next 7 years). \n \nThe  proposed  MFF  finances  a  slice  of  a  broad  Investment  Program  over \nthe  medium  term.  It  focuses  on  the  national  roads.  This  slice  of  the \nInvestment  Program  combines  physical  investments  with  institutional \nchanges.  The  physical  part  of  the  overall  Investment  Program  involves \nconstructing about 2,900 kilometers (km) of national roads and maintaining \n\nthe  country\u2019s  strategic  platform \n\nin  April  2008, \n\nis \n\n\f \n\nii \n \n\n \n\nin  2007.  This  MFF  submission  should  have \n\nabout  1,500  km  of  existing  ones.  This  is  to  be  done  by  2013.  The \nnonphysical part of the Investment Program includes the reorganization of \nMPW,  the  creation  of  a  new  agency  to  deal  with  national  roads,  the \nestablishment  of  a  maintenance  facility,  introduction  of  improved  traffic \nsafety  procedures,  and  the  execution  of  training  programs  to  improve \nplanning and project management. \n \nThe  Investment  Program  is  part  of  a  road  map  or  strategy  for  the  sector \nspreading into the medium term. This strategy is aligned with ANDS and in \nline with the Government\u2019s current thinking on what ADB should do in the \ncountry.  The  latter  is  articulated  in  a  country  partnership  strategy  (CPS) \npaper,  which  is  at  an  advanced  stage  of  preparation.  The  CPS  will  be \nconsidered by the Board early in 2009. The CPS had been held back by the \npresentation  of  ANDS  in  Paris  in  the  summer  2008,  as  well  as  by  the \nrestructuring  of  the  Resident  Mission  and  ADF  X  negotiations.  The  main \ndirections  taken  in  the  CPS  were  presented  to  the  Board  at  an  informal \nfollowed  the \nseminar \npresentation of the CPS. The CPS calls on ADB to focus its action on three \nmain  areas:  infrastructure  (roads,  and  on  a  selective  basis,  railways), \npower and energy, and irrigation. The Government also wants ADB to set \naside  an  envelope  every  year  to  support  reforms  related  to  microfinance, \nbusiness climate improvement, and public financial resource management. \nRoads, energy, irrigation, and microfinance are the four areas where (i) the \nGovernment  has  a  need  and  wants  ADB\u2019s  involvement,  and  (ii)  ADB  has \nskills,  knowledge/information,  and  track  record.  These  are  also  the  areas \nwhere  ADB  compares  well  with  other  development  partners.  On  the  other \nhand, ADB has been less active in the social services fields. Other donors \nhave been more active and stronger in these areas. The CPS also caters \nfor  work  on  institutional  effectiveness,  particularly  in  relation  to  the  bodies \nmanaging  the  priority  sectors.  There  will  be  several  levels  and  types  of \ninterventions  here:  training  for  better  planning  and  project  management; \ngender mainstreaming; financial  management,  anticorruption  and  fiduciary \noversight;  private  sector  development;  safeguards  (environmental  and \nsocial) policies and management; and regional cooperation. The CPS calls \non ADB to be  more  programmatic  in  terms  of  its  financing  approaches,  in \nparticular  to  use  whenever  possible  the  MFF  modality\u2014as  a  means  of \nincreasing  the  profile  and  resource  envelope  for  implementation  work, \nreducing the incidence of cost overruns on projects (cost estimates change \ntoo  quickly  and  by  substantial  amounts),  and  linking  finance  availability  to \nproject readiness. \n \nThe MFF has been designed based on assessments over the past several \nyears  with  donors \ntechnical,  operational, \ncommercial, legal, financial, and other matters. These assessments led to \nthe  problem  tree  analysis  by  ADB  as  shown  in  Appendix  2.  This  problem \ntree leads to the investment proposal and that to the outcome shown in the \ndesign and monitoring framework (DMF) of the MFF as a whole, as well as \nfor the Tranche 1 Project. This DMF is shown in Appendix 1. Basically, the \ncurrent  national  roads  network  has  two  main  problems:  (i)  it  offers  limited \ncoverage (not enough points in the country are interconnected) and quality \n(existing roads are in bad shape because of poor maintenance); and (ii) the \n\nincluding  ADB,  covering \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nroutes. \n\nthe  construction \n\ninstitutions  dealing  with  the  sector  are  weak.  These  two  problems  take \nplace within an environment beset by insecurity, lack of financial resources \n(national  and  international),  and  inadequate  qualified  people  to  plan  and \nmanage roads. \n \nThe proposed MFF has an important feature: it will address financing gaps \nin several ongoing road projects, including those financed by ADB. Several \nstrategic  road  projects  are  at  risk  of  winding  down  because  of  mounting \nfinancing  gaps;  in  most  cases  brought  about  by  fast  rising  construction \ncosts.  Increasing  insurgency  (making  construction  slower  than  it  should) \nand the rapid escalation of fuel and material prices (including bitumen) are \nthe  main  contributors.  Under  normal  circumstances  and  in  line  with  loan \nagreements, the Government is required to make up for funding shortfalls. \nHowever,  Afghanistan\u2019s  budget  also  happens  to  be  badly  constrained  at \npresent  (tax  revenues  are  down  and  capital  and  recurrent  expenditure \nneeds  are  up).  This  situation  is  making  it  difficult  for  the  Government  to \nmeet  obligations  under  civil  works  contracts.  The  MFF  will  provide \nfinancing for sound and strategic projects affected by these cost overruns \nand the Government\u2019s inability to pay (as opposed to changes in scope). \n \nAn important feature of the Investment Program is its inclusion of the basic \nneeds  of  communities  along \nInadequate \nengagement  of  local  communities  and  enterprises  in  past  has  contributed \nto  insurgent  threats.  The  Government  intends  to  use  the  Afghanistan \nReconstruction  Trust  Fund  to  finance  these  works,  which  will  include \nimproving  basic  small-scale  infrastructure\u2014drinking  water,  school,  and \nhealth clinic repairs, etc. This represents a \u201cwin-win\u201d proposition for all\u2014the \nGovernment,  contractors,  and  consultants\u2014and  will  lead  to  greater  buy-in \nfrom villages, and thereby lower security risks. \n \nThe Government has requested ADB to provide up to $400 million to help \nfinance  the  Investment  Program  through  an  MFF.  The  MFF  is  justified  on \nseveral  grounds  and  is  considered  superior  to  other  modalities  on  offer. \nFirst,  the  MFF  fits  neatly  within  the  strategic  framework  that  ADB  has \nagreed  with  Afghanistan.  Although  the  CPS  still  needs  to  be  approved  by \nthe  Board,  the  main  elements  of  the  country  strategy  have  been  agreed \nwith  the  Government  and  are  aligned  to  ANDS.  Second,  the  MFF  brings \nthe  analytical  work  upfront  and  then  releases  time  and  resources  for \nimplementation.  To  generate  outcome  and  impacts,  the  Investment \nProgram  must  improve  institutional  effectiveness,  but  also  increase \ncontract awards and disbursements. The MFF provides a good platform for \nestablishing  a  program  management  office  (PMO)  with  core  expertise  in \nproject management and themes, but also for refocusing ADB\u2019s resources \nand skill mix in the field. The MFF allows parties to plan ahead and engage \nexperts for the long haul. Third, the MFF helps the country team plan and \nmanage the Asian Development Fund (ADF) envelope in a more effective \nmanner.  Under  the  CPS  business  plan,  ADB  will  work  simultaneously  in \ntransport, energy, irrigation, and reforms. The intention  is  to  have  the  first \nthree  supported  through  MFFs.  This  approach  will  allow  the  country  to \ndraw  finance  from  umbrella  facilities  in  line  with  project  readiness.  This \nnot only improves ADF \u201ccash management\u201d, but also means \u201cfresher\u201d and \n\n \nMultitranche \nFinancing \nFacility \n\n \n\n\fthereof,  adherence \n\nmore reliable investment cost estimates in each of the sectors\u2014a source of \ngreat  concern  in  a  rapidly  changing  construction  cost  environment. \nFourth, although not perfect, the main pre-conditions for the use of the MFF \nare  in  place:  road  map,  policy  framework,  investment  plan,  and  financing \nplan. The policy framework is adequate, although this is the weakest of the \nfour pre-conditions for the MFF. The Government has established a set of \nbasic  principles  (including  cost  recovery,  maintenance  and  repair,  and \nfunding \nto  best  practice  on  construction  and \nsafeguards,  governance,  competition,  and  institutional  restructuring),  but \nmore  specifics  and  refinements  will  be  needed  over  time.  The  policy \nprinciples  look  fine  on  paper  but  the  big  issue  is  the  capacity  to  provide \nproper  follow-up  and  manage  change,  as  and  when  needed.  This  gap  is \nmostly  a  function  of  lack  of  qualified  personnel.  The  MFF  will  provide \nfinance to work on this. It will also provide advisory services to tighten the \nframework  and  monitor  progress.  The  rest  of  the  pre-conditions  are  in \nbetter shape. \n \nAfghanistan\u2019s  reconstruction  and  development  need  investments  in  many \nareas.  Roads  are  one  of  these.  Poor  connectivity  hampers  investment, \ntrade, people\u2019s mobility, and ultimately job creation. This affects the cost of \ndoing business, but also prevents Afghanistan from becoming an attractive \ntransit option for Central Asian trade. Lack of enough and well maintained \nroads  leaves  rural  areas  isolated.  This  has  a  negative  impact  on  growth \nand  prospects  for  social  inclusiveness,  peace,  and  stability.  Everyone  is \naffected:  manufacturers,  public  and  private  sector  service  providers, \nfarmers,  truckers,  wholesalers,  retailers,  women,  and  children.  The  MFF \nmakes sense. One of its merits is to build not only new assets and maintain \nexisting ones, but also to work on the institutional front. \n \nThe  problem  tree  analysis  attached  to  the  MFF  summarizes  the  core \nproblem in the transport sector, including the causes behind it. Afghanistan \nhas an inefficient and unsafe transport system\u2014with limited coverage and \nquality.  The  Investment  Program  is  intended  to  fix  this  problem  over  time \n(see Design and Monitoring Framework shown in Appendix 1). \n \n\nfor \n\n \nInvestment Plan  The  investment  plan  for  the  Investment  Program  in  the  medium  term  is \nunder  $1.3  billion.  Over  the  longer  haul,  and  with  railways  and  other  road \nclasses  included,  the  size  of  the  investment  is  several  times  higher  than \nthis.  The  Investment  Program  costs  will  be  shared  by  the  international \nfinancing  institutions,  including  the  World  Bank  and  the  United  States \nthe \nAgency \nInvestment  Program  costs  assigned  to  ADB  amounts  to  $400  million. \nThis is also related to the amount of finance potentially available from ADB \nunder ADF X, which includes an initial 2-year commitment of around $200 \nmillion  a  year.  This  might  then  be  adjusted  (up  or  down)  depending  on \nwhether  the  country  enters  the  performance  based  allocation  system. \nA decision on this will only be made at the mid-term review of ADF X.  \n \nThe  financing  plan  for  the  Investment  Program  is  being  worked  upon  and \nremains  tentative  at  this  stage.  The  Government  has  had  detailed \ndiscussions  with  the  World  Bank,  USAID,  and  others.  At  this  stage, \n\nInternational  Development  (USAID).

The \nGovernment  will  also  try  to  tap  various  bilateral  agencies.  ADB  has  had \nconsultations with the donors on the financing plan. So far, it has received \nfirm  commitments  only  from  some  of  them.  The  plan  below  is,  therefore, \ntentative  and  does  not  commit  any  of  the  parties  to  the  Investment \nProgram. Fund raising work will need to be stepped up in the near future. \n \n\nTentative Financing Plan: 2008\u20132013 \n\n \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nWorld Bank \nUnited States Agency for \nInternational Development \nOthersa \n \n \n\nTotal \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n400 \n150 \n400 \n\n300 \n1,250 \n\nPercentage \n32 \n12 \n32 \n\n24 \n100 \n\na  Includes the Government\u2019s resources. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nThe  Government  plans  to  utilize  the  MFF  in  four  tranches.  With  regard  to \nthe  Tranche  1  Project  under  the  MFF,  the  financing  plan  will  involve  only \nADB at this stage. It will amount to $60 million, of which $45 million will be \nfor  supplementary  financing  for  civil  works  and  $2  million  on  initial  project \nmanagement work relating to existing projects. About $13 million will be in \nthe  form  of  contingencies.  The  subsequent  tranches  will  be  for  around \n$100  million  each,  except  the  fourth,  which  is  estimated  at  $140  million. \nADB will seek cofinancing from third parties for these tranches. This work is \nunderway. \n \nFinancing  under  the  MFF  will  be  made  available  in  tranches  from  ADF \nresources.  The  maximum  amount  of  financing  extended  over  the  MFF \nperiod will be $400 million. However, this comes with some caveats. First, \nthe  actual  final  amount  made  available  will  be  subject  to  the  size  of  the \nADF envelope. The latter has been agreed for the next three years (2008\u2013\n2010),  and  includes  the  last  installment  under  the  ADF  IX  period  (2008) \nand the funding agreed for 2009\u20132010 under ADF X. Thereafter, and at the \nADF X mid-term review stage planned for 2010, there will be consultations \nbetween  ADB  and  ADF  donors  regarding  the  application,  or  otherwise,  of \nthe  performance  based  allocation  formula.  The  Government  understands \nthat the ADB commitment is limited and contingent upon the availability of \nfunds. Although neither ADB nor the Government would be under any legal \nobligation  to  grant  or  receive  funding,  the  so-called  \u201cmoral  hazard\u201d  has \nbeen  taken  out  of  the  equation  during  the  MFF  negotiations.  Second, \nalthough, the first tranche financing will be extended on a grant basis, ADB \ncannot  commit  to  retaining  these  terms  and  conditions  during  the \navailability period of the MFF. \n \nAfghanistan will submit a periodic financing request (PFR) for each tranche, \nwhich will be reviewed by ADB in accordance with the framework financing \n\n \nMFF Terms \n\n \n\n\f \n\nvi \n \n\n \nPeriod of \nUtilization \n\n \nExecuting \nAgency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\nagreement  (FFA)  between  ADB  and  the  Government.  Specific  terms  of \neach tranche will be based on the related PFR. The first PFR is presented \nto ADB\u2019s Board of Directors, together with the MFF proposal and the FFA. \n \nThe  last  date  on  which  disbursements  under  individual  tranches  can  be \nmade  is  31  December  2017.  The  last  PFR  has  to  be  submitted  no  later \nthan 30 September 2012. The MFF for the Investment Program will lapse if \nthe  legal  agreement  for  the  first  tranche  is  not  executed  within  2  months \nfrom the date of the Management approval for execution of the agreement. \n \nMinistry of Public Works \n\n \nThe establishment of an efficient organizational structure, the appointment \nof  experienced  personnel  to  it,  close  teamwork  and  sound  lines  of \ncommunication  between  MPW  and  ADB,  are  crucial  to  ensure  the  MFF \ngets  implemented  well  and  on  time.  The  most  critical  of  the  challenges  is \nthe limited supply of qualified national and international staff. This is partly \ndue  to  the  growing  demand  in  and  outside  Afghanistan,  as  well  as  to \nsecurity induced migration. Achieving impact and outcome, and before that, \ncontract award and disbursements, will depend on these factors.  \n \nADB  has  prepared  an  implementation  plan  for  the  MFF  and  agreed  with \nMPW  a  series  of  measures,  including  the  creation  of  the  PMO  within  its \nstructures.  The  PMO  will  be  managed  by  a  director  with  experience  in \nproject  management.  It  will  have  separate  teams  to  oversee  different \naspects of the MFF and liaise with stakeholders. These teams will oversee \ntechnical and engineering functions under each contract, legal matters, due \nfinance  and  administration, \ndiligence  on  new  projects,  safeguards, \nevaluation,  monitoring  and  reporting,  and  results  measurement  and \ncapacity  development  (training,  policy  advisory,  management  information \nsystems  and  procedures).  The  PMO  will  engage  the  services  of  national \nand  international  staff.  The  budget  to  run  it  will  cater  for  a  core  team  of \nexperts  and  then  leave  sufficient  contingencies  to  engage  short-term \nadvisors to undertake specific jobs at short notice. The services of advisors \nwill be secured from firms and directly from individuals. \n \nThe  PMO  will  establish  a  management  information  system  and  operate \nwithin  the  framework  of  the  implementation  plan  included  with  the  MFF. \nIt  will  become  the  main  point  of  contact  for  the  ADB  team  providing \noversight and guidance on implementation work. ADB itself has revamped \nits  field  presence  with  the  appointment  of  operational  and  implementation \nexperts (covering each of the priority sectors included in the CPS). These \nindividuals  will  become  focal  points  for  the  MFF.  The  ADB  team  will \nmaintain daily communications with the PMO (see Figure A7.2 of Appendix \n7).  It  will  hold  weekly  meetings  with  the  PMO  team  to  review  the \nimplementation  schedule  (contract  awards,  disbursements,  payments, \nphysical completion, safeguards, etc.) under each project funded under the \nMFF.  Any  deviations  from  the  original  schedule  will  be  discussed  at  the \nmeetings, and the management consultants will prepare and provide briefs \n \n\n\f \n\nvii\n\nto all parties on the actions taken or needed to be taken by the team. The \nADB team will hold monthly meetings with the deputy minister (Technical) \nof  MPW  and,  if  necessary,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  officials  to  review \nmonthly progress, and share the meeting brief with all team members. \n \nThe joint ADB and MPW team will also ensure the expeditious preparation \nand  approval  of  future  tranches  by  performing  continuous  due  diligence \nfrom the outset. Additionally, the joint team will conduct biannual reviews of \ntranches  and  the  MFF  in  March  and  October  of  each  year,  and  closely \nmonitor  the  engagement  and  conduct  of  independent  financial  audits  of \nproject  accounts,  as  well  as  of  procurement  and  operability  audits. \nA  MFF  administration  memorandum  has  been  drafted  and  shown  in \nSupplementary Appendix A. \n \nWith the assistance of the PMO, MPW will analyze and report on baseline \ndata  collected  during  consultations  with  stakeholders,  field  observations, \nand  measurements  within  6  months  of  the  start  of  every  works  contract. \nThereafter,  the  PMO  will  collect  and  analyze  data  annually  during \nimplementation, then submit the results and details of actions taken as part \nof its annual report to ADB. The PMO will also perform a complete analysis \nof  related  primary  and  secondary  data  at  the  end  of  each  tranche,  and \ninclude  the  results  in  the  recipient\u2019s  project  completion  report  to  ADB. \nThe PMO will set up a small results measurement function. This work may \nbe outsourced to a research institute, firm or individuals. The Central Asia \nRegional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) program is planning work in this \narea  with  Belgian  university  team,  leaders  in  the  field  of  infrastructure \nproject impact evaluation.  \n \nGoods  and  works  will  be  procured  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Advisory services for project \nmanagement, institutional reform, due diligence for new tranches, evaluation, \nmonitoring,  reporting,  results  measurement  of  the  MFF  and  individual \ntranches,  design  work,  and  capacity  building  as  a  whole,  will  be  procured \naccording to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom  time  to  time).  These  procedures  have  been  agreed  between  ADB  and \nMPW,  and  are  outlined  in  the  procurement  plan  given  in  Appendix  8. \nAfghanistan  acknowledges  and  agrees  that  any  violation  of  these  ADB \nguidelines in any project will constitute a ground for cancellation of the MFF. \n \nSpecial  Procurement  Condition.  Projects  will  be  located  in  areas  where \ncountries  that  are  not  ADB  members  could  provide  materials  at  highly \ncompetitive prices. Explicit procurement restrictions may preclude civil works \nand  maintenance  contractors  from  seeking  the  best  business  terms  from \nsuppliers  in  these  countries  and  submitting  competitive  bids.  To  keep  the \nprogram  costs  to  a  minimum,  it  is  proposed  that  civil  works  contractors \nfinanced  from  the  MFF  be  allowed  to  procure  bitumen  from  any  country, \nincluding  from  the  countries  that  are  not  ADB  members,  strictly  for  use  in \nprojects. This special condition was approved by the Board for four previous \nprojects  in  Afghanistan.  ADB  and  MPW,  through  routine  reviews  and \nprocurement  audits,  will  ensure  strict  adherence  by  the  contractors  to  this \nspecial condition. \n\n \nMonitoring, \nEvaluation, \nReporting, and \nMeasurement of \nResults \n \n \n\n \nProcurement of \nGoods, Works, \nand Services \n\n \n\n\f \n\nviii \n \n\nAdvance \nProcurement \nand Retroactive \nFinancing \n\n \nBenefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \n\n \nMPW  will  initiate  advance  contracting  under  each  tranche  before  signing \nthe  related  financing  agreements.  In  such  cases,  the  procurement \nprocedures,  including  advertising,  shall  be  in  accordance  with  the  ADB \nguidelines  in  order  for  the  eventual  contracts  to  be  eligible  for  ADB \nfinancing, and ADB shall review the process  used.  Expenditure  on  one  or \nmore  components  of  a  project  under  an  individual  tranche  incurred  in \naccordance with agreed procedures, and during the 12 months before the \nsigning  of  the  corresponding  agreement,  will  be  eligible  for  retroactive \nfinancing  up  to  20%  of  the  amount  of  that  financing.  This  approval, \nhowever,  does  not  commit  ADB  to  subsequently  approve  and  finance  a \nparticular project. ADB cost sharing and expenditure eligibility rules need to \nbe followed. \n \nThe  advantages  and  results  expected  from  the  Investment  Program  and \nADB financing are shown in the DMF. The Investment Program will expand \nthe country\u2019s road network and maintain existing roads\u2014leading to greater \ncoverage and quality. It will also improve the efficiency of institutions in the \nsector  and  train  staff\u2014to  improve  planning,  management,  and  fiduciary \noversight. A new national agency will be set up to oversee the development \nof the road network (Afghanistan Highway Authority, AHA). \n \nThe Investment Program outputs will help  cut  costs  of  travelling  and  save \nmoney  on  vehicle  repairs  and  energy  consumption.  That  will  lead  to \nincreased  trade  and  business  opportunities:  various  services,  farming, \nmanufacturing,  food  processing,  distribution/logistics,  wholesaling  and \nretailing.  Better  connectivity  will  benefit  health  and  education  services. \nCommunity  related  projects  along  the  routes  will  have  a  direct  positive \nimpact  on  women  and  children.  The  private  sector  will  benefit  from  the \nInvestment  Program,  including  from  the  creation  of  civil  works  and \nmaintenance contracts. This will generate fixed and temporary jobs. \n \nThere  is  an  ongoing  HIV/AIDS  awareness  campaign  financed  under \nprevious ADB financed projects. These will remain in place to ensure that \nthe impacts are minimized at each of the sites along various roads. Safety \nmeasures  will  be \nthe  design, \nin \nconstruction,  and  later  at  the  operational  stage.  Traffic  management \nsystems will be a responsibility of MPW and the security/police forces. \n \nThe  provincial  reconstruction  teams  attached  to  the  international  security \nforces have increased surveillance on national and regional roads, to deter \ndrug and people trafficking. \n \nSecurity  is  the  main  risk.  Awarding  contracts  at  a  reasonable  price  is \nalready  difficult,  but  carrying  out  civil  works  is  more  complicated  in  the \ncurrent  security  environment.  Delays  to  civil  works  contracts  have  been  a \ncommon  feature  of  ADB  and  other  donor-backed  road  projects  in \nAfghanistan.  Better  project  management,  more  community  buy-in  and \nsmarter  phasing  of  particular  sections  (against  the  financing)  will  improve \nschedules and cut cost overruns. But security can derail good work at short \nnotice. This falls outside the direct ADB and MPW domain. The small scale \ncommunity  investments  should  cut  the  number  of  disruptions  to \n\ninvestments\u2014at \n\nincorporated \n\nthe \n\n\f \n\nix\n\nInvestment  Program  will \n\ncontractors. But beyond this, success will be a function of overall security \ncover, and it is assumed that the proposed increase in international forces \nwill help curtail and eventually lessen this risk. \n \nThe  Investment  Program  needs  good  institutions  and  strong  management \nand  governance.  Good  planning,  best  practice  concepts,  sound  project \nmanagement,  fiduciary  oversight  and  transparent  bidding  and  contract \nmanagement  processes  require  not  only  experienced  personnel,  but  also \nefficient and effective systems/procedures and controls. On the institutional \nfront, considerable hope is placed on establishment of the AHA. It will take \nover the management of the road network. \n \nThis also requires leaders. But, not all is well in Afghanistan at all times on \nthese fronts. Good and experienced people often leave MPW after training \nand  the  new  ones  are  not  always  ready  to  take  on  project  management \nresponsibilities.  The \nintroduce  better \norganizational structures, greater staff continuity, including among advisors. \nBut staff turnover will likely remain high. This implies a high level of hand-\nholding.  Governance  and  fiduciary  controls  need  strengthening.  The  MFF \nwill provide assistance in these areas. The loan agreements will also make \nspecific  references  to  corruption  and  misprocurement.  These  will  be  \u201cdeal \nbreakers\u201d  and  lead  to  the  immediate  suspension  of  ADB  financing. \nAdherence to policy and procedures represent other filters.  \n \nCapacity building will thus be crucial and the only solution in the long term, \nto  getting  things  done  well  and  on  time.  In  the  short  term,  intensive  and \ndirect help will need to be a feature of ADB\u2019s work. The quality of this work \nwill  also  be  a  function  of  the  quality  of  the  advisors  that  ADB  finances. \nNeither  ADB  nor  most  of  other  development  partners  have  been \noverwhelmingly  successful  on  this  front  in  Afghanistan.  Two-year  tours  of \nduty by consultants and staff are too short in most places, but especially so \nin Afghanistan. This happens even at the resident mission level. \n \nAnother risk is financing. ADB will provide the necessary funding for capital \nexpenditure. But in the long run, the main issue is maintenance and repair. \nThis  needs  a  recurrent  budget  allocation.  Budget  allocations  in  the  past \nhave been haphazard. The fiscal policy has been in disarray lately, with tax \ncollection down on expectations. A \u201croad fund\u201d might be part of the solution, \nbut  even  this  requires  seed  capital.  The  matter  requires  attention  and  will \nbe  provided  through  the  PMO.  It  is  not  far-fetched  to  expect  some  of  the \ndonor  funding  to  be  brought  into  the  national  budget,  for  this  to  be  made \navailable for priority investment programs under ANDS. At present, only a \nfew donors operate through the budget. ADB is one of them. \n \nA reversal of the strategy and the policy framework by the  Government  is \nalso a risk. The former is less likely to happen than the latter. In the latter\u2019s \ncase,  the  aim  is  to  maintain  a  close  eye  on  the  principles  and  to  call  for \nadditional  refinements  over  the  MFF  financing  period.  The  Government  is \nwilling to receive advice in this area.  \n\n \n\n\f64  00'Eo\n\n72  00'Eo\n\nAFGHANISTAN\nROAD NETWORK DEVELOPMENT\nINVESTMENT PROGRAM\n\nUZBEKISTAN\n\nTAJIKISTAN\n\nIslam Qala\n\nHerat\n\nHERAT\n\nI R A N\n\nShindand\n\nTURKMENISTAN\n\nKeleft\nJOWZJAN\n\nHairatan\n\nFaizabad\n\nBalkh\n\nKholm\n\nKUNDUZ\n\nTAKHAR\n\nBADAKHSHAN\n\nMazar-e-Sharif\n\nBALKH\n\nKunduz\n\nTaloqan\n\nEshkashem\n\nAndkhoi\n\nSheberghan\n\nSar-e-Pul\n\nMaimana\nFARYAB\n\nSAR-E-PUL\n\nBADGHIS\n\nQala-i-Naw\n\nChaghcharan\n\nGHOR\n\nKhadir\n\nDAIKONDI\n\nSamangan\n\nSAMANGAN\n\nBaghlan\nPul-e-Khumri\n\nBAGHLAN\n\nBAMYAN\nBamyan\n\nPANJSHIR\nBazarak\nMahmood-e-Raqi\nKAPISA\n\nLAGHMAN\nMehtar Lam\n\nNURISTAN\n\nKamdish\n\nKONAR\n\nAsadabad\n\nDoshi\n\nCharikar\n\nPARWAN\n\nKABUL\n\nWARDAK\nMaidanshahr\n\nKABUL\n\nPul-e-Alam\n\nNANGARHAR\n\nJalalabad\n\nTorkham\n\nGhazni\n\nGHAZNI\n\nLOGAR\n\nPAKTIA\nGardez\n\nKHOST\n\nKhost\n\nSharan\n\nPAKTIKA\n\nFarah\n\nFARAH\n\nDelaram\n\nLashkar Gah\n\nORUZGAN\n\nTarin Kot\n\nMukur\n\nZABOL\n\nQalat\n\nKandahar\n\nZaranj\n\nNIMRUZ\n\nKudbar\n\nHELMAND\n\nKANDAHAR\n\nLanday\n\nPAKISTAN\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\nN\n\nKilometers\n\nNational Capital\n\nProvincial Capital\n\nCity/Town\n\nAirport\n\nRegional Road\n\nADB--Financed National Road\n\nADB--Finance Regional Road\n\nProposed National Road\n\nNational Road (unpaved)\n\nOther Road\n\nRiver\n\nProvincial Boundary\n\nInternational Boundary\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\nPEOPLE'S\nREPUBLIC\nOF\nCHINA\n\n36  00'No\n\n32  00'No\n\n64  00'Eo\n\n72  00'Eo\n\n36  00'No\n\n32  00'No\n\n0\n8\n-\n2\n1\n6\n3\n \nH\nR\n\n\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for the Road \nNetwork  Development  Investment  Program  (the  Investment  Program).  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework for the Investment Program and the MFF is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nThe Afghanistan National Development Strategy (ANDS), launched by the Government \nin  April  2008,  is  the  country\u2019s  main  strategic  platform  for  development  over  the  2008\u20132020 \nperiod. Its aim is to promote growth, generate wealth, and cut poverty and vulnerability. ANDS \ngoes across all key sectors and subsectors. It also embraces several themes. One of the main \nsectors is transport and logistics. In this regard, the strategy sets out quantitative and qualitative \ntargets  (physical  and  nonphysical)  and  covers  various  systems,  including  roads  and  railways. \nWithin  the  road  subsector,  the  strategy  caters  for  regional/national,  provincial,  rural  and  city \nnetworks, and emphasizes the construction of new assets and the management, maintenance \nand  repair  of  existing  ones.  The  underlying  objective  is  to  improve  connectivity  (within  the \ncountry  and  with  neighboring  borders),  improve  efficiency  and  safety  of  travel  and  goods \ntransport,  and  strengthen  institutions.  Within  the  roads  arena,  the  regional  and  national  roads \ntake priority over the others, at least in the short to medium term (next 7 years). The country\u2019s \nroad network, excluding city roads, spans 34,000 kilometers (km).1 \n \nThe  management  of  the  road  network  rests  with  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works  (MPW), \n3. \nwhich  has  a  workforce  of  about  900  engineers  and  technical  staff  plus  2,000  employees.  \nAt  present,  however,  it  acts  as  the  executor  of  development  projects  financed  by  multilateral \nbanks  and  bilateral  agencies.  In  the  case  of  government-financed  road  development  works, \nwhich  are  limited  to  rural  and  local  roads,  MPW  procures  construction  and  periodic \nmaintenance  works  from  private  firms  through  competitive  bidding.  Routine  maintenance  is \nexecuted  by  its  regional  offices  using  their  own  personnel  and  equipment.  A  detailed \nassessment of the transport sector is given in Appendix 2. \n \n4. \nThe roads network is in bad shape. By October 2001, this network built originally in the \n1960s and 1970s had dilapidated through neglect, with only 10% being in good condition. Since \nthen,  donors  have  provided  over  $3  billion  towards  their  repair  and  expansion.  By  the  end  of \n2007, however, improvement works had either been completed or were ongoing on about 3,200 \nkm  of  regional  roads,  1,900  km  of  national  roads,  and  6,000  km  of  rural  roads.  These  works \nrestored basic mobility in many parts of the country. Donors have tended to specialize in terms \nof geographic coverage and type of network. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has, thus far, \nfinanced  the  improvement  of  nearly  1,100  km  of  regional  and  national  roads  (since  2004), \nmostly  in  north  and  northwest  parts  of  the  country.  ADB\u2019s  investment  amounts  to  over  $600 \nmillion (as of October 2008). The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) \nand the World Bank are other large players in the sector. USAID, with a longer track record in \nthe south, has had a preference for provincial roads. It  started  a  new  $400  million  program  in \nthis area in 2007, targeting 1,800 km. The World Bank has been funding both regional and rural \nroads. It is currently spending $112 million in upgrading 3,000 km of rural roads. The European \n\n                                                 \n1  Comprised of 3,200 km of regional roads, 4,900 km of national roads, 9,700 km of provincial roads, 17,000 km of \n\nrural roads, and about 200 major bridges. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fUnion  has  been  financing  an  experimental  performance-based  maintenance  contract  on  the \nKabul to Jalalabad road. The Japan Bank for International Cooperation has been helping MPW \nimprove  the  management  and  use  of  road  maintenance  equipment.  Canada  is  cofinancing  a \nproject in Kandahar. \n \n5. \nThe  national  construction  industry  has  evolved  over  the  past  3  years.  All  works  in \nUSAID\u2019s  provincial  road  improvement  program  and  performance-based  maintenance  works  in \nthe  future  will  be  procured  from  national  contractors.  The  United  Nations  Office  for  Project \nServices  is  engaging  national  contractors  almost  exclusively  on  projects  they  undertake  on \nbehalf of donors, and also use the services about half the engineers and technical staff of MPW. \nThat  agency  is  presently  training  these  engineers  in  procedures  and  road  construction  tools, \nwhich would be useful for MPW upon their return  to  the  ministry.  Donors  supporting  rural  and \ndistrict  level  programs  are  also  now  procuring  works  from  national  contractors,  and  the \ninternational contractors are collaborating more with national contractors. \n \nB. \n\nKey Problems and Opportunities \n\nAs  shown  in  the  problem  tree  analysis  depicted  in  Figure  A2  of  Appendix  2,  the \n6. \nperformance of the road network is constrained by technical, operational, financing, regulatory, \nand institutional deficiencies. These may be categorized as physical and nonphysical in nature. \nCombined, they lead to an inefficient, incomplete, unsafe and poor quality road network. These \nproblems can be fixed over time through targeted investments. \n \n\n1. \n\nAssets\u2014Physical Aspects \n\nNetwork coverage is limited. The existing road network is incomplete. This means that \n7. \nvarious  parts  of  the  country  are  poorly  connected  or  not  connected  at  all.  Four  provincial \ncapitals  remain  unconnected  to  the  regional  network.  This  delinks  them  from  domestic  and \nregional  markets.  The  coverage  gap  affects  connectivity,  which  in  turn  cuts  trade  and \ninvestment  opportunities,  increases  the  cost  of  doing  business  and  reduces  the  country\u2019s \ncompetitiveness  and  job  creation  capabilities.  Table  A3.1  in  Appendix  3  shows  the  most \nimportant gaps in the national roads network. \n \n8. \nQuality  of  existing  network  is  poor.  Before  2001,  investment  in  road  reconstruction \nand maintenance was negligible. This has increased somewhat since then, although only 7% of \nthe  total  road  length  is  paved  as  of  today.  About  70%  of  the  inter-provincial  and  inter-district \nroads  are  in  a  poor  state  of  repair,  in  many  cases  impassable  during  the  winter  months.  \nThe  investment  requirements  to  improve  the  network  are  high.  Over  the  long  term,  these  run \ninto  billions  of  dollars.  In  the  medium  term  the  estimate  is  about  $1.7  billion  in  the  case  of \nnational roads (3,000 km) and $1 billion in the case of provincial and rural roads (17,000 km). \n \n\n2. \n\nNonphysical Problems and Opportunities \n\n9. \nInstitutional  gaps  are  rising. MPW cannot cope with the Investment Program without \nassistance.  A  good  organizational  structure  and  sound  planning  are  essential  to  ensure \nefficiency,  competition,  quality,  and  governance.  Therefore,  the  major  financiers  of  roads \nwelcome  the  Government\u2019s  proposal  to  establish  the  Afghanistan  Highway  Authority  (AHA), \nwhich will take over the administration of all roads in the country. But, this will take time to get \noff  the  ground.  The  work  plan  to  take  over  the  network  will  have  to  be  phased.  The  AHA \nrequires qualified staff and sufficient financial resources to perform on its mandate.  \n \n10. \nLack of Financing. The road subsector requires a stable and predictable financing plan \nand  financing  flows.  This  plan  needs  to  distinguish  better  between  capital  and  recurrent \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nfragmented  and  weak.  This  makes \n\nexpenditures,  especially  in  the  case  of  maintenance  support.  A  road  fund  is  required,  but  the \nGovernment does not have the necessary resources in the short term to put it together. Seed \ncapital could be provided through donor finance. But this means calling on donors to put more \nresources  through  the  budget.  Further,  not  all  donors  include  infrastructure  in  their  business \nstrategies. The result is that the availability of financing will likely remain a binding constraint. \n \n11. \nHuman  Resources.  MPW,  at  present,  has  a  weak  team  and  inadequate  project \nmanagement skills, systems, and procedures. It has talented staff in place, but the numbers are \nnot  enough  to  cope  with  the  job  at  hand.  The  skills  mix  is  also  weak.  It  lacks  engineers  and \nproject managers. Recruiting advisors from within and outside the country is also a challenge.  \nIn the meantime, the workload will be increasing, particularly if all the networks are included\u2014\nnational, provincial, rural, and city based. \n \nFew Contractors, Engineers, and Materials Suppliers. The local construction industry \n12. \nis \nsubcontracting  difficult  and  unreliable.  \nThe  engineering  industry  is  in  bad  shape.  Few  companies  have  the  resources  to  tackle  large \ncontracts  and  even  fewer  have  alliances  with  international  groups  willing  and  able  to  do  the \nwork. Several contracts have had to combine design and construction. Although this works well \nunder strong institutions, in Afghanistan it has led to unnecessary changes in scope, technical \nspecifications, and dimensioning. There have been frequent and not always warranted contract \nvariation  requests.  Finally,  Afghanistan  does  not  have  all  the  materials  necessary  for  road \nconstruction. This has forced contractors to enter the international market. Bitumen remains the \nmain  problem.  In  the  case  of  ADB  projects,  this  has  meant  a  special  waiver  to  non  member \ncountry procurement rules.  \n \n13.  Weak  Governance.  MPW  has  weak  financial  management  and  fiduciary  oversight \nsystems  and  procedures.  The  flow  of  information  is  slow  and  accountability  is  not  strictly \nenforced.  There  are  also  gaps  in  the  overall  auditing  and  business  process.  Planning  and \nprogramming  is  ad  hoc,  contracting  methods  are  archaic,  and  contract  administration  is \nirregular and inadequate. \n \n14. \nSecurity. The Government has found it difficult to attract international contractors to lead \ncivil works contracts. Most bids attract less than 3 bidders. In many cases, this leads to inflated \nprices. The average cost of constructing one kilometer of new two-lane road with 3.5-meter (m) \nlanes  and  1.5  m  shoulders  rose  from  $371,000  per  kilometer  in  mid  2006  to  $534,000  in \nNovember 2007. The corresponding average cost of rehabilitating (milling the old pavement and \nresurfacing) one kilometer of new two-lane road with 3.5 m lanes and 1.5 m shoulders rose from \n$251,000/km  in  2004  to  $287,000  in  March  2007.  USAID  has  experienced  an  even  larger \nincrease \nto  \n$1  million/km  in  2007,  and  the  cost  of  provincial  roads  increased  from  $53,000/km  in  2004  to \n$186,000/km in 2007. Not all high costs are because of insecurity. Some cost increases are a \nresult  of  the  rising  material  prices,2 weak  oversight,  increasing  risk  of  implementation  delays, \nand  lack  of  competition  due  to  the  small  pool  of  contractors  willing  and  able  to  work  in  the \nprevailing  conditions.  Such  conditions  will  be  accounted  for  in  cost  estimates,  schedules, \ncontracts,  and  monitoring  frameworks  of  the  projects  under  the  MFF.  Another  reason  for  the \ncost  increases  is  the  threat  of  insurgent  attacks.  This  brings  the  need  to  introduce  more \nflexibility to the programming of road works. If critical infrastructure is damaged in the ongoing \nconflict  or  a  sudden  need  arises  to  provide  access  to  strategically  important  areas,  the  MFF \n\nthe  cost  of  national \n\nfrom  $326,000/km \n\nin  2004 \n\nroads, \n\nrising \n\nin \n\n                                                 \n2  Material  prices  in  the  region  increased  on  average  by  35\u201345%  between  2004  and  2007,  with  cement  price \n\nincreasing by 200%, and fuel and bitumen prices by 100% and 60%, respectively. \n\n \n\n\foffers  flexibility  to  respond  to  those  needs,  even  if  those  works  had  not  originally  been \nprogrammed.  There  is  also  a  need  to  involve  communities  more  closely  and  earlier  in  the \nplanning  and  project  design  process.  Financing  basic  and  small  scale  infrastructure  will  also \nhelp with community buy-in. This is envisaged under the Investment Program. \n \n\n3. \n\nLessons \n\n15. \nThree key lessons can be drawn from ADB\u2019s experience in the road subsector: project \ncosts have been underestimated, procurement of works and services have been slow and non- \ncompetitive,  and  stakeholder  consultation  has  been  weak.  Unstable  Government  cofinancing \nand poor project management have also been recurrent problems.  \n \n16.  Most  projects  in  the  sector  have  suffered  from  underestimated  capital  and  recurrent \ncosts.  This  problem  has  been  further  exacerbated  by  fast  rising  prices  for  materials,  security \nand services, as well as by unnecessary changes in scope (higher technical specifications and \nsize).  Under  this  scenario,  MPW  has  been  unable  to  finance  the  overruns,  leading  to  long \ndelays  and  in  some  cases  to  actual  contractual  disputes.  This  problem  has  been  further \naggravated  by  the  approval  of  large  individual  financing  facilities  at  a  time.  This  is  often \nnecessary  in  order  for  Afghanistan  not  to  forego  annual  grant  allocations  under  concessional \nfinancing  windows.  Basically,  the  issue  is  that  financing  needs  to  be  better  linked  to  the \nreadiness of one or two road sections rather than to an amalgam of sections at a time. But this \napproach  requires  a  smarter  \u201ccash  management\u201d  plan  for  concessional  finance.  The  use  of \nseparate MFFs for each of the Afghanistan country partnership strategy (CPS) priority sectors \nwill provide the opportunity to allocate the annual funding envelope between smaller projects (or \nsections  of  projects)  in  each  sector,  thus  marrying  much  closely  financing  to  specific \nsubprojects\u2019 readiness. This is the approach being taken in Afghanistan. The implication of this \nis that instead of using the Asian Development Fund (ADF) envelope for one single project in a \ngiven year, ADB will put together MFF programs in each of the main sectors covered under the \nCPS,  and  then  commit  every  year  specific  amounts  of  finance  to  each  sector,  up  to  the \nmaximum amount allowed every year under ADF X. The tranching approach within each sector \nwill  allow  costs  to  be  estimated  in  real  time  (or  re-estimated)  before  the  financing  for  each \ntranche  is  formally  approved.  Working  on  design  work  upfront  (before  financing  is  closed)  will \nhelp further in this area.  \n \n17. \nProcurement of works for design-build has been done mostly on the basis of quantities \nestimated from preliminary designs. This has required substantial variations in scope and scale \nof  works.  The  consulting  firms  recruited  according  to  quality  and  cost  have  been  unable  to \nreplace key specialists, who had left the positions on short notice due to the increasing violence. \nAnother  complication  has  been  the  lack  of  contractors  interest  in  civil  works  contracts.  More \noften than not, in the case of roads at least, most bids have attracted only one bidder. There is \nan  urgent  need  to  promote  road  works  opportunities  among  the  international  community.  In \nsome  cases,  it  might  even  be  necessary  for  countries  to  consider  giving  extra  incentives  to \ncontractors to take part in the reconstruction effort. With regard to the MFF, ADB will undertake \na detailed review of prices during implementation. Quantities will be based on detailed designs \nprepared by recognized firms. Additionally, bigger contingencies will be provided in the budgets \nto accommodate unexpected price changes. \n \n18. \nStakeholder  consultation,  especially  with  local  communities,  has  been  inadequate.  \nThe result is that some have not \u201cbought into\u201d the projects or welcomed foreign contractors. It is \nnot  easy  to  carry  out  consultations  in  advance,  mainly  on  account  of  security  concerns. \nHowever, there is no doubt that this has become an issue affecting implementation and ultimate \nsuccess  of  projects.  These  factors  have  been  taken  into  consideration  in  designing  the \n\n4 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nproposed  MFF.  Specifically,  the  MFF  includes  a  community  infrastructure  development \ncomponent,  which  will  be  implemented  simultaneously  with  road  works\u2014to  allow  people  to \nbenefit from the improved access at the local level. The consultation process for the subsequent \ntranches will be done with finance provided under the previous tranches. Security cover will be \nprovided by the Government, and as appropriate by the contractors. \n \n19. \nNone  of  the  road  projects  have  been  fully  evaluated.  But  even  in  the  absence  of \nindependent reviews, it is possible to conclude that the performance on them is unsatisfactory. \nContract awards and disbursements are low and there have been constant changes in scope, \ndriven  either  by  poor  design  and  supervision  or  by  rising  price  escalations.  The  low  level  of \ncontrols  by  the  Government  over  contractor  requests  to  endorse  changes  in  scope  is  also \nworrisome.  Another  lesson  is  that  ADB  itself  can,  and  should,  do  more  on  the  ground.  \nThe  Resident  Mission  is  being  restructured.  By  the  end  of  2008,  the  bulk  of  the  team  would \nhave changed and new project execution skills added. Finally, the treatment of themes such as \ngender, mainstreaming, safeguards, capacity, and private sector development needs rethinking. \nThe same applies to institutional effectiveness and reforms. With a programmatic MFF financing \napproach  it  will  be  possible  to  cater  today  for  the  expertise  needed  to  handle  work  on  key \nthemes  tomorrow.  The  establishment  of  program  management  structures  and  teams  will  go  a \nlong way to tackling some of these shortcomings. \n \n\n4. \n\nRationale for a Multitranche Financing Facility  \n\nfor  watch  over \n\ntime  and  resources \n\nthe  main  analytical  work,  releasing \n\n20. \nThe  Government  has  requested  ADB  to  provide  up  to  $400  million  to  help  finance  the \nInvestment Program through an MFF. Its utilization will be up to 2017. The MFF is justified on \nseveral  grounds.  In  this  case,  it  is  considered  superior  to  other  modalities  on  offer.  First,  the \nInvestment  Program  fits  neatly  within  the  strategic  framework  that  ADB  has  agreed  with \nAfghanistan. The main elements of the country strategy have been agreed with the authorities, \nand  are  aligned  to  the  ANDS  as  well  as  ADB\u2019s  strategic  platform.  Second,  the  MFF  brings \nupfront \nthe \nimplementation.  To  generate  impacts  and  outcome,  the  Investment  Program  requires  better \ninstitutional  effectiveness,  but  also  contract  awards  and  disbursements.  The  MFF  provides  a \ngood  platform  for  establishing  a  program  management  office  (PMO)  with  core  expertise  in \nproject  management  and  thematic  coverage,  and  a  platform  from  which  to  refocus  ADB \nresources and skill mix in the field. The MFF allows parties to plan ahead and engage experts \nduring  the  long  haul,  giving  continuity  in  a  climate  of  high  domestic  staff  turnover.  Third,  the \nMFF  helps  the  country  team  to  plan  ahead  and  manage  the  ADF  envelope  in  an  effective \nmanner. Under the CPS business plan, ADB will work simultaneously in four areas\u2014transport, \nenergy, irrigation, and reforms. The intention is to have the first three areas supported through \nMFFs  and  cluster  programs  in  the  case  of  the  fourth.  This  approach  will  allow  the  country  to \ndraw finance from umbrella facilities in line with project readiness. This not only improves ADF \n\u201ccash  management\u201d,  but  also  means  \u201cfresher\u201d  and  more  reliable  investment  cost  estimates  in \neach of the infrastructure sectors (which, as indicated, is a source of great concern in a rapidly \nchanging construction cost environment). Fourth, although not perfect, the main pre-conditions \nfor  the  use  of  the  MFF  are  in  place:  road  map,  policy  framework,  investment  program  and \nfinancing  plan.  The  policy  framework  is  adequate,  although  it  is  the  weakest  of  the  four  pre-\nconditions for the MFF.3 The Government has agreed basic principles (including cost recovery, \nmaintenance  and  repair,  and  funding  thereof,  adherence  to  best  practice  on  construction  and \nsafeguards,  better  governance,  competition  and  institutional  restructuring),  but  more  specifics \nand refinements are needed over time. These policy principles look fine on paper but the issue \n\n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2008. Mainstreaming the Multitranche Financing Facility. Manila. \n\n \n\n\fFrom  a  strategic  perspective,  roads  are  essential \n\nis  management  of  change,  as  and  when  needed.  A  program  loan  might  have  taken  care  of \nsome of the shortcomings. But, in the meantime, a bigger binding constraint is the lack of proper \ninfrastructure and qualified personnel. The  MFF  will  provide  finance  to  work  on  this,  recruiting \nadvisory  services  to  tighten  up  on  the  framework  itself  and  monitor  progress.  The  rest  of  the \nMFF pre-conditions are in better shape. \n \n21. \nto  Afghanistan\u2019s  economic \ndevelopment  for  at  least  three  reasons.  One,  the  challenging  terrain  and  the  scattered \ndistribution of the population make alternative modes of transport economically and technically \nnonviable.  Two,  as  a  landlocked  country,  its  roads  are  an  important  conduit  for  trade  with \nneighboring countries. Three, roads lead to national integration by enabling faster interprovincial \ntravel  and  trade.  To  this  end,  full  implementation  of  the  Investment  Program,  which  calls  for \nsequential  investments,  is  imperative.  However,  because  of  mounting  budget  difficulties  and \nrising construction costs, the Government, which depends on donor financing for all road works, \nhas  difficulty  in  sourcing  funds.  This  includes  obligations  under  ongoing  projects.  The  MFF \nprovides certainty (up to the funding made available under ADF X) and predictability. \n \n22.  More  than  40%  of  ADB  lending  to  Afghanistan,  thus  far,  has  been  for  transport \ndevelopment.4 Of this amount, over $600 million (about 25% of total donor financing for regional \nand national roads) went to improving around 1,000 km of roads (about 22% of all regional and \nnational roads improved during 2002\u20132007). The value of these roads for the economy can only \nbe sustained if other important links in the network are also improved, so that freight and people \ncan move seamlessly from one part of the country to another, as well as from/to the neighboring \ncountries. The sector strategy has this as a goal. \n \nADB has invested heavily in nonphysical aspects in the transport sector. It has provided \n23. \nextensive  capacity  development  and  training  assistance  to  MPW.  However,  the  capacity  gap \nremains  a  barrier  to  doing  things  well  and  on  time.  To  overcome  this  barrier,  the  MFF  will \nfinance  the  engagement  of  experts  upfront  and  for  longer  periods  of  time  to  do  the  following:  \n(i)  help  execute  individual  tranches;  (ii)  perform  due  diligence  on  future  investments;  \n(iii)  establish  evaluation,  monitoring,  and  reporting  mechanisms;  (iv)  manage  safeguards  and \ngovernance  matters  and  set  up  a  results  measurement  function;  (v)  carry  out  design  work \nupfront  to  get  better  estimates  of  construction  costs  before  procurement;  and  (vi)  support \nbroader  capacity  development,  including  planning,  institutional  reform,  policy  reviews,  and \ngovernance/fiduciary improvements. A PMO will be set up within MPW to run the entire set of \nactivities.  This  office  will  have  teams.  The  teams  will  have  qualified  staff  engaged  under  the \nMFF\u2014national  and  international.  It  will  become  the  direct  counterpart  for  the  ADB  team \nsupervising the execution of the investments under the MFF. ADB\u2019s resident mission  in  Kabul \nwill play a major role during the implementation of the MFF. This mission will be strengthened \nwith five new staff (with experience in project management and administration). Internal systems \nand procedures are also being improved. \n \n24. \nThe MFF allows for supplementary financing due to price changes. These price changes \nhave required the Government to award contracts, including contracts in two ongoing projects5 \n\n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2007.

Manila  (Loan  2140-AFG,  for  $100  million, \napproved on 15 December); ADB. 2006. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on \na Proposed Loan and Asian Development Fund Grant to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for the North\u2013South \nCorridor Project. Manila (Loan 2257-AFG, for $78.2 million; Grant 0054-AFG, for $40 million; and JFPR 9097-AFG, \nfor $20 million, approved on 26 September). \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nfinanced  by  ADB,  at  prices  higher  than  appraised  prices\u2014with  the  intent  of  financing  the  gap \nfrom  its  own  resources.  This  is  complicated  by  the  fact  that  the  Government  has  recently \nexperienced  a  large  drop  in  revenues.  Therefore,  the  provision  for  limited  supplementary \nfinancing, even on a retroactive basis, for purely price changes will expedite the completion of \nprojects  that  are  critical  for  sustaining  mobility.  These  projects  are  visible  and  encourage \ncommunity support for the reconstruction and rebuilding process. \n \n25. \nLast, but not least, the Investment Program has high regional content. The north-south \nand east-west trade corridors pass through Afghanistan. Despite the bad security situation, the \nrepaired and extended road networks have seen high traffic flows and thus have been making a \ndifference.  Passenger  and  cargo  traffic  has  been  on  the  rise  along  the  \u201cring  road\u201d,  including \ntraffic from Central Asia. Afghanistan plays a special role in the Central Asia Regional Economic \nCooperation  (CAREC)  program,  which  calls  for  investments  in  transport,  energy,  and  trade. \nRoads connect Afghanistan to the outside world, as well as cities, towns, and villages within the \ncountry.  Road  investments  made  from  the  MFF  will  be  visible  and  yield  results,  both  tangible \nand intangible. \n \n26. \n \n\nThe MFF meets the pre-conditions as elaborated in Appendix 3. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nRoad Map. ANDS comes with quantitative and qualitative targets and caters for \nnew assets, the rehabilitation of existing ones and institutional change. \nPolicy  Framework.  To  implement  the  strategy,  the  Government  has  adopted  a \npolicy framework. It states that Afghanistan will seek foreign assistance and use \nits own resources to build and maintain a network of roads that will provide good \naccess  from  one  part  of  the  country  to  another.  The  framework  outlines  steps \nneeded to operationalize the strategy and sustain its impacts. \nInvestment Program. The road development investment plan of the Government \nsets out its proposal for sustainable, road investment over the long, medium, and \nshort term. It is the largest program of road development planned by Afghanistan \nwith  significant  investments  in  physical  and  nonphysical  aspects  of  the  road \nsubsector. \nFinancing  Plan.  The  Government  has  prepared  preliminary  cost  estimates  and \nschedules,  and  identified  several  funding  sources  for  the  Investment  Program.  \nIt has set up a planning unit at MPW to revise and update these aspects, as and \nwhen new information and commitments are received from financiers. \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n27. \nThe  Investment  Program  is  an  integral  part  of  ANDS.  It  follows  a  thorough  analysis  of \nkey  problems,6 which  has  revealed  deficiencies  in  two  key  areas\u2014technical  and  operational \n(physical) and institutional and thematic (nonphysical). The two aspects (problems and results) \nare linked and were taken into account during the design of the MFF. \n \n28. \nUnder  the  Investment  Program,  the  road  network  will  expand  and  improve.  The \nInvestment Program will strengthen the mandate and work of the main institution responsible for \nthe  sector\u2014while  adhering  to  best  practice  approaches  on  themes  (gender,  capacity,  private \nsector  development,  environment,  and  safeguards).  All  physical  works  will  be  carried  out \n\n                                                 \n6  See problem tree in Figure A2 of Appendix 2. \n\n \n\n \n\n\faccording  to  the  standards  required  to  meet  international  and  national  safety  and  reliability \nstandards, and supervised and audited by professional engineers. \n \n29. \nThe improved and expanded road network will increase connectivity, raise intercity travel \nspeeds,  create  conditions  for  more  inter-city  freight  and  passengers  transport  services,  cut \noperating  costs,  develop  safer  roads,  thereby  allowing  people  and  goods  to  move  efficiently \nfrom one part of the country to another, and to neighboring countries. The Investment Program \nwill  benefit  the  economy  as  a  whole,  including  investment  and  job  creation  conditions  in  the \nregions  and  rural  areas.  Roads  will  also  contribute  indirectly  to  stability  and  security  in  the \nremote parts of the country. \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\nInvestment components under the Investment Program will be selected according to the \n30. \ncriteria  and  procedures  set  out  in  Appendix  4.  The  physical  outputs  of  these  investments  will \ninclude  (i)  400  km  of  improved  national  roads,  (ii)  1,500  km  of  regional  and  national  roads \nsystematically maintained for up to 5 years, and (iii) where necessary, ancillary and emergency \nworks  (on  about  200  km)  that  become  necessary  because  of  insurgency  and  natural  events. \nThe  investments  will  be  made  in  four  tranches  scheduled  for  the  period  of  2008\u20132011.  \nThe outputs of each tranche are described in para. 32. \n \nThe nonphysical outputs (qualitative in nature, although some proxies will be established \n31. \nover  the  Investment  Program  period)  include  (i)  better  planning  and  project  management \ncapabilities, (ii) regular budget and donor finance allocations towards maintenance and repair, \n(iii) the establishment of a new agency to oversee the road network, (iv) greater transparency \nand speed in the way contracts are awarded and handled, (v) full compliance with safeguards, \n(vi)  a  major  cut  in  the  number  of  project  and  contract  subject  to  changes  in  scope,  and  \n(vii) stricter fiduciary oversight. \n \n\n1. \n\nPhysical Components \n\na. \n\nInfrastructure\u2014New and Existing Assets \n\n32. \nInfrastructure  improvements  include  new  road  sections  (300  km)  and  the  repair, \nrehabilitation,  and  reconstruction  works  on  about  100  km.  Four  road  sections  have  been \ntentatively identified and three have been fully designed to be constructed under tranche 2, 3, \nand 4. These include the roads from Faizabad to Ishkashem (100 km), Jabul Saraj to Surobi (90 \nkm), Kabul to Jalalabad (alternative) road (160 km), and part of Darisuf to Yakawlang road (50 \nkm). Ongoing infrastructure improvements under ADB-financed projects whose costs have risen \ndue  to  purely  price  increases  or  a  change  in  the  financing  plan  will  also  be  included  in  this \ncomponent. The infrastructure improvement component under the Tranche 1 Project falls under \nthis  category  because  of  the  escalation  of  costs  in  (i)  Andkhoy\u2013Qaisar  Road  Project  (Loan \n2140-AFG),  and  (ii)  North-South  Corridor  Project  (Loan  2257-AFG/Grant  0054/JFPR  9097). \nDetails of these two projects and the proposed works are given in Appendix 5. \n \n\nb. \n\nAncillary and Emergency Works \n\nThe MFF includes a component for emergency works in the regional and national roads. \n33. \nThe  output  of  this  component  will  become  tangible  when  specific  conflict-induced  damages \noccur and/or a sudden requirement for access to strategically important areas or enhancements \nto network connectivity emerge. \n \n\nc. \n\nMaintenance \n\n34.  Maintenance  works,  both  routine  and  periodic,  on  approximately  1,500  km  of  regional \n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nand  national  roads  are  included  under  the  MFF.  Works  will  be  performed  by  the  selected \ncontractor(s) according to standards established by MPW for at least 3 continuous years. \n \n\n2. \n\nNonphysical Components \n\na. \n\nProgram Management Office \n\n35. \nThe  PMO  will  handle  the  day  to  day  work  under  the  MFF.  It  will  have  the  capability  to \nmanage  project  execution  under  each  tranche  and  experts  to  prepare  new  projects,  including \nfeasibility  studies  and  design  work  upfront\u2014preliminary  and  final  designs,  technical  drawings. \nThe  PMO  will  also  have  units  to  cater  for  legal  matters;  gender  mainstreaming;  safeguards; \nfinance and administration; financial management; monitoring, evaluation, and reporting; results \nmeasurement; and training on policy, strategy, planning, investment programming, and project \nmanagement. It will also handle the establishment of the AHA. \n \n \n\nPolicy and Strategy Oversight \n\nb. \n\n \n\n36. \nThe  current  policy  framework  needs  some  refinement.  This  task  will  be  undertaken  by \nthe PMO through the engagement of experts on the subject matter. ADB will review the strategy \nfrom time to time to see if the targets are being met or the emphasis on specific interventions \nshould be modified. \n \n \n\nSpecial Features \n\n3. \n\n37. \nOne  special  feature  of  the  Investment  Program  is  inclusion,  as  part  of  the  physical \ninvestments,  of  small  works  such  as  construction  or  rehabilitation  of  off-road  service  areas, \nvillage  access  roads,  foot  paths,  and  foot  bridges,  as  well  as  social  infrastructure  such  as \nschools and medical clinics in communities in the road impact areas.  This feature enables the \nlocal areas to share the benefits of the Investment Program, especially during road construction. \nThe  Government  will  provide  financing  from  the  Afghanistan  Reconstruction  Trust  Fund  for \nthese works. ADB will supplement this finance as and when necessary. Cofinancing will also be \nsought from bilateral agencies interested in community driven investments. \n \n38. \nAnother special feature is supplementary financing from the MFF for completion of works \nthat  would  otherwise  be  stalled  or  curtailed  due  to  unanticipated  increases  in  project  costs. \nThese  works  fall  under  the  infrastructure  improvement  component,  but  will  be  eligible  for \nfinancing only if the cost increase is purely due to a price escalation or a change in the financing \nplan,  and  have  been  appraised  in  accordance  with  the  criteria  set  out  in  Appendix  4.  \nThe  appraisal  procedures  set  forth  in  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  supplementary  financing7 must  also  be \nsatisfied. This special feature will be applied for the Tranche 1 Project outlined in Appendix 5. \nThis feature is accompanied by a contingency under the MFF to finance or co-finance ancillary \nemergency works in priority routes. Standard procedures will also be followed in this case. \n \nThe third is financing upfront to deal with standard project management functions while \n39. \naddressing the risks and best practice approaches on themes. Instead of relying on traditional \nproject management units, a PMO will be set up. It will be structured into teams. Three functions \nof  the  teams  are  highlighted  here:  (i)  legal  team  to  deal  with  all  contractual  and  bidding \nmatters,  and  (ii)  a  results  measurement  capability  and  project  design  upfront  (to  delink  it \nfrom civil works). Safeguards will also figure prominently in the PMO structure. All the tasks are \nto  be  incorporated  into  a  management  information  system\u2014blending  project  management \n\n                                                 \n7  ADB.  2005.

Financing  will  be  provided  as  grants \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources in accordance with relevant ADB policies, the framework \nfinancing  agreement  (FFA)  between  ADB  and  Afghanistan,  and  the  Special  Operations  Grant \nRegulations, 8  subject  to  modification  that  may  be  included  under  individual  financing \nagreements. \n \n42. \nAfghanistan will submit a periodic financing request (PFR) for batches of projects, which \nADB will review in accordance with the FFA and approve for financing from the MFF. Specific \nterms of each tranche will be based on the related PFR and ADB\u2019s then policy and procedures \nfor financing investment projects in Afghanistan. The first PFR is presented to ADB\u2019s Board of \nDirectors,  together  with  the  FFA.  The  amount  of  a  grant  will  be  determined  by  the  maximum \nannual  Special  Funds  made  available  for  Afghanistan.  The  last  date  on  which  any \ndisbursements  under  any  tranche  may  be  made  is  by  31  December  2017.  Afghanistan  is \nexpected to submit the last PFR no later than 30 September 2012. The MFF for the Investment \nProgram will lapse if the legal agreement for the first tranche is executed within 2 months from \nthe date of Management approval for execution of the agreement. \n \n43. \nPursuant  to  the  FFA  and  in  accordance  with  the  first  PFR,  a  grant  of  $60  million  from \nADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  will  be  provided  to  cover  the  cost  of  the  Tranche  1  Project.  \nThe grant will have terms and conditions in accordance with the understandings in the FFA, as \nsupplemented  under  the  relevant  financing  agreement.  The  tentative  financing  plan  for  the \nInvestment Program is in Table 4. \n \n\nTable 4: Tentative Financing Plan \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nWorld Bank \nUnited States Agency for \nInternational Development \nOthersa \n \n \na  Includes the Government\u2019s resources. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nTotal \n\n \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n400 \n150 \n400 \n\n300 \n1,250 \n\nPercentage \n32 \n12 \n32 \n\n24 \n100 \n\n                                                 \n8  ADB.  2005.  Special  Operations  Grant  Regulations:  Applicable  to  Grants  Made  by  ADB  from  Its  Special  Funds \n\nResources. Manila (7 February). \n\n \n\n \n\n\fThe  policy  paper  titled  \u201cRevising  the  Framework  for  Asian  Development  Fund  Grants\u201d, \n44. \nwhich  proposes  revisions  to  the  ADF  grant  framework  and  approved  by  ADB\u2019s  Board  of \nDirectors  on  26  September  2007,  provides  that,  for  countries  eligible  for  grant  assistance,  the \nlevel  of  grants  in  the  country  program  will  be  based  according  to  a  country\u2019s  debt-distress \nclassification.  Afghanistan  is  at  present  classified  as  a  country  with  high  risk  of  debt  distress, \nand therefore eligible to receive 100% grant assistance. \n \n45. \nThere are some caveats to the use of ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. First, the actual \nfinal amount will be subject to the size of the ADF envelope. That has been agreed for the next \n3  years  (2008\u20132010).  Thereafter,  and  at  the  ADF  X  mid-term  review  stage  planned  for  2010, \nthere  will  be  consultations  between  ADB  and  ADF  donors  regarding  the  application,  or \notherwise,  of  the  performance  based  allocation  formula.  Afghanistan  has  entered  the \nperformance  based  allocation  system,  although  this  was  done  on  the  understanding  that  its \napplication needs a special review before it kicks in. The Government understands that ADB\u2019s \ncommitment is limited and contingent on the availability of funds. Although neither ADB nor the \nGovernment would be under any legal obligation to grant or receive, the moral hazard element \nhas also been taken out of the equation through detailed discussion of the ADF envelope and \nthe implications for the financing of the Investment Program. Second, although at this stage the \nfirst  tranche  finance  will  be  extended  on  a  grant  basis,  ADB  cannot  commit  to  retaining  these \nterms and conditions during the availability period of the MFF. If the ADF envelope were to be \nreduced  during  the  mid-term  review  of  ADF  X.  ADB  and  the  Government  will  enter  into \ndiscussions with a view to adjust either one or all of the proposed MFF\u2019s for the three sectors \nand the program lending, envisaged over the same period. Under this scenario, it will be either \nnecessary to cut on a prorata basis, cut one or two areas (and leave the others unchanged) or \nseek cofinancing from donors. By 2010 (until then ADF X financing is firm), only a portion of the \ncivil works contracts under the Investment Program would have been committed to. This means \nthat  adjustments  to  the  ADF  X  envelope  would  not  have  a  negative  impact  on  the  contracts \nentered into with civil works contractors. \n \n46. \nThe first tranche makes a relatively small allocation of funding to program management \n($2 million) whereas the need is projected at $40 million over the MFF period. The reason for \nthis  is  that  the  first  tranche  focuses  on  two  existing  projects  and  not  yet  on  new  road \ninfrastructure development. The allocations made in ongoing ADB financed projects for program \nmanagement will be sufficient to start the establishment of the PMO and engage the services of \nadvisors  to  put  in  place  a  basic  structure  to  be  financed  under  the  second  tranche.  In  the \nsecond  tranche,  the  \u201csoft\u201d  component  could  be  significant  in  size.  The  relatively  high  budget \nallocation takes into account the fact that a major part of the work will be upfront design work \nand  actual  contract  supervision.  These  are  relatively  expensive  items,  but  necessary  in  the \nAfghan context. The allocations of investment over the MFF period is given in Table 3. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProgram Management \n\n47. \nCloser teamwork and efficient lines of communication between MPW units, which will be \nthe  Executing  Agency  for  the  Investment  Program,  and  ADB  are  crucial  success  factors  for \nimplementing  projects  and  institutional  reforms  under  the  MFF.  There  are  three  main \nchallenges:  organizational  structure,  experience,  and  know-how.  The  most  critical  of  these  is \nthe limited supply of qualified national and international staff.  \n \n48. \nThe  organizational  structure  is  easier  to  fix.  Apart  from  spinning  off  the  road  network \nmanagement  responsibility  to  the  AHA,  the  main  proposal  is  to  create  a  tighter  unit\u2014a  PMO \n\n12 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nwith a more precise mandate and resources. As indicated elsewhere in the report, this office will \nbe  split  into  teams,  each  with  a  leader,  staff,  and  resources  and  a  clear  responsibility  and \naccountability lines. These teams will be run by expatriate and national advisors and MPW staff. \nThe  work  will  be  backed  by  the  introduction  of  systems  and  procedures  (including  a \nmanagement  information  system),  a  simple  project  management  plan,  and  a  standard  ADB \nFacility  Administration  Memorandum.  The  office  will  be  the  main  entry  point  for  ADB  staff \noverseeing  the  execution  of  the  MFF.  For  decision  making  on  policies,  strategies,  financial \nmatters, and internal approvals, the PMO will have direct access to the deputy minister of MPW. \nThis deputy minister doubles up as the main focal point for ADB in the transport sector. He is \nalso a major player in CAREC.   \n \n49. \nThe staff gap is much more difficult to deal with. There is a shortage of qualified national \nstaff, and those who are good soon leave their jobs, either for the local private sector or abroad. \nIt is extremely difficult to build capacity under these circumstances. The history on this front is \nthe equivalent to \u201cboom\u201d and \u201cbust\u201d: we create capacity, it goes away and then it needs to be \nreplaced.  This  makes  it  impossible  to  create  institutional  and  project  management  memory. \nMore often than not, ADB and other donors have to start again from scratch every time there is \na  new  transaction.  Although  this  problem  will  not  go  away,  at  least  not  for  a  long  time,  it  is \nhoped that the use of the MFF approach might soften it somewhat. Specifically, the proposal is \nto create a large budget line and finance teams: (i) core team of experts to handle immediate \nproject  management  tasks;  (ii)  short  term  experts  engaged  on  demand  to  sort  out  specific \nproblems related to these tasks; and (iii) a pool of local staff, trained and coached to do different \njobs. This pool will not prevent staff turnover, but at least it will give continuity to the PMO when \nsome staff leave (at least two people should be trained in the same discipline at the same time). \nThe  budget  allocation  of  around  $40  million  over  the  MFF  period  seems  substantial  by  other \ncountry standards. There are two qualifications to make. First, the bulk of the budget will be for \ndesign  work  (to  de-link  it  from  civil  works  contracts)  and  contract  supervision.  This  is  quite \nexpensive. The objective is to front-load this work, leaving contractors with a simpler and more \nfocused  mandate  (with  fewer  conflicts  of  interest).  Second,  the  PMO  needs  teams,  and  these \nneed to cross multitranche periods. This approach provides critical mass and continuity. Many \nof the experts will come from outside Afghanistan, which translates into a higher cost. \n \n50. \nA7.2 of Appendix 7 with details in Supplementary Appendix A. The PMO teams are as follows: \n \n\nThe structure of the PMO and the lines of communication are shown in Figures A7.1 and \n\na. \n\nLeadership \n\nThis team will be run by a program director with experience in civil works contracts in the \n51. \nroads sector. The director will report to the deputy minister of MPW but operate independently \non a day to day basis. The job will have performance targets\u2014quantitative and qualitative. ADB \nwill play a role in the appointment. \n\n52. \nThis team will be responsible for two main tasks: design for subprojects and supervision. \nThe  experts  will  also  help  prepare  bid  documents,  contractor  prequalification,  and  final  bid \nassessments. \n\nb. \n\nTechnical Team \n\nc. \n\nLegal Team \n\n53. \nThis team will be responsible for the entire bidding process, including the preparation of \ndocumentation,  awards  and  contract  negotiations,  and  final  contract  management.  Contract \nvariations  will  be  channeled  through  this  team\u2014in  terms  of  legal  content.  The  team  will  also \n\n \n\n\freport on all undertakings made by the Government to ADB under the MFF including operating \npolicies and procedures. \n\nd. \n\nSafeguards Team \n\nA  pool  of  experts  will  handle  safeguards  matters  during  implementation.  The  work  will \n54. \nstart with due diligence for new projects and include safeguards frameworks and plans (for the \nMFF as a whole and the Tranche 1 Project, respectively). The safeguards experts will monitor \ncompliance during the execution phase. ADB will have a direct entry point to this team. \n\n \n\ne. \n\nGender Mainstreaming \n\n55. \nThe  PMO  will  engage  the  services  of  experts  to  advice  on  gender  mainstreaming.  \nThis is an issue of great importance in a country such as Afghanistan. The concept here is that \neach  investment  must  be  \u201cgender  proofed\u201d.  In  addition,  it  is  imperative  that  broader  gender \nissues  at  the  sector  level  form  part  of  the  policy  framework.  Besides  HIV/AIDs  matters  during \nthe construction phase, the team will also ensure adequate and timely consultations during the \npreparation  of  subprojects  and  adherence  to  gender  plans  during  the  implementation  phase.  \nThis team will play a pivotal role during the design stage, but also with respect to the community \ndriven  investments  along  the  program  roads.  This  is  the  first  time  that  this  approach  is  being \ntaken in an investment program. There will be some \u201clearning by doing\u201d. Appropriate reports will \nbe submitted on the subject matter. An ADB regional department front office gender focal point \nwill work closely with the gender team assigned to the MFF. \n \n\nf. \n\nEvaluations, Monitoring, and Reporting \n\n56. \nThis function is required not only for ADB but also for the Government\u2014to see how the \ninvestments  are  performing  and  benefiting  communities.  A  pool  of  experts  will  be  engaged  by \nthe PMO for this purpose. \n \n\ng. \n\nResults Measurement \n\n57. \nThis is another new feature of the Investment Program and the MFF. The idea here is to \nengage  the  services  of  an  expert  (or  to  outsource  work  to  a  local  institute)  to  measure \nquantifiable and non- quantifiable impacts, outcome, and outputs arising out of the Investment \nProgram. There is a \u201cbefore\u201d, \u201cduring\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d scenarios at play. There is no well- established \nmethodology  to  perform  this  type  of  work  on  infrastructure  projects,  although  a  university  in \nBelgium  is  spearheading  ideas  on  this  front.  This  team  has  been  engaged  by  CWRD  to \nundertake pilot assessments under CAREC road projects. The work will commence in 2009. It is \nhope that the Investment Program, and the experts engaged to do this work in Afghanistan, will \nbenefit from this assessment. \n \n\nh. \n\nFinance and Administration \n\nOne of the most important tasks under the PMO is to ensure that all the funds are used \n58. \nfor  the  intended  purposes  and  to  record  and  account  for  them  on  a  regular  basis.  A  special \nteam will be tasked to perform this work and will be responsible for cash management, payment \nrequests and withdrawals and for the commissions of audits of accounts. This team will be led \nby an expert with experience and a sound track record on the subject matter, reporting directly \nto  the  PMO  director.  ADB  will  have  direct  access  to  this  expert.  All  key  anticorruption, \nprocurement, and financial management arrangements will be channeled through this team.  \n \n\ni. \n\nDue Diligence \n\n59. \nThe preparation of new subprojects requires due diligence: technical, commercial, legal, \nfinancial, social, safeguards, financial management, procurement, implementation, governance, \n\n14 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\netc.  The  PMO  will  commission  work  as  and  when  required  to  undertake  such  work.  This  will \nlead to the submission of new PFRs.  \n\n \n\nj. \n\nCapacity, Policy, and Strategy \n\nThe  road  sector  has  institutions  that  are  ineffective  and  inefficient.  The  restructuring \n60. \nproposed under the Investment Program (creation of the AHA) is complex, and requires a pool \nof experts, local and international. The other area to focus on is the training of staff on project \nmanagement, administration, safeguards, and procurement. There will also be a need to watch \nover the policy framework and strategy, coming up with refinements as and when required. This \nteam will look at the \u201cbig institutional picture\u201d; but also at sector, project, and thematic issues.  \n\n \n61. \nThe ADB team at the resident mission in Kabul will be strengthened, with a permanent \nfocal  point  for  each  sector  and  technical  and  administrative  back-up  staff.  Headquarters  will \nintegrate  with  this  team.  The  objective  is  to  do  the  bulk  of  the  work  in  the  field,  including \nchecking  procurement  and  disbursement  matters,  providing  technical  advice  and  handling \nadministrative work and reporting. The ADB team will work with the PMO in a seamless manner. \nThis  joint  venture  will  cut  paperwork  and  ease  decision-making.  The  objective  is  to  increase \ncontract  awards  and  disbursements  while  improving  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  the \ninstitutions.  The  draft  facility  administration  memorandum,  which  will  be  finalized  by  ADB  and \nagreed with MPW during the inception of the MFF, is shown in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n \n\n2. \n\nPeriodic Financing Requests \n\n62. \nThe criteria for  selecting,  and  procedure  for  obtaining  ADB\u2019s  approval  of  a  tranche  are \ngiven  in  Appendix  4.  The  PMO  will  prepare  a  draft  appraisal  report  in  line  with  standard  ADB \nrequirements. The report will also include details of the contract packages, contracting method \n(design-bid-build  or  design-build),  special  features,  if  applicable,  and  the  services  that  will  be \nprocured  for  supervision  of  works  or  to  support  the  PMO.  The  technical  designs  will  meet \nappropriate standards and relevant policies, and all social and environmental safeguards. \n \n63.  MPW will submit a draft appraisal report on each PFR to ADB, which will perform a due \ndiligence  analysis  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  policies  and  procedures,  and  approve  the \nreport, if in good condition. If required by ADB, the PMO will revise the report, and submit the \nfinal  version  of  the  PFR,  to  ADB  for  approval.  MPW  may  simultaneously  carry  out  advance \ncontracting  for  goods,  works,  and  services  as  approved  by  ADB.  ADB  has  reviewed  and \napproved  the  appraisal  report  on  the  Tranche  1  Project,  and  the  Ministry  of  Finance  has \nsubmitted  the  first  PFR.  The  appraisal  reports  and  PFRs  related  to  subsequent  projects  will \nhave the same format as the first report and PFR. \n\n \n3. \n\nImplementation and Disbursement Schedules \n\n64. \nThe  indicative  implementation  and  disbursement  schedules  for  the  MFF  are  shown  in \nFigure A7.3 and Table A7 of Appendix 7, and  in  details  in  Supplementary  Appendix  A.  These \nschedules  will  be  continually  reviewed  and  updated  by  the  joint  team  to  ensure  timely \ncompletion of activities. \n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement of Consulting Services \n\n65. \nConsultant  Selection  Methods.  Careful  oversight  of  works  and  a  strong  professional \nrelationship  with  the  employer  and  contractor  will  be  part  of  the  mandate  of  the  PMO.  Under \nongoing  projects,  consultants  selected  according  to  the  quality  and  cost-based  selection \n(QCBS) method were unable to exercise adequate oversight and replace key supervision staff \nincluding  team  leaders  due  to  cost  implications.  Moreover,  lapses  in  monitoring  and  reporting \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nhave caused unnecessary costs and embarrassment to the Government. Therefore, flexibility to \nplace more emphasis on quality than on the cost of consulting services is essential. To this end, \nMPW  will  select  and  engage  consultants  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  the  procurement  plan  in  Appendix  8, \nusing  either  QCBS  or  the  quality-based  selection  (QBS)  method,  as  appropriate.  The \nprocurement  plan,  which  covers  activities  in  the  next  18  months,  will  be  updated,  at  least \nannually.  Procurement  of  additional  services  under  the  Tranche  1  Project  is  not  anticipated \nbecause project management services are ongoing. \n \n66. \nCore  and  Short-Term  Consultants.  MPW  will  engage  a  core  experts  and  budget  for \nshort  term  ones,  which  will  be  recruited  to  perform  tasks  on  demand  and  at  shorter  notice.  \nThe consultants will be engaged either as firms or individuals under the second tranche. Terms \nof reference for these consultants will be submitted as part of the second PFR. \n \n\n5. \n\nProcurement of Goods and Works \n\n67.  Methods  of  Procurement  and  Contracting.  MPW  will  undertake  all  procurement \nactivities  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to \ntime), and the procurement plan is in Appendix 8. At least once in 12 months, MPW will update \nthe procurement plan to include activities in the next 18 months. MPW may opt to include post-\ncompletion  maintenance  for  periods  of  up  to  5  years  as  part  of  infrastructure  improvement \nworks,  which  will  be  procured  using  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedure. \nMaintenance works on existing roads and emergency and ancillary works, if necessary bundled \ninto  packages  for  ease  of  administration,  will  be  procured  using  ICB  or  national  competitive \nbidding  (NCB)  procedures.  The  NCB  Annex  in  Supplementary  Appendix  B  summarizes \nnecessary modifications to or clarification of Afghanistan\u2019s procurement procedures to carry out \nNCB for ADB-financed projects. NCB will be used only for projects valued at less than $1 million \nand  in  cases  where  it  is  deemed  more  expeditious  than  ICB.  Design-bid-build  or  design-build \ncontracting  may  be  used  for  infrastructure  improvement,  and  ancillary  and  emergency  works. \nMaintenance contracting will be performance (output) based or based on a hybrid of input (bills \nof quantity) and output. Under the Tranche 1 Project, financing will be solely for price changes in \nongoing ADB-financed projects, where all works contracts have been awarded. Therefore, there \nis no need for procurement of goods or works. \n \n68. \nBidding  Documents.  ADB\u2019s  standard  bidding  documents  will  be  used  for  procuring \ninfrastructure improvement works. They will, to the extent possible, contain performance criteria \nand  security  assurances  that  will  increase  the  efficiency  and  timeliness  of  completion.  In  the \ncase  of  design-build  works,  depending  on  the  level  completion  of  designs  at  the  procurement \nstage,  bids  may  be  called  on  the  basis  of  standards  and  specifications  instead  of  quantities.  \nBidding  documents  for  maintenance  works  on  existing  roads  will  follow  the  World  Bank\u2019s9 or \nother  international  agencies\u2019  documents  for  performance-based  works,  modified  to  ensure \nconsistency  with  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  and  Afghanistan  Procurement  Law  (October  2005)  with \nreference to NCB Annex in Supplementary Appendix B, and Section 3 of the procurement plan \nin Appendix 8. For post completion maintenance of infrastructure improvement works, the same \nmaintenance bidding documents may be included as part of the standard documents. In either \ncase, MPW will prepare the documents for works and maintenance, and submit them to ADB for \napproval before calling for tenders. \n \n\n                                                 \n9  Available: http://www.worldbank.org/html/opr/procure/bdocpage.html. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nSpecial  Procurement  Condition.  Some  projects  of  the  Investment  Program  will  be \n69. \nlocated in areas where countries that are not ADB members could provide materials, at highly \ncompetitive prices. Explicit procurement restrictions may preclude civil works and maintenance \ncontractors  from  seeking  the  best  business  terms  from  suppliers  in  these  countries  and \nsubmitting  competitive  bids.  To  keep  the  project  costs  to  a  minimum,  ADB  Management \nproposes that works contractors financed from the MFF be allowed to procure bitumen from any \ncountry,  including  the  countries  that  are  not  ADB  members  for  use  in  the  Project.  \nThis  special  condition  was  approved  by  the  Board  for  previous  four  projects10 in  Afghanistan. \nADB  and  MPW,  through  routine  reviews  and  procurement  audits,  will  ensure  the  contractors\u2019 \nstrict adherence to this special condition. \n \n\n6. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\nTo expedite the bidding process, ADB Management has approved advance contracting \n70. \nand retroactive financing from the MFF for expenditures incurred on eligible works, goods, and \nservices. Advance contracting allows MPW to commence procurement activities, at its own risk, \nprior  to  signing  of  the  financing  agreement.  Afghanistan  was  informed  that,  in  order  for \nexpenses  incurred  under  advance  contracting  to  be  eligible  for  retroactive  financing,  such \nprocedures  (including  advertising)  must  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  and \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  Once  the  financing  under  each  tranche  becomes \neffective,  up  to  20%  of  grant  proceeds  from  any  tranche  may  be  used  to  retroactively  finance \neligible  expenditures  incurred  under  that  tranche,  pursuant  to  advance  contracting,  during  the \nperiod  not  exceeding  12  months  prior  to  signing  of  the  project  financing  agreement. \nAlternatively, the Government may opt for advance contracting without retroactive financing, in \nwhich case the procurement procedures completed under advance contracting do not conclude \nwith  the  award  of  contract  until  after  the  grant  becomes  effective.  Afghanistan  acknowledges \nthat any concurrence by ADB with the procedures, documentation, or proposal for award does \nnot commit ADB to finance such expenses. \n \n\n7. \n\nAnticorruption Measures \n\n71.  MPW,  through  the  PMO,  will  maintain  oversight  of  all  externally  funded  projects  in \naccordance  with  international  best  practices.  The  national  procurement  law  has  several  key \nsafeguards  and  specifies  the  accepted  conduct  of  public  officials  in  the  event  of  a  conflict  of \ninterest  and  corruption.  Methods  of  procurement  for  externally  financed  activities,  including \nADB\u2019s projects, follow specific procedures and guidelines. Procurement of works and services \nfor  budget-financed  projects  is  based  on  the  national  procurement  law.  However,  there  is  no \nformal  record  keeping,  evaluation  of  contractors\u2019  and  consultants\u2019  performance,  or  conflict-of-\ninterest disclosure by procurement committee members and bidders. Site reviews by MPW are \ninadequate.  As  part  of  its  reform  process,  MPW  will  establish  eligibility  criteria  for  persons \nserving  on  bid  evaluation  committees  and  will  require  disclosure  of  assets  and  conflicts  of \ninterest.  Additionally,  MPW  will  engage  private  firms  to  conduct  procurement  and  operability \n(technical)  audits  of  randomly  selected  works  contracts  within  12  months  of  contract  and  6 \n\n                                                 \n10 ADB.  2003.

A  detailed  review  of  the \nfinancial  management  and  governance  procedures  of  MPW  and  MOF  is  provided  in \nSupplementary Appendix C. \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n72. \nwith  the  Government  and  MPW.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  a  project.  \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \ngrant  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  related  to  each  tranche  project.  In  particular,  all \ncontracts financed by ADB in connection with a tranche shall include provisions specifying the \nright  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  MPW  and  all  contractors, \nsuppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  a  tranche.  MPW  will \nundertake necessary measures to publicly disclose project-related procurement actions such as \ninformation  on  bidding  procedures  adopted,  specifications  of  goods,  works,  and  consulting \nservices, participating bidders, and award of contracts. ADB made clear to the Government that \nany proven wrong-doing on the fiduciary front will automatically lead to the suspension  and/or \ncancellation of the MFF.   \n\n \n8. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nProceeds from the MFF will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \n73. \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). In order to pay routine project management \ncosts,  a  separate  imprest  account  with  an  approved  ceiling  of  $100,000  will  be  established \npromptly after effectiveness of each grant agreement at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB, \nand  the  account  will  be  managed  by  MPW.  To  expedite  the  flow  of  funds  and  simplify \ndocumentation processing, the statement of expenditures procedure will be used for liquidation \nand  replenishment  of  the  imprest  account  and  reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  not \nexceeding  $50,000  per  individual  payment.  Based  on  supporting  documentation,  ADB  will \nreimburse, liquidate, or replenish payments in excess of the statement of expenditures ceiling. \nMOF will monitor the imprest account, and review monthly reconciliation of the account. \n \n\n9. \n\nReviews \n\nIn  addition  to  monitoring  by  the  operational  division  and  periodic  reviews  by  missions, \n74. \nADB,  together  with  MOF  and  MPW,  will  perform  on  and  off-site  reviews  of  the  Investment \nProgram and the projects financed from the MFF. In the first 2 years of the Investment Program, \nquarterly or biannual reviews may be needed. A midterm review of the Investment Program (all \ncomponents of all projects financed from the MFF) will be performed in mid\u20132011. The reviews \nwill focus on identifying causes and agreeing on measures to correct negative deviations from \ntargets for (i) output rates, (ii) disbursements, (iii) reforms, (iv) financial and procurement audits, \nand  (v)  safeguards  compliance.  ADB  has  allocated  additional  resources  and  staff  to  ADB\u2019s \nresident  mission  in  Kabul  to  participate  in  the  reviews,  facilitate  coordination  with  the \nGovernment, and maintain better oversight. \n \n\n10. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n75. \nThe  PMO  will  maintain,  for  each  tranche,  records  and  accounts  required  to  identify  \n(i)  goods,  works,  and  services  procured;  (ii)  funds  received  from  ADB  and  MOF;  and  \n(iii) expenditures incurred. Annual financial audits will be performed by the Office of the Auditor \nGeneral of Afghanistan. In instances when that office is unable to undertake the financial audits \non time, MPW will engage a private firm of auditors using the QCBS method according to \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  Within  6  months  after  the  end  of  each  fiscal  year, \n\n18 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19\n\nMPW will submit to ADB the audited project accounts and the auditors\u2019 report, for each project, \nincluding  a  separate  opinion  of  the  auditors  on  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  and  the \nstatement of expenditure procedures. A detailed assessment of the strengths and weaknesses \nof  the  present  accounting,  auditing,  and  reporting  system  in  Afghanistan  is  given  in \nSupplementary Appendix B. \n \n76. \nAdditionally,  MPW  will  engage  specialists  to  conduct  technical  audits  using  the  QCBS \nmethod according to  ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Technical audit reports  will \nbe submitted to ADB within 1 month after completion. The PMO will also prepare, and submit to \nADB,  summary  quarterly  reports  on  the  performance  of  each  component  of  each  project.  \nThe  reports  will  include  information  on  physical  progress,  past  disbursements,  projected \ndisbursements  in  the  following  quarter,  implementation  of  social  and  environment  safeguards, \nproblems (if any) encountered, actions taken, and activities planned in the following quarter. \n \n\n11. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n77. \nBased  on  guidance  provided  by  ADB,  MPW  has  prepared  a  systematic  procedure  of \nrecording and analyzing related data to monitor and report performance of ongoing projects to \nits  stakeholders.  MPW  will  use  the  same  procedure,  with  modifications  where  necessary,  to \nmonitor  and  report  to  ADB  on  the  performance  of  the  MFF.  The  reports  will  contain  baseline \nvalues of indicators, targets, and milestones corresponding to the expected impacts, outcome, \noutputs,  and  activities  identified  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework,  including  special \nfeatures and other relevant measures agreed between ADB and MPW. \n \n78. \nThe  PMO  will  collect  baseline  data  and  other  information  during  implementation. \nThereafter, it will analyze data every 12 months, and including the results of the analyses and \ncorrective  measures  (if  any)  taken  to  reverse  negative  trends  and  MPW\u2019s  quarterly  report  to \nADB  impacts.  ADB  review  missions  will  discuss  these  reports  and  actions  taken  by  MPW  to \nensure that all the targets and milestones are met. \n \n79.  MPW will perform a final analysis of related primary and secondary data on impacts and \noutcome  within  1  month  from  completion  of  each  project.  The  results  of  this  analysis  will  be \nincluded  in  the  recipient\u2019s  project  completion  report,  which  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  within  \n3 months of each project completion. These results will be verified by ADB and reported in its \nproject completion report for each corresponding project. \n \n\n12. \n\nStakeholder Participation and Consultation \n\n80. \nADB, USAID, and the World Bank together have financed more than 75% of the cost of \nimproving  the  economically  and  strategically  vital  \u201cring  road\u201d  in  Afghanistan.  To  ensure  that \nfuture development efforts in the road sector are aimed at a common goal, ADB has consulted \nUSAID  and  the  World  Bank  while  preparing  the  MFF.  Likewise,  ADB  has  met  with  people  of \nvillages adjacent to the roads being constructed, road users and road builders to ascertain the \nimmediate  impacts,  both  positive  and  negative.  These  meetings  revealed  that  the  positive \nimpacts  far  outweigh  the  negatives.  Based  on  these  lessons,  MPW  will  ensure  that  the \nInvestment Program is implemented with active participation of all national stakeholders, using \nparticipatory  practices.  Consultation  will  continue \nInvestment  Program \nimplementation. MPW, through regular field visits and the use of specialists, will implement each \ntranche.  Disclosure  of  relevant  information  will  continue  throughout  implementation  of  the \nInvestment  Program.  In  the  case  of  tranche  1,  resettlement  and  environmental  impacts  have \nbeen discussed with the stakeholders, including affected persons and local administrative units, \n\nthroughout \n\nthe \n\n \n\n\fand  the  relevant  information  has  been  publicly  disclosed  through  the  local  media  and  ADB\u2019s \nwebsite. \n\nIV. \n\nBENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\n \n\nBenefits and Impacts \n\n1. \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\n81. \nThe  condition  of  roads  and  level  of  network  connectivity  at  present  are  such  that  even \nminor improvements to them provide large economic benefits to road users and the economy as \na whole. Interviews with traders in the villages and towns along the improved roads confirmed \nthat  the  price  of  key  commodities  have  dropped  by  up  to  50%  soon  after  the  works  were \ncompleted.  These  benefits  could  be  sustained  by  making  selected  investments  in  the  right \nplaces  at  the  right  time.  To  this  end,  for  every  investment  from  the  MFF,  MPW  will  perform \neconomic analyses in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects \n(1997)  to  ensure  that  it  meets  the  benefit  thresholds  before  requesting  financing  for  that \ninvestment from the MFF. The two subprojects of the Tranche 1 Project, (Loan 2140-AFG and \nLoan  2257-AFG),  had  significant  positive  net  present  values  (NPVs),  and  economic  internal \nrates of return (EIRRs) of 19% and 31%, respectively. The increase in their costs by 22% and \n31%, respectively to contract price changes will lower the NPVs estimated at appraisal by 9% \nand 22%, and EIRRs estimated at appraisal by 3% and 4%. However, the subprojects remain \nrobust, as described in Appendix 9. \n \n\n2. \n\nSustainability\u2014Physical Components \n\n82.  MPW will have to set aside funding to maintain and repair the networks. This is part of \nthe  MFF  conditions.  Failure  to  do  so  will  trigger  a  cancellation  or  suspension  of  the  MFF.  \nThe  MPW  is  implementing  a  management  information  system  under  the  ongoing  Grant  0081-\nAFG. This system would enable many of the tasks handled manually at present to be expedited \nand  information  to  be  stored  for  future  use  on  maintenance  needs.  Additionally,  ADB  recently \nassisted  the  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Civil  Aviation  in  revising  surface  transport  service \nregulations, which would increase cost recovery from road users. In the interim, USAID and the \nEuropean  Union  are  financing  part  of  the  required  maintenance  costs  through  separate \nprograms,  which  later  could  be  mainstreamed  into  MPW  operations.  ADB  has  also  allocated \n$20 million from Grant 0081-AFG for maintenance of roads already improved and set aside $30 \nmillion  from  the  MFF  for  continuing  this  work.  Implementation  of  vehicle  weight  control \nmeasures  by  MPW  and  supported  by  ADB  will  gradually  reduce  the  number  of  overloaded \nvehicles  on  the  roads,  and  the  consequent  damages  to  the  pavements.  Additionally,  a  sound \nfinancial management system has been implemented at the PMO, and it will be upgraded to be \npart of MPW\u2019s overall management information system (which will be operationalized by 2010). \nThese  activities,  in  concert  with  the  maintenance  and  institutional  reform  components  of  the \nInvestment Program, will help increase the sustainability of Afghanistan\u2019s investment in its road \nnetwork. \n \n\n3. \n\nSustainability\u2014Nonphysical Components \n\nStaff  training  planned  under  the  Investment  Program  will  be  supplemented  by  the \n83. \nGovernment salary and career program. The operationalization of AHA will allow the delegation \nof  responsibilities  to  various  operational  departments.  That  should  increase  accountability  and \nstaff  satisfaction.  Other  institutional  improvement  areas  are  highlighted  above  under  the  role \nand functions of the PMO. \n \n \n\n20 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n21\n\n4. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\n84. \nThe Investment Program has been assessed according to  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Policy \n(2002).  It  is  classified  as  category  B  due  to  the  minimal  short-term  environmental  impacts  of \nimprovement and maintenance works planned in each of the projects. Long-term environmental \nimpacts  of  the  Investment  Program  will  be  addressed  during  implementation.  Assessment  of \nshort-term  impacts  and  their  mitigation  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  the  environmental \nassessment  and  review  framework  given  in  Appendix  10.  MPW  prepared  the  framework  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Environmental Policy (2002) and Environmental Assessment Guidelines \n(2003), as well as relevant laws and regulations in Afghanistan. It has been agreed with ADB. \nSufficient funding has been set aside from the MFF to mitigate, where necessary, environmental \nimpacts of the projects to be funded from it. MPW will monitor implementation of environmental \nmanagement plans for the projects through its staff and supervision consultants, and report to \nADB  every  6  months.  After  reviewing  MPW\u2019s  environmental  impact  monitoring  reports  and \ndiscussing with the supervision consultants for each subproject of the Tranche 1 Project, ADB is \nsatisfied that there have been no significant environmental impacts up to now and none in the \nfuture.  Minor  lapses  on  the  part  of  the  contractor  (such  as  inadequate  dust  control,  delays  in \ndisposing of construction waste, and excess run off from vehicle servicing) have been identified \nby  the  supervision  consultants  and  immediate  corrective  action  has  been  taken.  Moreover, \nrelated  requirements  in  the  loan  and  grant  covenants  have  been  satisfied  and  the  initial \nclassification (category B) of the Tranche 1 Project still holds. \n \n\n5. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts \n\n85. \nLand acquisition and resettlement impacts of each project under the MFF will be treated \naccording  to  the  resettlement  framework  given  in  Supplementary  Appendix  D,  which  was \nprepared  by  MPW  in  consultation  with  national  and  local  administrative  bodies  and  in \naccordance  relevant  ADB  policies.  The  impact  assessment  and  mitigation  will  depend  on  the \nmethod  of  contracting  for  the  different  types  of  physical  works.  In  design-bid-build  contracts, \nMPW will prepare detailed designs and corresponding resettlement plans (RPs) and implement \nthem  simultaneously  with  procurement  of  works.  MPW  will  not  sign  works  contracts  prior  to \ncompleting  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities.  In  the  case  of  design-build  contracts, \nwhich  would  allow  works  to  be  expedited  by  the  designing  the  road  while  physical  works \nprogress,  after  the  award  of  contracts  and  during  the  detailed  design  phase,  MPW  will  work \nthrough the supervision consultant(s) and the contractor(s) to determine impacts. Depending on \nthese  impacts,  MPW  will  prepare  resettlement  plans  and  implement  the  plans  after  obtaining \napproval from ADB.11  \n \n86.  Works  contracts  will  contain  specific  provisions,  and  MPW  and  the  supervision \nconsultants  will  exercise  careful  oversight  to  ensure  that  works  in  the  impacted  areas  are  not \nundertaken  until  the  key  resettlement  activities  are  completed.  The  supervision  consultants\u2019 \ncontracts will contain specific monitoring provisions requiring their teams to include resettlement \nand social development specialists to monitor the works and assist MPW. MPW will engage an \nexternal  monitor  to  review  and  report  on  resettlement  activities  to  the  stakeholders  and  ADB. \nThe  external  monitor  will  be  responsible  for  issuing  a  no-objection  certificate  for \ncommencement  of  civil  works.  Funding  from  the  MFF  has  been  set  aside  for  land  acquisition, \nresettlement,  and  safeguard  monitoring.  After  reviewing  MPW\u2019s  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  impact  monitoring  reports  and  discussing  with  the  supervision  consultants  for  each \n\n                                                 \n11 This condition is an assurance provided by Afghanistan in Loan 2140-AFG: Andkhoy-Qaisar Road Project, and will \n\nbe included in legal documents pertaining to each Project of this Investment Program. \n\n \n\n\fsubproject  of  the  Tranche  1  Project,  ADB  is  satisfied  that  there  has  not  been  any  land \nacquisition  or  resettlement  up  to  now,  and  there  will  be  none  in  the  future.  Moreover,  related \nrequirements in the covenants have been satisfied.  \n \nAn assessment of the impact of the Investment Program related activities on indigenous \n87. \npeoples  has  been  performed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Indigenous  Peoples  Policy  (1998).  \nThe constitutional categorizations of the people of Afghanistan do not include any as indigenous \npeoples,  and  there  are  no  people  that  will  be  negatively  affected  by  the  Investment  Program \nrelated activities. The Investment Program is accordingly classified as category C. \n \n\n6. \n\nSocial and Poverty Impacts \n\n88. \nThere will be several externalities of the Investment Program, direct and indirect. Among \nthese are employment opportunities for road works, and the 3 to 5 year maintenance contracts \nenvisaged  under  the  construction  works  contracts,  which  will  be  for  longer  periods  for  road \nworks. Additionally, access to health care and potable water will be increased as a result of the \ncommunity  infrastructure  improvements  planned  in  conjunction  with  road  improvements.  \nThere  is  an  ongoing  HIV/AIDS  awareness  campaign  financed  under  previous  ADB-financed \nprojects  that  is  expected  to  have  an  impact  countrywide  by  focusing  on  vulnerable  mobile \ngroups  such  as  commercial  vehicle  operators.  The  provincial  reconstruction  teams  of  the \ninternational forces have increased surveillance on national and regional roads, which will serve \nas a deterrent to trafficking of drugs and people. Afghan forces are expected to take over these \nduties in the long run. To maximize these externalities, poverty reduction and social strategies \nwill  be  prepared  according  to  ADB\u2019s  handbooks  on  poverty  reduction  and  social  analysis 12 \nduring the design of subsequent projects financed from the MFF. Implementation of the strategy \nwill be closely monitored by external observers engaged by MPW. \n \nB. \n\nAssumptions and Risks \n\n89. \nSecurity is the main risk. Awarding contracts at a reasonable price is already difficult, but \ncarrying out civil works is more complicated in the current security environment. Delays to civil \nworks  contracts  have  been  a  common  feature  of  ADB  and  other  donor-backed  road  projects. \nBetter project management, more community buy-in and smarter phasing of particular sections \n(against the financing) improve schedules  and  cut  cost  overruns.  But  security  can  derail  good \nwork  at  short  notice.  This  falls  outside  the  direct  ADB  and  MPW  domain.  The  small  scale \ncommunity  investments  should  cut  the  number  of  disruptions  to  contractors.  But  beyond  this, \nsuccess  will  be  a  function  of  overall  security  cover,  and  it  is  assumed  that  the  proposed \nincrease in international forces will help curtail and eventually lessen this risk. \n \n90. \nThe  Investment  Program  needs  good  institutions  and  strong  management  and \ngovernance.  Good  planning,  best  practice  concepts,  sound  project  management,  fiduciary \noversight  and  transparent  bidding  and  contract  management  processes  require  not  only \nexperienced  personnel,  but  also  efficient  and  effective  systems/procedures  and  controls.  \nOn the institutional front, considerable hope is placed on the establishment of AHA, which will \ntake over the management of the road network. \n \nThis also requires leaders. But, not all is well in Afghanistan at all times on these fronts. \n91. \nGood and experienced people often leave MPW after training and the new ones are not always \nready  to  take  on  project  management  responsibilities.  The  Investment  Program  will  introduce \nbetter  organizational  structures,  greater  staff  continuity,  including  among  advisors.  But  staff \n\n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2006. Poverty Handbook. Manila. ADB. 2007. Handbook on Social Analysis. Manila. \n\n22 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n23\n\nturnover  will  likely  remain  high.  This  implies  a  high  level  of  hand-holding.  Governance  and \nfiduciary  controls  need  strengthening.  The  MFF  will  provide  assistance  for  improving  these \nareas.  The  FFA  and  the  legal  agreements  clarify  that  corruption  and  violations  of  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  and  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  These  will  be  \u201cdeal \nbreakers\u201d and may lead to the immediate suspension of ADB financing. Adherence to policy and \nprocedures represent other filters.  \n  \n92. \nCapacity building will be crucial and the only solution in the long term to getting things \ndone well and on time. In the short term, intensive and direct help will need to be a feature of \nthe  ADB  work.  The  quality  of  this  work  will  be  a  function  of  the  quality  of  the  advisors  ADB \nfinance. Neither ADB nor most of other development partners have been successful on this front \nin  Afghanistan.  Two  year  tours  of  duty  by  consultants  and  staff  are  too  short  in  most  places, \nespecially so in Afghanistan. This happens even at the resident mission level. \n \n93. \nAnother risk is financing. ADB will provide the necessary funding for capital expenditure, \nbut  in  the  long  run  the  main  issue  is  maintenance  and  repair.  This  needs  a  recurrent  budget \nallocation. Budget allocations in the past have been haphazard and the fiscal policy has been in \ndisarray  lately,  with  tax  collection  down  on  expectations.  A  \u201croad  fund\u201d  might  be  part  of  the \nsolution,  but  even  this  requires  seed  capital.  The  matter  requires  attention  and  this  will  be \nprovided  through  the  PMO.  It  is  not  far-fetched  to  expect  some  of  the  donor  funding  to  be \nbrought  into  the  national  budget,  for  this  to  be  made  this  available  for  priority  investment \nprograms under ANDS. At present, only a few donors operate through the budget. ADB is one \nof them.  \n \nA  reversal  of  the  strategy  and  the  policy  framework  by  the  Government  is  also  a  risk. \n94. \nThe former is less likely to happen than the latter. In the latter\u2019s case, the aim is to maintain a \nclose  eye  on  the  principles  and  to  call  for  additional  refinements  over  the  MFF  period.  \nThe Government is willing to receive advice in this area.  \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nADB will seek assurances from Afghanistan that, through MPW, it will ensure that: \n\n95. \n \n96. \nSector  Specific  Undertakings.  The  Afghanistan  Highway  Authority  envisaged  under \nthe  MPW  Strategy  will  be  established  and  operationalized  by  2013  at  the  latest.  Afghanistan \nprovides  counterpart  funds  for  selected  social  infrastructure  (e.g.  buildings  for  schools  and \nmedical  services,  drinking  water  wells,  etc.)  in  the  communities  in  the  Investment  Program \nimpact  areas.  Adequate  funds  for  completing  improvements  to  the  remaining  regional  and \nnational  roads  in  accordance  with  the  MPW  Strategy  are  secured,  and  are  available,  and \nsufficient funds are allocated from its own budget and made promptly available for maintenance \nof roads financed from the MFF and previous grants and loans from ADB. \n\n \n97. \nEnvironment.  Roads  and  related  infrastructure  are  designed  and  operated  in \naccordance  with  applicable  laws  and  regulations,  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002),  and  all \nsteps are taken to (i) prepare, during the detailed design stage and submit for ADB review and \napproval, an initial environmental examination report and/or environmental impact assessment \nreport, and at the point of starting of works, an environmental management plan to prevent or \nmitigate  adverse  impacts  of  each  tranche  project;  and  (ii)  monitor  implementation  of  the \nenvironmental  management  plan  and  report  on  the  status  of  each  tranche  to  ADB  every  \n6 months. \n \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\nLand  Acquisition  and  Resettlement.  In  accordance  with  applicable  laws  and \n98. \nregulations, ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995), and the resettlement framework (i) a \nresettlement plan is prepared after the completion of detailed design and agreed on with ADB, \nand  disclosed  to  the  affected  persons  (ii)  all  compensation  is  paid  in  a  legal  and  transparent \nmanner  before  taking  possession  of  the  acquired  land,  structures,  and  other  assets;  (iii)  as  a \ncondition  for  commencing  works  in  a  given  location,  the  external  monitor  will  submit  a  no-\nobjection  certificate  to  the  PMO  and  ADB,  confirming  that  there  are  no  outstanding  issues \nrelated  to  the  resettlement  plan  implementation;  and  (iv)  an  independent  resettlement/social \ndevelopment monitor is engaged to consult with local governments and communities, as well as \nnongovernment organizations and report on the resettlement plan implementation quality to the \nnational stakeholder and ADB. The monitor will submit biannual reports to MPW and ADB. \n \nGender and Development, Health, and Labor. The MFF is implemented in compliance \n99. \nwith ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development (1998), and contractors and consultants will be \nrequired to (i) comply with all applicable laws of Afghanistan; (ii) offer equal opportunities to men \nand  women;  (iii)  disseminate  at  the  work  and  campsites,  information  on  the  risks  of  sexually \ntransmitted  diseases;  (iv)  provide  equal  pay  to  men  and  women  for  work  of  equal  type;  \n(v)  ensure  that  worksites  and  campsites  are  safe  for  all  employees,  service  providers,  public, \nand  road  users;  and  (vi)  abstain  from  engaging  persons  below  the  legally  employable  age  in \nAfghanistan. \n \n100.  Fiduciary  Oversight.  Independent  auditors  shall  conduct  audits  of  procurement,  and \ncorrective action, including legal action, will be taken to correct actions to prevent misallocation \nof  resources  or  recover  any  losses.  Funds  for  road  development  and  maintenance  will  be \nallocated  and  tracked  through  the  management  information  system  (MIS)  implemented  under \nADB Grant 0081-AFG. \n \n101.  Quality.  The  works,  goods,  and  services  procured  for  each  project  will  be  monitored \ncontinuously and evaluated periodically so that the designs, professional conduct, and outputs, \nas  the  case  may  be,  are  in  accordance  with  relevant  national,  regional,  and  international \nstandards, criteria, best practices, and agreements, and are in compliance with ADB\u2019s policies. \n \n102.  Security.  Armed forces and police in the Investment Program areas provide protection \nrequired  for  smooth  and  uninterrupted  implementation  of  the  Investment  Program.  In  addition, \nAfghanistan  shall  require  service  providers  and  works  contractors  in  each  project  under  the \nMFF to submit security plans as part of the bids, which will be part of the contracts, and include \nadequate financing in the project budgets to enable implementation of these plans. \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n103. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  multitranche  financing  facility  would  comply  with  the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and acting in the absence of the \nPresident,  under  the  provisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  \nI recommend that the Board approve: \n \n\nthe provision of funding under the multitranche financing facility in an aggregate \nprincipal  amount  not  exceeding  $400,000,000  equivalent  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \nFunds  resources  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Afghanistan  for  the  Road  Network \nDevelopment \nterms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  Framework  Financing \nAgreement presented to the Board; and  \n\nInvestment  Program  upon \n\n(i) \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n25\n\n(ii) \n\nthe  proposal  set  out  in  para.  69  of  this  report  that  bitumen  procured  from \nnonmember  countries  of  ADB  for  civil  works  be  eligible  for  financing  from  the \nfunding  provided  under  the  Road  Network  Development  Investment  Program.  \nIf the requisite affirmative vote of Directors representing not less than two thirds \nof  the  total  voting  power  of  ADB's  members,  pursuant  to  Article  14(ix)  of  the \nArticles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  is  not  obtained  for  this  recommendation  and  the \nBoard approves only the recommendation in para. 103 (i), then only bitumen for \ncivil works procured from member countries of ADB will be eligible for financing \nfrom  grants  under  the  multitranche  financing  facility  for  the  Road  Network \nDevelopment Investment Program.  \n\n \n7 November 2008 \n \n\nC.

system  comprises  of  road,  rail,  air,  and  inland  waterways.  \nThe official road network spans 38,500 kilometers (km): 300 km of regional roads, 4,700 km of \nnational roads, 9,700 km of provincial roads, 17,000 km of rural roads, and 3,800 km of urban \nroads.  The  total  length  of  railways  is  24.6  km,  which  are  cross-border  extensions  from \nTurkmenistan  and  Uzbekistan  to  transshipment  yards  in  Towraghondi  and  Kheyrabad, \nrespectively (about 10 km and 15 km from the respective borders). Inland waterways are limited \nto the Amu Darya and its tributaries,1 although only the formal inland port at Shirkhan Bandar is \noperational at present. There are more than 60 airports and airfields spread across the country. \nThere  are  two  international  and  22  domestic  airports  that  meet  International  Civil  Aviation \nOrganization (ICAO) Class 4 categorization standards.2 By 2010, the Kabul International Airport \nand  Herat  Airport  are  expected  to  achieve  full  international  ICAO  compliance  while  Mazar-i-\nSharif, Jalalabad, and Kandahar will be upgraded.  \n \nAt  the  end  of  2001,  more  than  90%  of  the  transport  system  was  unconnected  and  in \n2. \npoor condition. Since then, the donors have helped improve key infrastructure, especially roads. \nAbout  86%  of  the  regional  road  network  is  scheduled  to  be  operational  by  end  2008  with  the \nremainder  to  be  completed  by  2010.  Work  is  underway  or  funding  has  been  obtained  for  the \nremaining  regional  roads,  with  the  exception  of  a  50  km  section  east  of  Herat.  The  improved \nroads  include  almost  2,100  km  (63%)  of  regional  roads,  650  km  (14%)  of  national  roads,  and \n6,000  km  of  provincial  and  rural  roads.  Roads  serve  90%  of  the  national  and  regional  travel \ndemand. \n \n3. \nRail  services  at  Hairatan  take  in  4\u20135  trains  per  day  with  30  cars  each.  Traffic  at \nTorghundi  is  two  trains  per  day  with  20\u201325  cars  each.  The  major  imports  are  petroleum \nproducts and humanitarian food aid and at Torghundi, scrap metal is transshipped by truck  to \nPakistan.  There  is  little  reverse  traffic  except  for  some  seasonal  fruit.  The  Kabul  International \nAirport  handled  approximately  0.5  million  international  and  domestic  passengers  in  2005,  and \ncivil aviation generated about $40 million from commercial overflights and airport taxes.   \n \nIn 2007, registered vehicles included over 300,000 cars, 40,000 buses, 100,000 trucks, \n4. \n100,000  motorcycles,  and  5,000  rickshaws.  Vehicle  numbers  increased  rapidly,  with  annual \ngrowth over the past 3 years of 23% for cars, 15% for trucks, 48% for motorcycles, but only 2% \nfor buses and rickshaws. Virtually all vehicles are second-hand imports from Japan and Europe. \n \n5. \nDomestic  air  passenger  and  freight  services  are  provided  by  the  state  carrier  and \nseveral  private  carriers.  At  least  daily  flights  are  available  between  Kabul  and  most  cities.  \nInternational services between Kabul and several  Asian destinations are provided currently by \nboth national and international carriers. A private foundation operates a passenger ferry three to \nfour times daily to Tajikistan.  Tajikistan\u2019s  state-owned  barge  service  ferries  trucks  a  few  times \nper  day,  depending  on  traffic.  A  road  bridge  across  the  Pyanzh  River  near  to  Sirkhan  Bandar \nwas  completed  in  2007  with  funding  from  the  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment. The traffic potential through this border crossing is significant and plans are being \nmade for full border facilities. \n\n                                                 \n1  Dachiku,  Kiyoshi  and  Azeem  Tahir.  2002.

The  remaining  buses  are  8-  to  12-seat  vans  owned  by  individuals  providing  informal \npassenger  transport  services  in  the  cities  and  connections  between  rural  areas  and  towns.  \nThe only cross-border bus service is between Jalalabad and Peshawar. An estimated 45 million \npassenger trips were made by bus transport in 2005.  \n \n7. \nMore than 150 registered taxi companies operate in the country\u201453 in Kabul with a fleet \nof  16,309  taxis  and  108  in  the  provinces  with  a  fleet  of  30,248.  In  2007,  the  taxi  fares  varied \nfrom  $0.01/km  to  $0.03/km  depending  on  various  classes  of  passenger  vehicles  and  terrain \ntypes  for  paved  roads,  whereas  it  varied  from  $0.015/km  to  $0.03/km  for  unpaved  roads. \nOperators pay a 3% commission to the Government at provincial or national borders and at the \noutskirts of major towns. \n \n8. \nFreight is carried primarily in private owned trucks. The truck population is approximately \n20% heavy articulated trucks with the remaining 80% divided equally into heavy, medium, and \nlight  or  pickup  classes.  Freight  charges  are  approximately  $0.07/ton-km  on  paved  roads  and \n$0.08/ton-km on unpaved roads. A 5% commission per trip is levied by the Government. There \nare  no  special  transit  charges  and  foreign  trucks  transporting  freight  through  Afghanistan  are \ncharged the 5% commission only. \n \nB. \n\nInstitutional and Regulatory Frameworks \n\n9. \nMultiple  government  ministries  are  involved  in  operating  and  regulating  the  transport \nsector: Ministry of Public Works (MPW), Ministry of Transportation and Civil Aviation (MOTCA), \nMinistry  of  Urban  Development  (MOUD),  Ministry  of  Rural  Rehabilitation  and  Development \n(MRRD),  Ministry  of  Interior  (MOI).  Local  authorities  are  also  involved.  In  the  road  subsector, \nMPW  is  assigned  the  responsibility  for  planning,  designing,  constructing,  and  maintaining \nregional,  national,  and  provincial  roads.  MRRD  is  responsible  for  rural  roads,  and  MOUD  and \nthe  local  authorities  administer  the  urban  roads.  There  have  been  discussions  at  a  high  level \nabout  governance  of  the  sector  transitioning  to  international  best  practices  within  the  Afghan \ncontext.  This  is  expected  to  be  achieved  by  merging  the  MPW,  MOTCA,  plus  those  units  in \nMRRD, MOI, and MOUD dealing with transport into a single Ministry of Transport by 2009.  \n \n10.  MPW has a workforce of approximately 200 engineers and administrative staff, as well \nas  2,000  laborers  at  the  regional  maintenance  centers  and  provinces.  At  present,  however,  it \nserves  as  administrator  for  donor-financed  projects  and  executor  of  budget-financed  minor \nconstruction  and  maintenance  works.  MOTCA  issues  operating  and  transit  permits,  sets \ntechnical  standards  and  tariffs,  collects  road-user  fees,  and  enforces  standards  and  tariffs. \nIt also provides passenger and freight transport services using state-owned vehicles. Legislation \nin 2008 has authorized the Government to provide nationwide freight and passenger services. \nMOI carries out vehicle registration and administers driver training, testing, and driver licensing. \n \nC. \n\nPolicy and Legal Frameworks \n\n11. \nAfghanistan  is  yet  to  formulate  a  transport  policy.  However,  the  Afghanistan  National \nDevelopment  Strategy  (ANDS),  which  was  launched  in  April  2008,  guides  investment  and \nreforms  in  the  sector.  In  the  road  subsector,  the  MPW  Strategy  under  the  ANDS  calls  for \ninvestments  to  upgrade  and  maintain  the  ring  road  and  roads  to  neighboring  countries  by  the \nend  of  2009,  as  well  as  to  establish  a  fiscally  sustainable  system  for  road  maintenance  using \nprivate  contractors  as  much  as  possible  by  2008.  Also,  it  calls  for  40%  of  all  villages  to  be \nconnected  by  all-weather  roads  to  the  national  road  system  and  40%  of  all  roads  in \nmunicipalities to be improved to a good standard by 2010. The current situation is that 86% of \n\n \n\n\f34 \n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nthe regional road network is scheduled for completion by end-2008 and the remaining length will \ncompleted by 2009 or 2010. \n \n12. \nIn  addition  to  the  Civil  Aviation  Law,  Law  of  Highway  Traffic,  Law  on  Regulating \nMovement  and  Function  of  Land  Transportation  Vehicles,  Law  for  Punishment  of  Transport \nViolators,  and  Law  for  International  Transit  and  Transport,  which  have  direct  relevance  to  the \nsector,  much  new  legislation  affecting  its  performance  has  been  enacted  or  existing  laws \namended in the past 5 years. Among these are the Environment Law, Law on Preservation of \nHistoric and Cultural Artifacts, Customs Law, Procurement Law, and the Law on Taxing Driving \nPermits for Motor Vehicles. \n \nD. \n\nChallenges and Opportunities in the Road Subsector \n\nDonors  have  invested  an  estimated  $3  billion  on  improving  roads  and  building  road \n13. \nsubsector institutions in Afghanistan. The contribution of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nthese efforts stood at over $600 million by the end of 2007. There are positive signs and strong \nevidence  of  the  contribution  of  the  road  subsector  to  fostering  economic  growth  and  reducing \nprovincial  disparities.  The  reduction  in  travel  time  due  to  the  improved  regional  roads  has \nreportedly increased the frequency of personal trips and domestic trade. MPW is preparing for \nthe creation of the Afghanistan Highway Authority to function as a road network manager with \nall works outsourced to private contractors. \n \nHowever, the road network, with a density of 4 km per 1,000 km2 of land and only 7% of \n14. \nit paved, is inadequate to spur economic growth. Four provincial capitals remain unconnected to \nthe regional network, which provides access to domestic and regional markets, and more than \n70%  of  the  interprovincial  and  interdistrict  roads  remain  in  a  poor  state.  Many  roads  are \nimpassable by motor vehicles, and people in the mountainous central part of the country do not \nhave all-weather access to the main road network. Likewise, transport services are inadequate, \nof low quality, and expensive. \n \n15. \nAs depicted in the problem tree in Figure A2, this situation is a consequence of myriad \ndeficiencies  in  policy,  legal,  institutional,  and  regulatory  frameworks.  Corrections  to  these \ndeficiencies  may  take  many  years  to  design,  finance,  and  implement.  For  instance,  almost  \n$1  billion  more  is  needed  to  fully  implement  the  road  sector  component  of  ANDS.  First  and \nforemost, there should be a transport policy that is in accordance with the cultural, social, and \npolitical characters of the people and governments. \n \nIn  the  interim,  road  investment  efficiency  should  be  increased  by  shortening  project \n16. \ncycles  and  adhering  to  budgets.  This  requires  the  use  of  innovative  technical  designs, \nprocurement  planning,  contracting  methods,  and  monitoring  schemes.  Donors,  including  ADB, \nare financing advisory services that could facilitate the use of these approaches, but, in the long \nterm, MPW\u2019s overall business process has to be revised. This includes the processes in such \nnonoperational  areas  as  public-relations  and  marketing,  as  well  as  to  reform  the  pricing  and \nregulatory  policies  of  MOTCA  or  the  entity  that  would  eventually  be  responsible  for  these \nfunctions.  The  main  donors,  by  remaining  engaged  with  the  Government,  coordinating  their \nactivities, and facilitating change within MPW, can help provide equal accessibility and mobility \nin all parts of Afghanistan by 2020. \n \n\n \n\n\fFigure A2: Problem Tree Analysis of the Road Subsector \n\nContinuing Conflict\n\nPersistent Poverty\n\nProvincial Economic \nand Social Disparity \n\nLack and High Cost of \nTransport Services\n\nLow Density and \nConnectivity of Roads\n\nArchaic Tariff and \nLicensing Structures \n\nHigh Capital Cost of \nVehicles\n\nLack of Service \nInformation to Users\n\nDispersed Population\n\nHigh Cost of \nConstruction\n\nInadequate Landuse \nPlanning\n\nInadequate \nMaintenance\n\nMulti-Agency and Multi-\nJurisdictional \nR\n\nibilit\n\nWeak Regulatory \nCapacity of MOTCA\n\nLimited Leasing and \nFinancing Options\n\nDifficult Terrain\n\nLack of Sector \nCoordination \n\nLack of Experienced \nContractors\n\nInadequate Donor \nCoordination\n\nHigh Import Duties\n\nLack of Scientific \nMaintenance Program \n\nInadequate Oversight \nby MPW\n\nLack of Technical \nPersonnel/Experience\n\nIrregular and \nInsufficient Funds\n\nHighly Centralized \nDecision-Making \n\nSecurity Threat\n\nInadequate Oversight \nby MPW\n\nAbsence of Timely \nFinancing \n\nInfant National \nConstruction Industry\n\nRising Price of \nMaterials\n\nMOTCA = Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, MPW = Ministry of Public Works. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n2\n\n \n\n3\n5\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f36 \n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nA. \n\nRoad Map \n\nROAD MAP AND INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\n1. \nIn  April  2008,  the  Government  of  Afghanistan  (the  Government)  launched  the \nAfghanistan National Development Strategy (ANDS) with the aim of fostering economic growth \nthrough  systematic  investments  in  infrastructure  and  governance  improvements  in  the  next  \n5  years,  among  other  measures.  ANDS  is  the  country\u2019s  overarching  strategy  for  promoting \ngrowth, generating wealth, and reducing poverty and vulnerability. It has many components and \ntargets for the key sectors of the economy to be achieved between 2008 and 2020. The road \nsector  component  of  ANDS,  known  as  the  MPW  (Ministry  of  Public  Works)  Strategy,  commits \nthe  Government  of  Afghanistan  (the  Government)  to  (i)  developing  a  network  of  all-weather \nroads,  constructed  to  national  standards;1 (ii)  preserving  of  the  road  network  through  better \nmaintenance;  (iii)  outsourcing  all  civil  works  and  specialized  technical  services  to  the  private \nsector;  (iv)  greater  cooperation  with  neighboring  governments  and  departments;  and  \n(v)  reforming  MPW.  It  calls  for  physical  investments  to  improve  all  key  regional  and  national \nroads including (i) completion of the so-called \u201cring road\u201d, which is the circular regional road with \nlinks to all the neighboring countries; and (ii) improvements to the remaining national roads that \nlink the provincial capitals to the regional road network listed in Table A3.1. This strategy would \nenhance  network  connectivity  to  a  basic  level,  which  in  turn  would  help  expand  domestic  and \nregional  trade  and  also  overcome  provincial  disparities  while  providing  mobility  to  more \nAfghans.  ANDS  also  calls  for  half  of  the  villages  to  be  connected  to  a  national  road  by  all-\nweather roads and for 40% of all municipal roads to be in good condition by 2010.  \n \n2. \nfactors:  \n(i)  capacity  of  MPW  (which  is  in  charge  of  regional,  national,  and  provincial  roads)  and  of  the \nMinistry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development (which is responsible for rural roads planning, \nprocuring works and services, and overseeing works); (ii) timely availability of resources (labor, \nmaterial, and financing); (iii) efficiency of passenger and freight transport services; and (iv) the \nsecurity  situation  in  the  country.  For  these  reasons,  the  MPW  Strategy  also  calls  for  key \nnonphysical  investments  to  improve  institutional  capacity,  governance,  fiduciary  controls,  and \nroad network management skills at MPW. Furthermore, the MPW Strategy calls for creating the \nAfghanistan Highway Authority (AHA) plus revising tariffs and vehicles licensing to increase the \nefficiency  of  road  transport  services  by  2013.  Moreover,  ongoing  works,  which  have \nexperienced cost escalations due to increases in materials prices, are scheduled for completion \nin 2010. \n \nB. \n\ntargets  depends  upon  several \n\nStrategic Context \n\nRealization  of \n\nimprovement \n\nthese  road \n\n3. \nAfghanistan provides access to trade along the North\u2013South Asia and East\u2013West Asia \ncorridors,  especially  in  Central  Asia.  It  also  plays  a  special  role  in  the  Central  Asia  Regional \nEconomic Cooperation (CAREC) program, which supports investments in transport, energy, and \ntrade. Roads connect Afghanistan to the outside world, but they also connect cities, towns, and \nvillages within the country. Road sector investments are visible and yield results, both tangible \nand  intangible.  They  increase  the  impacts  of  the  other  two  sectors  that  ADB  supports  in \nAfghanistan, namely energy and agriculture, by linking markets, products, and people. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1  Ministry of Public Works. 2007. Afghanistan Interim Road Standards. Kabul. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n37\n\nC. \n\nPolicy Framework \n\n4. \nThe national transport policy is presently guided by the MPW Strategy that outlines the \nprinciples and vision of the transport sector. The MPW Strategy forms the basis for further policy \nmaking following the enactment of legislation in 2008 to bring all modes of transport under one \numbrella ministry. \n \nD. \n\nInvestment Program \n\nThe  Road  Network  Development  Investment  Program  (the  Investment  Program)  is  an \n5. \nintegral part of the MPW Strategy. That strategy sets out several ambitious targets and timelines \nfor  the  road  subsector,  the  main  ones  being  to  construct  more  than  5,000  km  of  national  and \nprovincial  roads  by  2011,  set  up  a  fiscally  sustainable  road  maintenance  system  to  effectively \nand  efficiently  maintain  7,000  km  of  roads  within  1  year,  improve  safety,  implement  a \ntransparent  cost  recovery  plan,  and  achieve  structural  reform  of  MPW.  The  MPW  Strategy \nwould,  by  improving  basic  road  network  connectivity,  increase  efficiency  of  travel  and  trade \nwithin the country and with its neighbors, thereby relieving some of Afghanistan\u2019s economic and \nsocial  constraints  of  being  landlocked.  The  key  national  roads  that  must  be  improved  to  meet \nthis goal are shown in Table A3.1. The indicative investment plan is shown in Table A3.2 and \nthe  indicative  schedule  of  nonphysical  investments  is  shown  in  Table  A3.3.  In  concert,  the \nphysical  and  nonphysical  investments  will  improve  transport  efficiency  and  reduce  provincial \nincome disparities. \n \n6. \n(e.g. \nimprovements to water wells, drinking water, schools, and clinics) are a special feature. This is \na  win-win  proposition  for  all\u2014the  Government,  contractors,  and  consultants\u2014due  to  greater \nbuy-in  from  the  villages  and  thus  lower  security  risks.  The  Government  will  fund  these \ninvestments to coincide with the implementation schedule for the larger investments.  \n \nE. \n\nin  small-scale,  community-level \n\ninfrastructure  and  services, \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nInvestments \n\n7. \nImplementation  of  the  Investment  Program  over  the  medium  term  is  estimated  to  cost \nabout  $1.25  billion.  As  shown  in  Table  A3.4,  about  $950  million  of  that  amount  is  available  at \npresent  for  part  of  that  investment.  The  Government  is  actively  pursuing  other  financing \nopportunities to enable the Investment Program to be fully implemented. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fTable A3.1: Roads Programmed for Improvement (2008\u20132013)\n\nYear\n\nRoad Number \n\n       From \n\n      To\n\n    Province\n\nNotes\n\nLength \n(km)\n\nEstimated \nCost \n($ million)\n\n     RH05\n     NH43\n\n   Kabul\n   Fayzabad\n\n   Jalalabad\n   Ishkashim\n\n    Nangerhar\n    Badakhshan\n\n      160                90  Detailed design completed\n      100                50  Detailed design completed\n\n     NH05/20\n\n   Dara I Suf\n\n   Yakawlang\n\n    Bamyan\n\n      180              120 \n\n   Jabalussaraj \n\n  Sorubi \n\n   Kapisa\n\n       90                50  Detailed design completed\n\n   Mihtarlam (RH05)\n\n   Nuristan \n\n    Laghman\n\n      100                70 \n\nWorks to be procured under \ndesign-build contract\n\nLinks Nuristan capital to \nregional highway \n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n     NH04\n\n     NH02\n\n     NH41A\n     NH44\n     NH42\n     NH05\n     NH21\n     NH11\n\nMaintenance\n\n\u2014 = not available, km = kilometer.\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.\n\n   Dara I Suf\n   Taluqan \n   Khulm\n   Chaharikar\n   Larshkar Ghah\n   Sharan\n\n  Bamyan\n   Yangi Qala\n  Kunduz\n   Bamyan\n  Khanishim\n   Zurmat\n\n   Samangan\n    Takhar\n   Kunduz\n    Parwan\n   Hilmand\n    Paktiya\n\nSubtotal\n\nTotal \n\n     150              150 \n      100                90 \n     130                60 \n      160              110 \n     160                90 \n        50                30 \n  1,380              910 \n   1,500              300 \n  2,880           1,210 \n\n3\n8\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n3\n \n\ni\n\nMaster Plan \nRating     \n\n(100 max)\n\u2014\n76\n\n\u2014\n85\n\n82\n\n77\n90\n89\n87\n82\n79\n\n \n\n \n\n\fTable A3.2: Indicative Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nInvestment  \nA.

the subprojects: \n(i) \n\nThe  Ministry  of  Public  Works  (MPW)  initially  selects  and  appraises  roads  or \nsections  of  road  classified  as  either  regional  or  national  to  be  improved \n(upgraded, repaired, or rehabilitated) or maintained as part of a project financed \nfor  the  multitranche  financing  facility  (MFF),  Staff  and  consultants  of  MPW\u2019s \nprogram  management  office  (PMO)  will  perform  the  relevant  studies  and \nanalyses  and  confirm  that  the  proposed  project  meets  the  eligibility  criteria \noutlined below. \nIn  consultation  with  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF),  relevant  national  and \nprovincial agencies, and the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the deputy minister \n(technical) of MPW will carry out an annual review to prioritize and, if necessary, \nrevise  proposed  projects,  then  the  deputy  minister  will  prepare  (or  update)  the \nRoad  Network  Development  Investment  Program  for  the  following  3  years,  with \nemergency and ancillary works programmed for immediate implementation. \nBased  on  the  priorities,  MPW,  in  consultation  with  MOF,  will  select  a  given \nproject. The PMO will appraise that project and prepare a draft report (ADB and \nMPW will agree on the facility administration memorandum at the inception of the \nMFF, which sets out the reporting format) and a draft periodic financing request \n(PFR)  to  fund  one  or  more  of  the  following  components  of  the  projects:  studies \n(repair, \nand  designs,  project  management, \nrehabilitation,  or  reconstruction),  ancillary  and  emergency  works,  infrastructure \nmaintenance,  and  capacity  development  and  institutional  reforms  (nonphysical \ninvestments). \n\ninfrastructure \n\nimprovement \n\nEligibility Criteria \n\n1. \n\nInfrastructure Improvement \n\nTo be eligible for financing under this component, a subproject must \n(i) \n\nfrom  ADB \n\nfor  purely  price  or \n\nbe (a) identified and programmed under ANDS, or (b) an existing ADB-financed \nroad  construction  or  rehabilitation  project  that  is  eligible  for  supplementary \nfinancing \nfinancing  arrangement  changes \n(Preference  will  be  given  to  subprojects  that  are  part  of  a  strategic  or \ninternational link or a regional corridor);  \nhave been studied and designed in accordance with the requirements stipulated \nin  the  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  (EARF)  and  the \nresettlement  framework,  as  well  as  found  to  be  socially,  environmentally  and \neconomically viable, and financially sustainable; and \nhave  been  reviewed  and  approved  by  MOF  and,  if  necessary,  other  relevant \nnational,  provincial,  and \nthe \nenvironmental, technical, and social criteria, or it must be that approvals will be \nobtained  in  time  for  the  project\u2019s  or  program\u2019s  implementation  schedules  to  be \nmaintained. \n \nAncillary and Emergency Works \n\nlocal  government  agencies  responsible \n\nfor \n\n3. \n\nTo be eligible for financing under this component, a subproject must \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n2. \n\n \nB. \n\n2. \n\n \n\n\f42 \n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nbe  an  integral  part  of  a  national  or  regional  road  that  (a)  has  not  been \nprogrammed  for  construction  or  improvement  under  ANDS,  or  (b)  is  already \nunder improvement with ADB financing under the Facility;  \nrequire  improvements  due  to  (a)  recent  physical  destruction  or  damage  arising \nfrom  the  ongoing  conflict,  and/or  (b)  a  newly  arisen  and  urgent  need  to  provide \naccess to strategically important area(s) or  maintain  connectivity  of  the  regional \nand/or national network; and \nhave  been  studied  and  or  fully  designed  in  accordance  with  national  standards \nand  the  requirements  stipulated  in  the  EARF  and  the  resettlement  framework, \nand  found  to  be  socially,  environmentally  and  economically  viable,  as  well  as \nfinancially sustainable.  \n\n3. \n\nMaintenance Works \n\nTo be eligible for financing under this component, a subproject must be \n(i) \n(ii) \n\nan integral part of a regional or national road; and \na  road  that  has  been  improved,  or  will  be  improved,  with  financing  from  ADB, \nMPW, or another development partner.  \n\nMoreover, works must \n(i) \n\ninclude  periodic  and  or  routine  maintenance  according  to  specific  national \nstandards for a period of at least 3 years; and \nbe carried out by competitively selected national or international contractors. \n\n(ii) \n\nApproval Process \n\nThe following sequence will be followed to obtain ADB\u2019s approval of a PFR: \n(i) \n\nThe deputy minister (technical) of MPW will submit the draft appraisal report and \nthe draft PFR to ADB, together with supporting documents.

However,  the  lowest  bids  ($76  million)  were  substantially  higher  than  the  estimated \nvalues  of  the  packages  stated  in  the  report  and  recommendation  of  the  President  (RRP). \nTherefore,  award  of  contracts  resulted  in  a  funding  gap  of  $26.2  million.

The \nassessment  aimed  to  determine  the  impact  on  the  economic  benefits  of  supplementary \nfinancing that is provided to complete physical works in the subprojects. This was assessed in \nrelation  to  the  net  present  values  (NPVs),  economic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRRs),  and  the \nsensitivities of the NPVs and EIRRs to further increases in costs and decreases in benefits. \n \n2. \nEconomic analyses of the subprojects were conducted during appraisal of these projects \nin  2003,  2004,  and  2006.  These  analyses,  contained  in  the  corresponding  reports  and \nrecommendations  of  the  President,  indicated  that  the  subprojects  are  economically  viable. \nTable A9.1 summarizes the economic analyses. \n\n \n\nTable A9.1: Summary of Economic Analyses \n\nEIRR (%) NPV ($ million) \n\nItem \nLoan 2140 (Year 2004) \nContracts 2 and 3 \n \nLoan 2257 (Year 2006)b \nMazar-e-Sharif\u2013Dara-i-Suf Section \nBamian\u2013Yakawlang Section \n \n \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value. \na  Against the previous project cost estimates as given in the PFR-1. \nb  EIRR and NPVs as calculated from the  cost  and  benefit  streams  given  in  the \n\n \n54.8a \n \n \n82.3 \n28.2 \n \n110.6 \n\n \n19.1 \n \n \n29.9 \n20.6 \n \n25.8 \n\nTotal Project \n\nRRP for Loan 2257. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n3. \nThe previous analyses were carried out following Asian Development Bank\u2019s guidelines \nby  comparing  the  with-  and  without-project  scenarios  that  weighed  the  savings  in  vehicle \noperating costs and travel time costs gained from each subproject against the initial investment \ncosts and the savings in future periodic and routine maintenance costs over a 20-year period. \nThe  cost  and  benefits  were  estimated  according  to  base  year  traffic  and  projected  traffic  over \nthe subprojects\u2019 life horizons, exiting pavement conditions, design parameters, and unit value of \ntravel time. The economic analyses indicated that the subprojects would provide between 19% \nand 25% returns, with correspondingly large positive NPVs, and that the results would be quite \nrobust. \n \n4. \nthe subprojects as shown in Table A9.2 to meet the cost increases due to: \n\nThe estimated supplementary financing of $60 million will be allocated to civil works of \n\n(i) \n\nbid prices being higher than available funds for improvement of the  Andkhoy  to \nQaisar section of the ring road implemented under Loan 2140, and \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2004.

Consequently, within the \ncontext  of  the  continuing  efforts  by  Afghanistan  to  improve  environmental  protection  in  the \ncountry,  the  EARF  will  be  periodically  reviewed  and  revised,  in  consultation  with  ADB,  on  the \nbasis  of  experience  gained  during  implementation  and  changes,  if  any,  in  Afghanistan\u2019s  or \nADB\u2019s  policies,  regulations,  and  institutional  arrangements.  Revisions  may  also  be  introduced \nduring the preparation of periodic financing requests for subsequent tranches. \n \nB. \n\nEnvironmental Criteria for Subproject Selection \n\n3. \n\nSubprojects selected for financing the MMF shall: \n(i) \n\navoid passing through any designated wildlife sanctuaries, national parks, other \nsanctuaries,  or  area  of  international  significance  (e.g.,  protected  wetland \ndesignated by the Wetland Convention); and \navoid, as much as possible, passing through any cultural heritage designated by \nUNESCO.  \n\n(ii) \n\n \nC. \n\n \n\nEnvironmental Assessment Requirements \n\n1. \n\nNational Environmental Policies \n\n4. \nThe Government of Afghanistan (the Government) approved and adopted the first-ever \nenvironmental framework law in 2005 (i.e., Environment Act, 2005) with an aim to include and \naddress  environmental  issues  in  the  process  of  development.  Subsequently,  the  National \nEnvironmental  Protection  Agency  (NEPA),  an  independent  agency,  was  set  up  in  2005  for \nenvironmental governance in the country. NEPA has overall responsibility to address policy and \nlegal  issues  as  well  as  environmental  management  in  coordination  with  other  related \ndepartments. NEPA reports directly to the Office of the President. \n \n5. \nIn  coordination  with  other  government  offices  and  external  agencies,  NEPA  is  in  the \nprocess  of  drafting  environmental  regulations  and  guidelines  for  the  country\u2019s  environmental \nmanagement.  Presently,  there  exist  the  following  environmental  regulations,  guidelines,  and \npolicies in Afghanistan:  \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nEnvironmental Law, 2006, Islamic Republic of Afghanistan; \nInterim Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations, NEPA, Islamic Republic \nof Afghanistan; \nAdministrative  Guidelines \nImpact \nAssessments, March 2007 (draft 2): NEPA, Islamic Republic of Afghanistan; and \nEnvironmental \nto \nEnvironmental Impact Assessment in Afghanistan,\u201d August 2006, NEPA, Islamic \nRepublic of Afghanistan. \n\nthe  Preparation  of  Environmental \n\nImpact  Assessment  Policy\u2014\u201cAn \n\nIntegrated  Approach \n\nfor \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n63\n\nEnvironment  Act,  2005.  The  Environment  Act  was  approved  by  the  Cabinet  in \n6. \nDecember  2005.  The  Act  contains  the  tailor-made  legal  frameworks  needed  to  sustainably \nmanage  Afghanistan\u2019s  natural  resources  and  rehabilitate  its  damaged  environment.  The  Act \nalso  clarifies  institutional  responsibilities  and  contains  the  compliance  and  enforcement \nprovisions required to allow the Government to enforce the legislation. The law is a fundamental \nprerequisite to enable NEPA to fulfill its mandate. The primary objectives of the Act are to \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\nimprove living conditions and protect the health of humans, fauna, and flora; \nmaintain ecological functions and evolutionary processes; \nsecure the needs and interests of present and future generations; \nconserve natural and cultural heritages; and \nfacilitate  the  reconstruction  and  sustainable  development  of  the  national \neconomy.  \n\n \n7. \nThe Environment Act was developed by NEPA over a period of 2 years with the support \nand  technical  advice  of  the  United  Nations  Environment  Programme  (UNEP)  and  the \nInternational Union for Conservation of Nature and international experts. UNEP also facilitated \nan  extensive  national  consultation  process  on  the  draft  act  with  all  national  stakeholders \n(ministries, quasi-government agencies, and civic society) and other  interested  parties  (United \nNations  agencies,  ADB,  World  Bank,  International  Union  for  Conservation  of  Nature,  United \nStates  Agency  for  International  Development).  UNEP  is  supporting  NEPA  in  developing \nregulations  subsequent  to  the  Environment  Act  (particularly  in  the  fields  of  environmental \nimpact  assessment,  integrated  pollution  control,  and  compliance  and  enforcement)  and \nthe  institutional  processes  and  systems  required  to  adequately  and  effectively  implement \nthe Environment Act. \n\n \n8. \nAdministrative Guidelines for Preparation of Environmental Impact Assessments, \nMarch 2007 (Draft 2). The guidelines are in a draft form prepared by NEPA in coordination with \nUNEP.  The  purpose  of  the  guidelines  is  to  provide  guidance  to  project  proponents  while \nundertaking  development  projects  that  may  have  potential  impacts  on  the  environment.  \nThey  also  provide  guidance  on  how  the  public  should  be  consulted  and  define  the  roles  and \nresponsibilities of various stakeholders in that process. \n\n \nEnvironmental \n\nIntegrated  Approach \n\nImpact  Assessment  Policy\u2014\u201cAn \n\nto \n9. \nEnvironmental  Impact  Assessment  in  Afghanistan,\u201d  August  2006. NEPA, with assistance \nfrom  UNEP,  has  developed  the  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  policy.  The  policy \nstipulates  broad  guidelines  for  project  proponents  on  integrating  EIA  into  the  process  of \ndevelopment, and procedures to address environmental consequences and  involve  necessary \ninstitutions in the process of project implementation. The policy has yet to be approved by the \nCabinet (Ministry of Justice), which is necessary for it to obtain  statutory  status  with  regard  to \nproject proponents. \n \n10. \nInterim  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  Regulations,  NEPA  (Draft  2.3).  These \nregulations  govern  the  process  of  environmental  impact  assessment  in  Afghanistan  on  an \ninterim  basis  pending  establishment  of  the  EIA  board  of  experts  under  Article  20  of  the \nEnvironment  Law  and  issuing  of  final  regulations.  These  regulations  provide  the  detailed \nprocess  of  EIA  and  divide  the  projects  into  categories  A  and  B  based  on  potential  impacts.  \nIn  accordance  with  Article  13(1)  of  the  Environment  Law,  these  regulations  apply  to  the \nfollowing prohibited activities: \n\n(i) \n\nCategory A activities, set out in Schedule I of the Regulations, are those activities \nlikely  to  have  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  that  are  sensitive, \n\n \n\n\f64 \n \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nto  have  significant  adverse \n\ndiverse, or unprecedented, and that will impact a broader area than the sites or \nfacilities subject to the physical works of the activity. \nCategory B activities, set out in Schedule I of the Regulations, are those activities \nlikely \nimpacts  on  human  environments  or \nenvironmentally  sensitive  areas  that  are  less  adverse  than  those  of  category  A \nactivities, are site-specific, and in most instances are not irreversible. \nAny activity that is likely to have significant adverse impact on the environment of \nan  area  that  has  been  determined  by  NEPA  to  be  an  environmentally  sensitive \narea.  \nAny  other  activity  that  is  likely  to  have  a  significant  adverse  impact  on  the \nenvironment and is determined by NEPA to be a prohibited activity.  \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n2. \n\nADB Environmental Safeguards Requirements \n\n11. \nEnvironment Policy (2002). ADB\u2019s Environment Policy mandates consideration for the \nenvironment in all aspects of ADB operations. The Environment Policy and Operations Manuel \n(OM)  20:  Environmental  Considerations  in  ADB  Operations  outlines  ADB\u2019s  environmental \nassessment  procedures  and  requirements.  To  facilitate  implementation  of  the  Environment \nPolicy and OM 20, environmental assessment guidelines were prepared.  \n \n12. \nEnvironmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003).  These  guidelines  provide  a  holistic \napproach  for  the  user  for  integrating  environmental  considerations  into  ADB  operations.  They \nprovide  project  categorization  and  procedures  to  undertake  environmental  impact  assessment \nbased on significant potential impacts. ADB categorizes projects into categories A, B, C, and FI \naccording to the significance of likely impacts. The categorization criteria are as follow: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nCategory  A.  Projects  with  potential  for  significant  adverse  environmental \nimpacts: An EIA is required to address significant impacts. \nCategory B. Project judged to have some adverse impacts, but of lesser degree \nand/or significance than category A: An initial environmental examination (IEE) is \nimpacts \nto  determine  whether  or  not  significant  environmental \nrequired \nwarranting an EIA are likely. If an EIA is not needed, the IEE is regarded as the \nfinal environmental assessment report. \nCategory C. Projects unlikely to have adverse impacts: No EIA or IEE required, \nalthough environmental implications are still reviewed. \nCategory  FI.  Projects  are  classified  as  category  FI  if  they  involve  a  credit  line \nthrough  a \nfinancial \nintermediary.  The \nintermediary  must  apply  an  environmental \nmanagement system, unless all subprojects will result in insignificant impacts. \n\nintermediary  or  an  equity \n\ninvestment \n\nfinancial \n\nfinancial \n\nin  a \n\n \n13. \nfinanced under the MFF will be subject to the following requirements: \n\nBased  on  the  Government\u2019s  and  ADB\u2019s  environmental  policies,  the  projects  to  be \n\nA requirement for environmental assessment of each subproject depends on its \npotential  impacts.  Based  on  these  potential  impacts,  and  using  ADB\u2019s  rapid \nenvironmental assessment, a subproject will be classified in accordance with the \nGovernment\u2019s and ADB\u2019s environmental assessment guidelines.  \nFor  each  category  A  project,  an  EIA  including  an  EMP  is  required.  For  each \ncategory B project, an IEE including EMP is required. \nA project will be categorized as A if the project \n(a) \n\nrequires  a  complex  mitigation  measure  needing  to  be  prepared  through \nan  in-depth  assessment  of  the  impacts  and  detailed  study  for  preparing \nmitigation measures;  \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n65\n\n(b) \n\nwill  generate  impact  on  an  ecologically  sensitive  area,  particularly  if  the \nproject  (1)  passes  through  or  is  located  less  than  100  meters  from  any \ndesignated  wildlife  sanctuary,  national  park,  other  sanctuary,  botanical \ngarden,  or  area  of  international  significance  (e.g.,  a  protected  wetland \ndesignated by the Wetland Convention); (2) is located within 300 meters \nof a coastline; or (3) passes through any cultural heritage designated by \nUNESCO; or \ninvolves establishment of a bypass or new alignment passing through any \necologically  sensitive  areas  (hilly  or  mountainous,  forested,  wetlands, \nnearby estuarine, or other area with important ecological function). \nRoad  upgrading  and  rehabilitation  subprojects  that  do  not  fall  into  the  above \nclassification are classified as B. \n\n(c) \n\nEnvironmental Assessment Review Procedures and Authorities\u2019 Responsibilities \n\nThe Project will be implemented by MPW through the PMO and project implementation \n\n1. \n\nMPW\u2019s Responsibilities \n\n15.  MPW will be responsible for the following: \n\nPrepare  environmental  screening  checklist  and  classify  projects  in  consultation \nwith NEPA and other departments. \nBased on the environmental classification of projects, prepare terms of reference \nto conduct IEE or EIA studies. \nHire  an  environmental  consultant  to  prepare  IEE  or  EIA  reports  including  EMP \nand summary EIA for public disclosure.  \nEnsure that an IEE or EIA are prepared in compliance with the requirements of \nthe Government and ADB, and that adequate consultation with affected people is \nundertaken in accordance with ADB requirements. \nUndertake  review  of  the  IEE  or  EIA,  summary  EIA,  and  EMP  reports  to  ensure \ntheir compliance with the requirements of the Government and ADB. \nObtain  necessary  permits  and/or  clearance,  as  required,  from  NEPA  and  other \nrelevant government agencies, ensuring that all necessary regulatory clearances \nare obtained before commencing any civil work on the relevant sections. \nSubmit  to  ADB  the  IEE  or  EIA,  summary  EIA,  and  EMP  reports  and  other \ndocuments, as necessary.  \n\n(x) \n\n(ix) \n\nthat  contractors  understand \n\n(viii)  Ensure  that  any  EMP  including  relevant  mitigation  measures  needing  to  be \nincorporated during the construction stage by  the  contractor  are  included  in  the \nbidding documents. \nEnsure  that  contractors  have  access  to  the  EIA  or  IEE  and  EMP  reports  of  the \nprojects. \nEnsure \nenvironmental problems associated with their construction activities.  \nEnsure and monitor that an EMP including an environmental monitoring plan will \nbe properly implemented.  \nIn  case  unpredicted  environmental \nthe  project \nimplementation  stage,  prepare  and  implement  as  necessary  an  environmental \nemergency  program  in  consultation  with  NEPA,  any  other  relevant  government \nagencies, and ADB. \nIn  case  a  project  needs  to  be  realigned  during  implementation,  review  the \nenvironmental  classification,  revise  it  accordingly,  and  identify  whether  a \n\nimpacts  occur  during \n\nresponsibilities \n\nto  mitigate \n\ntheir \n\n(xiii) \n\n(xii) \n\n(xi) \n\n \nD. \n\n14. \nunits.  \n \n \n\n(iv) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n \n\n\f66 \n \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nsupplementary  IEE  or  EIA  study  is  required.  If  yes,  prepare  the  terms  of \nreference for undertaking a supplementary IEE or EIA and hire an environmental \nconsultant to carry out the study. \n\n(xiv)  Submit  annual  reports  on  implementing  EMPs,  including  implementation  of  an \n\nenvironmental emergency program, if any, to NEPA and ADB. \n\n \n\n2. \n\nADB Responsibilities \n\n16. \n\nADB is responsible for the following: \n(i) \n\nReview IEE and/or EIA reports and the rapid environmental assessment checklist \nas a basis to issue approval for the project. \nUndertake periodic monitoring of the EMP implementation and due diligence as \npart of an overall project review mission. \nIf  required,  provide  advice  to  MPW  in  carrying  out  its  responsibilities  to \nimplement the EMP for the project. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n3. \n\nCompliance with ADB\u2019s Environmental Policy\u2014Due Diligence \n\n17.  MPW  has  the  responsibility  to  undertake  environmental  due  diligence  and  monitor \nimplementation  of  environmental  mitigation  measures  for  all  projects  under  each  respective \nresponsibility. The due diligence report as well as monitoring of EMP implementation (described \nin  the  annual  report)  need  to  be  documented  systematically.  ADB  must  be  given  access  as \nneeded to undertake environmental due diligence for all projects.  \n \n \n\nPublic Disclosure \n\n4. \n\n18.  MPW  is  responsible  for  ensuring  that  all  environmental  assessment  documents, \nincluding \nthe  environmental  due  diligence  and  monitoring  reports,  are  properly  and \nsystematically kept as part of the project record of each project under its responsibility. \n \n19. \nbe made available to the public, if requested \n\nAll environmental documents are subject to public disclosure. These documents should \n\n \nInstitutional Setup and Implementation Arrangements \n\nE. \n\n \n\n1. \n\nImplementation \n\n20.  MPW  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  of  the  Investment  Program.  Project  management \nstaff of MPW have already been assigned to monitor and oversee implementation. The project \nmanagement  staff  at  present  are  headed  by  a  project  director  and  supported  by  three  project \nmanagers, an accountant, and an information technology specialist. External advisors engaged \nunder  TA  4675-AFG  will  assist  MPW  in  procurement  and  administering  construction  and \nconsultancy  service  contracts  at  the  beginning.  Subsequently,  a  fully  staffed  program \nmanagement office will be established to take over the responsibility of monitoring, coordination, \nand management of the Investment Program; auditing the accounts and financial statements of \neach project; and preparation of the various progress reports.  \n \n \n\nDue Diligence to Ensure Compliance with ADB Environment Policy \n\n2. \n\n21.  MPW will assist ADB in its periodic environmental due diligence analyses on any project \nat  any  given  time.  MPW  will  have  the  main  responsibility,  however,  for  performing  periodic \nenvironmental  due  diligence  analyses,  as  well  as  for  monitoring  the  implementation  of  all \nprojects to ensure compliance with Afghanistan\u2019s and ADB\u2019s environmental policies and overall \nenvironmental standards.  \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n67\n\n \n\n3. \n\nStaff Requirements and Resources \n\n22.  MPW will appoint or engage one or more environmental specialists to support the PMO, \nfunded  under  the  MFF.  These  specialists  will  provide  input  and  guidance  on  environmental \nmanagement and safeguards to the contractors, and will help build environmental management \ncapacity  at  the  regional  offices  of  MPW.  Adequate  funding  resources  will  be  provided  under \neach  project  for  restoring  the  environment  to  at  least  its  preconstruction  condition.  That  will \ninclude, but not be limited to, landscaping and revegetation of affected surfaces.  \n \nF. \n\nCompliance Monitoring \n\n23. \nThroughout  implementation  of  the  MFF,  the  Government  and  ADB  will  monitor  the \nimplementation  progress  and  impact  of  projects.  Overall,  the  EMP  for  each  project  will  be \nimplemented  by  the  PMO  within  MPW.  In  consultation  with  MPW  and  ADB,  the  PMO  will \nestablish  a  system  for  preparing  quarterly  reports  on  environmental  performance  monitoring, \nissues resolution, and corrective action plans.  \n \nAn  EMP  will  be  part  of  the  overall  project  monitoring  and  supervision,  and  will  be \n24. \nimplemented  by  the  supervision  consultants  with  oversight  from  the  PMO.  Progress  on  the \npreparation  and  implementation  of  an  EMP  will  be  included  in  the  periodic  project  progress \nreports.
