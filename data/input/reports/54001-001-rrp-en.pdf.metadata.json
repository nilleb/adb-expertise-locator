West Bengal\u2019s real \ngross state domestic product (GSDP) increased at a compound annual growth rate of 6.4% from \nfiscal  year  (FY)  2012  to  FY2019.  With  an  estimated  GSDP  of  \u20b911.8  trillion  ($161.6  billion)  in \nFY2019, it is India\u2019s sixth-largest state in economic size.3 However, it is also among the poorest \nstates with a per capita income of \u20b9109,491 ($1,499.1) in FY2019, compared with the all-India \naverage of \u20b9126,406 ($1,730.6).4 Although the state\u2019s fiscal situation has improved considerably, \nit remains one of India's most indebted states: its debt\u2013GSDP ratio of 33.4% in FY2019 was the \nthird highest among the general category states. \n \n4. \nWest  Bengal  Development  Finance Programs.  The Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nhas been working with the Government of West Bengal since 2012 on sustainable PFM reforms. \nThe  state\u2019s  fiscally  stressed  situation  in  2012  provided  the  rationale  for  the  West  Bengal \nDevelopment Finance Program, implemented during November 2012\u2013July 2014 and financed by \na  PBL  of  $400.0  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  (OCR)  and  a  TA  grant  of \n$0.7 million  from  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-other  sources).5 The  state \ngovernment  achieved  full  compliance  with  all  policy  actions,  and  its  commitment  to  fiscal \nconsolidation was recognized in the program's rating of successful.6 The policy reforms under the \ndevelopment finance program focused on (i) boosting revenue through eGovernance initiatives in \ncommercial  tax  administration,  and  implementing  an  excise  tax  management  system;  (ii) \n\n \n\n1  The  program is a continuation  of  the West  Bengal  Development  Finance  Program  and  the  Second  West  Bengal \nDevelopment Finance Program, and is in ADB. 2019.

The state government received several awards for its \neGovernance  system  after  the  program. 7  The  Second  West  Bengal  Development  Finance \nProgram, financed by a PBL of $300.0 million from ADB\u2019s OCR and a TA grant of $0.5 million \nfrom ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources), was approved in October \n2017.  It  carried  forward  the  reforms  of  the  first  program  and  promoted  the  private  sector\u2019s \nengagement  in  service delivery.8 It  was  completed  successfully  with  the release of the  second \ntranche in November 2019. \n \n5. \nAchievements  of  the  development  finance  programs.  The  state  finances  improved \nsignificantly  since  the  launch  of  the  first  program  in  2012.  During  FY2012\u2013FY2019,  the  fiscal \ndeficit fell from 3.4% of GSDP to 2.8%; and its quality improved substantially, as reflected in the \nratio of capital outlay to fiscal deficit, which increased from 15.6% to 70.8%.9 In the same period, \nthe state government\u2019s excise revenue, a key target area in both programs, doubled from 0.4% \nof GSDP in FY2012 to 0.9% in FY2019, while its own-tax revenue increased from 4.8% to 5.2% \nof GSDP. As a proportion of GSDP, the expenditure on salaries declined from 5.2% in FY2012 to \n3.5%  in FY2019,  and the expenditure  on  pensions fell  from  1.9% to 1.4%  in  the  same  period, \nsupported partly by the voluntary retirement scheme introduced in transport corporations under \nthe  second  program.  The  debt\u2013GSDP  ratio  decreased  from  39.9%  in  FY2012  to  33.4%  in \nFY2019. Therefore, the direction of macroeconomic policies is satisfactory.10 \n \n6. \nStructural  transformation  of  state  governance  to  continue.  The  development  and \nimplementation  of  an  integrated  financial  management  system  (IFMS)  under  the  two  finance \nprograms  was  instrumental  in  boosting  the  state  government's  operational  efficiencies  and \ntransparency. 11  To  further  sustain  the  reform  momentum,  and  for  better  integration  and \nmanagement  of  state finances,  the  state  government  is  keen  to  expand  its  coverage to state-\naided institutions, or \u201cparastatals.\u201d12 The expansion of eGovernance initiatives under the proposed \nprogram  is  expected  to  achieve  that  through  a  whole-of-government  rationalization  and \nsystemization  of  state  financial  management  processes,  particularly  the  administration  of \nfinancing for parastatals. \n \n7. \n\nWhole-of-government  perspective  lacking  in  public  financial  management.  West \n\n \n\n7  The  state  government\u2019s  Directorate  of  Commercial  Taxes  received  a  national  award  (FY2015)  for  excellence  in \ngovernment process reengineering. The Finance Department received (i) FY2014 CSI-Nihilent eGovernance awards \nfor (a) information management in commercial tax administration, and (b) a workflow-based file and letter tracking \nsystem; and (ii) the chief minister\u2019s award (2014) for the contribution to citizen-friendly tax reforms and eGovernance. \nThe Excise Department received the 2014 Skotch digital inclusion award for its online tax filing system. The state \ngovernment was acknowledged in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry\u2019s 2014 report on improving the business \nenvironment across India. \n\n8  ADB. 2017. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Policy-Based Loan \nand Technical Assistance Grant to India for the Second West Bengal Development Finance Program. Manila (Loan \n3563-IND, approved in August 2017). \n\n9  The fiscal year for a state government in India is the same as that for the national government. \n10 Sector  Assessment  (Summary):  Public  Sector  Management  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n11 The IFMS is an end-to-end project and the biggest government to government (G2G) and government to citizens \n(G2C) eGovernance initiative by the state government. Under the West Bengal Development Finance Program, four \nIFMS modules were developed that automated disbursements, salary accounts of state government employees, the \nbudget\u2013treasury interface,  and  revenue  receipts.  Subsequently,  three  new modules  related  to  budget  estimation, \nmanagement  of  schemes,  and  fund  flow  were  added  to  the  IFMS  under  the  Second  West  Bengal  Development \nFinance Program, which further enhanced the efficiency and improvement of resource management.  \n\n12 Parastatals  are  state-aided  institutions  supported  partially  or  wholly  by  the  state  government\u2019s  budget,  such  as \neducational institutions, statutory boards and corporations, and local governments (urban and rural local bodies). \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fBengal's parastatals, which are supported through grants-in-aid from the state\u2019s budget, currently \nuse  disparate  and  partly  manual  systems.  This  leads  to  inefficiencies  in  the  assessment, \nprioritization, selection, funding, and monitoring of public investment projects and schemes. Also, \nmultiple bank accounts make it difficult for the state Finance Department to monitor transactions \nunder the respective government schemes and obtain a consolidated view of the balances. This \nresulted in instances where the state Finance Department accessed Ways and Means Advances \n(WMA)\u2014a temporary loan facility provided by the Reserve Bank of India\u2014to meet its cash flow \nrequirements,  when  in  fact  unlinked  bank  accounts  had  idle  funds  available.  In  FY2019,  the \ninterest paid on WMA was $2.8 million.13  \n \n8. \nInefficient management of social protection systems. While the IFMS implementation \nunder the past programs enabled timely and accurate salary transactions for state government \nemployees, pension processing is not yet fully automated. The manual maintenance of service \nbook records often delays their updates, increases the risk of erroneous entries, and may result \nin  lost  or  damaged  service  books.  Moreover,  since  the  IFMS  is  not  integrated  with the  state\u2019s \nOffice of the Principal Accountant General (PAG), documents for pension approvals have to be \nsubmitted  physically. 14  Similarly,  the  pension  management  in  parastatals  includes  moving \ndocuments from one office to another for authorization, causing transaction delays and costs. On \naverage, it now takes parastatals about 6 months to process and disburse a pension application. \nAlso, the absence of a reliable system to verify pension entitlements can lead to calculation errors. \nSeveral  retirees  have  taken  judicial  recourse,  which  increases  the  state's  court-related  costs. \nSimilar issues arise in the manually administered provident fund for parastatals\u2019 employees. \n \n9. \nWeak resource planning and management. The second development finance program \nimplemented MTEFs in two state departments to improve strategic resource planning. An MTEF \nrequires efforts to institutionalize it and to build the capacity of government officials for using it.15 \nMoreover, project management and public works accounting is still partly manual, which lowers \nefficiency  and  increases  the  risk  of  resource  mismanagement.  Also,  while  the  past  programs \nbrought considerable progress in tax administration, taxpayer services also need improvements \nto  increase  business  activity  and  boost  tax  compliance.16 To  ensure  the  sustainability  of  PFM \nreforms,  including  learning  from  international  best  practices,  the  state  government  wishes  to \ninstitutionalize  various  aspects  of  PFM,  such  as  the  use  of  MTEFs  and  gender-responsive \nbudgeting, more thoroughly by providing specialized training to government officers.17 \n \n10. \nInadequate system integration and information management. One of the challenges \nfaced by the state government is the lack of a comprehensive management information system \n(MIS) that would ensure the availability of needs-based information on all its entities, including \nparastatals, and enable evidence-based policymaking and impact analyses of current policies. In \n\n \n\n13 Indian Institute of Management. 2017. State Finance of West Bengal.

It has a 3\u20135-year outlook with corresponding budgets (actual \nannual budget for the first year and estimated budgets for the next 3\u20135 years).  It generally sets out the strategic \npriorities  of  the  country  and  the  intended  outcomes  over  the  medium  term.  ADB.  2002.

Manila. \n\n16 New research shows that an important determinant for a firm is the ease of paying taxes, regardless of the corporate \ntax rate. The introduction of electronic systems for filing and paying taxes has cut tax compliance times globally. \nWorld Bank and PricewaterhouseCoopers. 2020. Paying Taxes 2020 Report. Washington, DC. \n\n17 The government of West Bengal runs a number of schemes for the development of women relating to education, \neconomic  rehabilitation, empowerment, and protection. The state government wants to further strengthen gender \ntargeting in its public financial management under the WBPFMRP, including building capacity in gender-responsive \nbudgeting, and adoption of MTEF in the Department of Women and Child Development and Social Welfare (para. \n28). \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nPolicy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n\nthe absence of a link between the IFMS and PAG, which has the responsibility to compile the \nstate\u2019s accounts, the state treasury must forward its documents to PAG physically, which delays \nthe  finalization  and  reconciliation  of  accounts. 18 Finally,  the  absence  of  an  online  grievance \nredress mechanism makes the filing and handling of user grievances in important service areas \nsuch as transport and urban local bodies (ULBs) inconvenient and slow. \n \n11. \nLessons.  A  key lesson from  the  implementation  of the  two  past  ADB  programs  is  that \ninvestment in eGovernance platforms yields high returns through greater operational efficiency, \nless  information  asymmetry,  better  monitoring,  less  leakage,  cost  savings,  and  better  service \ndelivery.19 Some key lessons from the Independent Evaluation Department\u2019s validation of the first \nprogram's completion report (footnote 6) are that (i) numerous and complex policy actions should \nbe avoided in favor of a clear focus on the core elements of the government\u2019s reform agenda, \n(ii) the government\u2019s sustained commitment and ownership are important, (iii) a gradual approach \nto creating fiscal space is better than a rapid and drastic fiscal adjustment, and (iv) the use of \ninformation technology is effective in enabling reforms.20 \n \nB. \n \n12. \nProgram description. The proposed program aims to create fiscal space and improve \npublic service delivery through more operational efficiencies, by (i) extending automation reforms \nto  other  state  departments  and  parastatals,  (ii)  upgrading  the  IFMS  and  integrating  it  with  the \nfinancial management systems of other agencies, and (iii) building the PFM capacity of state and \nparastatal officers. A stand-alone, two-tranche PBL supported by attached TA is considered to be \nappropriate because (i) this modality allows sequencing and continuity of policy actions over a \nperiod  of  time  in  different  functional  areas  and  government  levels;  (ii) structural  reforms  will \nimprove the efficiency of processes and the use of resources; (iii) the state government is familiar \nwith the modality from its experience with the earlier programs and has shown high commitment \nto reforms  in its  long engagement  with  ADB;  and (iv) the modality  supports the  continuity  and \nsustainability of reforms achieved under successive programs. \n \n13. \nProgram  alignment.  The  program  supports  the  Government  of  India\u2019s  overarching \ndevelopment  objective  of  making  public  services  more  accessible  through  interoperable \neGovernment  platforms.21 The  devastation  wrought  by  Cyclone  Amphan  in  May  2020  and  the \nongoing  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  crisis  stressed  the  importance  of  digital  government \noperations and processes for greater fiscal sustainability. The program is fully aligned with ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy, 2018\u20132022 for India\u2014support efficient public sector management \nin state and local bodies, and in sectors through fiscal consolidation; and improve PFM capacity.22 \nIt  also  directly  supports  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030,  such  as  operational  priority  6:  strengthening \ngovernance  and  institutional  capacity  (paras. 15\u201317);  and  operational  priority  2:  accelerating \nprogress in gender equality (para. 28). \n \n\n \n\n18 West Bengal's PAG has the following accounts-related responsibilities: (i) compile monthly civil accounts of the state, \n(ii) prepare annual finance and appropriation accounts, (iii) provide advice on technical issues, (iv) maintain provident \nfund accounts of state government employees, and (v) verify and authorize pension and other retirement benefits to \nstate government employees. \n\n19 ADB. 2015.

The  program  enabled \nonline approval of pensions by the respective authorities, including provisions for \ndigital life certification and features to obtain gender-disaggregated data of state \ngovernment  pensioners  (tranche  1).  The  state  Finance  Department  will  further \nimprove  the  efficiency  and  transparency  of  the  pension  sanction  system  by \nenabling automatic links with PAG (footnote 14) (tranche 2). \nBetter management of parastatal employees\u2019 pensions and provident fund \ncontributions.  To  process  pensions  efficiently,  an automated  ePension  system \nwas piloted in 65,000 primary and secondary educational institutions with about \n420,000 employees, and in 415 rural local bodies with about 23,000 employees \n(tranche 1). By the time the second tranche is released, the ePension system will \nbe  fully  rolled  out  in  1,000  rural  and  urban  local  bodies  and  other  autonomous \ninstitutions totaling about 180,000 employees. To manage parastatal employees\u2019 \nprovident  fund  contributions  efficiently,  the  state  government  will  implement  an \nautomated system that also allows it to obtain gender-disaggregated data (tranche \n2). \nBetter  management  of  grants  to  parastatals.  The  Finance  Department \noperationalized  an  administrative  approval  and  financial  sanction  module  within \nthe IFMS for automated administrative approval of parastatals\u2019 projects, allocation \nof funds, and monitoring of project-wise fund utilization (tranche 1). To provide in-\nprinciple  approval  of  the  detailed  reports  of  projects  and  schemes  of  ULBs,  the \nIFMS  will  be  integrated  with  the  existing  approval  system  of  ULB  schemes \n(tranche 2).  To \nthe  state  government  has \noperationalized  an  initial  version  of  the  schematic  bank  account  management \nsystem  and  registered  at  least  6,000  bank  accounts  for  efficient  public  funds \nmanagement (tranche 1). The system will be fully rolled out with additional features \nsuch  as  ePayment,  monitoring  of  grant  disbursements,  other  transactions,  and \nscheme balances within institutional accounts (tranche 2). \n\nimprove  cash  management, \n\n \n16. \nactions under this reform area will focus on: \n\nReform  area  2:  Improved  resource  planning,  management,  and  control.  Policy \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nBetter taxpayer services. The government receipt portal system (GRIPS) of the \nIFMS is an online interface for taxpayers and facilitates the real-time monitoring of \nrevenue  collection  by  the  Finance  Department.  The  Finance  Department  has \nupgraded  the  GRIPS  to  include  a  payment  gateway  and  mobile  application \n(tranche 1), and will add the following additional features for easier user access, \nbetter  user  experience,  and  stronger  compliance:  (a)  \u201cmy  profile\u201d  facility  for \nregistered users, (b) online application for refunds, (c) facility for multiple services \npayment  through  a  single  debit  transaction,  (d)  direct  payment  into  the  state \ngovernment's treasury deposit account, and (e) capture of gender-disaggregated \ndata for registered users. \nExpenditure  framework.  Continuing  the  reforms  of  the  earlier  programs,  the \nFinance Department has approved the introduction of outcome-based budgeting \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nin the Department of Women and Child Development and Social Welfare with a 3-\nyear  gender-responsive  MTEF  linked  for  the  first  year  with  the  FY2022  budget \nallocations (tranche 1).23 Accordingly, the department will finalize the MTEF and \nalso  conduct  a  gender-impact  assessment  of  at  least  two  of  its  schemes \n(tranche 2). \nBetter  project  management.  The  state  government  has  developed  an  IFMS \nmobile application for improved access to the system (tranche 1), and will add a \nmodule  for  project  management  and  public  works  accounting  to  the  IFMS  with \ngender-disaggregated  data  of  beneficiaries  to  track  the  annual  physical  and \nfinancial progress of projects (tranche 2). \nCapacity  development.  The  state  government  will  operationalize  a  center  for \nfiscal policy and public finance to continuously deepen the PFM capacity of state \ngovernment and parastatal officials in important reform areas such as MTEFs and \ngender-responsive budgeting, and sign a memorandum of understanding with at \nleast one PFM institution to provide training (tranche 2). \n\n \n17. \nactions under this reform area will focus on: \n\nReform  area  3:  Improved  information  management  and  service  delivery.  Policy \n\nManagement  information  system.  The  state  government  will  operationalize  a \ncomprehensive  MIS  for  informed  decision-making  based  on  needs-based \ninformation, including gender-related information (tranche 2). \nIntegration  of  systems.  The  state  government  has  integrated  the  payment \nmodule (ePradan)  of  the  IFMS  with  the  Reserve Bank\u2019s  upgraded  core  banking \nsolution (eKuber) for seamless processing of ePayments (tranche 1). It will also \nenable  the  IFMS's  integration  with  PAG  to  avoid  duplication  of  processes  and \nassociated transaction costs, and delays in account reconciliation.24 \nGrievance  redress  systems.  The  second  development  finance  program \nimplemented  voluntary  retirement  schemes  in transport  corporations  to  improve \nfurther  ensure  that  transport  services  are  not \noperational  efficiency.  To \ncompromised by the process but rather strengthened, an online grievance redress \nsystem  with  gender-disaggregated  data  will  be  deployed  in  all  transport \ncorporations in the state. Similar systems will be introduced in at least five ULBs \nas well (tranche 2).25 \n\n \n18. \nADB\u2019s value addition. ADB\u2019s important value addition is the application of lessons and \ninsights from the past two reform programs: (i) specifying the areas that need further support to \nbe sustainable, (ii) extending reforms to parastatals and other state departments, (iii) defining new \nreforms to meet the state government's development objectives, and (iv) strengthening gender-\nrelated  aspects.  The  program  has  particular  relevance  because  West  Bengal  is  under  severe \nfiscal  stress  after  successive  economic  shocks  from  COVID-19  and  Cyclone  Amphan.  The \nreforms will give the state government additional fiscal headroom from efficiency gains. ADB\u2019s \nstrengths also lie in its (i) accumulated expertise from conducting similar programs in South Asia, \n(ii)  focused  dialogue  with  the  governments  of  West  Bengal  and  India,  (iii)  high  standards  in \nprogram design, and (iv) capacity development through the attached TA. \n\n \n\n23 This action is a continuation of the MTEF introduction under the two earlier programs. The second program covered \nthe School Education Department and the Department of Health and Family Welfare. It is now proposed to further \ndeepen MTEF adoption and introduce it in the Department of Women and Child Development and Social Welfare. \nThe department is being targeted for its gender and social impact. \n\n24 eKuber, implemented in 2012, is among the successful central bank-oriented core banking systems in the world. \nAuctions  of  government  securities,  updates  of  WMA  positions,  and  goods  and  service  tax  settlements  are  done \nthrough eKuber. \n\n25 Once the system is demonstrated in these five ULBs, the state government can roll it out in all 125 ULBs. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fImpacts of the Reform \n\nDevelopment  coordination.  The  Department  of  Economic  Affairs  in  India's Ministry  of \n19. \nFinance  coordinates  the  activities  of  its  development  partners  to  ensure  that  effective  and \nharmonized  assistance  is  built  around  the  country\u2019s  development  agenda.  The  ADB  program \nteam  consulted  with  the  World  Bank  during  program  preparations  to  assess  complementary \nreform areas and support coordination.26 The World Bank\u2019s ongoing Institutional Strengthening of \nGram Panchayats Program II (2017\u20132022) includes a series of measures to enhance the voice \nof the people in rural local bodies for public services and complements ADB\u2019s program.27 ADB \nalso held discussions with the International Monetary Fund, which has provided its most recent \nmacroeconomic assessment for India.28 \n \nC. \n \nThe program is aligned with the following impact: better access to public services through \n20. \ninteroperable  eGovernment  platforms,  which  is  India's  overarching  development  objective \n(footnote  21).  The  effect  of  the  reform  will  be  greater  operational  efficiency  of  the  state \ngovernment\u2019s PFM system by linking the state Finance Department, parastatals, and independent \nagencies such as PAG and the Reserve Bank.29 Policy actions under reform area 1 will improve \nthe delivery of services for employees and pensioners and reduce officials\u2019 unproductive time;30 \ncut  logistics  and  judicial  proceeding  costs  through  automated  administrative  processing;  and \nenable interest savings from more effective cash management with a clear picture of parastatals\u2019 \nschemes  and  account  balances.  The  rationalized  revenue  expenditure  will  contribute  to  fiscal \nsavings for the state government. Reform area 2 will improve resource allocation, increase tax \nrevenue  and  business  activity  through  better  taxpayer  services,  and  boost  the  capacity  of  the \nstate government to implement PFM reform actions. Savings will also materialize from automated \nproject management that reduces time and cost overruns.  Reform area 3 will enable informed \nand timely decision-making based on real-time information availability. Finally, grievance redress \nsystems in transport corporations and targeted ULBs will improve service delivery.31 \n \nD. \n \n21. \nThe  development  financing  requirement  for  the  state  government  based  on  the  deficit \nprojections for FY2021\u2013FY2023, excluding the fiscal impact of COVID-19 and Cyclone Amphan, \nis  estimated  at  $17.2  billion. 32 The  financing  requirement  will  be  met  entirely  from  domestic \nsources,  including  loans  from  the  central  government,  which  will  relend  the  local  currency \nproceeds from external financing to the state government.33 Taking into consideration the state\u2019s \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs and Budget Support \n\n \n\n26 On 9\u201310 May 2020, ADB joined a public resource management roundtable in Delhi organized by the World Bank at \nthe request of India's Department of Economic Affairs. The event gave the state governments of Andhra Pradesh, \nAssam,  Chhattisgarh,  Himachal  Pradesh,  Kerala,  Odisha,  Punjab,  Rajasthan,  Uttarakhand,  and  West  Bengal  an \nopportunity to discuss their eGovernance initiatives for mutual learning. \n\n27 The projects by major development partners in West Bengal are listed in Development Coordination (accessible from \n\nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\n28 International Monetary Fund Assessment Letter (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n30 The average pension processing time in parastatals will be reduced from 180 days to 45 days. \n31 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32 The financing requirement is expected to be higher than this estimate because of the fiscal impact of COVID-19 and \nCyclone Amphan. However, the state government has submitted its fiscal impact estimates of COVID-19 and the \ncyclone  to  the  Government  of  India  for  additional  fiscal  support.  Since  the  matter  is  under  consideration,  those \nestimates have not been shared with ADB, and are not included. \n\n33 In India\u2019s federal structure, state governments enjoy strong autonomy with a clear demarcation or concurrency of \nsubjects between the central and state  governments. However, the central government determines the borrowing \nlimit for states that have outstanding loans from the central government (external financing to state governments is \nrouted through the Government of India). The annual borrowing limit for states is 3% of GSDP, which the central \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fImplementation Arrangements \n\n(i) development financing requirements, and (ii) conformity with the Government of India\u2019s policy \non counterpart financing requirements, ADB will provide a PBL of $50.0 million as budget support \nto  the  state  government.  The  policy  reforms  under  the  program  are  expected  to  augment \nrevenues and improve operational efficiencies, leading to reduced current expenditure and more \nfiscal  space.  The  program  will  thus  contribute  to  financial  sustainability  while  also  sustainably \nincreasing development spending.34 \n \n22. \nThe government has requested a regular loan of $50.0 million from ADB\u2019s OCR to help \nfinance the program. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; an \nannual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased  lending  facility;  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan and program agreements. Based on the straight-line method, \nthe average maturity is 9.25 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. The loan \nwill be disbursed in two equal tranches (para. 24). \n \nE. \n \n23. \nThe  borrower  will  be  India,  which  will  relend  the  local  currency  generated  from  the \nproceeds of the loan to the state, in accordance with the government\u2019s arrangement for transfer \nof external assistance. The governments of India and West Bengal fully concur with the state-\nlevel PBL, and the state government has sufficient policy autonomy and ability to address sector \nissues. The proceeds of the PBL will be withdrawn in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \n24. \nAs  in  the  previous  ADB  programs,  the  state  Finance  Department  will  be  the  executing \nagency. It will constitute a steering committee chaired by the Principal Secretary and including \nthe secretaries of the implementing agencies to provide overall program oversight, and resolve \ninterdepartmental issues during implementation.35 A senior official (joint secretary or above) from \nthe Finance Department will manage the program as the program director in coordination with the \neGovernance group of the Finance Department. The program director and other key officials from \nthe  Finance  Department  will  also  be  on  the  steering  committee.  ADB  will  monitor  program \nimplementation through periodic progress reports and regular missions. Procurement, advance \ncontracting,  and  retroactive  financing  are  not  expected.  The  first  tranche  of  $25  million  will  be \nreleased upon loan effectiveness, expected in November 2020. The second tranche of $25 million \nwill be released upon full compliance with the second-tranche actions, expected by 31 December \n2022. \n \n\nIII. \n\nATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n25. \nAttached transaction TA\u2014India: Supporting the West Bengal Public Finance Management \nReforms Program\u2014will assist the implementation of the program, including capacity building, and \nhelp  ensure  compliance  with  the  second-tranche  actions.  The  TA  outputs  are:  (i)  actions  to \nupgrade,  integrate,  and  expand  the  IFMS  monitored;  (ii)  gender-responsive  MTEF  developed; \nand (iii) social and gender aspects strengthened.36 The TA is estimated to cost $400,000, of which \n\n \n\ngovernment  relaxed  to  5%  in  FY2021  because  of  COVID-19.  Intergovernmental  Fiscal  Arrangements  in  India \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n34 Program Impact Summary (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n35 The Additional Chief Secretary headed the Finance Department until recently and was expected to chair the steering \ncommittee as also noted in the Development Policy Letter. With a change in his portfolio, Principal Secretary, Finance \nwill  now  head  the  department  and  the  steering  committee.    The  implementing  agencies  are  the  departments  of \nPanchayat  and  Rural  Development,  Urban  Development,  Transport,  Women  and  Child  Development  and  Social \nWelfare, and School Education. \n\n36 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f$350,000 will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-\nother sources). The state government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart \nstaff remuneration, office accommodation and supplies, local transport, other logistical support, \nand other in-kind contributions. ADB will administer the TA. The Public Management, Financial \nSector, and Trade Division of its South Asia Department will select, supervise, and evaluate the \nconsultants.  The  implementation  arrangements  for  the  TA  will  be  aligned  with  those  of  the \nprogram. The state Finance Department will carry out the overall supervision and coordination. A \ntotal of 17 person-months of consulting services (national) will be required intermittently.37 \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \n26. \nGovernance.  The  PFM  framework  of  the  state  government  is  strong.  All  departments \nfollow  the  PFM-related  national  and  state  laws,  and  all  employees  abide  by  the  conditions  of \nethics as prescribed in the state government's published gazettes.38 The regular statutory external \naudit  is  done  by  the  Office  of  the  Comptroller  and  Auditor  General  of  India  (Supreme  Audit \nInstitution of India). Budgeting is linked to fiscal targets, as specified under the West Bengal Fiscal \nResponsibility  and  Budget  Management  Act,  2010,  which  aims  to  ensure  prudence  in  fiscal \nmanagement and fiscal stability. Specific to the program, since this is a PBL, ADB financing will \nbe provided as budget support. There is no transfer of resources to the implementing agencies \nspecifically for policy actions, other than through the usual annual budgetary approval procedures. \nNo risk associated with fund flow arises. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nwas explained to and discussed with the state government's Finance Department. ADB\u2019s website \nlink  for  reporting  fraud  and  corruption  was  shared  with  the  department,  which  will  inform  the \nimplementing agencies accordingly. \n \nPoverty  and  social.  The  program\u2019s  emphasis  on  stronger  operational  efficiencies  and \n27. \npublic  service  delivery  will  positively  impact  efforts  to  lower  poverty  and  promote  social \ndevelopment.39 \n \nGender. The program is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. It aims to upgrade \n28. \nthe PFM systems to obtain gender-disaggregated data on (i) pensioners of the state government \nand parastatals, (ii) provident fund accounts, (iii) registered users of GRIPS, (iv) beneficiaries of \nstate government projects, (v) grievances submitted to transport corporations and five targeted \nULBs, and (vi) information retrieved through the MIS. In addition, at least one course will train \ngovernment officials in gender-responsive budgeting; and the capacity for expenditure targeting \nwill  be  strengthened  in the  Department  of  Women  and  Child Development  and  Social Welfare \nthrough  a  gender-responsive  MTEF  (para.  16).  The  department  will  conduct  gender  impact \nassessments for at least two schemes of the department as part of the MTEF preparation. \n \n29. \nSafeguards. Given the nature of the program, all three safeguard categories (environment, \ninvoluntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples) are C.40 The program\u2019s policy actions will not \ngenerate any environmental, involuntary resettlement, or indigenous people impacts. \n\n \n\n37 A consulting firm will be engaged using the quality- and cost-based selection method with a standard quality\u2013cost \nratio of 90:10. All consultants will be recruited in line with ADB's Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time \nto time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). All disbursements \nunder the TA will follow ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n38 The relevant regulations include (i) General Financial Rules (2017), (ii) West Bengal Financial Rules (1979), (iii) West \nBengal Treasury Rules (2005), (iv) Delegation of Financial Power Rules (1977), and (v) The West Bengal Service \nRules  (1971).

Some capacity has already been built for \nhandling operations remotely. ADB will engage with GOWB to \naddress further capacity issues. \nADB will regularly engage with the new leadership for their \nownership and support, and stress the importance of continuity \nof staff. \nTransaction technical assistance consultants will build the \ncapacity of the next level of department officials and ensure \ncontinuity if senior officials are transferred. \nGOWB will engage continually with PAG to stress the \nimportance of timely system integration. It will ensure that the \nIFMS is ready for integration with the PAG system. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank; COVID-19 = coronavirus disease; GOWB = Government of West Bengal; IFMS = \nintegrated financial management system; PAG = Office of the Principal Accountant General, West Bengal. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n \n31. \nThe Government of India and the Government of West Bengal have assured ADB that the \nimplementation  of  the  program  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those \nconcerning  anticorruption  measures, 42 safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services, \nand disbursement as described in detail in the loan agreement.
