An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was \nAssessment  undertaken. The summary IEE is a supplementary appendix.   \n   \nProject Description  The  Project,  developed  under  the  overall  framework  of  the \nGovernment of Pakistan\u2019s poverty reduction strategy outlined in its \n10-Year Perspective Development Plan 2001\u20132011, will improve \nthe living conditions and quality of life of low-income communities \nin  urban  settlements  in  southern  Punjab  province  where  (i) \ndrinking water is scarce or unsafe, (ii) sewerage systems are \ninadequate or nonexistent and wastewater treatment facilities are \nabsent,  and  (iii)  collection  and  disposal  of  solid  wastes  is \ninadequate. To achieve this goal, institutional capacity building \nand  revenue  improvement  will  first  be  provided  for  newly \nestablished  local  government  institutions,  focusing  on  greater \ndevolution of authority. Then a number of capital investments in \nbasic  urban  services  will  be  implemented,  involving  all \nstakeholders. The Project will also provide overall assistance in \nimplementation. \n \n   \nRationale  Urban areas in Pakistan are growing rapidly, and demand for \nimproved  urban  services  is  increasing.  Current  deficiencies  in \nbasic  infrastructure  inhibit  economic  growth,  and  severely \nconstrain the potential for urban areas to play a more significant \nrole  in  the  country\u2019s  economic  growth.  To  meet  the  growing \npressures and demands, urban development has usually occurred \nwith  little  or  no  environmental  controls,  and  with  forms  of \ngovernance that cannot begin to meet the responsibilities. High \nurban growth, combined with slow urban sector development, a \nlack of resources, and inadequate institutional capacity of newly \nestablished  local  government  agencies,  has  resulted  in \nuncontrolled urban sprawl; deteriorating urban environments; and \ndeficiencies in urban services including water supply, sewerage \nsystems,  drainage,  solid  waste  management,  roads,  and \ncommunity facilities.  The resulting deficiencies particularly affect \nthe urban poor and lead to a considerably reduced quality of life, \nincluding poor health and increased poverty. The incidence of \npoverty increased from 26.6% in fiscal year (FY) 1993 to 32.2% in \nFY1999. The number of poor increased by 12 million over that \nperiod. The southern Punjab region has the highest incidence of \nurban poverty in Pakistan. The Government\u2019s strategy for poverty \nreduction envisages a multipronged approach of reviving growth, \nimproving  governance,  reorienting  public  expenditures  toward \npoverty-reducing programs, and revamping the safety net system. ", "iv   \n  The  Government  is  implementing  comprehensive  governance \nreforms, with particular emphasis on enhancing the effectiveness \nof  basic  social  services  through  its  program for devolution of \npowers. The Project is formulated to support the Government\u2019s \npoverty reduction initiatives, as well as the devolution of power \nand  responsibility  to  local  governments  for  the  provision  and \nfinancing  of  urban  infrastructure  and  municipal  services.  The \nProject  incorporates  several  strategic  features  and  incentives, \nincluding  (i)  promoting  policy  reform  in  accordance  with  the \nPunjab  Local  Government  Ordinance  2001  (PLGO2001),  and \nfinancial  management  and  resource  generation  at  the  local \ngovernment level, with adoption of cost-recovery principles and \nphased elimination of subsidies; (ii) prioritizing investments that \nmeet the basic needs of urban communities; (iii) ensuring local \ncommunity participation and ownership; and (iv) promoting equity \nparticipation by local governments in the investment packages. \nThe Project also supports initiatives to foster participation of civil \nsociety,  the  private  sector,  and  nongovernment  organizations \n(NGOs); formulate a gender strategy; and develop sustainable \nplans for capacity building. \nObjectives  The  Project  intends  to  (i)  reduce  urban  poverty,  improve \ncommunity health, and reduce environmental degradation in 21 \nproject  towns  by  improving  the  water  supply,  sanitation,  solid \nwaste management, and roads for low-income communities; and \n(ii) ensure sustainability of urban investments  by strengthening \ninstitutional capacities of newly devolved local municipal agencies. \nThe  Project  is  expected  to  improve  the  living  conditions  and \nquality of life of about 3.6  million urban people, mostly in low-\nincome communities.  \nThe Project will comprise the following main components:  \n     A.  development  of  infrastructure  for  basic  urban  services, \nincluding community development and participation; and  \n      B.  institutional development, including the development of \nmunicipal management systems for local government agencies, \nsupport of project implementation, and incremental administration \nsupport.   \n  Under component A, the Project will improve infrastructure in the \nfollowing subsectors: (i) water supply, (ii) sewerage systems and \nwastewater treatment, (iii) solid waste management, (iv) road links \nfor low-income areas, (v) slaughterhouses, and  (vi) incremental \nland development for the poor. This component will also include \ncommunity  development  and  participation,  aiming  to  ensure \nsustainability of investments and to develop organizational and \nhuman capacity in local government agencies for participatory ", "  v\n  human capacity in local government agencies for participatory \nprocesses targeted to reduce poverty and provide basic needs. \n \nUnder  component  B,  municipal  staff  of  the  tehsil  municipal \nadministrations  (TMAs)  will  be  trained  in  institutional  capacity \nbuilding and revenue improvement.  \n \nThe Punjab government (PG) and the TMAs have agreed to take \nnecessary fundamental steps to (i) increase  the TMAs' revenue \nbase in a sustainable manner, and (ii) enhance and stabilize the \nTMAs\u2019  institutional  capacity  and  organizational  setup.  This \ninvolves making adjustments to fully align the TMAs\u2019 organization \nand institutional structure in accordance with the requirements of \nPLGO2001,  and  improving  overall  financial  management. \nBecause the Project\u2019s sustainability depends on these  reforms \nand adjustment measures, the TMAs and PG have agreed that \naction on them be a prerequisite for the TMAs\u2019 entry into the \nProject. Considering that TMA commitment alone will not be a \nsufficient  basis  for  a  successful  and  sustainable  investment \nprogram, PG has agreed to take pending policy actions to support \nthe TMAs in accordance with PLGO2001.  \nCost Estimates  The  estimated  project  cost  is  $128.6  million  equivalent, \ncomprising foreign exchange costs of $18.2 million (14%) and \nlocal currency costs equivalent to $110.4 million (86%). \n   \nFinancing Plan  Financing \n   \n($ million) \nSource  Foreign  Local \nTotal  % \n  Exchange  Currency \nADB  18.2  71.8  90.0  70 \nGovernment  0.0  28.3  28.3  22 \nProject Towns/ \nCommunities  0.0  10.3  10.3  8 \n Total  18.2  110.4  128.6  100 \n  ADB = Asian Development Bank \nLoan Amount and Terms  It is proposed that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provide \ntwo  loans.

The \nforeign exchange risk will, however, be borne by PG, which will \nmake the loan proceeds available to TMAs through the Local \nGovernment and Rural Development Department (LGRD) under \nthe  Provincial  Finance  Commission  (PFC)  as  a  special  grant. \nFunds to TMAs will be allocated on the basis of a TMA-specific \ninvestment plan, prepared during project preparation, and will be \nreleased subject to their meeting the eligibility and the project-\nspecific criteria, agreed with PG. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 July 2009. \n   \nEstimated Project  31 January 2009 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency   LGRD of PG \n   \nImplementation  The Executing Agency (EA)  will establish a project coordination \nArrangements  office (PCO) at its Directorate General of Katchi Abadi and Urban \nImprovement.  The  PCO,  comprising  professional  staff  with  the \nsupport of a team of consultants, will assist TMAs in providing \npolicy guidance; will undertake their institutional strengthening; will \nsupport monitoring and evaluation; and will provide TMA guidance \nin project implementing. Each TMA will establish a project unit \n(PU) to execute the infrastructure development component. Four \ntechnical support teams of consultants will help the PUs prepare \ndetailed designs, and procurement for the urban development \ncomponents. \n   \nProcurement  All  ADB-financed procurement for the Project will follow ADB's \nGuidelines for Procurement. Contracts for civil works estimated to \ncost more than $1 million equivalent will be carried out using \ninternational  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedures  while  those \nestimated to cost $1 million equivalent or less will be carried out \nunder  local  competitive  bidding  (LCB)  procedures.  Minor \ndevelopment works and maintenance may be carried out on a \nforce account basis.  \nThe  procurement  of  goods  will  preferably  be  grouped  into \npackages larger than $500,000, to be suitable for ICB procedures.  \nMiscellaneous minor goods that cannot be grouped into larger \ncontracts,  and  are  estimated  to  cost  less  than  $500,000  per \ncontract,  will  be  procured  through  international  shopping  (IS) \nprocedures. Minor items estimated to cost less than the equivalent \nof  $50,000  per  contract  may  be  purchased  directly,  following \nproper procedures to ensure economy, efficiency, and quality. ", "  vii \nConsulting Services  An  input  of  1,830  person-months  of  consulting  is  planned, \nconsisting of 32 person-months of international consulting and \n1,798 person-months of domestic consulting.  The selection and \nengagement of all consulting services to be financed under the \nProject will be in accordance with the Quality and Cost Based \nSelection (QCBS) method of ADB's  Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants by the Asian Development Bank and its Borrowers, or \nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of \ndomestic consultants.  \nProject Benefits and  The Project will improve the living conditions of about 3.6 million \nBeneficiaries  residents in 21 urban centers by enhancing the quality of life and \nhealth,  improving  the  environment,  and  creating  conditions \nconducive to sustained urban development and economic growth. \nThe Project will help reduce mortality, morbidity, and poverty, and \nthe loss of amenity associated with environmental degradation in \nurban  centers,  especially  among  slum  inhabitants  and  poor \ngroups,  and  particularly  women  and  children.  The  Project  will \nsupport  improvements  in  capacity  of  local  governments  by \nimproving  their  financial  and  operational  management  and \nplanning, including local resource generation. \nRisks and Assumptions  Major risks associated with the Project include  \n           (i)     Acquisition of the required land may be delayed or not          \nforthcoming.  This  would  delay  or  impede  the \nimplementation of certain subprojects. \n(ii)  Future legislation could possibly gradually erode the \ncomprehensiveness  and  consistency  of  the \nPLGO2001,  which  could  seriously  impede  the \neffectiveness of the TMAs as main actors in project \nimplementation.  \n(iii)  Efforts to enhance the revenue base of the TMAs, \nand their institutional strengthening, may not attain \nsufficient and sustainable results. This could affect \nproject  implementation  and/or  the  long-term \nsustainability of improvements. \n(iv)  Delayed TMA actions in meeting the agreed eligibility \ncriteria may cause start-up delays. \n \n  The major project risks have been minimized by linkage of project \nexecution with TMA compliance with eligibility criteria, extensive \ncommunity  participation  to  develop  project  ownership, and the \nexpected benefits and positive impacts. Devolution is one of the \nGovernment's particular commitments to reform. The Project is a \ntimely contribution to the devolution process.  \n \n ", "  ix \n \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on two proposed loans \nto the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Southern Punjab Basic Urban Services Project.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  Urban areas in Pakistan are growing rapidly, and demand for improved urban services is \nincreasing. Current deficiencies in basic infrastructure inhibit economic growth, and severely \nconstrain the potential for urban areas to play a more significant role in the country\u2019s economic \ngrowth. To meet the growing pressures and demands, urban development has usually been \nwith few or no environmental controls, and with forms of governance that cannot begin to meet \nresponsibilities. High urban growth, combined with slow urban sector development, has resulted \nin  uncontrolled  urban  sprawl;  deteriorating  urban  environments;  and  deficiencies  in  urban \nservices such as  water supply, sewerage systems, drainage, solid waste management, roads, \nand community facilities. The deficiencies have particularly affected the urban poor and caused \na considerably lower quality of life, including poor health and increased poverty. The incidence \nof poverty increased from 26.6% in fiscal year (FY) 1993 to 32.2% in FY1999. The number of \npoor increased by 12 million during that period.  \n3.  The poverty reduction strategy of the Government of Pakistan1 (Government) envisages \na  multipronged  strategy  of  reviving  growth,  improving  governance,  reorienting  public \nexpenditures toward poverty-reducing programs, and revamping the safety net system. The \nGovernment is committed to increasing pro-poor budgetary expenditures by 0.2% of gross \ndomestic product (GDP) annually, to 4% of GDP in FY2004.2 The Government is implementing \ncomprehensive governance reforms, with particular emphasis on enhancing the effectiveness of \nbasic social services through its Punjab Local Government Ordinance, 2001 (PLGO2001). The \nPG\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy3  also  emphasizes  the  need  to  implement  broad-based \ngovernance reforms and improve social services to address poverty. To achieve the goals for \npoverty reduction, the Government has requested assistance from the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) in developing the economic potential of low-income urban centers in southern Punjab by \nimproving  the  existing  infrastructure,  and  developing  better  institutional  capacity  of  local \ngovernments. The Loan Fact-Finding Missionwas undertaken 08\u201325 July 2003. This report is \n \nbased on the consultant\u2019s reports prepared during an ADB-financed technical assistance (TA),4\n \nand the mission\u2019s understandings with both the federal and provincial governments, and with \nelected town officials and community groups. Linkages among  the project objectives, inputs, \nand outputs are shown in the project framework in Appendix 1, and in the chronology of loan-\nprocessing activities in Supplementary Appendix A. \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n4.   Punjab is Pakistan\u2019s largest province, with a population of about 84 million, or about 56% \nof the country\u2019s total population of 149 million. Punjab has an urban population growth rate of \nabout 4% yearly; the national average is about 3.5%. The per-capita gross domestic product \n(GDP) for Pakistan was estimated at $4165 in 2002, with variations among provinces.

", "2 \naverage monthly household income of $85 is fairly constant across Pakistan; that is almost the \nequivalent of four wage earners per household. The urban population accounts for about 35% of \nthe total population. High urban population growth is expected to continue in the foreseeable \nfuture, considering the relatively high birth rate, migration from rural areas for employment, and \nindustrial and commercial growth in urban areas. By 2020, the urban population is expected to \ncomprise 50% of the total population. The latest United Nations Development Programme report \nshows  that  Pakistan\u2019s  Human  Development  Index  rank  has  dropped  to  144  among  175 \ncountries, and is lower than other countries in South Asia, including Bangladesh, India, and Sri \nLanka. In line with the national trends, indicators of social sector achievement in Punjab have \nnot improved much in the 1990s. A significant and sustained effort will be required for social \nsector development in Punjab, considering that the literacy rate is 46% (36% for women), the \ninfant mortality rate is 95 per 1,000 live births, the immunization rate for children of ages 1 to 5 \nis 60%, and the contraceptive rate is only 20% in rural areas.  \n5.  With Pakistan\u2019s high urban growth, many slum areas have developed in the urban \ncenters. Punjab province is no exception. The urban population is about 25 million, and some \n7.5 million, or 35.0% of the total urban population, live in slums, with another 2.8 million, or \n11.5% of the urban population, living in  katchi abadis..6 Poverty7 in Punjab, as elsewhere in \n \nPakistan, is increasing. It rose from 25% in FY1993 to 33% in FY1999. Recent data suggests \nthat poverty increased further, both in rural and urban areas, from FY1999 to 2001. Poverty \nvaries significantly within the province, with the highest level in southern Punjab. \n6.   Levels of urban services in Punjab\u2019s urban centers are low, with coverage and service \nvarying greatly among towns. Although most towns have water supply systems, only 40% of \nhouseholds are connected to them. Service is limited, water quality is poor, and system losses \noften exceed 45%. Service levels in the sanitation sector are also low. Although many urban \ncenters have piped sewerage systems, most are old, with extremely poor maintenance, limited \ncoverage, and with sewage left untreated. Many households have individual sewage disposal \nsystems, consisting mostly of pit latrines and, to a lesser extent, septic tanks whose overflows \nare discharged into open canals and drainage networks, and infiltrate into groundwater aquifers. \nDrainage systems in the towns depend on open canals that serve as both drainage and sewage \ncollection points. Most urban centers have limited solid waste collection systems, but only about \n30% of the waste is collected and adequately disposed. Most waste, including that from \nhospitals, is disposed in open fields and unsanitary dump sites. The urban road networks are \nreasonably extensive, but road conditions are extremely poor, with inadequate maintenance. \nThe  existing  standards  and  provision  of  infrastructure  in  the  urban  centers  are  generally \ninsufficient to support sustained human development and economic growth. \n \n7.  To address the urban problems and institutional shortcomings, particularly in delivery of \nbasic services and facilities to the general public, the Government has initiated a program to \ndevolve power and responsibility, based on a bottom-up methodology that is people-centered \nand oriented to customer services. The devolution program, implemented on 14 August 2000, is \nbased on five fundamentals: devolution of political power, decentralization of administrative \nauthority, deconcentration of management functions, diffusion of the power authority nexus, and \ndistribution  of  resources  to  the  district  level.  More  transparent,  predictable,  and  equitable \ntransfers are being established for fiscal transfers and grants from the provincial government to \nthe district and tehsil governments. Local governments are being encouraged to generate \nfinancial resources from their own constituencies. \n \n                                                 \n6 A katchi abadi is an unauthorized settlement on state-owned land of more than 40 dwellings, as defined in March \n1985, without land rights and without physical and social infrastructure services and facilities.  \n7 The official poverty line was defined as PRs670/person per month in 1998-1999. It rose to PRs748 per month in \n2000-2001, and was estimated as PRs774 per month in 2002. \n ", "3 \n8.  The Local Government and Rural Development Department (LGRD) is responsible for \nsupport to the districts and  tehsils, or subdistricts, in planning, finance, and infrastructure \ndevelopment. The Planning and Development Board is central to all planning at the provincial \nlevel. It holds overall responsibility for planning and development of all sectors in the province, \nincluding  policy  and  procedures. Delivery of major municipal infrastructure falls under the \nresponsibility of tehsil municipal administrations (TMAs) at the subdistrict level, mandated to \nplan and construct water and sewerage works and to manage solid wastes. Some responsibility \nrests with the lowest level of local government, the union councils (UCs), which are charged \nwith community development and related tasks; and with the district governments, which handle \nall affairs related to government land as well as the health, education, and social affairs sectors. \nThe Office of Katchi Abadis and Urban Improvement (KAUI), under LGRD, oversees programs \nfor  the  upgrading  of  slums  and  urban  improvement.  Grant  allocations  from  the  federal \ngovernment, using revenues from general sales taxes, are the local governments\u2019 main revenue \nsource, amounting to 30% to 50% of urban centers\u2019 revenue. The rest of the local governments\u2019 \nrevenue is from water charges, immovable property taxes, and a range of other charges, taxes, \nand rentals. Weak institutional capacity and low willingness of the general public to pay for \nservices has limited the mobilization of resources by the local governments. Appendix 2 gives \nthe Pakistan urban sector analysis. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n9.   Key constraints to the effective delivery of urban services include a lack of stakeholder \nparticipation  in  the  planning,  design  and  implementation  of  development  projects;  low \ninvestment levels; inefficiency of public institutions; a lack of accountability; and limited resource \nmobilization  by  local  governments.  Participatory  planning  with  stakeholders,  institutional \nstrengthening of TMAs, improvements in environmental infrastructure in selected urban towns, \nand emphasizing the provision of basic urban services in low-income and economically deprived \ncommunities  will  help  slow  environmental  degradation;  help  improve  the  health  of  urban \nresidents, especially the poor; and provide the basis for sustainable economic growth.  \n10.  The Government\u2019s policy of decentralization and devolution is critical to developing \ngreater local responsibility. Efficient and cost-effective community services cannot be provided \nuntil accountability and management are improved at the local level. The mobilization of local \nresources and improved management of existing infrastructure and services are necessary to \nachieve these objectives. The Government has agreed to support these objectives, through the \nProject, by (i) strengthening the managerial, financial, and technical capacity of the TMAs by \ngiving them more responsibility, and upgrading their staffs\u2019 capacities; (ii) providing adequate \nstaff,  equipment,  and  procedures  to  enable  the  TMAs  to  increase  resource  mobilization, \nimplement and sustain subprojects successfully, and improve the management and delivery of \nexisting urban infrastructure and services; and (iii) providing a training program to increase the \ntechnical proficiency of TMAs and provincial staff. The Government has committed itself to \ngreater  continuity  in  the  appointment  of  key  professional  and  administrative  staff  in  local \ncouncils. \n11.  The PLGO2001 has provided the legal framework for enhanced responsibility of local \nauthorities, but much more work remains before there will be self-reliant TMAs with sufficient \nprofessional  management  and  a  sufficient  resource  base  to  provide  more  than  marginally \nimproved basic urban services. The Project\u2019s sustained success depends on this and a policy \nframework that focuses more on needs of the poor, on sound service management, and on cost \nrecovery. These can be supported through linkages with the ADB-assisted Devolution Support \nProgram (DSP).8 For this, the Project will develop functional linkages with DSP\u2019s annual planning \nmechanisms for technical assistance.  \n                                                 \n8 ADB. 2002.

Manila (Loans 1935-, 1936-, 1937-, and 1938-\nPAK, for $30 million). \n ", "4 \n12.  The Government is concerned about the low levels of social services and believes that \ngreater investment will accelerate productivity gains, reduce poverty, and promote smaller, \nhealthier, and better-educated families. Pakistan\u2019s national urban and housing policy is reflected \nin the Ten Year Perspective Development Plan (PDP) 2001\u20132011, which describes the main \nurban  problems  as  (i) environmental  degradation,  including  the  mushrooming  of  katchi \nabadis and breakdown of infrastructure and municipal services; (ii) a lack of vision, inadequate \ninstitutional setups, and weak financial bases; (iii) a backlog of 2 million housing units, apart \nfrom the 2.3 million units that are structurally obsolete; and (iv) a lack of financial institutions to \nprovide affordable loans for house construction. The plan envisages the following strategies for \nurban development: (i) strengthening the roles of local bodies in planning, determining actual \nneeds, preparing action plans, and augmenting capabilities for water supply and sanitation \nservices; (ii) developing satellite, or secondary and industrial, towns as employment centers; \n(iii) preparing or updating master plans; and (iv) upgrading of katchi abadis and slums through \nintegrated area improvement packages. For water supply and sanitation, PDP envisages that an \nadditional 55 million persons (28 million rural and 27 million urban) will be provided with water \nsupply services, thus increasing national service coverage from 63% to 84%; and another \n54 million persons (26 million rural and 28 million urban) will benefit from sanitation facilities, \nthus increasing national service coverage from 39% to 63%. Private sector participation in water \nsupply for major cities will be encouraged, and TMA institutional capacity will be upgraded.  In \nline with the goals of the National Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS), the Punjab PRS also \nemphasizes,  among  key  factors  to  reduce  poverty  in  Punjab,  restoration  of  good \ngovernance, enhancement of public expenditures, improvement in service delivery for social \nsectors, and addressing environmental concerns. \n13.  The Government is committed to increase annual pro-poor budgetary expenditures from \n0.2% of GDP to 4% of GDP by FY2004. The Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund, established in \n1997 to finance income-generating projects, micro enterprises, and community infrastructure \nprojects, mainly through nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and the private sector, has \nbegun  lending  activities.  In  April  2000,  the  Government  launched  the  National  Poverty \nAlleviation Program, with the objectives of stimulating employment and providing essential \ninfrastructure and services to rural and low-income urban areas. A new program to rehabilitate \nthe poor by giving them one-time rehabilitation grants ranging from PRs5,000 to PRs50,000 \nfrom the Zakat Fund was initiated.9 The Government increased funding for a small public works \nprogram, the Khushal Pakistan Program,10 that aims to provide gainful employment for the poor, \nplus create essential infrastructure (farm-to-market roads, water supply schemes, repair of \nschools, etc.) in rural and low-income urban areas. The Government also set up the Khushali \nBank with ADB\u2019s financial support11 in August 2001, as Pakistan\u2019s first micro finance bank. The \nGovernment has put a mechanism in place for the quarterly tracking of anti-poverty expenditures \non the Finance Division\u2019s web site. Most intermediate human development indicators are now \nreported annually.12   \n14.  PG  organized  the  Punjab  Development  Forum,  held  16\u201317  September  2003,  to \ndemonstrate its seriousness and commitment to undertaking wide-ranging reforms for fiscal \nstabilization, higher growth, enhanced social sector development, and poverty reduction. PG \ntook full advantage of the substantial donor interest in helping achieve its development goals. \nADB has proposed an assistance program of about $1 billion over the next 4 years for Punjab. \n                                                 \n9 The Zakat Fund, a nongovernment budgeted Islamic welfare fund financed through a 2.5% religious levy on fixed \nfinancial assets of Pakistan\u2019s Muslim citizens, has operated as a major social safety net since 1980.   \n10 Past programs similar to the Khushal Pakistan Program have been implemented, including the Taamir-e-Watan \nProgram and the Public Works Program. \n11 ADB. 1999. Microfinance Sector Development Program. Manila (Loan 1805/1806-PAK[SF] for $150 million). \n12 The Government has identified four intermediate human development indicators to capture the intermediate impact \nof most of its human development expenditures: (i) percentage of population registered with female health workers, \n(ii) utilization of curative health care facilities, (iii) number of functional primary and middle schools, and (iv) \npercentage of functional primary and middle schools with basic facilities, including water, latrines, electricity, and \nboundary walls.  ", "5 \nOf this, half will be for the Punjab Resource Management Program, which includes support for \nwide-ranging fiscal and financial reforms, improved institutional arrangements for sustainable \nand pro-poor public services, administrative restructuring and human resource development, \nand generating growth and employment through development of the private sector. The other \nhalf billion dollars is for projects such as the Sustainable Livelihoods in Barani Areas Project, the \nRawalpindi Environmental Improvement Project, the Decentralized Social Services Program, \nthe Punjab Local Justice Support Program, and the proposed Southern Punjab Basic Urban \nServices  Project.  Punjab  will  also  benefit  from  several  other  ADB-assisted,  national-level \nprojects during this period \n15.  The Project is formulated to support the Government\u2019s initiatives for poverty reduction, \nas well as the devolution of power and responsibility to the local governments for providing and \nfinancing urban infrastructure and municipal services. The Project incorporates several strategic \nfeatures and incentives for participation, including (i) promotion of policy reforms in accordance \nwith PLGO2001, (ii) financial management and resource generation at the local government \nlevel, (iii) priority for investments that meet the basic needs of urban communities, (iv) local \ncommunity participation and ownership, and (v) equity participation by local governments in the \ninvestment packages. \n16.  ADB\u2019s strategy. The focus of ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program Update (2004\u2013\n2006) for Pakistan is on reducing poverty by providing help in the key strategic areas of good \ngovernance, sustainable pro-poor economic growth, and inclusive social development. The \nstrategy continues to be relevant, and in line with the new government\u2019s priorities. ADB lending \nto devolved sectors will aim to strengthen devolution by ensuring that future ADB projects are \nconsistent with the new governance structure under the PLGO2001. Where appropriate, efforts \nwill be made to realign recently approved ADB projects for devolved sectors. ADB\u2019s emphasis \nwill remain on improving delivery of social services that supports both increased public sector \nallocations and improved governance through devolution, sector administration, and financial \nmanagement. The Water for All: the Water Policy of the Asian Development Bank, 2001 also \nsupports ADB\u2019s strategy for poverty reduction by addressing each of the three framework \nelements of poverty reduction: pro-poor sustainable growth, social development, and good \ngovernance. The main focus of ADB assistance to the urban sector will be on environmental \naspects  and  needs  of  the  poor,  and  will  broadly  cover:  (i)  institutional  restructuring  and \ndevolution of service delivery, (ii) private sector involvement in the delivery of selected services, \n(iii) budgeting and finance, and increased cost recovery and municipal revenue, (iv) increased \ncommunity participation, and (v) attainment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The \nProject will develop linkages with strategies being developed by forums like the Global Water \nPartnership, the World Water Council, and the Water Supply and Sanitation  Collaborative \nCouncil, to facilitate achievement of the vision, goals, and targets set through the MDGs. \n17.  External assistance to the sector. ADB has provided seven loans, totaling about $360 \nmillion, since beginning assistance to Pakistan\u2019s urban sector in 1976 (that includes loans for \nthe water supply, sanitation, and urban development sectors).  Another $6.75 million was \nprovided for technical assistance (TA) in water supply, sanitation, and urban development. So \nfar, ADB projects in Pakistan\u2019s urban sector have focused on North-West Frontier and Sindh \nprovinces. Japan has provided the largest external support to the urban sector and the World \nBank, the second largest. The strategic focuses of both donors were mainly Sindh and Punjab \nprovinces. Other bilateral assistance is provided by the governments of Germany, Kuwait, \nNetherlands, Switzerland, and United Kingdom. The United Nations Development Programme, \nalong with the United Nations International Children\u2019s Fund and the World Health Organization, \nhave provided assistance, mostly in community water supply and low-cost sanitation projects. \nAppendix 3 gives more information. \n18.  Lessons learned.  Following are summaries of key lessons learned from ADB-financed \nprojects for urban development and water supply and sanitation in Pakistan, and a review of \nmultilateral and bilateral projects in Pakistan and the region:  \n ", "6 \n(i)  Portfolio performance has been constrained by generic macro and micro issues, \nincluding  legal  and  administrative  issues  related to processing requirements; \ncoordination difficulties; procedural, technical and project management issues; \ncounterpart funding constraints; and timely release of counterpart funds. These \nissues  delay  implementation,  often  with  negative  financial  and  economic \nconsequences.  \n(ii)  Project accountability and transparency are undermined by failure to comply with \nspecific  covenants,  delays  in  consultant  recruitment,  minimal  beneficiary \nparticipation, poor operation and maintenance (O&M) of completed facilities, low \nfinancial  and  economic  rates  of  return,  and  frequent  changing  of  senior \nmanagement staff.  \n(iii)  The quality of governance is critical to a project\u2019s success. Highly centralized \nproject management adversely affects project performance and ownership by \nmajor stakeholders. \n(iv)  All stakeholders should be fully involved in project identification and design from \nan early stage, and sufficient information should be gathered regarding the active \nNGOs  and  community-based  organizations  (CBOs)  in  the  project  area  to \nfacilitate their involvement.13 \n(v)  Community participation requires intensive interaction among the project team, \nthe participating community, and the local authorities, and it must be relevant to \nthe service needs. \n(vi)  Women should be empowered to participate in decision-making at the micro level \nto bring about constructive changes in living conditions of the urban poor. \n(vii)  Community  cost  sharing  in  investment  projects  brings  ownership  and \nsustainability.14  \n(viii)  Institutional strengthening should be given the greatest emphasis and carried out \nsystematically.  \n(ix)  Delays  in  start-up  implementation  should  be  avoided  by  taking  advance \nprocurement actions.  \n19.  An important lesson derived from the Karachi Urban Development Project15 is that urban \nupgrading is complex, and a piecemeal approach involving a few selected problems is not an \noptimal solution. Urban upgrading should be designed from a plan that integrates all aspects of \nurban infrastructure, and involves participation of the ultimate beneficiaries. The institutional \ncapacity to implement the project must be present, and the financial framework must be in place \nto ensure long-term sustainability of the upgrading. A main lesson learned from the Karachi \nSewerage Project16 is that the sustainability of sewerage projects can only be assured if the \nexecuting  agency  (EA)  is  in  good  financial  health.  An  important  lesson  derived  from  the \nFaisalabad  Water  Supply,  Sewerage,  and  Drainage  Project17  is  that  continuing \ncommercialization of a utility requires improved financial autonomy and reporting on accounting, \nincreased data-based decision making, and the will and commitment of the authority concerned. \n                                                 \n13  ADB. 2003.

", "7 \nAn important lesson learned from the Karnataka Urban Development Project in India, which \nADB started financing in early 1996, is that women should be empowered to participate in \ndecision making at the micro level to bring about constructive changes in the living conditions of \nthe urban poor. Furthermore, people\u2019s perceptions of, and attitudes toward, sanitation must be \nchanged, because public awareness and community participation are critical in any sanitation \nimprovement  program.  Appendix  4  summarizes  lessons  learned  and  measures  taken  to \nincorporate those lessons into the Project. \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objectives \n20.  The overall project goals are to reduce urban poverty, improve community health, and \nreduce environmental degradation in  low-income  urban  settlements  of  selected  towns  of \nsouthern Punjab where (i) safe drinking water is scarce; (ii) sewerage systems are inadequate \nor nonexistent, and there are no wastewater treatment facilities; (iii) solid waste collection and \ndisposal is insufficient; and (iv) there are few or no road links from low-income community areas \nto main urban roads. \n21.  The project objectives are to: \n(i)  improve living conditions and quality of life of low-income communities in 21 \ntowns  by  improving  the  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities,  solid  waste \nmanagement, and road network;  \n(ii)  ensure  sustainability  of  urban  investments  by  strengthening  institutional \ncapacities  of  newly  devolved  local  government  agencies,  promoting  policy \nreforms focused on greater devolution of authority, and involving all stakeholders \nin the process development of subprojects; and \n(iii)  alleviate urban poverty. \n22.  The Project will cover about 425 low-income areas of 21 towns18 in 6 districts19 in \nsouthern Punjab. Towns were selected in close consultation with PG, based on priority needs \nfor improvement. Low-income areas within the selected towns were identified by undertaking (i) \nextensive socioeconomic surveys to identify urban service coverage, needs and demands for \nservices,  assessment  of  household  incomes,  and  willingness  to  pay  for  services;  (ii) \nparticipatory analysis and planning with households, especially with women\u2019s groups, which \ngave  information  on  poverty  impact  and  priorities  of  vulnerable  communities  for  poverty \nreduction; (iii) specific and detailed poverty profiles, clearly defining the poverty levels within \neach low-income community;  and (iv) gender analysis with particular reference to women\u2019s \nparticipation in project execution.  Based on those factors, proposals for specific urban facilities \nwere developed for each low-income area.   \nB.  Components and Outputs \n23.  The  Project  will  comprise  the  following  main  components:  (i)  development  of \ninfrastructure for basic urban services and community development and participation; and (ii) \ninstitutional development, including development of municipal management systems for TMAs, \nproject implementation support, and incremental administration support.  \n  1.  Development of Infrastructure for Basic Urban Services \n24.   The component for development of infrastructure for basic urban services  comprises \ninfrastructure improvements and community development and participation, and includes town-\nspecific  investments  in  one  or  more  infrastructure  improvement  subprojects  together  with \n                                                 \n18 Bahawalpur, Ahmadpur East, Hasilpur, Khairpur Tamewali, Yazman, Dera Ghazi Khan, Taunsa, Jahanian, \nKabirwala, Khanewal, Mian Channu, Jalalpur Pirwala, Qadirpur Rawan, Shujabad, Alipur, Jatoi, Kot Addu, Jampur, \nRajanpur, Rojhan, and Multan. \n19 Bahawalpur, Khanewal, Multan, Muzaffargarh, Dera Ghazi Khan, and Rajanpur. \n ", "8 \nmapping and asset management, careful review of actual water use and wastewater generation, \nand  formation  of  CBOs.  The  component  will  complement  the  Government's  initiatives  for \npoverty reduction. Appendix 7 gives a summary investment plan for each project town. \na.  Infrastructure Improvements \n25.   Water supply. The water supply subcomponent will improve the service and quality of \nexisting water distribution systems. It will increase revenues through a combination of updating \nconsumer databases, conversion of illegal connections to registered accounts, leak detection \nand repair, and monitoring of water quality. Distribution systems will be extended or rehabilitated \nfor poorly served  low-income communities of seven towns with scarce, deep, or brackish \ngroundwater. The water supply subcomponent will include the provision of new tubewells, \ntransmission mains, and storage reservoirs; and the construction or rehabilitation of distribution \nsystems.  \n26.  All schools in the project area will be provided latrines and connections for supply of safe \ndrinking water. Health and hygiene education will be promoted. The Project will monitor the \neffects of improvements in water quality on health, especially on child stunting, by organizing a \nrepresentative sample study and project performance management system (PPMS). A pilot \nprogram of public pay toilets will be implemented in Multan, following the examples of similar \nsuccessful programs in the region.20 If successful, the program will be expanded to other towns. \n27.  Sewerage  systems  and  wastewater  treatment. This subcomponent includes the \nextension and rehabilitation of sewerage systems and construction of new wastewater treatment \nplants in 19 of the 21 towns. It comprises the rehabilitation of existing, and laying of new, \nsecondary and main trunk sewers; the rehabilitation and construction of disposal stations; the \nconstruction of new sullage carriers; and the construction of one or more treatment plants. \nCommunities will provide lane level sewers and house connections, with technical assistance \nfrom the Project. TMAs and citizen community boards (CCBs) will also provide assistance to \ncommunities.  \n28.   Solid waste management. The solid waste management subcomponent will improve \nthe collection and disposal of solid waste in all towns. It will include the disposal of hazardous \nhospital wastes in 11 towns. This subcomponent will include (i) community support through \nwaste  minimization,  with  concentration  of  wastes  at  neighborhood  collection  points;  (ii) \nprocurement of equipment and vehicles for collection an disposal of solid wastes in landfills; and \n(iii) development of landfill sites. Involvement of communities, NGOs, and the private sector in \nthe collection, recycling, and composting of solid wastes will be emphasized. \n29.  Low-income area road links. This subcomponent will improve access of low-income \ncommunities to their town centers and local neighborhoods in 13 towns, which will improve \neconomic activities. All road links will follow the existing rights-of-way. \n30.  Slaughterhouses. The slaughterhouse subcomponent will comprise the construction or \nrelocation of slaughterhouses in 12 towns to improve hygienic conditions in residential areas. It \nwill  involve  improved  handling  of  wastewater  and  solid  wastes,  which  cause  serious \nenvironmental hazards, from slaughterhouses. The relocation or improvement of municipal \nslaughterhouses can also open new opportunities for private sector involvement. \n31.  Incremental land development for the poor. This subproject follows the successful \nKhuda Ki Basti model for development of low-cost housing for the poor in Hyderabad and \nKarachi. Under this subcomponent, LGRD and Mian Channu TMA will (i) select an area from \nstate land for housing schemes for the poor; (ii) delineate small plots; and (iii) provide from the \nProject the infrastructure for external access and water supply and sanitation, but not internal \n                                                 \n20 Good examples to replicate are the Sulabh (privately financed) and Pune (publicly financed) public pay toilets in \nIndia; the ongoing successful experience in Karachi through the Citizen Police Liaison Committee; TMA toilets \n(public-private partnership); and a similar program that was recently initiated in Lahore by the Lahore Horticulture \nDepartment. ", "9 \ndevelopment. Construction of houses and internal infrastructure will be undertaken through the \ncommunities\u2019 own resources, with technical assistance from the Project. This subcomponent will \nbe implemented as a pilot activity in Mian Channu. If successful, other TMAs can replicate it, \nusing their own resources. \nb.  Community Development and Participation \n32.  The subcomponent for community development and participation will aim to develop \norganizational and human capacity within TMAs for participatory processes targeted at reducing \npoverty and providing basic needs. This subcomponent will include community development \nactivities in several fields, all  implemented by social mobilizing teams or NGOs. Activities \ninclude: \n(i)  programs to support infrastructure investments such as social mobilization for the \ncomponent sharing approach, public health education, and hygiene awareness \ncampaigns which will enhance readiness to install sewerage house connections; \nand training for micro contractors in  the installation of house connections for \nsewerage and water supply;  \n(ii)  action research to improve systems of CBO-managed collection of solid waste in \nresidential neighborhoods, and CBO-managed decentralized composting; and  \n(iii)  programs for poverty alleviation  that are responsive to real demand, such as \nsimple skills training, particularly for women to enable them to  increase their \nincomes.  Through  skills  training,  women  will  set  up  small  enterprises  and \nbecome involved in activities to generate additional household income. \n \n2.  Institutional Development \n \nc.  Municipal Management System Development for TMAs  \n33.   The component for development of municipal management systems will cover all TMAs. \nPlanned interventions include (i) training in technical and financial management for TMA staff \nincluding also the mapping and asset management; (ii) increasing public awareness of urban \nissues, sustainability of facilities, and options for improving the delivery of urban services; (iii) \nimproving municipal financial management by introducing improved accounting procedures and \nmanagement  information  systems  that  include  budgeting,  resource  mobilization,  enhanced \nO&M of assets, and improved billing and collection systems, and (iv) establishing regulatory \nsystems to ensure that laws, standards, rules, and regulations are equitably and consistently \napplied. These are critical to long-term sustainability of urban centers. Where possible, technical \ntraining will be hands-on and linked to measurable outputs, to enable determination of whether \nrequired skill levels have been achieved, and to verify that the training is actually used on the \njob.  The  design  and  implementation  of  measures  for  institutional  strengthening  will  be \ncoordinated with training programs provided under other ongoing programs such as the DSP, \nwhere the Project will evolve functional linkages with its TA annual planning mechanisms.  The \nProject will take into account the training capacities of existing institutions. This component will \nalso include exchange visits of TMA officials for mutual sharing of successful experiences in \ninstitutional  development.  Appendixes  5  and  6  give  policy  actions  related  to  institutional \ndevelopment of TMAs in line with PLGO 2001. Supplementary Appendix B gives tasks to be \nundertaken under this component. \nd.  Project Implementation Assistance \n34.   The  project  implementation  assistance  component  will  comprise  various  types  of \nconsulting services, including project implementation support to the Project Coordination Office \n(PCO) at the local government level, and the project units (PUs) at the TMAs for infrastructure \ndesign, construction supervision, community development, and institutional strengthening.  \n \n ", "10 \ne.  Incremental Administration Support \n35.  Incremental administrative support for project implementation is required for the PCO \nand  PUs.  A  PCO,  headed  by  DG  KAUI,  will  be  responsible  for  provincial  and  interTMA \ncoordination,  planning,  and  management  of  project  activities.  The  PCO  will  require  four \nprofessional staff, representing several disciplines, and administrative support staff. At the TMA \nlevel, a PU will be established in each participating town to undertake, with the technical support \nteam, the subprojects\u2019 planning, design, and implementation; and to maintain close linkages \nwith associated NGOs and CBOs. A major objective of this subcomponent is to develop greater \nownership at the provincial and TMA levels. \nC.  Special Features \n36.  This is the first ADB-supported investment project to make concerted efforts to align its \nscope and focus, and institutional and financing modalities, with the new governance structure \nunder  PLGO2001.  The  Project  supports  PG  and  tehsil  authorities  for  adoption  of  the \narrangements envisaged under PLGO2001. The Project has a number of special features with \nrespect to devolution, the role of the Provincial Finance Commission (PFC), and collateral policy \nactions.  The  design  seeks  to  ensure  that  execution  arrangements  with  LGRD  do  not \ncompromise the devolved authorities of the TMAs. TMA project implementation follows the spirit \nof PLGO2001, shifting from vertical to horizontal programming.  It particularly offers assistance \nto the transition from vertical province-driven programs to programs that the TMAs should fully \ncarry out, with the necessary autonomy in the true spirit of devolution.  \n37.  In the past, a top-down approach was used in project preparation, but this project was \ndesigned  in  close  collaboration  with  beneficiaries,  NGOs,  and  TMAs.  Besides  extensive \nmeetings in the field with these groups, three consultative workshops were organized at the \ninception, interim, and final stages of the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA).  In \nthe final workshop, the TMAs endorsed the proposed scope and implementation arrangements \nof the Project. The proposed establishment of PUs at each TMA, and TMA and beneficiary \ninvolvement in the planning and implementation of the Project, offer an opportunity to the TMAs \nto  independently  implement  the  Project  in  line  with  their  needs,  and  within the spirit of \nPLGO2001. \n38.  In most Punjab slums, more than 70% of the population lives below the poverty line, and \nwomen have less-skilled and less-remunerative jobs than men. Enhancement of women\u2019s roles \nby providing skills training to increase their incomes is an important facet of the Project. Local \nNGOs will implement the skills training programs at facilities made available by the Project. \nProfessional training will enable women to set up small enterprises and become involved in \nincome-generating  activities,  thus  contributing  to  their  household  incomes.  The  training, \nsavings,  and  access  to  credit  facilities  such  as  the  ADB-assisted  Microfinance  Sector \nDevelopment Program, is also expected to help increase the income and confidence of poor \nwomen in slum areas. Of equal importance, the Project will increase awareness on health, \nsanitation,  and  improved  community  participation,  through  its  community  development \ncomponent. \nD.  Cost Estimates \n39.  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $128.6 million equivalent, including taxes \nand  duties,  of  which  $18.2  million  equivalent  (14%)  is  foreign  exchange  costs  including \n$2.7 million in interest charges during construction. Local currency costs are  $110.4 million \nequivalent (86%). Table 1 summarizes the estimated costs.

Financing Plan \n40.  The  Government  has  requested  two  loans,  one  of  Special  Drawing  Rights  (SDR) \n31,429,000 ($45 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (ADF) and a second \nloan of Yen 4,896,225,000 ($45 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Ordinary Capital resources \n(OCR), to help finance the Project. \n41.   The ADF loan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years. The \ninterest rate will be 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter,   \nand such other terms and conditions in the draft Loan and Project Agreements.  \n42.   The OCR loan of $45 million equivalent will have a 25-year term, including a 5-year \ngrace period. The interest rate will be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based \nlending facility, including a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-end fee of 0.5% of \nthe loan amount, and other terms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan and Project \nAgreements. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reason for its decision to borrow \nunder ADB\u2019s LBL facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that \nthese  choices  were  its  own  independent  decisions,  and  not  made  because  of  ADB \ncommunication or advice. \n43.  The loans will cover the Project\u2019s entire foreign exchange cost of $18.2 million (including \ninterest and other charges of $2.7 million), and will finance $71.8 million equivalent, or 65%, of \nthe local currency costs. The local currency cost to be financed by the ADB will cover portions of \nthe civil works, vehicles, consulting services and Project management support, but excluding \nduties and taxes. The ADB\u2019s financing of local currency expenditure is justified by the nature of \nthe Project, which will address poverty, gender, and environment issues within the Project \nareas. The ADF and OCR loans will cover the given foreign and local currency costs of the \nProject on a pro rata basis. \n44.  ADB will provide the loans to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, which will relend the \nfunds to PG on the same terms and conditions. PG will bear the foreign exchange risk and   \nmake the loan proceeds available, as special grant, to TMAs through LGRD under Provincial \nFinance Commission (PFC).21 Funds will be allocated to TMA, as entitlements in the grant, on \n                                                 \n21 PG established PFC in June 2002 through an amendment to PLGO2001, to facilitate fiscal transfers from the \nprovincial government to district governments, TMAs, and union administrations.    \n ", "12 \nthe basis of TMA-specific investment plans based on actual needs for basic urban services, \nparticularly for low-income communities within the agreed project scope. TMA financing will be \nsubject to TMA meeting the eligibility and the project-specific criteria (Appendix 5). For the first \nyear, TMA share will be determined against the investment plan defined through the PPTA, \n(Supplementary  Appendix  I).  In  subsequent  years,  funds  will  be  allocated  according  to  a \nformula, based on TMA performance (Appendix 5). Design of the grant will create incentives for \nTMAs to draw down the entitled shares, or otherwise lose shares because of poor performance. \nThe unused shares will be credited to the investment pool available for reallocation, based on \nTMA performance evaluation.

Implementation Arrangements \n2.  Project Management \n45.  The Executing Agency (EA)\u2014PG\u2019s LGRD\u2014will coordinate project implementation and \nwill establish a PCO, headed by the DG KAUI. The PCO, comprised of professional staff \nsupported by a team of consultants, will help TMAs by providing policy guidance and interTMA \ncoordination, by implementing the Municipal Management System Development component, and \nby supporting monitoring and evaluation of works executed by the PUs. The PCO will support the \nTMAs, providing guidance in implementing project activities.   \n46.  Each of the 21 TMAs will act as implementing agency and will establish a PU to execute \nthe urban development component of the Project. Each PU, headed by the TMA chief officer, \nwill comprise a municipal engineer, an accounts officer, subengineers, and support staff. The \nPUs will work in close collaboration with the TMA tehsil officer, infrastructure and services (TO \nI&S). In Multan, the PU will also include staff from the Multan Development Authority. The PCO \nwill provide  to each TMA a full-time municipal engineer and accounts officer, and TMAs will \narrange subengineers and support staff for the PU. Four technical support teams (TSTs) of \nconsultants, one each placed at Multan, Bahawalpur, Dera Ghazi Khan, and Khanewal, will help \nthe PUs prepare detailed designs, and procure components for urban development. These PUs \nwill continue to exist after project completion as the core development units of the tehsils, to \nlook after TMAs\u2019 development works under annual development programs,  and  to  ensure \nsustainability of all development works, including project works. Appendix 8 gives the project \nimplementation framework. \n47.  Two committees will be established for internal coordination: \n(i)  A project implementation review committee (PIRC) at each tehsil, will monitor the \nimplementation  progress  of  all  project  components  monthly.  The  PIRC  will \ncomprise male and female representatives of the TMA and union councils (UCs), \nCBOs, the tehsil municipal officer, the tehsil officer for planning and coordination, \nTO I&S, the TMA's chief officer, consultants, conveners of citizen community \nboards  (CCBs),  and  the  LGRD  assistant  director  of  the  concerned  district. \nHeaded by a tehsil head - the Nazim, the tehsil and UC-level women councilors \nare envisaged to play a key role in the PIRCs. ", "13 \n(ii)  A project steering committee (PSC), headed by the chairman of the PG Planning \nand  Development  Board  and  with  senior  officers  from  the  departments  of \nplanning and development (P&D), LGRD, finance, the PCO project coordinator, \nand tehsil nazims of participating TMAs as members, will be set up within one \nmonth of loan effectiveness at P&D in Lahore. The PSC will ensure orderly \nimplementation,  provide  policy  guidance  on  ongoing  and  new  Government \ninitiatives, resolve interagency problems, and follow up with LGRD on progress \non provincial policy actions (Appendix 6). PSC meetings will be held at least \nevery 3 months. The PSC role will not include changing TMA eligibilities, but will \nonly  make  recommendations  to  PFC.  LGRD  will  continue  to  hold  follow-up \nmeetings, as needed, with PCO and TMAs.    \n48.  In August 2003, PG established the Core Project Management Unit to facilitate project \nprocessing, finalize the planning commission performa-1 (PC-1), and coordinate between the \nGovernment and ADB. This arrangement will be transformed into the PCO after ADB approves \nthe Project. \n2.  Implementation Period \n49.  The Project will be implemented over 5 years, and will be completed by January 2009. \nAppendix 9 gives the implementation schedule. \n3.  Procurement \n50.   All procurement services for the Project will follow ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. \nContracts for civil works that are estimated to cost more than $1 million equivalent will be issued \nusing ICB procedures. Contracts estimated to cost $1 million equivalent or less will be carried \nout through LCB procedures. Minor development and maintenance may be carried out on a \nforce account basis. The procurement of goods will preferably be grouped into packages larger \nthan $500,000, to be suitable for ICB procedures. Miscellaneous minor goods that cannot be \ngrouped into larger contracts, and are estimated to cost less than $500,000 per contract, will be \nprocured through international shopping (IS) procedures. Minor items estimated to cost less \nthan  the  equivalent  of  $50,000  per  contract  may  be  purchased  directly,  following  proper \nprocedures to ensure economy, efficiency, and quality.  Appendix 10 shows the proposed \ncontract packages.  \n51.   To  expedite  implementation,  the  PCO  will  take  advance  action  on  recruiting  all \nconsultants, and prequalifying the contractors. PG has been informed that the approval of \nadvance actions does not commit ADB to finance the project expenditures. \n   4.   Consulting Services \n52.   To  support  project  implementation,  plus  build  long-term  capacity  of  the  TMAs \nresponsible for planning and delivery of urban services, 1,830 person-months of consulting \nservices (32 international and 1,798 domestic person-months) will be required, covering (i) \nPackage A: project management and implementation support to the PCO and PUs, including \nsubproject-detailed  design,  construction  supervision,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  (14 \ninternational, and 518 domestic person-months); (ii) Package B: development of a municipal \nmanagement system (18 international and 128 domestic person-months); and (iii) Package C: \nPU professionals (1,152 person-months of individual consultants\u2014one for each TMA). Also, \nlocal  NGOs  and  social  mobilizing  teams  (Package  D)  will  be  engaged  for  community \ndevelopment and participation (978 person-months). Supplementary  Appendix C gives more \ndetails. \n53.   Consultancy services for Packages A and B will be procured from both international and \ndomestic consulting firms. Twenty-one PU consultants under Package C will be recruited as \nindividual consultants. Package D consultants will be contracted to individual social mobilizers \nor local NGOs. Some of the required assistance, especially for training of local government \nofficials, will be through government institutions such as the provincial LGRD, or the National \n ", "14 \nInstitute for Public Administration. Such training will also be coordinated with similar efforts \nthrough other ongoing programs such as DSP. \n54.   The selection and engagement of all consulting services to be financed under the \nProject will be in accordance with the QCBS method of ADB's  Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants by Asian Development Bank and its Borrowers, or other arrangements satisfactory \nto ADB for engagement of domestic consultants.  \n  5.  Disbursement Arrangements   \n55.  To  expedite  disbursement  of  loan  proceeds,  LGRD  will  establish  a  first-generation \nimprest account soon after loan effectiveness. Payments for eligible project expenditures will be \nmade to and from this account. Each PU will open a second-generation imprest account. These \naccounts will be used to meet PUs\u2019 eligible expenditures under the Project. The opening of all \nimprest accounts will be subject to the appointment of qualified account staff and establishment \nof internal control by the PCO and PUs, acceptable to ADB. Imprest accounts will be managed, \nreplenished, and liquidated in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook (January \n2001), and arrangements agreed upon between the Government and ADB. A statement of \nexpenditures procedures may be used to reimburse eligible expenditures and liquidate imprest \naccounts for any individual payment no more than $50,000. The initial combined total amount in  \nall imprest accounts will not exceed 6 months of the estimated expenditures, and not more than \n10% of the total loan amount, whichever is lower.  \n56.  The PCO will disburse funds from the first generation imprest account directly for capital \nand operating costs of the PCO; consultants; technical support team offices; capacity building \nand training activities; and related expenditures for monitoring, review, and evaluation. Funds \nfor  infrastructure  investment  components  will  be  transferred  to  second-generation  impress \naccounts, managed by the PUs on the basis of the work plans for eligible items. \n  6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n57.   The EA will maintain records and accounts to identify  works, goods, and services \nfinanced from loan proceeds. Specifically, the EA will: (i) maintain separate project accounts for \nPCO and PUs; (ii) ensure an annual audit of project accounts and financial statements in \naccordance with sound accounting principles by independent auditors endorsed by the Auditor-\nGeneral of Pakistan; and (iii) furnish to ADB, no later than 9 months after the close of each fiscal \nyear, certified copies of audited accounts and financial statements, and the auditors\u2019 reports. \nAuditors that are acceptable to ADB will audit the imprest account, second-generation imprest \naccounts, and SOE. The final audit report will include a separate audit opinion on these.  \n58.   The PCO will prepare quarterly progress reports in a format acceptable to ADB. The \nreports will provide information on (i) progress made against established targets, including pre-\nidentified monitoring indicators; (ii) delays and problems encountered, and actions taken to \nresolve them; (iii) compliance with loan covenants; and (iv) proposed programs of activities and \nexpected progress during the next quarter. Within 3 months after physical completion of the \nProject, the EA will prepare and submit to ADB a project completion report on project execution, \nincluding costs and compliance with loan covenants. \n  7.   Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n59.  A  shortlist  of  verifiable  performance  indicators  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  was \nprepared in accordance with ADB's Project Performance Monitoring System (PPMS) Handbook \n(Supplementary Appendix D) during the PPTA. The Government, LGRD, and PCO will ensure \nthat  a  comprehensive  PPMS  is  established  and  maintained  to  monitor  and  evaluate  the \ntechnical performance and social and economic benefits of the Project, especially for the poor \nand for women. The performance monitoring indicators and procedures will be tested with \nrespect to data availability and other constraints, revised if necessary, and institutionalized as \npart of the Project\u2019s management information system. The PUs of the participating towns, with \nPCO assistance, will be responsible for PPMS establishment and monitoring and assessment of ", "15 \nthe performance for subprojects at 6-month intervals. To measure impact of the Project on \nbeneficiaries, particularly low-income groups, accurate baseline information must be established \nat the beginning of subproject implementation. This information will be the basis for determining \nthe  resulting  impacts.  Monitorable  indicators  will  consist  of  (i)  institutional  development \nindicators  covering  revenue  generation  and  financial  management,  along  with  O&M;  (ii) \nsubproject  implementation  indicators  for  the  various  categories  and  types  of  urban \ninfrastructure,  including  levels  of  coverage  and  service  delivery;  and  (iii)  sectoral  impact \nindicators, covering economic growth, public health, and community participation. \n  8.   Project Review \n60.   The EA and ADB will jointly review implementation progress of the Project twice yearly. \nA midterm review will be carried out within 3 years of loan effectiveness. The review will include \na comprehensive evaluation of project implementation arrangements, and include progress \nmade  toward  designed  targets,  consultations  with  community  groups,  appraisal  of  the \ninstitutional  and  policy  development  aspects,  and  if  necessary,  recommendations  for \nadjustments to the project design or implementation arrangements. \n  9.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n61.  The PPTA has carefully identified, with the help of TMAs, the land areas to be acquired \nfor subprojects, and other project effects on resettlement. PPTA surveys show that most of the \nland to be acquired is not productive. Land will be acquired for the Project in accordance with \nthe resettlement plan agreed upon by the Government and ADB. The Project will acquire about \n1,294 hectares (ha) of land for wastewater treatment plants, solid waste landfill sites, and \nslaughterhouses. Of this, PG owns 144 ha and private landowners, 1,150 ha. Acquisition of the \nidentified land is not expected to cause significant loss of livelihood or of community resources. \nBut  it  is  agreed  that  involuntarily  resettlement  under  the  Project  will  be  undertaken  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Handbook  on  Resettlement,  and  to  ADB\u2019s  satisfaction,  and  in \naccordance  with  the  resettlement  plan  (Supplementary  Appendix  E)  that  the  Government \nendorsed and ADB approved. \n10.  Institutional and Financial Action Plans  \n62.  During project preparation, the financial capacity of each TMA was examined to ensure \nthat  each  has  the  financial  means  to  operate  and  maintain  the  existing  and  additional \ninfrastructures. Grant allocations from the Government, using revenue from the general sales \ntax, are the TMAs\u2019 main source of revenue. These allocations comprise 30% to 50% of the \nrevenue of urban centers. The remainder of local government revenue is from water charges; \nimmovable property taxes; and a range of other charges, taxes, and rentals. TMA resource \nmobilization has been limited by weak institutional capacity of local governments and the low \nwillingness of the general public to pay for services.  \n63.  PG and TMAs have agreed to take necessary steps to increase the TMAs' revenue base \nin a sustainable manner, and enhance and stabilize the TMAs\u2019 institutional capacities and \norganizational setups in the light of gap analysis undertaken during the PPTA in comparing the \nPLGO2001 and existing status of TMAs. This involves (i) making adjustments necessary to fully \nalign  the  TMAs\u2019  organizational  and  institutional  structures  in  accordance  with  PLGO2001 \nrequirements; (ii) ensuring TMA compliance in the conduct of business of the tehsil councils; \nadministration of data and information management related to base maps; updating of registers \nand  schedules;  improvement  of  procedures  for  budgeting,  accounting,  billing,  revenue \ncollection, and financial management; and essentials of public disclosure and transparency; and \n(iii) rationalizing the existing low levels of water tariff and implement them incrementally to cover \nO&M of the existing infrastructure and ensure sustainability of future development under the \nProject. TMAs will update consumer databases and prepare an action plan of financial reforms, \nincluding more efficient collection of water and sewerage tariffs, and incremental tariff revisions \nwith improved service delivery over a specified time frame. All of these measures must be \nsatisfactory to ADB. Project sustainability depends on these reforms and adjustments, so PG \n ", "16 \nand TMAs have agreed to make action on them a prerequisite for TMA entry into the Project \n(Appendix 5). Considering that TMA commitment alone will not be a sufficient basis for a \nsuccessful and sustainable investment program, PG has agreed to take policy actions to \nsupport the TMAs in accordance with PLGO2001 (Appendix 6).   \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits and Impacts \n64.  General. The Project will improve the living conditions of about 3.6 million urban residents, \nmostly poor, through improved delivery of basic municipal services. The Project will (i) increase \nsewerage and drainage service coverage; (ii) provide safe water to the poor; and thus (iii) improve \npublic health; (iv) provide treated wastewater for use in agriculture; (v) reduce environmental \ndegradation  and  natural  resource  depletion;  (vi) strengthen  institutional  capabilities  in  urban \nplanning and management, and in overall governance; (vii) generate efficiency gains, reducing \ndistribution leakage and electricity costs in the water supply sector; (vii) improve cost recovery \nthrough better service delivery; (ix) enhance growth of the urban economy; (x) create local \nemployment; and (xi) reduce urban poverty. \n65.  The effectiveness and sustainability of improvements will be reinforced by efforts aimed at \ncommunity development, institutional strengthening, and revenue improvement in the project \ntowns. These efforts will also lead to a stronger sense of belonging at local level; and increased \ncapacities of the newly created TMAs to perform their duties more effectively, especially in \nprovision of O&M for existing, rehabilitated, and new infrastructure facilities. \n66.  Community involvement. The Project will encourage and strengthen collective action \nwithin low-income and under-serviced localities. A main objective of this work will be to make \ninfrastructure investment by TMAs more responsive to demands of low-income groups, more \ninclusive,  more  sustainable,  and  more  cost-effective  than  they  were  through  supply-driven \napproaches. A secondary objective will be to empower low-income groups by giving them the \ncapability for collective action through CBOs, and by forming functional links among communities, \nCBOs, union councils (UCs), and TMAs. \n67.  Public-private  and  community  partnerships.  Private  sector  involvement  will  be \nfostered  and  strengthened.  The  TMAs  will  be  urged  and  assisted  to  define  and  offer \nopportunities for private sector activities, mainly in the transport, recycling, and composting of \nsolid waste; and in municipal slaughterhouse and wastewater treatment plant operations. The \npotential for community partnerships in the delivery of urban services, the form of participation \ndeveloped, and the role of each partner will be influenced by the complexity and the degree to \nwhich the community feels ownership of the work . The array of services (e.g., water, sanitation, \nsolid waste, wastewater treatment), the scale of these services (primary, secondary, or tertiary), \nand the stage of their implementation (planning, construction, or maintenance) create a range of \nopportunities for participation. Therefore, service delivery will be disaggregated, to consider the \npotential  roles  of  partners  at  different  levels  and  to  integrate  them  into  a  practical \nimplementation proposal. \n68.  Poverty reduction.  Socioeconomic surveys in the project towns show that 57% of the \nsample households live on a monthly income of less than Rs.5,000 ($85), which is about the \ncurrent poverty line. Urban poverty in the project towns is multifaceted, ranging from a lack of \nemployment to deficiencies in basic urban services such as water and sewerage and solid \nwaste disposal, to substandard housing. The combination of a shortage of good quality water \nwith  inadequate  sewerage  systems  has  adversely  affected  public  health  and  the  urban \nenvironment.  \n69.  The  Project  will  provide  water  to  the  poor  through  piped  distribution  systems  or \ncommunal water points. For sanitation and wastewater management, sewerage pipe networks ", "17 \nwill  be  rehabilitated  and  expanded  to  low-income  areas,  together  with  simple  wastewater \ntreatment plants. Expected benefits include improvements in public hygiene and health in low-\nincome areas, and reduced pollution of groundwater and surface water in the project towns. \nImproved public health will contribute to a more productive labor force. Employment generated \nin civil works will contribute directly and positively to poverty reduction. Improved solid waste \nmanagement  and  recycling,  preferably  with  private  sector  involvement,  will  also  create \nemployment for the urban poor. Use of treated effluent for irrigation will help improve agriculture \nproduction and income for poor farmers. Appendix 11 shows a summary poverty reduction and \nsocial strategy.  \n70.  Gender. A large part of the Project\u2019s benefits will accrue to women. Women\u2019s time and \nenergy will be saved by provision of water supply to households, whether through pipes  or \ncommunal water points. Women will also enjoy a large part of the benefits of improved sewerage \nbecause (i) women spend more time within the residential neighborhoods than men and thus, will \nbenefit more from improved hygiene there; and (ii) women are traditionally charged with the care \nof sick family members and will thus benefit more from reduced illness. The Project will address \ngender issues by (i) strengthening the role of women councilors in municipal governance; (ii) \ninvolving women groups in community-level project activities; (iii) including women of local \ngovernment  institutions  in  training  activities;  and  (iv)  conducting  community  training  and \nmobilizational campaigns for project beneficiaries in the wards at the UC level to ensure active \nparticipation of women. Supplementary Appendix F gives a gender strategy, which PG has \napproved. \n71.  Enhancing the role of women by providing skills training to increase their income levels \nis an important project facet. Skills training will enable women to set up small enterprises and \nbecome involved in income-generating activities that contribute to household incomes. The \ntraining,  savings,  and  access  to  credit  facilities  such  as  the  ADB-assisted  Microfinance \nDevelopment Program are expected to help increase the incomes and confidence of poor \nwomen in the slums.  \n72.  Minorities and indigenous people. The cultural and ethnic diversity of people in the \nproject towns was reviewed as part of the socioeconomic survey during the PPTA. Detailed \nanalysis showed no evidence of negative impacts on minorities or indigenous people. Some \nhouseholds of a religious minority whose members work as municipal sweepers are in areas \nthat lack water supply and sanitation facilities. The Project will address their needs through (i) \nprovision of public water stand posts in their neighborhoods, (ii) improving access to sewerage \nsystems, (iii) at least 30% employment of women in the community-based program for solid \nwaste management, (iv) participation of men and women community leaders in the users\u2019 \ngroups, and (v) employment of labor from this community in civil works. \n73.  Economic and financial benefits. Economic and financial analyses of the proposed \nsubprojects were undertaken in accordance with ADB's  Framework for the Economic and \nFinancial  Appraisal  of  Urban  Development  Sector  Projects  (Appendixes  12  and  13). The \neconomic benefits identified were based on each subproject in 21 project towns.  Economic \ninternal rates of return (EIRRs) were prepared for 18 sewerage subprojects, 7 water supply \nsubprojects, 12 slaughterhouses, 21 solid waste management subprojects, and 13 subprojects \nfor upgrading of road links in low-income communities. The benefits include significant poverty \nalleviation and improvements in living conditions, particularly in health and hygiene of the largely \npoor urban populations. This will be mainly through sewer connections and improved solid \nwaste collection and disposal. Wastewater treatment will provide additional water for agricultural \nproduction, and reduce environmental damage.  \n \n74.  Health and nonincremental benefits of water supply subprojects include (i) resource cost \nsavings for users obtaining water from secondary sources, which will be contaminated if the \nwater supply subproject is not implemented; and (ii) availability of water that is now being \n ", "18 \nwasted,  after  improvement  of  facilities  under  the  Project.22  Incremental  benefits  include \nadditional water sales to meet suppressed or increased demand of existing customers, and \nadditional sales to new customers who will be connected to the piped network. These benefits \nare based on customers\u2019 willingness to pay. \n75.   The financial internal rate of returns (FIRRs) for subprojects range from 6% to 33% for 6 \nwater supply subprojects, 5% to 30% for 12 slaughterhouses, and 11% to 55% for 21 solid \nwaste  subprojects.  The  incremental  costs  of  some  sub-components  will  be  quite  low  as \ncompared to the incremental revenues which result in high FIRRs.  The FIRRs exceed the \nweighted average cost of capital, which is about 5%, demonstrating that the Project is financially \nviable at proposed tariff levels. Testing of the switching values and sensitivity indicators showed \nthe subprojects to be financially viable under adverse cost and revenue scenarios. \n76.   The EIRR calculation was undertaken in constant 2003 prices using the domestic price \nnumeraire, since the outputs are nontradable in nature. Economic costs, excluding taxes and \nmarket distortions, are converted using a standard conversion factor of 0.85. The EIRRs in the \nproject towns for water supply subprojects range from 17.3% for Rohjan to 45.2% in Multan; \nEIRRS for sewerage range from 13% in Jahanian to 35.5% in Yazman; for solid waste, from \n16.1% in Hasilpur to 57.9% in Khanewal; for slaughterhouses, from 12.2% in Rohjan to 57.4% \nin Ahmadpur East; and link roads in low-income areas, from 14.4% in Qadirpur Ran to 51.1% in \nJahanian.  Switching values and sensitivity indicators were tested, and standard and project-\nspecific sensitivity cases were conducted on key variables, using 20% increases in capital and \nO&M costs and 30% decreases in willingness to pay and number of households benefited. Most \nsubprojects were found economically viable under adverse cost: benefit scenarios, except in \nsmaller towns with lower beneficiary populations and lower economic activity. Supplementary \nAppendix G gives results of the economic analysis of each subproject in 21 project towns. \n77.   Environmental impact. Initial Environmental Examinations (IEEs) were carried out on \nall the subprojects and components as part of the PPTA. The IEEs concluded that the proposed \nsubprojects and components will have no significant adverse impacts on the environment and \nconsequently, no subproject will require an environmental impact assessment. In conformity \nwith  environmental  management  practices,  the  Project  will  develop  and  operationalize  an \nenvironmental monitoring and management plan. PG will ensure that environmental standards \nprescribed by the Punjab Environmental Protection Agency are met. Supplementary Appendix H \ngives a summary IEE. \nB.  Risks \n78.  Major risks associated with the Project include \n(i)  The acquisition of the required land may be delayed or not forthcoming. This could \ndelay or impede the implementation of certain subprojects; \n(ii)  Future  legislation  could  possibly  gradually  erode  the  comprehensiveness  and \nconsistency  of  the  PLGO2001,  which  could  seriously  impede  the  TMAs\u2019 \neffectiveness as main actors in project implementation; \n(iii)  Efforts for enhancement of the revenue base and institutional strengthening of the \nTMAs may not give sufficient and sustainable results. This could affect project \nimplementation or the long-term sustainability of improvements, or both. \n(iv)  Delayed TMA actions in meeting the agreed eligibility criteria may cause start-up \ndelays. \n79.  Major project risks have been minimized, and will be responded to, by the linkage of \nproject  execution  with  the  TMAs\u2019  compliance  with  eligibility  criteria,  extensive  community \nparticipation  to  develop  project  ownership,  and  expected  benefits  and  positive  impacts. \nDevolution  is  a  particular  Government  commitment  to  reform  and  the  Project  is  a  timely \ncontribution to the devolution process.  \n                                                 \n22 Damaged pipes in the water distribution network cause high leakage and wastage of water.

Urbanization and Urban Infrastructure \n1.  Rapid urbanization in Pakistan has overtaxed the abilities of government institutions to \nprovide  adequate  infrastructure  and  urban  services.  Much  of  the  urban  growth  has  been \nuncontrolled and unplanned, because of the absence of effective planning and enforcement \ntools, and insufficient development of human resources. Most towns and cities lack plans for \ncontrolled urban development, and for linkage between the development of new housing and \ncommercial or industrial areas. Most urban areas have not developed the infrastructure and \nurban services needed to support such urban growth and expansion. \n2.    Urban areas suffer from various deficiencies in infrastructure. Town centers generally \nhave most required elements of physical infrastructure, including roads, markets, bus stands, \nwater supply systems without community involvement, sewerage systems, and solid waste \ncollection systems. Some systems, especially roads, markets, and bus stands, suffer capacity \nproblems because urban populations and commercial activities in the town centers have grown \nto a level beyond that for which they were designed. As a result, commercial activities spill over \ninto the streets\u2014which are already overburdened by a vehicle traffic volume far higher than for \nwhich they were designed. \n3.    Systems for water supply, sewerage, and solid waste collection suffer greatly from poor \noperations and maintenance (O&M). The provincial government often designed and constructed \nthe water supply systems, then turned them  over to the local government for O&M. Local \ngovernment then must somehow handle gaps between the design of those systems and the real \nconsumer demand. The gaps are often considerable, and led to poor utilization of those \nsystems, resulting in poor cost recovery and the need for permanent subsidies from local \ngovernment budgets. The collection and disposal of municipal solid waste is mostly poor, with \nno participation of local communities, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), or the private \nsector. Uncollected waste causes adverse environmental effects, such as bad odors and the \nbreeding of flies. Poor collection and removal of solid waste also leads to the clogging of sewer \nlines, a major problem of urban infrastructure systems. Blocked sewer lines make household \nsewage collection ineffective, and cause ponding of sewage in lanes and streets. This leads to \ndamage to private and public property, disruption of traffic, breeding of mosquitoes and other \npests,  and  infiltration  of  sewage  into  shallow  groundwater\u2014which  leads  to  serious  health \nproblems, because most households use the shallow groundwater, through hand or motor \npumps, as their main water sources. Some basic services are totally missing in peripheral and \nunder-serviced areas of most towns. There, people use shallow, brackish water, or take water \nfrom public standposts where available. Sewerage systems are nonexistent, and sewage often \nflows uncontrolled into depressions where it ponds. There is often no organized collection of \nmunicipal solid waste. \nB.  Urban Sector Institutions \n4.    With the Punjab Local Government Ordinance 2001 (PLGO2001), responsibility for \ndelivery of municipal urban services, and for environmental improvement, rests mainly with the \ntehsil municipal administration (TMAs). Some responsibility rests with the lowest level of local \ngovernment, the union councils which are charged with community development and related \ntasks; and with district governments, which handle affairs related to government land as well as \nthe health and education sectors.  \n5.    Implementation of the PLGO2001 has considerably reduced the previously dominating \nroles of provincial agencies, especially of the Housing, Urban Development, and Public Health ", "  Appendix 2  27 \nEngineering Department (HUD&PHED), whose staff has been transferred to local government \nagencies.  \n6.    For major Punjab cities, including Multan, the largest city in the project area, special \ndevelopment authorities had been set up through the Development of Cities Act, 1976. These \nauthorities, which previously worked under HUD&PHED, are now under the TMAs. \n7.    TMAs are supervised by the provincial Local Development and Rural Development \nDepartments (LGRDs), which support and monitor progress in implementation of PLGO 2001, \nincluding all required adjustments and improvements in institutional and organizational setups,  \nas well as financial management. This department is now the provincial agency best suited to \nsteer TMAs in delivery of basic urban services. \n8.    Within the LGRD, the Directorate General of Katchi Abadi and Urban Improvement (DG \nKAUI) has been given the specific responsibility of resolving problems related to katchi abadis \n(unauthorized settlements or slums on state-owned lands, with little or no infrastructure).  \nC.  Government Policies and Plans \n9.    Pakistan\u2019s national urban and housing policy is reflected in the Ten Year Perspective \nDevelopment Plan 2001\u20132011, which describes the main urban problems as (i) environmental \ndegradation, mushrooming of  katchi abadis, and breakdown of infrastructure and municipal \nservices; (ii) lack of vision, inadequate institutional setup, and weak financial bases, (iii) a \nbacklog  of  2 million housing units, in addition to the 2.3 million units that are structurally \nobsolete; and (iv) the absence of a housing finance institution to provide affordable loans for \nhouse construction. \n10.   The plan envisages the following strategies for urban development: (i) strengthening the \nrole  of  local  organizations  in  planning,  determining  needs,  preparing  action  plans,  and \naugmenting  capacities  for  water  supply  and  sanitation  services;  (ii)  developing  satellite, \nintermediate or  secondary,    and  industrial  towns  as  employment  centers;  (iii) preparing or \nupdating master plans; (iv) implementing the national policy on katchi abadis; and (v) upgrading \nkatchi abadis and slums through integrated packages for area improvement. \n11.   For water supply and sanitation, the plan envisages providing water supply services to \nan additional 55 million persons (28 million rural and 27 million urban), thus increasing national \nservice coverage from 63% to 84%; and sanitation facilities for an additional 54 million persons \n(26 million rural and 28 million urban), thus increasing national sanitation coverage from 39% to \n63%. Private sector participation in water supply for major cities will be encouraged, and the \ninstitutional capacity of water supply and sanitation agencies will be upgraded.  \n12.   Pakistan\u2019s National Housing Policy 2001 acknowledges the need for development of \nhousing for the poor and needy. It envisages a strategy that combines community participation, \ninstitutional strengthening, and the development of a commercially oriented system of housing \nfinance. It also emphasizes addressing the problem of katchi abadis, squatter settlements, and \nslums through regulation where appropriate, relocation where required, and urban improvement. \n13.  The Government is committed to increasing annual pro-poor budgetary expenditures by \nthe current 0.2% of gross domestic product (GDP) to 4.0% of GDP in FY2004. The Pakistan \nPoverty Alleviation Fund, established in 1997 to finance community income-generating projects, \nmicroenterprises,  and  infrastructure  projects,  mainly  through  nongoverment  organizations \n(NGOs) and the private sector, has begun lending activities. In April 2000, the Government \nlaunched  the  National  Poverty  Alleviation  Program,  with  the  objectives  of  stimulating \n ", "28  Appendix 2 \nemployment and providing basic infrastructure and services to rural and low-income urban \nareas. A new program was initiated to rehabilitate the poor by giving one-time rehabilitation \ngrants ranging from Rs5,000 to RS50,000 from the Zakat Fund. The Government increased \nfunding for a small public works program, the Khushal Pakistan Program, which aims to provide \ngainful employment for the poor, plus develop essential infrastructure such as farm-to-market \nroads, water supply schemes, and school repair in rural and low-income urban areas. The \nGovernment also set up the Khushali Bank, Pakistan\u2019s first microfinance bank, with financial \nsupport from the Asian Development Bank (ADB)23 in August 2001.  The Government  has \ninitiated a mechanism for the quarterly tracking of antipoverty expenditures on the Finance \nDivision\u2019s web site. Most intermediate human development indicators are now reported annually.  \n14.  In line with goals of the National Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS), the Punjab \nPRS also emphasizes, as among key factors to reduce poverty in Punjab,  restoration of \ngood governance, enhancement of public expenditures, improvement in service delivery for \nsocial sectors, and addressing of environmental concerns. \nD.  Relevant ADB Strategies \n15.  ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program Update (2004\u20132006) for Pakistan focuses on \nsupporting poverty reduction by assisting in the strategic areas of good governance, sustainable \npro-poor economic growth, and inclusive social development. This strategy continues to be \nrelevant, and in line with priorities of the new government.  ADB lending to devolved sectors will \naim to strengthen devolution, by ensuring that future ADB projects are designed to be consistent \nwith the new governance structure under local government ordinances of August 2001. Where \nappropriate, efforts will be made to realign recently approved ADB projects for devolved sectors. \nADB will continue to emphasize the delivery of social services to support both increased public \nsector allocations made possible by enhanced fiscal space; and improved governance through \ndevolution and better sector administration and financial management. ADB\u2019s water policy also \nsupports  its  poverty  reduction  strategy  by  addressing  each  of  the  three  elements  of  its \nframework for poverty reduction (pro-poor sustainable growth, social development, and good \ngovernance). The main focus of ADB assistance to the urban sector will be on environmental \naspects and the needs of the poor. Assistance will cover, broadly, institutional restructuring and \ndevolution of service delivery, private sector involvement in the delivery of selected services, \nbudgeting and finance, increased cost recovery and municipal revenue; increased community \nparticipation;  and  attainment  of  the  millennium  development  goals  (MDGs).

In subsequent years, the PFC Grant will be allocated according to the formula agreed with \nADB. Performing TMAs will be entitled to withdraw their agreed allocation and the TMAs that fail \nto meet minimum performance targets will forfeit their share of the PFC Grant. Any unused \nshares will be credited to the investment pool (Investment Pool) and will be available, annually, \nfor reallocation to other TMAs based on a performance evaluation of the TMAs, as provided \nunder the following performance measures (Performance Measures) and the Investment Pool:  \n \n(i)  Investment Project-specific Performance Measures (IPPM): \n \n15.  The IPPM will include measures to be observed by TMAs to ensure the effective use of \nresources allocated to individual investment projects. The performance of the TMAs will be \nmeasured and evaluated on a sliding scale as follows: \n  \n(i)  operations  of  PUs  (fully  staffed,  equipped  and  functional  10  points; \ninadequate in above areas 0-5 points depending on deficiency); \n(ii)  community  participation  in  sub-projects  (satisfactory  10  points;  partly \nsatisfactory 5 point; unsatisfactory 0 point); \n(iii)  compliance of TMAs with agreed targets for physical progress (variance of \nactual versus stipulated progress within 10% (10 points); between 10-20% (5-\n10 points); more than 20% (0 point); \n(iv)  quality of construction in general (satisfactory 10 points, partly satisfactory 5 \npoints, and unsatisfactory 0 point); \n(v)  observance of the PLGO 2001 in respect of maintenance of accounts, closing \nof accounts (satisfactory 10; unsatisfactory 0); \n(vi)  tendering and procurement (transparent 10 point;  problematic 0 point); \n(vii)  TMA  staff  involved  in  construction  supervision  (fully  involved  10  points; \npartially involved 0 point); \n(viii)  PIRC meetings, (held regularly 10 points; irregular 5 points; not held 0 point); \n(ix)  progress reports, submitted by PUs to PCO (regularly 10 points, irregular \nsubmission 5 points, not submitted 0 points); and \n(x)  monitoring and evaluation (M & E) (TMA staff deputed and fully involved in \nM&E 10 points; partly involved 5-9 points; not deputed/ involved 0 point).   \n \n16.  A TMA must secure 70 points to qualify for a PFC Grant.  Full compliance under (v) to \n(vii) and a minimum of 5 points each under (i) to (iv) and (ix) to (x) will be mandatory to qualify \nfor a PFC Grant.    \n \n(ii)  Reform Implementation Performance Measures (RIPM): \n \n17.  The RIPM will further strengthen the reforms undertaken by TMAs by fulfilling the \neligibility criteria. The performance of the TMAs will be evaluated and measured as follows: \n ", "34  Appendix 5 \n \n(i)  Effective functioning of complaints cells (number of staff recruited and facilities \nprovided,  number  of  complaints  registered  and  addressed,  efficiency  of \ncomplaints addressed, public feedback on the performance); \n(ii)  Implementation of actions specified in the PLGO 2001 for transfer of functions to \nUCs; \n(iii)  TMA  accounts  showing  utilization  of  the  twenty-five  percent  (25%)  of \ndevelopment budget by CCBs; \n(iv)  Improved public access to information, demonstrated by: (a) posting of approved \nTMA  annual  budget  at  designated  public  places  (TMA  offices,  TMA \nhospital/health  unit,  etc);  (b)  posting  of  listing  of  approved  schemes  and \nimplementation schedules at TMA offices, and (c) posting within one month of \nthe close of any quarter, a statement of accounts/expenditures for each sub-\nproject at TMA offices; \n(v)  completion and publication of the results of the user survey; implementation of \nthe action plan on financial reforms; and implementation of the tariff plan; \n(vi)  Completion of the revenue enhancement base-line survey etc; and \n(vii)  Implementation of budget rules in accordance with PLGO 2001 on detailing \narrears.  \n \n18.  TMAs will be evaluated on a sliding scale of one (1) to five (5), with 5 representing 100% \nperformance by a TMA within a specific category. A total of 25 points, with minimum 3 points in \neach category, will be considered satisfactory to qualify for a PFC Grant.   \n \n19.  PG will suspend disbursements to an ongoing subproject and reallocate funds of the \nPFC Grant to the Investment Pool should a TMA fail to score 70 points in IPPM and 25 points in \nRIPM. To meet the criteria specified in the Performance Measures, PCO will assist the TMA in \nresolving the issues affecting the implementation progress of the subproject and will facilitate \ncontinuing compliance with the required actions under the eligibility criteria. Should the TMA \nperformance improve, PCO will report such improvement to LGRD. A joint review mission of \nPCO, TMA, LGRD, and consultants will verify the situation and depending on the satisfactory \nresults, LGRD will permit such TMA to have access to the funds available in the Investment \nPool. \n \nC.   Investment Pool \n \n20.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector identified as a National Priority in  Yes  Sector identified as a National Priority in  Yes \nCountry Poverty Analysis?    Country Poverty Partnership Agreement?     \nContribution of Subsector to Poverty Reduction in Pakistan \nPakistan faces the twin challenges of reviving economic growth and reducing poverty. The incidence of poverty \nin Pakistan has risen slowly but steadily during the 1990s, from 29.3% in 1993\u20131994 to 32.2% in 1998\u20131999. \nPoverty in urban area is estimated as 22.4%. Only 63% of the country\u2019s population has access to safe drinking \nwater (83% in urban areas, and 53% in rural areas). Proper sanitation facilities are available to only 39% of the \npopulation (59% in urban areas, and 27% in rural areas). Poor access to water supply and sanitation is often \nassociated with poor health. Consolidated (federal and provincial) expenditures on water supply and sanitation \nhave actually decreased over the past 5 years, both in nominal terms and as a percentage of gross domestic \nproduct (GDP). Consolidated public expenditures on water supply and sanitation (public health engineering) \nhave come down from Rs6.3 billion in 1995\u20131996 (0.30% of GDP) to Rs4.5 billion in 2000\u20132001 (0.13% of \nGDP). As a result, extension of public water supply and sanitation facilities has not kept pace with the growing \nneeds of the rising population. \nPoverty incidence also varies significantly among provinces. Punjab province has the second-highest incidence \nof poverty, after North West Frontier province, in both rural and urban areas. Within Punjab, poverty differs \nconsiderably from south to north. The level of economic development and income in southern Punjab is \ngenerally lower than in northern Punjab, where a great deal of development efforts and investments, especially \nindustrial investments, have been concentrated in recent years. Urban areas of northern Punjab have the \ncountry\u2019s lowest poverty level (13%), but urban poverty in southern Punjab is the highest in Pakistan (35% in \nFY1999, up from 28% in 1993). Poverty in southern Punjab is largely caused by limitations to growth of the \nagricultural sector, which is in turn related to an increasing shortage of irrigation water. This rural poverty spills \nover into the towns and cities, where more than half of the populations are often classified as poor, suffering \nfrom a lack of employment, low household incomes, and lack of basic services.  \nThe Poverty Partnership Agreement between the Government of Pakistan and the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) reflects Government\u2019s vision for poverty reduction and key priorities of the ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and \nProgram. ADB\u2019s country strategy for Pakistan emphasizes water supply, sanitation and urban development, and \nthe need to target the poor to reduce both poverty and inequalities. The Government has agreed that long-term \npoverty reduction requires sharper focus on good governance, allocation for social sectors, and improving basic \nsocial  services  to  enhance  human  development.  The  Poverty  Partnership  Agreement  also  focuses  on \nattainment of the millennium development goals (MDGs). ADB aims to help the Government make devolution a \nsuccess and improve service delivery and municipal services, with particular focus on services for the poor.   \nThe  Project  will  foster  institutional  development  of  the  local  government\u2019s  tehsil  (subdistrict)  municipal \nadministrations (TMAs) in Punjab, and will finance infrastructure improvements in 21 project towns that focus on \nwater supply, sewerage and wastewater management, solid waste  management,  slaughterhouses,  and \nprograms on hygiene and environmental awareness. The Project aims to improve living conditions and health \nstatus of the people in project towns. Access to safe drinking water, improved sanitation, and improved \nenvironmental quality will reduce vulnerability to environmental hazards for the poor communities. Improved \nquantity and quality of domestic water supply and sanitation facilities will reduce morbidity and mortality, \nespecially for young children.  The availability of safe drinking water supplies will reduce water-carrying time, \nwhich will benefit mainly women and girls. A better environment in the urban areas will improve the quality of life \nand productive capacity of the residents, many of whom are poor. Improved institutional capacity of local \ngovernment  will  provide  opportunities  for  effective  local  planning,  improved  institution  and  financial \nmanagement, and collaboration between local people and local government officials to ensure sustainability of \nurban services infrastructure in small towns.        \nB.  Poverty Analysis    Proposed Classification: Poverty intervention \nUntil recently, Punjab\u2019s economy was based largely on agriculture, but growth prospects for agriculture are \nlimited, largely because of the restricted availability of water suitable for irrigation. Thus, the province is \ndeveloping into a more urban economy with high-income inequalities and entrenched poverty with slums and \nsquatter settlements, and urban environmental degradation. The main factors that contribute to the rapid rise in \nurban populations are migration from rural to urban areas and extension of municipal boundaries. \n ", "44   Appendix 11 \nA socioeconomic survey in the project towns indicated that 57% of the sample households live on a monthly \nincome of less than Rs5,000 ($85), which is about the current poverty line. The highest percentage of poor \nhouseholds among the sample households (66%) is in Bahawalpur, followed by 61% in Jatoi, Jahanian, \nKhanewal, Qadirpur Ran, and Shujabad. Most of the poor are employed as casual laborers, but the second-\nlargest group is unemployed. Urban poverty in the project towns is multifaceted, ranging from a lack of \nemployment to deficiencies in basic urban services such as water, sewerage, and solid waste disposal, to \nsubstandard housing. \nA socioeconomic survey in 22 prospective project towns showed that about 92% of the sample households \nhave access to piped water, and 8% use public standpipes. But the water supply is intermittent, and delivery is \nmostly less than 50 liters/person per day. Also, the water quality often falls below the standards of the World \nHealth Organization for drinking water, mainly because of bacteriological contamination as a result of poor \nsanitation facilities and, in some locations, because of salinity. About 84% of the sample households have \ntoilets inside their houses, while 16% must defecate in open spaces such as along river banks or drainage or \nirrigation canals, or in empty plots. \nThe coverage of sewerage systems, which are often combined with storm water drainage systems, in the urban \nareas is limited. Final treatment of sewage is inadequate in all project towns. Only 25% of the sample \nhouseholds have access to adequate sewerage systems. The other households suffer from various degree of \nenvironmental pollution in their neighborhoods, through the disposal of wastewater in open drains, and flooding \nof such wastewater in the residential neighborhoods. There is no wastewater treatment plant in the project area, \nand raw sewage is disposed in irrigation channels or open fields.  \nThe combined shortage of quality water and inadequate sewerage adversely affects public health and urban \nenvironments. The lack of adequate water supply facilities and sewerage systems is a particular burden on \nwomen because women are mainly responsible for water collection, for family health maintenance, and for \ncaring for sick family.  \nThe Project will provide water to poor communities through piped distribution systems and communal water \npoints. The component for sanitation and wastewater management will provide expanded sewerage pipe \nnetworks to low-income areas, along with simple wastewater treatment plants. The systems will be designed to \ngive the urban poor adequate access to improved sanitation. Expected benefits are public hygiene and health \nimprovement in low-income areas, and reduced pollution of groundwater and surface water in the project towns. \nImproved public health will contribute to a more productive labor force. Employment generation in civil works will \nbe another direct positive contribution of the Project to poverty reduction. Improved solid waste management \nand recycling, preferably with private sector involvement, will also create employment for the urban poor. Use of \ntreated effluent for irrigation will improve agricultural production and income for poor farmers.  \nThe Project will also ensure that poor households of low-caste communities have access to basic services and \nresources. Some households of a religious minority whose members work as municipal sweepers live in areas \nthat lack water supply and sanitation facilities more than in other project towns. The Project will address their \nneeds through (i) provision of public water stand posts in their neighborhoods; (ii) improving access to sewerage \nsystems;  (iii)  at  least  30%  employment  of  women  in  the  community-based  program  for  solid  waste \nmanagement; (iv) participation of women and men community leaders in the users\u2019 groups; (v) participation of \nwomen and men in environmental awareness, health, and hygiene campaigns; and (vi) employment of labor \nfrom this community in civil works. \nC.

These \ncommittees will include both men and women, and local ward councilors. (ii) Representation from low-caste \ncommunities and ethnic minority groups will serve on committees for planning of project activities.  \nNongovernment organizations and community-based organizations, as well as women\u2019s groups, will participate \nin implementing the solid waste management component.  Community-level committees will be formed to \nconduct awareness campaigns for solid waste management. ", "            Appendix 11  45\nD.  Gender and Development \nStrategies to maximize impacts on women. \nGender issues will be addressed in the project components in the following ways:  \nLocal government. Involvement of women councilors in municipal activities is minimal. The Project will facilitate \nstrengthening of the role of women councilors in municipal governance through (i) capacity building and training \non the role and responsibility of women, and planning of development activities that involve them; (ii) training \nworkshops on gender sensitization for men and women councilors from union councils (UCs); (iii) representation \nof women councilors on ward and community planning committee; (iv)  representation of women in various user \ngroups, such as committees for lane level sewerage management and solid waste management.  \nCommunity-level project activities. (i) NGOs and CBOs will form women groups in wards and neighborhoods \nfor social mobilization activities. (ii) Women will be represented in the planning of infrastructure and facilities for \nwater, sanitation, and basic urban services. (iii) Preference will go to the allocation of land for low-income housing \nfor widows and deserted or divorced women from poor households. (iv) A percentage of land for low-income \nhousing  will  be  allocated  to  women  from  poor  households,  based  on  an  assessment  during  project \nimplementation. (v) Employment opportunities in civil works will be made available to interested women from poor \nhouseholds. (vi) Women\u2019s groups will be represented in the management of new facilities. (vii) Women will be the \nprimary target for public health and hygiene campaigns. (viii) Women community volunteers will be trained for \nhealth and hygiene campaigns.  \nTraining activities. Training activities for local government institutions will include women officials. Community \ntraining and mobilization campaigns for project beneficiaries will ensure active participation of women.  \nThe Project will ensure that representatives of low castes and poor women participate in user groups, social \nmobilization and campaign activities, access to basic urban services and allocation of land and shelter. Thirty \npercent of the community-based solid waste management employment will be reserved for women from the low-\nincome Christian communities.    \nAt east one professional in the project coordination office will be female. One female will serve as community \ndevelopment and social mobilization officerin each project implementation unit. A national consultant on gender \nand  development  will  be  included  in  the  consulting  services  to  develop  a  gender  action  plan  during  \nimplementation of the plan. Gender disaggregated monitoring indicators and databases will be developed for the \nmanagement information systems at  the UC and TMA levels during design and implementation of subprojects.   \nSupplementary Appendix F gives the detailed gender strategy.  \nE.

Methodology and Approach \n1.  The economic analysis for this project was in accordance with Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) guidelines, including Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects and Framework for \nthe Economic and Financial Appraisal of Urban Development Sector Projects. The analysis \ndescribes the economic rationale and target beneficiaries, and compares the \u201cwithout project\u201d and \n\u201cwith project\u201d situations. Economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) were prepared for sewerage \nsubprojects in 18 towns, for water supply subprojects in 7 towns, for slaughterhouses in 12 towns, \nfor solid waste management in 21 towns, and for upgrading of access roads in low-income \ncommunities in 13 towns.  \n2.  The analysis compares the calculated EIRR to the economic opportunity cost of capital \n(EOCC), which is assumed to be 12%.24 Standard and project-specific sensitivity tests were also \nconducted  to  assess  robustness  of  the  EIRR  calculation.  The  economic  analysis  uses  the \ndomestic price numeraire because benefits are nontradable. Financial costs are converted to \neconomic costs. For this purpose, tradable and nontradable goods are split. In practice, this \nmeans using foreign costs, including any indirect foreign costs, as tradables and local costs as \nnontradables. Taxes and duties are excluded.25 The shadow exchange rate factor (SERF) is used \nto convert tradables to domestic prices.26 All costs and benefits are at constant 2003 prices [???] \nand on incremental bases. Price contingencies are excluded from economic costs, but include \nphysical contingencies. The capital and operation and maintenance (O&M) costs are based on \nthe design capacity requirements until 2025. Replacement cost for pumping and equipment \nequivalent to 10% of total capital cost is assumed every 10 years.27   \n3.  The economic evaluation considered willingness to pay for improved municipal services, \ndetermined on the basis of a socioeconomic survey of households and community consultations. \nThe surveys showed a low willingness to pay,28 compared with the affordability levels of both the \npoor and non-poor households. That apparently reflects the potential beneficiaries\u2019 doubts about \nthe capacity of tehsil municipal administrations (TMAs) to deliver effective urban services. Once \nthe subprojects are completed and effectively managed by tehsils (subdistricts), it is expected that \npeople will be willing to pay more for improved services and to sustain project benefits.  \nB.  Sewerage Improvement Subprojects \n4.   The  sewerage  improvement  subprojects  will  be  implemented  across  low-income \ncommunities and  katchi abadis on a town-wide basis with low service coverage levels. The \nsubprojects will reduce the incidence of ponding and divert domestic wastewater to suitable \ndisposal sites in 18 towns. It was reported that in most parts of project towns, wastewater that has \nbeen improperly disposed into blocked drains and sewers may have contaminated water tables \n                                                 \n24  ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects, Manila.  \n25 For this project, local taxes are excluded at a rate of 15% percent plus import duties.   \n26 SERF is calculated to be 1.2, based on the weighted average tariff of 20% (Punjab Statistics Office). Tradables or \nforeign costs are in the civil works subproject for water supply (10% of the project water supply cost). For equipment \nand materials, tradables comprise 31% for water supply equipment cost, 67% for sewerage equipment, and 22% for \nsolid waste management. \n27 A residual value equivalent to 30% of project costs is assumed in year 20 to take into account the remaining \neconomic life of civil works and pipelines.   \n28 The FGD results indicate that willingness to pay ranges from Rs20 to Rs80 in low-income communities for sewerage, \nRs10 to Rs30 for water,  and Rs5 to Rs10 for solid waste management. The participants indicated that these fees \ncan be tripled for middle- and high-income households. In Multan and Bahawalpur, where quantitative surveys \ninclude WTP, the respondents indicate WTPs of Rs50 to Rs100 per household. ", "                                        Appendix 12      47 \nand  caused  the  spread  of  diseases,  increased  pest  incidence,  odors,  and  other  problems \n(reported by an average of 71% of households).29   \n5.  Sewerage lines and storm water drainage subprojects involve rehabilitating and upgrading \nexisting sewers and drains, construction of new sewer lines to establish an interconnected \nnetwork with suitable outflow, and sewerage treatment. \n6.  For the sewerage components, benefits accrue to (i) households that will be provided \nsewerage services, (ii) those who will use the treated wastewater such as the farmers in lieu of or \nin addition to other irrigation water, and (iii) the Government in terms of avoiding damage to public \nproperty such as roads by eliminating water pondage.30 Benefits to households are measured in \nterms of their WILLINGNESS TO PAY for the service, and incorporates their perceptions of the \nvalue of improved services in terms of avoidance of diseases caused by ponding, both outside \nand inside the homes; avoidance of damage to private property; and enhanced property value.  \n7.  Farmers now obtain untreated wastewater from disposal stations for use in growing \nvegetables, bamboo, and grass for animals. Farmers save about PRs5,000 per hectare yearly on \nfertilizer cost of by using untreated wastewater. Also, there is now a shortage of irrigation water. \nFarmers\u2019 groups indicated their willingness to use treated wastewater from the Project. Benefits to \nfarmers who will use treated wastewater will be assessed in terms of their WILLINGNESS TO \nPAY,  which  is  about  PRs1,200  to  PRs2,000  per  acre  yearly.  Other  benefits  from  treating \nwastewater are avoidance of disease incidence among farming households. Use of treated \nwastewater will decrease the Irrigation Department\u2019s annual cost of desilting irrigation canals, \nestimated to be PRs1.7 million in Multan; 60% to70% of the desilting cost is caused by disposal of \nuntreated wastewater. \nC.  Water Supply Subprojects \n8.  The Project focuses on a secure and sustainable supply of good quality potable water to \nurban low-income communities in seven project towns, and generally comprises communal water \nsystems, communal water transportation, distribution systems, tubewells, transmission lines, and \nreservoirs. Access to clean, safe, and reliable water supply systems will particularly benefit urban \nlow-income communities, and small businesses and institutions in the entire project area.31 \nSpecific service delivery targets for water supply and water quality are based on consultation with \ntehsils and communities.  \n9.  For water supply components, the major economic benefits comprise (i) cost savings on \nthe nonincremental supply to connected and nonconnected households, and (ii) willingness to \npay, based on average demand price for incremental water supplies. Nonincremental benefits for \nconnected  and  nonconnected  households  are  quantified  using  the  resource  cost  savings \napproach for (i) use of alternative water sources, (ii) time and cost savings for water collection, (iii) \nnontechnical losses, and (iv) savings in health expenditures due to water contamination by \narsenic and salinity. Incremental benefits are valued using WILLINGNESS TO PAY. Values for \n                                                 \n29 WTP of lower-income households, which range from Rs20 to Rs50 per month, and of relatively higher income \nhouseholds, which range from Rs50 to Rs100, is lower than the affordability levels, which were computed at 3% to \n5% of monthly income. The WTP is about 50% of the affordability levels in both low- and high-income classes.  \n30 Benefits that were not quantified include savings of local governments in costs of maintenance and reconstruction of \nroads and public buildings. Improvement will also enable the tehsils to raise property taxes because of increased \nproperty values and improved willingness of households to pay, thus increasing the efficiency of tax collection. \nImproved  sanitary  and  environmental  conditions  will  also  reduce  public  health  expenditures  for  low-income \npopulations for waterborne, respiratory and vectorborne diseases.  \n31  New property connections to be installed in unserved low-income areas will help meet demands for rapidly growing \npopulations (2.6% pa in Multan, 5.1% in Bahawalpur, and higher than 3.3% in the other towns). In Multan, bulk, \nzonal, and individual property metering will be introduced. \n ", "48  Appendix 12 \npotable water consumption are based on the cost of potable water for a minimum drinking \nrequirement for the average 5% to 10% of the middle-income group among the nonconnected \nhouseholds.  \n10.  Time savings and willingness to pay for water collection by nonconnected households are \nbased on the social survey. Health benefits are calculated based on the avoided costs of \ntreatment.  Official  health  statistics  were  used  to  help  calculate  the  impact  of  water  supply \nimprovements on waterborne disease incidence,32 and interviews with medical personnel in local \nhospitals for costs of medical treatment.33  \nD.  Solid Waste \n11.  The Project will focus on the development of landfill sites in towns that have no landfill \nfacilities, the purchase of equipment for use in garbage collection and disposal, and incinerators \nfor  disposal  of  hospital  wastes.  The  towns  now  have  systems  for  garbage  collection  from \nhouseholds, but only about 60% of garbage generated is actually collected. The remaining 40% of \nuncollected garbage finds its way into storm drains and sewer lines, clogging them and eventually \ncausing high flooding incidence.34 The major economic benefit identified for the Project is the \nresidents\u2019 willingness to pay for clean and efficient collection and disposal of their waste. The \nsocioeconomic survey conducted in each town showed that 75% to 85% of total residents \nexpressed a willingness to pay of from PRs20 to PRs50 for low-income households, to from \nPRs50 to PRs100 for high-income households.  \nE.  Road Links \n12.  The proposed road links are to improve access of low-income residents to the education, \nhealth, and livelihood opportunities in the town centers. All of the current road links, mostly narrow \nlanes, are in poor condition with low vehicular traffic volume. Improvement of the road links is \nexpected to enhance economic activity in low-income areas, resulting in improved land values. \n13.  Benefits identified include increased land values and savings in vehicle operating costs for \nlow-volume traffic.35 The increase in land values was used to estimate the benefits of the \nimproved roads. It was assumed that about 100 meters on each side of the roads will be affected \ndirectly, but land value will actually increase, because of enhanced pedestrian mobility pedestrian \nand increased nonmotorized traffic, in only 20% of the affected area. The increased economic \nactivity will be through the proliferation of commercial activity along the road. Because these \nroads lead to low-income communities, the increase in land values was assumed to be 1% \nthroughout the evaluation period.  \nF.  Slaughterhouses \n14.  The existing slaughterhouses in the towns are either in poor condition with obsolete \nfacilities, or are in residential areas and thus, nuisances because of odors and health risks to \nresidents. Furthermore, unsanitary practices in the slaughterhouses pose a health hazard to the \nmeat-consuming public. For these reasons, it was proposed that new slaughterhouse facilities be \n                                                 \n32 The morbidity rate caused by waterborne diseases in Pakistan is about 9%, according to data from the World Health \nOrganization.  \n33 Interviews with medical personnel in private clinics and hospitals in Multan indicate that treatment costs of \nwaterborne diseases range from Rs1,200  to Rs6,400 per case. Treatment costs, which average about Rps 2,000 per \ncase, include transport to clinics or hospitals, doctors\u2019 fees, medicine, laboratorwork, and use of hospital beds. \n34 Benefits from avoidance of flood damage were not included because of a lack of data on flood damage costs to \npublic and private infrastructures, the extent of areas flooded, and the frequency and duration of flooding in each  \ntown. \n35 Vehicle operating cost savings are negligible in most cases because mostly smaller, nonmotorized, and few \nmotorized, vehicles pass through these narrow lanes. Most traffic is donkey carts, bicycles, and motorcycles. ", "                                        Appendix 12      49 \nbuilt  outside  of  nine  towns,  away  from  residential  areas.  Existing  slaughterhouses  will  be \nrehabilitated in three towns. \n15.  For the economic evaluation, it was assumed that about 20% of the households will \nsomehow be affected and that at least one member of each of those households will become sick \nat least 1 day in a year because of eating spoiled meat from animals slaughtered in the existing \nfacilities.36 Furthermore, it was assumed that each person who becomes ill will spend about \nPRs150 on medical expenses.37 For slaughterhouses that will be relocated from the town center, \ntravel costs might increase for bringing animals to the new sites. But according to the TMAs, \nbecause the new sites will be where animal populations are highest, that increase will be negated \nby decreased transport costs for animals that are raised nearer to the proposed sites. It is highly \nprobable that environmental benefits from improved sanitary conditions may not be fully reflected \nin reduced health costs. Therefore, subprojects that have lower EIRRs, but where unquantifiable \nenvironmental benefits comprise the major benefits, may warrant acceptance.   \nG.  Results \n16.  For the evaluated subprojects, base case EIRRs exceed the EOCC, which is assumed to \nbe 12%. Standard sensitivity tests were conducted for a 10% increase in capital and operating \ncosts and a 10% reduction in subproject benefits, and a worst-case scenario of a combined 10% \ndecrease in benefits and 10% increase in costs. Additional project-specific sensitivity cases have \nbeen undertaken to determine the impact of changes in key variables on subproject viability and \ninclude: (i) a 1-year delay in project benefits, 20% decrease in willingness to pay, and 20% \ndecline in number of households served due to lower operational efficiencies for subprojects for \nsewerage, water supply, and solid waste management; (ii) for slaughterhouses, a 20% decrease \nin households affected by meat spoilage; and (iii) for road links, a 20% decrease in area affected \nand a 15% decrease in assumed land values. Some subprojects in smaller towns became \nmarginally  feasible  under  the  worst-case  scenario  and  worst-case  sensitivity  tests  on  key \nvariables. Resulting EIRRs are most sensitive to decline in project benefits. Switching values and \nsensitivity indicators were likewise calculated and are presented in Table A12.1 to Table A12.5.38 \nSupplementary Appendix G presents a more detailed economic evaluation of each subproject, \nand results of the distribution analysis for each town.  \nH.  Other Project Benefits \n17.  Successful implementation of subprojects in each town will improve public health and \nsafety, community relations, safety of pedestrians and children, and living conditions of urban \npoor in low-income communities. Successful implementation will reduce maintenance costs and \ntravel time for workers. Furthermore, the capability building and training component will upgrade \nthe  management  and  financial  capacity  of  TMAs,  and  enhance  cost  recovery  of  municipal \nservices through improved collection efficiency and better willingness to pay of users. The Project \nwill  support  urban  poverty  reduction  through  its  direct  impact  on  employment  and  income-\ngenerating opportunities.39 A summary of unquantifiable economic, social, and environmental \n                                                 \n36 No data are available on the incidence of sickness among residents living near the slaughterhouses, or on meat \neaters as a result of unsanitary practices and obsolete facilities. \n37 In smaller towns, medical expenses increase with travel costs to and from local clinics and hospitals. \n38 The higher the sensitivity index, the more sensitive the net present value is to the concerned variable. The lower the \nswitching value, the more sensitive the net present value is to the change in the variable. \n39 Improvements to the slaughterhouse, solid waste management, sewerage and water supply system will provide \ndirect employment. Temporary employment for both skilled and unskilled labor will also be provided in the project \narea during construction, operation, and maintenance of project facilities. Although the community at large will benefit \nfrom basic services improvements, a positive distributional effect to the urban poor is also expected.

The economic impact of the Project has been identified as generating more employment \nopportunities and improved quality of living standards. The impact of the Project on poverty will \nvary  with  individual  components,  and  the  way  the  TMAs  execute  them.  Most  subproject \ncomponents will directly benefit the poor, and indirectly benefit the entire urban population of the \nTMAs concerned. \n19.   The total urban population in the 21 project towns eligible to participate in the Project is \nestimated at about 15 million. The total potential beneficiaries will be about 3.6 million people. \n                                                                                                                                                                \nlarge proportion of the employment created by the Project will be in low-skills jobs, which can be done by the urban \npoor. \n ", "                                        Appendix 12      51 \nPrimary beneficiaries of the environmental improvements will be women, children, the elderly, and \nthe urban poor in low-income communities because most are in underdeveloped areas that are \naffected by ponding and flooding. Commercial establishments will also benefit because drainage \nand sewerage improvements enhance business properties and other infrastructure.   \n20.  Based on the infrastructure demand revealed by the 21 tehsils, and surveys of and \nconsultation with low-income communities, the distribution of infrastructure investment in the \nproject area is estimated to be (i) about 18% of overall investment for road links and municipal \nservices for low-income areas; (ii) about 21% for sewerage links in low-income areas, (ii) about \n19%  for  water  supply,  (iii)  about  5%  for  solid  waste  management,  (iv)  about  1%  for \nslaughterhouses,  and (v) the remainder for project management, incremental land development, \nand other municipal services.  \n21.  Based on assessment of the subprojects, low-skilled laborers will need to be for 40\u201350% \nof the civil works construction. The Project is estimated to generate a minimum of 8,500 person-\nmonths of employment for the poor. Considering the distribution of physical investment across \nsubsectors, the Project is estimated to provide (i) better sewerage facilities and services for more \nthan 1.5 million poor people, (ii) improved water supply and affordable water systems for at least \n1 million poor people, (iii) improved solid waste collection for about 1.2 million urban poor, (iv) \nimproved roads and accessibility for at least 1 million urban poor people in low-income areas, and \n(v) other public facilities and services to raise the living standards of poor people. \nJ.  Conclusion \n22.  The Project components are economically viable and are robust to adverse cost and \nbenefit scenarios. The calculated EIRRs are expected to be lower than the true EIRR since the \neconomic, social, and environmental implications of not undertaking the Project are severe, and \nwould worsen conditions for the urban poor in the subproject areas.  \n \n ", " \n  5\nTable A 12.1 Economic Analysis Sewerage Improvement  2\n \nEIRR's Sensitivity Analysis  Delay in  Decrease  Decrease \nSensitivity Indicator  Switching Value  A\nTown  BasEeIR CRa se 10% increase  D1e0c%. i n  +10-%10 i%n  cinos ts  Benefits  in WTP  in 20%  ppen\nin cost  revenues  revenues  1 year  -20%  of HH served  SI  SI  SI  SW  SW  SW  d\n1 2 3 1 2 3 ix\nBahawalpur  19.6  17.6  17.4  15.7  16.4  15.4  17.4  1.8  2.8  2.7  55.0  35.5  36.7   1\n2\n \nKhaipur Tamewali  16.5  14.8  14.6  13.1  14.0  13.5  15.0  3.2  4.2  3.3  31.3  23.9  30.2 \nYazman  35.5  32.1  31.7  28.7  27.4  30.2  32.5  0.6  1.6  1.1  180.4  64.3  94.6 \nDera Ghazi Khan  16.5  14.5  14.3  12.6  13.7  12.4  13.9  3.8  4.8  3.7  26.6  21.0  27.3 \nTaunsa Sharif  22.9  20.6  20.4  18.4  18.8  18.9  20.0  1.3  2.3  1.4  77.9  43.8  69.4 \nJahanian  13.0  11.6  11.4  10.1  11.2  11.2  12.0  14.5  15.5  7.2  6.9  6.5  13.9 \nKabirwala  22.6  20.5  20.3  18.4  18.8  19.7  21.0  1.2  2.2  1.1  80.5  44.6  90.1 \nKhanewal  13.8  12.2  12.0  10.5  11.7  10.6  12.0  8.9  9.9  7.0  11.2  10.1  14.2 \nMian Channu  20.5  18.3  18.1  16.1  16.9  16.4  18.0  1.8  2.8  1.9  55.1  35.5  52.4 \nQadirpur Ran  16.9  15.1  14.9  13.2  14.2  14.1  15.0  3.2  4.2  2.3  31.4  23.9  43.6 \nShujabad  21.9  20.1  19.9  18.4  18.1  19.1  20.0  0.9  1.9  1.2  106.8  51.7  83.6 \nJalalpur Pirwala  14.1  12.6  12.4  11.0  12.1  11.9  13.0  7.0  8.0  4.2  14.3  12.5  23.6 \nAlipur  21.1  19.0  18.7  16.8  17.4  18.5  20.0  1.6  2.6  1.1  61.0  37.9  88.7 \nJatoi  18.8  16.9  16.7  14.9  15.8  16.5  18.0  2.2  3.2  1.3  46.3  31.6  74.8 \nKot Addu  15.3  13.7  13.5  12.0  13.0  11.9  13.0  4.5  5.5  4.2  22.4  18.3  24.0 \nJampur  28.2  25.2  24.9  22.3  22.2  23.6  26.0  0.9  1.9  1.1  107.5  51.8  94.9 \nRajanpur  24.5  22.1  21.8  19.7  20.0  21.1  22.0  1.1  2.1  1.4  88.4  46.9  74.0 \nRohjan  15.3  13.7  13.5  12.0  13.1  13.9  15.0  4.5  5.5  1.7  22.4  18.3  57.6 \nMultan  31.7  28.6  28.3  25.6  24.9  20.8  26.0  0.7  1.7  2.2  138.7  58.1  44.8 \nOverall  37.6  33.4  33.0  29.4  26.5  32.0  32.0  0.6  1.6  0.6  168.7  62.8  164.4 \nEIRR = Economic Internal rate of Return, HH = Household, WTP = Willingness-to-pay  \nNote: SI - on 10% increase in cost; SI - on 10% decrease in revenues; SW - on 10% increase in cost; SW - on 10% decrease in revenues \n1 2 1 2\nSource: ADB. 2001.

The financial analysis of the revenue-generating subprojects in the Southern Punjab Basic \nUrban Services Project (Project) were undertaken in accordance with the following Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  guidelines:  (i)  Framework  for  the  Economic  and  Financial  Appraisal  of  Urban \nDevelopment Sector Projects, (ii) Guidelines for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Analysis \nof Projects, (iii) Guidelines  for the Financial Governance and  Management of Investment  Projects  \nFinanced by the  Asian Development Bank (2001), .and (iii) Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of \nWater Supply Projects.  \n2.  For  financial  analysis,  financial  internal  rates  of  return  (FIRRs)  were  calculated  for  41 \nsubprojects for solid waste management, water supply, and slaughterhouses; and for incremental land \ndevelopment in 21 project towns. To assess the Project\u2019s sustainability, the overall performance of the \noperating enterprise\u2014the tehsil municipal administrations (TMAs) in all cities and the Multan Water \nand Sanitation Authority\u2014were also reviewed. Projected income and expenditure statements and cash \nflows were prepared with \u201cwithout Project\u201d and \u201cwith Project\u201d scenarios. FIRRs were calculated over a \n25 years period. Residual value has been assumed in the last year and FIRRs computed on after tax \nbasis.  \n1.  Financial Internal Rates of Returns \n3.  The FIRRs were calculated for solid waste management subprojects in 21 cities, water supply \nsubprojects in 6 cities, slaughterhouse subprojects in 12 cities, and, incremental land development at \nMian Channu. These were compared with the WACC (weighted average cost of capital) of 5%.1 The \nfinancial viabilities of the proposed subprojects were assessed from the perspective of operating \nentities, rather than the economy as a whole.  \n4.  All subproject revenues and costs are in constant 2003 prices and on an incremental basis. \nInvestment  costs  are  derived  from  estimated  costs  less  interest  during  construction.  Revenue \nestimates are based on user charges that consumers now pay, and their willingness to pay for \nimproved services based on socioeconomic survey results and community consultations. Survey \nresults indicated a low willingness to pay, relative to affordability levels, which reflect the beneficiaries\u2019 \nperception of the lack of capability of TMAs for effective service delivery. The collection efficiency of \nuser fees is assumed to be low during the initial years of project implementation, and will increase to \nabout  95%  with  improved  service  delivery.  But  that  is  mainly  due  to  implementation  of \nrecommendations made in the technical assistance (TA), especially a modern billing and collection \nsystem. Standard sensitivity tests were undertaken to assess the robustness of the FIRR calculation. \n2.  Solid Waste Management  \n5.  Estimates of capital costs for solid waste management subprojects are based on planned \ninvestments  for  equipment,  transport  vehicles,  land  for  landfills,  civil  works,  and  incinerators  for \nhospitals. Capital cost, operations and maintenance (O&M), and replacement costs are based on 2003 \nprices. Other assumptions are: (i) Salaries of incremental staff were included.2 (ii) Incremental O&M \nexpenses are 5% of the component cost (excluding land), while diesel and O&M of vehicles are \nassumed to be 15% of the vehicle cost. (iii) Incinerator expenditure is at 30% of its cost. (iv) Additional \nvehicles will be procured during the second and fifth years of the implementation period. (v) Vehicles \nwill be replaced every 10 years.  (vii) The residual value of vehicles, based on remaining life at the end \nof the implementation period, will be treated as cash inflow. \n6.  Average user charges per household (based on survey results for willingness to pay) were \nestimated at PRs15 per month and have been increased by 10% per annum until 2009\u20132010. After \n                                                 \n1 The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is 5%, based on funding arrangements and respective weights. \n2 Staff include those working on collection and disposal of solid wastes, such as those working with tractors with bucket \nloaders at landfills, or with tractors for container carriers and transfer trailers. Staff include drivers and sanitary workers at \nsites such as landfills, transfer stations, and container carriers. \n ", "            Appendix 13  57\nthat date, a nominal 3% increase per annum is assumed to cover O&M expenditures for the subproject \non  solid  waste  management.  The  rates  are  within  the  affordability  and  willingness  to  pay  of \nhouseholds, which is about PRs15 to PRs50 per household monthly. Population projections are based \non the 1998 census. Household size ranges from 6.3 persons in Qadirpur to 8.4 persons in Jatoi. \nCollection efficiency of user charges is set at 80% of households in the first 3 years of project \nimplementation, then increases to 95% in succeeding years.  \n7.  Standard sensitivity tests were used to assess the robustness of the FIRR calculations. Table \nA13.1 shows results of FIRR calculation and sensitivity analysis for each town. \n8.  Financial projections using the cost and revenue assumptions indicate that operation of the \nsolid  waste  management  subproject  in  each  town  is  financially  viable.  Specifically,  cash  flows \ngenerated by the Project are sufficient to meet all operating cost requirements. Full cost recovery is \nachieved, with resulting FIRRs higher than WACC, or 5% rate of return. The FIRRs of solid waste \nmanagement subprojects on base cost ranges from 11% at Taunsa Sharif to 55% at Jahanian. The \nincremental costs of the sub-project will be quite low as compared to the incremental revenues which \nresult in these comparatively high FIRRs.Sensitivity results indicate that the FIRR is sensitive to 10% \ndecrease in revenues and to the cumulative effect of lower revenues and increased costs under the \nworst-case scenario. \n3.  Water Supply \n9.  Water supply subprojects comprise: water source development (tubewells and pumps), water \ntransportation and communal water points (at Rohjan), transmission mains and distribution systems, \nand storage. To recover costs of the water supply facilities and services, monthly user tariffs, based on \nflat fees per household and commercial customer, are applied, and connection charges are levied on \nnew  connections.  The  setting  of  water  tariffs  took  affordability  into  account,  and  assumed  that \noperating entities such as the Water and Sanitation Authority (WASA) in Multan and TMAs in the \nproject towns may maintain positive cash flows from operations over the forecast period and thus, may \nadhere to full cost recovery.3  \n10.  Water fees are assumed to increase by 5% per annum to cover water supply expenses such as \ninflation, O&M, equipment and building depreciation, and replacement of equipment. In Multan, water \nrates will be revised in 2004-2005, then again in 2010\u20132011 for an overall increase of about 45%. \nIncreases will be about 5% per annum afterward. O&M costs include expenditures for salaries, power, \nchemicals,  spare  parts,  and  miscellaneous  expenses.  Only  incremental  revenues  and  O&M \nexpenditures were included in calculating the FIRRs. \n11.  The rate of return for the water supply project was assumed to be 5%\u2014equal to WACC. All \nsubprojects are financially viable, based on cost and revenue assumptions. Full cost recovery is \nachieved with resulting FIRRs above WACC for all the towns.4 FIRR base cases range [???] from 6% \nat Bahawalpur to 33% at Jalalpur Pirwala. Table A13.2 shows results of FIRR calculations and \nsensitivity analysis for each town.  \n                                                 \n3 The average water fee used in these calculations was Rs40 per household connection in Taunsa, Rs75 in Jalalpur Pirwala, \nand Rs100 in Bahawalpur, Hasilpur, and D.G. Khan. These amounts are within the willingness to pay of Rs120 to Rs150 \nper household monthly, and within the affordability levels of low-income households, at 3% to 5% of their monthly income.40 \nMultan has an elaborate water tariff system, with house connections rates of Rs36 to Rs250 per month (depending on lot \nsize); commercial rates from Rs182 to Rs525 per month, depending on pipe [size; and industrial water rates from Rs500 to \nRs12,000 per month, depending on consumption. The potential populations to be served in the project towns are \nestimated, in 2003, as 1,390,000 people in Multan, 41,383 people in Jalalpur, 48,235 in Taunsa, 228,983 in D.G. Khan, \n89,847 in Hasilpur, and 481,749 Bahawalpur. Consumption averages 120 liters per capita daily. \n4 Neither the FIRR nor a sensitivity analysis was calculated for Rohjan because the entire water supply project is for supply by \nwater tanker to central points, where citizens can collect drinking water. No additional house connections are envisaged. \nThe citizens welcome the provision of potable water. Many other positive externalities and socioeconomic benefits have \nbeen considered in the Economic Analysis of the Project. \n ", "58   Appendix 13 \n4.  Slaughterhouses5 \n12.   Estimates of capital costs for slaughterhouse subprojects are based on planned investments \nfor civil works and land for new slaughterhouses, or for rehabilitation of others. Capital costs, O&M, \nand replacement costs are based on 2003 prices. Other assumptions include:  \n(i)  The off-take of large and small animals, and per-capita meat consumption (mutton and \nbeef), were taken from the World Bank Livestock Sector study,6 although figures are far \nlower than those of the Economic Survey of Pakistan.  \n(ii)  Part-time salaries for veterinary officers and incremental staff have been added.  \n(iii)  Slaughter fee range from PRs10 for small animal to PRs20 for large animals.7 \n(iv)  Annual increases in slaughter fees will be 5% from FY2004\u20132005 to FY 2009\u20132010, then \n3% afterward, in line with inflation. \n(v)  The collection efficiency of slaughter fees will be100% after project implementation.  \n13.  All subprojects are considered financially viable, based on cost and revenue assumptions. \nComputed net revenues and the FIRR for the base case compare favorably with the WACC. The FIRR \nbase case ranges from 5% at Qadirpur Rawan to 30% at Jampur. Table A13.3 shows the sensitivity \nscenarios and the FIRR under various scenarios.8 \n5.  Incremental Land Development \n14.  This component is being implemented at Mian Channu. The FIRR calculation took into account \nthe net cash flows in real after tax terms. The FIRR is 7%, which is higher than the WACC. But a lower \nreturn is justified, because this basically aims at providing incrementally developed plots at cost plus \nservice charges. The experience of SKAA was used in working out income and expenditure patterns. \nDevelopment expenditures for residential plots are subsidized by slightly higher service charges for \ncommercial plots.  \n15.  For sensitivity analysis, scenarios considered included (I) an increased capital cost of 5% (the \ncomponent\u2019s main cost is land, which will be provided by the TMAs, and the latest land prices were \nconsidered in Project costs); (ii) a 10% decrease in revenues; and, (iii) a cumulative effect of 5% \nincreased capital costs and 10% decreased revenues. The FIRR is sensitive to decrease in revenue, \nand reduces to 3%, or lower than WACC. The total investment in this subproject is less than 0.15% of \nthe total project cost. In addition to the socioeconomic benefits, the subproject will serve as a pilot for \nincremental urban development for low-income communities. \nB.  Financial Projections for the TMAs \n16.  In addition to financial analysis of subprojects, the financial sustainability of the TMAs was \nassessed. Budgets, actual revenues, and expenditure accounts, as well as taxation schedules of the \nTMAs and WASA Multan, were reviewed.9 Most TMA income is based on intergovernmental transfers \nthat are projected based on existing awards by the Provincial Finance Commission. Projections of \nTMA revenue and expenditures, with and without the proposed projects, have been undertaken, based \non assumptions that proposed expenditures for the proposed interventions have included: (i) the urban \nimmovable property tax obtained from the Punjab government\u2019s excise and taxation staff at the district \n                                                 \n5 Sensitivity analysis shows that the FIRR of the water supply component in Multan is sensitive to a 10% decrease in \nrevenues, or a 10% increase in O&M expenditure, and is lower than the WACC. The FIRR is indeed more sensitive to the \ncumulative effect of two variables at a time, as in d and f. The FIRR at Bahawalpur is lower than WACC in scenario g. \n6 Consumption of 7.0 kg of beef, and 4.5 kg of mutton, per person yearly. \n7 Assumes 1 large animal to be 150 kg, and a small animal to be 16 kg. \n8 It is apparent from the sensitivity analysis that the FIRR of the slaughterhouse component at Yazman is sensitive to 10% \ndecrease in revenue, and that of Qadirpur Rawan is sensitive to a 10% increase in O&M expenditure and to a 1-year delay \nin receipt of project benefits. The FIRR is lower than WACC in these cases. The FIRR is, indeed, more sensitive to the \ncumulative effect of two simultaneous [variables as in d and f. \n9 Meetings were held with: the tehsil officer (finance) and the tehsil officer (regulations), who are responsible for taxation, of \ntowns being reviewed; the chief officer, who is responsible for O&M of municipal services; and, tax inspectors, rent \ninspectors, and licensing inspectors. Information was obtained from PG for property taxes (collection, deductions, and \ndisbursement to TMAs); and on district excise and taxation officers (responsible for levy and collection of property taxes, \nwhich will be TMA\u2019s main revenue source in the future. \n ", "            Appendix 13  59\nand provincial finance levels; (ii) the tax on transfer of immovable properties (TOTP), with actual \nrevenue collection as the base for TOTP100, (iii) intergovernmental transfers;11 and (iv) expenditures \nunder the \u201cwith project\u201d cash flow projections, incremental salaries, and O&M expenditures (including \nfor repairs and utilities). Cash flow projections show that the TMAs will have sufficient cash to meet all \nexpenditures. \n17.  The  financial  performance  of  TMAs  is  expected  to  improve  as  a  result  of  the  Project\u2019s \ninstitutional development and capacity building components. Recommendations to improve revenue \ncollection from user charges include (i) surveys to locate illegal connections, (ii) regularization of illegal \nconnections, (iii) creation and updating of consumer databases, (iv) improvements in billing and \ncollection, (v) improvements in recovery of arrears, (vii) calculation of unit costs of service provision, \n(viii) display of unit costs to improve transparency, and (ix) improvement in budgeting, records, and \nmonitoring of O&M expenditures, to reduce costs and wastage. \nTable A13.1 Results of Financial Analysis \nSolid Waste Management Subprojects in Project Towns \n    Sensitivity Analysis \n  FIRR \nIncrease  Decrease in  Increase in base  Increase in  Decrease in  Delay of one year \nTown    in Project  Revenues  cost and  O&M  revenues and  in project \nOn Base  Cost by  by 10%  decrease in  Expenditure  increase in O&M  benefits \nCost  10%  revenues by 10%  by 10%  by 10% \n  A  B  C  D = B and C  E  F = C and E  G \nBahawalpur  30  27  24  22  27  22  24 \nHasilpur  26  24  23  21  25  22  23 \nKhairpur  15  14  12  11  13  10  13 \nTamewali \nYazman  18  16  15  14  17  14  16 \nAhmadpur East  30  27  22  20  26  18  24 \nMian Channu  23  21  19  17  22  17  20 \nKhanewal  25  23  21  20  23  19  19 \nKabirwala  19  17  16  14  17  14  16 \nJahanian  55  44  37  31  48  31  46 \nQadirpur Ran  48  44  42  39  47  41  34 \nShujabad  30  26  22  19  26  18  24 \nJalalpur Pirwala  37  33  29  26  34  26  30 \nKot Addu  36  32  28  25  32  24  28 \nAlipur  27  23  17  15  21  12  20 \nJatoi  35  31  27  24  31  24  28 \nD G Khan  31  26  20  17  24  15  21 \nTaunsa  11  10  8  7  9  6  9 \nRajanpur  28  25  22  20  25  19  22 \nJampur  42  36  31  27  37  27  32 \nRojhan  32  29  24  22  26  19  25 \n Multan   13  11  8  6  10  4  9 \nSource: ADB. 2001.

The rates for levy of stamp and registration fees is fixed or revised by \ndistrict revenue authorities every 3 years. TOTP projections have been increased by 25% in the fifth year to give the effect \nof this increase in property value . (The actual increase is usually much higher than this 25%).  \n11 (i) All  grants for salary and nonsalary expenditures for staff of the decentralized departments will be used for TMA \noperations, and not for TMA headquarters in urban areas. But this separation of expenditures is not required by the Multan \nCity TMA, because this separation of expenditures was not required, as tehsil and city areas are, effectively, one \ngeographical area. (ii) Development grants received by TMA are allocated on a per-capita basis to populations of TMA \nheadquarters in urban areas . The actual 2002\u20132003 development grant that TMA received was taken as the base, with a \n10% yearly increase. (iii) The actual amount that TMAs received  as an Octroi Compensatory Grant  in 2002\u20132003 is \nconsidered the baseline, and a yearly increase of 10% is assumed. That share will continue to decrease, and may become \nnil after 5 years.  Instead of these three there may be one grant (share of the TMA in provincial revenues is decided by the \nPFC). But because the Octroi Compensatory Grant compensates for revenue source of the defunct ULC (which provides \ndirect income for the TMA urban area headquarters), it is shown separately in the financial projections.  \n ", "60   Appendix 13 \nTable A13.2 Results of Financial Analysis \nWater Supply Subprojects in Project Towns \n    Sensitivity Analysis \n  FIRR  Increase  Decrease in  Increase in base  Increase in  Decrease in  Delay of one year \nTown    in Project  Revenues  cost and  O&M  revenues and  in project \nOn Base \nCost by  by 10%  decrease in  Expenditure  increase in O&M  benefits \nCost  10%  revenues by 10%  by 10%  by 10% \n  A  B  C  D = B and C  E  F = C and E  G \nBahawalpur  6  5  5  4  5  4  4 \nHasilpur  18  17  16  15  17  15  15 \nJalalpur Pirwala  33  31  30  28  32  30  27 \nDGKhan  16  15  14  13  15  14  14 \nTaunsa  24  23  21  20  23  19  19 \nMultan  8  7  3  3  4  0  5 \nFIRR = financial internal rate of return, O&M = operation and maintenance. \n \nTable A13.3.
