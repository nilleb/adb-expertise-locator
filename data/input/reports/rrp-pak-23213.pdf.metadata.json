An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was \nundertaken. The summary IEE is a supplementary appendix.   \n \nThe  Project,  developed  under  the  overall  framework  of  the \nGovernment of Pakistan\u2019s poverty reduction strategy outlined in its \n10-Year  Perspective  Development  Plan  2001\u20132011, will improve \nthe living conditions and quality of life of low-income communities \nin  urban  settlements  in  southern  Punjab  province  where  (i) \ndrinking  water  is  scarce  or  unsafe,  (ii)  sewerage  systems  are \ninadequate or nonexistent and wastewater treatment facilities are \nabsent,  and  (iii)  collection  and  disposal  of  solid  wastes  is \ninadequate.  To  achieve  this  goal,  institutional  capacity  building \nand  revenue  improvement  will  first  be  provided  for  newly \nestablished  local  government  institutions,  focusing  on  greater \ndevolution  of  authority.  Then  a  number  of  capital  investments  in \nbasic  urban  services  will  be \ninvolving  all \nstakeholders.  The  Project  will  also  provide  overall  assistance  in \nimplementation. \n \n \nUrban  areas  in  Pakistan  are  growing  rapidly,  and  demand  for \nimproved  urban  services  is  increasing.  Current  deficiencies  in \nbasic \ninhibit  economic  growth,  and  severely \nconstrain  the  potential  for  urban  areas  to  play  a  more  significant \nrole  in  the  country\u2019s  economic  growth.  To  meet  the  growing \npressures and demands, urban development has usually occurred \nwith  little  or  no  environmental  controls,  and  with  forms  of \ngovernance  that  cannot  begin  to  meet  the  responsibilities.  High \nurban  growth,  combined  with  slow  urban  sector  development,  a \nlack  of  resources,  and  inadequate  institutional  capacity  of  newly \nestablished \nin \nlocal  government  agencies,  has \nuncontrolled urban sprawl; deteriorating urban environments; and \ndeficiencies  in  urban  services  including  water  supply,  sewerage \nroads,  and \nsystems,  drainage,  solid  waste  management, \ncommunity facilities.  The  resulting  deficiencies  particularly  affect \nthe urban poor and lead to a considerably reduced quality of life, \nincluding  poor  health  and  increased  poverty.  The  incidence  of \npoverty increased from 26.6% in fiscal year (FY) 1993 to 32.2% in \nFY1999.  The  number  of  poor  increased  by  12  million  over  that \nperiod. The  southern  Punjab  region  has  the  highest  incidence  of \nurban poverty in Pakistan.  The Government\u2019s strategy for poverty \nreduction  envisages  a  multipronged  approach  of  reviving  growth, \nimproving  governance,  reorienting  public  expenditures  toward \npoverty-reducing programs, and revamping the safety net system. \n\ninfrastructure \n\nresulted \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nObjectives \n\nThe  Government  is  implementing  comprehensive  governance \nreforms, with particular emphasis on enhancing the effectiveness \nof  basic  social  services  through  its  program  for  devolution  of \npowers.  The  Project  is  formulated  to  support  the  Government\u2019s \npoverty  reduction  initiatives,  as  well  as  the  devolution  of  power \nand  responsibility  to  local  governments  for  the  provision  and \nfinancing  of  urban  infrastructure  and  municipal  services.  The \nProject  incorporates  several  strategic  features  and  incentives, \nincluding  (i)  promoting  policy  reform  in  accordance  with  the \nPunjab  Local  Government  Ordinance  2001  (PLGO2001),  and \nfinancial  management  and  resource  generation  at  the  local \ngovernment  level,  with  adoption  of  cost-recovery  principles  and \nphased  elimination  of  subsidies;  (ii)  prioritizing  investments  that \nmeet  the  basic  needs  of  urban  communities;  (iii)  ensuring  local \ncommunity participation and ownership; and (iv) promoting equity \nparticipation  by  local  governments  in  the  investment  packages. \nThe  Project  also  supports  initiatives  to  foster  participation  of  civil \nsociety,  the  private  sector,  and  nongovernment  organizations \n(NGOs);  formulate  a  gender  strategy;  and  develop  sustainable \nplans for capacity building. \n\nintends \n\nto  (i)  reduce  urban  poverty, \n\nThe  Project \nimprove \ncommunity  health,  and  reduce  environmental  degradation  in  21 \nproject  towns  by  improving  the  water  supply,  sanitation,  solid \nwaste management, and roads  for  low-income communities; and \n(ii)  ensure  sustainability  of  urban  investments  by  strengthening \ninstitutional capacities of newly devolved local municipal agencies. \nThe  Project  is  expected  to  improve  the  living  conditions  and \nquality  of  life  of  about  3.6  million  urban  people,  mostly  in  low-\nincome communities.  \n\nThe Project will comprise the following main components:  \n     A.  development  of  infrastructure  for  basic  urban  services, \nincluding community development and participation; and  \n      B.  institutional  development,  including  the  development  of \nmunicipal  management  systems  for  local  government  agencies, \nsupport of project implementation, and incremental administration \nsupport.   \n\nUnder component A, the Project will improve infrastructure in the \nfollowing subsectors: (i) water supply, (ii) sewerage systems and \nwastewater treatment, (iii) solid waste management, (iv) road links \nfor  low-income  areas,  (v) slaughterhouses, and  (vi) incremental \nland  development  for  the  poor.  This  component  will  also  include \ncommunity  development  and  participation,  aiming  to  ensure \nsustainability  of  investments  and  to  develop  organizational  and \nhuman  capacity  in  local  government  agencies  for  participatory \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nhuman  capacity  in  local  government  agencies  for  participatory \nprocesses targeted to reduce poverty and provide basic needs. \n \nUnder  component  B,  municipal  staff  of  the  tehsil  municipal \nadministrations  (TMAs)  will  be  trained  in  institutional  capacity \nbuilding and revenue improvement.  \n \nThe Punjab government (PG) and the TMAs have agreed to take \nnecessary  fundamental  steps  to  (i)  increase  the  TMAs'  revenue \nbase  in  a  sustainable  manner,  and  (ii)  enhance  and  stabilize  the \nTMAs\u2019 \ninstitutional  capacity  and  organizational  setup.  This \ninvolves making adjustments to fully align the TMAs\u2019 organization \nand institutional structure in accordance with  the requirements of \nfinancial  management. \nPLGO2001,  and \nBecause  the  Project\u2019s  sustainability  depends  on  these  reforms \nand  adjustment  measures,  the  TMAs  and  PG  have  agreed  that \naction  on  them  be  a  prerequisite  for  the  TMAs\u2019  entry  into  the \nProject.  Considering  that  TMA  commitment  alone  will  not  be  a \nsufficient  basis  for  a  successful  and  sustainable  investment \nprogram, PG has agreed to take pending policy actions to support \nthe TMAs in accordance with PLGO2001.  \n\nimproving  overall \n\nThe  estimated  project  cost \nis  $128.6  million  equivalent, \ncomprising  foreign  exchange  costs  of  $18.2  million  (14%)  and \nlocal currency costs equivalent to $110.4 million (86%). \n \n\n \n\n \n\nSource \n\nADB \n\nGovernment \n\nProject Towns/ \nCommunities \n\nFinancing \n($ million) \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\nTotal \n\n18.2 \n\n0.0 \n\n71.8 \n\n28.3 \n\n90.0 \n\n28.3 \n\n0.0 \n\n10.3 \n\n10.3 \n\n \n\n% \n\n70 \n\n22 \n\n8 \n\nTotal \n\n \nADB = Asian Development Bank \n\n18.2 \n\n110.4 \n\n128.6 \n\n100 \n\nIt  is  proposed  that  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provide \ntwo  loans.

The \nforeign  exchange  risk  will,  however,  be  borne  by  PG,  which  will \nmake  the  loan  proceeds  available  to  TMAs  through  the  Local \nGovernment  and  Rural  Development  Department  (LGRD)  under \nthe  Provincial  Finance  Commission  (PFC)  as  a  special  grant. \nFunds  to  TMAs  will  be  allocated  on  the  basis  of  a  TMA-specific \ninvestment  plan,  prepared  during  project  preparation,  and  will  be \nreleased  subject  to  their  meeting  the  eligibility  and  the  project-\nspecific criteria, agreed with PG. \n \nUntil 31 July 2009. \n \n31 January 2009 \n\n \nLGRD of PG \n \nThe  Executing  Agency  (EA)  will  establish  a  project  coordination \noffice (PCO) at its Directorate General of  Katchi Abadi and Urban \nImprovement.  The  PCO,  comprising  professional  staff  with  the \nsupport  of  a  team  of  consultants,  will  assist  TMAs  in  providing \npolicy guidance; will undertake their institutional strengthening; will \nsupport monitoring and evaluation; and will provide TMA guidance \nin  project  implem enting.  Each  TMA  will  establish  a  project  unit \n(PU)  to  execute  the  infrastructure  development  component.  Four \ntechnical support teams of consultants will help the PUs prepare \ndetailed  designs,  and  procurement  for  the  urban  development \ncomponents. \n \nAll  ADB-financed  procurement  for  the  Project  will  follow  ADB's \nGuidelines for Procurement. Contracts for civil works estimated to \ncost  more  than  $1  million  equivalent  will  be  carried  out  using \ninternational  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedures  while  those \nestimated to cost $1 million equivalent or less will be carried out \nunder \n(LCB)  procedures.  Minor \ndevelopment  works  and  maintenance  may  be  carried  out  on  a \nforce account basis.  \n\nlocal  competitive  bidding \n\nThe  procurement  of  goods  will  preferably  be  grouped  into \npackages larger than $500,000, to be suitable for ICB procedures.  \nMiscellaneous  minor  goods  that  cannot  be  grouped  into  larger \ncontracts,  and  are  estimated  to  cost  less  than  $500,000  per \ncontract,  will  be  procured  through  international  shopping  (IS) \nprocedures. Minor items estimated to cost less than the equivalent \nof  $50,000  per  contract  may  be  purchased  directly,  following \nproper procedures to ensure economy, efficiency, and quality. \n\n\fRisks and Assumptions  Major risks associated with the Project include  \n\n           (i)     Acquisition of the required land may be delayed or not          \n\n \n\nvii \n\nAn  input  of  1,830  person-months  of  consulting  is  planned, \nconsisting  of  32  person-months  of  international  consulting  and \n1,798  person-months  of  domestic  consulting.  The  selection  and \nengagement  of  all  consulting  services  to  be  financed  under  the \nProject  will  be  in  accordance  with  the  Quality  and  Cost  Based \nSelection  (QCBS)  method  of  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants by the Asian Development Bank and its Borrowers, or \nother  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of \ndomestic consultants.  \n\nimproving \n\nThe  Project  will  improve  the  living  conditions  of  about  3.6  million \nresidents in 21 urban centers by enhancing the quality of life and \nhealth, \nthe  environment,  and  creating  conditions \nconducive to sustained urban development and economic growth. \nThe Project will help reduce mortality, morbidity, and poverty, and \nthe loss of amenity associated with environmental degradation in \nurban  centers,  especially  among  slum  inhabitants  and  poor \ngroups,  and  particularly  women  and  children.

Current  deficiencies  in  basic  infrastructure  inhibit  economic  growth,  and  severely \nconstrain the potential for urban areas to play a more significant role in the country\u2019s economic \ngrowth.  To  meet  the  growing  pressures  and  demands,  urban  development  has  usually  been \nwith few or no environmental controls, and with forms of governance that  cannot begin to meet \nresponsibilities. High urban growth, combined with slow urban sector development, has resulted \nin  uncontrolled  urban  sprawl;  deteriorating  urban  environments;  and  deficiencies  in  urban \nservices such as  water supply, sewerage systems, drainage, solid waste management, roads, \nand community facilities. The deficiencies have particularly affected the urban poor and caused \na considerably lower quality of life, including poor health and increased poverty. The incidence \nof poverty increased from 26.6% in fiscal year (FY) 1993 to 32.2% in FY1999. The number of \npoor increased by 12 million during that period.  \n\nThe poverty reduction strategy of the Government of Pakistan1 (Government) envisages \n3. \na  multipronged  strategy  of  reviving  growth, \nimproving  governance,  reorienting  public \nexpenditures  toward  poverty-reducing  programs,  and  revamping  the  safety  net  system.  The \nGovernment  is  committed  to  increasing  pro-poor  budgetary  expenditures  by  0.2%  of  gross \ndomestic product (GDP) annually, to  4% of GDP in FY2004.2 The Government is implementing \ncomprehensive governance reforms, with particular emphasis on enhancing the effectiveness of \nbasic social services through its Punjab Local Government Ordinance, 2001 (PLGO2001).  The \nPG\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy3  also  emphasizes  the  need  to  implement  broad-based \ngovernance  reforms  and  improve  social  services  to  address poverty.  To achieve the goals for \npoverty reduction, the Government has requested assistance from the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) in developing the economic potential of low-income urban centers in southern Punjab by \nimproving  the  existing  infrastructure,  and  developing  better  institutional  capacity  of  local \ngovernments.  The  Loan  Fact-Finding  Mission was  undertaken  08\u201325  July  2003.  This  report is \nbased on the consultant\u2019s reports prepared during an ADB-financed technical assistance (TA),4\n \nand  the  mission\u2019s  understandings  with  both  the  federal  and  provincial  governments,  and  with \nelected  town  officials  and  community  groups.  Linkages  among  the  project  objectives,  inputs, \nand outputs are shown in the project framework in Appendix 1, and in the chronology of loan-\nprocessing activities in Supplementary Appendix A. \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n4.  \nPunjab is Pakistan\u2019s largest province, with a population of about 84 million, or about 56% \nof  the  country\u2019s  total  population  of  149  million.  Punjab  has  an  urban  population  growth  rate  of \nabout  4%  yearly;  the  national  average  is  about  3.5%.  The  per-capita gross domestic product \n(GDP)  for  Pakistan  was  estimated  at  $4165  in  2002,  with  variations  among  provinces.

Islamabad. \n\n\f2 \n\naverage monthly household income of $85 is fairly constant across Pakistan; that is almost the \nequivalent of four wage earners per household. The urban population accounts for about 35% of \nthe  total  population.  High  urban  population  growth  is  expected  to  continue  in  the  foreseeable \nfuture, considering the relatively high birth rate, migration from rural areas for employment, and \nindustrial and commercial growth in urban areas.  By 2020, the urban population is expected to \ncomprise 50% of the total population. The latest United Nations Development Programme report \nshows  that  Pakistan\u2019s  Human  Development  Index  rank  has  dropped  to  144  among  175 \ncountries, and is lower than other countries in South Asia, including Bangladesh, India, and Sri \nLanka.  In  line  with  the  national  trends,  indicators  of  social  sector  achievement  in  Punjab  have \nnot  improved  much  in  the  1990s.  A  significant  and  sustained  effort  will  be  required  for  social \nsector  development  in  Punjab,  considering  that  the  literacy  rate  is  46%  (36%  for  women),  the \ninfant mortality rate is 95 per 1,000 live births, the immunization rate for children of ages 1 to 5 \nis 60%, and the contraceptive rate is only 20% in rural areas.  \n\nWith  Pakistan\u2019s  high  urban  growth,  many  slum  areas  have  developed  in  the  urban \n5. \ncenters. Punjab province is no exception. The urban population is about 25 million, and some \n7.5  million,  or  35.0%  of  the  total  urban  population,  live  in  slums,  with  another  2.8  million,  or \n11.5%  of  the  urban  population,  living  in  katchi  abadis..6\n  Poverty7  in  Punjab,  as  elsewhere  in \nPakistan, is increasing. It rose from 25% in FY1993 to 33% in FY1999. Recent data suggests \nthat  poverty  increased  further,  both  in  rural  and  urban  areas,  from  FY1999  to  2001.  Poverty \nvaries significantly within the province, with the highest level in southern Punjab. \n\nLevels of urban services in Punjab\u2019s urban centers are low, with coverage and service \n6.  \nvarying  greatly  among  towns.  Although  most  towns  have  water  supply  systems,  only  40%  of \nhouseholds are connected to them. Service is limited, water quality is poor, and system losses \noften  exceed  45%.  Service  levels  in  the  sanitation  sector  are  also  low.  Although  many  urban \ncenters have piped sewerage systems, most are old, with extremely poor maintenance, limited \ncoverage,  and  with  sewage  left  untreated.  Many  households  have  individual  sewage  disposal \nsystems, consisting mostly of pit latrines and, to a lesser extent, septic tanks whose overflows \nare discharged into open canals and drainage networks, and infiltrate into groundwater aquifers. \nDrainage systems in the towns depend on open canals that serve as both drainage and sewage \ncollection points. Most urban centers have limited solid waste collection systems, but only about \n30%  of  the  waste  is  collected  and  adequately  disposed.  Most  waste,  including  that  from \nhospitals,  is  disposed  in  open  fields  and  unsanitary  dump  sites.  The  urban  road  networks  are \nreasonably  extensive,  but  road  conditions  are  extremely  poor,  with  inadequate  maintenance. \nThe  existing  standards  and  provision  of  infrastructure  in  the  urban  centers  are  generally \ninsufficient to support sustained human development and economic growth. \n \nTo address the urban problems and institutional shortcomings, particularly in delivery of \n7. \nbasic  services  and  facilities  to  the  general  public,  the  Government  has  initiated  a  program  to \ndevolve  power  and  responsibility,  based  on  a  bottom-up  methodology  that  is  people-centered \nand oriented to customer services. The devolution program, implemented on 14 August 2000, is \nbased  on  five  fundamentals:  devolution  of  political  power,  decentralization  of  administrative \nauthority, deconcentration of management functions, diffusion of the power authority nexus, and \ndistribution  of  resources  to  the  district  level.  More  transparent,  predictable,  and  equitable \ntransfers are being established for fiscal transfers and grants from the provincial government to \nthe  district  and  tehsil  governments.  Local  governments  are  being  encouraged  to  generate \nfinancial resources from their own constituencies. \n \n\n                                                 \n6 A katchi abadi is an unauthorized settlement on state-owned land of more than 40 dwellings, as defined in March \n1985, without land rights and without physical and social infrastructure services and facilities.  \n7  The  official  poverty  line  was  defined  as  PRs670/person  per  month  in  1998-1999. It rose to PRs748 per month in \n2000-2001, and was estimated as PRs774 per month in 2002. \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\n8. \nThe  Local  Government  and  Rural  Development  Department  (LGRD)  is  responsible  for \nsupport  to  the  districts  and  tehsils,  or  subdistricts,  in  planning,  finance,  and  infrastructure \ndevelopment.  The  Planning  and  Development  Board  is  central  to  all  planning  at  the  provincial \nlevel. It holds overall responsibility for planning and development of all sectors in the province, \nincluding  policy  and  procedures.  Delivery  of  major  municipal  infrastructure  falls  under  the \nresponsibility  of  tehsil  municipal  administrations  (TMAs)  at  the  subdistrict  level,  mandated  to \nplan and construct water and sewerage works and to manage solid wastes. Some responsibility \nrests  with  the  lowest  level  of  local  government,  the  union  councils  (UCs),  which  are  charged \nwith community development and related tasks; and with the district governments, which handle \nall affairs related to government land as well as the health, education, and social affairs sectors. \nThe Office of Katchi Abadis and Urban Improvement (KAUI), under LGRD, oversees programs \nfor  the  upgrading  of  slums  and  urban  improvement.  Grant  allocations  from  the  federal \ngovernment, using revenues from general sales taxes, are the local governments\u2019 main revenue \nsource, amounting to 30% to 50% of urban centers\u2019 revenue. The rest of the local governments\u2019 \nrevenue is from water charges, immovable property taxes, and a range of other charges, taxes, \nand  rentals.  Weak  institutional  capacity  and  low  willingness  of  the  general  public  to  pay  for \nservices has limited the mobilization of resources by the local governments. Appendix 2 gives \nthe Pakistan urban sector analysis. \n \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n Key constraints to the effective delivery of urban services include a lack of stakeholder \n9. \nparticipation  in  the  planning,  design  and  implementation  of  development  projects;  low \ninvestment levels; inefficiency of public institutions; a lack of accountability; and limited resource \nmobilization  by  local  governments.  Participatory  planning  with  stakeholders,  institutional \nstrengthening of TMAs, improvements in environmental infrastructure in selected urban towns, \nand emphasizing the provision of basic urban services in low-income and economically deprived \ncommunities  will  help  slow  environmental  degradation;  help  improve  the  health  of  urban \nresidents, especially the poor; and provide the basis for sustainable economic growth.  \n\nThe  Government\u2019s  policy  of  decentralization  and  devolution  is  critical  to  developing \n10. \ngreater local responsibility. Efficient and cost-effective community services cannot be provided \nuntil  accountability  and  management  are  improved  at  the  local  level.  The  mobilization  of  local \nresources and improved management of existing infrastructure and services are necessary to \nachieve these objectives. The Government has agreed to support these objectives, through the \nProject,  by  (i)  strengthening  the  managerial,  financial,  and  technical  capacity  of  the  TMAs  by \ngiving  them  more  responsibility,  and  upgrading  their  staffs\u2019  capacities;  (ii)  providing  adequate \nstaff,  equipment,  and  procedures  to  enable  the  TMAs  to  increase  resource  mobilization, \nimplement and sustain subprojects successfully, and improve the management and delivery of \nexisting urban infrastructure and services; and (iii) providing a training program to increase the \ntechnical  proficiency  of  TMAs  and  provincial  staff.  The  Government  has  committed  itself  to \ngreater  continuity  in  the  appointment  of  key  professional  and  administrative  staff  in  local \ncouncils. \n\n11. \nThe  PLGO2001  has  provided  the  legal  framework  for  enhanced  responsibility  of  local \nauthorities,  but  much  more  work  remains  before  there  will  be  self-reliant  TMAs  with  sufficient \nprofessional  management  and  a  sufficient  resource  base  to  provide  more  than  marginally \nimproved  basic  urban  services.  The  Project\u2019s  sustained  success  depends  on  this  and  a  policy \nframework that focuses more on needs of the poor, on sound service management, and on cost \nrecovery.  These  can  be  supported  through  linkages  with  the  ADB-assisted Devolution Support \nProgram (DSP).8 For this, the Project will develop functional linkages with DSP\u2019s annual planning \nmechanisms for technical assistance.  \n                                                 \n8 ADB. 2002.  Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directos in the Proposed Loans to the \nIslamic Republic of Pakistan for Decentralization Support Program . Manila (Loans 1935-, 1936-, 1937-, and 1938-\nPAK, for $30 million). \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n12. \nThe Government is concerned about the low levels of social services and believes that \ngreater  investment  will  accelerate  productivity  gains,  reduce  poverty,  and  promote  smaller, \nhealthier, and better-educated families. Pakistan\u2019s national urban and housing policy is reflected \nin  the  Ten  Year  Perspective  Development  Plan  (PDP)  2001\u20132011, which describes the main \nurban  problems  as  (i) environmental  degradation,  including  the  mushrooming  of  katchi \nabadis and breakdown of infrastructure and municipal services; (ii) a lack of vision, inadequate \ninstitutional  setups,  and  weak  financial  bases;  (iii) a  backlog  of  2 million  housing  units,  apart \nfrom the 2.3 million units that are structurally obsolete; and (iv) a lack of financial institutions to \nprovide affordable loans for house construction. The plan envisages the following strategies for \nurban  development:  (i) strengthening  the  roles  of  local  bodies  in  planning,  determining  actual \nneeds,  preparing  action  plans,  and  augmenting  capabilities  for  water  supply  and  sanitation \nservices;  (ii)  developing  satellite,  or  secondary  and  industrial,  towns  as  employment  centers; \n(iii) preparing or  updating  master  plans;  and  (iv) upgrading of katchi abadis and slums through \nintegrated area improvement packages. For water supply and sanitation, PDP envisages that an \nadditional  55 million  persons  (28 million  rural  and  27 million  urban)  will  be  provided  with  water \nsupply  services,  thus  increasing  national  service  coverage  from  63%  to  84%;  and  another \n54 million  persons  (26 million  rural  and  28 million  urban)  will  benefit  from  sanitation  facilities, \nthus increasing national service coverage from 39% to 63%. Private sector participation in water \nsupply  for  major  cities  will  be  encouraged,  and  TMA  institutional  capacity  will  be  upgraded.  In \nline with the goals of the National Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS), the Punjab PRS also \nemphasizes,  among  key  factors  to  reduce  poverty  in  Punjab,  restoration  of  good \ngovernance, enhancement of public expenditures,  improvement in service delivery for  social \nsectors, and addressing environmental concerns. \n\n13. \nThe  Government  is  committed  to  increase  annual  pro-poor budgetary expenditures from \n0.2% of GDP to 4% of GDP by FY2004.  The Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund, established in \n1997  to  finance  income-generating  projects,  micro  enterprises,  and  community  infrastructure \nprojects,  mainly  through  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  and  the  private  sector,  has \nbegun  lending  activities.  In  April  2000,  the  Government  launched  the  National  Poverty \nAlleviation  Program,  with  the  objectives  of  stimulating  employment  and  providing  essential \ninfrastructure and services to rural and low-income urban areas. A new program to rehabilitate \nthe  poor  by  giving  them  one-time  rehabilitation  grants  ranging  from  PRs5,000 to PRs50,000 \nfrom the Zakat Fund was initiated.9 The Government increased funding for a small public works \nprogram, the Khushal Pakistan Program,10 that aims to provide gainful employment for the poor, \nplus  create  essential  infrastructure  (farm-to-market  roads,  water  supply  schemes,  repair  of \nschools,  etc.)  in  rural  and  low-income  urban  areas.  The  Government  also  set  up  the  Khushali \nBank with ADB\u2019s financial support11 in August 2001, as Pakistan\u2019s first micro finance bank. The \nGovernment has put a mechanism in place for the quarterly tracking of anti-poverty expenditures \non  the  Finance  Division\u2019s  web  site.  Most  intermediate  human  development  indicators  are  now \nreported annually.12   \n\n14. \nPG  organized  the  Punjab  Development  Forum,  held  16\u201317  September  2003,  to \ndemonstrate  its  seriousness  and  commitment  to  undertaking  wide-ranging  reforms  for  fiscal \nstabilization,  higher  growth,  enhanced  social  sector  development,  and  poverty  reduction.  PG \ntook  full  advantage  of  the  substantial  donor  interest  in  helping  achieve its development goals. \nADB has proposed an assistance program of about $1 billion over the next 4 years for Punjab. \n\n                                                 \n9 The Zakat Fund, a nongovernment budgeted Islamic welfare fund financed through a 2.5% religious levy on fixed \n\nfinancial assets of Pakistan\u2019s Muslim citizens, has operated as a major social safety net since 1980.   \n\n10  Past  programs  similar  to  the  Khushal  Pakistan  Program  have  been  implemented,  including  the  Taamir-e-Watan \n\nProgram and the Public Works Program. \n\n11 ADB. 1999. Microfinance Sector Development Program . Manila (Loan 1805/1806-PAK[SF] for $150 million). \n12 The Government has identified four intermediate human development indicators to capture the intermediate impact \nof most of its human development expenditures: (i) percentage of population registered with female health workers, \n(ii)  utilization  of  curative  health  care  facilities,  (iii)  number  of  functional  primary  and  middle  schools,  and  (iv) \npercentage  of  functional  primary  and  middle  schools  with  basic  facilities,  including  water,  latrines,  electricity,  and \nboundary walls.  \n\n\f5 \n\nOf this, half will be for the Punjab Resource Management Program, which includes support for \nwide-ranging  fiscal  and  financial  reforms,  improved  institutional  arrangements  for  sustainable \nand  pro-poor  public  services,  administrative  restructuring  and  human  resource  development, \nand  generating  growth  and  employment  through  development  of  the  private  sector.  The  other \nhalf billion dollars is for projects such as the Sustainable Livelihoods in Barani Areas Project, the \nRawalpindi  Environmental  Improvement  Project,  the  Decentralized  Social  Services  Program, \nthe  Punjab  Local  Justice  Support  Program,  and  the  proposed  Southern  Punjab  Basic  Urban \nServices  Project.  Punjab  will  also  benefit  from  several  other  ADB-assisted,  national-level \nprojects during this period \n\nThe  Project  is  formulated  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  initiatives  for  poverty  reduction, \n15. \nas well as the devolution of power and responsibility to the local governments for providing and \nfinancing urban infrastructure and municipal services. The Project incorporates several strategic \nfeatures and incentives for participation, including (i) promotion of policy reforms in accordance \nwith  PLGO2001,  (ii)  financial  management  and  resource  generation  at  the  local  government \nlevel,  (iii)  priority  for  investments  that  meet  the  basic  needs  of  urban  communities,  (iv)  local \ncommunity participation and ownership, and (v) equity participation by local governments in the \ninvestment packages. \n\n16. \nADB\u2019s  strategy.  The  focus  of  ADB\u2019s  Country  Strategy  and  Program  Update  (2004\u2013\n2006) for Pakistan is on reducing poverty by providing help in the key strategic areas of good \ngovernance,  sustainable  pro-poor  economic  growth,  and  inclusive  social  development.  The \nstrategy continues to be relevant, and in line with the new government\u2019s priorities. ADB lending \nto devolved sectors will aim to strengthen devolution by ensuring that future ADB projects are \nconsistent with the new governance structure under the PLGO2001. Where appropriate, efforts \nwill be made to realign recently approved ADB projects for devolved sectors. ADB\u2019s emphasis \nwill  remain  on  improving  delivery  of  social  services  that  supports  both increased public sector \nallocations  and  improved  governance  through  devolution,  sector  administration,  and  financial \nmanagement.  The  Water  for  All:  the  Water  Policy  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  2001 also \nsupports  ADB\u2019s  strategy  for  poverty  reduction  by  addressing  each  of  the  three  framework \nelements  of  poverty  reduction:  pro-poor  sustainable  growth,  social  development,  and  good \ngovernance.  The  main  focus  of  ADB  assistance  to  the  urban  sector  will  be  on  environmental \naspects  and  needs  of  the  poor,  and  will  broadly  cover:  (i)  institutional  restructuring  and \ndevolution of service delivery, (ii) private sector involvement in the delivery of selected services, \n(iii) budgeting and finance, and increased cost recovery and municipal revenue, (iv) increased \ncommunity participation, and (v)  attainment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The \nProject  will  develop  linkages  with  strategies  being  developed  by  forums  like  the  Global  Water \nPartnership,  the  World  Water  Council,  and  the  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Collaborative \nCouncil, to facilitate achievement of the vision, goals, and targets set through the MDGs. \n\n17. \nExternal assistance to the sector. ADB has provided seven loans, totaling about $360 \nmillion,  since  beginning  assistance  to  Pakistan\u2019s  urban sector in 1976 (that includes loans for \nthe  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  urban  development  sectors).    Another  $6.75  million  was \nprovided  for  technical  assistance  (TA)  in  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  urban  development.  So \nfar,  ADB  projects  in  Pakistan\u2019s  urban  sector  have  focused  on  North-West  Frontier  and  Sindh \nprovinces.  Japan  has  provided  the  largest  external  support  to  the  urban  sector  and  the  World \nBank, the second largest. The strategic focuses of both donors were mainly Sindh and Punjab \nprovinces.  Other  bilateral  assistance  is  provided  by  the  governments  of  Germany,  Kuwait, \nNetherlands, Switzerland, and United Kingdom. The United Nations Development Programme, \nalong with the United Nations International Children\u2019s Fund and the World Health Organization, \nhave  provided  assistance,  mostly  in  community  water  supply  and  low-cost sanitation projects. \nAppendix 3 gives more information. \n\n18. \nLessons learned.  Following are summaries of key lessons learned from ADB-financed \nprojects  for  urban  development  and  water  supply  and  sanitation  in  Pakistan,  and  a  review  of \nmultilateral and bilateral projects in Pakistan and the region:  \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nPortfolio performance has been constrained by generic macro and micro issues, \nincluding  legal  and  administrative  issues  related  to  processing  requirements; \ncoordination  difficulties;  procedural,  technical  and  project  management  issues; \ncounterpart  funding  constraints;  and  timely  release  of  counterpart  funds.  These \nissues  delay  implementation,  often  with  negative  financial  and  economic \nconsequences.  \n\nProject accountability and transparency are undermined by failure to comply with \nspecific  covenants,  delays \nin  consultant  recruitment,  minimal  beneficiary \nparticipation, poor operation and maintenance (O&M) of completed facilities, low \nfinancial  and  economic  rates  of  return,  and  frequent  changing  of  senior \nmanagement staff.  \n\nThe  quality  of  governance  is  critical  to  a  project\u2019s  success.  Highly  centralized \nproject  management  adversely  affects  project  performance  and  ownership  by \nmajor stakeholders. \n\nAll stakeholders should be fully involved in project identification and design from \nan early stage, and sufficient information should be gathered regarding the active \nNGOs  and  community-based  organizations  (CBOs)  in  the  project  area  to \nfacilitate their involvement.13 \n\nCommunity  participation  requires  intensive  interaction  among  the  project  team, \nthe participating community, and the local authorities, and it must be relevant to \nthe service needs. \n\n(vi)  Women should be empowered to participate in decision-making at the micro level \nto bring about constructive changes in living conditions of the urban poor. \n\n(vii)  Community  cost  sharing \n\nin \n\ninvestment  projects  brings  ownership  and \n\nsustainability.14  \n\n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\nInstitutional strengthening should be given the greatest emphasis and carried out \nsystematically.  \n\nDelays  in  start-up  implementation  should  be  avoided  by  taking  advance \nprocurement actions.  \n\nAn important lesson derived from the Karachi Urban Development Project15 is that urban \n19. \nupgrading  is  complex,  and  a  piecemeal  approach  involving  a  few  selected  problems  is  not  an \noptimal solution. Urban upgrading should be designed from a plan that integrates all aspects of \nurban  infrastructure,  and  involves  participation  of  the  ultimate  beneficiaries.  The  institutional \ncapacity to implement the project must be present, and the financial framework must be in place \nto  ensure  long-term  sustainability  of  the  upgrading.  A  main  lesson  learned  from  the  Karachi \nSewerage  Project16  is  that  the  sustainability  of  sewerage  projects  can  only  be  assured  if  the \nexecuting  agency  (EA)  is  in  good  financial  health.  An  important  lesson  derived  from  the \nFaisalabad  Water  Supply,  Sewerage,  and  Drainage  Project17 \nthat  continuing \ncommercialization of a utility requires improved financial autonomy and reporting on accounting, \nincreased data-based decision making, and the will and commitment of the authority concerned. \n\nis \n\n                                                 \n13  ADB. 2003.

The  sharing  approach  builds  community  ownership  of  the  system  to \n  ensure sustainability through regular maintenance instead of relying on public agencies.  \n15 ADB. 1999.

Furthermore, people\u2019s perceptions of, and attitudes toward, sanitation must be \nchanged,  because  public  awareness  and  community  participation  are  critical  in  any  sanitation \nimprovement  program.  Appendix  4  summarizes  lessons  learned  and  measures  taken  to \nincorporate those lessons into the Project. \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\n7 \n\nA. \n\nObjectives \n\n20. \nThe  overall  project goals are to  reduce  urban  poverty,  improve  community  health,  and \nreduce  environmental  degradation  in  low-income  urban  settlements  of  selected  towns  of \nsouthern Punjab where (i) safe drinking water is scarce; (ii) sewerage systems are inadequate \nor nonexistent, and there are no wastewater treatment facilities; (iii) solid waste collection and \ndisposal is insufficient; and (iv) there are few or no road links from low-income community areas \nto main urban roads. \n\n21. \n\nThe project objectives are to: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nimprove  living  conditions  and  quality  of  life  of  low-income  communities  in  21 \ntowns  by  improving  the  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities,  solid  waste \nmanagement, and road network;  \nensure  sustainability  of  urban \ninstitutional \ncapacities  of  newly  devolved  local  government  agencies,  promoting  policy \nreforms focused on greater devolution of authority, and involving all stakeholders \nin the process development of subprojects; and \nalleviate urban poverty. \n\ninvestments  by  strengthening \n\n(iii) \nThe  Project  will  cover  about  425  low-income  areas  of  21  towns18  in  6  districts19  in \n22. \nsouthern Punjab. Towns were selected in close consultation with PG, based on priority needs \nfor improvement. Low-income areas within the selected towns were identified by undertaking (i) \nextensive  socioeconomic  surveys  to  identify  urban  service  coverage,  needs  and  demands  for \nservices,  assessment  of  household  incomes,  and  willingness  to  pay  for  services;  (ii) \nparticipatory  analysis  and  planning  with  households,  especially  with  women\u2019s  groups, which \ngave  information  on  poverty  impact  and  priorities  of  vulnerable  communities  for  poverty \nreduction;  (iii)  specific  and  detailed  poverty  profiles,  clearly  defining  the  poverty  levels  within \neach  low-income  community;    and  (iv)  gender  analysis  with  particular  reference  to  women\u2019s \nparticipation in project execution.  Based on those factors, proposals for specific urban facilities \nwere developed for each low-income area.   \n\nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\nThe  Project  will  comprise  the  following  main  components:  (i)  development  of \n23. \ninfrastructure  for  basic  urban  services  and  community  development  and  participation;  and  (ii) \ninstitutional development, including development of municipal management systems for TMAs, \nproject implementation support, and incremental administration support.  \n\n \n\n1. \n\nDevelopment of Infrastructure for Basic Urban Services \n\n24.  \nThe  component  for  development  of  infrastructure  for  basic  urban  services  comprises \ninfrastructure improvements and community development and participation, and includes town-\nspecific  investments  in  one  or  more  infrastructure  improvement  subprojects  together  with \n                                                 \n18  Bahawalpur,  Ahmadpur  East,  Hasilpur,  Khairpur  Tamewali,  Yazman,  Dera  Ghazi  Khan,  Taunsa,  Jahanian, \nKabirwala, Khanewal, Mian Channu, Jalalpur Pirwala, Qadirpur Rawan,  Shujabad, Alipur, Jatoi, Kot Addu, Jampur, \nRajanpur, Rojhan, and Multan. \n\n19 Bahawalpur, Khanewal, Multan, Muzaffargarh, Dera Ghazi Khan, and Rajanpur. \n \n\n\f8 \n\nmapping and asset management, careful review of actual water use and wastewater generation, \nand  formation  of  CBOs.  The  component  will  complement  the  Government's  initiatives  for \npoverty reduction. Appendix 7 gives a summary investment plan for each project town. \n\na. \n\nInfrastructure Improvements \n\n25.   Water supply. The water supply subcomponent will improve the service and quality of \nexisting water distribution systems. It will increase revenues through a combination of updating \nconsumer  databases,  conversion  of  illegal  connections  to  registered  accounts,  leak  detection \nand repair, and monitoring of water quality. Distribution systems will be extended or rehabilitated \nfor  poorly  served  low-income  communities  of  seven  towns  with  scarce,  deep,  or  brackish \ngroundwater.  The  water  supply  subcomponent  will  include  the  provision  of  new  tubewells, \ntransmission mains, and storage reservoirs; and the construction or rehabilitation of distribution \nsystems.  \n\nAll schools in the project area will be provided latrines and connections for supply of safe \n26. \ndrinking  water.  Health  and  hygiene  education  will  be  promoted.  The  Project  will  monitor  the \neffects of improvements in water quality on health, especially on child stunting, by organizing a \nrepresentative  sample  study  and  project  performance  management  system  (PPMS).  A  pilot \nprogram  of  public  pay  toilets  will  be  implemented  in  Multan,  following  the  examples of similar \nsuccessful programs in the region.20 If successful, the program will be expanded to other towns. \n\n27. \nSewerage  systems  and  wastewater  treatment.  This  subcomponent  includes  the \nextension and rehabilitation of sewerage systems and construction of new wastewater treatment \nplants  in  19  of  the  21  towns.  It  comprises  the  rehabilitation  of  existing,  and  laying  of  new, \nsecondary  and  main  trunk  sewers;  the  rehabilitation  and  construction  of  disposal  stations;  the \nconstruction  of  new  sullage  carriers;  and  the  construction  of  one  or  more  treatment  plants. \nCommunities  will  provide  lane level sewers and house connections, with technical assistance \nfrom  the  Project.  TMAs  and  citizen  community  boards  (CCBs)  will  also  provide  assistance  to \ncommunities.  \n\n28.   Solid  waste  management.  The  solid  waste  management  subcomponent  will  improve \nthe collection and disposal of solid waste in all towns. It will include the disposal of hazardous \nhospital  wastes  in  11  towns.  This  subcomponent  will  include  (i)  community  support  through \nwaste  minimization,  with  concentration  of  wastes  at  neighborhood  collection  points;  (ii) \nprocurement of equipment and vehicles for collection an disposal of solid wastes in landfills; and \n(iii) development of landfill sites. Involvement of communities, NGOs, and the private sector in \nthe collection, recycling, and composting of solid wastes will be emphasized. \n\n29. \nLow-income  area  road  links.  This  subcomponent  will  improve  access  of  low-income \ncommunities  to  their  town  centers  and  local  neighborhoods  in  13  towns,  which  will  improve \neconomic activities. All road links will follow the existing rights-of-way. \n\n30. \nSlaughterhouses. The slaughterhouse subcomponent will comprise the construction or \nrelocation of slaughterhouses in 12 towns to improve hygienic conditions in residential areas. It \nwill  involve  improved  handling  of  wastewater  and  solid  wastes,  which  cause  serious \nenvironmental  hazards,  from  slaughterhouses.  The  relocation  or  improvement  of  municipal \nslaughterhouses can also open new opportunities for private sector involvement. \n\nIncremental  land  development  for  the  poor.  This  subproject  follows  the  successful \n31. \nKhuda  Ki  Basti  model  for  development  of  low-cost  housing  for  the  poor  in  Hyderabad  and \nKarachi.  Under  this  subcomponent,  LGRD  and  Mian  Channu  TMA  will  (i)  select  an  area  from \nstate land for housing schemes for the poor; (ii) delineate small plots; and (iii) provide from the \nProject  the  infrastructure  for  external  access  and  water  supply  and  sanitation,  but  not  internal \n\n                                                 \n20  Good  examples  to  replicate  are  the  Sulabh  (privately  financed)  and  Pune  (publicly  financed)  public  pay  toilets in \nIndia;  the  ongoing  successful  experience  in  Karachi  through  the  Citizen  Police  Liaison  Committee;  TMA  toilets \n(public-private partnership); and a similar program that was recently initiated in Lahore by the Lahore Horticulture \nDepartment. \n\n\f9 \n\ndevelopment. Construction of houses and internal infrastructure will be undertaken through the \ncommunities\u2019 own resources, with technical assistance from the Project. This subcomponent will \nbe  implemented  as  a  pilot  activity  in  Mian  Channu.  If  successful,  other  TMAs  can  replicate  it, \nusing their own resources. \n\nb. \n\nCommunity Development and Participation \n\nThe  subcomponent  for  community  development  and  participation  will  aim  to  develop \n32. \norganizational and human capacity within TMAs for participatory processes targeted at reducing \npoverty  and  providing  basic  needs.  This  subcomponent  will  include  community  development \nactivities  in  several  fields,  all  implemented  by  social  mobilizing  teams  or  NGOs.  Activities \ninclude: \n\nprograms to support infrastructure investments such as social mobilization for the \ncomponent  sharing  approach,  public  health  education,  and  hygiene  awareness \ncampaigns which will enhance readiness to install sewerage house connections; \nand  training  for  micro  contractors  in  the  installation  of  house  connections  for \nsewerage and water supply;  \naction research to improve systems of CBO-managed collection of solid waste in \nresidential neighborhoods, and CBO-managed decentralized composting; and  \nprograms  for  poverty  alleviation  that  are  responsive  to  real  demand,  such  as \nsimple  skills  training,  particularly  for  women  to  enable  them  to  increase  their \nincomes.  Through  skills  training,  women  will  set  up  small  enterprises  and \nbecome involved in activities to generate additional household income. \n\nInstitutional Development \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n2. \n \n\nc. \n\nMunicipal Management System Development for TMAs  \n\n33.  \nThe component for development of municipal management systems will cover all TMAs. \nPlanned  interventions  include  (i)  training  in  technical  and  financial management for TMA staff \nincluding  also  the  mapping  and  asset  management;  (ii)  increasing  public  awareness  of  urban \nissues,  sustainability  of  facilities,  and  options  for  improving  the  delivery  of  urban  services;  (iii) \nimproving municipal financial management by introducing improved accounting procedures and \nmanagement  information  systems  that  include  budgeting,  resource  mobilization,  enhanced \nO&M  of  assets,  and  improved  billing  and  collection  systems,  and  (iv)  establishing  regulatory \nsystems  to  ensure  that  laws,  standards,  rules,  and  regulations  are  equitably  and  consistently \napplied. These are critical to long-term sustainability of urban centers. Where possible, technical \ntraining will be hands-on and linked to measurable outputs, to enable determination of whether \nrequired skill levels have been achieved, and to verify that the training is actually used on the \njob.  The  design  and  implementation  of  measures  for  institutional  strengthening  will  be \ncoordinated  with  training  programs  provided  under  other  ongoing programs such as the DSP, \nwhere the  Project will evolve functional linkages with its TA annual planning mechanisms.   The \nProject will take into account the training capacities of existing institutions. This component will \nalso  include  exchange  visits  of  TMA  officials  for  mutual  sharing  of  successful  experiences  in \ninstitutional  development.  Appendixes  5  and  6  give  policy  actions  related  to  institutional \ndevelopment  of  TMAs  in  line  with  PLGO  2001.  Supplementary  Appendix  B  gives  tasks  to  be \nundertaken under this component. \n\nd. \n\nProject Implementation Assistance \n\n34.  \nThe  project  implementation  assistance  component  will  comprise  various  types  of \nconsulting services, including project implementation support to the Project Coordination Office \n(PCO) at the local government level, and the project units (PUs) at the TMAs for infrastructure \ndesign, construction supervision, community development, and institutional strengthening.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\ne. \n\nIncremental Administration Support \n\nIncremental  administrative  support  for  project  implementation  is  required  for  the  PCO \n35. \nand  PUs.  A  PCO,  headed  by  DG  KAUI,  will  be  responsible  for  provincial  and  interTMA \ncoordination,  planning,  and  management  of  project  activities.  The  PCO  will  require  four \nprofessional staff, representing several disciplines, and administrative support staff. At the TMA \nlevel, a PU will be established in each participating town to undertake, with the technical support \nteam,  the  subprojects\u2019  planning,  design,  and  implementation;  and  to  maintain  close  linkages \nwith associated NGOs and CBOs. A major objective of this subcomponent is to develop greater \nownership at the provincial and TMA levels. \n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n36. \nThis is the first ADB-supported investment project to make concerted efforts to align its \nscope and focus, and institutional and financing modalities,  with the new governance structure \nunder  PLGO2001.  The  Project  supports  PG  and  tehsil  authorities  for  adoption  of  the \narrangements envisaged under PLGO2001. The Project has a number of special features with \nrespect to devolution, the role of the Provincial Finance Commission (PFC), and collateral policy \nactions.  The  design  seeks  to  ensure  that  execution  arrangements  with  LGRD  do  not \ncompromise the devolved authorities of the TMAs. TMA project implementation follows the spirit \nof PLGO2001, shifting from vertical to horizontal programming.  It particularly offers assistance \nto the transition from vertical province-driven programs to programs that the TMAs should fully \ncarry out, with the necessary autonomy in the true spirit of devolution.  \n\n37. \nIn  the  past,  a  top-down  approach  was  used  in  project  preparation,  but  this  project  was \ndesigned  in  close  collaboration  with  beneficiaries,  NGOs,  and  TMAs.  Besides  extensive \nmeetings  in  the  field  with  these  groups,  three  consultative  workshops  were  organized  at  the \ninception,  interim,  and  final  stages  of  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA).    In \nthe final workshop, the TMAs endorsed the proposed scope and implementation arrangements \nof  the  Project.  The  proposed  establishment  of  PUs  at  each  TMA,  and  TMA  and  beneficiary \ninvolvement in the planning and implementation of the Project, offer an opportunity to the TMAs \nto  independently  implement  the  Project  in  line  with  their  needs,  and  within  the  spirit  of \nPLGO2001. \n\n38. \nIn most Punjab slums, more than 70% of the population lives below the poverty line, and \nwomen have less-skilled and less-remunerative jobs than men. Enhancement of women\u2019s roles \nby providing skills training to increase  their incomes is an important facet of the Project. Local \nNGOs  will  implement  the  skills  training  programs  at  facilities  made  available  by  the  Project. \nProfessional  training  will  enable  women  to  set  up  small  enterprises  and  become  involved  in \nincome-generating  activities,  thus  contributing  to  their  household  incomes.  The  training, \nsavings,  and  access  to  credit  facilities  such  as  the  ADB-assisted  Microfinance  Sector \nDevelopment  Program,  is  also  expected  to  help  increase  the  income  and  confidence  of  poor \nwomen  in  slum  areas.  Of  equal  importance,  the  Project  will  increase  awareness  on  health, \nsanitation,  and  improved  community  participation,  through  its  community  development \ncomponent. \n\nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $128.6  million  equivalent,  including  taxes \n39. \nand  duties,  of  which  $18.2  million  equivalent  (14%)  is  foreign  exchange  costs  including \n$2.7 million  in  interest  charges  during  construction.  Local  currency  costs  are    $110.4  million \nequivalent (86%). Table 1 summarizes the estimated costs.

The \n\n41.  \ninterest  rate  will  be  1%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter,     \nand such other terms and conditions in the draft Loan and Project Agreements.  \n\n42.  \nThe  OCR  loan  of  $45  million  equivalent  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a  5-year \ngrace  period.  The  interest  rate  will  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based \nlending facility, including a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-end fee of 0.5% of \nthe  loan  amount,  and  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Project \nAgreements.  The  Government  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reason  for  its  decision  to  borrow \nunder ADB\u2019s LBL facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that \nthese  choices  were  its  own  independent  decisions,  and  not  made  because  of  ADB \ncommunication or advice. \n\n43. \nThe loans will cover the Project\u2019s entire foreign exchange cost of $18.2 million (including \ninterest and other charges of $2.7 million), and will finance $71.8 million equivalent, or 65%, of \nthe local currency costs. The local currency cost to be financed by the ADB will cover portions of \nthe  civil  works,  vehicles,  consulting  services  and  Project  management  support,  but  excluding \nduties and taxes. The ADB\u2019s financing of local currency expenditure is justified by the nature of \nthe  Project,  which  will  address  poverty,  gender,  and  environment  issues  within  the  Project \nareas.  The  ADF  and  OCR  loans  will  cover  the  given  foreign  and  local  currency  costs  of the \nProject on a pro rata basis. \n\nADB  will  provide  the  loans  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan,  which  will  relend  the \n\n44. \nfunds  to  PG  on  the  same  terms  and  conditions.  PG  will  bear  the  foreign  exchange  risk  and     \nmake  the  loan  proceeds  available,  as  special  grant,  to  TMAs  through  LGRD  under  Provincial \nFinance Commission (PFC).21 Funds will be allocated to TMA, as entitlements in the grant, on \n                                                 \n21  PG  established  PFC  in  June  2002  through  an  amendment  to  PLGO2001,  to  facilitate  fiscal  transfers  from  the \n\nprovincial government to district governments, TMAs, and union administrations.    \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nthe  basis  of  TMA-specific  investment  plans  based  on  actual  needs  for  basic  urban  services, \nparticularly for  low-income communities within the agreed project scope. TMA financing will be \nsubject to TMA meeting the eligibility and the project-specific criteria (Appendix 5). For the first \nyear,  TMA  share  will  be  determined  against  the  investment  plan  defined  through  the  PPTA, \n(Supplementary  Appendix  I).  In  subsequent  years,  funds  will  be  allocated  according  to  a \nformula, based on TMA performance (Appendix 5). Design of the grant will create incentives for \nTMAs to draw down the entitled shares, or otherwise lose shares because of poor performance. \nThe unused shares will be credited to the investment pool available for reallocation, based on \nTMA performance evaluation.

The  PCO,  comprised  of  professional  staff \nsupported  by  a  team  of  consultants,  will  help  TMAs  by  providing policy guidance and interTMA \ncoordination, by implementing the Municipal Management System Development component, and \nby supporting monitoring and evaluation of works executed by the PUs. The PCO will support the \nTMAs, providing guidance in implementing project activities.   \n\n46. \nEach of the 21 TMAs will act as implementing agency and will establish a PU to execute \nthe  urban  development  component  of  the  Project.  Each  PU,  headed  by  the  TMA  chief  officer, \nwill  comprise  a  municipal  engineer,  an  accounts  officer,  subengineers,  and  support  staff.  The \nPUs will work in close collaboration with the TMA tehsil officer, infrastructure and services (TO \nI&S). In Multan, the PU will also include staff from the Multan Development Authority. The PCO \nwill provide  to  each  TMA  a  full-time  municipal  engineer  and  accounts  officer,  and  TMAs  will \narrange  subengineers  and  support  staff  for  the  PU.  Four  technical  support  teams  (TSTs)  of \nconsultants, one each placed at Multan, Bahawalpur, Dera Ghazi Khan, and Khanewal, will help \nthe PUs prepare detailed designs, and procure components for urban development.  These PUs \nwill  continue  to  exist  after  project  completion  as  the  core  development  units  of  the  tehsils,  to \nlook  after  TMAs\u2019  development  works  under  annual  development  programs,  and  to  ensure \nsustainability  of  all  development  works,  including  project  works.  Appendix 8 gives the project \nimplementation framework. \n\n47. \n\nTwo committees will be established for internal coordination: \n\n(i) \n\nA project implementation review committee (PIRC) at each tehsil, will monitor the \nimplementation  progress  of  all  project  components  monthly.  The  PIRC  will \ncomprise male and female representatives of the TMA and union councils (UCs), \nCBOs, the tehsil municipal officer, the tehsil officer for planning and coordination, \nTO  I&S,  the  TMA's  chief  officer,  consultants,  conveners  of  citizen  community \nboards  (CCBs),  and  the  LGRD  assistant  director  of  the  concerned  district. \nHeaded by a tehsil head  - the Nazim, the tehsil and UC-level women councilors \nare envisaged to play a key role in the PIRCs. \n\n\f13 \n\n(ii) \n\nA project steering committee (PSC), headed by the chairman of the PG Planning \nand  Development  Board  and  with  senior  officers  from  the  departments  of \nplanning  and  development  (P&D),  LGRD,  finance,  the  PCO  project  coordinator, \nand  tehsil  nazims  of  participating  TMAs  as  members,  will  be  set  up  within  one \nmonth  of  loan  effectiveness  at  P&D  in  Lahore.  The  PSC  will  ensure  orderly \nimplementation,  provide  policy  guidance  on  ongoing  and  new  Government \ninitiatives,  resolve  interagency  problems,  and  follow  up  with  LGRD  on  progress \non  provincial  policy  actions  (Appendix  6).  PSC  meetings  will  be  held  at  least \nevery 3 months. The PSC role will not include changing TMA eligibilities, but will \nonly  make  recommendations  to  PFC.  LGRD  will  continue  to  hold  follow-up \nmeetings, as needed, with PCO and TMAs.    \n\n48. \nIn  August  2003,  PG  established  the  Core  Project  Management  Unit  to facilitate project \nprocessing,  finalize  the  planning  commission  performa-1  (PC-1),  and  coordinate  between the \nGovernment and ADB. This arrangement will be transformed into the PCO after ADB approves \nthe Project. \n\nThe Project will be implemented over 5 years, and will be completed by January 2009. \n\n49. \nAppendix 9 gives the implementation schedule. \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n50.   All  procurement  services  for  the  Project  will  follow  ADB's  Guidelines  for  Procurement. \nContracts for civil works that are estimated to cost more than $1 million equivalent will be issued \nusing ICB procedures. Contracts estimated to cost $1 million equivalent or less will be carried \nout  through  LCB  procedures.  Minor  development  and  maintenance  may  be  carried  out  on  a \nforce account basis. The procurement of goods will preferably be grouped into packages larger \nthan  $500,000,  to  be  suitable  for  ICB  procedures.  Miscellaneous  minor  goods  that  cannot  be \ngrouped into larger contracts, and are estimated to cost less than $500,000 per contract, will be \nprocured  through  international  shopping  (IS)  procedures.  Minor  items  estimated  to  cost  less \nthan  the  equivalent  of  $50,000  per  contract  may  be  purchased  directly,  following  proper \nprocedures  to  ensure  economy,  efficiency,  and  quality.    Appendix  10  shows  the  proposed \ncontract packages.  \n\nTo  expedite  implementation,  the  PCO  will  take  advance  action  on  recruiting  all \n51.  \nconsultants,  and  prequalifying  the  contractors.  PG  has  been  informed  that  the  approval  of \nadvance actions does not commit ADB to finance the project expenditures. \n\n  \n\n4.  \n\nConsulting Services \n\n52.  \nTo  support  project  implementation,  plus  build  long-term  capacity  of  the  TMAs \nresponsible  for  planning  and  delivery  of  urban  services,  1,830  person-months  of  consulting \nservices  (32  international  and  1,798  domestic  person-months)  will  be  required,  covering  (i) \nPackage  A:  project  management  and  implementation  support  to  the  PCO  and  PUs,  including \nsubproject-detailed  design,  construction  supervision,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  (14 \ninternational,  and  518  domestic  person-months);  (ii)  Package  B:  development  of  a  municipal \nmanagement  system  (18  international  and  128  domestic  person-months); and (iii) Package C: \nPU  professionals  (1,152  person-months  of  individual  consultants\u2014one  for  each  TMA).  Also, \nlocal  NGOs  and  social  mobilizing  teams  (Package  D)  will  be  engaged  for  community \ndevelopment  and  participation  (978  person-months). Supplementary  Appendix  C  gives  more \ndetails. \n\n53.   Consultancy services for Packages A and B will be procured from both international and \ndomestic  consulting  firms.  Twenty-one  PU  consultants  under  Package  C  will  be  recruited  as \nindividual consultants. Package D consultants will be contracted to individual social mobilizers \nor  local  NGOs.  Some  of  the  required  assistance,  especially  for  training  of  local  government \nofficials,  will  be  through  government  institutions  such  as  the  provincial  LGRD,  or  the  National \n \n\n\f14 \n\nInstitute  for  Public  Administration.  Such  training  will  also  be  coordinated  with  similar  efforts \nthrough other ongoing programs such as DSP. \n\n54.  \nThe  selection  and  engagement  of  all  consulting  services  to  be  financed  under  the \nProject  will  be  in  accordance  with  the  QCBS  method  of  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants by Asian Development Bank and its Borrowers,  or other arrangements satisfactory \nto ADB for engagement of domestic consultants.  \n\n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n\n55. \nTo  expedite  disbursement  of  loan  proceeds,  LGRD  will  establish  a  first-generation \nimprest account soon after loan effectiveness. Payments for eligible project expenditures will be \nmade to and from this account. Each PU will open a second-generation imprest account. These \naccounts will be used to meet PUs\u2019 eligible expenditures under the Project. The opening of all \nimprest accounts will be subject to the appointment of qualified account  staff and establishment \nof internal control by the PCO and PUs, acceptable to ADB. Imprest accounts will be managed, \nreplenished, and liquidated in accordance with ADB's  Loan Disbursement Handbook (January \n2001),  and  arrangements  agreed  upon  between  the  Government  and  ADB.  A  statement  of \nexpenditures procedures may be used to reimburse eligible expenditures and liquidate imprest \naccounts for any individual payment no more than $50,000. The initial combined total amount in  \nall imprest accounts will not exceed 6 months of the estimated expenditures, and not more than \n10% of the total loan amount, whichever is lower.  \n\nThe PCO will disburse funds from the first generation imprest account directly for capital \n56. \nand operating costs of the PCO; consultants;  technical  support  team  offices;  capacity  building \nand  training  activities;  and  related  expenditures  for  monitoring,  review,  and  evaluation.  Funds \nfor  infrastructure  investment  components  will  be  transferred  to  second-generation  impress \naccounts, managed by the PUs on the basis of the work plans for eligible items. \n\n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n57.  \nThe  EA  will  maintain  records  and  accounts  to  identify  works,  goods,  and  services \nfinanced from loan proceeds. Specifically, the EA will: (i) maintain separate project accounts for \nPCO  and  PUs;  (ii)  ensure  an  annual  audit  of  project  accounts  and  financial  statements  in \naccordance with sound accounting principles by independent auditors endorsed by the Auditor-\nGeneral of Pakistan; and (iii) furnish to ADB, no later than 9 months after the close of each fiscal \nyear,  certified  copies  of  audited  accounts  and  financial  statements,  and  the  auditors\u2019  reports. \nAuditors that are acceptable to ADB will audit the imprest account, second-generation imprest \naccounts, and SOE. The final audit report will include a separate audit opinion on these.  \n\n58.  \nThe  PCO  will  prepare  quarterly  progress  reports  in  a  format  acceptable  to  ADB.  The \nreports will provide information on (i) progress made against established targets, including pre-\nidentified  monitoring  indicators;  (ii)  delays  and  problems  encountered,  and  actions  taken  to \nresolve them; (iii) compliance with loan covenants; and (iv) proposed programs of activities and \nexpected  progress  during  the  next  quarter.  Within  3  months  after  physical  completion  of  the \nProject, the EA will prepare and submit to ADB a project completion report on project execution, \nincluding costs and compliance with loan covenants. \n\n \n\n7.  \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nA  shortlist  of  verifiable  performance  indicators  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  was \n59. \nprepared in accordance with ADB's Project Performance Monitoring System (PPMS) Handbook \n(Supplementary Appendix D) during the PPTA.  The Government, LGRD, and PCO will ensure \nthat  a  comprehensive  PPMS  is  established  and  maintained  to  monitor  and  evaluate  the \ntechnical performance and social and economic benefits of the Project, especially for the poor \nand  for  women.  The  performance  monitoring  indicators  and  procedures  will  be  tested  with \nrespect  to  data  availability  and  other  constraints,  revised  if  necessary,  and  institutionalized  as \npart of the Project\u2019s management information system. The PUs of the participating towns, with \nPCO assistance, will be responsible for PPMS establishment and monitoring and assessment of \n\n\f15 \n\nthe  performance  for  subprojects  at  6-month  intervals.  To  measure  impact  of  the  Project  on \nbeneficiaries, particularly low-income groups, accurate baseline information must be established \nat the beginning of subproject implementation. This information will be the basis for determining \nthe  resulting  impacts.  Monitorable  indicators  will  consist  of  (i)  institutional  development \nindicators  covering  revenue  generation  and  financial  management,  along  with  O&M;  (ii) \ntypes  of  urban \nsubproject \ninfrastructure,  including  levels  of  coverage  and  service  delivery;  and  (iii)  sectoral  impact \nindicators, covering economic growth, public health, and community participation. \n\nthe  various  categories  and \n\nimplementation \n\nindicators \n\nfor \n\n \n\n8.  \n\nProject Review \n\n60.  \nThe EA and ADB will jointly review implementation progress of the Project twice yearly. \nA midterm review will be carried out within 3 years of loan effectiveness. The review will include \na  comprehensive  evaluation  of  project  implementation  arrangements,  and  include  progress \nmade  toward  designed  targets,  consultations  with  community  groups,  appraisal  of  the \ninstitutional  and  policy  development  aspects,  and \nfor \nadjustments to the project design or implementation arrangements. \n\nif  necessary,  recommendations \n\n \n\n9. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n61. \nThe PPTA has carefully identified, with the help of TMAs, the land areas to be acquired \nfor subprojects, and other project effects on resettlement. PPTA surveys show that  most of the \nland to be acquired is not productive. Land will be acquired for the Project in accordance with \nthe resettlement plan agreed upon by the Government and ADB. The Project will acquire about \n1,294  hectares  (ha)  of  land  for  wastewater  treatment  plants,  solid  waste  landfill  sites,  and \nslaughterhouses. Of this, PG owns 144 ha and private landowners, 1,150 ha. Acquisition of the \nidentified land is not expected to cause significant loss of livelihood or of community resources. \nBut  it  is  agreed  that  involuntarily  resettlement  under  the  Project  will  be  undertaken  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Handbook  on  Resettlement,  and  to  ADB\u2019s  satisfaction,  and  in \naccordance  with  the  resettlement  plan  (Supplementary  Appendix  E)  that  the  Government \nendorsed and ADB approved. \n\n10. \n\nInstitutional and Financial Action Plans  \n\n62. \nDuring project preparation, the financial capacity of each TMA was examined to ensure \nthat  each  has  the  financial  means  to  operate  and  maintain  the  existing  and  additional \ninfrastructures.  Grant  allocations  from  the  Government,  using  revenue  from  the  general  sales \ntax,  are  the  TMAs\u2019  main  source  of  revenue.  These  allocations  comprise  30%  to  50%  of  the \nrevenue of urban centers. The remainder of local government revenue is from water charges; \nimmovable  property  taxes;  and  a  range  of  other  charges,  taxes,  and  rentals.  TMA  resource \nmobilization  has  been  limited  by  weak  institutional  capacity  of  local  governments  and  the  low \nwillingness of the general public to pay for services.  \n\n63. \nPG and TMAs have agreed to take necessary steps to increase the TMAs' revenue base \nin  a  sustainable  manner,  and  enhance  and  stabilize  the  TMAs\u2019  institutional  capacities  and \norganizational setups in the light of gap analysis undertaken during the PPTA in comparing the \nPLGO2001 and existing status of TMAs. This involves (i) making adjustments necessary to fully \nalign  the  TMAs\u2019  organizational  and  institutional  structures  in  accordance  with  PLGO2001 \nrequirements;  (ii)  ensuring  TMA  compliance  in  the  conduct  of  business  of  the tehsil councils; \nadministration of data and information management related to base maps; updating of registers \nand  schedules;  improvement  of  procedures  for  budgeting,  accounting,  billing,  revenue \ncollection, and financial management; and essentials of public disclosure and transparency; and \n(iii) rationalizing the existing low levels of water tariff and implement them incrementally to cover \nO&M  of  the  existing  infrastructure  and  ensure  sustainability  of  future  development  under  the \nProject. TMAs will update consumer databases and prepare an action plan of financial reforms, \nincluding more efficient collection of water and sewerage tariffs, and incremental tariff revisions \nwith  improved  service  delivery  over  a  specified  time  frame.  All  of  these  measures  must be \nsatisfactory  to  ADB.  Project sustainability depends on these  reforms and adjustments, so PG \n \n\n\f16 \n\nand  TMAs  have  agreed  to  make  action  on  them  a  prerequisite  for  TMA  entry  into  the  Project \n(Appendix  5).  Considering  that  TMA  commitment  alone  will  not  be  a  sufficient  basis  for  a \nsuccessful  and  sustainable  investment  program,  PG  has  agreed  to  take  policy  actions  to \nsupport the TMAs in accordance with PLGO2001 (Appendix 6).   \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IM PACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits and Impacts \n\n64. \nGeneral. The Project will improve the living conditions of about 3.6 million urban residents, \nmostly poor, through improved delivery of basic municipal services. The Project will (i) increase \nsewerage and drainage service coverage; (ii) provide safe water to the poor; and thus (iii) improve \npublic  health;  (iv) provide  treated  wastewater  for  use  in  agriculture;  (v) reduce  environmental \ndegradation  and  natural  resource  depletion;  (vi) strengthen  institutional  capabilities  in  urban \nplanning  and  management,  and  in  overall  governance;  (vii) generate efficiency gains, reducing \ndistribution  leakage  and  electricity  costs  in  the  water  supply  sector;  (vii) improve cost recovery \nthrough  better  service  delivery;  (ix) enhance  growth  of  the  urban  economy;  (x)  create  local \nemployment; and (xi) reduce urban poverty. \n\n65. \nThe effectiveness and sustainability of improvements will be reinforced by efforts aimed at \ncommunity  development,  institutional  strengthening,  and  revenue  improvement  in  the  project \ntowns. These efforts will also lead to a stronger sense of belonging at local level; and increased \ncapacities  of  the  newly  created  TMAs  to  perform  their  duties  more  effectively,  especially  in \nprovision of O&M for existing, rehabilitated, and new infrastructure facilities. \n\n66. \nCommunity  involvement.  The  Project  will  encourage  and  strengthen  collective  action \nwithin  low-income  and  under-serviced  localities.  A  main  objective  of  this  work  will  be  to  make \ninfrastructure  investment  by  TMAs  more  responsive  to  demands  of  low-income  groups, more \ninclusive,  more  sustainable,  and  more  cost-effective  than  they  were  through  supply-driven \napproaches.  A secondary  objective  will  be  to  empower  low -income  groups  by  giving  them  the \ncapability for collective action through CBOs, and by forming functional links among communities, \nCBOs, union councils (UCs), and TMAs. \n\n67. \nPublic-private  and  community  partnerships.  Private  sector  involvement  will  be \nfostered  and  strengthened.  The  TMAs  will  be  urged  and  assisted  to  define  and  offer \nopportunities  for private sector activities, mainly in the transport, recycling, and composting of \nsolid  waste;  and  in  municipal  slaughterhouse  and  wastewater  treatment  plant  operations.  The \npotential for community partnerships in the delivery of urban services, the form of participation \ndeveloped, and the role of each partner will be influenced by the complexity and the degree to \nwhich the community feels ownership of the work . The array of services (e.g., water, sanitation, \nsolid waste, wastewater treatment), the scale of these services (primary, secondary, or tertiary), \nand the stage of their implementation (planning, construction, or maintenance) create a range of \nopportunities for participation. Therefore, service delivery will be disaggregated, to consider the \npotential  roles  of  partners  at  different  levels  and  to  integrate  them  into  a  practical \nimplementation proposal. \n\nPoverty reduction.  Socioeconomic surveys in the project towns show that 57% of the \n68. \nsample  households  live  on  a  monthly  income  of  less  than  Rs.5,000  ($85),  which  is  about  the \ncurrent  poverty  line.  Urban  poverty  in  the  project  towns  is  multifaceted,  ranging  from  a  lack  of \nemployment  to  deficiencies  in  basic  urban  services  such  as  water  and  sewerage  and  solid \nwaste  disposal,  to  substandard  housing.  The  combination  of  a  shortage  of  good  quality  water \nwith  inadequate  sewerage  systems  has  adversely  affected  public  health  and  the  urban \nenvironment.  \n\nThe  Project  will  provide  water  to  the  poor  through  piped  distribution  systems  or \n69. \ncommunal water points. For sanitation and wastewater management, sewerage pipe networks \n\n\f17 \n\nwill  be  rehabilitated  and  expanded  to  low-income  areas,  together  with  simple  wastewater \ntreatment plants. Expected benefits include improvements in public hygiene and health in  low-\nincome  areas,  and  reduced  pollution  of  groundwater  and  surface  water  in  the  project  towns. \nImproved public health will contribute to a more productive labor force. Employment generated \nin  civil  works  will  contribute  directly  and  positively  to  poverty  reduction.  Improved  solid  waste \nmanagement  and  recycling,  preferably  with  private  sector  involvement,  will  also  create \nemployment for the urban poor. Use of treated effluent for irrigation will help improve agriculture \nproduction and income for poor farmers. Appendix 11 shows a summary poverty reduction and \nsocial strategy.  \n\nGender. A large part of the Project\u2019s benefits will accrue to women. Women\u2019s time and \n70. \nenergy  will  be  saved  by  provision  of  water  supply  to  households,  whether  through  pipes  or \ncommunal water points. Women will also enjoy a large part of the benefits of improved sewerage \nbecause (i) women spend more time within the residential neighborhoods than men and thus, will \nbenefit more from improved hygiene there; and (ii) women are traditionally charged with the care \nof sick family members and will thus benefit more from reduced illness.  The Project will address \ngender  issues  by  (i)  strengthening  the  role  of  women  councilors  in  municipal  governance;  (ii) \ninvolving  women  groups  in  community-level  project  activities;  (iii)  including  women  of  local \ngovernment  institutions  in  training  activities;  and  (iv)  conducting  community  training  and \nmobilizational campaigns for project beneficiaries in the wards at the UC level to ensure active \nparticipation  of  women.  Supplementary  Appendix  F  gives  a  gender  strategy,  which  PG  has \napproved. \n\nEnhancing the role of women by providing skills training to increase their income levels \n71. \nis  an  important  project  facet.  Skills  training  will  enable  women to set up small enterprises and \nbecome  involved  in  income-generating  activities  that  contribute  to  household  incomes.  The \ntraining,  savings,  and  access  to  credit  facilities  such  as  the  ADB-assisted  Microfinance \nDevelopment  Program  are  expected  to  help  increase  the  incomes  and  confidence  of  poor \nwomen in the slums.  \n\n72.  Minorities  and  indigenous  people.  The  cultural  and  ethnic  diversity  of  people  in  the \nproject  towns  was  reviewed  as  part  of  the  socioeconomic  survey  during  the  PPTA.  Detailed \nanalysis  showed  no  evidence  of  negative  impacts  on  minorities  or  indigenous  people.  Some \nhouseholds  of  a  religious  minority  whose  members  work  as  municipal  sweepers  are  in  areas \nthat  lack  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities.  The  Project  will  address  their  needs through (i) \nprovision of public water stand posts in their neighborhoods, (ii) improving access to sewerage \nsystems,  (iii)  at  least  30%  employment  of  women  in  the  community-based  program  for  solid \nwaste  management,  (iv)  participation  of  men  and  women  community  leaders  in  the  users\u2019 \ngroups, and (v) employment of labor from this community in civil works. \n\n73. \nEconomic  and  financial  benefits.  Economic  and  financial  analyses  of  the  proposed \nsubprojects  were  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Framework  for  the  Economic  and \nFinancial  Appraisal  of  Urban  Development  Sector  Projects   (Appendixes  12  and  13).  The \neconomic  benefits  identified  were  based  on  each  subproject  in  21  project  towns.  Economic \ninternal  rates  of  return  (EIRRs)  were  prepared  for  18  sewerage  subprojects,  7  water  supply \nsubprojects, 12 slaughterhouses, 21 solid waste management subprojects, and 13 subprojects \nfor upgrading of road links in low-income communities. The benefits include significant poverty \nalleviation and improvements in living conditions, particularly in health and hygiene of the largely \npoor  urban  populations.  This  will  be  mainly  through  sewer  connections  and  improved  solid \nwaste collection and disposal. Wastewater treatment will provide additional water for agricultural \nproduction, and reduce environmental damage.  \n \n74. \nHealth and nonincremental benefits of water supply subprojects include (i) resource cost \nsavings  for  users  obtaining  water  from  secondary  sources,  which  will  be  contaminated  if  the \nwater  supply  subproject  is  not  implemented;  and  (ii)  availability  of  water  that  is  now  being \n\n \n\n\f18 \nwasted,  after  improvement  of  facilities  under  the  Project.22  Incremental  benefits  include \nadditional  water  sales  to  meet  suppressed  or  increased  demand  of  existing  customers,  and \nadditional sales to new customers who will be connected to the piped network. These benefits \nare based on customers\u2019 willingness to pay. \n\n75.  \nThe financial internal rate of returns (FIRRs) for subprojects range from 6% to 33% for 6 \nwater  supply  subprojects,  5%  to  30%  for  12  slaughterhouses,  and  11%  to  55%  for  21  solid \nwaste  subprojects.  The  incremental  costs  of  some  sub-components  will  be  quite  low  as \ncompared  to  the  incremental  revenues  which  result  in  high  FIRRs.  The  FIRRs  exceed  the \nweighted average cost of capital, which is about 5%, demonstrating that the Project is financially \nviable at proposed tariff levels. Testing of the switching values and sensitivity indicators showed \nthe subprojects to be financially viable under adverse cost and revenue scenarios. \n\n76.  \nThe EIRR calculation was undertaken in constant 2003 prices using the domestic price \nnumeraire,  since  the  outputs  are  nontradable  in  nature.  Economic  costs,  excluding  taxes  and \nmarket distortions, are converted using a standard conversion factor of 0.85. The EIRRs in the \nproject  towns  for  water  supply  subprojects  range  from  17.3%  for  Rohjan  to  45.2%  in  Multan; \nEIRRS  for  sewerage  range  from  13%  in  Jahanian  to  35.5%  in  Yazman;  for  solid  waste,  from \n16.1% in Hasilpur to 57.9% in Khanewal; for slaughterhouses, from 12.2% in Rohjan to 57.4% \nin Ahmadpur East; and link roads in low-income areas, from 14.4% in Qadirpur Ran to 51.1% in \nJahanian.    Switching  values  and  sensitivity  indicators  were  tested,  and  standard  and  project-\nspecific sensitivity cases were conducted on key variables, using 20% increases in capital and \nO&M costs and 30% decreases in willingness to pay and number of households benefited. Most \nsubprojects  were  found  economically  viable  under  adverse  cost:  benefit  scenarios,  except in \nsmaller  towns  with  lower  beneficiary  populations  and  lower  economic  activity.  Supplementary \nAppendix G gives results of the economic analysis of each subproject in 21 project towns. \n\n77.   Environmental  impact.  Initial  Environmental  Examinations  (IEEs) were carried out on \nall the subprojects and components as part of the PPTA. The IEEs concluded that the proposed \nsubprojects  and  components  will  have  no  significant  adverse  impacts on the environment and \nconsequently,  no  subproject  will  require  an  environmental  impact  assessment.  In  conformity \nwith  environmental  management  practices,  the  Project  will  develop  and  operationalize  an \nenvironmental monitoring and management plan. PG will ensure that environmental standards \nprescribed by the Punjab Environmental Protection Agency are met. Supplementary Appendix H \ngives a summary IEE. \n\nB. \n\nRisks \n\n78.  Major risks associated with the Project include \n\n(i) \n\nThe acquisition of the required land may be delayed or not forthcoming. This could \ndelay or impede the implementation of certain subprojects; \n\n(ii)  Future  legislation  could  possibly  gradually  erode  the  comprehensiveness  and \nconsistency  of  the  PLGO2001,  which  could  seriously  impede  the  TMAs\u2019 \neffectiveness as main actors in project implementation; \n\n(iii)  Efforts for enhancement of the revenue base and institutional strengthening of the \nTMAs  may  not  give  sufficient  and  sustainable  results.  This  could  affect  project \nimplementation or the long-term sustainability of improvements, or both. \n\n(iv)  Delayed  TMA  actions  in  meeting  the  agreed  eligibility  criteria  may  cause  start-up \n\ndelays. \n\n79.  Major  project  risks  have  been  minimized,  and  will  be  responded  to,  by  the  linkage  of \nproject  execution  with  the  TMAs\u2019  compliance  with  eligibility  criteria,  extensive  community \nparticipation  to  develop  project  ownership,  and  expected  benefits  and  positive  impacts. \nDevolution  is  a  particular  Government  commitment  to  reform  and  the  Project  is  a  timely \ncontribution to the devolution process.  \n                                                 \n22 Damaged pipes in the water distribution network cause high leakage and wastage of water. \n\n\fV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n19 \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nThe Government and PG have given the following specific assurances, in addition to the \n\n80.  \nstandard assurances which have been incorporated in the legal documents.  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nfor \n\nfrom \n\nfunds \n\nfor  each \n\nfiscal  year \n\nPG  will  undertake  all  time-bound  policy  actions  as  specified  in  Appendix  6, \nagreed with ADB.  \nPG will ensure that TMAs meet specific prerequisites as specified in Appendix 5 \nrelated to compliance with PLGO2001 and TMA rules of business. \nPG  will  allocate  and  make  available  to  LGRD  and  eligible  TMAs,  in  a  timely \nmanner,  sufficient \nthe \nits  budget \nimplementation  of  the  Project  and  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  Project \nfacilities  and  will  ensure  that  such  facilities  are  operated  and  maintained  in \naccordance with sound urban utility practices. \nPG  will  allow  and  facilitate ADB\u2019s representatives to carry out spot and random \nchecks  on  (a)  flow  of  funds  and  their  use  for  the  Project;  (b)  work-in-progress; \nand (c) Project implementation. \nThe  Government/PG  will  ensure  that  all  land,  rights-of-way  and  other  rights \nrequired for any sub-project will be acquired or otherwise made available to the \nTMA concerned in a timely manner. The Government/PG will further ensure that \nall  land  acquired  for  the  Project  will  be  acquired  in  accordance  with  the  land \nacquisition  plan  agreed  between  the  Government/PG  and  ADB  and  will  ensure \nthat the social and economic base of the affected persons will be restored and/or \nenhanced through mitigating measures.  \nThe  Government  will  cause  PG  and  TMAs  to  ensure  that  all  environmental \nmitigation  measures  identified  in  the  initial  environmental  examination  are \nincorporated into the Project design and implemented during Project construction \nthe  Government\u2019s \nand  operation  and  maintenance, \nenvironmental \nregulations,  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy,  ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental  guidelines  as  set  forth  in  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines \n(2003) and the environmental management plan agreed with ADB.  \n\nin  accordance  with \n\nlaws  and \n\n(vii)  PG will  ensure  that  the  TMAs  retain  the  PUs  after  project  completion  as  the \ntehsil\u2019s  core  development  units  to  look  after  TMAs\u2019  development  works  under \nannual  development  programs,  and  ensure  sustainability  of  all  development \nworks, including those of the Project. \n\n(viii)  PG will ensure that no persons, regardless of land title, will be adversely affected \nin  terms  of  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  and  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nIndigenous  People.  PG  will  further  ensure  that  any  involuntary  resettlement \nunder the Project will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Handbook on Resettlement, \nto ADB\u2019s satisfaction, and in accordance with the resettlement framework agreed \nupon  by  the  Government,  PG  and  ADB.  If  applicable,  individual  resettlement \nplans  will  be  prepared  for  each  TMA  in  accordance  with  the  resettlement \nframework.  \nPG  and  TMAs  will  implement  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nthe \nGovernment\u2019s  laws  and  regulations  including  the  Land  Acquisition  Act  of  1984, \nthe Project Implementation and Resettlement of Affected Persons Ordinance of \n2002,  the  Punjab  Development  of  Cities  Act  of  1977,  and  the  Pakistan \nEnvironmental Protection Act of 1997, as amended from time to time.   \nPG  will  ensure  women\u2019s  participation  in  project  implementation  in  accordance \nwith the gender strategy as agreed between the Government and ADB. PG will \n\nInvoluntary  Resettlement \n\n  and \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\ncause  LGRD  to  ensure  that  (i)  women  councilors  of  TMAs  and  UCs  will  be \ntrained  for  effective  gender-based  planning  and  monitoring  of  project  activities, \n(ii) all women councilors are included in PIRCs of each TMA, and (iii) at each PU, \none  female  community  development/social  mobilization  staff  will  be  hired  to \nfacilitate women\u2019s participation in planning of subproject activities. \n\nB. \n\nCondition for Loan Effectiveness \n\n81.  \n\nFollowing is a condition for loan effectiveness:  \n\n- \n\nThe PC-1 of the Project will have been approved by the Executive Committee of \nthe National Economic Council of Pakistan. \n\nC.  \n\nCondition for Withdrawals from

has  overtaxed  the  abilities  of  government  institutions  to \nprovide  adequate  infrastructure  and  urban  services.  Much  of  the  urban  growth  has  been \nuncontrolled  and  unplanned,  because  of  the  absence  of  effective  planning  and  enforcement \ntools,  and  insufficient  development  of  human  resources.  Most  towns  and  cities  lack  plans  for \ncontrolled  urban  development,  and  for  linkage  between  the  development  of  new  housing  and \ncommercial  or  industrial  areas.  Most  urban  areas  have  not  developed  the  infrastructure  and \nurban services needed to support such urban growth and expansion. \n\n2.    Urban  areas  suffer  from  various  deficiencies  in  infrastructure.  Town  centers  generally \nhave  most  required  elements  of  physical  infrastructure, including roads, markets, bus stands, \nwater  supply  systems  without  community  involvement,  sewerage  systems,  and  solid  waste \ncollection systems. Some systems, especially roads, markets, and bus stands, suffer capacity \nproblems because urban populations and commercial activities in the town centers have grown \nto a level beyond that for which they were designed. As a result, commercial activities spill over \ninto the streets\u2014which are already overburdened by a vehicle traffic volume far higher than for \nwhich they were designed. \n\nSystems for water supply, sewerage, and solid waste collection suffer greatly from poor \n3.   \noperations and maintenance (O&M). The provincial government often designed and constructed \nthe  water  supply  systems,  then  turned  them  over  to  the  local  government  for  O&M.  Local \ngovernment then must somehow handle gaps between the design of those systems and the real \nconsumer  demand.  The  gaps  are  often  considerable,  and  led  to  poor  utilization  of  those \nsystems,  resulting  in  poor  cost  rec overy  and  the  need  for  permanent  subsidies  from  local \ngovernment budgets. The collection and disposal of municipal solid waste is mostly poor, with \nno  participation  of  local  communities,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  or  the  private \nsector.  Uncollected  waste  causes  adverse  environmental  effects,  such  as  bad  odors  and  the \nbreeding of flies. Poor collection and removal of solid waste also leads to the clogging of sewer \nlines,  a  major  problem  of  urban  infrastructure  systems.  Blocked  sewer  lines  make  household \nsewage collection ineffective, and cause ponding of sewage in lanes and streets. This leads to \ndamage  to  private  and  public  property,  disruption  of  traffic,  breeding  of  mosquitoes  and  other \npests,  and  infiltration  of  sewage  into  shallow  groundwater\u2014which  leads  to  serious  health \nproblems,  because  most  households  use  the  shallow  groundwater,  through  hand  or  motor \npumps, as their main water sources. Some basic services are totally missing in peripheral and \nunder-serviced areas of most towns. There, people use shallow, brackish water, or take water \nfrom public standposts where available. Sewerage systems are nonexistent, and sewage often \nflows  uncontrolled  into  depressions  where  it  ponds.  There  is  often  no  organized  collection  of \nmunicipal solid waste. \n\nB. \n\nUrban Sector Institutions \n\n4.    With  the  Punjab  Local  Government  Ordinance  2001  (PLGO2001),  responsibility  for \ndelivery of municipal urban services, and for environmental improvement, rests mainly with the \ntehsil  municipal  administration  (TMAs).  Some  responsibility  rests  with  the  lowest  level  of  local \ngovernment,  the  union  councils  which  are  charged  with  community  development  and  related \ntasks; and with district governments, which handle affairs related to government land as well as \nthe health and education sectors.  \n\n5.   \nImplementation  of  the  PLGO2001  has  considerably  reduced  the  previously  dominating \nroles of provincial agencies, especially of the Housing, Urban Development, and Public Health \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n\nEngineering  Department  (HUD&PHED),  whose  staff  has  been  transferred  to  local government \nagencies.  \n\n6.   \nFor  major  Punjab  cities,  including  Multan,  the  largest  city  in  the  project  area,  special \ndevelopment  authorities  had  been  set  up  through  the  Development  of  Cities  Act, 1976. These \nauthorities, which previously worked under HUD&PHED, are now under the TMAs. \n\n7.   \nTMAs  are  supervised  by  the  provincial  Local  Development  and  Rural  Development \nDepartments (LGRDs), which support and monitor progress in implementation of PLGO 2001, \nincluding all required adjustments and improvements in institutional and organizational setups,  \nas well as financial management. This department is now the provincial agency best suited to \nsteer TMAs in delivery of basic urban services. \n\n8.    Within the LGRD, the Directorate General of Katchi Abadi and Urban Improvement  (DG \nKAUI) has been given the specific responsibility of resolving problems related to  katchi abadis \n(unauthorized settlements or slums on state-owned lands, with little or no infrastructure).  \n\nC. \n\nGovernment Policies and Plans \n\n9.   \nPakistan\u2019s  national  urban  and  housing  policy  is  reflected  in  the  Ten  Year  Perspective \nDevelopment  Plan  2001\u20132011,  which  describes  the  main  urban  problems  as  (i) environmental \ndegradation,  mushrooming  of  katchi  abadis,  and  breakdown  of  infrastructure  and  municipal \nservices;  (ii) lack  of  vision,  inadequate  institutional  setup,  and  weak  financial  bases,  (iii) a \nbacklog  of  2 million  housing  units,  in  addition  to  the  2.3  million  units  that  are  structurally \nobsolete;  and  (iv) the  absence  of  a  housing  finance  institution  to  provide  affordable loans for \nhouse construction. \n\n10.  \nThe plan envisages the following strategies for urban development: (i) strengthening the \nrole  of  local  organizations  in  planning,  determining  needs,  preparing  action  plans,  and \naugmenting  capacities  for  water  supply  and  sanitation  services;  (ii)  developing  satellite, \nintermediate or  secondary,    and  industrial  towns  as  employment  centers;  (iii) preparing or \nupdating master plans; (iv) implementing the national policy on  katchi abadis; and (v) upgrading \nkatchi abadis and slums through integrated packages for area improvement. \n\n11.  \nFor water supply and sanitation, the plan envisages providing water supply services to \nan additional 55 million persons (28 million rural and 27 million urban), thus increasing national \nservice coverage from 63% to 84%; and sanitation facilities for an additional 54 million persons \n(26 million rural and 28 million urban), thus increasing national sanitation coverage from 39% to \n63%.  Private  sector  participation  in  water  supply  for  major  cities  will  be  encouraged, and the \ninstitutional capacity of water supply and sanitation agencies will be upgraded.  \n\nPakistan\u2019s  National  Housing  Policy  2001  acknowledges  the  need  for  development  of \n12.  \nhousing for the poor and needy. It envisages a strategy that combines community participation, \ninstitutional strengthening, and the development of a commercially oriented system of housing \nfinance. It also emphasizes addressing the problem of  katchi abadis, squatter settlements, and \nslums through regulation where appropriate, relocation where required, and urban improvement. \n\n13. \nThe  Government  is  committed  to  increasing  annual  pro-poor budgetary expenditures by \nthe  current  0.2%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  to  4.0%  of  GDP  in  FY2004.  The Pakistan \nPoverty Alleviation Fund, established in 1997 to finance community income-generating projects, \nmicroenterprises,  and  infrastructure  projects,  mainly  through  nongoverment  organizations \n(NGOs)  and  the  private  sector,  has  begun  lending  activities.  In  April  2000,  the  Government \nlaunched  the  National  Poverty  Alleviation  Program,  with  the  objectives  of  stimulating \n\n \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nemployment  and  providing  basic  infrastructure  and  services  to  rural  and  low-income  urban \nareas.  A  new  program  was  initiated  to  rehabilitate  the  poor  by  giving  one-time  rehabilitation \ngrants  ranging  from  Rs5,000  to  RS50,000  from  the  Zakat  Fund.  The  Government  increased \nfunding for a small public works program, the Khushal Pakistan Program, which aims to provide \ngainful  employment  for  the  poor,  plus  develop  essential  infrastructure  such  as  farm-to-market \nroads,  water  supply  schemes,  and  school  repair  in  rural  and  low-income  urban  areas.  The \nGovernment  also  set  up  the  Khushali  Bank,  Pakistan\u2019s  first  microfinance  bank,  with  financial \nsupport  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)23  in  August  2001.  The  Government  has \ninitiated  a  mechanism  for  the  quarterly  tracking  of  antipoverty  expenditures  on  the  Finance \nDivision\u2019s web site. Most intermediate human development indicators are now reported annually.  \n\n14. \nIn  line  with  goals  of  the  National  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  (PRS),  the  Punjab \nPRS  also  emphasizes,  as  among  key  factors  to  reduce  poverty  in  Punjab,  restoration of \ngood  governance, enhancement of public expenditures,  improvement  in  service  delivery  for \nsocial sectors, and addressing of environmental concerns. \n\nD. \n\nRelevant ADB Strategies \n\n15. \nADB\u2019s  Country  Strategy  and  Program  Update  (2004\u20132006)  for  Pakistan  focuses  on \nsupporting poverty reduction by assisting in the strategic areas of good governance, sustainable \npro-poor  economic  growth,  and  inclusive  social  development.  This  strategy  continues  to  be \nrelevant, and in line with priorities of the new government.  ADB lending to devolved sectors will \naim to strengthen devolution, by ensuring that future ADB projects are designed to be consistent \nwith the new governance structure under local government ordinances of August 2001. Where \nappropriate, efforts will be made to realign recently approved ADB projects for devolved sectors. \nADB will continue to emphasize the delivery of social services to support both increased public \nsector allocations made possible by enhanced fiscal space; and improved governance through \ndevolution and better sector administration and financial management. ADB\u2019s water policy also \nsupports  its  poverty  reduction  strategy  by  addressing  each  of  the  three  elements  of  its \nframework  for  poverty  reduction  (pro-poor  sustainable  growth,  social  development,  and  good \ngovernance).  The  main  focus  of  ADB  assistance  to  the  urban  sector  will  be  on  environmental \naspects and the needs of the poor. Assistance will cover, broadly, institutional restructuring and \ndevolution  of  service  delivery,  private  sector  involvement  in  the  delivery  of  selected  services, \nbudgeting  and  finance,  increased  cost  recovery  and  municipal  revenue;  increased  community \nparticipation;  and  attainment  of  the  millennium  development  goals  (MDGs).

A  strong  project  coordination  office (PCO), \ntechnical  and  project  management \nwith  adequate \ncompetence,  will  facilitate  the  project  units  (PUs)  in \nsmooth  project  execution.  Regarding  the  release  of \ncounterpart  funds,  the  Government  recently  issued  a \ndirective  to  release  funds  directly  to  the tehsil municipal \nadministration  units  (TMAs),  rather  than  through  districts. \nThis should avoid delays in TMA receipt of funds. \n\nDesign  of  loan  covenants  was  closely  coordinated  with \nthe  Government  and  TMAs.  The  project  implementation \ncommittee  (PIRC)  at  TMA  and  the  project  steering \ncommittee  (PSC)  at  the  provincial  level  will  monitor  and \nregularly  report  on  compliance,  along  with  the  PCO. \nComponents \ninstitutional  capacity  building  and \nimplementation  of  agreed  financial  reforms  will  improve \nfinancial  and  economic  rates  of  return.  Advance  actions \nrecruitment  will  be  encouraged.  An \non  consultant \nagreement  with \nfor  continuity  of \nthe  Government \nrecruitment of senior project management staff has been \nreached.   \n\nfor \n\nThe  Project  will  give  the  greatest  practical  authority  to \nlocal  governments  through  TMAs,  and  will  involve  the \ncommunities intensively in the implementation phase. \n\nlocations  and \n\nthe  proposed  project \nThe  project \nconsultative \ninterventions  were \nprocesses \nlocal \ninvolving \ncommunities.  Three  stakeholder  workshops  were  held \nduring the processing of the Project \n\nidentified \nlocal  governments  and \n\nthrough \n\nA gender strategy has been agreed upon that will involve \nwomen throughout planning and implementation.  \n\nThrough  the  institutional  capacity-building  component, \ninstitutional strengthening of TMAs will be carried our in a \nplanned manner.  \n\nStart-up  delays \nland \nacquisition (LA) and resettlement, should be addressed \nthrough advance actions. \n\nimplementation, \n\nincluding \n\nin \n\nAdvance actions were agreed upon on establishment and \nstaffing  of  PCO  and  PUs,  consultant  recruitment,  and  LA \nand resettlement in the earliest stage.     \n\nQuality  of  governance  is  critical  to  the  success  of  a \nproject;  highly  centralized  project  management \nadversely  affects  project  performance  and  ownership \nby major stakeholders. \n\nThe  Project  will  give  the  greatest  practical  authority  to \nlocal  governments  through  TMAs,  and  will  involve  the \ncommunities intensively in implementation. \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n31 \n\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AND PERFORMANCE-BASED LENDING  \nTO TEHSIL MUNICIPAL ADMINISTRATIONS \n \n\nA. \n\nEligibility Criteria \n\nRequirements  of  the  Punjab  Local  Government  Ordinance,  2001  (PLGO2001)  for \n\n1. \nelections and conduct of business of Monitoring and House Committees are met. \n\nThe Tehsil Council Secretariat is strengthened with required staff and equipment, and as \n\n2. \nrequired under PLGO2001, budget provisions are made for its functioning. \n\n3. \nOrganization of offices.

Complaint cells will be set up at each CO unit to address complaints \nrelating  to  municipal  service  delivery,  and  at  TMA  headquarters  for  complaints  relating  to \nadministrative matters. Their institutional linkages with internal audit will be developed to ensure \nquality  services  and  standards.  (ii)  Procedures  for  registration,  recording,  follow  up,  and \naddressing of complaints will be designed and disseminated. \n\nTransfer of functions.  All  TMAs  are  to  hold  discussions  and  prepare  action  plans  for \n\n6. \nthe transfer of functions to the union administration as per PLGO2001. \n\n7. \n\nCitizen Community Boards (CCBs): \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe  TMAs  will  observe  requirements  of  PLGO  2001  for  providing  25%  of  the         \ndevelopment budget for CCB projects. \nThe  recently  developed  rules  for  registration  of  CCBs  should  be  widely \ndisseminated for public awareness. \n\nDetails  of  documents  and  other  information  to  be  made  available  to  the  public  will  be \n8. \nprepared,  along  with  procedures  for  dissemination  of  the  information,  and  how  it  can  be \nobtained from TMAs. \n\n9. \n\nUser charges for water supply and sewerage connection: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n A 6-month  action  plan  will  be  prepared  for  staff  of  tehsil  officers,  Infrastructure \nand  Services  (I&S),  CO  unit,  and  tehsil  officers  (finance)  to  survey,  detect, \ndisconnect, and regularize illegal connections to water supplies. Formats will be \ndesigned to document the survey for checking of legal connections and detection \nof illegal connections. \n\n An action plan will be prepared for implementing financial reforms, including the \nrationalization  of  the  existing  low  water  tariffs  to  cover  operations  and \nmaintenance,  more  efficient  collection  of  water  and  sewerage  tariffs,  and \nincremental tariff revisions over a specified time frame and with improved service \ndelivery.  Such  a  plan,  supported  by  the  tehsil  councils,  will  be  approved  by  the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  and  first  revision  of  the  agreed  tariff  plan \nimplemented. \n\n10. \nOther  revenue -enhancement  measures.  A  baseline  survey  will  be  initiated  to \ndetermine revenue potentials of items such as licensing, parking stands, and transport stands. A \n\n \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nprogram  will  be  developed  for  conducting  regular  surveys  to  keep  the  revenue  database \nupdated. \n\nArrears. Budget rules regarding arrears will be complied with. All arrears will be detailed \n\n11. \nin the budget format, and reasons for nonrecovery of arrears will be given. \n\nProject-related actions.  Within  3  months  after  loan  approval,  TMAs  will  (i)  set  up  a \n12. \ntehsil  project  unit  (PU)  and  designate  officials  and  staff  to  run  it,  to  undertake  project \nresponsibilities;  (b)  set  up  a  project  implementation  review  committee (PIRC); and (c) prepare \nannual work plans and budgets for PU as part of the TMA budgets, which will be approved by \nthe tehsil council.  \n\nB. \n\nPerformance-Based Lending \n\nFunds to TMAs will be allocated on the basis of a TMA-specific investment plan based \n13. \non  the  actual  needs  of  the  TMA  for  basic  urban  services,  particularly  for  low-income \ncommunities, within the agreed scope of the Project. The PFC Grant will be available to TMAs \nmeeting: \n \n\n(i)  \n\n(ii) \n\nEligibility  Criteria:  All  TMAs  will  meet  the  eligibility  criteria  before  approval  of \nany sub-project. PCO will assist TMAs in undertaking the required actions under \nthe eligibility criteria and prepare a compliance report, which will be reviewed and \nendorsed  by  LGRD  and  submitted  to  ADB  for  review  and  approval.  Future \nquarterly  progress  reports  to  be  prepared  by  PCO  will  include  the  status  of \nsustainability  of  the  required  actions  under  the  eligibility  criteria.    ADB  review \nmissions will review and validate the situation in the light of these reports.  \nProject  Specific  Criteria:  Upon  fulfillment  of  the  eligibility  criteria,  TMAs  will \nprepare annual work plans and budgets for their respective PUs. In order to fulfill \nthe  project  specific  criteria,  TMAs  will  be  required  to  meet:  (a)  generic;  and  (b) \nsector-specific requirements:  \n\n(a)  Generic requirements: TMAs will: (i) ensure transparency in all bidding \nprocedures,  the  compliance  whereof  will  be  certified  by  the  package  A \nconsultants  specified  in  the  Supplementary  Appendix  C;  (ii)  be  required, \nupon release of overall  annual  development  funds  by  PG,  to  demonstrate \navailability of requisite counterpart funds for the sub-projects and adequate \nbudget  for  meeting  the  operation  and  maintenance  expenditure  of  the \nexisting facilities of the TMAs. LGRD will provide the status of such funds to \nADB for the ADB\u2019s consideration. \n\n(b)  Sector-specific requirements:  \n\nWater  Supply  and  Sewerage  Improvement  Works: TMAs will finalize \nplans for the detection of leaks and the rectification thereof, and for water \nquality  monitoring.  In  view  of  the  consumer  survey  and  tariff  plan \nfurnished under the eligibility criteria, which will be approved by ADB, first \nbills will be issued for water supply and sewerage charges and all illegal \nconnections will be detected and regularized, as certified by the package \nA consultants specified in the Supplementary Appendix C.    \n\nWastewater \ntreatment  plant,  solid  waste  management,  and \nslaughterhouse:  Upon  completion  of  the  requisite  actions  to  be \nundertaken  by  the  district  governments,  TMAs  will  acquire  all  land \nrequired,  in  accordance  with  land  acquisition  plan  agreed  between  the \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n33 \n\nGovernment/PG  and  ADB  and  involuntary  resettlement,  if  any,  will  take \nplace in accordance with the resettlement framework. \n\nLow  income  area  link  roads:  TMAs  will  finalize  the  arrangements  with \ncommunities and CCBs for the implementation schedule of the roads. \n\nIncremental  land  development:    Following  clearance  from  PG,  the \nrequired  government  land  will  be  arranged  and  demarcated,  and  plots \naccordingly delineated with the assistance of LGRD.  \n\n \n14. \nPG  will  determine  the  share  of  the  PFC  Grant  to  be  provided  to  each  TMA,  in  the  first \nyear of the Project, on the basis of the investment plan specified in the Supplementary Appendix \nI.  In  subsequent  years,  the  PFC  Grant  will  be  allocated  according  to  the  formula  agreed  with \nADB. Performing TMAs will be entitled to withdraw their agreed allocation and the TMAs that fail \nto  meet  minimum  performance  targets  will  forfeit  their  share  of  the  PFC  Grant.  Any  unused \nshares will be credited to the investment pool (Investment Pool) and will be available, annually, \nfor  reallocation  to  other  TMAs  based  on  a  performance  evaluation  of  the  TMAs,  as  provided \nunder the following performance measures (Performance Measures) and the Investment Pool:  \n \n\n(i) \n\nInvestment Project-specific Performance Measures (IPPM): \n\n \nThe IPPM will include measures to be observed by TMAs to ensure the effective use of \n15. \nresources  allocated  to  individual  investment  projects.  The  performance  of  the  TMAs  will  be \nmeasured and evaluated on a sliding scale as follows: \n\n  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n(vii) \n\nin  sub-projects  (satisfactory  10  points;  partly \n\noperations  of  PUs  (fully  staffed,  equipped  and  functional  10  points; \ninadequate in above areas 0-5 points depending on deficiency); \ncommunity  participation \nsatisfactory 5 point; unsatisfactory 0 point); \ncompliance  of  TMAs  with  agreed  targets  for  physical  progress  (variance  of \nactual versus stipulated progress within 10% (10 points); between 10-20% (5-\n10 points); more than 20% (0 point); \nquality of construction in general (satisfactory 10 points, partly satisfactory 5 \npoints, and unsatisfactory 0 point); \nobservance of the PLGO 2001 in respect of maintenance of accounts, closing \nof accounts (satisfactory 10; unsatisfactory 0); \ntendering and procurement (transparent 10 point;  problematic 0 point); \nTMA  staff  involved  in  construction  supervision  (fully  involved  10  points; \npartially involved 0 point); \n\n(viii)  PIRC meetings, (held regularly 10 points; irregular 5 points; not held 0 point); \nprogress  reports,  submitted  by  PUs  to  PCO  (regularly  10  points,  irregular \n(ix) \nsubmission 5 points, not submitted 0 points); and \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  (M  &  E)  (TMA  staff  deputed  and  fully  involved  in \nM&E  10  points;  partly  involved  5-9  points;  not  deputed/  involved  0  point).     \n \n\n(x) \n\nA TMA must secure 70 points to qualify for a PFC Grant.  Full compliance under (v) to \n16. \n(vii) and a minimum of 5 points each under (i) to (iv) and (ix) to (x) will be mandatory to qualify \nfor a PFC Grant.    \n \n\nReform Implementation Performance Measures (RIPM): \n\n(ii) \n \nThe  RIPM  will  further  strengthen  the  reforms  undertaken  by  TMAs  by  fulfilling  the \n\n17. \neligibility criteria. The performance of the TMAs will be evaluated and measured as follows: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n(vii) \n\nthe \n\ntwenty-five  percent  (25%)  of \n\nEffective  functioning  of  complaints  cells  (number  of  staff  recruited  and  facilities \nprovided,  number  of  complaints  registered  and  addressed,  efficiency  of \ncomplaints addressed, public feedback on the performance); \nImplementation of actions specified in the PLGO 2001 for transfer of functions to \nUCs; \nTMA  accounts  showing  utilization  of \ndevelopment budget by CCBs; \nImproved public access to information, demonstrated by: (a) posting of approved \nTMA  annual  budget  at  designated  public  places  (TMA  offices,  TMA \nhospital/health  unit,  etc);  (b)  posting  of  listing  of  approved  schemes  and \nimplementation  schedules  at  TMA  offices,  and  (c)  posting  within  one  month  of \nthe  close  of  any  quarter,  a  statement  of  accounts/expenditures  for  each  sub-\nproject at TMA offices; \ncompletion  and  publication  of  the  results  of  the  user  survey;  implementation  of \nthe action plan on financial reforms; and implementation of the tariff plan; \nCompletion of the revenue enhancement base-line survey etc; and \nImplementation  of  budget  rules  in  accordance  with  PLGO  2001  on  detailing \narrears.  \n\n \n18. \nTMAs will be evaluated on a sliding scale of one (1) to five (5), with 5 representing 100% \nperformance by a TMA within a specific category. A total of 25 points, with minimum 3 points in \neach category, will be considered satisfactory to qualify for a PFC Grant.   \n \n19. \nPG  will  suspend  disbursements  to  an  ongoing  subproject  and  reallocate  funds  of  the \nPFC Grant to the Investment Pool should a TMA fail to score 70 points in IPPM and 25 points in \nRIPM. To meet the criteria specified in the Performance Measures, PCO will assist the TMA in \nresolving  the  issues  affecting  the  implementation  progress  of  the  subproject  and  will  facilitate \ncontinuing  compliance  with  the  required  actions  under  the  eligibility  criteria.

The incidence of poverty \nin Pakistan has risen slowly but steadily during the 1990s, from 29.3% in 1993\u20131994 to 32.2% in 1998\u20131999. \nPoverty in urban area is estimated as 22.4%. Only 63% of the country\u2019s population has access to safe drinking \nwater (83% in urban areas, and 53% in rural areas). Proper sanitation facilities are available to only 39% of the \npopulation (59% in urban areas, and 27% in rural areas). Poor access to water supply and sanitation is often \nassociated with poor health. Consolidated (federal and provincial) expenditures on water supply and sanitation \nhave actually decreased over the past 5 years, both in nominal terms and as a percentage of gross domestic \nproduct  (GDP).  Consolidated  public  expenditures  on  water  supply  and  sanitation  (public  health  engineering) \nhave  come  down  from  Rs6.3  billion  in  1995\u20131996  (0.30%  of  GDP)  to  Rs4.5  billion  in  2000\u20132001 (0.13% of \nGDP). As a result, extension of public water supply and sanitation facilities has not kept pace with the growing \nneeds of the rising population. \n\nPoverty incidence also varies significantly among provinces. Punjab province has the second-highest incidence \nof  poverty,  after  North  West  Frontier  province,  in  both  rural  and  urban  areas.  Within  Punjab,  poverty  differs \nconsiderably  from  south  to  north.  The  level  of  economic  development  and  income  in  southern  Punjab  is \ngenerally lower than in northern Punjab, where a great deal of development efforts and investments, especially \nindustrial  investments,  have  been  concentrated  in  recent  years.  Urban  areas  of  northern  Punjab  have  the \ncountry\u2019s lowest poverty level (13%), but urban poverty in southern Punjab is the highest in Pakistan (35% in \nFY1999,  up  from  28%  in  1993).  Poverty  in  southern  Punjab  is  largely  caused  by  limitations  to  growth  of  the \nagricultural sector, which is in turn related to an increasing shortage of irrigation water. This rural poverty spills \nover  into  the  towns  and  cities,  where  more  than  half  of  the  populations  are  often  classified  as  poor,  suffering \nfrom a lack of employment, low household incomes, and lack of basic services.  \n\nThe  Poverty  Partnership  Agreement  between  the  Government  of  Pakistan  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) reflects Government\u2019s vision for poverty reduction and key priorities of the ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and \nProgram. ADB\u2019s country strategy for Pakistan emphasizes water supply, sanitation and urban development, and \nthe need to target the poor to reduce both poverty and inequalities. The Government has agreed that long-term \npoverty reduction requires sharper focus on good governance, allocation for social sectors, and improving basic \nsocial  services  to  enhance  human  development.  The  Poverty  Partnership  Agreement  als o  focuses  on \nattainment of the millennium development goals (MDGs). ADB aims to help the Government make devolution a \nsuccess and improve service delivery and municipal services, with particular focus on services for the poor.   \n\nThe  Project  will  foster  institutional  development  of  the  local  government\u2019s  tehsil  (subdistrict)  municipal \nadministrations (TMAs) in Punjab, and will finance infrastructure improvements in 21 project towns that focus on \nwater  supply,  sewerage  and  wastewater  management,  solid  waste  management,  slaughterhouses,  and \nprograms on hygiene and environmental awareness. The Project aims to improve living conditions and health \nstatus  of  the  people  in  project  towns.  Access  to  safe  drinking  water,  improved  sanitation,  and  improved \nenvironmental  quality  will  reduce  vulnerability  to  environmental  hazards  for  the  poor  communities.  Improved \nquantity  and  quality  of  domestic  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities  will  reduce  morbidity  and  mortality, \nespecially  for  young  children.    The  availability  of  safe  drinking  water  supplies  will  reduce  water-carrying time, \nwhich will benefit mainly women and girls. A better environment in the urban areas will improve the quality of life \nand  productive  capacity  of  the  residents,  many  of  whom  are  poor.  Improved  ins titutional  capacity  of  local \ngovernment  will  provide  opportunities  for  effective  local  planning,  improved  institution  and  financial \nmanagement, and collaboration between local people and local government officials to ensure sustainability of \nurban services  infrastructure in small towns.        \n\nB. \n\nPoverty Analysis  \n\n \n\nProposed Classification: Poverty intervention \n\nUntil  recently,  Punjab\u2019s  economy  was  based  largely  on  agriculture,  but  growth  prospects  for  agriculture  are \nlimited,  largely  because  of  the  restricted  availability  of  water  suitable  for  irrigation.  Thus,  the  province  is \ndeveloping into a more urban economy with high-income inequalities and entrenched poverty with slums and \nsquatter settlements, and urban environmental degradation. The main factors that contribute to the rapid rise in \nurban populations are migration from rural to urban areas and extension of municipal boundaries. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n44\n\nAppendix 11 \n\nA socioeconomic survey in the project towns indicated that 57% of the sample households live on a monthly \nincome  of  less  than  Rs5,000  ($85),  which  is  about  the  current  poverty  line.  The  highest  percentage  of  poor \nhouseholds  among  the  sample  households  (66%)  is  in  Bahawalpur,  followed  by  61%  in  Jatoi,  Jahanian, \nKhanewal,  Qadirpur  Ran,  and  Shujabad.  Most  of  the  poor  are  employed  as  casual  laborers,  but  the  second-\nlargest  group  is  unemployed.  Urban  poverty  in  the  project  towns  is  multifaceted,  ranging  from  a  lack  of \nemployment  to  deficiencies  in  basic  urban  services  such  as  water,  sewerage,  and  solid  waste  disposal,  to \nsubstandard housing. \n\nA  socioeconomic  survey  in  22  prospective  project  towns  showed  that  about  92%  of  the  sample  households \nhave access to piped water, and 8% use public standpipes. But the water supply is intermittent, and delivery is \nmostly  less  than  50 liters/person  per  day.  Also,  the  water  quality  often  falls  below  the  standards  of  the  World \nHealth  Organization  for  drinking  water,  mainly  because  of  bacteriological  contamination  as  a  result  of  poor \nsanitation  facilities  and,  in  some  locations,  because  of  salinity.  About  84%  of  the  sample  households  have \ntoilets inside their houses, while 16% must defecate in open spaces such as along river banks or drainage or \nirrigation canals, or in empty plots. \n\nThe coverage of sewerage systems, which are often combined with storm water drainage systems, in the urban \nareas  is  limited.  Final  treatment  of  sewage  is  inadequate  in  all  project  towns.  Only  25%  of  the  sample \nhouseholds have access to adequate sewerage systems. The other households suffer from various degree of \nenvironmental pollution in their neighborhoods, through the disposal of wastewater in open drains, and flooding \nof such wastewater in the residential neighborhoods. There is no wastewater treatment plant in the project area, \nand raw sewage is disposed in irrigation channels or open fields.  \n\nThe  combined  shortage  of  quality  water  and  inadequate  sewerage  adversely  affects  public  health  and  urban \nenvironments.  The  lack  of  adequate  water  supply  facilities  and  sewerage  systems  is  a  particular  burden  on \nwomen  because  women  are  mainly  responsible  for  water  collection,  for  family  health  maintenance,  and  for \ncaring for sick family.  \n\nThe  Project  will  provide  water  to  poor  communities  through  piped  distribution  systems  and  communal  water \npoints.  The  component  for  sanitation  and  was tewater  management  will  provide  expanded  sewerage  pipe \nnetworks to low-income areas, along with simple wastewater treatment plants. The systems will be designed to \ngive the urban poor adequate access to improved sanitation. Expected benefits are public hygiene and health \nimprovement in low-income areas, and reduced pollution of groundwater and surface water in the project towns. \nImproved public health will contribute to a more productive labor force. Employment generation in civil works will \nbe another direct positive contribution of the Project to poverty reduction. Improved solid waste management \nand recycling, preferably with private sector involvement, will also create employment for the urban poor. Use of \ntreated effluent for irrigation will improve agricultural production and income for poor farmers.  \n\nThe Project will also ensure that poor households of low-caste communities have access to basic services and \nresources. Some households of a religious minority whose members work as municipal sweepers live in areas \nthat lack water supply and sanitation facilities more than in other project towns. The Project will address their \nneeds through (i) provision of public water stand posts in their neighborhoods; (ii) improving access to sewerage \nsystems;  (iii)  at  least  30%  employment  of  women  in  the  community-based  program  for  solid  waste \nmanagement; (iv) participation of women and men community leaders in the users\u2019 groups; (v) participation of \nwomen  and  men  in  environmental  awareness,  health,  and  hygiene  campaigns; and (vi) employment of labor \nfrom this  community in civil works. \n\nC. \n\nParticipation Process \n\nStakeholder Analysis?                                  Yes \n\nParticipation Strategy Required?                  Yes \n\nThe investment component of the Project was discussed with various stakeholders.  \n\nTo strengthen community participation in local level governance, the Project will take the following measures: (i) \nCommunity-level  committees  will  be  formed  to  undertake  the  construction  of  lane  level  sewers.  These \ncommittees  will  include  both  men  and  women,  and  local  ward  councilors.  (ii)  Representation  from  low-caste \ncommunities and ethnic minority groups will serve on committees for planning of project activities.  \n\nNongovernment organizations and community-based organizations, as well as women\u2019s groups, will participate \nin  implementing  the  solid  waste  management  component.  Community-level  committees  will  be  formed  to \nconduct awareness campaigns for solid waste management. \n\n\f          Appendix 11 \n\n45\n\nD. \n\nGender and Development \n\nStrategies to maximize impacts on women. \n\nGender issues will be addressed in the project components in the following ways:  \n\nLocal government. Involvement of women councilors in municipal activities is minimal. The Project will facilitate \nstrengthening of the role of women councilors in municipal governance through (i) capacity building and training \non  the  role  and  responsibility  of  women,  and  planning  of  development  activities  that  involve  them;  (ii) training \nworkshops on gender sensitization for men and women councilors from union councils (UCs); (iii) representation \nof women councilors on ward and community planning committee; (iv)  representation of women in various user \ngroups, such as committees for lane level sewerage management and solid waste management.  \n\nCommunity-level project activities.  (i) NGOs and CBOs will form women groups in wards and neighborhoods \nfor social mobilization activities. (ii) Women will be represented in the planning of infrastructure and facilities for \nwater, sanitation, and basic urban services. (iii) Preference will go to the allocation of land for low-income housing \nfor  widows  and  deserted  or  divorced  women  from  poor  households.  (iv)  A  percentage  of  land  for  low-income \nhousing  will  be  allocated  to  women  from  poor  households,  based  on  an  assessment  during  project \nimplementation. (v) Employment opportunities in civil works will be made available to interested women from poor \nhouseholds. (vi) Women\u2019s groups will be represented in the management of new facilities. (vii) Women will be the \nprimary  target  for  public  health  and  hygiene  campaigns.  (viii)  Women  community  volunteers  will  be  trained  for \nhealth and hygiene campaigns.  \n\nTraining activities.  Training activities for local government institutions will include women officials. Community \ntraining and mobilization campaigns for project beneficiaries will ensure active participation of women.  \n\nThe  Project  will  ensure  that  representatives  of  low  castes  and  poor  women  participate  in  user  groups,  social \nmobilization  and  campaign  activities,  access  to  basic  urban services and allocation of land and shelter. Thirty \npercent of the community-based solid waste management employment will be reserved for women from the low-\nincome Christian communities.    \n\nAt  east  one  professional  in  the  project  coordination  office  will be female.

The  analysis \ndescribes the economic rationale and target beneficiaries, and compares the \u201cwithout project\u201d and \n\u201cwith  project\u201d  situations.  Economic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRRs)  were  prepared  for  sewerage \nsubprojects in 18 towns, for water supply subprojects in 7 towns, for slaughterhouses in 12 towns, \nfor  solid  waste  management  in  21  towns,  and  for  upgrading  of  access  roads  in  low-income \ncommunities in 13 towns.  \n\nThe  analysis  compares  the  calculated  EIRR  to  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital \n2. \n(EOCC), which is assumed to be 12%.24 Standard and project-specific sensitivity tests were also \nconducted  to  assess  robustness  of  the  EIRR  calculation.  The  economic  analysis  uses  the \ndomestic  price  numeraire  because  benefits  are  nontradable.  Financial  costs  are  converted  to \neconomic  costs.  For  this  purpose,  tradable  and  nontradable  goods  are  split.  In  practice,  this \nmeans  using  foreign  costs,  including  any  indirect  foreign  costs,  as  tradables and local costs as \nnontradables. Taxes and duties are excluded.25 The shadow exchange rate factor (SERF) is used \nto convert tradables to domestic prices.26 All costs and benefits are at constant 2003 prices [???] \nand  on  incremental  bases.  Price  contingencies  are  excluded  from  economic  costs,  but  include \nphysical  contingencies.  The  capital  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  are based on \nthe  design  capacity  requirements  until  2025.  Replacement  cost  for  pumping  and  equipment \nequivalent to 10% of total capital cost is assumed every 10 years.27   \n\n3. \nThe  economic  evaluation  considered  willingness  to  pay  for  improved  municipal  services, \ndetermined on the basis of a socioeconomic survey of households and community consultations. \nThe surveys showed a low willingness to pay,28 compared with the affordability levels of both the \npoor and non-poor households. That apparently reflects the potential beneficiaries\u2019 doubts about \nthe capacity of tehsil municipal administrations (TMAs) to deliver effective urban services. Once \nthe subprojects are completed and effectively managed by tehsils (subdistricts), it is expected that \npeople will be willing to pay more for improved services and to sustain project benefits.  \n\nB. \n\nSewerage Improvement Subprojects \n\n4. \n The  sewerage  improvement  subprojects  will  be  implemented  across  low-income \ncommunities  and  katchi  abadis  on  a  town-wide  basis  with  low  service  coverage  levels.  The \nsubprojects  will  reduce  the  incidence  of  ponding  and  divert  domestic  wastewater  to  suitable \ndisposal sites in 18 towns. It was reported that in most parts of project towns, wastewater that has \nbeen  improperly  disposed  into  blocked  drains  and  sewers  may  have  contaminated  water  tables \n\n                                                 \n24  ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects, Manila.  \n25 For this project, local taxes are excluded at a rate of 15% percent plus import duties.   \n26 SERF is calculated to be 1.2, based on the weighted average tariff of 20% (Punjab Statistics Office). Tradables or \nforeign costs are in the civil works subproject for water supply (10% of the project water supply cost). For equipment \nand materials, tradables comprise 31% for water supply equipment cost, 67% for sewerage equipment, and 22% for \nsolid waste management. \n\n27  A  residual  value  equivalent  to  30%  of  project  costs  is  assumed  in  year  20  to  take  into  account  the  remaining \n\neconomic life of civil works and pipelines.   \n\n28 The FGD results indicate that willingness to pay ranges from Rs20 to Rs80 in low-income communities for sewerage, \nRs10 to Rs30 for water,  and Rs5 to Rs10 for solid waste management. The participants indicated that these fees \ncan  be  tripled  for  middle-  and  high-income  households.  In  Multan  and  Bahawalpur,  where  quantitative  surveys \ninclude WTP, the respondents indicate WTPs of Rs50 to Rs100 per household. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                      Appendix 12      47 \n\nand  caused  the  spread  of  diseases,  increased  pest  incidence,  odors,  and  other  problems \n(reported by an average of 71% of households).29   \n\n5. \nSewerage lines and storm water drainage subprojects involve rehabilitating and upgrading \nexisting  sewers  and  drains,  construction  of  new  sewer  lines  to  establish  an  interconnected \nnetwork with suitable outflow, and sewerage treatment. \n\n6. \nFor  the  sewerage  components,  benefits  accrue  to  (i)  households  that  will  be  provided \nsewerage services, (ii) those who will use the treated wastewater such as the farmers in lieu of or \nin addition to other irrigation water, and (iii) the Government in terms of avoiding damage to public \nproperty such as roads by eliminating water pondage.30 Benefits to households are measured in \nterms  of  their  WILLINGNESS  TO  PAY  for  the  service,  and  incorporates  their  perceptions  of  the \nvalue  of  improved  services  in  terms  of  avoidance  of  diseases  caused  by  ponding,  both  outside \nand inside the homes; avoidance of damage to private property; and enhanced property value.  \n\n7. \nFarmers  now  obtain  untreated  wastewater  from  disposal  stations  for  use  in  growing \nvegetables, bamboo, and grass for animals. Farmers save about PRs5,000 per hectare yearly on \nfertilizer cost of by using untreated wastewater. Also, there is now a shortage of irrigation water. \nFarmers\u2019 groups indicated their willingness to use treated wastewater from the Project. Benefits to \nfarmers  who  will  use  treated  wastewater  will  be  assessed  in  terms  of  their  WILLINGNESS TO \nPAY,  which  is  about  PRs1,200  to  PRs2,000  per  acre  yearly.  Other  benefits  from  treating \nwastewater  are  avoidance  of  disease  incidence  among  farming  households.  Use  of  treated \nwastewater  will  decrease  the  Irrigation  Department\u2019s  annual  cost  of  desilting  irrigation  canals, \nestimated to be PRs1.7 million in Multan; 60% to70% of the desilting cost is caused by disposal of \nuntreated wastewater. \n\nC. \n\nWater Supply Subprojects \n\n8. \nThe Project focuses on a secure and sustainable supply of good quality potable water to \nurban low-income communities in seven project towns, and generally comprises communal water \nsystems, communal water transportation, distribution systems, tubewells, transmission lines, and \nreservoirs. Access to clean, safe, and reliable water supply systems will particularly benefit urban \nlow-income  communities,  and  small  businesses  and  institutions  in  the  entire  project  area. 31 \nSpecific service delivery targets for water supply and water quality are based on consultation with \ntehsils and communities.  \n\n9. \nFor water supply components, the major economic benefits comprise (i) cost savings on \nthe  nonincremental  supply  to  connected  and  nonconnected  households,  and  (ii)  willingness  to \npay, based on average demand price for incremental water supplies. Nonincremental benefits for \nconnected  and  nonconnected  households  are  quantified  using  the  resource  cost  savings \napproach for (i) use of alternative water sources, (ii) time and cost savings for water collection, (iii) \nnontechnical  losses,  and  (iv)  savings  in  health  expenditures  due  to  water  contamination  by \narsenic  and  salinity.  Incremental  benefits  are  valued  using  WILLINGNESS  TO  PAY.  Values  for \n\n                                                 \n29  WTP  of  lower-income  households,  which  range  from  Rs20  to  Rs50  per  month,  and  of  relatively  higher  income \nhouseholds, which range from Rs50 to Rs100, is lower than the affordability levels, which were computed at 3% to \n5% of monthly income. The WTP is about 50% of the affordability levels in both low- and high-income classes.  \n\n30 Benefits that were not quantified include savings of local governments in costs of maintenance and reconstruction of \nroads  and  public  buildings.  Improvement  will  also  enable  the  tehsils  to  raise  property  taxes  because  of  increased \nproperty  values  and  improved  willingness  of  households  to  pay,  thus  increasing  the  efficiency  of  tax  collection. \nImproved  sanitary  and  environmental  conditions  will  also  reduce  public  health  expenditures  for  low-income \npopulations for waterborne, respiratory and vectorborne diseases.  \n\n31  New property connections to be installed in unserved low-income areas will help meet demands for rapidly growing \npopulations  (2.6%  pa  in  Multan,  5.1%  in  Bahawalpur,  and  higher  than  3.3%  in  the  other  towns). In Multan, bulk, \nzonal, and individual property metering will be introduced. \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\npotable  water  consumption  are  based  on  the  cost  of  potable  water  for  a  minimum  drinking \nrequirement  for  the  average  5%  to  10%  of  the  middle-income  group  among  the  nonconnected \nhouseholds.  \n\n10. \nTime savings and willingness to pay for water collection by nonconnected households are \nbased  on  the  social  survey.  Health  benefits  are  calculated  based  on  the  avoided  costs  of \ntreatment.  Official  health  statistics  were  used  to  help  calculate  the  impact  of  water  supply \nimprovements on waterborne disease incidence,32 and interviews with medical personnel in local \nhospitals for costs of medical treatment.33  \n\nD. \n\nSolid Waste \n\n11. \nThe  Project  will  focus  on  the  development  of  landfill  sites  in  towns  that  have  no  landfill \nfacilities, the purchase of equipment for use in garbage collection and disposal, and incinerators \nfor  disposal  of  hospital  wastes.  The  towns  now  have  systems  for  garbage  collection  from \nhouseholds, but only about 60% of garbage generated is actually collected. The remaining 40% of \nuncollected garbage finds its way into storm drains and sewer lines, clogging them and eventually \ncausing  high  flooding  incidence.34  The  major  economic  benefit  identified  for  the  Project  is  the \nresidents\u2019  willingness  to  pay  for  clean  and  efficient  collection  and  disposal  of  their  waste.  The \nsocioeconomic  survey  conducted  in  each  town  showed  that  75%  to  85%  of  total  residents \nexpressed  a  willingness  to  pay  of  from  PRs20  to  PRs50  for  low-income  households,  to  from \nPRs50 to PRs100 for high-income households.  \n\nE. \n\nRoad Links \n\n12. \nThe proposed road links are to improve access of low-income residents to the education, \nhealth, and livelihood opportunities in the town centers. All of the current road links, mostly narrow \nlanes,  are  in  poor  condition  with  low  vehicular  traffic  volume.  Improvement  of  the  road  links  is \nexpected to enhance economic activity in low-income areas, resulting in improved land values. \n\n13. \nBenefits identified include increased land values and savings in vehicle operating costs for \nlow-volume  traffic.35  The  increase  in  land  values  was  used  to  estimate  the  benefits  of  the \nimproved roads. It was assumed that about 100 meters on each side  of the roads will be affected \ndirectly, but land value will actually increase, because of enhanced pedestrian mobility pedestrian \nand  increased  nonmotorized  traffic,  in  only  20%  of  the  affected  area.  The  increased  economic \nactivity  will  be  through  the  proliferation  of  commercial  activity  along  the  road.  Because  these \nroads  lead  to  low-income  communities,  the  increase  in  land  values  was  assumed  to  be  1% \nthroughout the evaluation period.  \n\nF. \n\nSlaughterhouses \n\n14. \nThe  existing  slaughterhouses  in  the  towns  are  either  in  poor  condition  with  obsolete \nfacilities,  or  are  in  residential  areas  and  thus,  nuisances  because  of  odors  and  health  risks  to \nresidents. Furthermore, unsanitary practices in the slaughterhouses pose a health hazard to the \nmeat-consuming public. For these reasons, it was proposed that new slaughterhouse facilities be \n\n                                                 \n32 The morbidity rate caus ed by waterborne diseases in Pakistan is about 9%, according to data from the World Health \n\nOrganization.  \n\n33  Interviews  with  medical  personnel  in  private  clinics  and  hospitals  in  Multan  indicate  that  treatment  costs  of \nwaterborne diseases range from Rs1,200  to Rs6,400 per case. Treatment costs, which average about Rps 2,000 per \ncase, include transport to clinics or hospitals, doctors\u2019 fees, medicine, laboratorwork, and use of hospital beds. \n\n34  Benefits  from  avoidance  of  flood  damage  were  not  included  because  of  a  lack  of  data  on  flood  damage  costs  to \npublic  and  private  infrastructures,  the  extent  of  areas  flooded,  and  the  frequency  and  duration  of  flooding  in  each   \ntown. \n\n35  Vehicle  operating  cost  savings  are  negligible  in  most  cases  because  mostly  smaller,  nonmotorized,  and  few \n\nmotorized, vehicles pass through these narrow lanes. Most traffic is donkey carts, bicycles, and motorcycles. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                      Appendix 12      49 \n\nbuilt  outside  of  nine  towns,  away  from  residential  areas.  Existing  slaughterhouses  will  be \nrehabilitated in three towns. \n\n15. \nFor  the  economic  evaluation,  it  was  assumed  that  about  20%  of  the  households  will \nsomehow be affected and that at least one member of each of those households will become sick \nat  least  1  day  in  a  year  because  of  eating  spoiled  meat  from  animals  slaughtered  in  the  existing \nfacilities.36  Furthermore,  it  was  assumed  that  each  person  who  becomes  ill  will  spend  about \nPRs150 on medical expenses.37 For slaughterhouses that will be relocated from the town center, \ntravel  costs  might  increase  for  bringing  animals  to  the  new  sites.  But  according  to  the  TMAs, \nbecause the new sites will be where animal populations are highest, that increase will be negated \nby decreased transport costs for animals that are raised nearer to the proposed sites.  It is highly \nprobable that environmental benefits from improved sanitary conditions may not  be fully reflected \nin  reduced  health  costs.  Therefore,  subprojects  that  have  lower  EIRRs,  but  where  unquantifiable \nenvironmental benefits comprise the major benefits, may warrant acceptance.   \n\nG. \n\nResults \n\n16. \nFor the evaluated subprojects, base case EIRRs exceed the EOCC, which is assumed to \nbe  12%.  Standard  sensitivity  tests  were  conducted  for  a  10%  increase  in  capital  and  operating \ncosts and a 10% reduction in subproject benefits, and a worst-case scenario of a combined 10% \ndecrease in benefits and 10% increase in costs. Additional project-specific sensitivity cases have \nbeen undertaken to determine the impact of changes in key variables on subproject viability and \ninclude:  (i)  a  1-year  delay  in  project  benefits,  20%  decrease  in  willingness  to  pay,  and  20% \ndecline in number of households served due to lower operational efficiencies for subprojects for \nsewerage, water supply, and solid waste management; (ii) for slaughterhouses, a 20% decrease \nin households affected by meat spoilage; and (iii) for road links, a 20% decrease in area affected \nand  a  15%  decrease  in  assumed  land  values.  Some  subprojects  in  smaller  towns  became \nmarginally  feasible  under  the  worst-case  scenario  and  worst-case  sensitivity  tests  on  key \nvariables. Resulting EIRRs are most sensitive to  decline in project benefits. Switching values and \nsensitivity indicators were likewise calculated and are presented in Table A12.1 to Table A12.5. 38 \nSupplementary  Appendix  G  presents  a  more  detailed  economic  evaluation  of  each  subproject, \nand results of the distribution analysis for each town.  \n\nH. \n\nOther Project Benefits \n\n17. \nSuccessful  implementation  of  subprojects  in  each  town  will  improve  public  health  and \nsafety,  community  relations,  safety  of  pedestrians  and  children,  and  living  conditions  of  urban \npoor  in  low-income communities. Successful implementation will reduce maintenance costs and \ntravel time for workers. Furthermore, the capability building and training component will upgrade \nthe  management  and  financial  capacity  of  TMAs,  and  enhance  cost  recovery  of  municipal \nservices through improved collection efficiency and better willingness to pay of users. The Project \nwill  support  urban  poverty  reduction  through  its  direct  impact  on  employment  and  income-\ngenerating  opportunities.39  A  summary  of  unquantifiable  economic,  social,  and  environmental \n\n                                                 \n36  No  data  are  available  on  the  incidence  of  sickness  among  residents  living  near  the  slaughterhouses,  or  on  meat \n\neaters as a result of unsanitary practices and obsolete facilities. \n\n37 In smaller towns, medical expenses increase with travel costs to and from local clinics and hospitals. \n38 The higher the sensitivity index, the more sensitive the net present value is to the concerned variable. The lower the \n\nswitching value, the more sensitive the net present value is to the change in the variable. \n\n39  Improvements  to  the  slaughterhouse,  solid  waste  management,  sewerage  and  water  supply  system  will  provide \ndirect  employment.  Temporary  employment  for  both  skilled  and  unskilled  labor  will  also  be  provided  in  the  project \narea during construction, operation, and maintenance of project facilities. Although the community at large will benefit \nfrom basic services improvements, a positive distributional effect to the urban poor is also expected. For example, a \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nbenefits  that  will  accrue  to  the  project  area  from  the  implementation  of  major  components  of \nsewerage, water supply, and solid waste management is shown below. \n\nSummary Of Unquantifiable Economic, Social, And Environmental Benefits \n\nBenefits \nHealth and Environmental Benefits \n\nSewerage \n \n\nWater Supply \n \n\nSolid Waste \n \n\nImproved school attendance \n\nImproved health and hygiene standards  \n\nImproved road safety and reduction in road \n\nImproved safety to sanitary workers  \nImproved quality of life \n\n  Reduced waterborne diseases  \n  Decreased  incidence  of  skin  and  vectorborne \n  diseases  \n  Reduced fly and mosquito breeding                          \n  Reduced incidence of respiratory diseases  \n  Reduced illness and time off from work \n \n  Savings in medical costs  \n \n  Pollution reduction \n \n  Accidents \n \n \nInfrastructural and Financial Benefits \n \n \n  and facilities  \n \nImproved commercial activities  \n  Enhanced land/property values \n \n \n  collection  efficiency through \n  computerized billing and collection \n  Reduced operations and maintenance costs  \n  Reduced damage to public property \n  Reduced damage to crops and livestock \n  Reduced  road  maintenance  costs  due  to  reduced \n  ponding \n  Reduced vehicle operating costs \n  Expanded land use and availability \nSocial Benefits \n\nIncreased tehsil revenues  \nIncreased tax and user charges  \n\nImproved cost recovery of services  \n\nImproved social cohesiveness \nImproved community relations  \n\n \n \n  Reduced social and economic dislocation  \n\nHigh \nHigh \n \nHigh \nHigh \nMedium \nMedium \nMedium \nHigh \nHigh \nHigh \n \nHigh \nHigh \n \n \nMedium \n \nHigh \nHigh \nHigh \n \n \nHigh \nHigh \nHigh \nHigh \nHigh \nHigh \n\n \n\n \n\nHigh \nHigh \nHigh \n\nHigh \nHigh \n \n \n \nHigh \nHigh \nHigh \nHigh \nHigh \n \n \n \nHigh \n \n \nMedium            \n \nHigh \nHigh \nHigh \n \n \n \nHigh \nHigh \n \n \n \nHigh \n\n \n\nHigh \n\nMedium \nHigh \n \nHigh \nHigh \nMedium \nMedium \nMedium \nMedium \nHigh \n \n \n \nHigh \n \n \nHigh \n \nHigh \nHigh \nHigh \n \n \nHigh \nHigh \n \nMedium \n \n \nHigh \n\n \n \n\nSource: ADB. 2001.

The  impact  of  the  Project  on  poverty  will \nvary  with  individual  components,  and  the  way  the  TMAs  execute  them.  Most  subproject \ncomponents will directly benefit the poor, and indirectly benefit the entire urban population of the \nTMAs concerned. \n\n19. \n The total urban population in the 21 project towns eligible to participate in the Project is \nestimated  at  about  15  million.  The  total  potential  beneficiaries  will  be  about  3.6  million  people. \n                                                                                                                                                                \nlarge proportion of the employment created by the Project will be in low-skills jobs, which can be done by the urban \npoor. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                      Appendix 12      51 \n\nPrimary beneficiaries of the environmental improvements will be women, children, the elderly, and \nthe  urban  poor  in  low-income communities because most are in underdeveloped areas that are \naffected by ponding and  flooding. Commercial establishments will also benefit because drainage \nand sewerage improvements enhance business properties and other infrastructure.   \n\nBased  on  the  infrastructure  demand  revealed  by  the  21  tehsils,  and  surveys  of  and \n20. \nconsultation  with  low-income  communities,  the  distribution  of  infrastructure  investment  in  the \nproject  area  is  estimated  to  be  (i)  about  18%  of  overall  investment  for  road  links  and  municipal \nservices  for  low-income  areas;  (ii)  about  21%  for  sewerage  links  in  low-income  areas, (ii) about \n19%  for  water  supply,  (iii)  about  5%  for  solid  waste  management,  (iv)  about  1%  for \nslaughterhouses,  and (v) the remainder for project management, incremental land development, \nand other municipal services.  \n\nBased on assessment of the subprojects, low-skilled laborers will need to be for 40\u201350% \n21. \nof the civil works construction. The Project is estimated to generate a minimum of 8,500 person-\nmonths  of  employment  for  the  poor.  Considering  the  distribution  of  physical  investment  across \nsubsec tors, the Project is estimated to provide (i) better sewerage facilities and services for more \nthan 1.5 million poor people, (ii) improved water supply and affordable water systems for at least \n1  million  poor  people,  (iii)  improved  solid  waste  collection  for  about  1.2  million  urban  poor,  (iv) \nimproved roads and accessibility for at least 1 million urban poor people in low-income areas, and \n(v) other public facilities and services to raise the living standards of poor people. \n\nJ. \n\nConclusion \n\n22. \nThe  Project  components  are  economically  viable  and  are  robust  to  adverse  cost  and \nbenefit  scenarios.  The  calculated  EIRRs  are  expected  to  be  lower  than  the  true  EIRR  since  the \neconomic, social, and environmental implications of not undertaking the Project are severe, and \nwould worsen conditions for the urban poor in the subproject areas.  \n \n\n \n\n\f5\n2\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n2\n \n\ni\n\nTable A 12.1 Economic Analysis Sewerage Improvement \n\nTown \n\nEIRR \nBase Case\n\n10% increase \nin cost \n\n10% \nDec. in \nrevenues \n\n+10% in costs  \n-10% in \nrevenues \n\nEIRR's Sensitivity Analysis  \n\nDelay in \n\nDecrease \n\nDecrease \n\nSensitivity Indicator \n\nSwitching Value  \n\nBenefits  \n\nin WTP \n\nin 20% \n\n1 year  \n\n-20% \n\nof HH served \n\nSI1 \n\nSI2 \n\nSW1 \n\nSW2 \n\nBahawalpur \n\nKhaipur Tamewali \n\nYazman \n\nDera Ghazi Khan \n\nTaunsa Sharif  \n\nJahanian \n\nKabirwala \n\nKhanewal \n\nMian Channu \n\nQadirpur Ran \n\nShujabad \n\nJalalpur Pirwala \n\nAlipur \n\nJatoi \n\nKot Addu \n\nJampur \n\nRajanpur \n\nRohjan \n\nMultan \n\nOverall \n\n19.6 \n\n16.5 \n\n35.5 \n\n16.5 \n\n22.9 \n\n13.0 \n\n22.6 \n\n13.8 \n\n20.5 \n\n16.9 \n\n21.9 \n\n14.1 \n\n21.1 \n\n18.8 \n\n15.3 \n\n28.2 \n\n24.5 \n\n15.3 \n\n31.7 \n\n37.6 \n\n17.6 \n\n14.8 \n\n32.1 \n\n14.5 \n\n20.6 \n\n11.6 \n\n20.5 \n\n12.2 \n\n18.3 \n\n15.1 \n\n20.1 \n\n12.6 \n\n19.0 \n\n16.9 \n\n13.7 \n\n25.2 \n\n22.1 \n\n13.7 \n\n28.6 \n\n33.4 \n\n17.4 \n\n14.6 \n\n31.7 \n\n14.3 \n\n20.4 \n\n11.4 \n\n20.3 \n\n12.0 \n\n18.1 \n\n14.9 \n\n19.9 \n\n12.4 \n\n18.7 \n\n16.7 \n\n13.5 \n\n24.9 \n\n21.8 \n\n13.5 \n\n28.3 \n\n33.0 \n\n15.7 \n\n13.1 \n\n28.7 \n\n12.6 \n\n18.4 \n\n10.1 \n\n18.4 \n\n10.5 \n\n16.1 \n\n13.2 \n\n18.4 \n\n11.0 \n\n16.8 \n\n14.9 \n\n12.0 \n\n22.3 \n\n19.7 \n\n12.0 \n\n25.6 \n\n29.4 \n\n16.4 \n\n14.0 \n\n27.4 \n\n13.7 \n\n18.8 \n\n11.2 \n\n18.8 \n\n11.7 \n\n16.9 \n\n14.2 \n\n18.1 \n\n12.1 \n\n17.4 \n\n15.8 \n\n13.0 \n\n22.2 \n\n20.0 \n\n13.1 \n\n24.9 \n\n26.5 \n\n15.4 \n\n13.5 \n\n30.2 \n\n12.4 \n\n18.9 \n\n11.2 \n\n19.7 \n\n10.6 \n\n16.4 \n\n14.1 \n\n19.1 \n\n11.9 \n\n18.5 \n\n16.5 \n\n11.9 \n\n23.6 \n\n21.1 \n\n13.9 \n\n20.8 \n\n32.0 \n\n17.4 \n\n15.0 \n\n32.5 \n\n13.9 \n\n20.0 \n\n12.0 \n\n21.0 \n\n12.0 \n\n18.0 \n\n15.0 \n\n20.0 \n\n13.0 \n\n20.0 \n\n18.0 \n\n13.0 \n\n26.0 \n\n22.0 \n\n15.0 \n\n26.0 \n\n32.0 \n\n14.5 \n\n15.5 \n\nSI3 \n\n2.7 \n\n3.3 \n\n1.1 \n\n3.7 \n\n1.4 \n\n7.2 \n\n1.1 \n\n7.0 \n\n1.9 \n\n2.3 \n\n1.2 \n\n4.2 \n\n1.1 \n\n1.3 \n\n4.2 \n\n1.1 \n\n1.4 \n\n1.7 \n\n2.2 \n\n0.6 \n\n55.0 \n\n31.3 \n\n180.4 \n\n26.6 \n\n77.9 \n\n6.9 \n\n80.5 \n\n11.2 \n\n55.1 \n\n31.4 \n\n106.8 \n\n14.3 \n\n61.0 \n\n46.3 \n\n22.4 \n\n107.5 \n\n88.4 \n\n22.4 \n\n138.7 \n\n168.7 \n\nSW3 \n\n36.7 \n\n30.2 \n\n94.6 \n\n27.3 \n\n69.4 \n\n13.9 \n\n90.1 \n\n14.2 \n\n52.4 \n\n43.6 \n\n83.6 \n\n23.6 \n\n88.7 \n\n74.8 \n\n24.0 \n\n94.9 \n\n74.0 \n\n57.6 \n\n44.8 \n\n35.5 \n\n23.9 \n\n64.3 \n\n21.0 \n\n43.8 \n\n6.5 \n\n44.6 \n\n10.1 \n\n35.5 \n\n23.9 \n\n51.7 \n\n12.5 \n\n37.9 \n\n31.6 \n\n18.3 \n\n51.8 \n\n46.9 \n\n18.3 \n\n58.1 \n\n62.8  164.4 \n\n2.8 \n\n4.2 \n\n1.6 \n\n4.8 \n\n2.3 \n\n2.2 \n\n9.9 \n\n2.8 \n\n4.2 \n\n1.9 \n\n8.0 \n\n2.6 \n\n3.2 \n\n5.5 \n\n1.9 \n\n2.1 \n\n5.5 \n\n1.7 \n\n1.6 \n\n1.8 \n\n3.2 \n\n0.6 \n\n3.8 \n\n1.3 \n\n1.2 \n\n8.9 \n\n1.8 \n\n3.2 \n\n0.9 \n\n7.0 \n\n1.6 \n\n2.2 \n\n4.5 \n\n0.9 \n\n1.1 \n\n4.5 \n\n0.7 \n\n0.6 \n\nEIRR = Economic Internal rate of Return, HH = Household, WTP = Willingness-to-pay  \n\nNote: SI1 - on 10% increase in cost; SI2 - on 10% decrease in revenues; SW1 - on 10% increase in cos t; SW2 - on 10% decrease in revenues \n\nSource: ADB. 2001.

To assess the Project\u2019s sustainability, the overall performance of the \noperating  enterprise\u2014the  tehsil  municipal  administrations  (TMAs)  in  all  cities  and  the  Multan Water \nand Sanitation Authority\u2014were also reviewed. Projected income and expenditure statements and cash \nflows were prepared with \u201cwithout Project\u201d and \u201cwith Project\u201d scenarios.  FIRRs were calculated over a \n25 years period. Residual value has been assumed in the last year and FIRRs computed on after tax \nbasis.  \n\n1. \n\nFinancial Internal Rates of Returns \n\n3. \nThe FIRRs were calculated for solid waste management subprojects in 21 cities, water supply \nsubprojects in 6 cities, slaughterhouse subprojects in 12 cities, and, incremental land development at \nMian Channu. These were compared with the WACC (weighted average cost of capital) of 5%.1 The \nfinancial  viabilities  of  the  proposed  subprojects  were  assessed  from  the  perspective  of  operating \nentities, rather than the economy as a whole.  \n\nAll  subproject  revenues  and  costs  are  in  constant  2003  prices  and  on  an  incremental  basis. \n4. \nInvestment  costs  are  derived  from  estimated  costs  less  interest  during  construction.  Revenue \nestimates  are  based  on  user  charges  that  consumers  now  pay,  and  their  willingness  to  pay  for \nimproved  services  based  on  socioeconomic  survey  results  and  community  consultations.  Survey \nresults indicated a low willingness to pay, relative to affordability levels, which reflect the beneficiaries\u2019 \nperception  of  the  lack  of  capability  of  TMAs  for  effective  service  delivery.  The  collection  efficiency  of \nuser fees is assumed to be low during the initial years of project implementation, and will increase to \nabout  95%  with \nimplementation  of \nrecommendations  made  in  the  technical  assistance  (TA),  especially  a  modern  billing  and  collection \nsystem. Standard sensitivity tests were undertaken to assess the robustness of the FIRR calculation. \n\nimproved  service  delivery.  But \n\nis  mainly  due \n\nthat \n\nto \n\n2. \n\nSolid Waste Management  \n\nEstimates  of  capital  costs  for  solid  waste  management  subprojects  are  based  on  planned \n5. \ninvestments  for  equipment,  transport  vehicles,  land  for  landfills,  civil  works,  and  incinerators  for \nhospitals. Capital cost, operations and maintenance (O&M), and replacement costs are based on 2003 \nprices.  Other  assumptions  are:  (i)  Salaries  of  incremental  staff  were  included.2 (ii) Incremental O&M \nexpenses  are  5%  of  the  component  cost  (excluding  land),  while  diesel  and  O&M  of  vehicles  are \nassumed to be 15% of the vehicle cost. (iii) Incinerator expenditure is at 30% of its cost. (iv) Additional \nvehicles will be procured during the second and fifth years of the implementation period. (v) Vehicles \nwill be replaced every 10 years.  (vii) The residual value of vehicles, based on remaining life at the end \nof the implementation period, will be treated as cash inflow. \n\n6. \nAverage  user  charges  per  household  (based  on  survey  results  for  willingness  to  pay)  were \nestimated  at  PRs15  per  month  and  have  been  increased  by  10%  per  annum  until  2009\u20132010. After \n\n                                                 \n1 The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is 5%, based on funding arrangements and respective weights. \n2  Staff  include  those  working  on  collection  and  disposal  of  solid  wastes,  such  as  those  working  with  tractors  with  bucket \nloaders at landfills, or with tractors for container carriers and transfer trailers. Staff include drivers and sanitary workers at \nsites such as landfills, transfer stations, and container carriers. \n\n \n\n\f          Appendix 13 \n\n57\n\nthat date, a nominal 3% increase per annum is assumed to cover O&M expenditures for the subproject \non  solid  waste  management.  The  rates  are  within  the  affordability  and  willingness  to  pay  of \nhouseholds, which is about PRs15 to PRs50 per household monthly. Population projections are based \non  the  1998  census.  Household  size  ranges  from  6.3  persons  in  Qadirpur  to  8.4  persons  in  Jatoi. \nCollection  efficiency  of  user  charges  is  set  at  80%  of  households  in  the  first  3  years  of  project \nimplementation, then increases to 95% in succeeding years.  \n\nStandard sensitivity tests were used to assess the robustness of the FIRR calculations. Table \n\n7. \nA13.1 shows results of FIRR calculation and sensitivity analysis for each town. \n8. \nFinancial  projections  using  the  cost  and  revenue  assumptions  indicate  that  operation  of  the \nsolid  waste  management  subproject  in  each  town  is  financially  viable.  Specifically,  cash  flows \ngenerated  by  the  Project  are  sufficient  to  meet  all  operating  cost  requirements.  Full  cost  recovery  is \nachieved,  with  resulting  FIRRs  higher  than  WACC,  or  5%  rate  of  return.  The  FIRRs  of  solid  waste \nmanagement  subprojects  on  base  cost  ranges  from  11%  at  Taunsa  Sharif  to  55%  at  Jahanian.  The \nincremental costs of the sub-project will be quite low as compared to the incremental revenues which \nresult in these comparatively high FIRRs.Sensitivity results indicate that the FIRR is sensitive to 10% \ndecrease  in  revenues  and  to  the  cumulative  effect  of  lower  revenues  and  increased  costs  under  the \nworst-case scenario. \n\n3. \n\nWater Supply \n\n9. \nWater supply subprojects comprise: water source development (tubewells and pumps), water \ntransportation and communal water points (at Rohjan), transmission mains and distribution systems, \nand storage. To recover costs of the water supply facilities and services, monthly user tariffs, based on \nflat fees per household and commercial customer, are applied, and connection charges are levied on \nnew  connections.  The  setting  of  water  tariffs  took  affordability  into  account,  and  assumed  that \noperating  entities  such  as  the  Water  and  Sanitation  Authority  (WASA)  in  Multan  and  TMAs  in  the \nproject towns may maintain positive cash flows from operations over the forecast period and thus, may \nadhere to full cost recovery.3  \n\n10.  Water fees are assumed to increase by 5% per annum to cover water supply expenses such as \ninflation, O&M, equipment and building depreciation, and replacement of equipment. In Multan, water \nrates  will  be  revised  in  2004-2005,  then  again  in  2010\u20132011  for  an  overall  increase  of  about 45%. \nIncreases will be about 5% per annum afterward. O&M costs include expenditures for salaries, power, \nchemicals,  spare  parts,  and  miscellaneous  expenses.  Only  incremental  revenues  and  O&M \nexpenditures were included in calculating the FIRRs. \n\n11. \nThe  rate  of  return  for  the  water  supply  project  was  assumed  to  be  5%\u2014equal to WACC. All \nsubprojects  are  financially  viable,  based  on  cost  and  revenue  assumptions.  Full  cost  recovery  is \nachieved with resulting FIRRs above WACC for all the towns.4 FIRR base cases range [???] from 6% \nat  Bahawalpur  to  33%  at  Jalalpur  Pirwala.  Table  A13.2  shows  results  of  FIRR  calculations  and \nsensitivity analysis for each town.  \n\n                                                 \n3 The average water fee used in these calculations was Rs40 per household connection in Taunsa, Rs75 in Jalalpur Pirwala, \nand Rs100 in Bahawalpur, Hasilpur, and D.G. Khan. These amounts are within the willingness to pay of Rs120 to Rs150 \nper household monthly, and within the affordability levels of low-income households, at 3% to 5% of their monthly income.40 \nMultan has an elaborate water tariff system, with house connections rates of Rs36 to Rs250 per month (depending on lot \nsize); commercial rates from Rs182 to Rs525 per month, depending on pipe [size; and industrial water rates from Rs500 to \nRs12,000  per  month,  depending  on  consumption.  The  potential  populations  to  be  served  in  the  project  towns  are \nestimated,  in  2003,  as  1,390,000  people  in  Multan,  41,383  people  in  Jalalpur,  48,235  in  Taunsa,  228,983  in  D.G.  Khan, \n89,847 in Hasilpur, and 481,749 Bahawalpur. Consumption averages 120 liters per capita daily. \n\n4 Neither the FIRR nor a sensitivity analysis was calculated for Rohjan because the entire water supply project is for supply by \nwater tanker to central points, where citizens can collect drinking water. No additional house connections are envisaged. \nThe  citizens  welcome  the  provision  of  potable  water.  Many  other  positive  externalities  and  socioeconomic  benefits  have \nbeen considered in the Economic Analysis of the Project. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f58\n\n4. \n\n \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nSlaughterhouses5 \n\n12.   Estimates  of  capital  costs  for  slaughterhouse  subprojects  are  based  on  planned  investments \nfor  civil  works  and  land  for  new  slaughterhouses,  or  for  rehabilitation  of  others.  Capital  costs,  O&M, \nand replacement costs are based on 2003 prices. Other assumptions include:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nThe  off-take  of  large  and  small  animals,  and  per-capita  meat  consumption  (mutton  and \nbeef),  were  taken  from  the  World  Bank  Livestock  Sector  study,6  although  figures  are  far \nlower than those of the Economic Survey of Pakistan.  \nPart-time salaries for veterinary officers and incremental staff have been added.  \nSlaughter fee range from PRs10 for small animal to PRs20 for large animals.7 \nAnnual increases in slaughter fees will be 5% from FY2004\u20132005 to FY 2009\u20132010, then \n3% afterward, in line with inflation. \nThe collection efficiency of slaughter fees will be100% after project implementation.  \n\n13. \nAll  subprojects  are  considered  financially  viable,  based  on  cost  and  revenue  assumptions. \nComputed net revenues and the FIRR for the base case compare favorably with the WACC. The FIRR \nbase case ranges from 5% at Qadirpur Rawan to 30% at Jampur. Table A13.3 shows the sensitivity \nscenarios and the FIRR under various scenarios.8 \n\n5. \n\nIncremental Land Development \n\n14. \nThis component is being implemented at Mian Channu. The FIRR calculation took into account \nthe net cash flows in real after tax terms. The FIRR is 7%, which is higher than the WACC. But a lower \nreturn is justified, because this basically aims at providing incrementally developed plots at cost plus \nservice charges. The experience of SKAA was used in working out income and expenditure patterns. \nDevelopment  expenditures  for  residential  plots  are  subsidized  by  slightly  higher  service  charges  for \ncommercial plots.  \n\nFor sensitivity analysis, scenarios considered included (I) an increased capital cost of 5% (the \n15. \ncomponent\u2019s main cost  is  land,  which  will  be  provided  by  the  TMAs,  and  the  latest  land  prices  were \nconsidered  in  Project  costs);  (ii)  a  10%  decrease  in  revenues;  and,  (iii)  a  cumulative  effect  of  5% \nincreased capital costs and 10% decreased revenues. The FIRR is sensitive to decrease in revenue, \nand reduces to 3%, or lower than WACC. The total investment in this subproject is less than 0.15% of \nthe total project cost. In addition to the socioeconomic benefits, the subproject will serve as a pilot for \nincremental urban development for low-income communities. \n\nB. \n\nFinancial Projections for the TMAs \n\n16. \nIn  addition  to  financial  analysis  of  subprojects,  the  financial  sustainability  of  the  TMAs  was \nassessed. Budgets, actual revenues, and expenditure accounts, as well as taxation schedules of the \nTMAs and WASA Multan, were reviewed.9 Most TMA income is based on intergovernmental transfers \nthat  are  projected  based  on  existing  awards  by  the  Provincial  Finance  Commission.  Projections  of \nTMA revenue and expenditures, with and without the proposed projects, have been undertaken, based \non assumptions that proposed expenditures for the proposed interventions have included: (i) the urban \nimmovable property tax obtained from the Punjab government\u2019s excise and taxation staff at the district \n\n                                                 \n5  Sensitivity  analysis  shows  that  the  FIRR  of  the  water  supply  component  in  Multan  is  sensitive  to  a  10%  decrease  in \nrevenues, or a 10% increase in O&M expenditure, and is lower than the WACC. The FIRR is indeed more sensitive to the \ncumulative effect of two variables at a time, as in d and f. The FIRR at Bahawalpur is lower than WACC in scenario g. \n\n6 Consumption of 7.0 kg of beef, and 4.5 kg of mutton, per person yearly. \n7 Assumes 1 large animal to be 150 kg, and a small animal to be 16 kg. \n8 It is apparent from the sensitivity analysis that the FIRR of the slaughterhouse component at  Yazman is sensitive to 10% \ndecrease in revenue, and that of Qadirpur Rawan is sensitive to a 10% increase in O&M expenditure and to a 1-year delay \nin  receipt  of  project  benefits.  The  FIRR  is  lower  than  WACC  in  these  cases.  The  FIRR  is,  indeed,  more  sensitive to the \ncumulative effect of two simultaneous [variables as in d and f. \n\n9 Meetings were held with: the tehsil officer (finance) and the tehsil officer (regulations), who are responsible for taxation, of \ntowns  being  reviewed;  the  chief  officer,  who  is  res ponsible  for  O&M  of  municipal  services;  and,  tax  inspectors,  rent \ninspectors,  and  licensing  inspectors.  Information  was  obtained  from  PG  for  property  taxes  (collection,  deductions,  and \ndisbursement to TMAs); and on district excise and taxation officers (responsible for levy and collection of property taxes, \nwhich will be TMA\u2019s main revenue source in the future. \n\n \n\n\f          Appendix 13 \n\n59\n\nand  provincial  finance  levels;  (ii)  the  tax  on  transfer  of  immovable  properties  (TOTP),  with  actual \nrevenue  collection  as  the  base  for  TOTP100, (iii)  intergovernmental  transfers;11  and  (iv)  expenditures \nunder the \u201cwith project\u201d cash flow projections, incremental  salaries, and O&M expenditures (including \nfor repairs and utilities). Cash flow projections show that the TMAs will have sufficient cash to meet all \nexpenditures. \n\nThe  financial  performance  of  TMAs  is  expected  to  improve  as  a  result  of  the  Project\u2019s \n17. \ninstitutional  development  and  capacity  building  components.  Recommendations  to  improve  revenue \ncollection from user charges include (i) surveys to locate illegal connections, (ii) regularization of illegal \nconnections,  (iii)  creation  and  updating  of  consumer  databases,  (iv)  improvements  in  billing  and \ncollection, (v) improvements in recovery of arrears, (vii) calculation of unit costs of service provision, \n(viii)  display  of  unit  costs  to  improve  transparency,  and  (ix)  improvement  in  budgeting,  records,  and \nmonitoring of O&M expenditures, to reduce costs and wastage. \n\nDelay of one year \nin project \nbenefits  \n\nTable A13.1 Results of Financial Analysis \nSolid Waste Management Subprojects in Project Towns \n\nSensitivity Analysis  \n\n \n \nTown \n\n \nFIRR \n \nOn Base \nCost \n\nDecrease in \nRevenues \nby 10% \n\nIncrease \nin Project \nCost by \n10% \nB \n27 \n24 \n14 \n\nIncrease in base \ncost and \ndecrease in \nrevenues by 10% \nD = B and C \n22 \n21 \n11 \n\nIncrease in \nO&M \nExpenditure \nby 10% \nE \n27 \n25 \n13 \n\nDecrease in \nrevenues and \nincrease in O&M \nby 10% \nF = C and E \n22 \n22 \n10 \n\nG \n24 \n23 \n13 \n\nC \n24 \n23 \n12 \n\nA \n30 \n26 \n15 \n\n \nBahawalpur \nHasilpur \nKhairpur \nTamewali \n16 \nYazman \n24 \nAhmadpur East \n20 \nMian Channu \n19 \nKhanewal \n16 \nKabirwala \n46 \nJahanian \n34 \nQadirpur Ran \n24 \nShujabad \n30 \nJalalpur Pirwala \n28 \nKot Addu \n20 \nAlipur \n28 \nJatoi \n21 \nD G Khan \n9 \nTaunsa \n22 \nRajanpur \n32 \nJampur \n25 \nRojhan \n9 \n Multan  \nSource: ADB. 2001.

The  rates  for  levy  of  stamp  and  registration  fees  is  fixed  or  revised  by \ndistrict revenue authorities every 3 years. TOTP projections have been increased by 25% in the fifth year to give the effect \nof this increase in property value . (The actual increase is usually much higher than this 25%).  \n\n11  (i)  All  grants  for  salary  and  nonsalary  expenditures  for  staff  of  the  decentralized  departments   will  be  used  for  TMA \noperations, and not for TMA headquarters in urban areas. But this separation of expenditures is not required by the Multan \nCity  TMA,  because  this  separation  of  expenditures  was  not  required,  as  tehsil  and  city  areas  are,  effectively,  one \ngeographical area.  (ii)  Development  grants  received  by  TMA  are  allocated  on  a  per-capita  basis  to populations of TMA \nheadquarters in urban areas . The actual 2002\u20132003 development grant that TMA received was taken as the base, with a \n10%  yearly  increase.  (iii)  The  actual  amount  that  TMAs  received  as  an  Octroi  Compensatory  Grant  in  2002\u20132003 is \nconsidered the baseline, and a yearly increase of 10% is assumed. That share will continue to decrease, and may become \nnil after 5 years.  Instead of these three there may be one grant (share of the TMA in provincial revenues is decided by the \nPFC). But because the Octroi Compensatory Grant compensates for revenue source of the defunct ULC (which provides \ndirect income for the TMA urban area headquarters), it is shown separately in the financial projections.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n60\n\nAppendix 13 \n\nTable A13.2 Results of Financial Analysis \nWater Supply Subprojects in Project Towns \n\nSensitivity Analysis  \n\n \n \nTown \n\n \nFIRR \n \nOn Base \nCost \n\nA \n\nIncrease \nin Project \nCost by \n10% \nB \n\nDecrease in \nRevenues \nby 10% \n\nC \n\nIncrease in base \ncost and \ndecrease in \nrevenues by 10% \nD = B and C \n\nIncrease in \nO&M \nExpenditure \nby 10% \nE \n\nDecrease in \nrevenues and \nincrease in O&M \nby 10% \nF = C and E \n\nDelay of one year \nin project \nbenefits  \n\n6 \n18 \n33 \n16 \n24 \n8 \n\nBahawalpur \nHasilpur \nJalalpur Pirwala \nDGKhan \nTaunsa \nMultan \nFIRR = financial internal rate of return, O&M = operation and maintenance. \n \n\n5 \n16 \n30 \n14 \n21 \n3 \n\n5 \n17 \n31 \n15 \n23 \n7 \n\n5 \n17 \n32 \n15 \n23 \n4 \n\n4 \n15 \n28 \n13 \n20 \n3 \n\nTable A13.3.
