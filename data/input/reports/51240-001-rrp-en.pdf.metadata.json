Uzbekistan  is  one  of  Central  Asia\u2019s  fastest-growing \neconomies.  The  nation\u2019s  primary  economic  driver  is  Tashkent  province,  the  largest  urban \nagglomeration  and most  economically  advanced  region. The  province  is endowed  with  natural \nresources  and  vibrant  industries  and  generates  almost  25%  of  the  nation\u2019s  gross  domestic \nproduct. 3  Instrumental  to  the  province\u2019s  future  growth  is  the  continued  development  of  its \nsouthwestern  economic  corridor,  which  extends  along  primary  road  and  rail  arteries  that  link \nTashkent  city  with  towns  and  cities  to  the  southwest.  The  project\u2019s  two  contiguous  districts  of \nYangiyul  and  Chinaz,  located  20\u201360  kilometers  (km)  to  the  southwest  of  Tashkent  city,  are \nintegral districts within this corridor.4 \n\n4. \nDespite its strong economic growth potential, the province suffers from pervasive urban \nservice limitations, primarily in water supply and sanitation (WSS). Much of its Soviet-era WSS \ninfrastructure has deteriorated, resulting in unreliable services, high leakages and non-revenue \nwater, and elevated pollution risks. Over time, many WSS utilities became almost bankrupt, with \nobsolete  and  non-functional  assets,  unsustainable  modes  of  operation,  and  limited  capacity  to \nattract investment.  \n\nReform  initiatives.  Historically,  sector  deficiencies  included  a  fragmented  regulatory \n5. \nframework, limited sector planning, acute funding constraints, ineffective regulatory compliance, \nand a virtually absent private sector. With ADB assistance, the government has responded by \nreorganizing WSS sector institutions, and implementing sector-wide management, financial, and \ncost recovery reforms. Since 2000, ADB has provided over $500 million of funding for improving \nwater and sanitation services. Commencing in 2015, and driven by the Decree of the Cabinet of \nMinisters 306, the first reform phase focused on regulatory reforms and institutional consolidation, \nincluding  the  reorganization  of  provincial  WSS  utilities,  known  as  suvokovas  (state  unitary \nenterprises),  and  the  absorption  of  individual  city  and  district  water  companies  into  them. 5 \nSuvokovas  are  implementing  extensive  time-bound  corporate  governance  enhancements  to \nstrengthen utility capacity. A second reform phase, initiated in 2017, is overhauling the wider WSS \n                                                 \n1   A  very  small  area  of  Zangiota  comprised  five  settlements  along  the  administrative  border  between  Zangiota  and \nYangiyul is also included. These five settlements receive water supply from the water service network of Yangiyul. \n\n2  ADB. 2018. Country Operations Business Plan: Uzbekistan, 2019-2021. Manila.  \n3  Tashkent Province\u2019s population (excluding Tashkent city) is estimated to be 2.829 million. City Population (accessed \n\n18 January 2019). \n\n4  The population of Yangiyul is about 259,000 and that of Chinaz is about 129,000. \n5  Government  of  Uzbekistan.  2015.  Decree  of  the  Cabinet  of  Ministers  of  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan                               \n\n\u201cOn Implementation of Main Directives of Development of Water Supply and Sanitation Organizations.\u201d Decree of \nthe Cabinet of Ministers No. 306. Tashkent. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\finstitutional framework. A new ministry, the Ministry of Housing and Communal Services (MHCS) \nwas established in 2017, and is responsible for WSS sector policy formulation, coordination, and \nimplementation.  MHCS  manages  government  policy  and  coordination  for  WSS  and  other \ncommunal services. The Communal Services Agency (CSA) reports to the MHCS and supervises \nADB-funded  and  other  externally-funded  projects.  Other  national  agencies  have  also  been \ninstituted during this phase.6 A third reform phase is envisaged to create an enabling environment \nfor public\u2013private partnership (PPP) arrangements in the sector.7 \n\n6. \nThese  reforms  are  yielding  substantial  improvements  in Tashkent  province  through the \noperationalization and capacity strengthening of the Tashkent Provincial Suvokova (TPS), which \nis  responsible  for  all  provincial  WSS  services.  Since  its  reorganization  in  2016,  the  TPS  has \nimplemented  key  reforms  such  as,  completed  district  branch  inventories,  consolidated  smaller \nwater  supply  systems,  strengthened  public  accountability,  modernized  management  systems, \nexpanded  its  consumer  base,  increased  tariffs,  and  recruited  personnel.  The  ADB-funded  first \nTashkent  Province  Water  Supply  Development  Project  (TPWSDP)  is  assisting  the  TPS  to                    \n(i) revitalize the water supply systems of Kibray and Zangiota districts, located to the northeast of \nand  contiguous  with  Yangiyul  and  Chinaz  districts;  and  (ii)  improve  the  TPS\u2019s  financial  and \noperational  managements. 8  Under  close  supervision  and  monitoring  of  CSA,  its  financial \nperformance continues to improve as the project progresses.9 In recent years, the World Bank, \nthe Islamic Development Bank, Arab Coordination Group, Swiss State Secretariat for Economic \nAffairs, and Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation have also been working in the WSS \nsector in other regions of Uzbekistan. \n\n7. \nPriority needs. There are two priority WSS sector needs in Tashkent province: (i) expand \nthe  water  supply  network  of  Yangiyul  and  Chinaz  districts;  and  (ii)  provide  additional  capacity \nsupport to further strengthen the TPS to improve efficient management and to adopt innovative \ntechnologies. Water supply improvements in these two districts are critical because only about \n20% of inhabitants in the proposed project area currently receive municipal water supplies, while \nthe 80% unserved are forced to purchase expensive trucked water, or to obtain unsafe water from \nwells  and  irrigation  canals. Water  scarcity  causes  public  health risks  and  constrains  economic \ngrowth.10 Institutional constraints primarily relate to capacity limitations in corporate management, \nfinancial and asset management, and WSS system operations. Currently, only major cities and \nurban centers in Tashkent Province have centralized wastewater systems. The project supports \nthe government in rural sanitation development by introducing a pilot program for decentralized \nwastewater systems. \n\n8. \nProposed  project.  Complementing  the  first  project  (footnote  8),  the  project  will \nrehabilitate and expand the VU-1 regional water supply system, delivering safe potable water to \n220,000 inhabitants of the project area.11 In addition, the project will extend capacity support to \n                                                 \n6  In 2017, the State Committee for Investments (SCI) and the National Agency for Project Management (NAPM) were \n\ninstituted to monitor and control WSS sector investments.  \n\n7  Government of Uzbekistan. 2018.

Manila. \n\n9 Since the reorganization, the TPS\u2019s net sales have increased at a faster rate (averaging 23% per annum) than its \noperating costs (averaging 20.4% per annum). Its financial performance culminated in 2017 with a current ratio of \n2.71, days in receivables of 84, an operating ratio of nearly 1, and a debt\u2013equity ratio of 1.45. \n\n10 Ministry of Health data indicates that water-related diseases, including dysentery and viral hepatitis, account for more \n\nthan half of infectious disease incidence, with women and children being most vulnerable. \n\n11 The existing Soviet era VU-1 regional water supply system covers the four districts of Kibray, Zangiota, Yangiyul and \nChinaz. The first TPWSDP rehabilitates and expands the coverage in Kibray and Zangiota. The proposed second \nproject  will  rehabilitate  and  expand  the  coverage  for  Yangiyul  and  Chinaz  districts,  and  five  settlements  of  the \nadjacent Zangiota district. The term \u201cVU-1\u201d is the locally recognized name of the existing system. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nfurther  increase  TPS  efficiency  and  sustainability.  It  will  do  so  by  incorporating  (i)  a  corporate \ndevelopment  and  capacity  building  program,  targeting  improvements  in  asset  and  financial \nmanagement,  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M),  procurement,  public  accountability,  internal \nauditing, and human resource management; (ii) a sanitation and hygiene improvement program; \nand (iii) strengthening of geographic information system (GIS) and hydraulic modeling capabilities. \nIt will include a sanitation component and pilot PPP initiatives such as private sector contracting \nof the O&M of water distribution networks and facilities, and retail distribution of water supplies, \nincluding customer service, in selected settlements. The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Water \nOperational Plan, 2011\u2013202012 and Urban Operational Plan 2012\u20132020;13 supports WSS sector \ngovernment  decrees  (footnote  5  and  7);  and  aligns  with  previous  and  ongoing  ADB-assisted \nsector projects contributing to key operational priorities under ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030.14 \n\n9. \nLessons incorporated in the project design from previous ADB sector experience include \n(i) extending the project implementation schedule to accommodate recently adopted government \napproval procedures; (ii) securing timely counterpart support by engaging government agencies \nat an early stage of project preparation; (iii) adding adequate price contingencies in response to \nthe 2017 currency devaluation15 and potential high inflation; and (iv) mitigating suvokova capacity \nconstraints by providing training on financial management, O&M, and customer service support. \n\n10. \n\nValue added by ADB assistance. The following features provide ADB value addition: \n(i) \n\nProject design and innovation. The ADB intervention initiated smart technology \nfeatures,  such  as  installing  (a)  supervisory  control  and  data  acquisition,  and  a \ngeographic information system (GIS) for network management; and (b) meters for \nimproved billing and increased water revenue. \nPublic-private initiative. The project will include a pilot PPP initiative pursuing the \nprivate sector contracting of O&M of water supply facilities in selected settlements. \nClimate  change  resilience.  The  proposed  metering,  prioritization  of  climate-\nresilient materials,16 adoption of advanced technologies,17 and a public awareness \nprogram will significantly improve urban water resilience. The project will enable \nan overall decrease in energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions through \nthe replacement of old pipes and pumps contributing to climate change mitigation. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n11. \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: living standards, health, and economy in \nTashkent  province  improved.  The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:  access  to  reliable, \nsustainable, and affordable water supply services in Chinaz and Yangiyul districts of Tashkent \nprovince improved and expanded.18 \n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nOutput  1:  VU-1  regional  water  supply  system  improved.

The project feasibility study evaluated three water supply development options \nbased on available water resources; investment efficiency; future operational expenditures; and \npotential  environmental,  social,  and  resettlement  impacts. 20 The  average  consolidated  water \ndemand at the 2045 horizon is estimated at 48,000 cubic meters (m3) per day, with a maximum \ndaily  demand  of  60,000  m3  per  day.  The  application  of  advanced  technologies  and  the \nprioritization  of  climate-resilient  materials  are  key  design  features.  Proposed  technologies  are \ncompatible with local conditions. \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nEconomic  analysis.  An  economic  analysis  was  conducted  following  ADB  guidelines21 \n21. \nand derived benefits from (i) incremental water consumption calculated using willingness-to-pay \nand water demand projections as proxies, and (ii) resource cost savings from non-incremental \nwater sales as households switch to piped water from alternative water sources. It also estimated \nthe health benefits from the improved reliability and quality of non-incremental water consumption \nleading to potentially lower incidence of waterborne diseases in the project areas. The resulting \nbase-case  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  14.84%,  exceeding  ADB\u2019s  prescribed  minimum \ndiscount  rate  of  9%  and  confirming  the  project\u2019s  economic  viability.  A  sensitivity  analysis \nundertaken  indicated  that  the  project  will  remain  economically  robust  under  the  following \nscenarios: (i) 10% increase in investment cost, (ii) 10% increase in O&M costs, (iii) 10% decline \nin benefits, (iv) combination of the first three scenarios, and (v) 1-year delay in project benefits. \nThe  sensitivity  analysis  shows  that  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  most  sensitive  to  a \ncombination of an increase in capital cost and a decrease in benefits, and least sensitive to an \nincrease in O&M costs. \n\n22. \nFinancial  analysis.  A  financial  cost\u2013benefit  analysis  was  conducted,  and  the  results \nconfirmed the financial viability of the project. The financial internal rate of return calculated was \n1.32%, which exceeded the estimated weighted average cost of capital of 0.18%. The sensitivity \nanalysis showed that financial viability will be at risk if a 10% increase in capital investments and \nO&M  costs are  combined  simultaneously  with  a 10%  decline  in  tariff  revenues. To generate  a \npositive financial internal rate of return, the analysis assumed under a worst-case scenario that \ntariffs would need to be increased by about 150% in real terms by 2026, increasing thereafter at \n10%  per  year,  except  every  5  years  when  the  rate  increases  by  20%.  Nominally,  this  entails \nincreasing the tariff for residential users from the current rate of SUM475 per m3 to SUM1,188 per \nm3  by  2026. The  assumed  increase  in  tariffs  requires  an  annual  real  rate  of  increase  of  about \n14%, which is higher than the 7% historical average of the real rate of tariff increases in Tashkent \nprovince  since  2016.  ADB  has  discussed  the  proposed  rate  of  increase  with  the  Ministry  of \nFinance and TPS and both have agreed that the rate is reasonable, given the exceptionally high \ndemand for clean and reliable water supply in the project districts and the relatively lower tariff \nincreases  in  Tashkent  region.  The  tariff  would  also  be  affordable  to  the  targeted  household \n\n                                                 \n20 Centralized water supply development options evaluated include (i) the VU-1 well field as a single raw water source; \n(ii) the VU-1 and Chinaz well fields as raw water sources; and (iii) the VU-1, Chinaz, and Almazor well fields as raw \nwater sources. Option (i) has been selected as the least-cost and most beneficial option for the project population. \n\n21 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n\n\f7 \n\nbeneficiaries who have expressed their willingness to pay at least SUM2,500 per m3 for cleaner \nand more reliable water supplies. At present, most of them access clean water through trucks or \nvendors at a higher cost of SUM6,000 per m3. \n\n23. \nTo  ensure  financial  sustainability,  the  government  will  support  TPS\u2019s  debt  servicing, \nincluding  the  foreign  exchange  risk  and  necessary  tariff  reforms. The  Ministry  of  Finance  is \nmandated to review and regulate the tariff increases. Hence, operating loan covenants have been \nformulated and agreed to ensure that TPS\u2019s financial performance is enhanced, enabling TPS to \nuse the ADB loan proceeds effectively and to meet its debt servicing requirements.  The financial \nanalysis indicates that that the projected operating ratios, liquidity indicators and debt servicing \ncoverage ratios of TPS will meet the agreed loan covenants. \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n24. \nThe  TPS  was  established  and  registered  as  a  limited  liability  company  in  2015  and \nbecame a state-owned enterprise in 2016. It is responsible for WSS services in Tashkent province. \nThe overall financial management risk rating of TPS remains substantial, but this is expected to \nbe  reduced  to  moderate  after  sufficient  training  and  experience  has  been  acquired  by  its  staff \nunder the ongoing first project (footnote 8). The substantial financial management risk rating is \nbecause (i) the TPS is in the early stages of implementing its first project, and has relatively limited \nexperience  as  an  implementing  agency  with  financial  management  responsibilities  for  project \nfunds;  and  (ii)  adjustments  are  necessary  to  its  accounting,  budgeting,  auditing,  and  reporting \nsystems  regarding  the  project\u2019s  financial  management.  The  TPS  is  inexperienced  in  the \nmanagement of ADB disbursements and does not have adequate administrative or accounting \nknowledge to manage an advance fund or the statement of expenditure procedures in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n\n25. \nTPS\u2019s  financial  statements  and  reports  require  modifications  to  meet  the  reporting  and \nauditing requirements of the project. Given the substantial risk, the principal mitigation measure \nproposed  is  that  the  CSA,  with  its  prior  experience  in  implementing  large  capital  expenditure \nprojects,  will  continue to  supervise  and guide  the TPS.  Financial management  consultants  will \nalso be available to support the TPS. \n\nOverall procurement-related risks on the project are rated high mainly because of multiple \n26. \nlayers of oversight and approval procedures required by government agencies concerned, and \ninsufficient  procurement  capacity  of  the  TPS  in  multilateral  bank-funded  projects.  CSA  will \ncontinue  to  handle  the  procurement  and  train  the  TPS  staff.  The  TPS\u2019s  project  document \npreparation  and  review  process  is  considered  adequate  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  ADB \nProcurement  Policy  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  project  will  provide  additional \ntraining on ADB procurement procedures to enhance PCU\u2019s procurement capacity. \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n27. \nwith  the  government,  CSA,  and  TPS.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 19). \n\nD. \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n28. \nThe  project  will  have  a  direct  impact  on  the  health,  economic  prospects,  and  living \nconditions of the population of the project area. By 2025, the project will benefit 220,000 residents \nin 79 settlements within the project area, where currently 19% of all households are poor and 14% \nof the households are headed by women. Health benefits will be derived through (i) increased \naccess  to  improved  drinking  water,  (ii)  greater  water  availability  for  personal  hygiene,  (iii) \nimproved sanitation and reduced open defecation, and (iv) better septage management. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n29.  Women  are  primarily  responsible  for  domestic  chores, and the  lack  of  reliable  potable \nwater  supply  increases  this  burden.  In  Chinaz  and  Yangiyul  districts,  women  are  solely \nresponsible for fetching of drinking water in 54% of surveyed households, while Zangiota district, \nwomen are responsible in 26% of surveyed households. On average, water collecting accounts \nfor  2.75  person-days  per  month  in  Chinaz  and  Yangiyul  districts.  About  70%  of  women \nare responsible for  taking  care  of  disabled,  children,  and  sick  family  members,  and 92%  are \nresponsible for  removing  solid  and  liquid  domestic  waste.  Women  working  in  kindergartens, \nschools,  and  hospitals  bear  the  responsibility  to  fetch  water  several  times  a  day  and  to  clean \ntoilets, since most of them do not have functioning sewerage systems. Provision of safe potable \nwater  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  women, and  potentially  allow  them to spend  more  time  in \nmaking  earnings  for  their  living.  It  will  also  positively  impact  the  health  of  all  family  members, \nespecially children and the elderly, resulting in savings on medical expenditures. \n\nThe  project  is  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming. The  gender  action  plan \n30. \nincludes (i) recruitment of a social and gender specialist in the PCU; (ii) sanitation facilities made \navailable  in  10  schools,  3  kindergartens,  and  1  polyclinic  in  the  project  area; (iii)  facilitation  of \nwomen\u2019s  participation  in  all  project-associated  activities;  (iv)  employment  opportunities  for \nwomen;  (v)  training  of  trainers  on  participatory  hygiene  and  sanitation  conducted  (28  trainers, \n30% of them being women); (vi) at least 30% of the project households engaged in the sanitation \nand hygiene awareness campaign primarily targeting women and girls; and (vii) at least 5,500 \nresidents  (50%  of  them  being  women  and  school  girls)  participated  in  sanitation  and  hygiene \npublic awareness campaign.   \n\nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n31. \ncategories are as follows.22 \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\n32. \nEnvironment (category B). Project impacts are expected to be limited in magnitude and \nof short duration, mostly related to the construction and rehabilitation of the groundwater well field, \ndistribution  centers,  transmission  trunks,  and  distribution  networks.  These  impacts  include  the \ngeneration  of  dust,  noise,  hazardous  solid  wastes,  labor  and  public  safety,  temporary  access \nblockages,  traffic  disturbances,  and  construction  material  production  and  transportation. \nMitigation measures to address construction  and  operational  impacts  are  in  the  environmental \nmanagement  plan  (EMP)  that  forms  part  of  the  initial  environmental  examination.  The  initial \nenvironmental  examination  was  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website  on  30  August  2018. Six  public \nconsultation meetings were conducted in the project districts. \n\n33. \nOperation phase environmental impacts include higher water withdrawal of groundwater \nsources  and  increases  in  sewage  compared  with  the  existing  situation.  These  impacts  will  be \nmitigated  through  proper  implementation  of  mitigation  measures  developed  in  the  EMP. \nInstallation of about 4,000 individual wastewater disposal systems is planned in nine settlements \nof Chinaz district. For the remaining of the project area, sewerage improvements will potentially \nbe  included  in  the  next  project  phase.  The  PCU  within  the  CSA  will  be  responsible  for  EMP \nimplementation  to  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  safeguards  requirements  and  national  environmental \nregulations.  PCU  will  assign  one  environmental  and  social  safeguards  specialist  who  will  be \nassisted  by  the  international  environment  specialist  of  the  PMC  in  overseeing  EMP \nimplementation. The TPS will also designate its staff responsible for EMP implementation, in close \ncoordination  with  the  CSA. EMP  implementation  will  be  financed  by  the  project.23 A  grievance \nredress  mechanism (GRM)  to  mitigate  both  environmental  and  social  safeguard  issues  will  be \n\n                                                 \n22 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n23 The costs of mitigation measures and environmental monitoring will be included in the construction contracts, and \n\nthe cost for environmental supervision will be included in the PMC consulting services contract. \n\n\f9 \n\nestablished  after  project  effectivity.  In  addition  to  weekly,  monthly  and  quarterly  reporting,  the \nPMC will assist the PCU to prepare semiannual environmental monitoring reports (EMRs) and a \nfinal EMR (including post-construction environmental audits) for submission to ADB and relevant \ngovernment  authorities.  These  reports  will  be  disclosed  to  the  public  on  the  CSA  website  (in \nUzbek or Russian) and the ADB website (in English). \n\n34. \nInvoluntary  resettlement (category  B). The  project  involuntary  resettlement  impact  is \nconsidered as insignificant in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy and Guidelines.24 There will be no \nphysical displacement of people. The project will require permanent land acquisition of 4 hectares \nof arable lands for construction of new water distribution centers and will temporarily impact 22.6 \nhectares of arable land during the construction of water transmission mains. The project initial \nsocio-economic survey identified 68 affected households, of which 9 with permanent impacts and \n59 with temporary impacts. \n\n35. \nA  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan  (LARP)  has  been  prepared  to  address  all  the \nassociated losses in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and relevant national \nlegislation. The LARP was disclosed on the ADB website on 28 August 2018. Project information \ndisclosure and meaningful consultations with project stakeholders and displaced persons were \nundertaken  during  LARP  preparation,  and  will  continue  throughout  implementation.  When  the \nproject design is finalized, the LARP will be updated in accordance with applicable laws, and ADB \napproval will be obtained prior to any further implementation. All displaced persons will receive \ncompensation in accordance with the LARP provisions. The land required for the project will be \nmade  free  of  encumbrances  in  sections  prior  to  commencement  of  construction.  A  GRM  is  in \nplace  in  accordance  with  the  LARP,  to  assist  affected  persons  in  resolving  grievances  and \ncomplaints.  The  CSA  will  submit  semiannual  safeguards  monitoring  reports  to  ADB  for  review \nand disclosure. The cost to implement the LARP is estimated at $461,259, which includes a 15% \ncontingency. The country has enabling laws for fair compensation and, over the years, the CSA \nhas acquired experience in implementing ADB projects involving involuntary resettlement. \n\nIndigenous peoples (category C). There are no indigenous peoples, as defined in ADB\u2019s \n\n36. \nSafeguard Policy Statement, in the project area. \n\nF. \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \n\n37. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.25 \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nFrequently changing government procedures \nand staffing of the TPS weaken its financial \nmanagement capacity.
