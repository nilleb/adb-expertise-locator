The project area  covers  three\noblasts  (provinces),  Chui,  Jalal-Abad,  and  Osh,  and  includes\nabout 730 villages, with populations ranging from 500 to 20,000\nand  seven  towns  with  20,000  to  80,000  residents.  The  three\nprovinces were selected because they are poor and to maximize\ndevelopment  impact,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has\nother  projects  under  implementation  in  these  provinces.  The\nWorld  Bank and ADB  have  coordinated  closely  during  project\npreparation as the World Bank is preparing a similar project in the\nother provinces. The Project includes 10 core subprojects, which\nwere prepared using participatory approaches. The Project will\nprovide  basic  infrastructure  services,  including  water  supply,\nsanitation, and drainage, to about 1.5 million persons, of whom\napproximately 70 percent are living below the poverty line.\nClassification Primary: Poverty reduction\nSecondary: Human development\nEnvironmental\nAssessment Category B\nAn initial environmental examination was undertaken.\nRationale Inadequate  delivery  of  infrastructure  services,  due  to  fiscal\ndifficulties,  aging  infrastructure,  and  institutional  constraints,  is\ninhibiting both urban and rural communities from accessing basic\ninfrastructure  services  such  as  water  supply,  sanitation,  flood\ncontrol, drainage, and roads. Because these basic infrastructure\nfacilities are often poorly designed and inadequately maintained,\nthey fail to provide urgently needed basic services. The capacity\nof the sector agencies concerned must be developed to enable\nthem to implement subprojects and to undertake operation and\nmaintenance  of  the  constructed  systems.  In  line  with  the\nGovernment\u2019s  policy  to  use  a  decentralized  community\nmanagement approach, the Project will enhance the coverage of\nbasic  infrastructure facilities;  contribute  to  improving  living and\nhealth  conditions,  in  particular  for  the  poor  population;  and\nimprove  the  institutional,  organizational,  and  managerial\ncapabilities of the sector agencies.", "iii\nObjectives and The main objective  of  the  Project  is  to  improve  the  living  and\nScope health  conditions  in  selected  rural  and  urban  communities,  in\nparticular for the poor, by providing  basic  infrastructure  services.\nThe Project consists of two parts: Part A: Physical Infrastructure,\nand  Part  B:  Capacity  Building.  Part  A  consists  of  about  247\nsubprojects:  240  rural  subprojects  covering  730  villages,  and\nseven small towns. The rural subprojects will include rehabilitating\nand upgrading piped water supply systems, sanitation facilities\nincluding  latrines  and  bathhouses,  flood  control  and  drainage\nfacilities, and local roads. The small towns subprojects will include\nrehabilitating  and  extending  piped  water  supply  services,  and\nimproving  sewerage  systems  including  proper  wastewater\ncollection  and  treatment.  Part  B  includes  an  institutional\ndevelopment  program,  a  hygiene  and  sanitation  education\nprogram, and consulting services for project management support.\nCost Estimates The estimated project cost is $45.0 million equivalent, comprising\nforeign exchange costs of $20.9 million and local currency costs\nequivalent to $24.1 million.\nFinancing Plan\n($ million)\nForeign Local\nSource Exchange Currency Total Percent\nA.

INTRODUCTION\n2.  In 1998, the Government requested TA from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to\nprepare  the  Community-Based  Infrastructure  Services  Sector  Project.1  The  TA  was\nimplemented by the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources (MAWR) and completed in\nOctober 1999. The TA supported local capacity building and designed an investment proposal\nfor decentralized development of basic infrastructure services. The TA was divided into two\nphases.  Phase  I  reviewed  the  current  situation  and  proposed  measures  to  strengthen\ninfrastructure development policies, including preparing a community infrastructure services\nsector strategy paper. Under phase II,  the  TA  consultants  worked  with  local and  national\ngovernment  sector  agencies,  and  developed  an  investment  proposal  and  an  institutional\ndevelopment program. The Project has been formulated on the basis of 10 representative core\nsubprojects, 8 rural and 2 urban. The core subprojects were prepared in close consultation with\nthe communities, and detailed analyses, including socioeconomic analysis, were carried out.\nThe  results  were  used to finalize  the  project  scope.  A bottom-up approach,  involving  the\ncommunities in preparing the subprojects, was used to formulate the Project. This report is\nbased on the findings of the Appraisal Mission from 2-16 February 2000 and earlier ADB\nmissions,  and  has  incorporated  feedback  from  the  consultation  with  project  beneficiaries,\nreports  prepared  by  the  TA  consultants,  and  discussions  with  the  national  and  local\ngovernments and international assistance agencies. The project framework is presented in\nAppendix 1.\nIII.  BACKGROUND\nA.  Sector Description\n1.  Economy in Transition\n3.  The Kyrgyz Republic, which became independent in 1991, is undertaking major changes\nto transform its economy from a centrally planned to a market-based system. The economy has\nbeen severely affected by the Russian Federation\u2019s economic crisis, which broke out in August\n1998. Prior to this, the Government had introduced important structural reforms to move from a\ncentrally planned economy to one in which market forces determine resource allocation and the\nproduction  of  goods  and  services.2  The  measures  include  (i)  liberalizing  most  prices,  (ii)\nprivatizing  public  enterprises,  (iii)  implementing  banking  reforms,  (iv)  developing  the  legal\nframework, and (v) reforming social safety nets. Further, the Kyrgyz Republic is the first Central\nAsian republic to (i) become a member of the World Trade Organization, and (ii) successfully\ncomplete an  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)-supported Enhanced Structural  Adjustment\nFacility (ESAF) program.\n                                               \n1  TA No. 3048-KGZ: Community-Based Infrastructure Services Sector Project, for $600,000, approved on 20 July\n1998.\n2  For further discussion of the economy and the reform process, see CER: KGZ 99008: Country Economic Review,\nthe Kyrgyz Republic, 1999; and ADB 1999 Country Assistance Plan (2000-2002), the Kyrgyz Republic. December\n1999.", "2\n4.  The Kyrgyz economy experienced another difficult year in 1999 as the adverse impact of\nthe Russian Federation\u2019s crisis continued to affect the economy. Preliminary data for 1999\nindicate that real gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 3.6 percent, higher than in 1998, owing\nto continued growth in agriculture that counterbalanced the persistent decline in the industry\nsector. Inflation, however, accelerated to about 40 percent by year-end in 1999, more than\ndouble the rate in 1998, largely due to depreciation of the som and increases in grain and flour\nprices. The nominal exchange rate of the som depreciated by about 35 percent against the\ndollar, and real interest rates hovered at about 15 percent towards year-end. During 1999, total\nexternal trade contracted by 25 percent compared with 1998; import decline outpaced export\ngrowth. As a result, in 1999 the external trade deficit was reduced by almost 65 percent, and the\nexternal current account deficit was about 15 percent of GDP as compared with 20 percent in\n1998. By year-end, gross reserves increased to cover about four months worth of imports. The\nfiscal situation continued to be weak in 1999, as reflected by the cash deficit of 11 percent of\nGDP, higher than that of 1998. The Russian Federation\u2019s crisis weakened the banking system\nconsiderably, and in April 1999 it was hit by a major financial fraud that substantially aggravated\nthe situation. As a result, some of the largest banks were closed, with the five most affected\nbanks  representing  about  60  percent  of  the  banking  system  deposits.  These  recent\ndevelopments clearly demonstrate the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s continued interdependence with the\nformer Soviet Union (FSU) and its high vulnerability to external shocks. Structural reforms made\nprogress in some areas such as continued efforts in implementing the comprehensive pension\nreform, initiation of the privatization and restructuring of several large state-owned enterprises\nand continued reform in the health sector. However, progress lagged in other areas including\nenterprise  restructuring  and  further  promotion  of  private  sector  development  including\nenhancing legal and regulatory framework and its implementation.\n5.  The Government made major efforts to reach agreement with the IMF on reviving the\nsecond annual arrangement of the ESAF program which went off track in July 1999 due to\nfailure to meet program targets. A set of prior actions was required and monthly targets towards\nyear-end were set. With these conditions successfully met, the IMF Board approved the Poverty\nReduction and Growth Facility, the successor to the ESAF program on 9 February 2000. Under\nthe new program the Government will strengthen its efforts in macro stabilization and deepen\nstructural reforms. In particular, a significant fiscal adjustment is needed with primary surplus\ntargeted at about 2 percent of GDP and fiscal deficit at about 7.5 percent of GDP for 2000.\nThese  targets  are  ambitious  but  necessary  to  restore  fiscal  balance  and  strengthen\nmacrostability. Monetary policy will continue to be tight in order to contain inflation and further\ndepreciation of the som. A key to restore public confidence in the som and domestic financial\nsystem is the restructuring of the banking sector. Structural weaknesses of the economy which\nunderlined recent economic difficulties must be tackled through persistent structural reforms.\nPrincipally, the efficiency of public sector decision making must be improved. That includes a\nfurther reduction of the state\u2019s role in the economy and promoting private sector development,\nand expediting the process of enterprise restructuring. Complementing these efforts are the civil\nservice reform, the raising of energy tariffs, and a further enhancing of the legal and regulatory\nframework. The process of privatization and restructuring of large state-owned enterprises must\nbe accelerated and external debt management must be improved. Provided there  is  strict\nadherence to these reform measures, the medium-term outlook of the economy is favorable.\nReal GDP is likely to grow at 3-4 percent for the next few years until 2003 when growth\naccelerates to 4-5 percent. Inflation is expected to be cut by half in 2000 and further decline to\nabout 5 percent by end 2003. Budget deficit is expected to decrease to 7.5 percent this year\nand to about 3 percent by 2003. Regarding external balance, with the economic recovery of the\nKyrgyz Republic\u2019s neighboring countries, the current account deficit will be reduced further to\nabout 13 percent of GDP this year and gradually to around 10 percent in 2003.", "3\n2.  Social Aspects\n6.  Prior to the breakup of the FSU, the Kyrgyz Republic enjoyed full employment in the\ncontext of a centrally planned economic system. The ongoing transition to the market economy\nhas resulted in (i) a sharp decline in the active work force engaged in the formal (official\nregistered) economy, (ii) considerable hidden unemployment, (iii) a growing informal sector, and\n(iv) a change in the composition of jobs provided by the economy. Registered unemployment\nwas  3.1 percent  of  the  labor  force  in  1999,  while  the  overall  rate  of  unemployment  and\nunderemployment amounted to over 20 percent. Unemployment among the young and women\nis a particularly serious problem, and is continuing to increase with women accounting for 60\npercent of the unemployed. About 37 percent of these women are under 29 years of age. Real\nwages have fallen significantly.\n7.  The transition has also resulted in increased poverty. The number of people living in\npoverty increased from 51.0 percent of the total population in 1997 to 63.6 percent in 1998, and\nthe level of extreme poverty increased from 14.8 percent in 1997 to 23.0 percent in 1998.3 The\nGovernment estimates that 20 percent of households could not meet basic food needs in 1996;\nin 1999, the percentage rose to 23 percent, or a quarter of the country\u2019s households. The\npercentage of rural poor has increased from nearly 64.5 percent in 1997 to 71.3 percent in\n1998. However, in urban areas the percentage of the poor has increased substantially from 28.5\npercent in 1997 to 50.7 percent in 1998. Poverty is income based, and still mainly found in rural\nareas, where economic activity is limited and community services scarcer. In addition, the\nseverity of poverty has increased in recent years as families deplete their savings and become\nindebted. Geographically, poverty is not evenly distributed between the oblasts (provinces).\nNaryn oblast is the poorest, with 89.1 percent of the population generally poor, and 42.6 percent\nextremely poor. The capital city of Bishkek is the least poor area with 28.9 percent generally\npoor, and 8.5 percent extremely poor, followed by Chui oblast with 37.6 percent generally poor,\nand 3.5 extremely poor. Jalal-Abad oblast has 72.3 percent generally poor, and 29.3 percent\nextremely poor. Osh oblast has 81.2 percent generally poor, and 31.3 percent extremely poor.\n8.  A first assessment of the determinants of poverty identifies major causes as (i) the\ndisruption of economic activity after the breakup of the FSU; (ii) inadequate targeting of social\nexpenditures given the current fiscal constraints; and (iii) governance issues. As in other FSU\ncountries, the Government in the initial years of the transition addressed sector reforms issues\nincluding privatization,  corporate governance, bank  restructuring,  and  social  sector  reform.\nThese reforms were a necessary, but not sufficient, condition of economic recovery. Several\nsectors  need  deepening  of  the  reforms  and  further  assistance.  The  generated  pattern  of\neconomic growth has had a limited impact on poverty. Economic growth was led by capital-\nintensive, foreign investments in mineral extraction, which failed to generate employment on a\ncountrywide basis or to diversify economic activity. As a result of this noninclusive pattern of\ngrowth, the gap between rich and poor has widened, income distribution worsened, and fiscal\ncollections remain insufficient to meet social needs and public consumption, increasing the\nsocial costs of the transition.\n9.  The  major  issues  related  to  poverty  include  limited  access  to  basic  infrastructure\nservices. The access of poor households to basic infrastructure services has deteriorated in\nquantity and quality. Living  standards have fallen  drastically  in  spite of the high  levels  of\neducation, low levels of open unemployment, availability of housing, and kin and community\n                                               \n3\nPoverty is defined as having an income below the general poverty line being Som4,944 per capita per annum in\n1998 (Som4,647 in 1997), and the extreme poverty line being Som2,595 in 1998 (Som2,439 in 1997). 1998\nPoverty in the Kyrgyz Republic, published in November 1999 by the National Statistical Committee of the\nGovernment of the Kyrgyz Republic.", "4\nsupport networks.  Reduced food consumption,  lower  nutritional  value  of  consumed  foods,\nreduced access to health care and medicines, and greater chances of infection, particularly for\nvulnerable groups, indicate a higher incidence of poverty and reduced quality of life. New\ngroups of vulnerable people have emerged: the elderly; pensioners; poor households that are\nunable to undertake farming; and households headed by women, with many young children.\n10.  During the socialist period, women traditionally had an equitable position in society and\nthe state. However, the impact of the transition on women has been negative and more drastic\nthan for men. Women were the first to lose their jobs as they were mostly represented in the\nhealth and education sectors, and have suffered because of the scaling back of social services.\nIn rural areas, women are legally entitled to equal land rights to men as household heads. It is\nimportant to ensure that women continue to have their legal rights to land respected when land\nshares are allotted and registered. Women should not be disadvantaged, but rather have equal\nopportunities to participate in income-earning opportunities. Women are active in the informal\n\u201cbazaar\u201d economy which has often acted as a buffer against abject poverty.\n3. Infrastructure Services\na.  General\n11.  The Kyrgyz Republic is a landlocked, mountainous country comprising approximately\n200,000 square kilometers, with an officially estimated population of 4.9 million people; almost\ntwo thirds live in rural areas.4 Among the structural causes of poverty is the lack of basic\ninfrastructure services.\n12.  Improved basic infrastructure services, in particular water supply, can have wide-ranging\nhealth,  social,  and  economic  benefits.  Sanitation-related  diseases  like  diarrhea,  typhoid,\ninfections, and hepatitis afflict many, particularly in the rural areas. Diarrhea is the main cause of\nneonatal morbidity and the leading illness among children. The incidence of these diseases can\nbe significantly reduced by improving water supply and sanitation services. The most significant\nhealth improvements are usually achieved by improving water supply and sanitation services,\nwhile  improving  personal  and  household  hygiene.  The  benefits  of  water  supply  can  be\nmaximized in underserved rural areas by combining support programs such as hygiene and\nsanitation education. Women and children benefit substantially from improved water supply and\nsanitation services as the physical burden of carrying water can be reduced, and the time and\nenergy saved can be put to more productive use.\n13.  Groundwater is available throughout much of the country and is extracted mainly for the\nsupply of drinking water to urban and rural areas. The safe yield of the groundwater supply is\nestimated at about 10 million cubic meters per day, which is more than three times the current\ntotal extraction of about 3 million cubic meters per day. There are some areas where shallow\ngroundwater is accessible for hand pumps. Groundwater in rural areas is generally of high\nquality, meets national drinking water quality standards, and requires little or no treatment.\nSurface  water  is  generally  of  good  quality,  but  may  require  some  chemical  and  physical\ntreatment in addition to chlorination. In mountainous areas, springs are a good source of water.\n14.  Prior  to  1991,  the  FSU  provided  sufficient  subsidies  to  construct,  rehabilitate,  and\nmaintain infrastructure services throughout the country. Now, the Kyrgyz Republic Government\ndoes not have the financial capability to provide the necessary funds, nor the institutional\n                                               \n4\n1,770 communities are classified as rural with populations ranging from 500 to 20,000 persons. Urban areas\ncomprise (i) 2 primary cities (over 80,000 persons); and (ii) 16 secondary cities or small towns (20,000-80,000\npersons).", "5\narrangements to make the best use of available limited resources; infrastructure in both urban\nand rural areas has fallen into poor repair. Formerly, an estimated 70 percent of rural villages\nhad a safe piped water supply, but the work of the project preparatory TA shows that this has\nfallen to less than 40 percent. In the southern oblasts of Jalal-Abad and Osh, about 75 percent\nof the villages do not have a reliable supply. In some areas, climate and topographical features\nalso dictate a need for flood protection measures to protect the water supply infrastructure.\nFlooding is generally caused by the inadequacy and poor maintenance of drains. Also urban\nwater supply has reached a state of crises. Although urban systems are continuing to operate,\ntheir effectiveness is failing, supplies are interrupted, and very high water losses occur because\nthere have been no new investments and little funds to carry out routine maintenance and\nrepairs.  These  physical  problems  are  compounded  by  low  tariffs  and  poor  collection\nmanagement.\n15.  Until recently, many villages contained banyas (communal bathhouses), which have now\nlargely fallen into disuse, partly due to lack of water supply. As a result skin diseases have\nincreased due to lack of proper cleanliness. There is also no adequate wastewater collection\nsystem in the rural areas or an acceptable level of human waste disposal. There is no formal\ninfrastructure for sanitation; basic pit latrines with no sanitary refinement are used throughout\nrural areas. Some urban areas have operational sewage systems, but these are also falling into\npoor repair due to age and lack of new investment. Other towns use various methods of\nsanitation, and individual properties use dry pit latrines (replaced when full), grey water soak\npits, cesspits, or septic tanks. Several ongoing and proposed projects are focussing on road\ninfrastructure, mostly interstate highways; some include urban areas and parts of the 15,000\nkilometers  of  rural  roads.  However,  there  has  been  no  identifiable  investment  for  road\nrehabilitation within the rural  areas of the former  collective farms.  The  situation  in all  the\nsubsectors is exacerbated by the weak levels of management in the Government enterprises,\nwhich still largely apply central control and supply economy methods. Reconstruction and future\noperation and maintenance (O&M) will depend heavily on efficient and decentralized technical\nand financial management.\n16.  Lack of reliable data makes it difficult to present a precise assessment of water and\nsanitation service levels and quality. However, only about 27 percent of the population is served\nby  house  water  and  sanitation  connections.  About  40  percent  receive  water  from  public\nstandpipes or water tankers. About one third have no public water service at all.  Service\ncoverage is highest in Bishkek at about 80 percent, although the influx of rural migrants has\nreduced coverage significantly. Service coverage drops off considerably in the small towns and\nis very low for the village segment. Reportedly, about 70 percent of the estimated 1,770 villages\nhave no functioning water system at all. In the southern oblasts of Jalal-Abad and Osh, only\nabout a quarter of the villages have operable water systems. Most of the groundwater pumping\nsystems, disinfection facilities, and standpipes are currently nonfunctioning.\n17.  Only about 20 percent of the population have access to a water sewer system; Bishkek\nhas about 60 percent coverage. Coverage in the smaller cities varies from 20 to 50 percent.\nSmall towns and rural communities rely on on-site solutions, primarily latrines and drain fields.\nMost  of  the  densely  populated  parts  of  urban  areas  are  serviced. Wastewater  treatment,\nemploying  secondary activated  sludge processes,  exist  in  Bishkek  and  in  10  other  urban\ncenters. Lack of resources for O&M has compromised the effectiveness of these plants.\n18.  The poor state of water and sanitation services has many undesirable consequences for\nthe Kyrgyz people and the country\u2019s economy. Consumers incur significant time costs and\ninconvenience  in  coping  with  deficient  or  lack  of  service;  many  collect  water  from  rivers,\nirrigation channels, and other villages and towns. Poor service is responsible for deteriorating", "6\npublic health and increased expenditures on health. When there is freezing or drought, many\nconsumers depend on costly water from tank trucks and other sources. Coping with poor and\nunsafe water and sanitation services is most difficult for the poor who have to spend more of\ntheir income and energy on water than those who are better off. In spite of the many other\npressing  obligations  during  this  difficult  transition  period  and  economic  recovery,  the\nGovernment recognizes that improving water and sanitation services is an essential part of the\ncountry\u2019s economic and social development strategy. The Government declared 1999 as the\nyear for rural development and included water supply as the top priority for development.\n19.  The poor state of water supply and sanitation systems has its roots in deficient design;\nuse of poor materials and construction methods; and insufficient maintenance, repair, and timely\nrehabilitation. The present financial crises have exacerbated the situation as lack of resources\nprevents any maintenance at all. Water and sanitation infrastructure is being run on borrowed\ntime. In facing these very difficult conditions, the staff involved in the water supply and sanitation\nsector have done a commendable job in keeping the systems operating and delivering water to\ncustomers. Given the lack of funds and the state of repair of sector assets, service quality will\ncontinue to deteriorate. Repair and rehabilitation of existing systems is obviously one of the\nhighest priorities.\nb.  Government Institutions\n20.  The Kyrgyz Republic is a democratic parliamentary republic. Government responsibilities\nare shared across five levels: (i) national Government; (ii) provinces (oblasts) and the national\ncapital region; (iii) districts (rayons); (iv) towns; and (v) village clusters (ayil okmotu). At the\nprovincial and district levels, presidentially appointed administrators (akims) head the  local\nadministration, and locally elected councils (keneshes) provide oversight. The council of the\nsmallest unit  of  local  government,  the  ayil okmotu,  is  an  elected  body  that  handles  both\nadministrative  and  representative  functions.  The  country  is  divided  into  seven  provinces\n(Batken, Chui, Jalal-Abad, Naryn, Osh, Talas, and Yssyk Kul) and the national capital region, 52\ndistricts,  16  towns,  455  village  clusters,  and  1,770  villages.  The  national  Government  is\ncurrently devolving important functions to the local government level. However, there is no\nsingle authority to establish a comprehensive and clear basic infrastructure services policy. The\nfollowing agencies and departments are involved in granting permits, setting standards, and\nmonitoring their implementation. Under MAWR, the Kyrgyzselremstroi (Kyrgyz Rural Repair and\nConstruction Agency) recently renamed as Kyrgyz Ayil Su (KAS or Kyrgyz Rural Water) is\nresponsible for the development of rural water supply systems, through water users councils\n(WUCs). MAWR through its Water Resources Directorate is also responsible for water resource\nmanagement and irrigation schemes. The Sanitary and Epidemiological Services Division (SES)\nof the Ministry of Health (MOH) provides health education programs; SES has representative\noffices at the oblast and rayon levels. Central budget funding is provided for the development\nand dissemination of health and hygiene education programs. SES is also responsible for\nsurveillance of drinking water quality. SES monitors the quality of drinking water by routinely\ncollecting samples from various water supply systems, and testing at one of its 57 water quality\ntesting laboratories. The Ministry of Environmental Protection is responsible for protecting water\nsources, preventing pollution, and decreasing wasteful use of water. The State Agency of\nGeology and Mineral Resources is responsible for controlling the exploitation of groundwater\nsources. The Kyrgyzjylkommunsoyuz (KJKS-Kyrgyz Communal Services Union) is charged with\noverall responsibility for vodokanals (urban water supply and sewerage agencies) and for the\nmethodology of setting prices and tariffs for urban services. The Ministry of Transportation and\nCommunication  is  responsible for  interstate  and  interregional  roads. Village  roads  are  the\nresponsibility of the  village administration.  The  Ministry  of Emergency  Situations  and  Civil\nDefense is responsible for planning and organizing flood control. Actual implementation is a", "7\nlocal responsibility. The association of local self-governments is involved in rural development\nprograms.\nc.  Community-Based and Nongovernment Organizations\n21.  The Government\u2019s policy to increase community participation in the development of\ncommunity infrastructure services, in particular, the water supply sector, has encouraged the\ninvolvement of community-based organizations (CBOs) and national and local nongovernment\norganizations (NGOs) in the sector. CBOs and NGOs have been involved in the development of\nthe water supply sector over the last decade. The successful CBOs and NGOs have developed\nexpertise, experience, and a good record for the timely delivery of basic services. The main\nselection criteria for their participation are the requirements of being established for at least five\nyears and having experience in the sector for over two years. One well respected CBO is the\ntraditional elders\u2019 council (aksaldar sotu), which protects traditions and sets values for the\ncommunity, and resolves conflicts before cases are taken to a higher authority. This CBO will\nplay an important role in mobilizing community support for the Project in the villages. Other\nexamples of NGOs and CBOs are women\u2019s committees, veterans\u2019 councils, youth committees,\nand block organizations (kwartel).\nd.  Gender and Development\n22.  In many areas of the Kyrgyz Republic, particularly those with a high proportion of low-\nincome  groups,  women  and  children  are  mostly  responsible  for  collecting  drinking  water.\nHowever, women are frequently excluded from planning and implementation activities for new\nwater supply facilities. As the main users of water supply facilities, women have a strong interest\nin ensuring proper design and O&M. Therefore, the Government plans to enlist active women\u2019s\nparticipation in all aspects of water supply and sanitation including (i) planning of water supply\nfacilities,  (ii)  hygiene  and  sanitation  education,  (iii)  O&M,  and  (iv)  gender  training  and\ninformation for community leaders. The women\u2019s involvement will ensure their integration into\nWUCs, as well as into the informal network at the community level. The improved water supply\nand sanitation services will save time especially for women and enable them to engage in\nproductive activities. The women who work in the local governments will be fully involved in\ncapacity  building  under  the  Project  to  enable  them  to  provide  essential  services  to  poor\ncommunities. Half of all training activities will be directed towards women staff who occupy\nrelevant positions. Women\u2019s formal representation will be strengthened in the vodokanal and\nWUCs, as well as their informal network at the community level as part of the capacity-building\ncomponent of the Project.\nB.  Government Policies and Plans\n23.  The World Bank and ADB have coordinated closely in the preparation of a national\nprogram for the  development  of  basic  infrastructure facilities.  The  Government\u2019s  five-year,\nmedium-term policies prepared in 1999 for the development of community-based infrastructure\nservices include (i) focusing on poor areas; (ii) phasing in full cost recovery in five years with\nlifeline affordable tariffs for the poorest beneficiaries; (iii) involving communities in the planning,\nimplementation,  and  O&M;  (iv)  building  institutional  capacity;  (v)  facilitating  private  sector\nparticipation; and (vi) establishing a national coordination committee. The problems facing the\nGovernment during this transition period have given urgency to some of these policies, in\nparticular  the  need  for  a  more  focused  and  coordinated  approach  to  reducing  poverty,\nimplementing cost recovery, and privatizing industry and services. In addition, decentralization\nis seen as an integral part of the Government\u2019s approach to facilitating the restoration of basic\nservices  necessary  for  economic  and  social  development.  Along  with  social  assistance", "8\nprograms, the Government has emphasized improvements in the water supply and sanitation\nsector as part of its instruments to fight poverty, improve living standards, and protect the health\nof the poorest. The close correlation between poverty and access to clean water and health\nindicators make the recovery of the water supply and sanitation sector an integral part of the\nGovernment\u2019s strategy for fighting poverty. In its draft public investment program for 2000-2004,\nthe Government is planning to invest over $100 million in the sector.\n24.  In 1996, the Government began a privatization and land reform process in rural areas.\nAbout 5,000 communal and industrial assets were transferred to local village administrations.\nThese included the assets of the sovkhoze and kolkhoze (the State and collective farms), which\npreviously owned the rural water supply systems and bathhouses and much of the housing.\nThey were also responsible for the roads within the farms. In the urban areas, the industrial\nassets have been candidates for privatization, or have been wound up. Transfer of water and\nsewerage,  along  with  other  communal  assets  to  the  relevant  municipal  self-government\nadministration began in 1998. This reform of communal utilities provides the tariff to cover the\nactual  production  costs,  taking  into  account  the  subsidies  available  to  certain  population\ncategories. However, it falls short of demanding full cost recovery. While these activities are\npositive, too much power still resides with the central authorities. One of the problems is that\nownership and control are seen as separate issues.  While ownership is being transferred to the\nlocal level, the control including the setting of tariffs still remains at the central level. This issue\nmust be resolved to facilitate long-term sustainability of the desired project results. A good\nexample is seen with the 1998 law on drinking water, which identifies KJKS as responsible for\nthe  methodology  to  establish  tariffs,  the  National  Commission  for  the  Protection  and\nDevelopment of Competitiveness in the President\u2019s office as responsible for ensuring that the\nrates are justified, and the Jogorku Kengesh (Peoples Assembly) as the body that ultimately\nannually ratifies the actual tariffs set. This procedure is unwieldy and allows only for annual\nchanges, thus greatly jeopardizing efforts to ensure that enterprises become financially viable.\nHowever, the Government is presently revising the law on drinking water to provide full cost\nrecovery by allowing the WUCs and vodokanals to set their own tariffs.\n25.  The law on drinking water also includes several regulations pertaining to protecting\nwater resources and the environment. The main policy components of the law are that (i) all\npeople have the right to uninterrupted, sufficient safe water; (ii) individual water meters are to be\ninstalled for all customers; and (iii) local governments must set aside funds and equipment to\nsupply the population with water in cases of emergency. The law identifies the departments and\nGovernment  agencies  responsible  for  water  quality,  the  method  of  water  treatment  and\nproduction,  environmental  protection  of  water  sources,  the  preparation  of  water  supply\nprograms, the monitoring of water resources, and the setting of tariffs. It also defines the\nresponsibilities of the local self-governments for implementing the regulations.\n26.  The policy of establishing local farmer water users associations to manage resources, is\npart of the larger policy to develop more rational water resource management. The policy\nrestores  the  ownership  of  irrigation  systems  to  the  users.  The  local  governments  are\nresponsible for system management and the recovery of all costs, including investment and\noperational costs. However, the geographic coverage of the water supply and irrigation systems\ndoes not necessarily coincide.\n27.  Government policy on health stresses preventative actions. With very limited resources,\nthe Government is actively looking for external financial assistance. The Government\u2019s hygiene\neducation program is to be implemented at the village level. Local health posts receive funding\nfrom the rayon budget, although the village administration can use nonbudget funds to provide\nadditional staff. Consequently, these facilities remain staffed even in quite remote rural areas,", "9\nbut they have no medicines and little working equipment. These health posts and schools\norganize health education programs.\n28.  The policy that transfers ownership to the local self-governments also addresses village\nroads. Village governments, using the village budget are responsible for road maintenance\nwithin the village. Flood control measures are the responsibility of the Ministry of Emergency\nSituations and  Civil  Defense,  which  receives about  1.5 percent  of  the total  State budget.\nResponsibility  for  monitoring  flood  risk,  however,  is  with  the  State  Committee  on\nHydrometeorology. Monitoring of the situation in flood-prone areas is the responsibility of the\nministry. Preventative measures, information campaigns, and reconstruction and rehabilitation\nworks must be covered by local funds. Thus flood prevention measures required at the village\nlevel are the responsibility of the village budget.\n29.  The investment levels required to provide the entire population with a modest, but safe\nlevel of water supply and sanitation services are as follows: (i) $90 million to rehabilitate and\nexpand the rural water supply systems, (ii) $10 million to upgrade rural sanitation facilities, (iii)\n$60 million to rehabilitate urban water supply systems and provide water supply by public\nstandpipes to unserved people, (iv) $20 million to rehabilitate sewerage systems in densely\npopulated urban areas, and (v) $20 million to rehabilitate and improve the performance of\nexisting wastewater treatment plants. Altogether about $200 million of investments over 10\nyears, or about an average of $45 per capita (including costly new development in urban areas),\nwill be needed to address the highest priority and most urgent concerns in the water supply and\nsanitation sector.\nC.  External Assistance to the Sector\n30.  The World Bank and ADB have coordinated closely during project preparation as the\nWorld Bank is preparing a similar project in the other provinces. It is now preparing a project (a\nloan of about $15.0 million) to improve urban and rural water supply and sanitation facilities for\nthe oblasts of Naryn, Talas, and Yssyk Kul. ADB and the World Bank have cooperated closely\nin identifying requirements for policy development initiatives and institutional arrangements for\ncoordinated project implementation. Agreements have been reached with the Government on\nthe identification of project areas, scope of work, cost recovery, and per capita investment\nrequirements. ADB and the World Bank have also other ongoing projects in the oblasts covered\nby the two proposed projects. Several other multilaterals, bilaterals, and international NGOs\nhave also provided assistance to the water supply and sanitation sector.  The assistance has\nbeen  limited  to  pilot  projects  and  activities  to  develop  community-based  solutions  for  the\ndeteriorating water supply situation. Among the external aid agencies, the Helvetas, Soros\nFoundation-Kyrgyz Republic, Swiss Association for International Cooperation, United Nations\nChildren\u2019s  Fund,  United States  Agency for  International  Development,  and  United  Nations\nDevelopment Programme have been active and  provided  limited funds.  The World  Health\nOrganization has helped the National Environmental Action Plan. Appendix 2 lists external\nassistance from aid agencies to the sector.\nD.  Lessons Learned\n31.  The  main  problems  faced  during  the  implementation  of  large-scale  aid-assisted\ninfrastructure services projects relate to insufficient community consultation and participation in\nthe planning and design of subprojects; this contributes to nonfunctioning or nonestablishment\nof  local  utility  agencies,  lack  of  guarantees  for  O&M  financing,  poor  cost  recovery,  and\ninadequate O&M. The need to focus on sustainability of operations and increased sense of\nownership  has  been  recognized.  The  Government\u2019s  limited  experience  with  project", "10\nimplementation has led to delays and slow disbursement. It is also clear that there is need for\nthe Government officials to become more familiar with ADB\u2019s implementation procedures as\nexperienced during the implementation of the Flood Emergency Rehabilitation Project.5 One\nother lesson learned is weak institutional capacity of oblasts. Substantial technical and financial\nassistance  is  required.  These  issues  were  studied  during  the  project  formulation,  and\nappropriate measures have been comprehensively incorporated in the project design (Appendix\n3). The Government, ADB, and other aid agencies are now focusing on community consultation\nand decentralizing the implementation process. Under the Project, a comprehensive capacity-\nbuilding  program  will  be  undertaken  for  local  sector  agencies.  Detailed  cost  recovery\narrangements have been outlined and O&M functions will be strengthened.\nE. Country Operational Strategy\n32.  The primary objectives of the ADB's country operational strategy for the Kyrgyz Republic\nare  to  (i)  support  the  Government's  reform  activities  and  strengthen  its  development\nmanagement  by  encouraging  institutional  change,  strengthening  institutional  capacity,  and\nimproving the provision of public services; (ii) encourage the creation of a new structure for\noutput and capacity by the private sector by facilitating investment and creating jobs; and (iii)\nenhance the long-term potential of the country by investing in physical infrastructure and human\ndevelopment, as well as selectively intervening to protect and rehabilitate the environment. The\nstrategy recognizes the importance of sound management of natural resources and protection\nof the environment for sustainable growth. ADB's country operational strategy was prepared in\n1996 and did not envisage direct  support for  water and  sanitation projects.  However,  the\nGovernment's  requirements and priorities have  changed  and are now focused  on  poverty\nreduction. As explained in the section describing the Government sectoral policies and plans,\nthe Project is a high priority, given the present emphasis of the Government on investments in\nwater supply and sanitation for improving the living conditions of the poor. The Government\nsees the Project as an essential feature of its strategy to ensure (i) that rural areas in particular\nhave adequate access to potable water, and (ii) support for the development of community-\nbased infrastructure services.\n33.  The  ADB's  poverty  reduction  strategy6  states  that  since  poverty  in  the  region  is\nconcentrated in rural areas, ADB will give priority to projects impacting directly on the rural poor.\nThese include rural roads and electrification, promotion of small and medium enterprises, and\nwater supply and sanitation programs (wherever the absence of basic services jeopardizes the\nhealth  of  the  poor).  The  ADB,  IMF,  World  Bank,  and  the  United  Nations  Development\nProgramme, are assisting the Government in preparing a national strategy for poverty reduction.\nThe Government has indicated that improved water supply, sanitation, and other infrastructure\nservices in poor areas will be an integral part of this national strategy. Thus, the proposed\nProject, which will impact significantly on the poor is fully in consonance with the new priorities\nof both the Government and the ADB to improve basic services and living conditions particularly\nin poverty affected areas.\nF. Policy Dialogue\n34.  ADB\u2019s policy dialogue with the Government has covered (i) investment priorities and\npoverty focus, (ii) development of community infrastructure services at  the  local  level  and\ndecentralization of implementation, and (iii) local maintenance of infrastructure facilities.\n                                               \n5\nLoan 1633-KGZ: Flood Emergency Rehabilitation Project, for $5.0 million, approved on 24 September 1998.\n6\nFighting Poverty in Asia and Pacific: The Poverty Reduction Strategy of the ADB dated 19 October 1999.", "11\n35.  Investment  Priorities  and  Poverty  Focus.  Under  the  centrally  planned  system,\ninfrastructure investments were capital and energy intensive, and difficult and expensive to\noperate and maintain; large investments in urban areas were favored. As a result of ADB\u2019s\npolicy dialogue, the Government has agreed to rehabilitate and expand existing infrastructure in\npoor areas. The Government agreed to support the Project, and will rehabilitate and expand\nexisting water supply; sanitation, including wastewater treatment and bathhouses; flood control\nand drainage facilities; and local roads in selected poor urban and rural areas. While minimizing\ncosts, the emphasis will be on rehabilitating and upgrading existing facilities, using simple\ntechnology and low cost. The poverty focus is reflected in the selection criteria which aim to\nfocus support for poor communities which have a majority of their population living below the\npoverty  line  and  with  high  incidence  of  waterborne-related diseases. About  70  percent  of\nhouseholds in the targeted project communities are living below the poverty line and limited\naccess to basic infrastructure services is a major issue contributing to poverty.\n36.  The Development of Community Infrastructure Services at the Local Level and\nDecentralization of Implementation. As infrastructure  investments  have  traditionally been\nplanned and financed by the national Government, remnants of top-down approaches persist at\nalmost all administrative levels, with little participation from local communities and governments.\nThe project design required extensive discussions between the central and local governments,\nagreement  on  implementation  arrangements,  and  the  preselection  of  facilities.  Under  a\ndecentralized  approach,  project  implementation  will  be  at  the  oblast  level,  with  project\nmanagement support from the central level. Capacity building will be carried out under the loan\nand the associated TA. By playing an active role in the selection of facilities to be rehabilitated,\nlocal governments are expected to gain experience in planning and administrative functions.\nHowever, many areas will require special community-based bodies, such as WUCs, to be\nestablished to plan and ultimately own and manage the water supply systems. This is necessary\nas (i) the area covered by water supply systems does not always coincide with local village\ngovernment boundaries; and (ii) opportunities must be provided for women, who are generally\nmost affected by poor water supply and sanitation, to be involved in the planning of the system\nand its management. Investments will reflect local needs and priorities, and incentives for cost\nrecovery will be in place. The Government accepts this principle and understands that for the\nsystem to be sustainable, ownership and responsibility must be passed to the users. The\nProject is thus structured to increase local-level responsibilities for infrastructure services by\ndecentralizing implementation and O&M, and actively involving all stakeholders.\n37.  Local Maintenance of Infrastructure Facilities. The communities will maintain the\nproject facilities  at  adequate  levels  by  implementing  user  charges  to  be  collected  by  the\nvodokanals and WUCs. Since the lack of proper maintenance in any one year would likely\nincrease the cost of rehabilitating a given facility in succeeding years, the local governments\nhave agreed in principle to establish appropriate and affordable user fees. This will be reflected\nin the revised law on drinking water. For water supply facilities, full cost recovery is envisaged,\nunder a phased program, with internal cross-subsidies for the poorer population to be served\nthrough public standpipes. Community contributions, in cash or in kind, will be mobilized with\nproject assistance. After careful analysis, the Government and ADB have in close consultation\nwith communities, concluded that by using least cost approaches and self help (ashar) and by\ncarefully calculating for differentiation, the proposed subprojects are affordable for communities\nconcerned.  Project  formulation  was  based  on  a  process  of  surveys,  data  analysis,  and\nconsultation  with  concerned  stakeholders,  including  all  levels  of  Government,  and  project\nbeneficiaries.  This  participatory  approach  had  very  positive  results  on  building  conceptual\nunderstanding  and  consensus.  Fostering  partnerships  between  the  community  and  local\ngovernments will result in more responsive infrastructure services delivery. The thrust of the", "12\nproject structure is to build ownership and responsibility at the local and community levels with\neffective partnerships between local bodies and the communities.\nIV. THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA. Rationale\n38.  The Government\u2019s sector policies and strategies prepared under the project preparation\nTA have been reviewed and agreed upon, and are considered to be well formulated. The ADB\nand the World Bank have coordinated and will assist the Government with two similar projects\ncovering the entire country. The Executing Agency, MAWR has implemented one ADB-financed\nproject7  and  other externally assisted  projects  in  the  past,  and  has  adequate  capacity  to\nimplement the Project.  MAWR  will  be further  strengthened  through  the Project\u2019s  capacity-\nbuilding activities. Therefore, a sector lending modality was adopted for the Project. The sector\nlending approach is also justified by the large number of replicable subprojects. To ensure\nsustainability,  community  consultations  will  be  a  feature  of  the  Project.  Another  important\ncharacteristic is the major role of oblast administrations in project implementation. Decentralized\nimplementation  is  to  be  standardized  on  a  countrywide  basis  for  all  community-based\ninfrastructure services sector projects. The capacity of vodokanals and local government will be\nbuilt up to enable them to implement subprojects and to undertake O&M of the constructed\nsystems.\n39.  The  Government\u2019s  development  objectives  to  promote  economic  growth,  reduce\npoverty, and provide balanced regional development include improving water supply, sanitation,\nflood control and drainage, and rural roads. The country\u2019s infrastructure facilities are often\npoorly designed and inadequately maintained. Insufficient and polluted drinking water supplies,\ncombined with poor sanitation and hygiene practices are directly linked to significant increases\nof waterborne diseases. Flooding is generally caused by inadequacy and poor maintenance of\ndrains. Local roads need to be upgraded and expanded to cope with increasing traffic. Prior to\nthe  1990s,  the  FSU  provided  sufficient  subsidies  to  construct,  rehabilitate,  and  maintain\ninfrastructure throughout the country.  Now, the Kyrgyz Government does not have the financial\ncapability to provide the necessary funds, and infrastructure facilities in both urban and rural\nareas have fallen into poor repair.\n40.  Rural water supply has been particularly badly hit.  Formerly, an estimated 70 percent of\nrural villages had a clean, healthy piped water supply.  This coverage has now officially dropped\nto 60 percent  although  the  work  under  the  project  preparatory  TA  shows  that,  in  reality,\ncoverage is substantially less with working systems failing rapidly to now less than 40 percent.\nParticularly badly hit are the southern poor oblasts of Jalal-Abad and Osh, where only about 25\npercent  of  villages  have  a  reliable  supply.  Flood  protection  measures  to  protect  water\ninfrastructure are also required in some area because of climate and topographical features. On\nthe plus side there are large resources of groundwater available for high quality drinking water.\nThese can be easily accessed by most village communities.\n41.  The urban  water  supply has  also  reached  a  state  of  crisis.  Although  systems  are\ncontinuing to operate, there has been no new investment for many years. There are no funds\nwith which to carry out routine maintenance, and repairs are mostly performed on an emergency\nbasis,  often  without  proper  replacement  parts.  The  levels  of  tariffs  are  low,  collection\nmanagement is poor, and insufficient money is raised to support efficient operation.\n                                               \n7\nLoan 1407-KGZ: Agriculture Sector Program Loan, for $40 million, approved on 23 November 1995. Another\nLoan 1726-KGZ: Agriculture Area Development Project, for $36 million, was approved on 20 December 1999.", "13\n42.  Statistics  on  morbidity  and  mortality  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  indicate  that  while  the\nmortality rate has declined somewhat because of improvements in basic health services, the\nmorbidity rate continues to increase. Diarrheal diseases that are strongly associated with unsafe\nwater supply, and poor sanitation and hygiene are among the leading causes of morbidity with\nan incidence rate of about 425 per 100,000 population in 1998. Likewise, cases of typhoid have\nincreased each year since 1995, and in 1998 an outbreak in Osh and around Bishkek, due to\npolluted water sources, resulted in an almost fourfold increase over 1997. Figures for all forms\nof hepatitis show a fluctuating situation since 1991, but in 1997 there was a major increase in\ncases of hepatitis A. Given that health statistics are based only on Government hospital in-\npatient records, the prevalence of most of these diseases, and diarrheal diseases in particular,\nis much higher than reported.\n43.  The lack of adequate water supply and sanitation services has a large negative impact\non the social economy of the country and especially the poor. There is almost certainly a direct\nlink between the deterioration of these services and the increase of waterborne and excreta-\nrelated diseases during the 1990s. Having to cope with poor and unsafe water and sanitation\nservices extracts large financial and social costs from the poor population. Some can afford to\nspend resources on alternative methods to provide a centralized water supply, but in rural areas\npeople often walk long distances, only to obtain contaminated water from untreated sources.\nUntil recently, many villages contained communal bathhouses (banyas), which have now largely\nfallen  into disuse  due  to  lack  of  water  supply.  One  of  the  results  is  an  increase  in  skin\ncomplaints caused by lack of proper cleanliness. There is no wastewater collection system in\nrural areas or an acceptable level of human waste disposal. Some urban areas have operational\nsewerage systems, but these are in need of repair due to age and lack of new investment.\nImproving  the  water  supply  and sanitation  sector\u2019s  performance  is an  integral part  of  the\nGovernment\u2019s poverty reduction strategy.\nB.  Objective and Scope\n44.  The main objective of the Project is to improve the living  and  health  conditions  in\nselected rural and urban communities, in particular for the poor, through the provision of basic\ninfrastructure services. The Project aims to achieve its objective by (i) assisting the central and\nlocal governments in delivering infrastructure services; (ii) supporting sanitation and hygiene\neducation;  (iii)  improving  the  technical  and  financial  capacity  of  local  governments  and\nvodokanals in the planning, implementation, and O&M of facilities; and (iv) promoting ownership\nand community management of both rural and urban community-based infrastructure services.\n45.  The project area will cover the three oblasts of Chui, Jalal-Abad, and Osh, which contain\ntwo thirds of the country\u2019s population and most of the country\u2019s poor. The three provinces were\nselected as they are among the poorest and ADB has other projects there which would help\nmaximize development impact. The World Bank and ADB have coordinated closely during\nproject preparation. The proposed World Bank-financed project is expected to cover another\nthree oblasts (Naryn, Talas, and Yssyk Kul) with a similar project. The Project consists of two\nparts: Part A: Physical Infrastructure; and Part B: Capacity Building.\n1.  Part A: Physical Infrastructure\n46.  Part  A  includes  about  247  subprojects:  about  240  rural  subprojects,  covering  730\nvillages with populations ranging from 500 to 20,000, and 7 small towns subprojects with 20,000\nto 80,000 residents. Each rural subproject will cover one village or a cluster of two or more\nvillages. The rural subprojects will include the rehabilitation and upgrading of piped water supply\nsystems, sanitation facilities  including  latrines  and  bathhouses,  flood  control  and  drainage", "14\nfacilities, and local roads. The urban subprojects will cover rehabilitating and extending piped\nwater supply services, and improving sewerage systems including wastewater collection and\ntreatment.  The  development  and  expansion  of  the  water  supply  systems  will  include\nconstructing and/or rehabilitating water source intakes, pumping stations, treatment facilities,\nstorage reservoirs, transmission and distribution pipelines, public standpipes, and individual\nhouse connections. The subprojects will derive supplies from different types of water sources.\nMost of the subprojects will use groundwater and springs, and will require rehabilitation and\nsome drilling of deep wells and the construction of spring intakes.\n47.  Rural Water Supply Component. This component will cover 730 villages of the total\n1,403 villages in the three project oblasts. About 560 villages of the 1,403, or 40 percent, do not\nhave any water supply; the remaining 843 villages have only about 50 percent of their systems\nfunctioning. Of the total 2.4 million rural population in the project oblasts, about 50 percent or\n1.2 million will be covered by the 240 rural subprojects; 420 villages will be provided with new\nsystems, and 310 villages will have their systems rehabilitated. Of the 240 subprojects covering\ntwo to nine villages, about 170 systems will utilize groundwater sources, 50 systems spring\nsources, and 20 systems surface water. On average the per capita investment cost will be $18\nfor groundwater, $10 for spring development, and $25 for surface water. The total cost for the\nrural water supply component will be about $23.9 million and the overall average cost will be\n$20 per capita.\n48.  Rural Sanitation Component. This component covers about 90 villages in each of the\nthree project oblasts. The Project aims to provide 70,000 households with improved family\nlatrines. In addition, about 250 school latrines will be improved. For the family latrines, materials\nwill be required to make the squatting plate, ventilation pipe, cover for hole, and improve the\nsuperstructure. The family latrine is estimated to cost $30 per household; the per capita cost will\nbe about $5. The school latrines will be constructed or rehabilitated in the form of ventilated\nimproved pit latrines connected to septic tanks. The improvements to each school latrine will\ncost about $300. About $2.2 million will be spent on the rural sanitation programs. In addition,\nabout $0.5 million will be used to rehabilitate bathhouses in all 730 villages under the Project\nwhere water supply improvements will be undertaken. The average cost will be about $700 per\nbathhouse. The communities have indicated a high demand for public bathhouses, and the\nGovernment will encourage their privatization.\n49.  Rural  Flood  Control  and  Drainage  Component.  Approximately  30  subprojects\ncovering about 100 villages will be undertaken to protect rural water supply facilities from flood\ndamage. The total investment for rural flood control and drainage will be about $0.7 million and\nthe per capita investment cost about $5.\n50.  Rural Roads Component. Rural roads within the village boundaries will be improved to\nenable easy access to secondary roads leading to rayon centers. Materials such as local gravel\nare adequate for  the  road base  and  surface  pavement.  Based on  low-cost  solutions  and\nnormative standards, unit costs to improve local roads are about $50,000 per kilometer; $1.0\nmillion has been allocated for road improvements. About 20 kilometers of village roads will be\nimproved.\n51.  Urban Water Supply Component. Seven small towns, of the 13 in the project area, will\nbe covered. They have a population of about 0.3 million. The scope will cover rehabilitation and\nconstruction of  reservoirs,  transmission  mains,  networks,  public  standpipes,  bulk  flow  and\nconsumer flow meters, and valves. The total investment for urban water supply will be about\n$5.8 million and the per capita investment cost about $20.", "15\n52.  Urban Sewerage Component. Three of the seven small towns, also covered under the\nurban  water  supply  component,  will  have  their  existing  sewerage  systems  rehabilitated,\nincluding repair and replacement of deteriorated sewers. Pumping stations will be refurbished,\nand wastewater treatment plants refurbished and extended. Effective O&M equipment will be\nprovided. Flow sampling and laboratory testing equipment, flow gauges, and sewer cleaning\nequipment will be procured. Tankers will be supplied to facilitate tank emptying and sewer\nflushing on a regular basis. The urban sewerage work will cost about $4.8 million and will\nbenefit about 90,000 persons. The per capita investment cost will be about $50.\n2. Part B: Capacity Building\n53.  Part B covers an institutional development program, hygiene and sanitation education\nprogram, and consulting services for project management support.\n54.  Institutional Development Program. To be carried out by MAWR assisted by the\nconsultants, the program involves establishing training centers, and training central and local\ngovernments, WUCs, and vodokanals board members and staff to strengthen their capacity to\nefficiently implement, operate, and maintain the systems. The program will provide four types of\ntraining:  (i)  subproject  related  training  for  local  governments,  community  leaders,  and\nmanagement and financial staff; (ii) training for engineering design; (iii) training of trainers; and\n(iv) in-house training for MAWR staff. The program will focus on four areas: (i) training in O&M\nemphasizing reduction of unaccounted for water; (ii) gradual expansion of the organizational\nstructure, including assistance to local governments, WUCs, and vodokanals, in identifying\nrequired qualifications of key staff to be hired; (iii) development of the local governments,\nWUCs, and vodokanals\u2019 planning, engineering, and financial capability; and (iv) depending on\nvodokanals\u2019 size and development level, computerization of administrative, accounting, billing\nand  collection,  engineering,  and  financial  operations.  About  16,000  central  and  local\ngovernment and vodokanal staff will be trained under the program (Appendix 4).\n55.  Hygiene and Sanitation Education Program. To be developed and disseminated in\nrural subprojects, the program will help the beneficiaries to improve their understanding of the\nclose  interrelationship  between  hygiene,  water,  sanitation,  and  health.  As  part  of  a\ncomprehensive information dissemination and education drive of the Government to improve\nhealth conditions, the program will be formulated and implemented by MOH. The program will\nfocus on safe drinking water, hand washing, proper use of toilets, and need for adequate\nwastewater disposal. About 540 staff of local governments, and 14 staff of vodokanals will be\ntrained in health education principles and methods. The program will also cover quality testing\nto ensure that the quality of water that will be distributed by local governments and vodokanals\nto the consumers is regularly monitored to ascertain that all parameters are within the national\nstandards for drinking water. The program will be formulated and implemented in 90 villages in\neach of the three oblasts under the Project.\n56.  Consulting Services. Consultants will help implement the Project and provide project\nmanagement support. They will also support the implementing capacity of sector agencies\nconcerned. The consultants will involve the CBOs and NGOs in socioeconomic surveys and\ncommunity consultations. The services will cover (i) project management and monitoring, (ii)\nfeasibility studies and design of subprojects, (iii) construction of subprojects, (iv) preparation and\nimplementation  of  the  hygiene  and  sanitation  education  program,  and  (v)  planning  and\nimplementation of the institutional development program.\n57.  MAWR has agreed to involve at least three CBOs or NGOs (women\u2019s committee, elders\u2019\ncouncil, and block organizations) to be associated with the project consulting services for  (i)", "16\ncommunity consultation and development in subproject planning and O&M; (ii) hygiene and\nsanitation education training activities; and (iii) monitoring subprojects. MAWR will also use\nCBOs to assist in capacity building. Specific steps to enhance women\u2019s participation in the\nProject include (i) identifying women\u2019s groups in the community; (ii) training women\u2019s community\ngroups to participate in project-related activities such as health education and gender issues;\n(iii) training women\u2019s organizations, including poorer women, in the decision-making process\nincluding planning of  water  supply and  sanitation  facilities;  and  (iv)  providing  employment\nopportunities for women in the activities of local governments, WUCs, and vodokanals, including\nin the O&M of water supply and sanitation facilities.\nC.  Technical Justification\n58.  The Project incorporates appropriate technology taking into account the limited capacity\nof local governments. An important criterion for the selection of a water supply technology is its\nadaptability to local conditions and community demand. The community consultations ensure\nthat appropriate technologies will be investigated and discussed prior to implementation. Such\nan approach helps ensure that technically appropriate and acceptable systems are sustainable.\nWith this concept, the Project proposes the adoption of simple piped water supply system\ntechnologies. Most of the water supply schemes will include deep wells with public standpipes in\nseveral places in a given community. The type of technology for the systems will be guided by\nthe design criteria (Appendix 5). When designing the Project, the sanitary conditions in the\nproject areas were also reviewed. The seven urban subprojects will involve improving water\nsupply facilities; in three of these the sewerage systems will be rehabilitated and expanded,\nincluding wastewater collection and treatment. The hygiene and sanitation education program\nwill improve the use of toilets and wastewater disposal. The flood control components provide\nfor the rehabilitation of drainage canals. Works involved in the road components provide for\nupgrading the local roads to standard specifications.\nD.  Cost Estimates\n59.  Based on cost estimates of the 10 representative core subprojects reviewed, the total\nproject cost is estimated at $45.0 million  equivalent, of  which  $20.9  million  is  the foreign\nexchange cost and $24.1 million equivalent is the local currency cost. The cost estimates\ninclude taxes and duties, as well as physical and price contingencies. The subprojects included\nunder the Project represent least-cost solutions. A summary of the cost estimates is provided in\nTable 1, and detailed cost estimates are given in Appendix 6.", "17\nTable 1: Cost Estimates\n($ million)\nForeign Local Total\nComponent Exchange Currency Cost\nA.

The  proposed  ADB  loan  of  $36.0  million  equivalent  will  finance  the  entire  foreign\nexchange cost of $20.9 million (about 46 percent of the total project cost) and $15.1 million\nequivalent of the local currency cost (about 34 percent of the total project cost). The local cost\nfinancing is considered justified because of the difficult fiscal circumstances of the country. The\nbalance, amounting to $9.0 million equivalent, or about 20 percent of the total cost, will be\nfinanced by the beneficiary communities ($3.0 million), the oblast and rayon administrations\n($0.5 million), and the central Government ($5.5 million). The Government financing will cover\nlocal expenditures including taxes and duties. The borrower will be the Kyrgyz Republic and the\nforeign exchange risk will be borne by the Borrower. The proposed loan will be provided from\nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources and will have the following terms: an amortization period of 32\nyears including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest charge of 1 percent per annum during\nthe  grace  period  and  1.5  percent  per  annum  thereafter.  The  proposed  financing  plan  is\nsummarized in Table 2.\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\nForeign Local Total\nSource Exchange Currency Cost Percent\nA.

The Executing Agency\n61.  MAWR will be the Executing Agency for the Project. A principal function of MAWR is to\nbe  responsible  for  preparing  and  implementing  special  programs  to  develop  and  improve\nsustainable piped water supply systems. MAWR is headed by a minister of cabinet rank who is\nassisted by four deputy ministers. MAWR has a strong cadre of technical staff. It has 71 staff at\nits  headquarters,  including 58  engineers  of  various disciplines, four  accountants,  and  one\nlawyer. MAWR also has offices at the oblast level. KAS is a subdivision of MAWR and a\nseparate legal entity that maintains its own bank accounts. KAS is directly responsible for the\nplanning, design, and implementation of rehabilitation of water supply. KAS has 10 staff at its\nheadquarters including five engineers, and two accountants. It also has a staff of 683 and\noffices in all oblasts and rayons. MAWR has considerable experience in dealing with rural water\nsupply rehabilitation. MAWR implementation capabilities will be further strengthened through the\nProject\u2019s capacity-building activities.\nG. Implementation Arrangements\n1. Execution and Coordination\n62.  The Government will establish a project management unit (PMU) under MAWR. The\nPMU  will  be  responsible  for  overall  implementation  of  the  Project  including  awarding  of\ncontracts in coordination with the PMU\u2019s regional offices, called project implementation units\n(PIUs), that will be established in the three project oblasts. The PMU will be headed by a full-\ntime project coordinator and have five staff to be recruited under the consulting services in the\nfields of project implementation, engineering, financial management, community participation,\nand capacity building. The PMU will coordinate and manage all activities for the implementation\nand management of the Project, and report directly to MAWR. The PIUs will coordinate the\nassistance to the subproject communities in preparing and developing the rehabilitation and\ndevelopment of basic infrastructure, under the general direction of the PMU. The PIUs will assist\nthe PMU in all aspects of project implementation and coordinate closely with the concerned\ntechnical departments and agencies at the oblast level. The PIUs will initiate and coordinate key\nproject implementation activities such as the community consultations, detailed engineering\ndesigns, preparation of tender and bid documents, evaluation of bids, awarding of contracts,\nprocurement, construction supervision, monitoring and quality control, maintenance of project\naccounts, and clearance for environmental examinations. The Government is also planning to\nestablish a national water supply and sanitation agency to implement all future water supply and\nsanitation projects.\n63.  Each PIU will be headed by a project director who will be seconded from the concerned\noblast by its governor. The project directors will be assisted by a full-time project manager in\neach of the three PIUs. Each PIU will have a staff of five persons to be recruited under the\nconsulting services in the fields of engineering, construction supervision, social development,\naccounting, and community development. The Government will ensure that adequate technical\nstaff, the skills and number of each will be decided upon in consultation with ADB, are seconded\nto the PIUs as needed to help with water supply, sanitation, flood control and drainage, and\nlocal roads.\n64.  A national water supply and sanitation committee (NWSSC) will be formed at the central\nGovernment  level  to  provide  policy  guidance,  and  monitor  and  supervise  overall  project\nimplementation. The NWSSC will be chaired by a senior Government official at the Minister\u2019s or\nDeputy Minister\u2019s level and comprise representatives of the concerned ministries, offices, and", "19\nagencies including and Goskominvest (State Commission on Foreign Investment and Economic\nAssistance), MAWR, Ministry of Finance, MOH, Ministry of Environmental Protection, State\nAgency  for  Geology  and  Mineral  Resources,  KJKS,  and  the  association  of  local  self-\ngovernments. The NWSSC will review reports to be provided by the PMU, and provide guidance\nand instructions, as necessary, to the PMU and PIUs. Based on lessons learned and to ensure\nsustainability,  extensive  consultation  with  the  communities  is  required.  To  ensure  this,\ndecentralized  institutional  arrangements  are  needed  to  formalize  community  involvement.\nAccordingly, the Project incorporates an institutional development program for concerned sector\nagencies. The decentralized implementation model is to be standardized on a countrywide basis\nfor all community infrastructure services projects.\n65.  To  rehabilitate  and  develop  infrastructure  facilities,  the  PIUs  will  work  with  local\ngovernments, vodokanals, and WUCs, as well as the oblast administrations. The PIU will carry\nout  a  rapid  assessment  of  need  and  capacity  of  the  community,  local  governments  and\nvodokanals to meet their obligations and this report will be submitted with the applications for\nproject funding from the local village communities and governments. The decision on which\ncommunities and facilities are to be assisted and to what extent will be decided by NWSSC on\nthe recommendation of the PMU. The PMU will provide the selection criteria, and the PIU will\npresent the applications, with their own assessment, to the PMU for their evaluation.\n66.  In preparing the subprojects, once approved for funding, the PIUs will work with CBOs\nand NGOs to help  mobilize  the  community  and  to  prepare  socioeconomic  surveys  of  the\ncommunity. This will form the basis of an assessment of their ability to pay for the improvements\nand contribute to the costs of the work through financial contributions or the ashar (volunteer\nlabor)  method.  The  design  engineers  will  also  work  with  the  community  to  prepare  the\nsubprojects. Each  subproject  will  require a  simple  business  plan  to  demonstrate  how  the\nsubproject will be managed once complete, the proposed tariff and sanctions, the institutional\narrangements, and staff levels. The details of the project implementation arrangements are in\nAppendix 7.\n2. Subproject Formulation and Approval\na. Selection and Design\n67.  The Project will cover communities that lack basic infrastructure services, especially safe\nand reliable piped water supply services. Each subproject under part A, Physical Infrastructure,\nwill include water supply facilities. The selection criteria for the subprojects require that the\nproject community (i) has a majority of its population living below the poverty level; (ii) has\ndeficient basic infrastructure, in particular, water supply, including poor quality and insufficient\nquantity; (iii) has available water resources to be tapped; and (iv) is willing to establish a WUC,\npay water tariffs of 3 to 5 percent of monthly income, and be responsible for full cost recovery, in\nline  with  the  Government\u2019s  new  policy.  Further,  the  subprojects  will  have  environmental\nclearances and not involve any significant potential adverse environmental impacts that are left\nunmitigated. The subprojects will not require any resettlement. The proposed schemes must\nuse  appropriate  technology  and  represent  the  least-cost  solution.  The  selection  criteria,\npresented in Appendix 8, cover community commitment, and technical, environmental, and\nfinancial aspects. These have been developed within the overall strategy to apply appropriate\nand affordable technology, and to provide adequate flexibility for the wide variety of geographic\nand physical conditions that exist in the project area.", "20\nb. Appraisal and Approval\n68.  A structured approach will be adopted for the appraisal and approval of the physical\ninfrastructure subprojects. Of the estimated 247 eligible subprojects, about 240 rural subprojects\nwith an individual cost of less than $0.5 million have been classified as small, and 7 urban\nsubprojects with an individual cost of over $0.5 million as large. Small subprojects will involve\nmostly deep-well rehabilitation or development without any water treatment required except for\ndisinfection, construction of public bathhouses, flood control, and rehabilitation of local roads.\nLarge  subprojects  could  involve  surface  water  development  with  treatment  works,  and\nsewerage  development  including  wastewater  treatment.  The  economic  justification  of\nsubprojects will be based on (i) the proven economic viability of the appraised core subprojects,\n(ii)  the  adoption  of  least-cost  design  solutions,  and  (iii)  contribution  to  environmental\nimprovements and added health benefits. The PMU will approve all subprojects and obtain\nADB\u2019s prior approval for each of the first two small subproject proposals from each of the three\noblasts and the first large subproject proposals from each oblast. The PMU will furnish ADB with\nan application for the approval of these subprojects, containing a description and appraisal of\nthe  subproject  proposal.  To  ensure  continuing  close  monitoring,  the  PMU  will  submit\ndocumentation relating to the first 20 subprojects completed in each participating oblast for\nADB\u2019s review and comments. ADB will review during implementation a selected number of the\nsubprojects. All subprojects will be appraised by the PMU and approved by the NWSSC. The\nPMU and implementing agencies, assisted by the consultants will carry out economic and\nfinancial  analysis  of  all  large  subprojects,  and  only  simplified  financial  analysis,  including\naffordability analysis, of the small subprojects. Only those subprojects found financially viable\nwill be endorsed for implementation. Documentation relating to the subproject proposals will be\nretained by the PMU and made available to ADB on request.\nc. Appraisal of Core subprojects\n69.  Financial evaluation and socioeconomic analysis have been carried out for the 10 core\nsubprojects which represent a broad range of various subproject types. Of the 10, three each\nare from Chui and Jalal-Abad, and four from Osh. The per capita investment costs of the core\nsubprojects vary from $15 to $50, averaging about $25. The overall viability of all 10 core\nsubprojects reviewed is satisfactory in terms of financial viability, affordability, and type  of\ninfrastructure facilities.\n3. Budgetary Support and Channeling of Funds\n70.  The Government would finance 90 percent of the capital cost; the communities will\ncontribute 10 percent as equity in cash or kind through labor, local building materials, and land.\nThe funds to be provided by the Government will be channeled through regular budgetary\nallocations. The Government has given the assurance that adequate funds for the Project will\nbe allocated and released in line with the implementation schedule. The Ministry of Finance will\nchannel the funds to MAWR and KJKS which will be responsible for awarding all contracts. The\nPIUs within the oblast administrations will assume responsibility for the implementation of the\ncivil works contracts in both the rural and urban communities. The community administrations\nwill conclude agreements with the oblast administrations to implement and repay the loan\nresources. Cost recovery will be made by rural and urban communities, through village and\ntown governments and regional branches of the State treasury in the districts, from tariff and\ncharges to consumers, and the allowance for O&M. A tripartite agreement on channeling of\nfunds and cost recovery will be concluded between the Ministry of Finance, MAWR, KJKS, and\nthe oblast administrations.", "21\n71.  At the start of the Project, the PMU will help the three province administrations formulate\nthe  draft  project  expenditures  for  all  activities,  with  estimates  for  each  year  of  project\nimplementation. These budgets will be reviewed and updated every six months. All budgets will\nbe reviewed and approved by PMU before implementation. Expenditures will be recorded at\nsource  by  the  PIUs  and  the  PMU.  The  PMU  will  approve  and  supervise  all  drawdown\narrangements. The PMU will be responsible for compiling project expenditures based on its own\nexpenditures  and  the  reports  of  expenditures  submitted by the  PIUs.  It  will  report project\nexpenditures to MAWR and the steering committee, with copies to ADB, on a monthly basis with\nquarterly and annual summaries.\n4. Anti-Corruption\n72.  During project processing ADB\u2019s anti-corruption policy was explained to central and local\ngovernment officials. Attention was drawn to the section on fraud and corruption that was added\nto  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on Procurement,  particularly  the  need  for  bidders,  suppliers,  and\ncontractors to observe the highest standards of ethics in the procurement and execution of ADB\nfinanced contracts, and the sanctions if fraud and corruption are discovered. Similarly, the anti-\ncorruption provisions added to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants were discussed.\nThe project  implementation  consulting  services  include  assistance  that  will  strengthen  the\nimplementation arrangements including auditing procedures. The international implementing\nconsultants will assist in strengthening the procedures for the selection and engagement of local\nconsultants,  increase  transparency,  and  provide  for  equal  opportunity  competition.  The\nconsultants will also help to (i) strengthen government auditing standards and procedures; and\n(ii) conduct audit training to promote full and consistent adherence to auditing standards. The\nconsultants will also assist in drafting procurement and bidding documents. This work should\nstrengthen the ability to detect fraud and corruption. The Government is increasingly concerned\nwith governance issues and has conducted campaigns against official corruption.\n5. Implementation Schedule\n73.  Commencing around mid-2000, the Project  will  be  implemented over  6  years,  with\ncompletion expected by mid-2006. The implementation schedule is outlined in Appendix 9. The\nadvance project preparation activities being carried out for 10 core subprojects will ensure that\nthe Project gets off to a fast start. With the preparatory work in progress, the implementation\nschedule is considered to be realistic.\n6. Community-Based and Nongovernment Organizations\n74.  Through MAWR, CBOs and NGOs will (i) help with community consultation activities, (ii)\nconduct socioeconomic surveys, (iii) monitor subprojects, and (iv) help with training activities on\nhygiene and sanitation education. Women will be closely involved in implementing the hygiene\nand sanitation education program. The implementation consultants will work with suitable CBOs\nand NGOs such as the elders\u2019 council. It is through this CBO that the traditional self-help (ashar)\nsystem is to undertake  work for  the  whole  community.  Under  the Project,  the  local  labor\nrequired will be provided through this CBO.\n7. Project Monitoring and Review\n75.  The Project features (i) an emphasis on decentralized implementation, and (ii) a focus\non institution building. Close monitoring is required to ensure smooth implementation and O&M.\nAccordingly, a comprehensive review of the implementation arrangements, including the role of\nMAWR and vodokanals, as well as project start-up experience, will be undertaken by the", "22\nGovernment and ADB one year after loan effectiveness. An assessment will be made of the\npossibility  of  using  more  decentralized  implementation  approach  allowing  the  oblast\nadministrations  to  gradually  assume  full  responsibility  for  physical  implementation  of  the\nsubprojects. A comprehensive midterm review will be undertaken three years after the loan\neffectivity.  These  reviews  will  focus  on  the  impact  on  poverty  reduction,  implementation\narrangements, community involvement, physical implementation, design and technology, O&M\narrangements, institutional aspects including training, hygiene and sanitation education, and the\nrole of women. The reviews will also assess the Project\u2019s progress and achievements against its\nobjectives,  identify  any  problems  encountered,  and  recommend  any  required  remedial\nmeasures.\n8. Procurement\n76.  The procurement of goods and services financed by the ADB loan will be undertaken in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  International  competitive  bidding\nprocedures will be applied for supply contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of $500,000 or\nmore. Supply contracts with a value less than $500,000 equivalent will follow international\nshopping procedures, except for supply contracts with a value of less than $100,000 equivalent,\nwhich may be procured by direct purchase. Local competitive bidding procedures will be applied\nfor civil works contracts which are all valued at less than $2.0 million. Local competitive bidding\nprocedures  applicable  to  the  Project  were  reviewed  by  the  Appraisal  Mission  and  are\nacceptable to ADB. The tentative contract packaging and proposed procurement modes are in\nAppendix 10.\n9. Consulting Services\n77.  The Project will require consulting services in the fields of project management, water\nsupply  and  sanitation  engineering,  environmental  examination,  hydrogeology,  well  drilling,\nhealth education, financial and accounting advice, and institutional development for assistance\nwith (i) preparation of feasibility studies including socioeconomic, technical, and environmental\nsurveys; (ii) development of standard water supply designs; (iii) preparation of detailed design,\ncontract packages, and documents; (iv) supervision and evaluation of project activities; (v)\nsupport to the institutional development program including training for unaccounted for water\nloss reduction; (vi) support to the activities of the PMU and PIUs; (vii) training of the accounting\nstaff  on  preparing  loan  withdrawal  applications  and  the  supporting  documents;  and  (viii)\nmaintaining accurate and sufficient accounting project records. A total of 846 person-months (67\nperson-months  international  and  779  person-months  domestic)  of  consulting  services  are\nrequired. To ensure project quality, the international consultants  will be involved in project\nmanagement, financial, and  institutional  strengthening  activities.  The  domestic  consultants\u2019\nmain activities will be to review technical studies, prepare detailed designs, and supervise\nconstruction.  There  is  a  growing  local  consulting  industry  in  the  country.  The  domestic\nconsultants will be recruited by the international consultants. The consultants will work with\nsuitable CBOs and NGOs. The level of consulting services has been discussed and agreed to\nby ADB and the Government. The consultants will be engaged by MAWR in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements acceptable to ADB for the\nengagement of domestic consultants. Appendix 11 contains the required areas of expertise and\nterms of reference.\n78.  The  institutional  development  program  will  include  training  local  governments  and\nvodokanals on O&M and management of water supply schemes. The program will focus on (i)\ngradual expansion of the organizational structure, including identifying the qualifications of key\nstaff to be hired; (ii) O&M, with emphasis on reduction of unaccounted for water; and (iii)", "23\ndevelopment of capabilities, including planning, engineering, financial, accounting, billing and\ncollection, and operations. Training modules for O&M will be prepared for the training activities.\nWater supply system operators identified mainly from the project communities will be trained\nduring  subproject  implementation,  and  in  the  process,  will  develop  a  comprehensive\nunderstanding of the water supply systems that they will subsequently be operating. About\n16,000 persons will be trained under the institutional development program. The training will be\ncarried out in conjunction with the physical implementation of the subprojects. The PMU will\ncontinue development of the training program with the assistance of the project consultants, and\nwill implement the program.\n79.  The PMU, in coordination with MOH and with assistance from consultants, CBOs, and\nNGOs,  will  develop  the  hygiene  and  sanitation  education  program  including  water  quality\ntesting. The programs will include (i) mass communication campaigns to educate the project\ncommunities on the causes, effects, and prevention of waterborne and related diseases; (ii)\ntraining of about 540 local government officials and local community leaders, and 14 vodokanal\nstaff in health education principles and methods; (iii) training on carrying out sanitary inspection\nof water supply facilities, and the collection and analysis of water samples; and (iv) institutional\nstrengthening of the communities to carry out hygiene and sanitation education and water\nquality testing activities.\n10. Disbursement Arrangements\n80.  An imprest account will be established at a bank to be agreed upon by the Government\nand ADB to facilitate the timely release of loan funds. The Ministry of Finance will supervise the\nimprest  account  operations.  The  initial  amount  to  be  deposited  will  not  exceed  $50,000\nequivalent. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditure (SOE) procedure will be used to reimburse eligible\nexpenditures  and  to  liquidate  advances  provided  to  the  imprest  account.  It  will  allow  for\nfinancing of project expenditures for (i) civil works awarded on the basis of local competitive\nbidding, and also for (ii) locally procured construction materials. The individual payments that\nmay be reimbursed or liquidated under the SOE procedure will not exceed $25,000 equivalent.\nThe imprest account and SOE procedure will be established and maintained in accordance with\nthe Loan Disbursement Handbook and detailed arrangements between the Government and\nADB.\n11. Accounts, Audit, and Report\n81.  The Government through the PMU will (i) maintain separate accounts for the Project,\nand (ii) have such accounts and related financial statements  audited  annually by  auditors\nacceptable to ADB and in accordance with the provisions of the Loan Agreement and as\nspecified in ADB\u2019s Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the Bank. The\nimprest  account  and  SOE  records  will  also  be  audited  as  part  of  the  annual  audit.  The\nGovernment will submit to ADB certified copies (in English) of such audited accounts and\nfinancial statements, and the related reports of auditors, within six months after the close of\neach financial year. For the purpose of complying with the requirements for annual audited\nfinancial statements, proceeds of this loan may be used to finance expenditure for private sector\nauditors and translations of auditors\u2019 reports into English.\n82.  MAWR will submit consolidated quarterly progress reports to ADB (in English) on all\naspects of project implementation. The reports will include details on overall implementation\nprogress,  problems/issues  encountered  during  the  reference  period,  measures  taken  or\nproposed to be taken to remedy these problems, and the proposed program of activities for the\nfollowing quarter. Within six months after the closing date of the loan, MAWR will prepare and", "24\nsubmit to ADB, in a format acceptable to ADB, a project completion report on the utilization and\nimpact of the loan; performance of the Project; the economic and social benefits generated; and\ndetails about implementation, costs, and other information requested by ADB.\n12. Advance Action\n83.  ADB\u2019s Management has approved advance action from the end of the Appraisal Mission\nvisit until loan approval, for recruiting consulting services for implementation assistance and the\npreparation of detailed designs and contract documents.\n13. Community Participation\n84.  To comply with the needs and demands of the community, a participatory approach was\nadopted to formulate and design the Project. A comprehensive socioeconomic survey was\ncarried out during the initial phase of project preparation to determine the real demands of the\npeople in the core subprojects area. The survey results indicate that all respondents wished to\nhave improved basic infrastructure services and expressed their willingness to pay user fees for\nwater  supply  services.  The  survey  respondents  also  expressed  a  strong  commitment  to\nparticipate in project design and implementation. CBOs and NGOs in the core subproject area\nwere  also  consulted  during  project  formulation.  To  achieve  a  high  degree  of  community\ninvolvement in the subproject design, implementation, and operation, the PIUs will carry out\ncommunity participation activities, and assisted by the consultants, carry out socioeconomic\nsurveys to determine the prospective beneficiaries\u2019 needs, affordability, and willingness to pay\nfor  the  services.  A  particular  focus  of  the  participatory  programs  will  be  on  meeting  and\nprioritizing the needs of the poor.\n14. Private Sector Participation\n85.  The private sector will participate in providing the basic infrastructure services. A key\nelement for infrastructure development is to make quality equipment, materials, and contracting\nservices available to involved institutions. A strong support industry is an essential ingredient for\ngood  utility  performance.  In  market  economies,  support  services  to  utilities  are  generally\nsupplied by private firms. The resulting competition allows utilities to choose the best contract in\nterms of quality and cost. A private support industry for the water supply and sanitation sector is\nevolving slowly in the Kyrgyz Republic. The Government through the Project will be encouraging\nthe  development  of  (i)  a  diversified  private  consulting  capacity  by  encouraging  the\ntransformation of present research and design institutes into smaller private organizations; (ii) a\nresponsive and efficient industry to supply quality equipment and materials by accelerating the\nprivatization of State equipment manufacturers and material suppliers; (iii) strong civil works\ncontractors capable of providing quality services by accelerating the privatization of present\nstate civil works contractors, adopting mandatory competitive procurement procedures for public\nenterprises such as water utilities, strengthening technical specifications, and introducing stricter\nsupervision of construction; (iv) small-scale entrepreneurs who can offer community services in\nthe construction and O&M of water supply systems; (v) privatized public bathhouses; and (vi)\nNGOs that can contribute all water system development, in particular help small communities to\nbuild and maintain water and sanitation systems.\n15. Operation, Maintenance, and Cost Recovery\n86.  An  analysis  of  willingness-to-pay  and  affordability  shows  that  full  cost  recovery  is\nfeasible over a five-year period of gradual tariff adjustments. In the past, sustainable O&M of\nwater supply facilities was a major problem. To ensure sustainable O&M, the project design", "25\nincorporates appropriate organization at the local government level, including the restructuring\nof  vodokanals and WUCs, systematic  training  of  staff,  preparation  of  O&M  manuals,  and\nperiodic monitoring of operations, including consumer satisfaction. The institutional development\nprogram  will  establish  proper  procedures  for  (i)  the  collection  of  fees,  (ii)  sanctions  for\nnonpayment,  and  (iii)  payment  of  capital  and  O&M  costs,  including  depreciation.  For  the\nconstructed subprojects, the communities will pay the full cost covering the investment and\nO&M costs, including depreciation. The local water supply and sanitation organizations will be\nresponsible  for  O&M  of  constructed  facilities.  The  WUCs  and  vodokanals  will  also  be\nresponsible for the collection of consumer fees on a regular monthly basis. Households with\nhouse or yard connections will be charged a higher fee than poorer households served by public\nstandpipes. The cross-subsidies within the system will allow the poorest to pay lower water\ntariffs than others. The charges will be affordable for all consumers. The sanitation, flood control\nand  drainage  facilities,  and  local  roads  will  be  operated  and  maintained  by  the  local\ngovernments, and the O&M cost for this will be paid for from land and other local taxes.\n87.  The socioeconomic surveys to be undertaken as part of subproject design will facilitate\nbeneficiary involvement and enable the determination of an appropriate and affordable service\nlevel. Participation of community representatives and other stakeholders will ensure that the\ncosts of the investment and O&M, including depreciation are fully understood. The Government\nwould like to achieve full cost recovery. It is critical to achieve reasonable cost recovery as it\ncannot afford to subsidize the water supply sector.\n16. Land Acquisition\n88.  In view of the sector lending modality for the Project, specific land requirements have not\nbeen fully identified. However, based on the core subprojects, it is estimated that the Project will\nnot involve any major land acquisition but will require small areas of land for the location of deep\nwells, water storage, sewage treatment, and right-of-way for pipelines. Community-owned land\nis required. Land acquisition does not entail any resettlement or relocation of people in the\nproject  area.  Also  the  road  rehabilitation  component  will  not  involve  any  resettlement  or\nrelocation of people.\n17. Project Performance Monitoring System\n89.  The PIUs will implement a project performance monitoring system (PPMS) for each\nsubproject to evaluate the delivery of the planned facilities and the project benefits accrued. A\nframework  and  the  indicative  indicators  are  shown  in  Appendix  12.  The  PMU,  with  the\nassistance of the consultants, will develop comprehensive PPMS procedures and plans in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  handbook  within  six  months  after  loan  effectiveness.  The  PPMS\nactivities, including the establishment of benchmarks, collection of information, monitoring of\nbenefits, and evaluation of social impact, will be undertaken by the local governments. Data\ncollection will be carried out prior to physical implementation of the Project, in conjunction with\nsocioeconomic surveys. It will then continue on a regular basis during implementation, and\nwithin three months after project completion. The results will be incorporated into the project\nprogress and completion report.\nH. Environmental and Social Measures\n1.  Environmental\n90.  Overall, the Project is environmentally beneficial. An initial environmental examination\n(IEE) was carried out for eight rural subprojects and two urban subprojects in accordance with", "26\nADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Requirements and Environmental Review Procedures. The\nIEE  found  that  the  rural  subprojects  component,  involving  simple,  appropriate,  low-cost\ntechnology, does not pose any serious environmental consequences. The provision of safe\ndrinking water and proper environmental sanitation would contribute significantly to improving\nthe environment in rural areas. The availability of a safe and piped water supply will eliminate\nthe  time-consuming  activity  of  fetching  water  from  polluted  and  unsafe  water  sources.\nComplementary  hygiene  and  sanitation education  would  also  have  a  beneficial  impact  by\npromoting a hygienic and clean environment. The Project will include many small water supply\nschemes, and household and school latrines, which will be designed to protect water sources\nand reduce health hazards of indiscriminate human waste disposal in rudimentary latrines and\nopen areas. Use of improved latrines would result in the elimination of odors and insect access\nto latrines and waste disposal pits, further adding to the quality of the rural environment. The\nbathhouses  will  have  proper  arrangements  for  wastewater  drainage.  The  flood  control\ncomponent  will  reduce  the  incidence  of  flooding,  and  the  local  rural  road  rehabilitation\ncomponent is expected the improve the village environments.\n91.  The urban subprojects cover small towns and the IEE found that the Project will not\nadversely affect natural resources and will lead to improvements in community health, living\nconditions, and the urban environment. Wastage of water will be reduced, as will environmental\npollution by the interception of wastewater flows and their diversion to the treatment works.\nEffluent quality complies with national and international standards. The Project will have no\ndetrimental effect upon the environment including the fauna and flora of the region.\n92.  The Project is expected to have a significant positive impact on the improvement of the\nenvironment.  The  subprojects  will  include  the  identification  of  any  special  environmental\nconcerns that need  to  be  addressed  during  appraisal,  design,  and  implementation  of  the\nsubprojects, as well as the present environmental management measures. The Government\u2019s\nenvironment  sector  policies,  and  the  capacity  of  the  Government  agencies  involved  are\nadequate. An IEE will be prepared for each subproject in accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines,\nand a determination will be made as to whether the subproject is environmentally sensitive. If it\nis, the IEE will be amplified to address any significant environmental concerns, and if the\nconcerns are extensive, an environmental impact assessment will be prepared as for an ADB\nenvironmental category A project and be approved by ADB. Environmental examination and\nmonitoring procedures established under a previous ADB-financed advisory TA8 will be fully\nutilized.\n2. Social Analysis\n93.  A social analysis following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Incorporation of Social Dimensions and\nHandbook for Incorporation of Social Dimensions in Projects was undertaken to evaluate the\nstatus of infrastructure service delivery and the demands of the people living in the project area.\nDirect views of the community concerned were obtained regarding the infrastructure service\nneeds and willingness to pay fees for the improved services. The results of the social analysis\nare reflected in project formulation as outlined in Appendix 13. The social analysis indicates that\nthe  potential  beneficiaries  show  a  high  level  of  satisfaction  and  support  for  each  project\ncomponent. Water supply, sanitation, flood control, and in selected cases, roads, were given\nhigh priority by the potential beneficiaries.\n                                               \n8  TA 2934-KGZ: Environmental Monitoring and Management Capacity Building, for $598,000, approved on 11\nDecember 1997.", "27\n94.  Rapid appraisal techniques, including rapid social analysis and needs assessment will\nbe undertaken for each subproject prior to its inclusion in the Project. Later, socioeconomic\nsurveys in accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines will be undertaken as part of the detailed analysis\nof affordability required for subproject preparation. The consultants will help the PIUs carry out\nthese  rapid  appraisals  and  surveys.  MAWR  and  ADB  will  monitor  the  socioeconomic\nimplications of the Project through all the processing phases, implementation, and the first year\nof O&M. These socioeconomic surveys, including community participation activities, cover the\nfollowing items: (i) poverty reduction, (ii) improved level of services, (iii) community participation\nin  improved  living  and  health  conditions,  and  (iv)  strengthened  institutional  capacity  and\nfinancial performance. The socioeconomic surveys will determine the prospective beneficiaries\u2019\npresent knowledge of, attitude toward, and practices involving hygiene and sanitation, and will\nassess the requirement for health education and estimate its likely impact. The community\nparticipation approach in each of the communities will ensure that the beneficiaries, CBOs, and\nNGOs are involved in determining an appropriate and affordable service level, and that they are\naware of the cost for the investment and O&M of the subprojects. Consultations and group\nmeetings with major stakeholders were also undertaken during appraisal. The social analysis in\nthe sample communities shows that about 60 percent of the households have monthly income\nof less than Som1,000 and the average household consists of five to six family members. The\nsurveyed households noted the insufficiency of water supply in their community and the need\nfor a 45 percent increase of the existing supply. Fifty-one percent expressed their willingness to\nhave their own house connection. They are willing to pay an average of Som1,000 for a\nconnection,  and  an  average  of  Som30-Som50 for  monthly  water bills;  this  represents,  on\naverage, the actual average expected connection fee and monthly water bills of the subprojects.\nUsing least-cost design and providing for a lifeline tariff for the poorer, the proposed subprojects\nare affordable. The households with house or yard water supply connections will be charged a\nhigher fee than poorer households served by public standpipes. The tariff increases would be\naffordable at 3-5 percent of the monthly household incomes of the poorer population.\n95.  Subproject  design  preparation,  implementation,  and  arrangements  for  O&M  will  be\nundertaken  through  close  consultation  with  the  communities.  They  will  be  involved  in  the\ndecisions about service level and other standards of the systems, including coverage of the\nservice areas and the selection of the sites for public standpipes. Institutional strengthening\nexperts will be part of the consulting teams. As part of the PPMS, socioeconomic surveys are\nplanned in selected communities during implementation and at project completion.\nI. Technical Assistance\n96.  The TA, Institutional Strengthening for Community-Based Infrastructure Services, will be\nprocessed in conjunction with the Project. The TA\u2019s main objective is to strengthen sector\ninstitutions and create the appropriate management systems for smooth project implementation.\nThe TA will focus on (i) preparing and implementing an institutional strengthening program for\nlocal governments and  CBOs;  and  (ii)  helping  vodokanals,  village  local governments,  and\nWUCs  improve  their organizational  structures  and  capacities,  including  strengthening  their\nplanning, budgeting, O&M, and in particular, financial management and billing and collection\nsystems.\n97.  MAWR will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The NWSSC established for the Project\nwill also supervise TA implementation to maximize use of TA findings in local government\nreform.  The  main  beneficiaries  will  be  clients  who  receive  improved  services  due  to\nimplementation  of  revised  management  systems.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  nine\nmonths, commencing three months after project start up. It will require 18 person-months of\ninternational  consulting  inputs  and  40  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  inputs.  The", "28\nconsultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants\nand other arrangements for the engagement of domestic consultants.\n98.  The TA is estimated to cost $765,000 equivalent, of which $537,000 is the foreign\nexchange cost and $228,000 equivalent, the local currency cost. Of this cost, $650,000 will be\nfinanced by ADB on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of\nJapan. This includes the entire foreign exchange cost and $113,000 equivalent of the local\ncurrency cost. The Government will finance the remaining $115,000 equivalent of local currency\ncosts. A detailed TA description is given in Appendix 14.\nV.      PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA. Economic and Financial Analyses\n1. General\n99.  The project beneficiaries  in  seven  small  towns and about  730  villages  will  receive\nimproved access to basic infrastructure services, in particular, reliable and potable piped water\nsupply facilities. While  minimizing  costs, emphasis  will  be  on  rehabilitating  and  upgrading\nexisting  facilities,  with  simple,  cost-effective,  and  least-cost  technology.  The  population\ncoverage in the project area will increase the coverage of piped and safe water supply from the\npresent estimate of 40 percent to 80 percent, and will benefit about 1.5 million persons by 2006.\nThe support for capacity building will enhance the efficiency and sustainability of the sector\nprogram and subprojects.\n100.  The provision of water supply systems under the Project will significantly reduce the time\nspent collecting water, and will directly benefit women and children who share the primary\nresponsibility for carrying water to the household. Sample surveys in the project area indicate\nthat the average household currently spends between one-half and one hour per day collecting\nwater, usually from rivers and irrigation channels. In winter, when water is frozen, water is\ntransported or bought from vendors at about Som5 for the household\u2019s daily needs. Upon\nproject completion, the time allocated and the burden of physical labor borne by women and\nchildren, will be significantly reduced. The time saved will become available to households for\nother economic and social activities, including greater input of labor in industry and agricultural\nactivities, and for child rearing, education, rest, and leisure activities. The contribution of the\nProject to poverty reduction through the release of time for productive economic activities and\neducation will be particularly significant as 70 percent of the residents of the project area are\nliving below the poverty line. The time savings were estimated directly from survey evidence,\nmultiplying the average time spent each day for fetching water by the assumed value of time in\nthe subproject area using an unskilled agricultural wage rate as the value of time.\n101.  The health benefits generated by the Project will be significant, as the incidence of\nillness  associated  with  poor  water  quality  is  currently  high  with  7  percent  of  households\nreporting outbreaks of waterborne diseases that required a full course of treatment in the past\nyear. The Project will contribute to reduced morbidity and mortality, particularly the high infant\nmorbidity rate in poor areas in the country. To the extent that the reduction of time spent on\ncollecting water can be devoted to rest and leisure activities, improvements in the health of\nwomen and children can be anticipated. The provision of health and hygiene education will\nfurther  improve  health  levels  and  particularly  benefit  women.  The  direct  health  benefits\nassociated with the Project by reducing illness will provide the basis for additional poverty\nreduction and economic benefits by increasing capacity for income generation and education.\nThe Project\u2019s health and hygiene education program will complement and reinforce the health", "29\nand economic benefits associated with the water supply component, and ensure that the initial\ngains provided can be sustained and enhanced.\n102.  The economic and financial analysis of the selected core subprojects carried out during\nproject preparation has established the viability of the Project. Based on a methodology of\nquantifiable benefits that was not able to incorporate the health benefits, the economic internal\nrates of return for the 10 core subprojects were estimated to range from 13 to 38 percent. These\nare higher than the 12 percent economic opportunity cost of capital. The economic analysis was\ndone in constant 1999 prices using a domestic price numeraire. The financial internal rates of\nreturn for the 10 core subprojects were estimated at between 5 and 14 percent, and will exceed\nthe weighted average cost of capital of about 1 percent. The economic internal rates of return\nand  financial  internal  rates  of  return  were  subjected  to  sensitivity  analysis  and  remain\nacceptable under adverse circumstances. While it has not been possible to quantify the health\nbenefits  associated  with  the  Project,  their  qualitative  impact  is  significant,  which  further\nenhances the Project\u2019s economic viability. Details of the economic and financial analyses are in\nAppendix 15.\n103.  The results of socioeconomic surveys covering the core subprojects indicate that the\nbeneficiaries give high priority to the development of adequate water supply and sanitation\nfacilities. In workshop consultations, the communities have indicated their willingness to assume\nfull responsibility for O&M of the subprojects, and pay user charges to cover investment and\nO&M costs, including depreciation costs in order to maintain the systems in the future. The\nGovernment will ensure that the vodokanals and local governments will be responsible for O&M\nin  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  existing  policy.  This  policy  reinforces  community\ninvolvement by creating a direct and transparent link between the collection of consumer fees\nfrom the community, and the application of such funds toward O&M of the subproject. To\nassess the impact of this policy on consumer affordability, tariff requirements were estimated for\nthe core subprojects. The average monthly tariff required to cover the full cost of the water\nsupply  system  was  estimated  to  be  Som45  per  household.  Within  this  sample  group  of\nschemes, the required monthly tariff ranged from a low of Som16 to a high of Som87 per\nhousehold, depending on the technology used and the economies of scale of the subproject.\nThe analysis of the ability to pay indicates that the tariffs required are consistent with generally\naccepted guidelines, which consider the cost of water supply as affordable if the charge does\nnot exceed about 3 to 5 percent of the monthly income of low-income groups. The highest\nproposed tariff in the sample group, Som87 per month for a system of mostly yard connections\npreferred by the community, represents 3 percent of the income of an average household of that\ncommunity. Poorer households will be served from public standpipes and charged less, keeping\nwithin the affordability criteria. At present, the cost would be approximately Som150 per month\nfor households getting water from water vendors. About 15 percent of the households are\ngetting drinking water from water vendors.\n2. Water Pricing and Revenues\n104.  The Project will be fully self-financing, as water tariffs will be set to recover full costs. In\nboth urban and rural areas, the local governments and WUCs will ensure proper O&M and the\nsetting and collection of water tariffs to cover O&M costs, including depreciation. The tariffs are\nto be  determined  during  the  preparation  of  the  subprojects  in  coordination  with  the  local\ngovernments and vodokanals, and will cover capital and O&M costs, including depreciation. The\nwater tariffs will be collected monthly. Beneficiaries consuming water from public standpipes will\nbe charged a standard fixed monthly rate. The water revenues will be kept in a separate bank\naccount. The treasurer will be authorized to release funds for the monthly O&M expenditures.\nThe tariffs are to be collected monthly, however if a household fails to pay for a period of two", "30\nmonths, its house or yard connection, if provided, will be disconnected until its accounts have\nbeen fully paid. Peer pressure from the fully paying households will be utilized to effectively\nprevent nonpaying households from using the public standpipe facilities.\n105.  The Government intends to finance 90 percent of the capital cost to be recovered by the\nwater tariffs; the communities will contribute 10 percent as equity in cash or kind. This level of\ninvestment costs is fully justified considering (i) that the facilities play a major role in serving\nbasic needs and reducing waterborne diseases, and (ii) the time demands for collecting water.\nThe general affordability criterion limits tariffs to 3 to 5 percent of the household\u2019s monthly\nincome. The percentage would be 3 to 5 percent of the income of the poorest beneficiaries\ncharged a lifeline tariff. The households with house or yard water supply connections will be\ncharged a higher fee than poorer households served by public standpipes. The tariffs will be set\nin such a way that the water charges will finance not only O&M costs but also the replacement\nof capital investments through depreciation. The vodokanals and WUCs will collect the tariffs\nmonthly and deposit the funds in a separate bank account. The level of tariffs was tested during\nthe review of the core subprojects and was found to be within affordable limits. The analysis of\nwillingness-to-pay and affordability shows that full cost recovery is feasible over a five-year\nperiod of gradual tariff adjustments. For all core subprojects, the proposed average price of\nwater exceeds the average incremental costs, which indicates that the subprojects will not\nrequire any subsidy.\nB. Environment\n106.  Environmental  concerns,  for  which  appropriate  safeguards  will  be  built  into  the\nsubproject designs, include (i) protection of environmentally sensitive areas around the water\nsources,  (ii)  provision for  the  proper collection  and  disposal  of  wastewater,  (iii)  controlled\nextraction from groundwater sources, and (iv) safeguarding the interests of downstream users\nof  spring  sources.  The  Project  is  expected  to  have  a  significant  positive  impact  on  the\nenvironment. In addition, the Project\u2019s impact on poverty reduction, public health, and women in\ndevelopment will be positive.\nC. Social Dimensions\n1. Impact on Poverty\n107.  A total of about 70 percent of the households in the project communities are living below\nthe  poverty  line,  about  75  percent  in  rural  areas  and  about  60  percent  in  urban  areas.\nDeficiencies  in  community  infrastructure  impact  disproportionately  on  the  poor.  As  these\nfacilities are improved, for example, as water supply coverage is increased from 40 percent to\n80 percent, a proportionately higher percentage of the poor will benefit under the Project.\nAccordingly,  more  than  70  percent  of  the  beneficiaries  are  expected  to  be  poor.  The\nimprovement  of  water  supply  facilities  in  the  project  communities  would  also  provide\nemployment opportunities and enhance economic growth. During the implementation period,\nthere will be a demand for assistance to help plan and construct the facilities and in capacity-\nbuilding activities. There will also be employment opportunities during O&M of the constructed\nfacilities. Further, the Project\u2019s hygiene and sanitation education program stresses the need to\nadopt proper sanitary practices. This will lead to environmental improvements, added health\nbenefits, and increased productivity, resulting in direct economic benefits. The provision of\npublic standpipes and affordable tariffs to be established through the institutional development\nprogram will ensure that the beneficiary poor population will have access to water supply\nfacilities at affordable prices.", "31\n2. Human Development\n108.  In addition to health-related benefits, the Project will contribute to human development\nby  improving  living  standards,  improving  quality  of  life,  and  increasing  productivity.  With\nimproved water supply facilities, the incidence of waterborne diseases will decrease over time.\nAlthough the Project focuses on water supply facilities, its real impact will depend on proper use\nand  maintenance  of  the  subprojects.  Accordingly,  the  Project  includes  the  institutional\ndevelopment program for local governments and other capacity building support.\n3. Gender and Development\n109.  The Project will contribute to more equitable distribution of water to the beneficiaries.\nWomen and children in particular will benefit from the water supply improvements as collection\nand storage of water is mainly their responsibility. The improved water supply services will save\ntime and reduce the physical burden on women, enabling them to engage in more fulfilling and\nproductive activities. As women have considerable influence on the  behavioral  patterns of\ncommunities, they have an important role as teachers and disseminators of information on\nbetter hygiene practices and proper use of water supply facilities. Women\u2019s role in child care will\nbe made easier through better health of children expected from safe, potable, piped water\nsupply  brought  by  the  Project.  Women\u2019s  organizations  will  be  involved  in  leadership\ndevelopment and in training women for regular participation in local governments, WUCs, and\nvodokanal meetings. Women will also be part of the boards of WUCs and vodokanals.\nD. Risks\n110.  Three possible project risks have been identified: (i) delay in project implementation\ncaused by lack of institutional capability to implement, operate, and maintain the water supply\nsystems, (ii) delay in project implementation caused by lack of local counterpart funds, and (iii)\nlimited financial capacity to cope with the expansion of the water supply systems. The risk of\ndelays in project implementation has been addressed through a clear delineation of agency\nresponsibilities and appropriate mechanisms for coordination. Considerable preparatory work\nhas  already  been  undertaken;  information  has  been  obtained  from  the  potential  project\ncommunities regarding the present status of water supply facilities, and an initial assessment of\nrequired development has  been  carried  out.  Substantial  support  will  also  be  provided  for\ncapacity building through training programs and consulting services. Through O&M training\nprograms, local water supply system operators will be trained to ensure their involvement in\nO&M of the water supply systems. The possibility of delays in implementation caused by lack of\nlocal counterpart funds has been addressed. The local counterpart fund requirements are small\nand can be provided in  cash or  in  kind through  labor,  local  building  materials,  and  land.\nMeasures to reduce possible delays have been discussed with the Government. The issue of\nfinancial capability has been dealt with by including the institutional development program,\nwhich should strengthen the capacity to cope with the O&M of the expanded water supply\nsystems. The Project is also planned to be intensively monitored, with at least two field reviews\nevery year, throughout its implementation.\nVI.  ASSURANCES\nA. Specific Assurances\n111.  The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:", "32\n(i)  Within six months of loan effectiveness, the Government will issue a decree on\nProject implementation, satisfactory to ADB, clearly specifying (a) the respective\nroles  and  responsibilities  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  MAWR,  oblast\nadministrations concerned, and other relevant agencies in implementation of the\nProject;  (b)  flow  of  funds  between  such  parties;  and  (c)  cost  recovery\narrangements.\n(ii)  The local governments will increase the  supply  of  water  to  residents  in  the\nrelevant subproject area who are living below the poverty levels (as defined by\nthe Government) by expanding the public standpipe program.\n(iii)  In implementing the Project, consideration will be given to environmental aspects\nin  strict  conformity  with  the  Government\u2019s  national  environmental  impact\nstandards.

The  project  performance  monitoring  system  (PPMS)  plan  covers  project  targets,\nperformance indicators, and monitoring mechanisms. PPMS activities will be overseen by the\nNational Water Supply and Sanitation Committee and a PPMS team involving individuals from\nprovincial departments, the project management unit (PMU), the project implementation units\n(PIUs), and consultants from the accompanying technical assistance (TA). The PMU will have\noverall responsibility for overseeing and coordinating the PPMS efforts. Responsibilities for data\ncollection, analysis, and reporting will be delineated for each level of government participating in\nthe project activities. A plan for monitoring, evaluating, and reporting, including a time frame,\nresources  required,  and  persons  responsible  will  be  prepared  within  six  months  of  loan\neffectiveness. The project framework has been matched with monitoring indicators and targets\nused in the PPMS. Successful implementation of the PPMS will require the close cooperation\nand  participation  of  the  national  Government,  local  governments,  and  the  beneficiary\ncommunities. Training workshops will be conducted in each province to address the structure,\nprocess, and intended purpose of the PPMS; data collection issues; use of key social indicators;\nand implications of PPMS analysis for targeting and managing resources.\n2.  The team will work with the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources and local\ngovernments  to  establish  appropriate  organizational  arrangements  for  the  PPMS.  It  is\nenvisioned that primary data collection and processing activities will be based at the PIUs, with\nassistance from local governments and the community as necessary. Analysis will be conducted\nat the PMU level. Training workshops will be conducted with designated government officials at\nthe national and province levels to develop the capacity to use the PPMS to target and manage\nproject resources. Significant participation during all phases will therefore be required from the\nGovernment and the beneficiary communities. A combination of data sources will be used,\nincluding (i) a project management information system; (ii) routine statistics; and (iii) household,\nfacility, and special surveys where required. Since the present Project comprises about 240\nrural and 7 urban subprojects, impact evaluations are proposed by surveying a representative\nsample  of  the  subproject  areas.  In  general,  where  surveys  are  used,  the  social  surveys\nconducted as part of subproject implementation will be used to measure baseline conditions\nprior to project intervention. Following the implementation of the project impact surveys will be\nundertaken to measure the effects. Table A12 provides some examples of each type of project\nperformance indicators appropriate for each subsector, as well as the source from which they\ncan be  obtained.  Four broad categories of  impact  indicators  corresponding  to  the  project\nobjectives are proposed: (i) poverty reduction, (ii) community participation in improved living and\nhealth conditions, (iii) improved levels of service, and (iv) strengthened institutional capacity and\nfinancial performance.\nTable A12: Proposed Project Performance Indicators\nImpact Project Indicator Measures Source of Data\nComponent\n\u2022 Poverty Rural Water Prioritize rural poor in \u2022  Percentage of poor population Social survey\nReduction Supply program served\n\u2022 Improved \u2022  Number of poor beneficiaries\nLevels of \u2022  Water consumption per capita\nService by rural poverty groups\n\u2022 Community \u2022  Total water sales to rural\nParticipation poverty groups\n\u2022 Strengthen \u2022  Standpipes provided to rural\nInstitutional poverty groups\nCapacity Release time for poor \u2022  Time savings collecting water Social survey\nto increase productive\nby rural poverty groups\neconomic \u2022  Percentage of registration of\nactivity/education\nland shares by households\nheaded by women", "56\nAppendix 12, page 2\nImpact Project Indicator Measures Source of Data\nComponent\nRural Prioritize rural poor in \u2022  Number of ventilated improved Social survey\nSanitation, program pit latrines constructed by rural\nBathhouses poverty groups.\nReduce mortality and \u2022  Overall mortality and morbidity Social survey\nmorbidity among poor rates among rural poverty\ngroups.\n\u2022  Child and infant morbidity rates\namong rural poverty groups\nRural Flood Prioritize rural poor in \u2022  Subprojects completed in Social survey\nControl program villages with above average\nMeasures poverty levels\nRural Local Prioritize rural poor in \u2022  Subprojects completed in Social survey\nRoads program villages with above average\npoverty levels\nUrban Water Prioritize rural poor in \u2022  Percentage of poor population Social survey\nSupply program served\n\u2022  Number of poor beneficiaries\n\u2022  Water consumption per capita\nby urban poverty groups\n\u2022  Total water sales to urban\npoverty groups\n\u2022  Subprojects completed\n\u2022  Town systems\nrehabilitated/extended\n\u2022  Standpipes provided\n\u2022  Yard connections provided\n\u2022  Time savings collecting water\nIncreased time for\nby urban poverty groups\npoor to increase\nproductive economic\nactivity and education\nUrban Prioritize rural poor in \u2022  Percentage of poor population Social survey\nSewerage program served\n\u2022  Number of poor beneficiaries\n\u2022  Water consumption per capita\nby urban poverty groups\n\u2022  Total water sales to urban\npoverty groups\n\u2022  Overall mortality and morbidity\nrates among urban poverty\nReduce mortality and groups\nmorbidity among poor \u2022  Child and infant morbidity rates\namong urban poverty groups\nCapacity Prioritize outreach to \u2022  Water users council Social survey\nBuilding poverty groups (WUC)/other community\nProgram representatives from rural and\nurban poverty groups  trained\nHygiene and Prioritize outreach to \u2022  WUC and other community Social survey\nSanitation poverty groups representatives from rural and\nEducation urban poverty groups\nProgram educated", "Appendix 13, page 1\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS\nA.  Outline of Report\n1.  The report covers the findings of detailed household surveys carried out between April\nand May 1999 with 1,113 households in 11 villages and 400 households in two towns in the\nthree project provinces (oblasts). It is primarily concerned with socioeconomic issues related to\nthe degree and distribution of poverty and social equity, and how this impacts on the provision\nof basic infrastructure services. The report examines how the incidence of poverty, its nature,\nand the mutual support systems influence the design of the Project and the risks to which it is\nexposed. The report draws on the report, 1998 Poverty in the Kyrgyz Republic (November\n1999). It compares the data collected by the consultants, and uses the 1998 updated figures for\npoverty  provided  by  the  National  Statistical  Committee  (NATSTATKOM)  Kyrgyz  Poverty\nMonitoring Survey office. It also considers the impact of the policy of making beneficiaries pay\nthe  full  costs  of  water  provision,  and  the  position  of  women  in  the  development  and\nmanagement of water systems.\nB.  Background\n2.  Since independence, the Government has pursued policies to restructure the economy,\nredistribute rural land, and decentralize power to local authorities. The consequence has been\nthe laying off of some workers and the closing of many factories, as well as the break up of the\nsovkhoze and kolkhoze (state and communal farms) and the handover of communal property to\nlocal authorities. Without the massive support from the central administration of the former\nSoviet Union (FSU), the Kyrgyz Republic has been unable to maintain services and basic\nutilities. While payment for services was always officially the policy, tariffs were nominal and\ninsufficient,  even  when  collected,  to  cover  the  full  cost  of  operation  and  maintenance.\nConsequently much of the infrastructure has ceased to function. Likewise community facilities\nhave deteriorated and the services provided are grossly underfunded. Health posts have no\nmedicines and schools lack equipment.\n3.  While the economy began to show some signs of recovery in 1996/1997, this was\nslowed or even reversed by the Russian monetary crisis and the customs disputes with its\u2019\nneighboring countries following the acceptance of the Kyrgyz Republic as the first country from\nthe FSU to become a member of the World Trade Organization. The full impact of that is only\nnow being felt. Inflation did improve and dropped from 62 percent in 1994, to 13 percent by the\nend of 1997. While it rose slightly in 1998, the full impact of the problems identified was not felt\nuntil 1999. In the first nine months of 1999, inflation was reported at 40 percent. The greatest\ninflation has been in the food sector. Although the Government claims that the country meets 60\npercent of its food needs, there is no evidence that the benefits of the relatively faster increase\nin food prices has benefited the rural areas. The report 1998 Poverty in the Kyrgyz Republic\nidentified insignificant increase in the national poverty level including the proportion of the\npopulation living in extreme poverty1 between 1997 and 1998. The general poverty level for the\ncountry as a whole increased from 51.0 percent in 1997 to 63.6 percent in 1998, and the\nextreme poverty increased from 14.8 percent to 23.0 percent. The poverty that exists is not\nevenly spread. It is considered to be a predominantly rural phenomenon. However, in urban\nareas the percentage of poor has increased substantially, from 28.5 percent in 1997 to 50.7\npercent in 1998.\n                                               \n1  Extreme poverty is defined as the situation when all resources are devoted to food, yet the minimum caloric\nvalues cannot be met. The general poverty line is based on the same basic caloric requirement and the level of\nresources required to cover minimal needs for expenditure on taxes, utilities, clothing, transport, social, health,\nand education services. In 1997 the extreme poverty level was Som2,439  per person per year, and Som2,595 in\n1998. The general poverty level was Som4,647 and Som4,944 in the same years, respectively. 1998 Poverty in\nthe Kyrgyz Republic, NATSTATKOM, November 1999.", "Appendix 13, page 2\nTable A13.1: Poverty by Geographic Area, 1997-1998\nUrban and Rural Split 1997-98\nAll Poor Extremely Poor\nYear Urban Rural Total Urban Rural Total\n1997 28.5 64.5 51.0 4.9 20.7 14.8\n1998 50.7 71.3 63.6 18.3 25.8 23.0\nSource: 1998 Poverty in the Kyrgyz Republic, November 1999.\nTable A13.2: Poverty by Province, 1998\nProvince Poor Extremely Poor\nBishkek 28.9 36.5\nIssyk-Kul 68.8 16.5\nJalal-Abad 72.3 29.3\nNaryn 89.1 42.6\nOsh 81.2 31.3\nTalas 82.1 48.8\nChui 37.6 8.1\nSource: 1998 Poverty in the Kyrgyz Republic, November 1999.\n4.  Further, not all poverty indicators reflect the reported poverty. Malnutrition would be\nexpected to closely reflect the distribution of extreme poverty, although unpublished data for\n1998 from the Safety Net Project of NATSTATKOM shows that almost the opposite is true. The\ngreatest incidence of malnutrition found among children less than 7 years old and those 7 to 11\nis highest in Bishkek with 12.4 and 12.0 percent, respectively, while it is lowest in Talas for the\nyounger  group,  and  in  Naryn  for  the  older  group.  In  both  categories,  the  incidence  of\nmalnutrition recorded by the poorest oblast is smaller the median figure. Jalal-Abad, which has\na high level of extreme poverty, has the second lowest incidence of malnutrition for the zero to\nsix age category, but does less well with the older group. In both groups, Chui has a high level\nof malnutrition (9.8 percent in both categories). This apparent contradiction is hard to explain,\nexcept possibly that the incidence of large families is less frequently reported in Bishkek and\nChui,2 where average family size is smaller than the national average. This paradox needs\ncareful consideration for it could suggest an underrecording of nutrition intake by rural families\nthat rely more on self-grown produce.\n5.  Nationally, food consumption represents 58 percent of total consumption. Overall, 80\npercent of all food consumed is purchased. However, for the extreme poor and the poor, a\ngreater proportion of food is self-produced (27.8 percent for the extreme poor as opposed to\n15.4 percent for the nonpoor). Of all households, 6.2 percent of expenditure is for utilities.\nHowever, this is lower (4.6 and 5.3 percent) for the extreme poor and all poor. This low level of\nexpenditure is explained by the fact that 80 percent of the poor are found in rural areas, where\nthere is often no, or an irregular, supply of electricity, and where piped water supply systems\nexist many are nonfunctional. Education on the other hand represents over 10 percent of the\nconsumption of all poor, as opposed to 7 percent for the nonpoor. Education also appears to\ncorrelate with the incidence of poverty. Those who stopped education at the secondary level or\nbefore are considerably more likely to be poor (58.4 percent) than those who received some\nhigher education (36.9 percent). Enrollment data suggests that while there is little difference in\nthe rate of enrollment of those below the age of 16, there is a substantial difference after the\nage of 16. This suggests that those who are from poor families are more likely to remain poor.\n6.  The most substantial increase in employment between 1997 and 1998 was in the rural\nareas, however, this may be either because of high underemployment or the seasonal nature of\nemployment  in  rural  areas.  In  rural  areas,  reliance  on  agricultural  wages  appears  to  be\n                                               \n2\n  In Osh and Jalal-Abad oblasts, the survey of villages found that the average size of households were 5.7 and 5.6\nrespectively, whereas in Chui, the average household size was 4.4 persons.", "Appendix 13, page 3\nassociated with greater poverty. Poor households are likely to have less wage incomes than\nnonpoor households. In general, households headed by women are less likely to be poor than\nmale. This is explained as being due to the system of help, which is more likely to be given to\nhouseholds headed by women. Size of land holding was also not found to be associated with\npoverty in the rural areas. This may be reflected in poverty distribution, with Naryn displaying\nthe highest levels of poverty and the lowest level of population density. This is further confirmed\nby the fact that the main form of agriculture is livestock farming; on average, the extremely poor\nhave access to more pasture land than the other groups. Concern has been expressed in other\nAsian Development Bank (ADB) social analysis over the distribution of land in rural areas, which\nwas initially distributed by means of a share for all those working on the sovkhoze or kolkhoze,\nbut which now is consolidated in the name of the head of household. This may mean that\nwomen will lose rights over land should the family break up, however, this is dismissed by\nofficials in the southern oblasts because it is argued that men are more likely to leave the home\nand so give up these rights.\nC.  Profile of the Beneficiaries\n1.  Income and Living Standards\n7.  The  survey  carried  out  in  the  selected  villages  and  two  towns  cannot  be  directly\ncompared with the data collected as part of the 1998 Poverty in the Kyrgyz Republic report. It\nmeasured both reported cash incomes and expenditures, and did not measure consumption.\nHowever, the survey did measure expenditure, and included gifts and assistance received as\nincome. Average household incomes for both towns were Som1,013 per month. Considerable\ndifferences are found with Uzghen recording Som841 per month and Kant Som1,186. Median\nincomes were considerably lower with the overall figure being Som850, made up of Som800 in\nUzghen and Som930 in Kant. Average expenditures levels, as recorded in the survey, are close\nto income. The major difference between expenditures as used for the survey and consumption\nas used for the 1998 poverty report is that the former did not include self-grown produce.\nHowever, for comparison, it is possible to assume that total consumption is approximately 9 to\n16 percent higher than the expenditure data would suggest. It is assumed that the income and\nexpenditure data provided was in large part (where the expenditure is annual or seasonal)\nbased on the respondents memory of what they spent or received in 1998.\n8.  Based on these assumptions, the survey suggests that poverty in the southern urban\nareas is far more widespread. In both towns together, over 38 percent would appear to be living\nin extreme poverty,3 while over 70 percent are living in poverty.4 These percentages differ\nmarkedly between Kant in the north and Uzghen, in the south. In Uzghen, 95 percent are living\nbelow the general poverty line, while in Kant, with slightly more than half the population is living\nin poverty. The figures for the southern town may be exaggerated by the use of the national\npoverty level, as food prices in particular are considerably lower.\n9.  Overall, in the urban areas, 63 percent of income is spent on food. This varies little\nbetween the two towns, but is higher than the average for the country as a whole. However, it is\nvery close to the adjusted figure5 for poor households, which suggests that poverty may well be\nas widespread as recorded in the survey. Thirteen percent of income is spent on utilities,\nincluding heating, cooking fuels or power, water, and electricity, with the figure being lower in\nthe southern town of Uzghen (11 percent) than in the northern town of Kant (15 percent). Six\npercent is spent on education in the two urban areas. This is substantially less than reported for\nthe whole of the country.\n                                               \n3\n  Unconfirmed figure from NATSTATKOM of between Som245 to Som250 per person per month for 1998.\n4\nUnconfirmed figure from NATSTATKOM of Som450 per person per month for 1998.\n5  Excluding home production consumption, the poor use 66 percent of their resources on food.", "Appendix 13, page 4\n10.  Uzghen, the poorer town, has an average household size of 5.3, whereas in Kant it is\n3.3. While Uzghen has a higher number of persons earning per family, of those contributing\nincome, only 30 percent are working full time. In Kant, however, 60 percent are full time.\nUzghen is heavily dependent on seasonal work, which suggests a possible underrecording of\nincome and expenditure. Forty-one percent of all contribute income, and 47 percent of all\nhouseholds  contain  seasonal  workers.  Uzghen  also  has  a  higher  number  of  pensioners,\nreflecting more traditional extended family patterns. Thirty-eight percent of all households in\nUzghen include one or more pensioners. In Kant, no seasonal workers were recorded, and 27.5\npercent of households contained pensioners. Including pensioners, part-time  and  seasonal\nworkers, the dependency ratio for Uzghen is 1.8, whereas in Kant it is 3.1. However, with the\nhigher number of full-time employees and the smaller household size, poverty appears less\nsevere in the northern sample town.\n11.  In the rural areas, for all the villages surveyed, 52 percent of expenditures were for food.\nThis varies from 57 percent in Osh, to 54 percent in Jalal-Abad and only 45 percent in Chui.\nPresent levels of expenditure on utilities amount to 12 percent of the total. This is considerably\nhigher than reported in the poverty report. This varies from 9 percent in Osh where because of\nthe poor state of the water services, expenditure appears low, to 16 percent in Jalal-Abad and\n10 percent in Chui. Education accounts for 13 percent and is similar to the adjusted figure6 for\nthe poor as reported in the poverty report. This varies from 9 percent in Osh, to 16 percent in\nJalal-Abad and 13 percent in Chui.\n12.  No analysis is possible of the actual per capita expenditures, which could be used to\nestablish the percentage of households in poverty. However, based on the higher figures for\nincome and expenditure in all the villages surveyed, it is possible to establish an average per\ncapita sum available. The average per capita available per month is Som185. Adjusted, this\nwould appear to give an average consumption equivalent to approximately Som220 per capita\nper month, below the unconfirmed extreme poverty level of Som245 per month. However, in\nChui, the average per capita income available is Som340, which adjusted is equivalent to\nSom392. This is still below the unconfirmed general poverty level, but not as extreme as for the\nsouthern oblasts. These figures, even if underrecording the total value of consumption, suggest\nthat these villages suffer severe poverty.\n13.  While the villages chosen all suffer from substantially nonfunctioning or no water supply\nsystems, there would appear to be a close connection between this fact and the prevalence of\npoverty. However,  the relatively low level of malnutrition in the poorer rural dominated oblasts\nsuggests a more complex situation. In many villages, substantial funds have been raised in\ncash, produce, labor, and use of machinery to extend or develop water systems. Unseasonal\nrains in 1998 affected many farming areas and resulted in low yields, hence reducing the\nincome of many farmers. The figures do suggest, however, that care will need to be taken to\nallow some cross-subsidy within the individual systems, from those who are better off and may\nrequest individual connections and those who will collect their water from public standpipes.\n2.  The Role of Women in Water Usage and Sanitation\n14.  Women  are  most  frequently  the  household  member  most  affected  by  the  lack  of\nadequate clean and safe water. Not only are they most often responsible for collecting water,\nbut they must also care for members of the family who fall sick as a consequence of the polluted\nwater  and  inadequate  sanitation  facilities.  Further,  they  are  most  likely  to  train  the  next\ngeneration on good sanitary practices and so protects them from the risk of illness. In the\nsurveyed villages, women were the most frequent primary collectors of water (40 percent).\nHowever, in over a fifth of all households it was the adult males. Children collected water in 15\n                                               \n6\nAdjusted to exclude home production consumption.", "Appendix 13, page 5\npercent of cases. There is, however, a difference in practices between the north and the south.\nIn the south the adult women were the primary collectors in over 41 percent of households. In\nthe north, adult men were more frequently the main collectors of water (31 percent of cases),\nwhile women were the primary collectors in only 25 percent. This disparity is a reflection of the\nstrength of more traditional family structures that exist in the south. In the two towns surveyed,\nthe picture is similar, with the divide between the north and the south. Overall, adult women\nwere the main collectors of water when there was no individual connection (in 45 percent). In\nthe south in 50 percent of the cases it was the women and only 9 percent the men, while in the\nnorthern town, men and women shared this task equally, relying also less on the help of\nchildren. These figures suggest a clear need to ensure women are involved in the design of\nwater supply systems and in the management of the system.\n15.  In most villages, women are severely underrepresented on the village councils. In recent\nlocal elections in the pilot villages in the southern oblasts, very few women stood for office and\nfewer were elected. In three villages visited, one had one member on a 16-person council,\nanother had one for a 21-person council, while another had one candidate who had been\nunsuccessful for an 18-person council. Such traditional prejudice against women at this level of\nlocal  government  suggests  a  need  to  develop  special  institutional  arrangements  for  the\nmanagement of water supply systems if women\u2019s needs are to be given greater importance.\nDuring Soviet times, women\u2019s committees were established in all communities. Their main\nfunction was to ensure that good practices were observed in the home, in particular cleanliness.\nThey also acted as a welfare agency, providing assistance to those most in need. These have\ncontinued in most villages until today. However, being top-down appointments, these frequently\nhave little true support. In some villages though, it was found that these organizations have\nbecome quite strong and are effective in mobilizing women and assisting them develop small\neconomic activities. In the projects initiated by the International Secretariat for Water and funded\nby United Nations Children\u2019s Fund and supported by United States Agency for International\nDevelopment (USAID), in the south, women have become the leaders of some of the local\nnongovernment organizations (NGOs) and play an active part in the water users councils that\nhave been established. From the reports of the social organizations of the core subproject\nvillages, women expressed a clear desire to play a central role in the planning and management\nof water systems.\n3.  Community Structures and the Social Support System\n16.  Under the constitution each village (ayil okmotu) is governed by a village council (ayil\nkenesh).  The  council  is  headed  by  the  chairperson of the  council  (bashchy).  The  council\nformally elects the head of the village council. The elected head of the village council forms the\nvillage administration, and on recommendation of the head of rayon (district) administration the\nsession of village government appoints the chair of the village council as chief executive of the\nayil okmotu bashchy for the same period of time. Village government and its community elect its\nown village committee out of 3-5 people, and each settlement identifies its own village captain\n(ayil bashchy). The ayil bashchy is responsible for ensuring that the programs of the village\ncouncil are implemented. According to the work regiment of ayil okmoto, the ayil bashchy can\nhave paid staff if the settlement is located 4.5 km away from the administrative center. In other\nsituations the ayil bashchy works with volunteers. In the restructuring of the sovkhozes and\nkolkhozes, all land is being distributed to the workers, while the local government (ayil okmotu)\ncan retain 25 percent on which it may earn income by letting it out to farmers or for grazing and\nsimilar purposes. In many areas, the local government retained an interest in technical service\nenterprises and seed farms. Irrigation services are now being organized with the establishment\nof water users associations made up of local farmers.", "Appendix 13, page 6\n17.  The ayil kenesh is responsible for preparing a balanced budget. The budget covers the\ncosts of the local administration, including the cost of the staff. In addition to the administration\nstaff, the village budget can support health workers, medical staff of the village clinic and\nhospital, library, clubs, bathhouses (banyas), and technical school support staff. It can also be\nused to rehabilitate schools, health posts, clinics, and local village roads. However, the teaching\nand administrative staff of schools are paid from the rayon budget. The income of the village\nadministration comes from  the rayon.  However,  the  amount  received  represents  up  to 25\npercent of the earnings of the village from the land tax, and 100 percent of income comes from\nsuch sources as different fees and service charges, rent, and any profits from commercial\noperations received by the ayil okmoto. The payment of taxes includes both current taxes and\nthe repayment of arrears.\n18.  Informal and traditional community-based organizations (CBOs) are playing a large role\nin the development of rural and urban areas. In most rural communities there are several CBOs\noperating. Many CBOs were developed during Soviet times. Examples of these are women\u2019s\ncommittees,  veteran\u2019s  councils,  youth  committees,  and kwartels  (block organizations).  The\nkwartels reflect other traditional CBOs such as those based on the uruu (a family subgroup, who\ntraditionally  live  together as  a  nomadic  subtribe),  or  the  onbashy  (another  form  of  family\nsubgroup), or  the mahalla  (the neighborhood organization,  which has  its  roots  in  Moslem\norganizational structures). An important CBO is the traditional elders council (aksaldar sotu).\nThe main function of the aksaldar is to resolve conflicts and disputes before cases are taken to\na higher authority or the courts. They also protect traditions and set community values. These\nare well recognized and respected in most parts of the country, and are expected to play an\nimportant role in mobilizing community support for infrastructure projects in the villages. It is\nthrough these informal organizations that the traditional self-help (ashar) system is arranged to\nundertake work necessary for the whole community.\n19.  Two influential organizations operate in the schools. These are the parent\u2019s committees\nand school pedagogical councils. The parent\u2019s committee is an annually elected committee for\neach school year, which is established at a school meeting. The chair of the committee should\nbe included on the school pedagogical council. This committee provides a board for the school,\nwhich decides on the level of contribution to be made by each parent and the use of the money\nso raised. The money raised could be used to upgrade sanitation. However, a growing number\nof informal CBOs have begun to emerge with the transfer of powers and assets to the local\ngovernment level, especially at this time of financial deprivation. It is increasingly recognized\nthat rural communities must rely on their own resources. This suggests a major shift in the\nthinking of people in the villages. Many of the leaders of these informal action-oriented NGOs\nare women. Supporting this move has been the increased use of NGOs for channeling funds\nfrom international funding agencies, in particular bilateral funding sources, such as USAID and\nHelvetas. The local NGOs are, however, generally weak. With the use of NGOs as channels for\nassistance, a number of NGOs were established for the sole purpose of enabling the founders\nto access the funds available, but with little ability to aid the development process. Under the\npresent tax code, NGOs are treated as any other commercial company that must pay income\nand profit (corporation) tax on its earnings over its expenditures. This makes efforts by NGOs to\nundertake some commercial activities to fund future projects nearly impossible.7 Exemption from\nthis ruling can only be achieved by a special Government decree.\n                                               \n7  Despite these difficulties, a number of NGOs are working successfully to help local community based NGOs set\nup water users councils and associations to develop clean water. Examples can be found in Alay rayon, Osh\noblast, where the International Water Secretariat and USAID through counterpart consortium have assisted Atajurt\nestablish water systems in five villages.", "Appendix 13, page 7\n4.  Water Sources and Availability\n20.  In the villages surveyed, only 32 percent of households had access to a piped water\nsupply system. Thirty-three percent use the river and a further 9 percent irrigation channels.\nFifteen percent had water delivered by truck. The remainder used private wells or other sources.\nTwenty-seven percent of all households had to travel more than a kilometer to the source, while\nless than half were within 200 meters of their main source of water. Approximately 57 percent\nthought their water tasted, looked, and smelled good, while around 15 percent thought they had\nbad water. The remainder were ambivalent. Sixty percent complained that their main source of\nwater was not available all year. The main reasons given were the poor state of the equipment\nand freezing of the source. In urban areas, 40 percent had individual connections to their house\nor yard, while 41 percent had access to water from a public standpipe in the street. However, 19\npercent had no convenient or safe supply. Some of those who used the public standpipe had to\nwalk more than 300 meters, and 6 percent had to travel more than 1 kilometer to collect water.\nThirty-six  percent  complained  that  water  was  not  available  all  year,  primarily  because  of\ninadequate pressure due to the poor equipment or lack of capacity. While 78 percent were\nhappy with the quality of water, 11 percent thought it bad, which suggests that most who\nreceived piped water were happy with its quality, if not with its regularity.\n5.  Sewerage and Sanitation Services\n21.  In all the villages surveyed, almost all households used simple pits, which once full, are\ncovered and a new one is dug. The most frequent form of wastewater disposal is to throw it in\nthe yard or into an open pit in the garden. Only 2 percent have septic tanks. The majority (about\ntwo thirds) bathe at home, while 32 percent use public or private bathhouses. When asked\nwhere they would prefer to bathe, 68 percent mentioned public bathhouses. However, in many\nplaces the bathhouse no longer works, either having broken down or because of the lack of\nwater. In urban areas, 71 percent still use simple pit latrines as in rural areas, while another 4\npercent use ventilated pit latrines. Only 18 percent have septic tanks or are connected to main\nsewers. The rest have no individual toilets and use public toilets. For bathing, 43 percent bathe\nexclusively at home, while more than half use the public banya. When asked where they would\nprefer to bathe, the only significant change was in the increase of those who would like the\noption of bathing at home, which presumably is not presently possible due to the poor supply of\nwater. Presently, half of all households dispose of their wastewater in open pits as in rural\nareas. Only 23 percent have a septic tank or are connected to main sewers.\n6.  Perceived Needs for Services\n22.  Water  was  perceived  as  the  highest  priority  for  all  the  villages  surveyed,  it  was\nmentioned by over 95 percent of all households. Improvements in local power supplies and\nmedical  services  were  ranked  as  important  by  over  half  the  respondents  in  all  villages.\nImprovements to roads were also considered important by more than half the households in\nover half the villages. Sanitation was not recognized as a priority by many people. Less than 7\npercent sought improved individual toilets, and 13 percent wanted improved school toilets.\nBathhouses were, however, a perceived need for about 60 percent of all households surveyed.\nIn the urban areas, the perceived need for water was less strong in Kant, which has a water\nsupply system, than in Uzghen where the water supply coverage is less complete and problems\nare more acute. Improvements to the roads and solid waste collection systems were perceived\nas the next highest need with approximately 44 percent of households identifying these as\nimportant. Improvement to power supplies and gas connections was considered less important\nthan improving the sewerage system. Approximately a third of the population in both towns\nperceived any improvement in sanitation to be important.", "Appendix 13, page 8\n7.  Willingness to Pay\n23.  The residents of the villages were asked whether they would be willing to make advance\npayments for the construction of the water supply systems, as well as improvements to their\nown wastewater and sanitation systems. Twenty-three percent expressed a willingness to pay in\nadvance for the development or improvement of the water supply system. However, in practice,\nthey all have, either with cash, produce for barter, or human resources, or the use of equipment.\nAll those who wanted to improve their wastewater disposal system (approximately a quarter)\nsaid they were willing to pay. Of these, approximately 84 percent mentioned an initial cost\ncontribution of about Som200 per capita. Of those who wished to improve their toilet, the\nhouseholds said they were willing to pay an amount similar to that for the wastewater systems.\nBoth these systems need to be designed without expensive materials or equipment.\n24.  The willingness to pay analysis in the core communities shows that about 60 percent of\nthe  households have  monthly  income  of  less than  Som1,000  and  the average  household\nconsists of five to six family members. The surveyed households stated that water supply in\ntheir community was insufficient and a 45 percent increase of the existing supply is needed.\nFifty-one percent expressed their willingness to have their own house connection. They are\nwilling to pay an average Som1,000 for a connection and to spend an average of Som30-50 (or\nSom5-10 per person) for monthly water bills; on average, this represents the actual average\nexpected connection fee and monthly water bills of the subprojects. Using least-cost design and\nproviding  for  lifeline  tariff  for  the  poorer,  the  proposed  subprojects  are  affordable.  The\nhouseholds with house or yard water supply connections will be charged a higher fee than\npoorer households served by public standpipes. The tariff increases would be affordable at 3-5\npercent of the monthly household incomes of the poorer population.\nD.  Social Impact\n25.  The Project will contribute to improvements in health and will provide an opportunity to\nstrengthen the role of women in the community and thereby raise their status. It will also lessen\nthe burden on women as the main collectors of water and the nurse of the sick affected by\nunsanitary conditions. Time will be saved and improved health should result in improvements in\ngreater productive capacity of the whole population. In the urban areas, improved water supply\nand sanitation systems should improve the attractiveness of these towns for investment and\nhence employment. This should have a positive impact on the level of poverty presently found.\nBoth rural and urban subprojects will provide employment opportunities for residents, both in the\nconstruction or repair of water supply and sanitation systems, as well as in the management of\nthe systems. All the water users councils will require some accounting services and there is a\nstrong tradition for women to enter this profession. It is expected that women, by being involved\nin  both  the  councils  and  in  the  management  of vodakanals,  (urban  water  and  sewerage\nagencies) will be empowered, and that this will result in further initiatives being developed by\nthem.", "Appendix 14, page 1\nADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nINSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING FOR COMMUNITY BASED INFRASTRUCTURE\nSERVICES\nA.  Objective and Scope\n1.  The  main  objective  of  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  is  to  strengthen  the  sector\ninstitutions and create the appropriate management systems for the smooth implementation of\nthe Project. The TA will focus its activities to develop good implementation practices using the\ncore subproject sites studied under the project preparatory TA.1 It will (i) develop systems for\ninvolving the community, including strengthening the role of women in identifying needs for\nbasic infrastructure services and planning the level of services to be provided, and (ii) propose a\nmodel for the management by the water users councils (WUCs). The TA will help strengthen the\ncapacity at both the central and provincial government levels to manage the Project. This will be\ndone by developing and undertaking (i) the training for project procurement, and (ii) the training\nfor the project performance monitoring system (PPMS).\nB.  Cost Estimates\n2.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $765,000 equivalent, of which $537,000 is foreign\nexchange cost and $228,000 equivalent the local currency cost. Of this, $650,000 equivalent is\nproposed to be financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) on a grant basis from the\nJapan Special Fund funded by the Government of Japan; this comprises the entire foreign\nexchange cost and $113,000 equivalent of local currency cost. The Government will finance the\nremaining $115,000 equivalent of local currency costs. The estimated costs and financing plan\nare in Table A14.\nC.  Implementation Arrangements\n3.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources\n(MAWR). During the TA the consultants will be appointed for the project management unit\n(PMU) and the project implementation units (PIUs) in the three project oblasts (Chui, Jalal-\nAbad, and Osh). The National Water Supply and Sanitation Committee (NWSSC) will be the\nsteering committee for the Project, and will supervise the TA implementation to maximize the\nuse of TA findings in promoting a community-based approach to basic infrastructure planning,\ndevelopment, operation,  and  management.  The  TA  will  be  carried  out  over  nine  months,\ncommencing in the third month of loan effectiveness. The consultants will be recruited through a\nconsulting firm in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.\nD.  Terms of Reference for the Consultants\n4.

Eight rural and two urban representative core subprojects were subjected to economic\nand financial evaluation to determine their viability. Viability was established by computing the\neconomic and financial internal rates of return (EIRRs and FIRRs) following Asian Development\nBank (ADB) Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Water Supply Projects. The rural water\nsupply,  and  urban  water  and  sewage  components  were  subjected  to  analysis.  These\ncomponents make up about 90 percent of the physical infrastructure costs of the Project. The\neconomic  analysis  of  the  urban  subprojects  combines  both  water  supply  and  sewage\ncomponents, and produces a single EIRR for both components.\nA.  Economic Analysis\n1.  Assumptions and Methodology\n2. The  calculations  were  based  on  1999  constant  prices.  The  financial  costs  were\nconverted to economic costs by excluding taxes and duties, as well as price contingencies, and\nusing  a  domestic  price  numeraire.  Financial  costs  were  converted  to  economic  costs  for\ntradable goods using a shadow exchange rate factor (SERF) of 1.0. There  is  no  general\nguidance available on the standard conversion factors (SCFs) or SERFs appropriate for the\nKyrgyz Republic. Previous projects in the highway sector have used an SCF of 0.9, but this is\nfor Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic jointly. An agricultural project used an SCF of 0.98 for\nagricultural projects in the Kyrgyz Republic. The World Bank\u2019s project analysis for rural projects\nhas used an SCF of 1.0 assuming no discernable distortions, and therefore a reciprocal SERF\nof 1.0 was used in this case. For nontraded goods and services, a shadow wage rate (SWR) for\nunskilled labor has been used following estimates made for Kyrgyz agricultural and highway\nprojects, and taking account of the relatively high and increasing underemployment of labor.\nAnnual operation and maintenance costs are in constant terms. For land, fair market value was\nconsidered as the best approximation of its opportunity cost. Economic benefit streams include\neconomic cost savings, time savings, and the value of nontechnical losses in unaccounted for\nwater (UFW) consumed but not paid for in urban areas generated by the subprojects and\nprojected over a period of 25 years. Specifically the analysis includes the following:\n(i)  The  value  of  nonincremental  outputs  replacing  existing  supplies  were\ndistinguished  from  incremental  benefits  that  expand  supply  to  meet  new  or\nadditional demands as a result of new populations served or induced demand\nfrom existing populations. The Project will increase the population coverage with\naccess to safe and adequate water supply from the existing 40 percent to 80\npercent in the project villages. In view of the very low level of existing services,\nincremental demand is a significant component representing about half of the\ntotal benefits. Nonincremental water is valued based on existing supply price but\nvolumes are low as most is carried from rivers or purchased from vendors at high\nprices. Incremental water is valued at the average demand price projecting a\ngrowing  use  from  piped  sources  and  with  new  populations  served.  The\nproportion  of  incremental  water  to  nonincremental  water  sold  varies  by\nsubproject from 2.3 times for Tegirmenty to 0.8 times for Saz, but is typically\naround twice as much. The main direct cost savings, are time savings, which are\nalso significant, however, and as a result incremental benefits in rural subprojects\nrange from 35 percent of total benefits in Saz to 71 percent in Tegirmenty. In\nurban  subprojects  there  are  also  nonrevenue  water  (NRW)  benefits,  so\nincremental water is typically 35 to 55 percent.\n(ii)  Cost savings valued in terms of (a) the savings in direct costs, which are flat rate\ntariffs limited only to piped water sold in the two urban areas and a partial service", "Appendix 15, page 2\nin one rural area, and (b) savings in not having to buy water from private water\nvendors including that bought when other sources such as rivers and irrigation\nchannels are frozen or dry. Cost savings from not having to buy water from\ncommercial  water  vendors  were  estimated  by  multiplying  the  average\nconsumption  of  water  that  households  bought  from  vendors  without  the\nsubproject by the cost of water from these vendors.\n(iii)  Cost savings for households connected to existing piped water systems were\nestimated by multiplying the average monthly consumption per household by the\ndifference between the tariff currently charged and the average price of water\nwith the subproject.\n(iv)  Time savings are substantial in nearly all the rural areas and some parts of the\ntowns. These have been estimated direct from survey evidence multiplying the\naverage time spent each day to fetch water by the assumed value of time in the\nsubproject area using an unskilled agricultural wage rate as the value of time.\nTime savings are included as part of overall cost savings.\n(v)  The value of UFW nontechnical losses could be estimated only for the urban\nareas where data is available on total water production and some water meter\ndata for Kant is available. Total UFW losses are high\u2014around 70 percent\u2014but\nmost of these are technical losses. In view of the inaccuracy of the available\ndata, nontechnical losses are estimated at only around 10 percent for the two\ntowns and are not a significant component of benefits.\n3.  Estimates of present  and future consumption  were  based on  survey  results,  some\nlimited metered data on consumption from Kant, international standards and experience on\ndemand, and estimates based on a surrogate demand curve derived from survey results on\nwillingness to pay and calibrated using metered demand data and other sources. To estimate\nmarket dynamism,  without-  and  with-subproject  scenarios  were  evaluated  for  all  expected\neconomic benefits. Morbidity and mortality due to water-related diseases as measured in the\nsocial surveys are significant in the subproject areas and form part of the evaluation. However\nthese have not been included in the cost-benefit analysis. The Project is expected to generate\nsignificant health benefits by providing safe, potable water to the beneficiaries. The sanitation\nand bathhouse program will complement and reinforce the economic benefits associated with\nthe Project and ensure that initial gains will be enhanced and sustained.\n2.  Economic Internal Rates of Return\n4.  The major indicators of economic viability are summarized in Table A15.1. All core\nsubprojects were evaluated to be economically viable. Following ADB guidelines, the economic\nopportunity  cost  of  capital  was  set  at  12  percent.  EIRRs  were  computed  to  be  over  the\neconomic opportunity cost of capital of 12 percent and range widely from about 13 to 38\npercent. In the rural subprojects EIRRs are as follows: (i) Kydyrsha 28.2 percent, (ii) Kyzyl Ordo\n38.2 percent, (iii) Abdraimov 38.1 percent, (iv) Dostuk 13.0 percent, (v) Safarovka 33.6 percent,\n(vi) Tegirmenty 14.1 percent, and (vii) Saz 34.5 percent. In the towns, the combined water and\nsewerage EIRRs were 14.1 percent in Kant, and 32.7 percent in Uzghen. An economic analysis\nof Kosh Korgon was not carried out in view of the very high unit costs, small population that\nbenefits, and the decision of the case study to incorporate the subproject into the nearby\nUzghen urban subproject. The average EIRR for rural subprojects is 28.5 percent, reflecting a\ngenerally high level of benefits, particularly in induced increases in demand, time savings, and\nin some cases the reduction of significant vended water charges. It also reflects relatively low\nunit costs of improving water systems, particularly where the high costs of taxes and duties are\nexcluded from the economic costs. In cases such as Uzghen, where a low cost sewage option", "Appendix 15, page 3\nhas been selected and Kyzyl Ordo where significant time and vended water savings are made,\nEIRRs are very high. The lower level of return for the Kant subproject reflects the higher costs of\na full sewage scheme.\n5.  These EIRRs were subjected to sensitivity analysis using the following parameters: (i) 10\npercent increase in capital cost, (ii) 20 percent decrease in benefits, (iii) a combination of 5\npercent increase in capital costs and 10 percent decrease in benefits, and (iv) one-year delay in\nbenefits.  Switching  values  have  also  been  estimated  for  costs  and  benefits.  Only  two\nsubprojects became marginally nonviable within acceptable ranges of sensitivity under adverse\ncircumstances.  It  should  be  noted  that  this  analysis  excludes  the  significant  health  and\nenvironmental benefits from these quantified results.\nTable A15.1: Summary of Economic Analysis\nEconomic Sensitivity\nEvaluation Tests Benefit Costs +5% Benefit Switching Values\nBase EIRR Costs plus less & Benefit Delay 1\nCosts Benefits\nSubproject Percent 10 percent 20 percent \u201310% Year\nUrban Water\nSupply and\nSewerage Services\nKant 14.1 10.0 5.4 7.8 9.6 4.7 4.5\nUzghen 32.7 22.8 12.5 17.9 17.2 25.8 20.5\nRural Water Supply\nKydyrsha 28.2 25.1 21.2 23.3 21.9 81.0 44.8\nKyzyl Ordo 38.2 34.3 29.7 32.1 28.7 144.2 59.1\nKosh Korgon \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\nAbdraimov 38.1 34.2 29.6 32.0 28.6 145.7 59.3\nDostuk 13.0 11.3 9.2 10.3 11.0 5.8 5.5\nSafarovka 33.6 30.2 26.1 28.3 25.9 126.1 55.8\nTegirmenty 14.1 12.5 10.4 11.5 12.0 13.3 11.7\nSaz 34.5 31.0 26.8 29.0 26.4 129.5 56.4\n\u2014  = not available, EIRR = economic internal rate of return.\nB.  Financial Analysis\n6.  Financial evaluations were conducted for all rural and urban core subprojects. Financial\nevaluations were conducted by calculating the FIRRs. Costs and revenues were evaluated at\nconstant 1999 prices.  Investment  costs for  the  rural  program  include  the  capital  costs  of\nrehabilitation, expansion of existing water supply systems, and construction of new systems. In\nthe urban areas, water supply and sewerage systems are analyzed separately. Capital costs\ninclude expansion of existing water supply systems, rehabilitation of the treatment plant in Kant,\ninstallation of septic tanks in Uzghen, development of pumping and distribution facilities, and\nconstruction  of  new  connections.  Operating  costs  cover  the  incremental  labor,  power,\nchemicals,  repairs  and  maintenance,  emptying,  carriage,  and  disposal  of  septic  tanks  in\nUzghen, and administrative costs projected over 25 years. The weighted average cost of capital\n(WACC) was computed at 0.9 percent based on the following parameters:", "Appendix 15, page 4\nLoan Source Weight Loan Rate (%)\nADB 80 1.00\nGovernment 20 13.30\nTotal 100\nWACC nominal 3.46\nInflation rate (foreign) 0.025 2.50\nWACC, real (1+0.0346)/(1+0.025)-1 0.90\n   ADB = Asian Development Bank, WACC = weighted average cost of capital.\n7.  All core subprojects were evaluated to have FIRRs higher than the WACC and are\ntherefore financially viable. FIRRs in the rural subprojects are as follows: (i) Kydyrsha 14.1\npercent, (ii) Kyzyl Ordo 13.7 percent, (iii) Kosh Korgon 4.7 percent, (iv) Abdraimov 13.5 percent,\n(v) Dostuk 7.0 percent, (vi) Safarovka 13.2 percent, (vii) Tegirmenty 14.4 percent, and (viii) Saz\n12.9 percent. In the towns, FIRRs were 8.4 percent for water supply and 13.5 percent for\nsewerage in Kant, and 6.2 percent for water supply and 5.8 percent for sewerage in Uzghen.\nThese were subjected to sensitivity analysis using the following parameters: (i) 10 percent\nincrease in capital cost, (ii) 20 percent decrease in benefits, (iii) a combination of 5 percent\nincrease in capital costs  and  10  percent decrease  in  benefits,  and  (iv) one-year  delay  in\nbenefits. These were found to be satisfactory compared with the WACC in all cases. The\naverage FIRR for the eight rural water supply subprojects is about 11 percent. The tariffs have\nbeen estimated on a full cost-recovery basis and found to be sufficient to cover all financial\nrequirements of the water providers including capital, operation, maintenance, and replacement\ncosts. The tariff increases will be affordable at 3-5 percent of the monthly household incomes of\nthe poor project beneficiaries.\n1.  Revenues\n8.  For subprojects in rural and urban areas, both with and without existing water systems,\ntariff rates were determined based on financial operations requirements with existing tariffs,\naffordability, average household income levels, and willingness-to-pay data as reference data.\nThe proportion of household income used to pay for water should not exceed 5 percent. In low\nincome and high poverty level areas the proportion should range from 3 to 5 percent. The\nimpact on affordability limits is examined in paras. 10-12.\n2. Financial Internal Rates of Return\n9.  The major indicators of financial viability are summarized in Table A15.2. All 10 core\nsubprojects were found to be financially viable, with FIRRs ranging from 4.7 to 14.4 percent.\nThe same sensitivity tests used in the economic analysis were used. All subprojects were\nevaluated to be within acceptable ranges of sensitivity under adverse circumstances.", "Appendix 15, page 5\nTable A15.2: Summary of Financial Analysis\nSensitivity Tests\n Base Costs Revenue Costs +5% Revenue Switching Values\nFIRR +10% \u201320 % and Revenue delayed 1\nCosts Revenue\nSubproject (percent) \u201310% year\nUrban Water\nSupply\nKant 8.4 5.1 1.0 3.2 5.8 19.3 16.2\nUzghen 6.2 3.6 1.8 2.8 3.9 14.6 12.8\nUrban Sewerage\nKant 13.5 10.6 7.1 9.0 10.2 49.8 33.2\nUzghen 5.8 4.6 2.9 3.8 4.6 29.2 22.6\nRural Water\nSupply\nKydyrsha 14.1 11.6 8.4 10.1 11.1 59.8 37.4\nKyzyl Ordo 13.7 11.6 8.8 10.3 11.2 70.9 41.5\nKosh Korgon 4.7 2.8 0.2 1.7 3.5 11.9 10.6\nAbdraimov 13.5 11.3 8.7 10.1 11.0 70.3 41.3\nDostuk 7.0 5.4 3.3 4.4 5.7 31.1 23.7\nSafarovka 13.2 11.3 8.8 10.1 10.9 77.8 43.8\nTegirmenty 14.4 12.6 10.4 11.6 12.2 112.9 53.0\nSaz 12.9 10.8 8.2 9.6 10.5 68.4 40.6\nFIRR = financial internal rate of return.\nC.  Affordability Analysis\n10.  Affordability  analysis  was  conducted of  the  case  study  subprojects  to  examine  the\naffordability of the proposed water charges with reference to the recommended limit of 3-5\npercent of monthly household income. Tariffs used in the analysis were for 2010 when the cost-\nrecovery analysis shows that they will have settled to  their fixed  level following  the  initial\nconstruction, operation, and five year gradual adjustment periods. The analysis was therefore\nconducted using an estimate of average household incomes in 2010 based on the survey\nresults for 1999, and applying a real growth factor of 3 percent per annum. There is no reliable\nincome trend or projection data for the Kyrgyz Republic but in the medium to long term a rate of\n3 percent per annum represents a fairly conservative approach to estimating affordability.  In\nview of the lack of reliability of data the average household expenditure for water and average\nhousehold incomes were subjected to sensitivity analysis to analyze affordability under adverse\ncircumstances using the following parameters: (i) increase rates by 10 percent, (ii) decrease\naverage household income by 10 percent, and (iii) both (i) and (ii).\n11.  Affordability analysis proved to be satisfactory, with the percentage of average monthly\nhousehold expenditure to be spent on water varying from 0.7 to 4.1 percent with two exceptions.\nThe average affordability level for the nine water supply core subprojects  analyzed  is  3.1\npercent. The exceptions are, firstly, Dostuk where affordability reaches 5.0 percent. Dostuk is a\nvillage of 1,570 people to be served by the proposed system; there are no economies of scale.\nThe second exception, Kosh Korgon, where tariffs would be nearly 35 percent of income,\ndemonstrates that this small village of just over 500 population cannot be economically or\naffordably  served.  The  subproject  case  study  therefore  recommends  that  it  should  be\nincorporated into the adjoining Uzghen urban system at marginal additional cost; it is excluded\nfrom the analysis. Sensitivity analysis showed satisfactory results  under  the  most  adverse\ncircumstances, with percentages ranging from 0.8 to 6.5 percent. The analysis demonstrates\nthe affordability of urban sewerage systems. The proposed improvement and extension of the\nexisting Kant system would produce average full cost-recovery tariffs of 4.8 percent of income.\nThe lower cost of the option with a new septic tank chosen for Uzghen represents only 1.4\npercent of income.
