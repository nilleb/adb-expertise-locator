Several  agribusiness \ncompanies  were  considered,  and  PRAN  was  found  to  be  one  of  the  most  professional, \nreputable,  creditworthy,  and  able  to  use  ADB\u2019s  funds  toward  development.  PRAN  received \nfinancing from the International Finance Corporation (IFC) for previous expansion projects.1 In \nJuly 2011, PRAN applied for ADB assistance to fund its investment in three new agribusiness \nfacilities: (i) a liquid glucose plant, (ii) a flour mill, and (iii) a frozen food processing plant. ADB\u2019s \ninvestment committee endorsed the concept review paper for the transaction in January 2012. \n \n3. \nThe  project  is  central  to  PRAN's  strategy  of  pursuing  vertical  integration  and  product \ndiversification. Investment in liquid glucose and flour amounts to vertical integration as these are \ningredients of PRAN\u2019s food products. Bangladesh does not produce high-quality liquid glucose, \nrequiring PRAN to import it from India.  Vertical integration will help PRAN manage  input costs \nand improve quality control, boosting its sales in Bangladesh and abroad. As part of its product \ndiversification strategy, PRAN plans to enter the promising frozen food business. PRAN can rely \non its industrial know-how and extensive distribution network and marketing capability to ensure \nthe project\u2019s success. \n \n4. \nThe project is consistent with the government\u2019s objective of making agriculture and food \nprocessing  more  productive  and  competitive.  In  particular,  the  Sixth  Five-Year  Plan,  FY2011\u2013\nFY2015  emphasizes  (i)  import  substitution  for  certain  crops  and  food  products,  (ii)  increased \nexports of high-value food products, (iii) increased private sector participation and investment in \nagribusiness, and (iv) food security and improved nutrition for all.2 PRAN will become one of the \nfirst companies to produce fortified flour in Bangladesh. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\n5. \nThe  project  will  be  developed  by  a  new  dedicated  PRAN  company,  Sylvan  Agriculture \nLimited  (SAL),  with  full  support  from  the  group\u2019s  functional  departments.  The  project  will  be \nconstructed at two sites: the flour mill and frozen food processing plant in Danga, 30 kilometers \neast  of  Dhaka,  and  the  liquid  glucose plant  in Olipur,  120 kilometers  northeast  of  Dhaka.  The \nliquid  glucose  plant  could  be  located  in  Danga  as  well  if  sufficient  power  connection  could  be \nallocated from the grid. However, the Olipur site currently enjoys better energy supply. The land \nat both sites is owned by PRAN shareholders and will be provided to SAL as in-kind equity at a \nvaluation confirmed by independent land valuation reports. \n \n                                                \n1 \n\nIFC lent $15 million to PRAN in 2009 for corporate-wide expansion, $7 million in 2011 for a dairy project, and $25 \nmillion in 2012 for introducing new packaged foods, spices, and condiment to its product line. \n\n2  Government of Bangladesh, Ministry of Planning. 2011. Sixth Five-Year Plan: FY2011\u2013FY2015. Dhaka. \n\n \n\n\fPRAN\u2019s  objective  is  to  source  as  much  raw  material  as  possible  from  local  farmers. \n6. \nLiquid  glucose  is  made  from  starch,  which  can  be  derived  from  either  maize  or  cassava,  two \ncrops cultivated in Bangladesh. SAL plans to produce both liquid glucose and starch in-house. \nIn the first year of operation, however, SAL will procure starch from third parties while delaying \nstarch  production  until  glucose  production  has  stabilized.  From  the  second  year,  SAL  will \nprocure  maize  from  local  farmers  (or  cassava  as  a  less  likely  alternative)  to  produce  starch. \nFlour will be made from wheat. In the first year of operation, wheat will be imported to ensure \nappropriate  quality.  However,  SAL  plans  to  source  high-quality  wheat  locally  from  the  second \nyear.  The  frozen  food  that  SAL  intends  to  produce  is  mainly  flat  breads  such  as  parata  or \nchapati.  As  such,  83%  of  the  raw  material  required  for  frozen  food  will  be  flour,  which  the \ncompany intends to produce in its own flour mill. \n \nSAL  will  have  an  annual  production  capacity  of  45,000  tons  of  liquid  glucose,  90,000 \n7. \ntons of starch (half to be used for glucose production  and half sold externally), 90,000 tons of \nflour, and 180 million units of flour-based frozen foods. Capacity utilization will rise slowly from \n50% in the first year to 90% in the fifth year. SAL will sell 50% of the liquid glucose produced \nand  25%  of  the  flour  produced  to  other  group  companies  for  preparing  PRAN  food  products \n(e.g.,  juices,  biscuits,  and  baked  goods).  However,  most  of  SAL\u2019s  production  will  be  sold  to \nexternal clients: 50% of liquid glucose and starch, 75% of flour, and 100% of frozen foods. While \nliquid  glucose  and  starch  will  be  sold  solely  for  industrial  use,  flour  will  be  sold  wholesale  to \nindustrial bakeries and retail as packaged flour. All frozen food sales will be retail. \n \n\n3. \n\nThe Sponsor \n\nThe PRAN group is one of the largest manufacturing groups in Bangladesh, the market \n8. \nleader  in  food  under  the  PRAN  brand  and  in  plastics  under  the  RFL  brand.  Its  factories  are \nlocated  at  13  locations  across  the  country.  The  group\u2019s  estimated  turnover  in  2011  was  $450 \nmillion.  It  is  made  up  of  25  companies,  two  of  which  are  publicly  listed:  the  Agricultural \nMarketing Company in food and Rangpur Foundry in plastics. \n \n9. \nThe group is controlled by Amjad Khan Chowdhury and his family. All group companies \nare 100% owned by the family except the two listed companies, in which the family retains 41% \nand 49%. Similarly, SAL will be 100% owned by the Chowdhury family, with a 40% equity stake \nheld by Amjad Khan Chowdhury, 40% by his son Ahsan Khan Chowdhury, and 20% by his wife, \nSabiha Amjad. Amjad Khan Chowdhury started his business after retiring from the Bangladesh \narmy in 1981 as a major general. \n \n10. \nPRAN  has  leading  market  shares  in  Bangladesh  in  almost  all  segments  in  which  it \noperates: 74% in juices, 35% in culinary products, 11% in biscuits and baked goods, and 60% in \nplastic household products. PRAN benefits from strong brand recognition supported by one of \nthe  largest  advertising  budgets  in  the  country.  A  key  strength  of  the  group  is  its  extensive \ndistribution network of 14 depots and 3,600 distributors. \n \n11. \nIn addition to its domestic business, the group exports to 77 countries, with exports sales \nestimated  at  $70  million  in  2011.  The  original  export  target  was  Bangladeshi  expatriates,  but \nPRAN  now  targets  local  populations  as  well,  particularly  other  South  Asians  and  Muslims,  as \nPRAN\u2019s products are certified halal. India, the Middle East, and Africa each accounts for about \none third of the group\u2019s exports. PRAN has overseas offices in India, Malaysia, Singapore, and \nthe United Arab Emirates. \n \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nPRAN\u2019s  companies  function  as  a  group  under  the  ownership  and  control  of  the \n12. \nChowdhury family. Intercompany transactions are conducted at arm\u2019s length, but the group has \nin  its  Dhaka  headquarters  centralized  functional  departments  to  manage  finance,  legal \nconcerns,  development  engineering,  procurement,  and  human  resources.  The  cost  of  these \nshared services is allocated to the different companies of the group based on transparent rules. \n \n13. \nThe group directly employs about 29,000 staff. Workers receive training, and all factories \nhave  day-care  facilities  for  workers  and  their  families.  The  workers  are  unionized,  and \nmanagement has excellent relationships with the unions. In addition, about 60,000 households \ndepend  on  PRAN  business  for  their  livelihood.  PRAN  engages  contract  farmers  to  ensure \nconsistent supply volume and quality and reduce dependence on imports, allowing PRAN food \nproducts  to  have  about  90%  local  content.  PRAN  currently  has  under  contract  about  42,000 \nfarmers  all  over  Bangladesh  producing  mangos,  tomatoes,  mung  beans,  chili,  coriander, \nmustard, peanut, and aromatic rice, among other crops. \n \nB. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n1. \n\nImpact \n\n14. \nThe  project  will  help  sustain high agricultural  growth by  connecting  farmers  to markets \nfor  processed  food  locally  and  abroad.  Agricultural  gross  domestic  product  growth  should \nremain at 4.5% on average from 2011 to 2020. The project will boost exports of agricultural and \nprocessed  food  products.  The  share  of  agricultural  and  food  products  in  total  exports  could \nincrease from 5% in 2010 to 10% in 2020. The project will help strengthen national food security \nby  improving  nutrition  with  affordable,  high-quality  foods.  The  percentage  of  wheat  flour \nproduced in Bangladesh that is fortified could increase from close to 0% in 2011 to at least 10% \nin 2020. \n \n\n2. \n\nOutcome \n\n15. \nThe project\u2019s expected outcome will be the production of high-value food products with \ninputs  from  local  farmers.  SAL\u2019s  annual  sales  are  expected  to  exceed  $50  million  by  2016. \nAgricultural  products  sourced  from  Bangladeshi  farmers  are  expected  to  reach  a  value  of  at \nleast $30 million by 2016. Direct employment is expected to benefit 1,000 workers by 2016, and \nindirect  employment  at  least  50,000,  especially  farmers  under  contract.  Food  processing  is  a \nlight  industry  that  typically  employs  a  fair  proportion  of  women.  PRAN  now  employs  7,000 \nwomen, or 24% of its workforce. The project is expected to have some gender benefits, as SAL \nwill commit to employing at least 30% women. \n \n\n3. \n\nOutputs \n\n16. \nThe  expected  outputs  of  the  project  will  be  the  completion  of  the  three  agribusiness \nproject components by 2015, including the implementation of all corrective actions identified in \nenvironment and social safeguard plans by 2015.3 \n \n\n                                                \n3  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n\nStrategy  2020  identifies  support  to  agriculture  and  rural  areas  as  an  \u2015underlying \n17. \ncomponent  of the  inclusive  growth  strategy\u2016  because \u2015the  majority  of  the  poor  still  live in rural \nareas,  and  agriculture  remains  a  source  of  productivity  improvement,  seasonal  employment, \nand income growth\u2014especially when connected to urban, industrial, and export markets.\u20164 The \nproject  is  particularly  relevant  because  PRAN,  an  integrated  food  and  agribusiness  company, \nconnects  agricultural  production  to  food  processing  and  export  markets.  The  project  is  also \nconsistent with Strategy 2020\u2019s objective of scaling up private sector development and private \nsector operations in all operational areas. \n \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n\n18. \nThe  project  aligns  with  ADB\u2019s  agriculture  sector  strategy.  In  particular,  the  Operational \nPlan  for  Sustainable  Food  Security  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  recommends  an  \u2015expanded \npartnership  with  the  private  sector\u2016  to  attract  \u2015more  direct  investments  in  productivity \nenhancement, agro-processing, agro-retailing, and other nonfarm rural business.\u2016  5 Assistance \nto an integrated food and agribusiness company also addresses the operational plan\u2019s objective \nof \u2015increasing synergy and value addition in the backward and forward linkages along the food \nand  agriculture  value  chain.\u2016  Improved  linkages  along  the  value  chain  enhance  productivity, \nemployment opportunities, exports, and regional trade, as well as food security for the poor. \n \nAgriculture and natural resources is one of the six sectors identified for ADB assistance \n19. \nunder  its  country  partnership  strategy  for  Bangladesh,  2011\u20132015.  In  particular,  the  strategy \ndocument  mentions  that  ADB's  private  sector  operations  will  consider  financial  support for the \nfood  processing  industry.  The  project  will  benefit  from  synergies  with  ADB\u2019s  sovereign \nassistance  to  rural  infrastructure  and  water  resource  management.  For  example,  rural  road \nimprovement may improve the ability of farmers to sell their products to PRAN.6 \n \nD. \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\n20. \nThe project is estimated to cost $35.8 million. Project costs include land (6%), civil works \n(19%), machinery and equipment (54%), starting raw material production (17%), financing (3%), \nand contingencies (1%).

Agribusiness  companies  benefit  from \nincentives such as a corporate tax holiday for the first 5 years of operation. \nAs with all other group companies, SAL\u2019s strategic decisions will be made by its board \nof directors, which will include members of the Chowdhury family and a representative \nfrom management. Operational decisions will be delegated to the general manager of \nthe  company  and  executed  by  managers  of  each  business  line.  Production \nmanagement will be staffed by highly skilled personnel. \nConstruction  has  started  and  is  expected  to  take  2  years,  from  January  2012  to \nDecember  2013.  According  to  ADB\u2019s  market  and  technical  consultant,  the  time \nprojected to complete the project is sufficient. \nProcurement will be implemented in line with ADB Procurement Guidelines (2010, as \namended from time to time) for private sector projects. Equipment and machinery will \nbe  procured  from  international  manufacturers  to  be  selected  through  competitive \nbidding. Potential suppliers identified by PRAN, most of them in western Europe and \nthe  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  have  good  reputations.  Equipment  installation  and \ncivil works will be carried out by a group company, selected in a transparent manner \nand operating at arm\u2019s length, that has constructed most of PRAN\u2019s factories. ADB\u2019s \nmarket  and  technical  consultant  is  confident  of  the  company\u2019s  ability  to  carry  out \nequipment installation and civil works. \nThe operation and maintenance of the project will be undertaken by SAL, with support \nfrom the PRAN group. The project will benefit from PRAN\u2019s manufacturing expertise. \nAll  PRAN  factories  are  ISO  9001  or  ISO  9000  certified  for  quality  management \nsystems.  SAL\u2019s  business  plan  includes  both  routine  maintenance  and  significant \ncapital expenditure maintenance, such as to replace machinery, from the third year of \noperation. \nMaize and  wheat  will  ultimately  be sourced from local farmers on contract to ensure \ngood quality and price and certainty of supply, while providing farmers with technical \nassistance and reliable income over the long term. Initially, however, PRAN may rely \non the wholesale market for sourcing raw materials, as SAL\u2019s requirement is less than \n5% of the maize  produced  in or imported  to  Bangladesh and  less than 1% of  wheat \nproduced domestically or imported. Contract farming for the project will take 2\u20133 years \nto establish, as appropriate seeds, locations, and farmers have to be selected. \nThe project will benefit from PRAN\u2019s extensive distribution network of 14 depots and \n3,600 distributors across the country, as well as from its marketing capability. \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nAspects \nPerformance \nmonitoring \n\nArrangements \nKey  performance  indicators,  including  output  and  outcome  indicators  and  financial \ncovenants, will be reported by PRAN companies. SAL will report on the percentage of \nwomen employed. \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  ISO  =  International  Organization  for  Standardization,  SAL  =  Sylvan  Agriculture \nLimited. \nSources: PRAN and ADB analysis. \n \nF. \n\nUnique Features \n\n23. \nThis is ADB\u2019s first nonsovereign agribusiness project since 1985. The project will support \nprivate sector job creation and strengthen nutrition security through flour fortification. PRAN has \nbeen  working  since  2005  with  the  Global  Alliance  for  Improved  Nutrition  on  food  fortification, \nintroducing  vitamins  and  minerals  in  biscuits,  noodles,  juices,  and  milk.  Similarly,  PRAN  is \nplanning  to  fortify  its  flour  with  vitamins  A  and  B  and  the  minerals  iron  and  zinc.  Fortifying \nindustrially  processed  flour,  when  appropriately  implemented,  is  an  effective,  simple,  and \ninexpensive strategy for supplying  vitamins  and  minerals  in  the  diets  of  large segments  of  the \npopulation.7  Whereas  21%  of  wheat  flour  in  Southeast  Asia  is  fortified,  as  is  97%  in  the \nAmericas,  almost  none  is  in  Bangladesh.  The  duty  levied  on  food  manufacturers\u2019  imports  of \nvitamins  and  minerals  is  a  major  hurdle  to  food  fortification  in  Bangladesh.  PRAN  is  also  an \naccredited supplier of high energy biscuits under the World Food Programme in Bangladesh. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\n24. \nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  lend  up  to  $25.1  million  to  the  project  company  as  a  senior \nsecured  loan.  Corporate  guarantees  have  been  negotiated  with  four  other  group  companies. \nBecause  the  ADB  loan  will  help  finance  long-lived  capital  expenditure  items,  its  door-to-door \ntenor will be 7 years, with a 2-year grace period on repaying principal. \n \nB. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\nADB  will  provide  long-tenor  US  dollar  financing,  which  is  not  readily  available  in \n25. \nBangladesh.  PRAN\u2019s  partnership  with  ADB  will  contribute  to  further  raising  the  international \nprofile of a \u2015national champion\u2016 in a strategic industry for Bangladesh. Agribusiness increasingly \ncontributes to gross domestic product and export growth and, as it is  very labor intensive,  will \ncontinue  to  create  jobs.  PRAN  is  already  one  of  the  largest  private  employers  in  the  country. \nTogether  with  IFC,  ADB  will  continue  to  promote  good  corporate  governance,  which  will  help \nPRAN raise more capital in the future from international debt and equity markets. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\nIn compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is category B \n26. \nfor  environment,  category  C  for  involuntary  resettlement,  and  category  C  for  indigenous \npeoples. The potential environmental, health, and safety impacts and risks of the project have \nbeen  identified  in  the  Initial  Environmental  Examination,  and  effective  corrective  measures  to \n\n                                                \n7  World  Health  Organization.  2009.

The institutional \ncapacity and commitment of SAL to manage the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts are \ndeemed adequate. \n \n27.  Measures to benefit women and facilitate their involvement in constructing and operating \nthe  project  have  been  incorporated  into  project  design  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nGender  and  Development  (1998).  SAL  will  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection  Strategy  and \nreport  regularly  to  ADB  on  its  compliance,  and that  of  its  contractors,  with  national  labor  laws \nand their adherence to internationally recognized core labor standards.9 Information disclosure \nand consultations with project stakeholders are consistent with ADB requirements.10 \n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n28. \nSAL was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating  corruption,  money  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism.  ADB  will  ensure  that \nthe  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC. \n\nInvestment Limitations \n\nThe  proposed  loan  is  within  the  medium-term,  country,  industry,  group,  and  single-\n\n29. \nproject exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD. \n\nAssurances \n\n30. \nConsistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter), \nthe  Government  of  Bangladesh  will  be  requested  to  confirm  that  it  has  no  objection  to  the \nproposed  assistance  to  SAL.  ADB  will  enter  into  suitable  finance  documentation,  in  form  and \nsubstance satisfactory  to ADB, following  approval  of the  proposed assistance by  the  Board of \nDirectors. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n31. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$25,100,000  to  Sylvan  Agriculture  Limited  for  the  PRAN  Agribusiness  Project  in  Bangladesh \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  such  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in this report, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n                                                \n8  Safeguards and Social Dimensions Summary (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n9  ADB. 2003.
