The \nreport also describes the proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Government of \nAustralia, and if the Board approves the proposed grants, I, acting under the authority delegated to \nme by the Board, approve the administration of the grant. \n \n2. \nThe proposed project will assist the governments of the RMI and FSM to improve the quality \nof  basic  education  in  the  remote  and  dispersed  island  countries,  while  ensuring  efficiency  and \neffectiveness  through  shared  solutions  to  common  challenges  across  the  two  neighboring \ncountries.  The  project  will  build  on  the  successes  and  lessons  learned  under  previous  regional \ntechnical assistance (TA) in the North Pacific.1 It takes a comprehensive and sustainable approach \nfor effective reforms, rooted in strengthening existing institutions until 2023 when the United States \n(US) Compact of Free Association ends.2 The project will improve learning outcomes for primary \nschool students, with a focus on literacy and numeracy, through improvements to teacher quality, \nassessment  for  learning,  access  to  bilingual  teaching  and  learning  resources  for  literacy  and \nnumeracy, and improved educational leadership and management including parent and community \nengagement in education.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nBoth the RMI and FSM recognize the need to improve the quality of basic education, even \nwith the gains made in increasing access to education. Student performance is alarmingly low, with \nonly 21% of sixth graders meeting or exceeding the minimum competency in mathematics and 32% \nmeeting or exceeding the minimum competency in reading in the FSM.3 In the RMI, 20% of sixth \ngraders  meet  or  exceed  proficiency  levels  in mathematics  and  19%  meet  or  exceed proficiency \nlevels in reading.4 \n \nWeak  education  outcomes  stem  from  many  factors,  notably  poor  teacher  quality.  The \n4. \nminimum qualification for  teaching, the  2-year  associate\u2019s  degree,  has  not  been met  by  17%  of \nteachers in the FSM and 38% in the RMI (footnotes 2 and 3). In addition, only the second year of \nthe  associate\u2019s  degree  focuses  on  teacher  education  courses,  and  professional  learning \nopportunities are not continuous or necessarily coherent. Urban teachers and schools receive more \n\n                                                \n1  ADB.  2012.  Technical  Assistance  for  Quality  Primary  Education  in  the  North  Pacific.  Manila.  The  Japan  Fund  for \nPoverty Reduction-financed TA piloted early grade learning assessments, teacher training, and teaching and learning \nresource materials. Results from a comparative baseline of early grade learning assessment conducted 1 year apart \nindicate an increase in literacy and numeracy performance by an overall average ranging from 24% to 32% for both \ngroups of randomly selected students from grade 3 and 5 in three different project sites in RMI and FSM.  \n\n2  The Compact of Free Association is an international agreement establishing and governing the relationships of free \nassociation between  the United  States and  the  three Pacific  Island nations:  the Federated  States  of  Micronesia, \nthe Marshall Islands,  and Palau. In  the  FSM  and  the  RMI,  compact  funds  comprise the majority  of expenditures  in \neducation, health, and infrastructure. In FSM annual Compact Sector Grants to education are around $25 million, and \nin RMI around $11 million.  \n\n3  Government  of  the  Federated  States  of  Micronesia,  National  Department  of  Education.  2015.  FSM  National  Joint \nEconomic  and  Management  Committee  Indicators  for  Education  2015.  http://www.fsmed.fm/index.php/public-\ninfo/jemco-indicators  \n\n4  Government  of \n\nthe  Republic  of \n\nthe  Marshall \n\nIslands.  2016.  RMI  Education  Digest  2015\u20132016.  \n\nhttp://www.pss.edu.mh/index.php/en/pss-documents  \n\n\fsupport than rural and remote teachers and schools. Low student learning outcomes at the primary \neducation level become magnified and more expensive to resolve at higher levels of education, \nwhen  disenfranchised  youth  create  larger  societal  issues.  A  young  population  in  both  countries \noffers a substantial labor force that must be capitalized on to maximize potential growth. \n \n5. \nA major challenge for RMI and FSM is adjusting to regular cuts in the US Compact of Free \nAssociation  grants,  which  fund  most  of  the  operating  budgets  in  education,  health,  and \ninfrastructure. The urgency of improving education is heightened by the end of the Compact and \nthe US supplemental education grant funds in 2023, which compromise 100% of state education \nbudgets in the FSM and about 69% of the national education budget in the RMI. Compact funds \nsupport recurrent costs but are insufficient to address significant training needs or teaching and \nlearning resources. The potential cessation of supplemental education grant funds (estimated at \n$10 million annually for FSM and $5 million for RMI) after 2023 is a larger issue, as these are not \nincluded in the projections for sustainable disbursement from the established trust fund after 2023 \nsince the trust fund is modeled on education sector grant funds only. This 6-year project is critically \npositioned  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  local  educational  institutions,  which  provide  strong \nfoundations to work together more effectively and efficiently to build resiliency following 2023. \n \n6. \nThe  project  is  included  in  the  ADB  Pacific  Department\u2019s  Regional  Operations  Business \nPlan,  2017\u20132019;  and  education  is  a  core  area  under  the  Pacific  Approach,  2016\u20132020.5 The \nproject aligns with both countries\u2019 national development plans and education sector plans, and the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) is providing support to review and develop the next sector strategic \nplan for each country in 2017.6 Demand for education support from ADB in the North Pacific is very \nstrong, as ADB is the major education donor aside from the Government of the United States. The \nGovernment  of  Australia\u2019s  Department  of  Foreign  Affairs  and  Trade,  Japan  International \nCooperation  Agency  volunteers,  and  the  US  Peace  Corps  volunteer  program  operate  in  the \neducation  sector,  mainly  at  primary  level,  and  synergies  between  those  initiatives  will  be \nharmonized with the project as was done under the previous TA. The Government of Australia has \nbeen  supporting  the  education  sector  and  ADB  TA  in  the  RMI  and  FSM  through  the  Pacific \nTechnical Assistance Mechanism advisors and volunteers in both countries. The Government of \nAustralia is also a co-financier on the project for the FSM. \n \nThe project will build on the previous TA, which worked in a small number of schools, and \n7. \nwill be most effective where supportive institutional backing exists. In the FSM, it will work in the \nstates of Pohnpei and Kosrae (where a preceding TA was piloted) and Yap state, which has shown \nstrong  institutional  backing.  After  mobilization,  the  project  will  consider  the  most  strategic  entry \npoints  to  Chuuk,  which  has  the  largest  education  and  development  challenges7.  As  the  project \nbecomes embedded in the other states, it will be better positioned to take on Chuuk\u2019s more serious \neducation challenges. In the RMI, the project will focus on Majuro, Ebeye, Jaluit and Wotje outer \nislands. \n \n                                                \n5  ADB.  2016.  Pacific  Approach,  2016\u20132020.

ADB is providing support with additional grant cofinancing from \nthe Global Partnership for Education to develop sector strategic plans for the RMI and FSM. \n\n7  Chuuk is the most populous state of FSM with lowest rates of education performance historically. The US Department \nof Interior in partnership with the FSM National Government and Chuuk State Government completed a 10-point reform \naction  plan  to  help  the  state  get  to  a  basic  level  of  functional  education  services.  A  new  permanent  director  was \nconfirmed in April 2017 and should help to address the delayed progress due to a lack of leadership for the past  4 \nyears. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fOutputs \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nImproving  the quality  of basic  education  in the  RMI  and FSM  requires strengthening  the \n8. \ncollaborative and collective efforts of existing stakeholders to work together more effectively and \nefficiently. Primary partners and stakeholders include tertiary institutions responsible for educating \nRMI  and  FSM  teachers  and  principals;  FSM  national  department  of  education  (NDOE),  state \ndepartments  of  education  (SDOEs),  and  the  RMI  Ministry  of  Education  (MOE);  relevant \nnongovernment  organizations;  and  above  all,  parents  and  community.  It  is  anticipated  that  all \nprimary school students and primary school teachers (29,236 students and 2,485 primary school \nteachers)  will  benefit  from  the  project  (footnotes  2  and  3).  This  represents  about  20%  of  the \ncombined total population of 157,450 people across the RMI and FSM.8 \n \nB. \n \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: improved quality of basic education in the \n9. \nFSM  and  the  RMI.  The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:  improved  primary  education \nlearning outcomes in literacy and numeracy, with 50% of grade 6 students meeting or exceeding \nthe minimum competency for reading and mathematics.9 \n \nC. \n \n10. \nThe project will deliver four outputs: (i) teachers in primary education are better prepared; \n(ii) capacity to use student assessment to improve learning strengthened; (iii) access to and usage \nof  teaching  and  learning  resources  and  materials  for  literacy  and  numeracy  expanded;  and \n(iv) educational  leadership  and  management  of  schools,  including  parent  and  community \nengagement, strengthened.  \n \n11. \nOutput  1:  Teachers  in  primary  education  are  better  prepared.  Under  the  project, \nteaching  quality  will  be  enhanced  through  strengthened  teacher  in-service  programs  and \npreservice programs. A total of 400 teachers will be trained in quality pedagogy in RMI and 800 \nteachers will be trained in the FSM. The project will support implementation of a quality teacher \neducation program that includes experiential and project-based learning, use of Open Education \nResources,10 and  ensures  a  foundation  for  all  teachers  in  Quality  Pedagogy  Framework.11 The \nproject  holds  student  learning  as  the  driving  emphasis  of  teacher  practice,  drawing  on  local \nevidence of what works and responding to cultural differences.  \n \nActivities  that  will  support  better  prepared  teachers  in  primary  education 12  include \n12. \n(i) developing  professional  learning  policy  frameworks;  (ii)  training  teachers  on  literacy  and \nnumeracy  across  the  curriculum  within  a  quality  pedagogy  framework;  (iii)  improving  alignment \nbetween preservice  teacher  education and  in-service  teacher  education; (iv)  establishing  a  new \n\n                                                \n8  World Bank Data, 2015. http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL  \n9  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n10  Open educational resources. https://www.oercommons.org/  \n11  The  quality  pedagogy  framework  uses  evidence-based  factors  required  for  improving  student  learning:  social \ninteraction, prior knowledge, learning outcomes and success criteria, time and varied opportunities for learning, active \nprocesses, relevant and meaningful activities, assessment for learning, reflection, and teacher expectations. These \nkey components need to be understood and modeled in all lessons in college courses by teacher educators, and by \nall trainees in their classroom practice, so that the processes become internalized. The framework is also central to \nall professional learning offered by the MOE and/or the National Department of Education (NDOE) and explicit in all \nmaterials and templates used for preservice and in-service teacher education. \n\n12  Primary education in both the RMI and FSM generally includes grades 1\u20138, with kindergarten classes attached to \nprimary schools. The project will place greater emphasis on kindergarten to grade 6. High school comprises grades \n9\u201312. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nsystem  of  lead  teachers  and  induction  that  at  least  40%  of  schools  will  implement;  and \n(v) developing career pathways for teachers. \n \n13. \nOutput 2: Capacity to use student assessment to improve learning strengthened. The \nquality,  validity,  and  utility  of  current  student  assessment  tools  raise  some  concerns,  and  the \npolicies and practices that enable their successful implementation need to be reviewed. The project \nwill expand the knowledge base of DOE and MOE staff and schools about principles and guidelines \nfrom  current  research  on  student  learning  assessment  systems.  DOE  and  MOE  officials  and \nstakeholders  will  be  provided  with  a  framework  for  discussion  and,  with  technical  support, \nparticipate  in the  development  of  a  sound  and sustainable  student  assessment  system  that  will \nsupport improved education, quality, and learning for all.13 \n \nThe project will support a review and exploration of student assessment systems, including \n14. \nthe  use  of  alternative  assessments,  to  inform  the  development  of  a  new  national  student \nassessment  policy  framework  in  each  country. 14  The  frameworks  will  comprise  policies  and \nprocesses that will strengthen the capacity of the system to use assessment to improve learning. \nThrough government teachers\u2019 academy and institute training programs,  the project will support \nclassroom assessment practices that inform teaching and learning. At least 50% of teachers will \nuse  student  assessment  data  to  tailor  teaching practice  to  meet  student  learning  needs,  and  at \nleast 50% of teachers will use alternative assessments such as early grade learning assessment \nand short assessments in literacy and mathematics. Activities will include strengthening policy and \npractice by (i) establishing a student assessment policy framework, and (ii) training teachers on \nalternative assessments for learning. \n \n15. \nOutput 3: Access to and usage of teaching and learning resources and materials for \nliteracy and numeracy expanded. The project will support the RMI and FSM to strengthen their \ninventory of existing resources and materials for teaching and learning. Many types of resources \nbeyond  textbooks\u2014such  as  readers  in  the  vernacular  language,  hands-on  manipulatives  for \nnumeracy skills, e-resources, open education resources, and low-cost mobile learning tools\u2014will \nbe used to address a range of learners, including in more rural and/or remote outer islands without \ninternet  services.  At  least  75%  of  teachers  will  access  resources  through  flash  drives,  online \ncatalogues,  or  a  resource  center;  and  at  least  90%  of  teachers  will  participate  in  professional \nlearning on using resources to improve learning.  Activities will include (i) the establishment of a \nnew resource center in the RMI and, possibly, the FSM; (ii) the development of multiple types of \nteaching and learning resources including prints, digital, and hands-on manipulative resources; and \n(iii) supporting community and school partnerships in developing teaching and learning resources. \n \n16. \nOutput 4: Educational leadership and management of schools, including parent and \ncommunity engagement, strengthened. Strong leadership and management in schools is critical \nto enable effective teaching and learning to occur. The professional learning framework described \nin output 1 will include important policies, process, and structures developed during the project that \nwill support principals as well as teachers. New principal performance standards developed by the \nNDOE and MOE that highlight educational leadership will guide professional learning opportunities \nto  strengthen  effective  management  skills  and  capabilities  to  be  a  leader  of  learning,  including \ncommunity participation. At least 90% of principals will participate in such professional learning. \n\n                                                \n13  M. Clarke. 2012. What Matters Most for Student Assessment Systems: A Framework Paper. Systems Approach for \n\nBetter Education Results (SABER) Student Assessment Working Paper. No. 1. Washington, DC: World Bank. \n\n14  Alternative assessments are not only designed and structured differently from traditional tests, but are also graded or \nscored differently. They measure performance in forms other than traditional paper-and-pencil and multiple choice \nand  short  answer  tests.  The  early  grade  learning  assessment  and  short  assessments  for  literacy  and  short \nassessments for mathematics are examples of alternative assessments. \n\n\f \n17. \nParental engagement is critical to supporting and ensuring the key areas of teacher quality \nand school leadership. The project will conduct wide stakeholder consultations with parents and \ncivil  society  to  develop  and  support  the  implementation  of  strategies  to  promote  broad  public \nawareness  of  the  importance  of  education  and  increased  parental  engagement  in  education  as \nfundamental  to  improving  the  school  readiness  of  students.

Both countries will have project start-\nup  support,  focusing  on  procurement  and  financial  management.  The  project  will  also  support \npartnership  agreements  between  the  DOE  and  MOE  and  two  colleges  and  a  university\u2014the \nCollege  of  the  Marshall  Islands,  the  University  of  the  South  Pacific  (RMI),  and  the  College  of \nMicronesia (FSM).

It is reasonable to expect that system-wide improvements in quality \neducation in bilingual and multilingual contexts will benefit all students in public education in the \nRMI and FSM. Such benefits will be quantified as incremental benefits of basic education, resulting \nfrom improved student learning outcomes as measured by national assessments. \n \n24. \nThe economic analysis confirms that  the economic rationale for the  project is sound, the \ncase for ADB involvement in the project is sound, and the project design represents a cost-effective \noption for reaching project objectives. The project is nonrevenue generating, so a financial internal \nrate of return and financial net present value cannot be calculated. Since no investments will be \nmade in tangible assets such as civil works, it is not necessary to demonstrate ability to allocate \nfunds  for  maintenance  of  assets  through  the  government  budget.  The  financial  commitment \nrequired  from  government  is  to  allocate  funds  in  the  budget  during  each  year  of  project \nimplementation as counterpart funding for the project. \n  \n25. \nThe  financial  analysis  assessed  the  sustainability  of  the  project  at  national  and  project \nlevels,  and evaluated the impact  of  the proposed investment given  current  and  projected  public \neducation subsector funding levels. The analysis concluded that the government has the capacity \nto absorb and sustain the costs of the project, but that institutional strengthening of both the RMI \nMOE and the FSM national and state departments of education is required. \n \nThe project will not impose unsustainable costs on the system after it ends, as it is designed \n26. \nto minimize downstream recurrent costs. The medium-term fiscal outlook for both countries is not \nencouraging, however, and with the end of the Compact sector grants in FY2023, the delivery of \nbasic  social  services  could  be  problematic  without  significant  reforms  being  implemented  or \nalternative external support identified. \n \n27. \nThe project is based on several assumptions about the determinants of early grade learning \noutcomes. To mitigate risks, it is proposed to (i) monitor progress in reforms targeted at providing \nfiscal space; (ii) conduct a robust demand analysis early in project implementation; (iii) strengthen \nMOE and DOE capacity to conduct research and policy analyses related to key assumptions; and \n(iv) include a mid-project review and exit strategy if outstanding risks have not been addressed. \n \nB. \n \n28. \nFinancial  management  and  procurement  capacity  assessments  were  carried  out  at  the \ncountry  and  executing  agency  levels  in  both  countries.  Assessment  of  financial  management \ncapacity  included  accounting,  internal  control,  disbursement,  cash  flow  management,  financial \nreporting,  and  auditing.  Procurement  capacity  assessment  included  rules  and  regulations \ngoverning procurement practices, staff capacity, knowledge and experience of procurement staff, \nprocedures, transparency, and integrity of procurement practices. Findings indicate that legal and \nregulatory  frameworks  as  well  as  standard  operating  procedures  are  in  place  for  financial  and \nprocurement  management,  and  are  followed  by  ministries  and  departments  concerned  in  each \ncountry.  The  executing  agency  in  each  country  has  staff  to  handle  financial  and  procurement \nmanagement under the project. Computerized accounting and reporting systems (FundWare and \n4-Gov Fund Accounting) are used in the RMI for financial management, but some functions such \nas  bank  reconciliation  and  fixed  assets  management  are  still  being  done  manually.  These \nweaknesses will be strengthened during project implementation. Periodic financial reporting needs \nto be improved and some internal audit oversight needs to be established to assess and develop \ninternal controls. Retention of experienced staff remains the most important factor for good financial \nmanagement. The overall inherent risk and control risk have been assessed moderate. \n \n\nGovernance \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nBoth  countries  have  a  well-established  public  procurement  system,  governed  by  the \n29. \nProcurement Code for the RMI and the Financial Management Regulations for the FSM. The public \nprocurement  systems  in  both  countries  ensure  transparency,  accountability,  efficiency,  and \nresponsibilities,  among  others,  of  government  agencies  and  individuals  involved  in  carrying  out \nprocurement  activities.  The  overall  procurement  risks  in  both  countries  have  been  assessed \naverage. All procurement will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time \nto time) and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the \ngovernments  and,  as  executing  agencies,  the  FSM  National  Department  of  Finance  and \nAdministration, and RMI Ministry of Finance. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \n \nC. \n \n30. \nA social, poverty, and gender analysis undertaken determined that the project\u2019s objectives \nand  goals  are  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Pacific  regional  strategies  and  both  countries\u2019  national \ndevelopment  plans.  A  gender  action  plan  (GAP),  stakeholder  communication  strategy,  and \nsummary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  inputs  were  prepared.  At  the  initial  poverty  and \nsocial  analysis  stage,  the  project  was  classified  general  intervention.  The  project  is  categorized \neffective  gender  mainstreaming,  and  includes  sex-disaggregated  data  in the  project  design  and \nmonitoring  framework  and  GAP  for  targets  and  baselines  where  possible.  The  GAP  addresses \npotential gender inequality risks and promotes women\u2019s empowerment through targets for equal \nparticipation in project activities. \n \nImplementing agencies and PIUs will be responsible for ensuring that social and gender-\n31. \nrelated  design measures  and targets  are implemented,  properly  resourced,  and monitored. The \nGAP  provides  for  training  on  gender  awareness  to  be  incorporated  into  training  workshops  for \nteachers, principals, and parent and community. The Pacific Community gender specialist in the \nFSM and the Women\u2019s Affairs Unit in Majuro will also support gender focal points identified in the \nPIU and implementing agency of each country. The PIUs will collect sex-disaggregated baseline \ndata, and all project reports will contain sex-disaggregated data. \n \nD. \n \n32. \ncategories are as follows.16 \n \n33. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category C).
