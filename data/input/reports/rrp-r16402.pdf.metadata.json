The  Project  will  employ  community \nmobilization  to  increase  enrollments  and  reduce  dropouts.  It  will \nsupport  improvement  programs  to  bolster  attendance  including \npreprimary  classes,  life-skills  training  and  school  development \nfund  awards  for  school  performance  in  3,400  existing  and \nupgraded  elementary  schools.  The  Project  will  build  capacity  at \nthe  school-community,  subdistrict,  district,  and  provincial \neducation  offices  to  better  plan,  manage,  budget,  and  monitor \nschool  performance,  especially  attendance,  and  to  strengthen \nlocal decision making and accountability. \n \nSindh Province wants to invest in its children so that they become \ngood, productive citizens who will participate in the economy and \nthe society. A province-wide public elementary school system will \nensure a quality public good equitably provided through targeting \nspecial  groups  to  help  reduce  poverty.  The  Provincial  Education \nDepartment  will  encourage  a  more  open  market  for  basic \neducational  services  by  providing \ninformation  on  school \nperformance  and  ensuring  universal  access,  especially  to  those \ngroups  least  able  to  afford  elementary  education.  The  Sindh \nGovernment  is  aware  that  economic  development  and  poverty \nreduction  are  dependent  on  a  strong \nfoundation  of  basic \neducation  and  adult  literacy  in  the  population.  The  Millennium \nGoals  suggest  that,  unless  students  acquire  about  8  years  of \neducation, the numerous benefits of education may be lost.  \n \nThe  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  increase  access  to  a  pro-poor \ndecentralized  public  elementary  school  system  with  60%  of  the \nbeneficiaries  being  the  rural  poor  coming  from  the  lowest  40% \nincome distribution. Increased access to elementary education will \nraise retention rates, especially for girls and the rural poor, leading \nto greater numbers continuing on to further schooling and to wider \njob  opportunities  for  those  leaving  school  after  class  8.  The \nProject  will  raise  the  quality  of  elementary  education  through \nteacher \nprovision  of  stipends,  scholarships, \ntraining, and incentives to enable students to benefit from quality \neducation.  It  will  strengthen  decentralized  management  at  the \nprovincial,  district,  and  subdistrict  levels.  It  will  strengthen  the \npublic  school  system  to  more  equitably  provide  public  goods  to \nfemales  and  the  poor  in  the  newly  decentralized  education \n\ntextbooks, \n\nfree \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \n\nsystem. By providing access to quality education, the Project will \nreduce inequities between public and private schools in Sindh. \n \nThe  project  area  includes  all  16  districts  in  Sindh  including  poor \nurban slums in Karachi. In each district, the Project will strengthen \n(i)  the  district  education  office,  where  district  education  officers \nreside  and  where  planning,  administration,  and  budgeting  take \nplace;  (ii) the  subdistrict  education  offices,  where  the  deputy \nexecutive  district  officer  (education)  resides  and  decisions  are \ntaken  on  prioritizing  school  plans;  and  (iii) school  management \ncommittees  (SMCs),  where  parents  and  teachers  decide  school \npriorities.  The  Provincial  Education  Office  employs  a  formula  to \ndistribute  funds  based  on  population  and  need,  and  the  Project \nwill  fill  funding  gaps  in  the  provision  of  resources  to  rehabilitate \nand  upgrade  schools  based  on  local  needs  assessments.  It  will \nalso  help \nthrough  nongovernment \norganizations,  community-based  organizations,  and  experts \nemploying  new  programs  in  preprimary  education,  life  skills, \nmadrasah  curriculum  training,  and  school  development  funds  for \nimproved student attendance and teacher performance. \n \nThe  estimated  project  cost  is  $97  million  equivalent,  of  which \n$18.8 million (19%) is the foreign exchange cost and $78.2 million \nequivalent (81%) is the local currency cost.  \n \n\nto  mobilize  communities \n\n($ million)\n\nTotal \n\n0 \n18.8 \n18.8 \n\n22.0 \n56.2 \n78.2 \n\nForeign \nCurrency \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\n \nTotal \n22.0 \n75.0 \n97.0 \n\nPercent \n23 \n77 \n100 \n\n \nSource \nGovernment \nADB \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \n \nIt is proposed that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provide a \nloan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights \n56,411,000  ($75  million  equivalent)  from  the  Asian  Development \nFund.  The  loan  will  have  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  8  years,  with  an  interest  charge  of  1%  per  year  during \nthe  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  year  thereafter.  ADB  will  finance \n100% of the foreign exchange cost of the Project, and 72% of the \nlocal  cost.  The  Government  will  finance  about  $22  million \nequivalent in local currency. The Government\u2019s share will include \nthe  financing  of  taxes  and  duties,  incremental  recurrent  costs \nincurred  under  the  Project,  and  civil  works.  Contributions  for  civil \nworks  provided  by  communities  may  also  serve  as  part  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s share. \n \nUntil 30 June 2009 \n \n31 December 2008 \n\n\fImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n  v\n\nless  may  be  procured \n\nto  cost  $500,000  or \nthe  borrower's \n\nThe  implementing  agencies  will  be  the  16  district  education \noffices,  which  will  be  responsible \nfor  day-to-day  planning, \nmanagement,  and  implementation  of  project  activities  in  the \ndistrict and will report to Executing Agency. \n \nSindh Provincial Education Department  \n \nAll  ADB-financed  procurement  for  the  Project  will  follow  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  Procurement.

A  large  number  of  domestic \nconsultants  are  required  because  of  the  Project\u2019s  emphasis  on \ndistrict  education  office  and  SMC  capacity  building,  monitoring, \nand  district-  and  school-based  project  implementation.

It  provides \nimproved  education  including  preprimary  programs,  madrasah \nstaff training, life-skills, and school development funds to provide \nincentives  for  teachers  based  on  school  performance.  These \nprograms  along  with  needs-based  rehabilitation  for  boundary \nwalls,  toilets,  water  pumps,  additional  classrooms,  furniture, \n\ninclude  support \n\n\f \nRisks and Assumptions \n\nvi \n\n \n\n \n\nbooks,  and  staff  training  are  designed  to  raise  the  quality  and \nefficiency of school learning to reduce the dropout rate from 10% \nto  5%  in  classes  1-8  and  increase  class  8  completion  rates  from \n38%  to  55%  within  3  years  after  Project  completion.  Project \nbenefits also include extensive training in community mobilization \nfor parents; teachers; administrators; and subdistrict, district, and \nprovincial education officers to improve planning and monitoring of \nschool operations.  \n \nBeneficiaries include up to one million elementary school students \nin  3,400  elementary  schools  throughout  Sindh  including  1,400 \nupgraded  classes  1-5  primary  schools  to  classes  1-8  elementary \nschools.  About  250  shelterless  schools  will  be  supported,  and \nstudents  attending  classes  6-8  in  madrasah  schools.  About \n15,000  teachers  will  benefit  from  training  along  with  an  equal \nnumber  of  SMC  members,  administrators  in  1,800  union  council \noffices,  102  subdistrict  offices,  16  district  offices,  and  the \nprovincial education departments in Karachi and branch offices in \neach of four other regions of Sindh. The Project targets the rural \npoor  so  at  least  60%  of  beneficiaries  will  come  from  the  lowest \ntwo  economic  quintiles.  About  two-thirds  of  project  beneficiaries \nwill be female. \n \nThere are two project risks. The first has to do with the recurrent \ncosts needed for sustainability, especially after project completion. \nUpgrading  over  1,200  schools  to  full  elementary  schools  will \nrequire  additional  staff  based  on  a  decision  from  the  Sindh \nFinance Department to create and then fill sanctioned posts by the \nend  of  the  Project.  Teacher  scholarships,  incentives,  and  flexible \ncontracting  will  help  meet  recruitment  targets.  The  Project  will \nprovide incremental recurrent costs to cover the hiring of teachers \nduring project implementation when delays in appointments might \naffect  progress.  Covenants  include  assurances  that  Government \nwill  take  decisions  to  appoint  adequate  numbers  of  teachers  for \nproject  schools  before  project  completion.  The  sustainability  of \nstipends  and  free  textbooks  is  based  on  assurances  that  the \nGovernment  will  fund  these  interventions  for  girls  in  classes  6-8 \nafter project completion. \n \nThe  second  project  risk  has  to  do  with  Pakistan\u2019s  newly \ndecentralized  system  of  power  sharing.  The  plan  delegates \ndecision  making  to  the  local  level  so  that  stakeholders  take \nresponsibility \nfunctioning  of  schools.  As \ndecentralization is new, it is still unproven. The Project will provide \nfunds  for  continuous  training  of  provincial,  district,  and  local \neducation staff to supplement ongoing efforts by the Government. \nThe  Project  also  provides  incentives  in  the  form  of  innovative \nprograms for communities and local administrators to choose from \nin  assuming  responsibility  for  the  education  of  children  in  each \ncommunity.  Other  ADB  and  funding  agency  adjustment  credits \nand policy reform program loans that support decentralization will \nalso ensure that adequate funds are provided to the districts. \n\nthe  proper \n\nfor \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \n\n \n1. \nthe Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Decentralized Elementary Education Project (Sindh). \n \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nFor  years,  Pakistan  has  struggled  to  achieve  universal  primary  education  (classes  1-5) \nespecially  in  rural  areas  and  for  females.  Throughout  the  1990s,  gross  enrollment  rates  for \nprimary schooling increased from about 64% to 72%, while during the same period literacy rates \nfor those over age 10 years increased from about 34% to 45%. Enrollments in rural areas have \nincreased from 30% to 40%, while the gender gap has narrowed in favor of girls from about 40% \nto  30%  during  the  same  period.  These  accomplishments  have  taken  place  while  overall \npopulation  growth  has  expanded  at  about  2%  per  annum,  implying  that  enrollment  growth  has \naveraged  almost  3%  per  year.  In  general,  Pakistan  made  progress  in  spite  of  the  Asian  Crisis, \nwhich limited growth in the economy and accompanying curtailment of resources for education. \nThis  was  in  part  due  specifically  to  the  externally  assisted  Social  Action  Program  (SAP)  and \naccompanying  investment  projects  implemented  especially  in  the  early  1990s  to  upgrade \nschools.1  \n \nThe  province  of  Sindh  accounts  for  about  25%  of  the  total  class  1-8  elementary  school-\n3. \naged  children  in  Pakistan.  Primary  school  enrollments  in  Sindh  mirror  those  for  the  nation,  as \nabout 67% of eligible students in Sindh attended classes 1-5 primary schools in 2000. However, \nonly 38% of 12-14 year olds in Sindh who graduated from primary schools progress to classes 6-\n8. This number is below the national average and, more importantly, has been dropping over the \npast 8 years from about 50% to 38% due to lack of expansion to accommodate larger cohorts of \nprimary school graduates. Furthermore, the private sector accounts for about about one third of \nthe classes 6-8 enrollment in Sindh, of whom almost all come from urban areas and families with \nincome above the median. The public sector school system accounts for about two thirds of class \n6-8 enrollment mostly from small towns and villages, where children come from poor families. The \npublic  elementary  school  system  is  pro-poor  because  it  meets  the  needs  of  the  poor  in  rural \ncommunities. In the absence of private girls schools in rural areas, girls must rely on the public \nsystem  for  education.  It  is  understaffed  due  to  difficulties  in  providing  class  1-8  schools  in  rural \ncommunities,  where  attitudes  toward  education,  especially  for  girls,  are  often  not  conducive  to \nschool attendance. In Sindh, inequities between the public and private elementary system mirror \nthe general inequities between rural and urban households. Because of the low quality of public \nschooling,  many  students  from  poor  families  are  gravitating  towards  the  madrasahs,  where \neducation is often narrowly focused on religious studies to the exclusion of broader subjects. \n \n4. \nBased  on  an  analysis  of  household  surveys  and  social  impact  assessments,  Sindh \nrequested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  help  accelerate  the  expansion  of  class  1-8 \nelementary  education  to  meet  the  Millennium  Goals  to  provide  a  strong  foundation  for  pro-poor \neconomic  recovery  and  poverty  reduction.  Sindh  wishes  to  follow  the  example  of  Punjab \nProvince,  which  already  provides  public  elementary  education.  With  only  about  38%  of \n                                                 \n1  School enrollment analysis carried out under SAP suggested that growth stagnated in the late 1990s even though \nmore  girls  than  boys  enrolled  and  large  numbers  of  urban  students  deserted  public  for  private  schools  during  that \nsame  period.  It  is  likely  that,  once  adjustments  are  made  for  withdrawal  of  the  middle  class  from  urban  public \nschools, the public school enrollment growth of girls and the rural poor actually increased in the late 1990s. \n\n\f 2 \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nelementary  school  children  enrolled,  it  is  difficult  to  change  attitudes  and  behaviors  until  the \nmajority of the two million eligible 10-12 year olds are exposed to new ideas through schooling. \nOnly when the majority of Sindh children at a fairly young age are exposed to modern ideas and \nconcepts can reproductive health, consumer choice, good citizenship, and social mobility occur in \nrural communities. Significant improvements are needed for rural schools to enroll at least 50% of \nthe age cohort attending classes 1-8 (Appendix 1). \n \nB. \n \n5. \nClass  1-8  elementary  education  in  Sindh  faces  several  major  constraints.  Administrative \ncapacity  has  traditionally  been  weak  and  poorly  financed,  giving  priority  to  classes  1-5  primary \nschools.  Social  service  delivery  has  been  inefficient,  top  down,  and  lacking  local  control.  Under \nthe devolution of powers to districts that occurred in August 2001, various levels of government \nincluding  districts,  subdistricts  and  union  councils  have  had  their  staff  increased  and  provided \nwith general training in the new rules and procedures. Administration and funding decisions have \nbeen  delegated  so  that  communities  and  schools  have  more  autonomy  in  prioritizing  needs. \nNongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  community  volunteers,  and  school  management \ncommittees (SMCs) have been given more leeway to work as stakeholders to strengthen schools. \nInstitutional reforms under devolution have given authority to elected officials in combination with \nstrengthening  of  SMCs  and  school  development  funds  (SDFs)  through  revised  guidelines  for \nstaffing assignments, auditing, and planning. An example of local delegation of decision making \nincludes  training  in  planning  and  monitoring  of  school  improvement  so  that  rehabilitation  and \nupgrading primary to elementary schools can be made based on need (Appendix 2).  \n \nUnder  SAP,  multisector  approaches  to  education  policy  planning  and  budgeting  took \n6. \nshape  for  the  first  time.  From  this  approach,  the  federal  and  provincial  governments  along  with \nexternal  aid  agencies  began  developing  sector-wide  approaches  employing  annual  operational \nplans  and  data  collection  from  educational  management  information  systems  in  each  province. \nADB is contributing to these efforts by focusing on Sindh province, where external assistance is \nweak but where the need is great and government commitment is high. This has led to looking at \na long-term strategy to rationalize assistance under the newly emerging devolved social service \ndelivery  with  emphasis  on  the  elementary  school  subsector.  The  process  approach  to  the \nsubsector supports the Millennium Goals of universal elementary education by 2015. It goes hand \nin  hand  with  the  implementation  of  devolution,  as  ADB  is  reinforcing  district  education  plans  for \nthe  subsector  that  will  yield  a  performance-based  monitoring  of  school  facilities,  staffing,  and \nresources tied to growth in school enrollments. ADB assistance to Sindh will be shared with other \nprovinces  and  with  other  aid  agencies  working  in  other  subsectors,  so  lessons  learned  will  get \ndisseminated widely. The investment project fits well with the wider aims of devolution and with \nthe subsector-wide efforts of ADB and other agencies to strengthen citizens' boards and district \nlevel  management  including  ombudsmen  and  to  provide  checks  and  balances  between  elected \nofficials, NGOs, and school beneficiaries. \n \n7. \nFinally, performance-based monitoring of the education system needs to more closely link \ncommunity awareness of school relevance to school enrollment drives. Sindh has an educational \ndatabase,  but  it  does  not  disaggregate  enrollments  for  the  elementary  school  sector  or \ndisaggregate  growth  by  district.  Furthermore,  inputs  are  not  compared  with  outputs,  so  system \nefficiency cannot be measured. ADB efforts to rationalize the elementary school system will help \nto document school improvement in a cost-effective manner so that district education plans can \nbe developed and targets measured. This will help to determine the precise staffing requirements \nbased  on  school  demand,  and  will  also  allow  educators  to  determine  the  effect  of  interventions \nsuch as school stipends on enrollment growth, especially for female students in classes 6-8.  \n \n\n\f  3\n\nThe government strategy of both Pakistan and Sindh Province are designed to link basic \n8. \neducation to poverty reduction, especially through the Education for All targets set by UNESCO2 \nand subscribed to by the governments. Under the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper,3 the \nFederal Government has linked poverty reduction to elementary education through social capital \ncreation to sustain good citizenship, job creation, consumer information, and reproductive health. \nThe  federal  and  provincial  governments  have  initiated  the  Education  Sector  Reform4  (ESR) \nAction Program, which aims to raise gross enrollments as well as expand primary to elementary \neducation.  The  ESR  is  the  Government\u2019s  education  policy  and  includes  elementary  education, \nmadrassah  education,  and  support  for  district  education  offices  and  SMCs.  Development \nexpenditure  gaps  identified  under  the  ESR  will  be  funded  by  external  grants  and  through  this \nproject  in  the  form  of  development  funds  for  innovative  programs  such  as  preprimary \n(kindergarten)  and  elementary  education,  and  community  mobilization \nthrough  school \ndevelopment  funds.  The  Project  will  strengthen  ongoing  programs  to  support  local  teacher \nrecruitment and training, facilities and equipment upgrading, and district planning.  \n \nThe Government already has initiated its Devolution of Power5 plan for local government, \n9. \nwhich  is  expected  to  fundamentally  alter  the  way  educational  service  delivery  is  provided \n(Appendix 3). Devolution supports governance through greater transparency, an increase in the \nnumber  of  stakeholders,  greater  accountability  including  financial  auditing,  and  civil  service \nreform  devolving  more  staff  to  the  local  level.  The  Project  will  strengthen  many  of  these  goals \nthrough  provision  of  additional  funds  and  training  to  increase  stakeholder  participation  and  to \nraise  the  level  of  educational  services  to  meet  stakeholder  expectations.  Equally  important,  the \nProject  will  support  institutional  strengthening  at  the  provincial,  district,  and  subdistrict  levels \nthrough  needs-based  provision  of  development  funds  for  elementary  education  targeted  for \ncommunities. The Government of Sindh has initiated major financial reforms to strengthen social \nservice  financing  through  increased  provincial  allocations,  fiscal  restructuring,  federal  support, \nsupport  of  the  international  community  and  public-private  partnerships.  Fiscal  restructuring  has \neliminated  the  need  for  debt  servicing  and  has  freed  up  funds  to  support  education  and  health \nreform in the province. \n \n10. \nA  major  lesson  learned  from  past  involvement  in  education  in  Pakistan  and  Sindh \nconcerns  differentiating  between  macro  policy  planning  versus  micro-level  project  activities  that \nprovide  hands-on  implementation  experience.  During  SAP,  multisector  policies  for  all  provinces \nwere  pursued.  While  SAP  made  progress  in  coordinating  these  policies  across  provinces  and \nsectors,  it  became  clear  that  local  implementation  of  these  policies  including  institution  building \nwas met primarily through large provincial education investment projects by ADB and the World \nBank. Consequently, both investment and program loans work best together to affect change in \neducation.  Another  lesson  learned  is  that  recurrent  costs  for  new  staff  are  important  for \nsustainability.  Previously  the  Government  imposed  recruitment  bans  for  project  school  staff, \nwhich  eventually  jeopardized  project  effectiveness.  To  strengthen  sustainability,  covenants \nseeking  compliance  on  staffing  are  stressed  as  well  as  provision  of  support  mechanisms  under \nthe Project to ease the burden of incremental recurrent cost during project implementation. The \nProject  Performance  Audit  Report  (PPAR)  for  the  Primary  Girls  Education  (Sector)  Project6 \nrecommended  that  teacher  deployment  be  closely  linked  with  enrollments  to  improve  internal \nefficiency  in  primary  schools.  The  link  between  teacher  deployment  and  student  enrollment  is \ncentral  to  building  the  elementary  school  system  in  Sindh.  The  Project  will  address  this  linkage \n\n                                                 \n2  United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). 2002.

The  strategy  encourages  devolution  of  power  to  local  authorities  and \ndecision-making  in  education  necessary  for  stakeholders  to  take  responsibility  for  educational \nservice  delivery.  Finally,  the  ADB  strategy  and  the  Project  support  social  sector  governance8 \nthrough  strengthening  the  implementation  capacity  at  all  levels  of  government  including  SMCs, \nunion  councils,  subdistrict,  district  and  provincial  education  offices  and  staff.  Most  major  aid \nagencies  provide  external  assistance  to  elementary  education  in  Pakistan.  Many  agencies \nparticipated  under  previous  SAP  programs  and  continue  to  support  education  through  the  ESR \nand  Education  for  All  programs  led  by  the  Federal  Ministry  of  Education  employing  a  partial \nsector-wide  approach  to  educational  management.  The  ADB  past  involvement  in  education  in \nSindh Province in conjunction with the Project will make it the lead aid agency in the province to \nsupport  education  including  provision  of  curriculum  and  staff  training  for  madrasahs  schools \n(Appendix 4). \n \n12.  Major  external  technical  assistance  to  education  in  Sindh  consists  of  macro-  and  micro-\nlevel approaches that support the Project. The World Bank plans a Provincial Adjustment Credit \nProgram  loan  in  2002  to  strengthen  financial  and  social  sector  policy  reform  along  with  ADB \nsupport  for  devolution.  Funds  provided  will  be  used  to  guarantee  additional  resources  for  the \nsocial sectors to support investment projects. Other externally funded interventions in Sindh with \nthe  European  Commission  as  designated  coordinator  involve  grant  funding  targeted  for  specific \npilot programs, many of which will reinforce the activities under the Project. These include (i) the \nEuropean  Commission  to  develop  training  for  local  officials  in  new  devolution  procedures; \n(ii) Nordic Aid to Development technical assistance to help strengthen SMCs; (iii) United Nations \nChildren's Fund to support the Children in School Program in one district and community support \nfor  rural  school  programs  through  the  Sindh  Education  Foundation;  (iv) United  States  Aid  to \nInternational  Development  to  support  basic  education  including  standard  setting  in  madrasahs; \nand  (v) Canadian  International  Development  Agency  technical  assistance  for  early  childhood \nactivities including development of curriculum and materials for preschools.  \n \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nObjective \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  objective  of  the  Project9  is  to  increase  access  to  a  pro-poor  decentralized  public \n13. \nelementary  school  system.  Approximately  60%  of  the  beneficiaries  will  be  rural  children, \nespecially  girls,  coming  from  families  in  the  lowest  40%  income  level.  Increased  access  to \nelementary education will raise retention rates, especially for girls and the rural poor, leading to \ngreater  numbers  continuing  on  to  further  schooling  and  to  wider  job  opportunities  for  those \nleaving  school  after  class  8.  The  Project  will  raise  the  quality  of  elementary  education  through \nprovision  of  stipends,  scholarships,  free  textbooks,  teacher  training,  and  incentives  to  enable \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 1996.

It  will  strengthen  decentralized  management  at  the \nprovincial,  district,  and  subdistrict  levels.  It  will  strengthen  the  public  school  system  to  more \nequitably  provide  public  goods  to  females  and  the  poor  in  the  newly  decentralized  education \nsystem.  By  providing  access  to  quality  education,  the  Project  will  reduce  inequities  between \npublic and private schools in Sindh. \n \n14. \nThe project area includes all 16 districts in Sindh including poor urban slums in Karachi. In \neach  district,  the  Project  will  strengthen  (i)  the  district  education  office,  where  district  education \nofficers  reside  and  where  planning,  administration,  and  budgeting  take  place;  (ii) the  subdistrict \neducation  offices  where  the  deputy  executive  district  officers  (education)  (EDO)  reside  and \ndecisions  are  taken  on  prioritizing  school  plans;  and  (iii) SMCs,  where  parents  and  teachers \ndecide  school  priorities.  The  Provincial  Education  Office  employs  a  formula  to  distribute  funds \nbased on population and need, and the Project will fill funding gaps in the provision of resources \nto  rehabilitate  and  upgrade  schools  based  on  local  needs  assessments.  It  will  also  help  to \nmobilize  communities  through  NGOs,  community-based  organizations  (CBOs),  and  experts \nemploying  new  programs  in  preprimary  education,  life  skills,  madrasah  curriculum  training,  and \nschool development funds for improved student attendance and teacher performance. \n \nB. \n \n15. \nstudents, (iii) school quality improvements, and (iv) capacity building at the district offices. \n \n \n \n16. \nThe first component builds access, especially for girls in rural areas, through needs-based \nassessment  among  the  community,  teachers  and  school  administrators.  Outputs  include \n(i) rehabilitation  and  upgrade  of  1,200  primary  to  elementary  schools  (65%  female  schools)  to \nincrease  enrollments  of  the  age  cohort  from  38%  to  55%  (25%  to  45%  for  females)  through \ndropout  prevention  and  classroom  efficiency  for  classes  6-8;  (ii)  establishment  of  two  English \nMedium Model Schools (one for boys/one for girls) in each of 102 subdistricts; (iii) establishment \nof 1,000 preprimary classes in selective elementary schools (50% female) to promote age-class \nstandardization  and  encourage  enrollment  of  the  young  to  improve  socialization  skills  and  raise \nawareness of the importance of education; and (iv) conversion of 100 existing shelterless primary \nschools to elementary schools through community support and participation.  \n \nKey  activities  include  mobilization  of  SMCs  and  subdistrict  education  administrators  to \n17. \nidentify needs-based priorities for schools (e.g., separate toilets for male and female students and \nstaff,  sitting  room  for  female  teachers,  additional  classrooms,  boundary  wall,  water  pump, \nfurniture,  books,  staff  training)  and  to  prepare  school  and  district  plans  to  improve  elementary \neducation.  These  school  action  plans  will  be  tied  to  enrollment  projection  awareness  and \nstrategies  to  ensure  that  facilities  are  tied  to  enrollment  growth.  Other  activities  include  district \nlevel  education  planning  to  ensure  that  the  network  of  elementary  schools  covers  each  district \nand provincial monitoring to ensure that the public elementary system is adequately staffed and \nequitably serves the entire province.  \n \n \n \nComponent  two  will  provide  community  support  to  increase  the  social  demand  for  girls\u2019 \n18. \neducation through (i) support for 3,400 SMC SDFs to encourage innovative programs to increase \nattendance and reduce dropout; (ii) free textbooks for all girls in classes 6-8; (iii) stipends for all \ngirls qualified on the basis of merit and need in class 8 who proceed to class 9-12; (iv) teacher \n\nSupport for Girls\u2019 Education \n\n2. \n\n\f 6 \n\n3. \n\nQuality Improvement Training \n\nscholarships  for  female  matriculates  from  local  communities  to  attend  classes  11-14  with  the \nexpressed  purpose  of  attaining  a  bachelor  of  education  degree  for  teaching  classes  6-8; \n(v) support for public awareness campaign and provision of school learning materials; (vi) support \nfor  a  life  skills  program;  and  (vii)  local  fellowships  for  studies  for  115  district  educators  (7  per \ndistrict and 35% female) to boost the number of qualified administrators in the districts.  \n \n19. \nThe key activities required to accomplish these goals include the use of NGOs to develop \nand introduce enrollment drive programs, textbook distribution, scholarships, life skills awareness, \nmaterials,  and  staff  training  to  widen  curriculum  in  madrasahs;  school  performance  reward \nprograms; and management training for SDF savings accounts. SMC members including parents, \nteachers, male and female counselors, NGO/CBO representatives, and school officials from the \nunion council will be included in the activities to introduce and regularize these programs in the \npublic elementary school system in Sindh.  \n \n \n \nThe  third  component  supports  (i)  local  training  of  SMC  members  including  NGOs  and \n20. \nCBOs in school management programs; (ii) inservice training of master trainers and new class 6-\n8  teachers  in  curriculum  and  pedagogy,  to  be  carried  out  at  the  district  level  with  special \nemphasis  on  madrasah  education,  English  language,  and  life  skills  training;  (iii)  administrative \ntraining  for  subdistrict,  district,  and  provincial  officers  in  planning,  budgeting,  and  monitoring; \n(iv) preprimary school training of 1,000 teachers and teacher aides; and (v) development funds to \nsupport decentralization of education management and implementation of a performance-based \nmanagement system at district level. Districts will undertake training through the use of their own \nstaff,  NGOs,  and  universities  to  support  SMCs  in  the  use  of  SDFs  and  preparation  of  school \nplans. Districts will also decide the venue to train new class 6-8 teachers, and the province will \ncoordinate across districts by providing master trainers. Training for class 6-8 teachers in those \nmadrasahs  with  students  sitting  for  public  examinations  after  class  5  and  8  will  be  provided \ntraining in the use of core curriculum textbooks (math, science, social studies, language, and life \nskills). Teachers completing training will be provided a set of 50 textbooks for their class. Districts \nwill also undertake training of teachers and teacher aides in preprimary education. \n \nThe  activities  menu  to  train  community-school  staff  and  representatives  will  include \n21. \nteacher  academic  in-service  training  to  be  engaged  by  the  province  through  the  provincial \ninstitutes of teacher education (PITEs), and training in effective textbook application for all female \nelementary  school  teachers.  Training  for  SMCs  and  school  staff  will  be  carried  out  in  union \ncouncil,  subdistrict,  and  district  office  facilities  for  outreach  training  in  financial  budgeting  and \nmonitoring  of  SDFs,  implementing  life  skills  training,  preprimary  school  programs,  SDF \nmanagement,  enrollment  projection  training,  school  planning,  and  administration  to  prioritize \nneeds.  \n \n \n \n22. \nThe  fourth  component  provides  capacity  building  linked  to  devolution  to  sustain  those \nquality  improvements  and  increased  student  access  through  training  provincial,  16  district,  and \n102 subdistrict officials and 3,400 school principals in the administration, planning, management, \nand monitoring of school improvements. It includes  \n \n\nCapacity Building for School Decentralization \n\n4. \n\n(i) \n\ntraining  of  about  3,400  school  principals,  headmasters  and  teachers;  102 \nsubdistrict  officials;  16  district  officials;  and  provincial  officials  concerned  with \neducation,  in  administration,  planning,  management  and  monitoring  of  school \nimprovements; \n\n\f  7\n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\nstrengthening of 102 subdistrict education offices and 16 district education offices \nthrough staff training and provision of equipment and facilities, including recurrent \ncosts; and  \n\nestablishing  and  providing  facilities  for  a  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  in \nKarachi to carry out monitoring and evaluation of the training and aggregating the \ndata collected by the districts. \n\n \n23. \nThe  102  subdistrict  education  offices  and  union  councils  will  be  strengthened  to  monitor \nthose  elementary  schools  in  their  jurisdiction.  Staff  training  among  the  subdistrict  education \nofficers  will  include  administrative  supervision  to  support  and  approve  community  proposals  to \nupgrade  elementary  schools;  staff  training  to  ensure  enrollment  projection  targets  and  data \ncollection; and training in monitoring SDFs. Other local office training will be provided in standard \noffice procedures in planning, budgeting, and administration needed to efficiently carry out duties; \nand  equipment,  computers,  furniture,  facilities,  recurrent  costs,  and  motor  bikes  for  up  to  102 \nsubdistrict offices will be provided to support local monitoring and supervision.  \n \n24. \nActivities conducted by subdistrict education staff include supervision and monitoring the \ntraining carried out by NGO/CBOs among the various SMCs serving elementary schools in each \nof  the  roughly  17  union  councils  found  in  each  of  the  102  subdistrict  in  the  Sindh.  Staff  will \naggregate the data from each of the approximately 10 new and 20 existing elementary schools \nfound in each subdistrict and forward the information to the district for inclusion in the elementary \nschool master plan.  \n \n25. \nThe 16 district level offices will be strengthened to improve their capacity to plan, manage, \nmonitor, and supervise the 102 subdistrict offices under their jurisdiction. Technical experts and \ntrainers will introduce training for education officers in each district in administration, supervision, \nmonitoring  of  enrollments,  pass  rates  and  dropout,  and  work  plans  to  rationalize  elementary \nschools and staffing in each district. Other training in routine administrative tasks under the newly \ndevolved decentralization system will also be provided to improve the efficiency of district offices. \nLearning  materials,  technical  experts  to  provide  training,  funds  for  facilities  rehabilitation, \nfurniture,  computers,  and  a  utility  vehicle  will  be  provided  to  the  16  district  offices  to  ensure \nefficiency of operations. \n \n26. \nProject staff located at the district education office including advisors and ombudsman will \nassist the EDO to conduct project activities throughout the district. The team consultant will work \nclosely with each of about 6 subdistrict deputy executive district officers (EDOs) to ensure that the \ndistrict  program  is  carried  out  successfully  in  each  subdistrict.  The  district  team  will  include  the \nfull-time  district  project  officers  or  seconded  staff  and  driver  to  meet  with  subdistrict  education \nstaff on a regular basis to plan and implement project activities. \n \n27. \nThe  Provincial  Education  Department  (PED)  will  monitor  and  manage  the  elementary \neducation system throughout the province. Outputs include establishment of a PIU in Karachi to \ncarry  out  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  training  and  aggregating  the  data  collected  by  the \ndistricts.  The  province  will  also  be  responsible  for  coordinating  district  in-service  workshops  for \nnew teachers in classes 6-8 during summer vacation to be held at the PITE. Other training to be \ncarried out by the PIU includes training of district level staff in awareness of project activities and \nin the use of imprest account activities, approval of experts and NGOs for project activities, and \nproject studies to rationalize elementary school enrollments and teacher staffing and budgeting. \nInputs  to  complete  these  activities  include  facilities  for  the  PIU  and  offices  such  as  furniture, \nequipment, and computers; a utility vehicle; and consultants.  \n\n\f 8 \n\nSpecial Features \n\n \nC. \n \n28. \nThe  Project  includes  a  number  of  special  features  new  to  education  in  Sindh  Province. \nMany  of  these  features  have  resulted  from  experimentation  in  the  past  on  a  small  scale,  while \nothers have resulted from recent institutional changes such as decentralization and emphasis on \npoverty reduction. Special features include the following: \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nDecentralized  school  administration.  The  Government  of  Pakistan  and  all  the \nprovinces  have  initiated  devolution  of  power  sharing  to  the  districts  and  below. \nStarting in August 2001, the process is under way and represents a major attempt \nat institutional devolution of power to the local elected officials with the expectation \nthat local decision making and authority will lead to greater local accountability and \nefficiency  in  social  service  delivery.  In  education,  prospects  for  spending \nprioritization  and  deployment  of  teachers  on  contract  and  accountable  to  local \nofficials will improve school performance. The Project will support this process by \nlocal  needs \nproviding  development \nassessment  and  will  lead  to  greater  efficiency  in  ensuring  that  resources  are \nutilized  where  they  are  needed.  Under  the  Project,  a  performance-based \nmanagement  system  will  be  implemented  at  the  district  level  to  monitor  the \nequitable  distribution  of  educational  resources  within  the  district  along  with  the \nenrollment  and  attendance  outcomes  on  which  the  resources  get  distributed. \n(Component 3) \n\nthe  districts  based  on \n\nthrough \n\nfunds \n\nRevolving funds. Under the Project, SDF accounts will be used to channel up to \n$1,000  each  to  SMCs  for  a  host  of  innovative  programs  designed  to  improve \nschool  performance.  The  concept  that  local  control  of  resources  for  school \nimprovements is the basis for bottom-up changes in quality will be tested through \nthe use of the SDF. The SDF builds on the existing SMC school account started \nunder SAP but will expand the kinds of support from simple nonschool salary items \nsuch  as  chalk  and  maintenance  to  matching  funds  and  incentives  for  student \nattendance,  to  stipends  for  girls  and  free  textbooks,  to  scholarships  for  female \nteacher  candidates.  These  programs  will  be  administered  through  the  SMC  for \namounts  of  about  $1,000  per  school  (excluding  civil  works)  needed  to  fully \nestablish  elementary  schools.  Funds  will  be  provided  based  on  a  formula  that \nrewards  school  attendance,  enrollment  growth,  and  dropout  reduction.  The \nthe  disbursements  and \nprovincial  project  accounts  officer  will  monitor \nreplenishments  based  on  receipts  provided  by  each  SMC,  and  each  SDF  will  be \naudited annually according to Government regulations. (Component 2) \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\nD. \n \n29. \nThe total cost of the Project is estimated at $97 million equivalent, including physical and \nprice contingencies, taxes, and duties. Of the total cost, $18.8 million (19%) comprises the foreign \nexchange cost, and $78.2 million equivalent (81%) comprises the local currency cost. The Project \ncost  estimate  by  component  is  summarized  in  Table  1.  The  Project  will  support  civil  works  for \nrehabilitating  and  upgrading  primary  to  elementary  schools,  furniture,  equipment,  learning \nmaterials, staff development, specialist services and studies, special programs including stipends, \nscholarships, recurrent costs, taxes, and duties (Appendix 5). \n \n\n\f  9\n\nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\n% of Base \nCost \n\nTotal \n\n \n54.1 \n \n16.8 \n \n5.8 \n \n8.3 \n\n \n4.4 \n \n89.4 \n \n \n \n1.8 \n3.3 \n \n5.1 \n \n2.5 \n \n97.0 \n \n100 \n\n \n43.0 \n \n14.2 \n \n5.8 \n \n6.8 \n\n \n4.4 \n \n74.2 \n \n \n \n1.4 \n2.6 \n \n4.0 \n \n0 \n \n78.2 \n \n81 \n\n \n60 \n \n19 \n \n6 \n \n10 \n\n \n5 \n \n99 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n11.1 \n \n2.6 \n \n0 \n \n1.5 \n\n \n0 \n \n15.2 \n \n \n \n0.4 \n0.7 \n \n1.1 \n \n2.5 \n \n18.8 \n \n19 \n\n \n\n \n\nProject Component \n \nI.

It  is  classified  as  a  poverty  intervention,  targets  females  and  the  poor  in  rural \nareas, and expects pro-poor impacts in reducing inequity in basic education opportunities. Loan \nallocation across districts is based partly on the estimated number of children below the poverty \nline, so poor areas will get additional benefits (Appendix 6).  \n \nF. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n \n32. \nThe  Project  Executing  Agency  will  be  PED  in  Karachi.  A  project  steering  committee \nchaired  by  the  Education  Secretary  and  including  one  elected  nazim,10  two  selected  members \nrepresenting  all  the  16  districts,  finance  and  planning  and  development,  the  PIU  director \n(recording  secretary),  one  SMC  representative  representing  all  16  districts,  and  one \nrepresentative of the community citizen's board will meet every 6 months to review progress and \napprove  plans  for  the  coming  year.  It  will  be  established  within  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness. \nThe PIU will be established by PED and consist of professional staff comprising a director; deputy \ndirector; and accounts, monitoring, evaluation, and procurement officers. Within 3 months of loan \neffectiveness,  each  district  will  assign  a  full  time  district  project  coordinator  (DPC)  to  assist  the \nEDO to implement the project activities. The DPC will be responsible for preparing district plans \nand will request approval of funds from the PIU for project activities. The DPC will also organize \nthe program at the district level and travel to each subdistrict office to help the additional district \nofficer monitor the elementary schools under his/her jurisdiction. The subdistrict education officer \nwill be responsible for monitoring the SMC requests. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  6  years,  starting  in  January  2003,  and  will  be \n33. \ncompleted  in  2009.  All  16  districts  will  provide  deputy  EDOs  and  resources  to  implement  the \nProject in each of the 102 subdistrict education offices in Sindh (Appendix 7).  \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n34. \nThe Project will upgrade 1,200 primary to elementary schools, and 204 subdistrict model \nschools.  About  1,000  elementary  schools  will  receive  facilities  for  preprimary  classrooms, \nfurniture,  equipment,  and  learning  materials.  Furniture,  equipment,  reference/learning  materials, \nand  transport  will  also  be  provided  to  all  district  and  subdistrict  offices.  Procurement  will  follow \nADB's Guidelines for Procurement. Civil works contracts estimated to cost in total the equivalent \nof  more  than  $200,000  will  be  awarded  by  local  competitive  bidding.

These  small-scale  civil  works  for  upgrades, \nrehabilitation,  and  preprimary  classrooms  will  utilize  local  competitive  bidding  and/or  local \nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB  based  on  procedures  already  working  under  ongoing  ADB-\nfinanced  projects  for  design  standards  of  classrooms,  toilets,  boundary  wall,  water  pumps,  and \nmultipurpose classrooms.11  \n \n35. \nSelection  criteria  for  upgrading  primary  to  elementary  schools  (65%  girls\u2019  schools)  have \nalready been determined, and SMCs will have to guarantee meeting the criteria through a brief \nquestionnaire  before  schools  will  be  approved  by  districts.  The  selection  criteria  to  upgrade \ninclude the following: \n \n\n36. \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nmaximum of one upgraded school per union council; \nexisting land adjacent to school, and at least two classrooms and a veranda; \nexisting enrollment of class 5 of at least 20 girls; \nadequate  students  in  the  catchment  area  to  enable  a  minimum  enrollment  of  35 \nstudents per class with at least 20 female students in class 5; and \nSMC commitment to fund 10% of the total cost. \n\n(v) \n \nSelection  criteria  for  choosing  existing  or  new  elementary  schools  for  preprimary \nprograms include the following: \n \n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nSchool already has a kachi12 class with an enrollment of 30. \nSMC will guarantee finding a teacher (trained or untrained). \nSMC  can  show  that  the  preprimary  school  program  will  improve  the  class  1-5 \nenrollment. \nParents will attend meetings. \n\n(iv) \n\n \nEnvironmental  implications  were  reviewed  and  no  significant  adverse  environmental \n37. \nimpacts were identified. All civil works will be limited to existing school areas and will follow ADB's \nEnvironmental Guidelines for Selected Infrastructure Projects. No resettlement or land acquisition \nis required (Appendix 8). \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n38. \nSpecialist services required for a total of 3 person-months of international experts and 714 \nperson-months  of  local  experts  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  acceptable  to  ADB  for  engaging \ndomestic consultants. International consultants may be engaged either as individuals or as a firm. \nIn the event that the consultants are selected as a firm, quality and cost-based selection (QCBS) \nwill be followed. Services of domestic consultants will be engaged in accordance with procedures \nacceptable to ADB. The outline terms of reference for consultants are found in Appendix 9.

Sindh \nprovince has a variety of universities, firms, district master trainer network, and NGOs that have \nexperience  and  expertise  in  delivering  the  kinds  of  activities  required  to  implement  the  Project. \n\n\f  13\n\nEach training program will contain a gender component. Each training activity listed below will be \ncontracted by PED according to procedures acceptable to ADB. Details of the training programs \nare found in Appendix 10. \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\nPreprimary  Materials  and  Training  Program.  Suitable  NGOs,  universities, \nteacher  training  colleges,  institutions,  firms  or  district  master  trainers  will  be \nidentified  to  pull  together  existing  materials  and  equipment  including  training \nmaterials  and  prepare  a  program  to  introduce  preprimary  classes  to  1,000 \nelementary schools throughout the province based on a questionnaire prepared by \nSMCs and reviewed by local and district officials.  \n\nCurriculum  Materials  Training  Program.  Suitable  NGOs,  universities,  teacher \ntraining  colleges,  institutions,  firms  or  district  master  trainers  will  be  selected  to \nconduct  in-service  training  for  master  trainers  and  new  teachers  in  the  use  of \nlearning materials, textbooks, and other school equipment over 6 years of project \nimplementation.  Special  academic  training  will  include  (a)  life  skills  awareness  to \nprepare  an  awareness  campaign  and  materials  for  class  6-8  students  in  3,400 \nschools;  (b)  madrasah  curriculum  modernization  in  mathematics,  science,  social \nstudies,  and  language  on  a  voluntary  basis  to  those  madrasahs  with  students \ntaking tests to enter the formal system in class 6 and 9.  \n\nFinancial  Management  and  School  Development  Fund  Training.  Suitable \nNGOs,  universities,  teacher  training  colleges,  institutions,  firms  or  district  master \ntrainers  will  be  identified  to  design  and  implement  on-the-job  training  for  SMC \nmembers,  to  operate  SDFs  to  accommodate  stipend,  scholarship,  free  textbook, \nand  teacher  incentive  programs  in  each  of  the  3,400  elementary  schools.  The \nSMC  training  will  also  include  shelterless  school  training  to  pilot  innovative \ncommunity mobilization to upgrade about 250 shelterless schools with potential to \nbecome elementary schools. Training will be linked to awareness campaigns and \ninclude  use  of  district  ombudsmen,  community  citizens'  boards,  and  other \nagencies set up under district offices. \n\nSchool  Organization  Management  Program.  Suitable  NGOs,  universities, \nteacher  training  colleges,  institutions,  firms  or  district  master  trainers  will  be \nidentified  to  design  and  implement  on-the-job  training  in  district  and  subdistrict \noffices  for  routine  supervision  and  monitoring  activities  required  to  maintain  an \nactive district-wide work program. \n\n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \nTo  expedite  the  disbursement  of  loan  funds,  the  Government  will  establish  an  imprest \n40. \naccount  at  the  National  Bank  of  Pakistan,  Karachi.  The  imprest  account  will  be  established, \nmanaged, replenished, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, \ndated  January  2001  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon  by  the  Government  of  Sindh  and \nADB.  The  ceiling  for  the  use  of  statement  of  expenditure  (SOE)  procedures  will  be  $100,000 \n(Loan  Disbursement  Handbook,  para.  9.17).  Initially,  the  ceiling  of  the  imprest  account  will  not \nexceed $1 million or $0.250 million for each subaccount. Limits for SDFs and district level imprest \nsubaccounts will be approved by the PIU. The districts and schools will use SOE procedures to \nliquidate advances and keep records and receipts on file. The PIU will disburse funds directly for \nthose  activities  managed  by  the  PIU  including  for  consultants,  province-wide  academic  training, \nand monitoring. Funds for district programs will be transferred to district subaccounts by the PIU \nupon receipt of work plans for eligible items. DEOs will transfer SDFs to SMCs for civil works less \n\n\f 14 \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n\n \n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\nthan $2,500, stipends, teacher scholarships, and innovative programs. The flow of funds will be \nfinalized  by  the  PIU  and  district  offices  and  procedures  noted  in  the  Project  Administration \nMemorandum. \n \nEligible items for disbursement by districts include \n \n\ncivil works budgets for approved rehabilitation and upgrading; \nfurniture budgets \nscience, equipment, computer, preschool furniture, and equipment; \nstaff training; \ntechnical experts for all staff training; and \nall items for disbursement by SMCs. \n\n \nEligible items for disbursement by SMCs include \n\ntextbooks for girls\u2019 schools, \nstipends for needy girls, \nscholarships for female teacher candidates, \nstaff salaries for part-time teacher aides from the community, and \nother innovative programs approved by district officer. \n\n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n41. \nThe  Sindh  Government  will  ensure  that  records  and  accounts  are  maintained  to  identify \nthe goods and services financed from the loan proceeds. Separate accounts for the Project will \nbe maintained and audited annually in accordance with sound auditing standards acceptable to \nADB.  A  separate  opinion  on  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  and  SOE  will  be  included  in  the \nannual audit report. Certified copies of such audited accounts will be submitted to ADB within 12 \nmonths  after  the  close  of  each  fiscal  year.  The  PIU  will  prepare  quarterly  reports  on  the \nimplementation of project-funded activities. The report will be in a format acceptable to ADB, and \nwill indicate progress made against established targets, problems encountered during the quarter, \nsteps  taken  and  steps  proposed  to  resolve  the  problems,  compliance  with  loan  covenants,  and \nproject  activities  to  be  undertaken  during  the  next  quarter.  A  project  completion  report  will  be \nprepared within 3 months of the physical completion of the Project.  \n \n42. \nThe Mission explained the ADB anticorruption policy, particularly the section on fraud and \ncorruption,  as  stated  in  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement  and  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants. Project accounts including accounts held for SDF, district imprest subaccounts, and \nthe  PIU  imprest  account  will  be  audited  annually  by  independent  auditors;  the  loan  allocation \nprovides financing for this activity. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n43. \nPerformance  monitoring  will  be  based  on  gender-segregated  collection  of  baseline  data \nunder  the  Project,  from  the  ongoing  household  survey,  the  education  management  information \nsystem  in  Sindh,  and  the  ongoing  district  education  baseline  monitoring  by  the  Multidonor \nSupport  Unit  established  under  SAP.13  The  baseline  data  include  individual  school  enrollment \ndata  by  class  and  gender  with  information  provided  on  pass  rates  by  class,  dropout,  and \n\n                                                 \n13 Federal Bureau of Statistics, Pakistan. 1999.

As each school joins the Project, these data will be routinely collected and provided \nto  the  district  and  province  for  monitoring.  The  household  survey  also  serves  as  a  form  of  third \nparty  monitoring  along  with  the  educational  management  information  system  established  under \nSAP.  Areas  for  monitoring  include  (i)  program  and  financial  compliance,  (ii) progress  and \nperformance  monitoring,  (iii)  benefit  evaluation,  and  (iv)  transition  monitoring  of  decentralization \nimpact  on  management  and  service  delivery.  The  Project  will  generate  this  information  at  the \ndistrict  level  in  Sindh.  The  ADB  Project  Performance  Management  System  (PPMS)  will  provide \nthe framework for project monitoring. \n \n44. \nTarget  performance  will  be  monitored  by  districts  (coordinated  by  the  PIU)  through \nenrollment growth, dropout, and completion rates at the end of class 5 and class 8. For SMCs, \nprogress  will  be  maintained  against  school  improvement  plans,  including  the  success  of  SDF-\nfinanced  activities.  Benefit  evaluation  will  be  measured  qualitatively  against  the  stated  goals  of \nimproving the number of class 6-8 enrollments, attendance, and delivery of programs, and from \nthis  the  cost  effectiveness  of  programs  can  be  determined.  In  addition,  the  performance-based \nmanagement  systems  at  the  provincial  and  lower  levels  will  be  based  on  management-  and \nbudget-related performance indicators. These will be defined with the help of local beneficiaries, \nand the indicators linked to budgets that are monitored regularly. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n45. \nGiven  the  labor  intensive  nature  of  decentralization,  institutional  reform,  and  capacity \nbuilding,  the  Project  approach  will  be  long  term,  and  monitoring  will  be  process  oriented  rather \nthan output oriented. Targets will be adjusted according to performance. Comprehensive reviews \nof  project  performance  will  be  conducted  at  the  end  of  the  second  and  fourth  year  of \nimplementation. The first review will focus on the success of the implementation procedures for \nSDF  funds  flow,  social  targeting,  and  survey  study  implementation  to  rationalize  elementary \nschool  facilities,  staffing,  and  funding.  The  second  review  will  focus  on  overall  benefits, \nfunds.  Financial \nachievements,  and  necessary  restructuring  and  reallocation  of  project \ncompliance monitoring will focus on agreed upon criteria and guidelines established by the PIU to \nensure  funds  flow  to  districts  and  SDF  accounts  so  that  transparency  is  maintained  and  audits \nare carried out annually. PIU and district office project staff will visit schools randomly to conduct \ncompliance  audits,  and  project  experts  will  build  in  compliance  standards  based  on  school \nattendance records versus lists of stipend holders and number of free textbooks distributed. \n \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\n \n46. \nSindh  wants  to  develop  economically  and  socially  by  reducing  poverty  and  raising  its \nhuman resource base so that rural areas can benefit from economic activity generated in Karachi, \nHyderabad, and Nawabshah. To accomplish this, Sindh must raise the province\u2019s education level \nfrom the class 1-5 primary school system to a class 1-8 elementary school system. The Project \nwill  support  all  existing  2,000  class  1-8  public  elementary  schools  and  provide  upgrading  from \nprimary  to  elementary  for  an  additional  1,400  selected  schools,  especially  in  rural  areas  (65% \nfemale) leading to a province-wide public elementary system that will eventually serve 55% of all \neligible  10-12  year  olds.  Consequently,  about  500,000  existing  class  6-8  public  school  students \nwill  benefit  from  the  project  along  with  an  additional  168,000  students  who  will  have  the \nopportunity to attend classes 6-8 for a total of 668,000 students enrolled annually in classes 6-8 \nby  2009.  In  addition,  the  Project  will  provide  faculties,  furniture,  equipment,  learning  materials, \nand  training  to  200,000  class  1-5  students  in  1,400  project  schools.  Under  the  program, \napproximately  1,000  schools  will  commence  preprimary  classes  for  approximately  30,000 \n\n\f 16 \n\npreschoolers (50% female). Selected madrasah schools will be provided teacher training in class \n6-8 core subjects. \n \n47. \nApproximately  5,000  new  teachers  (65%  female)  serving  in  elementary  schools  will \nbenefit  from  the  Project  through  academic  and  administrative  training.  About  4,000  education \nsupervisors  and  administrators  and  10,000  parents  and  community  leaders  will  benefit  from \ntraining  in  school-community  mobilization.  These  beneficiaries  will  provide  the  impetus  for \nstrengthening  and  expanding  the  elementary  school  system  in  Sindh,  especially  in  rural  areas. \nIndirect  beneficiaries  include  the  labor  required  to  upgrade  and  rehabilitate  schools  and  build \nfurniture, book distributors, employment for about 5,000 new teachers in rural areas over 9 years, \nlocal hiring of community workers in the area of life skills training, and preprimary education and \nteacher aides. Local NGOs and technical experts will also benefit by providing leadership training \nand  technology  transfer  in  rural  areas,  and  about  3,000  women  will  benefit  from  teaching \nscholarships  and  about  75,000  class  6-8  girls  will  receive  annual  stipends  through  school \nsubsidizes to reduce dropout and increase retention rates. \n \nThe Project will provide substantial beneficial impacts. It will enable Sindh to establish and \n48. \noperate province-wide pro-poor public class 1-8 elementary schools serving students in rural and \npoor  areas.  The  elementary  system  will  be  based  on  surveys  rationalizing  school  facilities, \nstaffing,  and  budgeting  of  approximately  3,400  elementary  schools.  The  impact  of  a  province-\nwide public elementary school system will raise the level of education in the province and reduce \nthe gap between the urban and rural, male and female enrollments.  It will also reduce the gap \nbetween  the  public  and  the  private  elementary  school  system  in  the  province.  The  Project  will \noffer parents and students a low-cost accessible system of public education in rural areas through \nclass 8. Class 8 is considered to be the minimum level of education needed to ensure sustainable \ncognitive  skills  and  knowledge  needed  in  a  modern  economy.  Social  externalities  include \npromotion  of  health  and  population  welfare  for  future  mothers,  good  citizenship,  and  efficient \nconsumerism required for effective social living. Furthermore, an elementary school system built \non community participation and decentralized decision making is likely to increase the demand for \neducation based on need and to stimulate social welfare in the form of participatory democracy \nand understanding of the importance of education for improving the quality of life (Appendix 11).  \n \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  on  the  education  system  is  expected  to  be  great.  First,  the \n49. \nProject supports the shift to decentralized management of educational services to the district level \nand  below,  where  management  and  budgeting  will  lead  to  operational  decisions  taken  close  to \nthe user. Decentralization brings together elected district officials and citizens to decide on school \npriorities  throughout  the  district.  Under  devolution,  educational  decision  making  and  data \ncollection  at  the  subdistrict  level  will  be  strengthened  through  additional  facilities,  staff,  and \nbudget resources to monitor individual school staff and SMCs. The Project will support activities \nthat allow local decisions to prioritize educational needs taken within schools and communities to \nfind  their  way  to  the  district  for  approval.  Efforts  to  involve  parents  through  SMCs  and \ncommunities  through  citizens'  boards  will  have  a  positive  impact  in  support  of  devolution. \nLikewise, the Project will enable the SDFs managed by SMCs to be strengthened and expanded \nto  cover  selected  school  improvement  activities  managed  by  parents  and  teachers  that  lead  to \ngreater accountability of the community in taking responsibility for the education of their children. \nFinally,  at  the  provincial  level,  the  project  impact  will  be  to  strengthen  the  role  of  the  province \nunder devolution to monitor inputs and outputs across districts in the province.  \n \nAt  the  school  level,  the  project  impact  will  help  to  ensure  that  quality  improvements  to \n50. \nelementary  education  are  based  on  need,  leading  to  improvements  in  school  attendance, \ncompletion  rates  and  dropout  reduction  throughout  classes  1-8.  The  introduction  of  preprimary \neducation  designed  around  socialization  skills  will  help  to  encourage  positive  attitudes  of \n\n\f  17\n\npreschoolers  once  they  enter  class  1,  which  will  lead  to  lower  dropout  and  improved  learning \nreadiness  among  first  graders.  The  Project  will  impact  school-community  relations  through \nmobilization  of  the  SMCs  linked  to  the  principals  and  to  the  school  supervisors  at  the  union \ncouncil and subdistrict education offices. This participatory approach has often been lacking and \nhas  been  partly  responsible  for  the  top-down  approach,  which  lacked  ownership  within  the \ncommunity.  The  innovative  attempts  to  strengthen  the  SDF  through  small  grants  rewarding \nschool  performance,  especially  through  student  and  teacher  attendance,  is  another  impact  that \nwill strengthen the quality of elementary education in Sindh.  \n \n51. \nGirls  are  underrepresented  in  elementary  education  for  economic  and  social  reasons. \nGirls  will  attend  school  if  classes  6-8  are  available  not  too  far  from  home.  This  is  the  major \nproblem preventing female enrollments from rising above 30%. Issues of opportunity costs, child \nlabor,  and  cultural  norms  dictating  little  education  for  females  will  always  be  a  problem,  but  the \nproject focus will be on getting the first 50% of girls into school. Recurrent costs for stipends and \nfree textbooks will be implemented for all class 6-8 females as a result of the Project. The Project \nwill prepare a gender strategy to mainstream girls elementary education in Sindh.  \n \n52. \nEthnic  minorities  such  as  Hindu,  Christian,  and  Sikh  are  small  in  number  but  may  be \ncongregated  in  some  districts  more  than  others.  In  some  cases,  local  language  sensitivity \nprevents  minorities  from  doing  well  in  school.  The  Government  has  a  policy  of  mainstreaming \nminorities and second language learners. In such cases, learning materials and training prepared \nunder the Project will be automatically provided in the Urdu and Sindi languages, and the PIU will \nrequest  technical  experts  to  offer  guidelines  to  district  officials  to  ensure  mainstreaming  of  all \nchildren into the formal education system. \n \n53. \nLikely  risks  in  implementing  the  Project  in  Sindh  Province  are  well  known  from  past \nprojects and from the many aid agency reports and government studies commissioned to make \nrecommendations.  However,  the  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  far  outweigh  the  costs  given \nthese risks (Appendix 12). \n \nA. \n\nFinancial Risk \n\nThe main financial risk is the potential inability of each district to sustain recurrent funds \n54. \nfor  the  salaries  of  new  teachers  to  be  deployed  in  project  schools  in  classes  6-8.  Federal, \nprovincial,  and  district  officers  negotiate  budgets  annually.  The  Project  provides  for  incremental \nrecurrent  costs  to  support  the  process  of  teacher  deployment  during  project  implementation. \nHowever,  recurrent  funds  for  teacher  salaries  made  after  project  completion  represent  a \ncontinuous  charge  to  the  provincial  finance  department.  World  Bank  and  ADB  program \nadjustment  credits  will  help  to  ensure  increased  social  sector  budgets  based  on  policies  to \nsupport education over the long term. The financial analysis of the province\u2019s education budget \nrevealed  that  the  recurrent  costs  under  the  Project  represent  a  small  increase  in  the  overall \nallocation for staffing when averaged over 6 years of project implementation and another 3 years \nafter project completion as project staff are fully utilized. Covenants are provided to ensure that \nadequate staff budgets for project schools are provided. The need for accurate financial data to \nbudget  the  public  elementary  school  system  requires  a  comprehensive  survey  that  looks  at  the \nfacilities, enrollments, staffing and budgeting of elementary schools. The survey to be carried out \nunder the Project will serve as the baseline and help to develop the enrollment projection system \nto  measure  progress.  Budgets  for  stipends  and  free  textbooks  for  classes  6-8  girls  will  be \nrequired after project completion, and assurances have been given that the policy of stipends and \nfree textbooks for girls will be expanded to classes 6-8. The Federal and provincial governments \nhave recently separated the auditor general and accountant general functions, which will help to \nensure  independent  audits,  especially  at  the  district  level  under  devolution.  Likewise,  under \n\n\f 18 \n\ntechnical  assistance,14  consistent  budget  classification  systems  have  been \n\nsector-wide \nintroduced throughout the country to again improve compliance and monitoring.  \n \nB. \n\nSocial Risk \n\n55. \nSocial targeting of the poor and females, especially in rural areas, may lead to abuse in \nallocating student stipends and teacher candidate scholarships by SMCs in some schools. SMC \ntraining by gender specialists in selection and monitoring procedures for these programs will be \ncritical  for  success.  It  is  widely  acknowledged  that  full  participation  leading  to  a  full  need \nassessment  will  improve  transparency,  and  this  is  why  extensive  training  of  SMC  members, \nteachers, and local school administrators is essential to ensure that project funds are effectively \nutilized. Consequently, the main social risk includes the potential weakness of SMCs to mobilize \nfemale  teachers  to  serve  in  the  communities.  Under  devolution,  teacher  appointment  and \ndeployment  have  been  localized,  and  the  Government  will  increase  the  budget  for  primary  and \nelementary  education.  The  Project  provides  for  scholarships  to  young  candidates  along  with \nadditional funds to hire teacher aides from the community to assist in classroom activities. \n \nC. \n\nPolicy Risk \n\n56. \nThe  main  policy  risk  under  the  Project  is  the  potential  inability  of  each  district  to  take \naction to fill gaps in the public elementary school system once recommendations from the project \nsurvey  are  known.  Covenants  have  been  included  to  ensure  that  action  is  taken  on  time  and \npolicy  analysts  provided.  School-community  mobilization  will  be  key  to  building  awareness  and \naccountability into the system. It is labor intensive and requires a strong commitment to draw on \ncontinuous  NGO/CBO  expertise  in  communities  and  to  build  awareness  and  capacity  among \nindividual  schools.  The  Project  provides  adequate  funds  for  capacity  building,  but  since  mostly \nonly  NGO  expertise  is  available  to  provide  many  of  the  activities,  it  is  critical  that  district  and \nprovincial governments recognize the importance of NGO participation to build capacity. \n \n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Sindh  Government  and  the  PED  have  given \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n57. \nthe following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n \n \n\nGeneral \n\n(i) \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nTo rationalize the efficiency of the elementary school system, the PED will ensure \nthat a survey of elementary school facilities, administration and teaching staff, and \nschool  budget  for  all  existing  and  new  schools  under  the  Project  is  carried  out \nwithin 2 years after loan effectiveness, and findings are reflected in the provincial \nand district plans to hire and finance adequate teachers a year later. \nIn the first year of implementation, the PED and EDOs will prepare an elementary \nschool  incentive  program  to  encourage  student  enrollment  and  prevent  dropouts. \nThe  incentive  program  will  include  a  formula  to  be  agreed  upon  with  and \nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB  to  support  needy  girls  in  each  elementary  school \nfor  5  years  (classes  6-10)  based  on  poverty  and  merit.  Funds  will  be  provided \ndirectly to the girls.  \nBased on the education monitoring and information system and other databases, a \ngender-segregated PPMS will be implemented in each district in the second year \n\n                                                 \n14 ADB. 2001.

The database will serve to measure the \nprogress  of  enrollments,  attendance,  and  dropout  and  pass  rates  for  all  the \nelementary  schools  in  Sindh.  The  PPMS  will  ultimately  determine  district  fiscal \ntransfers, incentives, and allocation formulas based on PPMS results. The results \nof the study survey will be used to develop the baseline. \nEach primary school that seeks upgrading to an elementary school will submit its \nplan to the district, to include pertinent information on school facilities, enrollments, \nstaffing, and the budget commitment of the SMC before EDO approval is granted. \nLife skills awareness programs for classes 6-8 will be developed and implemented \nin all class 6-8 classes within 2 years from loan effectiveness. \nPreprimary  school  programs  in  1,000  schools  (50%  girls'  schools)  will  be \ndeveloped  and  implemented  on  a  phased  basis  within  2  years  after  loan \neffectiveness. \nTraining of SMCs, master trainers, new school staff, and administrators will begin \nin a phased manner within 9 months of loan effectiveness. \nAll  project  activities  including  or  affecting  ethnic  minorities  will  take  into \nconsideration  local  language  preferences  of  the  ethnic  minorities  and  provide \nlearning materials developed under the Project as well as trainers and facilitators \naccordingly. \nFree  textbooks  for  girls  introduced  under  the  Project  to  classes  6-8  will  be \ncontinued after project closing through notification approved within 5 years of loan \neffectiveness.  \n\nStaffing \n\nThe EDOs will develop a policy for hiring teachers in existing and new elementary \nschools  based  on  local  recruitment  and  will  implement  it  within  2  years  of  loan \neffectiveness. The plan will include hiring of local teachers on a contract basis with \nopportunities  for  training,  and  teacher  assistants  and  preprimary  school  paid \nvolunteers on a temporary basis and paid through SDF. \nEDOs will ensure that all schools implementing preprimary classes identify teacher \npositions including paid community helpers before any decision is taken to provide \nfacilities and training. \n\nSelection of primary schools for upgrading to elementary schools will be based on \nselection criteria. The first batch of 250 schools will be identified within 2 months of \nloan  effectiveness,  the  second  batch  of  250  schools  within  1  year  of  loan \neffectiveness, and the remaining 500 schools within 2 years of loan effectiveness. \nElementary  schools  will  be  selected  for  preprimary  classes  based  on  selection \ncriteria, with 250 (25%) selected within 3 months of loan effectiveness. \nThe  selection  of  NGOs  to  undertake  school-community  mobilization  will  follow \nguidelines  developed  under  the  SAP  participatory  development  program  or \ngovernment procedures used under ADB projects. \nSpecial  measures  will  be  implemented  to  promote  the  participation  of  women  in \nproject  activities.  SMCs  will  include  at  least  one  female  parent  and  teacher,  a \ncounselor,  and  one  representative  from  a  CBO/NGO.  Student  stipends  and \nteacher  training  scholarships  will  be  provided  to  females;  textbooks  will  be \nprovided  to  all  class  6-8  female  students;  and  65%  of  new  elementary  school \nupgrading will be done in girls schools (Appendix 12). \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n(f) \n\n(g) \n\n(h) \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n \n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(iii) \n \n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n \n\nSelection \n\n\f 20 \n\n \n \n\n(e) \n\n(f) \n\n \n(iv) \n \n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\nSpecial  measures  will  be  taken  to  promote  the  participation  of  rural  schools  in \nproject  activities  based  on  the  poverty  level  of  each  district  to  ensure  that  poor \nschools are adequately represented in the Project.  \nNeedy  girls  in  classes  9-12  will  be  selected  by  schools  and  academic  tests \nadministered to determine 25% of the school\u2019s needy female enrollment based on \nmerit. Stipends will be administered to each girl until completion of class 10. In the \nfinal year of project implementation, the government will have in place a policy to \nprovide needy girls in classes 9-12 with stipends to encourage school attendance. \n\nFinance \n\nUnless  otherwise  agreed  upon,  loan  proceeds  will  be  transferred  from  the \nprovincial  imprest  account  to  district  imprest  subaccounts.  School  development \nfunds will be transferred from district imprest subaccounts as requested by SMCs. \nSDFs will be established in local banks near project schools, and funds from EDOs \nwill  be  transferred  to  these  project  schools  on  an  annual  basis  for  innovative \nprograms agreed upon with the districts and the PIU. \nA  student  stipend  program  will  be  established  for  disadvantaged  girls  in  existing \nand new classes 9-12 schools based on the Government's ongoing programs. \nThe award, distribution, and use of the SDFs and district imprest subaccounts will \nbe  monitored  in  accordance  with  the  agreed  upon  criteria  and  guidelines \nestablished  by  the  Project.  Benefit  monitoring  through  the  enrollment  projection \nprogram will measure project results against the project goals.  \nTimely  and  sufficient  provision  of  counterpart  funds  will  be  provided,  including \nallocation of funding for the first year's civil works. \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n58. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of ADB \nand  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  Special \nDrawing Rights 56,411,000 to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Decentralized Elementary \nEducation Project (Sindh) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate \nof  1%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  a  term  of  32  years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements presented to the Board. \n \n \n\nTadao Chino \nPresident \n \n\n29 August 2002  \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n 21\n\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK \n \n\nPerformance Indicators/ \nTargets \n\n \nMonitoring Mechanisms \n \n\n \nAssumptions and Risks \n\n \n\nDesign Summary \nI.

Reasons for the poor performance include the global economic \ndownturn,  political  developments  in  the  region  and  a  lack  of  management  capacity  needed  to \ncoordinate  change.  The  Government  of  Sindh  recognizes  that  a  strong  elementary  school \nsystem  serving  the  majority  of  students  is  essential  to  raise  the  prospects  for  economic \ndevelopment,  social  mobility,  education,  and  job  opportunities  to  reduce  poverty.  For  Sindh, \npublic provision of educational services is essential to ensure an important public good, ensure \nequity  across  all  the  districts  and  correct  market  failures  where  the  private  education  sector \nsiphons off those with ability to pay. Sindh Province is especially at risk of not employing basic \neducation  to  reduce  poverty  especially  outside  Karachi,  where  65%  of  the  30  million  Sindh \npopulation  reside  in  underserved  rural  areas.  Decentralization  of  public  services  is  viewed  as \none way to help ensure that decisions are taken closest to those who benefit from education\u2014\ndecisions that lead to long-term poverty reduction in communities (Figure A3.1). \n \n2. \nThe  Sindh  education  system  caters  to  6.0  million  children  aged  5-10  (primary)  and \nanother  2.0  million  aged  11-13  (middle)  for  a  total  cohort  of  8  million  elementary  school \nstudents. At present about 65% of the primary school age cohort attend school while 38% of the \nmiddle  school  age  group  are  enrolled.  There  is  a  small  but  high  quality  private  elementary \neducation  system  operating  in  urban  areas,  especially  in  Karachi,  that  serves  the  middle  and \nupper classes. The private system caters to the upper 50% of income families and charges fees \nthree to four times the amount charged to public school students. In contrast, the public school \nsystem is large but inefficiently organized and ineffectively operated. It serves rural areas where \nthe population of school-going children is poor and scattered. Given the cultural impediments of \nmeeting  the  needs  of  female  students  who  are  unable  to  travel  long  distances  from  home  to \nschool, girls\u2019 education is especially underserved by the public school system. According to the \nPakistan  Household  Survey,  between  1997  and  1999  the  Asian  Crisis  impacted  on  the  gap \nbetween  the  urban  and  rural  in  terms  of  elementary  school  participation  rates,  with  a  lesser \nproportion  of  children  from  the  lowest  income  households  going  to  school  as  compared  with \nprevious  years.  However,  while  boys  dropped  out  of  school  due  to  economic  hardship,  girls' \nenrollments actually grew. \n \n3. \nThe  result  of  this  two-tier  elementary  education  system  in  Sindh  is  a  private  sector \nschool  system  that  attracts  one  in  three  parents  who  can  afford  to  send  children  to  schools \npossessing  adequate  facilities,  staff  and  budgets.  The  public  school  system  caters  to  two  in \nthree parents from the bottom 50% of the household income and those living in rural areas. The \nschools often lack facilities, staff, and adequate budgets, and students still must pay fees that \ncan  amount  to  $30  each  year  for  books,  uniforms,  and  incidentals,  which  is  often  prohibitive. \nSindh wants to develop a rationalized system of elementary schools for classes1-8 throughout \nthe province that will serve both rural and urban areas and will complement the private sector \nsystem. Until a majority of the young are in school through class 8, exposure to new ideas and \nways of doing things will not take root (Table A3.1). \n \n4. \nBased on enrollment projections, the Provincial Education Department estimates that an \nadditional  250,000  students\u2014two  thirds  of  them  girls\u2014will  complete  class  5  in  the  coming  10 \nyears but will not be able to attend class 6 due to a shortage of available elementary schools in \nlocal communities. This number includes potential students who could be pulled into class 6 and \nbeyond through upgrading primary schools to elementary schools. Along similar lines, estimates \nsuggest that the internal efficiency of class 1-5 could be improved by 10% over the next 5 years \nto increase the number of class 5 public school leavers by 200,000, thereby contributing to the \n\n\f \n\n \n28 \n\n \nAppendix 3 \n\nnumber of class 6 enrollees. If Sindh is to increase its gross elementary school enrollments, it \nmust  act  to  increase  the  number  of  class  5  graduates  through  dropout  reduction  while \nsimultaneously increasing the availability of class 6-8 places, especially for girls in schools close \nto home.

First,  there  has  not  been  a \nconcerted  effort  to  map  school  enrollments,  school  locations  and  staff  deployment  throughout \nthe  province.  The  educational  management  information  system  developed  under  the  SAP \nlacked  the  sophistication  needed  to  collect  statistics  annually,  and  political  interference  from \nprovincial  politicians  affected  teacher  assignments,  which  was  not  picked  up  in  the  surveys. \nSecond,  teacher  deployment  was  not  accurately  reflected  in  data  collection  and,  more \nimportantly,  decisions  on  teacher  assignment  were  not  taken  at  the  local  level.  Consequently, \ncommunities had no control over teacher assignment or performance. Third, incentive systems \nfor both teachers and communities did not exist and so communities lacked the ability to reward \nteacher performance and encourage parents to send their children to school regularly.  \n \n6. \nRecognizing  these  failures,  the  Provincial  Education  Department  has  embarked  on  a \nprogram to map the existing 2,000 class 1-8 elementary schools to note location, coverage or \ncatchment  area,  enrollments,  and  staff  resources.  Planning  for  expansion  of  schools  with  full \nclasses  1-8  will  allow  unserved  communities  to  request  on  a  needs  basis  for  upgraded \nelementary  schools.  Efforts  are  under  way  to  strengthen  the  local  community  through  support \nfor existing School Management Committees to make them important stakeholders in ensuring \nthat schools function efficiently. The link between parents and community with local schools will \nbe  critical  to  effective  networking  of  elementary  schools  in  Sindh  and  will  help  ensure \ncommunity  involvement  to  take  decisions  based  on  need  to  improve  schools.  For  example, \nteacher  attendance  will  be  monitored  by  the  staff  management  committee  and  reported  to  the \nunion council. Further, deployment of new teachers will be made at the district and local levels \nand not at the provincial offices (Table A3.3). \n \n7. \nThe  Government  of  Sindh  views  poverty  reduction,  especially  among  the  rural \npopulation, as the key to boosting economic development outside of Karachi. Education plays \nan  important  role  to  create  the  social  capital  needed  by  the  poor  to  reach  their  maximum \npotential. Sindh's poverty framework includes physical asset creation including access to credit, \nsocial asset creation including education and nutrition, social safety nets and good governance \nincluding  devolution  of  power,  civil  service  reforms,  and  access  to  justice.  Education\u2019s  role  in \nreducing poverty stems from providing opportunities for social and job mobility. Until a majority \nof the young are exposed to new ideas through schooling, it is unlikely that the population will \nhave the skills and knowledge to escape poverty (Table A3.4). \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n \n\n29\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\nFigure A3.1: District Administration Organogram \n\nDistrict Administrative Structure\n\nChief Mayor \n\ng g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g \n\nDeputy Chief Mayor \n\nDistrict Auditor (Internal)\n\nDistrict Coordination Officer \n(Coordination, Finance, Planning, and Budget)\n\nDist.

With the exception of these urbanized and industrialized districts, all other districts have \nlow  economic  level  exhibiting  a  dismal  picture  of  economic  development  in  the  province.  The  least  developed  districts  include  Tharparkar,  Mirpurkhas,  Dadu, \nJacobabad/Khairpur, and Thatta. Largely due to accessibility problems (desert areas in arid zones), these districts do not appear to be well provided by the public sector with \nelectricity, gas, and telecommunications.

The public school system accommodates \n65%  of  these  children,  who  live  in  rural  areas  and  come  from  families  in  the  lowest  40%  of  income \ndistribution. The Project will expand the pro-poor public school system to increase the overall enrollments \nof 10-12 year-olds from 35% to 55%. The number of 10-12 year-olds affected will reach about one million. \nApproximately 60% of the beneficiaries will be rural poor and female. As such, the Project qualifies as a \npoverty intervention and as a gender in development project. \n \n \nC. \nStakeholder analysis prepared    \n \nA stakeholder analysis was prepared during the feasibility study under the Government\u2019s deliberation on \ndevolution  of  power  and  under  the  Social  Action  Program  (SAP).  School  management  committees \n(SMCs)  consist  of  parents  and  teachers  who  represent  the  major  stakeholders.  They  will  work  together \nwith school administrators under new devolution of social services procedures. \n \nParticipation strategy: \n \nSMCs established under the SAP will be trained to organize their activities and make recommendations \nto  citizen's  committees  in  union  councils  and  to  education  authorities  in  subdistrict  and  district  level \noffices.

The  Project  will  address  only  the  public  sector.  The  private  sector  elementary  school \nsystem  consists  of  about  1,500  schools,  18,000  teachers,  and  250,000  students.  The  schools \nare part of larger campuses of class 1-12 schools; 80% of their students come from the top two \neconomic  quintiles  based  on  household  surveys;  and  65%  live  in  metropolitan  Karachi.  The \naverage cost of class 6-8 education in these schools is $100 per year. By contrast, the public \nelementary school system contains 2,000 schools, 9,000 teachers, and 550,000 students. The \ntypical  school  is  small,  located  in  one  of  the  16  rural  districts,  and  caters  to  families  from  the \nbottom three economic quintiles (Table A12.1). The average cost of class 6-8 education in these \nschools is $30 per year. \n \n\nTable A12.1: Education Statistics for Sindh \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n \n\n   \n\n   \n\nMale \n\nMale \n\nBoth \n\nBoth \n\n59\n39\n53\n57\n62\n80\n\n80  \n60  \n78  \n82  \n83  \n90  \n\nUrban Areas \nFemale \n\n \n70  \n49  \n66  \n70  \n73  \n86  \n \n\n \n54  \n38  \n51  \n54  \n60  \n65  \n \n\nRural Areas \nFemale \n \n \n15  \n6  \n13  \n12  \n17  \n24  \n \n\n \n \nIncome Group \n \nA.

Stipend for girls \n\n  Cost \n$7 million \n\nImpact on Internal Efficiency \nThe  stipend  will  enable  girls  from  poor  families \nto  continue  to  classes  6-8,  thereby  increasing \nthe  percentage  of  girls  proceeding  to  middle \nschool  and  narrowing  the  gender  gap  between \nboys  and  girls.  At  present  about  65%  of  the \nprimary  school  age  cohort  attend  public \nschools\u201475% of the boys and 54% of the girls. \nIn middle school, only 38% of the class 6-8 age \ngroup  are  enrolled\u201448%  of  the  boys  and  28% \nof  the  girls.  The  stipend  program  expects  to \nincrease  the  proportion  of  girls  to  45%  over  6 \nyears (the duration of the Project). \n \nThis component will increase access for primary \nschool  graduates  to  elementary  classes  in  the \nsame school where they have attended primary \nschooling.  The  rehabilitation  will  ensure  better \nschool  facilities,  resulting  in  a  more  conducive \nlearning  environment  thereby  keeping  more \nstudents  in  school.  The  result  is  an  expected \ndecrease  in  dropout  rates  and  an  increase  in \nretention  rate  from  the  estimated  38%  to  about \n55% over the life of the Project. \n\n$50 million \n\nB.
