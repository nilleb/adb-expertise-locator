Through  the  first  Financial  Sector  Program 1                \n2001\u20132007  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  the  government  was  able  to  lay  the  legal \nand \nThe  government  also  took  strong  measures  to  consolidate  the  banking  system  and  introduce \nmore  stringent  requirements  for  capital  adequacy,  governance,  and  risk  management.  With \nsignificant results achieved from the first FSP, and to ensure the durability of its reform program \nand  inclusive  access  to  financial  services  by  ordinary  citizens,  the  government  requested \ncontinuing ADB support to the sector. This led to the design and approval of the FSP II in 2007.2 \nComprising a series of four single-tranche subprograms, the FSP II commenced in September \n20063 and will be completed in December 2010 at the conclusion of subprogram 4. The FSP II \nhas  helped  to  strengthen  resilience,  improve  public  confidence  and  financial  intermediation, \npromote good governance, and enhance efficiency in Cambodia's finance sector. \n \n\nfor  a  sound,  market-oriented \n\nfoundations  necessary \n\nfinance  sector.                        \n\n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nInclusive  economic  growth  for  poverty  reduction.  Cambodia\u2019s  real  gross  domestic \nproduct  grew  strongly  at  about  9.1%  per  year  on  average  from  1998  to  2008.  This  robust \neconomic  performance  was  led  by  the  private  sector,  particularly  in  garments,  tourist-related \nservices, construction, and agriculture, with a substantial proportion being financed from foreign \ndirect  investments  and  the  domestic  financial  system.  With  a  rapidly  growing  commercial \neconomy that requires a sound financial system to sustain its rate of growth, the government is \ncommitted  to  long-term  development  of  the  finance  sector,  channeling  financial  resources  to \nproductive  investments,  and  managing  the  inherent  risks  to  achieve  long-term  sustainable \neconomic growth and indirectly contribute to poverty reduction. The Asian financial crisis of the \nlate  1990s  and  the  global  financial  crisis  that  began  in  2008  devastated  many  economies  by \nwiping out several years of growth within a very short time. To promote sustainable economic \ngrowth,  reduce  poverty,  and  help  to  mitigate  shocks  emanating  from  external  financial  crises, \nADB plays an important role in supporting finance sector development in its developing member \ncountries, including Cambodia. \n                                                 \n 1   ADB. 2001.

The government\u2019s \ncommitment  to  developing  the  finance  sector  is  outlined  in  the  5-year  National  Strategy  and \nDevelopment  Plan  2006\u20132010  and \nThe  government\u2019s  vision  in  the  Financial  Sector  Development  Strategy  2006\u20132015  provides  a \nlong-term  strategy  and  a  delineated  framework  of  reforms.  In  line  with  the  priorities  and \nstrategies  identified  in  the  government\u2019s  National  Strategy  and  Development  Plan  and \nRectangular Strategy (phase 2), ADB\u2019s country strategy and program focuses on three strategic \npillars:  (i)  broad-based  economic  growth  through  investments  in  physical  infrastructure, \ndevelopment  of  the  finance  sector,  support  for  greater  regional  integration,  sustainable \ndevelopment  of  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises,  and  investments  in  agriculture  and \nirrigation; (ii) inclusive social development; and (iii) good governance.4 ADB\u2019s country strategy \nand  program  specifically  states  that  ADB  will  continue  its  leading  role  in  finance  sector \ndevelopment as it is one of the five core areas that best supports ADB's Strategy 20205 and its \ngoal to reduce poverty in Cambodia. \n \nPromoting  inclusive  finance  for  poverty  reduction.  ADB  has  supported  reforms  in \n5. \nCambodia's finance sector since 1999. The program loan cluster approach under the first FSP \nwas successful as it provided effective and flexible ways of converting complex policy objectives \ninto  implementable  policy  actions.  Following  on  from  the  first  FSP,  the  FSP  II  cluster  enabled \nthe government to continue strengthening the finance sector and to introduce a combination of \nlegal  and  regulatory  reforms,  target  capacity  building,  improve  disclosure  standards  and \nfinancial  transparency,  and  establish  key  financial  infrastructure,  including  the  payments  and \nsettlement system. Finance sector development helps to reduce poverty by lowering transaction \ncosts of economic activities and extending the outreach of the formal finance sector to the poor \nand  to  rural  microenterprises.  While  an  efficient  financial  system  promotes  private  sector \ndevelopment and foreign direct investment, a robust finance sector protects the economy from \nunfavorable  exogenous  shocks,  which  are  becoming  more  common  in  increasingly  global \nfinancial markets, thus reducing the likelihood of falling into poverty again.     \n \nB. \n \nThe  overall  impact  of  the  FSP  II  is  a  sound,  market-based  finance  sector  to  enhance \n6. \nresource  mobilization  and  support  sustainable  economic  growth.  The  expected  outcome  is  a \ngrowing,  resilient,  and  efficient  financial  system. The  design  and  monitoring  framework  for  the \nprogram is in Appendix 1; a list of linked documents is in Appendix 2. The development policy \nletter  for  the  FSP  II  cluster  is  in  Appendix  3.  The  policy  actions  for  subprogram  4  and            \nmedium-term  program  with  a  post-program  partnership  framework  are  in  Appendix  4.                   \nWith changing domestic circumstances and developmental priorities, the government requested \nminor  modifications  to  two  of  the  triggers.  These  were  endorsed  by  ADB  management              \n(footnote 1 in Appendix 4).  \n \nC. \n \nContinuing the reforms initiated under subprograms 1, 2, and 3, subprogram 4 has nine \n7. \nkey reform actions (triggers) that the government began implementing in January 2010. All have \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2005. Cambodia: Country Strategy and Program, 2005\u20132009. Manila. \n5   ADB.  2008.

At  the  conclusion  of \nsubprogram 4, the following outputs will have been accomplished under the FSP II cluster: \n \n  \n\nImproved Confidence and Financial Intermediation \n \n\n1. \n\nModernized  payments,  clearance,  and  settlement  system.  The  process \n\n8. \nfor \nmodernizing the national payments, clearance, and settlement system (PCSS) started in 2006 \nwhen  the  National  Bank  of  Cambodia  (NBC)  established  the  Payments  Policy  Unit  (PPU).     \nWith technical assistance (TA) from ADB, the NBC developed a road map for modernizing the \nnational  PCSS  and,  under  subprogram  1,  signed  a  memorandum  of  understanding  with  each \ncommercial  bank  endorsing  the  road  map.  Key  actions  of  phase  I  of  the  road  map  were \nimplemented  by  the  NBC  under  subprogram  2  in  2008.  These  included  the  issuance  of  a  \nprakas  6  on  check  standardization  and  the  launch  of  an  interbank  switch  between  four  banks \n(since increased to five banks). With a long-term payment expert funded by ADB, the road map \nto modernize the PCSS was updated and adopted under subprogram 3. In addition, an interim \nsoftware  solution  for  check  clearance  was developed  by  the  NBC  Information  Technology \nDivision and launched in May 2009, together with a set of rules and procedures to regulate the \nclearance and settlement of checks. \n \n9. \nUnder subprogram 4, the PPU has worked closely with commercial banks to improve the \nefficiency  of  check  clearance  and  settlement,  resolve  issues  relating  to  retail  mobile  phone \npayments, and identify practical solutions to enhance funds transfer and faster bank settlement. \nTo  enhance  funds  transfer  and  early  settlement,  the  PPU  has  developed  a  credit  remittance \npayment  instrument  to  be  used  as  (i)  a  direct  funds  transfer  instrument;  (ii)  a  direct  credit \ninstrument;  and  (iii)  a  direct  debit  instrument  for  government  salary  payment,  utility  payments, \nand settlement between banks. The credit remittance payment instrument has been discussed \nwidely  with  the  Association  of  Bankers  in  Cambodia  (ABC)  and  issued  by  the  NBC  in  August \n2010,  together  with  an  accompanied  prakas.  The  NBC  has  obtained  funds  ($3.6  million)  from \nthe Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) under the FSP II grant to finance the upgrading of \nthe  interim  software  solution  to  a  centralized  full-solution  software  system  for  clearance  and \nsettlement of checks. The PPU has prepared the bid documents in close consultation with ADB, \nand  the  procurement  process  began  in  July  2010  with  the  publication  of  invitation  for  bids.        \nTwo  commercial  banks  have  introduced  funds  transfer  to  rural  areas  using  mobile  phones.       \nTo regulate and protect all parties, a prakas on third-party processor was issued by the NBC in \nAugust 2010.  \n \nConsumer  access  to  credit  and  market  confidence  enhanced.  The  orderly \n10. \ndevelopment  and  expansion  of  the  financial  market  requires  knowledgeable  customers  and \ncompetent providers of financial services. Since 2005, all banks have been required to publish \ntheir  audited  financial  statements  to enable  the  public  to  make  informed  judgments  regarding \nwhere to place their deposits and with which banks to transact. The FSP II supported the NBC \nin its efforts to promote bank transparency by requiring all audited financial statements of banks \nas well as new prudential regulations to be published on the NBC website. This was achieved in \n2008  and  several  banks  have  since  published  these  annual  audited  financial  reports  on  their \nown websites. \n \n11.  With close cooperation between the NBC and the ABC, a pilot online credit information \nsharing system (CIS), using negative data, was established in August 2006 under the Small and \n\n                                                 \n6 Khmer term for regulations or instructions issued by the NBC governor or a government minister. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fMedium  Enterprise  Development  Program. 7  A  number  of  actions  were  taken  up  through  the \nSmall and Medium Enterprise Development Program to the end of 2007 to improve the software \nsystem.  At  the  conclusion  of  the  program  in  2007,  the  FSP  II  helped  familiarize  stakeholders \nwith the system and addressed necessary changes to the CIS and its management structure to \nenhance  effectiveness.  During  subprogram  2,  the  NBC  continued  to  help resolve  systematic \nissues related  to  the CIS  software  and  added  microfinance  institutions  (MFIs)  to  the  negative \nCIS  system  during  subprogram  3.  Plans  to  upgrade  the  software  system  to  include  other \nsources  of  credit  data  covering  both  banks  and  MFIs,  and  the  possibility  of  corporatizing  the \nCIS, was expected to come on stream during subprogram 4. At the beginning of 2010, the ABC \nand the Cambodian MFI association formed a joint venture with an international service provider \nto  establish  a  credit  bureau  fully  owned  by  the  private  sector.  The  NBC  retains  the  regulatory \nrole to ensure the cost of services is affordable and to maintain the confidentiality of the shared \ninformation. \n\n \n\n12. \nInterbank  market  and  tradable  government  securities  developed.  The  Law  on \nGovernment  Securities  was enacted  in  January  2007  to  provide  a  framework  for  the  efficient \nissuance and management of government securities. Under subprogram 2, the NBC was able \nto  establish  a  registry  system  and  train  staff  in  the  functions  and  operation  of  the  registry.    \nWhen  subprogram  3  came  on  stream,  the  development  of  a  short-term  money  market  was  a \npriority and, to provide liquidity support, the NBC introduced regulations covering an  interbank \nrepurchase  master  agreement  for  secured  interbank  transactions  in  the  money  market  in \nOctober  2009.  With  the  advent  of  subprogram  4,  the  NBC  went  further  and  formulated \nregulations that were issued as a prakas in October 2010 to allow the use of NBC certificates of \ndeposit  as  collateral  for  interbank  transactions.  Though  the  framework  is  in  place,  banks  are \nexperiencing high liquidity and are not likely to utilize this facility in 2010. \n\n \n\n13. \nOutreach  in  the  formal  sector  promoted.  Banking  activities  in  rural  areas  are \nimproving,  with  MFIs  providing  most  of  the  formal  financial  services.  The  formal  microfinance \nindustry  is  growing  rapidly,  with  credit  growing  from  $92.2  million  at  the  end  of  2006  to               \n$339.6  million  at  the  end  of  June  2010.  Rapid  expansion  of  credit  has  put  pressure  on  the \nsources  of  funding  for  MFIs,  as  most  of  their  capital  and  debts  are  generated  from  overseas \nsources. A review by the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor identified that the development \nof deposit services by MFIs has lagged behind credit services. These issues, such as making \ndomestic finance more  widely accessible to MFIs, are being addressed by the  NBC under the \nFSP  II.  As  a  first  step,  the  NBC  introduced  a  regulation  covering  the  minimum  financial, \ninstitutional, and managerial requirements for MFIs wishing to collect and intermediate voluntary \npublic  deposits  under  subprogram  3.  The  regulation  has,  among  other  things,  increased  the \nminimum  capital  requirement  from  $62,000  to  $2.5  million.  Four  qualified  MFIs  were  granted \nlicenses  during  subprogram  4  and  three  applications  are  being  processed.  Since  early  2009,  \nthe  NBC  has  encouraged  individual  commercial  banks  to  lend  directly  to  MFIs,  and  in  June \n2010 the NBC reported that seven banks were providing credit to MFIs\u2014two in local currency \nand the other five in US dollars.  \n \n\n2. \n\nMaintained Stability in the Finance Sector \n\n \n\n \n14. \nUpdated  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  banks. As part of efforts to strengthen \nprudential  supervision,  update  regulations,  and  ensure  stability,  the  NBC  issued  regulations           \n\n                                                 \n7  ADB.  2004.

The  NBC  also  issued \nregulations on (i) fit and proper tests on bank management; (ii) corporate governance for banks \nand  financial  institutions,  and  (iii)  updated  asset  classification  and  provisioning  for  banks  and \nfinancial institutions. Further, the NBC undertook a comprehensive review of the 1999 Law on \nBanking and Financial Institutions (LBFI) to address the features of a changing domestic market \nand  the  reality  of  increasing  international  economic  integration.  The  review  benefited  from  TA \nprovided  by  ADB  (footnote  2)  and  took  into  consideration  consumer  protection,  bank  secrecy \nprovisions  to  support  development  of  the  CIS,  procedures  for  administering  distressed  and \ninsolvent banks, and protection or immunity of bank regulators. A revised and updated LBFI was \nsubmitted to the Council of Ministers (COM) in October 2009 with the expectation that it would \nbe submitted to the National Assembly during subprogram 4. Discussions at the COM began in \nFebruary 2010 before the International Monetary Fund and World Bank 2010 Financial Sector \nAssessment  Program  began.  With  additional  suggestions  emanating  from  the  2010  Financial \nSector  Assessment  Program,  the  NBC  decided  to  withdraw  the  revised  LBFI  to  incorporate \nthose  comments  and  also  revise  the  law  on  conduct  and  organization  of  the  NBC.  Both  the \nrevised laws will be submitted to the COM in 2011.  \n \n15. \nStrengthened  bank  supervision  capacity  and  measures  adopted  to  sustain \nfinancial  stability.  Updating  and  upgrading  skills  is  a  priority  area  that  must  be  an  ongoing \nfeature  of  any  program  aimed  at  developing  and  deepening  the  financial  system.  With  TA \nof $1.7 million (footnote 2) that was approved together with the FSP II, ADB has been providing \ntechnical support to upgrade the capacity of NBC's supervision staff and strengthen the NBC\u2019s \nsurveillance  capability.  While  ADB  supports  the  bank  on-site  supervision  aspect,  the \nInternational Monetary Fund provides a resident adviser to develop the off-site capability of the \nNBC. As an indication of the importance that ADB places on the NBC\u2019s work in this area, ADB \napproved  TA  together  with  subprogram  2  in  2008  that  provided  on-the-job  guidance  to  bank    \non-site supervision teams.8 The TA culminated in a detailed review of the six largest commercial \nbanks  during  subprogram  3,  and  the  results  of  the  on-site  inspections  proved  very  useful  in \nrecent  analysis  of the  impact  of  the  global  economic  crisis  on  Cambodia\u2019s  banking  system.   \nADB also approved TA in 2009 to help the government implement the triggers for subprogram 4 \nand  as  part  of  its  continuing  capacity  support  to  the  NBC. 9   The  NBC  has  also  introduced \nremedial measures broadly anchored on the FSP II program policy framework, which the NBC \nis closely monitoring, and has put in place stronger sanctions to address potential vulnerabilities \nin the banking system.  \n\n \n\nPrudential supervision and regulations for microfinance institutions strengthened. \n16. \nThe NBC has made significant progress in building the regulatory framework for licensing and \nsupervising  registered  MFIs.  A  division  for  prudential  supervision  of  MFIs  within  the  Banking \nSupervision Department has been established and several prudential regulations in the form of \nprakas have been issued, such as that to amend the prakas on the licensing of MFIs, and those \ncovering  MFIs  that  can  mobilize  voluntary  savings  (2007)  and  the  management  of  foreign \nexchange risks (2008). During the implementation of the FSP II and under ADB TA, staff have \nbeen trained in the implementation of these regulations, and in off-site and on-site supervision \ntechniques (footnotes 2, 8, and 9). With the growing number and size of activities generated by \n\n                                                 \n8   Technical  Assistance  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  Implementation  of  Key  Policy  Triggers  of  Subprogram  3 \n(TA 7185-CAM) attached to ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on \na  Proposed  Loan  for  Subprogram  2  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  the  Financial  Sector  Program  II  Cluster. \nManila (Loan 2479-CAM). \n\n9    ADB.  2009.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  Implementation  of  Subprogram  4  of  the \n\nFinancial Sector Program II. Manila (TA 7472-CAM). \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f \nLegal  foundation  to  support  financial  and  commercial  transactions  enhanced.    \n\nregistered  money  changers,  the  NBC  issued  a  code  of  conduct  for  implementation  during \nsubprogram  4.  The  NBC  has  conducted  a  series  of  workshops  to  explain  the  purpose  of  the \ncode  and  the  roles  and  obligations  of  each  money  changer.  Since  then,  14  large  money \nchangers  have  been  licensed  and  25  have  notified  the  NBC  of  their  affiliation  with  licensed \ncommercial banks.  \n \n17. \nFor  financial  transactions  to  develop  beyond  basic,  short-term,  and  mainly  cash-based \ntransactions,  a  legal  framework  for  commerce  and  finance  must  be  developed,  updated,  and \nimplemented.  This  was  one  of  the  achievements  of  the  FSP  II  when  the  government  adopted \nthe  Law  on  Government and  Private  Sector  Securities in  2007.  For  laws  that  were  recently \nenacted,  the  adoption  of  implementing  subdecrees  was  required.  The  enactment  of  new  laws \nhas been followed by the development of training curricula at certain legal faculties to train legal \npractitioners  and  judges  in  these  new  principles.  ADB  provided  technical  support  (footnote  2) \nto help  the  Ministry  of  Commerce  (MOC) draft  a  new  law  on  commercial  contracts  with \nprovisions  relating  to  agencies  and  franchising.  The  draft  law  was  submitted  to  the  COM  in \nOctober 2009 and to the National Assembly during subprogram 4.  \n \n\n3. \n\nPromoted Good Governance \n \n\nInternational initiatives on anti-money laundering and combating the financing of \n18. \nterrorism  promoted.  Recent  moves  to  implement  anti-money  laundering  and  combat  the \nfinancing  of  terrorism  in  Cambodia  are  directly  in  line  with  international  deterrence  efforts  and \nstandard  governance  principles  to  help  build  market  confidence.  The  government  enacted  the \nLaw  on  Combating  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism  in  2007  under \nsubprogram  1.  This  was  followed  by  the  adoption  of  prakas  covering  the  appointment  of  the \nboard  of  directors,  the  secretary  general  to  head  the  Cambodian  Financial  Intelligence  Unit \n(CAFIU), and the authority to establish the CAFIU during subprogram 2, followed by the formal \nestablishment  of  the  CAFIU  during  subprogram  3.  ADB,  the  Asia  Pacific  Group  on  Money \nLaundering,  the  Australian  Transaction  Reports  and  Analysis  Centre,  the  Bank  Negara \nMalaysia,  and  the  World  Bank  provided  TA  that  helped  the  CAFIU  prepare  the  following \nregulations: (i) internal rules and code of conduct for the CAFIU; (ii) CAFIU\u2019s business plan for \n2010\u20132012;  (iii) a  strategy  and  implementation  plan  for  initiatives  on  combating  money \nlaundering and the financing of terrorism; and (iv) a subdecree on combating money laundering \nand the financing of terrorism, covering all other reporting entities not regulated by the NBC. All \nthese  regulations  have  been  adopted  by  the  CAFIU  board  of  directors  during  subprogram  4. \nThe  CAFIU  reported  that,  of  the  69  suspicious  transactions  reported  in  2010,  two  have  been \npassed on to the police for prosecution. \n\n \n\nCorporate  governance  and  transparency  in  the  insurance  industry  enhanced.      \n\n19. \nTo  build  consumer  confidence  in  insurance  as  a  service,  the  public  must  first  understand  the \ninsurance business and the services it can provide. The goal for all participants in the industry is \nto  raise  their  operations  to  international  standards.  Under  subprogram  1,  the  MEF  issued \nregulations  on  premium  rates  for  fire  insurance,  and  licensing  of  general  and  life  insurance \ncompanies.  The  MEF  also  issued  prakas  covering  corporate  governance  and  solvency  for \ninsurance  companies  in  early  2008.  A  prakas  on  accounting  guidelines  for  general  insurance \nwas adopted under subprogram 2 and, with technical support from ADB (footnote 8), the MEF \nworked  closely  with \nthe  smooth \nimplementation of the reporting standards. The MEF also revised the insurance law which was \nsubmitted  to  the  COM  during  subprogram  3.  During  subprogram  4,  the  MEF  required  all \ninsurance companies to publish their audited financial statements. \n\ninsurance  companies \n\nthe  association  of \n\nto  ensure \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f \n20. \nCommercial  dispute  resolution  mechanism  established.  To  promote  good \ngovernance in the financial system, the government enacted the law on commercial arbitration \nin 2006. After the COM adopted the subdecree in 2009, a national arbitration center (NAC) was \nestablished. ADB TA (footnote 2) helped the MOC select the 54 founding members, formulate \nthe rules and administrative procedures, prepare a code of conduct for the NAC, and train those \nselected  in  June\u2013July  2010.  There  is  no  specific  legal  requirement  for  arbitrators  to  sit  a \nqualifying examination, and the MOC is awaiting a directive from the prime minister requiring all \ncommercial arbitrators to sit the qualifying examination. That would give credibility to the NAC \nand help ensure its future successful operations.  \n \n21. \nAccounting institutions and professional capacity of members strengthened.  In a \nmove  to  strengthen  and  increase  accounting  and  auditing  capacity  and  standards,  the  MEF \nintroduced  a government-funded scholarship scheme to enable 70 recipients annually to study \ntoward  becoming  members  of  the  Kampuchea  Institute  of  Certified  Public  Accountants  and \nAuditors. These scholarships were initially awarded only to government civil servants but poor \nperformance  and  a  high  dropout  rate  in  the  initial  phase  prompted  ADB  to  persuade  the \ngovernment to open the scholarships to the public in the second half of 2006. Selection was to \nbe  strictly  on  merit.  The  MEF  reviewed  the  performance  of  the  certified  public  accountant \nscholarship program in 2009 and noted that, of the 598 scholarships awarded, only 6 scholars \nhad completed the 3.5 years course of study, 376 were continuing, and 216 had dropped out; \n10  students  are  expected  to  successfully  complete  the  course  in  2010.  Two  units  have  been \nidentified  as  the  stumbling  blocks  for  most  students:  United  Kingdom  Corporate  and  Business \nLaw  and  United  Kingdom  Taxation  Law.  The  MEF  has  proposed  to  revise  both  units  so  that \nlocal laws will be used instead. During subprogram 4, the  MEF introduced 35 scholarships for \nthe 2-year certified accounting technician program. \n\nEnhanced Efficiency in the Finance Sector  \n\n \n4. \n \n22. \nKey  operating  functions  of  the  National  Bank  of  Cambodia  computerized  and \nintegrated.  The  FSP  II  supported  the  NBC's  efforts  to  implement  an  integrated  system  that \nlinked the accounting department to the cash management functions in the issues department, \nthe  customer  account  management  in  the  banking  operations  department,  and  the  foreign \nexchange  transactions  in  the  exchange  management  department.  Under  subprogram  1,          \nthe  NBC  adopted  the  information  technology  architecture  model  for  a  total  estimated  cost  of        \n$4.0  million.  The  MEF  allocated  a  $4.0  million  grant  to  the  NBC  to  finance  the  new  system, \nincluding the required hardware, and ADB TA (footnote 2) provided two international consultants \nto  assist  the  NBC  in  procuring,  designing,  and  installing  the  system.  Under  subprogram  2,       \nthe  NBC  acquired  the  software  and  hardware  using  international  bidding.  Installation  of  the \nhardware  began  during  subprogram  3.  In  July  2009,  the  final  testing  of  the  hardware  was \ncompleted and the operating system, Oracle software, and database were installed. Following \nthe  completion  of  product  walk-through  and  functional  training  the  system  went  live  in      \nFebruary  2010.  The  same  system  has  been  successfully  rolled  out  to  eight  NBC  branches \nduring subprogram 4, and implementation of the branch roll-out plan will continue to early 2011.  \n\n \nCapacity  of  microfinance  institution  staff  upgraded. Finding adequately trained and \n\n23. \nskilled  people  to  meet  the  needs  of  a  growing  microfinance  industry  is  an  ongoing  challenge.   \nTo that end, the FSP II included TA that has helped upgrade the curriculum for the Center for \nBanking  Studies,  added  two  specialized  training  curricula  for  MFIs,  and  updated  a  course  on \nmoney  and  banking.  All  three  courses  were  offered  in  the  first  semester  of  2010,  with  150 \nstudents enrolled for each course.   \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fthe  country  program  and  strategy  period.                  \n\nfinancing \n\nrequirement  during \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n \nD. \n \n24. \nThe  Government  of  Cambodia  has  requested  a  loan  of  $10  million  equivalent  and  a \ngrant  of  $5  million,  both  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  to  help  finance  subprogram  4.  \nThe loan will have a 24-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% \nper annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft financing agreement. \n \nThe  loan  amount  for  subprogram  4  is  based on  a  number  of  factors10 that  support  the \n25. \nimplementation  of  reforms  under  the  FSP  II.  These  include  the  importance  attached  to  the \nreform  program  by  the  government,  direct  administrative  and  adjustment  costs  involved  in \ndesign  and  implementation  of  specific  reforms,  Cambodia\u2019s  progress  toward  achieving  the \ntargets established in the results framework for the program cluster, and the need to conform to \nthe  overall \nThe estimated long-term benefits of the program would far exceed the loan amount.  ADB staff \nestimate11 that the total long term static benefits of the cluster program would be in the vicinity \nof  $350.9  million  or  3.6%  of  gross  domestic  product,  highlighting  the  importance  of  finance \nsector  reforms  to  the  economy.  The  policy  adjustment  costs  to  the  Government,  statutory \nagencies,  banks  and  financial  institutions  are  conservatively  estimated  at  $53.0  million \n(compared  to  $45.3  million  equivalent  for  FSP  II  of  which  $15  million  is  for  subprogram  4). \nThese include the investment, administrative, enforcement and fiscal costs to the Government \nin  implementing  and  enforcing  the  reforms  (estimated  at  a  minimum  of  $30.5  million).    The \npolicy  adjustment  costs  also  include  the  investment,  administrative,  and  increased  business \ncosts  borne  by  banks  and  financial  institutions  for  complying  with  the  reforms  (estimated  at  a \nminimum  of  $22.5  million).  The  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  a  single  tranche  upon  satisfactory \ncompletion  of  all  tranche  conditions  and  following  loan  effectiveness.  The  proceeds  of  the \nprogram  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB's  Simplification  of \nDisbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans.  12 Subprogram 4 will \nprovide retroactive financing for eligible expenditures incurred up to 180 days prior to loan and \ngrant effectiveness. ADB will retain the right to audit the use of the loan and grant proceeds and \nto verify the accuracy of withdrawal application certification. \n \nE. \n \n26. \nThe NBC will be the executing agency, and the MEF and MOC will be the implementing \nagencies  for  subprogram  4.  The  finance  sector  steering  committee  will  continue  to  coordinate \nprogram  implementation  among  government  ministries,  agencies,  and  development  partners. \nTo  ensure  timely  program  implementation,  the  committee,  comprising  senior  officers  from  the \nMEF,  MOC,  and  NBC,  will  meet  as  required  to  review  progress  reports  from  the  technical \nworking group, consider pending issues, and propose concrete actions to resolve those issues. \nA  senior  NBC  officer  has  been  appointed  as  program  director  to  assist  the  MEF,  MOC,  and \nNBC  in  coordinating  the  day-to-day  program  and  post-program  partnership  framework \nimplementation.  The  program  director  will  be  required  to  submit  to  ADB  quarterly  progress \nreports  on  subprogram  4  and  post-program  partnership  framework  implementation  and  a \nprogram completion report within 6 months after the closing date of the loan. \n \n \n                                                \n \n10   ADB. 2010.

Subprogram  4  includes  measures  to  (i)  improve  the  management  information \nsystem and reporting standards within the NBC, banks, insurance firms, and MFIs; (ii) promote \ntransparency of information released by banks, MFIs, and insurance firms; (iii) establish a credit \nbureau;  (iv)  support  implementation  of  anti-money-laundering  regulations;  and  (v)  deter \nactivities that could support the financing of terrorism. Satisfactory progress has been noted in \nrevenue collections, with greater use of the banking system to streamline revenue collection and \npayments processes. \n \n29. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, the government will institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and \ncontrols following international best practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption \nor  money  laundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism,  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain \nfrom engaging in such activities. \n \nC. \n\nPoverty, Social, Gender, and Environmental Safeguards \n\n30. \nSubprogram  4  of  the  FSP  II  will  not  entail  any  involuntary  resettlement  or  have  a \nnegative  impact  on  indigenous  people  or  the  environment.  It  is  classified  category  C  for \ninvoluntary  resettlement,  impact  on  indigenous  people,  and  impact  on  the  environment. \nSubprogram 4 of the FSP II is a general intervention aimed at supporting sustainable economic \ngrowth.  In  that  respect,  it  is  expected  to  have  an  indirect  positive  effect  on  poverty  reduction. \nWhile the implementation of reform measures have been gender neutral, the NBC reported that \n\n                                                 \n13  Contribution to the ADB Results Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14   ADB.  2008.

These minor changes as endorsed by Management in July 2010, are within the medium-term program framework and would not have any adverse \nimplication on the program.  \nOriginal trigger/milestone \n\n      Reasons for the proposed change \n\nRevised trigger/milestone \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nv. NBC to arrange for submission \nof the revised Law on Banking \nand Financial Institutions to the \nNational Assembly, and prepare \nrelevant implementing \nregulations \n\nvi. NBC to update prudential \nregulations for banks to reflect \nlegal changes and developments \nin international banking \nstandards and good practices \n\nviii. NBC to conduct workshops to \nenhance implementation of the \ncode of conduct by money \nchangers \n \n \n\nNBC to prepare revisions to the Law on \nBanking and Financial Institutions (LBFI) \nand the Law on the Conduct and \nOrganization of the National Bank of \nCambodia (LCONBC) to address relevant \nissues raised by the 2010 FSAP  \n \n\nNBC to update prudential regulations for \nbanks to enhance international banking \nstandards and good practices   \n\nNBC to enhance implementation of the \nregulations for money changers by (i) \nrequiring licensing, (ii) imposing \nreporting requirements, and (iii) applying \nthe code of conduct  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRevised provisions to amend the LBFI were submitted to the Council of \nMinisters (CoM) in October 2009. Discussions at the CoM commenced in early \n2010 but with additional suggestions coming out of the 2010 draft FSAP, NBC \ndecided to withdraw the draft revisions to the LBFI to incorporate relevant \nsuggestions from the FSAP to both the LBFI and LCONBC and will re-submit to \nthe CoM in 2011.  \n\nSince the revisions to the LBFI are not expected to be submitted to the National \nAssembly in 2010, the requirement to update regulations to reflect legal \nchanges has been removed. The trigger now focuses on updating prudential \nregulations to enhance banking standards and good practices. Three related \nregulations have been developed. \n \n\nNow changed from a milestone to a trigger. The trigger has been re-worded to \ncapture the activities that are being pursued by NBC to ensure that medium-to-\nlarge money-changers are properly licensed and regulated.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n4\n\n \n \n \n \n \n2\n5\n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 4 November 2010) \n \n", "Currency Unit \nKR1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "riel/s (KR) \n$0.00024  \nKR4,170 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ABC \nADB \nCAFIU \nCIS \nCOM \nFSP \nLBFI \nMEF \nMFI \nMOC \nNAC \nNBC \nPCSS \nPPU \nTA \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Association of Bankers in Cambodia \nAsian Development Bank \nCambodian Financial Intelligence Unit \ncredit information sharing system \nCouncil of Ministers \nFinancial Sector Program \nLaw on Banking and Financial Institutions \nMinistry of Economy and Finance \nmicrofinance institution \nMinistry of Commerce \nnational arbitration center \nNational Bank of Cambodia \npayments, clearance, and settlement system \nPayments Policy Unit \ntechnical assistance \n", "NOTES \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", "(i) \n(ii) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the government and its agencies ends on 31 December. \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", " \nVice-President \nDirector General \nDirector \n", " \nTeam leader \n", "Team members \n \n", " \nPeer reviewer \n", " \n", "C.
