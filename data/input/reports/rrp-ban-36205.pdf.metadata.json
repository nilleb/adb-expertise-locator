The  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  for  the \nProgram was undertaken and the summary is in a core appendix. \n \n \n \nThe  Country  Strategy  for  Bangladesh  of  the  Asian  Development \nBank (ADB) aims to reduce poverty, by among others, promoting \nfaster  private  sector-led  economic  growth  by  accelerating  the \npace  of  structured  reforms  and  providing  assistance \nfor \nimprovement in infrastructure. The Sector Development Program \nsupports  the  Government\u2019s  ongoing  Power  Sector  Reforms  in \nBangladesh  (PSRB)  adopted  in  1994  to  (i) improve governance, \n(ii) build long-term institutional capacity, (iii) improve efficiency and \nfinancial  viability,  and  (iv) facilitate  private  sector  participation. \nSince  1994,  the  Government  has,  with  the  support  of  ADB  and \nother  development  partners,  carried  out  the  following  major \nactions under its reform program: \n\u2022 \n\u2022  creation  of  five  new  companies  in  generation,  transmission, \n\nintroduction of private sector participation in generation; \n\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\nand distribution; \nrestructuring of the distribution areas; \nreduction  of  system  losses  by  computerized  billing  and \nimproved collection management; and \n\n\u2022  Parliament\u2019s  passage  of  the  new  Energy  Act  2003  as  a \nfoundation  for  the  establishment  of  an  Energy  Regulatory \nCommission (ERC). \n\nto \n\nThis  phase  of  the  reforms  involves  financial  stabilization  of  the \nsector  entities  created  earlier  under  the  reform  program  and \ncorporatization of another four sector entities, to enable improved \ngovernance \nintroduce \nthrough  regulatory  oversight,  and \nstructured competition and discipline in the sector. \n \nThe  objective  of  the  Sector  Development  Program  is  to  support \nthe  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  reform  the  power  sector  through  the \nfinancial  stabilization  of  two  major  transmission  and  distribution \ncompanies,  Power  Grid  Company  of  Bangladesh  (PGCB)  and \n(DESCO),  and  partially \nDhaka  Electric  Supply  Company \nBangladesh  Power  Development  Board  (BPDB)  and  Dhaka \nElectric  Supply  Authority  (DESA)  by  settlement  of  outstanding \ndues  of \nits  semi-autonomous  and \nautonomous  bodies  to  the  sector.  These actions will prepare the \nsector  for  long-term  financial  sustainability  and  gradually  relieve \nthe Government of financial support for the sector. \n\nthe  Government,  and \n\n\fLoan Amount and Terms  The  loan  will  be  for  $100.0 million  from  ADB's  ordinary  capital \nresources.  The  loan  will  have  a  15-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 3 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-end fee \nof 0.5% (the front-end fee will be capitalized in the loan), and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan and Program \nAgreements.  \n \nUntil 30 June 2005 \n \n31 December 2004 \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Program \nCompletion Date \n \nTranching \n\nThe program loan will be released in two tranches of $50 million, \neach  to  support  restructuring  of  the  finances  of  PGCB  and \nDESCO  through  the  settlement  of  the  outstanding  dues  of  the \nGovernment,  and  its  semi-autonomous and autonomous bodies, \nto  the  distribution  entities,  DESCO,  Dhaka  Electric  Supply \nAuthority (DESA), Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) \nand  the  rural  cooperatives  (PBSs),  subject  to  policy  initiatives \nconcerning \nindependent \ntariffs,  competitive  generation,  and \nregulation being taken by the Government. \n \nMinistry  of  Finance  and  Ministry  of  Power,  Energy  and  Mineral \nResources. \n \nThe  proceeds  of  the  program  loan  will  finance  the  foreign \nexchange  costs  (excluding  local  taxes  and  duties)  of  items, \nprocured  for  the  power  sector,  produced  in  and  procured  from \nADB\u2019s  member  countries,  other  than  those  specified  in  the \nnegative list in Appendix 9 and imports financed by other bilateral \nand multilateral sources. \n \nCounterpart funds will be used by the Government  in accordance \nwith  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB,  to  support  the  financial \nrestructuring  of  PGCB  and  DESCO  and  the  adjustment  costs \nassociated with the Program. \n \n\n \nExecuting Agencies \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nCounterpart Funds \n\niv \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\fThe Project Loan \n \nProject Description \n\n \n\n \nRationale \n\n \nObjectives \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \n\n  v\n\nThe project loan has three components: \n \nPart  A:  Construction  of  2  x  100-megawatt  (MW)  peaking  power \ngeneration capacity at Siddhirganj near Dhaka. \n \nPart  B:  Construction  of  a  national  load  dispatch  center  at \nRampura in Dhaka. \n \nPart  C:  Renovation,  upgrading,  and  extension  of  distribution  in \nRajshahi, Serajgonj, Bogra, Pabna, Rangpur, Dinajpur, Joypurhat, \nThakurgaon,  Nilphamari,  and  Gaibanda  towns  in  northwest \nBangladesh. \n \nThe  power  system  of  Bangladesh  is  still  suffering  from:  (i)  load \nshedding  due  to  lack  of  peak  load  capacity  during  peak  hours \n(twice  as  high  as  the  base  load  demand);  (ii) lack of facilities for \nefficient  competitive  dispatch  of  the  power  generation;  and \n(iii) insufficient  and  unreliable  supply  of  electricity  in  urban  and \nrural areas outside Dhaka. In improving governance and financial \nperformance some of sector entities have already been set up as \nindependent  companies  although  still  financially  suffering  from \nearlier  weak  management.  A  joint  intervention  of  investment  in \ngeneration  peak  load  capacity,  load  dispatch  facilities,  and \nupgraded  distribution  system  simultaneously  with \nfurther \nunbundling and corporatization of additional power sector entities, \nand  financial  support  through  settlement  of  the  Government\u2019s \nimpact  on \noutstanding  dues  will  have  a  major \nperformance and financial viability of the sector. \n \nThe objective of the Project is to improve the quality of electricity \nsupply  by  (i) improving  peak  load  generation  capacity  to  reduce \nload  shedding,  (ii) introducing  competition \nin  generation  by \ninvestment  in  a  new  National  Load  Dispatch  Center  (NLDC), \n(iii) improving  network  reliability,  and  (iv) increasing  access  to \nelectricity  services  by  upgrading  and  new  investments  in  ten \ntowns  in  the  northwest  of  Bangladesh.  This  support  will  further \nboost the restructuring of the sector by transferring the operation \nof  the  urban  distribution  in  northwest  Bangladesh  from  BPDB  to \nNorth-west Zone Power Distribution Company (being created) and \nimprove  losses  and  extension  of  electricity  supply  to  urban \nhouseholds and the commercial sector. This will also improve the \nsupply situation in rural areas under PBSs that are getting power \nthrough  medium-voltage  networks  of  some  urban  distribution \nsystems under the Project. \n \nThe  Project  is  estimated  to  cost  $328.5 million  equivalent, \nforeign  exchange  costs  and \ncomprising  $195.6 million \n$132.9 million in local currency costs. \n\nlong-term \n\nin \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nSource \n\n \nADB Project Loan \n \nCofinance\u2014NDF  \n \nGovernment/EAs \n \nDomestic \nBorrowing \n\nForeign \nExchange \n($ million) \n \n186.0 \n \n9.6 \n \n0.0 \n \n0.0 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n($ million) \n \n0.0 \n \n0.0 \n \n98.7 \n \n34.2 \n\n($ million) \n\nPercentage \n\nTotal Cost \n($ million) \n\n \n186.0 \n \n9.6 \n \n98.7 \n \n34.2 \n \n328.5 \n\n \n56.6 \n \n2.9 \n \n30.1 \n \n10.4 \n\nTotal \n\n132.9 \n\n195.6 \n\n100.0 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, EA = executing agency, NDF = Nordic Development Fund. \nSource: ADB staff estimates. \n \n\n \nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $186.0 million, from ADB's ordinary capital resources will \nhelp finance Parts A, B, and C of the Project. The loan will have a \n25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-end fee \nof 0.5% (the front-end fee will be capitalized in the loan), and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan and Program \nAgreements. \n \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  re-lent  to  PGCB  and  BPDB  (and  later \ntransferred  to  the  new  companies)  pursuant  to  subsidiary  loan \nagreements  with  terms  and  conditions  acceptable  to  ADB. \nRelending  terms  to  PGCB  and  BPDB  will  include  a  repayment \nperiod of 25 years including a 5-year grace period, and interest at \nthe  rate  of  5.0%  per  annum.  Foreign  exchange  risk  will  be \nassumed  by  PGCB  and  BPDB  during  the  life  of  the  respective \nsubsidiary loans. \n \n30 June 2008 \n \n31 December 2007 \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nImplementation will begin in December 2003 and be completed in \nDecember  2007.  Direct  supervision  of  subproject  implementation \nand  monitoring  of  subproject  operation  performance  will  be  the \nresponsibility  of \nthe \nthe  executing  agencies \nGovernment.  These  agencies  will  provide  quarterly  progress \nreports to ADB covering their respective responsibilities within 30 \ndays  from  the  end  of  each  quarter.  ADB  will  review  the \nimplementation  and  operation  of  the  Project  based  on  these \nreports and meet with the EAs and the Government semiannually \nto  discuss  project  progress.  ADB  will  also  monitor  the  overall \nperformance of the EAs. \n\n(EAs)  and \n\n\f \nExecuting Agencies \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n  \nBenefits and \nBeneficiaries of Power \nSector Development \nProgram \n\n  vii \n\n \nThe  EAs  will  be  BPDB  and  the  succeeding  Siddhirganj  Power \nStation Company for Part A, PGCB for Part B, and BPDB and the \nsucceeding North-west Zone Power Distribution Company for Part \nC of the Project. \n \nGoods  and  services  financed  by  ADB  will  be  procured  following \nADB's  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  For  such  procurement,  bid \nto  ensure  maximum \nspecifications  will  be  prepared  so  as \ncompetition  under \ninternational  competitive  bidding.  Advance \nprocurement has been allowed. \n \nConsultants will support PGCB, BPDB, and the new generation and \ndistribution companies, for their respective parts of the Project and \nwill be recruited in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for \nengaging domestic consultants . Consultants will essentially provide \ndesign review, quality assurance services, and training. ADB has \nagreed  to  the  request  of  the  Government  to  permit  internationally \nrecruited consultants to collaborate with domestic consultants.  \n \nThe  combined  intervention  of  the  proposed  investments  and  the \nprogram components are strongly linked and will further enhance \nthe  Government\u2019s  ongoing  reform  program  and  strengthening  of \nthe power sector\u2019s financial and economic viability over the next 5 \nyears,  and  improve  sector  oversight  and  governance,  thereby \nproviding  an  assurance  of  sustained  growth  of  the  sector  and \ngradually  relieve  the  Government  of  financial  support  for  the \nsector. The investment components will result in access to more \nreliable  supply  of  electricity  to  all  of  Bangladesh  through  the \nadditional  peak  load  power  generation  capacity  and  increased \naccess to electricity in the urban and rural areas of the northwest \nzone  through  the  upgrading  of  the  distribution  system  and \nconnection  of  about  170,000  new  domestic  and  commercial \ncustomers. In the commercial category, most of the consumers in \nthe  towns  utilize  between  100  to  120  kWh/month, indicating that \nthey  operate  small  businesses  and  shops.  The  investments  will \nhave a remarkable impact on the growth of cottage industries and \nenterprises  depending  on  electricity  for  lighting  as  well  as \nproductive  purposes.  A  significant  positive  human  development \nimpact  is  envisaged  through  availability  of  light  for  education, \nimproved  water  supply,  and  diagnostic  health  services  from \nimproved power supply. The National Load Dispatch Center is the \nessential \nfull \ncompetition  among  the  public  and  private  generation  plants  in \nachieving the most economical dispatch. By enforcing commercial \ndiscipline  in  the  sector,  inter  alia,  corporatization  of  another  four \nsector entities along with settlement of the Government\u2019s dues to \nthe sector and enforced revenue collection among the distribution \ncompanies,  the  financial  viability  of  the  entire  sector  will  further \nimprove. \n\nlinkage  and  prerequisite \n\nintroduction  of \n\nfor \n\n\fviii \n\n \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \nThe Program does not entail any major risks other than an ending \nof  the  continued  commitment  to  the  reform  program,  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s  compliance  with  the  settlement  of  the  outstanding \ndues, and of the continued improvement in management of PGCB \nand DESCO. The sector has comprehensive experience in setting \nup  new  companies  under  the  Companies  Act  from  previous \nprojects  and  the  settlement  of  the  dues  has  been  arranged  in \ncooperation  with  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  has  its  full  support. \nSimultaneously,  the  distribution  companies  have  geared  up  their \ncollection  drive,  including  from  government  institutions.  With \nregard  to  the  investment  components,  the  EAs  have  sufficient \ncapacity from implementation of previous similar kinds of projects, \nhence there are no major risks in the investment components. For \nthe reform process, the appointment of competent regulators is an \nimportant factor and is to be carefully monitored by all concerned \nexternal funding agencies. \n \n\n\f \n\nix \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  two  proposed \nloans to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Power Sector Development Program and \nthe Power Sector Development Project. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nThe  power  sector  in  Bangladesh  performed  poorly  through  the  late  1980s  and  1990s. \nThe  major  constraints  in  the  sector  were  (i) lack  of  institutional  capability;  (ii) unavailability of \nlong-term domestic capital for financing investments; (iii) limited foreign exchange debt service \ncapability  of  the  economy;  (iv) poor  management  systems  and  procedures;  (v) low employee \ncommitment;  and  (vi) institutional  weaknesses  in  governance,  banking,  law  enforcement,  and \njudicial processes, which are external to the sector but are essential for its proper functioning. \n \n3. \nIn 1994, the Government of Bangladesh adopted a paper titled Power Sector Reforms in \nBangladesh (PSRB), which was formulated in consultation with the major development partners \n(DPs)1 in the power sector. The PSRB outlined the reform process proposed to be followed by \nthe  Government  to  gradually  remove  the  constraints  in  the  sector  through  improvements  in \nsector  and  corporate  governance,  introduction  of  competition,  and  public-private partnerships. \nReform of the external environment was to be done through targeted interventions in the power \nsector. Sector and subsector analysis is further presented in Appendix 1. \n \n4. \nBangladesh\u2019s  annual  per  capita  electricity  consumption  of  110  kilowatt-hours (kWh) in \nFY2003 was the third lowest among the developing member countries of the Asian Development \nBank  (ADB),  after  Cambodia  and  Nepal.2  Despite  intensive  efforts  to  increase  coverage,  only \nabout 32% of the population has access to electricity.3 Consumption of electricity in Bangladesh \ngrew  at  an  average  annual  rate  of  8.2%  from  FY1994  to  FY2002,  with  major increases  in \nindustrial and residential use. The Power System Master Plan Study financed by ADB4 estimated \nthat  the  demand  for  electricity  would  increase  by  about  8%  per  year  for the following 10 years, \nwhich has been the actual growth. The current installed capacity is 4,710 megawatts (MW). The \npeak demand met was 3,622 MW on 17 August 2003.  \n \n5. \nInadequate supply of electricity is a major constraint to economic growth. During FY2003, \nload shedding in the range of 5\u2013468 MW was resorted to on 210 days for a total duration of 767 \nhours.  The  situation  has  improved  since  November  2002  with  (i) elimination  of  gas  supply \nconstraints to power stations, (ii) full commissioning of the 360 MW Haripur independent power \nproducer  (IPP)  station,  (iii) full  commissioning  of  the  450  MW  Meghnaghat-1  IPP  station  and \n100 MW expansion in Baghabari, and (iv) reinforcement of the Dhaka 230-kilovolt (kV) grid and \ncompletion of the Rampura 230 kV substation. Some load shedding is expected to continue until \nsubstantial  new  generation  capacity  is  added  to  the  system  to  (i) replace  very  old  power \nstations,  (ii) allow  for  routine  preventive  maintenance  through  creation  of  reserve  margin,  and \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB,  the  World  Bank,  Department  for  International  Development,  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation, \n\nKreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau, and the United States Agency for International Development.  \n\n2   In 2001, the annual per capita consumption was 55 kWh in Nepal and 30 kWh in Cambodia. Comparable figures \n\nfor some other developing member countries (DMCs) were 340 kWh for India, and 950 kWh for Thailand. \n\n3   Comparable figures for some other DMCs are less than 10% for Cambodia, 18% for Nepal, 82% for India, 48% for \n\nPakistan, and 98% for Thailand. \n\n4   ADB. 1993. Technical Assistance to Bangladesh on Preparation of a Power System Master Plan. Manila. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n(iii) meet  the  additional  demand  from  new  connections  and  suppressed  load  growth.  Erratic \npower supply has tended to increase the unwillingness of consumers to pay their bills, which in \nturn has led to shortages of funds for maintenance and has further aggravated the situation. \n \nB. \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nGovernment Policies and Plans \n\nThe  PSRB  envisions,  in  the  long-term,  a  structure  of  the  power  sector  based  on \n6. \n(i) separation of sector regulation and operation; (ii) autonomy and commercial orientation of the \nsector  entities;  (iii) separation  of  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution;  and  (iv) increased \nprivate  sector  participation.  Under  such  a  structure,  a  new  regulatory  authority  would  be \nresponsible  for  (i) setting  electricity  tariffs  and  determining  the  corresponding  performance \nnorms; (ii) collecting, verifying, and disseminating sector statistics; (iii) reviewing and approving \nlong-term  power  planning;  (iv) creating  and  maintaining  a  nondiscriminatory  and  commercial \nbusiness environment in the sector; and (v) adjudicating disputes between sector entities. While \ntransmission  will  remain  in  the  public  sector,  generation  and  distribution  assets  will  have  both \npublic  and  private  ownership.  The  objective  is  to  eliminate  monopolies  and  foster  competition. \nCommercial  discipline  and  good  customer  service  are  expected  to  be  achieved  through \ncompetition among entities in the power sector.  \n \n7. \nWith the initiation of reforms in 1994, the organizational setup of the sector has changed. \nWhereas  in  1994,  all  generation  was  with  BPDB,  today  there  are  several  public/private  and \nprivate  sector  entities  that  have  been  licensed  to  construct  and  operate  power-generating \nfacilities.  The  first  private  barge-mounted  power  station  started  operation  in  December  1998. \nThe  first  gas  turbine  of  the  Rural  Power  Company  (RPC)  at  its  Mymensingh  site5  started \noperation  in  April  2000  and  now  has  a  capacity  of  140  MW;  construction  of  a  70  MW  steam \nturbine  portion  is  in  progress  to  convert  the  plant  to  combined-cycle  operation.  Three  barge-\nmounted  power  stations  totaling  about  310  MW  are  operating,  as  are,  since  June  2002,  the \ncombined-cycle  plant  of  the  Haripur  (360  MW)  IPP  station,  the  Meghnaghat-1  (450  MW)  IPP \nstation,6  and  the  100  MW  expansion  at  Baghabari.  IPPs  now  account  for  about  40%  of  net \npower generation in the country. \n \n8. \nAs  a  direct  result  of  assistance  by  ADB  and  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau  (KfW),  five \nnew companies have been established\u2014 Power Grid Company of Bangladesh (PGCB), Dhaka \nElectric  Supply  Company  (DESCO),  RPC,  Ashuganj  Power  Company,  and  West  Zone  Power \nDistribution  Company.  While  RPC  was  a  new  start-up  generation  company,  PGCB  took  over \nassets and liabilities of the existing transmission operations of BPDB and DESA, while Ashuganj \nPower Company and West Zone Power Distribution Company took over assets and liabilities of \nthe  existing  operations  of  BPDB.  DESCO  was  created  based  on  a  transfer  of  assets  and \nliabilities  of  the  Mirpur\u2014later  expanded  to  cover  the  erstwhile  Gulshan  circle\u2014distribution \noperations  of  DESA.  Although  PGCB  and  DESCO  have  improved  their  operations  and  have \n\n                                                 \n5 The Rural Power Company Ltd. has 72% of its shares held by  private sector rural electric cooperatives and 28% by \nthe public sector rural electrification board (REB). It was established in 1994 as part of the policy dialogue for ADB \nLoan 1356-BAN(SF): Rural Electrification Project for SDR34.4 million, approved on 30 May 1995. \n\n6  Supported  by  ADB  through  TA  2338-BAN  (ADB.  1995.  Solicitation  for  Private  Sector  Implementation  of  the \nMeghnaghat Power Project. Manila) for $211,000, approved on 30 May 1995 and increased to $595,000 in March \n1998; and Investment Loan 7165/1793-BAN (ADB. 2000.  AES Meghnaghat Power Project. Manila) for $50 million \nloan;  and  31909-BAN  (ADB.  2000.  AES  Meghnaghat  Power.

Some indicators are highlighted in the table below and further details are presented \nin Table A1.2 in Appendix 1. \n \n\nTable 1: Performance of Distribution Entities FY1994 \u2013 FY 2003  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2002 \n\n2001 \n\n2000 \n\n1994 \n\n1999 \n\n2003 \n\n24.9 \n36.6 \n29.9 \n17.7 \n \n86.0 \n87.6 \n80.3 \n94.0 \n\n29.7 \n29.9 \n40.5 \n18.6 \n \n70.7 \n76.2 \n59.2 \n93.9 \n\n30.3 \n32.8 \n\u2013 \n15.6 \n \n82.1 \n79.5 \n\u2013 \n99.0 \n\n26.7 \n34.6 \n32.9 \n19.7 \n \n82.3 \n87.6 \n78.4 \n96.9 \n\n23.2 \n35.6 \n26.7 \n16.7 \n \n89.2 \n97.1 \n89.0 \n101.3 \n\n20.7 \n30.9 \n21.2 \n17.3 \n \n90.2 \n91.9 \n87.9 \n100.2 \n\n \nItem \nSystem Losses (%) \nBPDB \nDESA \nDESCOa \nREBa \nCollection (% of billing) \nBPDB \nDESA \nDESCO \nREB \nBPDB  =  Bangladesh  Power  Development  Board,  DESA  =  Dhaka  Electric  Supply  Authority,  DESCO  =  Dhaka  Electric \nSupply Company, Ltd., REB = Rural Electrification Board.  \n\u201c\u2013\u201c Data not available. DESCO was incorporated in 1996. \na\n During the presented period, several of the most poorly managed distribution areas were transferred from DESA to \nDESCO and REB, hence some years of declining performance indicators. However, REB and DESCO have quickly \nturned  around  these  areas  and  gradually  improved  their  performance  indicators.  Simultaneously,  this  transfer  has \nhelped DESA bring up its indicators for the remaining distribution areas. \nSource: Monthly management reports from the various sector entities. \n \nGood  governance,  at  both  the  sector  and  the  corporate  levels,  is  emphasized  in  the \n10. \nPSRB.  At  the  sector  level,  governance  is  to  be  improved  through  predictability  (long-term \nplanning,  codification  of  rules  and  regulations,  and  independence  of  regulatory  processes), \ntransparency  (systematic  dissemination  of  relevant  sector  information,  public  hearings,  and \ndiscussions  on  issues  before  they  are  decided),  and  accountability  (cause-effect  structure  of \nincentives).  At  the  corporate  level,  governance  is  being  enhanced  through  corporatization, \nindependence  of  the  boards  of  directors  from  the  Government,  introduction  of  work-based pay \nstructure, defined delegation of powers to staff, computerized management information systems, \nand commercialization of activities. \n \n11.  With regard to the Government\u2019s dues to BPDB, Rural Electrification Board (REB), and \nDESA,  it  is  imperative  for  the  Government  to  lead  in  commercializing  the  sector  by  liquidating \nthe  arrears  owed  by  it  and  its  agencies  to  BPDB,  DESA,  DESCO,  and  the  palli bidyut samity \n(rural  electric  cooperatives,  or  PBSs).  In  September  2001,  the  Government  made  a  special \nbudget  allocation  of  Tk690 million (about 30% of  its  total  dues)  to  settle  outstanding  dues  to \nBPDB and DESA. This process will be continued and expanded under the Program to include \nDESCO  and  PBSs,  along  with  a  comprehensive  financial  restructuring  of  the  sector,  initially \nfocused on PGCB and DESCO. \n \n12. \nThe Government has agreed to compensate DESCO for losses incurred during the initial \nperiod of operations. DESCO assumed charge of the loss-incurring Mirpur area from DESA in \nSeptember  1998.  At  that  time,  the  collection-to-import  ratio  of  Mirpur  was  35%.  With  great \nperseverance, DESCO has improved the operations in Mirpur and the collection-to-import ratio \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nnow  stands  at  over  69%.  DESCO  has  now  broken  even  on  a  cash  basis  in  its  current \noperations.  However,  there  is  an  overhang  of  accumulated  losses  incurred  during  this \nturnaround period of about Tk339.9 million ($5.8 million). Similarly, DESCO has just taken over \nthe  loss-incurring  Gulshan  area  from  DESA  in  February  2003.  However,  the  turnaround  of \nGulshan  will  be  more  rapid  than  Mirpur  since  DESCO  is  already an established company and \nnow  has  trained  human  resources,  and  Gulshan  is  not  as  poorly  run  as  Mirpur.  To  the  extent \nthat there will be such a shortfall in the first year of DESCO\u2019s operation of the Gulshan circle, \nthe  Government  has  agreed  to  com pensate  DESCO  for  earlier  accumulated  losses  by  a \nshareholders\u2019 unconditional loss-contribution. It is estimated that DESCO will incur a loss of up \nto  Tk1,180.0 million  ($20.0 million)  during  the  interim  period,  which  will  be  a  burden  on  its \nfinances.  It  is  the  intention  of  the  Government  to  facilitate  DESCO  to  be  the  first  profitable \ncommercial  distribution  entity  in  Bangladesh.  Hence,  the  Government  has  agreed  to  this \ncompensation.  \n \n13. \nBangladesh is facing an anticipated shortfall of about 2,500 MW of generating capacity \nover  the  next  5  years.  This  capacity  comprises  about  1,900  MW  of  base  load  generation  and \nabout  600 MW  of  peak  load  generation.  BPDB  has  invited  (or  is  inviting)  private  sector \nproposals  for  the  development  of  over  1,000  MW  of  capacity  over  the  next  5  years,  most  of \nwhich will be awarded to foreign private companies. Peak load power plants are not exposed to \nthe same kind of competitive dispatch as the base load power plants, hence are unsuitable for \nprivate sector participation.  BPDB  is  also  seeking  to  redevelop  its  only  hydropower  project  at \nKaptai  to  create  about  100 MW  of  additional  peak  load  capacity.  However,  actualization  of \nadditional  capacity  will  be  constrained  by  the  inflow  of  revenues  into  the  sector  and  the \nperception  of  domestic  and  international  investors  regarding  the  need  for  an  efficient  and \nimpartial regulatory system.  \n \n14. \nsince 1994: \n \n\nUnder the reform program, the Government has made the following major achievements \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\ncreation  of  a  competitive  diverse  market  of  independent  public  and  private \ngeneration companies; \nrestructuring of the sector by transferring all transmission assets and operations to a \nnew transmission company, PGCB; \nthrough  corporatization  of  DESCO  and  West  Zone  Power  Distribution,  and \nrestructuring  of  distribution  areas  from  other  public-operated  distribution  areas, \ncreation of a manageable and competitive environment through bench-marking; and \nin  establishing  a  transparent  energy  sector,  on  10  March  2003  Parliament  passed \nthe  new  Energy  Act  2003  as  the  basis  for  establishing  an  Energy  Regulatory \nCommission (ERC). \n\n \nThe  Government  is  continuing  its  restructuring  program  to  enable  a  business \n15. \nenvironment  for  the  sector  that  would  be  conducive  to  improving  the  sector\u2019s  operating \nefficiencies,  financial  viability,  service  to  its  consumers,  and  conservation  of  electricity.  It \nproposes to do this through (i) encouraging and facilitating private sector participation in power \ngeneration and distribution and fostering a transparent and competitive environment with a level \nplaying field between the public and private sectors; (ii) adoption of a corporatized \u201cprofit center\u201d \napproach  for  optimizing  the  operations  of  the  public  sector  power  utilities;  (iii) tariffs based on \ncommercial principles that enable costs to be recovered and reasonable returns to be made on \ninvestments; (iv) independent regulation and tariff setting backed up by statutory provisions; and \n(v) transparent, reasonable, direct, and quantified subsidies to targeted sections of  consumers. \nParliament, on 10 March 2003, approved the ERC Bill, which lays the basis for the ERC for the \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5 \n\nelectricity  and  downstream  hydrocarbon  sectors.  USAID  and  ADB7  are  assisting  the \nGovernment  in  establishing  the  ERC,  and  in  providing  capacity  building  to  comprehensively \namend the existing legislation, regulations, and tariffs in the sector to bring into effect the above \nprinciples. \n \n16. \non FY2003 statistics: \n \n\nAfter  implementation  of  this  Program  the  sector  will  have  the  following  structure  based \n\nTable 2: Division of Generation Capacity and Power Generated \n\nGeneration \n\nInstalled \nCapacity \n(MW) \n\nShare \n(%) \n\nPower \nGenerated \n\nShare \n(%) \n\nBPDB (Public)  \nIPPs (Private) \n\n3,420 \n1,290 \n4,710 \nBPDB = Bangladesh Power Development Board, IPP = independent power producers, MW = megawatt. \na \nSource: Monthly management reports from the various sector entiti es. \n\nBased on current installed capacity and a full year generation, the IPP share will increase to about 40%. \n\n12,160 \n6,531 \n18,691 \n\n72.6 \n27.4 \n100.0 \n\n65.1 \n34.9a \n100.0 \n\nTotal \n\n \n\nTransmission \nThe transmission grid has gradually been transferred from BPDB to PGCB, today the sole \nowner and operator of the entire transmission grid of Bangladesh.

The  major \nsources of funding were ADB, World Bank, France, Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW), Japan \nBank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC),  Department  for  International  Development (DFID), \nUnited States Agency for International Development (USAID), Nordic Development Fund (NDF), \nOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), and \nRussian  Federation.  Other  sources  include  the  Islamic  Development  Bank,  Kuwait  Fund  for \nInternational \nfor  Development,  Canadian \nArab  Economic  Development,  Saudi  Fund \nDevelopment  Agency,  United  Nations  Development  Programme,  Swedish \nInternational \nDevelopment Cooperation Agency, Belgium, Danish International Development Agency, Finnish \nInternational Development Agency, and foreign private sector. The PRC and the former Soviet \nUnion also provided suppliers\u2019 credit for power generation, transmission, and distribution. \n \n18.  While  ADB  has  assisted  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  in  urban  and  semi-\nurban areas, JBIC has concentrated its assistance on generation and rural electrification projects. \nDFID has financed transmission and distribution in the Dhaka area. USAID has been instrumental \nin establishing and funding REB and the first PBSs, and continues to provide technical support to \nthem.  KfW  has  assisted  in  augmenting  generating  capacity  and  in  reinforcing  transmission \nprojects. Other aid agencies have also financed generation projects, although France and OPEC \nhave  financed  some  transmission  and  distribution  projects  as  well.  The  World  Bank  (WB)  had \nearlier supported generation projects and distribution in smaller towns and rural areas. However, \nafter  the  reforms  were  initiated,  it  has  not  provided  any  assistance  to  the  sector  other  than \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7 \n\ntechnical assistance (TA) for soliciting private participation in power generation and establishing \nthe Power Cell,  which  is  mandated  to  plan  and  execute  reform  related  activities  and  act  as  a \nquasi-regulator until the statutory regulator is appointed. WB provided a loan of over $200 million \nfor  creation  of  an  infrastructure  development  fund  in  Bangladesh  and  provided  a  partial  risk \nguarantee for Haripur IPP plant. After almost a decade of absence, WB has recently approved  a \nproject  loan  of  $190 million  covering  rural  electrification  and  renewable  energy  and  is \nconsidering  another  one  tranche  program  loan  of  $250-300 million.  External assistance to the \npower sector is summarized in Appendix 2.  \n \n\n3. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n19. \nADB has been extensively supporting the power sector over the last 25 years. From being \na provider of funds for individual projects in the 1970s, it became a provider of funds as well as \ntechnical advice in the 1980s. Since the adoption of the PSRB in 1994, ADB has been providing \npolicy advice to the Government in implementing the PSRB, as well as funds to help achieve the \nleast-cost expansion program. During this involvement, ADB has learned the lessons outlined in \nthe following paragraphs.  \n \nThe key lessons identified from two project performance audit reports8 (PPARs) included \n20. \n(i) need  for  more  rigorous  checking  on  least-cost  design  of  projects;  (ii) need  to  strengthen \nfinancial  management  and  transparency  of  financial  statements;  (iii) necessity  of  major \ninstitutional  reforms  and  operational  improvements  for  the  success  of  a  project/program\u2014they \nshould be made a precondition for further lending. All these issues have been addressed in the \nlast projects for Bangladesh and are the main scope for further reforms in this Program as well. \n \n21. \nDelegation of powers from the Government to management of the sector entities and from \nthe  management  to  staff  is  crucial  for  speedy  and  efficient  decision  making.  Due  to  efforts  by \nADB,  delegation  of  power to the  sector entities\u2019  boards of directors and management has been \nsignificantly improved, resulting in speedier decisions on procurement by the newly established \ncompanies.  BPDB  and  DESA  are  also  restricted  by  the  Government's  personnel  and  wage \npolicies;  therefore,  recruiting  and  retaining  of  competent  staff  and  retrenching  or  dismissing  of \nexcess or nonperforming staff are inhibited. The situation is being addressed and a beginning has \nbeen  made  by  RPC,  PGCB,  and  DESCO  through  market  and  work-based pay structures.  The \nabove factors clearly underscore the limited extent of the improvements that can be made to the \nexisting  power  sector  entities  in  their  present  form.  It  is  therefore  essential  to  (i) create new \nsector  entities  that  are  not  subject  to  the  organizational  limitations  of  BPDB  and  DESA,  and \n(ii) establish an overall environment of commercialization in the sector.  \n \n22. \nFundamental changes in infrastructure sectors take time to implement even in developed \ncountries. In developing countries, change is more difficult to implement and, therefore, requires a \ngradual  approach.  Speeding  up  reforms  is  functional  only  if  the  change  is  comprehensive.  For \nexample, increasing tariffs too rapidly may help the finances of the sector but often undermines \nthe objectives of the reforms by penalizing the good consumer if the utilities collect only from a low \npercentage of consumers. Affordability is also a factor. Rapid rises in tariffs can drive up the costs \nof  electricity  so  that  it  becomes  unaffordable  to  poorer  consumers,  whereas  more  gradual \nincreases could have allowed time for managing the effects of the increase. \n \n\n                                                 \n8 Power System Rehabilitation and Expansion Project, 1992; and Seventh Power Project, 1998. \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n4. \n\nCompliance  with  Reform  Actions  Under  Earlier  Asian  Development  Bank \nLoans \n\nThe  ADB-financed  Eighth  Power  Project9  closed  on  23  February  2001  and  the  Rural \n23. \nElectrification  Project  (footnote  5)  closed  on  29  January  2001.  All  structural  reform-related \nconditionalities  stipulated  in  these  loans  have  been  met.  Likewise,  all  the  restructuring \nconditionalities  stipulated  under  the  ongoing  Ninth  Power  Project10 and Dhaka Power System \nUpgrade Project11 have been fulfilled, although at a slower pace than initially anticipated. \n \n24.   Some of the major achievements under earlier ADB loans relating to reform actions that \nhave  been  accomplished  by  the  Government  are:  (i) handing  over  all  transmission  assets  to \nPGCB;  (ii) corporatization  of  Ashuganj  Power  Station;  (iii) handing  over  distribution  assets  to \nDESCO and REB; and (iv) creation of the West Zone Power Distribution Company. \n \n25. \nThe  fulfillment  of  some  conditions  related  to  restructuring  has  been  delayed,  in  some \ncases by over a year, e.g., some parts of the transfer of transmission grid from DESA to PGCB \nand  distribution  grid  from  DESA  to  DESCO.  Nevertheless,  the  Government  must  be \ncomplimented  in  its  determination  to  follow  through  with  these  politically  difficult  and  sensitive \nactions.  Some  actions  have  led  to  law  and  order  problems  that  the  Government  had  to  tackle \nfirmly.  Since  the  reform  program  started  in  1994,  the  Government has always delivered on the \nconditionalities it has agreed to as part of the process of power sector reforms. The Government \nhas  also,  on  its  own,  started  the  process  of  rationalizing  retail  electricity  tariffs  for  residential \nconsumers  of  BPDB  and  DESA,  as  also  the  base  retail  tariffs  for  the  sector.  Effective \n1 September  2003,  the  Government  reduced  domestic  tariff  slabs  from  five  to  three  and  raised \ntariffs in all three slabs, leading to a weighted average increase of about 5%. The Government is \nalso  preparing  a  tariff  policy  that  will  help  the  regulator  set  tariffs  in  the  future.  This  gives  DPs \nconfidence that the Government will take the necessary actions to determinedly pursue reforms in \nthe future.  \n \n\n5. \n\nPerformance of Executing Agencies \n\n26. \nThe  political  unrest  in  the  country  over  the  last  few  years  has  significantly  affected  the \ncollection operations of both BPDB and DESA, since many commercial establishments, including \nbanks,  were  closed  for  prolonged  periods  and  those  that  were  open  functioned with minimal \nservices. DESA was particularly hard hit since Dhaka, as the capital city, was the center of the \nunrest,  and  normal  life  in  the  city  was  disrupted  for  longer  periods  than  in  other  towns.  During \nFY2000,  the  collection-to-generation  ratio  of  BPDB  and  the  collection-to-import ratio of DESA \nwere  65.9%  and  65.1%,  respectively.  These  were  way  below  the  targets,  which  were  75%  for \nBPDB  and  70%  for  DESA.  In  FY2001,  however,  with  the  implementation  of  the  ADB-funded \nFinancial  Management  Upgrade  Project,12  the  collection  performance  of  both  utilities  has \nimproved  dramatically,  resulting  in  a  collection-generation  ratio  of  70.8%  for  BPDB.  DESA\u2019s \nperformance remained stagnant on account of the deferred payments instituted with the PBSs \nthat  had  just  taken  over  DESA\u2019s  loss-incurring rural areas in FY1999.

REB\u2019s  (PBSs\u2019)  overall collection-\nimport performance deteriorated slightly to 77.4% in FY2001 on account of the bad areas taken \nover from DESA. However, the trends are in the right direction and these PBSs should contribute \npositively  to  the  sector\u2019s  financial  viability  in  FY2003.  Along  with  delegation  of  power,  close \nfinancial monitoring of operations is crucial to improved performance. Financial and operational \nperformance indicators of BPDB, DESA, REB (PBSs), and DESCO have been closely monitored \non  a  monthly  basis  over  the  last 8 years since the start of reforms. Performance indicators are \nsummarized in Appendix 1. \n \n\n6. \n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy \n\nADB  recognizes  that  (i) the substantial external assistance to the sector in the past has \n27. \ninduced  a  tendency  in  the  sector  agenc ies to depend on external assistance for their funding; \n(ii) recovery and development must come from within the sector; and (iii) the Government and all \nmajor  aid  agencies  must  realign  their  individual  strategies  to  emphasize  the  objective  in  (ii).  In \nconsultation with the Government and the other DPs involved in the sector, ADB has developed \nits strategy to improve the power sector in Bangladesh. The strategy consists of (i) changes in the \nbusiness  environment  through  corporatization,  commercialization,  and increasing private sector \nparticipation;  (ii) institutional  improvements  in  BPDB  and  DESA;  (iii) creation  of  new  sector \nagencies that could serve as role models for the sector; (iv) enlarging the scope of the PBSs; and \n(v) strengthening  the  long-term  planning and regulatory processes in the sector. The proposed \nProgram addresses items (i), (ii), and (iii) of this strategy. Item (iv) is an ongoing process and item \n(v) has partially been addressed through the Power System Master Plan (PSMP), the creation of \nthe  Power  Cell,  and  ADB\u2019s  technical  assistance  (TA)  Support  for  an  Energy  Regulatory \nAuthority,13 which supports the establishment of the ERC.  \n \n28. \nIn  the  past,  ADB  and  other  DPs  extended  assistance  to  discrete  power  projects  in \nBangladesh on a \u201cpolicy reform linked assistance\u201d, with substantial policy actions to be taken as \npreconditions  for  such  assistance.  This  approach  enabled  the  Government  and  the  executing \nagencies  (EAs)    to  gradually  build  technical  and  managerial  capacity  in  the  sector.  Further, this \ngradual approach has allowed for a smooth transition from the prereform monopolistic model to \nthe  postreform  unbundled  model  without  any  major  service  disruption  or  agitation  among \nemployees. However, in order to make its interventions more policy oriented and focused, ADB \ndecided to concentrate its assistance in the power sector on a limited number of selected entities \nand  areas.  The  first  stage  reforms  have  all  progressed  satisfactorily,  creating  opportunities  to \nwiden  and  deepen  the  reforms  as  part  of  a  second  stage.  This  stage  involves  financial \nstabilization of the sector entities created earlier, to enable improved governance of the sector \nthrough regulatory oversight, and to introduce structured competition and discipline in the sector. It \nis  considered  that  a  sector  development  modality,  comprising  a  policy  loan  in  parallel  with  an \ninvestment loan, will be the best instrument to achieve this end.  The Program, which will be the \nfifth assistance provided by ADB in support of the reform process, is consistent with ADB's 2003 \nCountry Assistance Program for Bangladesh. \n \nThe Government and ADB have agreed on a framework for the restructuring of the power \n29. \nsector, which is presented in Appendix 3 (Power Sector Roadmap). The Government\u2019s  proposed \ninvestment  in  the  sector  during  the  period  FY1996\u20132006  is  in  the  order  of  $6.6  billion.  The \nProgram seeks to further key objectives of the reform process that will mobilize greater resources \n\n                                                 \n13 ADB. 1998.

The \nProgram is the first mixed-modality, sector development program in Bangladesh.  \n \n\n7. \n\nPolicy Dialogue \n\n30. \nADB,  World  Bank,  JBIC,  DFID,  USAID,  and  KfW  have  all  been  involved  in  policy \ndialogue with the Government about issues in the power sector, with ADB playing the role of DP \ncoordinator. ADB has also played a major role in drawing up the reform assistance strategy of \nthe  DPs.  In  addition,  it  organized  coordination  meetings  for  the  power  sector  in  1992,  1994, \n1995, and 1996, and for the power and natural gas sectors, annual coordination meeting from \n1997.  ADB-led aid coordination meetings in December 1992, December 1994, and September \n1995  contributed  to  the  formulation  of  reforms  and  identification  of  reform-linked projects in the \nsector. ADB also provided TAs to review electricity legislation,14 prepare a power system master \nplan  (footnote  4),  upgrade  the  financial  management  of  BPDB  and  DESA  (footnote  12),  seek \nprivate  sector  implementation  of  the  Meghnaghat  Project  (footnote  6),  and  corporatize  the \nAshuganj Power Station of BPDB.15 ADB has been instrumental in assisting the Government to \ndraw up a plan for the planned transformation of the sector, as well as the creation of new sector \nentities. \n \n31. \nThe medium-term goals of the policy dialogue with the Government up to 2005 and the \nresults achieved so far are summarized in the roadmap in Appendix 3. Generation is no longer a \nmonopoly and has significant private sector interest, and the public sector stations are starting \nto  be  corporatized  and  commercialized.  The  transmission  function  of  BPDB  has  been \nsegregated and corporatized. Distribution is being corporatized in the Dhaka area as well as in \nthe southwest zone, and the private sector PBSs have increased their share of sales from 13% \nin FY1993 to 35% in FY2003. Further corporatization will be carried out in the northwest zone \nas part of the proposed Program. Average retail power tariffs were increased by about 15% (in \nSeptember  and  December  1996),  and  an interim  formula  for  semiannual  adjustment  of  retail \npower tariffs to take into account fluctuations in fuel costs and foreign exchange rates has been \nsuccessfully implemented.16 On the regulatory side, work has progressed through the creation \nof  the  Power  Cell.  The  recently  approved  ERC  Bill  will  form  the  basis  for  regulation  of  the \nunbundled sector. \n \n\n8. \n\nAid Coordination \n\n32. \nAid coordination in the sector has been intensive since the start of the reform process. \nThe DPs hold a formal coordination meeting every year where sector policies and achievements \nare  reviewed  by  headquarters  staff,  and  over  the  last  year  the  DPs  have  introduced  quarterly \nmeetings at the Resident Mission level to monitor progress. Informal views are also exchanged \nbetween  ADB  missions  that  visit  Dhaka  and  the  resident  missions/offices  of  other  DPs \nwhenever possible. Regular visits by senior ADB staff to Washington, DC, and by World Bank \nstaff to Manila, have also ensured that there is full exchange of views between the World Bank \nand  ADB.  Aide-m\u00e9moires  of  ADB  missions  are  shared  with  all  DPs,  and  points  of  specific \nconcern to any DP are discussed by email and telephone. \n \n\n                                                 \n14 ADB. 1992.

Especially,  the  Program  will  assist  the  Government  in  (i) providing \nsupport and incentives for sector reform activities such as independent tariff setting, competitive \ndispatch of generation, and functional segregation of sector activities; (ii) promoting the Power \nGrid  Company  of  Bangladesh  (PGCB)  and  the  Dhaka  Electric Supply Company (DESCO) as \ncommercially viable companies that can access capital markets for at least a part of their future \nin  northwest \ncapital  needs;  and  (iii) modernizing  and  upgrading  distribution  systems \nBangladesh.  The  Project  components  are  linked to the ongoing power sector reforms and will \n(i) expand  peak  load  generation  capacity  to  reduce  load  shedding,  (ii) introduce competition in \ngeneration,  (iii) enhance  network  reliability,  (iv) increase access to electricity services in urban \nareas of  northwest  of  Bangladesh,  and  (iv) improve  efficiency  and  financial  viability  including \nfurther  corporatization  BPDB\u2019s  generation  and  distribution.  The  entire  exercise  is  geared  to \nimproving  the  power  sector\u2019s  financial  and  economic  viability  over  the  next  5  years,  and  to \nenhance sector oversight and governance, thereby providing an assurance of sustained growth \nin the sector. Appendix 4 shows the program framework. \n \nB. \n\nSpecial Features \n\nthe \n\nthrough \n\nPGCB  will  seek  commercial  cofinancing \n\nissue  of  Tk2,000 million \n36. \n($34.2 million)  in  long-term  tax-free  bonds  for  financing  the  local  currency  costs  of  the  NLDC. \nDiscussions with commercial banks have already been initiated by ADB in cooperation with the \nmanagement  of  PGCB.  If  the  bonds  are  successfully  raised,  this  will  be  the  first  direct \ncommercial borrowing by the public part of the power sector. Utilities cannot be financially self-\nsustaining without a long-term bond market. Currently, there is no bond market in Bangladesh, \nand it is the Government\u2019s desire that such a market be developed, since raising capital through \nbonds  reduces  the  requirement  of  the  Government  to  finance  the  sector.  Since  this  is  a \ndevelopmental effort and also helps the Government\u2019s finances, the Government has indicated \nits willingness to accord tax-free status to this bond issue. \n \nC. \n\nThe Program Loan \n\n1. \n\nObjectives \n\n37. \nThe  objective  of  the  Program  is  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  (i) reform the \npower  sector  through  the  restructuring  of  two  major  transmission  and  distribution companies \nand  (ii) prepare  the  sector  for  long-term  financial  sustainability,  gradually  relieving  the \nGovernment of financial support for the sector.  \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n \n\n2. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n38. \nThe program loan comprises support for restructuring the finances  of PGCB, DESCO, and \npartially BPDB and DESA, by settlement of the outstanding dues of the Government, and its semi-\nautonomous  and  autonomous  bodies,  to  DESCO,  DESA,  BPDB,  and  REB,  subject  to  policy \ninitiatives  by  the  Government  concerning  tariffs,  competitive  generation,  and  independent \nregulation. PGCB and DESCO, as the first power sector companies, have  for the last year  been \nable to make a financial turnaround of their daily operations. Now that they are finally established \nas sound and long-term viable companies, the inherited financial constraints and their impact on \nthe balance sheets need to be addressed.  \n \nA diagrammatic description of the dues owed by the Government and its bodies to each \n39. \nsector  agency,  the  interagency  debts,  and  the  debts  owed  by  agencies  to  the  Government  is \ngiven in Appendix 5. \n \n\n3. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n40. \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $100.0 million  from  ADB's  ordinary  capital \nresources  to  help  finance  the  Program.  The  loan  will  have  a  15-year  term,  including a grace \nperiod  of  3  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-\nend  fee  of  0.5%  (the  front-end  fee  will  be  capitalized  in  the  loan), and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft Loan and Program Agreements. The Government has provided \nADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on \nthe basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB.  \n \n\n4. \n\nCounterpart Funds \n\n41. \nThe counterpart funds to be generated from the proceeds of the policy loan will  be used \nto  finance  the  adjustment  costs  associated  with  the  Program,  including  settlement  of \noutstanding  arrears  of  BPDB,  DESA,  DESCO,  and  REB,  due  from  the  Government  and  its \nsemi-autonomous/autonomous  bodies;  payoff  of  DESCO\u2019s  accumulated  losses  in  Mirpur; and \nfor  establishing  DESCO\u2019s  base  working  capital  for  turnaround  of  the  Gulshan  circle  of  DESA \nafter its transfer.  \n \n\nTable 4: Estimated Public Sector Arrears as of 30 June 2002 \n \n\nDefaulting Agencies \nMinistries \nClosed-Down State-Owned Enterprises \nRunning Semi-Autonomous and Autonomous bodies \nTotal Owed to the Power Sector \n Source: Accounts of the concerned power sector entities. \n\nAmount ($) \n56.8 \n48.3 \n68.4 \n173.5 \n\n \n \n42. \nThe Government of Bangladesh is expected to incur adjustment costs  over the reform \nperiod to recover and/or adjust outstanding dues of the Government and its semi-autonomous \nand autonomous bodies amounting to about Tk10,300 million ($173.5 million). \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n13 \n\n5. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\na. \n\nProgram Management \n\nFor  the  program  loan,  the  borrower  will  be  the  Government  and  the  EAs  will  be  the \n43. \nMinistry  of  Finance  and  the  Ministry  of  Power,  Energy  and  Mineral  Resources  of  the \nGovernment. These two ministries will be the overall coordinators of the Program. \n \n\nb. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement \n\n44. \nThe proceeds of the policy loan will finance the foreign exchange costs (excluding local \ntaxes and duties) of items, preferably procured for the power sector, produced in, and procured \nfrom ADB\u2019s member countries, other than those specified in the negative list in Appendix 6 and \nimports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. \n \n45. \nIn  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedure \nand  Related  Requirements  for  Program  Loans,  the  proceeds  of  the  program  loan  will  be \ndisbursed  to  the  Government  as  the  Borrower.  No  supporting  import  documentation  will  be \nrequired. Loan proceeds will be disbursed on the basis of certification provided by the Borrower, \nconfirming that in each year which policy loan proceeds are expected to be disbursed, the value \nof  total  imports  minus  (i) imports  from  nonmember  countries,  (ii) ineligible  imports,  and \n(iii) imports financed under other official development assistance, is equal to or greater than the \namount  expected  to  be  disbursed  during  the  year.  The  Government  will  open  an  account  (the \ndeposit account) at Bangladesh Bank into which the proceeds of the loans will be deposited and \nfrom  which  all  withdrawals  will  be  made.  The  Government  will,  however,  certify  with  each \nwithdrawal  request  its  compliance  with  this  formula.  Otherwise,  import  documentation  under \nexisting  procedures  will  be  required.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  loan  proceeds \nand  verify  the  accuracy  of  government  certification.  Loan  proceeds  may  be  used  to  finance \neligible  imports  for  which  expenditures  were  incurred  180  days  before  the  loan  became \neffective.  However,  retroactive  financing  is  limited  to  20%  of  the  policy  loan  amount.  Monthly \nstatements of the deposit account will be attached to the semiannual report of the policy loan. \n \n46. \n$50.0 million17 on fulfillment of the following: \n\nThe loan will be released in two tranches and made available as follows: First tranche of \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \nThe  Government  shall  have  settled  at  least  $90 million  of  accumulated  and \noutstanding  dues  for  the  period  up  to  and  including  30  June  2002  for  supply  of \nelectricity  to  the  Government  or  to  any  of  the  Government\u2019s  closed-down state-\nowned  enterprises.  In  settling  such  liabilities,  the  Government  may  use  a \ncombination  of (a) cash payments and (b) accounting adjustments against debt \nservice  liabilities  that  may  have  accrued  to  power  sector  entities  against  the \nGovernment. \n \nThe  Government  shall  cause  DESA  to  more  systematically  and  actively  pursue \ncollection of DESA's all unrecovered accounts receivables relating to the supply \nof  electricity  through  its  erstwhile  Mirpur  division  in  accordance  with  procedures \nto be agreed with ADB. \n \n\n                                                 \n17 Including front-end fee of $0.5 million. \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe  Government  shall  have  taken  all  necessary  steps  to  render  the  ERC \noperational.  The  Government  shall  further  have  caused  the  appointment  of  at \nleast  three  commissioners  to  the  ERC  pursuant  to  the  rules  and  regulations  for \nsuch appointments as set forth in the ERC Act 2003. \n \nThe  Government  shall  have  caused  (a)  the  adoption  on  a  pilot  basis  of  a  \u201cgrid \ncode\u201d  for  the  power  sector  and  (b)  issuance  by  the  relevant  authorities  of  the \nGovernment of a notification of such adoption of a \u201cgrid code\u201d acceptable to ADB. \n \nThe relevant authorities of the Government shall have caused the adoption of a \ncompetitive regime for dispatch of electricity on the basis of incremental cost per \nunit  of  generation  of  electricity  and  shall  have  granted  approval  to  PGCB  to \nexercise such a regime (cooperative pool) for its dispatch, all in accordance with \nterms acceptable to ADB. For avoidance of doubt, in such a competitive regime \nfor  dispatch  of  electricity,  the  capital  cost  of  an  electricity  generation  plant  shall \nbe  recovered  on  a  fixed  basis  whereas  the  incremental  cost  of  electricity \ngeneration  per  unit  shall  be  recovered  on  the  basis  of  actual  dispatch  of \nelectricity. \n \nThe \nthe  Government  shall  have  adopted  and \noperationalized  a  new  regime  for  transmission  billing  in  accordance  with  terms \nand  procedures  agreed  with  ADB.  The  new  billing  regime  to  be  adopted  and \noperationalized  by  the  Government  shall  require  billable  amounts  to  be \nseparated by (a) energy purchased from BPDB and (b) charges for transmission \nservices  rendered  by  PGCB,  resulting  in  distribution  companies  paying  two \nseparate  bills,  one  to  BPDB  for  the  cost  of  energy  purchased  and  the  other  to \nPGCB for the cost of transmission services rendered. \n \nThe Government and its various regulatory agencies, as appropriate, shall have \ngranted all required approvals for PGCB to issue 7\u201310-year, tax-free bonds of up \nto  Tk2,000 million  in  one  or  more  tranches  to  finance  local  currency  costs  of \nconstructional  equipment  of  the  NLDC  to  be  carried  out  by  PGCB  under  this \nProgram.  \n\nrelevant  authorities  of \n\n \nThe Government shall have settled payment of all accumulated and outstanding \ndues  for  supply  of  electricity  for  the  period  up  to  and  including  31  December  to \nthe  Government  and  to  any  of  its  closed-down  state-owned  enterprises.  In \nsettling  such  liabilities,  the  Government  may  use  a  combination  of  (i)  cash \npayments and (ii) accounting adjustments against debt service liabilities that may \naccrued to the relevant power sector entities against the Government. \n \nThe  Government  shall  cause  its  current  operating  autonomous  and  semi-\nautonomous bodies to settle all accumulated and outstanding dues for supply of \nelectricity  to  them  up  to  and  including  31  December  2003.  In  cases  where  any \nsuch  entity  fails  to  fully  settle  its  dues  to  the  relevant  power  sector  entity  or \nentities  by  the  agreed  upon  date,  the  Government  shall  settle  all  such  dues, \nusing a combination of (i) cash payments and (ii) accounting adjustments against \ndebt  service  liabilities  that  may  have  accrued  to  such  power  sector  entities \nagainst the Government. Any amount of dues settled by the Government in such \n\n \n47. \n\nSecond tranche of $50 million on fulfillment of the following: \n\n\f \n\n \n\n15 \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nmanner shall be considered as loan extended by the Government to the relevant \nnon-paying autonomous or semi-autonomous body as the case may be. \n \nThe  Government  shall  have  appointed  an  independent  auditor  acceptable  to \nADB  for  undertaking  a  comprehensive  investigation  of  the  nature,  causes,  and \nextent of past unrecovered losses in DESA and other power sector entities due \nto  nonpayment  of  electricity  supply  bills  by  nonpublic  customers.  Such  an \nindependent  auditor  shall  carry  out  its  tasks  in  accordance  with  terms  of \nreference  agreed  between  the  Government  and  ADB  and  report  in  detail  on, \namong  other  things,  (a) policies  and  practices  that  have  in  the  past  resulted  in \nfailure  of  power  sector  entities  to  collect  payments  for  provision  of  electricity; \n(b) recommend  mechanisms  through  which  the  Government  through  its  own \ninstruments or through third-party private mechanisms (such as collection action \nby  designated  banks  or  other  financial  institutions)  may  launch  efforts  in \nrecovering  all  or  at  least  a  part  of  such  unrecovered  past  dues  for  electricity \nsupply; and (c) recommend strategies for mitigating future losses, including ways \nof  improving  and  preserving  records  on  defaulters  and  the  extent  of  default \namounts  that  expedite  any  required  recovery  action  in  the  future.  The \nGovernment shall have agreed to present the report of such independent auditor \nto ADB and to release the full report to the public within 6 months of the release \nof the second tranche. \n \nTo  the  extent  that  in  spite  of  the  renewed  efforts  by  DESA  at  collection  of \nunrecovered  accounts  receivables  as  contemplated  in  para.  45(ii)  above,  there \nremains as of the date of the second tranche, an uncollected balance of accounts \nreceivables for the period prior to 1 September 1998, the Ministry of Finance and \nBPDB shall cause a shareholders' unconditional loss contribution to DESA in an \namount equal to such unrecovered accounts receivables. \n \nTo  the  extent  that  there  is  a  shortfall  (as  calculated  by  determining profit after \ndepreciation)  in  the  first  year  of  DESCO\u2019s  operations  of  the  Gulshan  circle,  the \nMinistry of Finance and DESA shall provide additional cash support to DESCO to \ncover  such  shortfalls  in  DESCO\u2019s  finances  by  way  of  enabling  it  to  effect  a \ncomplete financial turnaround of the Gulshan circle. \n \nThe  Government  shall  cause  the  reorganization  of  BPDB,  DESA,  and  BPDB\u2019s \ninto \nnorthwest  zone  distribution  network  and  Siddhirganj  power  station \nindependent  corporate  bodies  incorporated  under  the  Companies  Act  1994,  as \namended.  The  Government  shall  further  ensure  that  each  such  entity  is \nconstituted  in  accordance  with  principles  and  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB, \nprovided however, that at least 50% of the membership of the board of directors \nof  each  such  entity  shall  be  persons  who  are  neither  current  employees,  nor \nhave they been employees in the preceding 3 years of the Government or any of \nits  public  or  semi-public  organizations.  At  least  25%  of  all  board  members  of \neach  of  the  companies  shall  be  representatives  of  independent  consumer  or \nprofessional interests. \n \n\n(vii)  DESCO  and  PGCB  shall  have  filed  their  first  tariff  applications  to  the  ERC, \nestablished under the ERC Act 2003, and the Government shall have agreed in \nwriting  to  cause  the  ERC  to  process  all  such  applications  within  3  months  of \nreceipt of the subject applications. \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nD. \n\nThe Project Loan \n\n1. \n\nObjectives \n\n(viii)  Subject  to  receipt  of  bids  deemed  credible  on  the  basis  of  evaluation  criteria \nagreed with ADB beforehand, the Government shall have awarded a contract on \na  build-own-operate  basis  for  the  Meghnaghat-2  Project  with  a  generating \ncapacity of equal or more than 450 MW, unless otherwise agreed with ADB. \n\n48. \nThe objective of the Project is to improve the quality of the electricity supply and this will \nbe  achieved  by  (i) improved  supply  of  electricity,  reduced  load  shedding,  and  balancing  the \nnational grid regarding supply/demand through construction of about 200 MW peak load power \ngeneration  capacity;  (ii) support  and  incentives  for  further  sector  reform  activities  such  as \nindependent  tariff  setting,  competitive  and  optimized  dispatch  of  generation,  and  functional \nsegregation  of  sector  activities,  through  investment  in  an  NLDC;  and  (iii) improved access to \npower supply in the relatively underdeveloped northwest region of Bangladesh.  \n \n\n2. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\nThe project loan includes funding for the following components: \n\n49. \n \n\nPart A - \n\nPart B  -  \nPart C -  \n\n2  x  100 MW  peaking  power  generation  capacity  at  Siddhirganj,  near \nDhaka; \nthe NLDC at Rampura in Dhaka; and \nrenovation, upgrading, and extension of distribution in Rajshahi, Serajgonj, \nBogra, Pabna, Rangpur, Dinajpur, Joypurhat, Thakurgaon, Nilphamari, and \nGaibanda towns in northwest Bangladesh. \n\n \nElectricity  demand \n\nto \n\nfrom \n\nis  mainly \n\nin  Bangladesh \n\n50. \nthe  residential  sector  and \nconsequentially  there  are  sharp  peaks  in  the  demand  for  electricity  between  9  am  and  1  pm, \nand between 6 pm and 10 pm each day, the evening peak being greater than the morning one. \nAt present, these peaks are met either by load shedding or by the use of base load units, which \nare  inappropriate  to  serve  these  types  of  loads  leading  to  higher  fuel  costs  and  greater \nmaintenance requirements for the machines. \n \nThe  Power  System  Master  Plan  (PSMP)  of  1995  (footnote  4)  developed  a  least-cost \n51. \ngeneration addition plan up to 2015. This plan includes a mix of base load and peak load plants, \ncorresponding \nthe  electricity  demand  characteristics  of  Bangladesh.  The  PSMP \nrecommended  installing  800 MW  peaking  power  plants  by  2005.  As  part  of  the  plan,  2  x \n100 MW  open-cycle  gas  turbine  generating  units  are  proposed  as  Part  A  of  the  Project  to  be \ninstalled  within  existing  Siddhirganj  power  station  complex,  which  is  close  to  a  major  load \ncenter. The proposed plant will meet electricity  demand of the country especially in the Dhaka \narea  during  peak  hours,  which  will  address  the  low  voltage  problem  and  improve  system \nreliability.  The  proposed  gas  turbine  plant  will  be  built  virtually  as  a  replacement  of  the  old \ninefficient  power  plants  (after  dismantling  3  x  10 MW  steam  plants  and  the  1  x  50 MW steam \nplant)  and  there  will  be  no  adverse  impact  on  the  surrounding  area.  The  technology  for  these \nunits is proven and no major risks are foreseen. The plant is designed to be fired on natural gas \nand requirement will be 3.0 million cubic feet per hour. The fuel will be supplied from the existing \nsupply system of Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17 \n\nThe  plant  will  comprise:  (i) two  units  of  open-cycle  gas  turbine  generating  units, each \n52. \nhaving  a  capacity  of  100  to  120 MW;  (ii) two  sets  of  unit  transformers  for  two  gas  turbines; \n(iii) three sets of gas booster compressors for two gas turbines and one standby. The efficiency \nof each gas turbine generating unit will be approximately 33% at site conditions of 35 degrees \nCelsius, 1,013 bars, and 98% relative humidity. \n \n53. \nIn  order  to  run  the  country\u2019s  power  transmission  system,  which  is  the  responsibility  of \nPGCB,  in  coordination  with  generation  and  distribution,  it  is  essential  to  set  up  a  computer-\ncontrolled NLDC with the modern energy management system (EMS) and supervisory control \nand  data  acquisition  (SCADA)  facility,  and  a  fiber  optic-based  fast  communications  network. \nThis will be able to centrally control the generation, transmission, and distribution economically, \nefficiently, and securely by fixing the instantaneous generation target of a unit through analyzing \nthe present scenario of demand and availability of generation. The facilities will support PGCB \nfor the most economic dispatch of power generation. \n \n54. \nThe  proposed  Part  B  of  the  Project  is  to  establish  an  NLDC  at  Rampura,  Dhaka, \ncomprising  EMS  and  SCADA,  to  manage  the  230/132kV  electrical  power  network  and \nassociated  substations  and  power  stations.  The  proposed  Project  will  also  include  a \ncommunications system suitable for transmission of an electrical power system\u2019s data, voice, \nand  control  commands.  The  new  NLDC  will  be  of  sufficient  size  to  accommodate  PGCB\u2019s \nrequirements in 2007 plus to allow for developments up to 2015. Although this will be the first \nsuch installation in Bangladesh, BPDB (Chittagong) and DESA have been exposed to a smaller \nsupervisory  control  and  data  acquisition  system  built  under  ADB-funded  projects,  which  is \noperating  successfully.  However,  in  order  to  ensure  that  the  NLDC  is  designed,  engineered, \nconstructed,  and  operated  as  per  standards,  the  loan  includes  provision  for  hiring  an \ninternational  consulting  firm  to  help  PGCB.  Training  of  PGCB  staff  in  operation  and \nmaintenance will be provided by the supplier of the NLDC as part of its contract. \n \nCurrently, the size of the Bangladesh power system is about 4,700 MW, and by 2007 is \n55. \nexpected  to  be  about  7,000 MW.  The  existing  central  load  dispatch  center  is  equipped  for \nsystem monitoring only, using voice communication and is incapable of managing a large power \nsystem with several generation and distribution entities involved. It cannot take into account the \neconomic  and  commercial  parameters  and  the  stability  needs.  Private  generation  has  already \nstarted along with  that  of  public  sector  enterprises  and  the  power  system  is  becoming  bigger \nand more complex, both technically and commercially. \n \nCompetitive  dispatch  of  generation  plants  will  reduce  the  cost  of  generation  to  the \n56. \nsystem. A modern facility to enable such dispatch will also help in planning for maintenance of \nthe  various  generation  units  and  power  system  facilities,  leading  to  greater  system  reliability. \nThis  is  essential  if  more  private  sector  investments  are  to  be  introduced  into  the  generation \nsubsector.  \n \n57. \nPart  C  of  the  Project  involves  upgrading  and  extending  the  distribution  network  in \nnorthwest Bangladesh by renovating, rehabilitating, and extending the 33 kV, 11 kV, and 0.4 kV \ndistribution  system  in  10  towns.  The  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  improve  system  reliability, \nreduce system losses, connect prospective consumers, and strengthen the distribution network. \nThis  is  conventional  technology  and  should  not  pose  any  technical  risk  to  BPDB  and  the \nproposed  North-west  Zone  Power  Distribution  Company.  This  support  will  further  boost  the \nrestructuring of the sector by transferring the operation of the urban distribution from BPDB to a \nnewly created company and reduce losses, including all types of commercial losses. It will also \nextend electricity supply to urban households and the commercial sector. \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n \n58. \nThe  main  components  of  Part  C,  distribution,  are:  (i) renovation  of  one  132/33 kV \nsubstation;  (ii) renovation  of  19  33/11 kV  substations,  (iii) installation  of  11  new  33/11 kV \nsubstations, (iv) installation of 1,562 11/0.4 kV distribution transformers having a total capacity \nof  300 megavolt-amperes  (MVA),  (v) installation  of  10  km  of  33 kV  cable,  (vi) installation  of \n115 km  new  33 kV  lines,  (vii) renovation  of  102  km  33 kV  lines,  (viii) installation  of  584  km  of \nnew 11 kV and 0.4  kV lines, and (ix) renovation of 500 km of 11 kV and 0.4 kV lines. \n\n \n3. \n\nCost Estimates \n\nThe summary cost estimates of the project components are given in Table 5.

The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  a  front-end  fee  of  0.5%  (the  front-end fee \nwill be capitalized in the loan), and such other terms and conditions to be set forth in the draft \nLoan and Program Agreements. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its \ndecision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  on  the  basis  of  these  terms  and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. The borrower will be the People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  Bangladesh.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  re-lent  to  PGCB  and  BPDB  (and  later \ntransferred  to  the  new  companies)  pursuant  to  subsidiary  loan  agreements  with  terms  and \nconditions  acceptable  to  ADB.  Relending  terms  to  PGCB and BPDB will include a repayment \nperiod of 25 years, including a 5-year grace period, and interest at the rate of 5.0% per annum. \nThe foreign exchange risk will be assumed by PGCB and BPDB during the life of the respective \nsubsidiary loans. \n \n\n5. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n62. \nThe implementation schedule of the Project is in Appendix 8. Implementation will begin \nin  December  2003  and  be  completed  by  December  2007.  Direct  supervision  of  subproject \nimplementation and monitoring of subproject operation  performance will be the responsibility of \nthe EAs and the Government. BPDB and PGCB have established units that are designated to \nbe  in  charge  of  the  implementation  issues.  The EAs will provide quarterly progress reports to \nADB  covering  their  respective  responsibilities  within  30  days  of  the  end  of  each  quarter.  ADB \nwill review the implementation and operation of the Project based on these reports and will meet \nwith  the  EAs  and  the  Government  semiannually  to  discuss  project  progress.  ADB  will  also \nmonitor the overall performance of the EAs. Components procured under NDF funds will follow \nNDF\u2019s procurement guidelines. \n \n\na. \n\nProcurement \n\n63. \nGoods  and  related  services,  as  well  as  civil  works  financed  by  ADB,  will  be  procured \nfollowing  ADB's  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  For  such  procurement,  bid  specifications  will  be \nprepared so as to ensure maximum competition under international competitive bidding. Contracts \nestimated to cost in excess of $500,000 for equipment and related services, and $1,000,000 for \ncivil works will be subject to international competitive bidding requirements, and supply contracts \nvalued at $500,000 or less, except small and off-the-shelf items valued at less than $100,000, will \nbe procured under international shopping procedures. Small and off-the-shelf items valued at less \nthan  $100,000  may  be  procured  following  direct  purchase  procedures.  To  encourage  local \nmanufacturers, suppliers, and contractors to participate in international competitive bidding, ADB\u2019s \ndomestic preference scheme may be utilized. Contract packages are listed in Appendix 9. \n \n\nb. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nInternational  consultants  (consulting  firms  as  well  as  individual  consultants)  will  assist \n64. \nPGCB,  BPDB  (Part  A),  and  the  new  generation  company  for  evaluation  of  bids  and  project \nimplementation supervision (including assistance to establishing an environmental and safety unit \nfor  the  new  power  generation  company)  for  their  respective  parts  of  the  Project.  They  will  be \nrecruited in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants . In the case of consulting firms, the quality \nand cost-based selection method will be implemented. Consultants will essentially provide design \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\nreview,  quality  assurance  services,  and  training.  ADB  has  agreed  to  the  request  of  the \nGovernment  to  permit  internationally  recruited  consultants  to  collaborate  with  domestic \nconsultants.  Consulting  services  required  for  the  NLDC  are  estimated  at  about  168  person-\nmonths  of  international  and  domestic  consultants  with  expertise  in  SCADA  engineering, \ncommunication, and civil/structural engineering. Similarly, 136 person-months of international and \ndomestic  consulting  services  are  expected  for  the  peak  load  power  plant,  covering expertise in \nmechanical, electrical, instrument, and civil engineering.  \n \n\nc. \n\nAdvance Procurement \n\n65. \nAll the EAs have sufficient expertise in procuring materials for the works entrusted to them \nunder  the  Project  and  are  allowed  to  initiate  advance  procurement  action  for  the  goods  and \nconsulting  services  to  be  financed  by  ADB.  The  Government  has  been  advised  that  ADB's \napproval of advance action on procurement and recruitment of consultants does not commit ADB \nto  subsequently  approve  the  Project  or  to  finance  the  recruitment  and  procurement  costs. \nRetroactive financing has not been permitted. \n \n\nd. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n66. \nSince  the  disbursements  under  the  Project  will  be  mainly  for  the  supply  of  goods  and \nconsulting  services,  ADB's  commitment  letter  and  direct  payment  procedures  will  be  used  for \nthe purpose. Disbursement under the loan will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook and with detailed arrangements agreed by the Government and ADB. \n \n\ne. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n67. \nThe  EAs  of  the  project  components,  BPDB,  and  its  succession  companies  as  well  as \nPGCB and DESCO will have their annual financial statements and project accounts audited by a \nprofessional  auditing  firm,  acceptable  to  ADB.  They  will  maintain  separate  accounts  for  the \nProject.  Unaudited  statements  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  within  6  months  of  the  close  of  the \nfinancial year and audited statements within 3 months thereafter. \n \n\nf. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n68. \nThe  EAs  will  prepare  separate  progress  reports  for  their  respective  investment  and \nprogram components and submit them to ADB on a quarterly basis. The reports will provide a \nnarrative  description  of  progress  made  during  the  period,  changes  in  the  implementation \nschedule,  problems  or  difficulties  encountered,  the  performance  of  the  project  implementation \nconsultants,  and  the  work  to  be  carried  out  in  the  next  period.  The  progress  reports  will  also \ninclude a summary financial account for the investment and program components, consisting of \nproject expenditures during the period year to date, and total expenditure to date. ADB will review \nthe implementation and operation of the Program based on these reports and meet with the EAs \nand the Government semiannually to discuss project progress. Program completion reports will be \nsubmitted to ADB within 3 months of program completion.  \n \n69. \nBPDB, PGCB, and the new generation and distribution companies established under this \nProgram will carry out the program performance monitoring. Performance will be evaluated on the \nbasis of performance indicators/targets stipulated in the program framework (Appendix 4). \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n21 \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IM PACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nSocial Aspects \n\n1. \n\nSocial and Poverty Issues \n\n70. \nSince the Program seeks to lower the costs of electricity supply and improve efficiencies \nin operation of the grid, all the electricity consumers of Bangladesh will benefit. The distribution \nupgrade and extension in the northwest part of the country will benefit the urban as well as the \nrural population in the area, both in terms of extension of services to more consumers in urban \nareas  as  well  as  in  the  improvement  of  quality  of  supply  for  both  urban  and  rural  areas.  The \nprogram  and  project  components  will  result  in  indirect  social  and  poverty  benefits.  Improved \nfinancial management through corporatization of BPDB and DESA and independent tariff rulings \nwill  benefit  all  consumer  categories.  Commercialization  will  result  in  improved  corporate \ngovernance  minimizing  corruption,  reducing  losses,  and  allowing  the  Government  to  realize \nsavings  that  could  be  utilized  for  social  sectors.  Construction  and  operation  of  the  NLDC  in \nRampura will improve load dispatch and systems availability, reduce power outages, and lower \ncosts.  Dismantling  of  old,  small,  inefficient  steam  turbine  power  plants  and  their  replacement \nwith a peak power generation plant at Siddhirganj will improve the efficiency of the power supply \nto  Dhaka  city  and  will  benefit  several  industries  in  and  around  Dhaka,  including  small \nbusinesses that cannot afford alternative emergency lighting and power supply. Environmental \nbenefits  will  be  realized  from  the  operation  of  a  modern  plant  with  appropriate  monitoring \nequipment and management of environmental impacts. \n \nBPDB  and  the  new  companies  will  improve  their  procedures  for  public  interaction  by \n71. \nholding regular consultations with different consumer categories. Focus group discussions were \ncarried out with different consumer groups to assess the social and poverty impacts. \n \nImprovement  and  expansion  to  the  distribution  network  in  10  towns  in  the  northwest \n72. \nregion will bring considerable benefits in efficiency improvements to all consumers. These towns \nare  district  towns  and  the  lead  local  government  institution  is  the  municipality,  except  for \nRajshahi,  a  divisional  town  with  a  city  corporation.  Public  sector  institutions  like  schools, \ncolleges, and hospitals are operating in all the towns. Some have a university, medical college, \nmental  hospital,  etc.  The  population  of  the  towns  is  about  1.5 million and the total number of \nhouseholds  is  230,314.  The  districts  are  extensions  of  the  rural  economy.  Some  districts  are \nleading  vegetable-growing  areas  of  the  country.  Due  to  the  construction  of  the  Jamuna \nmultipurpose  bridge,  the  patterns  of  the  economy  are  changing  fast.  In  most  of  the  towns,  a \ngradual expansion of manufacturing and services operations is apparent. These operations are \ngenerally small, such as light engineering units, flower and rice mills, poultry feeders, bakeries, \nweaving and twisting mills, etc. Cold storage is also gradually increasing. Women work as the \nfront line workers in many of the units in all towns. \n \n73. \nThe  power  supply  situation  in  all  10  towns  is  similar.  The  inadequacy  in  distribution \ncapacity  causes  frequent  power  disruptions,  particularly  in  summer.  Almost  all  the  towns  face \nlow  voltage  problems.  The  Project  aims  to  enhance  the  power  distribution  capacity  in  the  10 \ntowns by renovation of existing network as well as installing new facilities. \n \n74. \nImprovements are expected in the following areas: (i) all consumers will receive reliable \nand  improved  quality  power  supply,  (ii) production  of  commercial  and  industrial  operations  will \nbe  smooth,  (iii) low  voltage  problems  will  improve,  and  (iv) replacing  old  lines  with  insulated \nones will improve safety. Electricity will be supplied to any group that requests new connection \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\nor  increased  supply.  Estimated  incremental  energy  supply  would  be  8,500  GWh  during  2007\u2013\n2013. \n \n75. \nThe improvement in the power distribution system will benefit all, including poor, women \nand children. In the commercial category, most of the consumers in the towns utilize between \n100 and 120 kWh, indicating that they operate small businesses and shops. The improvement \nwill have a remarkable impact on the growth of cottage industries and enterprises that depend \non  electricity  for  lighting  as  well  as  production.  Expansion  of  employment  opportunities  and \npoverty  reduction  is  envisaged.  Increased  income  and  employment  opportunities  for  the  poor \nare  expected  through  a  stable  power  supply  leading  to  stability  in  manufacturing/services \nprocesses  and  increased  productivity  of  the  enterprises.  Women\u2019s  self-employment initiatives, \nleading to additional earning, will be facilitated. \n \n76. \nAn  indirect,  but  significant  positive  human  development  impact  is  envisaged  through \navailability  of  light  for  education,  improved  water  supply,  diagnostic  and  health  services,  etc. \nChildren  and  students  will  benefit  from  longer  study  hours,  information  technology-based \nlearning,  and  communications  opportunities.  Improved  recreational  facilities  and  better \nmunicipal  services  are  expected,  resulting  from  improved  power  supply.  Rural  areas  will  also \nhave  a  similar  positive  impact  through  improved  power  supply  through  the  PBSs.  Intensity  of \nland  use  under  electrically  operated  irrigation  equipment  will  increase,  leading  to  additional \nemployment  opportunities.  The  operational  cost  for  all  equipment  and  lights  will  be  lower  than \nthose operated by diesel and kerosene. It is envisaged that the power distribution project for the \n10 towns will have a positive impact not only in the project towns but also in the adjoining rural \nareas.  In  general,  rural  electrification  has  far-reaching  social  and  poverty  impacts  will  benefit \nfrom this Program, since the quality of supply to the rural areas of the northwest will improve as \na result of the distribution upgrade. \n \n\n2. \n\nResettlement \n\n77. \nThe NLDC at Rampura and the new peak power generation plant at Siddhirganj do not \nrequire  land  acquisition.  Both  will  be  set  up  on  existing  sites  already  owned  and  managed  by \nBPDB and PGCB.  \n \n78. \nPart  C  of  the  Project  requires  a  total  of  4.5  acres  distributed  over  10  towns  with  the \nmaximum  land  requirement  at  any  site  not  to  exceed  0.5  acre.  The  land  is  required  for \nconstruction  of  33/11 kV  substations.  BPDB  explored  possibilities  to  minimize  land  acquisition \nand  four  towns  lowered  their  original  land  requirements  from  one  acre  to  half  an  acre.  BPDB \nhas  provided  written  confirmation  that  government  land,  free  of  encumbrances,  will  be  used, \nand  that,  if  needed,  private  land  will  be  purchased  through  tender  or  direct  negotiation.  There \nwill  be  no  compulsory  land  acquisition.  ADB  will  review  land  procurement  procedures during \nloan review missions. \n \nB. \n\nFinancial Aspects \n\nThe  financial  evaluation  of  the  Program  was  carried  out  in  real  terms  using  constant \n79. \n2003  prices  covering  the  three  project  loan  components  independently.  Incremental  costs  and \nbenefits  were  derived  by  evaluating  the  financial  position  of  the  EAs  under  with-  and  without-\nproject scenarios. All parts show a robust financial internal rate of return (FIRR).  \n \n80. \nFor Part A of the Project, the peak load power plant station, the tariff is  computed based \non  current  methods  of  tariff  setting  for  this  kind  of  power  plant,  demanding  a  rate  of  return  on \n\n\f \n\n \n\n23 \n\nincremental assets of at least 10%. On this basis, the resulting revenue tariff is Tk4.34 (7.36 US \ncents) per kWh, which is normal for a peak load power station. Including the 4% minimum rate \ntest, the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is estimated at 4.63% for this part. \n \nLikewise, for Part B of the Project, the revenues of the NLDC are computed based on an \n81. \nexpected  rate  of  return  on  incremental  assets  of  at  least  10%,  which  is  the  current  method  of \nsetting the wheeling charges for the transmission grid. In achieving a return of at least 10%, an \nincrease of Tk0.027 per kWh in transmission charges during 2008, the first revenue generation \nyear, has been assumed. Including the 4% minimum rate test, the WACC is estimated at 4.4% \nfor this part. \n \n82. \nFor Part C of the Project, renovation and upgrading of the distribution in the northwest of \nBangladesh, the FIRR is estimated at  26%. The WACC, including the 4% minimum rate test, is \n4.79%. \n \n83. \nSensitivity  analyses  for  the  three  components  found  comfortable  switching  values  for \nincreases in capital costs and energy input prices, reduction in benefits, as well as a worst-case \nscenario of a combination of these. From a financial point of view, all three project components \nare  robust  and  comfortably  above  the  respective  WACC.  Detailed  financial  analyses  are \npresented in Appendix 10. \n \nC. \n\nEconomic Aspects \n\n84. \nAll components of the Program will result in increased and efficient supply of electricity \nto consumers. For this Program, the economic analysis has been carried out for the investment \nportion (i) peak load power plant, (ii) NLDC, and (iii) the distribution network in 10 towns, only. \nAs the program component is financial restructuring of DESCO, PGCB, and other power sector \nentities, it has not been considered in the economic analysis. \n \n85. \nThe base case economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the peak load power plant was \nestimated at 20.2%, for the NLDC, 24.0%, and for the distribution network in 10 towns, 38.7%. \nThe combined EIRR for all three components was estimated at 29.1%. \n \n86. \nSensitivity  analyses  for  the  three  components  found  comfortable  switc hing  values  for \nincreases  in  capital  costs  and  energy  input  prices,  reduction  in  benefits,  change  in  curvature \nfactors,  as  well  as  a  worst-case  scenario  for  a  combination  of  all  these  aspects.  From  an \neconomic  point  of  view,  the  Program  is  robust.  Detailed  economic  analysis  is  presented  in \nAppendix 11. \n \nD. \n\nEnvironmental Aspects \n\n87. \nThe  reforms  as  part  of  the  policy  component  are  mainly  focused  on  financial \nrestructuring aspects, and therefore no potential environmental impact of the policy loan exists. \nHowever,  there  is  an  opportunity  to  establish  an  institutional  arrangement  for  handling \nenvironmental  and  safety  issues  within  the  corporatized  BPDB.  The  environmental  consultant \nwill be hired to identify the tasks and responsibilities of the unit and conduct training to prepare \nthe power plant to operate in an environmentally acceptable manner. \n \nThe  investment  component,  which  includes  dismantling  of  old,  inefficient,  power \n88. \ngenerating  units  at  Siddhirganj  is  not  expected  to  generate  any  significant  environmental \nimpacts.  During  the  construction  stage,  the  dismantling  and  disposal  of  old  machineries  that \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\nhave been used for a long time have to be carried out in accordance with good practices. The \nfollowing  mitigation  measures  need  to  be  adopted:  (i) all the old machinery will be washed, to \nclean it of oil content inside the project area, and the waste water has to meet effluent standards \nbefore disposing of it into a water body; (ii) the waste oil will only be sold to parties authorized \nby the Government for recycling, or reuse of waste oil; (iii) only clean scrap will be sold to the \nmarket. Although the operation of the new power plant will contribute to improving Dhaka\u2019s air \nquality,  it  is  necessary  to  undertake  environmental  monitoring  in  accordance  with  the \nBangladesh Environmental Conservation Act and Rules, to ensure that all emissions, effluents, \nand noise will meet the existing environmental standards of Bangladesh. \n \n89. \nThe  expansion  of  the  distribution  system  is  not  expected  to  generate  any  significant \nimpact,  either  during  construction  or  operation.  However,  the  location  of  the  substations  will \nneed  to  be  selected  carefully  to  avoid  noise  disturbance  to  neighboring  schools,  clinics,  etc. \nFurthermore, it is also required that only transformers free of Poly Chlorinated Biphenyl (PCB) \nwill be installed and that all cooling equipment should be free of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). \n \nE. \n\nRisks \n\n90. \nThe  success  of  the  Program  partially  depends  on  the  successful  creation  of  the  new \npower  generation  company  and  the  North-west  Zone  Power  Distribution  Company,  and \nrecruitment of their management. The sector has comprehensive experience in setting up new \ncompanies  under  the  Companies  Act  from  previous  projects.  Furthermore,  based  on  the \nongoing successful restructuring of the sector, advertised managerial positions have been very \nattractive  in  the  market.  Hence,  there  have  been  a  lot  of  applications  from  highly  qualified \nprofessionals for these positions.  \n \n91. \noutstanding dues to the sector and the recruitment of competent regulators for the ERC. \n \n\nOne major constraint might  be  the  Government\u2019s  compliance  with  the  settlement  of  its \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n92. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \nA. \n\nGeneral \n\nThe Government shall ensure that the policies adopted and actions taken, as described \n93. \nin the policy letter and the policy matrix, continue in effect for the duration of the program period. \n \n94. \nOne of the main concerns of ADB has been the maintenance of the independence of the \nboards  of  directors  of  the  sector  entities.  Following  appraisal  discussions,  the  Government  has \nagreed to the following conditions: \n \n\n(i) \n\nThe Government shall, at all times ensure and otherwise respect and support the \nautonomy and operational independence required to ensure, protect, and advance \nthe commercial and administrative interests of the sector entities, including but not \nlimited to BPDB, PGCB, DESA, DESCO, and such other entities as and when they \nare  incorporated  under  the  Companies  Act  1994,  as  amended.  Specifically,  the \nGovernment  will  not  intervene,  directly  or  indirectly,  in  the  conduct  of  policies  or \nactions of the sector entities, including their organizational structure, recruitment of \npersonnel,  procurement  decisions,  or  actions  regarding  of  their  respective \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n25 \n\n \n(ii) \n\noperational,  financial,  and  commercial  responsibilities.  The  Government  shall \nfurther  refrain  from  taking  any  action,  directly  or  indirectly, that inhibits, curbs, or \notherwise limits the independence of such entities.  \n\nThe Government shall ensure that within 6 months of the effective date, each of \nSiddhirganj  Power  Station  Company  and  North-west  Zone  Power  Distribution \nCompany  are  incorporated  under  the  Companies  Act  1994,  as  amended.  The \nGovernment shall further ensure that the boards of directors of each of Siddhirganj \nPower  Station  Company  and  North-west  Zone  Power  Distribution  Company  are \nconstituted  in  accordance  with  principles  and  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB, \nprovided that at least 50% of members of all such boards shall be persons who are \nneither  current  employees  nor  have  been  employees  in  the  preceding  3  years  of \nthe Government or any public or semi-public sector organization. At least 25% of \nall board members of each of the entities shall be representatives of independent \nconsumer or professional interests. \n\n(ii) \n\nThe  Government  and  its  agencies  shall  expedite  or  assist  in  expedition  of  the \nissuance  of  required  permits  and  licenses  for formation and operation of BPDB\u2019s \nand DESA\u2019s successor entities.  \n\nfor \n\nlocal  currency \n\nfunds  required \n\nThe  Government  shall  ensure \n\nThe  Government  will  assist  in  expediting  issue  of  due  permits  and  licenses  for  the \n\n \nthe \nthat  all \n95. \nimplementation of the Program are allocated and made available to the appropriate entities in a \ntimely manner.  \n \nIn the event that PGCB is unable for any reason to successfully raise all or any part of \n96. \nthe sum of Tk2,000 million through issuance of commercial bonds within 2 years of the effective \ndate  as  presently  contemplated, \nthe  Government  shall  make  appropriate  budgetary \narrangements  to  fund  PGCB  under  customary  terms  and  conditions  an  amount  of  up  to \nTk2,000 million that PGCB is unable to raise through such bond issuances. \n  \n97. \neffective implementation of the Program as may be required by law. \n \n98. \nThe  Government,  as  the  principal  shareholder,  shall  ensure  that  each  of  PGCB, \nDESCO,  and  the  new  power  sector  companies  established  pursuant  to  the  terms  of  this \nProgram  comply  at  all  times  with  the  following  financial  covenants:  (i) debt service coverage \nratio  of  not  less  than  1.2;  (ii) rate  of  return  on  equity  after  tax  not  less  than  10%;  (iii) rate of \nreturn  on  net  fixed  assets  not  less  that  5%;  (iv) debt-equity  ratio  not  exceeding  70:30;  and \n(v) accounts receivables not more than 2 months billing. \n \nThe  Government  shall  ensure  that  the  vendor\u2019s  agreement  dated  30  December  2002 \n99. \nbetween  BPDB  and  PGCB  regarding  transfer  of  BPDB  assets  to  PGCB  shall  be  revised  (i) to \nvalue the assets transferred at their historical value minus accumulated depreciations and (ii) to \nprovide for the purchase of such transferred assets through (a) a loan on customary terms and \nconditions  from  BPDB  to  PGCB  in  an  amount  that  is  equivalent  to  70%  of  the  value  of  such \nassets as determined by (i) immediately above and (b) increased equity of BPDB in PGCB in an \namount equal to 30% of the value of such assets as determined by (i) immediately above. No \naccrued  debt  service  charges  and  interest  before  the  actual  transfer  of  assets  should  be \ntransferred to PGCB. \n \n\n\f26 \n\n \n\n100.  The  Government  shall  cause  each  of  the  program  EAs  to  carry  out  performance \nmonitoring and reviews during program implementation, to evaluate the scope, implementation \narrangements,  benefit  monitoring,  progress,  and  achievement  of  the  objectives  of  their \nrespective  components  of  the  Program,  with  due  participation  of  nongovernment  and \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  project  performance \ncommunity-based  organizations,  all \nmanagement  system  guidelines.  These  reviews  shall  include  verification  of  (i) numbers  of \nadditional  connections  provided;  (ii) the  consumer  categories  of  the  new  connections;  (iii) the \nimprovements  in  service  for  existing  consumers  in  the  program  area;  and  (iv) institutional \nparameters such as accounts receivables and accounts payables, and system losses. \n \nB. \n\nLand and Resettlement \n\n101.  The  Government  shall  ensure  that  all  land,  rights  in  land,  or  rights  of  way  obtained  for \nthe  program  are  either  (a) government-owned  land  that  is  free  of  liens  or  any  other \nencumbrances  or  (b) private  land  that  is  purchased  through  arms-length  negotiations.  In  no \nevent shall such land be acquired through any compulsory land acquisition procedures. \n \n102.  Although  no  land  acquisition  or  land  clearing  activity  is  currently  anticipated  for  the \nexecution  of  the  Program,  in  the  event  such  activity  becomes  necessary,  the  Government  will \nprepare a resettlement plan in full compliance with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy and \nsubmit it to ADB for approval prior to any action on such matters. \n \nC. \n\nSocial Protection \n\n103.  The Government shall cause the EAs to require contracts for all civil works contractors \nto provide information at worksites on the risks of sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS \nas part of the health and safety measures of those employed during construction. \n \n104.  The  Government  shall  cause  each  of  the  EAs  to  ensure  that  all  program-related \nactivities are carried out in compliance with all applicable labor laws and regulations, including \nequal pay for equal work, and that no child labor is employed in any program-related work. \n \nD. \n\nEnvironment \n\nincorporated  and \n\n105.  The  Government  shall  cause  the  EAs  to  ensure,  with  respect  to  their  respective \ncomponents,  that  the  environmental  mitigation  measures  identified  in  the  initial  environmental \nfollowed  during  construction,  operation,  and \nexamination  (IEE)  are \nmaintenance of program facilities.  \n \n106.  The  Government  shall  ensure  that  the  EAs  implement  their  respective  components  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s  Environmental Assessment Guidelines,  2003  and  ADB\u2019s  Environment \nGuidelines for Selected Infrastructure Projects, 1993, as amended. \n \n107.  The Government shall cause BPDB to establish in its reorganized corporate structure a \nspecial unit dedicated to handling environmental and safety issues. \n \n108.  The Government shall cause the EAs to adopt provisions in relevant contract documents \nrequiring contractors implementing any aspect of the Program to adopt mitigation measures to \nminimize  adverse  environmental  impacts  during  dismantling  and  removal  of  plant  and \nequipment as well as during construction of facilities. \n \n\n\f \n\n27 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nthe  Program\u2019s  compliance  with \n\n109.  The  Government  shall  ensure  that  the  EAs  routinely  monitor  and  at  least  once  a  year \nassess  and  document \nthe  Bangladesh  Environmental \nConservation Act 1995 and Bangladesh Environmental Conservation Rules 1997. \n \n110.  The  Government  shall  ensure  that  BPDB  or  its  successor  entity,  Siddhirganj  Power \nStation  Company,  shall  not  commence  any  construction  related  to  Siddhirganj  power  plant  as \ncontemplated under this Program until after obtaining all due clearances and approvals from the \nGovernment\u2019s  Department  of  Environment.  The  Government  shall  further  ensure  that  the \nDepartment  of  Environment  holds  all  required  public  consultations  prior  to  granting  such \nclearances or approvals. \n \nE. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\n111. \nIn  addition  to  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  the  EAs  have  given  the \nfollowing  assurances,  which  have  been  incorporated  in  the  legal  documents  as  conditions  for \nthe effectiveness of the Power Sector Development Program loans: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nThe Government\u2019s Executive Committee of the National Economic Council shall \nhave approved the project concept papers (PCPs) for the Project Loan. \n \nDue  to  assets  transferred  from  BPDB,  the  Government  shall  have  caused  the \nwheeling  charge  accruing  to  PGCB  to  increase  by  Tk0.05/kWh,  and  shall  have \ncaused issuance by the relevant authorities of a revised tariff notification reflecting \nPGCB\u2019s wheeling charges and DESCO\u2019s power purchase costs. \n\nThe  Government  shall  have  caused  issuance  by  the  relevant  authorities  of  a \nnotification  setting  a  ceiling  of  30%  of  the  cost,  insurance,  and  freight value for \nCustom  Duties,  Value  Added  Tax  and  such  other  duties  levied  on  import  of \ngoods  procured  by  the  power  sector  entities,  including  but  not  limited  to  BPDB, \nPGCB,  DESA,  DESCO,  and  the  other  new  companies  to  be  established  under \nthe Companies Act, 1994 as amended. \n\nRelevant  authorities  of  the  Government  shall  have  approved  reorganization  of \nBPDB  and  DESA  as  corporate  bodies  organized  under  the  Companies  Act, \n1994, as amended. \n\nRelevant  authorities  of  the  Government  shall  have  approved  the  transfer of all \nmanagement,  operational  and  fiscal  authority  relating  to  (i) Siddhirganj  power \nstation  located  in  Siddhirganj,  near  Dhaka  and  (ii) BPDB\u2019s  northwest  zone \ndistribution  including  but  not  limited  to  BPDB\u2019s  electricity  distribution  network  in \nthe districts of Rajshahi, Serajgonj, Bogra, Pabna, Rangpur, Dinajpur, Joypurhat, \nThakurgaon,  Nilpharmari,  and  Graibanda  towns  in  northwest  Bangladesh, \nincluding all improvements and extensions to such distribution networks provided \nunder this Program, shall be duly transferred. \n\nEach  of  PGCB/NLDC  subsidiary  loan  agreement,  BPDB/Siddhirganj  subsidiary \nloan  agreement,  and  BPDB/North-west  Zone  Power  Distribution  Company \nsubsidiary  loan  agreement,  in  form  and  substance  satisfactory  to  each  of  the \nGovernment, BPDB, PGCB, and ADB as relevant, shall have been duly executed \nand delivered on behalf of the Government and the relevant party, and shall have \n\n\fbecome fully effective and binding upon the parties thereto in accordance with its \nterms, subject only to the effectiveness of the Loan Agreements. \n\n(vii) \n\nThe Program Loan Agreements and the Project Loan Agreement shall have been \nduly  executed  and  delivered  on  behalf  of  the  Government,  and  all  conditions \nprecedent to their effectiveness shall have been fulfilled. \n\n(viii)  Each of the project agreements, in form and substance satisfactory to each of the \nGovernment, BPDB, PGCB, and ADB as relevant, shall have been duly executed \nand delivered on behalf of ADB, BPDB, and PGCB and shall have become fully \neffective  and  binding  upon  the  parties  thereto  in  accordance  with  their  terms, \nsubject only to the effectiveness of the Project Agreements. \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loans  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \n112. \nADB  and  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the  provisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the \nArticles of Agreement of ADB, and recommend that the Board approve: \n \n\nthe  loan  of  $100,000,000   to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  Power \nSector Development Program from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources with interest to \nbe determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility;

The Government, through the ministry, wholly owns and supervises the Bangladesh \nPower Development Board (BPDB), the Dhaka Electricity Supply Authority (DESA), and the Rural \nElectrification Board (REB), which are its three executing agencies in the sector. Until fiscal year \n(FY) 1998, BPDB was responsible for all generation and most of the transmission in the country, \nand  also for distribution in district towns, municipalities, and some rural areas, while DESA was \nresponsible for distribution in the greater Dhaka area, including the capital city. The distribution of \nelectricity  in  most  of  the  rural  areas  of  Bangladesh  is  the  responsibility  of  the  67  rural electric \ncooperatives or palli bidyut samities (PBSs), which are organized, initially funded, and monitored \nby REB. As part of the sector reform process, new public sector entities such as the Power Grid \nCompany of Bangladesh  Ltd. (PGCB) and the Dhaka Electric Supply Company Ltd. (DESCO) \nas  well  as  private  sector  independent  power  producers  (IPPs)  such  as  the  Rural  Power \nCompany Ltd. (RPC),1 the Meghnaghat AES Power Company Ltd.,2 and the Haripur AES Power \nCompany Ltd. have been constituted. Over the next few years, these companies will own and \noperate a substantial part of the power sector\u2019s assets. The distribution subsector has also seen \na  major  rationalization  of  distribution  territory  between  DESA  and  the  PBSs.  The Government, \nBPDB, and REB have taken steps to involve the private sector by (i) adopting a private power \ngeneration  policy  in  October  1996,  (ii)  adopting  a  small  power  generation  policy  in  1998  to \nencourage distributed generation, and (iii) awarding contracts for  about 1,800 megawatts (MW) \nof generating capacity on a build-own-operate (BOO) basis. \n \n2. \nAfter DESCO became operational in 1998, and distribution territory between DESA and \nthe  PBSs  was  rationalized,  the  sector\u2019s  operational  and  financial  situation  improved  (Table \nA1.1).  \n \n\nTable A1.1: Performance of the Power Sector, FY1998 and FY2002 \n\n \n\n \n\n% \n \n\nDistribution Share  \n \nFY1998 \nGWh \n \n  3,485 \n  3,239 \n  1,435 \n    224a \n \n  8,383 \n\n42 \n39 \n17 \n  3 \n\n \n100 \n\nFY2003 \nGWh \n \n  4,838 \n  3,484 \n  4,888 \n     681 \n \n 13,891 \n\n% \n \n  35 \n  25 \n  35 \n  5 \n \n 100 \n\n \n \n \nBPDB \nDESA \nPBSs \nDESCO \n \n\nTotal \n\nDistribution Losses    Revenue Collections \n\n(% of imports) \nFY1998 \n \n\nFY2003 \n \n\n29.1 \n30.1 \n16.5 \n46.7a \n\n20.7 \n30.9 \n17.3 \n21.2 \n\n \n  27.7 \n\n \n  23.4 \n\n(% of billings) \nFY1998 \n \n  81 \n  80 \n  96 \n   88a \n \n  82 \n\nFY2003 \n \n  90 \n  92 \n  100 \n  88 \n \n  93 \n\nBPDB  =  Bangladesh  Power  Development,  DESA  =  Dhaka  Electric  Supply  Authority,  DESCO  =  Dhaka \nElectric Supply Company, Ltd., GWh = Gigawatt-hours, PBSs = rural electric cooperatives. \na As the Mirpur Division of DESA prior to its restructuring. The Gulshan takeover by DESCO on 9 April \n2003, raised the market share of DESCO to about 10% and reduced DESA\u2019s market share to about 24%. \nSource: Monthly management reports of sector entities. \n\n                                                 \n1   The Rural Power Company Ltd. has 68% of its shares held by the private sector rural electric cooperative and 32% \nby the public sector (REB). It was established in 1994 as part of the policy dialogue for ADB Loan 1356-BAN(SF): \nRural Electrification Project for SDR34.4 million, approved on 30 May 1995. \n\n2   Supported by ADB through TA 2338-BAN: Solicitation for Private Sector Implementation of the Meghnaghat Power \nProject,  for  $211,000,  approved  on  30  May  1995  and  enhanced  to  $595,000  in  March  1998;  Investment  Loan   \n7165/1793-BAN:  AES  Meghnaghat  Power  Project,  for  $50  million  loan;  and  31909-BAN  $70  million partial risk \nguarantee and complementary financing scheme no. 39, for $20 million, all approved on 5 December 2000. \n\n\f \n30\n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n3. \nBangladesh  has  limited  hydropower  potential  because  the  terrain  is  flat.  The  Jamuna-\nPadma-Meghna  river  system,  which  runs  north  to  south,  divides  the  country  into  two.  The \ncountry's entire proven recoverable reserves of oil (including condensate) estimated at 59 million \nbarrels,  and  natural  gas  estimated  at  12  trillion  cubic  feet  are  on  the  eastern  side  of  the  river \nsystem. The limited hydropower potential is also in the eastern part of the country. The western \npart  has  no  developed  commercial  sources  of  energy.  Coal  reserves,  which  are  in  the \nnorthwestern part, are deep beneath the surface and difficult to develop, and only one potential \nmine  with  a  limited  output  of  about  1  million  tons  per  annum  is  being  developed,  with  external \nassistance. Consequently, of the country's total installed generation capacity of 4,710 MW, about \n487 MW  fueled  by  diesel  oil  and  heavy  fuel  oil  and  261  MW  fueled  by  natural  gas,  are  in  the \nwestern  part.  Of  the  3,962  MW  in  the  eastern  part,  3,732  MW  is  based  on  natural  gas,  the \ncountry's  primary  commercial  fuel,  and  230  MW  on  hydropower.  In  terms  of  energy generated, \nabout 90% of the total in FY2003 was from gas -fired power plants.  \n \n4. \nIn  FY2003,  BPDB's  average  retail  tariff  for  its  ultimate  consumers  was  Tk3.31/kilowatt-\nhours  (kWh)  ($0.057/kWh),  DESA's  was  Tk2.93/kWh  ($0.051/kWh),  DESCO\u2019s  was Tk3.19/kWh \n($0.055/kWh)  and  PBS's  Tk3.45/kWh  ($0.060/kWh),  leading  to  a  weighted  average  tariff  of \nTk3.26/kWh,  ($0.056/kWh),  compared  with  the  estimated  long-run  marginal  cost  (LRMC)  of \nsupply  of  Tk3.98/kWh  ($0.068/kWh).  Rationalization  of  the  domestic  tariff structure, effective 1 \nSeptember  2003,  will  increase  unit  rates  at  retail  level  substantially.  The  LRMC  is,  however, \ndeclining  due  to  (i)  the  lower  costs  of  production  from  the  larger  private  sector  IPPs,  and  (ii) \ndeclining  losses.  Retail  tariffs  are  being  adjusted  every  6  months  to  reflect  increased  costs  of \ninputs by way of (i) the increased debt service burden on the utilities in local currency caused by \nthe  devaluation  of  the  taka  and  (ii) increase  in  the  price  of  natural  gas.  In  FY2002,  BPDB\u2019s \naverage  cost  of  generation  including  cost  of  power  purchased  from  IPPs  was  Tk1.84/kWh  only, \nwhich  has  further  decreased  in  FY2003  following  commissioning  of  the  450 MW  Meghnaghat-I \nIPP station. \n \n5. \nThe  political  unrest  in  the  country  over  the  last  few years has significantly affected the \ncollection operations of both BPDB and DESA since many commercial establishments, including \nbanks,  were  closed  for  prolonged  periods  and  those  that  were  open  functioned  with  minimal \nservices.  DESA  was  particularly  hard hit since Dhaka, as the capital city, was the center of the \nunrest,  and  normal  life  in  the  city  was  disrupted  for  longer  periods  than  in  other  towns.  During \nFY2000,  the  collection-to-generation  ratio  of  BPDB  and  the  collection-to-import ratio of DESA \nwere  65.9%  and  65.1%,  respectively.  These  were  way  below  the  targets,  which  were  75%  for \nBPDB  and  70%  for  DESA.  In  FY2001,  however,  with  the  implementation  of  the  ADB-funded \nFinancial  Management  Upgrade  Project,3  the  collection  performance  of  both  utilities  went up \ndramatically, resulting in a collection-generation ratio of 70.8% for BPDB. DESA\u2019s performance \nremained stagnant on account of the deferred payments instituted with the PBSs that had just \ntaken  over  DESA\u2019s  loss-incurring rural areas in FY1999. The  performance of the seven PBSs \nsupported by ADB in the Rural Electrification Project (footnote 3) has been very good, with an \naverage  collection-to-import  ratio  of  over  85%.  REB\u2019s  (PBSs\u2019)  overall  collection-import \nperformance slightly deteriorated to 77.4%  in  FY2001  on  account  of  the  bad  areas  taken  over \nfrom DESA. However, the trends are in the right direction and these PBSs are already contributing \npositively to the sector\u2019s financial viability in FY2002 and onward. The operational performance of \nBPDB, DESA, REB, and DESCO over the last 10 years since the start of reforms is summarized \nin Table A1.2. \n\n                                                 \n3   TA  2004-BAN:  Financial  Management  Upgrade  of  BPDB  and  DESA, for $1,000,000, approved on 26 November \n\n1993. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n  31\n\nTable A1.2: Operational Performance of the Power Sector, FY1994\u2013FY2003 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n2002 \n\n2000 \n\n1999 \n\n2001 \n\n1994 \n\n2003 \n\n \n \n18,433 \n3,984 \n17,672 \n \n\n \n \n \n \n      9,784      14,450     15,563      17,021 \n \n        578          824       2,248 \n      9,221      13,634     14,739      16,309 \n \n \n      7,441      11,351     12,469  \n      5,082        7,045       7,515       8,324 \n       3,745       5,405       5,965       6,762 \n       3,696       5,947       6,504       7,240 \n       2,538       4,469       4,831       5,392 \n        344          550          628 \n \n \n440 \n        205          369  \n          906       2,442       3,172       4,114 \n          765       1,989       2,546       3,386 \n \n \n\n \n \nItem \n \nGeneration (MkWh) \nBPDB (gross) \nIPP  \nNet  \nEnergy Import and Sales (MWh) \nGross BPDB Sales \nImport by BPDB Zones \nSales by BPDB Zones \nImport by DESA \nSales by DESA \nImport by DESCO \nSales by DESCO \nImport by REB \nSales by REB \nSystem Loss (%) \nBPDB a \nBPDB Zones b \nBPDB Zones (Net of sales to REB) \nDESAb  \nDESA (Net of Sales to REB and DESCO) \nDESCOb \nREBb \nOverall Power Systema \nBilling and Collection (Tk million) \nBPDB Bills \nBPDB Collection \nDESA Bills \nDESA Collection \nDESCO Bills \nDESCO  Collection \nREB Bills \nREB Collection \nCollection (as % of billing) \nBPDB  \nDESA  \nDESCO  \nREB  \n \nBPDB Collection-Generation  \nDESA Collection-Import  \nDESCO  Collection-Import  \nREB Collection-Import  \na As % of gross generation. b As % of import. \nBPDB = Bangladesh Power Development Board, IPP = independent power producer, DESA = Dhaka Electric Supply \nAuthority,  DESCO  =  Dhaka  Electric  Power  Supply  Authority,  MWh  =  Megawatt-hour,  REB  =  Rural  Electrification \nBoard, MW = megawatts. \nNotes:    1.

The  project  cost  estimates,  projections,  and  financing  plans  were \nprepared  using  current  prices.  Investments  in  respect  of  project  costs  include  a  physical \ncontingency at the rate of 5.0% of the initial capital investment.  \n \nA. \n\nFinancial Internal Rate of Return \n\nThe  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  for  the  three  project  components  was \n\n2. \ncalculated as follows. \n\n1. \n\nPeak Load Power Plant  \n\nThe  first  component  of  the  project  is  installation  of  the  peak  load  power  plant  (gas \n3. \nturbine) at Siddhirganj, with a capacity of 200 megawatts (MW), which will run for 6 hours a \nday  at  an  estimated  availability  of  98%  to  generate  429,240  megawatt-hours  (MWh) \nannually.  As  it  is  a  new  gas  turbine  plant,  and  running  during  peak  hours  only,  a  98% \navailability level is considered normal, keeping in view that the remaining period of the day is \nsufficient for its repair and maintenance. \n\n4. \nThe FIRR was calculated assuming fuel cost of 1.5 US cents/kilowatt-hour (kWh) and \noperation,  maintenance,  and  administration  cost  at  1.0%  of  its  capital  outlay.  It  has  been \ncalculated  for  a  period  of  17  years  including  2  years  of  construction  with  a  life  span  of  15 \nyears with no residual value. Based on ruling tariff-setting principles, demanding a return on \nincremental investments of at least 10.0%, the revenue comes out at Tk4.34 (7.36 US cents) \nper kWh, which looks  normal given that it is a peak load power station. This is the prevailing \ntariff-setting principle and as such will be implemented as well. The FIRR calculations for the \npeak load power plant are given in Supplementary Appendix F.  \n\n2. \n\nNational Load Dispatch Center \n\n5. \nThe  FIRR  for  the  transmission  component  has  been  calculated  for  a  period  of  24 \nyears  including  4  years  of  construction.  A  period  of  20  years  is  considered  normal  for \nrevenue  generation  with  the  proposed  capital  investment.  The  investment  in  the  national \nload  dispatch  center  will  result  in  savings  in  fuel  and  other  operational  costs  of  generating \npower  because  of  facilitated  instant dispatch of  the  most economical power. However, the \noverall  economic  benefits  in  cost  savings  through  more  efficient  dispatch  will  not  result  in \nany  additional  revenue  to  the  executing  agency,  but  justifies  an  increase  of  the  wheeling \ncharges  for  transmission  to  cover  the  additional  investment  and  operational  costs.  In \nachieving a  return  of  at  least  10.0%,  an  increase  of  0.027Tk/kWh  in  transmission  charges \nduring  2008,  the  first  revenue  generation  year,  has  been  assumed.  FIRR  has  been \ncalculated with nil residual value. The FIRR calculations for the national load dispatch center \nare given in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \n \n\nDistribution \n\n3. \n\n6. \nThis component covers the transfer of urban distribution in the northwest zone to a \nnew North-west Zone Power Distribution Company, which will take over the distribution of 10 \ntowns, namely Bogra, Dinajpur, Joypurhat, Rajshahi, Rangpur, Pabna Serajgonj, Nilphamari, \nGaibanda, and Thakurgaon. It will include the transfer of assets, liabilities, and personnel in \nrespect of these towns to the new company. At present in these towns, power is distributed \nby BPDB. \n\n7. \nThe  losses  in  the  distribution  sector  due  to  insufficient  and  poor  control  over  billing \nand  improper  records  are  the  major  area  of  consideration.  At  present,  the  average  total \n\n\f \n48\n\nAppendix 10 \n\nlosses in the distribution grid for the 10 towns, excluding the palli bidyut samity (rural electric \ncooperatives,  PBSs),  worked  out  at  26%  approximately.  Under  this  Program,  with \ncomputerization  of  the  distribution  operations,  and  with  a  new  company  culture,  the \ndistribution  losses  are  expected  to  gradually  come  down  to  15%  in  the  first  5  years  after \nimplementation  of  the  Program.  The  collection  ratio  should  also  improve  to  add  to  the \nrevenue  potential  of  the  Program.  The  collection  ratio  is  anticipated  to  improve  from  85% \npresently to 98% by the end of 2007. \n\n8. \nBesides  the  above  potential  source  of  revenue  generation,  additional  sales  of \nelectricity  to  existing  and  new  consumers  will  be  a  major  source  of  revenue.  The  demand \nprojections  for  the  coming  years  have  been  made  keeping  in  view  the  current  coverage  in \nthese towns, and the growth trend of demand for power in Bangladesh. The revenue stream \nwas  estimated  using  these  demand  projections  and  respective  tariff  rates  for  various \ncategories  of  consumers.  For  estimating  the  revenue  stream,  the  distribution to  the PBSs \nunder the Rural Electrification Board has not been considered. No tariff increase is assumed \nin the analysis. Operation, maintenance, and administrative costs have been taken as 5.0% \nof the capital investment. \n\n9. \nThe  FIRR  has  been  calculated  for  a  period  of  20  years  including  4  years  of \nconstruction. In calculating the FIRR, no residual value has been considered. The calculated \nFIRR is 26.6% as given in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \nB. \n\nWeighted Average Cost of Capital \n\n10. \nThe weighted average cost of capital (WACC) has been calculated in real terms for \neach  component  as  well  as  for  the  consolidated  investment.  Loans  from  the  ordinary \ncapital resources of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and from the Nordic Development \nFund (NDF) will be extended to the Government and an onlending interest rate of 5.0% per \nannum from the Government to the executing agencies has been taken for calculation of \nWACC, while the rate of interest for the local currency loan through commercial bonds in \nthe  case  of  the  national  load  dispatch  center  has  been  taken  as  11.0%  per  annum.  An \nincome  tax  rate  of  40.0%  per  annum  has  been  considered  for  calculations.  The  inflation \nrates  considered  are  2.4%  and  4.5%  for  foreign  currency  and  local  currency  loans \nrespectively. The return for the long-term capital contribution as equity has been taken as \n15.0%. \n\n11. \nOn  the  basis  of  the  above,  the  WACC  has  been  worked  out  to  be  4.63%  in the \ncase of the peak load power plant, 4.23% in respect of the national load dispatch center, \nand  4.81%  in  the  case  of  the  distribution  component.  The  consolidated  weighted  cost  of \ncapital is worked out to be 4.55%. \n\nC. \n\nSensitivity Analysis \n\n12. \nscenarios.  \n\nTable  A13  gives  the  result  of  the  sensitivity  analyses  of  the  FIRRs  under  various \n\n\fAppendix 10   \n\n 49\n\nTable A10: Sensitivity Analyses (%) \n\nDistribution \n26.6 \n\nNational Load \nDispatch \nCenter \n10.6 \n\nPeak Load \nPower \nStation \n10.0 \n\n9.7 \n\n10.5 \n\n6.5 \n\n9.6 \n\n9.4 \n\n8.9 \n\n9.9 \n\n8.9 \n\n8.4 \n\n8.3 \n\nTotal \n14.3 \n\n12.7 \n\n14.1 \n\n12.9 \n\n12.6 \n\n11.7 \n\n \n\n23.7 \n\n26.0 \n\n21.5 \n\n23.2 \n\n18.6 \n\nScenario \n1.

(PGCB),  and  partially  other  power  sector \nentities. \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n2. \nAll these components of the Program will result in increased and more efficient supply of \nelectricity  to  consumers.  For  this  Program,  the  economic  analysis  has  been  carried  out  for \ncomponents (i), (ii), and (iii). As component (iv) is financial restructuring of DESCO, PGCB, and \nother power sector entities, financed through a program loan, it has not been considered in the \neconomic analysis.  \n \n3. \nWhen an investment is made as a package for creating a generation, transmission, and \ndistribution  network,  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  on  the  investment  made  is \nnormally  considered  representative  of  the  rate  of  return  on  the  transmission  and  distribution \ninvestments, as they are typically only a part of the total investment. But this program includes \ninvestments in three quite independent components, i.e., a distribution network in 10 towns, an \nNLDC,  and  a  peak  load  power  plant.  Keeping  in  view  the  standalone  nature  of  these \ninvestments in the context of the existing power sector in Bangladesh, the economic analysis for \nthe three components was carried out separately. \n \nFor  the  purposes  of  economic  analysis,  the  estimated  capital  costs  of  the  three \n4. \ncomponents1  were  broken  down  into  tradable  and  nontradable  goods  and  services.  All  cost \nelements were valued at border price numeraire,2 using a domestic currency with all taxes and \nduties  excluded,  a  standard  conversion  factor  of  0.855  for  nontraded  items,  and  a  labor \nconversion  factor  of  0.8  for  unskilled  labor  and  1.1  for  skilled  labor.  Operating  costs  were \ncalculated as a fixed percentage of the economic investment cost, using 5% for the distribution \ncomponent, 1.5% for the peak load power plant, and 1% for the NLDC.  \n \nOn  the  cost  side,  the  economic  valuation  of  the  distribution  component  includes \n5. \neconomic send-out  costs  of  power.  The  economic  cost  of  importing  power  for  the  distribution \nsystem in these 10 towns has been valued at the long-run marginal cost of generation plus the \n\n                                                 \n1  The  peak  load  power  plant  at  Siddhirganj  has  been  planned  to  be  built  at  the  existing  site  of  an  obsolete  power \nplant. Therefore, the costs on account of transmission lines, land, and resettlement will not arise and are thus not \nincluded  in  the  capital  cost  component.  Taxes,  duties,  and  interest  during  construction  are  also  excluded,  while \nphysical contingency is included in the financial capital cost, to arrive at the economic capital cost. \n\n2  In order to bring all resource effects to a common basis so that they can be aggregated into an estimate of project \nnet benefits, domestic price numeraire has been used. This procedure has been assumed to be most suitable \nbecause a significant part of project capital and other input costs as well as project benefits are of a nontraded \nnature. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11   \n\n \n51\n\nwheeling  charges  for  transmission.  As  economic  analysis  of  the  distribution  components \nconsiders it a standalone investment, to reflect the economic benefits that arise solely because \nof investment in this component, wheeling charges for transmission of electricity for distribution \nhave been considered as part of the economic cost of electricity to the distribution system.  \n \n6. \nA  period  of  20  years  was  considered  for  economic  analysis  of  distribution  and  NLDC \ncomponents, while in the case of the peak load power plant, its life being 15 years with 2 years \nof construction, the analysis period was also taken as 17 years. \n \nB.  \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return \n \n1.  \n\nPeak Load Power Plant \n\n \n7. \nIn  the  case  of  the  peak  load  power  plant,  the  economic  value  of  total  generated \nelectricity valued on the basis of cost of alternative sources of energy net of transmission and \ndistribution  losses  has  been  considered  in  the  economic  analysis.  Valuation  was  done \nconsidering the proportionate shares of various categories of consumers that will consume the \noutput  of  this  plant  and  the  cost  of  representative  alternative  fuels 3  for  these  categories, \nrespectively. The calculated EIRR is 20.2% as presented in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n\nNational Load Dispatch Center \n\n2.  \n \n8. \nThe investment in the NLDC will result in savings in fuel and other operational costs of \ngenerating  power  because  of  facilitated  instant  dispatch  of  the  most  economical  power.  Such \nsavings  will  not  be  reflected  in  the  economic  benefits  estimated  for  various  categories  of \nconsumers, as the power tariff is regulated and does not get adjusted automatically to account \nfor  the  additional  cost  of  peak  load  power  generation.  Therefore,  these  savings  in  generation \ncosts  arising  because  of  NLDC  have  been  considered  as  economic  benefits.  These  were \nestimated  to  be  2.0%  of  total  electricity  consumption  in  Bangladesh.  The  calculated  EIRR  is \n24.0% as presented in Supplementary Appendix G. \n  \n\n3.  \n\nDistribution in 10 Towns \n\n \n9. \nThe  economic  analysis  for  the  distribution  component  compares  the  economic  benefits \narising  on  account  of  consumption  of  increased  and  efficient  supply  of  electricity  by  three \ncategories  of  consumers,  i.e.,  domestic,  commercial,  and  industrial,  with  the  total  capital \ninvestment proposed for the system. As agricultural consumers are small in number in these 10 \ntowns, they have been put with the commercial category for simplifying calculations. The PBSs \nunder the Rural Electrification Board (REB) as a bulk consumer in the towns has been excluded \n                                                 \n3  As  the  project  output  in  the  case  of  the  peak  load  power  plant  will  be  of  a  nonincremental  nature,  where  it  will \nsubstitute  for  alternative  forms  of  supply,  the  shadow  price  is  in  terms  of  alternative  sources  of  energy.  Further, \nwhen load is shed during peak periods, in all likelihood consumers shift to alternative sources of energy. The logic \nmay run as follows: (i) when load is shed, the immediate decision facing the consumers is whether go without or \nthink  for  alternatives;  (ii) rational  behavior  on  part  of  consumers  means  looking  for  alternatives.  They  have  two \nchoices \u2014either  switch  to  alternative  fuel  during  hours  of  load  shedding  or  shift  consumption  to  off-peak periods. \nMost  likely,  they  will  switch  to  alternative  fuel  for  two  reasons.  First,  there  will  be  no  incentive  for  deferred \nconsumption as such shifting will not be a saving that can be consumed in future to enhance welfare. Second, it is \nnot  possible  to  shift  total  consumption  of  \u201cload  shedding  hours\u201d  to  off-peak  periods  because  certain  uses  of \nelectricity  are  continuous  or  hour-specific  in  a  day;  for  example  continuous  running  of  a  refrigerator  or  use  of  an \nelectric bulb during the night; (iii) the implication of the above postulates is that consumers are most likely to switch \nto alternative sources and thus the valuation of economic benefits in terms of alternative sources of energy is quite \njustified. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n52\n\nAppendix 11 \n\nfrom  the  respective  totals  for  these  towns  for  two  reasons.  First,  in  the  future,  Bangladesh \nPower Development Board itself is supposed to supply electricity directly to REBs; second, it is \ndone  to  realistically  estimate  the  savings  in  town  distribution  losses  to  their  own  customers  in \nthe ten towns only. \n \n10. \nEconomic benefits arising out of reduced distribution losses in terms of electricity saved \nvalued  at  its  long-run  marginal  cost  of  generation  have  been  considered.  Economic  benefits \narising out of the investment in the distribution network in the 10 towns have been calculated as \nincremental and nonincremental separately. Incremental benefits are assumed to appear for two \nreasons.  First,  on  account  of  normal  average  increases  in  consumption  by  the  existing \nconsumers  during  the  same  number  of  hours  of  supply  as  today;  and  second,  on  account  of \nreduced  load  shedding  and  breakdowns  resulting  in  more  hours  of  electricity  supply.  It  is \nexpected  that  reduced  load  shedding  will  motivate  consumers  to  buy  and  use  more  sensitive \nelectrical  appliances,  such  as  refrigerators  (domestic  consumers)  and  production  equipment \n(industrial  consumers).  However,  economic  benefits  arising  out  of  increased  demand  for  such \nequipment  and  likely  growth  in  an  electric  consumer  durables  industry  have  not  been \nconsidered.  \n \n11. \nIncremental consumption was valued by estimating the consumer\u2019s willingness to pay for \nincremental  electricity  supply  and  adding  the  related  consumer  surplus  benefits  to  the  tariff-\nbased  revenues.  Nonincremental  benefits  were  valued  in  terms  of  res ource  cost  savings  by \nconsidering  the  cost  of  representative  alternative  sources  of  energy.  Costs  of  alternative \nsources of power used by three categories of consumers were estimated. The dominant source \nof alternative energy in domestic sector is assumed  to be kerosene, while for commercial and \nindustrial  consumers,  alternative  sources  of  energy  are  assumed  to  be  inverter  batteries  and \ndiesel generator sets, respectively.  \n \n12. \nFor reasons of convenience, usually, the relevant demand curve segment  is treated as \nlinear to simplify the calculations. However, to reflect the demand price elasticity for the various \ncategories  of  consumers  in  the  evaluation,  only  a  portion  of  the  maximum  consumer  surplus \nbenefits  is  assumed  for  the  valuation  of  incremental  sales.  However,  keeping  in  view  the \nsubstantial  quantum  of  economic  benefits  and  thus  robustness  of  the  Project,  the  consumer \nsurplus was not included in the economic benefits. The calculated EIRR is 38.7% as presented \nin Supplementary Appendix G. \n \nC. \n \n13. \nrobust.

Sensitivity  of  EIRR  to  changes  in  the \ncurvature  factor  for  the  different  categories  of  consumers  as  well  as  for  changes  of  fuel  input \nprices for selected captive generation did not lead to a significant deterioration in the EIRR.

In 2000, nationally, \n12%  of  the  poorest  households  had  electricity  connections,  3%  rural  and  46%  urban.  Those  who  have \naccess  to  electricity  receive  poor,  unreliable  services  with  regular  power  outages  and  low  voltage. \nImproved  energy  services  are  essential  for  the  country\u2019s  economic  growth  and  other  social  services. \nEfficient power supply is essential for the manufacturing and service industry, particularly the micro and \nsmall  industries  including  the  garment  sector  which  employs  several  million  poor,  particularly  poor \nwomen.  Agricultural  production  is  also  dependent  on  energy,  especially  electricity.  Energy  efficiency \nbeyond  Dhaka  is  necessary  if  GOB  is  to  meet  its  objectives  to  decentralize  development  away  from \nDhaka  to  secondary  towns  as  well  as  develop  rural  infrastructure.  Bangladesh  has  one  of  the  highest \npaces  of  urbanization  among  developing  countries.  The  rural-urban  pull  is  resulting  in  increased \nmigration into Dhaka city.  \n \nUrbanization  has  contributed  to  the  reduction  in  national  poverty.  For  instance,  during  the  period \n1983/84  and  1991/92  there  was  a  5%  reduction  in  the  national  head-count index. Dhaka city however \ncannot  be  the  sole  hub  that  attracts  rural  migrants.  Electricity  has  been  instrumental  in  creating \nemployment opportunities for the poor in the rural and urban areas \n \nThe ongoing multi-donor support to GOB\u2019s Power Sector Reform is an indication of the importance GOB \nplaces on the sector\u2019s contribution to national development. \n \nB. \n \nThe  first  block  of  domestic  power  consumption  100  KWh  per  month  is  subsidized  in  Bangladesh.  In  the \nfinancial  year  2002  the  highest  electricity  consumption  was  in  the  residential  category.  Renovation, \nupgrading and extension of distribution networks will be implemented in ten towns of Rajshahi, Serajgonj, \nBogra, Pabna, Rangpur, Dinajpur, Joypurhat, Thakurgaon, Nilphamari and Gaibanda in the northwest. In \neight  of  the  ten  towns,  the  average  domestic  power  consumption  was  less  than  100  units  in  February \n2003  indicating  that  poor  consumers  constitute  the  biggest  user  category.  Similar  to  the  Dhaka  Power \nTransmission and Distribution Project, the project can be expected to have indirect benefits on the lives of \npoor  people  who  use  small  amounts  of  electricity  and  women  who  engage  in  micro-level  production \nactivities  (Greater  Dhaka  Power  Transmission  and  Distribution  Project  Phases  II  and  II  A,  Evaluation \nReport/EV550-1994). In all towns, domestic consumers followed by commercial and industrial customers \nare  the  main  users.  In  the  commercial  category,  in  six  of  the  ten  towns,  average  consumption  was  less \nthan  100  units  and  in  two  were  less  than  120  units  indicating  that  small  shops  and  business  ventures \nformed the largest group of consumers in this category. \n \nWhile the policy and investment components are not designed to have poverty impacts, they are likely to \nresult  in  indirect  positive  impacts  on  the  poor  in  terms  of  income  and  employment,  and  public  services \nsuch  as  health,  education  and  municipal  services.  At  least  170,000  new  meter  connections  will  be \nprovided to domestic and commercial users, which is expected to benefit the poor households and micro \nlevel commercial units. A total of 3,500 new connections for industrial consumers and one new 11/kv sub-\nstation in each town will be established to improve quality of supply. In addition, replacement meters will \nbe  provided  to  all  consumer  categories.  These  demands  are  based  on  projected  load  demand  for  a \nfifteen-year period to service the needs of the towns until the year 2020. According to BPDB, the following \n\n Classification: Other  \n\nPoverty Analysis   \n\n\f \n60\n\nAppendix 13 \n\nkey improvements are expected (i) all consumers will receive uninterrupted, improved electricity supply (ii) \ncommercial and industrial operations will be uninterrupted (iii) low voltage problems which are particularly \ndamaging to remote rural areas will improve and (iv) replacing old lines with insulation will improve safety. \nThe benefits will be in terms of employment, income, better supply of essential services like water, street \nlights,  diagnostic  and  health  services  and  cost  saving  for  energy  and  maintenance  of  equipments  with \nbetter supply of power. \n \nOn  the  policy  side,  improved  governance  which  includes,  streamlining  financial  operations,  billing \narrangements  and  corporatizing  BPDB  will  result  in  better  service  to  the  public.  The  establishment  of  an \nindependent  regulator  will  result  in  transparent  and  consultative  procedures  for  issuing  tariff  rulings  and \ndistribution  services.  Possible  reduction  in  costs  of  products  can  be  expected  from  price  rationalization \nand efficiency gains. Employees will benefit from a new management structure and skills training.  \n \nOn the investment side, the new peak power generation unit to be established at Siddhirganj will provide \nregular  and  improved  energy  supply  to  the  city  of  Dhaka.  Considerable  environment  benefits,  cost \nsavings  on  stand  by  generators  and  improved  efficiency  in  the  manufacturing  business,  including \ngarments,  pharmaceuticals  and  electronics  will  result  from  the  new  plant.  All  categories  of  workers  and \nparticularly  those  in  the  ready-made  garment  industries  are  likely  to  benefit  from  better  working \nenvironments and reduced hours of work. \n \nThe  structure  of  the  northwest  regional  economy  is  mostly  agricultural  with  industry  limited  to  agro \nprocessing and production for local markets. Value added from Government consumption activity is 11% \nin  the  region  compared  to  8%  in  Bangladesh  as  a  whole.  Pabna,  and  Bogra  have  a  larger  share  of \nindustry  (manufacturing  plus  construction),  Also  a  few  large-scale  industries  are  situated  in  the  area. \nSome service units serve the rural producers. For example, Rajshahi has 32 cold storage facilities which \nstore  agricultural  products  of  poor  farmers,  power  outages up to eight hours cause serious loss to both \ngroups.  The  owners  have  to  spend  about  60%  higher  for  stand  by  generators  to  protect  their  business. \nRajshahi  is  also  the  divisional  headquarters  with  government  offices  and  many  educational  institutions \nincluding  a  university.  Sirajganj  and  Pabna  have  many  power  and  handloom  weaving  and  twisting \nfactories  and  provide  employment  for  the  poor.  The  largest  consumer  category  are  households. \nConsumer  consultations  indicate  that  the  quality  of  the  distribution  network and low maintenance often \ncause power disruption, particularly during the summer months and during storms, almost all seven towns \nexperience disruption to the network. During the irrigation season overloading during peak hours causes \npower outages that affect all consumers.  \n \nUnstable  power  supply  and  peak  period  power  cuts  have  effects  on  peoples\u2019  lives  in  various  ways.  Poor \nand  particularly  women  who  work  as  front  line  workers  on  a  piece  basis  are  severely  affected  by  power \nloss. Low income, long  working  hours  and  sometimes  bringing  in  children  to  make  up  lost  hours  is  the \nresult  of  unstable  power  supply.  Many  electrical  items  brought  into  repair  shops  are  damaged  due  to \npower  interruption.  Small  business  units  such  as  photo  studios,  cyber  cafes,  beauty parlors, photocopy \nshops  all  complain  of  disruption  to  business  and  loss  of  income  during  the  peak  time.  Health  clinics  and \ndiagnostic services are also seriously disrupted as many units become non-operational due to low voltage \nor  have  a  shorter  service  life  because  of  constant  power  outage.  Patients  are  inconvenienced  by  having \nto wait long hours or have to return due to disruption of services. Municipal water supply, streetlights are \nalso of poor quality due to power disruption. \n \nBeneficiaries  expressed  the  need  for  regular  and  expanded  power  supply.  Perceived  benefits  from  an \nimproved  system  include,  increase  in  income  and  employment  through  stable  production  activities  in \nexisting and new units. Costs, time saving and production losses could be minimized by way of reducing \ndamage to household and production equipment.

Therefore,  no  initial  environmental \nexamination  (IEE)  has  been  prepared  for  this  investment  component.  The  investment \ncomponents  to  replace  the  old  generation  steam  plant  and  expansion  distribution  line  are \nclassified as B projects in accordance with the Guidelines on Environmental Assessment of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB). The IEE for these two investment components was prepared. \nThis appendix is based on the information in the IEE reports submitted by the Government. \n \n3. \nAccording to the Bangladesh\u2019s Environmental Preservation Rules 1997, the construction \nor improvement of power generation plant and replacement and expansion of power distribution \nlines fall under the \u201cred\u201d category. Any works for these types of projects can only be done after \nthe Department of Environment issues an environmental clearance. \n  \nB. \n \n4. \n \n\nThe investment components will involve the following activities: \n\nDescription of the Project \n\nNo \n\nInvestment Component \n\nLocation \n\nActivities \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\nReplacement of the old \nsteam power generation \nplant with the new gas \npower plant (open-cycle \nturbine) \n\nExpansion of distribution line \nin 10 towns (11 kV and 0.4 \nkV) \n\nSiddhirganj \npower plant \ncomplex, which is \nabout 30 km from \nDhaka  \n \n10 towns \nRajshahi, Bogra, \nRangpur, \nDinajpur, Pabna, \nJoypuhat, \nSerajgonj, \nThakurgaon, \nNilphamari, and \nGaibanda \n\nDismantling old machinery \nand old buildings \nConstructing the new gas-\nbased power plant, 2X100 \nmegawatts (MW)  \n \nReplacement of old wire of the \nexisting distribution lines \nEstablishment of new \ndistribution lines \nInstallment of new substations \nfor 11 kV/0.4 kV \nRenovation/improvement of the \nexisting substations  \n  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 16    69\n\nDescription of the Environment \n\nC. \n \n\n1. \n\n \n\nProject area involved in and affected by the replacement of old  \npower plant with the new gas power plant \n\n5. \nThe project area is located in Siddhirgonj Power Plant Complex of Naryanngonj District \nand situated 1.5 km east of Dhaka\u2013Chittagong Highway. This power plant complex is also part \nof Siddhirgonj Industrial Area. The site is flat, and it was land filled by riverbed dredging that was \ndone in the early 1970s. The existing steam power plant is one of the power plants located in \nthis  complex,  where  there  are  two  other  gas  and  steam  power  plants  inside  this  power  plant \ncomplex.  There  is  no  residential  area  near  to  the  complex.  No  cultural  artifacts  or  historical \nremains are in the vicinity (at radius 5 km). There is no environmentally sensitive area, however, \nthe  complex  is  located  about  1  km  from  Shitalaxma  river.  The  river  is  the  important  source  of \nwater for this industrial complex. \n   \n\n2. \n\nProject Area Involved In and Affected by Distribution Lines \n\n \n\n6. \nThe project area will spread all over northwest zone of Bangladesh. It involves 10 towns \nand  all  of  them  are  capital  districts,  therefore,  it  is  characterized  by  a  small-town  type  of \necosystem.  There  is  no  environmentally  sensitive  area  involved  in  this  subproject,  and  no \ncultural  artifacts  or  historical  remains  are  affected  by  the  Project.  All  the  substations  (existing \nand new) are not located nearby the residential area, and none of them is located near to any \nsocial infrastructures (e.g., clinic, school).  \n \nD. \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n1. \n\nReplacement of the Old Steam Power Generation Plant with the New Gas \nPower Plant (open-cycle turbine)  \n\n \n\n \n\n7. \nThere is no significant impact expected due to the site of the Project, since the project is \nlocated  within  the  power  plant  complex  belonging  to  BPDB.  The  existing  steam  power  plant, \nwhich was established in the early 1970s, is generating 50 MW of power, which is being used to \nserve Dhaka\u2019s demand.  \n \n8. \nThis investment component will not include any development of transmission line, since \nadequate transmission systems already are in place. Therefore, the main feature of the project \nactivities as part of construction work is dismantling of the existing building and machinery. The \nscrap  machinery  has  an  economic  value,  however,  this  machinery  has  been  used  for  a  long \ntime,  and  therefore  some  of  it  has  become  corrosive  and  most  of  it  contains  lubrication  oil  as \nwell  as  transformer  oil.  To  mitigate  any  environmental  impact  associated  with  the  used  scrap, \nthe  following  mitigation  measures  will  be  adopted:  (i)  all  the  old  machinery  will  be  washed,  to \nclean  its  oil  content,  inside  the  project  area.  Wastewater  from  washing  the  machinery  will  be \ndisposed of in the river after trapping its oil, and the oil contained in its wastewater should not \nexceed  the  Bangladesh  Effluent  Standard  (10  mg/l);  (ii)  the  waste  oil  will  only  be  disposed  or \nsold to the parties that are authorized by the Government to treat oil waste; and (iii) only clean \nscrap will be sold to the market. The disposal from dismantling the building will be used to fill up \nthe lower area inside the power plant complex.  \n \nThe  environmental  impacts  associated  with  the  construction  of  new  building  and \n9. \nmobilizing the new machinery are negligible and will only locally affect the project area, in fact \nonly within the power plant complex. There will be no dumping of construction materials outside \n\n\f \n70\n\nAppendix 16 \n\nthe power plant complex. Similarly, there will be no container or car parking outside the power \nplant complex, since the complex has adequate space for parking. However, traffic approaching \nthis project area will increase, and therefore, the proponent should work with the local authority \nto reroute the traffic if necessary. \n \n10. \nThe environmental impacts due to the operation of the plant is expected to be positive, \nbecause  the  new  plant  will  be  based  on  CNG,  which  will  be  supplied  by  already  existing \npipelines. No exhaust steam will be emitted. There will be no cooling wastewater to be disposed \nof  in  the  river.  The  use  of  natural  gas  for  power  generation  will  generate  very  little  material, \nwhich cannot burn, so no dust is emitted in the exhaust gases. The NOx emission has been the \nsubject  of  extensive  development  work  by  gas  turbine  manufacturing  and,  considering  the \nBangladesh  CNG,  it  is  expected  that  the  NOx  level  can  be  reduced  to  25  parts  per  million. \nTherefore, the new power plant will clearly contribute to improving Dhaka\u2019s air quality.   \n\n \n\n2. \n\nExpansion of Distribution Line \n\n  \nThe  screening  of  potential  impacts  identifies  that  there  will  be  no  significant \n11. \nenvironmental impact due to sitting of these distribution line and substation, because all these \nsubprojects will be carried out in the town area and mostly in the existing facilities and along the \nroads.  The  environmental  impacts  associated  with  the  construction  stage  will  mostly  involve \ntraffic disturbance. To minimize this impact, a clear traffic sign will be placed in the construction \narea and if necessary traffic will be rerouted. Good practices during the installation of cable or \ndistribution  line  will  be  adopted  and  will  be  included  in  the  bidding  document.  Therefore,  it  is \nclear  that  the  impacts  associated  with  the  rehabilitation  of  distribution  line  will  be  minimal  and \nthe mitigation measures will be manageable.  \n \n12. \nIt  is  predicted  also  that  there  will  be  an  environmental  impact  associated  with  the \nrehabilitation of the substation particularly related with the disposal of damaged equipment (e.g., \ntransformers,  conductors).  Unused  transformers  and  equipment  that  contain  Poly  Chlorinated \nBiphenyl (PCB) will be collected and cleaned prior to selling them or disposing of them on the \nmarket. The wastewater from cleaning of the equipment will be disposed of after treating them \nas  required  by  the  Government.  A  permit  to  sell,  dispose,  and  use  materials  containing  PCBs \nwill be processed by the Central Environmental Authority.  \n \n13. \nTo avoid future environmental problems, it is also recommended that the Project will only \nuse  (i)  PCB-free  transformers  and  conductors;  and  (ii)  chlorofluorocarbon  (CFC)-free cooling \nsystem equipment. To avoid noise problems, it is recommended to locate the transformers at a \nreasonable  distance  so  that  noise  level  from  the  fence  will  not  exceed  55  decibels  during  the \nday  and  45  decibels  during  the  night.  It  is  clear  that  the  proposed  mitigation  measures  are \npractical and manageable and all of these will be included in the loan covenants.  \n \nE. \n \n \n \n14. \nImplementation  of  mitigation  measures  during  the  construction  stage  will  be  the \nresponsibility  of  the  contractor.  The  construction  supervisors  from  the  Bangladesh  Power \nDevelopment Board (BPDB) will be responsible in preparing contract documentation so that the \nbidding  documents,  bills  of  quantity,  and  other  contractual  obligations  of  the  contractor clearly \nidentify environmental responsibilities and describe penalties for noncompliance. BPDB will also \nmonitor the waste oil as part of the effluent disposed outside the project area. BPDB will ensure \n\nInstitutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program \n\nInstitutional Framework and Responsibility \n\n1. \n\n\fAppendix 16    71\n\nthat scrap sold to other parties are oil free and the oil waste will be sold to authorized dealers. \nBPDB  is  responsible  for  implementing  overall  mitigation  measures  and  the  monitoring  plan, \nwhich  includes  collaboration  with  other  agencies  (e.g.,  Department  of  Explosives  for  testing \nexplosive materials and equipment for CNG storage, District and Municipal Traffic Enforcer for \nrerouting traffic during the construction stage, and Bangladesh Road and Transport Agency for \nmonitoring the movement of buses and auto rickshaws outside Dhaka).  \n \n\n2. \n\nEnvironmental M onitoring and Management Plan \n\n \n15. \nThe IEE has identified the generic monitoring and management program, which will be \npart of the mitigation on the adverse impacts, which mostly will become responsibility of BPDB. \nTherefore,  it  is  recommended  that  an  environmental  and  safety  unit  be  established  within  the \npower plant organization.  \n \n16. \n Environmental  monitoring  to  ensure  environmental  mitigation  measures  during  the \nconstruction stage will be carried out by BPDB. While the environmental monitoring to maintain \nenvironmental quality (e.g., effluent emission and other potential pollution such as disposing of \nhazardous and toxic units including oil, as well as noise) during construction and operation will \nbe  carried  out  by  Siddhirganj  Power  Com pany \nthe  Bangladesh \nEnvironmental  Conservation  Act  1995  and  Bangladesh  Conservation  Rules  1997  to  meet \nexisting government-prescribed environmental quality standards. \n \nF. \n \nThe IEE study shows that environmental impacts associated with this proposed Project \n17. \nare  manageable  and  can  be  mitigated.  While  the  positive  impact  particularly  in  improving  air \nquality  will  lead  to  reducing  the  threat  on  public  health.  In  addition,  none  of  environmentally \nsensitive  areas  will  be  involved  in  this  Project.  Therefore,  a  full  environmental  impact \nassessment to analyze further impacts is not required.
