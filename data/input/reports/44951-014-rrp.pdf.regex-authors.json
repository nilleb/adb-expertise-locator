I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nof up to $75 million to Summit Bibiyana II Power Company Limited (SBIIPCL) for the Bibiyana II \nGas Power Project in Bangladesh.1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n1.  Project Identification \n \n2.  In Bangladesh, about 62% of the population had access to electricity as of May 2014.2 \nMany industrial and commercial establishments depend on expensive and inefficient captive \npower generation (burning diesel or heavy oil) during power interruptions. Bangladesh faces the \nchallenge  of  increasing  access  to  electricity  and  removing  power-related  constraints  on \neconomic development. The government has embarked on a program of fast-track measures to \ndevelop power generation capacity, including developing new gas supply facilities and dual-fuel \nand coal-based power plants to generate 15 gigawatts of power capacity by 2016.3  \n3.  The consortium of Summit Industrial & Mercantile Corporation (Pvt.) Limited (SIMCL) \nand GE Energy (GEE) was awarded the Bibiyana II project in November 2010. After being \nformally awarded the project, the consortium approached ADB to discuss financing for the \nproject, given ADB\u2019s pioneering role and experience in financing the Meghnaghat gas power \nIPP project, one of the first major private sector IPP projects in Bangladesh, and its strong \nsupport for the power sector through sovereign lending. 4 \n \n2.  Project Design \n \n4.  The project involves design, engineering, construction, and operation of a 341 megawatt \n(MW) combined-cycle, gas-fired power plant to be located on the south bank of the Khushiyara \nRiver about 180 kilometers (km) northeast of Dhaka and 30 km southwest of the town of Sylhet \nin the district of Habiganj. The project comprises one combined-cycle equipment train and \nutilizes a single General Electric 9FA combustion turbine generator, coupled to a heat recovery \nsteam generator and a single steam turbine generator, as well as other plant and equipment. \nGas will be supplied to the project through an 8.8 km long, 50.8-centimeter high-pressure \npipeline from the existing Bibiyana gas field. Power will be evacuated from the power plant by \nmeans of 230 kilovolt (kV) or 400 kV transmission lines. \n \n3.  The Borrower and Sponsors \n \n5.  SBIIPCL is a joint venture between SIMCL (80% ownership) and GEE (20% ownership) \n(sponsors). \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources.

SIMCL is the holding company of the Summit Group and is owned by the group\u2019s \nfounder, Muhammed Aziz Khan, and his family. Since its establishment in 1972, the Summit \nGroup has diversified into  areas such as power generation,  trading, supplying furnace oil, \nshipping, storage, inland container depots and freight stations, infrastructure development, and \noptical fiber networks. The Summit Group is the first local IPP in Bangladesh and the leading \nlocal IPP, providing power to the national grid through its subsidiaries. The Summit Group \ncurrently operates 10 power projects with total generation capacity of 923 MW, which accounts \nfor around 9% of the total power capacity of Bangladesh as of August 2014. . \n \n7.  GEE was established in 2002 and is a wholly owned subsidiary of General Electric \nCompany, the parent company of the General Electric group, through BHA Group Incorporated, \na directly wholly owned subsidiary of General Electric. General Electric, established in 1892, is a \ndiversified technology, media,  and financial  services  company.  The  General  Electric group \nserves customers in more than 100 countries and operates through five segments: energy \ninfrastructure,  technology  infrastructure,  media  and  entertainment,  capital  finance,  and \nconsumer and industrial. Its energy infrastructure segment produces gas, steam, and aero \nderivative turbines; generators; combined-cycle systems; and renewable energy solutions, as \nwell as providing water treatment services and equipment. . \n \n \nB.  Development Impacts, Outcome, and Output \n \n1.  Impacts \n \n8.  The  project  will  help  alleviate  Bangladesh\u2019s  severe  power  shortage  that  adversely \nimpacts the country\u2019s economic growth and poverty reduction efforts. The project  has two \nimpacts (i) it will improve access to electricity in Bangladesh which will benefit households, \nbusiness, and industry and (ii) it will help increase investments by the private sector in power \ngeneration  in  Bangladesh.  Successful  implementation  of  the  project  will  foster  confidence \namong potential investors and lenders and will promote further private sector investments in \nBangladesh\u2019s energy sector, where few major IPPs of this size have materialized since early \n2000. \n \n2.  Outcome \n \n9.  The project outcome is increased combined cycle power generation. The project will \ndispatch around 2,500 gigawatt-hours of generated power annually and employ about 70 people \nduring operations.5 The project will install  a combined-cycle power plant  with low-carbon-\nemission technology.  \n \n3.  Output \n \n10.  The output is the construction and successful full-capacity commissioning of 341 MW \npower  plant  by  2016.  About  900  people  are  expected  to  be  employed  locally  during \nconstruction. Furthermore, an estimated $60 million of corporate income taxes are expected to \nbe paid to the government for the entire operating period. \n \n                                                \n5  ADB.2011. Manual for Calculating Energy Output Indicators. Manila ", "3 \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n \n11.  The  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020,  which \nemphasizes ADB\u2019s support for infrastructure projects that contribute to poverty reduction and \ninclusive growth through expansion of power supply.6 The strategy seeks to meet the region\u2019s \ngrowing energy demand by helping developing member countries to develop their economies \nusing environmentally friendly technologies. The strategy also aims to promote a larger role for \nthe private sector in financing infrastructure. \n \n12.  ADB\u2019s  support  for  the  project  is  in  line  with  its  country  partnership  strategy  for \nBangladesh, 2011\u201320157 and the government\u2019s Sixth Five-Year Plan, FY2011\u2013FY2015, both of \nwhich  emphasize  accelerating  growth  by  boosting  private  sector  investment.  The  country \npartnership  strategy  emphasizes  solving  the  power  supply  shortage  and  private  sector \ndevelopment in the power sector. The project will contribute to the reduction of the power supply \ngap, which is one of the most critical obstacles to private sector investment, and will improve the \ninvestment climate for private-sector-led growth and poverty reduction. \n \n2.  Consistency with Energy Sector Strategy \n \n13.  The project is in line with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, and is particularly consistent with one of \nthe three pillars of that policy\u2014maximizing access to energy for all.8 Access to modern and \nreliable energy services fosters sustainable human development, economic growth, a higher \nquality of life, and improved delivery of social services. The project will add generation capacity \nand  help  increase the reliability  of  electricity  supplies  in  a  country facing  a  severe  power \nshortage. Electricity supplied by the project will emit less greenhouse gases than the existing \nfurnace oil power plants or diesel power plants and will be sold at a comparable tariff to those of \nthe other gas power projects, and will not be directly affected by the volatility of the international \ngas market. \n \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  Table 3 summarizes the implementation arrangements.  \n \nTable 3: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nRegulatory  Pursuant to the implementation agreement between the government, PGCB, and SBIIPCL the \nframework  government gives direct support to the project with various commitments, including protection for \nthe project against the risk of changes in law and political force majeure and a guarantee of the \nrespective obligations of SBIIPCL\u2019s counterparties to the implementation agreement, PPA, LLA, \nand GSA (all as defined and described below). \nOther government commitments in the implementation agreement include assurances of support \nfor  government  authorizations;  various  tax  and  custom duties exemptions;  making dollars \navailable in Bangladesh; and the right to open and operate bank accounts and to transfer and \nrepatriate dollar funds. \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2014.

Energy Policy. Manila. \n ", "4 \n \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation  SBIIPCL entered into a 22-year take-or-pay PPA with BPDB, the state-owned utility company, \narrangements  as the off-taker. The tariff comprises capacity and energy payments which are adjusted to reflect \nchanges in natural gas price, the dollar exchange rate, and inflation. \nThe term of the GSA mirrors the PPA term. The gas supplier, JGTDSL, a wholly owned \nsubsidiary of Bangladesh Mineral Oil and Gas Corporation (Petrobangla), is liable to pay \nSBIIPCL liquidated damages if it fails to supply a minimum quantity of gas to the project. \nPGCB undertakes certain  obligations  in  the  implementation  agreement,  including  O&M  of \ninterconnection and transmission facilities for the evacuation of power from the project. \nUnder the LLA, BPDB grants SBIIPCL a lease of the project site for the term of the PPA. \n  As noted above, the government guarantees the obligations of the BPDB under the PPA and the \nLLA, the PGCB under the implementation agreement, and JGTDSL under the GSA. \nManagement  Summit Industrial & Mercantile Corporation (Pvt.) Limited is a pioneer in private sector power \ngeneration in Bangladesh.  \nConstruction period  The construction activities started in December 2012. It is anticipated that single-cycle operation \nwill start in March 2015 and combined-cycle operation in January 2016. \nConstruction arrangements \nConstruction  The EPC of the power plant will be executed under EPC contracts with a consortium of the \narrangements for   NEPC, and CEEC on a lump-sum and turnkey basis. The General Electric Company will supply \nthe power plant  a General Electric 9FA combustion turbine generator. \nSpare parts will be provided to SBIIPCL by GE Energy Parts pursuant to the Parts Supply and \nRepair  Work  Agreement  and  maintenance  services  will  be  provided  by  General  Electric \nInternational pursuant to the Maintenance Service Agreement. \nEPC contractors  CEEC is a state-owned large energy construction enterprise based in the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina owning 14 design institutes and 25 engineering companies. The NEPC is a fully owned \nsubsidiary of CEEC. It was founded in 1951 and has built more than 163 power plants and \ninstalled 242 generating units with total installed capacity of 41,607 megawatts.  \nConstruction  Power will be evacuated from the power plant by means of 230 kV or 400 kV transmission lines. \narrangements for  The 230 kV transmission lines already exist. \nthe transmission  SBIIPCL has entered into a separate construction contract for the construction of 400 kV \nlines and  switchyard bays and interconnecting transformer with Energypac Engineering Limited. \ninterconnection   \nfacilities \nOperation arrangements \nRevenue structure  All power generated from the project will be sold exclusively to the BPDB throughout the 22-year \nterm of the PPA. \nOperation and  O&M of the project will be outsourced. SBIIPCL will select an O&M operator with sufficient \nmaintenance  technical resources to satisfactorily perform the O&M services for the project. \nPerformance  Key performance indicators, including output and outcome indicators, compliance with ADB\u2018s \nmonitoring  safeguards requirements, financial performance, and compliance with financial covenants, will \nbe reported by SBIIPCL and monitored by ADB and other senior lenders. \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank;  BPDB  =  Bangladesh  Power  Development  Board;  CEEC  =  China  Energy \nEngineering Group Company; EPC = engineering, procurement, and construction; GSA = gas supply agreement; \nJGTDSL = Jalalabad Gas Transmission and Distribution System Limited; kV = kilovolt; LLA = land lease agreement;; \nNEPC = First Northeast Electric Power Engineering Company; O&M = operation and maintenance; PGCB = Power \nGrid Company of Bangladesh; PPA = power purchase agreement; SBIIPCL = Summit Bibiyana II Power Company \nLimited. \nSources: Summit Bibiyana II Power Company Limited and lenders\u2019 technical advisor. \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n15.  ADB will provide a secured loan of up to $75 million to SBIIPCL. The loan will have a \nterm of up to 14.5 years, including a grace period of up to 1.5 years.  \n ", "5 \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n16.  ADB\u2019s  active  participation  and  presence  in  the  project  will  provide  comfort  to  the \nsponsors that the government and government entities will continue to support the project in line \nwith the project agreements. Given ADB\u2019s track record and ongoing engagement with both the \ngovernment and private investors in the Bangladesh energy sector, including policy dialogue, \ntechnical assistance, sovereign loans, reform programs, and the past financing of a key private \nsector IPP project, investors particularly value ADB\u2019s role in mitigating risks, solving problems, \nand catalyzing financial resources to support private sector power projects in Bangladesh. \nMoreover,  ADB\u2019s contribution to  promoting  robust  safeguard  practices  and good  corporate \ngovernance will also add substantial value to the development and operation of the project. \n \n17.  ADB's assistance is considered important for the successful funding of the project as the \nlong-term financing that ADB will provide is largely unavailable from the commercial market and \nwill help ensure the project has a sound cash flow structure. The long-term financing for the \nproject helps amortize the capital expenditures across the economic life of the assets, and \nthereby enable the project to operate under the low tariff which will benefit consumers. \n \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n18.  The  project  is  classified  category  A  for  environment,  category  B  for  involuntary \nresettlement, and category C for indigenous peoples. The potential environmental and social \nimpacts of the project have been identified and disclosed on ADB\u2019s website in accordance with \nits Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and effective measures to mitigate the adverse impacts \nare incorporated in the safeguard reports and plans. SBIIPCL has developed an environment, \nhealth, safety, and social compliance audit  and a project site social compliance audit, each with \na corrective action plan, which were disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. SBIIPCL has committed to \nimplement the corrective action plan to fully comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \n19.  The  project  site  is  surrounded  by  farmland  without  any  environmentally  sensitive \nreceptors. Natural gas will be supplied from the Bibiyana gas field through an 8.8-km-long, 50.8-\ncentimeter,  high-pressure  pipeline  passing  through  paddy  fields.  The  electricity  will  be \nevacuated to the national grid through existing 230 kV transmission lines or 400 kV transmission \nlines being built through a substation next to the power plant. A 2-km-long paved access road is \nbeing built to connect the project to the Dhaka\u2013Sylhet N2 highway. The environmental impact \nassessment  predicts that air pollutant concentrations, such as nitrogen oxide and effluents to \nbe discharged to the nearby Kushiyara River, will meet internationally recognized standards. An \nenvironmental management plan has been developed including monitoring plan, implementation \narrangements, and budget. SBIIPCL has committed to the implementation of the environmental \nmanagement plan. \n \n20.  Four  and  a  half  hectares  of  agricultural  land  were  acquired  in  June  2011  by  the \nBangladesh Power Development Board for the project. There was no physical displacement \ninvolved  as  the  majority  of  the  land  acquired  had  been  used  for  paddy  cultivation  by  14 \nlandowners (affecting the livelihoods of about 120 people) in Parkul village. There were 6 share \ncroppers and 11 agricultural laborers affected by the project. There are no indigenous peoples \nin the project area. ADB considers that SBIIPCL has the institutional capacity and commitment \nto manage the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts. \n ", "6 \n \n \n21.  SBIIPCL  will  comply  with  national  labor  laws  and  take  measures  to  conform  with \ninternationally recognized core labor standards in compliance with ADB\u2019s Social Protection \nStrategy.9 Information  disclosure  and  consultations  with  affected  people  are  required  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s requirements and have been complied with.  The project is categorized \nas having no gender elements. Because of the nature of jobs available and working conditions \nat the construction site, employment opportunities for women are limited. However, SBIIPCL will \nensure that women\u2019s needs are considered in the identification of development activities for the \nlocal community. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n22.  SBIIPCL was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating \nto combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \n \nC.  Assurances \n \n23.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment of Bangladesh will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed \nassistance  to  SBIIPCL.  ADB  will  enter  into  suitable  finance  documentation,  in  form  and \nsubstance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed assistance by the ADB Board \nof Directors. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n24.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan of up to \n$75,000,000 to Summit Bibiyana II Power Company Limited for the Bibiyana II Gas Power \nProject in Bangladesh from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with such terms and conditions as \nare substantially in accordance with those set forth in this report, and as may be reported to the \nBoard. \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n12 November 2014 \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2003.
