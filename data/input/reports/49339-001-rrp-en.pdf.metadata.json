The transaction involves (i) a loan of up to $2 million from the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) ordinary capital resources (OCR); and (ii) the administration of \na loan of up to $1 million to be provided by the Canadian Climate Fund for the Private Sector in \nAsia under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility to Jarcon Pty Limited and Sun Pacific \nEnergy Limited (SPEL) for the Solar Power Development Project in Samoa. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nProject Identification and Description \n\n1. \n\nProject History and Status \n\nThe proposed financing of up to $3 million will expand an existing 2.2-megawatt (MW)1 \n2. \nsolar farm that has been in partial operation since April 2015.2 The existing facility was completed \nin  December  2015.  The  project  sponsor  has  already  invested  about  $3.5  million  for  the \nconstruction of the existing solar farm. The total project cost is estimated at $7 million. \n \nSPEL,  the  independent  power  producer  (IPP)  sells  power  to  the  Electric  Power \n3. \nCorporation (EPC), Samoa\u2019s state-owned power utility and the sole offtaker of the project. The \npower is sold under a 20-year power purchase agreement (PPA) that was signed in June 2015. \nAn addendum to the PPA is expected to be signed in July 2017 to increase the offtaking output \nfrom 3.5 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) a year to 6.1 million kWh per year. 3  \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Rationale \n\nIncreased access to and affordability of solar power. The proposed project will help \n4. \nthe  country  lower  its  dependence  on  fossil  fuels  and  increase  affordability  of  solar  power \ngeneration. Although endowed with abundant solar resources,4 Samoa is heavily dependent on \nimported fuel. In 2012, 95 million liters of diesel were imported for power generation to meet the \ndemand of a 98% electrification rate. Of the total nationwide installed capacity of approximately \n42 MW, over 30 MW is diesel fueled. \n \n5. \nSince  2010,  the  Government  of  Samoa  has  promoted  private  sector  participation  to \nincrease  renewable  energy  investment.  There  are  currently  three  solar  IPPs  operating  in  the \ncountry, including SPEL. The other two IPPs are backed by larger international sponsors who are \nfunding  the  projects  entirely  by  equity, resulting  in  higher project  costs  driven  by  the  expected \nequity  returns.  SPEL  is  currently  the  most  affordable  IPP. 5 Given  that  the  IPP  tariff  is  passed \nthrough to the consumers, an expansion of SPEL\u2019s existing operation will improve affordability. \n \n                                                 \n1  The solar farm\u2019s capacity will be expanded to a total of 4 MW (alternating current). \n2  The first stage (500 kilowatts) of the system started operation in April 2015. The system was developed modularly \n\nup to a capacity of 2.2 MW while generating revenues. \n\n3  The addendum, inclusive of a new tariff, has been approved by the Office of the Regulator. \n4  The International Renewable Energy Agency estimates that Samoa has a daily average insolation of over 5.0 kWh \nper square meter (with relatively small seasonal variation). This is a promising insolation for both utility scale and \nhousehold solar power systems. International Renewable Energy Agency. 2013. Renewable energy opportunities \nand challenges in the Pacific Islands region: Samoa. Abu Dhabi. \n\n5  Sector Overview (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n\n \n\n\f2\n\n \n\nEnhanced  power  system  resilience.  Samoa\u2019s  hydropower  systems  make  a  useful \n6. \ncontribution to  the  country\u2019s  power  mix,  but they  are  exposed  to  natural disasters  and  climatic \nvariability. They are also old manual systems, controlled by a series of hand-turned valves, and \nthus are not easily integrated into the national grid. The country\u2019s 12 MW hydropower capacity \nhas been adversely affected by past natural disasters such as the damage caused by Cyclone \nEvan in 2012. Hydropower generation is also exposed to seasonal volatility and drought. While \nup  to  50%  of  Upolu\u2019s  power  can  be  generated  by  existing  hydropower  plants,  hydropower \ngeneration only meets 19% of demand during the dry season.6 Solar power, on the other hand, \nis well suited for the dry season, when hydro resources are low and the weather is less cloudy. In \naddition,  the  solar  system  structural  design  has  adopted  international  standards  (e.g.,  the \nAustralian standard AS 4040.3, which considers resistance to wind pressures for cyclone regions) \nthat will help improve the overall resilience to extreme weather events of Samoa\u2019s power system. \n \n7. \nAccess to long-term credit. Accessing long-term credit in the Pacific island countries is \ndifficult  for  local  entrepreneurs.  The  lack  of  long-term  credit  is  particularly  harmful  for  the \ndevelopment  of  infrastructure  that  typically  requires  high  up-front  capital  costs  and  revenues \nspread over a long period. The project is the first renewable energy project that is being developed \nas an IPP in Samoa that is seeking debt financing. Despite having funded over 50% of the project \ncost, the borrowers are experiencing difficulties in obtaining credit from local and regional banks. \nADB assistance will contribute to ease access to credit and support private sector participation in \nthe energy sector. \n \n\n3. \n\nBorrowers and Sponsors \n\nThe recipients of the loan are two co-borrowers: Jarcon and SPEL. Jarcon is incorporated \n8. \nin New South Wales, Australia, while SPEL is a Samoan company. Both companies are family \nowned  and  have  the  same  ownership  structure.  Integrity  due  diligence  was  conducted  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Integrity  Due  Diligence  Guidelines  for  Nonsovereign  Operations.7 No \nsignificant or potentially significant integrity risks were identified.8 \n \n9. \nSPEL  is  the  owner  of  the  Samoan  solar  farm.  In  2016,  the  asset  was  valued  at \napproximately ST7.0 million. The Upolu solar farm was entirely funded through equity in the form \nof a loan from Jarcon to SPEL used to purchase equipment and services for the construction of \nthe existing facility.9 \n \n10.  While Jarcon is not formally SPEL\u2019s parent company, given Jarcon\u2019s role as financier and \ncommon ownership structure, Jarcon acts as co-borrower with SPEL.  \n \nB. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\nImpact. The impact will be increased availability, affordability, safety, and environmental \n\n11. \nimpacts of energy generation in line with the Government of Samoa\u2019s policy goal.10 \n\n                                                 \n6  In November 2015, ADB approved a sovereign grant to provide resources for EPC to rehabilitate and reconnect to \nthe grid 4.69 MW of hydropower capacity.

However, the loan from Jarcon would be \n\nsubordinated to ADB\u2019s loan once the project is approved. \n\n10 Government of Samoa, Ministry of Finance. 2012. Samoa Energy Sector Plan 2012\u20132016. Apia. \n\n\f \n\n3\n\n \n12. \nOutcome.  The  outcome  will  be  an  increased  supply  of  clean,  carbon-negative  solar \nenergy generated by an IPP. The project will generate an estimated 5.5 gigawatt-hours of solar \npower annually for 20 years. The estimated carbon emissions will be reduced by 1,644 tons of \ncarbon dioxide equivalent per year. \n \n13. \nOutput. The project output will be the installation of up to 4 MW of solar power generation, \nowned and operated by an IPP. This will be a milestone achievement in the Pacific region, where \nprivate sector developers are hesitant to take country and regulatory risks, and struggle to access \nlong-term credit when they do take these risks. \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n14. \nConsistency  with  ADB  strategy  and  country  strategy.  The  project  supports \ninfrastructure and environment, two of ADB\u2019s five core operational areas, and is consistent with \nADB's Midterm Review of Strategy 202011 as well as ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach, which is used as \nSamoa\u2019s country partnership strategy.12 As highlighted in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan \nfor Samoa, 2017\u20132019,13 ADB\u2019s past support was centered on the energy sector and has helped \nthe country improve electricity services as well as strengthen the resilience of renewable energy \npower generation against disasters caused by natural hazards. The project is also aligned with \nSamoa\u2019s Energy Sector Plan, 2012\u20132016. \n \n15. \nConsistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  project  is \nconsistent  with  ADB  Energy  Policy  in  promoting  access  to  clean  and  affordable  energy.14 The \nproject builds on ADB\u2019s sovereign operations in the energy sector in Samoa through the Power \nSector  Expansion  Project15 and  the  more  recent  Renewable  Energy  Development  and  Power \nSector  Rehabilitation  Project. 16  Both  projects  are  supporting  (i)  EPC\u2019s  assets  maintenance, \nrehabilitation,  and  expansion,  as  well  as  its  performance,  through  the  provision  of  a  project \nmanagement unit; and (ii) EPC\u2019s ability to increase renewable energy and provide battery energy \nstorage systems. In addition, the Asia Pacific Project Preparation Facility recently approved an \napplication  to  assist  Samoa\u2019s  Office  of  the  Regulator  in  setting  out  a  power  tariff  policy  and \nstrengthening the capacity of its electricity regulatory staff. The Asian Pacific Project Preparation \nFacility  is  also  considering  an  application from EPC  to  provide  assistance  and  prepare for the \noutsourcing of the operation and maintenance of generation, transmission, and distribution assets \nin Samoa. \n \nThe  project  also  exemplifies  the  \u201cOne  ADB\u201d  approach,  as  described  in  ADB\u2019s  Midterm \n16. \nReview  of  Strategy  2020.11  Past  sovereign  projects  in  Samoa  have  contributed  to  the \ndevelopment of an enabling environment for private sector participation through the development \nof the Office of the Regulator. ADB sovereign projects in Samoa have also supported EPC\u2019s grid \nand generation investments and institutional capacity, resulting in EPC\u2019s improved operations and \n\n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2014.

The \nOffice of the Regulator was established in 2006 to regulate telecommunication, and \nwas  also  appointed  the  regulator  of  the  power  sector  in  2010.  The  Office  of  the \nRegulator  has  the  power  to  license  utilities  and  approve  tariffs,  including  the  one \napplied by the Electric Power Corporation. \nSPEL was created with the sole purpose of owning the Samoan independent power \nproducer with the same structure as the Australian sister company (and co-borrower \nfor the project), Jarcon Pty Limited.  \nThe existing solar farm started partial operation in April 2015. SPEL has continued \nto  expand  the  facility,  which  had  a  capacity  of  2.2  MW  in  December  2016.  The \nconstruction of the expansion is scheduled to start in July 2017 and will be completed \nin 6 months. \nThe  construction  of  the  plant  is  entirely  managed  by  SPEL.  The  construction  is \nmodular. The latest progress report from the clients shows that the plant will reach \n2.5  MW capacity  at the  end  of  July  2017.  Orders  of solar panels  and inverters  to \nreach the expected 4 MW capacity are scheduled to reach Samoa by the end of July \n2017. \nSPEL oversees operation and maintenance of the system. Mr. Harrison visits Samoa \nregularly (at least once per quarter), and employs a certified electrician in Samoa for \ndaily operations and supervision. Some members of the neighboring community are \nemployed to provide system security and wash the panels regularly. \nKey  performance  indicators,  including  output  and  outcome  indicators,  will  be \nreported by SPEL every 6 months.  \n\nManagement \n\nImplementation period \n\nConstruction arrangements \n\nOperations arrangements \n\nPerformance monitoring \n\nMW = megawatt, SPEL = Sun Pacific Energy Limited. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nF. \n\nProjected Financial and Economic Performance \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n\n19. \n \n\n                                                 \n17 Details of Implementation Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\nIII. \n\nTHE ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nADB\u2019s proposed assistance will consist of: (i) a direct loan not exceeding $2 million; and \n20. \n(ii) a concessional loan funded by the Canadian Climate Fund for the Private Sector in Asia under \nADB\u2019s Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility, to be administered by ADB, not exceeding \n$1 million.  \n \n21. \nIn 2015, the Canadian Climate Fund for the Private Sector in Asia also provided small-\nscale  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  of  $225,000  to  cover  technical  and  legal  due \ndiligence costs of the project.18  \n \nB. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n22. \nThe  project  is  ADB\u2019s  first  private  sector  investment  in  support  of  an  IPP  for  renewable \nenergy in the Pacific region. The Government of Samoa has been at the forefront of promoting \nprivate sector participation for renewable energy generation. While there are currently three solar \nIPPs  operating  in  Samoa  (inclusive  of  the  one  that  the  project  is  supporting),  affordability  of \nrenewable energy remains an issue due to funding and structural issues of the other IPPs (para. \n5). This imposes a larger cost on Samoan consumers who, while committed to greener power \ngeneration, also cope with low income and limited employment opportunities. ADB\u2019s long-term \nloan  blended  with  concessional  funding  is  improving  the  affordability  of  renewable  power \ngeneration for all. \n \nC. \n\nRisks \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n\n23. \n \n24. \n \n25. \nNatural  disaster  risk.  Samoa  is  vulnerable  to  natural  disasters,  particularly  tropical \ncyclones  which  may  result  in  extreme  rain  events  and  flash  flooding.  This  risk  is  addressed \nthrough selection of climate-appropriate PV modules and inverters and incorporation of various \ndesign elements. However, there is limited historical rainfall and wind data from cyclone events \nto fully assess this risk.   \n \n26. \n \n27. \nCompletion risk. The project is already operational and completion risk for the expansion \nis low given the conventional design structure and the sponsor\u2019s technical expertise. However, \nthe construction process, including procurement and staff engagement, is managed informally. \nThis risk is mitigated to some extent by the technical advisor\u2019s validation that the existing facility \nis well-designed and engineered relative to other projects in the region and that the contractors \nand subcontractors have the required skills.  \n \n28. \n \n\n CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n\n                                                 \n18 ADB.  2015.

An environmental and social audit has been conducted for the existing facility, \nand an initial environmental examination report has been prepared for the 1.8 MW expansion of \nthe solar power station in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The environmental \nconstruction impacts are not significant and are mostly directly related to the construction process, \nsuch as elevation of noise level, generation of dust and wastewater, and health and safety risks. \nThese  are,  however,  localized  and  short-term  impacts,  as  construction  is  scheduled  to  be \ncompleted within 6 months. Additionally, these impacts can be mitigated through the adoption of \ngood  engineering  practices.  Notable  operational  impacts  include  potential  water  competition \nduring the dry season since the existing operations source cleaning water from the community. \nRainwater tanks will be installed to avoid this potential issue. Potential environmental and social \nimpacts of the project have been identified, and effective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, \nand compensate for the adverse impacts are incorporated in the safeguard reports and plans. \nThe  institutional  capacity  and  commitment  of  SPEL  to  manage  the  project\u2019s  social  and \nenvironmental impacts are deemed adequate. SPEL will submit annual environmental and social \nmonitoring reports to ADB. \n \n32. \nThe project will be an expansion of an existing solar farm and will not entail economic or \nphysical displacement. The project site was previously unused land in a secure complex within \nthe boundary of Faleolo International Airport. No communities have resided in the project area \nsince its acquisition in 1942 to build the airport. The expansion of the solar farm will be contained \nwithin the subleased area, and no additional land will be acquired. \n \n33. \nThe project is categorized as having no gender element. Measures to benefit women or \nfacilitate their participation in the project are limited due to the size of the operation and the short \nconstruction time frame.

The NSO country limit of 10% \nof gross domestic product, net of sovereign exposure, has been fully exhausted by concessional \nsovereign loans outstanding. As of the first quarter of 2017, total sovereign exposure was $99.4 \nmillion,21 $20.8 million above the $78.6 million that signifies 10% of 2016 gross domestic product. \nThis country limit was set prior to the transfer of Asian Development Fund lending operations to \nOCR, effective 1 January 2017. 22 Samoa\u2019s NSO limit was fully consumed at this point, essentially \nproviding no way for ADB to participate in NSO interventions in Samoa without a waiver. A waiver \nfrom ADB\u2019s Board of Directors will be sought in respect of this breach of the country exposure \nlimit. The Investment Committee supports this waiver. \n \n36. \n \nD. \n\nThe transaction remains within single borrower, group, and subsector limits. \n\nAssurances \n\nConsistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),23 \n37. \nADB will proceed with the assistance upon establishing that the Government of Samoa has no \nobjection  to  the  assistance  to  Jarcon  and  SPEL.
