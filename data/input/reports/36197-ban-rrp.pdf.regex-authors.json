This lack of confidence is traceable in large part to \nweak governance practices. Lack of market interest has in turn \nmarginalized the role of the capital market in mobilizing long-term \nfunds for economic development.  \n \nThe Improvement of Capital Market and Insurance Governance \nProject (the Project) will improve good governance practices in the \ncapital market and the insurance sector. The TA loan has two \nparts. Part 1 will enhance the governance and capacity of the \ncapital  market,  and  part  2  will  enhance  the  governance  and \ncapacity of the insurance sector. Part 1 will be targeted at the \nregulator, stock exchanges, market practitioners, and investors. It \nreflects a continuing effort by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nto  help  develop  the  domestic  market,  which  will  be  critical  if \nresources are to be mobilized to support private sector activity \nand promote economic growth. Part 2 will support Government-\nled  reforms  currently  being  pursued  in  the  insurance  sector, \nincluding the establishment of a new regulatory authority following \ninternational  best  practices.  These  twin  efforts  are  being \nundertaken  in  parallel  with  a  reform  program  aimed  at \nstrengthening  Bangladesh\u2019s  banking  sector  supported  by  the \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. \n   \nRationale  To reduce poverty and accelerate the pace of social development, \nthe  Government\u2019s  national  poverty  reduction  strategy  (NPRS) \naims to substantially increase private investment, savings, and \neconomic  growth.  Financial  sector  development\u2014generating \nmore financial resources and improving the efficiency of resource \nallocation by restoring investor confidence\u2014is critical to this goal. \nThe Government also recognizes that, to meet the NPRS targets, \nit needs to rely on the financial sector, and thereby develop an \nappropriate market and environment. Improving the practice of \ngood governance in all aspects of the financial system is essential \nto its development.  ", "ii   \n \nFor the capital market, weak governance and associated capacity \nare  considered  to  be  the  primary  causes  of  low  investor \nconfidence. While efforts to improve insurance sector governance \nhave also been initiated, the Government recognizes that much \nstill needs to be done. Accordingly, the Government asked for a \nTA loan to address urgent issues in the capital market and the \ninsurance sector, and in order to maintain the momentum in areas \nwhere reforms have been initiated. Successful implementation of \nthe TA loan could provide the base for considering a large-scale \nprogram or project loan. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The  Project  is  intended  to  raise  confidence  in  Bangladesh\u2019s \ndomestic  financial  markets  by  improving  capital  market  and \ninsurance  governance.  With  better  governance  and  greater \ninvestor participation, it is expected that activities in the capital \nmarket and the insurance sector will increase, and that they will \nplay  a  more  significant  role  in  mobilizing  long-term  funds  for \ninfrastructure and industry, and for spurring economic growth.  \n   \nCost Estimates  The total cost is estimated at $4.0 million equivalent, of which $2.5 \nmillion (63%) is foreign exchange cost and $1.5 million equivalent \n(37%) is local currency cost. \n   \nFinancing Plan  The proposed financing is for an ADB TA loan of $3.0 million \nequivalent to finance 75.0% of the project cost, including $0.5 \nmillion equivalent of the local currency cost. The Government will \nfinance a minimum of $1.0 million equivalent of the local currency \ncost. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $3.0 million in various currencies equivalent to Special \nDrawing Rights (SDR) 2.103 million will be provided from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial  Funds  resources.  The  loan  will  have  a  32-year  term, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  30 June 2008 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2007 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Finance, Finance Division (MOF-FD) \n   \nImplementation  The implementing agency (IA) for part 1 of the Project will be the \nArrangements  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (SEC),  except  for  the \nInvestment  Corporation  of  Bangladesh  (ICB)  component,  for \nwhich ICB will be the IA. The IA for part 2 will be the Office of the \nChief Controller of Insurance (OCCI), Ministry of Commerce. Each \nIA will be responsible for the effective day-to-day implementation \nof the TA loan components.  \n ", "  iii\nA project management unit (PMU) created under MOF-FD will be \nthe working secretariat and will support the project activities. The \nPMU will (i) coordinate implementation, (ii) carry out administrative \nand fiduciary support, and (iii) support MOF-FD in reporting on the \nprogress of the Project and the use of the TA loan funds.  \n   \nProcurement  Procurement of goods and services will be in accordance with \nADB's  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Each  supply  contract  for \nequipment,  computers,  or  materials  estimated  to  cost  the \nequivalent of $500,000 or less will be awarded on the basis of \ninternational shopping, and supply contracts valued at $100,000 \nequivalent or less may be procured according to local procedures \nunder the Government\u2019s Public Procurement Regulations, 2003 \nand which are acceptable to ADB. \n   \nConsulting Services  Recruitment of consultants to be financed from the proceeds of \nthe TA loan will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB \nfor the selection and engagement of domestic consultants. A total \nof 53 person-months of international and 56 person-months of \ndomestic consulting inputs will be financed. Consulting services \nwill be engaged in three packages (two packages for consulting \nfirms  and  one  package  for  an  individual  consultant).  For  the \npackages  for  consulting  firms,  the  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection  method  will  be  used.  A  domestic  financial  and \nadministrative consultant will be selected by the EA to assist the \nproject coordinator of the PMU to implement the Project.  \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will strengthen the regulation and supervision of the \nBeneficiaries  capital  market,  increase  the  capacity  of  the  regulators, and  is \nenvisaged to lead reform of the operations of existing financial \nintermediaries  to  improve  their  efficiency  and  governance \nstructures.  The  interventions  will  benefit  domestic  and \ninternational investors, public and private sector borrowers and \nissuers, and other market participants. The Project will create an \nenvironment  of  greater  confidence  in  market  activities  in \nBangladesh. Alternative pricing methods for initial public offerings \nwill be recommended and implemented, thereby facilitating the \nflotation of new issues and helping to deepen the capital market. \n  \nRevamping  the  insurance  legislation  and  strengthening  the \ncapacity of the regulator (OCCI, or any successor that may be \nestablished) will enable the insurance sector to play a greater role \nin  providing  new  insurance  products  and  services,  thereby \ninvesting in the economic development of the country. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  Lack of ownership of the reforms by the Government and IAs is \nthe key risk threatening financial sector reforms in Bangladesh. \nThis risk has been mitigated by fully engaging the EA and the IAs \nin the selection process, design, and details of each component. \n ", "iv   \n  \nThe  Project  can  only  achieve  its  targeted  impact  through \ncontinued  reforms  in  the  financial  sector.  Given  the  shifting \npriorities of the Government, there is a risk that these reforms may \nbe sidelined. The Project will recommend regulatory and practical \nmeasures to improve investor confidence. In addition, ADB will \ncontinue policy dialogue with the Government in order to heighten \nawareness  of  governance  issues  in  the  financial  sector. \nGovernance  is  also  high  on  the  agenda  of  the  development \ncommunity  and  included  in  the  country  strategy  and  program \njointly prepared with other development partners: the Government \nof Japan, Department for International Development of the United \nKingdom, and the World Bank. \n \nThere  is  a  risk  that  the  SEC  may  remain  understaffed  and \ntherefore be unable to take full advantage of the training and new \nfacilities to be introduced through the Project. This risk will be \npartially addressed through strong implementation arrangements \nthat  ensure  the  Government  supports  and  facilitates  the \nrecruitment and retention of staff in the SEC. The risk could be \nfurther mitigated if the SEC gains financial autonomy, supported \nby diversified revenue sources, expanded market, and improved \nstaff  compensation  package  as  identified  by  a  previous  ADB \nstudy.  \n \nThe Project will support OCCI and its successor as the insurance \nsector regulator. However, if the enactment of the proposed new \nActs for the insurance sector is delayed, some of the outputs of \nthe Project may not be introduced as scheduled. To ensure the \neffective implementation of the Project, consultant services will be \nprovided in a phased manner, depending on the progress of the \nenactment of legislation. In particular, the drafting of regulations to \nbe implemented under the new laws will begin after the Cabinet \napproves the draft laws.  \n \n \n \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA) loan to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Improvement of \nCapital Market and Insurance Governance Project (the Project). \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES1 \n2.  The economy of Bangladesh has been growing steadily. Real gross domestic product \n(GDP) grew at an average of 5.3% per annum during FY2000\u2013FY2004 (from 4.8% in the \n1990s). The GDP annual growth rate reached a record of 6.3% in FY2004. From 1991/92 to \n2000, national poverty incidence fell from 59% to 50%. However, Bangladesh needs to move to \na GDP growth rate of 7\u20138% a year to achieve its national poverty reduction objectives and the \nMillennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs).  Efforts  to  overcome  poverty  face  numerous \nconstraints, including the urgent need for strong law and order, good infrastructure, sound \nfinancial  markets,  high-quality  social  services  that  are  accessible  and  affordable,  and  an \nenabling environment for private sector development. \n \n3.  The Government\u2019s national poverty reduction strategy (NPRS)2 reaffirms that poverty \nreduction and accelerating the pace of social development are Bangladesh\u2019s most important \nlong-term strategic goals. To achieve them, the strategy aims to substantially increase private \ninvestment, savings, and economic growth rates. Financial sector development is critical to \nachieving these targets and meeting the twin goals of economic growth and poverty reduction.  \n \n4.  In  order  to  increase  resource  mobilization  and  improve  the  efficiency  of  resource \nallocation by the financial sector, it is important to build investor confidence in the domestic \nfinancial market. Improving the practice of good governance of all aspects of the financial \nsystem is central to this objective. Key aspects of capital market and insurance governance and \nassociated capacity issues of the selected subsectors are discussed below.3 \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n5.  Bangladesh\u2019s capital market is still underdeveloped, despite recent improvements. There \nare two stock exchanges in Bangladesh, the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) and the Chittagong \nStock Exchange (CSE).4 At the end of 2004, the total market capitalization of the DSE was $3.8 \nbillion, representing 6.7% of GDP (compared with $1.7 billion at the end of 2003). The total \nmarket capitalization of the CSE was $3.6 billion. Since then, the total market capitalization has \nslightly decreased. At end-June 2005, there were 277 listed securities on the DSE and 198 on \nthe CSE. Since most of the companies and all mutual funds are listed on both exchanges, the \nexchanges  offer  limited  investment  alternatives.  During  FY2004,  the  total  securities  traded \n                                                 \n1  The Project is based on the findings of ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh \nfor Preparing the Financial Markets Governance Program (TA 4246-BAN). Manila  The key components of the TA \nwere: (i) strengthening regulatory and supervisory capacity; (ii) improving governance and operations of market \nintermediaries; (iii) strengthening corporate governance and public disclosures; (iv) strengthening accreditation \nsystem; and (v) strengthening debt recovery.  \n2  General Economics Division, Planning Commission, Government of the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh. 2004. \nUnlocking the Potential: National Strategy for Poverty Reduction. Dhaka. \n3  For details, refer to Financial Sector Analysis (Appendix 2) and External Assistance in the Financial Sector \n(Appendix 3). \n4  The East Pakistan Stock Exchange Association Ltd. was incorporated in 1954 as a public company. In 1962 the \nname was revised to East Pakistan Stock Exchange Ltd. and again to Dhaka Stock Exchange Ltd. in 1964.  The \nCSE was established in 1995.  ", "2   \namounted to $420 million on the DSE and $150 million on the CSE, representing low turnover \nratios (trading volume/market capitalization), approximately 17.4% for the DSE and 7.1% for the \nCSE, and thereby low liquidity.  \n \n6.  The DSE general share price index advanced to 1,971 by the end of 2004, a 104% gain \nfor the year, but declined to 1,676 by the end of 2005. There has been a significant increase in \ntrading volume since 2004.5  Progress in capital market development has been made possible \nby, among other things, the central depository system and the automated trading system, a \nsubstantial  increase  in  the  minimum  capital  requirement  of  banks  and  nonbank  financial \ninstitutions, lower interest rates on long-term government savings instruments, and an increase \nin  overseas  workers\u2019  remittances.  Nonetheless,  long-term  prospects  for  capital  market \ndevelopment are mixed.    \n \n7.  Investor confidence has not fully recovered since the stock market crisis in 1996.6 Few of \nthe foreign direct investors who had divested holdings in the wake of the 1996 market crash \nhave returned. There were only three initial public offerings (IPOs) in 2004. In 2005 there were \n17 IPOs, however most of them were by insurance companies and nonbank financial institutions \nunder regulatory obligation. Despite attempts at reform, the capital market continues to suffer \nfrom poor governance and inadequate market supervision. The major market players have no \nstrategic  long-term  vision  for  market  development  and  continue  to  have  limited  capacity. \nConsequently, there has been limited investment interest and the supply of capital market \ninstruments remains inadequate. The overall transparency of market transactions is low by \ninternational  standards  and  generally  there  has  been  slow  development  of  the  underlying \nmarket infrastructure. Market participants have identified many reforms that are needed in the \ncapital market.  \n \n8.  The bond market is in its infancy. Five- and ten-year Treasury bonds have been issued \nonly  recently,  and  banks  started  secondary  trading  of  Treasury  bonds  only  in  2005.  In \nNovember 2004, the first asset-backed securitized bonds were floated. The issued amount of \ncorporate debentures represented 0.2% ($2 million) and Treasury bonds 20.4% ($226 million) \nout of a total issued capital of $1.1 billion, including shares and mutual funds, as at 30 June \n2005.  \n \n9.   The insurance sector, an important provider of long-term capital, is growing very rapidly \nin Bangladesh. As economic growth accelerates, there is greater need for insurance protection \nand new insurance products. During 2001-2003, premiums have grown by 22% annually for life \ninsurance and by 11% for general insurance. However, the insurance premium per capita \nremained at 2.1% in 2003, slightly lower than in Pakistan (2.9%) and far below India (16.4%). \nThere are 62 insurance companies in Bangladesh. They include two state-owned insurance \ncorporations: Jiban Bima Corporation (JBC) for life insurance and Sadharan Bima Corporation \n(SBC) for general insurance. JBC and SBC account for around 15% of premium income in their \nrespective subsectors. SBC benefits substantially from reinsurance premium income since it is \ncompulsory for general insurance companies to reinsure with SBC up to 50% of their total \nreinsured assets. \n                                                 \n5  The reintroduction of day trading in 2004 contributed to an increase in the trading volume in that year. Day trading \nmeans that the same position or positions can be established and liquidated within one day's trading. Since \nclearing a transaction takes several days, the objective of the day trader is to make short-term gains on the same \nday without investing any funds and without considering the fundamentals of a security. Day trading was banned in \n2003, but reintroduced in 2004.  \n6  There have been general allegations of fraudulent acts and insider trading that have contributed to abnormal \nfluctuations in share prices. ", "  3\nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n10.  Capital Market. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and capital market \nparticipants are weak. The SEC lacks sufficient capacity to regulate, monitor, supervise, or \nenforce regulations effectively and has limited resources to devote to its development functions. \nAs a result, the SEC\u2019s authority to oversee any structural changes at the two stock exchanges is \nbeing undermined. The managements of the two stock exchanges are unable to regulate and \nsupervise their members\u2019 activities effectively: the exchanges are owned and dominated by \nbrokers, so their businesses take precedence over the governance of their exchanges.  \n \n11.  Neither the SEC nor the exchanges have effective automated surveillance systems that \ncan detect, monitor, and prevent market abuses and malpractices. This has affected market \nconfidence, which has often been cited by investors as the major constraint in the development \nof the capital market. \n \n12.  The limited number of listed securities has always been a constraint on improving the \nliquidity  and  market  capitalization  of  the  stock  market.  The  main  impediments  include  an \ninefficient pricing mechanism, issuer\u2019s concerns over poor corporate governance, and high \nlisting costs. For primary market development, the IPO approval process, pricing methods, and \nthe capacity of merchant banks need to be improved. Mechanisms that facilitate securities \ntransactions  in  the  capital  market,  such  as  securities  borrowing  and  lending,  need  to  be \nintroduced. \n \n13.  Market participants, including brokers, dealers, and merchant bankers, require a license \nto trade from the SEC. However there are no professional standards and minimal qualification \nrequirements  (e.g.,  examinations  and  professional  training)  imposed  by  the  SEC  or  the \nexchanges on any of the intermediaries. To strengthen governance and the quality of market \nintermediaries, an examination and minimum qualification standards need to be introduced as a \nprerequisite for licensing by the SEC. Only qualified and duly licensed personnel should be \nallowed to deal with the public in transactions involving securities. Currently, there are no \ninstitutions in Bangladesh which offer courses specifically related to the functions and regulation \nof financial intermediaries.   \n \n14.  The majority Government-owned Investment Corporation of Bangladesh (ICB) remains \nthe single largest integrated capital market operator.7 ICB and its subsidiaries accounted for \n32% of total combined turnover on the DSE and CSE in FY2004. To address conflicts of interest \nin its combined operations, three separate subsidiaries were created at ICB in 2002. 8 However, \nall  the  objectives  of  unbundling  ICB\u2019s  operations  have  yet  to  be  achieved.  ICB\u2019s  current \nfunctions include direct purchase of shares and corporate debentures, participation in and \nfinancing of joint-venture companies, provision of lease finance, acting as trustee and custodian, \nproviding investment counseling to investors, and providing consumer credit. In addition, it \nmanages investment accounts, mutual funds and a unit fund, and portfolios of businesses that \nexisted before the establishment of three subsidiaries. ICB mutual funds created before 2002 \nare not regulated under the SEC mutual fund rules, and have no separate and independent \ntrustee or custodian for the funds. They borrow regularly to finance equity investments, which is \n                                                 \n7  The key shareholders of ICB are the Government of Bangladesh (27% of total shares), nationalized commercial \nbanks (23%), state-owned development financial institutions (14%), state-owned insurance corporations (13%), \nand Bangladesh Bank (12%). \n8  The three subsidiaries are: (i) ICB Capital Management Ltd. (a merchant bank); (ii) ICB Asset Management Ltd. (a \nmanager of trusts and funds, including mutual funds); and (iii) ICB Securities Trading Ltd. (a stock broker and \nsecurities dealer).  \n ", "4   \nnot in line with international best practice and is a highly risky investment practice. The new \nmutual funds managed by an ICB subsidiary that was established in 2002 follow the SEC \nmutual fund rules.9 Considering the highly influential role of ICB in the capital market, it would be \nappropriate to introduce best international governance practices at ICB and its subsidiaries, \nincluding the adoption of accounting and audit standards based on international standards, and \nto improve the transparency of ICB operations. \n \n15.  Insurance Sector. Private insurance companies are currently regulated by the Office of \nthe Chief Controller of Insurance (OCCI), Ministry of Commerce, under the Insurance Act, 1938. \nHowever,  two  state-owned  insurance  corporations  (JBC  and  SBC)  are  regulated  by  the \nGovernment under the Insurance Corporation Act, 1973. Awareness of products and services in \nthe  insurance  sector  is  low,  and  insurance  representatives  are  poorly  trained  and  lack \nmotivation. Insurance companies have insufficient demographic statistics to serve as a basis for \nactuarial computation of premiums. There is no strong legal framework to enable customer \ngrievances to be addressed, which has contributed to the industry failing to settle claims or \ndefaulting on meeting claims, and a resulting erosion of the industry\u2019s reputation. The insurance \nsector is also constrained by a limited range of investment opportunities for premium income. As \nof the end of 2004, the substantial insurance reserves in the system (investment was estimated \nat Tk313.8 million or $5.2 million) are mainly deposited with banks or invested in government \nsecurities. Under appropriate regulations, these funds should be more professionally managed \nand could be used to a certain extent to fund investments in the capital market and other long-\nterm investments, such as financing infrastructure projects to stimulate economic growth.   \n \n16.  To address key issues in the insurance sector, the Government is drafting three new \ninsurance laws\u2014the Insurance Regulatory Authority Act, the Insurance Act, and the Takaful \n(Islamic  Insurance)  Act\u2014to  replace  the  Insurance  Act,  1938.  One  key  reform  is  the \nestablishment  of  a  new  Insurance  Regulatory  Authority.  Based  on  good  governance  best \npractices,  the  Authority  will  be  autonomous,  and  will  regulate  not  only  private  insurance \ncompanies but also the two state-owned insurance corporations under a uniform regulatory \nframework. The OCCI will be phased out. The Cabinet is expected to approve the bills by mid-\n2006.  The  capacity  of  the  present  regulator  is  very  limited  to  enforce  the  new  laws  and \nregulations, or to monitor the 62 existing insurance companies and the large number of potential \ncompanies waiting to be licensed. Strengthening the insurance regulator, restructuring the state-\nowned insurance entities, JBC and SBC, and liberalizing compulsory reinsurance arrangements \nare part of the reform agenda. \n \n17.  National Poverty Reduction Strategy (NPRS) and the Financial Sector. The NPRS \nrecognizes the important role the capital market can play in raising funds cost-effectively and in \nenabling investors to gain access to alternative investment opportunities, and the substantial \nnegative impact that financial market instability has on the plight of the poor. It also emphasizes \nthe need for confidence by both issuers and investors, which requires effective monitoring, \nsupervision, and enforcement of regulations by a competent regulatory authority, an adequate \nregulatory  and  institutional  infrastructure,  and  diversification  of  investment  products  and \nservices.  The  NPRS  notes  that,  for  an  efficient  and  competitive  banking  system,  financial \nstability must be maintained to meet the growing demand for financial resources and that the \nnationalized commercial bank (NCB) reforms and financial sector development programs must \nbe implemented as soon as possible.  \n \n                                                 \n9  Of 12 listed mutual funds as of 30 June 2005, the parent ICB and the ICB subsidiary manage 8 and 2, respectively. ", "  5\n18.  Key Lessons Identified. Capital market reforms will have to be based on continuing \npolicy dialogue with the Government and supported by technical assistance for building capacity \nin the sector. Further program or large-scale project lending for capital market development \nshould be considered only when upfront actions leading to substantive reforms have been \ndemonstrated. With regard to the insurance sector, considering that ADB\u2019s previous Board-\napproved TA for the insurance sector was cancelled without becoming effective,10 ADB\u2019s future \nassistance in this sector should be based upon the readiness of the Government counterpart to \nundertake reforms and preparatory work rather than an ex ante agreement.   \n \n19.  Coordination of Development Partners. In recent years, the World Bank and ADB \nhave jointly helped the Government to improve financial market access for small and medium-\nsized  enterprises  (SMEs).  They  are  also  working  together  to  expedite  bank  restructuring \nthrough privatization and to resolve the problem of nonperforming loans (NPLs). The World \nBank is currently undertaking NCB reforms under its Enterprise Growth and Bank Modernization \n(EGBM)  Project  and  the  Second  Development  Support  Credit. 11  It  is  also  supporting \nBangladesh  Bank\u2019s  dual  role  as  the  country\u2019s  monetary  authority  and  bank  regulator  and \nsupervisor as part of the Central Bank Strengthening Project.12 While ADB continues to be the \nlead funding agency in the capital market, the IMF and the World Bank have also been involved \nin bond market development related to effective monetary policy. ADB is also playing a lead role \nin  dealing  with  various  governance  issues,  including  anticorruption  measures  and  secured \ntransactions. The Financial Sector Reform and Strengthening Initiative (FIRST) has recently \nprovided TA to the insurance sector.13 \n \n20.  ADB\u2019s Financial Sector Strategy for Bangladesh. ADB\u2019s financial sector strategy for \nBangladesh, which is included in the new country strategy and program,14 is based on the \nNPRS, lessons from ADB\u2019s previous financial sector interventions, and coordination with other \ndevelopment partners. According to the strategy, ADB will provide assistance for capital market \ndevelopment when the Government demonstrates its strong commitment to meaningful reform \nwith capacity-building measures to strengthen the regulatory and supervisory capacity of the \nSEC and to improve the governance of market intermediaries. ADB will continue to promote \ngood governance in Bangladesh and to expand its focus to cover other financial subsectors, \nwithout being limited to the capital market.  \n \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for Pension and Insurance Sector \nProject. Manila. \n11 World Bank. 2004. Enterprise Growth and Bank Modernization (EGBM) Project. Washington, DC continues the \nrestructuring support of financial and nonfinancial state-owned enterprises (SOEs) that began with the June 2003 \nDevelopment Support Credit. The project has a component \u201cResolution of the Problems of the Nationalized \nCommercial Banks\u201d budgeted for $34 million out of a total loan of $250 million. The next phase of SOE reform is \nalso being implemented under the Second Development Support Credit (2004), whose key support areas include: \npreparation for privatization and management support for some NCBs and issuance of prudential regulations; and \nsupporting actions in a number of governance areas such anticorruption initiatives, accounting, and auditing. The \nprogress of privatization of the state-run Rupali Bank is one of key conditions of disbursement of IMF\u2019s Poverty \nReduction Growth Facility (PRGF), and World Bank\u2019s Third Development Support Credit. \n12 World Bank. 2003. Central Bank Strengthening Project. Washington, DC supports implementation of Bangladesh \nBank's strengthening program by providing assistance in three major areas: legal framework, reorganization and \nmodernization, and capacity building. \n13 The Insurance Law Reform Project (2003) of FIRST has provided recommendations for the insurance sector \ndevelopment as well as input for the draft insurance act. FIRST is a $53 million multi-donor program (there were \nseven donors in 2004) to support capacity building and policy development projects in the financial sector. FIRST \nprovides technical assistance grants for short- and medium-term projects in the areas of financial sector regulation, \nsupervision and development. \n14  ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program (2006\u20132010): Bangladesh. Manila. \n ", "6   \n21.  Rationale of the TA Loan. While the TA loan focuses on governance, it was targeted \nmainly to selected subsectors taking into account the Government\u2019s commitment to subsector \nreform,  ADB\u2019s  new  country  strategy  and  program,  activities  of  development  partners, \nstakeholder consultation, and the expected contribution the Project will make to overall financial \nsector reform. Reflecting lessons identified from ADB\u2019s previous interventions in the financial \nsector, the strong commitment to subsector reforms, not only by the Government but by the \ninstitutions concerned, was given the highest priority for the success and sustainability of the \nProject.  \n \n22.  For the capital market, weak governance and associated capacity are considered to be \nthe primary causes of low investor confidence. The Government and ICB fully accept that \ntransparency and corporate governance of ICB have to be improved. ICB needs to establish \nitself as an example of a good market participant if investor confidence is to be raised. While \nefforts  to  improve  insurance  sector  governance  have  also  been  initiated,  the  Government \nrecognizes that much still needs to be done. Accordingly, the Government asked for a TA loan \nto address urgent issues in the capital market and the insurance sector, and in order to maintain \nthe momentum in areas where reforms have been initiated. Successful implementation of the \nTA loan could provide the base for considering a large-scale program or project loan.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n23.  The Project will support the development of a sound and efficient capital market and \ninsurance sector to help accelerate economic growth and poverty reduction. The specific project \noutcome  will  be  improvements  in  governance  and  efficiency,  thereby  bolstering  investor \nconfidence in the capital market and in the insurance sector. The Project will provide the \nfoundation for future reforms anchored on stronger market confidence and enhanced market \ninstitutions. The project framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Outputs \n24.  The Project has two parts: (i) enhancement of the governance and capacity of the capital \nmarket, and (ii) enhancement of the governance and capacity of the insurance sector.  \n \n1.  Part 1: Enhancement of Governance and Capacity of the Capital Market \n \n25.  Part  1  will  have  four  components  covering  the  regulator,  stock  exchanges,  market \nintermediaries, and the ICB. \n \na.  Component 1: SEC \ni.  Strengthening the Market Surveillance Systems  \n26.  To strengthen the SEC\u2019s operations and governance, (i) a real-time market surveillance \nsystem  will  be  installed,  and  (ii)  capacity  building  will  be  provided  to  improve  monitoring, \nsupervision, and enforcement capacity of the SEC. \n \n27.  The Project will help the SEC to install and operate an automated, online surveillance \nsystem.  The  surveillance  system  will  help  the  SEC  and  the  exchanges  to  detect  trading ", "  7\nirregularities and market abuse as they occur and to reduce the amount of manual work. The \nProject will also train staff and provide manuals. \n  \n28.  The key activities of the Project will include preparation of a request for proposals from \ninternational vendors, evaluation of the proposals in order to select the vendor shortlist, and \nassistance for contract negotiation. At the shortlist stage, officials from the SEC and elsewhere \nwill visit overseas system reference sites. The chosen vendor will provide training and manuals.  \n \n29.  The  SEC  surveillance  system  will  complement  the  stock  exchanges\u2019  own  market \nsurveillance activities and ensure that the exchanges are performing their regulatory functions \nwell.  The  stock  exchanges  will  establish  a  regulatory  review  committee  to  support  the \nimplementation  of  surveillance  systems  and  to  prevent  vested  interests  of  the  exchanges\u2019 \nmembers from encroaching on the exchanges\u2019 regulatory functions. The committee will be \ncomposed  of  representatives  from  the  legal  and  accounting  professions,  who  will  be \nindependent of members of the exchanges, and an SEC representative who will participate as \nan observer. The committee will be responsible for establishing policy and direction in applying \nthe  regulations  of  the  exchanges;  reviewing  existing  regulations,  regulatory  practices,  and \nprocedures of the exchanges; and providing views on new regulations and recommending \nappropriate regulations. The two stock exchanges can form an inter-market surveillance unit, to \nshare and discuss matters of mutual concern and to share information.   \n \n30.  Staff  of  SEC,  CSE,  and  DSE  will  be  trained  in  modern  market  surveillance  and \nenforcement techniques to enable them to be more effective at detecting trading irregularities \nand market abuses. The training will include examination of evidence and analysis of trading \naccounts of brokerage firms. In addition, staff will be trained not to contaminate evidence \nobtained from the surveillance system that could later be used in prosecuting a matter in the \ncourts.  \n \nii.  Further Strengthening the Capacity of SEC \n31.  The Project will continue assistance provided to the SEC to progressively upgrade its \ncapacity so it can meet more fully its current and future regulatory and market development \nfunctions, promote market stability and develop the capital market. The Project will support (i) \ncapacity building programs, staff development and retention schemes, and a succession plan \nfor employees leaving the SEC; (ii) the establishment of an in-house training unit within the \nSEC; (iii) overseas secondments for a small number of key staff, and (iv) a brief review of the \noverall risk management situation in the market.  \n \n32.  Capacity Building. The capacity building programs will help develop the skills required \nby the SEC to meet gaps in its present operations and for future regulatory needs. The training \nneeds to be met by the Project include, among others, effective risk management, enforcement, \nand market surveillance, which play an important part in the overall regulation of the capital \nmarket. The training for the SEC enforcement staff will concentrate on hands-on training and \ninclude exposure to actual cases.  \n \n33.  Initially, SEC professional staff, who have yet to undergo training in different aspects of \nmarket regulation, will be trained in a broad range of capital market regulations. In constructing \nthe overall design of a medium-term training program, the need to regulate the market based on \n ", "8   \nInternational Organization of Securities Commission (IOSCO) standards and principles,15 taking \ninto account the developing market context, will be stressed. Particular emphasis will be given \nto dealing with the functions and objectives of, and approaches to, regulating and developing \nthe capital market.  \n \n34.  General courses will be given to all staff of SEC, while specific courses will be designed \nand  undertaken  for  SEC  management  and  its  Board  covering  regulatory  issues,  market \noperations, and organizational management. The courses for the Board and top management \nwill help them to understand the overall organizational perspective, vision and requirements \nneeded to be able to formulate and implement strategic plans. Those for the other management \nwill  concentrate  on  developing  an  overall  perspective  on  financial  market  operations,  and \nprovide in-depth exposure to various techniques of market operations.  \n \n35.  The  policy  and  procedures  on  selection  of  staff  for  local  and  international  training, \nincluding a policy for retaining trainees, will be transparent. Policies and procedures will be \nintroduced to recruit employees. An organizational and succession plan will be developed and \nimplemented.  There  will  be  a  facilitation  plan  of  selected  current  senior  staff  to  obtain \nprofessional qualifications appropriate to their posts. \n \n36.  Establishment of In-House Training Unit. The Project will help to establish a training \nunit within the SEC, to ensure that training is sustained. The unit will have a high profile in the \nSEC and be responsible for both initial and subsequent training of its staff. Trainers with \nexpertise in the highly specialized regulatory functions of the SEC are rare in Bangladesh, so \nconsideration will be given to using qualified retired officers from the SEC with the expertise and \ntraining skills to conduct in-house training programmes.  \n \n37.  Overseas Secondment. In order for them to be able to formulate policies in line with \ninternational practices appropriate for Bangladesh, SEC staff as well as designated Ministry of \nFinance (MOF) officials will be helped to acquire in-depth understanding of how specific policies \nhave been formulated and implemented in other jurisdictions. Secondments to SECs or financial \ninstitutions in other countries will be arranged for a few key staff from SEC and MOF. In order \nfor  others  to  benefit  in  the  training,  conditions  will  be  set  for  back-to-office  reporting, \ndissemination of knowledge to other staff and concerned persons outside the agency, and \nretaining staff when they return from secondment.  \n \n38.  Risk Management. The Project will support a concise overall risk management review \nso that the SEC can identify potential weaknesses in the market structure. This will strengthen \nthe SEC\u2019s preparedness for its supervisory functions. \n \nb.  Component 2: Stock Exchanges \n39.  The two subcomponents for the stock exchanges include (i) enhancing the capacity of \nmanagement and governance of the stock exchanges; and (ii) increasing demand for and \nsupply of securities. \n \ni.  Enhancing the Capacity of Management and Governance of \nthe Stock Exchanges \n                                                 \n15 IOSCO,  as  the  principal  international  securities  regulatory  standards-setting  organization,  advocates  the \nimportance of the integrity of capital markets as essential to a country\u2019s financial stability and economic prosperity. \nIt provides guidelines to enable regulators to identify and address possible weaknesses to a financial system. ", "  9\n40.  The Project will ensure that high regulatory, operational, and governance standards are \nmaintained by each exchange, thus helping the SEC to ensure effective regulatory oversight \nand enabling the exchanges to operate to international standards. This will include: (i) training \nstaff of the two stock exchanges, and (ii) improving the exchanges\u2019 governance structures.  \n \n41.  Management must be provided with the knowledge to operate the exchanges effectively \nand  efficiently  by  international  standards.  The  Project  will  provide  training,  coaching,  and \norganizational  development  advice  to  management.  Some  of  the  local  training  may  be \ncombined with SEC staff training. The component will cover a needs assessment of designated \nstaff at each exchange and the provision of courses based on those outlined in component 1 for \nthe SEC. The Project will help to arrange (but not fund) secondment of selected exchange staff \nto overseas exchanges.   \n \n42.  To improve management efficiency and help to raise the operations and governance of \nthe exchanges to international standards, the boards and committees of exchanges will be \nstreamlined.  The  Project  will  help  to  review  current  governance  regulations,  such  as  the \nmemorandum and articles of associations of the exchanges, and preparing draft papers to \npresent to the SEC for approval. The Project will specify how to (i) optimize the number of \nmembers of the exchange boards,16 and the number of functional committees17; (ii) make the \nlisting  of  securities  a  function  of  the  exchange  executive;  and  (iii)  establish  other  market \ncommittees as advisory groups. To improve the governance and liquidity of the capital market in \nthe longer term, the DSE and the CSE may consider demutualization and merger. \n \nii.  Increasing Demand for and Supply of Securities \n43.  The Project will consider ways to facilitate transactions in the exchanges, through the \nuse of various accepted trading mechanisms such as margin lending, borrowing and lending of \nsecurities, and the introduction of new products suitable for Bangladesh.  \n \n44.  It will also consider ways in which the supply of securities may be increased by \ndetermining incentives to attract more companies to list on the exchanges, as well as reviewing \ncurrent listing rules with a view to facilitating listing requirements. In particular, the Project will \nhelp review pricing practices and recommend an efficient approval process for IPOs. It will help \nthe authorities to encourage the use of alternative pricing methods, including a book building \nsystem for pricing IPOs. It will also explore ways in which the cost and time for companies to go \npublic can be reduced, and public distribution of shares can be made an attractive alternative for \nraising capital. The Project will also review and clarify the legal framework aiming to strengthen \nimplementing regulations concerning the acquisition of shares via mergers and acquisitions in \naccordance with international best practices. \n \nc.  Component  3:  Market  Intermediaries\u2014Enhancing  Capacity  and \nOperating Standards \n45.  The Project will improve the operating performance of market intermediaries through the \nadoption  of  sound  practices,  training  programs,  and  sustainable  facilities  for  training.  The \nProject  will  conduct  a  review  of  the  licensing  regime  for  market  intermediaries,  including \ncategories of licensed entities, capital requirements, codes of conduct, and the criteria for being \na fit and proper institution. The licensing review will extend to securities brokers and dealers, \n                                                 \n16 There are currently 24 board members in the DSE and 25 in the CSE.  \n17 There are currently 12 committees in the DSE and 14 in the CSE. \n ", "10   \nsecurities agents, authorized representatives, merchant bankers, underwriters, issue managers, \nportfolio managers, and investment advisors. Recommendations on new rules or codes, such \nas capital adequacy rules and sales practices codes, will help SEC to implement the licensing \nregime in light of international standards and Bangladesh business practices.  \n \n46.  Training and accreditation are integral parts of the licensing scheme. The Project will \nhelp to ensure appropriate persons are registered and licensed in the capital market. A testing \nsystem consisting of courses and examinations will be established. The licensing regime will \nconform to international practices and procedures and will be appropriate to Bangladesh\u2019s level \nof market development. Measures will be taken to minimize conflicts of interest and to ensure \nthat, within a given context, all clients are treated fairly and equally. \n \n47.  The  Project  will  provide  consultancy  support  to  establish  a  national  capital  market \ninstitute that will train the full spectrum of market professionals.18 The institute will train staff \nfrom the securities industry who need to be licensed by the SEC, establish syllabi, and set and \nmark examinations.19 To ensure that the institute can provide services based on international \nbest practices, and that it is sustainable, similar bodies in other countries will be studied and \ntheir experience incorporated into the legal and institutional framework of the institute. As it \ndevelops, the institute will be able to offer a wide range of other courses, for both professionals \nand investors.  \n \n48.  As  the  rules  and  regulations  change  for  brokers,  investment  advisors,  and  fund \nmanagers to permit the evolution of full-service investment banks, the knowledge and skills \nrequired will expand beyond basic licensing standards. The proposed institute could provide \npreparation for the chartered financial analyst (CFA) qualification and become a CFA testing \ncenter. \n \n49.  The  Project  will  develop  an  awareness  and  training  program  for  potential  female \ninvestors and organizations run by women. Such investors and organizations can play a role in \nfinancial markets, but often lack knowledge of the markets. The training program could be \nadopted by interested institutes on the basis of needs.  \n \nd.  Component 4: Investment Corporation of Bangladesh (ICB)\u2014\nEnhancement of Governance and Capacity \n \n50.  The Project will enhance the governance of ICB to bring its operations into line with \ninternational best practice. The Project will finance a review of accounting and audit standards \nand practices, and management practices of ICB, and its subsidiaries and affiliates.  \n \n51.  Key standards and practices to be improved by the review will include:  \n \n(i)  the corporate structure and proper recording on the financial statements of ICB \nand/or its subsidiaries, including: \n                                                 \n18 Securities institutes internationally usually focus on training securities market professionals for legally required \nexaminations for licensing. Securities institutes may also offer higher-level qualifications for professional leading to \na membership of the institute (e.g., the Hong Kong Securities Institute and the Securities Institute of Australia are \nmembership structured). They may be sponsored by the industry, private organizations, including overseas \ninstitutions, or the SEC may take some part.  There is no one standard model. An institute may need to be licensed \nby the SEC to give examinations and/or courses. Previous ADB TA (footnote 1) contains a detailed discussion of \nthe requirement of the institute.     \n19 The SEC has already set up a steering committee for the capital market institute. ", "  11\n(a)  equity accounting for subsidiaries, \n(b)  effects of consolidation, including intercompany eliminations, \n(c)  accounting rules for the income statement, \n(d)  intercompany portfolio transactions; \n(ii)  the impact of ICB brokerage and other fees on managed mutual funds and unit \ntrust shareholders; \n(iii)  identification and write-off of bad assets and provision policy; \n(iv)  inventory of assets and securities, including those of managed mutual funds; \n(v)  matching of assets and securities based on specific identification with mutual \nfunds; and \n(vi)  determination of the net asset value of the mutual funds and the unit fund.  \n \n52.  Based on the review, recommendations will be made on incorporating good governance \nprinciples and practices in these areas and on the adjustments needed for ICB management to \nmeet international standards and to adopt international best practices. On-the-job training and \ndissemination of the findings and recommendations of the review will help strengthen related \ncapacity of ICB, and its subsidiaries and affiliates. The Project will develop a capacity building \nprogram to support ICB and its subsidiaries in areas of weak governance.  \n \n2.  Part 2: Enhancement of Governance and Capacity of the Insurance Sector  \n \n53.  Key outputs will include capacity building of the regulatory authority, regulations for the \nnew  legislation,  a  development  plan  for  state-owned  insurance  corporations,  and  updated \nmortality tables. The Project will undertake a capacity building program for the key staff of the \ncurrent  insurance  regulatory  authority  (OCCI)  who  are  likely  to  be  employed  by  the  new \nregulator under the proposed Insurance Regulatory Authority Act, the Insurance Act, and the \nTakaful  (Islamic  Insurance)  Act.  The  support  will  include  a  review  of  the  functions  of  the \ninsurance  regulator,  structure  and  organization  of  regulatory  authorities,  powers  and \nresponsibilities, conduct of enforcement and surveillance, among others.  \n \n54.  To protect insurance policyholders, the insurance regulator needs to monitor company \nperformance through systematic reports, and to evaluate all aspects of the insurance business. \nCapacity enhancement will prepare the regulators to analyze: \n \n(i)  underwriting and pricing operations, \n(ii)  product introduction and marketing schemes and programs, \n(iii)  risk management and reinsurance policies,  \n(iv)  portfolio management policies, systems, and practices,  \n(v)  expanding service availability, and \n(vi)  service orientation, particularly responsiveness to claims, timeliness of payment, \nand adequacy of service. \n \n55.  The Project will also help the newly established regulatory authority to draft regulations \nthat will be implemented by the regulator under the proposed acts when they are passed. \n \n56.  The Project will undertake an analytical study and formulate a development plan to deal \nwith any impact from the proposed legislation and implementing regulations on the state-owned \ninsurance  corporations,  including  resource  requirements,  improvements  to  operations, \nrestructuring,  and  the  timing  and  process  for  the  liberalization  of  compulsory  reinsurance \narrangements.  The  restructured  operations  may  also  be  compared  with  those  of  similar \ninstitutions in the region. \n ", "12   \n \n57.  The  Project  will  help  the  insurance  industry  update  mortality  tables  in  use  for  life \ninsurance and review current premium levels for life and general insurance. It will also help to \nprovide statistical databases for life and general insurance.  \n \n58.  The  Project  will  support  OCCI  to  become  more  automated  and  to  develop  a \nmanagement  information  system,  which  will  enable  it  to  improve  overall  regulatory  and \nsupervisory efficiency, and to undertake timely and in-depth analysis of the insurance sector. \nVisits to overseas insurance regulators and insurance institutions will be arranged for selected \nOCCI staff to improve their exposure and facilitate learning. Conditions for the visits will include \nback-to-office reporting and a system to retain staff when they return.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n59.  The Project is based on the joint strategy of development partners in Bangladesh20 to \nhelp the Government to achieve the maximum result from deployment of public resources. The \nProject will complement other development partners\u2019 activities, particularly assistance to the \nbanking sector by the IMF and the World Bank, and contribute to the balanced development of \nthe financial sector.  \n \n60.  The operating cost of training programs for the securities market will be financed by the \ncapital market participants. The training programs will include an awareness program for women, \nwho are potential investors but have to date been excluded from investment management \neducation.  \n \n61.  Extensive consultation has been undertaken with the Government and stakeholders for \npart  1.  For  part  2,  a  committee  for  updating  the  insurance  act  and  rules,  consisting  of \nrepresentatives from the Government and the private sector, is investigating insurance sector \nreform and drafting the proposed insurance acts.  \n \n62.  The Project aims to prepare the groundwork so further financial market reforms across \nvarious subsectors can be pursued. Improving the capacity of regulators and of capital market \nparticipants will address a key impediment to the successful implementation of ADB financial \nsector projects. In addition, a reform agenda to be identified by the Project will pave the way for \nthe next stage of reforms in financial market development. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n63.  The total cost of the Project is $4.0 million equivalent, consisting of foreign exchange \ncost  of  $2.5  million  (63%  of  the  project  cost),  primarily  for  the  services  of  international \nconsultants  and  information  technology  equipment,  and  local  currency  cost  of  $1.5  million \nequivalent (37% of the project cost), primarily for national consultant inputs as well as taxes and \nduties. Interest during the implementation period will be capitalized. The cost estimates are \nsummarized in Table 1. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 4. \n \n                                                 \n20 Participating development partners are ADB, the Government of Japan, Department for International Development \nof the United Kingdom, and the World Bank. ", "  13\nE.  Financing Plan \n64.   ADB will provide a TA loan of Special Drawing Rights (SDR) 2.103 million ($3.0 million \nequivalent) from its Special Funds resources to finance 75.0% of the project costs. The amount \ncovers $2.5 million equivalent of the foreign exchange cost and $0.5 million equivalent of the \nlocal currency cost.21 The term of the proposed loan will be 32 years, including a grace period of \n8 years, with an interest charge of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter, and other terms and conditions set out in the TA Loan Agreement. The TA loan will \nbe implemented within a period of 2 years, taking into account the time to recruit consultants \nand the passage of enabling legislation.

The SEC will be the implementing agency (IA) for part 1 components 1-3. In \nimplementing part 1 component 2, the SEC will coordinate with the stock exchanges. ICB will \nimplement part 1 component 4. OCCI will implement part 2. A project implementation unit (PIU) \n                                                 \n21 The allocation of loan proceeds in the Loan Agreement will be presented in the SDR equivalent of US dollars, with \nreference only to total expenditure, in accordance with  ADB. 2005.

Manila. \n ", "14   \nwill be designated in each IA for effective day-to-day implementation of the project component \nconcerned. Each PIU will be headed by a project director, in the position of executive director \nlevel in the SEC, general manager level in ICB, and controller of insurance in OCCI. MOF-FD \nwill be responsible for monitoring the use of the loan proceeds.  \n \n66.  A  project  management  unit  (PMU)  attached  to  MOF-FD  and  headed  by  a  project \ncoordinator at the level of joint secretary will be the working secretariat and will support the \nproject activities. The PMU will (i) coordinate implementation, (ii) carry out administrative and \nfiduciary support, and (iii) support MOF-FD in reporting on the progress of the Project and the \nuse of the funds. MOF-FD and the IAs will provide adequate office space and facilities, transport, \nsecretarial support, and other qualified local counterpart staff as needed. Appendix 5 outlines \nthe organization chart for the implementation arrangements.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n67.  The Project will be implemented within a period of two years. It will be completed by \nDecember 2007. Initial activities will focus on selection and recruitment of loan consultants. For \neffective implementation, the drafting of implementing regulations in the insurance sector (part \n2) will be launched after the draft acts for the insurance sector have been approved by the \nCabinet, by mid-2006. The overall project implementation schedule is summarized in Appendix \n6.  \n \n3.  Procurement of Goods and Services \n68.  Procurement of goods and services will be in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for \nProcurement. Each supply contract for equipment, computers, or materials estimated to cost the \nequivalent of $500,000 or less will be awarded on the basis of international shopping, and \nsupply contracts valued at $100,000 equivalent or less may be procured according to local \nprocedures under the Government\u2019s Public Procurement  Regulations, 2003 and which are \nacceptable to ADB (Appendix 7). \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n69.  Recruitment of consultants to be financed from the proceeds of the ADB loan will be in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the selection and engagement of domestic consultants. A total of 53 \nperson-months of international and 56 person-months of domestic consulting inputs will be \nfinanced. Consulting services will be engaged in three packages (two packages for consulting \nfirms and one package for an individual consultant). For the packages for consulting firms, the \nquality- and cost-based selection method will be used. A full technical proposal will be used for \npart 1, while a simplified technical proposal will be used for part 2. A domestic financial and \nadministrative consultant will be selected by the EA to help the project coordinator of the PMU \nto implement the Project. The breakdown of consulting inputs and selection methods for each \ncomponent are summarized in Table 3. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in \nAppendix 8.  \n \n70.  MOF-FD will take advance actions to expedite project implementation, particularly by \nshort-listing firms to provide consultancy services. The advance actions will apply only until \nevaluation of bids. Contract awards and signing of agreements will take place only after loan \neffectiveness. It has been explained to the Government that ADB\u2019s concurrence with advance \nactions does not commit ADB to finance the Project.

Disbursement Arrangements \n71.  Disbursements for the TA loan will be subject to imprest account and direct payment \nprocedures in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook dated January 2001, as \namended from time to time. An imprest account will be established for MOF-FD at a commercial \nbank.  The  imprest  account  will  be  replenished  as  eligible  expenditures  are  incurred  and \nliquidated. The initial advance to the imprest account will be based on estimated expenditures \nfor the first 6 months of the TA loan or 10% of the loan amount (i.e., $300,000 equivalent), \nwhichever  is  lower.  The  imprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and \nliquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, and detailed arrangements \nas agreed by the Government and ADB. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures procedures may be \nused  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures  and  to  liquidate  advances  made  into  the  imprest \naccount in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. Statement of expenditures \nprocedures will be applicable to individual payments amounting to $50,000 or less. \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n72.  MOF-FD will keep a record of the utilization of the loan and will ensure that the record \nkeeping  and  accounting  carried  by  the  IAs  follow  accounting  and  financial  management \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. The IAs will maintain separate records and accounts for the \nloan  components,  which  will  be  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting \nstandards by independent auditors acceptable to ADB. Annual audited reports and financial \nstatements, in English, will be submitted to ADB within 6 months after the end of each fiscal \nyear. The auditor\u2019s opinion of that part of the examination relating to the imprest account and \nstatement of expenditures will be separately set out in the auditor\u2019s report.  \n \n73.  MOF-FD will monitor implementation of the Project. MOF-FD will prepare quarterly and \nsemiannual consolidated progress reports on the Project in a format acceptable to ADB that \nprovide information on implementation progress, issues encountered, and measures taken to \nresolve them, and the status of compliance with loan covenants. The progress reports will be \nsubmitted to ADB not later than 30 days after the end of the relevant period. MOF-FD will \nsubmit to ADB a completion report for the Project within 3 months of the end of the project \nperiod. The completion report will provide a detailed evaluation of the Project design and \nimplementation, including performance of the EA and IAs, associated government entities, \n ", "16   \nconsultants, financial sector implications, and the socioeconomic and outreach impact of the \nProject.   \n \n7.  Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n74.   The Government and ADB will closely monitor the implementation of the Project through \na review of the quarterly and semiannual progress reports and loan review missions. ADB \nmonitoring will include ongoing dialogue with the Government on the overall effectiveness of the \nProject in improving the financial sector governance. ADB will regularly review the progress of \nthe proposed loan based on the Government\u2019s quarterly and semiannual progress reports, \nparticipate in the regular reviews, and require agreement on any revisions. \n \n75.  ADB and the Government will jointly conduct a comprehensive review within 12 months \nof the start of the Project. The review will assess the Government\u2019s progress in implementing \nthe  Project  and  its  adherence  to  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  procurement \narrangements.  From  the  assessments,  the  midterm  review  will  formulate,  taking  into \nconsideration specific changes in circumstances affecting the Project, the necessary course of \naction for the Government and ADB to ensure successful implementation of the Project. \n \n76.  Benefit and performance benchmark indicators, based on the Government\u2019s project plan \nand agreed between the Government and ADB, will be incorporated in the design of the project \nperformance monitoring system (PPMS) to facilitate the monitoring and evaluation of project \nbenefits. PPMS will be applied to each project component to ensure that project facilities are \nmanaged efficiently and benefits are realized. PIUs will undertake data collection and monitoring. \nThe PMU will oversee compliance with procedures, enhancement of governance practices, \nimprovement in cost structures, and accuracy and timeliness of financial reporting and controls.  \n \n8.  Environmental and Social Measures \n77.  The Project will have no direct environmental impact, and it is unlikely that involuntary \nresettlement or detrimental impacts on indigenous peoples will occur; therefore no mitigating \nmeasures are required. The awareness and training program for women in component 3, part 1 \nwill generate an opportunity for women to increase their investment opportunities and thereby \nparticipate in economic development. Longer-term environmental and social impacts will result \nfrom a general increase in living standards.   \n \n9.  Anticorruption Measures \n78.  ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to and discussed with the Government and \nthe EA. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, \nADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt, \nfraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these efforts, \nrelevant provisions of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy are included in the Loan Regulations and the \nbidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with \nthe Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records \nand accounts of the EA and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers \nas they relate to the Project. \n ", "  17\nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Expected Benefits and Impacts \n79.  The Project addresses deficiencies in governance of the capital market at various levels; \nthe  regulator,  the  exchanges,  and  the  market  intermediaries  including  ICB.  The  expected \nbenefits include: more effective regulation and supervision, greater capacity of the regulator, \nand  reform  of  the  operations  of  financial  intermediaries  to  improve  their  efficiency  and \ngovernance structures. This will, in turn, benefit both domestic and international investors, who \nwill be more confident that investments are made in well-regulated and fair markets. When they \nare  implemented,  recommendations  on  alternative  pricing  methods  for  IPOs,  facilitation  of \ntransactions in the exchanges, and improvement in ICB governance will deepen the capital \nmarket by facilitating issuance of new issues, and promoting market competition.   \n \n80.  An  automated  surveillance  system  will  increase  the  capacity  of  the  SEC  and  the \nexchanges to monitor and stop abuses in the market. Automation should raise confidence in the \nmarket that wrongdoings can be dealt with promptly and on a sound and objective basis. Staff at \nthe SEC and the exchanges will be protected from accusations of unfairness. Regular training \nand documentation updates will motivate staff to develop and refine the system, adding to public \nconfidence in the market.  \n \n81.  The new capital market institute will provide teaching facilities and training in capital \nmarket issues. It will set examinations and administer the examination system on behalf of the \nSEC. By introducing a licensing regime that follows international standards, taking into account \ncircumstances in Bangladesh, it will provide confidence to investors and issuers. Measures will \nbe taken to minimize conflicts of interest and ensure that all clients are treated fairly and equally.  \n  \n82.  Revamping insurance regulations and providing capacity enhancement for responsible \nregulators will result in the insurance sector being better equipped to play a proper role in \nproviding  new  insurance  products  and  services,  and  investing  in  long-term  economic \ndevelopment. Moreover, the focus on the two state-owned insurance corporations, JBC and \nSBC, will provide opportunities for restructuring and possible privatization. \n \n83.  The  limited  capacity  of  the  financial  markets  (capital  market  and  insurance)  in \nBangladesh is a serious impediment to achieving growth rates that will support a substantial rise \nin  employment  and  education  and  training  opportunities  for  the  population  as  a  whole. \nImprovements in governance, in the capacity of regulators and market participants, and in the \nability  of insurance companies  to  invest  premium  income  to  support  economic  growth  will \nultimately help to reduce poverty. \n \n84.  Educational courses designed for women will benefit women who have a relatively high \ndisposable income but little current knowledge of investments or the role of the capital market. It \nis unlikely that the Project will entail social safeguard issues. The summary poverty reduction \nand social strategy is in Appendix 9.   \n \nB.  Risk Analysis  \n85.  Weak ownership of the reform programs by the Government and the IAs has led to \ndifficulties in implementing previous financial sector reforms in Bangladesh. Stakeholders have \nbecome involved in projects without sufficient preparation or commitment. This risk has been \nreduced for this Project by the following: (i) for components for which the SEC is responsible, \n ", "18   \nthe SEC has either asked for the component (e.g., a surveillance system) or has already fully \nconsulted the stakeholders, including DSE and CSE; (ii) regarding training and accreditation, \nthe SEC as an IA has already initiated the establishment of a steering committee for the capital \nmarket institute; (iii) ICB, which is an IA, and MOF fully support the ICB-related component; and \n(iv)  OCCI  has  already  shown  its  full  ownership  of  the  insurance  component  by  preparing \ngroundwork with FIRST, consulting stakeholders, and drafting the proposed insurance acts. \n \n86.  The  Project  will  have  the  targeted  impact  when  the  Government  implements  the \nrecommendations made under the Project, which mainly aim at good governance and fairness \nin the capital market and the insurance sector. Given the shifting priorities of the Government, \nas well as those of its development partners, there is a risk that the Government may overlook \nthe reforms. Actions to improve investor confidence in the financial sector and intervention \nareas will be identified by the Project and recommended to the Government. ADB will continue \ndiscussions with the Government in order to maintain its awareness of governance issues in the \nfinancial sector. Governance is also high on the agenda of the development community and part \nof the country strategy and program jointly prepared with other development partners: the \nGovernment of Japan, Department for International Development of the United Kingdom, and \nthe World Bank. \n \n87.  Experience of previous projects in the capital market indicates that there is a risk that the \nSEC will remain understaffed and therefore unable to take advantage of the capacity building, \ntraining, and new system facilities. This would hinder the SEC from undertaking the necessary \nchanges  for  market  development,  including  establishing  the  capital  market  institute  and \nimplementing a compulsory examination scheme for licensing intermediaries. The SEC has \nnoted  that,  without  proper  training  facilities,  licensing  examinations  cannot  be  introduced. \nTherefore, lack of capacity is a severe hindrance. Thus the exchanges and intermediaries would \ncontinue  to  operate  at  low  levels  by  international  standards,  deterring  both  domestic  and \ninternational investors to the Bangladesh capital market. This risk will be partially addressed by \nstrong implementation arrangements to ensure that the Government supports and facilitates the \nrecruitment and retention of staff in the SEC. The risk could be further mitigated if the SEC \nbecomes financially autonomous, supported by diversified revenue sources, expanded market, \nand improved staff compensation package.22 The Project will also benefit the stock exchanges \nand other market participants by helping to extend Government support, which will ensure their \nactive cooperation.  \n \n88.  The insurance regulator and the principal officers in the industry welcome the proposed \ndevelopments  in  the  insurance  sector.  However,  progress  is  dependent  on  the  Cabinet \napproving the proposed acts and, if the process is delayed, the Project will lose momentum. To \nensure the effective implementation of the Project, consultant services will be provided in a \nphased manner according to the enactment process. Drafting implementing regulations for the \nregulator under the new acts will occur only after the Cabinet has approved the draft acts. The \ncapacity of the current regulator is very limited. Consequently, the Project is to provide capacity \nsupport  so  that  OCCI  can  play  the  role  of  implementing  agency  in  the  insurance  sector. \nMeasures to ensure competent staff are retained will also be developed.  \n \n                                                 \n22 Previous ADB TA (footnote 1) identified fees and charges to be used for SEC\u2019s financial autonomy. However the \nsize of the capital market is crucial for SEC\u2019s financial autonomy. The TA also identified weak compensation \npackages that need to be strengthened for SEC staff.  ", "  19\nV.  ASSURANCES  \n89.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:  \n \n(i)  That the targeted awareness and training program for women are developed to \naddress  their  special  needs,  and  women  are  part  of  the  training  that  is \nundertaken; \n(ii)  That ICB ensures that all reports and information necessary for the review of \naccounting  and  audit  standards  applied  and  practices  of  ICB  and  ICB \nsubsidiaries and affiliates are available in a form as requested, both in a hard \ncopy and electronically, and in a timely manner; \n(iii)  That OCCI will commence drafting implementing regulations once the proposed \nlaws are approved by the Cabinet to ensure early functioning of the proposed \nRegulatory Authority once the laws are enacted; and  \n(iv)  That OCCI ensures that all reports and information necessary for study and \ndevelopment plan to deal with any impact from the proposed legislation and \nimplementing  regulations  on  the  state-owned  insurance  corporations  are \navailable in a form as requested, both in a hard copy and electronically, and in a \ntimely manner. \n \n90.  Condition for Loan Effectiveness. The Government will establish the PMU and the \nPIUs in SEC, ICB, and OCCI, and appoint their key staff as a condition for the TA loan to \nbecome effective. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n91.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board \napprove the technical assistance loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing \nRights 2,103,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Improvement of Capital Market \nand Insurance Governance Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge \nat the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of \n32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the \nBoard.  \n \n \nLiqun Jin \nVice President \n \n8 February 2006 \n \n \n ", "20  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicatorsa  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact  \n\u2022  Sound and efficient  \u2022  Ratio of market capitalization  \u2022  Annual reports (SEC, DSE,  Assumptions \ncapital market and  to GDP increased from 6.7%  and CSE)  \u2022  Government to \ninsurance sector to  in 2004 to 10% in 2010    continue taking \nhelp accelerate  reform actions in the \neconomic growth and  \u2022  Growth rate (3-year moving  \u2022  Annual report (OCCI)  financial sector, \npoverty reduction  average) of premium in life    including \ninsurance increased from  implementation of key \n22% in 2004 to 25% in 2010  recommendations by \nand general insurance  the TA loan \nincreased from 11% in 2004  \u2022  Capacity building of \nto 15% in 2010.    regulators and market \nparticipants in the \nsector sustained \n \nOutcome  \n\u2022  Improvement of  \u2022  Activities of Surveillance  \u2022  Annual report (SEC)  Assumption \ngovernance, efficiency  Department of SEC  \u2022  Feedback from market  \u2022  Two regulators (SEC \nand investor  expanded in terms of  participants  and OCCI) able to \nconfidence in capital  numbers as well as analytical  maintain competent \nmarket and insurance  quality [by 2007]  staff \nsector \n\u2022  Benchmark numbers of  \u2022  Annual report (SEC) \ntrainees and licenses \nestablished [by 2007] \n\u2022  Reports of the insurance  \u2022  Annual reports (OCCI, \nregulator authority expanded  insurance companies) \nin numbers as well as  \u2022  Feedback from market \nanalytical quality [by 2007]   participants \nOutputs \nPart 1.

Introduction \n \n1.  The Government\u2019s national poverty reduction strategy (NPRS), Unlocking the Potential: \nNational Strategy for Poverty Reduction,1 reaffirms that poverty reduction and accelerating the \npace of social development are Bangladesh\u2019s most important long-term strategic goals. To \nachieve them, the NPRS aims to increase private investment substantially from 17.5% of GDP \nin FY2004 to nearly 22% in FY2007, and the economic growth rate from an average of 5.1% per \nannum during from 2000 to 2004 to an average of 7-8% per annum from 2000 to 2015. \nBangladesh\u2019s domestic investment rate was 23% of gross domestic product (GDP) in FY2004 \nand the saving rate was 18%, both of which were very low compared with those in the faster-\ngrowing countries in the region. The gap between needs and available resources in Bangladesh \nis increasing, which implies that (i) domestic resources need to be mobilized prior to external \nresource mobilization, and (ii) resource allocation has to be more efficient. Financial sector \ndevelopment is critical to achieving these two targets and to increasing economic growth and \nreducing poverty.  \n \n2.  For the financial sector to mobilize resources and allocate them more efficiently, it must \nbuild the confidence of both domestic and foreign investors. The key to success is improving all \naspects of good governance in the financial sector. In the banking sector, banking institutions \nhave to recover their financial soundness and come to terms with their substantial amount of \nnonperforming  assets.  At  the  same  time,  the  nonbanking  sector\u2014including  the  insurance \nsector\u2014and securities markets must complement the banking sector, meet the diversifying \nfinancial needs of economic agents, and encourage constructive competition. To strengthen the \nmarket,  transparency  must  be  enhanced,  the  capacity  of  the  regulators  improved,  market \ndiscipline instilled, and the structure and operations of market intermediaries reformed. \n \n3.  The Government\u2019s Financial Sector Strategy. The NPRS recognizes the role of the \ncapital market in raising funds in a cost-effective manner as well as in enabling investors to gain \naccess to investment opportunities. It emphasizes the confidence needed by the issuers as well \nas investors. Such confidence depends on effective monitoring, supervision, and enforcement of \nregulations  by  a  competent  regulatory  authority,  an  adequate  regulatory  and  institutional \ninfrastructure, and diversification of investment products and services. The NPRS also states \nthat financial stability must be maintained to meet the growing demand for resources and that \nthe nationalized commercial bank (NCB) reforms and financial sector development programs \nmust be implemented as soon as possible.  \n \n4.  ADB\u2019s Financial Sector Strategy for Bangladesh. ADB\u2019s financial sector strategy for \nBangladesh, included in the new country strategy and program,2 is based on the NPRS, lessons \nfrom  the  previous  capital  market  development  program,3 recommendations  of  the  Country \nAssistance  Program  Evaluation  for  Bangladesh,4 and  coordination  with  other  development \npartners.  According  to  the  strategy,  ADB  will  provide  assistance  for  the  capital  market \ndevelopment when the Government demonstrates its strong commitment to meaningful reform, \n                                                 \n1 General Economics Division, Planning Commission, Government of Bangladesh. 2004.

ADB will continue to help Bangladesh to promote good governance and to cover \nother financial subsectors beyond the capital market.  \n \n5.  Identification of Subsectors to be Assisted. The Project will focus on the governance \nissues  pertaining  to  the  capital  market  and  the  insurance  sector,  taking  into  account  the \nGovernment\u2019s  NPRS,  ADB\u2019s  new  country  strategy  and  program,  development  partners\u2019 \nactivities, consultation with stakeholders, and the expected contribution or value added of the \nProject to overall financial sector reform. The Project took into account lessons identified from \nADB\u2019s previous interventions in the financial sector, and the strong commitment to subsector \nreforms  by  both  the  Government  and  other  stakeholders,  particularly  on  the  part  of  the \ninstitutions concerned.

Performance  indicators,  analysis,  and  key  issues  related  to  the  capital  market  and \ninsurance sector are provided below. Given the banking sector\u2019s dominance in Bangladesh, \nbanking issues are also reviewed. \n \nB.  The Capital Market \n \n7.  Bangladesh\u2019s capital market\u2014the market for trading long-term debt and equity securities, \nconsisting  of  primary  and  secondary  markets\u2014remains  underdeveloped,  despite  recent \nimprovements. The capital market is essentially equity-oriented, with two stock exchanges: the \nDhaka  Stock  Exchange  (DSE)  and  the  Chittagong  Stock  Exchange  (CSE).5 Government \nsecurities and savings instruments account for almost all of the nonbank debentures that are \nissued. There were 277 listed securities on the DSE and 198 on the CSE at end-June 2005. \nSince most companies and all mutual funds are listed on both stock exchanges, the exchanges \noffer limited investment alternatives. During FY2004, the total securities traded amounted to \nTk24.8 billion ($420 million) on the DSE and Tk8.9 billion ($150 million) on the CSE. The \nturnover ratios (trading volume/market capitalization) were low, approximately 17.4% for the \nDSE and 7.1%, for the CSE and liquidity was also low. At the end of 2004, the total market \ncapitalization of the DSE was $3.8 billion, or just 6.7% of GDP, although there has been an \nincrease by 130% during the year. The total market capitalization of the CSE was $3.6 billion. \nSince then, the total market capitalization has slightly decreased. There has been a significant \nincrease in trading volume since 2004, partly because of the reintroduction of day trading in \n2004.6 In the DSE, trading volumes were $604 million for 2002 (daily trading volume, $2 million), \n$330 million for 2003 (daily trading volume, $1 million) and $882 million for 2004 (daily trading \nvolume, $3 million). Accordingly, the turnover ratios increased. The DSE general share price \nindex advanced to 1,971 by the end of 2004, a 104% gain for the year, but declined to 1,676 by \nthe end of 2005. \n \n8.  The bond market is in its infancy. Five- and ten-year Treasury bonds have been issued \nonly  recently,  and  banks  started  secondary  trading  of  Treasury  bonds  only  in  2005.  In \nNovember 2004, the first asset-backed securitized bonds were floated. Of the total of 277 \nsecurities traded on the DSE on 30 June 2005, only eight were corporate debentures, and \neighteen were Treasury bonds. On 30 June 2005, the total issued amount of the corporate \ndebentures was 0.2% ($2 million) of total issued capital including shares and mutual funds ($1.1 \nbillion), while for Treasury bonds it was 20.4% ($226 million).  \n \n9.  Progress in the capital market has been helped by the central depository system and the \nautomated trading system; a substantial increase in the minimum capital requirement of banks \nand nonbank financial institutions,7 which led to them raising capital by issuing new shares; and \nthe introduction of credit ratings before an initial public offering (IPO).8 Lower interest rates on \nlong-term Government savings instruments, an increase in overseas workers\u2019 remittances, and \n                                                 \n5  The East Pakistan Stock Exchange Association Ltd. was incorporated in 1954 as a public company. In 1962 the \nname was revised to the East Pakistan Stock Exchange Ltd. and again to the Dhaka Stock Exchange Ltd. in 1964. \nThe CSE was established in 1995.  \n6  In day trading, the same position or positions are established and liquidated within one day's trading. The objective \nof the day trader is to make short-term gains on the same day without investing any funds and without considering \nthe fundamentals of security. Day trading was banned in 2003, but reintroduced in 2004. Reflecting this, the DSE \nturnover ratios were 49.1% in 2002, 19.6% in 2003, and 23.6% in 2004.  \n7  Bangladesh Bank increased the minimum capital requirement from Tk0.4 billion to Tk1.0 billion for banks and from \nTk0.1 billion and Tk0.25 billion for nonbank financial institutions. \n8  All banks are required to mention their credit rating evaluation report in their prospectus when they go to the public \nto raise funds through IPOs from June 2004. ", "    Appendix 2  27\ntax incentives for equity investment have also contributed to growth in capital market activity. \nNonetheless, long-term prospects for capital market development are mixed.     \n \n10.  The capital market has inadequate market supervision and the major market players \n(e.g., stock exchanges, brokers, dealers, and asset managers) have limited capacity. There are \nnot enough securities, products, and services; transparency is poor both in trading and in the \nquality  of  information  provided  for  listed  companies;  and  the  introduction  of  technology  to \nsupport the market infrastructure has been slow. As a result, investor confidence is low. Market \nparticipants have identified the need for many reforms in the capital market.  \n \n11.  Capacity. Both the regulator and market participants are weak, although there have \nbeen capacity building and training at the SEC for many years. Strengthening the capacity of \nthe regulator and market participants is a prerequisite for comprehensive capital market reforms. \nThe SEC must improve its capacity to carry out its operational and development mandates. It \nremains understaffed and most existing staff have not had enough training. Remuneration \nconstraints make it difficult to attract high caliber staff. Recruitment and career progression are \nrestricted and constrained by government policy. Staff turnover is high by local standards. As a \nresult, the SEC does not have the capacity to regulate or monitor current activities within its \nremit  and  has  limited  resources  to  devote  to  development  functions.  This  will,  inter  alia, \nundermine the SEC\u2019s authority to oversee any structural changes at the two stock exchanges.  \n \n12.  Internationally, staff salaries at an SEC are rarely as high as those in the market. \nNevertheless,  significant  strides  towards  reform  could  be  achieved  if  remuneration  of \nBangladesh SEC staff could be made more competitive with that in the private sector. However, \nthe Government would prefer to defer consideration of separating the SEC from the civil service \npay scale. While a turnover fee may be contemplated it is unlikely that the market could bear a \nsignificant fee. The funds available in the near future will not support any significant increase in \nsalaries, but training and promotion scheme will help to motivate SEC staff.  \n \n13.  The managements of the two exchanges are weak at the strategic, senior- and mid-\nmanagement  levels.  They  are  unable  to  regulate  and  supervise  their  members\u2019  activities \neffectively. The exchanges are owned and dominated by brokers, so their businesses take \nprecedence over the governance of their respective exchanges. The SEC is required to monitor \nthe activities of the exchanges and therefore the training of exchange executives must be \nincluded in the capacity building exercise.   \n \n14.  Systems and Surveillance. The trading and surveillance systems and standards are \ninadequate. Good governance depends on having a sound technical infrastructure in place, but \nneither the SEC nor the exchanges have effective automated systems of surveillance to help \nthem to detect market abuse. The Securities and Exchange Commission Automation System \n(SECAS), originally installed in 2001 with ADB funding, is a management information system \ndeveloped  to  automate  data  recording  and  retrieval.  It  performs  some  analysis,  but  the \nsurveillance module was not designed to provide on-line market surveillance. To properly fulfill \nits regulatory mandate, the SEC needs to have its own online market surveillance system.  \n \n15.  At the CSE, the responsibility for surveillance, market operations and listings has been \ncombined into one area called \u201cmarket operations.\u201d The DSE is also in the process of combining \noperations into one area. However, at both exchanges, great care must be taken not to mix the \ndistinct roles of surveillance and business development: attracting and approving companies for \nlisting is a business development role, while ensuring their compliance with the continuing \ndisclosure obligations of listing is a surveillance role.  \n ", "28  Appendix 2 \n \n \n16.  Surveillance at the exchanges focuses on the issuers\u2019 obligation of disclosure and on \nmonitoring  the  trading  portfolio  of  brokers,  market  manipulation,  and  insider  dealing.  The \npresent systems are relatively basic in design, and if they were all operated online, this would \nstretch the computing capacity of the trading platforms. For this reason, some of the activities \nare carried out offline.  \n \n17.  Neither exchange has an effective system designed specifically to monitor market abuse \nor suspected market abuse,9 nor do they have adequate automated information control systems \nto maintain and monitor progress on suspected cases or companies\u2019 failure to comply with their \ndisclosure obligations. Cases are handwritten and/or typed and are not retained in a central \nsurveillance monitoring system. A computerized monitoring system should be used to manage \nprogress and the results of the investigation, and action taken, if necessary. Names and details \nof all parties should be recorded in a database and should be used to cross-check with other \nsuspected violations for patterns or relationships between involved parties (this is particularly \nuseful  in  the  case  of  insider  dealing  and/or  market  manipulation  involving  collusion  by  a \nbrokerage firm).  \n \n18.  The staff at the exchanges should be trained in market surveillance, evidence gathering, \nand analysis of data. A common complaint from brokers is that surveillance staff, in their \neagerness to identify cases of market manipulation, often mistake basic trading strategies for \nsomething more sinister.  \n \n19.  SEC staff use a surveillance terminal from the CSE, together with a remote terminal (not \na surveillance terminal) from the DSE. SEC, CSE, and DSE staff monitor the same surveillance \nand trading screens to identify abnormalities in trading. The SEC should have an independent \nsystem for monitoring the CES and the DSE.  \n \n20.  Demand for and Supply of Securities. The limited number of listed securities has \nconstrained  increases in  the liquidity  and  market  capitalization  of  the  stock  exchanges.  In \naddition, would-be investors have restricted investment choices because of the lack of high-\nquality equity issues, investment-grade equities, and debt instruments in the market. There were \n277 securities listed on the DSE as on 30 June 2005, including 239 companies, 12 mutual funds, \n8 corporate debentures, and 18 Treasury bonds. On the CSE, there were 198 securities listed \nincluding 184 companies, 12 mutual funds, and 2 corporate debentures. The total number of \nlisted companies increased by seven over the past 3 years. There were only three IPOs in \n2004, which was the smallest number since 1993. In 2005 there were 17 IPOs, however most of \nthem  were  by  insurance  companies  and  nonbank  financial  institutions  under  regulatory \nobligation. The main impediments to increasing the number of new listings are the inefficient \npricing mechanism, the owner\u2019s concerns over poor corporate governance, and the high cost of \nlisting.  For  primary  market  development,  the  IPO  approval  process  and  alternative  pricing \nmethods,  including  the  book  building  system,  need  to  be  improved,10 and  the  capacity  of \nmerchant banks enhanced. The legal framework for corporate mergers and acquisitions also \nneeds to be brought into line with international best practices. To promote demand for securities \n                                                 \n9  Market manipulation and insider dealing. \n10 The company discloses all particular materials to the issue manager who fixes the price and submits it, complying \nwith the legal requirements of the SEC. After permission has been received from the SEC, the prospectus has \nbeen circulated. In fixing the price, underwriters are not involved in the pricing mechanism, so investors are not \naware of the actual price. No stabilization action process is undertaken by the underwriters after and IPO and the \nsystem is absent of penalty bids. ", "    Appendix 2  29\nand increase the number of transactions, margin lending, borrowing and lending of securities, \nand the introduction of other products suitable for Bangladesh.  \n \n21.  Qualifications and Licensing. The categories of market participants requiring a license \nfrom the SEC include: (i) brokers, who provide trading services to clients; (ii) dealers, who are \npermitted to trade for their own account; (iii) merchant bankers, who provide underwriting, \nissuing  manager,  and  portfolio  investment  services;  (iv)  investment  advisors,  who  provide \ninvestment  advice  to  clients  (there  are  none  currently  licensed);  and  (v) authorised \nrepresentatives, who are engaged in a broker\u2019s office to trade on the exchange on behalf of a \nbroker  or  dealer.  Although  there  are  over  320  licensed  brokers  and  over  270  authorised \nrepresentatives, there are no professional standards and minimal qualification requirements \n(courses,  examinations,  or  continuous  professional  training)  imposed  by  the  SEC  or  the \nexchanges on any of the intermediaries.  \n \n22.  To strengthen governance and the quality of market intermediaries, an examination and \nminimum qualification standards need to be introduced. Following international best practice, \nthe SEC should make it a legal requirement for intermediaries to pass the examinations. In \nBangladesh there are no institutions which offer courses specifically related to the functions and \nregulation of intermediaries. While in other countries SECs are not necessarily the driving forces \nbehind the establishment of training institutes, the realities in Bangladesh mean that the SEC \nneeds to take a lead role in establishing such an institution. Currently, the SEC does not have \nthe capacity to do this.  \n \n23.  The current licensing system does not permit brokers to be advisors. This needs to be \nreviewed in accordance with international best practices, taking into account the particular \ndifficulties in Bangladesh in managing conflicts of interest. In addition, the licensing system \nneeds to be streamlined and proper test requirements introduced. \n \n24.  Investment Corporation of Bangladesh (ICB).11 The majority Government-owned ICB \nremains the single largest integrated capital market operator. ICB and its subsidiaries accounted \nfor 32% of the total turnover of the DSE and CSE in FY2004. To address conflicts of interest in \nits combined operations and to make the capital market fairer, three separate subsidiaries were \ncreated at ICB in 2002.12 However, all  objectives of the unbundling of ICB\u2019s operations have yet \nto be achieved.  ICB mutual funds created before 2002 are not regulated under the SEC mutual \nfund rules, and there is no separate and independent trustee or custodian for the funds. The \nfunds managed by ICB borrow regularly to finance equity investments, which is not in line with \ninternational best practice and is a highly risky investment practice. The new mutual funds \nmanaged by an ICB subsidiary established in 2002 follow the SEC mutual fund rules.13 \n                                                 \n11 The ICB was established on 1 October 1976 under the Investment Corporation of Bangladesh Ordinance, 1976, to \naccelerate the pace of industrialization and develop a sound securities market in Bangladesh. The ICB provides \nvarious types of investment, banking, and nonbanking services. The key shareholders of ICB are the Government \nof Bangladesh (27% of total shares), nationalized commercial banks (23%), state-owned development financial \ninstitutions (14%), state-owned insurance corporations (13%), and Bangladesh Bank (12%). \n12 The three subsidiaries are: (i) ICB Capital Management Ltd. (a merchant bank), (ii) ICB Asset Management Ltd. (a \nmanager of trusts and funds, including mutual funds), and (iii) ICB Securities Trading Ltd. (a stock broker and \nsecurities dealer). Examples of current business activities being conducted by ICB include: direct purchase of \nshares and debentures; participation in and financing of joint-venture companies; provision of lease finance; \nmanagement of existing investment accounts, mutual funds and a unit fund, and portfolios of existing businesses \nthat  existed  before  the  establishment  of  the  three  subsidiaries;  acting  as  trustee  and  custodian;  providing \ninvestment counseling to investors; and providing consumer credit. \n13 Of the 12 listed mutual funds as on 31 January 2005, the parent ICB managed eight and the ICB subsidiary \nmanaged two. \n ", "30  Appendix 2 \n \n \n25.  For further development of the market, the capacity for private investment and portfolio \nmanagement needs to be improved and best international governance practices need to be \nintroduced at the ICB and its subsidiaries. Appropriate accounting and audit standards need to \nbe  introduced,  based  on  international  standards,  and  the  transparency  of  ICB  operations \nimproved.  \n \nC.  The Insurance Sector \n \n26.   The insurance sector, an important provider of long-term capital, is growing very rapidly \nin Bangladesh. As economic growth accelerates, the need for insurance protection and new \ninsurance products increases.14 However, the insurance premium per capita was only 2.1% in \n2003, slightly lower than in Pakistan (2.9%) and much lower than in India (16.4%). Penetration \nremained very low: only 1.5% of the population has a life insurance policy, compared with 7.5% \nin India and 4-5% in Pakistan. There are 62 insurance companies in the market, including two \nstate-owned  insurance  corporations:  Jiban  Bima  Corporation  (JBC)  for  life  insurance  and \nSadharan Bima Corporation (SBC) for general insurance. JBC and SBC account for about 15% \nof premium income in their respective subsectors. SBC benefits substantially from reinsurance \npremium income, since it is compulsory for general insurance companies to reinsure with SBC \nup to 50% of their total reinsured assets. \n \n27.  Private insurance companies are currently regulated by the Office of the Chief Controller \nof Insurance (OCCI), Ministry of Commerce, under the Insurance Act, 1938. The two state-\nowned insurance corporations (JBC and SBC) are regulated by the Government under the \nInsurance Corporation Act, 1973. Awareness of products and services offered in the insurance \nsector  is  low,  and  insurance  representatives  are  poorly  trained  and  lack  motivation.  The \ninsurance sector has been recognized by the Government as an industrial sector rather than as \npart of the financial sector. It has therefore been difficult to include the insurance sector in \nfinancial  sector  regulations.  There  is  no  strong  legal  framework  for  addressing  customer \ngrievances, which has contributed to the industry practice of failing to settle claims, or of \ndefaulting on meeting claims, and a resulting erosion of the industry\u2019s reputation. Insurance \ncompanies do not have enough demographic statistics for actuarial computations. The industry \nis constrained by a limited range of possibilities for generating additional investment income \nfrom premiums received. At the end of 2004, the substantial reserves in the system (insurance \ninvestment was estimated at Tk313.8 million) are either deposited in banks or invested in \ngovernment securities. These funds should be more professionally managed under appropriate \nregulations. They could be used as long-term investment capital to stimulate economic growth.  \n \n28.  To address key issues in the insurance sector, three new insurance acts\u2014the Insurance \nRegulatory Authority Act, the Insurance Act, and the Takaful (Islamic Insurance) Act\u2014are being \ndrafted to replace the Insurance Act, 1938.15 One key element of the new legislation is the \nestablishment  of  a  new  Insurance  Regulatory  Authority.  Following  good  governance  best \npractices,  the  authority  will  be  autonomous,  and  will  regulate  not  only  private  insurance \ncompanies but also the two state-owned insurance corporations under a uniform regulatory \nframework. The OCCI will be phased out. The Cabinet is expected to approve the draft acts by \nmid-2006. However, the regulator has limited capacity to enforce the acts and regulations, or to \n                                                 \n14 Premiums have grown by 22% a year for life insurance and 11% a year for general insurance during 2001\u20132003. \n15 A Committee for Updating the Insurance Act and Rules consisting of representatives from the Government and the \nprivate sector contributed to the report of the Financial Sector Reform and Strengthening Initiative (FIRST), \nInsurance Law Reform Project (2003). The report made recommendations for the insurance industry and provided \ninputs for the draft insurance act. ", "    Appendix 2  31\nmonitor the 62 insurance companies and the large number of companies waiting to be licensed. \nStrengthening the OCCI, restructuring the state-owned insurance entities following international \nbest practices, and liberalizing compulsory reinsurance arrangements are part of the reform \nagenda for the insurance sector. \n \nD.  The Banking Sector and NPLs \n \n29.  The financial sector is predominantly bank-based, with 49 banks16 accounting for about \n95% of the sector\u2019s total assets. Five nationalized commercial banks (NCBs) account for about \nhalf  of  bank  deposits.  The  banking  sector  has  been  heavily  burdened  by  high  levels  of \nnonperforming loans (NPLs) that accumulated over many years and by weak management of \nNCBs. The reported ratio of net NPLs to total loans declined to 18% at the end of 2004 from \n41% at the end of 1999. This reduction was achieved by provisioning and write-off and by a \nsharp reduction in new bad debt. The reduction is also due to stronger regulations, enhanced \nlegal powers of the banks to collect problem loans (e.g., due through money loan courts17), and \nbetter screening of new loans (facilitated by the Credit Information Bureau). The Government \nstrategy, being implemented by Bangladesh Bank with assistance from the IMF and World Bank, \nincludes limiting NCBs\u2019 annual credit portfolio growth to 5% and this has played a key role in \nenhancing NCB\u2019s soundness.  \n \n30.   However, the major NCBs and the government specialized banks are still burdened with \nsignificant NPLs and are technically insolvent. The gross NPL ratio for NCBs had declined to \n24% at end-June 2005 (compared with 29% at the end of 2003), while the ratio for specialized \nbanks had declined to 35% (compared with 47% at the end of 2003). The NPL ratio of NCBs is \nvery high compared with those of banks in other countries affected by the Asian crisis. The high \nNPLs adversely affect profitability and capital adequacy ratios, and constrain the supply of credit \nfor economic development. If the Government is required to recapitalize the banks, there could \nbe significant adverse fiscal implications. The money loan court has filled many of the gaps left \nby the statutes and has, by enhancing banks\u2019 legal powers, been very effective at recovering \nbad debts. However, the debt recovery framework needs to be broadly examined, the capacity \nto resolve NPLs has to be strengthened, and an institutional framework has to be established.  \n \n31.  NCBs face many other serious problems including large and growing capital shortfalls \nand operational inefficiencies, stemming from excessive numbers of staff, extensive and loss-\nmaking branch networks, and low levels of computerization. The poor state of the NCBs and \ntheir impact on the financial sector as a whole has moved the Government to push for reforms. \nBanking  sector  structural  reform  is  well  underway  with  the  assistance  of  the  World  Bank \nEnterprise Growth and Bank Modernization Project and the IMF Poverty Reduction Growth \nFacility. Bangladesh Bank has taken a number of stock and flow measures to improve the \nsoundness of the banking sector. One of the NCBs (Rupali) will be privatized soon and the \nmanagement structures of the three remaining NCBs are being changed. However, reforms of \nthe NCBs and resolution of the NPL issues will require concerted efforts by the banks, the \nGovernment, and Bangladesh\u2019s development partners. \n                                                 \n16 There are 4 NCBs, 5 government-owned specialized banks, 30 private commercial banks, and 10 foreign \ncommercial banks. NCBs account for about 50% of total deposits in the banking sector and specialized banks \naccount for about 5%.  The share of NCBs is declining.  \n17 The Money Loan Court Act, 1990 introduced a court of exclusive jurisdiction for the recovery of NPLs to expedite \nadjudication of creditors\u2019 claims. Significant improvements in the execution of the Money Loan Courts were made \nas part of the Money Loan Court Act, 2003. The money loan court process, which is accepted by the banks, has \nbeen instrumental in improving the speed and efficiency of collateral acquisition and disposal, and in gaining \njudgments against uncooperative debtors. \n ", "32  Appendix 3 \n \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE IN THE FINANCIAL SECTORa \n \nTable A3.1:  Asian Development Bank\u2019s Assistance for the Financial Sector (1990\u20132005) \n \nProject  Year  Commitment \nApproved  Amount  \n($\u2019000) \nTA 1351-BAN: Capital Market Development  1990  100 \nTA 1943-BAN: Institutional Strengthening of the SEC  1993  586 \nTA 2033-BAN: Study in the Insurance and Pension and Provident Fund  1993  577 \nOperations in Bangladesh \nTA 2045-BAN: Audit, Valuation, and Study of Restructuring Options for  1993  479 \nICB \nTA 2830-BAN: Establishment of an Automated Depository System  1997  100 \nCapital Market Development Program      \nLoan 1580-BAN: Capital Market Development Program  1997  80,000 \nTA 2913-BAN: Capacity Building of Securities and Exchange  1997  1,100 \nCommission and Stock Exchanges \nTA 2914-BAN: Institutional Strengthening of the Privatization Board  1997  440 \nTA 2915-BAN: Insurance Industry and Pension and Provident Fund  1997  500 \nReforms  \nTA No. 3078-BAN: Establishment of the Framework for Sustainable  1998  800 \nMicrofinance Operations \nLoan 1634-BAN: Rural Livelihood Project  1998  42,600 \nTA 3533-BAN: Capacity Building of SEC and Selected Capital Market  2000  850 \nInstitutions  \nTA 3590-BAN: Pension and Insurance Sector Project   2000  600b \nTA 3698-BAN: Finance, Industry and Trade Sector Review and Strategy  2001  150 \nFormulation \nTA 3787-BAN: Central Depository Capacity Building  2001  150 \nTA 3879-BAN: SME Development and Export Expansion Program   2002  600 \nTA 4104-BAN: Assistance to the Privatization Commission   2003  150 \nTA 4140-BAN: Supporting Good Governance Initiatives  2003  1,050 \nTA 4246-BAN: Financial Markets Governance Program  2003  550 \nSME Sector Development Program (SMESDP)     \nLoan 2148-BAN: Program Loan  2004  15,000 \nLoan 2149-BAN: Project Loan  2004  30,000 \nLoan 2150-BAN: TA Loan  2004  5,000 \nTA 4507-BAN: Support program implementation and coordination of  2004  600 \nSMESDP  \nLoan: Improvement of Capital Market and Insurance Governance TA  Being  3,000 \nLoan  processed \nTA: Support for Good Governance Initiatives II  Being  250 \nprocessed \nBAN = Bangladesh, SEC = Securities and Exchange Commission, ICB = Investment Corporation of Bangladesh, \nSME = small and medium enterprise, TA = technical assistance. \na  Including small and medium enterprise sector. \nb  Cancelled. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n ", "    Appendix 3  33\nTable A3.2:  Recent Assistance of Other Development Partners \n \nProject  Year  Commitment \nApproved  Amount ($\u2019000)\nIMF     \nPoverty Reduction Growth Facility (PRGF)  Since 2003  507,700 (total)\nWorld Bank     \nPrivate Sector Infrastructure Development  1997  235,000 \nFinancial Institutions Development  1999  46.900 \nSecond Poverty Alleviation Microfinance Project  2001  151,000 \n(Microfinance II) \nLegal and Judicial Capacity Building Project (2001)  2001  30,600 \nFinancial Services for the Poorest  2002  5,000 \nBangladesh Central Bank Strengthening Projecta  2003  37,000 \nDevelopment Support Credit  2003  300,000 \nEnterprise Growth & Bank Modernization Projectb  2004  250,000 \nEconomic Management TA Program (EMTAP) c  2004  20,000 \nDevelopment Support Credit II  2004  200,000 \nDevelopment Support Credit III  2005  200,000 \nInfrastructure Promotion and Finance Facility (IPPF) Project  Pipeline  25,000 \nExport Infrastructure Development Project  Pipeline  85,000 \n     \nFinancial Sector Reform and Strengthening Initiative (FIRST)     \nInsurance Law Reform Project  2003  59 \nCapacity Building for Capital Market Intermediaries   2004  270 \n     \nDFID     \nValue Added Tax (VAT) Phase II  2002  1,900 \nReforms in Revenue Administration (RIRA)  2002  9,600 \nFinancial Management Reform Program (FMRP)  2003  40,000 \n     \nSIDA     \nPROSPER-program, a joint donor DFID, SIDA, IFAD microfinance- Being  \u2013\u2013 \nproject  negotiated \n     \nMulti-Donors     \nPrivate Sector Development Support Project  Being  \u2013\u2013 \nprocessed \n     \n\u2013\u2013 = not available, DFID = Department for International Development of the United Kingdom, EMTAP = Economic \nManagement TA Program, FIRST = Financial Sector  Reform and  Strengthening Initiative, FMRP = Financial \nManagement Reform Program, IFAD = International Fund for Agricultural Development, IPPF = Infrastructure \nPromotion  and  Finance  Facility,  PRGF  =  Poverty  Reduction  Growth  Facility,  RIRA  =  Reforms  in  Revenue \nAdministration, SIDA = Swedish International Development Agency, VAT = value added tax \na  Key components are: I.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Bangladesh: \n \nThe Government\u2019s national poverty reduction strategy (NPRS), Unlocking the Potential: National Strategy for Poverty \nReduction, reaffirms that poverty reduction and accelerating the pace of social development are Bangladesh\u2019s most \nimportant long-term strategic goals. Considering that Bangladesh\u2019s domestic investment and saving rates are very low \ncompared with those of the fast-growing countries in the region, and that the resource gap in Bangladesh is \nincreasing: (i) there should be a more comprehensive domestic financial resource mobilization effort; and (ii) resource \nallocation has to be more efficient. Financial sector development is crucial to Bangladesh\u2019s economic growth and \npoverty reduction. In particular, the NPRS target\u2014to increase private investment from 17.5% of GDP in FY 2004 to \nnearly 22% in FY2007, and to increase the annual economic growth rate from 5.1% during 2000-2004 to 7-8% by \n2015\u2014cannot be achieved without financial sector development. \n \nThe NPRS recognizes the role of the capital market in raising funds in a cost-effective way and in enabling savers to \ngain access to investment opportunities. It emphasizes the importance of the confidence of issuers as well as \ninvestors. Increasing confidence requires an appropriate regulatory and technology infrastructure, diversification of \ninstruments, and effective monitoring and supervision by the regulatory authority.  \n \nThe Project will help improve governance in the capital market and the insurance sector. Improved governance should \nincrease the flow of resources to finance productive investments, improve the process of financial intermediation, and \npromote efficiency through enhanced market competition. It will promote private-sector-led economic growth, and \nenhance the potential for economic growth and job creation for the poor. It will also reduce the fiscal burden.  \n \nThe TA loan will have an indirect but important strategic role in reducing poverty. Different social groups (investors, \nmarket participants, issuers and their employees, suppliers, and customers, and other stakeholders) will benefit from a \ndeeper, more sound, and more stable financial system. With enhanced efficiency in mobilizing and allocating funds \nand proper enforcement mechanism in place, the Government may use cost savings from efficient financial markets \nfor poverty reduction and social development programs. Transparency in the flow of financial resources is expected to \nremove structural impediments to financial sector growth that result from an inefficient, opaque financial system.  \n \nThe benefits of the Project are expected to be magnified when the strengthened market capacity establishes the \ngroundwork for additional financial market reforms. In the long run, beneficiaries are expected to include the poor and \nnear-poor. As the Asian financial crisis demonstrated, a sound, stable, and more balanced financial system has \npositive implications for the vulnerable poor. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nInappropriate governance leads to irregular practices in financial markets, including insider trading, accounting, and \nauditing offenses, etc. It constrains overall private sector growth and potential investor participation. To enhance \ninvestor confidence and promote economic growth, intensified reforms are needed to strengthen the regulatory and \nsupervisory framework, strengthen corporate governance and market discipline, and apply international accounting \nand auditing standards. The reforms should be backed by fiscal incentives, including investment in human capacity \ndevelopment, with broader poverty and social impacts. The poor and disadvantaged may be expected to have a \nsmaller share of benefits to be realized from the reforms. The key focus of poverty analysis is on identifying structural \nimpediments to adopting and implementing proper governance reforms. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \nThe participation strategy will involve consultation and feedback from stakeholders concerned on issues concerning \nfinancial markets governance. The derived outcome will be used to identify, prioritize, and address governance \nconcerns  and  develop  recommendations.  For  part  1,  extensive  consultation  has  been  undertaken  with  the \n ", "48  Appendix 9 \nGovernment and stakeholders, including workshops held under Preparing the Financial Markets Governance Program \n(TA 4246-BAN). For part 2, a committee for updating the insurance act and rules consisting of representatives from \nthe Government and the private sector contributed to the report of the Financial Sector Reform and Strengthening \nInitiative (FIRST) on insurance sector reform.  \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women:  \nThere will be gender-specific education courses held by the SEC. These courses will be targeted at women with \ndisposable income but who currently do not consider investments in the capital market, because they are unfamiliar \nwith the process.  \n \nGenerally, it is envisaged that encouraging the financial markets to function properly will lead to more direct and \nindirect investments from foreign and domestic institutional and individual investors. Companies will benefit as a result \nbecause there will be more financial resources at lower cost. Greater profitability, asset growth, and expansion of \nbusiness will generate more employment and increase disposable incomes for average households, where women \nhave a central role.  \n \nHas an output been prepared?
