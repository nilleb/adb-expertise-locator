These  areas  were  selected  in  consultation  with  the  Ministry  of  Electric  Power \n(MOEP), Yangon City Electricity Supply Board (YESB), and Electricity Supply Enterprise (ESE). \nThe  project  will  help  reduce  system  losses  and subsequently  increase  the  electricity  supply  to \nurban and rural consumers to support inclusive and sustainable economic development.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \n3. \nStrengthening power supply capacity is critical for reducing poverty and enhancing \nthe  medium-  and  long-term  development  prospects  of  Myanmar.  Persistent  power  brownouts \nduring the dry season adversely impact economic and social activities. Electrification is urgently \nrequired;  without  it  large  areas  of  the  country  will  be  severely  hampered  in  their  efforts  to \nadvance economically.  Basic and socioeconomic needs also depend on electrification, without \nwhich,  health,  education,  and  other  essential  services  will  inevitably  suffer.  About  68%  of \navailable electricity is used in Yangon (46%) and Mandalay (22%) regions (the country has 14 \nregions and states). \n \n4. \nLow  national  electricity  coverage.  Although  electricity  consumption  in  Myanmar  has \ndoubled  during  the  last  10  years,  total  electricity  consumption  in  2012  was  8,434  gigawatt-\nhours. With a population of about 60 million, Myanmar\u2019s per capita electricity consumption was \nonly  140  kilowatt-hours  (kWh)  per  year\u2014the  lowest  among  the  10  Association  of  Southeast \nAsian Nations member countries. The low consumption is due to lack of industrial development, \nlack  of  investment,  and  poor  electrification  ratio.  The  country\u2019s  average  electrification  ratio \nincreased from  about  16%  in 2006 to 28%  in 2012.2 Yangon  City  has the  highest ratio (72%), \nfollowed by Nay Pyi Taw (65%), Kayah (42%), and Mandalay (35%). The remaining rural areas \nhave electrification ratios averaging about 21%.3  \n \n5. \nHigh  distribution  losses.  As  of  December  2012,  total  system  installed  power \ngeneration  capacity  was  3,495  megawatts  (MW),  comprising  2,660  MW  (76.1%)  hydropower, \n715 MW (20.5%) gas-fired, and 120 MW (3.4%) coal-fired.4 Due to scheduled maintenance and \nvarious  limitations  of  operations  at  several  power  plants,  the  actual  firm  capacity  as  of \nDecember 2012 was 1,957 MW. Although the installed capacity exceeds the 2012 peak load of \n1,796 MW, during the dry season hydropower plants cannot generate to full capacity due to lack \nof  water.  Hence,  the  country\u2019s  power  grid  is  experiencing  of  up  to  400  MW\u2013500  MW  of  load \nshedding during the dry season. The transmission lines and transformers have limited capacity. \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The average electrification ratio is defined as the number of electrified households connected to the grid over the \n\ntotal number of households. \n\n3  The areas with the lowest electrification ratio are Yakhine (6%), Tannintharyi (9%), and Ayeyarwaddy (10%). \n4  The country has 32 mini-hydropower plants with a combined generating capacity of 33.3 MW for the off-grid power \n\nsupply. \n\n\f2 \n \n\n \n\nThe  network  also  has  high  transmission  and  distribution  losses.  Technical  and  nontechnical \nlosses  of  the  distribution  system  were  as  high  as  23%  in  2003  and  decreasing  to  18.2%  in \n2012.5 Therefore, improvement of the distribution network is urgently needed. \n \nSector governance and institutions. The regulatory framework for power includes the \n6. \nElectricity  Act  of  1948  (as  amended  in  1967),  the  Myanmar  Electricity  Law  (1984),  and  the \nElectricity  Rules  (1985). 6  MOEP  is  responsible  for  the  power  subsector. 7  Within  MOEP, \nMyanmar  Electric  Power  Enterprise  is  responsible for  the  development  and  implementation  of \nthe transmission network, covering the voltages of 66 kilovolts (kV), 132 kV, and 230 kV. Two \ndistribution enterprises operate the distribution systems in the country\u2014YESB and ESE.8 YESB \nis responsible for the supply of electricity to consumers in Yangon City 9 and ESE for the rest of \nthe  country  comprising  13  states  and  regions,  including  off-grid  generation  and  distribution.10 \nOperation and maintenance capacity of the two distribution enterprises is adequate, but due to \nlimited  availability  of  parts  and  manual  operation  of  distribution  systems,  performance  of  the \ndistribution systems is poor. \n \nLow  electricity  tariffs.  From  January  2012,  the  electricity  tariffs  was  MK35/kWh  for \n7. \ngeneral  purpose  (households),  street  lighting,  and  government  offices;  and  MK75/kWh  for \ndomestic power, and small and bulk power.11 The government recently announced the increase \nin  electricity  tariff  to  become  effective  from  1  April  2014:  MK35/kWh  for  households  (until  100 \nkWh)  and  MK50/kWh  (for  101  kWh  and  above);  MK100/kWh  for  industry,  enterprise,  and \nlumpsum  (until  5,000  kWh)  and  MK150/kWh  for  industry,  enterprise,  and  lumpsum  (for  5,001 \nkWh  and  above);  MK50/kWh  for  government  offices;  and  MK100/kWh  for  industrial  use  of \ngovernment departments. Off-grid consumer tariffs vary depending on the cost of generation by \ndiesel  or  other  means  (e.g.,  solar,  mini-hydropower)  and  may  range  from  MK100/kWh  to \nMK300/kWh. \n \n8. \nPriority  areas  for  future  investments.  Significant  investments  are  needed  to  \n(i) improve and upgrade the distribution systems, especially in Yangon and Mandalay regions; \n(ii) address the current shortage of power generation through rehabilitation and new additions; \n(iii) reinforce the transmission grid and associated substations; and (iv) extend transmission and \ndistribution  networks  to  connect  more  consumers,  particularly  in  rural  areas.  A  consolidated \ndevelopment and investment plan for the power subsector is not available. The preparation of a \nlong-term  power  master  plan  commenced  in  July  2013,  with  assistance  from  the  Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency (JICA); it is expected to be completed by June 2014. \n \nADB  assistance.  Up to 1987,  ADB provided five loans totaling $31.6 million and three \n9. \ntechnical assistance (TA) projects totaling $1.27 million for the power subsector. Since 1987, no \n\n                                                \n5   Estimated at technical loss of 60% and nontechnical loss of 40%. \n6   The recently drafted revised electricity law is now undergoing interministerial consultations for promulgation. \n7  On  5  September  2012,  the  Ministry  of  Electric  Power  No.  1  (MOEP1)  and  the  Ministry  of  Electric  Power  No.  2 \n(MOEP2) were merged into the single Ministry of Electric Power (MOEP). MOEP1 was responsible for developing, \nimplementing,  operating,  and  maintaining  all  large  hydropower  and  coal  power  thermal  plants.  MOEP2  was \nresponsible  for  (i)  developing,  operating,  and  maintaining  the  transmission  network  and  distribution  system;  \n(ii)  operating  and  maintaining  gas-fired  thermal  plants;  and  (iii)  planning,  implementing,  and  operating  mini-\nhydropower plants. \n\n8   Distribution systems comprise lower voltages\u201433 kV, 11 kV, 6.6 kV, and 0.4 kV. \n9   Formed on 1 April 2006 by The Board of Yangon City Electric Power Supply Law (Law No.6/2005). \n10 Formed  on  15  May  2006  under  the  Ministry  of  Electric  Power  No.  2,  it  has  been  functioning  as  one  of  the \n\ndepartments of MOEP No. 2. \n\n11 The  tariff  for  foreigners  is  $0.12/kWh.  Originally,  MOEP  proposed  the  electricity  tariffs  of  MK50/kWh  for  general \n\npurpose and MK100/kWh for domestic power in January 2012 for Cabinet approval.  \n\n\f3 \n \n\nloans  and  TA  were  provided.  Until  reengagement  in  March  2012,  ADB  obtained  limited \ninformation  on  the  power  subsector  through  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Economic \nCooperation  Program.  The  Myanmar  Energy  Sector  Initial  Assessment  (October  2012) \nrecognizes  that  ADB  should  resume  providing  assistance  to  the  power  subsector  to  enhance \nreliability  by  rehabilitating  and  expanding  transmission  and  distribution  networks.12 The  New \nEnergy  Architecture:  Myanmar  defines  the  enabling  environment  for  achieving  the  long-term \nobjectives  of  economic  growth  and  development,  energy  access  and  security,  and \nenvironmental  sustainability.13 Since  reengagement,  ADB  has  provided  a  total  of  about  $4.7 \nmillion  of  TA  to  enhance  capacity,  strengthen  planning,  enhance  the  legal  and  regulatory \nframework, and prepare power projects. To enhance MOEP capacity, ADB assistance includes \n(i)  a  power  advisor  to  MOEP; 14  (ii)  international  and  national  experts  for  preparing  a \ntransmission  and  distribution  grid  code,  and  electric  standards  and  specifications; 15  (iii) \npreparation of a financial management assessment of four enterprises within MOEP;16 and (iv) \nformulation  of  proper  safeguard  requirements  and  procedures.17 Also,  to  strengthen  the  legal \nframework,  ADB  provided  assistance  for  drafting  the  revised  electricity  law  and  subsequent \nelectricity  regulation,  and  introducing  the  regulatory  authority  to  enhance  transparency  and \nattract  private  sector  participation.18 In  addition,  project  preparatory  TA  conducted  a  feasibility \nstudy  for  transmission  expansion.19 The  project  is  included  in  the  country  operations  business \nplan for Myanmar and is in line with ADB\u2019s interim country partnership strategy for Myanmar for \n2012\u20132014, which emphasizes the need to support power infrastructure. 20  \n \n10. \nDevelopment  coordination.  ADB, JICA, and the World Bank have closely coordinated \ntheir  assistance  for  the  power  subsector  with  MOEP  following  reengagement. 21 They  have \nagreed that  (i)  ADB  will  undertake  rehabilitation of  distribution  networks  in Yangon,  Mandalay, \nSagaing, and Magway regions; (ii) the World Bank will carry out rehabilitation of a 108 MW gas-\nfired  plant  at  Thaton; 22 and  (iii)  JICA  will  undertake  rehabilitation  of  gas-fired  plants  within \nYangon, a hydropower plant, and distribution networks in other townships in Yangon.23   \n \nB. \n \n11. \nThe impact will be reduced power distribution loss and improved energy efficiency. The \noutcome  will  be  improved  infrastructure  to  provide  reliable  and  sustainable  electricity  to  the \nselected townships and districts.   \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n                                                \n12 ADB. 2012.

This will cover bidding and bid evaluation up to the stage of ADB approval of MOEP\u2019s \nrecommendation for award of contract before the effective date of the draft loan agreement. The \npreparation  of  the  bid  documents  has  been  undertaken  under  TA  for  Preparing  the  Power \nTransmission  and  Distribution  Improvement  Project  (footnote  19).  The  government,  MOEP, \nYESB, and ESE have been advised that approval of advance contracting for the procurement of \ngoods  and  recruitment  of  the  project  implementation  consultants  does  not  commit  ADB  to \nfinance the proposed loan and that ADB financing will depend on the government\u2019s compliance \nwith  all  aspects  of  ADB  procedural  requirements,  including  compliance  with  the  relevant \nprovisions of the draft loan agreement and ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time).  \n \n17. \nThe project will procure six procurement packages with international competitive bidding \nusing the single-stage, one-envelope method under the ADB loan. The government will finance \nprocurement  of  concrete  poles  using  counterpart  funds  and  follow  its  procurement  guidelines. \nYESB  and  ESE  will  undertake  rehabilitation,  replacement,  and  installation  works,  including \ncommissioning. Details are provided in the project administration manual (footnote 24). \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Consultants \n\n \n18. \nA  total  of  214 person-months  of  consulting  services  (64  person-months of  international \nand  150  person-months  of  national)  are  required  to  facilitate  project  management  and \nimplementation,  and  strengthen  MOEP\u2019s  institutional  and operating  capacity.  A  consulting firm \nwill  be  engaged  using the quality-  and  cost-based selection method  with a  90:10 ratio  and full \ntechnical  proposal  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as \namended  from  time  to  time).  The  detailed  terms  of  reference  for  the  consultants  are  in  the \nproject administration manual (footnote 24). \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical  \n\n19. \nOne  benefit  of  the  project  will  be  the  introduction  of  international  practices  and \ntechniques  for  modern  power  distribution  systems  to  Myanmar.  This  will  include  (i)  aerial-\nbundled  conductors,  fittings,  and  insulation-piercing  connectors  for  low-voltage  distribution  to \nreplace  the  existing  bare  open  wire  system;  (ii)  use  of  connectors  to  replace  all  existing  hook \nand twisted-wire connections, which incur high losses and result in flickering voltages in homes; \n(iii)  use  of  molded-case  circuit  breakers  to  protect  low  voltage  circuits  from  short-circuit  faults \nand overloading of distribution transformers to replace the existing horn-gap practice; (iv) use of \ndropout  fuses  on  the  primary  33/0.4  kV  and  11/0.4  kV  distribution  transformers  to replace  the \nexisting fuse  wire  practice;  and  (v)  use  of  digital  revenue  meters mounted on  poles  to  replace \nexisting  electromechanical  types,  with  remote  hand-held  reading  to  eliminate  reading  errors. \nThe introduction of n-1 criteria25 into substation design will ensure an improvement in reliability \nand quality of electricity delivered to customers.26  \n \n\n                                                \n25 This is the ability of the distribution system to lose a linkage without causing an overload failure elsewhere.  \n26  The  installation  of  Supervisory  Control  and  Data  Acquisition  for  the  distribution  system  was  reviewed.  It  is  to  be \n\nconsidered after completion of construction of central dispatch centers for the transmission system. \n\n6 \n \n\n \n\n\f7 \n \n\nDomestic  manufacturing  capacity  to  provide  concrete  poles  was  assessed  and \n20. \ndiscussed extensively with MOEP, YESB, and ESE. The designs are all the same and conform \nto MOEP standard, with pre-stressing, reinforcing cages, and concrete mix specified. Concrete \npoles will be procured under local bidding procedures in three regional lots to be financed by the \ngovernment.  The  project  implementation  consultants  will  ensure  the  quality  of  concrete  poles \nmeets the project requirements. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n21. \nEconomic  analysis. The economic viability of the project was examined by comparing \nthe  societal  costs  and  benefits  of  the  with-project  scenario  with  the  without-project  scenario.27 \nCosts  to  society  include  the  costs  of  (i)  equipment  and  installation,  (ii)  engineering  and \nconsulting services, and (iii) safeguard measures. The project costs take into account physical \ncontingencies,  but  exclude  price  contingences,  taxes,  and  duties.  The  project  will  reduce \ndistribution losses by 4 percentage points, from 18.2% to 14.2%. For the base year 2013 when \nelectricity sales in the project areas are 1,930 gigawatt-hours, this loss reduction is equivalent to \n109 gigawatt-hours. This is the economic benefit in physical terms compared with the without-\nproject  scenario.  As  electricity  consumption  increases,  electricity  savings  from  the  project  will \ngrow (up to 189 gigawatt-hours in 2017). Without the project, YESB and ESE would lose these \nelectricity savings.  \n \n22. \nIn  the  without-project  case,  most  large  industrial  and  business  enterprises  have to  use \ndiesel  generators  as  backup  electricity  sources.  Small  business  enterprises  and  wealthy \nhouseholds  in  cities  could  also  purchase  small  portable  generators.  For  poor  households  in \ncities  and for  households  and small  businesses  in  rural  areas,  power  shortages  usually  mean \nthey are left without electricity. Thus, the economic benefit of the project is a sum of the benefits \nresulting from not having to run backup diesel generators and/or not having to suffer from power \nbrownouts.  Applying  economic  values  specifically  prepared  for  the  project  areas,  the  analysis \ndemonstrates  that  the  project  is  economically  robust  under  various  sensitivity  conditions.  The \nproject yields an economic internal rate of return of 35% and an economic net present value of \n$216.8 million at a discount rate of 12%. Given that power supply in Myanmar currently does not \nmeet  the  demand  and  the  growth  rate  of  consumption  is  high,  the  value  of  investing  in  loss \nreduction is quite high. \n \n23. \nFinancial  analysis.  The  project\u2019s  financial  viability  was  determined  by  performing  a \ncash  flow  analysis  of  projected  future  revenues  and  cost  streams  from  the  project. 28  The \nweighted  average  cost  of  capital,  which  measures  the  project\u2019s  cost  of  funds,  is  determined \nbased on the source and cost of financing. The project is considered financially viable since the \nfinancial  internal rate  of return  of  8.8%  exceeds the  weighted  average  cost  of capital  of  1.4%, \nand  the  financial  net  present  value  is  $86.7  million.  Sensitivity  analysis  was  conducted  to \nestablish  the  robustness  of  the  project\u2019s  financial  internal  rate  of  return  to  changes  in  various \nparameters:  (i)  increase  in  capital  costs,  (ii)  decrease  in  revenues,  and  (iii)  delay  in  project \nimplementation. The financial internal rate of return remains greater than the weighted average \ncost of capital and the financial net present value remains positive for all scenarios. The project \nremains viable under various combinations of the scenarios indicating it is financially robust. \n  \n\n                                                \n27 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f8 \n \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n24. \nA  financial  management  assessment  of  Myanmar\u2019s  power  system  agencies  was \nconducted under the Financial Management Assessment of Energy Sector TA project (footnote \n16). YESB and ESE are preparing financial statements based on accrual basis, and according \nto  the  Office  of  the  Auditor  General,  both  institutions  follow  the  International  Public  Sector \nAccounting Standards. However, they are using accounting manuals issued in the 1960s, which \nare  in  urgent  need  of  updating  to  bring  them  in  line  with  international  best  practices.29 While \nYESB and ESE staff are qualified, they lack adequate knowledge of ADB financial management \npolicies  and  procedures.  To  enhance  awareness,  ADB  staff  will  conduct  training  sessions  in \nearly 2014. The project team has had no access to YESB and ESE financial statements; they \nbased the financial analysis and assessment on available information. MOEP and the Office of \nthe  Auditor  General  have  promised  to  provide  ADB  with  the  audited  financial  statements  of \nYESB and ESE during project implementation. \n \n25. \nThe government is committed to promoting good governance and addressing corruption. \nThe  Anticorruption  Commission  was  formed  in  January  2013,  and  the  Anticorruption  Law  was \npromulgated  in  July  2013.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \nexplained to and discussed with the government and MOEP. To ensure that procured goods are \nused  only  for  the  project,  project  implementation  unit  staff  will  verify  the  delivery  of  all  goods, \nand  maintain  an  asset  register  for  each  project  area.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 24). ADB \nwill  organize  special  training  for  MOEP,  YESB,  and  ESE  staff  covering  all  aspects  of  project \nimplementation  and  ADB  procedures,  including  procedures  for  implementation,  procurement, \nuse of consultants, disbursement, reporting, monitoring, and prevention of fraud and corruption. \n\nD. \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nThe project is to improve the supply of reliable electricity from indigenous sources in the \n26. \ncountry. The population will benefit from improved access to electricity to support their economic \nactivities.  \n \nLack  of  transmission  and  distribution  infrastructure  has  been  the  largest  constraint  in \n27. \naccessing  electricity.  About  480,000  households  from  Yangon  region  (Hlaingthaya,  Insein, \nKamayut,  Mayangone,  and  Mingaladon  townships),  Mandalay  region  (Kyaukse,  Meikhtila, \nMyingyen,  and  Yameethin  districts),  Sagaing  region  (Kalay,  Katha,  Monywa,  Sagaing,  and \nShwebo  districts),  and  Magway  region  (Aunglan  and  Magway  townships)  will  benefit  from \nreliable  supply  and  improved  access  to  electricity  to  support  their  daily  activities,  including \neconomic activities. By increasing the supply of electricity through loss reduction, the project will \nprovide increased opportunities for large industries and small and medium-sized enterprises to \nexpand  their  services,  improve  living  conditions  for  individuals  and  households,  and  improve \nconditions  for  community  facilities  (e.g.,  clinics,  schools)  in  the  area  and  thus  contribute  to \neconomic development and poverty reduction.30  \n\nE. \n\n \nSafeguards \n\n28. \nThe  project  is  in  category  B  for  environment,  C  for  involuntary  resettlement,  and  C  for \nindigenous  people  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  project \n                                                \n29 Assistance  for  computerizing  the  billing  system  has  been  reviewed  and  is  recommended  to  be  included  in \n\nsubsequent ADB interventions with detailed assessment. \n\n30 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f9 \n \n\ninvolves  rehabilitation  and  replacement  of  the  distribution  system  in  several  townships \nthroughout  Myanmar  (Yangon,  Mandalay,  Magway,  and  Sagaing  regions).  This  has  the \npotential  to  generate  adverse  impacts  for  the  environment  and  the  community  in  the  project \nareas, such as during replacement of the wooden poles with concrete poles, and installation of \naerial-bundled conductors along the existing routes. However, the project will not result in any \nphysical  or  economic  displacement,  and  will  not  affect  any  indigenous  people.  An  initial \nenvironmental  examination  has  been  prepared  with  an  environmental  management  plan, \nincluding budget and responsibilities for mitigating measures and monitoring during installation \nand operation phases and a clear structure for a grievance redress mechanism. The project will \nprovide  occupational  and  community  health  and  safety  training  and  capacity  building  on \nimplementation  of  the  environmental  management  plan  for  MOEP,  YESB,  and  ESE  staff. \nAdequate  public  consultation  with  concerned  stakeholders  is  included  on  environment-related \nimpacts and mitigating measures. \n \nF. \n \nAs  this  is  the first  ADB power  project  since  reengagement  with  Myanmar,  ADB  has  no \n29. \nexperience  working  with  MOEP,  YESB,  and  ESE.  The  aggregate  benefits  and  impacts  are \nexpected  to  outweigh  the  costs.  The  major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in \nTable 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.31  \n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nWeak public financial \nmanagement \n\nDelay in the effectiveness of \nloan agreement as the first \nproject loan  \nImplementation delays due to \nlack of familiarity with ADB \nguidelines and procedures on \nprocurement, recruitment of \nconsultants, and disbursements \n\nA financial management assessment on Myanmar\u2019s power sector \nagencies was conducted and necessary capacity building for \nfinancial management will be provided in early 2014. To enhance \naccountability, the project implementation consultants will help the \nexecuting agency prepare financial statements in accordance with \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) guidelines and procedures. \nProject readiness has been ensured in compliance with government \nrequirements and criteria, and a sample of existing loan agreements \nwas provided in advance for familiarization. \nProject preparatory technical assistance for the Power Transmission \nand Distribution Improvement Project has undertaken the advance \ncontracting for procurement and recruitment of project \nimplementation consultants. \nNecessary capacity building for the procurement, engagement of \nconsultants, disbursements, and financial management will be \nprovided. The project implementation consultants will help MOEP \nprepare reports following ADB guidelines and procedures. \nThe number of procurement packages was decreased to six for ICB \n(financed by ADB, with different delivery schedules for four project \nareas) to mitigate risks of delay in procurement and to improve \ntransparency. \nAll disbursements will be made to suppliers and consultants through \ndirect payment by ADB with no imprest account to eliminate \nexposure to weak banking systems in Myanmar. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, ICB = international competitive bidding, MOEP = Ministry of Electric Power. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n                                                \n31 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\fIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n30. \nThe government and MOEP have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n31. \nwhich are set forth in the draft loan agreement.  \n \n\nThe government and MOEP have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n32. \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies equivalent to SDR38,879,000 to the Republic of the Union of Myanmar for the Power \nDistribution Improvement Project, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest charge \nat  the  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  for  a \nterm of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as \nare substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the \nBoard. \n \n\n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n \n15 November 2013 \n\n10 \n \n\n \n\n\fData Sources and \nReporting \nMechanisms \n\n \nNational statistics \nAnnual performance \nreports of ESE and \nYESB \nProject benefit \nmonitoring and \npostevaluation \nreports \n\n \nNational statistics \nAnnual performance \nreports of ESE and \nYESB \nProject benefit \nmonitoring and post \nevaluation reports \n\n \n \nMOEP, ESE, and \nYESB annual reports \nADB review missions \nADB project \ncompletion report \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nAssumptions and \nRisks \nAssumption \nAssociated \nimprovements in \npower generation and \ntransmission will \noccur \n\nRisk \nLimited government \nfinancing capacity \nresults in delays of \npower improvements \n\nAssumption \nCounterpart staff \nfamiliar with ADB \nprocedures can be \nretained within ESE \nand YESB \n\nRisk \nDistribution projects \nnot financed by ADB \nhave implementation \ndelays \nAssumption \nEstimated prices and  \nphysical \ncontingencies are \nsufficient to allow \npotential increases in \ncosts \n\nRisk \nStartup delays result \nfrom lengthy approval \nprocess for loan \neffectiveness  \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n\nDesign Summary \nImpact \nReduced power \ndistribution loss and \nimproved energy \nefficiency  \n\nPerformance Targets and \nIndicators with Baselines \n\nBy 2018 \nDistribution losses in project \nareas: 14.2% (baseline: \n18.2% in 2012) \nCO2 reduction of 31,990 tCO2  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nOutcome \nImproved infrastructure \nto provide reliable and \nsustainable electricity to \nthe selected townships \nand districts  \n\nBy 2016 \nElectrification ratio: 35% \n(baseline: 28% in 2012) \n\nOutputs \n \n1.
