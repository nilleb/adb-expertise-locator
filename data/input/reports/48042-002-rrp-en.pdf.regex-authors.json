THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for the additional financing of the Panj\u2013Amu River Basin \nSector Project.1 \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the original project on 26 October 2016.2 \nThe project was designed to increase agricultural productivity in the Panj\u2013Amu River Basin in \nnortheast Afghanistan by improving access to and use of water and building climate resilience \nthrough the implementation of watershed natural resource management plans. The project\u2019s \nimpact is per capita income increased and poverty among rural and pastoral communities \nreduced. The current project has three outputs (para. 7). The additional financing will expand the \nscope of output 3 to include additional watershed subprojects. Panj\u2013Amu River Basin is a major \nproduction center for wheat, rice, vegetables, and fruit. Subproject investments will target water \nharvesting to increase water availability by increasing underground water recharge, improving \naccess, and reducing water runoff and flood damage. The report and recommendation of the \nPresident for the ongoing project is accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The proposed project meets the eligibility criteria for additional financing. The original \nproject\u2019s rating is on-track. The project outcomes will be achieved by the original project\u2019s closing \ndate of 31 May 2023. Physical progress was about 47%3 as of 31 August 2020 (elapsed time: \n55%).  Cumulative  contract  awards  were  $42.31  million  (57%)  while  disbursements  were \n$13.76 million (18%). Outputs 2 and 3 of the original project are progressing well. Output 1 initial \ndelays were rectified. The original project complies with fiduciary requirements, environmental \nand social safeguard policies, and is successful in risk management. The midterm review found \nno issues with grant covenant compliance, except for the covenant on the preparation and \nissuance of an operation and maintenance (O&M) policy. \n \n4.  Responding to the severe climate events\u2014namely, a large-scale drought in 2018 and \nsevere floods in 2019\u2014the government prioritized water harvesting.4 As per the national water \nharvesting program, the National Water Affairs Regulation Authority (NWARA)5 identified and \nprepared prefeasibility studies on 334 subprojects, with many being small to medium scale (8\u2013\n11,500 hectares [ha]). Given the good progress under output 3 (para. 8), the government \nrequested ADB support to expand its watershed interventions in the Panj\u2013Amu River Basin. The \nadditional  financing  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  Afghanistan, \n2017\u22122021. 6  It  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operation  business  plan  for  Afghanistan, \n2020\u22122022.7 It also supports ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 operational priorities of addressing poverty \nand gender equality,  tackling climate change and building climate and disaster resilience, \n \n1  ADB. 2016. Afghanistan: Panj-Amu River Basin Sector Project. Manila. \n2  Total amount is $76 million (European Union: $50 million equivalent; Asian Development Fund: $26 million). \n3  Includes completion of soft components, award of all community development councils, consultancies, and majority \nof national competitive bidding (NCB) contracts. \n4  Presidential Decree No. 237 (2019), supported though letter No. 962/835, called for improving water retention in \nwatersheds, reducing runoff, improving household access to water, and stabilizing slope land.  \n5  NWARA is undertaking the water sector functions and implementation role of the dissolved Ministry of Energy and \nWater (MEW), which was one of the implementing agencies in the original project (para.17). \n6  ADB. 2017.

The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic resulted in a contraction in the economy, \nwith increased levels of unemployment especially in the informal sector in urban and rural areas, \nand increased poverty and food insecurity. The government is tackling the COVID-19 epidemic \nwith a national COVID-19 program and targeted social welfare support.  \n \n6.  This project is relevant and appropriate in the current Afghanistan COVID-19 environment, \nas it is focused on smallholder households and local communities, with activities that will generate \nimproved household incomes, livelihoods and employment. The project will have a direct local \nimpact with improved livelihoods, decreasing poverty and food insecurity. The employment \ngenerated may benefit those workers who have lost employment in off-farm activities that have \nclosed due to COVID-19. The improved livelihoods will enable households to access health \nservices if they are affected by COVID-19. \n \n7.  The additional financing will enhance resilience of watersheds to disaster and climate risks \nby adding 77 watershed subprojects under output 3.9 The new activities will be completed within \nthe original project period ending 31 May 2023. The additional financing modality is appropriate10 \nsince the activities supplement activities of the original project. The original project\u2019s sector \nmodality, design, and implementation arrangements can also be used efficiently.  \n \n8.  The project follows the fragile and conflict-affected situations and enhanced project \ndelivery approaches and includes: (i) sector financing, which allows flexibility in subproject \nselection and implementation given security concerns; (ii) streamlined project management office \nstructure,  which  helps  long-term  programmatic  sector  interventions;  and  (iii)  community \nparticipation  in  procurement  and  involvement  of  local  elders,  which  minimizes  interruption \n(including security) of work. The project readiness is enhanced by the advance contracting. \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n9.  The project is aligned with the following impacts: per capita income increased and poverty \namong rural and pastoral communities reduced.11 The project will have the following outcome: \nagricultural productivity in the Panj\u2013Amu River Basin increased.12 The project outputs are (i) \nwater allocation and availability improved, (ii) command areas enhanced; and (iii) watersheds \nproperly managed and protected. The impact, outcome, and outputs will remain unchanged for \nthe overall project.  \n \n10.  Under output 3 of the original project, activities are being undertaken for 26 watershed \nsubprojects in three provinces (Badakhshan, Kunduz, and Takhar). Details are provided in the \nSummary of Project Performance.13 With the additional financing, the project will expand activities \nto an additional 77 watershed subprojects in the existing three project provinces and in six \nadditional provinces: Samangan, Baghlan, Bamiyan, Panjshir, Parwan, and Wardak. Forty-two of \nthe  subprojects  will  involve  small  investments  (less  than  $100,000)  and  35  will  involve \n \n8  ADB. 2018.

Subproject selection criteria is detailed in Priority Subprojects \nand Selection Criteria.14 \n \n11.  The forestry and rangeland protection target under output 3 will be increased from 10,000 \nha to 27,760 ha. Activities under the additional subprojects will include (i) installation of physical \ninfrastructure and application of bioengineering (revegetation and reforestation) to improve water \navailability to rural households for irrigation and other uses, increase recharge, and reduce runoff \nand  sedimentation;  and  (ii)  preparation  of  watershed  resource  management  plans,  with \ncommunity-based organization engagement at subproject sites to be developed through water \nusers  associations  (WUAs)  and  community  development  councils. 15 Staff  training  will  be \nexpanded to cover the new subproject areas. Training will target river basin and sub-river basin \nauthority staff, local NWARA staff, and departments of agriculture, irrigation, and livestock (DAILs) \nstaff. The training will enable staff to become master trainers to train communities. \n \n12.  As a result of the change in scope to output 3, one of the project\u2019s original outcome \nindicator targets will change: the target command area (irrigated agricultural land) for the overall \nproject will expand from 74,500 ha to 146,900 ha. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n13.  ADB\u2019s value addition is in implementing climate adaptation systems. This is based on \nwatershed land improvements through flood management and improved irrigation and drainage, \nwhich will improve rural livelihoods (including of women) and food security and reduce poverty. \nADB support will also target sustainable O&M systems and building government and local \ninstitutional capacity. The project is innovative in applying an integrated sustainable approach to \nclimate change and disaster risk management in upper watersheds. Subproject interventions will \nincrease access to water (e.g., water storage ponds, check dams), provide improvements to \nprecipitation infiltration and recharge, and reduce soil erosion and landslides by restoring the \noriginal  vegetation.  Technical  packages  and  natural  resource  management  plans  will  be \ndeveloped for each selected subproject site and adaptation measures adopted. It will build on \nADB\u2019s in-country extensive engagement in water resource management and rural development.16  \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plans \n \n14.

The implementation period is for 2 years, with grant closing on 31 May 2023. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Summary of Due Diligence Results \n \n20.  A summary of the due diligence assessments is presented in Table 3. The full due \ndiligence assessments are accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2. \n \nTable 3: Summary of Due Diligence Assessments \nArea of Assessment  Summary of Assessment \nTechnical  The project classification is high climate risk.a A climate and disaster risk assessment and \nmanagement report was prepared. All subprojects will be screened for climate and disaster \nrisks  and  will  incorporate  risk-reduction measures. The additional  financing  will use \nsubproject watershed designs and approaches that have proven effective under the original \nproject, and are within the capacity of local community organizations.b The interventions will \nincrease resilience to potential climate change impacts. They will increase water retention, \nand water access for households, irrigation and livestock uses, and water recharge. Slope \nstabilization with revegetation and reforestation will reduce soil loss and flood damage. \nEconomic and  The additional financing will generate significant financial and economic benefits at the \nfinancial viability  watershed and household levels. The analysis of two representative subprojects indicates \nthat the investments will be economically and financially viable, and directly generate \nincreased levels of on-farm employment and incremental returns at the household level and \nincrease off-farm rural employment. The economic internal rates of return of 14.1% and \n31.7% for the two subprojects are above the opportunity cost of capital of 9%. \nSustainability  The local community organizations that will be implementing the subproject interventions \n(in watershed resource management planning and bioengineering) will achieve higher \nproductivity and incremental returns. Higher returns and improved livelihoods provide \nincentives for farm households to adopt sustainable O&M systems, including desilting and \nsedimentation removal on an annual basis. The government will ensure that, for structures \nbeyond the capacity of community-based O&M, adequate funds are allocated from the \ngovernment\u2019s budget to finance the O&M activities of SBAs. For community-based O&M, \nthe government will ensure that pre-construction O&M agreements are signed before any \nwatershed and/or irrigation works start. SBAs and WUAs will sign handover agreements \nwith community development councils and other community organizations before any civil \nworks are commissioned. These agreements will also cover the commitments for O&M. \nGovernance  As per NWARA\u2019s financial management assessment there are no significant risks related \nto project management. Nevertheless, the over-all pre-mitigation financial management risk \nof NWARA is substantial. NWARA project management offices are experienced with ADB \nprojects. Under the original project, audited financial statements are timely submitted as per \nthe auditing standards acceptable to ADB, and internal audit reports are submitted annually \nto ADB. The procurement risk classification is assessed as substantial; procurement \nspecialists and staff under the original project will be engaged to enhance IA\u2019s procurement \ncapacity. All procurement and recruitment of consultants under the ADB grant will be carried \nout in accordance with the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time), \nProcurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time), and \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to the MOF and NWARA. \nPoverty, social, and  The national poverty rate in 2016\u20132017 was 54.5%. In the core project regions in the north \ngender  and northeast the poverty rate was higher (57.9% in the north and 62.8% in the northeast).c \nSimilarly, the rate of severe food insecurity in these regions exceeds the national rate of \n45%. The project\u2019s watershed subprojects will reduce poverty and food insecurity for low-\n \n21 A technical assistant is programmed in late 2020, that aims to contribute to strengthening the capacity of government \nin improving sustainable infrastructure development in the sector. \n ", "6 \nincome and marginal smallholders, pastoralists, and communities by creating jobs and \nimproving  water access,  agricultural  productivity  and  incomes,  livelihoods,  and  food \nsecurity.d These interventions will also be important to support communities in mitigating \nand recovering from the COVID-19 epidemic. The project is categorized effective gender \nmainstreaming. NWARA and MAIL will actively engage rural women in the community-\nbased organizations through community contracting and training courses. This will further \nimprove women\u2019s participation in irrigation associations. The additional financing will now \ninvolve women in managing watershed resources and creating livelihoods from nursery and \nforest resource management. The women are active participants in several watershed \nactivities such as community mobilization and watershed management planning. \nSafeguards  Environment (category B). An environmental assessment and review framework was \nprepared to ensure project compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). It \nwas disclosed on the ADB website in July 2020. Adequate resources are allocated for \nenvironmental safeguards preparation, implementation, monitoring, and reporting.  \nIndigenous peoples (category C). There are no indigenous peoples identified in project \nsite areas as defined in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement for operational purposes. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category B). The original project LARF was updated to guide \nthe preparation of subproject LARPs. Due diligence will be conducted in areas where no \nLAR impacts are anticipated. Upon due diligence completion and confirmation of no LAR \nimpact, a due diligence report will be prepared and disclosed upon ADB\u2019s acceptance.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n23.  The government and MOF have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB requirements, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, financial management, and disbursement \nas described in detail in the PAM and in the grant document. The government and MOF have \nagreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the grant agreement. \n \n24.  Operation and maintenance. The government will ensure that, for structures outside the \ncapacity of community-based O&M, adequate funds are allocated from the government\u2019s budget \nto finance the O&M activities of sub-basin authorities (SBAs). This will include funds for the \nefficient  operation  of  sluice  gates  in  larger  structures.  For  community-based  O&M,  the \ngovernment will ensure that pre-construction O&M agreements are signed before starting any \nwatershed  and/or  irrigation  works.  SBAs  and  WUAs  will  sign  handover  agreements  with \ncommunity development councils and other community organizations before any civil works are \ncommissioned. These agreements will also cover the commitments for O&M of check dams, \nincluding desilting and sedimentation removal. These will also be applicable for WUAs and the \nO&M and cleaning of offtakes. For other watershed management planning and bioengineering \nworks,  such  agreements  will  be  signed  between  the  SBAs  and  the  respective  community \norganizations to ensure long-term watershed sustainability. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n25.  I am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the grant not exceeding \n$18,280,000 to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian \nDevelopment Fund), for the additional financing of the Panj\u2013Amu River Basin Sector Project, on \nterms and conditions that are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft grant \nagreement presented to the Board. \n \n \nMasatsugu Asakawa \nPresident \n6 October 2020\n ", "8  Appendix 1 \nREVISED DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n \nImpact the Project is Aligned with \nPer capita income increased and poverty among rural and pastoral communities reduceda \n \nPerformance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome       \nAgricultural  a.
