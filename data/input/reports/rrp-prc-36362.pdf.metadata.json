An initial environmental examination was undertaken, \ninitial \nfindings  are  summarized \nand \nenvironmental examination attached as Appendix 8. \n \nThe  Project covers six cities in Liaoning province and consists of \nthe following: (i) coal bed methane (CBM) and coal mine methane \n(CMM)  development  and  utilization  in  Fuxin;  (ii)  gas  distribution \nimprovement in Benxi and Fushun; (iii) improvement of city central \nheating  supply  in  Anshan,  Benxi,  Liaoyang,  and  Yingkou;  and \n(iv) institutional reforms and corporate governance improvement for \nall  project  implementing  agencies .  Policy  dialogue  with  the \nGovernment  during  project  processing  has \nfocused  on: \n(i) maximizing  benefits  to  the  poor  and  ensuring  that  the  poor \nhave  sufficient  heating  by  establishing  specific  gas  and  heating \nassistance programs, (ii) implementing market-based heating tariff \nreforms  and  improving  billing  collection  in  project  cities,  and \n(iii) promoting private sector participation. \n \nMethane,  part  of  natural  coal  composition,  is  released  into  the \natmosphere  from  coal  mine  operations.  It  is  estimated  that  the \ncoal mines in Liaoning released about 1.2 billion cubic meters (m3) \nof  methane  into  the  atmosphere  in  2003,  a  figure  expected  to \nreach  2.0  billion  m3  by  2010.  Methane,  when  released  into  the \natmosphere, is about 21 times more potent as a greenhouse gas \nthan carbon dioxide (CO2). In addition, coal mine safety is a major \nconcern  in  the  PRC,  which  reported  deaths  of  6,900  miners  in \n2002.  Part  A  of  the  Project  is  designed  to  utilize  CBM/CMM  to \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve coal mine safety. \nThe gas distribution systems in the cities of Fushun and Benxi are \nold  and \nlosses.  They  are \ndangerous  because  the  pipelines  are  aged  and  often  cause \nexplosions. To address these problems, Part B of the Project will \nrehabilitate gas distribution systems to reduce line losses, improve \noperational  safety,  and  supply  gas  to  additional  households  to \nhelp  reduce  coal  consumption  in  Fushun  and  Benxi.  Urban \nenvironmental  problems  have  been  a  major  concern  in  Liaoning \nas  a  great  majority  of  urban  residents  rely  on  coal-fired  small, \ninefficient, and polluting boilers for their heat supply. Part C of the \nProject  will  improve  environmental  quality  in  four  cities (Anshan, \nBenxi,  Liaoyang, and Yingkou) by building efficient  and large  \n \n\ninefficient  with  high  distribution \n\n\fiv \n \n \n\n \nObjectives and Scope \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nboilers to facilitate closing the 412 existing small coal-fired boilers \nin  Benxi,  Liaoyang,  and  Yingkou.  Part  D  of  the  Project  includes \n(i) institutional  strengthening  and  training  for  implementing  the \ninstitutional  and  financial  reform  action  plans  prepared  by  the \nproject preparatory technical assistance consultants,  (ii) assistance \nto the four project implementing agencies (PIAs) to implement the \nheating  tariff  reforms,  and  (iii) development  of  options  for  private \nsector  participation.  Overall,  the  Project  is  consistent  with  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  operational  strategy  in  the  PRC,  and \nwill support the government of Liaoning province (GLP) in aiming \nto  improve  environmental  quality  and  coal  mine  safety,  and  to \nensure that the poor have sufficient gas and central heating. \n \nThe  long-term  goal  of  the  Project  is  to  support  environmental \nimprovement in Liaoning. The main objectives of the Project are: \n(i) improvement  in  efficiency  and  reliability  of  gas  and  central \nheating  supply  and  closure  of  small  coal-fired  boilers,  and \n(ii) CMM  and  CBM  production  and  commercial  utilization.  The \nProject  includes  the  following  components:  Part  A:  CBM/CMM \ndevelopment;  Part  B:  gas  distribution  improvement;  Part  C:  city \ncentral  heating  supply,  and  Part  D:  institutional  reforms  and \ncorporate governance improvement. \n \nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $161.0  million  equivalent, \ncomprising a foreign exchange cost of $76.0 million (47%) and a \nlocal currency cost of $85.0 million equivalent (53%). \n \nADB will  provide  a  loan  of  $70.0  million  to  finance  the  foreign \nexchange  cost  of  the  Project.  The  remaining  foreign  exchange \ncost of $6.0 million will be financed with equity from the PIAs. The \ntotal  local  costs  of  $85.0  million  equivalent  will  be  financed  with \nequity  of  $54.3 million  from  the  PIAs,  and  loans  of  $30.7 million \nfrom local banks. \n \n\nrate \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $70.0 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will \nhave  a  25-year  term  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an \ninterest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank  offered \nfacility,  a \ncommitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  and  such  other  terms \nand  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Project \nAgreements. \n \nThe loan proceeds will be re-lent by the Borrower to GLP through \nterms  and \na  subsidiary \nconditions. \n \nUntil 30 September 2009 \n \n31 March 2009 \n\n \nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\nloan  agreement  under \n\n(LIBOR)-based \n\nthe  same \n\nlending \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \n\n \n\n\fImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\nv \n \nGLP  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  (EA)  for  the  Project.  The \nsubcomponents  will  be  implemented  by  seven  PIAs.  A  project \nmanagement  office  (PMO)  will  be  responsible  for  managing, \ncoordinating,  and  supervising \nimplementation  of  project \nsubcomponents. Each PIA will establish a project implementation \noffice  (PIO)  to  undertake  the  direct  responsibility  for  design, \nconstruction, and operation of subprojects. Project implementation \nstarted in August 2004 with the preparation of bidding documents. \n \nGovernment of Liaoning Province (GLP) \n \nEquipment, materials, and services financed from the proceeds of \nthe  ADB  loan  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  Procurement.  Items  financed  with  local  currency \nfunds by GLP will be procured following local competitive bidding \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. Advance procurement action and \nretroactive  financing  was  requested  by  GLP  and  approved  by \nADB. \n \n12  person-months  of \ninternational  consulting  services  and \n70 person-months of domestic consulting services will be provided \nto assist GLP with project implementation, including review of the \ndraft  tender  documents  and  evaluation  of  the  bids  received,  and \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  project  impact.  An  additional \ninternational  consulting  services  and \n8 person-months  of \n30 person-months of domestic consulting services will be provided \nfor \nfacilitating \nimplementation  of  heating  tariff  reforms.  All  consultants  will  be \nselected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants and other arrangements for the selection \nand  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  ADB  has  approved \nadvance  recruitment  and  retroactive  financing  of  the  consulting \nservices under the Project. \n \nThe  Project  will  provide  substantial  environmental  and  health \nbenefits.  The  environmental  benefits  from  the  Project  include \nexpected  coal  savings  by  217,500  tons  per  year  (t/yr),  and  the \nemission  reduction  of  total  suspended  particulates  (TSP)  of \n18,800 t/y, sulfur dioxide (SO2) of 2,600 t/y, nitrogen oxides (NOx) \nt/y,  and  greenhouse  gas  of  CO2  equivalent  by \nof  1,700 \n840,900 t/y. Water and soil pollution will be indirectly reduced due \nto lower rates of pollutant transfer from air to water, with reduced \nstress  on  local  ecosystems.  The  quantifiable  local  environmental \nbenefits  over  the  project  life  are  expected  to  be  about  CNY846 \nmillion in net present value at 2003 prices. In addition, the global \nenvironmental benefits of the greenhouse gas reduction (CO2 and \nCBM/CMM)  are  expected  to  be  about  CNY163  million  in  net \npresent  value  at  2003  prices.  Unquantifiable  environmental \nbenefits,  such  as  reduction  in  damage  from  the  waste  water  of \nsmall boilers and gas leaks, are also likely to be significant. \n \n\nimplementing \n\ninstitutional \n\nreforms \n\nand \n\n\f \nRisks and Assumptions \n\nvi \n \n \n\n \n \n\nin  connection \n\nThe  economic  and  financial  internal  rates  of  return  for  the  whole \nProject  are  satisfactory  at  26.3%  (with  local  environmental \nbenefits)  and  8.7%,  respectively.  The  project\u2019s  poverty  impact \nratio is estimated at 13.9%, higher than the 7.4% poor population \nin the project areas.  The Project will create about  7,280  person-\nyears  of  job  opportunities  during  the  project  construction  phase \nand  1,940  full-time  jobs  during  project  operation.  Of  the  total, \n2,910  person-years  of  job  opportunities  will  be  filled  by  the  poor, \nwomen, and minorities with an estimated total of CNY28 million in \nwage payments during the project construction period. In addition, \n780  employment  opportunities  with  CNY8.4  million  of  annual \nwage  payments  are  expected  to  go  to  the  poor,  women,  and \nminorities during project operation.  In addition,  a total of  90,870 \npoor  households  will  benefit  from  a  discount  on  the  gas  and \nheating supply connection fee  (38,900 poor households)  and gas \nand  heating  bills  (51,970  poor  households),  resulting  in  annual \nfees  and \nsavings  of  CNY51.87  million \nCNY28.38 million in discounts on gas and heating bills. \n \nThe  risk  of  insufficient  heating  demand  for  the  Project  is  minimal \nas the gas and central heating supply under the Project is mainly \nto  meet  existing  demand  and  a  small  fraction  of  incremental \ndemand.  It  is  expected  that  macroeconomic  conditions  will \ncontinue to be sound with continuing political stability in the PRC, \nand  strong  economic  performance  in  Liaoning.  The  gas  and \ncentral  heating  supply  under  the  Project  is  based  on  proven \ndesigns  and  conventional  technologies  that  have  been  long \nsuccessfully  used  in  the  PRC;  no  significant  technical  risks  are \nanticipated.  The  risk  of  the  delay  in  loan  effectiveness  and \nconstruction  due  to  late  internal  approval  and  procurement  are \naddressed  by  early  preparation,  timely  submission  of  relevant \ndocuments,  and  procurement  training  for  all  PIAs.  The PIAs will \nbe  subject  to  good  governance  supervision  under  the  project \nperformance management system.  ADB\u2019s  close  involvement  will \nensure  that  competent  consultants  will  be  recruited  on  time.  To \nfully assess the potential project risks, a probabilistic risk analysis \nwas  performed  using  the  \u201cMonte  Carlo\u201d  simulation  technique \nbased on 3,000 simulations for the economic and financial internal \nrates  of  returns  and  the  poverty  impact  ratio.  The  risk  analysis \nconcludes that the Project is robust under future uncertainties and \nthat  the  risks  associated  with  it are minimal and acceptable, and \nthat  the  probability  for  negative  outcomes  for  the  poor  is  also \nminimal. \n\n\f \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\n \n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People's Republic of China (PRC) for the Liaoning Environmental Improvement Project. \nThe  project  framework,  which  outlines  the  goal,  purposes,  outputs,  activities,  and  inputs  is \npresented in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe  PRC  has  severe  environmental  problems,  including  air  pollution  associated with \nrapid  economic  growth,  heavy  reliance  on  coal  as  the  primary  fuel,  and  use  of  obsolete \ntechnology. The State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) estimated that since the \nearly 1990s, pollution has resulted in a loss to the PRC economy of approximately 4% of gross \ndomestic product (GDP). Air pollution accounts for 59% of this loss.1 Liaoning province is one of \nthe provinces in the PRC with severe air pollution problems due to its heavy reliance on coal as \nthe primary fuel for its many heavy industries and small coal-fired heating boilers. Before 2002, \nnone  of  the  major  cities  in  Liaoning  met  the  national  air  quality  standards.  Due  to  the \nGovernment\u2019s  concerted  effort  on  closing down  small and highly polluting  heating  boilers, the \nurban air quality has been improved in recent years. In 2003, seven of 14 cities in Liaoning met \nthe national air quality standards (Appendix 2). Supplementary  Appendix A provides additional \ninformation. \n \nUrban  heating  demand  has  grown  rapidly  due  to  rising  incomes,  privatization  of \n3. \nresidential housing, and housing sector growth. As incomes increase, people living in the cold \nnorthern provinces have demanded more and better heating. Central heating in terms of square \nmeters  (m2)  recorded  an  annual  growth  rate  of  16.1%  between  1992  and  2003.  Nationwide, \nresidential  buildings  account  for  about  70%  of  the  total  space  heating,  and  commercial  and \npublic  buildings  account  for  the  remaining  30%.  Heating  demand  in  Liaoning  has  also  been \ngrowing rapidly during the past decade.  In the PRC, over 60 million tons (t) of coal are burned \nby  500,000  small,  inefficient,  coal-fired  heating  boilers  every  year,  resulting  in  the  emission  of \nsubstantial  amounts  of  sulfur  dioxide  (SO2), carbon dioxide  (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and \ntotal suspended particulates (TSP).  The  majority  of  urban  heating  supplies  in  Liaoning  come \nfrom 5,000 of these boilers, creating severe air pollution problems in urban areas. \n \nThe PRC is the world\u2019s largest coal producer and consumer.  Production of 1,667 million \n4. \nt of raw coal in 2003 accounted for about 33.5% of  global production. Coal accounts for 95% of \nthe nation's primary fossil energy resources and will continue to be the primary energy fuel  for \nthe foreseeable future. Coal production is expected to increase to 1,800 million t in 2004 due to \nthe  increased  demand  for  power  generation  to  meet  rapidly  growing  demand for  power.  In \nLiaoning, coal production was 58 million t in 2003 with over 78 active coal mines with capacity \ngreater than 30,000 t per year (t/y). State-owned coal mines account for 80% of coal production \ncapacity.  In  the  PRC,  the  coal  bed  methane  (CBM)/coal  mine  methane  (CMM)  resources  that \ncould  be  produced  from  coal  mines  up  to  a  depth  of  2,000  meters  are  estimated  at  30  to \n35 trillion cubic meters (m3). \n\n                                                 \n1   Based  on  a  study  by  the  Policy  Research  Center  for  Environment  and  Economy  of  the  State  Environmental \n\nProtection Administration. \n\n\f2 \n\n(iii) promoting \n\nreduce  emissions, \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nB. \n \n5. \nThe  GDP  of  Liaoning  grew  10.2%  annually  in  real  terms  between  1990  and  1995,  and \n8.5% between 1996 and 2003. One main development objective of the government of Liaoning \nprovince  (GLP)  is  to  contain  the  worsening  trend  of  environmental  pollution  and  ecosystem \ndegradation,  and  to  improve  the  environment  in  cities  to  demonstrate  that  rapid  economic \ngrowth  and  a  cleaner  environment  are  compatible.  GLP  will  strengthen  its  control  of  pollutant \ndischarge  by  issuing  regulations  on  total  pollutant  emission  control  and  improving  monitoring \nand  enforcement.  Air  quality  in  cities  will  be  improved  through  the  substitution  of  coal  by  gas \nwhere  feasible,  closing  of  polluting  small  boilers  for  heating,  and  increased  use  of  efficient \ntechnologies  and  management  that  minimize urban pollution.  The  operational  strategy  of  the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB)  in the PRC is aimed at helping the country achieve economic \ngrowth in an efficient, equitable, and sustainable manner. ADB\u2019s energy sector strategy includes \n(i) developing  cleaner  energy  sources,  (ii) renovating  and  retrofitting  existing  facilities  to \nimprove  efficiency  and \nthe  corporatization  and \ncommercialization of energy utilities, and (iv) pricing and tariff reforms. This is complemented \nby  ADB's  strategy  for  the  environment  sector  that  supports the  use  of economic, supply-side, \nand other measures to  (i) ensure  sustainable  utilization  of  natural  resources  and  promotion  of \nmarket-based  pricing  and  (ii) encourage  cost  recovery  and  better  environmental  information \ndisclosure.  GLP  will  improve  air  quality  in    all  major  cities  (including  all  six  project  cities  of \nAnshan,  Benxi,  Fushun,  Fuxin,  Liaoyang,  and  Yingkou)  to  meet  the  national  air  quality \nstandards  by  2010;  the  Project  is  a  major  part  of  the  effort.  By  working  toward  reducing \nemissions,  the  Project  is  consistent  with  and  provides  support  for  addressing  GLP\u2019s \ndevelopment  objectives.  It  is  also  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  energy  and  environmental  strategy \n(Appendix 3). \n \nThe PRC coal mines have high CBM/CMM content.2 Underground methane is a threat to \n6. \nthe safety of coal miners because it is highly explosive. Methane must be removed during and \nsometimes prior to actual coal mining operations to ensure worker safety. Most of the methane \nremoved in mining operations is not used as an energy source but emitted as a greenhouse gas \ninto  the  environment.  Coal  mines  in  the  PRC  released  approximately  6 billion m3 of methane \ninto the atmosphere in 2003 and are expected to release approximately 10 billion m3 by 2010. \nAs a  greenhouse  gas,  methane  is  approximately  21  times  more  potent  than  carbon  dioxide. \nLiaoning produces only 5.5% of the PRC\u2019s coal, but accounts for approximately 20% of national \nmethane emissions due to its geological conditions. Drainage of methane in underground coal \nmines  has  been  undertaken  in  the  PRC  in an attempt  to  ensure  safe production for decades. \nThe  removal  of  methane  from  underground  coal  mines  does  not  always  meet  the  required \nnational standards, and has caused numerous fatal explosions. Under the Project, methane will \nbe  commercially  extracted  as  an  economic  source  of  energy  that  will  be  distributed  to \nhouseholds  and  industries  as  a  fuel.  Efficient  extraction  and  utilization  of  methane  will  help \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve the safety of coal mines, and reduce domestic use \nof coal. \n \n7. \nLiaoning has a population of about 41 million, with 55% living in urban areas. As an  old \nindustrial base of the PRC, its economic structure is dominated by heavy industry with relatively \nold  technology  and  large  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs).3 Because of  its  industrial structure \n                                                 \n2  Methane gas is part of the coal composition and adsorbed within the coal seam. The gas is released as a result of \ntemperature and pressure changes when underground coal is mined or exposed to surface conditions. Methane, \nwhen  released  through  wells  drilled  from  the  surface  into  underground  coal  seams  is  referred  to as CBM. CMM \nrefers to the methane released through mine shafts during underground coal mine operations. \n\n3  SOEs in Liaoning account for about one tenth of the total number of SOEs in the PRC. \n\n\f3 \n\nand  large  urban  population,  Liaoning  is  the  highest  energy-consuming  province  in  the  PRC. \nContinued  strong  economic  growth,  combined  with  a  significant  increase  in  urban  housing \nconstruction,  has  resulted  in  heating  demand  outpacing  supply.  Cities  in  Liaoning  are \nexperiencing  heating  supply  shortages  that  adversely  affect  the  quality  of  life  and  health  of \nurban  residents,  particularly  the  poor.  Liaoning  has  about  3%  of  the  country\u2019s  total population \nbut accounts for about 10% of the total unemployed nationwide, leading to a growing concern \nabout  the  urban  poor  in  Liaoning.  This  reflects  growing  urban  unemployment  brought  about \nmainly  by  SOE  reforms  and  technology  changes,  and  in  particular,  retrenchment  of  excess \nemployees  by  large  SOEs.  The  adverse  effects  of  urban  poverty  are  often  compounded  by \nenvironmental  pollution  from  energy  and  heating  sources  at  the  household  level.  The  poor  do \nnot  have  the  information,  access, or  funds for  more  efficient  (less-polluting)  equipment  and \nfuels.  The  gas  and  heating  distribution systems are usually  badly  functioning  or  absent  in  the \npoorer sections of the city. Poorly maintained gas and heating distribution  systems increase the \nexposure of the poor to daily doses of pollutants as well as to the risk of accidents. Indoor air \npollution particularly puts women and children at risk. By improving the efficiency and capacity \nof  city  gas  and  heating  distribution,  closing  the existing  412  small  heating  boilers  in  Benxi, \nLiaoyang  and  Yingkou  cities,  and  implementing  tariff  reforms  and  special  tariff  reduction \nprograms, the Project will help reduce environmental pollution and ensure that the poor have an \naffordable and sufficient heating supply. \n \nThe  affordability  of  the  poor  for  heating  services  is  a  major  concern  in  Liaoning.  The \n8. \naverage heating bill for a poor household living in a 40 m2 apartment unit is about  CNY167 per \nmonth during the 5-month long heating season. In a typical poor household of  four people, the \nincome  at  the  poverty  line  is  CNY780  per  household  per  month  in  Anshan,  CNY624 in Benxi \nand  Yingkou,  and  CNY728  in  Liaoyang.4  Thus,  the  heating  bill  represents  a  large  portion  of  a \npoor household\u2019s monthly income (21% in Anshan, 23% in Liaoyang, and 27% in Yingkou and \nBenxi). There is a serious affordability problem for poor households with income at or below the \ncity  poverty  lines.  In  the  project  areas  where the temperature in  the winter  can  go  as low as \nminus 35o Celsius, insufficient heating supply will severely affect the quality of life and health of \nthe poor. GLP is making efforts to provide urban minimum living standard and social assistance \nprograms  to  address  the  growing  concern  of  urban  poverty.  Cost  savings  resulting  from  the \nefficiency improvement of the Project will be passed on to the poor in the form of lower gas and \nheating  bill,  and  connection  fee  discounts.  These  programs  will  be  designed  to  alleviate \naffordability problems and ensure sufficient heating for the poor in the project cities. \n \n9. \nThe resources of local governments and those provided by the central Government are \ninadequate to finance the large-scale investments required by rising gas and heating demand.5 \nHowever, so far, the private sector has not been involved in gas distribution systems in the PRC \nand only a few joint ventures have been involved in combined heat and power generation plants \nand  small  CBM/CMM  development  operations.  The  present  conditions  in  these  subsectors  do \nnot provide enough incentives to make them attractive to private investors because (i) coal mine \ncompanies  had  poor  financial  performance  before  2003  due  to  low  coal  prices;  (ii) CBM/CMM \ndevelopment  is  still  in  its  infant  stage  with  perceived  commercial  risks;  (iii) there  are \ntechnical/institutional  uncertainties  involving  city  governments\u2019  control  over  gas  and  heating \ndistribution; (iv) heating  has been considered as part of  the welfare system, leading to poor fee \ncollection; and (v) for gas and heating supply, clear and transparent tariff setting and approval \n\n                                                 \n4  The  poverty  level  defined  by  the  project  cities  under  Part  C  of  the  Project  is CNY195 per capita per month in \n\nAnshan, CNY156 in Benxi and in Yingkou, and CNY182 in Liaoyang. \n\n5  For  instance,  in  Aletai  city  of  Xinjiang  Uygur  Autonomous  Region,  heating  expenditure  was  10.9%  of  the  city's \n\nbudget in 1999. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\ncriteria  and  procedures  are  lacking.  To  encourage  private  sector  participation in areas where \nonly  the  public  sector  had  previously  been  involved,  an  enabling  environment  needs  to  be \ncreated.  ADB  policy  dialogue  in  tariff  reforms  and  institutional  changes  will  promote  private \nsector participation by helping create the enabling environment. \n \n10. \nThe PRC has increased its coal production in the last  2  years to meet the fast-growing \npower  generation  requirements.  Increasing  coal  production  runs  the  risk  of  increasing  the \nalready  high  rate  of  coal  mine  accidents.  The  PRC  has  one  of  the  worst  records  on  mine \nfatalities. According to  official  figures,  in  2002  about  6,900  miners  died  because  of  accidents, \nincluding  266 in  Liaoning.  However,  other  estimates  place  the  figure  above  10,000.6  The \nenforcement  of  mine  safety  and  health  laws  at  the  local  level  is  weak  and  ineffective.  Small \nmine  operators  and  miners  do  not  follow  safety  and  health  best  practices.  The  Labor \nDepartment  of  the  United  States  has  provided  two  grants  totaling  $6.4 million  to  help  worker \nprotection and mine safety in the PRC (Appendix 3). Coal mine safety improvement is a priority \nfor GLP. The Project provides a good opportunity to address the issue of coal mine safety and \nsome safety programs will be incorporated into the project design to improve mine safety. \n \n11. \nDuring  the  2002  Country  Programming  Mission,  the  Government  requested  project \npreparatory technical assistance (PPTA) from ADB to review and upgrade its feasibility study for \nthe Project.7 However, GLP subsequently informed ADB about its concern over the local funding \nfor some subcomponents. The PPTA consultants were not fielded until May 2003. A fact-finding \nmission  visited  the  PRC  from  3  to  20  November  2003,  and  an  appraisal  mission  from  12  to \n27 April 2004. GLP approved the feasibility study reports in September 2004. The project design \ntakes into consideration problem and constraints analysis, lessons learned, and assessment of \nalternative  approaches.  Policy  dialogue  focus  was  formulated  based  on  the  findings  of  ADB \nmissions,  information  provided  by  the  Government,  beneficiary  consultations,  discussions  with \nother funding agencies, and recommendations of the feasibility reports and PPTA consultants. \nThe  Project\u2019s  poverty  classification  is  \u201cother,\u201d  and  the  thematic  objective  is  environmental \nimprovement. \n \n12. \nLessons  Learned.  ADB\u2019s  experience  in  the  PRC\u2019s  energy  sector  has  shown  that \nprojects  are  generally  well  planned  and  implemented  smoothly.  The  overall  implementation \nperformance of ADB\u2019s energy portfolio in the PRC is satisfactory. Compliance with covenants is \ngenerally  acceptable,  although  greater  efforts  are  required  to  implement  policy-related \ncovenants.  Rigorous  government  screening  of  projects  has  had  a  positive  impact.  The  project \ncompletion  and  project  performance  audit  reports  for  the  energy  projects  indicate  that  overall \nthey were implemented smoothly, and assess them all as generally successful. Recently, some \nongoing  energy  projects  in  the  PRC  have  experienced  implementation  delays  relating to long \ninternal approval processes, procurement issues, and large cost savings. \n \nHowever, the project completion reports prepared for three ADB environmental projects \n13. \nand  the  project  performance  audit  reports  for  one  of  the  environmental  projects  revealed  that \nthe  actual  achievements  of  some  heating  supply  components  were  lower  than  estimated  at \nappraisal.  There  were  several  factors,  such  as  lower  demand  for  heating,  insufficient  heat \nsource,  unsuitable design  for switching  from  coal  to  natural  gas,  and  lower  heat  and  power \ntariffs than anticipated at the project appraisal. Some projected industrial establishments either \ndid not materialize  or  lacked  the  financial  capacity  to  pay  for  heating services. Some heating \n\n                                                 \n6  Small-scale coal mines with a production of not more than 300,000 t a year, which account for about 50% of total \n\nannual coal production, are responsible for about 70% of the accidents. \n\n7  The PPTA was approved in September 2002 and the TA letter was signed in January 2003. \n\n\f5 \n\ncomponents  were  canceled  when  no  noticeable  progress  was  made  and  after  the  project \nimplementation  agencies  realized  that  the  projected  market  for  steam  and  heat  usage  was \noverly  optimistic.  In  addition,  the  design  to  switch    these  heating  companies\u2019 fuel source from \ncoal to natural gas would have seriously affected their financial viability and would have required \nlarge  government  subsidies.  The  lower  heat  and  power  tariffs  coupled  with  the  lower \nachievements  have  prevented  the  project  entities  from  achieving  good  financial  performance. \nThe Project will aim to ensure the viability and sustainability of heating supply by incorporating \nthese lessons in project design, preparation, risk assessment, and implementation. The Project \nhas  also  been  discussed  with  other  development partners  involved  or  interested  in  CMM  and \nCBM  mitigation, and  in  efficiency  and  safety  improvement  activities  in  the  coal  sector.  The \nProject has been presented at various conferences and workshops where it was also discussed \nwith private sector parties involved in CBM exploration.8 Appendix 3 presents a summary of the \nexternal  assistance  and  lessons  learned.  Supplementary  Appendix B  provides  additional \ninformation. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\nObjectives \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n \nA. \n \n14. \nThe long-term goal of the Project is to support environmental improvement in Liaoning. \nThe  main  objectives  of  the  Project  are:  (i) improvement  in  efficiency  and  reliability  of  gas  and \ncentral heating supply and closure of small coal-fired boilers, and (ii) production and commercial \nutilization of CMM and CBM. Policy dialogue with the Government during project processing has \nfocused  on:  (i) maximizing  benefits  to  the  poor  and  ensuring  that  the  poor  have  sufficient \nheating by establishing specific gas and heating assistance programs, (ii) implementing market-\nbased heating tariff reforms and improving billing collection in project cities, and (iii) promoting \nprivate sector participation. \n \nB. \n \n15. \nThe  proposed  Project  comprises  the  following  components:  Part  A:  CBM/CMM \ndevelopment; Part B: gas distribution improvement; Part C: city central heating supply; and Part \nD:  institutional  reforms  and  corporate  governance  improvement.  The  feasibility  studies  and \nengineering  design  for  the  project  subcomponents  were  prepared  by  several  design  and \nengineering  institutes  in  the  PRC  with  experience  and  qualifications  acceptable  to  ADB.  The \nPPTA  consultants  reviewed  the  feasibility  study  reports  and  other  supplementary  documents \nand noted that their previous comments were reflected in the project design and were satisfied \nwith the quality of the feasibility studies and engineering design. \n \n16. \nPart A: Coal Bed Methane and Coal Mine Methane  Development. Part A will install in \nFuxin coalmine areas (i) 22 vertical wells, (ii) one 54,000 m3, one 10,000 m3 and one 5,000 m3 \nabove-ground  methane  gas  storage  tanks,  and  (iii)  three  CBM  extraction  stations.  This \ncomponent  will  produce  46 million m3  of  CBM/CMM  annually  and  increase  residential  and \nindustrial use of CBM/CMM. \n \n17. \nPart  B:  Gas  Distribution  Improvement.  Part  B  consists  of  two  subcomponents: \n(i) Fushun  gas  distribution  improvement,  and  (ii) Benxi  gas  distribution  improvement.  The \n\n                                                 \n8 \n\nIncluding  the Department for International Development,  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation,  Japan  Coal \nEnergy Center, United Nations Development Programme, United States Environmental Protection Agency,  United \nStates Labor Department, and World Bank. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nsubcomponent in Fushun city will (i) replace 15.5 kilometers (km) of aging CMM gas pipelines, \nand  (ii) improve  45  pressure  regulation  stations  to  reduce  excessive  pipeline  CMM  gas  losses \nand  accidents  and  to  increase  capacity  to  serve  5,000  new  households  annually.  The \nsubcomponent  in  Benxi  city  will  (i) replace  43  km  of  aging  coke  oven  gas  pipelines,  and \n(ii) install  5  km  of  new  coke oven  gas  pipeline  to  cut  down  pipeline  losses  and  accidents  and \nserve 60,000 new households. \n \n18. \nPart  C:  City  Central  Heating  Supply.  Part  C  has  four  subcomponents, consisting of \ncentral  heating  supply  for  each  of Anshan,  Benxi,  Liaoyang,  and  Yingkou.  The  Anshan \nsubcomponent in Anshan city includes (i) recovery of the waste heat from Anshan Steel No. 1 \nnew  blast  furnace,  (ii) recovery  of  the  heat  from  the  No.  2  thermal  power  plant,  and \n(iii) construction of a household heat supply control system. The Benxi subcomponent in Benxi \ncity will: (i) construct two 209-gigajoule (GJ)/hour circulating fluidized-bed  hot water boilers and \nauxiliaries; (ii) construct 7 km of heat supply pipeline; (iii) construct 18 heat exchange stations; \nand (iv) close 63 existing small, inefficient, and polluting boilers. The Liaoyang subcomponent in \nLiaoyang  city  will:  (i) construct  eight  208 GJ/hour  hot  water  boilers  and  auxiliary  facilities; \n(ii) construct  4.2 km  of  heat  distribution  network  and  55  heat  exchange  stations; and  (iii) close \n174 existing small, inefficient, and polluting boilers. The Yingkou subcomponent in Yingkou city \nwill: (i) construct  one (2 x 12 MW) combined heat and power  generation plant and auxiliaries; \n(ii) construct  three  104  GJ/hour  hot  water  boilers;  (iii) construct  40  km  of  heat  supply  and \ndistribution network and 12 heat exchange stations; and (iv) close 175 existing small, inefficient, \nand polluting boilers. \n \n19. \nPart D: Institutional Reforms and Corporate Governance Improvement. In 2003, an \ninstitutional reform and corporate governance improvement study was carried out by the PPTA \nconsultants  to  assess  the  institutional  capacity  and  corporate  governance  of  each  project \nimplementation  agency  (PIA)  and  develop  an  institutional  reform  action  plan  for  each  PIA \n(Supplementary  Appendixes  C  and  D).  In  April  2004,  a  financial  reform  action  plan \n(Supplementary  Appendix  L)  was  prepared  by  the  PPTA  consultants  for  addressing  cost \nreduction,  bill  collection,  and  financial  capacity  of  the  PIAs .  The  reform  action  plans  were \ndiscussed  and  supported  by  the  PIAs.  To  help  the  PIAs  strengthen  commercial and financial \nmanagement  capacity,  Part  D  comprises:  (i) institutional  strengthening  and  training  for \nimplementing the institutional reform action plans and the financial action plans prepared by the \nPPTA  consultants,  (ii) assistance  to  the  PIAs  to  implement  the  heating  tariff  reforms,  and \n(iii) development of options for  private  sector  participation.  The  institutional  reform  will  require \nseparation  of  government \nthe  PIAs,  and \ntransforming  the  noncorporate  PIAs  into  new  corporate  structures  according  to  the  PRC\u2019s \nCompany Law. The financial reforms will assist all the PIAs to build capacity in cost reduction, \nbill collection, efficient accounting, and commercial management. The consultants  will help the \nPIAs prepare tariff reform action plans in accordance with the recommendations made by  ADB \nTA  3673-PRC:  Pro-poor  Urban  Heating  Tariff  Reforms.9 The TA  formulated  national  pro-poor \nnational  heating  tariff  guidelines  and  established  the  principles  of  an  effective  heating  tariff \ncollection  mechanism.  The  consultants  under  Part  D  will  study  the  options  for  private  sector \nparticipation for the PIAs selected by GLP. The options developed and implemented will provide \na  demonstration  on  how  public  utilities  can  be  privatized  without  lowering  the  quality  of  utility \n\nfrom  commercial  management  of \n\nfunctions \n\n                                                 \n9   The Executing Agency for the TA is the Ministry of Construction. The objective of the TA is to help the Government \nreform the urban heating sector and promote sustainable urban heating supply in the PRC by (i) formulating pro-\npoor national heating tariff guidelines, and (ii) establishing an effective heating tariff collection mechanism. The TA \nhas been nearly completed with the tripartite meeting held in August 2004. \n\n\f7 \n\nSpecial Features \n\nsupply.  The  Project  will  provide  a  further  opportunity  for  ADB  to  address  policy  concerns  and \nhelp create a conducive environment for private sector participation. \n \nC. \n \n20. \nUrban  Heating  Tariff  Reforms.  Heating  tariff  reforms  are  required  to  improve  and  to \nsustain  urban  heating  supply.  The  current  average  heating  tariff  of  about  CNY20/m2  for  the \nheating  season  in  Liaoning  is  not  low.10  Therefore,  tariff  reforms  need  to  focus  on  the  tariff \nstructure and collection. At present, all  of the urban heating tariffs are based  on a simple fixed \nrate  per  square  meter  (e.g.,  CNY/m2)  of  the  living  area  or  construction  area  of  buildings.  The \ncurrent heating tariff structure, payment, and collection systems have many problems including \nthe following: (i) tariffs do not reflect the cost of providing heating services, (ii) the tariff structure \ndoes not encourage efficient use of heat, (iii) the enterprise-based tariff payment system is not \nmarket-oriented and causes difficulty in tariff collection, and (iv) a lack of transparent criteria and \nmethodologies for  tariff  setting  and  adjustment. In addition, the layout of  the  piping system in \nexisting buildings makes it difficult for the heating company to disconnect supply to delinquent \ncustomers. In Liaoning, heating bills are generally paid by employers for their employees. In the \nmid-1990s, many SOEs became financially unviable and could not pay the heating bills for their \nemployees. This caused tariff collection to drop to 60%, creating severe financial difficulties for \nthe heating companies. Tariff collection improved to 80\u201385% in 2003 and a further improvement \nto 95% is expected with the Project. \n \n21. \nTo  address  these  issues,  GLP  will  implement  the  agreed  heating  tariff  reforms  in  the \nproject cities (Supplementary Appendix E). The consultants under Part D will help remove  the \nbarriers  and develop specific reform action plans for: (i) installing lock valves in apartment units \nin  buildings  to  help  improve  tariff  collection  efficiency,  (ii) installing  radiator  control  valves  in \napartment  units  to  encourage  heat  conservation,  (iii) implementing  a  two-part  heating  tariff  so \nthat the variable charge will be based on actual heat consumption, (iv) installing heat-measuring \ndevices  in  apartment  units  to  support  consumption-based  billing  systems,  and  (v) training of \nheating company staff on implementation of reform measures. After the reforms, consumers will \nhave  the  ability  to  regulate  the  amount  of  heat  that  they  consume.  This  is  essential  for  tariff-\nbased incentives for heat conservation, installing insulation, and taking measures to reduce heat \nloss  to  work.  All  new  buildings  in  Liaoning  are  now  required  to  follow  new  building codes and \nuse energy-efficient building materials. \n \n22.  Maximizing  the  Project\u2019s  Impact  on  the  Poor.  In  the  project  cities,  heating  bills \ncurrently account for 21% to 27% of the average monthly incomes of poor households. Though \nimproving  facilities  and  supply  efficiency  will  likely obviate  further  tariff  increases,  measures \nneed to be taken to make gas and heating more affordable to the poor. GLP agreed to include \ntwo  specific  programs.  The  first  program  will  require  the  PIAs  to  provide  gas  and  heating \nconnection  and  tariff  discounts  to  the  poor,  based  on  the  benefits  of  the cost savings  arising \nfrom  the  20%  efficiency  improvement  and  increase  to  95%  bill  collection.  Each  PIA  has \ncommitted  to  share  the  benefits  and  extend  the  discount  to  the  poor  after  satisfying  the  loan \nconditions. They estimate that 90,870 poor households will benefit from the discount on gas and \nheating supply connection fee (38,900 poor households) and gas and heating bills (51,970 poor \nhouseholds),  resulting  in  an  annual  benefit  of  CNY20 million  in  connection  fees,  and \nCNY12 million in discounts on gas and heating bills. This will be about 4% of the total revenue \nof the gas and heating companies after the Project is complete. The second program requires \n\n                                                 \n10  The  heating  tariff  of  CNY20/m 2  in  Liaoning  is  comparable  with  about  CNY24/m 2  in  Beijing,  CNY20/m 2  in \n\nHeilongjiang, and CNY19.5/m 2 in Xinjiang. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nthe city governments to establish a \u201cheating assistance fund\u201d for the poor. It will be included in \nthe  city\u2019s  annual  budget  and  the  funding  level  will  not  depend  on  budget  availability. The  city \ngovernment\u2019s  subsidies  through  the  heating  assistance  fund  will  be  designed  so  that  a  poor \nhousehold\u2019s heating  expenses  do  not  exceed  5%  of  its  monthly  expenditure (compared with \nheating  expenditure  of  3.8%  for  low-income  households  in  the  United  States).  Further,  the \nrecently approved TA  (TA 4402-PRC: Heating Supply for Urban Poor in Liaoning Province) will \nhelp  GLP  implement    pro-poor  national  heating  tariff  guidelines  and  improve  tariff  collection; \ndesign  heating  assistance  programs  for  the  poor;  and  develop  an  effective  monitoring, \nsupervision,  and  evaluation  system  at  the  provincial  and  local  levels.  It  will  also  examine  the \npossibility  of  a  lifeline  tariff.  To  make  heating  affordable,  about  CNY48 million  will  be  provided \nthrough the heating assistance fund. In case there is a shortfall under the first program from the \nPIAs  due  to  a  delay  in  realizing  project  benefits,  the  city  governments  will  increase  the \ncontribution to cover the gap. These assistance programs are consistent with ADB\u2019s policy that \ntariff  subsidies  to  the  poor  be  transparent  and  explicit,  and  funded  by  the  government  budget, \nwhich will separate the welfare objective from the commercial management of the public utilities. \n \nClosure  of  Small  Coal-Fired  Heat  Boilers.  The  Project  will  build  large  and  efficient \n23. \n(above  80%  combustion  efficiency)  heating  boilers  equipped  with  modern  pollution  control \ndevices to facilitate the closure of 412 small coal-fired heating boilers. These small boilers have \nlow thermal efficiency in the range of 55% to 65% and do not have adequate pollution-control \ndevices.  Furthermore,  the  chimneys  of  small  boilers  are  not  tall  enough  to  disperse  the \nemissions  from  coal  burning  away  from  residential  areas,  creating  severe  urban  pollution \nproblems.  The  environmental  benefits  from  the  closure  include  the  emission  reduction  of  TSP \nby 18,200  tons per year (t/y); SO2 by 2,500 t/y; NOx by 1,700 t/y; and CO2 by 437,400 t/y. The \nquantifiable  local  environmental  benefits  over  the  project  life  are  expected  to  be  about \nCNY823.8 million  in  net  present  value  at  2003  prices.  In  addition,  the  global  environmental \nbenefits from  CO2 reduction  are  expected  to  be  about  CNY90.3 million in net present value at \n2003  prices.11  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  social  protection  strategy,  GLP  and  the  PIAs  will \nensure that all 1,874 workers affected by the closure are reemployed in a timely manner and in \naccordance  with  the  reemployment  action  plan  prepared  by  the  PIAs  (Supplementary \nAppendix F), so that they will be at least as well off as they would have been in the absence of \nthe Project. \n \n24. \nPotential Clean  Development  Mechanism  Benefits.  The  Project  has the potential to \nprovide  certified  emission  reductions  under  the  clean  development  mechanism  (CDM).  The \nProject  will  help  (i) remove  policy  barriers \nto  CMM/CBM  development,  (ii) overcome \ntechnological  barriers  to  efficient  extraction  and  production  of  CMM/CBM,  and  (iii) remove \nfinancial  barriers  for  the  use  of  CMM/CBM  as  fuel.  Emission  reductions  will  be  achieved  by \nreducing  methane  venting  to  the  atmosphere.  At the request of the  Executing  Agency  (EA)\u2014\nnamely,  GLP\u2014ADB  will  provide  further  assistance  with  the  development  of  a  project  concept \nnote  and  a  project  design  document.  ADB  (through  its  CDM  Facility),  the  EA,  and  the \nGovernment  will  cooperate  in  development,  validation,  and  registration  of  the  emission \nreductions that will result from the Project, and  ADB's CDM Facility will also assist in marketing \nthe certified emission reductions. A complete outline of the services to be extended by the CDM \nFacility is provided in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n25. \nImprovement  of  Coal  Mine  Safety.  By  extracting  methane  from  coal  mines,  the \nCBM/CMM  development component  under  the  Project  is  expected to  reduce the  number of  \n\n                                                 \n11  The calculation is based on the environmental externality cost as defined in ADB. 1996. Workbook on Economic \n\nEvaluation of Environmental Impacts. Manila. It is estimated at CNY33.9 per ton of CO2. \n\n\f9 \n\ncoal mine accidents in Liaoning.12 The PIA  agreed to strengthen its coal mine safety programs \nidentified  by  the  PPTA  consultants.  These  programs,  which  will  be  implemented  at  the \nCBM/CMM extraction and utilization facilities, include: (i) improving safety training of miners and \ninspectors,  (ii) upgrading  automatic  methane  detection  systems,  (iii) making  more  frequent \nsafety  inspections  and  drills,  and  (iv) providing  more  frequent  updates  of  the  mine  safety \nprograms.  The  specific  safety  programs,  with  a  goal  of  improving  the  overall  coal  mine  safety \nindex by at least 20%. \n \nD. \n \n26. \nProject cost estimates are summarized in Table 1 and  are detailed in Appendix 4. The \ntotal  project  cost  is  $161.0 million  equivalent,  including  physical  and  price  contingencies,  and \nfinancial  charges  during  development.  Of  the  total  amount,  the  foreign  exchange  costs  are \n$76.0 million, or about 47%. \n \n\nCost Estimates \n\nTable 1: Project Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrencya \n\nTotal \nCost \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nItem \nI. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nII. \n \n\nBase Cost \n1.

The  loan  will  have  a   \n25-year term including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of \n0.75%  per  annum,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and \n\n                                                 \n12  About 80% of coal mine accidents in the PRC are attributable to methane explosions. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nProject Agreements. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to \nborrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  on  the  basis  of  these  terms  and  conditions, \nand (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in \nreliance  on  any  communication  or  advice  from  ADB.  The remaining foreign exchange cost of \n$6 million will be financed with equity form the PIAs.  The local costs amounting to $85.0 million \nequivalent will be financed with equity from the respective PIAs and with loans from local banks. \nThe  loans  from  local  banks  will  have  a  repayment  period  of  14  to  15  years,  including  a  grace \nperiod of  4 to 5 years, and carry an interest rate of about 5.8% per year. The Borrower will be \nthe  PRC,  which  will  make  the  proceeds  of  the  loan  available  to  GLP  on  the  same  terms  and \nconditions as those of the loan. GLP will onlend the proceeds of the loan in amounts relating to \nthe  subcomponents  to  the  respective  PIAs  which  will  carry  out  these  subcomponents  on  the \nsame terms and conditions as the loan. The PIAs will assume the foreign exchange and interest \nvariation risks of the loan. \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nSource \n\nEquity \n\nFuxin CBM/CMM Development and Utilization Company \nFushun Gas General Company \nBenxi Gas General Company \nAnshan General Heating Company \nBenxi General Heating Company \nLiaoyang Real Estate Heating Company \nYingkou Heating Company \n\nLoans \n\nAsian Development Bank \nLocal Banks  \nTotal \n\nForeign \nExchange \n6.00 \n1.53 \n0.16 \n0.27 \n0.92 \n0.53 \n1.36 \n1.23 \n70.00 \n70.00 \n0.00 \n76.00 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n54.26 \n7.79 \n0.72 \n1.54 \n5.33 \n2.16 \n11.23 \n25.49 \n30.74 \n0.00 \n30.74 \n85.00 \n\n   Total \n    Cost \n60.26 \n9.32 \n0.89 \n1.81 \n6.25 \n2.69 \n12.59 \n26.72 \n100.74 \n70.00 \n30.74 \n161.00 \n\n% \n\n37.4 \n5.8 \n0.6 \n1.1 \n3.9 \n1.7 \n7.8 \n16.6 \n62.6 \n43.5  \n19.1 \n100.0  \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nCBM = coal bed methane, CMM = coal mine methane. \nSource: Financing plan of the executing agency. \n \nF. \n \n28. \nProject  Management.  GLP will be the  EA for the Project. The subcomponents will be \nimplemented  by  various  PIAs.  A  project  management  office  (PMO)  will  be  responsible  for \nmanaging,  coordinating,  and  supervising  implementation  of  all  project  subcomponents.  Each \nPIA  will  establish  a  project  implementation  office  (PIO)  to  be  directly  responsible for design, \nconstruction, and operation of subprojects. \n \n29. \nImplementation Period.  It  is  envisaged  that  the  construction  of  the  project  facilities  will \ntake  place  over  a  period  of  more  than  4  years  beginning  in  early  2005,  and  that  project \ncomponents will be completed by March 2009. Site preparation for some heating facilities has \nbeen completed while the routing of the transmission and distribution pipelines and the location \nof  the  related  facilities  have  been  finalized.  The  project  implementation  schedule  is  in \nAppendix 5. \n \n30. \nProcurement. All goods under the Project to be wholly or partly financed by ADB will be \nprocured in accordance with  ADB's Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Civil  works  contracts costing \nmore than $5 million and each supply contract costing more than $500,000 financed by ADB will \nbe procured through international competitive bidding procedures using ADB\u2019s standard bidding \ndocuments. Other supply contract packages costing less than $500,000 will be procured using \n\n\f11 \n\ninternational  shopping  procedures.  Civil  works  contracts  costing  $5 million  or  less  will  be \nprocured  through  local  competitive  bidding.  All  locally  financed  items  will  be  procured  using \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. A list of procurement packages and their modes of procurement \nare  in  Appendix  6.  The  GLP  will  set  up  an  imprest  account  after  loan  effectiveness  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (January 2001). Disbursements from  the \nimprest  account  will  be  supported  by  an  appropriate  withdrawal  application  and  related \ndocumentation.  Such  documentation  will  demonstrate,  among  other  things,  that  the  goods \nand/or services are (i) produced in and procured from ADB's members, and (ii) eligible for ADB \nfinancing. The initial amount to be deposited into the imprest accounts will be $5.0 millions. The \nstatement  of  expenditures  procedure  may  be  used  for  reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures \nand  individual  payment  to  be  reimbursed  or  liquidated  under  the  procedure  will  not  exceed \n$100,000. \n \n31. \nConsulting  Services.  International  and  domestic  consultants  financed  under  the  loan \nwill  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants. For  project \nimplementation  supervision,  international  and  domestic  consultants  will  be  engaged  to  assist \nGLP  and  the  PIAs  with  (i) project  design  and  engineering,  (ii) procurement,  (ii) construction \nsupervision  related  to  equipment  and  materials  procured  under  ADB  financing,  (iii) project \nmanagement, and (iv) monitoring the Project\u2019s impact and reporting to ADB and GLP. The terms \nof  reference  for  the  implementation  supervision  consulting  services  have  been  prepared \n(Supplementary  Appendix  H).  About  12  person-months  of  international  and  70  person-months \nof domestic consulting services will be required.13 International and domestic consultants will be \nrecruited for institutional reforms and  the corporate governance improvement subcomponent of \nthe  Project,  which  includes  institutional  training  and  a  study  to  implement  the  restructuring  of \nheating  tariffs  in  project  cities.  The  terms  of  reference  for  consulting  services  have  been \nprepared  (Supplementary  Appendix  I).  It  is  envisaged  that  about  8  person-months  of \ninternational  consulting  services  and  about  30  person-months of domestic consulting services \nwill be required. Further, some  domestic consultants will be engaged by the PMO and the PIOs \nfor  site  supervision  and  various  tasks  relating to  project  implementation.  They  will  have  the \nqualifications and experience acceptable to ADB. GLP was informed of the selection procedures \nof the quality and cost-based selection method. \n \nDisbursement  Arrangements.  The  Government  and  GLP  will  adopt  either  of  the \n32. \nfollowing  disbursement  procedures  for  withdrawal  of  proceeds  of  the  loan  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook:  (i) a  direct  payment  procedure,  wherein  ADB,  at  the \nrequest  of  the  Government,  pays  a  designated  beneficiary  directly;  or  (ii) a  commitment \nprocedure,  wherein  ADB,  at  the  request  of  the  Government,  provides  an  undertaking  to \nreimburse a commercial bank for payments made or to be made to a supplier against a letter of \ncredit  financed  from  the  loan  account.  The  disbursement  of  the  amount  of  the  loan  proceeds \nrequired  for  a  subproject  will  be  subject  to  the condition  that the onlending agreement for the \nconcerned  subcomponent  in  form  and  substance  acceptable  to  ADB  has  been  duly  executed \nand  delivered,  and  is  legally  binding  on the parties thereto. The reimbursement procedure will \nbe used for disbursements with regard to any eligible retroactive financing. The executing and \ndelivery  of  an  onlending  agreement  is  a  condition  to  disbursement  of  loan  proceeds  to  that \nsubcomponent. \n \n33. \nAdvance  Procurement  Action  and  Retroactive  Financing.  In  view  of  the  advanced \nstage of project preparation, ADB has agreed to advance procurement action and has agreed in \n\n                                                 \n13  About 20 person-months of domestic consulting services will be provided to develop benchmarks and indicators \n\nfor the economic, social, and environmental impact of the Project. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nprinciple to retroactive financing for up to $7.0 million (equivalent to 10% of the ADB loan)  with \nregard  to  payment  of  consulting  services  and  procurement  contracts  awarded  from  October \n2004 up to loan effectiveness of the Project.14 \n \nAccounting,  Auditing,  and  Reporting.  The  accounting,  auditing,  and  reporting \n34. \nsystems  and  procedures  for  the  Project  will  be  in  accordance  with  the  Guidelines  for  the \nFinancial Governance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by ADB. Each PIA will \nmaintain separate accounts of their operations and of the Project  and submit through the PMO \nto  ADB  audited  project  accounts  and  agency  financial  statements  in  English  not  later  than \n6 months  after  the  end  of  the  financial  year.  The  Government,  GLP,  and  the  PIAs  have  been \ninformed  about  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  submission  of  audited  financial  statements  and  possible \npenalties for delays in submission. The submitted audited project accounts and agency financial \nstatements  should  be  of  acceptable  quality  and  should  be  prepared  in  accordance  with \ninternationally  accepted  accounting  standards.  Financial  statements  with  adverse  opinions  of \ndisclaimers  from  auditors  are  considered  unacceptable  and  cannot  be  submitted  for  this \npurpose.  GLP  and  the  PIAs  through  the  PMO  will  also submit to ADB reports and information \nconcerning the use of the loan proceeds, project implementation, and the performance of each \nPIA. The reports will include (i) quarterly progress reports on project implementation, and (ii) a \nproject  completion  report  not  later  than  3  months  after  completion  of  the  project  facilities.  The \nPIAs  will  finance  the  annual  audits  to  be  carried  out  by  auditing  firms  with  experience  and \nqualifications acceptable to ADB. \n \n35. \nAnticorruption.  ADB\u2019s  rules  and  practices   were  explained  to  GLP,  and  ADB  standard \nbidding  documents  and  guidelines  for  tender  evaluation  were  handed  over  to  GLP.  Attention \nwas  drawn  to  the  sections  on  fraud  and  corruption    that  were  added  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for \nProcurement  and  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants,  particularly  the  need  for  bidders, \nsuppliers,  contractors,  and  consultants  to  observe  the  highest  standards  of  ethics  in  the \nprocurement and execution of contracts, and the sanctions to be applied if fraud and corruption \nare  discovered.  The  relevant  sections  of  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  will  be  included  in  all \ndocuments  and  contracts  during  bidding  and  implementation  of  the  Project.  Items  financed  by \nthe PIAs with local currency funds will be procured following bidding procedures acceptable to \nADB.  For  the  Project,  GLP  will  take  the  following  anticorruption  actions:  (i) involving  full-time \nofficials  from  the  Liaoning  Development  and  Reform  Commission\u2019s  supervision  division  in \nbidding,  construction,  and  operations;  and  (ii) carrying  out  periodic  inspections  of  the \ncontractors\u2019 activities related to fund withdrawals and settlements. \n \nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation. A project performance management \n36. \nsystem   (PPMS)  was  developed  by  GLP  with  the  assistance  of  the  PPTA  consultants \n(Supplementary  Appendix  J).  The  PPMS  includes  a  set  of  measurable  indicators  that  were \ndeveloped  based  on  the  project  design,  impacts,  and  risks.  The  macroeconomic  and  sector \nperformance,  institutional  capacity,  and  reforms  were  taken  into  account  in  designing  the \nmonitoring  indicators.  These  indicators  are  also  presented  in  the  project  framework.  The \nindicators cover environmental impacts, e.g., greenhouse gas (including CO2 and methane gas), \nTSP,  SO2,  and  NOx  emissions;  social  and  poverty  impacts  focusing  on  new  job  creation;  the \nnumber of poor households to be provided with central heating and gas services; and heating \nbill  assistance  and  discounts.  A  feedback  and  reporting  mechanism  for  effective  project \nimplementation  and  initial  startup  activities,  including  a  baseline  survey  based  on  a  random \nhousehold sample to be monitored with the follow-up surveys, was included in the PPMS.  The \n\n                                                 \n14  The advance action was published in the Internet edition of ADB Business Opportunities of October 2004 and in \n\nits printed version of November 2004.  \n\n\f13 \n\nimplementation  consultants  will  carry  out  the  monitoring  of  the  project  impacts  during  the \nimplementation  period.  GLP  and  the  PIAs  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  the  progress  of \nimplementation  of  the  environmental  mitigation  plan  through  quarterly  progress  reports  and \nreports on achievement of resettlement, environmental, and social objectives to be submitted on \ncompletion  and  1  year  thereafter.  A  longer-term  monitoring  plan  beyond  the  project \nimplementation  period  will  be  developed  by  the  consultants  and  implemented  by  GLP.  The \nconsultants will establish an effective monitoring and evaluation system to monitor the impact of \nthe Project, which will  provide the basis for GLP\u2019s impact monitoring after  project completion. \nThe monitoring and evaluation system will include specific and measurable targets, and identify \nkey  risks  and  institutional  arrangements  for  effective  monitoring.  The  consultants  will  also \nprovide the necessary training on monitoring. \n \nProject Review\u2014Project Implementing Agencies and  Financial Performance. All PIAs \n37. \nare SOEs established either under the PRC\u2019s Enterprise Law or the Company Law. The Fuxin \nCDM/CMM  Development  and  Utilization  Company  is  a  subsidiary  of  Fuxin  Mining  Group \nCompany  and  has  been  in  commercial  operation  for  3  years.  The  two  gas  distribution \ncompanies,  Fushun  Gas  General  Company  and  Benxi  Gas  General  Company, have supplied \ngas  to  the  respective  cities  for  many  years.  Similarly,  the  four  heating  companies,  Anshan \nGeneral  Heating  Company,  Benxi  General  Heating  Company,  Liaoyang  Real  Estate  Heating \nCompany,  and  Yingkou  Heating  Company,  were  established  in  1981,  1999,  1984  and  1993, \nrespectively. The PIAs follow the accounting system prescribed by the PRC, which is oriented \ntoward  internationally  accepted  accounting  standards.  An  external  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB \nwill be selected to audit the project and company financial statements. \n \nThe  financial  statements  (1999  to  2003)  and  projected  financial  performance  (2004  to \n38. \n2009)  of  the  individual  PIAs  are  given  in  Supplementary  Appendix  K  and  a  summary  is  in \nAppendix 7. The financial performance of the PIAs has resulted either in small losses or modest \nprofits.  The  initial  operations  (development  stage)  of  the  Fuxin  CDM/CMM Development and \nUtilization Company broke  even, which will improve with the Project because the methane gas \nhas  a  good  market.  The  company  has  finalized,  in  principle,  gas  sale  agreements  with  large \ncustomers. The two gas distribution companies cited inappropriate tariff structures and levels as \nthe  main  reason  for  the  marginal  performance.  With  active  policy  dialogue,  Fushun  city \ngovernment approved the required tariff adjustment in September 2004, which will be effective \nfrom 1 November 2004. In Benxi, gas is supplied from a local steel mill and the city government \nhas  agreed  to  pass  through  any  future  price  increase.  The  main  problems  of  the  four  heating \ncompanies  are  poor  collection,  operational  inefficiency,  and  expenditure related to  their  social \nrole.  Installation  of  lock  valves  and  heat  meters  in  apartment  units  has  already  improved \ncollection efficiency substantially, from a historical low of 60%, to 70% in 2001 and to 80\u201385% in \n2003.  The  PPTA  consultants  reviewed  the  PIAs\u2019  financial  performance  and  cited  certain \noperational inefficiencies common to SOEs (Supplementary Appendix L). The PIAs have started \nimplementing  the  recommended  measures  to  improve  the  financial  performance. The Project \nwill  address  concerns  regarding  high  distribution  losses  and  inefficient  small  boilers.  Other \nareas that need cost reduction are personnel productivity; coal, electricity and utility costs; and \nthe  social  costs  borne  by  the  enterprises.  GLP  is  very  supportive  of  gas  and  heating  tariff \nadjustments  and  institutional  reforms  because  of  its  thrust  on  cleaning  up  air  pollution.  It  is \nfocusing  on  separating  the  utilities  from  the  government\u2019s  function  (including  transparent \nsubsidies  for  their  social  role),  which  will  make  them  financially  viable  and  independent \ncorporations.  Further,  the  heating  companies  will  substantially  increase  the  consumer  base \nwhen  independent  small  boilers  are  shut  down,  as  agreed  under  the  Project.  The  gas  and \nheating companies have little  long-term debt since most of the assets were transferred to them \nas  government  equity.  Hence,  debt-equity  ratios  are  favorable  and  debt  servicing  is  not  a \n\n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\nconcern at present. Overall, increases in heating sales, implementation of heating tariff  reforms \n(paras.  20  and  21),  and  improvements  in  operational  efficiency  will  improve  the  profitability  of \nthe heating companies and allow them to meet the financial targets. \n \nImplementation of the Project will make the gas and heating companies more  attractive. \n39. \nTheir  profitability  and  financial  sustainability  will  also  improve  because  of  ADB\u2019s  assistance  in \nheating-tariff,  financial,  and  institutional  reforms.  This  will  help  increase  private  sector interest. \nGLP  has  agreed  to  promote  the  privatization  of  PIAs,  particularly  through  a  stock  exchange \nlisting.  It  will  prepare  a  privatization  plan  for  the  PIAs  by  2006,  which  will  be  developed  in \nconsultation with the city governments and with inputs from the consultants for Part D. \n \n40. \nProject  Review\u2014Environmental  Measures.  The  Project  is  classified  as  environment \ncategory  B.  A  summary  initial  environmental  examination  (summary  IEE)  is  included  in \nAppendix 8. The Project  has substantial environmental benefits resulting from energy efficiency \nimprovements, reduction in  greenhouse  gas emissions, and reduction in emissions from coal \nburning. Potential adverse impacts were assessed during project preparation and are temporary \nand  localized  during  construction.  The  PIAs  will  implement  prudent  construction  management \npractices  to  minimize  any  construction  impacts.  These  include:  (i) limiting  the  clearing  of \nvegetation  and  other  construction  activities  to  avoid  any  unnecessary  disturbance  to  the \nsurrounding residents and vegetation; (ii) construction wastes and debris will be placed only in \ndesignated  disposal  areas;  (iii) restoring  and  revegetating  after construction  any disturbed or \nexcavated areas during construction; (iv) implementing strict erosion and dust control measures, \nincluding  limiting  the  speed  of  construction  trucks,  frequent  watering  of the dirt access roads, \nand other measures; (v) restricting the hours and speeds of  construction trucks and equipment \nto  minimize  impacts  on  nearby  residents;  (vi) demolishing  412  small  heating  boilers  and \ndisposing of wastes  in compliance with  environmental  standards  and  guidelines  of  the  PRC, \nLiaoning, and project cities; and (vii) requiring workers to follow strict sanitation, social, safety, \nand environmental management guidelines. The project implementation consultants will monitor \nand  ensure  implementation  of  these  mitigating  measures  to  minimize  impacts  during \nconstruction. \n \n41. \nProvincial and local environmental protection bureaus are expanding public information \nprograms,  mainly  via  web  sites, newspapers,  television,  and  radio.15  Improved  environmental \ndisclosure  is  expected  to  facilitate  environmental  management  measures  included  in  the \nProject.  In  principle,  ADB  supports  the  expanded  public  information  programs,  including  the \nenvironmental performance rating pilot project tested in Nanjing and other PRC cities during the \npast  2  years.  Local  environmental  protection  bureaus  in  Liaoning  will  expand  their  public \ndisclosure  activities.  GLP  will  ensure  that  any  adverse  environmental  impacts  arising  from  the \nconstruction  and  operation  of  the  project  facilities  will  be  minimized  by  implementing  the \nmitigation measures as identified in the IEE and summary IEE. \n \n42. \nIssues  and  Poverty  Reduction.  Only  one  project \nsubcomponent  involves  permanent  land  acquisition.  The  other  subcomponents  will  result  in  a \ntemporary  disturbance  to  roads  and  thus  require  compensation  payments  to  government \nagencies  for  necessary  arrangement  and  support  during  project  implementation.  The  Fuxin \nCBM/CMM development requires land acquisition and compensation for  three households that \nlose  part  of  their  farmland,  and  46  households  will  receive  compensation  for  temporary  land \n\nProject  Review\u2014Social \n\n                                                 \n15  The  State  Environmental  Protection  Agency  has  directed  all  cities  to  begin  public  awareness  and  disclosure \nprograms by the end of 2004.  Most cities in the PRC have mature public awareness programs  and many have \nalready initiated some type of expanded environmental information disclosure program. \n\n\f15 \n\noccupation.  Participatory  project  appraisal  was  carried  out  in  2003  to  consult  the  affected \npersons on their needs and preferences. A socioeconomic survey of all 49 affected households \nwas conducted in  October  2003.  The  impacts  are  minor  and  most  of  the  affected  people  will \nreceive  cash  compensation;  a  few  will  receive  replacement  land.  To  mitigate  the  impacts, \ncompensation standards and a rehabilitation plan have been proposed in the resettlement plan. \nResettlement  information  booklet  was  distributed  to  all  affected  households.  The  resettlement \nplan  was  published  on  ADB's  resettlement  web  site    in  October  2004.  A  summary  of  the \nresettlement  plan  is  provided  in  Appendix  9  and  the  plan  itself  is  provided  in  Supplementary \nAppendix M. GLP,  PMO, and the PIAs will ensure that all affected persons are compensated in \na  timely  manner  and  resettled  in  accordance  with  the  resettlement  plan.  The  PIA  will  have \nfurther  consultation  with  the  affected  persons  during  project  implementation.  The  estimated \nbudget for resettlement compensation and rehabilitation is CNY36.5 million. \n \n43. \nADB  commissioned  a  social  and  poverty  impact  assessment  (SPIA)  in  2003  that \nincluded field interviews of the poor. Consultations were  also held to gain an understanding of \ngender  differences in  consumption  patterns,  needs,  and  priorities.  During  SPIA  preparation, \nvarious  participatory  techniques,  such  as  household  interviews,  focus  group  discussions, \nsocioeconomic survey of households, meetings with enterprises, and site reconnaissance, were \nused.16  Many  government  organizations,  including  the  provincial  and  municipal  civil  affairs \nbureau,  poverty  reduction  office,  labor  and  social  security  bureau,  development  and  reform \ncommission, health bureau, statistics bureau,  minority affairs committee, women\u2019s federation, \nenvironmental  protection  bureau,  real  estate  development bureau,  and  tourism administration \nbureau,  were  consulted.  A  participation  and  awareness  program  will  be  established  to \nencourage  the  active  involvement  of  local  communities  to  maximize  their  participation  in  the \nProject.  The  program  will  take  the  form  of  annual  survey  questionnaires.  A  summary poverty \nreduction  and  social  strategy  is  presented  in  Appendix  10, summarizing the poverty reduction \nand social impacts. Twenty person-months of consulting services will be allocated for the design \nand implementation of the participation and awareness program. The social impact study will be \ncontracted out to a local consulting firm or  research institute, to be carried out on the basis of \nprocedures and terms of reference acceptable to ADB. \n \n44. \nAn impact assessment  on  ethnic  minorities  in  the  project  area  was  carried  out  by  the \nPPTA consultants in accordance with ADB's policy on indigenous peoples. The results indicated \nthat  the  project  impact  on  ethnic  minorities  is  generally  positive  but  insignificant,  as  only \n10 Mongolian households and  two Hui households will be affected by permanent  or temporary \nland  occupation  resulting  from  the  construction  of  Fuxin  CBM/CMM  Development.  Mitigation \nmeasures will be implemented to alleviate the land occupation impact. In the  resettlement plan, \nspecial  provisions  are  provided  to  minority  households,  including  a  social  assistance fund of \nCNY5,000 per affected household. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\n \n45. \nintegrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n\nThe  Project  includes  economic,  financial,  environmental,  and  social  assessments.  The \n\n                                                 \n16  A  stratified  random  sampling  based  on  income  for  1,000  beneficiary  households,  including  700  rural  and \n\n300 urban households, was conducted. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\nA. \n \n\nEconomic and Financial Viability \n\n1. \n\nLeast-Cost Assessment and Economic Viability \n\n \nThe PPTA consultants reviewed the demand forecast for the Project and concluded that \n46. \nthe risk associated with  the  demand  forecast  is  minimal  (Supplementary  Appendix  N).  This  is \nbecause  the  Project  will  provide  supply  to  meet  only  a  fraction  of  the  total  gas  and  heating \ndemand in the project cities. The gas distribution component will  meet only a small share of the \ntotal incremental demand for gas in the project cities. The city central heating supply component \nwill  replace  the  existing  small  boilers  to  meet  existing  heating  demand.  There  is  little  risk \nassociated  with  the  demand  forecast  in  the  economic  and  financial  viability  analyses.  A  least-\ncost  analysis  was  performed  for  the  two  categories  of  end  use  to  be  served  by  the  Project, \nincluding:  (i) household  cooking  and  water  heating  and  (ii) household  space  heating.  For \nhousehold  cooking  and  water  heating,  the  analysis  indicates  that  coal  gas  is  the  least-cost \noption.  When  CBM/CDM  are  available,  they  are  the  least-cost options. For household space \nheating, the least-cost analysis concludes that  combined heat and power proposed for Yinkou \ncity heating supply and large boilers proposed for other cities for heating supplies are the least-\ncost options.  \n \n47. \nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  was  calculated  for  each  project \nsubcomponent and for the whole Project including all project components. As in the least-cost \nanalysis,  the  economic  analysis  applied  the  conversion  factors  to  investment  costs  for  land,17 \nequipment  cost,  fuel  costs,  and  operation  and  maintenance  costs,  where  applicable.  The \nbenefits  of  output  were  valued  based  on  the  cost  saving  of  alternative  fuels  and  efficiency \nimprovement. The cost-saving benefits were valued as the cost differences of the energy supply \noptions  with  and  without  the  Project.  A  survey  was  carried  out  to  determine  the  appropriate \nenergy supply options for each  category of consumers.  The local environmental benefits were \ntaken into account in the EIRR calculation.  Line losses were based on the statistics of historical \nline-loss rates in each project city. \n \n48. \nAn  economic  evaluation  of  the  environmental  impacts  of  the  Project  was  carried  out \nbased  on  the  benefits  transfer  method.  The  evaluation  used  (i) the  methodology  adopted  in \nADB\u2019s  Economic  Evaluation  of  Environmental  Impacts :  A Workbook  (1996)  to  determine  the \nadjusted  estimate  of  the  monetary  damages  caused  by  air  pollution  during  the  study  period, \ntaking into account the location of the  pollution sources, the emission level, and the population \naffected; and (ii) estimates of average annual climate change for carbon emissions to evaluate \nthe monetary damage caused by greenhouse gas emissions (Supplementary Appendix O). The \nEIRRs  presented  in  Table  3  include  only  the  local  environmental  benefits.  If  the  global \nenvironmental benefits were included, the EIRR for the whole Project would increase to 28.8%. \n \nThe  summary  results  of  the  EIRR  calculation  presented  in  Table  3  (details  in \n49. \nSupplementary  Appendix  P)  reflect  all  project-related costs,  the benefits from  cost savings of \nalternative  fuels  and  efficiency  improvement,  and  local  environmental  benefits.  This approach \nyields  EIRRs  from  10.0%  to  18.5%  without,  and  from  16.8%  to  43.8%  with,  the  local \nenvironmental  benefits  for  the  project  subcomponents,  and  13.6%  without  and  26.3%  with  the \nlocal environmental benefits for the whole Project. Sensitivity analyses were performed for each \nsubcomponent.  For  the  EIRR  of  the  whole  Project,  sensitivity  analysis  (Appendix  11)  showed \nthe EIRR would decrease to (i) 20.7% if the Project was to experience a cost overrun of  20%; \n\n                                                 \n17  Land is valued at the economic opportunity cost (the estimated value of the best alternative utilization). \n\n\f17 \n\n(ii) 19.6%  if  the  benefits  were  reduced  by  20%;  (iii) 22.7%  if  the  Project  was  to  experience  a \ncommissioning delay of 1 year; and (iv) 12.3% if (i), (ii), and (iii) all happened. \n \n\nTable 3: Summary of Economic Internal Rate s of Return \n\nSubcomponent \n \n\nFuxin CBM/CMM Development \nFushun Gas Distribution Improvement \nBenxi Gas Distribution Improvement \nAnshan Central Heating Supply \nBenxi Central Heating Supply \nLiaoyang Central Heating Supply \nYingkou Central Heating Supply \nWhole Project \n\nEIRR (%) \nWithout Environmental \nBenefits  \n18.5 \n10.0 \n12.4 \n13.6 \n10.8 \n13.9 \n10.4 \n13.6 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nEIRR (%) \nWith Local Environmental \nBenefits  \n18.5 \n16.8 \n17.3 \n28.9 \n25.2 \n43.8 \n18.1 \n26.3 \n\nCBM = coal bed methane, CMM = coal mine methane, EIRR = economic internal rate of return. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n2. \n\nFinancial Internal Rate of Return \n\n \n \n \n50. \nThe  financial  viability  of  the  subcomponents  will  be  ensured  by  the  revenue \nenhancement and cost reduction measures including the implementation of a two-part heating \ntariff. The  financial  internal  rates  of  return  (FIRR)  of  the  subcomponents  are  summarized  in \nTable 4.  The  FIRR  for  all  subcomponents  compares  favorably  with  the  respective  estimated \nweighted  average  costs  of  capital  (WACCs),  which  demonstrates  their  financial  viability \n(Appendix  12).  Overall,  the  FIRR  for  the  Project  is  estimated  at  8.7%.  Sensitivity  analysis \nshowed  the  FIRR  for  the  whole  project  would  decrease  to  (i) 7.4%  if  the  Project  was  to \nexperience a cost overrun of 10%; (ii) 5.1% if the benefits were reduced by 10%; (iii) 7.5% if the \noperating  costs  were  increased  by  10%;  (iv) 7.2%  if  the  Project  were  to  experience  a \ncommissioning delay of 1 year; and (v) 4.0% if both (ii) and (iv) happened. \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Financial Internal Rates of Return and \nWeighted Average Costs of Capital \n\nSubcomponent \nFuxin CBM/CMM Development \nFushun Gas Distribution Improvement \nBenxi Gas Distribution Improvement \nAnshan Central Heating Supply \nBenxi Central Heating Supply \nLiaoyang Central Heating Supply \nYingkou Central Heating Supply \nWhole Project \n\nFIRR (%) \n8.6 \n8.7 \n8.5 \n8.3 \n8.9 \n8.6 \n8.9 \n8.7 \n\nWACC (%) \n4.2 \n4.3 \n4.2 \n4.3 \n4.1 \n4.2 \n4.5 \n4.3 \n\nCBM = coal bed methane, CMM = coal mine methane, FIRR = financial internal rate of return, WACC = weighted \naverage cost of capital. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates . \n\nEnvironmental Benefits \n\n \nB. \n \n51. \nThe IEE concludes that the Project will provide an overall benefit to  the environment in \nthe  project  area.  Regional  air  quality  will  improve  with  closure  of  small  coal-fired  boilers, \nextraction  of  CBM/CMM,  more  efficient  gas  distribution  systems,  and  reduction  in  coal  use \nbecause  of  more  efficient  boilers.  The  environmental  benefits  from  the  Project  include  coal \n\n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\nSocial Benefits  \n\nsavings of 217,500 t/yr, and an emission reduction of TSP  of 18,800 t/y, SO2 of 2,600 t/y, NOx \nof 1,700 t/y, and greenhouse gas of CO2 equivalent of 840,900 t/y. Water and soil pollution will \nbe  indirectly  reduced  due  to  lower  rates  of  pollutant  transfer  from  air  to  water,  with  reduced \nstress  on  local  ecosystems.  The  quantifiable  local  environmental  benefits  over  the  project  life \nare  expected  to  be  about  CNY846  million  in  net  present  value  at  2003  prices.  The  global \nenvironmental benefits of greenhouse gas reduction (CO2 and CBM/CMM) are expected to be \nabout  CNY163  million  in  net  present  value  at  2003  prices.  Unquantifiable  environmental \nbenefits,  such  as  damages  from  the  wastewater  of  small  boilers  and  gas  leaking,  are  also \nsignificant. \n \nC. \n \nThe Project will directly benefit  an urban population of about  2.7 million in the six project \n52. \nbeneficiary cities.18 Among these people, 1.9 million urban residents will benefit from gas supply \nand 0.8 million urban residents from central heating supply. Of the total beneficiary population, \nabout 199,800 people (7.4% of the beneficiaries) have incomes below the local urban poverty \nlines  (ranging  from  CNY1,872  to  CNY2,460  per  year).  The  increased  use  of  gas  and  better \ncentral heating supplies will reduce the use of conventional fuels such as raw coal, wood, and \ncoal briquettes to mitigate environmental and health impacts, particularly on the poor. \n \nThe Project will create about 7,280 person-years of employment opportunities during the \n53. \nproject construction phase and  1,940  full-time  jobs  during  the  operation  of the Project. Of the \ntotal,  2,910  person-years  of  employment  opportunities  will  be  filled  by  the  poor,  women, and \nminorities  with  an  estimated  total  of  CNY28 million  in  wage  payments  during  the  project \nconstruction  period.  In  addition,  780  employment  opportunities  with  CNY8.4 million  of  annual \nwage payments are expected to go to the poor, women, and minorities during project operation. \nLocal procurement of the materials required for the Project is expected to create additional jobs. \nThe  improved urban environment should  enhance  the local investment climate to attract more \ninvestment to the region and act as a catalyst for future development. \n \n54. \nThe  improvement  of  the  air  quality  will  reduce  the  morbidity  and  mortality  rate  of  air-\nrelated diseases and associated medical costs, loss of working days, as well as human suffering \nin the project beneficiary areas. The poor, elderly, children, and women, who have less coping \nresources and are more vulnerable, will benefit disproportionately from the replacement of coal \nand  wood.  In  particular,  women  usually  spend  more  time  than  men  on  cooking;  the  length  of \ntheir exposure to smoke is considerable higher than men\u2019s. Moreover, survey results show that \nthe  majority  of  urban  residents  consider  that  greater  gas  and  central  heating  supplies  will \nimprove  the  overall  quality  of  life,  reduce  housework  for  women,  decrease  health  problems, \nincrease  comfort  and  entertainment  activities,  and  encourage  children  to  study  longer  in  the \nwinter. A benefit  distribution  and  poverty  impact  ratio  analysis  was  carried  out  to  compute  the \npoverty impact ratio  of  the  Project  (Appendix 13).  The  share  of  net  project  economic  benefits \ndirectly  accruing  to  the  poor  is  estimated  at  13.9%.    Since  the  poverty  impact  ratio  is \nsubstantially  higher  than  the  ratio  of  poverty  population  to  total  population  in  the  project  areas \n(7.4%), the Project is considered to be pro-poor. \n \nD. \n \n55. \nA  demand  analysis  has  been  carried  out  to  ensure  sufficient  demand  for  the  central \nheating  and  gas  supplies  generated  by  the  Project.  The  risk  of  insufficient  demand  for  the \n\nAssessment of Project Risks \n\n                                                 \n18  This includes Anshan, Benxi, Fushun, Fuxin,  Liaoyang, and Yingkou. \n\n\f19 \n\nProject  is  minimal.  The  heating  supply,  the  CBM/CMM  development,  and  gas  distribution \nimprovement are to meet the existing demand and a small fraction of incremental demand in the \nproject  cities.  The  proposed  gas  tariff  adjustment  was  approved  in  principle  by  the  city \ngovernment  and    was  effective  on  1  November  2004.  The  average  heating  tariff  of  about \nCNY20/m2 in Liaoning is not low and reflects economic supply cost. The expected improvement \nin facility efficiency by about 20% and billing collection to 95% under the Project will improve the \nPIAs\u2019  financial  performance.  Strong  economic  performance  is  expected  in  Liaoning, based on \nthe  PRC\u2019s  new  emphasis  on  the  economic  development  of  the  northeast  provinces \n(Heilongjiang, Jiling, and Liaoning). \n \n56. \nThe gas and central heating distribution systems under the Project are based on proven \ndesigns and conventional technologies that have been long  used successfully in the PRC. No \nsignificant technical risks are anticipated. On a smaller scale, the transmission and distribution \nof CMM has been demonstrated as a viable activity in Liaoning. The CBM/CMM development, \nhowever,  involves  some  technical  risks  such  as  the  use  of  vertical  wells  to  extract  CBM/CMM \nfrom  coal  mines,  which  requires  careful  design,  construction,  and  operation.  The  output  of \nexisting pilot-testing wells met the PPTA consultants\u2019 expectations. Furthermore, this technology \nis  worth  developing  in  the  PRC  as  the  potential  benefits  substantially  outweigh  the  risks. \nPrecautions will be taken to minimize  potential  risks during  project construction and operation \nphases. The risk of delay to loan effectiveness and construction due to late internal approvals \nand procurement was addressed by early preparation and procurement training for all the PIAs \nin July 2004. The  chance  of large  project  cost  savings  will  be  minimal because of  the  recent \nupward trend  in  the  prices  of  construction  materials  and  a  prudent  cost  estimate.  GLP  will \nmitigate  the  risk  of  inadequate  project  management  by  setting  up  the  PMO  with  experienced \nprofessional staff who have had previous experience in design and construction supervision and \nprocurement. International and domestic consultants will also provide assistance in these areas \nIn addition, all of the PIAs will be subject to good governance supervision under the PPMS. \n \nTo  fully  assess  the  potential  project  risks,  a  probabilistic  risk  analysis  was  performed \n57. \nusing the Monte Carlo simulation technique based on 3,000 simulations for both the EIRR and \nFIRR analysis (Supplementary Appendix Q). The crucial risk variables were selected because \nof their significant impact on the project\u2019s economic and financial viability. The results indicate \nthat  the  expected  EIRR,  based  on  the  weighted  average  of  all  simulated  combinations,  is \n25.3%,  or  about  1.0%  lower  than  the  base-case  value,  without consideration of project risks. \nThe probability of the EIRR falling below the cut-off rate of 12% is 0.3%. The economic risk is \nvery  low  because  the  Project  relies  on  existing  demand  and  benefits  from  efficiency \nimprovements. The results indicate that the expected FIRR is 8.6%, about 0.1% lower than the \nbase-case value, without consideration of project risks. The probability of the FIRR falling below \nthe WACC for the Project of 4.3% is 16.9%. \n \nPoverty is associated with vulnerability. The dimension of risk in poverty assessment is \n58. \nof  significance since the poor are the most vulnerable to unexpected unfavorable  events. The \nexpected  poverty  impact  ratio  is  12.1%,  1.8%  lower  than  the  base-case  value,  without \nconsideration  of  project    risks, and still  higher  than  the  share  of  the  poor  in  the  project  area. \nEven with pessimistic assumptions, the probability of a negative outcome for the poor is 6.7%. \nThe  risk  analysis  on  the  poverty  impact  ratio  calculation,  together  with  the  analysis  on  the \nprobability of overall project failure (risk analysis on the EIRRs and FIRRs), concludes that that \nthe probability of negative outcomes for the poor is also minimal. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n59. \nthe standard assurances, in the legal documents: \n \n\nThe Government and GLP have agreed to include the following assurances, in addition to \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nGLP  will  ensure  that  the  PIAs  complete  the  closure  of  412  small,  coal-fired, \nheating  boilers  in  the  project  cities  in  Liaoning  province  by  31  December  2008. \nThe  demolishing  of  boilers  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  all  applicable \nPRC environmental and safety standards.

Pollution in the early 1990s resulted in annual economic losses of CNY99 billion \n(about 4% of GDP at the time), with air pollution accounting for 59%, water pollution 36%, and \nsolid  waste  5%.1  The  high  economic  losses  reflect  waste  and  inefficiency  in  the  utilization  of \nenergy, raw materials, and other resources in the production of goods and services. This is partly \na  legacy  of  the  past  practice  of  locating  industrial  enterprises  in  urban  centers, inappropriate \nregulatory  measures,  and  pricing  policies  that  did  not  provide  adequate  incentives  for \nconservation  and  environmentally  friendly  behavior.  With  rapid  economic  growth,  the  use  of \nenergy and raw materials will continue to grow in the PRC. Unless better technologies are used, \nswitching to cleaner fuels is encouraged, and the use of renewable energy is increased, air quality \nwill deteriorate and related economic losses will increase. Supplementary Appendix A provides \nadditional information. \n \nThe  PRC's  heavy  reliance  on  coal  as  its  primary  fuel  for  industrial  production, power \n2. \ngeneration, and commercial and residential applications, mainly heating and cooking, contributes \nsignificantly to emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and total suspended particulates (TSP), and high \nlevels  of  urban  air  pollution.  Air  quality  is  poor  in  most  of  the  PRC\u2019s  industrial  cities.  Liaoning \nprovince has air pollution problems due to heavy reliance on coal as the primary fuel for the large \nnumber of heavy industries in the province and for  heating. Most  urban heating  is provided by \nsmall, inefficient, coal-fired heating boilers. These small boilers typically are not equipped with \nadequate  pollution  control  devices,  and  have  been  the  major  sources  of  air  pollution  in  urban \nareas in the province. Shenyang and Benxi in Liaoning province are among the most polluted \ncities  in  the  world.  Due  to  the  Government\u2019s  effort on environmental improvement,  urban air \nquality has been slowly improving.  \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe PRC is the world\u2019s largest coal producer with 2002 production of 1,393 million tons (t) \nof raw coal accounting for 28% of the world\u2019s total coal production. Coal provides more than three \nquarters of the energy for power generation, 65% of chemical raw materials, and more than half of \ncommercial  and  civilian  energy.  Coal  accounts  for  95%  of  the  nation\u2019s  primary  fossil  energy \nresources. Coal will continue to be the primary energy fuel in the PRC for the foreseeable future, \npartly because of increasing thermal power capacity. Coal production  reached 1,400 million t in \n1996  and  then  gradually  energy  efficiency  was  improved  and  other  sources  of  energy  were \ndeveloped. Coal production was 1,000 million t in 2000 and increased to 1,667 million t in 2003. \nCoal  production  in  Liaoning  totaled  54 million t  in  2000  and  increased  to  58 million t in 2003. \nLiaoning  has  over  1,300  active  coal  mines.  State-owned  coal  mines  account  for  80%  of  coal \nproduction capacity. \n\nCoal Subsector \n\n                                                 \n1   Based  on  a  study  by  the  Policy  Research  Center  for  Environment  and  Economy  of  the  State  Environmental \n\nProtection Administration. \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nUrban Heating \n\nGas Distribution \n\nC. \n \nIn the PRC, three types of gas are distributed: manufactured town gas,2 natural gas, and \n4. \nliquefied  petroleum  gas  (LPG).  Liaoning  province  has  4,470  kilometers  (km)  of  town  gas \ndistribution  pipelines,  2,951  km  of  natural  gas  distribution  pipelines,  and  195  km  of  LPG \ndistribution pipelines. The most important end uses for city gas are cooking, water heating, and \nspace heating to a lesser degree. In 2000,  total city gas consumption in the PRC was 34 billion \ncubic meters (bcm), consisting of 15.2 bcm of coal gas, 8.2 bcm of natural gas, and 10.5 million t \nof  liquefied  petroleum  gas  (LPG).  All  the  existing  gas  distribution  systems  are  owned  and \noperated  by  municipal  gas  companies  under  the  control  of  city  governments  and  under  the \nsupervision  of  the  Ministry  of  Construction  at  the  national  level.  The  gas  prices  for  end  use \nconsumers  used to be  subsidized  before  as  a  basic  human  need  under  the  centrally  planned \nsystem  but  have  recently  been  adjusted  nearer  to  market  prices.  The  average  gas  price  in \nLiaoning,  about  CNY1.0/cubic  meter  (m3)  (heat  value  of  5,000  kcal/m3),  is  comparable  to \nCNY1.3/m3  (heat  value  of  8,000  kcal/m3)  for  many  provinces  in  the PRC. Compared to coal, \ndistribution of  gas is more convenient and less polluting. The growing demand for city gas has \nbeen outpacing supply. Total city gas demand is expected to grow to 100 bcm by 2010, almost \ntripling during the 2000 to 2010 period. \n \nD. \n \n5. \nUrban heating demand in the PRC has grown rapidly due to rising incomes, privatization \nof housing, and housing sector growth. In terms of heated areas, heating demand has increased \nby an annual average rate of 17% from 1992 to 2003. Urban heating demand had grown rapidly \nduring  the  past  decade  because  of  economic  and  housing  growth  and  housing  reforms  that \npromoted private ownership. The total heated area of buildings in the PRC was only 328 million \nsquare meters (m2) in 1992 but more than quadrupled to 1,460 million m2 in 2002, equivalent to a \ncompound annual growth rate of 16.1%. Residential buildings account for about 70% of the total \nspace heating demand, and commercial and public buildings account for  the remaining 30%. In \n2002,  30%  of  total  residential  buildings  were  served  by  combined  heat  and  power \ngeneration/urban central heating supply. This market penetration of central heating is relatively \nlow, compared to the 55% to 60% range in developed European countries such as Denmark and \nFinland.  About  500,000  small  coal-fired  heating  boilers  still  operate  in  the  PRC.  As  part  of  its \nenergy efficiency and environmental improvement plan, the Government\u2019s policy promotes urban \ncentral  heating  supply  systems  using  heat  supplied  from  efficient,  large,  combined  heat  and \npower generation plants and/or large heating boilers. Similar to the national trend, the heating \ndemand in Liaoning province has been growing rapidly in the past ten years. The total heated \nspace  in  the  province  grew  at  13.6% per  year,  increasing  from  69.8 million  m2  in  1992  to \n220.5 million m 2 in 2001. In Liaoning, the average heating tariff of about CNY20/m2 is the same as \nor  comparable  to  the  CNY20/m2  in  Heilongjiang,  CNY19.5 /m2  in  Xinjiang,  and  CNY24/m2 in \nBeiijing. \n \nE. \n \nMethane is part of  coal\u2019s natural composition. In the PRC, many coal mines have a very \n6. \nhigh content of methane. The production of coal in the PRC res ults in the emission of methane as \na greenhouse gas into the atmosphere that could otherwise be used as an energy source. In the \n\nCoal Bed Methane /Coal Mine Methane  \n\n                                                 \n2   Town gas is either manufactured using low-grade coal or is a byproduct from the production of coke for metallurgical \npurposes. More recently, coal bed methane and coal mine methane captured during coal mining operations has  also \nbeen supplied to urban communities through networks of pipes .  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n\nPRC about 6 billion  m3 of methane was released into the atmosphere in 2003 from coal mine \noperations. This figure is expected to reach 10 billion m3 by 2010. Liaoning province accounts for \nabout 20% of the nation\u2019s total  coal bed methane (CBM)/coal mine methane (CMM) emissions. \nMethane, when released into the atmosphere, is about 21 times more potent than carbon dioxide \nas  a  greenhouse  gas.  To  date  in  the  PRC,  only  a  few  small-scale  CBM/CMM  development \nprojects have produced methane for power generation or distribution for household and industrial \nusers.  Large  commercial  CBM/CMM projects would  constitute  a  new  environmentally  friendly \nenergy source. The probable CBM/CMM within a depth of 2,000 meters in the PRC is 30 trillion to \n35  trillion  m3.  Development  and  utilization  of  CBM/CMM  would  also  help  reduce  coal  mine \naccidents. In the PRC, about 80% of  such accidents are attributable to methane explosions. In \n2002, 6,900 miners died in the PRC, including 266 in Liaoning province. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f28 \n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE AND LESSONS LEARNED \n\nExternal Assistance \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nExternal sources, including  foreign  direct  investment,  are  increasingly  being  promoted \nand now finance about 20% of total annual investment in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) \nenergy sector, mainly in the power sector.  The  Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved \nabout $3.2 billion to the PRC energy sector to finance 25 projects in the public sector, and two \nprivate sector power projects. With regard to power projects, thermal power projects account for \n41% in terms of loan amount, with hydropower projects accounting for about 36%, followed by \ntransmission  and  distribution  (about  17%),  and  renewable  energy  (about  6%).  ADB  has  also \nprovided 67 technical assistance (TA) projects for the energy sector for about $32 million to help \nprepare projects, provide policy advice, and build the institutional capabilities of power utilities that \nare  the  executing  agencies  of  ADB  loans.  ADB  has  extended  nine  loans  amounting  to \n$1.35 billion for urban environmental improvement projects in the PRC, including district heating \ndistribution  and  combined  heat  and  power  cogeneration  plants.  Four  projects  have  been \ncompleted and are in commercial operation resulting in improvement in the overall ambient air \nquality in the assisted cities.  \n \nADB has also provided a TA to support the Government\u2019s reform of heating tariffs.1 The \n2. \nobjective  of  the  TA  is  to  help  the  Government  reform  the  urban  heating  sector  and  promote \nsustainable  urban  heating  supply  in  the  PRC  by  (i) formulating  pro-poor  national  heating  tariff \nguidelines, and (ii) establishing an effective heating tariff collection mechanism. The World Bank \nis also an important source of external funding for urban district heating. Since early 1990s, it has \nprovided  over  $600 million  to  finance  environment  improvement  projects.  The  central  heating \nsystem  components  of  these  projects  helped  reduce  polluting  emissions  from  small  inefficient \ncoal-fired heating boilers. In recent years, the World Bank has also provided TA to support the \nGovernment\u2019s heating sector reforms. \n \nAmong  bilateral  sources,  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC)  is  the \n3. \nlargest  source  of  external  assistance  for  the  power  sector  in  the  PRC.  It  has  provided \nconcessional loans totaling CNY438 billion ($3.6 billion at the current exchange rate) for 14 power \nsector  projects  through  its  official  development  assistance  window.  JBIC  has  also  provided \nspecial credits to major cities to improve their environment by installing emission control devices \nand equipment in power plants and factories, and through building water treatment facilities. JBIC \nis  considering  shifting  its  traditional  focus  of  assistance  in  the  power  sector  from  hydro  and \nthermal  power  generation  to  energy  conservation  and  renewable  energy,  particularly  in  the \nwestern  region.  Germany,  through  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau  (KfW),  has  provided \napproximately  $400 million in mixed credits, mostly for power plants and turbine modernization \nprojects.  KfW  has  also  supported  the  Government  in  energy  efficiency  and  renewable  energy \ndevelopment.  Other  bilateral  sources  providing  export  credits  or  mixed  credits  in  the  energy \nsector  include  Australia,  Canada,  Denmark,  France,  Italy,  Spain,  United  Kingdom,  and  United \nStates. \n \nADB  has  established  a  working  relationship  with  the  World  Bank  in  addressing  policy \n4. \nissues and coordinating lending and TA operations, and exchanges views with bilateral sources \nand  the  private  sector.  Both  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  have  emphasized  the  importance  of \nimproving  the  management  of  power  utilities,  tariff  reform,  energy  efficiency  improvement, \nenvironmental protection, and a greater role for the private sector. During the processing of the \nproposed Project, discussions were held with the World Bank, JBIC, and KfW to ensure that their \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Pro-poor Urban Heating Tariff Reforms. \n\nManila. The TA is nearly completed. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n29 \n\nLessons Learned \n\nrespective  activities  are  complementary  and  to  maintain  consistency  in  policy  advice.  Some \nadditional information is presented in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \nB. \n \nADB\u2019s overall experience from energy and environment sector projects in the PRC has \n5. \nbeen  positive.  Projects  are  generally  well  designed  and  smoothly  implemented,  although \nsubstantial  difficulties  have  emerged  in  some  projects.  Success  is  attributed  to  extensive \npreparation  prior  to  ADB  intervention,  high  degree  of  local  ownership,  effective  leadership  in \nproject management offices (PMOs), timely policy and enterprise reforms, and fortunate market \nconditions. Delays in mobilizing counterpart funds are not uncommon, but in most cases have not \nresulted in unsatisfactory performance.  \n \nSome  problems  in  energy  projects  have  arisen  from  inappropriate  policies  on  energy \n6. \npricing, especially coal vs. natural gas (and urban heating), and enforcement of environmental \nprotection  requirements.  For  instance,  the  Shaanxi  Environment  Improvement  Project  (Loan \n1543-PRC), in general, has been successfully implemented, but experienced the cancellation of \ntwo cogeneration subprojects due to fuel pricing considerations, i.e., while natural gas was the \nenvironmentally favored alternative, extant gas pricing would have required subsidies of 30\u201350% \nto achieve a positive financial internal rate of return.  \n \nPersistent  regulatory  loopholes  and  weak  enforcement  of  key  provisions pose some \n7. \nproject risk: emissions fees for SO2 and other waste gas emissions are still set below the marginal \ncost  of  abatement,  making  it  cheaper  for  large  coal-fired  power  plants  and  synthetic  gas \nproducers to pay the pollution discharge fees than to implement de-sulfurization methods. Waste \ncoal power plants are given some regulatory exemption from stack emissions standards, based \non the \u201ccomprehensive reutilization\u201d principle. Sustained enforcement of total emissions quotas \non  a  provincial  and  air-shed  basis  was  at  least  partially  successful  in  the  late  1990s,  but \nconstruction and operation of large coal-fired power plants in the project area may jeopardize the \nlong-range emissions control plan.  \n \n8. \nOngoing  market  reforms  in  gas  and  heating  subsectors  pose  uncertainties  in  financial \nviability  of  project  enterprises,  particularly  state-owned  enterprises  in  the  early  stages  of \ncorporatization and commercialization. Ongoing environmental improvement projects (e.g., Loan \n1715-PRC  and  Loan  1890-PRC)  illustrate that market reforms and material price volatility can \noutpace  project  implementation  with  two  extreme  outcomes:  (i) constraining  enterprise \nprofitability,  or  (ii) enterprise  mergers  and  acquisitions  may  accelerate  management  and \nownership  reforms  to  the point that external support is not critical. A recent completed  project \nperformance audit report of a similar environmental project (Loan 1270: Tangshan and Chende \nEnvironmental  Improvement  Project)  identified  several  important  lessons  including  choosing \nsuitable (not the most advanced) technology, integrated environmental and financial impacts, and \nemphasis on implementation.  \n \n9. \nThe above lessons have been taken into account in project design and preparation. The \nAir  Pollution  Control  Law  (amended  in  2000\u20132001)  provides  a  rational  regulatory  framework \npromoting clean energy development in an environmentally friendly manner. Coal mine methane \n(CMM) has been demonstrated as a viable energy source in Liaoning province. The proposed gas \nand  heating and  coal  bed  methane  (CBM)  will  be  developed  to  meet  existing  demand  and  a \nfraction  of  the  total  incremental  demand  in  the  project  cities.  Price  forecasts  have  been \nconservatively  estimated.  The  PMO  has  sufficient  experience  as  it  has  just  completed  the \nimplementation  of  a  loan  from  the  World  Bank.  Institutional  strengthening  of  the  project \nimplementation  agencies  will  be  implemented  in  parallel  with  loan-funded  investments. \nCoordination with  the  World  Bank  and  JBIC  is  active  and  ongoing,  eliminating  any  overlap  in \nassistance. \n \n\n\f30           Appendix 4\n\nPROJECT COST ESTIMATES\n\nItem\n\nContract/Package\n\nEstimated Cost\nLC\nFC\n$ million\n$

(FXMGC),  a  state-owned  enterprise  (SOE).  FXDUC  presently  undertakes \nCBM/CMM  operations.  FXDUC  started  production  in  2000  but  the  volumes  have  not  been \nsignificant  (development  stage)  with  small  losses  or  breakeven  results.  With  the  increase  in \nCBM/CMM operations and a good market for gas,  projections for FXDUC are expected to meet \nfinancial targets. \n \n\n2. \n\nFushun Gas General Company \n\n \n3. \nThe  Fushun  Gas  General  Company  (FGC)  is  an  SOE,  created  in  1949.  FGC\u2019s  core \nbusiness is supplying coal gas mostly to residential consumers in the city. In 2003, the volume of \ngas supplied was 53 million cubic meters (m3); it also supplied 15,940 tons of liquefied petroleum \ngas. FGC has eight business units including two independent subsidiary companies and employs \n1,293 staff, 580 of whom are female. Its total assets as of end-2003 were CNY123.3 million. FGC \nhas registered net losses over the last 5 years. FGC cited low gas tariffs, which have been kept \nconstant  for  the  last  6 years,  and  poor  management  during  the  transition  from  a  government \nagency to an independent public utility, as the main reasons for the losses. The company has \napplied for a tariff rate increase, which was approved for implementation  from November 2004. \nThis tariff increase, together with reduction of distribution losses and improvement of operation \nefficiency, is expected to reverse the company\u2019s losses and to meet financial targets. \n \n\n3. \n\nBenxi Gas General Company \n\n \n4. \nThe  Benxi Gas  General  Company  (BGC)  is  an  SOE,  established  in  1974.  BGC\u2019s  core \nbusiness  is  to  supply  coal  or  natural  gas  mostly  to  residential  consumers  in  the  city.  In  2003, \n39 million m3 was supplied to a customer base of 140,000 households. BGC has 10 business \nunits including two independent subsidiary companies and employs 887 staff, 350 of whom are \nfemale. Its total assets as of the end of 2003 were CNY185.6 million. Over the last 5 years, BGC\u2019s \noperations have shown breakeven results, with sales revenues just sufficient to cover operating \nexpenses. Despite the minimal net income realized by BGC, the company has a healthy cash \nposition as its debt is kept at a low level, with its assets mostly funded by equity. In Benxi, gas is \nsupplied from a local steel mill and the city government has agreed to pass through any future \nprice increase. With the Project, BGC will be able to meet the financial targets with the efficiency \nimprovement and reduction in distribution losses under the Project. \n \n\n4. \n\nAnshan General Heating Company \n\n \n5.  \nAnshan General Heating Company (AGHC) is an SOE. Its core business is supplying heat \nto consumers in the city. AGHC was established in April 1981. In 1987, its annual government \nsubsidies were canceled and AGHC became an independent enterprise responsible for its own \nincome and profits. It provided heat to 9.27 million square meters (m2) of floor space by the end of \n\n \n\n\f36 \n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n2003. AGHC has 13 affiliate and subsidiary companies and employs 2,268 staff, 814 of whom are \nfemale. Its total assets as  of  end-2003  were  CNY479.5 million.  AGHC realized modest profits \n(about 1% of sales) in 2000 and 2001. In 2002, the company incurred losses equivalent to 8% of \nsales.  The  main  reason  for  the  loss  was  in  a  one-time financial change,  in  which uncollected \naccounts were written off and not recognized as revenues for the year. In 2003, there was another \naccounting change resulting in losses (32% of sales). The main reasons for low profitability  are \npoor  collection,  operational  inefficiency,  and  expenditure  related  to  its  social  role.  With  the \nadditional volume of heat that can be recovered and generated,  and improvements in efficiency \nand bill collection, profitability is expected to improve. \n \n\n5. \n\nBenxi General Heating Company \n\n \nThe Benxi General  Heating Company (BGHC) is an SOE. Its core business is supplying \n6. \nheat to consumers in the city.  In 1999, BGHC was established through the merger of the Benxi \ncity\u2019s  main  heating  supply  station  and  other  smaller  heating  departments.  In  2003,  BGHC \nsupplied  to  70,000  households  with  a  total  heating  area  of  3.9 million  m2.  BGHC  has  six \nsubsidiary companies and employs 1,077 staff, 320  of whom are female. Its total assets as of \nend-2003 were CNY301.8 million. BGHC had a negative operating income for 2 years from 2000. \nWith income generated from connection fees collected from new customers, it had modest net \nincomes, increasing to about 10% of sales in 2002 and 2003. The main reason for low profitability \nis  poor  collection.  Additional  operating  assets  were  transferred  from  Benxi city government in \n2002. The expected increase in sales due to new connections when 63 independent small boilers \nare shut down, expected efficiency improvement, heating tariff reforms, and improved collection \nwill  improve  BGHC\u2019s  financial  performance.  The  financial  targets  agreed  with  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) will be met based on the conservative financial projections. \n \n\n6. \n\nLiaoyang Real Estate Heat Company \n\n \nThe Liaoyang Real Estate Heating Company (LREHC) is an SOE, with a core business of \n7. \nsupplying heat to consumers in the city. LREHC was established in April 1984. In 2003, heat was \nsupplied  to  40,000  houses  with  3 million  m2  of  heating  area.  LREHC  has  five  subsidiary \ncompanies and employs 448 staff. Its total assets as of end-2003 were CNY359.0 million. LREHC \nregistered positive financial results in the last 5 years of operation. The company does not have \nany  long-term  debt  and  all  the  assets  transferred  to  it  by  Liaoyang  city  government  were \nconsidered  as  equity.  The  large  increase  in  the consumer base when 174 independent small \nboilers  are  shut  down,  expected  efficiency  improvement,  heating  tariff  reforms,  and  improved \ncollection will further improve LREHC\u2019s financial performance to meet the financial targets. \n \n\n7. \n\nYingkou Heating Company \n\n \nThe Yingkou Heating Company (YHC) is an SOE. YHC was established in July 1993, and \n8. \nsupplies  heat  to  the  eastern  and  western  areas  of  the  city.  In  2003,  YHC  served  25,000 \nhouseholds and supplied heat to a total area of 2.3 million m2, about half of the city\u2019s total heating \narea. YHC has six subsidiary companies and employs 499 staff, 212 of whom are female. Its total \nassets as of end-2003 were CNY195.0 million. Operations from 1999 to 2003 resulted in small \nincome  or  losses  amounting  to  less  than  1%  of  sales.  Poor  collection  was  cited  as  the  main \nconcern resulting in direct write-off of some accounts. In 2002, connection fees were allocated to \nYHC by Yinkou city government, which offset the operating losses incurred in that year. The large \nincrease in  the  consumer  base  when  175  independent  small  boilers  are  shut  down, expected \nefficiency  improvement,  heating  tariff  reforms,  and  improved  collection  will  improve  YHC\u2019s \nfinancial performance to meet the financial targets. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n37 \n\nAssumptions Used for Financial Projections \n\nB. \n \n9. \nThe  financial  operations  of  the  project  companies  were  projected  for  the  period \n2005\u20132014.  Their  financial  performance  in  the  next  10 years will  likely  improve  as  a  result  of \nimproved  market  environment,  GLP\u2019s  effort  to  clean  urban  air  pollution,  the  financial  and \ninstitutional reforms and facility improvement under the Project.  Gas tariffs are assumed at the \ncurrent levels and the approved adjustments. The heating tariffs are assumed at the current levels \nand the proposed adjustments in the Tariff Reform Action Plan, in particular the implementation of \na two-part heating tariffs. Based on actions being taken by the project implementation agencies \n(PIAs),  the  levels  and  structure  of  the  tariffs  are  considered  reasonable.  Operation  and \nmaintenance  expenses  are  projected  to  increase  in  line  with  sales,  assets  in  operation,  and \ninflation.  The  operating  ratio  and  the  net  profit  margin  are  forecast  to  improve  to  satisfy  the \nproposed minimum rate of return requirements. \n \n10. \nThe  projected  financial  performance  included  the  implementation  and  operation  of  the \nProject. The PIAs will be required to meet financial targets agreed with ADB. To ensure that this \nset of financial covenants is translated into appropriate financial policies and measures, the PIAs \nwill provide ADB each year with rolling 10-year financial projections, showing how they propose to \nmeet the covenanted targets. The financial covenants of ADB are expected to be satisfied during \nthe life of the Project. The debt service coverage ratio is forecast to be adequate throughout. The \ndebt-equity  ratio  will  also  be  within  the  prescribed  maximum  limit.  Other  financial  ratios  are \nexpected  to  remain  satisfactory.  The  capital  investment  programs  of  the  PIAs  consider  their \nongoing investments and the Project, adjusted to reflect projected annual escalation factors used \nin ADB projects. The revenue projections are based on the growth forecast prepared by the PIAs. \nThe projections use an exchange rate of CNY8.30/$1.00. \n \n11. \nRevenues are calculated from the volume of gas and heat sales and the average tariffs \nper m3 of gas and kilojoules (kJ) of heat sold. The tariff rates are based on the tariff schedule \nprevailing  in  2004  and  some  tariff  adjustments  required  under  the  Tariff  Reforms  Action  Plan \nagreed  with  ADB.  The  CBM/CMM  cost  was  based  on  the  agreed  transfer  price  between the \nmining company and FXDUC. For the gas distribution companies, the purchase cost of gas was \nconsidered. For heating, the current production cost of heat was maintained. Depreciation was \ncalculated  on  a  straight-line  basis  using  the  estimated  remaining  life  of  the  fixed  assets.  No \nsalvage value was considered. Annual operation and maintenance costs include the following: \nmaintenance costs estimated based on the value of gross fixed assets at 2.5%; personnel costs \nestimated based on an average annual salary of CNY10,000 per employee plus 14% in welfare \nbenefits; materials cost estimated based on historical consumption; plus a certain assumed level \nfor administrative and other costs.  \n \n12. \nInterest expenses on existing long-term debts are calculated based on the loan terms. The \ntaxable income of the PIAs is subject to 33% income tax, and losses for the past  5 years are \nallowed as deductions. The value-added tax for gas and heat sales is 13% and sales tax of 10% of \nvalue-added tax is levied. Accounts receivables are estimated based on the number of days of \nequivalent  sales  revenues  existing  in  2003,  declining  to  reflect  improved  collection  efficiency \nassociated with the heating tariff reforms. Accounts payables are estimated to be 2 months\u2019 cash \noperating expenses. \n \n\n \n\n\f38         Appendix 7\n\nTable A7.1: SUMMARY FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND PROJECTIONS\n(CNY million)\n\nYear

It  is  based  on \nenvironmental  examinations  and  assessments  prepared  for  individual  subcomponents  which \ninclude field sampling and assessment, interviews, and analysis of secondary data. \n \nB. \n\nProject Description \n\nThe Project includes: (i) improved and expanded coal mine methane (CMM) and coal bed \n2. \nmethane  (CBM) 1   production  in  Fuxin  city,  totaling  46 million  cubic  meters  per  year  (m3/y); \n(ii) rehabilitation  and  expansion  of  gas  transmission  and  distribution  networks  in  Benxi  and \nFushun  cities;  and  (iii) construction  and  operation  of  central  heating  systems  in  the  cities  of \nAnshan,  Benxi,  Liaoyang,  and  Yingkou  to  replace  small  coal-fired  heating  boilers;  and \n(iv) institutional  reforms  and  corporate  governance  improvement  of  the  project  implementation \nagencies (PIAs). \n \nC. \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\n3. \nLiaoning  province  is  located  on  the  northeast  coast  of  the  Asian  continent  at \n118o51'\u2013125o47' E and 38o43'\u201343o29' N with a width of 374 kilometers (km) from east to west and \n530 km from south to north. The climate is continental monsoon, with mean annual precipitation \nfrom 1,200 millimeters (mm) to 400 mm, decreasing from the southeast to northwest. The average \nannual  temperature  is  10.1oC.  Natural  resources  include  coal,  iron,  limestone,  and  petroleum. \nAgricultural products include oil plants, fruits, rice, corn, apples, pears, peanuts, and other cash \ncrops. Liaohe oil field is the third largest in the PRC, with crude oil and natural gas reserves that \naccount for 15% and 10% of the total of the PRC, respectively. Despite having significant energy \nresources,  the  project  area  is  a  net  energy  importer.  Conventional  petroleum  and  natural  gas \nreserves  are  declining,  and  coal  production  is  insufficient  to  meet  energy  demand  in  an \nenvironmentally acceptable manner. Liaoning is a traditional heavy industrial base of the PRC, \nwith severe air, water, and soil pollution. Air pollution has been improving in the project area, but \ndoes not yet meet the designated ambient quality standards on a year-round basis. The ambient \ntotal suspended particulates (TSP) level exceeds PRC Grade II standards in all the project cities; \nambient sulfur dioxide (SO2) concentrations frequently exceed Grade II standards. \n \n4. \nThe project area is mostly urbanized  and industrialized, with some land still utilized for \nagriculture. No cultural or historic structures or features are known to exist in the project area. \nOngoing  ecological  improvements  include:  creation  of  approximately  5,800  hectares  of  green \nspace  in  urban  areas;  planting  of  1.5  billion  trees;  and  establishment  of  45  nature  protection \nreserves, accounting for 7.4% of the total area of the province. The provincial population in 2003 \nwas 41.61 million, of which 90.9% was in urban areas. Provincial gross domestic product (GDP) \ngrew 10.2 % per year in real terms from 1990 to 1995, and 8.6% per year from 1996 to 2000. In \n2003, GDP was CNY600.25 billion, and the per capita GDP was CNY14,426. GDP grew by 7.2% \nin  2001  8.4%  in  2002  and  11.5%  in  2003.  In  the  project  area,  there  are  seven  provincially \ndesignated poverty counties. In 2003, the urban disposable per capita income was CNY7,241, \n\n                                                 \n1   Coal mine methane (CH4) is a gas produced by in-mine drilling and drainage; coal bed methane is produced from \n\nsurface wells drilled into unmined coal seams. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n41 \n\n \nand the rural poor per capita income was CNY2,934. The registered urban unemployment rate \nwas  6.7%,  but  the  effective  rate  may  be  higher.  In  2001,  1.06 million citizens enjoyed  social \nsecurity benefits. In 2003, about 1.6 million citizens received social security benefits.  \n \nD. \n\nAnticipated Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n5. \nThe Project is designed to reduce air pollution emissions, both regional and indoor, by \nexpanding  clean  energy  supplies  and  improving  energy  efficiency.  Except  for  short-term \ndisruptions during construction, no negative impacts directly due to project design, location, and \noperations have been identified. Project impacts, mitigation measures, monitoring requirements, \nand  reporting  responsibilities  are  summarized  in  Table  A8.  Gas  leakage  from  pipeline \ntransmission and distribution systems will be reduced, as will explosion hazards associated with \ncoal mining and gas transmission and distribution. CMM will be produced from existing mines, \nand CBM will be produced from new surface wells; new mining is not required. Enhanced CMM \nand CBM production will reduce mine explosion hazards by reducing the amount of methane gas \nin  the  mine  working  space.  Methane  and  hydrogen  sulfide  (H2S) are monitored by automated \nsystems that trigger alarms when methane concentration in  the air is within explosive limits and \nwhen H2S is above designated workplace safety limits. Regional air quality will improve with the \nclosure  of  small,  inefficient,  coal-fired  boilers,  more  efficient  gas  transmission  and  distribution \nsystems, and reduced coal use. The following reduction of coal consumption and emissions will \nbe achieved: (i) coal savings of 217,500 tons per year (t/y); (ii) TSP of 18,800 t/y; (iii) SO2 of 2,600 \nt/y; (iv) nitrogen oxides (NOx) of 1,700 t/y; and (vi) greenhouse gas of CO2 equivalent by 840,900 \nt/y. Water and soil pollution will be indirectly reduced due to a lower rate of pollutant transfer from \nair to water and soil, with reduced stress on local ecosystems. \n \n6. \nConstruction traffic, excavation and earthmoving, and aggregate processing facilities will \ngenerate  dust,  which  will  be  suppressed  with  routine  measures  (e.g.,  water  sprays  on \nconstruction  sites  and  roads,  tarpaulins  to  cover  trucks  hauling  raw  materials).  Construction \nvehicles  and  stationary  equipment  for  aggregate  processing  and  concrete  mixing  will  meet \nexisting  PRC  emissions  and  noise  standards.  Construction  activity  in  urban  areas  and  near \nsensitive  receptors  (schools,  hospitals,  etc.)  will  be  limited  to  daylight  hours;  additional  noise \nabatement  measures  such  as  temporary  barriers  will  be  constructed  as  necessary  to  meet \nnational and local standards. Traffic and communications may be occasionally disrupted during \nconstruction of the pipelines and the CBM/CMM stations. The city construction companies have \nsubstantial experience in minimizing the potential for and managing the occurrence of epidemic \ndiseases in the project area. \n \n7. \nResettlement and land acquisition requirements have been quantified and presented  in \nAppendix 9 and Supplementary Appendix M. A total of 412 small boilers in Benxi, Liaoyang, and \nYingkou  will  be  closed,  affecting  1,874  workers.  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  social protection \nstrategy,  GLP  and  the  PIAs  will  ensure  that  all  1,874  workers  affected  by  the  closure  are \nreemployed in a timely manner and in accordance with the reemployment action plan prepared by \nthe PIAs (Supplementary Appendix F), so that they will be at least as well off as they would have \nbeen in the absence of the Project. Employment opportunities for local people are estimated to be \n1,350 full-time individuals. The Project will generate thousands of person-years of unskilled labor. \n \n8. \nProject  Alternatives. Without the Project, the area will continue to rely on coal as the \nprimary  energy  source  for  heating  and  residential  use.  Conventional  natural  gas  reserves  are \ninsufficient to meet increasing clean energy demands. Hydropower resources are limited. Other \nrenewable  energy  options  have  yet  to  be  demonstrated  on  a  commercial  scale.  Demand-side \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n42 \n \nmanagement measures will continue to be driven by market forces, but will be insufficient in the \nnear-term to offset increasing energy demands. CMM and CBM are readily available alternatives, \nthe supply of which can be expanded through improved production methods. Improved utilization \nof coal in modern central heating systems is the most practical method of providing space heating; \ndesign considerations will result in provision of steam for industrial users. \n \nE. \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n\nConstruction  contractors  will  be  required  to  provide  basic  sanitation  facilities, domestic \n9. \nsewage  treatment,  solid  waste  management,  noise  and  dust  control,  and  personal  protective \nequipment  for  workers,  and  to  conduct  noise  and  dust  monitoring  at  construction  sites. \nConstruction  equipment  must  meet  relevant  PRC  emissions  and  noise  standards.  Local \nenvironmental  protection  bureaus  (EPBs)  will  be  responsible  for  routine  monitoring  of \nconstruction  activities,  as  well  as  conducting  routine  air  and  water  monitoring  at  designated \nmonitoring stations. The Liaoning provincial EPB will be responsible for oversight of local EPBs \nand will review data from construction contractors and local EPBs to determine if environmental \nrequirements are being met. The project management office (PMO) will designate at least one \nsuitably qualified professional staff member to serve as an environmental officer for the Project. \nThe PMO will be responsible for compiling progress reports for submittal to ADB twice a year. \nProject impacts, mitigation measures, monitoring requirements, and reporting responsibilities are \nsummarized in Table A8. \n \nF. \n\nPublic Consultation and Information Disclosure \n\nEnvironmental  evaluations  and  assessments  were  prepared \n\nfor  each  project \n10. \nsubcomponent, and included at least one public consultation for each subcomponent, primarily \nvia surveys in affected areas. Survey results indicated strong local support for the Project, based \non improved energy services, improved air quality and local ecological conditions, and expected \neconomic benefits (e.g., potential employment opportunities). \n \nG. \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\nThe Project will improve and expand clean energy supplies, improve energy efficiency, \n11. \nimprove  regional  and  indoor  air  quality,  and  reduce  the  explosion  hazards  associated  with \nmethane  gas  production,  transmission,  and  distribution.  Global  environmental  benefits  will  be \nrealized via expanded CMM production, capture and utilization of vented methane, and improved \nenergy efficiency, which will result in reduction of  methane and CO2 emissions. The anticipated \nimpacts  arise  primarily  from  construction  activities,  and  can  be  readily  mitigated  with  good \nengineering  practice  and  active  environmental  management.  The  Liaoning  provincial  EPB  will \nassume a lead role in assuring that the environmental management program is fully implemented. \nLocal EPBs in each project city will be responsible for routine monitoring and oversight. \n \nH. \n\nConclusions \n\n12. \nThe  environmental  examinations  and  assessments  being  conducted  are  adequately \nevaluating  the  potential  impacts  of  the  Project.  The  Executing  Agency  completed  all  of  the \nenvironmental assessments required by the PRC Government, and the relevant authorities have \napproved the environmental examinations and assessment reports for project subcomponents. \nBased on knowledge of project design, impacts, mitigation measures, and institutional capacity, \nenvironmental Category B is appropriate. \n \n\n \n\n\f\f\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n45 \n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN  \n\n \n1. \nThe Liaoning Environmental Improvement Project is composed of four main components \nwith  seven  subcomponents. Only one subcomponent,  the  Fuxin  Coal  Bed  Methane  and  Coal \nMine  Methane (CBM/CMM) Development, involves some minor land acquisition and temporary \nland  use  impacts.  Three households  will  permanently  lose  part  of  their  farmland  and \n46 households will have part of their farmland temporarily occupied during construction. Because \nno houses or structures will be demolished, therefore, no households need to be relocated. Based \non the number of the affected persons (APs) and the minor degree of impacts, the resettlement \nimpacts  are  classified  as  nonsignificant.  Consequently,  a  short  resettlement  plan  has  been \nprepared for this subproject (Supplementary Appendix M). The land acquisition and resettlement \nplan  is  designed  to  ensure  that  the  APs  will  be  better  off  as  a  result  of  the  Project.  The \nresettlement impacts of the Project by subcomponent are summarized in Tables A9.1 and A9.2. \nLess than 1 hectare (ha) of land will be permanently acquired and the temporary occupation about \n105 ha of land/roadways will require compensation for disruption of current land use. About 20 ha \nof  industrial  land  owned  by  the  project  implementation  agencies  (PIAs)  will  also  be  affected \ntemporarily. \n \n\nTable A9.1: Potential Resettlement Impacts of Project \n\nComponent \n\n \nCBM/CMM \nDevelopment \n\nSubcomp\nonent \n\n \nFuxin City  \n\n- \n- \n\nGas \nDistribution \nImprovement \n\nFushun \nCity \n\nCity  Central \nHeating \nSupply \n\nBenxi City \n\nBenxi City \n\nAnshan \nCity \nLiaoyang \nCity \n\nYingkou \nCity \n\nActivities with Potential Resettlement Impacts \n\n22 extraction wells require minor land acquisition (about 300 m2 each) \n3 above-ground methane gas storage tanks  and 3 gathering stations \nrequire minor land acquisition (extra 100 m2 for each) \n\n-  Gathering lines require temporary farmland disturbance for one month \n\n- \n\nduration \n50 km of newly constructed main pipeline between Qinghemen and \nFuxin requires some temporary land disturbance alongside the main \nroad, compensation to be paid to the civil engineering department \n-  Replacement of  15.5 km of pipes will cause minor temporary road \n\ndisruption of pedestrian road and lawn, compensation for pedestrian \nroad restoration to be paid to the municipal civil engineering \ndepartment, and compensation for lawn restoration to be paid to \nmunicipal landscaping administration department \n\n-  Replacement of  43 km of old pipes and construction of 5 km of new \npipes will cause some temporary disturbance along urban roads, \ncompensation to be paid to the civil engineering department \n\n-  Construction of 7 km pipeline will cause some temporary disturbance \nalong urban roads, compensation to be paid to the civil engineering \ndepartment \n\n-  Rehabilitation of existing facilities requires no land acquisition or \n\ndisturbance; no compensation will be required \n\n-  Construction of 4.2 km of heat distribution network and 55 heat \n\nexchange stations will cause minor disturbance along urban roads, \ncompensation to be paid to the municipal civil engineering department  \n\n-  Construction of 12 heat exchange stations and 40 km of heat supply \n\npipelines will cause minor disturbance along urban roads, \ncompensation to be paid to the municipal civil engineering department  \n\nCBM = coal bed methane, CMM = coal mine methane, km = kilometer, m 2 = square meter. \nSource: Project implementing agencies feasibility studies . \n\n \n2. \nThe total cost of land compensation and resettlement for all subprojects is estimated to be \nCNY36.5 million ($4.4 million equivalent).

Efforts were \n3. \nmade in close consultation with local officials and village committees/street committees during the \nproject  proposal  and  feasibility  study  stages  to  avoid  or  minimize  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement. The compensation of the permanent land loss is based on the Land Administration \nLaw  of  PRC,  1998  and  the  Liaoning  Provincial  Land  Administration  Regulations  issued  on \n31 January  2002.  Also,  the  resettlement  plan  was  prepared  in  accordance with  the  policy on \ninvoluntary resettlement (1995) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Based on consultations \nwith local governments and APs, and general practice in Fuxin city, compensation standards and \nrates were formulated. For permanent land acquisition, a total of 21 times average annual output \nvalue (AAOV) will be provided with 10 times AAOV for land compensation, 10 times AAOV for \nresettlement subsidy, and 1 times AAOV for green crop compensation. The total compensation \nrate will be CNY315,000/ha (21,000/mu), which is for dryland. Compensation for land acquisition \nwill be paid to the village collective. Due to the small amount of land acquisition, either land will be \nadjusted within the village group or cash compensation will be provided to the affected household \nor the affected village collective that loses the land. The resettlement subsidy will be paid directly \nto the land user (i.e., household or collective). Compensation for standing crops, auxiliaries, and \nother  assets  (e.g.,  trees,  fences)  will  also  be  paid  directly  to  the  APs.  For  temporary  land \noccupation  land,  CNY11.5/m2  (7,667/mu)  will  be  paid  for  compensation,  of  which  CNY1.5/  m2 \n(1,000/mu) goes to affected farmers and CNY10/m2 (6,667/mu) is paid as a fee to the township \ngovernment. The APs were notified about the key elements of the resettlement plan on various \noccasions during meetings, interviews, and socioeconomic surveys. A resettlement information \nbooklet (RIB) was distributed to all affected households in  November 2003. The socioeconomic \nsurvey  of  20  households  identified  some  poor  and  potentially  vulnerable households, some  of \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n47 \n\nthem ethnic minority families. CNY5,000/household will be provided to any vulnerable household \nthat is affected as additional financial assistance. \n \n4. \nThe  Fuxin  CBM/CMM  Development  and  Utilization  Company  (FXDUC)  will  be  fully \nresponsible for implementation, financing, and monitoring of land acquisition, compensation, and \nrehabilitation.  It  will  work  closely  with  affected  township  and  village  officials  who  will  be \nresponsible for administering land transfer and compensation payments. The grievance-redress \nprocedures  are  well  established  and  explanations  are  included  in  the  resettlement  information \nbooklet provided to all APs and villages. The preliminary cost estimate for the resettlement plan \nprogram  is  CNY1.45 million,  equivalent  to  $175,000,  including  contingencies.  Resettlement \nimplementation will commence in January 2005 and be completed once the pipelines are installed \n(expected by July 2006).  \n \nThere will be internal and external monitoring of the implementation of the resettlement \n5. \nplan.  Monitoring requirements  are specified in the  resettlement  plan.  Internal  supervision  and \nmonitoring will be done by FXDUC to ensure compliance with the provisions of the resettlement \nplan. The Executing Agency will ensure that resettlement progress is reported to ADB as part of \nquarterly  progress  reporting.  When  resettlement  activities  have  been  completed,  FXDUC  will \nprepare  a  resettlement  completion  report  for  submission  to  ADB.  External  monitoring  and \nevaluation  will  be  carried  out  by  a  social  specialist  under  the  project  loan.  Monitoring  and \nevaluation  reports  will  be  prepared  for  2005  and  2006,  and  submitted  to  ADB  by  15  April  the \nfollowing year. The Executing Agency  and ADB have agreed on a set of supervision milestones, \nwhich need to be in effect to ensure timely and effective implementation of resettlement activities \n(Table A9.3). \n \n\nTable A9.3: Resettlement Supervision Milestones for the Project \n\nNo. \n\nResettlement Task \n\nTarget \n\nResponsible Agency \n\nDeadline \n\nStatus \n\nDisclosure \n1.1  Information Booklet \n1.2  Distribute RP \n\n \n49 AFs \n17 villages  \n5 townships  \n3 districts \n\n \nFXDUC \nFXDUC \n\n1.3  RP Posted on ADB web site    \n \nApproval of RP \nRevised RP \n2.1  Submit RP to ADB \n \nAgreements \n17 villages  \n3.1  Village Agreements  \n49 AFs \n3.2  Household Agreements  \n \nResettlement Implementation \n20 families  \n4.1  Support Vulnerable People \n100 adults  \n4.2  Training of APs \n50 jobs  \n4.3  Employment of APs \n \nMonitoring and Evaluation \n5.1  Internal Monitoring Reports  Quarterly \n5.2  External Monitoring Reports  Annual (two) \n5.3  Completion Report \nDocumentation of \nConsultation \nDocumentation of Grievances  Continuous  \n\nOne \nContinuous  \n\nADB \n \nFXDUC \n \nFXDUC \nFXDUC \n \nFXDUC \nFXDUC \nFXDUC \n \nFXDUC \nConsultant and EA \nFXDUC \nFXDUC \n\nFXDUC \n\n \n\n \n\n30 Nov 2003  Complete \n25 Oct 2004   \n\n25 Sept 2004  Complete \n\n25 Oct 2004   \n   \n\n   \n30 Nov 2004   \n30 Nov 2004   \n   \nJan 2005   \nJan 2005   \nNov 2005   \n   \n\nJul 2006   \n \n\nOngoing \n\nOngoing \n\n \n\n1 Apr 2005  1st report due \n15 Apr 2006  1st report due \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, AF = affected family, AP = affected person, EA = Executing Agency, FXDUC = The \nFuxin CBM/CMM Development and Utilization Company, RP = resettlement plan. \nSource: Project implementing agencies feasibility studies. \n\n1. \n \n \n\n \n2. \n \n3. \n \n \n4. \n \n \n \n5. \n \n \n \n6. \n\n7. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n No \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n Yes \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\n \nIs  the  sector  identified  as  a  national \npriority  in  country  poverty  partnership \nagreement?  \n\nA. \n \nIs  the  sector  identified  as  a  national \npriority in country poverty analysis?  \n \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in PRC: \n \nIn line with the Government\u2019s energy sector strategy to promote socioeconomic development and to meet the basic \nneeds of the poor, increased clean gas and central heating supplies  are needed to support the national poverty reduction \nprogram. Adequate and reliable gas and central heating supplies are essential to human well-being in the cold northern \nprovinces. Gas and central heating supply  will reduce coal and wood burning that cause serious environmental and \nair-related diseases in the project areas. The poor, women, and children can be particularly vulnerable as they tend to be \nexposed more extensively to urban pollution than other population classes. A better urban environment can improve the \nlocal investment climate to attract more investment to the region and promote the development of the industry and \nservices sectors. Through careful design of project subcomponents and active policy dialogue, this Project provides \nspecific gas and central heating assistance programs to the poor so they can have reliable gas and central heating \nsupplies in the winter.  The Project will improve the safety of coal miners and improve the quality of life for the local \npeople. Overall, the gas and central heating supplies of the Project will complement poverty reduction efforts in the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). \n \nB. \nPoverty  analysis  has  been  treated  as  an  integral  part  of  project  design  and  based  on  quantitative  and  qualitative \nmethodologies. The project planning and design have made use of poverty data at the national, provincial, municipal, \nand subproject levels and involved field poverty assessments, questionnaire surveys , and stakeholder consultations , \nincluding with the project beneficiaries . Participatory methods were used to identify the local poor population and the \nprovisions that would help to improve the quality of their lives. Active policy dialogue led to the development of a poverty \nreduction and social strategy that includes the following components: \n \n1. Providing efficient and environmentally compatible gas and central heating supplies to the poor. The Project \nwill directly benefit a total urban population of about  2.7 million in the 6 project beneficiary areas of Fushun, Fuxin, \nBenxi, Anshan, Liaoyang, and Yingkou. Of the total beneficiaries, about  1.9 million urban residents will benefit from \nthe  gas  supply  and  0.8 million  from  central  heating  supply.  About  199,800  persons  or  about  7.4%  of  the  total \nbeneficiaries  are  the  poor  as  measured  by  the  various  city  poverty  lines.  The  increased  use  of  gas  and  heating \nsupplies (including the closure of 412 small inefficient coal-fired boilers  in Benxi, Liaoyang, and Yingkou) will reduce \nthe use of coal, wood, and coal briquettes that causes environmental and health impacts, particularly for the poor. The \nProject will indirectly benefit the entire urban population residing in the six project cities. \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention \n\nPoverty Analysis  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n2.  Creating jobs for the poor. The Project will create about 7,280 person-years of employment opportunities during the \nconstruction  phase  and  1,940  full-time jobs  during  the  operation  of  the  Project.  Of  these,  2,910 person-years of \nemployment  opportunities  will  be  filled  by  the  poor,  women,  and  minorities,  earning  CNY27.96 million  in  wage \npayments during the project construction period. An additional 780 full-time operational employment opportunities or \nCNY8.38 million of wage payment per year are expected to go to the poor, women, and minorities. In addition, local \nprocurement of the materials required for the Project is expected to create additional jobs. By increasing gas and \ncentral heating supplies to local residents, industries, commercial users and public institutions, the Project will result in \nimprovement of the socioeconomic infrastructure of the project area. \n\n \n3. Reducing environmental impacts on the poor. Through the development of methane gas supply, improved and \nincreased gas and central heating supplies, and closure of 412 small, inefficient and polluting coal-fired boilers, the \nProject will reduce air emissions of SO2, CO2, NOx, TSP, and solid wastes in the project areas. This will result in \ntremendous socioeconomic  and  environmental  benefits  to  the  local  communities  and  populations.  A better urban \nenvironment can improve the local investment climate to attract more investment to the region and stimulate growth in \nreal estate, services, recreation and tourism. This economic development will increase employment opportunities and \nincome for the local population. Improving air quality will reduce the morbidity and mortality rate of air-related diseases \nand associated medical costs, and loss of healthy working days in the project area. The poor, elderly, children, and \nwomen who have less coping resources and are more vulnerable, will benefit disproportionately from the reduction in \nair emissions. In particular, women usually spend more time than men on cooking; the length of their exposure to \nsmoke is higher than men. As such the Project will benefit women more than men. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n49 \n\n \n\n4. \n\nImproving occupational safety of miners. The CBM/CMM development subcomponent of the Project and the \nstrengthened coal mine safety programs committed by the project implementation agency (PIA) will improve the \ncoal mine safety at the project sites. In nonquantifiable terms, improved mine safety will prevent family members \nbecoming poor if a serious accident occurs. \n\n \n5. Enhancing  quality  of  life  for  the  poor. Survey results show that majority of the urban residents believe that the \nincrease of gas and heating supply will improve the overall quality of life, reduce the housework for women, decrease \nhealth problems, increase comfort and entertainment activities, and facilitate longer study in winter. \n\n \n6. Implementing gas and heating assistance programs for the poor. The average heating expenditure burden (the \nratio of heating expenditure and the household\u2019s monthly income) of the poor in the project areas is high. A typical poor \nhousehold living in a 40 square meter apartment unit in the project cities has a heating expenditure burden in the range \nof 21% to 27% of its total household expenditure. Through policy dialogue, the project cities and the PIAs have agreed \nto two specific programs to help the poor to pay for gas supply and winter heating.  These programs will ensure the \nmaximum amount for gas or central heating that a poor household as defined by the city poverty line, will pay is about \n5% of the household\u2019s monthly income. The PIAs will provide connection fee and tariff discounts to the poor. These \ndiscounts  will  come  from  the  cost  savings  from  the  efficiency  improvement  of  the  Project and financial profits of \ninvestment under the project. If the household\u2019s payment plus the discounts given by the PIAs is less than the total gas \nor heating bill, the remainder of the gas or heating bill will be covered by the \u201cheating assistance fund\u201d set up by city \ngovernments  and managed by city finance bureaus . Similar approaches have been successfully implemented in some \nstates (e.g., Ohio, Pennsylvania) in the U nited States and other countries. This approach is consistent with ADB policy \nthat tariff subsidies should be transparent and explicit, and that the government social objectives should be separated \nfrom commercial management of enterprises. The discounts to the poor planned by the PIAs and preliminary cost \nsavings are summarized below: \n\n \n(i)  The  PIA  of  the  Fuxin  CBM/CMM  development  plans  to  offer  50%  discount  for  gas  connection  and  20%  tariff \ndiscount for 15,000 poor households  from 2004 to 2006. The estimated annual savings for the poor households \ninclude CNY12.75 million from the connection fee and CNY1.69 million from the tariff. \n\n(ii)  Under the Fushun gas distribution improvement, the PIA plans to provide 100% free gas connection and materials \ncosts  for 2,500 poor households from 2004 to 2008 and 40% tariff discount for 1,500 poor miner households  living in \nthe Aiyou Lujiadian and Qingmen Bishan mining districts from 2004 to 2008. It will result in annual savings of about \nCNY7.5 million  from  the  connection  fee  and  materials  costs  and  CNY1.5 million  from  the  tariff  for  the  poor \nhouseholds. \n\n(iii)  The PIA of the Benxi gas improvement plans to offer 50% discount for gas connection and 20% tariff discount for \n9,000 poor households  from 2005 to 2009. The expected savings for the poor households are CNY7.65 million from \nthe connection fee and CNY1.01 million from the tariff. \n\n(iv)   The  PIA  of  the  Benxi  central  heating  supply  plans  to  provide  free  heating  supply  connection  for  1,200  poor \nhouseholds between 2004 and 2005 and reduce 50% of the monthly user fees for 7,770 poor households  between \n2004 and 2007 under the city poverty line. In total, it will result in savings of CNY1.8 million from  connection fee and \nCNY7.12 million from the tariff per year for the poor households. \n\n(v)   The PIA of the Anshan central heating supply plans to provide free heating supply to 5,400 poor households. It \nwould result in a total annual saving of CNY7.452 million for the poor households  between 2004 and 2008. The \ncompany will also waive 85% of heating cost for the retiree-headed 2,100 families of bankrupt enterprises  from 2004 \nto 2008. It will result in a total saving of CNY2.463 million per year for these families . \n\n(vi)  The PIA of the Liaoyang central heating supply plans to provide 50% discount for heating connection and 50% tariff \ndiscount  for  9,200  poor  households   between  2004  and  2006.  In  total,  it  will  result  in  annual  savings  of \nCNY19.32 million from the connection fee and CNY6.07 million from the tariff reduction for the poor households. \n\n(vii)  For the Yingkou central heating supply, the PIA plans to offer 50% discount for heating connection between 2004 \nand 2005 and 40% tariff reduction for 2,000 poor households between 2005 and 2007. The total annual savings for \nthe beneficiaries are estimated to be CNY2.85 million from connection fee and CNY1.06 million from tariff reduction. \n\n \nIn summary, a total of 90,870 poor households living under the city poverty lines classified for those with incomes under \nthe minimum living guarantee (MLG) in the project cities will benefit from the gas and central heating supply connection \nand tariff discounts offered by the PIAs , of which 38,900 poor households from gas and heating supply connection \n(including 26,500 poor households from gas and 12,400 poor households  from heating) and 51,970 poor households \nfrom user fees (25,500 poor households from gas and 26,470 poor households from heating).1 The annual savings will \nbe CNY51.87 million for the connection fees and CNY28.38 million for tariff reductions for the beneficiaries. The project \ncity  government-funded  gas  supply  and  central  heating  assistance  program  should  supplement  the tariff discounts \noffered by the PIAs so that the poor households can have sufficient gas and heating supply.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1   Of the total beneficiary households, 35,200 households are double-counted in the calculation, as they will benefit \n\nfrom both the discount of connection fee and tariff reduction. \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nFor successful implementation of the above two specific gas and heating assistance programs for the poor and flow of \nthe benefits to the poor, the following mechanisms will be established by the city governments and the PIAs:  \n\n \n(i) Gas Connection and Tariff Discounts. First, those who are certified as poor households u nder the municipal MLG \nissued by the city civil affairs bureaus, will be identified by the gas bill collectors of the PIAs at the end of each year. \nThe PIAs will directly waive or deduct the gas connection discounts from the charges of gas connection fee and their \ntariff discounts from the monthly gas bills. The cost will be covered by the cost savings of efficiency improvements \n(about 25% to 50% transmission leakage reduction or about CNY250,000 for each subproject at average per year) and \nannual financial profits of the PIAs, and if necessary, the subsidies from the city government\u2019s special fund.  \n \n(ii) Heating  Connection  and  Tariff  Discounts. The PIAs will identify those who are certified as poor households \nunder the municipal MLG issued by the city civil affairs bureaus from June to October each year, and then submit the \nlist  of  poor  households  to  street  administration  offices,  district  civil  affairs  offices,  municipal  civil  affairs  bureaus, \nmunicipal heating supply offices, and municipal finance bureaus for verification and approval. The poor households, \nonce identified by the PIAs and approved by the municipal finance bureaus, will be eligible for the connection and tariff \ndiscounts. The general principle under the specific heating assistance program is that the poor household\u2019s heating \nexpenditure will not exceed 5% of their total monthly expenditure.  \n \nThe will be implemented by the PIAs through waiving or deducting directly from the charges of heating connection fee \nand monthly heating bills. The PIAs portion will be the cost savings from efficiency improvements and financial gains of \nthe investment under the Project. The proportion financed by the established \u201cheating assistance fund\u201d of the city \ngovernments will come from annual municipal fiscal budget. The total annual amount of the heating assistance fund \nwill be determined by the number of the poor households submitted by the PIAs in October each year (before the \nheating season starts). The subsidy coverage of the city governments for the project subcomponents will depends on \nthe PIAs abilities to cover the discounts. The fund will be managed and disbursed by the city municipal finance bureaus \nto municipal heating supply office, and then to the PIAs. In turn, the PIAs will deduct the proportion financed by the \n\u201cheating assistance fund\u201d from the bill of the poor households.  \n\n \n7. Reemployment of affected workers. The heating supply subcomponent will result in closing of  412 existing small \nboilers in Benxi, Liaoyang, and Yingkou, affecting 1,874 workers. The PIAs have agreed to reemploy all the affected \nworkers  in  other  similar  units  of  their  business  or  retrain  them  for  reassignment.  The  PIAs  have  developed  their \nrespective reemployment plan (Supplementary Appendix M) for the affected workers with a common goal that the \naffected workers would not be financially worse off than they would have been without the Project. \n\n Yes \n\n   No \n\n  No  \n\n  Yes              \n\nParticipation Process \n\n \nC. \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nDuring project preparation, stakeholder analysis has been conducted, including the identification of stakeholders and \ntheir roles in the Project. The public consultation/participation has been the core element of the project design and will \ncontinue to be the core element during the project implementation and was prepared through community-driven design \nmechanisms  involving  various  stakeholders,  including  the  project  beneficiaries .  A  community  participation  and \nawareness program will be formulated and implemented by the PIAs  to serve as an ongoing consultation mechanism for \nthe involvement of all stakeholders. \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nA resettlement information booklet for Fuxin CBM/CMM development subcomponent has been distributed to APs. The \nresettlement  plan  of the Project  was  distributed  to  the  government  of  Liaoning  province,  PIAs,  affected  townships, \nvillages committees, and street committees and published on the ADB's resettlement web site in October 2004. Further \nconsultation  with  people  affected  by  the  Project  will  continue  throughout  the  land  acquisition  process. Ongoing \nconsultations will also be carried out by the PIAs  to understand and meet the evolving needs and expectations of the \nusers as well as increase the awareness of the public, especially the beneficiaries, about the benefits of the Project, and \nencourage  the  active  involvement  of  local  communities  to  maximize  their  support  to  the  Project,  promote  gas   and \nheating consumption and saving, and raise the social acceptance of user fees. The consultations can take the forms of \nannual questionnaire surveys by consumer category, combined with ad hoc community forums. Women\u2019s organizations \nand schools usually have extensive networks that can be used for the distribution of information materials and survey \nquestionnaires.   \n \nD. \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nTo maximize the project benefits to women, preferential policies will be given to women for the employment and training \nopportunities generated from the Project construction  and operation phases, and the proposed poverty reduction  \n \n \n\nGender Development \n\n\fprograms  of  the  Project.  Women\u2019s  needs  and  interests  will  be  represented  in  project  implementation.  A  proactive \nemployment quota system and targeted training programs for the women will be adopted by the PIAs. Over 40% of the \nemployment  opportunities  will  be  filled  by  women  and  the  poor  with  the  implementation  of  gender  equity policies. \nParticular attention will be paid to women during the land acquisition and resettlement process. \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n\n   Yes \n\n   No \n\n \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n51 \n\n \n\n \nE. \n\n \nItem \n \n\nSocial Safeguards and other Social Risks \n\nSignificant/Not \nSignificant/None  \n Significant \n\nResettlement \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n \nStrategy to Address Issues \nThe impacts of permanent land acquisition and temporary land \noccupation by the project construction are very limited. A short \nresettlement plan has been prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s \ninvoluntary resettlement policy and the PRC Land \nAdministration Law and associated provincial and local laws \nand regulation to ensure the affected people will be made better \noff, or at least not worse off, as a result of the Project. The \ncompensation, resettlement, and rehabilitation strategy and \nimplementation are included in the resettlement plan. \nThe affordability of the poor has been assessed. In the project \ncities, heating bills account for 21 to 27% of the average \nmonthly incomes  of the poor households under the city poverty \nlines. Through active policy dialogue, the PIAs and project cities \nhave agreed to fee and tariff discounts and a city \ngovernment-funded \u201cheating assistance fund\u201d to the poor so the \neligible poor households will not pay more than 5% of their \nmonthly income for gas and/or central heating supply. \nThe construction and operation of the Project will generate \nabout 7,280 person-years of employment opportunities during \nthe project construction and 1,940 full-time jobs during the \noperation of the Project to the local beneficiaries. The closure of \n412 small boilers will affect about 1,874 workers. \nReemployment plans has been prepared by the PIAs to ensure \nthat all the affected workers will be reassigned to other similar \njobs or retrained for other jobs (Supplementary Appendix F). \nThe affected workers would not be financially worse off than \nthey would have been in the absence of the Project. The \ngovernment of Liaoning province will ensure that no job and \nincome losses happen. \nThe Project will benefit all urban residents regardless of their \nethnicity, however ethnic minorities will also benefit \nproportionally. There are about 401,760 (or 15% of total project \nbeneficiaries) minority persons, including Hui, Mongolian, \nManchurian, Korean, and Xibo, who will benefit from the \nincreased and improved gas and central heating supplies . No \nfurther measures are required to safeguard ethnic minorities . \nAbout 10 Mongolian households and two Hui households will be \naffected by the land acquisition for the Project. Particular \nattention and special provisions will be paid to them, including \nCNY5,000 social assistance fund per affected household to \nensure that their interests, rights , and sociocultural customs are \nprotected. These provisions are presented in the resettlement \nplan and summary resettlement plan. \n \n\nPlan \nRequired \n Full \n\n Short \n\n None \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \nAffordability \n\n \n \nLabor \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n \n \nIndigenous \nPeoples \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n \nOther Risks \nand/or \nVulnerabilities \n \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \n\n \n\nPROJECT ECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\nDemand Forecast and Least-Cost Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nA demand forecast for each subcomponent was carried out by the Executing Agency, and \nthe project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) consultants reviewed the demand forecast \nand  concluded  that  the  risk  associated  with  demand  forecast  is  minimal  (Supplementary \nAppendix N). This is because the Project will provide supply to meet only a fraction of the total gas \nand heating demand in the project cities. Part A of the Project will supply methane gas for meeting \nthe existing cooking and water heating demand. The gas distribution component will provide gas \nto only a fraction of the total incremental demand in the project cities. The city central heating \nsupply component will replace the existing small inefficient boilers to meet the existing heating \ndemand. The risks associated with the demand forecast in the economic and financial viability \nanalyses are minimal. \n \nA least-cost analysis was performed for the two categories of end use to be served by the \n2. \nProject, including: (i) household cooking and water heating and (ii) household space heating. The \nleast-cost analysis used constant 2003 prices and a discount rate of 12%. Tradable commodities \nwere  valued  at  border  prices  at  the  prevailing  exchange  rate  (CNY8.3/$1.0).  Nontradable \ncommodities  were  valued  at  shadow  prices,  using  a  mix  of  standard  and  specific  conversion \nfactors.1 For  household  cooking  and  water  heating,  the  analysis  indicates  that  coal  gas  is  the \nleast-cost  option.  For  household  space  heating,  the  least-cost  analysis  concludes  that  the \ncombined heat and power generation option proposed for the Yinkou city central heating supply \nand  the  large  centralized  boilers  proposed  for  other  cities  for  central  heating  supplies  are  the \nleast-cost options. When coal bed methane/coal mine methane (CBM/CMM) are available, they \nare the least-cost options. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  was  calculated  for  each  project \nsubcomponent and for the whole Project. Consistent with the  least-cost analysis, the economic \nanalysis applied conversion factors for investment costs for land,2 equipment costs, fuel costs, \nand operation and maintenance costs, where applicable.  The input data and assumptions were \nreviewed by the PPTA consultants and found appropriate. For the EIRR calculations, the benefits of \noutput were mainly valued on the basis of cost saving of alternative fuels . The cost-saving benefits \nwere valued as the cost differences of the alternative energy supply options with and without the \nProject. A survey was carried out to determine the appropriate energy supply options for each \ncategory of consumers.  The  local  environmental  benefits  were  taken  into  account  in  the  EIRR \ncalculations. Transmission and distribution losses were based on the statistics of historical line loss \nrates in each city. \n \n4. \nThe EIRR calculation takes into account only the main benefits of different components \nbut includes all project-related costs. The cost savings of alternative fuels are the main economic \nbenefits. This approach yields EIRRs ranging from 10.0% to 18.5% without and 16.8% to 43.8% \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return \n\n                                                 \n1   A standard conversion factor of 0.93 was used. Border prices were used for all imported items. Local costs were \nshadow  priced  using  group  and  specific  conversion  factors:  1.0  for  equipment,  1.67  for steel, 0.76 for cement, \n0.82 for timber, 2.0 for skilled labor, and 0.67 for unskilled labor. Taxes and duties were excluded. \n2   Land is valued at the economic opportunity cost (the estimated value of the best alternative utilization). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n53 \n\nwith  the  local  environmental  benefits  for  the  project  subcomponents,  and  13.6%  without  and \n26.3%  with  the  local  environmental  benefits  for  the  whole  Project.  Sensitivity  analyses  were \nperformed for each subcomponent  (details in Supplementary Appendix P). For the EIRR of the \nwhole Project in Table A11.2, sensitivity analysis showed the EIRR would decrease to (i) 20.7% if \nthe Project was to experience a cost overrun of  20%; (ii) 19.6% if the benefits were reduced by \n20%; (iii) 22.7% if the Project was to experience a commissioning delay of 1 year; and (iv) 12.3% \nif (i), (ii), and (iii) all happened. \n \n\nTable A11.1: Summary of Economic Internal Rate s of Return (%) \n\nSubcomponent \n\nWithout  \nEnvironmental Benefits \n\nWith Local \nEnvironmental Benefits \n\n \nFuxin CBM/CMM Development \nFushun Gas Distribution Improvement \nBenxi Gas Distribution Improvement \nAnshan  Central Heating Supply \nBenxi Central Heating Supply \nLiaoyang Central Heating Supply \nYingkou Central Heating Supply \nWhole Project \n \n\n \n\n \n\n18.5 \n10.0 \n12.4 \n13.6 \n10.8 \n13.9 \n10.4 \n13.6 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n18.5 \n16.8 \n17.3 \n28.9 \n25.2 \n43.8 \n18.1 \n26.3 \n\nCBM = coal bed methane, CMM = coal mine methane, EIRR = economic internal rate of return. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nEnvironmental Benefits \n\n \nC. \n \n5. \nAn economic evaluation of the environmental impacts of the Project was carried out based \non the benefits transfer method.

The EIRRs presented in \nTable  A11.1  have  included  only  the  local environmental benefits.  If  the  global  environmental \nbenefits  were  added  to  the  project  benefits,  the EIRR for the whole Project would increase to \n28.8%. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fTable A11.2: Economic Internal Rate of Return for Liaoning Environmental Improvement Project\n\nItem\n\n2004 2005\n\n2006 2007 2008 2009 2010\n\n2011 2012 2013 2014\n\n2015\n\n2016 2017\n\n2018 2019 2026 NPV\n\n5\n4\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\ni\n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n1\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n145\n0\n0\n\n272\n0\n36\n\n414\n0\n36\n\n418\n0\n36\n\n421\n0\n36\n\n422\n1\n36\n\n423\n1\n36\n\n423\n1\n36\n\n423\n1\n36\n\n423\n1\n36\n\n423\n1\n36\n\n423\n1\n36\n\n423\n1\n36\n\n423\n1\n36\n\n423\n1\n36\n\n423\n1\n36\n\n145\n\n309\n\n451\n\n455\n\n458\n\n459\n\n460\n\n460\n\n460\n\n460\n\n460\n\n460\n\n460\n\n460\n\n460\n\n \n460 2,770\n\n166\n27\n396\n588\n\n37\n94\n131\n\n71\n37\n245\n353\n\n55\n168\n223\n\n0\n0\n71\n71\n\n71\n217\n288\n\n0\n0\n17\n17\n\n0\n0\n12\n12\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0  \n0\n0\n\n    \n\n876\n\n71\n218\n289\n\n72\n218\n290\n\n72\n218\n290\n\n72\n218\n290\n\n72\n218\n290\n\n72\n218\n290\n\n72\n218\n290\n\n72\n218\n290\n\n72\n218\n290\n\n72\n218\n290\n\n72\n218\n290\n\n72\n218\n290\n\n72\n218\n \n290 1,804\n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return Calculation\n\nI.

This  appendix  describes  the  notes  and  assumptions  used  in  the  financial \nevaluation. All the costs and prices are expressed in constant 2003 prices. The economic lives of \nthe subprojects are estimated at 20 years with no residual value. The financial operations of the \nindividual project implementation agencies (PIAs) for the Liaoning Environmental Improvement \nProject  (the  Project)  were  projected  based  on  the  assumptions  described  in  Appendix  7.  The \nprojected financial statements are shown in Supplementary Appendix K. \n \n2. \nBenefits and Costs. The benefits from the Project will be derived from the sales of output \nfrom the individual subprojects based on the projected production levels and applicable tariffs. \nThe capital costs include physical contingencies but exclude price contingencies and financial \ncharges during development. The agreed transfer prices or projected purchase costs of inputs \nwere considered. Other operating costs include personnel, distribution, administration, and other \nexpenses. \n \nFinancial Internal Rate of Return. The financial viability of the Project was subjected to \n3. \nsensitivity  analysis  under  various  adverse  conditions.

The cost of equity was assumed to be 8.0%, based on the current yield on the \nlong-term government bond, plus an assumed risk premium of 3.0%. Income tax was 33.0%, and \nthe average domestic inflation rate was 3.0% per year. \n\n \n\n\f5\n6\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\ni\n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n2\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n       Table A12.2:  Financial Internal Rate of Return\n          (CNY million)\n\nItem\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n1.

The approach takes only the direct project benefits \ninto account in assessing poverty impact. The direct project benefits include: (i) lower gas and \nheating  tariffs  due  to  more  efficient  supply  and  (ii) environmental  benefits.  The  methodology \ninvolves three steps. The first step is to estimate the present value of net financial and economic \nbenefits  by  participating  group.  Next,  group-wise,  the  financial  benefits  are  deducted  from  the \neconomic  benefits  to  give  the  distribution  of  net  economic  benefits.  Finally,  the  net  economic \nbenefits (NEB) accrue to the poor according to the proportion of each group that is poor. A poverty \nimpact  ratio  expressing  the  proportion  of  NEB  accruing  to  the  poor  can  be  calculated  by \ncomparing NEB to the poor with NEB of the Project as a whole. 1 The analysis used constant 2003 \nprices, a standard conversion factor of 0.93, and a discount rate of 12%. Tradable commodities \nwere  valued  at  border  prices  at  the  prevailing  exchange  rate.  Nontradable  commodities were \nvalued at shadow prices, using a mix of standard and specific conversion factors. Net financial \nbenefits (NFB) and NEB are expressed in yuan (CNY). \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe  NFB  are  equal  to  sales  revenue  of  CNY2,671 million  minus  capital  costs  of \nCNY740 million, operating costs of CNY1,744 million, labor costs of CNY246 million, and income \ntaxes of CNY121 million. The NFB of the Project shows a loss of CNY181 million in net present \nvalue at 12% discount rate (Table A13.1). The NEB of the Project expressed at the domestic price \nlevel  are  CNY1,012 million.  They are  equal  to  gross  benefits  of  CNY3,887 million  (including \nconsumer surplus and environmental benefits) minus capital costs of CNY800 million, operating \ncosts of CNY1,866 million, and labor costs of CNY208 million (wages valued at the shadow price \nof labor for both skilled and unskilled labor). \n \n3. \nThe difference between the NEB and the NFB is distributed by groups. The difference of \nCNY1,193 million is made up of (i) consumer surplus of CNY307 million (mainly in terms of the \ndifference  between  the  without-project  cost  of  gas  and  heating  supply  and  the  with-project \nexpenditure on gas and heating plus the value of gas and heating supply consumed but not paid \nfor; (ii) the environmental benefits of CNY909 million from efficiency improvement, and closure of \nsmall,  coal-fired  boilers;  (iii) the  difference  between  financial  and  economic  cost  of  capital \ninvestment and operating costs of CNY60 million and CNY122 million, respectively (mainly due to \ngovernment taxes and duties, overvaluation of the exchange rate, and other price distortions); \n(iii) loss to skilled labor of CNY31 million (current wages less opportunity cost of labor); (iv) gain of \nunskilled labor of CNY68 million; and (v) income taxes of CNY121 million.  \n \n4. \nThe differences between the NEB and the NFB give rise to losses and gains among the \nproject participants. Considering the overall result of a NFB of negative CNY181 million and a \nNEB of CNY1,012 million for the Project, the NEB exceeds the NFB by CNY1,193 million. Skilled \nlabor will lose by CNY31 million and the gain of unskilled labor by CNY68 million at the project \nwage levels that are lower (higher) than the opportunity costs, while the consumers will gain from \ntheir consumer surplus of CNY307 million. The investor (project companies) of the Project will \nloss  CNY181 million  at  a  discount  rate  of  12%.  Since  project  companies  are  state-owned \nenterprises, the CNY181 million losses could be considered as the Government's financial loss \n                                                 \n1  The  poverty  impact  ratio  is  based  on  the  distribution  of  project  net  benefits.  This  differs  from  ADB\u2019s  project \n\nclassification criterion that is expressed in terms of the number of beneficiaries. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n59 \n\nPoverty Impact Ratio \n\n \nfrom  investing  in  the  Project  (unable  to  invest  in  a  project  with  12%  financial  return).  The \nenvironmental benefits of CNY909 million and income taxes of CNY121 million will be considered \nas  the  gains  to  the  Government  from  a  national  perspective.  Subtracting  the  losses  of \nCNY60 million  from  capital  costs  and  CNY122 million  from  operating  costs  results  in  a  net \neconomic gain to the Government of CNY848 million. \n \nC. \n \nThe differences between the financial and economic values, and the consequent gains \n5. \nand losses for different project participants, provide the basis for considering the impact of the \nProject  for  the  poor.  The  poor  account  for  7.4%  of  the  people  living  in  the  project  area.2 The \nincremental  gas  and  better  heating  supply  could  benefit  the  urban  poor  more  as  their \nconsumption are projected to increase faster because of their current low consumption levels. \nThe government of Liaoning province agreed to ensure that project cities consider establishing \nheating assistance programs for the poor with adequate annual government budget. Cost savings \nresulting from the efficiency improvement of the Project will be passed on the poor in the forms of \nheating bill discounts. These programs will be designed to alleviate the affordability problems in \nthe project cities. Based on the projected share of urban consumers, their electricity consumption \npattern,  number  of  the  poor  living  below  the  poverty  line,  the  projected  cost  savings  and  the \nestimated tariff reduction, the share of the consumer surplus going to the poor is estimated at \n7.0%. \n \n6. \nFrom a national perspective, the gains of CNY848 million (the gains of the Government) \nare  mainly  the  environmental  benefits  and  income  taxes  with  the  Project.  There  are  some \ngovernment \ninvestment  and  operating  costs  (CNY60 million  and \nCNY122 million, respectively). The gain is further offset by the financial losses of CNY181 million \n(at 12% discount rate). A 2001 Asian Development Bank (ADB) publication indicates that the poor \nare  disproportionately  affected  by  environmental  degradation. 3  The  poor  do  not  have  the \ninformation about and access to, or cannot afford more efficient (less-polluting) equipment and \nfuels. The gas distribution and heating supply networks are usually less well functioning or absent \nin the poorer sections of cities. The inadequate gas distribution and heating networks increase the \nexposure  of  the  poor  to  daily  doses  of  pollutants  as  well  as  the  risk  of  accidents. Indoor air \npollution  puts,  in  particular,  women  and  children  at  risk.  Based  on  the  discussions  with  the \nExecuting Agency (EA), the local environmental protection agency, and the project preparatory \ntechnical  assistance  (PPTA)  consultants,  this  analysis  estimates  that  the  share  of  the \nGovernment net benefits (environmental benefits) going to the poor below the poverty line will be \n17%. \n \n7. \nThe  direct  employment  effect  of  the  Project  during  construction  is  an  important  benefit \nfrom the Project. The local currency portion of the Project is about 54% of the project cost. Out of \nthe 54%, the non-equipment portion is substantial. Part of that will benefit the rural poor in the \nproject area by direct employment.4 Since the poor are normally unskilled labors, they will be the \nbeneficiaries of the Project as the current wages would be higher than their opportunity costs. \nBased on the projected labor employed in the Project through a special employment program for \nthe poor, particularly in gas distribution and central heating supply subcomponents,  15% of the \nsurplus for unskilled labor will go to the urban poor. \n\nfrom  capital \n\nlosses \n\n                                                 \n2   The poverty lines used in the poverty analysis are the official urban poverty lines in the project areas. \n3   ADB. 2001. Moving the Poverty Reduction Agenda Forward in Asia and the Pacific.  Manila. \n4   Project construction will create a significant amount of unskilled and semiskilled employment opportunities, most of \nwhich  can  be  filled  by  the  poor  under  the  report  of  the  PPTA  consultants:  Social-Economic Survey of Liaoning \nEnvironmental Improvement Project. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n60 \n \n8. \nTable  A13  shows  that  the  NEB  directly  accruing  to  the  poor  are  CNY141 million. The \nProject\u2019s  poverty  impact  ratio,  which  expresses  the  proportion of net economic benefits of the \nProject  accruing  to  the  poor,  is  13.9%.  Since  the  ratio  is  higher  than  the  ratio  of  the  poverty \npopulation  in  the  project  area  estimated  at  7.4%,  the  analysis  concludes  that  the  Project  is \npro-poor. The calculation poverty impact ratio is based on the direct benefits of the Project. All \nother indirect benefits are not captured in the poverty impact ratio. \n \nD. \n \n9. \nThe analysis concludes that the Project will support pro-poor economic growth. The risk \nanalysis on the poverty impact ratio calculation, together with the analysis on the probability of \noverall project failure, concludes that the probability of a negative outcome for the poor is minimal. \n \n\nConclusion \n\nTable A13: Benefit Distribution and Poverty Impact Analysis \n(present values at 12%, in CNY million) \n\n \n\n \nA.
