THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.   I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \n[Confidential information has been deleted] to Petronet LNG Limited for the Dahej Liquefied \nNatural Gas Terminal Expansion Phase 3 in India.1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n1.  Project Identification \n \n2.  India faces chronic energy shortages which have been one of the major constraints on \nand  bottlenecks  to  efficient  economic  growth.  Developing  liquefied  natural  gas  (LNG) \ninfrastructure is therefore critical for India's energy security and for the power industry. This \nsecond expansion of the Dahej LNG Terminal capitalizes on the success of Dahej\u2019s successful \nfirst- and second-phase terminals financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and aims to \nhelp address energy shortage in India. ADB has assisted Petronet LNG\u2019s growth in a phased \nmanner. In January 2004, ADB helped finance Petronet LNG\u2019s first terminal through an equity \ninvestment [Confidential information has been deleted]. The first terminal began commercial \noperations  in  April  2004  with  a  capacity  of  5  million  metric  tons  per  annum  (mmtpa). \n[Confidential information has been deleted]. To meet the still growing unmet demand for natural \ngas in India, ADB financed the first expansion of Petronet LNG [Confidential information has \nbeen deleted]. The first terminal expansion project commenced operations in July 2009 within \nthe original cost and time estimates. [Confidential information has been deleted], as per the \nextended  annual  review  report,  the  project  was  rated  highly  successful.  In  particular,  the \ndevelopment impact of the project and business success was rated excellent, and Petronet \nLNG\u2019s environmental, social, health, and safety performance as well as its investment outcomes \nwere rated satisfactory.  \n \n3.  Natural gas is increasingly a choice for cleaner fuel in India but domestic production \nremains insufficient to meet growing demand. This unmet demand is being filled by imported \nLNG. As the market leader, Petronet LNG is ideally placed to lead this much-needed LNG \nexpansion in India. In preparation for the second Dahej expansion, the borrower approached \nADB for financing based on the strong relationship ADB has established, ADB\u2019s profile in the \nmarket, and its ability to provide long-term financing and help catalyze other financing for the \nproject, particularly given the somewhat unsettled financial market conditions in India. From \ninitial discussions with Petronet LNG, the project team believed that the project possesses \nsound business fundamentals and ADB\u2019s participation will provide long-term financing needed \nfor the project. It will also confirm ADB\u2019s confidence in the sector and support for the Dahej \nexpansion [Confidential information has been deleted]. \n \n2.  Project Design \n \n4.  The project will involve the expansion to 15 mmtpa of the existing Dahej LNG terminal, \nwhich has a current capacity of 10 mmtpa. The project will, to a large extent, use the existing \nfacilities. Additional facilities will include two storage tanks and regasification facilities, and \ninstallation of associated utilities and facilities. The project site is located at Dahej in the Gulf of \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "2      \nKhambhat in Gujarat. The project design is based on a take-or-pay toll, with Petronet LNG \nacting as a tolling agent [Confidential information has been deleted]. \n \n5.   [Confidential information has been deleted]. \n \n3.  The Borrower \n \n6.  The borrower, Petronet LNG, was incorporated in April 1998 and is a public limited \ncompany established under the Companies Act, 1956. Given that the total equity participation of \npublic sector utilities and/or entities is 50%, Petronet LNG is considered a nongovernment \ncompany, enjoys the autonomy available to companies in the private sector, and is subject to \nthe same regulations and competition that any other private sector company faces. Petronet \nLNG is promoted by a strong shareholder group composed of India\u2019s leading oil and natural gas \ncompanies: BPCL, rated Baa3 by Moody\u2019s; GAIL, rated Baa2 by Moody\u2019s; IOCL, rated AAA by \nCrisil  ; and Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited, rated Baa1 by Moody\u2019s. Each promoter \nholds a 12.5% stake. In addition, GDF Suez is the strategic partner of Petronet LNG with 10% \nequity, and ADB and public shareholders are the other shareholders. \n \n7.  Petronet LNG currently owns and operates two LNG import and regasification terminals, \none with a capacity of 10 mmtpa at Dahej in Gujarat and the other with a capacity of 5 mmtpa at \nKochi in Kerala. In addition, the borrower is in the process of constructing a second LNG jetty at \nDahej to provide increased flexibility in port operations. Petronet LNG is locally rated AA+ by \nICRA Limited and India Ratings and Research, reflecting its strong business fundamentals. \n[Confidential information has been deleted]. \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n1.  Impact \n \n8.  The  second  expansion  of  the  Dahej  LNG  terminal  is  intended  to  strengthen  the \ndevelopment impact of the first two phases by helping India to move toward its target of greater \nnatural gas use and by enhancing its energy security. The project development impact includes \nthe diversification of the energy base in an environmentally sustainable manner. The project will \nhelp reduce the unmet energy demand in India, which has been one of the major constraints \nand bottlenecks for efficient economic growth. As of August 2013, the power sector in India had \na cumulative generation installed capacity of approximately 227 gigawatts (GW) and the energy \ndeficit was approximately 20.43 GW.2 \n \n2.  Outcome \n \n9.  The outcome of the project will be increased supply of natural gas to power plants, \nfertilizers plants, transporters and domestic consumers The majority of the LNG is destined for \nnorth and west India where the gas will be fed into the national grid as a cleaner fuel for \nelectricity generation. It will also help meet the enormous demand for natural gas for fertilizer \nproduction. The project is expected to contribute to the introduction of city gas distribution in \nseveral  cities  where  residential  and  commercial  consumers  will  benefit  from  increased \navailability of piped gas. The additional supply of 5 mmtpa will translate to greenhouse gas \nemission reductions of approximately 3.15 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per annum. \n                                                 \n2 Government of India, Central Electricity Authority. 2013.

Outputs \n \n10.  The duly completed and operated expansion facilities of the terminal will increase the \navailable capacity of LNG in India by 5 mmtpa. \n \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n \n11.  The  project  is  consistent  with  ADB's  Strategy  2020,  which  has  environmentally \nsustainable growth as one of the three strategic agenda items. Strategy 2020 emphasizes \ninvestment in infrastructure and promoting private sector participation. In addition, Strategy \n2020 highlights ADB's operational emphasis on expanding the use of clean energy sources.4 \n \n12.  The project is aligned with India\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2013\u20132017 specifically \nwith  regard  to  emphasis  on  environmental  sustainability  and  infrastructure  development, \nincluding expansion of energy access and catalyzing private sector investment.5 \n \n2.  Consistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n \n13.  The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, which stresses the importance of \nenergy  security  and  transition  to  a  low-carbon  economy,  and  reduction  of  emissions  of \ngreenhouse gases.6 \n \n3.  Lessons from Previous Operations \n \n14.  The previous project experience demonstrated that two main factors to be considered in \ndesigning new project: (i) long-term, fixed-cost financing is crucial for infrastructure development \nin India because of the limited capacity of Indian financial institutions to provide this type of \nfinancing; and (ii) ADB\u2019s participation in Petronet helped strengthen its operations as a private \nsector entity and ADB\u2019s presence was catalytic in helping Petronet raise additional financing.  \n \nD.

The proposed loan to Petronet LNG [Confidential information has been deleted] will be \nprovided from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. [Confidential information has been deleted] \n   \nB.  Value-Added by ADB Assistance \n \n16.  The proposed transaction merits ADB's assistance for the following reasons: \n(i)  ADB's participation will provide long-term, fixed-cost funding which is required for \nsuccessful implementation of the project and is not easily available in the market, \nparticularly with current financial market uncertainty in India. The majority of \nPetronet LNG revenues are fixed through its tolling contract and it would like its \nfinancing costs to be also fixed over the tenor of the financing, which is not \npossible with Indian banks. Through long-tenor, fixed-cost loan pricing, ADB will \nassist Petronet LNG in providing better financial management and help amortize \nthe high up-front capital costs over the long life of the asset to ensure project \nviability.  \n(ii)  ADB\u2019s  participation  can  potentially  catalyze  participation  by  commercial \ncofinanciers that would otherwise not have considered supporting the project. \nSuch participation will assist the borrower in diversifying its funding sources from \ndomestic banks for future projects.  \n(iii)  The loan will also confirm ADB\u2019s confidence in the sector and support for its \nmuch-needed expansion. \n(iv)  ADB\u2019s continued support to Petronet LNG\u2019s growth and participation in the third \nround of financing will add assurance for local and foreign financial institutions to \nco-lend because the project will be structured with best local and international \npractices and will adhere to high environmental and social standards. \n \nC.  [Confidential information has been deleted] \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Safeguards  \n \n17.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified \ncategory A for impacts on the environment and category C for both involuntary resettlement and \nindigenous peoples. The environmental impact assessment report was disclosed on ADB\u2019s \nwebsite on 2 August 2013 in accordance with the disclosure requirement of ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement. The existing terminal and proposed expansion site are part of an existing \nindustrial region and no environmentally sensitive areas or endangered terrestrial or marine \nflora or fauna exist. The plant generates limited air emissions, domestic waste water, solid and \nhazardous waste, and noise pollution. The 38.62 hectare site for expansion is government land \nallotted  on  a  long-term  lease  to  Petronet  LNG  by  the  Gujarat  Industrial  Development \nCorporation. The site is not inhabited and is not occupied or used for productive purposes, \neither by individuals or the community. As a result, there will be no resettlement impacts and no \npersons will be either physically or economically displaced by the proposed expansion. Impacts \non indigenous peoples are unlikely as there is no habitation or village with concentrations of \nscheduled tribes in the vicinity of the site. Since the commencement of its operations in Dahej in \n2004, Petronet LNG has had a strong involvement with the communities through its corporate \n ", "5 \nsocial responsibility initiatives in infrastructure, health, education, and community development. \nA public consultation was conducted and a grievance redress mechanism is in place to address \nconcerns and suggestions from the communities. The facility has an established environmental, \nhealth,  and  safety  cell  with  documented  procedures  on  training,  permitting,  and  incident \nrecording. It is also certified to ISO 9001, ISO 14001, and OSHAS 18001 standards. The facility \nprovides for safe and healthy working conditions for its staff as well as its contractors. Likely \noperational risks are identified and appropriate measures are in place, including an emergency \nresponse and disaster management plan. The potential environmental and social impacts of the \nproject have been identified and effective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, or compensate \nfor  the  adverse  impacts  have  been  incorporated  in  the  environmental  and  social  impact \nassessment document.7  \n \n18.  A  corporate  audit  was  conducted  on  Petronet  LNG\u2019s  quality,  health,  safety,  and \nenvironment  systems  and  procedures  and  its  past  and  current  performance  against  the \nobjectives, principles, and requirements of the Safeguard Policy Statement. The audit confirms \nthat  the  existing  LNG  terminal  operations  are  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental \nsafeguard requirements. Since lands for the Petronet LNG terminals and facilities are allotted by \nthe government, Petronet LNG\u2019s quality, health, safety, and environment systems currently do \nnot  formally  incorporate  procedures  to  screen,  assess,  and  address  impacts  pertaining  to \ninvoluntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. Petronet LNG is committed to (i) enhance the \nquality, health, safety, and environment manual to include the social safeguard and social \nprotection  requirements  of  ADB;  and  (ii)  adopt  a  corporate  environmental  and  social \nmanagement system to comply with ADB requirements and adequately manage the project\u2019s \nsocial and environmental impacts before the first disbursement. In addition, Petronet LNG will \nprepare and submit monitoring reports on the implementation of the environmental and social \nmanagement system and the subproject. The institutional capacity and commitment of Petronet \nLNG to manage the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts and risks are deemed adequate. \nInformation disclosure and stakeholder consultations are conducted in accordance with ADB \nrequirements. \n \n19.  Based on the review and assessment of the existing terminal\u2019s operations and the \ncurrent procedures for procurement, the audit confirmed that national labor laws and regulations \n[confidential information has been deleted] are followed, monitored, and reported. The audit also \nconfirmed Petronet LNG\u2019s commitment to provide work opportunities to the local community \nduring construction. The project is classified as having no gender elements. ADB will ensure \nthat the investment documentation includes appropriate provisions requiring Petronet LNG to \ncomply with national labor laws [confidential information has been deleted] for the ADB-financed \nportion of the project, in compliance with ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy.8  \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy  \n \n20.  Petronet LNG was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nand Policy on Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism (2003). Consistent \nwith its commitment to governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will require Petronet \nLNG  to  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with  internal  procedures  and  controls  following \ninternational best practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption, money laundering \n                                                 \n7 This consists of 16.00 hectares of land already available to Petronet LNG and 22.62 hectares of land transferred to \nthe Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation from the Gujarat state Forest Department.

Assurances \n \n22.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter), \nthe Government of India\u2019s no objection to the proposed assistance to Petronet LNG will be \nobtained. ADB will enter into suitable finance documentation, in form and substance satisfactory \nto ADB, following approval of the proposed assistance by the Board of Directors.  \n \nV.
