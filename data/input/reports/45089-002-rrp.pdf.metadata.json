The addition \nof  2  years  of  high  school  to  the  basic  education  system  is  part  of  an  overall  kindergarten-to-\ngrade-12 reform by the Department of Education (DepEd).2 Among other things, the introduction \nof  SHS  aims  to  (i)  provide  basic  education  graduates  with  the  skills  necessary  for \nentrepreneurship  or  formal  sector  employment,  (ii)  better  prepare  graduates  who  undertake \nfurther  education  or  training,  and  (iii)  spread  the  basic  education  curriculum  content  over  12 \nyears  rather  than the  previous  10  years.  Introducing grades 11  and 12 will  involve developing \nthe  SHS  program  (curriculum,  instructional  materials,  and  assessment  tools);  engaging  and \ntraining SHS teachers; delivering schools and other educational infrastructure; and establishing \nan SHS voucher program that will help finance the tuition of students who attend private SHSs.3 \nThe  infrastructure  for  some  DepEd  SHSs\u2014i.e.,  the  country\u2019s  public  SHSs\u2014may  be  delivered \nthrough a public\u2013private partnership (PPP) modality. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nStrategic Context \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe  Philippines  has  experienced  high  economic  growth  since  2012,  and  increased \ngovernment  revenues  have  significantly  improved  the  government\u2019s  fiscal  position  and  debt \nprofile. Gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an average of 7% in 2012 and 2013, making the \nPhilippines  one  of  the  fastest-growing  economies  in  Southeast  Asia.  Recent  economic  growth \nhas not had much impact on the incidence of poverty, which is high and has not changed since \n2006. 4  Unemployment  among  youth  aged  18\u201324  is  a  persistent  problem,  and  the  youth \nunemployment  rate  in  2013  was  more  than  twice  the  workforce  average. 5 The  Philippines\u2019 \neducation  system  is  not well-suited  to  addressing  these  labor  market  issues,  nor does it  allow \nthe country to take advantage of the demographic dividend its young labor force can provide.  \n \n4. \nPhilippine education faces significant challenges, particularly at the secondary level. The \nsecondary  net  enrollment  rate  of  64.6%  in  school  year  (SY)  2012/13  was  low,  particularly  for \nboys (59.5%, compared with 70.0% for girls). The overall rate also masked significant disparities \nin access between regions, urban and rural populations, and income classes. On average, the \ncountry\u2019s 18\u201324-year olds had only 8 years of schooling\u20147.9 years for males and 8.5 years for \nfemales.6 The quality of education provided is diminished by large class sizes; a crowded basic \neducation  curriculum;  insufficient  teaching  resources;  and  a  lack  of  specialist  teachers, \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  In the Philippines, basic education includes kindergarten, elementary school, and junior high school. Beginning in \n\nSY2016/17, it will also include senior high school. \n\n3  Includes private high schools and public and private postsecondary institutions. \n4  Philippine Statistics Authority. http://www.nscb.gov.ph/poverty/ (accessed 6 September 2014). \n5  ADB  computations  based  on  data  for  youth  18\u201324  from  Government  of  the  Philippines.

Annual  Poverty \nhttp://www.census.gov.ph/content/results-2011-annual-poverty-indicators-survey-apis \n2014). \n\nIndicators  Survey,  2011. \n(accessed  9  September \n\n\fparticularly  in  mathematics  and  science.  About  27.3%  of  DepEd  junior  high  schools  (JHSs) \nfaced shortages of qualified mathematics teachers (79% faced shortages of qualified instructors \nin  biology,  chemistry,  and  physics).  Learning  outcomes  are  poor,  according  to  2013  national \nassessment  results,  with  an  overall  mean  percentage  score  of  51.4%.  These  scores  are \nparticularly weak in mathematics (46.8%) and science (41.4%).7 \n \n5. \nA major factor contributing to sector challenges has been chronic underfunding during a \ntime  when  a  growing  school-age  population  has  increased  the  demand  for  basic  education.  A \ncompression  of  national  government  expenditures  during  1999\u20132004  led  to  the  contraction  of \ngovernment  spending  in  most  sectors,  including  basic  education.  This  resulted  in  large \nshortages  in  such  crucial  education  sector  resources  as  teachers,  classrooms,  textbooks, \nschool furniture, and water and sanitation facilities. Since 2006, DepEd spending has increased \nsignificantly.  During  2006\u20132013,  DepEd  spending  rose  by  an  average  of  12%  annually  in \nnominal terms, compared with a rate of just 4% during 1998\u20132005. Thus, after declining from a \npeak  of  2.9%  of  GDP  in  1997\u20131998  to  a  low  of  1.9%  of  GDP  in  2005,  national  government \nspending on basic education rose to 2.4% of GDP in 2013\u2014the same as in 2003. \n \nEducation is the government\u2019s central strategy for achieving inclusive economic growth \n6. \nby \nreduce  poverty  and  build  national \ncompetitiveness.  The  government\u2019s  Philippine  Development  Plan,  2011\u20132016  sets  out  broad \nstrategies  to  achieve  inclusive  growth,  including  the  provision  of  quality  basic  education.  With \nthe passage of the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013, the government expanded the basic \neducation system from 10 years to 1 year of kindergarten, 6 years of elementary school, 4 years \nof JHS, and 2 years of SHS. The universalization of kindergarten and revisions to the grades 1\u2013\n6  curriculum  are  expected  to  improve  the  internal  efficiency,  quality,  and  inclusiveness  of \nelementary education. The addition of SHS, alongside reforms to the grades 7\u201310 curriculum, is \nintended  to  bring  the  Philippines\u2019  basic  education  system  more  into  line  with  international \nstandards  and  make  SHS  graduates more  competitive domestically  and globally.  Beginning  in \nSY2016/17,  SHS  (grades  11  and  12)  will  offer  a  core  curriculum  and  specializations  in  four \ntracks: (i) academic, (ii) technical-vocational and livelihood, (iii) sports, and (iv) arts and design. \n \nB. \n\nin  human  capital  development \n\nProgram Rationale \n\ninvesting \n\nto \n\n7. \nThe  SHSSP  will  build  on  the  government\u2019s  recent  efforts  and  the  pioneering \nengagement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB)  in secondary education in the Philippines. \nThe program is aligned with the Philippine Development Plan, 2011\u20132016 and the government\u2019s \nbasic education sector reform agenda. It is also in line with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy \nfor  the  Philippines  for  2011\u20132016,  which  includes  education  as  a  focus  area,  and  with  its \nPhilippines country operations business plan, 2014\u20132016.8 The SHSSP reflects lessons learned \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  previous  operations  in  the  Philippines.  It  incorporates  findings  of  a  2008  country \nassistance program evaluation by ADB\u2019s Independent Evaluation Department that cited a need \nto  expand  the  use  of  sector-wide  and  programmatic  approaches  in  the  country.9 The  SHSSP \ncomplements  support  ADB  is  providing  to  improve  the  functioning  of  the  labor  market  in  the \nPhilippines, including assistance to review selected elements of the labor code and regulations \nand to pilot the JobStart Philippines program focusing on youth employment.10 \n                                                \n7  Government of Australia.  2012.

RBL  provides  a  flexible  mechanism  for \nsupporting  the  wide  range  of  interventions  required  to  establish  and  implement  SHS  as  a \nsustainable system-wide reform. The SHSSP\u2019s accountability framework provides incentives for \nthe  government  to  achieve  sector  outcomes  and  outputs  that  strengthen  its  systems  and \ninstitutional  capacity.  Preparing  the  RBL  has  enhanced  ADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  with  the \ngovernment  and  education  sector  stakeholders.  Due  diligence  assessments  provide  a \nreasonable  assurance  of  effective  achievement  of  results  through  RBL  from  measures  to \nstrengthen government program systems. \n \nIn  designing  the  SHSSP,  ADB  has  applied  lessons  it  has  learned  from  implementing \n9. \nRBL  in  other  programs.  These  include  the  need  to  have  a  small  number  of  essential \ndisbursement-linked indicators (DLIs), a strong focal unit dedicated to the RBL implementation, \nthe provision of technical assistance (TA) to strengthen government systems, and disbursement \nprotocols  that  are  not  ambiguous.  ADB  will  continue  to  add  value  by  helping  DepEd  access \nknowledge,  expertise,  and \nfurther  development  and \nimplementation  of  the  SHS  voucher  program;  promoting  ongoing  dialogue  among  DepEd,  the \ntechnical and vocational education and training (TVET) sector, and the higher education sector; \nand  further  evaluate  the  use  of  PPPs  for  the  delivery  of  education  infrastructure.  These  steps \nwill  stimulate  private  sector  participation  in  SHS,  alongside  the  planned  participation  of \nnongovernment organization networks in SHS program monitoring (e.g., of school construction) \nand  in  its  implementation  (e.g.,  by  identifying  opportunities  for  on-the-job  learning  in  the \ncommunity).  At  least  initially,  the  Fund  for  Assistance  to  Private  Education,  a  nongovernment \norganization, will operate the voucher program on behalf of DepEd. \n \nC. \n \n10. \nThe SHSSP will support the nationwide establishment and implementation of SHS during \n2014\u20132019  within  the  context  of  the  government\u2019s  wider  SHS  program.  The  SHSSP  supports  a \nsubset of the SHS program, with a focus on mathematics, science, and technical-vocational and \nlivelihood education; school infrastructure; the SHS voucher program; and systems strengthening. \nThe government SHS program scope and the SHSSP scope are in Table 1. \n \n\ninternational  experience  on \n\nProgram Scope \n\nthe \n\nTable 1: Program Scope \n\nItem \n\nOutcome \n\nKey outputs \n\nActivity types \n\nBroader Government Program \n\nResults-Based Lending Program  \n\nImproved \nbasic  education  system; \ngraduates  prepared  for  employment  or \nfurther education and training \n \nschools  and  other \nSHS  program, \neducational \nfacilities,  basic  education \nsector  leadership,  teacher  engagement \nand \ntraining,  basic  education  sector \nmanagement and administration  \n(i)  Curriculum,  learning  materials,  and \nassessment  tools  developed;  (ii)  teachers \ntrained;  (iii)  educational \nengaged  and \nto \nfacilities  delivered;  (iv)  PPPs  used \nfinance \nand \n(v) strengthened sector management \n\nenrollments; \n\nstudent \n\nEffective  SHS  system  established  and \nimplemented \n\nSHS program in mathematics, science and \ntechnical-vocational  and  livelihood;  MSS \nfor  school  facilities  in  DepEd  SHSs;  PPPs \nfor  school \ninfrastructure;  SHS  voucher \nprogram; fiduciary and safeguards systems \nand  TVL \n(i)  Science,  mathematics \ncurriculum  developed; \n(ii)  educational \nfacilities  delivered;  (iii)  assessment  of \nfacilities; \nPPP  modality \n(iv)  voucher  program  established;  and \n(v) procurement system strengthened \n\nfor  school \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nProgram \nexpenditure \n\nGeographic \ncoverage \n\nNationwide \n\nImplementation \nPeriod \n\n2014\u20132019 \n\n$4,410 million \n\n$300 million \n\nNationwide \n\n2014\u20132019 \n\nMSS = minimum service standard, PPP = public\u2013private partnership, SHS = senior high school.  \nSource:  Asian Development Bank. \n\n  \n\nProgram Results \n\nD. \n \n11. \nThe impact of the SHSSP will be enhanced employment of SHS graduates and those with \nsome SHS. The outcome will be an effective SHS system established and implemented. Some of \nthe program outcome indicators have been developed into DLIs. DLIs and the SHSSP program \naction plan (PAP) actions are grouped into four results areas: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nimproved.  The  SHSSP  will  support \n\nResults  area  1:  Quality  of  Department  of  Education  senior  high  school \nthe  development  and \nprogram \nimplementation of the core SHS curriculum and electives in four tracks, including \nthe  formulation  of  content,  learning  outcomes,  instructional  materials,  and \nnational  assessment  tools.  It  will  also  support  the  engagement  and  training  of \n84,000  teachers  to  allow  the  DepEd  to  achieve  its  minimum  service  standard \n(MSS) for the number of qualified mathematics and science teachers per student \nin  DepEd  SHSs  (DLI  1,  PAP  1.1\u20131.2,  1.4,  4.2,  and  4.5).  It  will  also  support  the \nintegration of TVET at the SHS level (DLI 2, PAP 1.1, 1.3\u20131.6, 3.2, 4.2, and 4.5). \nResults  area  2:  Minimum  service  standard  for  school  facilities \nin \nDepartment  of  Education  senior  high  schools  achieved.  The  SHSSP  will \nsupport  the  delivery  of  schools  and  classrooms  required  to  accommodate \nstudents at the SHS level. About 40,000 classrooms are expected to be needed \nover  the  SHSSP  period.  DepEd  is  preparing  local  school  division-level  plans  to \nidentify potential SHS providers (both DepEd and non-DepEd) and DepEd school \nlocations.  Delivery  of  these  schools  and  classrooms  will  help  ensure  that  the \nDepEd  achieves  its  MSS  for  the  student\u2013classroom  ratio,  which  is  set  at  40 \nstudents  per  classroom  at  the  SHS  level  (DLI  3,  PAP  2.1\u20132.4).  The  result  area \nalso  covers  an  assessment  of  the  feasibility  of  delivering  a  portion  of  schools \nusing a PPP modality (DLI 4, PAP 2.1\u20132.2, and 2.4). \nResults  area  3:  Senior  high  school  voucher  program  developed  and \nimplemented.  The government  currently  provides tuition fee  subsidies  to  some \nJHS  students  attending  non-DepEd  schools.  The  SHSSP  will  support  the \nextension of government assistance, through a voucher program, to graduates of \nDepEd JHSs and some graduates of non-DepEd JHSs to help them attend non-\nDepEd SHSs (DLI 5, PAP 3.1\u20133.6). The voucher amount will be set at about the \ncost  per  student  of public  provision  and will  partly  or fully  offset tuition  costs for \nthese  students.  The  voucher  program  will  provide  assistance  to  about  800,000 \nSHS students each year. It will be managed, at least initially, by the not-for-profit \norganization that manages DepEd financial support programs at the JHS level. \nResults  area  4:  Basic  education  management,  fiduciary,  and  safeguards \nsystems  strengthened.  In this  area, the  SHSSP  will  support the  strengthening \nof financial management, procurement, and other systems at the DepEd school, \nregion,  division,  and  central  levels  to  ensure  that  they  meet  government \nperformance targets. In particular, it will strengthen oversight and implementation \n\n \n\n\fof  the  SHS  voucher  program  and  supplement  ongoing  initiatives  to  improve \nDepEd  monitoring  and  evaluation  functions  currently  being  supported  by \nAustralian Aid (DLI 6, PAP 4.2\u20134.16). \n\n \nThe SHSSP will cover both the 2014\u20132015 preparation phase of the government\u2019s SHS \n12. \nprogram  and the  implementation phase  during  2016\u20132019. The  DLI matrix  for  the  preparation \nphase  includes  outputs  and  high-level  outputs  linked  to  outcomes  to  be  achieved  in  the \nimplementation phase. The RBL will finance several significant reforms as prior results. These \ninclude  the  issuance  of  the  SHS  curriculum,  availability  of  an  MSS  for  the  student\u2013classroom \nratio  in  DepEd  SHS,  prefeasibility  study  on  the  use  of  PPPs  for  educational  infrastructure, \nannouncement  of  the  SHS  voucher  policy  brief,  and  issuance  of  a policy  for  establishing  non-\nDepEd  SHSs.  Achieving  these  results  is  essential  for  successful  implementation  of  the  SHS \nprogram. The largest DLI allocations are for DLI 1and DLI 5. Competency in mathematics and \nscience  (DLI  1)  is  essential  for  high  school  graduates  in  the  21st  century,  while  the  voucher \nprogram (DLI 5) will diversify SHS supply and enable DepEd JHS graduates to enroll in DepEd \nor non-DepEd SHSs.

All  of  the  3.6  million  students  in  DepEd  SHSs  will  also  benefit  from  new  SHS \ninfrastructure, while 1.5 million students in non-DepEd SHSs will benefit from the SHS voucher \nprogram.  During  its  first  3  years  of  implementation  (SY2016/17\u2013SY2018/19),  about  2.6  million \nDepEd  and  non-DepEd  SHS  students  will  graduate  from  the  new  12-year  basic  education \nprogram  and  be  better  prepared for  employment  or further  education  and training.

Financing under the ADB loan will be disbursed over  5 \nyears, subject to the achievement and verification of the agreed annual DLIs (Appendix 3). The \ngovernment  will  ensure  that  the  total  program  expenditures  are  equal  to,  or  exceed,  the  total \namount of the loan withdrawn. Prior to submitting the first application to ADB for withdrawal from \nthe  loan  account,  the  borrower  will  nominate  an  account  at  Bangko  Sentral  ng  Pilipinas  into \nwhich all  loan account withdrawals  will  be  deposited.  Advance financing is  allowed  to address \nfinancing requirements. The government will refund any advance financing amount outstanding \nif  DLIs  are  not  achieved.11 Financing  of prior results  achieved  either  in  (i)  July  2014,  or  (ii)  not \nmore than 12 months before loan signing will be allowed to support the government in initiating \nactions required to achieve year 1 DLIs. Prior to the disbursement of loan proceeds, DepEd will \nsubmit  a  withdrawal  application,  along  with  evidence  verifying  achievement  of  the  DLIs  in \naccordance with the verification protocol. Partial disbursements are allowed for DLIs 1, 2, 3, 5, \nand 6. Disbursements are allowed for early or late achievement of DLIs.  \n\n                                                \n11 Ceilings are 25% for advance financing and 20% for financing for prior results. The combined ceiling is 30%. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fCapacity Development and Program Action Plan \n\n \nF. \n \nCapacity  development  activities  are  included  in  the  PAP. 12 They  will  support  results \n17. \nthrough  strengthening  of  DepEd\u2019s  overall  fiduciary,  social  and  environmental,  and  sector \nmanagement systems; as well as capacity development in such program areas as SHS student \ntracking, voucher operation, and development and administration of national assessment tools. \nThe SHSSP has no TA component, but ADB is processing a separate TA project for approval in \n2015. The TA will focus on implementation of the voucher program and monitoring achievement \nof program DLIs. ADB will work with Australian Aid to align the support provided by the A$150 \nmillion  Basic  Education  Sector  Transformation  Program  (2013\u20132019) \nthe  capacity \ndevelopment needs of the SHSSP. This project has been designed to be flexible, and its work \nprogram will be determined annually.13 \n \nG. \n \nThe SHSSP will be implemented from  December 2014 to December 2019. The DepEd \n18. \nwill  be  the  executing  agency  and  will  implement  this  program  through  its  head  office,  regional \noffices, and divisions. A program steering committee will oversee the SHSSP\u2019s implementation. \nIt  will  set  policy  guidelines  and  strategic  directions  for  the  program,  be  headed  by  the  DepEd \nsecretary, and include the DepEd\u2019s executive committee. A focal unit will be established in the \nDepEd\u2019s project management services unit to monitor and report on progress in attaining DLIs. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nto \n\nIII. \n\nSUMMARY OF ASSESSMENTS \n\nProgram Technical Assessments \n\n \nA. \n \n19. \nSeveral  assessments  conducted  by  the  government,  other  development  partners,  and \nADB  have concluded  that the  basic  education  system  in the  Philippines  needed to  (i)  improve \nquality and relevance; (ii)  increase private sector engagement; (iii) invest in qualified teachers, \nparticularly  in  mathematics  and  science;  (iv)  integrate  skills  training  into  basic  education;  (v) \nstrengthen \ninstitutional \nthe  basic  education  management  system;  and  (vi)  streamline \narrangements.  These  conclusions  underpin  the  results  areas,  key  actions,  and  sector \nperformance  indicators  of  the  SHSSP  and  the  government\u2019s  SHS  program.  DLI  6  aims  to \nstrengthen  DepEd  procurement  monitoring,  a  critical  issue  given  the  DepEd\u2019s  decentralized \nstructure.  The  SHSSP  design  and  implementation  arrangements  are  sound.  The  results \nframework is well-designed. The DLIs have been carefully selected, prioritized, and sequenced \nto ensure that the government achieves reform results in the most crucial areas. \n \n20. \nThe  education  system  in  the  Philippines  is  inequitable.  National  averages  mask  wide \ndisparities  in  education  outcomes.  Enrollment  rates  vary  widely  across  income  quintiles.  In \n2011,  the  secondary  school  net  enrollment  ratio  for  the  poorest  quintile  was  35.9  percentage \npoints below that of the richest quintile. The proportion of individuals from nonpoor households \nwho  complete  at  least  11  years  of  schooling  was  47%,  versus  11.2%  for  those  from  poor \nhouseholds.14 Girls  do  better  than  boys  across  many  basic  education  indicators,  including  net \nenrollment  and  completion.  They  also  make  up  a  larger  proportion  of  enrollments  and  have \n\n                                                \n12 Program Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n13 Government of Australia. 2014.

Gender segregation by occupation \nand class of worker is also significant, and women tend to work mainly in informal industries and \nsuffer  the  majority  of  gender-related  discrimination.16 DLIs  1  and  2  include  gender  outcome \ntargets. The PAP also includes gender actions (PAP 1.4, 1.6, 2.3, and 3.4\u20133.5). The SHSSP is \ncategorized as effective gender mainstreaming. \n \n21. \nThe SHSSP will increase the employability of secondary school graduates, help provide \nthem with more jobs in the formal sector, and reduce the time it takes for them to find a job. By \nsupporting  the  addition  of  2  years  of  SHS  to  the  basic  education  system,  it  will  save  many \nstudents from paying for tertiary education to gain some of the skills required to succeed in the \nlabor  market.  To  compute  the  incremental  benefits  and  costs  of  adding  SHS  to  the  basic \neducation program, a study was undertaken that calculated (i) a discount rate that compares the \nnet benefit stream of JHS graduates who continue to SHS and beyond with those who do not, \n(ii) the DepEd cost of providing the academic and technical-vocational and livelihood tracks, and \n(iii) household spending on education.17 Assuming SHS graduates enjoy a 10 percentage point \nincrease  in  productivity  and  retention,  the  social  rate  of  return  on  SHS  is  12.5%.  Varying  the \nwage  premium  affects  the  return  on  investment  more  than  other  variables  do,  implying  that \nincreasing educational attainment and skills leads to a higher return on investment. \n \nB. \n \n22.  Monitoring  and  evaluation  system.  A  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  systems \nassessment  was  undertaken,  and  it  noted  that  Australian  Aid  is  providing  support  to  upgrade \nand integrate DepEd\u2019s M&E systems.18 The assessment found that this upgraded M&E system \ncould generate most of the information needed to monitor  the SHSSP, but that some changes \nare required to (i) incorporate more information on teachers into the enhanced basic education \ninformation  system,  (ii)  link  the  learner  information  system  to  the  enhanced  basic  education \ninformation system to allow monitoring of the voucher program, (iii) track implementation of SHS \ninfrastructure  development,  and  (iv)  revise  national  assessments  to  fit  the  new  curriculum.  In \naddition,  the  SHSSP  will  require  (i)  an  assessment  and  impact  evaluation  of  the  voucher \nprogram,  (ii)  access  to  the  annual  agency  procurement  compliance and performance  indicator \nreport, and (iii) a means of assessing compliance with loan covenants and progress on program \nactions.  The  DepEd  focal  unit  will  collect  information,  oversee  assessments,  and  prepare \nprogram reports. Most of the data for DLI verification are routinely collected by the government. \n \nFiduciary  systems.  The  program  will  use  country  fiduciary  systems\u2014i.e.,  the \n23. \nPhilippines\u2019  public  financial  management  (PFM),  procurement,  and  anticorruption  systems. \nThese  systems  were  assessed  to  determine  the  degree  to  which  they  will  be  able  to manage \nfiduciary  risks  and  provide  assurance  that  RBL  program  funds  will  be  used  for  the  intended \npurposes,  with due consideration for  economy  and  efficiency.19 The  PFM  assessment focused \non  country-level  and  DepEd  systems.  It  found  that  improvements  are  needed\u2014particularly  in \n\n                                                \n15 Philippine  Commission \n\nhttp://pcw.gov.ph/statistics/201405/statistics-filipino-women-and-mens-education.  \n\n16 World Bank. 2011.

The \nPAP contains actions to strengthen financial management systems. \n \n24. \nA procurement assessment was carried out for the SHSSP covering the procurement (i) \nprofile;  (ii)  regulations,  rules,  and  procedures;  (iii)  organizational  arrangements  and  capacity; \nand (iv) system performance. The SHSSP will rely on country systems and exclude high-value \ncontracts,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  RBL  policy. 21  The  assessment  concluded  that  the \nPhilippines  has  a functional  public  procurement  system  that  follows  a  comprehensive  national \nprocurement act that is largely in line with good procurement practice. Due diligence identified \nthe  following  weaknesses:  (i)  a  lack  of  suitably  trained  procurement  staff  and  associated \nfacilities,  (ii)  weak  procurement  planning  and  compliance  monitoring,  and  (iii)  inadequate \nmonitoring  and \nto  manage \nprocurement risks have been identified and included in the PAP. The Guidelines to Prevent or \nMitigate  Fraud,  Corruption,  and  Other  Prohibited  Activities  in  Results-Based  Lending  for \nPrograms  were  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  (footnote  21).  DLI  6  and  the \nPAP contain actions to strengthen procurement monitoring.  \n \nSafeguard  systems.  A  program  safeguard  systems  assessment  of  the  DepEd  was \n25. \nundertaken  and  confirmed  a  safeguard  categorization  for  the  SHSSP  of  B  for  environment, \ninvoluntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples. 22  Activities  in  results  area  2  may  have \nenvironmental, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples impacts, while those in results \narea  1  may  have  indigenous  peoples  impacts.  A  common  issue  across  all  three  safeguard \nareas  is  the  fact  that,  although  DepEd  does  not  plan  to  build  SHSs  on  land  it  does  not  own, \nschool  locations  are  yet  to  be  determined.  Good  practices  include  (i)  DepEd\u2019s  inclusion  of \nenvironmental issues in its education facilities manual; (ii) DepEd\u2019s preparation of resettlement \nplans for development partner-funded projects, and consultation with affected communities; and \n(iii)  strong  laws  on  the  rights  of  indigenous  peoples  that  exceed  the  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  in  some  respects.  Gaps  identified  by  the  assessment \ninclude  (i) the medium  and  timing of  disclosure of  environmental  impact  reports; (ii) the timing \nand  levels  of  compensation  to  affected  persons  from  involuntary  resettlement,  and  the \nprocedure  for  negotiated  settlements;  and  (iii)  the  lack  of  a  requirement  to  prepare  an \nindigenous peoples plan. Human resource and institutional capacity gaps were also identified in \nall three safeguard areas. Actions to address safeguard system gaps are included in the PAP. \n \nC. \n \n26.

Disbursements  are  allowed  for  early  or  late  achievement  of \nDLIs. Verification mechanisms and protocols have been established using public and independent sources \nand are clarified in these protocols and verification measures.   \n \nA. \n \n2. \n\nThe  disbursement  amount  allocated  to  each  disbursement-linked  indicator  depends  on  its \nimportance. While the cost of achieving the DLI may be a factor for consideration, there is no one-\nto-one  relationship  between  the  allocation  of  disbursement  and  the  costs  required  to  achieve  the \nresults. Two or more development agencies can disburse against the same DLIs. \n\nDisbursement Principles \n\nAdvance  financing.  ADB  can  provide  up  to  25%  of  its  financing  (i.e.,  $75  million)  as  advance \ndisbursement.  Advances  can  be  considered \nthe \nimplementation period. The amount of advances will be recovered from subsequent disbursements \nwhen  DLIs  are  achieved.  Additional  advances  can  be  made  once  an  earlier  advance  has  been \nrecovered or partially recovered. The recovered advance is then available, as needed, for additional \nadvances (\u201crevolving advances\u201d), but  the outstanding advance should not  at  any  time  exceed the \nceiling  of  25%  of  ADB  financing.  The  government  will  refund  any  advances  (or  portions  of \nadvances) if the DLIs have not been met or fully met by program completion no later than 6 months \nafter program completion. \n\ninitial  and  subsequent  DLIs  during \n\nfor \n\nFinancing  prior  results.  Some  results  may  need  to  be  achieved  before  an  RBL  operation  is \napproved.  In  such  cases,  ADB  will  be  able  to  finance  and  disburse  based  on  the  DLIs  achieved \nbefore the effectiveness of the results-based lending program. The total amount for such financing \nshould not exceed 20% of the ADB financing (i.e., $60 million). Financing of prior results achieved \neither on (i) July 2014 or (ii) not more than 12 months before loan signing will be allowed in order to \nsupport  government  to  initiate  actions  required  to  achieve  Year  1  DLIs.    Prior  results  have  been \nagreed with the government, and the DLIs against which the amount of prior results financing will \nbe  made  have  been  identified  during  program  preparation.  The  program  team  is  of  the  view  that \nsuch results are within the scope of the program supported by RBL and are subject to the agreed \nverification protocols.  \n\nCeilings  for  advance  financing  and  financing  for  prior  results.  Ceilings  are  (i)  advance \nfinancing  (25%),  and  (ii)  financing  for  prior  results  (20%).  The  combined  ceiling  for  both  is  30%. \nAdditional detail is available in the program implementation document.  \n\nPartial  disbursements  are  allowed.    Partial  disbursements  are  allowed  for  DLI  1,  2,  3,  5  and  6 \nand the formulas for partial disbursement for those DLIs are detailed in these protocols.  \n\nDisbursement Procedures \n(a)  DepEd will collect all reports and information necessary to verify accomplishment of the DLI \nand  prepare  a  draft  DLI  achievement  report.  Achievement  reports  refer  to  the  month  and \nyear of the DLI achievement indicated in the DLI table. \n\n(b)  DepEd Secretary or designee will assess the achievement of the DLIs and authorize the DLI \nachievement  report  to  be  shared  with  the  Department  of  Finance,  Department  of  Budget \nand Management and ADB. \nThe  DLI  achievement  report  will  be  discussed  and  confirmed  with  ADB.  In  case  ADB \nidentifies issues with the DLI achievement, it will relay its concerns to DepEd within 3 months \nof its receipt of the achievement report. \n\n(c) \n\n(d)  Once  ADB  has  confirmed  the  achievement  of  a  DLI,  DepEd  through  DOF  submits  the \n\nWithdrawal Application to ADB accompanied by the evidence of DLI achievement. \n(e)  The withdrawal application can be submitted in the same year the DLI is achieved or any \n\nsubsequent year depending upon the government\u2019s financial needs. \n\n  \n3. \n\n  \n4. \n\n  \n5. \n\n \n6. \n\n \nB. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nDLI \n
