THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of the Philippines for the Senior High School Support Program (SHSSP).1 \n \n2.  The SHSSP will support the development during 2014\u20132015 of senior high school (SHS) \nin the Philippines and the implementation of the SHS program during 2016\u20132019. The addition \nof 2 years of high school to the basic education system is part of an overall kindergarten-to-\ngrade-12 reform by the Department of Education (DepEd).2 Among other things, the introduction \nof  SHS  aims  to  (i)  provide  basic  education  graduates  with  the  skills  necessary  for \nentrepreneurship or formal sector employment, (ii) better prepare graduates who undertake \nfurther education or training, and (iii) spread the basic education curriculum content over 12 \nyears rather than the previous 10 years. Introducing grades 11 and 12 will involve developing \nthe SHS program (curriculum, instructional materials, and assessment tools); engaging and \ntraining SHS teachers; delivering schools and other educational infrastructure; and establishing \nan SHS voucher program that will help finance the tuition of students who attend private SHSs.3 \nThe infrastructure for some DepEd SHSs\u2014i.e., the country\u2019s public SHSs\u2014may be delivered \nthrough a public\u2013private partnership (PPP) modality. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Strategic Context \n \n3.  The  Philippines  has  experienced  high  economic  growth  since  2012,  and  increased \ngovernment revenues have significantly improved the government\u2019s fiscal position and debt \nprofile. Gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an average of 7% in 2012 and 2013, making the \nPhilippines one of the fastest-growing economies in Southeast Asia. Recent economic growth \nhas not had much impact on the incidence of poverty, which is high and has not changed since \n2006.4 Unemployment  among  youth  aged  18\u201324  is  a  persistent  problem,  and  the  youth \nunemployment rate in 2013 was more than twice the workforce average.5 The Philippines\u2019 \neducation system is not well-suited to addressing these labor market issues, nor does it allow \nthe country to take advantage of the demographic dividend its young labor force can provide.  \n \n4.  Philippine education faces significant challenges, particularly at the secondary level. The \nsecondary net enrollment rate of 64.6% in school year (SY) 2012/13 was low, particularly for \nboys (59.5%, compared with 70.0% for girls). The overall rate also masked significant disparities \nin access between regions, urban and rural populations, and income classes. On average, the \ncountry\u2019s 18\u201324-year olds had only 8 years of schooling\u20147.9 years for males and 8.5 years for \nfemales.6 The quality of education provided is diminished by large class sizes; a crowded basic \neducation  curriculum;  insufficient  teaching  resources;  and  a  lack  of  specialist  teachers, \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  In the Philippines, basic education includes kindergarten, elementary school, and junior high school. Beginning in \nSY2016/17, it will also include senior high school. \n3  Includes private high schools and public and private postsecondary institutions. \n4  Philippine Statistics Authority. http://www.nscb.gov.ph/poverty/ (accessed 6 September 2014). \n5  ADB computations based on data for youth 18\u201324 from Government of the Philippines.

Annual  Poverty  Indicators  Survey,  2011. \nhttp://www.census.gov.ph/content/results-2011-annual-poverty-indicators-survey-apis  (accessed  9  September \n2014). ", "2 \nparticularly in mathematics and science. About 27.3% of DepEd junior high schools (JHSs) \nfaced shortages of qualified mathematics teachers (79% faced shortages of qualified instructors \nin biology, chemistry, and physics). Learning outcomes are poor, according to 2013 national \nassessment  results,  with  an  overall  mean  percentage  score  of  51.4%.  These  scores  are \nparticularly weak in mathematics (46.8%) and science (41.4%).7 \n \n5.  A major factor contributing to sector challenges has been chronic underfunding during a \ntime when a growing school-age population has increased the demand for basic education. A \ncompression of national government expenditures during 1999\u20132004 led to the contraction of \ngovernment  spending  in  most  sectors,  including  basic  education.  This  resulted  in  large \nshortages  in  such  crucial  education  sector  resources  as  teachers,  classrooms,  textbooks, \nschool furniture, and water and sanitation facilities. Since 2006, DepEd spending has increased \nsignificantly.  During  2006\u20132013,  DepEd  spending  rose  by  an  average  of  12%  annually  in \nnominal terms, compared with a rate of just 4% during 1998\u20132005. Thus, after declining from a \npeak of 2.9% of GDP in 1997\u20131998 to a low of 1.9% of GDP in 2005, national government \nspending on basic education rose to 2.4% of GDP in 2013\u2014the same as in 2003. \n \n6.  Education is the government\u2019s central strategy for achieving inclusive economic growth \nby  investing  in  human  capital  development  to  reduce  poverty  and  build  national \ncompetitiveness. The government\u2019s Philippine Development Plan, 2011\u20132016 sets out broad \nstrategies to achieve inclusive growth, including the provision of quality basic education. With \nthe passage of the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013, the government expanded the basic \neducation system from 10 years to 1 year of kindergarten, 6 years of elementary school, 4 years \nof JHS, and 2 years of SHS. The universalization of kindergarten and revisions to the grades 1\u2013\n6  curriculum  are  expected  to  improve  the  internal  efficiency,  quality,  and  inclusiveness  of \nelementary education. The addition of SHS, alongside reforms to the grades 7\u201310 curriculum, is \nintended  to  bring  the  Philippines\u2019  basic  education  system  more  into  line  with  international \nstandards and make SHS graduates more competitive domestically and globally. Beginning in \nSY2016/17, SHS (grades 11 and 12) will offer a core curriculum and specializations in four \ntracks: (i) academic, (ii) technical-vocational and livelihood, (iii) sports, and (iv) arts and design. \n \nB.  Program Rationale \n7.  The  SHSSP  will  build  on  the  government\u2019s  recent  efforts  and  the  pioneering \nengagement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in secondary education in the Philippines. \nThe program is aligned with the Philippine Development Plan, 2011\u20132016 and the government\u2019s \nbasic education sector reform agenda. It is also in line with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy \nfor the Philippines for 2011\u20132016, which includes education as a focus area, and with its \nPhilippines country operations business plan, 2014\u20132016.8 The SHSSP reflects lessons learned \nfrom ADB\u2019s previous operations in the Philippines. It incorporates findings of a 2008 country \nassistance program evaluation by ADB\u2019s Independent Evaluation Department that cited a need \nto expand the use of sector-wide and programmatic approaches in the country.9 The SHSSP \ncomplements support ADB is providing to improve the functioning of the labor market in the \nPhilippines, including assistance to review selected elements of the labor code and regulations \nand to pilot the JobStart Philippines program focusing on youth employment.10 \n                                                \n7  Government of Australia.  2012.

The use of ADB\u2019s results-based lending (RBL) for programs modality is proposed for the \nSHSSP due to strong government ownership of the SHS program and  its commitment to \nresults-based planning, budgeting, and management. RBL provides a flexible mechanism for \nsupporting the wide range of interventions required to establish and implement SHS as  a \nsustainable system-wide reform. The SHSSP\u2019s accountability framework provides incentives for \nthe  government  to  achieve  sector  outcomes  and  outputs  that  strengthen  its  systems  and \ninstitutional  capacity.  Preparing  the  RBL  has  enhanced  ADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  with  the \ngovernment  and  education  sector  stakeholders.  Due  diligence  assessments  provide  a \nreasonable  assurance  of  effective  achievement  of  results  through  RBL  from  measures  to \nstrengthen government program systems. \n \n9.  In designing the SHSSP, ADB has applied lessons it has learned from implementing \nRBL  in  other  programs.  These  include  the  need  to  have  a  small  number  of  essential \ndisbursement-linked indicators (DLIs), a strong focal unit dedicated to the RBL implementation, \nthe provision of technical assistance (TA) to strengthen government systems, and disbursement \nprotocols that are not ambiguous. ADB will continue to add value by helping DepEd access \nknowledge,  expertise,  and  international  experience  on  the  further  development  and \nimplementation of the SHS voucher program; promoting ongoing dialogue among DepEd, the \ntechnical and vocational education and training (TVET) sector, and the higher education sector; \nand further evaluate the use of PPPs for the delivery of education infrastructure. These steps \nwill  stimulate  private  sector  participation  in  SHS,  alongside  the  planned  participation  of \nnongovernment organization networks in SHS program monitoring (e.g., of school construction) \nand  in  its  implementation  (e.g.,  by  identifying  opportunities  for  on-the-job  learning  in  the \ncommunity). At least initially, the Fund for Assistance to Private Education, a nongovernment \norganization, will operate the voucher program on behalf of DepEd. \n \nC.  Program Scope \n \n10.  The SHSSP will support the nationwide establishment and implementation of SHS during \n2014\u20132019 within the context of the government\u2019s wider SHS program. The SHSSP supports a \nsubset of the SHS program, with a focus on mathematics, science, and technical-vocational and \nlivelihood education; school infrastructure; the SHS voucher program; and systems strengthening. \nThe government SHS program scope and the SHSSP scope are in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Program Scope \nItem  Broader Government Program  Results-Based Lending Program  \nOutcome  Improved  basic  education  system;  Effective  SHS  system  established  and \ngraduates  prepared  for  employment  or  implemented \nfurther education and training \nKey outputs   SHS  program,  schools  and  other  SHS program in mathematics, science and \neducational  facilities,  basic  education  technical-vocational  and  livelihood;  MSS \nsector  leadership,  teacher  engagement  for school facilities in DepEd SHSs; PPPs \nand  training,  basic  education  sector  for  school  infrastructure;  SHS  voucher \nmanagement and administration   program; fiduciary and safeguards systems \nActivity types  (i)  Curriculum,  learning  materials,  and  (i) Science,  mathematics  and  TVL \nassessment tools developed; (ii) teachers  curriculum  developed;  (ii)  educational \nengaged  and  trained;  (iii)  educational  facilities  delivered;  (iii)  assessment  of \nfacilities  delivered;  (iv)  PPPs  used  to  PPP  modality  for  school  facilities; \nfinance  student  enrollments;  and  (iv)  voucher  program  established;  and \n(v) strengthened sector management  (v) procurement system strengthened \n ", "4 \nProgram  $4,410 million  $300 million \nexpenditure \nGeographic \nNationwide  Nationwide \ncoverage \nImplementation \nPeriod  2014\u20132019  2014\u20132019 \nMSS = minimum service standard, PPP = public\u2013private partnership, SHS = senior high school.  \nSource:  Asian Development Bank. \n  \nD.  Program Results \n \n11.  The impact of the SHSSP will be enhanced employment of SHS graduates and those with \nsome SHS. The outcome will be an effective SHS system established and implemented. Some of \nthe program outcome indicators have been developed into DLIs. DLIs and the SHSSP program \naction plan (PAP) actions are grouped into four results areas: \n \n(i)  Results area 1: Quality of Department of Education senior high school \nprogram  improved.  The  SHSSP  will  support  the  development  and \nimplementation of the core SHS curriculum and electives in four tracks, including \nthe  formulation  of  content,  learning  outcomes,  instructional  materials,  and \nnational assessment tools. It will also support the engagement and training of \n84,000 teachers to allow the DepEd to achieve its minimum service standard \n(MSS) for the number of qualified mathematics and science teachers per student \nin DepEd SHSs (DLI 1, PAP 1.1\u20131.2, 1.4, 4.2, and 4.5). It will also support the \nintegration of TVET at the SHS level (DLI 2, PAP 1.1, 1.3\u20131.6, 3.2, 4.2, and 4.5). \n(ii)  Results  area  2:  Minimum  service  standard  for  school  facilities  in \nDepartment of Education  senior high schools achieved. The SHSSP will \nsupport  the  delivery  of  schools  and  classrooms  required  to  accommodate \nstudents at the SHS level. About 40,000 classrooms are expected to be needed \nover the SHSSP period. DepEd is preparing local school division-level plans to \nidentify potential SHS providers (both DepEd and non-DepEd) and DepEd school \nlocations. Delivery of these schools and classrooms will help ensure that the \nDepEd achieves its MSS for the student\u2013classroom ratio, which is set at 40 \nstudents per classroom at the SHS level (DLI 3, PAP 2.1\u20132.4). The result area \nalso covers an assessment of the feasibility of delivering a portion of schools \nusing a PPP modality (DLI 4, PAP 2.1\u20132.2, and 2.4). \n(iii)  Results  area  3:  Senior  high  school  voucher  program  developed  and \nimplemented. The government currently provides tuition fee subsidies to some \nJHS  students  attending  non-DepEd  schools.  The  SHSSP  will  support  the \nextension of government assistance, through a voucher program, to graduates of \nDepEd JHSs and some graduates of non-DepEd JHSs to help them attend non-\nDepEd SHSs (DLI 5, PAP 3.1\u20133.6). The voucher amount will be set at about the \ncost per student of public provision and will partly or fully offset tuition costs for \nthese students. The voucher program will provide assistance to about 800,000 \nSHS students each year. It will be managed, at least initially, by the not-for-profit \norganization that manages DepEd financial support programs at the JHS level. \n(iv)  Results area 4: Basic education management, fiduciary, and safeguards \nsystems strengthened. In this area, the SHSSP will support the strengthening \nof financial management, procurement, and other systems at the DepEd school, \nregion,  division,  and  central  levels  to  ensure  that  they  meet  government \nperformance targets. In particular, it will strengthen oversight and implementation \n ", "5 \nof  the  SHS  voucher  program  and  supplement  ongoing  initiatives  to  improve \nDepEd  monitoring  and  evaluation  functions  currently  being  supported  by \nAustralian Aid (DLI 6, PAP 4.2\u20134.16). \n \n12.  The SHSSP will cover both the 2014\u20132015 preparation phase of the government\u2019s SHS \nprogram and the implementation phase during 2016\u20132019. The DLI matrix for the preparation \nphase  includes  outputs  and  high-level  outputs  linked  to  outcomes  to  be  achieved  in  the \nimplementation phase. The RBL will finance several significant reforms as prior results. These \ninclude the issuance of the SHS curriculum, availability of an MSS for the student\u2013classroom \nratio in DepEd SHS, prefeasibility study on the use of PPPs for educational infrastructure, \nannouncement of the SHS voucher policy brief, and issuance of a policy for establishing non-\nDepEd SHSs. Achieving these results is essential for successful implementation of the SHS \nprogram. The largest DLI allocations are for DLI 1and DLI 5. Competency in mathematics and \nscience (DLI 1) is essential for high school graduates in the 21st century, while the voucher \nprogram (DLI 5) will diversify SHS supply and enable DepEd JHS graduates to enroll in DepEd \nor non-DepEd SHSs. Disbursement allocation is summarized in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Disbursement-Linked Indicators \nDisbursement  Share of Total ADB \nAllocated  Financing \nIndicator  ($ million)  (%) \nOutcome     \nDLI 1  Learning outcomes in DepEd SHS  80.00  26.67 \nmathematics and science subjects \nimproved \nDLI 2  Learning outcomes in DepEd SHS TVL  40.00  13.33 \nsubjects improved \nOutputs     \nDLI 3  MSS for student\u2013classroom ratio in  46.20  15.42 \nDepEd SHSs achieved     \nDLI 4  Use of PPP modality considered for a  10.00  3.33 \nportion of SHS infrastructure delivery     \nDLI 5  DepEd targets for SHS enrollments in  113.80  37.92 \nnon-DepEd schools achieved     \nDLI 6  Performance targets in procurement     \nmonitoring achieved  10.00  3.33 \n  Total  300.00  100.00 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, DepEd = Department of Education, DLI = disbursement-linked indicator, MSS = \nminimum service standard, PPP = public\u2013private partnership, SHS = senior high school, TVL = technical-vocational \nand livelihood. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n13.  The primary beneficiaries of the program will be the approximately 5.9 million expected \nnew entrants to DepEd SHSs (3.6 million students) and non-DepEd SHSs (i.e., the country\u2019s \nprivate SHSs) [2.3 million students] during June 2016\u2013April 2019 who will benefit from the new \nSHS program. All of the 3.6 million students in DepEd SHSs will also benefit from new SHS \ninfrastructure, while 1.5 million students in non-DepEd SHSs will benefit from the SHS voucher \nprogram. During its first 3 years of implementation (SY2016/17\u2013SY2018/19), about 2.6 million \nDepEd and non-DepEd SHS students will graduate from the new 12-year basic education \nprogram and be better prepared for employment or further education and training. Employers, \ntertiary education institutions, and TVET institutes will benefit from high school graduates who \nare better qualified for the world of work or postsecondary education and training. \n \n ", "6 \nE.

Disbursement arrangements. Financing under the ADB loan will be disbursed over 5 \nyears, subject to the achievement and verification of the agreed annual DLIs (Appendix 3). The \ngovernment will ensure that the total program expenditures are equal to, or exceed, the total \namount of the loan withdrawn. Prior to submitting the first application to ADB for withdrawal from \nthe loan account, the borrower will nominate an account at Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas into \nwhich all loan account withdrawals will be deposited. Advance financing is allowed to address \nfinancing requirements. The government will refund any advance financing amount outstanding \nif DLIs are not achieved.11 Financing of prior results achieved either in (i) July 2014, or (ii) not \nmore than 12 months before loan signing will be allowed to support the government in initiating \nactions required to achieve year 1 DLIs. Prior to the disbursement of loan proceeds, DepEd will \nsubmit  a  withdrawal  application,  along  with  evidence  verifying  achievement  of the  DLIs  in \naccordance with the verification protocol. Partial disbursements are allowed for DLIs 1, 2, 3, 5, \nand 6. Disbursements are allowed for early or late achievement of DLIs.  \n                                                \n11 Ceilings are 25% for advance financing and 20% for financing for prior results.

Capacity development activities are included in the PAP.12 They will support results \nthrough  strengthening  of  DepEd\u2019s  overall  fiduciary,  social  and  environmental,  and  sector \nmanagement systems; as well as capacity development in such program areas as SHS student \ntracking, voucher operation, and development and administration of national assessment tools. \nThe SHSSP has no TA component, but ADB is processing a separate TA project for approval in \n2015. The TA will focus on implementation of the voucher program and monitoring achievement \nof program DLIs. ADB will work with Australian Aid to align the support provided by the A$150 \nmillion  Basic  Education  Sector  Transformation  Program  (2013\u20132019)  to  the  capacity \ndevelopment needs of the SHSSP. This project has been designed to be flexible, and its work \nprogram will be determined annually.13 \n \nG.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  The SHSSP will be implemented from December 2014 to December 2019. The DepEd \nwill be the executing agency and will implement this program through its head office, regional \noffices, and divisions. A program steering committee will oversee the SHSSP\u2019s implementation. \nIt will set policy guidelines and strategic directions for the program, be headed by the DepEd \nsecretary, and include the DepEd\u2019s executive committee. A focal unit will be established in the \nDepEd\u2019s project management services unit to monitor and report on progress in attaining DLIs. \n \nIII.  SUMMARY OF ASSESSMENTS \n \nA.  Program Technical Assessments \n \n19.  Several assessments conducted by the government, other development partners, and \nADB have concluded that the basic education system in the Philippines needed to (i) improve \nquality and relevance; (ii) increase private sector engagement; (iii) invest in qualified teachers, \nparticularly in mathematics and science; (iv) integrate skills training into basic education; (v) \nstrengthen  the  basic  education  management  system;  and  (vi)  streamline  institutional \narrangements.  These  conclusions  underpin  the  results  areas,  key  actions,  and  sector \nperformance indicators of the SHSSP and the government\u2019s SHS program. DLI 6 aims to \nstrengthen DepEd procurement monitoring, a critical issue given the DepEd\u2019s decentralized \nstructure.  The  SHSSP  design  and  implementation  arrangements  are  sound.  The  results \nframework is well-designed. The DLIs have been carefully selected, prioritized, and sequenced \nto ensure that the government achieves reform results in the most crucial areas. \n \n20.  The education system in the Philippines is inequitable. National averages mask wide \ndisparities in education outcomes. Enrollment rates vary widely across income quintiles. In \n2011, the secondary school net enrollment ratio for the poorest quintile was 35.9 percentage \npoints below that of the richest quintile. The proportion of individuals from nonpoor households \nwho complete at least 11 years of schooling was 47%, versus 11.2% for those from poor \nhouseholds.14 Girls do better than boys across many basic education indicators, including net \nenrollment and completion. They also make up a larger proportion of enrollments and have \n                                                \n12 Program Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n13 Government of Australia. 2014.

Manila. \n ", "8 \nhigher  retention  rates  in  higher  education.15 However,  women  have  a  lower  labor  force \nparticipation rate and higher unemployment rate than men. Gender segregation by occupation \nand class of worker is also significant, and women tend to work mainly in informal industries and \nsuffer the majority of gender-related discrimination.16 DLIs 1 and 2 include gender outcome \ntargets. The PAP also includes gender actions (PAP 1.4, 1.6, 2.3, and 3.4\u20133.5). The SHSSP is \ncategorized as effective gender mainstreaming. \n \n21.  The SHSSP will increase the employability of secondary school graduates, help provide \nthem with more jobs in the formal sector, and reduce the time it takes for them to find a job. By \nsupporting the addition of 2 years of SHS to the basic education system, it will save many \nstudents from paying for tertiary education to gain some of the skills required to succeed in the \nlabor market. To compute the incremental benefits and costs of adding SHS to the basic \neducation program, a study was undertaken that calculated (i) a discount rate that compares the \nnet benefit stream of JHS graduates who continue to SHS and beyond with those who do not, \n(ii) the DepEd cost of providing the academic and technical-vocational and livelihood tracks, and \n(iii) household spending on education.17 Assuming SHS graduates enjoy a 10 percentage point \nincrease in productivity and retention, the social rate of return on SHS is 12.5%. Varying the \nwage premium affects the return on investment more than other variables do, implying that \nincreasing educational attainment and skills leads to a higher return on investment. \n \nB.  Program Systems Assessments \n \n22.  Monitoring  and  evaluation  system.  A  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  systems \nassessment was undertaken, and it noted that Australian Aid is providing support to upgrade \nand integrate DepEd\u2019s M&E systems.18 The assessment found that this upgraded M&E system \ncould generate most of the information needed to monitor the SHSSP, but that some changes \nare required to (i) incorporate more information on teachers into the enhanced basic education \ninformation system, (ii) link the learner information system to the enhanced basic education \ninformation system to allow monitoring of the voucher program, (iii) track implementation of SHS \ninfrastructure development, and (iv) revise national assessments to fit the new curriculum. In \naddition,  the  SHSSP  will  require (i)  an  assessment  and  impact  evaluation  of  the  voucher \nprogram, (ii) access to the annual agency procurement compliance and performance indicator \nreport, and (iii) a means of assessing compliance with loan covenants and progress on program \nactions.  The  DepEd  focal  unit  will  collect  information,  oversee  assessments,  and  prepare \nprogram reports. Most of the data for DLI verification are routinely collected by the government. \n \n23.  Fiduciary  systems.  The  program  will  use  country  fiduciary  systems\u2014i.e.,  the \nPhilippines\u2019  public  financial  management  (PFM),  procurement,  and  anticorruption  systems. \nThese systems were assessed to determine the degree to which they will be able to manage \nfiduciary risks and provide assurance that RBL program funds will be used for the intended \npurposes, with due consideration for economy and efficiency.19 The PFM assessment focused \non country-level and DepEd systems. It found that improvements are needed\u2014particularly in \n                                                \n15 Philippine  Commission  on  Women.

The \nPAP contains actions to strengthen financial management systems. \n \n24.  A procurement assessment was carried out for the SHSSP covering the procurement (i) \nprofile; (ii) regulations, rules, and procedures; (iii) organizational arrangements and capacity; \nand (iv) system performance. The SHSSP will rely on country systems and exclude high-value \ncontracts,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  RBL  policy.21 The  assessment  concluded  that  the \nPhilippines has a functional public procurement system that follows a comprehensive national \nprocurement act that is largely in line with good procurement practice. Due diligence identified \nthe  following  weaknesses:  (i)  a  lack  of  suitably  trained  procurement  staff  and  associated \nfacilities,  (ii)  weak  procurement  planning  and  compliance  monitoring,  and  (iii)  inadequate \nmonitoring  and  tracking  of  contractual  performance.  Mitigating  measures  to  manage \nprocurement risks have been identified and included in the PAP. The Guidelines to Prevent or \nMitigate  Fraud,  Corruption,  and  Other  Prohibited  Activities  in  Results-Based  Lending  for \nPrograms were explained to and discussed with the government (footnote 21). DLI 6 and the \nPAP contain actions to strengthen procurement monitoring.  \n \n25.  Safeguard  systems. A program safeguard systems assessment of the DepEd was \nundertaken and confirmed a safeguard categorization for the SHSSP of B for environment, \ninvoluntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples.22 Activities  in  results  area  2  may  have \nenvironmental, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples impacts, while those in results \narea 1 may have indigenous peoples impacts. A common issue across all three safeguard \nareas is the fact that, although DepEd does not plan to build SHSs on land it does not own, \nschool locations are yet to be determined. Good practices include (i) DepEd\u2019s inclusion of \nenvironmental issues in its education facilities manual; (ii) DepEd\u2019s preparation of resettlement \nplans for development partner-funded projects, and consultation with affected communities; and \n(iii) strong laws on the rights of indigenous peoples that exceed the requirements of ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  in  some  respects.  Gaps  identified  by  the  assessment \ninclude (i) the medium and timing of disclosure of environmental impact reports; (ii) the timing \nand  levels  of  compensation  to  affected  persons  from  involuntary  resettlement,  and  the \nprocedure  for  negotiated  settlements;  and  (iii)  the  lack  of  a  requirement  to  prepare  an \nindigenous peoples plan. Human resource and institutional capacity gaps were also identified in \nall three safeguard areas. Actions to address safeguard system gaps are included in the PAP. \n \nC.  Integrated Risk Assessment and Mitigating Measures \n \n26.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5.

DepEd may submit a withdrawal application periodically, along with evidence verifying achievement \nof the disbursement-linked indicators (DLIs). Disbursements are allowed for early or late achievement of \nDLIs. Verification mechanisms and protocols have been established using public and independent sources \nand are clarified in these protocols and verification measures.   \n \nA.  Disbursement Principles \n \n2.  The disbursement amount allocated to each disbursement-linked indicator depends on its \nimportance. While the cost of achieving the DLI may be a factor for consideration, there is no one-\nto-one relationship between the allocation of disbursement and the costs required to achieve the \nresults. Two or more development agencies can disburse against the same DLIs. \n  \n3.  Advance financing. ADB can provide up to 25% of its financing (i.e., $75 million) as advance \ndisbursement.  Advances  can  be  considered  for  initial  and  subsequent  DLIs  during  the \nimplementation period. The amount of advances will be recovered from subsequent disbursements \nwhen DLIs are achieved. Additional advances can be made once an earlier advance has been \nrecovered or partially recovered. The recovered advance is then available, as needed, for additional \nadvances (\u201crevolving advances\u201d), but the outstanding advance should not at any time exceed the \nceiling  of  25%  of  ADB  financing.  The  government  will  refund  any  advances  (or  portions  of \nadvances) if the DLIs have not been met or fully met by program completion no later than 6 months \nafter program completion. \n  \n4.  Financing prior results. Some results may need to be achieved before an RBL operation is \napproved. In such cases, ADB will be able to finance and disburse based on the DLIs achieved \nbefore the effectiveness of the results-based lending program. The total amount for such financing \nshould not exceed 20% of the ADB financing (i.e., $60 million). Financing of prior results achieved \neither on (i) July 2014 or (ii) not more than 12 months before loan signing will be allowed in order to \nsupport government to initiate actions required to achieve Year 1 DLIs.  Prior results have been \nagreed with the government, and the DLIs against which the amount of prior results financing will \nbe made have been identified during program preparation. The program team is of the view that \nsuch results are within the scope of the program supported by RBL and are subject to the agreed \nverification protocols.  \n  \n5.  Ceilings  for  advance  financing  and  financing  for  prior  results.  Ceilings  are  (i)  advance \nfinancing (25%), and (ii) financing for prior results (20%). The combined ceiling for both is 30%. \nAdditional detail is available in the program implementation document.  \n \n6.  Partial disbursements are allowed.  Partial disbursements are allowed for DLI 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 \nand the formulas for partial disbursement for those DLIs are detailed in these protocols.  \n \nB.  Disbursement Procedures \n(a)  DepEd will collect all reports and information necessary to verify accomplishment of the DLI \nand prepare a draft DLI achievement report. Achievement reports refer to the month and \nyear of the DLI achievement indicated in the DLI table. \n(b)  DepEd Secretary or designee will assess the achievement of the DLIs and authorize the DLI \nachievement report to be shared with the Department of Finance, Department of Budget \nand Management and ADB. \n(c)  The  DLI  achievement  report  will  be  discussed  and  confirmed  with  ADB.  In  case  ADB \nidentifies issues with the DLI achievement, it will relay its concerns to DepEd within 3 months \nof its receipt of the achievement report. \n(d)  Once ADB has confirmed the achievement of a DLI, DepEd through DOF submits the \nWithdrawal Application to ADB accompanied by the evidence of DLI achievement. \n(e)  The withdrawal application can be submitted in the same year the DLI is achieved or any \nsubsequent year depending upon the government\u2019s financial needs. \n ", "    Appendix 3  19 \n \nTable A3.2: Verification Protocols \n \nInformation Source \nDLI
