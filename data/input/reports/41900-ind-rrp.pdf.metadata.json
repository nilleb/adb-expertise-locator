The loan will be made available in two direct tranches: (i) \none of up to Rs1.26 billion; and (ii) another of up to Rs2.26 billion, which will be fully covered by \na  guarantee  (or  other  financial  instrument  acceptable  to  ADB)  from  financial  institutions \nacceptable  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  Part  of  the  guaranteed  portion  may  be \nsyndicated to financial institutions and/or selected financial institutions may enter into a risk or \nfunded participation with ADB. \n \n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n \n2. \nIndia is endowed with abundant renewable energy sources\u2014solar, wind, biomass, and \nsmall  hydroelectric\u2014and  the  Government  is  working  proactively  to  develop  them.  Under  the \n\u201cPower for All by 2012\u201d initiative, the Government has envisaged universal electricity supply by \n2012.  The  Ministry  of  New  and  Renewable  Energy  (MNRE),  formerly  the  Ministry  of  Non-\nConventional Energy Sources (MNES), has proposed exploiting the full potential of renewable \nenergy  sources  to  increase  generation  capacity  in  the  country.  The  National  Electricity  Policy, \nissued  by  the  Ministry  of  Power  on  12  February  2005,  also  emphasizes  the  development  of \nrenewable energy sources. \n \n3. \nSince its inception, the renewable energy program in India has been driven by policies \nand promotional measures initially framed by MNRE and subsequently by the respective state \ngovernments.  The  promotional  measures  available  to  renewable  energy  projects  comprise  a \nwide range of fiscal and financial incentives, including soft loans, concessional customs duties, \nexemption from excise duty, tax holidays, and accelerated depreciation benefits. \n \n4. \nTo accelerate the promotion of renewable energy development, Maharashtra Electricity \nRegulation  Commission  (MERC)  will  require  licensed  distributors  operating  in  the  state  to \nprocure 3% of total energy input from renewable energy sources in 2007, with a 1 percentage \npoint increase each year until 2010 to reach 6% of total energy input. As a licensed distributor, \nTPC has decided to undertake more wind power projects to comply with the requirement. \n \n5. \nTPC is a sponsor of the Tala-Delhi Transmission Project, for which ADB provided a long-\nterm direct loan denominated in Indian rupees from ADB.1 The 1,100-kilometer (km) Tala-Delhi \ntransmission  system,  the  first  private  sector  power  transmission  project  in  Asia,  became \noperational in August 2006. At ADB\u2019s 38th annual meeting in Istanbul in 2005, TPC was invited \nto  speak  at  the  seminar  on  public-private  partnerships,  and  made  a  presentation  on  its \nexperience privatizing the power distribution business in Delhi. Based on the relationship it has \nbuilt  and  maintained  with  TPC,  ADB  has  encouraged  the  company  to  undertake  renewable \nenergy  projects,  as  well  as  conventional  thermal  projects  with  new  technologies  to  achieve \nhigher  efficiency.  In  this  context,  TPC  approached  ADB  for  long-term  debt  financing  to \nimplement wind farm projects. TPC also asked ADB to take the lead in arranging the entire debt \nfinancing  package,  relying  on  ADB\u2019s  catalytic  role,  capability,  and  network  of  financing \ninstitutions. The concept clearance for the loan was approved in December 2006, environmental \nand  social  site  visits  were  conducted  in  January  2007,  and  due  diligence  was  completed  in \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002.

Manila. \n\n\f2 \n\n      \n\n \nA. \n \n\nFebruary  2007.  If  approved,  this  would  be  the  first  ADB  loan  to  assist  a  private  sector  wind \npower project. \n \n\nIII. \n\nBACKGROUND \n\nSector Background in India \n\n1. \n\nDemand and Supply of Power in India \n\n \n6. \nIndia  is  the  third  largest  electricity  consumer  in  Asia  behind  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of \nChina  and  Japan.  As  of  30  September  2005,  India\u2019s  installed  power  generation  capacity  was \n123,014  megawatts  (MW),  of  which  57%  is  owned  and  operated  by  state  entities,  32%  by \ncentral public sector undertakings, and 11% by independent power producers and other private \nsector  utilities.  Thermal  plants,  mostly  coal-fired,  provide  66%  of  the  installed  capacity. \nHydropower accounts for 26% of the capacity, with gas- and oil-fired thermal plants, renewable \nenergy  plants,  and  nuclear  plants  providing  the  remaining  8%.  Despite  its  growing  population \nand  economy,  India\u2019s  annual  consumption  remains  relatively  low  at  606  kilowatt-hours  per \ncapita.  \n \n7. \nPower demand in India has grown rapidly as the economy has expanded at an annual \naverage of 5.6% since 1980. Under the Government\u2019s \u201cPower for All by 2012\u201d initiative, target \ncapacity is being expanded to maintain India\u2019s current 8% economic growth rate. Industry buys \napproximately  33%  of  the  electricity  sold  in  India,  followed  by  agriculture  and  households  at \n25% each, and businesses and others at 17%. India continues to suffer from chronic electricity \nshortages, where peak demand exceeds supply by more than 10%; the energy deficit between \nApril  and  December  2006  was  7.7%.2  Power  quality  remains  poor,  marked  by  high  voltage \nfluctuations  and  recurring  load  shedding.  As  the  10th  Five  Year  Plan  (FY2002\u2013FY2007) \nachieves only 75% of the capacity additions needed by the end of this period, energy shortfalls \nwill  persist  over  the  short  to  medium  term.  The  Government  seeks  to  eliminate  this  deficit  by \nFY2012, which marks the end of the 11th Five Year Plan (FY2008\u2013FY2012).  \n \n\n2. \n\nPotential and Achievement in the Wind Power Sector \n\n \n8. \nAs the Indian power sector has grown, the country has become increasingly dependent \non  fossil  fuels.  With  the  recent  hike  in  oil  and  gas  prices,  as  well  as  the  expected  fossil  fuel \nshortages  in  the  future,  the  security  of  the  energy  supply  in  India  has  generated  increasing \nconcern.  The  environmental  concern  over  excess  use  of  fossil  fuels  also  is  rising.  In  this \ncontext, India urgently needs to explore sustainable energy development, and the Government \nhas been working proactively to promote the use of renewable energy sources. \n \nAmong  the  renewable  power  resources  available  in  India,  wind  energy  is  a  promising \n9. \nsource for further development. The country has 45,000 MW of gross potential and 13,000 MW \nof technical potential for wind power. As of September 2006, India had more than 6,000 MW of \ninstalled wind power capacity, ranking the country fourth in the world. The 10th Five Year Plan \ntargets a 1,500 MW increase of installed wind power capacity. However, 3,017.55 MW is likely \nto be installed.3 \n \n\n                                                 \n2  Ministry of Power. 2006. Annual Report 2005\u20132006.

New Delhi. \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nThe  Government  has  provided  support  measures  to  increase  renewable  energy \n10. \ncontributions  in  the  country.  It  also  issued  policy  guidelines  for  the  state  governments  to \nestablish  and  maintain  state-specific  policies  to  promote  renewable  power  projects.  These \ninclude  permission  to  accelerate  depreciation,  concession  or  full  exemption  from  customs \nduties, tax holidays, and soft loans available through Government-owned agencies. \n \n11.  Maharashtra is one of the leading states in promoting wind power generation. The state \nhas  an  estimated  3,650  MW  of  gross  potential  and  3,000  MW  of  technical  potential  for  wind \nenergy.  As  of  September  2006,  installed  wind power  capacity  in  Maharashtra  was  1,242  MW, \nthe second most among states in India. From 2003 to March 2006, Maharashtra developed 750 \nMW of additional capacity. Appendix 1 further explains the wind power sector in India. \n \nB. \n \n\nAsian Development Bank Operations \n\n1. \n\nADB\u2019s Country Strategy for India \n\n \n12.  Mainstreaming  poverty  reduction  is  the  central  organizing  theme  of  ADB\u2019s  country \nstrategy and program (CSP) for India.4 It draws on the three pillars of ADB\u2019s poverty reduction \nstrategy:  pro-poor  growth,  social  development,  and  good  governance.  The  strategy  aims  to \nsupport  the  Government\u2019s  high-growth  agenda  by  assisting  fiscal  consolidation,  infrastructure \ndevelopment,  and  private  sector  development.  Political  and  economic  developments  since \nfinalizing the CSP indicate that its assistance strategy remains valid, especially the core strategy \nof  poverty  reduction  through  infrastructure-led  growth  supported  by  social  development  and \ngood  governance.  The  2006\u20132008  CSP5  update  suggests  that  the  objective  of  accelerating \nIndia\u2019s  annual  gross  domestic  product  growth  to  8%  depends  on  upgrading  infrastructure \nfacilities  and  improving  the  efficiency  of  such  public  services.  ADB\u2019s  proposed  assistance \nprogram reflects this priority, with infrastructure accounting for nearly 77% of the 3-year pipeline \n(not including private sector and nonsovereign operations). \n \n\n2. \n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy \n\n \nADB\u2019s  energy  sector  strategy6  establishes  its  operational  priorities  as  (i)  reducing \n13. \npoverty  by,  among  others,  creating  energy  infrastructure  for  sustainable  economic  growth;  (ii) \npromoting  private  sector  involvement  by  restructuring  the  energy  sector  and  creating  an \nenabling  environment  for  private  investors;  (iii)  addressing  regional  and  global  environmental \nimpacts; and (iv) promoting regional cooperation. In particular, the strategy strongly encourages \nADB  interventions  to  increase  investment  in  the  renewable  energy  subsector,  as  well  as  to \nincrease  private  sector  participation  in  the  energy  sector  to  take  advantage  of  the  higher \noperational  efficiencies  that  private  operators  can  achieve  and  to  meet  the  large  capital \nrequirements. \n \n14. \nADB\u2019s assistance for the power sector, as outlined in the 2006\u20132008 CSP update, has \nsix main priorities: (i) reforming the sector; (ii) promoting higher efficiency and low-carbon power \nsources  that  are  locally  available;  (iii)  expanding  and  optimizing  transmission  and  distribution \nsystems;  (iv)  supporting  institutional  strengthening  to  implement  reforms  required  by  the \nElectricity  Act  of  2003,  including  development  of  more  flexible  power  delivery  and  trading \n\n                                                 \n4  ADB.  2003.

To support the Government\u2019s \u201cPower for \nAll by 2012\u201d initiative, ADB\u2019s strategy for the power sector will create synergy with the 10th and \n11th  Five  Year  Plans.  This  includes  development  of  sustainable  energy  development, \nparticularly promotion of renewable energy projects. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE BORROWER \n\nBackground \n\n \nA. \n \nTPC  is  a  part  of  the  Tata  Group,7  which  comprises  92  companies  in  seven  business \n15. \nsectors\u2014engineering,  materials,  energy,  chemicals,  services,  consumer  products,  and \ninformation  systems  and  communications.

It  prohibits  employees  of  Tata \nGroup  companies  from  engaging  in  corrupt  practices,  and  promotes  transparent,  fair,  and \nethical  business  behavior.  Based  on  this  code  of  conduct,  Tata  Group  companies  also  are \nencouraged  to  be  good  corporate  citizens  and  to  undertake  corporate  social  responsibility \nactivities. TPC also adopted a \u201cwhistle blower\u201d policy to give employees a mechanism to report \nto  management  concerns  about  unethical  behavior,  actual  or  suspected  fraud,  or  violations  of \nthe  company\u2019s  code  of  conduct  or  ethics  policy.  The  Tata  Code  of  Conduct  is  presented  in \nAppendix 3. \n \nC. \n \n21. \nTPC\u2019s main business operations are (i) setting up independent power plants; (ii) setting \nup  captive  power  plants;  (iii)  undertaking  power  transmission  and  distribution  projects;  (iv) \nproviding operation and maintenance services for power projects; (v) providing erection, testing, \ncommissioning, and trial operations services; and (vi) providing utility operations management, \nand training in plant operations for power projects. The power business generates 94% of the \nrevenues;  and  the  Mumbai  license  area,  where  TPC  has  a  strong  competitive  position  and \nfinancially  strong  customers,  accounts  for  86%  of  power  revenues.  TPC\u2019s  installed  capacity is \n2,323 MW, through one multi-fuel thermal power station at Trombay, Maharashtra (1,350 MW); \nthree  hydroelectric  power  stations  in  Maharashtra  (477  MW);  one  coal-fired  thermal  power \nstation in Jharkhand (428 MW); one diesel oil-fired thermal power station in Karnataka (81 MW); \nand one wind power farm in Maharashtra (17 MW). \n \n22. \nTPC  is  maintaining  strong  operating  efficiency.  Plant  availability  is  nearly  95%.  Plant \nload factor of TPC\u2019s thermal power plants is 78%\u201382%, which is above the national average of \n73%.  To  continuously  improve  the  quality  and  reliability  of  the  power  supply,  TPC  is \nmeticulously planning and implementing energy conservation measures and system upgrades. \nThese  include  commissioning  new  substations  and  enhancing  the  cable  and  transmission \nnetwork  throughout  the  license  area  in  Mumbai  and  its  suburbs.  The  transmission  and \ndistribution loss in TPC\u2019s network is very low at 2.1%. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f6 \n\n      \n\nV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nProject Description \n\n \nA. \n \nTPC  is  setting  up  additional  wind  energy  projects  at  two  locations  in  the  state  of \n23. \nMaharashtra  with  a  total  capacity  of  100.4  MW.  One  subproject  (the  Khandke  Wind  Power \nProject)  is  near  Khandke  village  in  Ahmednagar  district,  about  22  km  from  Ahmednagar.  The \nnearest  railway  station  is  Ahmednagar,  and  the  nearest  airports  are  Pune  and  Aurangabad, \nabout 100 km from the site. The other subproject (the Bramanvel Wind Power Project) is near \nBramanvel  village  in  Dhulia  district,  about  70  km  from  Dhulia.  The  nearest  railway  station  is \nDhulia, while the nearest airport is Aurangabad, 250 km from the site. \n \nThe Khandke Wind Power Project involves the construction and operation of 50.4 MW of \n24. \nwind  power  generation  facilities  (63  units  of  800  kilowatts)  and  a  30  to  132  kilovolt  (kV) \nsubstation at Khandke village, as well as a 4 km transmission line to the nearest line-in-line-out \npoint on the 132 kV transmission lines of Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Company \nLimited.  Each  wind  turbine  generator  will  be  installed  at  a  hub  height  of  75  meters  (m)  with  a \nrotor diameter of 53 m. \n \n25. \nThe Bramanvel Wind Power Project involves the construction and operation of 50 MW of \nwind power generation facilities (40 units of 1,250 kilowatts) and a 30 to 220 kV substation at \nBramanvel  village,  as  well  as  a  35  km  transmission  line  to  the  nearest  220  kV  substation  of \nMaharashtra State Electricity Transmission Company Limited at Dhondaicha. Each wind turbine \ngenerator will be installed at a hub height of 74 m with a rotor diameter of 74 m. \n \nB. \n \n26. \nFollowing  a  competitive  bidding  process  to  select  the  two  subprojects,  TPC  awarded \nEnercon  India  Limited  (EIL)  for  the  Khandke  Wind  Power  Project  and  Suzlon  Energy  Limited \n(SEL) for the Bramanvel Wind Power Project.  \n \n27. \nEIL  and  SEL  were  awarded  the  total  scope  for  their  respective  subprojects  until \ncommissioning  on  a  turnkey  basis,  including  design,  manufacturing,  transport,  erection,  and \ncommissioning.  The  power  evacuation  arrangement  was  included  in  the  scope.  Both \nsubprojects  are  being  implemented  under  supervision  of  TCE  Consulting  Engineers  Limited \n(TCE), formerly known as Tata Consulting Engineers. \n \n28. \nsubprojects.  \n \nEIL  is  a  joint  venture  between  Enercon  GmbH  of  Germany  (56%),  the  second  largest \n29. \nwind energy company in the world, and the Mehra group of Mumbai (44%). EIL, which started \ncommercial  operations  in  1995,  crossed  the  milestone  of  1,000  wind  energy  converter \ninstallations and the 500 MW benchmarks during FY2005. \n \n30. \nSEL, the leading wind energy company in India, had a market share of more than 50% in \n2005. It is also the world\u2019s fifth largest wind turbine manufacturer. Established in 1995, SEL had \ncumulative  global  sales  of  2,321  wind  turbine  generators  with  total  capacity  of  2,108  MW  by \nMarch 2006. \n \n\nTPC  also  will  enter  into  20-year  O&M  contracts  with  EIL  and  SEL  for  their  respective \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nEnvironmental Aspects and Social Dimensions \n\nTCE  was  established  in  1962  as  a  partnership  between  the  Tata  Group\u2019s  electric \n31. \ncompanies  and  Ebasco  Services  Incorporated  of  the  United  States.  The  business  and \nundertaking of TCE became a division of Tata Sons Limited in 1968, and was transferred to the \nnew  TCE,  incorporated  in  December  1999  as  a  new  company  and  now  a  wholly  owned \nsubsidiary  of  Tata  Sons  Limited.  TCE  has  executed  more  than  3,000  assignments,  covering \npower,  chemical,  industrial,  information  and  technology  infrastructure,  and  water  supply  and \nsewerage projects. \n \nTPC  will  distribute  the  energy  generated  by  the  Project  in  its  license  area  to  meet  the \n32. \nrequired  purchase  specification  (RPS)  under  the  order  issued  by  MERC.8  The  RPS  is  the \npercentage of energy inputs that licensed distributors in the state of Maharashtra are obliged to \nprocure  from  renewable  energy  sources.  Set  at  3%  for  FY2007,  the  RPS  will  increase  by  1 \npercentage  point  annually  until  reaching  6%  in  FY2010.  While  failure  to  meet  the  RPS  in \nFY2007 does not carry a penalty, any licensed distributor that fails to meet the RPS in FY2008 \nwill be required to pay Rs5 per kilowatt hour (kWh) of shortfall. The penalty rate will increase to \nRs6 per kWh in FY2009 and Rs7 per kWh in FY2010. \n \nC. \n \n33. \nThe  Project  has  been  classified  as  category  B,  because  it  is  unlikely  to  create  a \nsignificant  environmental  impact  during  construction  and  operation.  ADB  staff  and  a  project \nconsultant  made  site  visits  on  16\u201317  January  2007.  The  initial  environmental  examination  was \nprepared  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental  safeguard  policies  and  information  disclosure  for \nenvironmental  category  B  projects.  The  initial  environmental  examination  was  posted  on  the \nADB Web site on 23 March 2007. \n \n34. \nThe main adverse environmental impacts of the Project will be noise (aerodynamic and \nmechanical)  from  the  operating  turbines,  and  the  visual  impact  on  the  landscape.  The  noise \nfrom the wind farm at both sites is unlikely to be significant, because the turbines appear to be \nset  back  sufficiently  from  permanent  settlements  for  adequate  noise  attenuation.  The \nlandscapes that  are  to be  affected visually  from  turbine  placement  do  not  appear  to  have  any \nunique  features.  The  types  of  likely  or  potential  project  construction  impacts  (i.e.,  land \ndisturbance,  vegetation  clearance,  erosion  and  sedimentation,  water  quality  decline, \nconstruction noise and traffic, waste generation, and loss of agricultural land) are classified as \nsecondary  impacts  due  to  the  limited  extent  and  significance  of  their  consequences.  The \nimplementation  of  appropriate  management  measures  will  largely  avoid  or  mitigate  these \nimpacts. \n \n35. \nThe Project is classified as category C for involuntary resettlement. Land for the project \nsites has been acquired on a negotiated settlement basis, with payments covering land acquired \nfor wind turbine sites and routing of transmission lines on an easement right basis. Aside from \nthe  single  substation,  the  parcels  acquired  at  Khandke  are  marginal  slices  of  individual \nlandholdings,  primarily  grazing  areas.  These  will  revert  to  their  original  state,  and  all  previous \nowners will have full access to them for their livestock after construction. At Bramanvel, where \nthe site is on forestland leased from the Government, only easement rights have been paid for \nthe transmission line where it runs across individual landholdings. As the sellers have not been \ncoerced  and  are  not  subject  to  expropriation,  the  transactions  are  essentially  between  willing \n\n                                                 \n8  MERC. 2006.

The  Project  has  caused  no  displacement, \nhas not affected any physical structures, and has not led to the loss of livelihoods. \n \n36. \nAs the Project is classified as category C for indigenous peoples, an indigenous peoples \nplan is not required. Although Maharashtra has a significant tribal population, the Project has no \nperceptible  impacts  on  distinct  tribal  groups  in  the  project  areas.  Since  the  forestland  at \nBramanvel is primarily scrub, it has no forest-dependent peoples. \n \nDuring due diligence for the Project, no significant adverse impacts was identified related \n37. \nto  the  acquisition  of  land  and  assets.  The  land  was  acquired  in  a  manner  that  ensured  fair \nmarket-based prices. One of the main benefits of the site at Khandke was that, consistent with \nwind  farm  practices  worldwide,  TPC  and  EIL  ensured  open  access  to  villagers  for  grazing  on \nlands  already  sold.  The  700  owners  who  sold  land  would  lose  no  more  than  0.1  acres  per \nindividual, less than 1% of any single landholding. At Bramanvel, there are other operating wind \nfarms, and with an additional installed capacity by the TPC\u2019s project, the whole area is soon to \nbe  the  world\u2019s  largest  wind  farm  spread  over  an  area  38  km  by  22  km.  Rapidly  growing \ncommunities,  essentially  cohesive  groups  of  mixed  minorities  and  recent  settlers,  are  taking \nadvantage  of  the  economic  opportunities  of  a  large  project\u2014rental  housing,  restaurants,  and \nancillary services. \n \nD. \n \n38. \nOne of the major keys for poverty reduction in India is to maintain sustainable and high \neconomic  growth  being  supplemented  by  social  development.  The  Project  is  expected  to \ncontribute  to  the  country\u2019s  poverty  reduction  through  its  threefold  development  impacts:  (i)  to \nincrease power generation capacity to mitigate power shortages in India, particularly in the state \nof  Maharashtra;  (ii)  to  develop  additional  renewable  energy  sources,  diversifying  the  country\u2019s \nenergy portfolio and mitigating its dependence on conventional fossil fuel-fired thermal capacity; \nand (iii) to promote private sector participation in developing power sector infrastructure. These \nare presented in the design and monitoring framework in Appendix 4. \n \nE. \n \n39. \nADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  and  Operations  Evaluation  Department \nare  formulating  guidelines  for  implementing  the  Good\u2013Practice  Standards  for  Evaluation  of \nPrivate  Sector  Investment  Operations,9  which  were  prepared  by  the  Evaluation  Cooperation \nGroup of the multilateral development banks. These standards cover the roles of the Operations \nEvaluation  Department  and  Private  Sector  Operations  Department,  the  evaluation  dimensions \nfor  private  sector  operations,  the  nature  of  annual  reporting,  and  dissemination  of  reports  and \nlessons. According to the standards, the three principle dimensions for private sector evaluation \nare (i) development outcome, encompassing a project\u2019s performance, contribution to economic \nsustainability,  and  contribution  to  private  sector  development;  (ii)  investment  profitability  of  the \nproject intervention to the institution itself (i.e., specific returns on the loan, guarantee, or equity \ninvestment);  and  (iii)  operational  effectiveness  measured  and  assessed  on  an  overall \ndevelopment level. \n \n40. \nThe  Project  was  assessed  and  described  from  the  perspectives  of  development \neffectiveness and project framework in terms of its specific performance, as well as the Project\u2019s \n\nDevelopment Effectiveness \n\n                                                 \n9   Multilateral Development Banks Evaluation Cooperation Group. 2006.

The Project is deemed \ndevelopmentally effective and its performance measurable. The details are in the development \neffectiveness framework in Appendix 4. \n \nF. \n \n41. \nAn  economic  analysis  was  conducted  to  measure  the  viability  of  the  Project  from  the \nperspective  of  India\u2019s  economy.  All  costs  and  benefits  are  expressed  in  domestic  price \nnumeraire in 2007 constant values, with all taxes and duties excluded. \n \n42. \nThe major economic benefit from the Project is the value of electricity generated, which \nis fully absorbed at present levels of demand for electricity in Maharashtra. The state has been \nfacing  worsening  power  shortages  since  1998.  The  main  reason  for  the  energy  and  power \nshortages  in  the  past  decade  is  that  the  capacity  additions  have  lagged  significantly  behind \ndemand  growth.  Hence,  the  electricity  generated  by  the  Project  is  considered  to  meet  unmet \ndemand, i.e., it would not substitute power from any existing generation capacity, which means \nthe entire output from the Project is considered incremental. TPC has been assumed to supply \npower  to  distributors  and  bulk  end  consumers  in  the  same  proportion  as  it  does  now  in  the \nMumbai  license  area.  Although  the  Project\u2019s  eligibility  to  receive  the  CER  revenue  is  still \nuncertain,  the  economic  analysis  incorporated  the  CER  revenue.  Even  if  the  Project  is  not \nentitled  to  the  CER  revenue,  the  same  monetary  amount  is  counted  as  part  of  the  economic \nbenefits stemming from the positive external effects on the global environment. \n \n43. \nCosts  include  the  capital  and  labor  costs  to  construct  the  Project,  as  well  as  the  O&M \ncosts. A standard conversion factor is applied to non-traded items, and labor conversion factors \nare  used  for  unskilled  and  skilled  labor.  Tradable  inputs  are  valued  at  their  border  price \nequivalent  and  have  been  converted  to  domestic  equivalents  using  an  estimated  shadow \nexchange rate factor of 1.05. \n \n44. \ndiscount rate of 12%. \n \n\nThe  base  case  economic  internal  rate  of  return  was  estimated  at  above  the  social \n\nVI. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \n\nADB Loan \n\n \nA. \n \nADB  will  provide  a  local  currency  loan  of  up  to  Rs3.52  billion  from  its  ordinary  capital \n45. \nresources to TPC without a Government guarantee. Proceeds of the loan will be used for eligible \ncapital  expenditures  and  civil  works  for  the  Project  undertaken  by  TPC.  Financial  institutions \nacceptable to ADB will fully cover (through a guarantee or other acceptable financial instrument) \nup to Rs2.26 billion of the proposed loan. Under this structure, ADB\u2019s net exposure to the risk of \nTPC will be no more than Rs1.26 billion, which is 25% of the capital expenditure to which TPC \nplans to apply the proceeds of the loan. The balance of the exposure to TPC will be transferred \nto the guarantors, resulting in ADB being exposed to counterparty risk up to Rs2.26 billion. \n \n46. \nThe  financing  structure,  whereby  financial  institutions  participate  in  the  loan  through \nsyndication, risk or funded participation or by providing a guarantee or other acceptable financial \ninstrument  to  ADB  is  proposed  for  two  reasons.  First,  this  structure  would  catalyze  risk-taking \ncapacity of international financial institutions that do not have rupee funding capacity, but have \nan appetite to take the risk associated with the loan to assist a borrower that needs long-term \n\n\f10 \n\n      \n\nrupee  financing.10  Second,  by  transferring  risk  to  a  third  party  financial  institution,  ADB\u2019s  net \nexposure to the risk of TPC would be reduced to the level within ADB\u2019s single project exposure \nlimit applicable for nonsovereign operations.11 \n \nThe  proposed  ADB  loan  will  be  documented  in  a  loan  agreement,  which  will  contain \n47. \nstandard terms and conditions for private sector loans without a Government guarantee, as well \nas covenants relating to ADB\u2019s policies.12 The loan will be subject to conditions precedent to the \ndisbursement,  including  all  necessary  government,  creditor,  and  shareholder  approvals  and \nconsents;  and  all  contractual  and  financial  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB.  The  loan \nagreement  will  include  (i)  appropriate  representations  and  warranties;  (ii)  covenants,  including \naffirmative, negative, financial, and information covenants; and (iii) events of default. ADB also \nwill  enter  into  a  financing  agreement  with  financial  institutions  acceptable  to  ADB  pursuant  to \nwhich  ADB\u2019s  participation  in  the  financing  will  be  covered  by  a  guarantee  or  other  acceptable \nfinancial  instrument  to  ADB.  Further,  ADB  might  enter  into  relevant  agreements  for  the \nsyndication or participation of the covered portion of the ADB loan. \n \nB. \n \n48. \n \n\nThe proposed loan merits ADB\u2019s support for the following reasons: \n\nJustification \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nThe  proposed  ADB  loan  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  CSP  for  India,  which \nemphasizes \ninfrastructure  development,  private  sector  participation,  and \nrenewable  energy  development  in  the  country.  Particularly  in  the  power  sector, \npolicy  dialogue  by  the  South  Asia  Regional  Department  has  focused  on  (a) \nsupporting  sector  reform  and  restructuring,  (b)  enhancing  energy  efficiency  and \nclean  energy  development,  and  (iii)  promoting  balanced  physical  infrastructure \ndevelopment.  The  proposed  ADB  loan  is  in  line  with  this  strategy  and  dovetails \nwith  the  efforts  including  ongoing  dialogues  with  the  Government  under  the \npublic  sector  operations.  If  approved,  it  will  be  the  first  financing  by  ADB  of \nprivate sector renewable energy project. \n\nThe  proposed  ADB  loan  is  consistent  with  the  ADB\u2019s  energy  sector  policy \n(footnote  6).  It  also  forms  a  part  of  ADB\u2019s  clean  energy  and  environment \nprogram, which was launched in response to the communiqu\u00e9 by the Group of 8 \nGleneagles Summit in July 2005.13 The ADB\u2019s energy policy states that ADB will \n\n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2006. Review of ADB\u2019s Credit Enhancement Operations. Manila. It highlights the importance of using credit \nenhancement products such as \u201csyndications\u201d to mobilize risk-taking capacity from commercial financing partners, \nand to diversify risk and leverage ADB\u2019s balance sheet. Paragraph 56 (ii) refers to the use of syndications, which \nenables  ADB  to  transfer  some  or  all  of  the  risk  associated  with  its  direct  loans  to  its  financing  partners,  thereby \nreducing  its  credit  exposure.  Meanwhile,  paragraph  57  (ii)  explains  that  syndications  through  reinsurance  (and \nguarantee  arrangements  as  proposed  in  this  RRP)  enable  ADB  to  share  any  associated  recovery  with  other \nsyndicate members and assume counterparty risk. \n\n11 ADB. 1985. Bank Assistance to the Private Sector. Manila. Paras. 25\u201327 of this paper read: \u201cOne of the principal \nconcerns  regarding  this  facility  (lending  without  government  guarantee)  is  that  Bank  loans  to  private  enterprises \nwithout  a  DMC  (developing  member  country)  government  guarantee  will  inevitably  involve  higher  risk  in \ncomparison with loans guaranteed or relent through DMC governments\u2026..In the short term, the Bank will have to \nadopt  other  measures  to  minimize  and  safeguard  against  the  risk  of  providing  loans  without  government \nguarantee\u2026..Where  necessary,  the  Bank  could  also  seek  a  guarantee  for  its  loan  from  a  financial  institution \nacceptable to the Bank, or obtain appropriate collateral arrangements or other forms of security.\u201d \n\n12 These  covenants  include  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  (i)  environmental  and  social  safeguard  policies;  (ii)  combating \nmoney  laundering,  antiterrorism,  and  anticorruption  policies;  and  (iii)  procurement  policy  to  the  extent  that  TPC \nmust use the loan proceeds for financing eligible goods and services procured from the ADB\u2019s member countries. \n\n13 Group of 8. 2005. The Gleneagles Communiqu\u00e9. Gleneagles. \n\n\f \n\n11\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n \n(vii) \n\npromote  the  development  of  renewable  energy  sources  in  developing  member \ncountries, and that ADB also will assist in implementing such projects, preferably \nthrough  private  sector  involvement  to  ensure  their  sustainable  long-term \noperations. The clean energy and environment program includes implementation \nof renewable energy investment opportunities. \n\nThe proposed ADB loan helps increase power generation from renewable energy \nsources in India. India has been trying to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels \nand to develop renewable energy sources, which are abundant in the country, to \nincrease  energy  security  and  promote  environmentally  sustainable  economic \ndevelopment. The proposed ADB loan will assist in adding 10% more wind power \ngeneration capacity in the state of Maharashtra, and approximately 2.5% to the \ncountry. \n\nThe proposed ADB loan will help TPC finance projects that are adding significant \nvolumes of renewable energy sources to its portfolio. TPC\u2019s strategy is to reduce \nits dependence on oil and gas as a fuel. While this strategy will be implemented \nprimarily  by  pursuing  more  coal-fired  thermal  projects,  TPC  is  also  keen  to \ndevelop  wind  power  projects  in  view  of  the  RPS  requirement  that  MERC \nintroduced  recently.  The  power  generated  by  the  Project  will  account  for  6%  of \nthe TPC\u2019s direct power sales in its Mumbai license area, and also will help other \nlicensees in the state to achieve their RPS requirements. \n\nThe proposed ADB loan helps improve the country\u2019s environmental standards by \nreducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  The  Project  will  reduce  greenhouse  gas \nemissions by approximately 129,000 tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year and \nby  approximately  2.6  million  tons  of  CO2  during  the  minimum  project  life  of  20 \nyears. \n\nThe  introduction  of  a  risk  participation  facility,  as  well  as  syndication  and/or \nparticipation  arrangement,  catalyzes  the  financing  capacity  of  other  financial \ninstitutions,  which  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  credit  enhancement  operations  policy \n(footnote 14). Through the use of its risk participation facility, the proposed ADB \nloan will catalyze Rs2.26 billion (approximately equivalent to $51.0 million) of risk-\ntaking  capacity  by  commercial  banks.  The  risk  sharing  scheme  particularly \nmobilizes  the  capacity  of  international  banks,  which  do  not  have  a  strong \ncapacity to provide direct long-term rupee financing, but have sufficient capacity \nto  take  part  in  the  risk  participation  arrangement  with  ADB.  In  addition,  ADB \nmight syndicate part of the covered portion to other financial institutions, reducing \nits net exposure. \n\nThe  proposed  ADB  loan,  which  will  provide  long-term,  fixed-interest  rupee \nfinancing,  will  offer  the  best  possible  solution  to  the  Borrower  under  current \nmarket circumstances. The Borrower values such long-term, fixed-interest rupee \nfinancing by ADB since such a product is not readily available in Indian financial \nmarkets.  As  most  of  TPC\u2019s  revenues  are  in  Indian  rupees,  the  rupee  financing \nhelps avoid a currency mismatch between revenues and expenditures. The feed-\nin  tariff  for  wind  energy  projects  does  not  allow  financing  costs  to  be  passed \nthrough.  As  such,  the  long-term,  fixed-interest  rate  will  increase  stability  of  the \nProject\u2019s  financing  plan.  This  also  will  help  to  make  wind  energy  generation  a \n\n\f12 \n\n      \n\n\u201cstand  alone\u201d  business,  thereby  encouraging  more  investments  by  Indian  and \nforeign utilities. \n\nAnticorruption  Policy,  and  Combating  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of \n\n \nC. \nTerrorism \n \nTPC  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  policies  on  anticorruption14  and  combating  of  money \n49. \nlaundering and the financing of terrorism.15 Consistent with its commitment to good governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  will  require  TPC  to  maintain  and  comply  with  internal \nprocedures  and  controls  following  international  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of \npreventing  corruption,  money  laundering  activities,  or  the  financing  of  terrorism.

If the portion of the loan covered (by a guarantee or other acceptable financial \ninstrument)  by  financial  institutions  is  deducted  from  the  computation  of  the  exposure  to  TPC \nrisk, the residual net exposure to TPC would be up to the equivalent of $28.3 million. Although \nthis net exposure is within the single project limit, it still will exceed the group exposure limit by \nthe equivalent of $14.7 million.

With the recent hike of oil and gas prices, as well as the expected shortages of \nfossil fuels in the future, the security of India\u2019s energy supply is generating increasing concern. \nThe  environmental  concern  over  excess  use  of  fossil  fuels  also  is  rising.  In  this  context,  India \nurgently  needs  to  explore  sustainable  energy  development,  and  the  Government  has  been \nworking proactively to promote use of renewable energy sources. \n \nAmong  the  renewable  power  resources  available  in  India,  wind  energy  is  a  promising \n2. \nsource for further development. India has 45,000 megawatts (MW) of gross potential, assuming \n1% of land availability for wind power generation in the potential areas. Sites with annual mean \nwind  density  exceeding  200  watts  per  square  meter  are  considered  suitable  for  wind  power \nprojects, and 211 such sites have been identified in the country. However, technical potential is \nlimited  to  only  13,000  MW,  assuming  20%  grid  penetration,  which  will  rise  with  the \naugmentation  of  grid  capacity  in  potential  states.  As  of  September  2006,  India  had  installed \nwind  power  capacity  of  more  than  6,000  MW,  ranking  the  country  fourth  in  the  world  after \nGermany, Spain, and the United States. In the 10th Five Year Plan for fiscal year (FY) 2002 to \n2007 targets a 1,500 MW increase of installed wind power capacity. However, 3,017.55 MW is \nlikely to be installed.1 The installed wind power capacity and gross potential in India by state is \nin Table A1. \n \n\nTable A1: Installed Wind Power Capacity and Potential in India by State \n(MW) \n\nState \n\nAndhra Pradesh \nGujarat \nKarnataka \nKerala \nMadhya Pradesh \nMaharashtra \nRajastan \nTamil Nadu \nWest Bengal \nOthers \n\nTotal \n\nAs of \n31 March 2005 \n120.5 \n253.5 \n410.8 \n2.0 \n28.9 \n456.2 \n284.8 \n2,034.9 \n1.1 \n1.6 \n3,594.3 \n\nAs of \n31 March 2006 \n121.0 \n338.1 \n584.6 \n2.0 \n40.3 \n1,001.3 \n358.1 \n2,892.5 \n1.1 \n1.6 \n5,340.6 \n\nAs of \n30 September 2006 \n121.0 \n375.6 \n687.5 \n2.0 \n53.0 \n1,241.7 \n385.9 \n3,148.1 \n1.6 \n1.6 \n6,018.0 \n\nMW = megawatt. \nSource: Ministry of New and Renewable Energy. \n\nGross Potential \n\n8,275 \n9,675 \n6,620 \n875 \n5,500 \n3,650 \n1,700 \n5,400 \n3,050 \n450 \n45,195 \n\n \n3. \nMaharashtra is one of the leading states in promoting wind power generation.

Mid Term Appraisal of the Tenth Five Year Plan (2002\u20132007). New Delhi. \n\n\f16 \n\n     Appendix 1 \n\nEvolution of Regulatory Framework \n\nB. \n \n4. \nThe Government\u2019s efforts to promote renewable energy started in early 1980s after the \nfirst  and  second  global  oil  shocks.  The  Government  created  the  Commission  for  Additional \nSources of Energy in 1981 and Department of Non-Conventional Energy Sources in 1982. The \nDepartment  of  Non-Conventional  Energy  Sources  was  transformed  into  the  Ministry  of  Non-\nConventional Energy Sources (MNES) in 1992, and then was renamed as the Ministry of New \nand Renewable Energy (MNRE) in 2006. MNRE is the nodal ministry in the Government for all \nmatters relating to new and renewable energy. Its main functions include (i) policy making and \nplanning,  (ii)  program  formulation  and  implementation,  (iii)  research  and  development,  (iv) \ntechnology  development  and  commercialization,  (v)  promotion  of  demonstration  and  pilot \nprojects, and (vi) implementation of fiscal and financial incentives. \n \n5. \nMNES (currently MNRE) established the Centre for Wind Energy Technology at Chennai \nas an autonomous research and development institution of the Government, and as a technical \nfocal  point  for  wind  power  development  in  the  country.  The  center  provides  developers  with \ntechnical services, including wind resource assessment for project sites, testing and certification \nservices for equipment, and training and capacity building services. \n \n6. \nTechnological  advancements  are  increasing  gradually  the  commercial  viability  of  wind \npower projects. The replacement of old 250 kilowatt wind turbines at a height of 30 meter (m) \nwith  1  MW  single  unit  size  at  50  m  height  has  made  them  more  attractive  as  investments. \nHigher  wind  power  density  due  to  increased  height,  lower  installation  cost  per  MW,  and  less \nland requirement make a case for choosing higher unit size of wind turbines. India\u2019s advantage \nis that wind turbines of 1 MW or above are being manufactured in the country. \n \n7. \nFiscal and financial incentives provided by the Government and the state governments \ntraditionally have driven the development of wind power projects in India. The incentives being \nprovided by the Government include (i) 80% accelerated depreciation of project costs for wind \npower  projects;  (ii)  concessions  or  full  exemption  of  certain  imported  components  of  wind \nturbines;  (iii)  tax  holiday  for  a  maximum  of  10  consecutive  years  within  15  years  of \ncommissioning,  which  is  available  for  infrastructure  projects;  and  (iv)  concessional  loans2 \nIndian  Renewable  Energy \navailable \nDevelopment  Agency  Limited,  Power  Finance  Corporation  Limited,  and  Rural  Electrification \nCorporation Limited. The government of Maharashtra allows (i) captive use and third party sales \nof  power,  (ii)  2%  of  energy  as  wheeling  and  5%  as  transmission  and  distribution  losses,  (iii) \nelectricity  banking  arrangements  for  12  months,  and  (iv)  a  feed-in  tariff  of  Rs3.5  per  kilowatt-\nhour (kWh) for the first year after commissioning and annual tariff escalation of Rs0.15 up to the \n13th  year.  The  state  government  also  provides  assistance  to  set  up  evacuation  arrangements \nand associated infrastructure. \n \n8. \nRecently,  the  focus  of  the  regulatory  framework  for  the  renewable  energy  sector  has \nchanged  from  being  driven  by  the  supply  side  to  being  driven  by  the  demand  side.  The \nElectricity  Act,  20033  requires  all  state-level  energy  regulatory  commissions  to  ensure  that \nelectricity  distributors  procure  a  specified  minimum  percentage  of  power  generation  from \n\nthrough  Government-owned  agencies, \n\nincluding \n\n                                                 \n2  The concessional loans may not be \u201cconcessional,\u201d especially for borrowers with high credit. \n3  Section  86  of  the  Electricity  Act,  2003  states:  \u201cThe  State  Commission  shall  discharge  the  following  functions, \nnamely:\u2026(e)  promote  cogeneration  and  generation  of  electricity  from  renewable  sources  of  energy  by  providing \nsuitable measures for connectivity with the grid and sale of electricity to any person, and also specify, for purchase \nof  electricity  from  such  sources,  a  percentage  of  the  total  consumption  of  electricity  in  the  area  of  a  distribution \nlicense;\u2026\u201d \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n17\n\nrenewable  energy  sources.  The  midterm  appraisal  of  the  10th  Five  Year  Plan  by  Planning \nCommission  (footnote  1)    included  the  following  recommendations  for  the  renewable  energy \nsector: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nSwitch incentives and support from the supply-driven programs to demand-driven \nprograms and technologies. \nExplore  alternative  subsidy  structures  that  encourage  utilities  to  integrate  wind, \nsmall hydroelectric, cogeneration, etc., into their systems. \nPhase out capital subsidies linked to the creation of renewable capacity in favor \nof subsidies linked to renewable energy generated. \nState electricity regulatory commissions should mandate the purchase of energy \nfrom renewable sources, as per the provisions of the Electricity Act. \nImprove  coordination  and  synergize  the  programs  of  MNES  (currently  MNRE) \nwith similar programs of other central ministries and state governments. \n\nBased  on \n\nthe  relevant  section  of \n\nthe  Electricity  Act,  2003,  as  well  as \n\n \n9. \nthe \nrecommendations by the Planning Commission, the state government introduced the concept of \nrequired purchase specification (RPS) in 2006. The RPS is the percentage of total energy inputs \nthat  licensed  distributors  in  the  state  of  Maharashtra  are  obliged  to  procure  from  renewable \nenergy sources. The RPS, set at 3% for FY2007, increases by 1 percentage point annually until \nreaching 6% in FY2010. While failure to meet the RPS for FY2007 does not carry a penalty, any \nlicensed  distributor  that  does  not  achieve  the  RPS  in  FY2008  will  be  required  to  pay  Rs5  per \nkWh of shortfall. The penalty rate will increase to Rs6 per kWh in FY2009 and Rs7 per kWh in \nFY2010.  The  RPS  requirement  has  been  designed  based  on  the  existing  renewable  energy \ngeneration capacity in the state and the planned capacity addition. The targets are expected to \nbe achieved without a major impact on the end-user tariff. \n\n\f18 \n\n     Appendix 2 \n\nTHE TATA POWER COMPANY LIMITED \n \n\nOverview \n\nA. \n \nThe Tata Power Company Limited (TPC) is part of the Tata Group,1 which comprises 96 \n1. \ncompanies  in  seven  business  sectors\u2014engineering,  materials,  energy,  chemicals,  services, \nconsumer  products,  and  information  systems  and  communications.

TPC  secures \n88% of its coal requirements under 5-year contracts, which can be extended for another 5 years \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n21\n\nat TPC\u2019s option. The imported coal contains low sulfur and ash compared to that available from \nother  sources,  especially  domestic  coal  mines.  About  40%  of  thermal  generation  depends  on \nlow-sulfur  heavy  fuel  oil,  which  is  sourced  domestically  from  Indian  Oil  Corporation  Limited, \nBharat  Petroleum  Company  Limited,  and  Hindustan  Petroleum  Company  Limited.  Due  to  the \nreduction  in  the  allocation  of  Bombay  High  Crude  to  these  three  local  refineries  by  Oil  and \nNatural  Gas  Corporation  Limited,  the  availability  of  low-sulfur  heavy  fuel  oil  might  not  be \nadequate in the future. TPC has started initiatives to reduce its dependence on oil by ensuring \nthat capacity augmentation at the Trombay power station would be coal-based. The availability \nof  gas  from  Bombay  High  fields  also  is  decreasing  every  year.  Additional  gas  in  the  Mumbai \narea will be available with the commissioning of the Dahej\u2013Uran pipeline, which is expected to \nbe  operational  in  February  2007.  TPC  is  in  talk  with  Oil  and  Natural  Gas  Corporation  Limited \nand Gail India Limited to augment gas supplies. \n \n\nTable A2.4: Tata Power Company\u2019s Fuel Mix in FY2006 \n(%) \n\nBased on generation \n\nBased on fuel costs \n\nFuel \nCoal \nOil \nGas \nHydro \n\nTotal \n\n32 \n37 \n13 \n18 \n100 \n\n22 \n73 \n5 \n0 \n100 \n\nSource: The Tata Power Company Limited. \n\n \n11. \nTPC  maintains  strong  operating  efficiency.  Plant  availability  is  nearly  95%.  Plant  load \nfactor of TPC\u2019s thermal power plants is 78%\u201382%, which exceeds the country\u2019s average level of \n73%. \n \n12. \nTPC  is  meticulously  planning  and  implementing  energy  conservation  measures  and \nsystem  upgrades.  These  include  commissioning  new  substations  and  enhancing  cable  and \ntransmission  network  to  improve  the  quality  and  reliability  of  the  power  supply  continuously. \nTPC has achieved a low transmission and distribution loss of 2.1%. TPC owns and operates a \ntransmission  and  distribution  network  spread  across  Mumbai,  comprising  (i)  an  overhead  line \nnetwork of about 1,200 circuit kilometer (km) at 220 kilovolts (kV), 110 kV, 22 kV, and 5 kV; (ii) a \ndistribution  network  spread  over  the  entire  license  area  in  Mumbai  and  suburbs;  and  (iii)  an \nunderground cable network of about 745 km at 6.6 kV, 11 kV, 22 kV, 33 kV, 110 kV, and 220 \nkV.  TPC  also  owns  and  operates  major  transformation  facilities,  comprising  (i)  20  major \nreceiving stations at key locations, (ii) compact and reliable 220 kV gas-insulated substations at \nfour  of  its  receiving  stations,  and  (iii)  numerous  consumer  substations  near  consumer  load \ncenters.  \n \nApart from the energy generated by the Jojobera power station and the Belgaum power \n13. \nstation,  most  of  the  power  generated  by  TPC  is  sold  in  its  Mumbai  license  area.  The \nBrihanmumbai Electricity Supply & Transport Undertaking (BEST) and Reliance Energy Limited \n(REL),  which  sell  power  in  their  retail  networks,  are  the  two  largest  clients  of  TPC.  TPC  also \nsells  power  directly  to  large  consumers,  including  the  Mumbai  port,  refineries,  textile  mills, \nfertilizer plants, industrial units, and residential and commercial complexes. Further, TPC sells \npower  to  the  customers  outside  of  the  license  area,  including  Maharashtra  State  Electricity \nBoard  and  Tata  Power  Trading  Company  Limited.

TPC has a power sales agreement only with BEST, and it \ncame  up  for  renewal  in  August,  2005.  The  renewed  agreement  between  TPC  and  BEST  is \nawaiting  ratification  by  Maharashtra  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission  (MERC).  The  power \nsupply  agreement  with  REL  is  also  under  discussion.
