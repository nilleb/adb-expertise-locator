The Project\u2019s design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nPower  generation  in  the  Philippines  was  a  virtual  monopoly  until  an  executive  order \n2. \n(EO 215),  signed  in  1988  opened  the  door  to  private  generating  companies.  A  power  crisis  in \nthe early 1990s crippled the country and forced the Government to enter into a large number of \npower  supply  contracts  with  independent  power  producers  (IPPs)  in  quick  succession.    Over \n2 years,  the  National  Power  Corporation  (NPC)1  entered  into  27  power  purchase  agreements \n(PPAs)  with  IPPs,  and,  by  1999,  IPPs  accounted  for  55%  of  total  installed  capacity  in  the \ncountry. These PPAs contain minimum offtake provisions, as well as fuel cost pass-through and \nforeign  exchange  adjustments.  The  obligations  of  NPC  under  these  PPAs  are  guaranteed  by \nthe national Government.  \n \n3. \nThe  additional  power  from  the  IPPs  came  online  just  when  the  Asian  financial  crisis \noccurred. Demand for power therefore did not grow as projected, resulting in an oversupply of \nelectricity in the country. Still, unit prices for electricity dispatched rose because of the minimum \nofftake provisions of the PPAs. As a result, the cost of electricity in the country today is among \nthe highest in Asia. The situation was complicated further by the substantial depreciation of the \nPhilippine  peso  during  the  same  period.  These  two  factors,  together  with  insufficient  tariff \nincreases, contributed to a decline in the financial health of NPC, which recorded a net profit of \nabout P3.1 billion ($74.6 million) in 1997 to a net loss of about P13.0 billion ($312.8 million) in \n20002 causing a strain on the financial resources of the Government.  \n \nAgainst this background, the Government decided to embark on market-oriented reforms \n4. \nand on 8 June 2001 signed into law the Energy Power Industry Reform Act (EPIRA, or Republic \nAct 9135). EPIRA was designed primarily to reduce public debt, improve efficiency in the sector, \nand encourage competition to bring down the cost of electricity. The main feature of the law was \nthe  privatization  of  the  generation  and  transmission  assets  of  NPC  under  the  management  of \nthe Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation (PSALM). EPIRA also created \na  wholesale  electricity  spot  market  (WESM)  and  advocated  competition  in  the  retail  supply  of \nelectricity.  \n \n5. \nPSALM\u2019s  power  plant  privatization  target  was  to  sell  70%  of  NPC\u2019s  eligible  capacity  in \nLuzon  and  Visayas  by  June  2004.  This  process  has  lagged  far  behind  target,  with  only  about \n11%  of  NPC\u2019s  eligible  capacity  in  Luzon  and  Visayas  turned  over  to  private  companies  by \nJuly 2007.  The  privatization  program  however  gained  momentum  in  2007  when  NPC \nsuccessfully auctioned off four power plants,3 though these plants have yet to achieve financial \nclosure. Appendix 2 gives an update on the privatization of NPC\u2019s power plants. \n                                                 \n1  NPC is a state-owned utility that was solely responsible for electricity generation and transmission in the Philippines \n\nuntil EPIRA was passed into law and implemented.  \n\n2  Woodhouse, Erik J. 2005. The IPP Experience in the Philippines. Stanford University. \n3  The power plants auctioned are Masinloc (600 MW), Calaca (600 MW), Ambuklao (75 MW), and Binga (100 MW). \n\n\f2 \n\n    \n\n \n6. \nPSALM offered the Calaca plant for sale by competitive bidding on 16 October 2007 and \ndrew  interest  from  three  bidders.4  Calaca  Holdco  Inc.  (which  later  became  EEC),  a \nspecial-purpose  company  wholly  owned  by  Suez-Tractebel  S.A.  (Suez)  through  its  subsidiary \nBelgelectric Finance B.V. (BFB), submitted the winning bid of $786.53 million.  \n \n7. \nSeveral  bidders  had  approached  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  financial \nsupport  for  their  plans  to  acquire,  refurbish,  and  operate  the  Calaca  plant.  After  the  bid  was \nawarded  to  EEC  and  Suez  Energy  International  (SEI)5  confirmed  its  request  for  financial \nassistance from ADB, the concept clearance paper was finalized and approved by Management \non 12 November 2007.  \n\nIII. \n\nBACKGROUND \n\nA. \n\nPhilippine Power Sector \n\n1. \n\nPower Situation in Luzon \n\n8. \nThe  Philippine  electrical  power  grid,  with  about  15,803  MW  of  installed  capacity,  is \ndivided  into  three:  Luzon  (Northern  Philippines),  Visayas  (Central  Philippines),  and  Mindanao \n(Southern Philippines). The Luzon grid, where the Calaca plant is located, is the largest of the \nthree  grids  and  accounts  for  about  76.5%  of  the  total  installed  capacity  nationwide  in  2006. \n(Refer to Table 1 for a profile of the Luzon grid.) A large portion of the load in the Luzon grid is \nin Metro Manila, while the generation sources are in the northern and southern parts of Luzon.  \n \n9. \nAt  present,  the  supply  of  electricity  throughout  Luzon  indicates  that  there  is  enough \nsupply  to  meet  demand,  with  a  dependable  capacity  of  10,466  MW  in  2006  against  an  actual \npeak demand of 6,466 MW and required capacity6 of 7,953 MW. However, from 26 June 2006 \nto  25 June  2007  only  about  two  thirds  of  the  dependable  capacity  was  offered  on  the  spot \nmarket.  With  few  exceptions,  the  offered  capacity  ranged  from  3,500  MW  to  7,400  MW.7  A \nreview of the hourly load during the first year of the spot-market operations, on the other hand, \nshowed demand ranging from 2,500 MW to about 6,500 MW, and averaging about 4,600 MW \ngiven  a  load  factor  of  72%.8  This  would  indicate  that  offered  capacities  approximate  the \ndemand.  \n \n10. \nThe supply of electricity in Luzon is vulnerable to the weather and other factors. Thinning \nwater reserves during the dry season make the capacity of hydropower plants unreliable. Power \nfrom  the  plants  at  this  time  typically  falls  to  about  one  fourth  of  dependable  capacity,  and  a \nprolonged dry season can temporarily shut down the plants. Power supply also depends on the \navailability and reliability of fuel. Fuel for coal- and oil-fired power plants, which together account \nfor  about  50%  of  the  dependable  capacity  in  Luzon,  is  imported  and  procured  on  the  spot \n\n                                                 \n4  The two other bidders were First Gen Corporation (Philippines) and AES Corporation (USA). \n5  SEI is a division of Suez-Tractebel. \n6  Required capacity refers to the peak demand plus the Energy Regulatory Commission\u2013approved reserve margin \nabove  the  peak  demand  of  23.4%,  consisting  of  2.8%  load  following  and  frequency  regulation,  10.3%  spinning \nreserve, and 10.3% back up.  \n\n7  Philippine Electricity Market Corporation. 2007. Annual Market Assessment Report for the Period 26 June 2006 to \n\n25 June 2007. Manila. \n\n8  Studies  indicate  that  the  load  factor,  which  is  the  ratio  of  average  demand  to  peak  demand  in  Luzon,  has \n\nconsistently been in the 72% range since 1991.  \n\n\f \n\n  3\n\nmarket  by  NPC.  The  recent  strong  global  demand  for  coal  and  oil,  and  NPC\u2019s  inadequate \ninventory  of  fuel,  has  occasionally  led  to  fuel  supply  shortages.  Another  key  factor  is  the \nuncoordinated  scheduling  of  plant  repair  and  maintenance,  since  many  of  the  plants  are \nseparately  owned.  Repair  and  maintenance  has  taken  power  plants  out  of  the  system  for \nweeks.  Finally,  because  of  their  overall  poor  condition,  many  NPC  plants  often  fail  or \nunexpectedly shut down.      \n \n\nTable 1: Installed and Dependable Capacity, by Fuel Source, in Luzon, 2006 \n \n\nInstalled Capacity \n\n  Dependable Capacity \n \n\n  Electricity Generation \n \n\nFuel Source \n\nCoal \nDiesel/Oil \nHydropower \nNatural Gas \nGeothermal \nNonconventional \n \n\nTotal \n\nMW \n3,769 \n2,333 \n2,247 \n2,763 \n954 \n25 \n12,091 \n\n% \n  31.2 \n  19.3 \n  18.6 \n  22.8 \n    7.9 \n    0.2 \n100.0 \n\nGWh = gigawatt-hour, MW = megawatt. \nNote: The figures may not add up because of rounding. \nSource: Department of Energy power statistics. \n\nMW \n3,287 \n1,928 \n1,813 \n2,703 \n726 \n9 \n10,466 \n\n% \n  31.4 \n  18.4 \n  17.3 \n  25.8 \n    7.0 \n    0.1 \n100.0 \n\nGWh \n14,099 \n1,711 \n5,492 \n16,366 \n3,520 \n53 \n41,241 \n\n% \n  34.2 \n    4.2 \n  13.3 \n  39.7 \n    8.5 \n    0.1 \n100.0 \n\n \n \n11. \nBy Department of Energy (DOE) estimates, energy consumption in Luzon will increase \nby  an  average  of  4.0%  yearly.  This  is  a  realistic  estimate,  given  the  4.9%  average  growth  in \ngross domestic product in 2002\u20132006 against a 3.4% annual growth in peak electricity demand. \nWith  two  major  power  plants  scheduled  for  retirement  in  2009\u201320109  and  only  38  MW  of \ncommitted projects under construction, DOE predicts a need for about 1,950 MW of additional \ngenerating  capacity  in  the  Luzon  grid  by  2014.  There  are  concerns  that  given  the  difficulty  in \nselling NPC assets, the addition of new capacity in a timely manner to replace decommissioned \npower  plants  would  even  be  more  challenging.  Moreover,  the  law  no  longer  provides  for  a \ndefault  producer  of  power  or  a  government  agency  that  could  contract  capacity  from  IPPs  to \nensure  a stable  supply  and  meet  expected  demand.  If  no  additional  capacity  is  created  in  the \nmeantime,10 the critical period in the Luzon grid will begin in 2011, when the reserve margin will \nfall below the required minimum level. About P71.0 billion ($1.7 billion) will be needed to finance \nthe additional capacity required in Luzon, according to DOE. \n\n2. \n\nIndustry Structure and Reforms \n\n12. \nThe signing of EPIRA in 2001 signaled a radical change in the Philippine power sector. \nThe significant provisions of the law include (i) the creation of PSALM to own and manage the \nprivatization  of  NPC  generation  and  transmission  assets,  (ii)  the  creation  of  the  Energy \nRegulatory Commission (ERC) with wide-ranging powers to regulate the behavior of participants \nin  the  industry,  (iii)  the  congressional  investigation  and  review  of  all  IPP  contracts,  (iv)  the \nunbundling of power rates, (v) the creation of WESM, and (vi) the development of competition in \nthe retail supply of electricity.   \n \n\n                                                 \n9  These are the Hopewell gas turbine power plant (100 MW of dependable capacity) and Malaya oil thermal power \n\nplant (650 MW of dependable capacity). \n\n10 The  country\u2019s  power  development  plan  assumes  that  roughly  1,750  MW  from  three  power  plants  will  be \ncommissioned  by  2009\u20132010.  But  none  of  the  plants  identified  (San  Gabriel,  Ilijan  gas-fired  expansion,  and \nGN Power coal-fired) have started construction.  \n\n\f4 \n\n    \n\nThe  EPIRA-mandated  restructuring  program  has  met  most  of  the  above  targets,  albeit \n13. \nmuch  later  than  originally  planned.  However,  until  recently,  no  significant  privatization  of  NPC \nassets has taken place (para. 5), while the implementation of a retail market remains uncertain \nsince key conditions precedent have yet to be realized.  \n \nPower  Sector  Assets  and  Liabilities  Management  Corporation.  PSALM  is  a \n14. \ngovernment  corporation  established  primarily \nimplement  EPIRA\u2019s  restructuring  and \nto \nprivatization  mandate.  EPIRA  requires  PSALM  to  take  ownership  of  all  NPC  assets  and \nliabilities.  In  carrying  out  its  mandate,  PSALM  will  inevitably  incur  substantial  losses  from  its \noperations  largely  because  of  the  excessive  debt  of  NPC,  take-or-pay  provisions  of  the  IPP \ncontracts,  and  insufficient  tariff  increases.  To  offset  these  costs,  PSALM  relies  heavily  on  the \nproceeds  of  the  sale  of  NPC  assets  (as  they  occur).  Other  future  revenue  sources  of  PSALM \nare the concession fees from the transmission grid concessionaire (as and when the franchise \nis  granted  to  the  winning  bidder,  para.  27)  and  the  proceeds  of  the  stranded  debt  and  costs \nlevied  on  electricity  consumers  (para. 34).  To  ease  the  financial  burden  of  PSALM,  the \nGovernment  assumed  P200  billion  in  debt  at  the  end  of  2004.  ERC  also  approved  a  tariff \nincrease in 2005. These measures turned PSALM\u2019s financial fortunes around, producing a net \nincome of P1,904 million ($45.8 million) in 2005 and P685 million ($16.5 million) in 2006.11 NPC \nalso  recorded  a  favorable  net  income  of  P86.0  billion  ($2.1  billion)  in  2005  and  P90.0  billion \n($2.2 billion) in 2006.12 \n \n15. \nBesides  overseeing  the  privatization  of  NPC  assets,  PSALM  is  tasked  to  review  and \nrenegotiate  the  IPP  contracts.  By  the  end  of  2004,  PSALM  had  substantially  renegotiated  the \nIPP contracts, saving up to $2.9 billion in the process. As the privatization of NPC assets and \nthe levy of stranded debt and costs progress further, PSALM should have enough revenues to \nfund all of its liabilities, which amounted to P60.6 billion ($1.5 billion) at the end of 2006, while \nalso helping reduce the liabilities of NPC, which amounted to P1,062 billion ($25.6 billion). \n \nUnless it is extended by law, PSALM has a corporate life of 25 years from the effectivity \n16. \ndate of EPIRA. Under EPIRA, all assets and liabilities of PSALM that are outstanding when its \nterm expires will be assumed by the Government.13   \n \nRegulation.  The  ERC  is  an  independent  quasi-judicial  regulatory  body  created  by \n17. \nEPIRA to replace the Energy Regulatory Board (ERB). It is mandated to promote competition, \nencourage market development, and penalize abuse of market power. Among its functions are: \n(i) establishing and enforcing a method of setting transmission and distribution wheeling rates, \n(ii) amending or revoking the authority of an industry participant to operate that fails to comply \nwith  EPIRA  or  any  order  of  the  ERC,  and  (iii) resolving  disputes  between  participants  in  the \nsector.  \n \nThe  ERC  also  reviews  and  must  approve  the  terms  and  conditions  of  most  industry \n18. \ncontracts where a regulated entity (i.e., a distribution utility [DU] or transmission operator) is a \ncounterparty. In particular, a generating company may sell power to any franchised DU through \na bilateral contract, provided ERC approves the transaction to ensure that the DU can recover \nits generation cost from its customers. The present role of ERC in setting rates and approving \nindustry  transactions  will,  however,  be  phased  out  with  the  operation  of  the  WESM,  open \n                                                 \n11 Commission on Audit, Republic of the Philippines.

Investors  will  be  particularly  concerned  with  the  regulator\u2019s \nindependence from political pressure, its technical experience, and the efficiency, transparency, \nand  consistency  of  review  and  decision  making.  To  address  these  concerns  and  move  the \nreform program forward, ADB has provided a loan16 and technical assistance17 to the Philippines \nto support ERC\u2019s ability to, among others, (i) respond efficiently and fairly to market issues, and \n(ii) communicate all regulatory matters clearly and effectively to the public and to stakeholders. \nThe continued involvement of ADB in the sector as lender and provider of technical assistance \nhelps ensure the stability of the regulatory regime. \n \n20. \nDistribution.  The  distribution  of  electricity  remains  a  regulated  activity  under  EPIRA. \nPower  is  distributed  through  DUs,  which  are  given  an  exclusive  franchise  to  operate  in  a \nparticular geographic area. There are now 136 DUs, of which 13 are private companies, 4 are \nowned  by  local  government  units,  and  119  are  customer-owned  electric  cooperatives.  The \nlargest DU is Manila Electric Company (Meralco), which holds the distribution franchise for 23 \ncities and 88 municipalities including Metro Manila. Its service area covers almost a quarter of \nthe Philippine population and produces about 50% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product. In \n2006, Meralco sold 25.1 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity,18 or about 60% of the power \ngenerated in Luzon. \n \n21. \nEPIRA  allows  generating  companies  to  sell  electricity  to  DUs,  or  to  retail  electricity \nsuppliers through bilateral contracts or the WESM. But no DU may source more than 50% of its \ntotal demand from an associated generating company through bilateral power supply contracts. \nPower purchase contracts entered into before EPIRA are exempted from this requirement. \n \nGeneration.  The  generation  of  electricity  will  not  be  regulated  by  ERC.  However,  to \n22. \nensure a competitive market, EPIRA requires that no one company, including its related entities, \nmay  own  more  than  30%  of  the  installed  generating  capacity  of  the  Luzon,  Visayas,  or \nMindanao  grid  or  25%  of  the  total  installed  generating  capacity  nationwide.  Generating \ncompanies in the country can be classified into four groups: (i) NPC-owned power plants, which \nare being privatized; (ii) NPC IPPs, which are privately owned power plants with long-term PPAs \nwith NPC; (iii) Meralco IPPs, which are power plants owned by the private sector and have long-\nterm PPAs with Meralco; and (iv) other IPPs, which comprise power plants purchased from NPC \nby the private sector. \n \n23. \nAt present, about 92.3% of the installed capacity in the country and 94.6% in Luzon is \nowned  or  controlled  collectively  by  NPC  or  PSALM  and  Meralco  (Table  2).  PSALM,  which  is \nresponsible for bidding the generation capacity of NPC IPPs on the WESM, has grouped these \n                                                 \n14 In general, generating companies may not sell power directly to industrial or commercial customers connected to \nthe network  of a DU until  open  access  and retail competition  is declared by ERC. However, about  114 industrial \ncustomers  have  been  allowed  to  source  power  directly  from  NPC.  No  regulatory  restriction  prohibits  other \ngenerating  companies  from  reaching  an  agreement  with  such  customers  once  these  customers\u2019  contracts  with \nNPC expire.  \n\n15  Once  retail  competition  is  implemented,  contestable  customers  will  initially  be  defined  as  end  users  with  an \n\naverage monthly peak demand of 1 MW.  \n\n16  ADB. 2006.

Each  trading  group  is  responsible \nfor  bidding  the  capacity  of  the  generation  assets  in  its  portfolio  to  achieve  maximum  dispatch \nand revenues. NPC, on the other hand, bids the capacity of its plants on the WESM separately.  \n \n\nTable 2: Installed Capacity, by Type of Generator, 2006 \n\nOwnership \n\nNPC \nNPC IPPs \nMeralco IPPs \nOther IPPs \nTotal \n\nPhilippines \n\nLuzon \n\n% \n26.4 \n51.3 \n14.6 \n7.7 \n100.0 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nMW \n2,469 \n6,669 \n2,304 \n649 \n12,091 \n\n% \n20.4 \n55.2 \n19.1 \n5.4 \n100.0 \n\nMW \n4,173 \n8,113 \n2,304 \n1,213 \n15,803 \n\nIPP  =  independent  power  producer,  Meralco  =  Manila  Electric  Company,  MW  =  megawatt,  NPC  = \nNational Power Corporation. \nNote: The figures may not add up because of rounding. \nSource: Department of Energy power statistics.  \n\n \n \n24.  With  assistance  from  ADB  and  the  World  Bank,  PSALM  is  undertaking  an  initiative  to \nappoint  IPP  administrators  (IPPAs)20  to  manage  the  contracted  capacity  of  NPC,  including \nbidding on the WESM and bilateral contracting. The IPPAs will operate independently of PSALM \nto minimize opportunities for collusion.  \n \n25. \nTransmission.  The  National  Transmission  Corporation  (TransCo)  was  established  in \n2001  as  a  limited-liability  corporation  wholly  owned  by  PSALM,  to  assume  the  electrical \ntransmission functions of NPC until privatization.  \n \n26. \nIn Luzon, TransCo operates a 500 kilovolt (kV) transmission backbone running north to \nsouth, which is designed to adequately transfer large amounts of power to Metro Manila. This \nsystem  is  running  well  and  is  unlikely  to  cause  constraints  in  the  foreseeable  future.  TransCo \nalso manages a 230 kV system that works in parallel with the 500 kV line. This 230 kV system \ndoes  have  transmission  constraints,  though  these  are  expected  to  be  addressed  by  the \ncompletion  of  the  expansion  projects  approved  under  the  current  transmission  development \nplan. Both systems are designed and operated at N\u2212121 contingency levels.   \n  \n27. \nEPIRA requires the privatization of the transmission assets of NPC. The structure of the \nprivatization  calls  for  a  concession  to  be  awarded  through  competitive  bidding,  granting  the \nwinning  bidder  the  exclusive  right  to  operate  the  transmission  systems  throughout  the \nPhilippines  for  25  years.  The  concessionaire  will  be  responsible  for  improving,  expanding, \noperating,  and  maintaining  the  transmission  system  and  will  be  entitled  to  receive  regulated \nwheeling  charges  for  its  services.  Legal  title  to  the  transmission  assets  will,  however,  remain \nwith TransCo. Bidding for the sale of the transmission assets of TransCo was held in December \n2007. Two bidders took part in the process and the concession was awarded to a consortium \nconsisting of the State Grid Corporation of the People\u2019s Republic of China and the Monte Oro \nGrid Resources Corporation, which submitted a bid price of $3.95 billion. The start date of the \n\n                                                 \n19 There were initially four trading teams but these were reduced to three in March 2007.  \n20 These are independent entities to be appointed by PSALM through competitive bidding. \n21 The N\u20131 rule states that during the outage of any single transmission element of the power system, the following \nconditions  shall  be  simultaneously  met:  (i)  no  transmission  elements  are  overloaded;  (ii)  bus  voltages  are  within \nallowable  limits;  (iii)  the  remaining  generators  stay  in  synchronism  after  a  disturbance;  and  (iv)  no  service \ninterruption of customers. \n\n\f \n\n  7\n\nconcession  will  be  subject  to,  among  others,  Congress\u2019  granting  a  franchise  to  the  winning \nbidder to carry out the concession. \n \n28.  Wholesale  Electricity  Spot  Market.  An  important  component  of  the  power  sector \nreform is the establishment of a market for electricity to encourage competition in the sector and \nreduce the cost of energy. The WESM, which started commercial operations in June 2006, is a \ngross-offer pool, net-settlements market, which enables the trading of electricity as a commodity \nin  24  one-hour  trading  periods  daily.  All  available  power  in  the  system,  including  contracted \ncapacity  under  bilateral  arrangements,  is  offered  on  the  market  and  will  be  dispatched  in  the \norder  of  their  bid  price,  with  the  market  clearing  at  the  price  set  by  the  highest  bidder  to  be \ndispatched.   \n\nEPIRA  permits  industry  players  to  enter  into  bilateral  contracts  for  a  fixed  price  and \n29. \nquantity of electricity. Such contracts will be structured as \u201ccontracts for differences\u201d rather than \ncontracts  for  electricity  supply.  Differences  between  the  market  clearing  price  and  the \ncontracted price will be settled by the contracting parties outside the WESM. Of the total volume \ntraded in July 2007, only about 16% was not contracted with bilateral parties. The rest was all \nsubject to bilateral contracts. EPIRA permits such arrangements but limits each DU to sourcing \nno  more  than  90%  of  its  power  requirements  from  bilateral  supply  contracts  during  the  first  5 \nyears of the WESM.  \n\nIn  the  first  year  of  commercial  operations  of  the  WESM,  the  weekly  spot  price  ranged \n30. \nfrom P0.00/kWh ($0.00/kWh) to P12.58/kWh ($0.30/kWh), for a median weekly average price of \nabout P4.27/kWh ($0.10/kWh).  \n \nOpen  Access  and  Retail  Competition.  A  key  objective  of  EPIRA  is  to  enable  retail \n31. \ncustomers to choose their electricity provider. To this end, qualified parties should be allowed to \nuse distribution lines provided they pay the wheeling rates approved by ERC. EPIRA, however, \nstates  that  open  access  and  retail  competition  can  be  declared  by  ERC  only  when  all  of  the \npreconditions have been met. Two of these preconditions\u2014(i) the privatization of at least 70% of \nthe  total  capacity  of  NPC  generation  assets  in  Luzon  and  Visayas,  and  (ii)  the  transfer  of  the \nmanagement  and  control  of  at  least  70%  of  the  total  energy  output  of  power  plants  under \ncontracts with NPC to IPPAs\u2014have yet to be achieved.22 If the momentum for the sale of NPC \nassets  continues,  then  the  privatization  condition  is  likely  to  be  achieved  by  2009.  The \nimplementation of the IPPAs, on the other hand, remains uncertain because of the complexity of \nthe  transaction.  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  are  providing  technical  assistance  to  facilitate  this \nprocess. In addition to the preconditions stipulated by law, ERC also requires the establishment \nof a customer switching system and pertinent regulations.  \n \n32. \nERC will announce the start of retail competition when all of the conditions referred to in \nthe  previous  paragraph  have  been  met.  Implementation  will  begin  6  months  after  the \nannouncement. At this time, it is unclear when all of the preconditions will be satisfied.23 Retail \ncompetition will be implemented in phases beginning with end users that have an average peak \ndemand of 1 MW. The second phase will cover single or aggregated loads of at least 750 kW. \nThereafter, the threshold will go down gradually until ultimately, households are given the right \nto choose their electricity provider. \n \n\n                                                 \n22  Amendments  to  EPIRA  are  now  being  considered  by  Congress.  These  amendments  will  lower  the  threshold  of \n\nopen access to the sale of 50% of NPC generation assets and the transfer of 50% of the IPP contracts. \n\n23 In August 2007, the President announced that open access would apply immediately within the boundaries of the \n\nspecial industrial zones, also referred to as economic zones. \n\n\f8 \n\n    \n\nUniversal  Charge.  A  component  of  the  electric  bill  levied  on  end  users  is  a  universal \n33. \ncharge  collected  for  specific  purposes  including  missionary  electrification,  environmental \ncharges, payment of NPC\u2019s stranded debt and costs, and payment of DUs\u2019 stranded costs. This \ncharge  is  collected  by  DUs  as  a  pass-through  charge.  At  present,  only  the  missionary \nelectrification24 and environmental components are collected by the DUs.  \n \n34. \nStranded Debt and Costs. EPIRA permits NPC, PSALM, and DUs to recover through a \nuniversal charge those costs associated with their take-or-pay contracts that were approved by \nERB as of 31 December 2000.25 These costs take two forms: stranded debt and stranded costs. \nStranded  debt  refers  to  unpaid  obligations  of  NPC,  while  stranded  cost  is  the  difference \nbetween the NPC-contracted purchase price and the actual price at which electricity was sold. \nThe  amount  of  stranded  debt  and  costs  that  NPC  or  PSALM  would  seek  to  recover  would \ndepend on several factors including the proceeds from the privatization program. The imposition \nof the stranded cost charges on customers within the universal charge, and the period of such \nimposition, will require ERC approval. \n\nB. \n\nADB Operations \n\n1. \n\nCountry Strategy \n\nADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  (CSP)  for  the  Philippines26  lists  fiscal  imbalance, \n35. \npoor  investment  climate,  and  weak  governance  as  the  country\u2019s  three  most  critical  binding \ndevelopment constraints.  The CSP developed a set of targeted sector policy reform packages, \neach of which is expected to have a direct impact on at least one of these constraints. The three \nreform areas are power, financial markets, and governance.27 Improving the investment climate \nis  a  focus  of  all  proposed  program  lending  operations,  and  infrastructure  weaknesses  have \nbeen repeatedly identified by business as a key obstacle to investment in the Philippines. The \nfiscal \nPower  Sector  Development  Program  (PSDP)  (footnote  16)  will  directly  affect \nconsolidation28 by reducing the losses at NPC, making PSALM and the energy companies more \ncreditworthy,  and  creating  conditions  for  the  privatization  of  major  power  assets.  The  CSP \nadvocates  more  cooperation  between  ADB\u2019s  public  and  private  sector  operations to  boost  the \nconfidence  of  investors  and  promote  private  investment  to  offset  fiscally  constrained  public \ninvestment. PSDP support for a well-regulated, privatized power sector, together with financial \ninvestments, will increase investor interest.  \n\n                                                 \n24  Missionary  electrification  includes  the  provision  of  electricity  either  to  an  EC  whose  distribution  network  is  not \nconnected  to  the  main  grid  or  to  unelectrified  barangays  that  are  not  served  by  an  EC  because  it  would  be \nuneconomical to do so. \n\n25 R.A. 9136 Electricity Power Industry Reform Act of 2001.

Manila. \n\n27 To further support the Government\u2019s efforts to improve the fiscal situation and to broaden the reform program, ADB \nis  providing  a  program  cluster  covering  reforms  in  fiscal  policy,  governance  in  public  financial  management,  the \ninvestment  climate,  and  social  inclusion.  The  first  subprogram  in  the  cluster  was  approved  on  8  February  2007 \n(ADB. 2007. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Program Cluster \nLoan  and  Technical  Assistance  Grant  to  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines  for  the  Development  Policy  Support \nProgram. Manila). The second subprogram is expected to be processed in early 2008. \n\n28 Other  policy-based  operations  are:  the  Local  Government  Finance  and  Budget  Reform  Program,  the  Financial \nMarkets and Intermediation Program, the Microfinance Development Program, and the Justice Reform Program.  \n\n\f \n\n  9\n\n2. \n\nEnergy Sector Strategy \n\nADB\u2019s  energy  sector  strategy29  defines  ADB\u2019s  operational  priorities  as  (i)  reducing \n36. \npoverty  by  creating  an  energy  infrastructure  for  sustainable  economic  growth,  (ii)  promoting \nprivate  sector  involvement  by  restructuring  the  energy  sector  and  creating  an  enabling \nenvironment for private investors, (iii) addressing regional and global environmental impact, and \n(iv)  promoting  regional  cooperation.  In  particular,  the  strategy  strongly  advocates  ADB \ninterventions  to  increase  private  sector  participation  in  the energy  sector  to  take  advantage  of \nthe  higher  operating  efficiencies  of  private  operators  and  to  respond  to  the  large  capital \nrequirements  of  power  projects.  The  strategy  also  supports  market  liberalization  and  the \nscrapping of subsidies.  \n\n3. \n\nThe Project\u2019s Consistency with Asian Development Bank Strategies \n\n37. \nThe Project is fully in line with ADB\u2019s country and energy sector strategies. It will directly \ncontribute  to  achieving  the  PSDP  objective  of  correcting  the  country\u2019s  fiscal  imbalance  by \ncatalyzing  the  privatization  of  an  NPC-owned  power  plant  and  earning  sales  revenues  for  the \nGovernment.  The  Project  will  also  help  improve  the  investment  climate  by  increasing  the \nreliability  of  generating  capacity  for  commercial  and  industrial  centers.  The  successful \nacquisition  and  operation  of  the  Calaca  plant  by  a  reputable  foreign  entity  will  boost  market \nconfidence and encourage the further privatization of NPC assets and the entry of new players \ninto the market. The Project will enhance competition in the generator market and, in the long \nrun, help drive down the price of electricity.  \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nProject Description \n\n1. \n\nCurrent Status \n\n38. \nThe  Calaca  plant  is  a  nominal  600  MW  base-load  pulverized  coal\u2013fired  power  plant. \nEach of its two generating units has a gross rated capacity of 300 MW. Unit 1 is equipped with a \nFoster  Wheeler  coal-fired,  subcritical,  natural-circulation,  reheat  boiler  designed  to  operate  on \nhigh-quality coal. Unit 2 is equipped with an ABB Combustion Engineering coal-fired, subcritical, \nforced-circulation, reheat boiler designed to operate on lower-quality coal of the type that may \nbe sourced within the Philippines.  \n \n39. \nUnit  1  was  built  at  a  total  cost  of  $238.50  million  and  was  commissioned  on \n11 September 1984. The Export-Import Bank of Japan provided funding for its construction. The \nPhilippine  Government  later  sought  Japanese  Government  financing  for  the  construction  of \nunit 2  through  official  development  assistance.  Unit  2  was  completed  at  a  total  project  cost  of \n$351.67  million  and  began  commercial  operations  on  5 July  1995.  The  design  of  the  Calaca \nplant is conventional and typical of modern coal-fired power plants. The plant was originally built \nto a reasonably high standard, with the use of world-class technology. NPC has managed and \noperated the Calaca plant since the start of commercial operations of unit 1 in 1984.  \n \nThe  plant  is  currently  operating  under  poor  conditions:  its  availability  and  reliability \n40. \nstatistics are well below those expected from a plant of this fuel type, technology, size, and age. \n\n                                                 \n29 ADB. 2000. Energy 2000: Review of the Energy Policy of the Asian Development Bank. Manila. \n\n\f10 \n\n    \n\nBoth units of the Calaca plant have been operating with load restrictions for a significant period \nof  each  year  for  various  operational  reasons.  In  2002\u20132006,  unit  1  had  an  average  forced \noutage  rate  of  17.2%,  and  unit  2,  14.4%.  Similar  plants  in  North  America  have  an  average \nequivalent availability factor of 84.1% and a forced outage rate of 4.8%. Appendix 3 gives the \noperating statistics for the Calaca plant from 2002 to 2006. \n \n41. \nThe  due  diligence  done  by  various  experts  suggests  that  the  plant  can  recover  its \nperformance  and  reliability  and  could  operate  for  another  20  years  if  the  appropriate \nrefurbishment program is implemented and suitable operating and maintenance standards are \napplied.  Its  poor  condition  is  attributable  not  to  the  original  design  of  the  plant  but  to  poor \nmanagement, inadequate maintenance, and insufficient stocking of spare parts on-site. The use \nof coal that does not conform to boiler specifications has also impaired its performance.  \n\n2. \n\nRefurbishment and Operation Plan \n\n42. \nThe  objective  of  EEC\u2019s  proposed  refurbishment  plan  is  to  return  both  units  to  their \noriginal  design  condition  and  capacity.  Once  the  refurbishment  is  completed,  the  plant  is \nexpected  to  achieve  a  gross  output  of  600  MW.  The  plant  would  then  be  in  a  position  to \ncompete directly with other coal-fired power plants and new entrants since EEC would operate \nthe plant to global standards. \n \n43. \nSEI will also introduce a new management system to improve the efficiency of the plant \nand increase the productivity of the workers. The new system will also improve the health and \nsafety  standards  at  the  plant  to  a  level  that  would  be  consistent  with  industry  best  practices \nworldwide. An experienced Suez team will oversee the implementation of these practices at the \npower plant through training, mentorship, and day-to-day interaction.  \n\nB. \n\nSponsor \n\n30\n\nAlthough formed only in 1997 through a merger, the founding companies\n\n44. \n of Suez have \na 150-year history of providing natural gas, electricity, and water services in Europe and around \nthe world. Suez is considered one of the largest power companies in the world, with a portfolio \nof 60,000 MW of installed power production capacity at the end of 2006. In addition to being the \nfifth-largest  electricity  provider  in  Europe,  Suez  is  also  the  leading  private  power  generator  in \nBrazil and Thailand and the leading private developer in terms of installed power capacity in the \nGulf countries. Suez, with a Moody\u2019s issuer rating of A2 and an S&P LT issuer credit of A\u2013, had \n\u20ac44.3 billion in revenues and net income of \u20ac3.6 billion in 2006. Consolidated assets stood at \n\u20ac73.4 billion and consolidated shareholder\u2019s equity at \u20ac19.5 billion at the end of 2006. Suez is \nlisted on the Brussels, Luxembourg, Paris, New York, and Zurich stock exchanges. \n \nAs one of the major energy producers on the deregulated European markets, the Suez \n45. \ngroup  has  developed  significant  expertise  in  managing  merchant  plants.  Through  its \nsubsidiaries,  Suez  manages  almost  50  merchant  power  plants  across  the  world,  representing \nan installed capacity of 24,404 MW, or 40% of the group\u2019s total capacities. See Appendix 4 for a \nlist of merchant power plants owned and operated by Suez globally. \n \n\n                                                 \n30 Suez traces its history to the following companies: (i) Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Belgique, founded in 1822 in Belgium; \n(ii) Compagnie Universelle du Canal Maritime de Suez, founded in 1858 in France; (ii) Compagnie Lyonnaise des \nEaux et de l\u2019Eclairage, founded in 1880 in France; and (iv) Tractebel, founded in 1895 in Belgium. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n  11\n\nSEI  is  the  business  line  of  Suez  responsible  for  the  group\u2019s  energy  activities  outside \n46. \nEurope. It manages over 27,000 MW of installed generating capacity in 18 countries out of the \n60,000  MW  global  portfolio  of  Suez.  The  fleet  of  power  plants  owned  or  managed  by  SEI \nincludes  12 coal-fired  power  plants  in  six  countries  with  a  net  installed  capacity  of  2,309  MW. \nApart from power generation, SEI also transports and distributes natural gas. In 2006, SEI sold \n109.9 million megawatt-hours of electricity and 13.61 billion cubic meters of natural gas to more \nthan  one  million  customers,  generating  revenues  of  \u20ac6.2  billion,  or  about  14%  of  the  total \nrevenues of Suez that year.   \n \n47.  When SEI started operations in 1988\u20131989, its power projects were linked to long-term \nPPAs.  With  the  gradual  deregulation  of  energy  markets  worldwide,  SEI  moved  from  being  a \npure  developer  and  operator  of  assets  to  an  asset-based  organization  that  markets  a  wide \nrange  of  products  and  services.  In  North  America,  Suez  Energy  Marketing  N.A.  trades  all  the \npower generated by the fleet of merchant power plants of SEI. Today, SEI manages a portfolio \nof  nine  merchant  power  plants  with  a  combined  installed  capacity  of  4,219  MW  out  of  its \nportfolio of 27,000 MW.   \n\nC. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n48. \nThe  terms  of  acquisition  of  the  Calaca  power  plant  and  its  related  land  rights  are \nestablished under two key transaction documents: (i) the asset purchase agreement, and (ii) the \nland lease agreement. \n\n1. \n\nAsset Purchase Agreement \n\n49. \nAn asset purchase agreement (APA) was signed by the bidder and submitted by EEC as \npart of its bid. Since the bid date, the APA has also been signed by PSALM. The APA requires \nEEC to pay at least 40% of the purchase price up front in order for it to take possession of the \nCalaca plant and have the right to operate it. EEC must pay the balance in equal semiannual \ninstallments over a 7-year period. Until full payment is made, PSALM will remain the owner of \nthe plant.   \n   \nThe APA may be terminated by either party by reason of default by the other. A PSALM \n50. \ndefault includes its failure to obtain transferable rights to the foreshore lands within 7 years from \nthe closing date. EEC has numerous obligations, which, if breached, would give rise to an EEC \ndefault.  These  include  (i)  paying  PSALM  the  amounts  that  are  due,  when  they  are  due;  (ii) \ndischarging  all  the  rights,  liabilities,  and  obligations  of  PSALM  under  contracts  that  remain  in \neffect after the acquisition date; and (iii) paying taxes, fees, and penalties.  \n\n2. \n\nLand Lease Agreement \n\n51. \nThe  project  occupies  an  area  of  about  2.1  million  square  meters  comprising  onshore \nland, foreshore land, and submerged land. EEC will lease the onshore land from PSALM for 25 \nyears under a land lease agreement (LLA) dated 16 October 2007. The agreement also gives \nEEC  or  its  affiliate  the  option  to  acquire  the  leased  land,  subject  to  its  meeting  Philippine \nqualification requirements for land ownership.31  \n\n                                                 \n31 Philippine regulations allow only Filipino citizens and corporations or partnerships where at least 60% of the shares \n\nare owned by Filipinos, to own or acquire land. \n\n\f12 \n\n    \n\n3. \n\nPower Supply Contracts \n\n52. \nThe supply rights to 11 existing power supply contracts (PSCs) will be assigned to EEC \nalong  with  the  assets  of  the  Calaca  plant.  The  total  contracted  capacity  from  these  PSCs \nrepresents about 40% of the plant\u2019s rated capacity. Most of the PSCs will expire within the first \n4 years after turnover to EEC.  \n\n53. \nCoal  is  sourced  almost  exclusively  from  Semirara  Coal  Corporation  under  a  long-term \nsupply arrangement. High-quality coal required for blending is procured by NPC for the Calaca \nplant through spot contracts. EEC will coordinate its procurement of coal through Suez regional \noffice in Thailand.  \n\n4. \n\nCoal Supply \n\n5. \n\nTransmission \n\nThe output of the Calaca plant is transmitted through the 230 kV transmission system. \n54. \nUnlike transmission lines in the northern transmission corridor, each 230 kV transmission line in \nthe  south  serves  a  particular  generation  subgroup.  The  Calaca  plant  belongs  to  the  group  1 \ngenerators,  which  also  include  the  Sta.  Rita  and  San  Lorenzo  power  plants.32  The  group  1 \ngenerators  are  linked  to  Manila  through  the  Calaca\u2013Dasmari\u00f1as\u2013Zapote  and  Calaca\u2013Bi\u00f1an\u2013\nSucat 230 kV lines.  \n \n55. \nTransCo  has  identified  two  transmission  upgrades  to  allow  full  dispatch  of  the  South \nLuzon generators. These upgrades are referred to as the Batangas transmission reinforcement \nproject  (BTRP)  and  the  Bi\u00f1an\u2013Sucat  230  kV  transmission  line.  Work  on  the  BTRP  is  ongoing \nand is expected to be completed by November 2008.33 The objective of the Bi\u00f1an\u2013Sucat 230 kV \nline  project  is  to  increase  the  transfer  capacity  of  the  existing  Bi\u00f1an\u2013Sucat  lines  that  would \nprovide  for  N\u22121  during  full  dispatch  of  the  generating  plants  in  South  Luzon.  Work  on  this \nproject  has  been  delayed  largely  by  rights-of-way  issues,  which  have  substantially  been \nresolved  recently.  TransCo  does  not  anticipate  any  further  lengthy  delays  and  targets \ncompletion date for the Bi\u00f1an\u2013Sucat project by 2010.    \n\nD. \n\nEnvironmental Aspects and Social Dimensions \n\n56. \nThe  Project  is  located  along  the  shoreline  of  Barangay  San  Rafael,  Calaca,  in  the \nprovince  of Batangas,  about  115  kilometers  south  of  Manila.  It  is  bounded  to  the north  by  the \nCalaca\u2013Balayan National Highway, to the east by the Cawong (Bolboc) River, to the west by the \nDacanlao River, and to the south by Balayan Bay.  \n\n1. \n\nEnvironment \n\n57. \nThe Project is classified as environmental category B under ADB\u2019s  Environment Policy \n(2002). An initial environmental examination (IEE) has been conducted and the summary IEE is \navailable  at  the  ADB  website.  The  Project  involves  the  refurbishment  of  an  existing  coal-fired \nthermal  power  station  with  no  capacity  expansion  under  the  project  financing  plan;  all \n\n                                                 \n32  The  Sta.  Rita  and  San  Lorenzo  plants  are  combined-cycle  gas  thermal  power  plants  owned  by  First  Gen,  an \naffiliate of Meralco. Power from both these plants is transmitted to the Calaca switchyard through 230 kV lines.  \n33  ADB  provided  a  loan  to  finance  the  transmission  line  from  Calamba  to  Sucat  under  ADB.  1997.  Report  and \nRecommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the Republic of the Philippines \nfor the Power Tansmission Reinforcement Project. Manila (Loan 1590-PHI). \n\n\f \n\n  13\n\nmodifications  will  be  confined  to  the  current  site.  The  Project  is  expected  to  bring  about  local \nand environmental benefits, including overall air quality improvements with substantial reduction \nin  carbon  dioxide  emissions  per  unit  of  electricity  generated.  EEC  will  target  to  meet  the \nenvironmental standards laid out by the World Bank.34  \n \n58. \nThe  plant  has  been  issued  the  required  environmental  clearances  and  environmental \npermits to operate since 1987.35 The Project is expected to improve the  overall environmental \nperformance  of  the  plant  by  (i)  repairing  and  maintaining  (a) electrostatic  precipitators,  (b)  the \ncontinuous  emission  monitoring  system,  (c)  ambient  monitoring  stations,  and  (d)  the  fugitive \ndust  control  system;  (ii)  rehabilitating  the  wastewater  collection  and  treatment  system;  (iii) \nconducting  soil  and  groundwater  investigation;  (iv) reviewing  and  updating  environmental \nmonitoring  arrangements;  (v)  developing  management  plans  for  asbestos-containing  materials \nand  other  wastes;  and  (v)  introducing  a  formal  environmental  health  and  safety  management \nsystem.  The  ongoing  public  consultation  and  stakeholder  engagement  program36  will  continue \nand  will  be  strengthened  as  required  under  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications  Policy  (2005).  A \ndetailed  environmental,  health,  and  safety  (EHS)  compliance  audit  of  the  facility  will  be \nconducted  yearly.  ADB  will  review  the  semiannual  environmental  monitoring  report  and  the \nannual EHS audit report.  \n\n2. \n\nSocial Aspects \n\n59. \nThe  Project  is  classified  as  category  C  with  respect  to  involuntary  resettlement  and \nimpact on indigenous peoples. It will not involve any additional land acquisition, change in land \nuse, or access restriction. The plant site is fenced with no informal settlers on the property. \n \n60. \nInvoluntary  Resettlement.  When  land  was  acquired  for  the  plant  27  years  ago,  361 \nfamilies  in  barangays  San  Rafael,  Comastilisan,  Quisumbing,  and  Pantai  had  to  be  relocated. \nEach affected household was given a plot of land in a resettlement site, disturbance payment, \nand  compensation  for  land.  All  private  land  acquired  for  the  use  of  the  power  plant  itself  is \ncovered by deeds of absolute sale, and there are no pending issues, legal or otherwise, related \nto compensation for land included in the leased premises.  \n \nIn addition to compensation payments and a plot of land in a resettlement site, NPC also \n61. \nprovided  employment  opportunities  to  resettlers  and  implemented  development  and  livelihood \nprojects, electrification projects, and activities in reforestation, watershed management, health, \nand  environmental  improvement  as  required  under  Energy  Regulation  1-94.37  Current \ncommunity development activities include cattle fattening, road improvements, canal lining, and \n\n                                                 \n34  The  target  standard  for  particulates  is  100  milligrams  per  normal  cubic  meter  (mg/Nm3),  more  stringent  than  the \nnational standard of 200 mg/Nm3. For oxides of nitrogen, the plant will comply with 750 mg/Nm3, while standards \nfor  sulfur  dioxide  will  be  1,500  mg/Nm3.  More  stringent  effluent  discharge  standards  will  also  be  targeted:  50 \nmilligrams per liter (mg/L) for total suspended solids, following the World Bank\u2019s guidelines, compared with national \nstandards of 200 mg/L; 0.003\u20130.5 mg/L for metals against 0.5\u20131 mg/L; 10 mg/L for oil and grease against 15 mg/L.     \n\n35 Environmental compliance certificates (ECCs) were issued on 21 April 1987 for unit 1 and on 24 April 1992 for unit \n2.  Official  notification  of  sale  or  transfer  to  amend  the  ECCs  will  be  required.  Environmental  permits  need  to  be \nobtained and renewed periodically. The plant is renewing its effluent discharge permit. \n\n36  The  Multipartite  Monitoring  Team  (MMT)  in  the  original  stakeholder  engagement  program,  comprises  staff  from \nlocal  government  units,  nongovernment  organizations,  and  people\u2019s  organizations,  and \n\nNPC,  DENR, \nrepresentatives from the private and public sectors. \n\n37 Energy Regulation 1-94 requires that generation facilities owned by NPC transferred to PSALM and later privatized \nmust  provide  a  P0.01/kWh  financial  benefit  to  host  communities,  including  resettlement  areas.  In  addition, \nP0.0025/kWh  of  the  total  electricity  sales  will  be  allocated  to  the  Development  and  Livelihood  Fund  for  the \nresettlement area. \n\n\f14 \n\n    \n\nIndigenous  Peoples.  The  municipalities  of  Calaca  and  Balayan  are  semi-urban,  and \n\nthe construction of seawalls, culverts, multipurpose halls, schools, water tanks, health centers, \nand  artificial  reefs.  After  the  turnover,  EEC  intends  to  engage  in  discussions  with  the  local \ngovernment  unit  to  identify  community  projects  or  initiatives  that  would  be  most  effective  in \ndelivering a better quality of life to the people of Calaca and other communities around the plant.  \n \n62. \nthere are no indigenous peoples in the project area. \n \nLabor and Workplace Conditions at the Calaca Plant. All of the NPC employees were \n63. \nterminated  by  NPC  in  February  2003  and  were  paid  severance  payments.  Those  that  were \nrehired by  NPC, TransCo, and PSALM  were taken on as new government service employees \nwith  the  clear  understanding  that  upon  privatization  they  would  be  given  due  notice  and  a \nin  accordance  with \nseverance  payment  before \ngovernment civil service rules and regulations and national labor standards.38  \n \n64. \nCurrently,  the  plant  has  288  budgeted  positions.  As  provided  for  in  the  APA,  EEC  will \noffer  all  plant  personnel  a  contract  for  5  months.  During  this  period,  their  competence  and \nqualifications  will  be  assessed  and  skills  mixes  identified  according  to the  requirements  of  the \nnew operational structure. Job classifications will be set, and training opportunities will also be \nidentified. With labor consultations and an objective personnel evaluation system, it is expected \nthat  the  labor  rationalization  process  will  be  nondiscriminatory  and  acceptable  to  ADB  as \ncompliant with recognized labor conventions.  \n\ntermination.  These  arrangements  are \n\nE. \n\nDevelopment Impact39 \n\n65. \nThe Project would help advance the economic development of the country by promoting \nthe  power  sector  reforms  of  the  Government.  It  would  earn  revenues  for  the  Government  to \nease  its  fiscal  imbalance,  and  would  also  provide  reliable  and  efficient  power  supply  in  the \ncountry. Progress in the reform of the power sector would encourage further investments in the \nsector  at  the  appropriate  time.  It  would  also  introduce  competition  into  the  sector  and  would \nthereby  bring  down  the  costs  of  electricity  over  time.  The  acquisition,  refurbishment,  and \noperation of the Calaca plant by a large and experienced global energy provider would result in \nthe plant achieving operating efficiencies that are consistent with global industry best practices. \nThis would also result in more environmentally sound power generation.   \n\nF. \n\nEconomic Evaluation \n\n \n\n66. \nThe economic analysis of the Project was carried out according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nthe Economic Analysis of Projects (1997). The Project is expected to provide a net benefit to the \neconomy  by  reducing  national  debt,  replacing  current  generation  with  more  efficient  and \nenvironmentally  sound  generation,  adding  new  generation  capacity,  and  making  the  sector \nmore  competitive  overall,  thereby  lowering  electricity  tariffs  in  the  long  run.  The  reduction  in \nnational  debt  is  assumed  to  be  the difference  between  EEC\u2019s  payment  for  the  assets  and  the \ndepreciated economic value of the assets, adjusted for financing for the Project from domestic \nsources. Part of the electricity output from the Project will replace electricity already generated \n\n                                                 \n38 Labor standards are set under the Philippine Labor Code (Presidential Decree 442 as amended, 1 May 1974). \n39 The  development  effectiveness  of  the  Project  will  be  assessed  in  terms  of  private  sector  development,  business \nsuccess,  and  economic  sustainability,  according  to  the  guidelines  for  implementing  the  Good  Practice  Standards \nfor  Evaluation  of  Private  Sector  Investment  Operations  prepared  by  the  Evaluation  Cooperation  Group  of \nmultilateral development banks. \n\n\f \n\n  15\n\nby  Calaca  (the  non-incremental  portion),  but  the  electricity  will  be  generated  more  efficiently. \nThe  remaining  output  will  be  new  generation  stemming  from  the  implementation  of  EEC\u2019s \nrefurbishment plan (the incremental portion). The benefit for the non-incremental portion is the \nopportunity cost the economy \u201csaves\u201d by not having to use more expensive electricity generated \nby  less  efficient  plants.  For  the  incremental  portion,  the  benefit  is  calculated  by  valuing  the \nadditional electricity output from the Project at the projected WESM spot price. This market price \nreflects  the  consumers\u2019  willingness  to  pay  for  additional  electricity,  and,  hence,  is  a  good \napproximation  of  the  benefit  to  the  economy  of  Calaca\u2019s  added  electricity  generation. \nEnvironmental benefits are also expected from the Project, but these were not quantified in the \nanalysis. \n \n67. \nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  under  the  ADB  base  case  was  estimated  at \n39.6%\u2014above  the  social  discount  rate  of  12.0%.  Sensitivity  testing  against  four  adverse \nscenarios demonstrates that the Project is economically robust and viable.  \n\nV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nADB Loan \n\nThe  proposed  ADB  assistance  consists  of  a  direct  loan  of  up  to  $120  million  to  EEC, \n68. \nwithout  a  government  guarantee,  and  a  PRG  of  up  to  $90  million.  The  direct  loan  will  be \nprovided from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. Part of the loan, may be converted into peso, at \nthe option of EEC to minimize the Project\u2019s exposure to foreign exchange risk.   \n \n69. \nThe  loan  will  be  documented  in  a  loan  agreement,  which  will  be  subject  to  conditions \nprecedent  to  the  disbursement,  including  all  necessary  government,  creditor,  and  shareholder \napprovals  and  consents,  and  all  contractual  and  financial  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB. \nThe loan agreement will include appropriate covenants, representation, and warranties, as well \nas events of default.  \n\nB. \n\nADB Political Risk Guarantee \n\n70. \nThe  PRG  will  be  issued  by  ADB  in  favor  of  the  sponsor  or  one  of  its  affiliates  (PRG \nbeneficiary). ADB\u2019s obligation to make payment under the PRG will arise if a political risk causes a \nloss of revenue to the Calaca Power Project and such loss results in EEC\u2019s failure to service its \nobligations  under  the  subordinated  loans.  These  loans,  made  by  commercial  banks,  will  be \nguaranteed by the PRG beneficiary under a comprehensive guarantee. The ADB guarantee will \ncover (i) transfer restriction, (ii) expropriation, (iii) political violence, and (iv) contract disputes.  \n\nC. \n\nJustification  \n\n71. \n\nThe Project merits ADB support for the following reasons:  \n\n(i) \n\nIt will further the privatization efforts of the Government to promote competition and \nefficiency in the power sector and to put the sector on a sounder financial footing. It \nwill  bring  the  percentage  of  NPC\u2019s  privatized  eligible  assets  to  almost  40%. \nProceeds  from  the  sale  of  the  Calaca  plant  will  be  used  to  reduce  PSALM  and \nNPC debt. \n\n(ii) \n\nThe Project will increase the electricity supply, improve the operating efficiency of \nthe  plant,  bring  about  environmental  benefits  including  air quality  improvements \n\n\f16 \n\n    \n\n(iii) \n\nand  bring  the  plant\u2019s  health  and  safety  standards  up  to  global  standards.  The \nCalaca  plant \ninefficiently,  and  violating \nenvironmental, health, and safety standards. \n\nis  now  underutilized,  operating \n\nThe Project will embody ADB\u2019s country and energy strategies, which emphasize \nsupport for energy infrastructure development with private sector participation. It \nwill  support  ADB\u2019s  thematic  priorities  of  economic  development,  private  sector \ndevelopment,  good  governance,  and  environmental  protection,  and  will  directly \ncomplement  the  Philippines\u2019  Power  Sector  Development  Program  (para.  35)  by \ncatalyzing  the  privatization  of  an  NPC-owned  power  plant  and  earning  sales \nrevenues for the Government. The Project will also help improve the investment \nclimate  by  increasing  the  reliability  of  generating  capacity  for  the  economic \ncenter.  Successful  acquisition  and  operation  of  the  plant  by  a  reputed  foreign \nprivate sector will boost market confidence and induce more foreign investment.  \n\n(iv) \n\nADB\u2019s involvement in the Project will catalyze long-term private sector equity and \ndebt  by  offering  protection  against  political  uncertainties,  including  the  risk  that \nPSALM will breach its contractual obligations, regulatory risks, and the risk that \nthe Government will fail to complete its sector reform program.  \n\nD. \n\nAnticorruption Measures and Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of \nTerrorism \n\n72. \nEEC was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and policy \nrelating  to  the  Combating  of  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism  (2003). \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will \nrequire  EEC  to  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with  internal  procedures  and  controls  following \ninternational best-practice standards to prevent corruption or money laundering activities or the \nfinancing  of  terrorism,  and  to  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from  engaging  in  such  activities. \nSuch  obligations  will  be  contained  in  ADB  loan  and  guarantee  documentation.  The  financing \ndocumentation  between  ADB  and  EEC  will,  further,  allow  ADB  to  investigate  any  violation  or \npotential violation of these undertakings. \n\nVI. \n\nINVESTMENT LIMITATIONS \n\nThe proposed direct loan and PRG for the Project will, once approved, increase ADB's \n73. \ngroup  exposure  to  the  Suez  group  to  $260  million,  and  its  total  nonsovereign  exposure  to  the \nPhilippines to 11.17% and that to the conventional energy generation subsector to 20.39%. The \nproposed  financing  is  within  ADB\u2019s  aggregate  country,  industry,  group,  and  single-exposure \nlimits for nonsovereign investments.  \n\nVII.  ASSURANCES \n\n74. \nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed assistance to \nEEC.  No  funding  will  be  disbursed  until  ADB  receives  such  confirmation.  ADB  will  enter  into \nsuitable  loan  and  guarantee  documentation,  in  form  and  substance  satisfactory  to  ADB, \nfollowing the approval of the proposed financing by the Board of Directors. \n\n\f \n\n  17\n\nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n\n75. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan and political risk guarantee would comply with the \nArticles  of  Agreement  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove \n\n(i)  \n\n(ii)  \n\na  loan  of  up  to  $120,000,000  to  Emerald  Energy  Corporation  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources;

In  determining  the  level  of \nprivatization  for  open  access  and  retail  competition,  however,  only  475.4  MW  of  the  already \nprivatized  assets  are  considered.  This  would  represent  only  10.96%  of  the  4,335.7  MW  of  total \noperating  capacity  in  Luzon  and  Visayas.  Almost  all  of  the  plants  were  purchased  by  wholly \nowned Filipino companies, except for Magat, which was purchased by a consortium consisting of \nFilipinos  and  Norwegians.  Refer  to  Table  A2.1  for  a  list  of  generations  assets  auctioned  by \nPSALM. \n\nIn addition to the eight power plants already privatized, bidding for four other power plants \n2. \nwas  successfully  concluded  in  2007  and  is  now  in  various  stages  of  financial  closure.  The \ncombined  bid  price  of  these  power  plants  is  $2,041.5  million.  The  successful  turnover  of  these \npower  plants,  expected  to  take  place  in  2008,  will  bring  the  total  number  of  installed  capacity \nprivatized  to  1,855.5  MW,  though  only  1,850.4  MW,  representing  about  42.7%  of  the  operating \ncapacity  in  Luzon  and  Visayas,  would  be  considered  in  determining  open  access  and  retail \ncompetition. Foreign investors were largely behind the purchase of these four major assets.  \n\nTable A2.1:  Generation Assets Sold \n \n\nPower Plant \n\nGrid \n\nFuel \n\nTalomo  \n\nMindanao \n\nHydro \n\nInstalled \nCapacity \n(MW) \n3.5 \n\nDate of \nBidding \n\n25 Mar 2004\n\nPurchase \nPrice \n($\u2019000) \n\n1,370 \n\nAgusan  \n\nMindanao \n\nHydro \n\n4 Jun 2004\n\n1,528 \n\nBarit  \n\nLuzon \n\nHydro \n\n25 Jun 2004\n\n480 \n\nCawayan  \nLoboc  \nPantabangan-\nMasiway  \nMagat \n\nLuzon \nVisayas \nLuzon \n\nHydro \nHydro \nHydro \n\n30 Sep 2004\n10 Nov 2004\n7 Sep 2006\n\n410 \n1,420 \n129,000 \n\nLuzon \n\nHydro \n\n360.0 \n\n14 Dec 2006\n\n530,000 \n\n1.6 \n\n1.8 \n\n0.4 \n1.2 \n112.0 \n\nMasinloc \n\nLuzon \n\n600.0 \n\n26 Jul 2007\n\n930,000 \n\nCalaca \n\nLuzon \n\n600.0 \n\n16 Oct 2007\n\n786,530 \n\nAmbuklao-\nBinga \n\nLuzon \n\nHydro \n\n175.0 \n\n28 Nov 2007\n\n325,000 \n\nCoal \n\nCoal \n\nMW = megawatt.  \nSource: Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation. \n\nTotal\n\n1,855.5 \n\n \n\n2,705,738 \n\n                                                 \n1 These included decommissioned assets and assets located in Mindanao. \n\nWinning Bidder \n\nHydro Electric \nDev\u2019t Corp \nFirst Gen \nHoldings \nPeople\u2019s Energy \nServices, Inc. \nSORECO II \nSta.

PSALM\u2019s  indicative  privatization  schedule \nreleased in July 2007 shows that it intends to achieve this target by the end of 2009, though it \nrecognizes  that  delays  can  occur  as  a  result  of  several  factors,  including  investor  interest  in \nspecific  power  plants.  (Table  A2.2  provides  a  list  of  NPC  generation  assets  that  will  be \nauctioned  by  PSALM).  To  optimize  opportunities  for  the  privatization  of  NPC  power  plants, \nPSALM  would  consider  selling  a  mix  of  plants  under  a  portfolio  and  bidding  them  out  as  one \npackage. The specific timetable for the sale of the remaining assets would be released publicly \na few months before the bid date. \n \n\nTable A2.2: Generation Assets for Bidding \n \n\nInstalled Capacity \n(MW) \n\nPower Plant \n\nTiwi \nMakban \nAngat \nBacman \nPalinpinon \nTongonan \nBohol \nPanay (Dingle) \nAmlan \nIligan 1 and 2 \nNavotas I/II \nLimay \n \n\nGrid \n\nLuzon \nLuzon \nLuzon \nLuzon \nVisayas \nVisayas \nVisayas \nVisayas \nVisayas \nMindanao \nLuzon \nLuzon \n\nFuel \n\nGeothermal \nGeothermal \nHydro \nGeothermal \nGeothermal \nGeothermal \nDiesel \nDiesel \nHydro \nDiesel/Bunker \nDiesel \nDiesel/Bunker \n\n275.0 \n410.0 \n246.0 \n150.0 \n192.5 \n112.5 \n22.0 \n146.5 \n0.8 \n114.0 \n310.0 \n620.0 \n2,599.3 \n\nTotal \nMW = megawatt. \nSource: Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation. \n\n \n4. \nPSALM  has  a  twofold  strategy  for  disposing  of  its  decommissioned  assets.  It  could \nchoose  to  dispose  of  the  assets  through  open  competitive  bidding  or  through  a  third-party \nauctioneer.
