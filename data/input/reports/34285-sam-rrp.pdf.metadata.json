The  Project  is \nunlikely to have adverse environmental impacts. \n\nThe  Project  will  help  the  Government  continue  its  efforts  to  ensure  that \nschool education (grades 1\u201313) enhances equitable learning outcomes to \nprepare  competent  young  people  for  further  study,  work,  and  adult  life. \nThe  Project  supports  the  Government\u2019s  education  policies  and  the \nStrategy  for  the  Development  of  Samoa,  2005\u20132007,  which  identifies \nimprovements in learning achievement of primary and secondary students \nto  ensure  functional  literacy  as  a  national  priority  goal.  The  Project  will \nimprove  quality  of  learning  for  primary  and  secondary  school  children. \nCurriculum  for  all  subjects  from  years  1  to  8  will  be  improved.  New \nmultimedia  methods  will  be  developed  for  teaching  science  subjects  in \nyears  9  to  13.  All  primary  teachers  will  receive  training  in  the  use  of  the \nnew curriculum and assessment system. School environments of selected \nsecondary schools in rural areas will be upgraded to national standards.  \n \nThe  Project  has  five  components:  (i)  introducing  curriculum  reform  and \nassessment  systems;  (ii)  developing  effective  teachers;  (iii)  improving \naccess  to  quality  education;  (iv)  strengthening  capacity  to  undertake \nresearch, evaluation, policy analysis, and planning; and (v) strengthening \ncapacity  to  implement  and  manage  development  projects. The  Project  is \ndesigned  to  establish  a  learning  environment  that  provides  all  children \nwith  an  equal  opportunity  to  learn  at  a  higher  level,  while  increasing  the \ncost-effectiveness  of  service  provision.  The  Project  will  contribute  to \neliminating inequity by minimizing regional disparities in access to quality \neducation, and promoting equitable learning outcomes. Improving access \nto  quality  primary  and  secondary  education  in  poor  communities  is \nexpected to reduce income deprivation and hardship.  \n \nDespite many positive achievements in education since 1995, the quality \nof  education  as  measured  by  test  results  and  functional  literacy  remains \ndisappointing.  The  Samoa  primary  education  literacy  level  one  (year  4) \nand  two  (year  6)  tests,  which  assess  students  at  risk  of  not  reaching \nliteracy and numeracy standards, as well as year 8 examinations, indicate \nunsatisfactory  results.  For  example,  in  year  4,  students  at  risk  in  English \nincreased from 29% in 1997 to 51% in 2003; in year 6, students at risk in \nnumeracy  increased  from  63%  in  1997  to  71%  in  2003.  In  year  8,  raw \nscores  in  all  five  subject  areas  tested  declined.  At  the  secondary  level, \nscores on the year 12 examination in the 15 subject areas declined over \n\n\fii \n\nImpact and \nOutcome \n \n\nthe  5  years  between  1997  and  2002,  although  they  increased  in  most \nsubjects  in  2003.  Although  questions  may  be  asked  about  the  reliability, \nvalidity,  and  suitability  of  these  tests  to  accurately  measure  changes  in \nstudent  performance  over  time,  fundamental  problems  are  affecting \nschool  education  in  Samoa.  These  include  low  capacity  to  provide  high-\nquality  learning  opportunities  and  learning  environment  in  government \nschools, and ensure these are available to all students, and are delivered \nefficiently.  In  addition,  a  large  number  of  students  enrolling  in  primary \neducation  do  not  complete  the  8-year  program.  Dropout  and  repetition \nrates are high, indicating inefficiency in the school system.  \n \nWhile upgrading of primary schools is supported by European Union and \nJapan International Cooperation Agency micro projects, no such financing \nis  available  for  upgrading  and  rehabilitating  secondary  schools  in  rural \nareas.  While  the  education  sector  is  an  explicit  budget  priority,  available \nresources  are  often  not  managed  cost-effectively.  In  recent  years, \nfinancing  of  basic  and  secondary  education  has  decreased,  which  may \nhave contributed to the decline in performance levels. The Government\u2019s \neducation  policy  development  unit  is  weak,  and  needs  substantive \ncapacity  building  in  making  sound  policies  for  managing  service  delivery \neffectively.  \n \nThe Project addresses several priority areas in education service delivery. \nThe conditions  of learning  are  unsatisfactory  especially in  disadvantaged \nareas.  Textbooks  are  not  always  available  in  the  quantities  required,  the \nprimary curriculum is over 25 years old and is not integrated with the new \nsecondary  curriculum,  and  many  teachers  are  unfamiliar  with  effective \ninstructional  practice.  A  new  secondary  school  curriculum  has  been \nadopted, but teachers need training and technical support to implement it \nand adopt new teaching methods in the classroom. External support has \nbeen mainly through projects, but coordination of externally assisted and \nGovernment-funded  programs  has  often  been  poor.  The  Project  will \ncontinue  and  complement  support  initiated  under  the  first  Education \nSector  Project  (ESP  I)  and  other  externally  funded  projects  to  address \nthese \nthe \nGovernment\u2019s leadership.  \n \nThe Project supports the establishment of a more equitable and effective \neducation  system  that  enhances  learning  outcomes  of  young  people  for \nfurther study, work, and adult life. The specific outcome will be enhanced \nquality  of  education  by  improving  the  curriculum;  assessment;  learning \nmaterials;  teaching  practice;  and  equitable  access  to  trained  teachers, \nfacilities,  furniture,  and  equipment.  The  Project  will  focus  on  the  gaps  in \neducational service provision for children from disadvantaged areas. It will \nspecifically  target  secondary  schools  in  rural  areas  not  supported  by  the \nESP  I,  and  provide  systemwide  support  for  enhancing  equity,  quality, \nrelevance,  and  efficiency  of  service  delivery  for  primary  and  secondary \neducation. \n \nThe Project will align the financial contributions and engagement of three \ndevelopment  partners:  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  Australian \n\nfocus  on  effective  coordination \n\nissues,  and \n\nthrough \n\n\fCost Estimates \n\nFinancing Plan \n \n\niii \n\nAgency  for  International  Development  (AusAID),  and  New  Zealand \nAgency  for  International  Development  (NZAID),  with  a  Government-led \nsector  development  program.  The  implementation  arrangements  are \ndesigned  to  promote  greater  local  ownership,  alignment  with  local \nsystems, and aid harmonization as agreed in the Paris Declaration on Aid \nEffectiveness 2005. These arrangements will have a longer term outcome \non sustainable capacity building.  \n \nThe total cost of the Project is estimated at $30.00 million equivalent. Of \nthis  amount,  the  foreign  exchange  cost  is  estimated  at  $19.92  million \nequivalent  (66.4%),  and  the  local  currency  cost  at  $10.08  million \nequivalent (33.6%). \n \nADB  will  provide  a loan  of  $8.06  million  equivalent,  or  26.8%  of the total \nproject  cost.  The  loan  will  finance  $6.28  million  equivalent  of  the  foreign \nexchange cost (31.5%) and $1.78 million equivalent of the local currency \ncost  (17.7%).  AusAID  and  NZAID  will  each  provide  grant  cofinancing  of \n$8.60  million  equivalent  (28.7%  of  the  total  cost).  The  grant  cofinancing \nwill  be  partially  administered  by  ADB  and  subject  to  ADB  guidelines  and \nprocedures  for  procurement  of  goods  and  services  of  consultants.

Strategic  direction  and  oversight  for  the  Project  will  be \nprovided  by  the  Education  Steering  Committee.  MESC  will  have  overall \nresponsibility  for  day-to-day  management  of  project  implementation, \nmonitoring  and  evaluation,  and  reporting  of  progress.  At  the  operational \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting Services \n\nlevel,  the  Project  will  be  managed  by  the  MESC  Core  Executive, \ncomprising  the  chief  executive  officer  and  assistant  chief  executive \nofficers, and supported by the Office of the Chief Executive Officer and a \nproject  coordinator.  All  elements  of  the  Project  will  be  implemented \nthrough  the  existing  MESC  organizational  structure.  Responsibility  for \neach  component  will  rest  with  the  appropriate  assistant  chief  executive \nofficer and be implemented by staff of the relevant division.  \n \nThe project implementation structure for the Project aligns with the MESC \nstructure. The current project management team, established for the ESP \nI,  is  planned  to  become  an  integral  part  of  MESC\u2019s  organizational \nstructure  as  an  assets  management  unit.  It  will  have  responsibility  for \nprocurement  of  goods  and  services  for  all  the  components,  and  overall \nresponsibility for day-to-day coordination and management of component \n3 implementation, monitoring, evaluation of progress, and reporting to the \nMESC  Core  Executive  Group.  An  effective  project  management  and \nmonitoring  system  will  be  crucial  to  project  implementation.  Consulting \nservices  will be  provided to strengthen capacity  of the  Core Executive to \ndeliver  the  Project  and  future  development  projects  effectively  under \ncomponent 5.   \n \nAll  goods  and  services  financed  under  the  Project  will  be  procured  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and the Government\u2019s \nguidelines  for  procurement  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  contract  for  MESC \nheadquarters  estimated  to  cost  more  than  $1,000,000  will  be  awarded \nfollowing ADB\u2019s international competitive bidding procedures. All the other \ncontracts  under  the  Project  will  be  awarded  following  local  competitive \nbidding in accordance with Government procedures acceptable to ADB.  \n\nThe Project will provide about 122 person-months of domestic consulting \nand  103  person  months  of \ninternational  consulting  services.  All \ninternational  and  associated  domestic  consultants  will  be  selected  and \nrecruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic \nconsultants. All international consulting services will be provided by either \nfirms  or  individuals,  in  each  case  determined  by  MOF.  The  domestic \nthe  project \nconsulting  services  will  cover  all  services  except \nimplementation.  The  Project  will  use  quality-  and  cost-based  selection \n(QCBS)  method  for  recruitment  of  firms.  The  Project  will  provide \nconsultant  services  for  primary  curriculum  development,  assessment \nsystem,  information  communication  technology,  audio  visual  specialist, \nbilingual,  primary  subject  area  specialist,  advocacy,  pre-service  and,  in-\nservice  teacher  development,  public  opinion  assessment,  education \nequipment  procurement,  civil  works,  education  research  methods, \neducation  sector  expenditure  review,  education  sector  planning,  and \nproject management monitoring, and evaluation.   \n\nfor \n\nProject  Benefits  and \nBeneficiaries  \n \n\nThe  Project  focuses  on  systematic  improvement  in  the  quality  of  service \ndelivery  through  improved  curriculum,  learning  materials,  assessment \nsystems, and teacher training. The long-term benefits will be derived from \nstronger  institutional  capacity  delivering  improved  learning  outcomes. \n\n\fv \n\nlearning  materials \n\nfrom  quality \nAbout  40,000  primary  school  students  will  benefit \nimprovements through the Project. Schools with a large number of pupils \nat risk of dropping out will be targeted. These interventions are expected \nto  strengthen  Samoa\u2019s  human  resources  and  provide  an  opportunity  for \npoor people to participate in and benefit from development. \n \nAbout  15,000  secondary  students  will  benefit  from  more  relevant \nmultimedia \nin  science  and  agricultural  science. \nStudents on the islands of Savai\u2019i and Upolu will benefit from the services \nof  itinerant  design  technology  and  agriculture  science  teachers.  The \nschool  environment  of  selected  secondary  schools  and  three  colleges  in \ndisadvantaged  areas  will  be  upgraded  to  the  national  standard.  Offering \nrelevant, well-taught curriculum is an important incentive in attracting and \nkeeping  students  in  school.  Qualitative  system  improvements,  through \nrelevant curriculum and better learning environments, will result in higher \ntest  results,  and  lower  dropout  and  repetition  rates.  The  existence  of  a \nimprove  primary  school \nhigh-quality  district  secondary  school  will \nparticipation and completion rates, and complement investments in parent \nand community advocacy campaigns.  \n \nMESC\u2019s  capacity  will  be  strengthened  by  improving  staff\u2019s  research  and \nanalytical  work,  as  well  as  their  ability  to  generate  reliable  measurement \nindicators.  This  will  improve  the  Government\u2019s  policy  and  planning \ndevelopment  capacity  and  delivery  of  services.  The  Project  will  also \nstrengthen  MESC\u2019s  capacity  in  the  day-to-day  management,  evaluation, \nmonitoring, and implementation of development projects.  \n \nThe  Government  is  highly  committed  to  ensuring  equity,  quality, \nefficiency,  and  relevance  in  education.  This  requires  more  resources \ntargeted at poor communities. However, political pressures may constrain \nthis  and  the  ability  to  rationalize  the  system  to  use  resources  cost-\neffectively.  The  development  and  implementation  of  appropriate  policies \nto  use  resources  equitably  and  efficiently  is  required.  During  project \nimplementation,  dialogue  with  the  Government  will  seek  equitable \ndistribution  and  cost-effective  use  of  resources.  The  Project  does  not \nforesee  any  major  social  risks,  and  will  ensure  benefits  independent  of \ngender and enhance equity by targeting low-performing schools.  \n \nSustainability  risks  include  (i)  insufficient  recurrent  budgets  to  finance \nnonsalary  recurrent  inputs,  especially  in  the  primary  and  secondary \nsubsectors;  (ii)  deterioration  of  facilities  due  to  lack  of  maintenance;  (iii) \nlow  return  of  investments  in  teacher  training  due  to  attrition  from  the \nteaching force; and, (v) future underutilization of new secondary facilities \ndue to internal migration.  \n  \nTo  mitigate  risks,  the  Project  will  (i)  provide  substantial  support  to \nmaterials development, teacher training, and other quality enhancements \nas  a  bridging  strategy \nthe \nGovernment  to  develop  an  overall  policy  for  the  education  sector  and  a \nfinancing framework that will assure adequate support to basic education \noperation  and  maintenance  costs  (reflected  in  the  Government\u2019s  next \n\nto  provide  continuity,  while  assisting \n\nRisks and \nAssumptions \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\nTechnical \nAssistance \n\nEducation, Sports and Culture Policy and Strategic Plan, 2006\u20132014); (ii) \nsupport  development  of  policies  and  procedures  for  maintenance  and \nprotection  of  assets  (addressed  as  part  of  the  Education  Policy  and \nStrategic Plan framework); (iii) through technical assistance (TA) attached \nto the Project, build capacity for teacher development\u2014housing incentives \nmay  attract  and  retain  the  teachers  in  the  system  and  improvements  in \nphysical  work  environments  and  the  introduction  of  innovative  teaching \ntechniques  will  improve  teacher  job  satisfaction;  and  (iv)  improve \nefficiency  by  rationalizing  school  provision.  ADB  will  continue  policy \ndialogue  for  rationalization  of  the  education  system  to  release  scarce \nresources, and will assist MESC in developing student flow and simulation \nmodels to ensure that investments in civil works are appropriately sited. \n \nADB will provide an additional $350,000 equivalent as a TA grant from the \nADB-funded  TA  program.  The  TA  will  establish  a  framework  for \ndeveloping  effective  approaches  for  teacher  development  programs \nessential for longer term sustainability of the project activities (Appendix 5 \nprovides  details  of  the  TA).

\n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan,  (ii)  the  proposed  administration  under  the  terms  of  partial  administration  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  of  a  grant  to  be  provided  by  the  Government  of  Australia  in  an \namount  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $8.60  million,  and  (iii)  the  proposed  administration \nunder the terms of partial administration by ADB of a grant to be provided by the Government \nof New Zealand in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $8.60 million to the Government \nof  the  Independent  State  of  Samoa  for  the  Education  Sector  Project  II.  The  report  also \ndescribes a technical assistance (TA) for establishing capacity for teacher development, and if \nthe  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the \nBoard, will approve the TA. \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS AND OPPORTUNITES \n\nIn 2003, the Government asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide TA1 to \n2. \nprepare a follow-on project to the Education Sector Project (ESP I).2 The Project is included in \nthe country strategy program update (2005\u20132006),3 which prioritizes investments in education \nas  an  important  means  of  addressing  hardship  in  Samoa.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is attached in Appendix 1. \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nSamoa  became  independent  in  1962.  It  has  an  open  but  small  economy.  Gross \n3. \ndomestic  product  (GDP)  per  capita  exceeds  $1,400,  and  increased  by  3.4%  annually  from \n1995 to 2002. Poverty is not regarded as a problem: private remittances from the 35% of the \npopulation  living  abroad  are  substantial  (17%  of  gross  national  income)  and  the  extended \nfamily system functions as an effective means of redistributing income. External aid represents \n14.5% of gross national income (2002). Samoa ranks fifth in the region on both indexes of the \nUnited  Nations  Development  Programme:  Pacific  human  development  index  and  human \npoverty index, and 75th worldwide on the human development index. Lack of opportunity and \nincome  vulnerability,  often  exacerbated  by  external  economic  shocks  and  natural  disasters, \ncontribute to hardship in rural areas, particularly in the island of Savai\u2019i. \n\n4. \nEducation is a high priority of the Government. Achievements include an adult literacy \nrate of 98.7%, the highest in the region. Virtually all children have access to primary education \nand  almost  90%  of  grade  8  completers  enter  secondary  education.  Gender  disparities  have \nbeen  eliminated  at  the  primary  level  and  are  declining  at  the  secondary.  Samoa\u2019s  first  long-\nterm  education  development  plan4  focused  on  equity,  quality,  relevance,  and  efficiency  as \ncentral objectives. Past investments have given priority to (i) providing textbooks and learning \nresources  for  primary  education;  (ii)  developing  a  new  secondary  curriculum  and  textbooks; \n(iii)  improving  facilities  and  equipment  and  teacher  training;  (iv)  enhancing  special  needs \neducation; (v) expanding early childhood education;(vi) developing a bilingual language policy; \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003.

Appendix 2 provides an analysis of the education sector.  \n\n5. \nYet, significant challenges persist. The Strategy for the Development of Samoa 2005\u2013\n2007 identifies improvements in primary and secondary education as a national priority goal. \nIncreased public expenditure on education development (4.5% of gross domestic product and \n15% of total government expenditures in 2002) does not yet provide the educational outcomes \nenvisaged. Almost 25% of students enrolling in primary education do not complete the 8-year \nprogram. In grade 1, 7% of students drop out each year and about 5% repeat. Repetition and \ndropout rates in  grades  4  and  8 remain  high.  At the secondary level, about  70% of students \nentering grade 9 continue to grade 12, but less than half of 12th graders advance to grade 13.   \n\nVariations  in  student  learning  achievement  are  significant.  Student  performance  in \n6. \nprivate  and  mission  schools  is  better  than  in  government  schools.  Low  retention  and  poor \nlearning  is  prevalent  among  students  who  are  poor  and  live  in  rural  areas.  They  are  often \npoorly prepared when they enroll; the schools they attend do not offer quality opportunities to \nlearn; and their parents can only provide limited support and allow students to drop out when \nfacing difficulties. The result is that less than 25% of each age cohort completes 13 years of \neducation.  Many  others end their formal  education  poorly prepared for further learning  or for \nwork.   \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n7. \nQuality  learning  opportunities  are  not  available  to  all  students.  A  recent  review  of  the \neducation  sector  identified  several  issues:  (i)  poor  primary  curriculum  and  assessment \npractices,  (ii)  lack  of  competent  teachers  in  bilingual  education,  (iii)  limited  availability  of \ninstructional  materials,  (iv)  shortage  of  well-trained  teachers,  (v)  substandard  school \ninfrastructure in disadvantaged areas, and (vi) limited management capacity of MESC.   \n\n8. \nCurricula,  Teaching,  and  Assessment  Practice.  The  primary  curriculum  is  over  25 \nyears  old.  An  updated  curriculum  policy  framework  and  subject  and  year-level  curriculum \nstatements  emphasizing  more  active,  child-centered  learning  activities  in  the  classroom; \nstrengthening  of  pedagogical  teaching  skills;  and  a  range  of  classroom  assessment \ntechniques  are  essential  for  high-quality  teaching  and  learning.  The  Government  intends  to \ndevelop an integrated curriculum for primary years 1\u20133 and subject-specific curricula in seven \nsubject  areas  for  years  4\u20138.  Work  is  still  needed  to  renew  the  primary  curriculum;  provide \nteachers\u2019  manuals,  textbooks,  and  learning  materials;  and  design  related  in-service  training \nprograms.  The  Samoa  primary  education  literacy  level  tests  and  the  reported  examination \nresults do not provide effective feedback on student performance on specific test items. A high \npriority is attaining a bilingual program, producing graduates fluent in Samoan and English.  \n\n9. \nCompetent  Teachers  in  Bilingual  Education.  The  medium  of  instruction  and \ncompetent  teachers  in  bilingual  education  are  major  issues,  as  a  high  level  of  English \ncompetence is required for success in examinations. Officially, all teaching in years 1\u20133 is in \nSamoan. In year 4, English is introduced. By year 7, all instruction is supposed to be primarily \nin  English.  At  the  secondary  level,  English  is  expected  to  be  the  language  of  instruction.  In \nmany classrooms a mix of Samoan and English is used, mainly because teachers do not have \nenough competency in English to use English as a medium of instruction.  \n\n10. \nInstructional  Materials.  The  supply  of  learning  materials  is  insufficient  and  largely \ndependent  on  aid  projects.  The  MESC  recurrent  budget  provides  for  reprinting  of  primary \nschool textbooks to ensure a new supply every 5 years. Toward the end of the 5-year period, a \nsevere shortage of textbooks occurs. Books are typically shared and students are often forced \n\n\f3 \n\nto  copy  materials  from  the  blackboard.  Many  primary  teachers  have  been  trained  in  more \nlearner-centered  teaching  and  assessment  methods,  but  the  textbooks  do  not  reflect  such \napproaches.  The  new  curriculum  framework  (1\u201313)  requires  new  textbooks,  student \nworkbooks, and other learning materials. Moreover, supplementary materials such as readers \n(in Samoan and English) and audiovisual materials are in short supply. These shortages limit \nthe ability of teachers to implement instructional practices that new curricula call for, and limit \nteaching effectiveness.  \n\nTeacher  Shortage.  Well-trained  teachers  with  adequate  skills  to  transmit  knowledge \n11. \nand  manage  classrooms  are  in  short  supply.  Low  salaries  and  limited  opportunities  for \nprofessional  development  make  attracting  well-qualified  secondary  graduates  into  teaching, \nand then retaining them, difficult. The merger of the former Western Samoa Teacher Training \nCollege with the National University of Samoa (NUS) changed course offerings for preservice \ntraining.  These  changes  have  adversely  affected  the  effectiveness  of  teacher  development \nprograms  as  basic  lesson  planning  and  delivery  skills  do  not  receive  adequate  attention.  In-\nservice  training  often  provided  by  aid-supported  projects  is  uncoordinated  and  lacks \nsustainability. At the secondary level, the anticipated growth in enrollment requires an increase \nin  the  output  of  the  preservice  programs  with  significant  shortages  expected  in  sciences, \neconomics,  and  accounting.  Teachers  also  require  training  in  the  new  curriculum.  Quality \nimprovement initiatives are unlikely to succeed without in-service training, in-school support to \nteachers,  effective  monitoring  by  principals  and  school  review  officers,  and  cooperative \nprojects with NUS to effectively provide examples of good practices for the benefit of both pre- \nand in-service teacher education.  \n\nSubstandard School Infrastructure. Nearly every village has a primary school, jointly \n12. \nsupported by the Government and the community. Each district has a secondary school with \nthe  bigger  districts  having  two.  Recent  community  consultations  identified  the  condition  of \nschool facilities as an important source of dissatisfaction. Although many primary schools and \nsome secondary schools have been upgraded in recent years, several schools in poorer areas \nstill operate in facilities that do not meet national standards. Schools have an acute shortage \nof desks and chairs. A system of preventive maintenance of the assets is required to protect \nthe investments.  \n\nCapacity to Manage the System. The recently completed Institutional Strengthening \n13. \nProject,  funded  by  the  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development  (AusAID),  worked  to \nstrengthen  MESC\u2019s  capacity  to  manage  the  education  system.  The  relatively  sophisticated \neducation  management  information  service  developed  provides  detailed  education  statistics, \nbut they are not always effectively used. Only four research studies were conducted during the \nlast  10  years.  The  Policy,  Planning,  and  Research  Division  of  MESC  prepared  the  Strategic \nPolicy,  Research,  and  Development  Projects  Framework  (October  2003)  and  Guidelines  for \nManaging  and  Conducting  MESC\u2019s  Research  Projects  (2004).  MESC  now  wants  to  involve \nexternal  agencies  in  education  research  that  is  ethical  and  of  high  quality,  respects  cultural \nvalues, causes minimum disruption to students\u2019 learning, is of benefit to education in Samoa, \nand available to MESC.5 This provides the possibility of contracting out research, but the staff \nof the Policy, Planning, and Research Division will need training in designing, monitoring, and \nassessing  the  quality  of  policy  research  and  evaluation.  Policies  and  procedures  for \ndevelopment  planning  by  schools  and  communities  have  been  piloted,  but  need  to  be \nextended and supported by training and financial resources. School management committees \nhave  been  established,  but  their  roles  and  responsibilities  need  to  be  clarified  and  their \n                                                 \n5  MESC.  2003.

Apia, Samoa.  \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\ncapacities  developed.  The  potential  of  information  and  communication  technology  in \nstrengthening the capacity of education sector management needs to be developed. \n\n14. \nEquity,  the  Central  Challenge.  Issues  of  participation  and  quality  are  related  to  the \ncore issue of equal opportunities for all students to learn, and acquire the knowledge and skills \nspecified  in  the  curriculum.  Low  education  performance  is  closely  related  to  economic \nhardship. A World Bank study suggests that the likelihood of children from the lowest quintile \nof households reaching secondary education is low. Poor parents have difficulty paying school \nfees,  especially  at  the  secondary  level.  Poor  students  attend  preschools  less  frequently  and \nhave a home environment unable to support schooling. Thus, children of poor families perform \nless well in school and often drop out early.  \n\nExternal  Support  and  Lessons  Learned.  External  funding  concentrates  heavily  on \n15. \nthe education sector (Appendix 3) and the lessons to be learned from these interventions are \nsignificant  (Appendix  4).  AusAID,  European  Union,  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency \nNew  Zealand  Agency  for  International  Development  (NZAID),  United  Nations  agencies,  and \nothers  have  been  involved  in  a  number  of  education  projects.  Their  funding  has  included \nimportant  support  for  curriculum  development,  teacher  training,  instructional  materials,  and \ncapacity  building.  The  European  Union  and  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  have \nprovided  support  for  primary  school  construction.  ADB,  with  the  Government  and  school \ncommittees, has allocated $7 million for civil works, furniture, equipment, library materials, and \nteacher  training  as  part  of  the  ESP  I.  Twelve  secondary  schools  and  seven  primary  schools \nwere  rehabilitated  and/or  expanded.  Furniture,  equipment,  learning  materials,  and  library \nresources  were  provided,  and  secondary  teachers  trained  in  coordination  with  the  NZAID-\nsupported Samoa Secondary Education Curriculum and Resources Project. The experiences \nof  ADB  and  other  funding  agencies  in  Samoa  have  been  positive,  although  uncoordinated \ninterventions  and  the  short-term  nature  of  projects  weakened  the  overall  impact.  The  key \nlesson of the experience is that well-targeted investments can improve the quality and equity \nof education provision, but effective implementation of these initiatives at the school level is of \ncentral  importance  and  requires  special  attention.  The  Project  was  prepared  in  coordination \nwith  the  major  funding  agencies  in  the  education  sector  to  avoid  duplication  in  efforts  and \nmove  toward  a  more  comprehensive  sector  approach.  This  aligns  with  the  harmonization \nprinciples contained in the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness 2005.  \n\n16. \nGovernment Priorities. The Government is committed to  achieving Education for All \nand the Millennium Development Goals. The Government recognizes that quality improvement \nin  education  service  provision,  using  a  sector  approach,  is  essential  to  achieve  its  long-term \nobjectives.  To  this  end,  it  may  need  to  review  resource  allocations  to  different  education \nsubsectors,  ensure  that  basic  education  is  funded  at  the  level  necessary  for  achieving  the \nEducation  for  All  and  Millennium  Development  Goal  targets,  and  use  resources  with  optimal \nefficiency.  Measures  need  to  be  taken  to  rationalize  the  education  system  to  release  scarce \nresources for the operation and maintenance of schools. \n\n17. \nADB Strategy. ADB\u2019s education strategy in Samoa supports the Government\u2019s overall \nstrategies  and  reflects  the  Government\u2019s  sector  priorities.  The  Project  has  been  formulated \nwithin the framework of the Government\u2019s economic and public sector policies. It will support \ninterventions  that  aim  at  improving  access  of  disadvantaged  children  to  quality  schooling  to \nenhance  their  education  performance,  which  in  turn  will  reduce  hardship.  It  recognizes  the \nimportance  of  strengthening  the  capacity  of  the  Government  to  design  and  implement \neducation  programs  and  reforms.  It  intends  to  build  on  the  progress  that  has  already  been \nrealized by the Government with the support of bilateral funding agencies and ADB. Although \nideally  the  Project  should  have  been  designed  after  the  formulation  of  the  Education,  Sports \n\n\f5 \n\nand  Culture  Policy  and  Strategic  Plan,  2006\u20132014  (EPSP),6  the  Project  is  based  on  priority \nareas  already  identified  in  the  SDS  and  the  EPSP.  Work  toward  developing  the  EPSP \nframework is well under way, and the design of the Project is flexible to incorporate any priority \nareas  that  are  not  yet  addressed.  ADB  will  continue  its  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government \nand support the development of a policy environment that prioritizes equitable opportunities to \nlearn.  It  will  also  continue  dialogue  on  reforms  in  the  education  sector  that  would  provide \nresources for operation and maintenance of schools.  \n\nADB  is  implementing  TA  for  the  Samoa  SchoolNet  and  Community  Access  Pilot \n18. \nProject.7  The  TA  is  designed  to  improve  the  quality  and  efficiency  of  education  by  providing \naccess  to  global  information  through  improved  access  to  information  and  communication \ntechnology,  especially  in  rural  areas.  The  pilot  project  is  designed  to  demonstrate  the \napplicability  of  SchoolNet  and  community  access,  as  well  as  improved  teacher  training  and \nmaterials through distance learning.  \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  Project  is  to  establish  an  equitable  and  effective  education  system  that  will \n19. \nenhance learning outcomes of young people for further study, work, and adult life. The specific \noutcome  will  be  enhanced  quality  of  education  by  improving  the  curriculum,  assessment \nprocedures,  learning  materials,  and  teaching  practice;  and  providing  equitable  access  to \ntrained  teachers,  facilities,  furniture,  and  equipment.  The  Project  will  focus  on  bridging  the \ngaps  in  educational  service  provision  for  children  from  disadvantaged  areas  by  specifically \ntargeting secondary schools in rural areas not supported by the ESP I and other aid-assisted \nprojects.  It  will  also  support  a  major  effort  to  strengthen  the  national  capacity  for  education \nresearch  and  evaluation,  and  MESC\u2019s  capacity  to  manage  development  projects  and \nimplement policy reforms. \n\nB. \n\nOutputs  \n\nThe  Project  has  five  components:  (i)  introducing  curriculum  reform  and  assessment \n20. \nsystems;  (ii)  developing  effective  teachers;  (iii)  improving  access  to  quality  education;  (iv) \nstrengthening capacity to  undertake research,  evaluation,  policy  analysis, and  planning;, and \n(v)  strengthening  capacity  to  implement  and  manage  development  projects.  Outputs  of \ncomponent  1  are  (i)  new  primary  curriculum,  (ii)  adequate  supply  of  learning  materials  and \nteacher  manuals,  (iii)  community  partnerships  program,  (iv)  national  assessment  policy \nframework, and (v) new assessment systems.  For the second component, the outputs will be \n(i)  national  teacher  development  framework,  (ii)  increased  number  of  agricultural  science \nteachers,  (iii)  pre-  and  in-service  training  for  new  initiatives,  (iv)  development  of  a  cadre  of \ntrainers,  and  (v)  continuous  in-service  teacher  development  and  school-based  support.  The \noutputs  of  component  3  will  be  (i)  improved  secondary  school  facilities  and  a  community \nlearning  center,  (ii)  improved  procedures  and  resources  for  school  maintenance,  (iii)  pilot \nprovision  of houses for  teachers in  rural  areas,  and (iv) construction  of  MESC  headquarters. \nThe outputs of component 4 will be (i) improved national capacity for research and evaluation, \n(ii) analysis of the causes of low achievement and noncompletion, and preparation of a plan of \n                                                 \n6  The formulation of the next EPSP will be assisted by ADB TA grant funding and will be built on the findings of the \n\nADB-supported education sector study (ADB. 2004. Education Sector Study. Manila). \n\n7  ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the Independent State of Samoa for Supporting the Samoa SchoolNet and \n\nCommunity Access Pilot Project. Manila (TA 4305-SAM for $600,000, approved on 19 December 2003). \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\naction  for  follow-up,  and  (iii)  strengthened  MESC  capacity  for  policy  analysis  and  planning. \nThe  outputs  for  the  component  5  are  (i)  improved  strategic  program  management  and \ncoordination  of  implementation,  (ii)  integrated  financial  management  system,  and  (iii)  an \neffective project performance monitoring, evaluation, and reporting system.  \n \n \n \n21. \nthe knowledge, skills, and attitudes specified in the national curriculum.  \n\nThis component will ensure that all students have the opportunity to learn and acquire \n\nComponent 1: Introducing Curriculum Reform and Assessment Systems  \n\n1. \n\n22. \nNew  Primary  Curriculum  and  Assessment  System.  The  new  curriculum  and  the \nrelated instructional materials will emphasize more active, child-centered learning activities in \nthe classroom, and assessment techniques essential for high-quality learning. The Project will \nsupport\u2014through  the  provision  of  consulting  services  and  training\u2014the  development  of  a \ncurriculum  for  years  1  to  8  that  will  support  more  effective  instruction  and  be  consistent  with \nMESC\u2019s  bilingual  education  policy,  the  National  Curriculum  Policy  Framework,  and  the \nNational Special Needs Policy. A subject statement will be developed for each learning area. \nThese will integrate values articulated in the National Curriculum Policy Framework and assist \nstudents experiencing learning difficulties and those with special needs.  \n\nAdequate  Supply  of  Learning  Materials  and  Teacher  Manuals.  The  Project  will \n23. \nimprove  MESC\u2019s  capacity  for  producing  audiovisual  learning  materials.  The  development  of \nsupplementary  readers  in  Samoan  and  English  is  an  important  objective  to  support \nimplementation  of  the  bilingual  education  policy;  the  Project  will  support  the  provision  of \nlearning  materials  and  teaching  manuals.  These  will  cover  a  range  of  topics,  which  will \nthematically link  with  other subjects in science,  mathematics, social science,  health, physical \neducation,  and  music,  as  well  as  the  everyday  lives  of  students.  The  curriculum  review  and \nrenew process will ensure that gender stereotypes, if any, are removed from the content of the \ntextbooks. A strategic plan will be developed to ensure that readers are constantly written and \nprepared. The Project will provide consulting services and training to support these activities. \nCurriculum support materials, in the form of teachers\u2019 manuals, will be developed and provide \nteachers  with  sequenced  instructional  activities  related  to  each  achievement  objective.  They \nwill be organized on a subject basis to support the scope and sequence of learning within each \nsubject  and  include  integrated  units  where  cross-curriculum  learning  is  deemed  logical  and \nappropriate.  Along  with  instructional  activities,  sample  assessment  tasks  and  student  work \nsamples will assist in benchmarking student performance and help teachers to assess student \nprogress and growth.  \n\n24. \nAt the secondary level, an important priority is the introduction of multimedia methods \nfor  science  and  agricultural  sciences  education.  Currently  the  country  has  a  shortage  of \ntrained  secondary  teachers  in  mathematics,  physics,  chemistry,  biology,  and  agricultural \nscience.  Although  the  teacher  is  the  critical  component  in  learning,  students  can  still  learn \nthrough  means  other  than  face-to-face  instruction.  New  multimedia  approaches  for  learning \nincluding  video,  learning  software  for  computers,  radio,  and  television  have  considerable \npotential  to  enhance  learning.  The  capacity  of  the  education  broadcasting  unit  will  be \ndeveloped  through  project-provided  consulting  services  and  training  to  prepare  multimedia \nmaterials for science and agricultural science. In-service training will be conducted to introduce \nthe  multimedia  materials.  Results  will  be  evaluated,  and  if  successful,  production  can  be \nexpanded to other subject areas.  \n\n25. \nNational  Assessment  Policy  Framework.  The  introduction  of  a  new  primary \ncurriculum  and  expected  changes  in  the  way  students  move  to  further  education  and \n\n\f7 \n\nto \n\nthe  examination  system.  The  assessment  and \nemployment  necessitate  changes \nexamination policies and systems will be reviewed, including the purpose and continuing use \nof  the  year  8  examination;  the  assessment  system  will  be  reformed.  A  national  assessment \npolicy  framework  will  be  developed  to  reflect  current  curriculum  reforms  including  bilingual \neducation  and  allow  the  monitoring  of  progress  in  student  learning  over  time.  The  current \nfunctions,  administration  structures,  and  processes  of  the  assessment  unit  will  be  reviewed. \nThe  national  assessment  policy  framework  will  take  into  account  proposed  changes  to  the \nPacific  secondary  school  certificate  administration,  introduction  of  a  regional  form  7,  links  to \npost-school  recognition,  and  work  of  the  Samoa  Qualifications  Authority.  The  Project  will \nprovide consulting services and training support. \n\nCommunity  Partnerships  Program  for  Demand  Generation  and \n\n26. \nImproved \nLearning  Outcomes.  The  subcomponent  will  provide  technical  support  for  a  home-school \nliteracy  partnership  for  two  pilot  schools:  in-service  training  on  literacy  leadership,  and  the \ndevelopment  of  the  Fagaloa  community  learning  center  program.  Activities  under  this \nsubcomponent will result in strengthened families and communities with high expectations and \nsupport for the learning of their family members, including those with special education needs. \nIt will result in a community learning center that encourages involvement, sparks interest, and \ndevelops community capacity.  \n\n \n\n2. \n\nComponent 2: Developing Effective Teachers  \n\n27. \nTeachers are at the core of efforts to improve the quality of education and the level of \nstudent  learning.  Of  greatest  importance  are  teachers\u2019  content  knowledge,  quality  of  their \npedagogical  approaches,  and  effectiveness  of  the  instructional  support  they  receive  at  the \nschool itself. The objective of this component is to ensure that teachers implement the national \ncurriculum  using  effective  instructional  strategies.  The  Project's  activities  will  be  part  of  the \nbroader MESC efforts to improve teacher deployment and management by establishing a pool \nof  relief  teachers,  experiment  with  itinerant  teachers,  introduce  school-based  monitoring  of \nquality, and establish formal staff appraisal procedures.  \n\n28. \nNational  Teacher  Development  Framework.  TA  will  be  provided  to  develop  a \nnational teacher development framework (Appendix 5). This will provide the basis for a teacher \ndevelopment  policy  that  replaces  the  current  ad-hoc  approach  to  pre-  and  in-service  training \nwith  one  that  is  coherent,  aims  at  continuous  support  for  improving  teachers\u2019  professional \nskills,  and  establishes  an  institutional  capacity-building  framework  for  the  management  of \nteacher  development.  The  TA  recommendations  and  outcomes  will  be  taken  up  in  several \nactivities  of  the  Project.  First,  the  TA  recommendations  on  minimum  standards  for  teacher \ncompetencies will (i) directly guide the design of the in-service teacher training planned in the \nProject;  (ii)  serve  as  a  quality  indicator  for  this  activity;  and  (iii)  assist  the  articulation  of  in-\nservice  training  with  quality  preservice  training.  Second,  recommendations  and  guidelines  to \nbe  developed  by  the  TA  on  management  will  enhance  MESC  capacity  to  engage  with  other \nstakeholders to better coordinate the production and supply of effectively trained teachers. The \nProject  will  support  activities  recommended  under  the  TA  findings  as  agreed  with  the \nGovernment.  \n\nIncreased  Number  of  Agricultural  Science  Teachers.  To  help  the  Government \n29. \naddress  the  severe  shortage  of  agricultural  science  teachers,  the  Project  will  support \nfellowships  for  a  2-year  fast-track  training  program  jointly  implemented  by  NUS,  Samoa \nPolytechnic, and University of the South Pacific. Upon graduation, the fellowship students will \nbe bonded as government teachers for 2 years. The Project will provide 10 agricultural science \nfellowships and consulting services to develop the training program \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nPre- and In-Service Training for New Initiatives. Teacher training for new initiatives \n30. \nis critically important to their successful implementation in the classroom. Most important  will \nbe  training  primary  school  teachers  as  the  new  primary  curriculum  statements,  teacher \nmanuals, and learning materials become available in 2008\u20132010. The Project will prepare and \nsupport a detailed plan for new curriculum training.  \n\n31. \nDevelopment  of  a  Cadre  of  Trainers.  Well-prepared  teacher  trainers  to  provide \ntraining in subject-specific instructional strategies and to introduce content with which teachers \nare not sufficiently familiar are key to the in-service training strategy. The Project will support \nTA and training workshops for training trainers.  \n\n32. \nIn-Service  Teacher  Development  and  School-Based  Support.  Routine  teacher \ntraining  is  essential  to  bring  about  sustainable  improvements  in  instructional  practice.  The \nProject  will  support  a  combination  of  training  programs  and  courses  to  improve  general \nteaching  skills,  provide  subject  cluster  content  training,  and  ensure  school-based  support  for \nimproved  teaching  as  a  follow-up  to  the  training.  Every  teacher  will  be  exposed  to  in-service \ntraining for an average of 10 days a year.  \n\n \n\n3. \n\nComponent 3: Improving Access to Quality Education  \n\n33. \nImproved  Secondary  School  Facilities  and  a  Community  Learning  Center.  The \nProject  will  support  upgrading  of  nine  secondary  schools  and  three  fully  Government-funded \ncolleges.8  In  addition,  in  one  secondary  school,  Fagaloa  School,  the  Project  will  finance  the \nrefurbishment  of  existing  classrooms  into  specialist  rooms  and  make  this  school  a  pilot \ncommunity  learning  center.  The  center  will  promote  relevant  technical  skills  including \ninformation and communication technology, mathematics for regular students, second chance \neducation  for  out-of-school  youth,  and  adult  education.  Consulting  services  support  will  be \nprovided  for  strengthening  the  project  management  team,  which  will  become  the  assets \nmanagement unit of MESC, to implement activities under this component. In each secondary \nschool,  administrative  and  library  blocks,  science  laboratories,  design  and  textile  workshop, \nand  toilet  blocks  are  required;  in  three  cases,  classroom  blocks  are  required.  School  design \nand  construction  will  include  provision  for  full  access  facilities  for  physically  challenged \nchildren  to  attend  school.  Furniture,  equipment,  and  learning  material  packages  will  be \nprovided. Appendix 6 lists the schools to be upgraded.  \n\n34. \nPilot Provision of Houses for Teachers in Rural Areas. The feasibility of attracting \nteachers  to  rural  primary  schools  in  less  favorable  locations  will  be  tested  by  providing \nattractive housing in four villages where teachers in certain subject areas are in short supply. \nThe houses will be built within existing school compounds. The program will be evaluated at \nthe end of year 2.  \n\n35.  MESC Headquarters. The Project will support the design and construction of the new \nMESC  headquarters  at  the  Government\u2019s  Malifa  compound.  The  new  building  will  enable \neffective operation of MESC to deliver quality education support services.  \n\n36.  Maintenance.  The  Project  will  finance  the  maintenance  costs  of  school  facilities \nupgraded  under  the  Project,  teachers\u2019  houses,  and  MESC  headquarters;  and  develop  new \npolicy and procedures for sustainable maintenance of school facilities.  \n\n                                                 \n8  These colleges are actually secondary schools, but fully funded by the Government. \n\n\f9 \n\n4. \n\nComponent 4: Strengthening Capacity to Undertake Research, Evaluation, \nPolicy Analysis, and Planning  \n\n37. \nThis  component  will  focus  on  the  Government\u2019s  capacity  to  formulate  appropriate \npolicies  to  make  the  education  system  more  effective,  efficient,  and  responsive  to  clients\u2019 \nneeds. It is designed to (i) strengthen the national capacity for research and evaluation, which \nwill  provide  a  stronger  basis  for  evidence-based  policy  development;  (ii)  strengthen  the \ncapacity  of  MESC  staff  to  analyze  education  data,  identify  priority  issues  for  action,  plan \nremedial  interventions  and  policy  reforms,  and  monitor  implementation;  and  (iii)  support  a \nlearning-by-doing  capacity-building  strategy,  which  will  provide  national  staff  with  the \nopportunity to carry out research and evaluation studies, plan education reforms, and design \nremedial interventions with decreasing external technical support. Thus, an experienced group \nof national professionals will be available for MESC to call on for specialized technical work.  \n\n38. \nImproved National Capacity for Research and Evaluation. The Project will support \nthe training of 30 staff of MESC, NUS, Samoa Polytechnic, and other institutions and agencies \nto expose them to the latest techniques in education research and analytical methodologies to \nstrengthen capacity and quality of education research. To give them the opportunity to apply \ntheir skills, the Project will finance five field studies. Priority topics identified are (i) evaluation \nof the effectiveness of teaching, and role of school principals and school review officers; and \n(ii)  strategies  for  vocational  training.  Topics  for  three  more  studies  will  be  agreed  during \nimplementation.  \n\n39. \nA similar capacity-building approach will be adopted to strengthen the national capacity \nfor evaluation of the impact of specific interventions, pilots, and experiments including the pilot \nexperiment under the Project. Priorities identified are (i) impact of ESP I support to secondary \nschools on the effectiveness of instruction in project-supported schools, including agricultural \nscience  and  design  technology  programs,  to  be  completed  by  the  midterm  review;  and  (ii) \npilots and policy experiments financed by the Project, including the community learning center \nin Fagaloa, and the provision of teacher housing, upon completion of these pilots. Three more \nevaluation studies may be identified during implementation. The Project will support seminars \nand/or workshops for the design, conduct, and review of the evaluation process by providing \n(i)  consulting  services,  (ii)  training  workshops,  (iii)  operational  costs,  (iv)  equipment,  and  (v) \nfield  study  costs.  Studies  will  be  commissioned  on  the  basis  of  a  competitive  peer  review \nprocess.  \n\n40. \nAnalysis of Causes of Low Achievement and Noncompletion, and Preparation of \na Plan of Action. A central education policy concern is the considerable variation in, and the \nlow  average  level  of,  student  learning  achievement;  as  well  as  the  persistent  presence  of \nabout 20% of children of school age who do not complete their primary education. The causes \nneed  to  be  clarified  to  provide  a  solid  foundation  for  the  formulation  of  an  effective  policy \nresponse  and  plan  remedial  interventions.  The  Project  will  support  the  cost  of  the  study, \nworkshops, and consulting services. \n\n41. \nStrengthening  of  MESC\u2019s  Capacity  for  Policy  Analysis  and  Planning.  As  the \neducation system develops and performance expectations increase, education policies, plans, \nand investments programs are becoming increasingly complex. The policy emphasis is shifting \nfrom  the  expansion  of  access  to  the  improvement  of  quality,  but  in  an  environment  of \nincreasingly  constrained  resources,  which  makes  improvements  in  the  efficiency  in  service \ndelivery imperative. At the same time, MESC aims to exercise increased leadership in policy \ndevelopment  and  reduce  its  reliance  on  external  TA.  To  cope  with  the  demands  of  policy \nanalysis  and  planning,  and strengthen  national capacity, the Project  will support training and \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\ncapacity-building focused TA. An important task will be to conduct a review of the efficiency of \npublic education expenditures. \n\n5. \n\nComponent  5:  Strengthening  Capacity  to \nDevelopment Projects \n\nImplement  and  Manage \n\n42. \nGiven  the  importance  of  the  education  sector  and  the  presence  of  several  funding \nagencies,  the  Government  wants  to  move  to  a  sector  approach  for  education.  This  requires \nnational  capacity  to  manage  development  projects  and  external  support  that  is  increasingly \nprovided on a programmatic basis with progressive harmonization of procedures for financial \nmanagement, procurement, reporting on expenditures, input delivery, and progress in meeting \ndevelopment objectives and performance targets. This component is designed to assist MESC \nin  building  and  institutionalizing  capacity  to  achieve  this  goal.  To  ensure  more  effective  and \nefficient  implementation,  the  component  will  help  ensure  (i)  coordination  of  implementation \nbetween  the  different  components  and  strategic  program  management,  (ii)  monitoring  of \nimplementation,  expenditure,  input  delivery,  and  their  integration  in  the  government  finance \nand reporting system; and most importantly, and (iii) implementation of robust mechanisms for \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  of  progress  of \nthe  Project\u2019s  development  objectives  and \nperformance targets. \n\n43. \nImproved  Strategic  Program  Management  and  Coordination  of  Implementation. \nResponsibility for coordination and strategic program management functions will rest with the \nMESC Core Executive. The development of the EPSP will provide the Government and MESC \nwith a long-term strategic vision for the education sector. To ensure that the Project and future \naid  interventions  are  consistent  with  this  framework  and  are  able  to  respond  to  Government \nand  MESC  priorities,  the  Project  will  provide  high-level  technical  advice  and  other  capacity \nbuilding  to  the  Core  Executive  and  other  parts  of  the  MESC  organization.  The  main  form  of \nassistance will be the availability of a strategic adviser, who will work, as required, directly with \nthe  chief  executive  officer  (CEO)  and  other  members  of  the  Core  Executive.  Other  capacity-\nbuilding assistance may include specialized training programs for senior staff (with less formal \ntraining), study tours and/or access to overseas study through distance learning programs. In \nresponse  to  MESC\u2019s  requests,  the  Project  will  provide  technical  advice  and  other  capacity-\nbuilding  support  for  up  to  18  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  and  30 \nperson-months of domestic consulting services, complemented by the provision of equipment. \n\n44. \nIntegrated Financial Management System. On 1 July 2005, the Government adopted \na new financial management system (government finance and reporting system) that is more \nflexible and able to produce information and reports requested by funding agencies. However, \nthe  involvement  of  cofinanciers  in  the  Project  does  mean  that  some  existing  systems  within \nMESC  will  have  to  be  adapted  for  project-specific  needs.  This  subcomponent  will  support \nMESC  to  establish  and  implement  an  integrated  reporting  framework  under  the  government \nfinance and reporting system that meets both the Government and funding agency information \nrequirements. This will include activities such as developing guidelines for the Project\u2019s special \npurpose account (if utilized), designing a chart of accounts for project expenditure, and setting \nup project-specific reporting. \n\nEffective  Project  Performance  Monitoring,  Evaluation,  and  Reporting  System. \n45. \nThe Project will have a monitoring, evaluation, and reporting system that meets the needs of \nthe Government and the development partners. MESC has the capacity to collect and report \nperformance  information  for  the  Government  within  the  context  of  the  budget  cycle.  The \nProject will build on these existing systems and procedures, and support MESC to strengthen \ncapacity in performance measurement and reporting for the sector. \n\n\f11 \n\nAssistance  will  consist  of  technical  advice  to  establish  the  requirements  of  the  users \n46. \n(Government,  ADB,  AusAID,  and  NZAID)  and  determine  how  these  can  be  integrated  into \ncurrent  reporting  systems  and  capacity  building  for  staff  involved  in  data  collection, \ncompilation, analysis, and reporting. Other assistance may include support for regular review \nof the performance framework and development of the initial review and forward program. \n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\nContinuity  of  the  ESP  I  and  Other  Aid-Funded  Projects.  The  impact  of  education \n47. \ninterventions  takes  a  long  time  to  be  realized.  Therefore,  the  Project  takes  a  long-term \napproach to addressing education issues in Samoa by building on earlier projects by various \nfunding agencies. The project design is built on an extensive sector review, and identified gaps \nand good practices to avoid duplication with earlier initiatives, and to build on progress. Until \nnow, almost all the major bilateral funding agencies supported curriculum and teacher training, \nbut  in  a  piecemeal  manner.  Hence,  outcomes  were  uneven  in  terms  of  real  learning \nachievements. Project design involved a participatory approach and close coordination with all \nthe  bilateral  and  multilateral  agencies,  as  well  as  nongovernment  organizations,  civil  society \nmembers,  public  and  private  school  teachers,  and  church  groups.  In  addition,  meetings  and \nworkshops were held, and survey and study findings disseminated. International and domestic \nconsultants were used to design the Project. These domestic consultants, who were teachers \nand professors, analyzed the education sector issues extensively, identified the shortcomings \nand  helped  design  a  project  that  is  desirable  by  the  Government.  The  Project  will  pursue \npolicy,  institutional,  and  systematic  development  required  for  sustainable  improvement  in \nlearning  achievement  and  efficiency.  ADB  is  also  supporting  the  Government  in  preparing  a \nnew 9-year educational policy framework.9  \n\n48. \nBuilding  Stronger  Linkages  between  Quality  Inputs  and  Outcomes.  The  project \ndesign  focuses  on  learning  achievement  as  the  key  to  project  success.  The  design  takes  into \naccount  how  to  evaluate  the  impacts  of  new  curriculum,  assessment  system,  and  in-service \nteacher  training  on  learning  achievements.  The  TA  will  focus  on  establishing  sustainable \ncapacity  for  teacher  development.  It  will  identify  indicators  for  teacher  effectiveness  at  the \nclassroom level. The outcomes of various quality inputs will be evaluated for the project impact. \nAlthough  the  staff  of  the  Curriculum,  Material,  and  Assessment  Division  have  experience  with \nsecondary  curriculum  development  and  primary  learning  materials  development  through \nprevious  work  with  projects,  new  content  will  be  introduced  as  well  as  new  approaches \nintegrating  learning  assessments  with  the  curriculum.  The  project  design  emphasizes  the \nimportance  of  making  learning  enjoyable  by  using  student-centered  learning  and  modern \nmultimedia materials. To address equity issues and improve learning outcomes, approaches to \nbilingual education will be introduced.  \n\n49. \nCooperation  with  Bilateral  Funding  Agencies  and  Harmonization  with  the \nGovernment  System.  Extensive  consultations  were  taken  to  avoid  the  cofinanciers  taking  a \npiecemeal  approach  to  the  education  system.  In  addition,  the  Project  focuses  on  harmonizing \nthe procurement processes and reporting systems with the Government system and regulations. \nThe cooperation between cofinanciers and the harmonization of the reporting and procurement \nsystems will reduce the transaction costs for the Government, and burden of multiple reporting. \nThis  Project  will  be  financed  by  ADB,  AusAID,  NZAID,  and  the  Government  applying  a \ncofinancing  approach  and  harmonization  principles.  The  implementation  arrangements  are \n\n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2004.

The committee comprises a chair; the Government ombudsman; and \nrepresentatives from Advisory Committee for Special Needs Education, MESC, MOF, Ministry \nof  Foreign  Affairs,  National  Council  of  Churches,  National  Council  of  Early  Childhood \nEducation of Samoa Inc., NUS, Post-Primary Principals Association, and Samoa Polytechnic. \nThe  CEO  of  MESC  is  an  ex-officio  member  of  the  committee,  while  the  Office  of  the  CEO \n(OCEO)  provides  support  and  secretariat  services.  The  committee  will  meet  whenever \nnecessary,  but  not  less  than  once  every  quarter.  It  will  (i)  approve  project  progress  reports, \nendorse  proposed  operational  plans,  and  support  the  development  of  project  budgets,  (ii) \nprovide  overall  policy  and  strategic  guidance  on  project  implementation  and  decide  on \ncorrective  action,  if  needed,  (iii)  ensure  that  project  implementation  is  in  accordance  with \nGovernment education sector policies and plans, and (iv) resolve issues and conflicts that may \nemerge.  \n\n54.  MESC  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  the  day-to-day  management  of  project \nimplementation, monitoring and evaluation, and reporting of progress. At the operational level, \nthe Project will be managed by the MESC Core Executive, comprising the CEO and assistant \nCEOs, and supported by the OCEO and a project coordinator. All components of the Project \nwill  be  implemented  through  the  existing  MESC  organizational  structure.  Consulting  services \nwill be provided to strengthen capacity of the Core Executive to deliver the Project and other \nfuture  development  projects  effectively  under  component  5,  which  will  be  more  transient  in \nnature. The responsibility for each component will rest with the appropriate assistant CEO and \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\nbe  implemented  by  staff  of  the  relevant  division. They  will  prepare  the  6-monthly  review  and \nprogram of activities to be financed by the Government, ADB, AusAID and NZAID and liaise \non project implementation matters with ADB, AusAID and NZAID.   \n\nThe  Curriculum,  Material,  and  Assessment  Division  will  be  responsible  for  delivery  of \n55. \ncomponent  1,  and  the  School  Operation  Division  for  component  2.  The  current  project \nmanagement team, established for the ESP I, is planned to eventually become an integral part \nof  MESC\u2019s  organizational  structure  as  an  assets  management  unit.  It  will  have  responsibility \nfor  procurement  of  goods  and  services  for  all  components,  and  overall  responsibility  for \nimplementation  of  component  3. The  Planning,  Policy,  and  Research  Division  will  implement \ncomponent  4  relating  to  developing  a  research  and  analytical  capacity  as  well  as  policy  and \nplanning.  OCEO  or  MESC  Core  Executive  will  be  responsible  for  implementation  of \ncomponent 5. Two subcommittees will be established under components 2 and 3: (i) in-service \ntraining  subcommittee  consisting  of  assistant  CEOs  for  School  Operation  Division  and \nCurriculum,  Material,  and  Assessment  Division,  an  OCEO  representative,  and  principal \neducation  officers  for  in-service  training  and  primary  and  secondary  curriculum;  and  (ii) \ninfrastructure  subcommittee  composed  of  an  OCEO  representative,  the  head  of  the  project \nmanagement  team,  all  assistant  CEOs,  and  representatives  from  the  Ministry  of  Works  and \nMOF. The proposed organizational structure is attached in Appendix 8. \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period  \n\n56. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  6  years.  Loan  effectiveness  is  planned  for \nFebruary  2006,  and  project  completion  for  December  2012.  An  implementation  schedule  is \nattached in Appendix 9. \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n57. \nAll goods and services financed under the Project will be procured in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and Government guidelines for procurement acceptable to \nADB.10 The contract for the MESC headquarters estimated to cost more than $1,000,000 will \nbe  awarded  following  ADB\u2019s  international  competitive  bidding  procedures.  All  other  contracts \nunder  the  Project  will  be  awarded  following  local  competitive  bidding  in  accordance  with \nGovernment procedures. Each contract awarded on the basis local competitive bidding will be \nsubject to ADB\u2019s retroactive approval, provided that if the award or terms of any such contract \nare not approved by ADB, MOF will not use the loan proceeds to finance the contract and will \nprovide  financing  from  its  own  or  other  resources.  The  project  management  team  will  be \nresponsible  for  all  procurement. The  indicative  procurement  packages  are  listed  in  Appendix \n10.  \n\n58. \nAdvance  Procurement  Action.  For  early  commencement  of  project  implementation \nand  as  requested  by  the  Government,  ADB  approved  advance  procurement  action  for  civil \nworks,  covering  invitation  of  bids,  bidding,  and  bid  evaluation,  but  not  including  contract \nawards.  The  Government  has  been  advised  that  approval  of  the  advance  action  does  not \ncommit ADB to financing the Project.  \n\n                                                 \n10 Government  of  Samoa,  Tender  Board.  2003.

All  international  and  associated \ndomestic  consultants  will  be  selected  and  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic \nconsultants. All international consulting services will be provided by either firms or individuals, \nin  each  case  determined  by  MOF.  The  domestic  consulting  services  will  cover  all  services \nexcept  for  the  project  implementation.  The  Project  will  use  the  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection method for recruitment of firms. The Project includes a flexible provision for a pool of \ninternational  and  domestic  consultancies  for  MOF  to  meet  additional  needs  arising  during \nproject  implementation,  including  small  consulting  service  contracts  for  supervision  of  civil \nworks. The indicative summary of consulting inputs is in Appendix 11. The Project will provide \nconsultant  services  for  primary  curriculum  development,  assessment  system,  information \ncommunication  technology,  audiovisual  specialist,  bilingual,  primary  subject  area  specialist, \nadvocacy,  pre-service  and,  in-service  teacher  development,  public  opinion  assessment, \neducation equipment procurement, civil works, education research methods, education sector \nexpenditure  review,  education  sector  planning,  and  project  management  monitoring,  and \nevaluation. Supplementary Appendix B includes the outline terms of reference. \n\n \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Measures \n\n60. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed with the Government and \nMOF.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency, \nADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt, \nfraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts, \nrelevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  Loan  Regulations  and \nthe  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection  with  the  Project  will  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  MOF  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and \nother service providers as they relate to the Project. \n\n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements  \n\n61. \nAll  disbursements  under  the  ADB  loan  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLoan  Disbursement  Handbook.  To  facilitate  disbursements  and  project  implementation,  an \nimprest  account  will  be  established  by  the  Government  in  a  bank  acceptable  to  ADB.  The \ninitial amount to be deposited to the imprest account by ADB should not exceed $300,000 or \nthe  estimated  6  months  eligible  project  expenditures,  whichever  is  lower.  Statement  of \nexpenditure (SOE) procedures will be used to liquidate the imprest account.  \n\n62. \nSOE procedures will be used to reimburse eligible expenditures under activities funded \nby  ADB,  and  to  liquidate  advances  provided  to  the  imprest  account  in  accordance  with  the \nLoan  Disbursement  Handbook.  Each  individual  payment  reimbursed  or  liquidated  by  ADB \nunder the SOE procedures will not exceed $50,000 equivalent. On a quarterly basis or earlier, \nMOF  will  prepare  and  provide  the  SOE  report  for  liquidation  of  the  imprest  accounts  and \nwithdrawal application to ADB for replenishment. \n\n63. \nAusAID and NZAID grant funds will be deposited directly into a special account to be \nestablished by the Government. Under the partial administration arrangement, ADB, AusAID, \nand  NZAID  will  review  the  quarterly  SOE  reports  and  disburse  funds  based  on  6-month \nforward  plan  from  the  Government.  Information  on  all  disbursement  decisions  made  to  the \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\nproject by all donors will be shared with all other project donors. Eligibility of expenditures to \nbe financed under the project shall be in accordance with ADB Loan Disbursement Handbook.  \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n64.  MESC will maintain separate records and accounts for all expenditures to be financed \nby  the  Project  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles.  They  will  specify  the \nexpenditures for all activities and identify all expenditures to be financed by the Project. Project \naccounts, including financial statements, SOEs, and imprest account records, will be audited \nannually by auditors acceptable to all development partners. The auditors\u2019 report, and copies \nof  the  certified  accounts  and  related  financial  statements,  including  compliance  with  project \ncovenants and the use of the imprest accounts, will be submitted to all partners in English not \nlater  than  6  months  after  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year  to  which  they  relate.  Additional  financial \naudits and financial management and systems reviews may be undertaken by ADB, AusAID, \nand NSAID in accordance with agreed-upon rules and regulations. \n\n65.  MESC  will  prepare  a  single  report  each  quarter  on  all  implementation  activities  in  a \nformat  acceptable  to  all  the  project  cofinanciers.  MESC  will  provide  these  reports  to  the \ncofinanciers  as  well  as  each  member  of  the  Education  Steering  Committee,  within  30  days \nafter the end of the applicable period. Within 3 months after physical completion of the Project, \nMESC will submit a project completion report to ADB, AusAID, and NSAID. \n\n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n66. \nOperational Plans. In line with the Government budget cycle, every 6 months MESC \nwill prepare a forward program/operating plan for the following 6 months. This is expected to \ntake place in March (for the following fiscal year starting in July) and in October (at the time of \nthe Government budget review). The operational plan will outline what is to be funded under \nthe  Project.  It  will  include  (i)  data  on  the  proposed  allocations  to  primary  and  secondary \neducation  by  salary  and  nonsalary  items;  (ii)  status  of  agreed-upon  policy  reforms  and \ncovenants;  (iii)  fully  costed  project  activities  proposed  for  each  subcomponent,  with \nperformance  targets;  and  (iv)  a  list  of  secondary  schools  targeted  for  upgrading  during  the \nyear.  The  plan  will  also  provide  estimates  of  the  operation  and  maintenance  budget  and \nidentify the amount of counterpart funds to be provided. The review and forward program will \nbe the primary mechanism for the Government to request funding from AusAID and NZAID.  \n\n67.  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  MESC has  a monitoring  and  evaluation system that  will \nbe  strengthened  to  provide  improved  and  reliable  indicators  for  assessing  project  progress \n(Appendix 12). As part of the 6-monthly review and forward program cycle (para. 63), MESC \nwill provide a report on performance targets for the previous 6 months along with the forward \nprogram  plan.  The  process  will  include  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  implementation \nperformance,  provide  management  information,  and  assess  the  impact  of  the  Project  on \nlearning  outcomes.  Project  performance  monitoring  will  focus  upon  project  implementation \nplans  and \ntoward  project \nperformance  indicators.  For  example,  indicators  such  as  school  enrollments;  deployment  of \nscience  teachers  to  underprivileged  regions;  examination  results,  including  ongoing  school-\nbased  assessment  system;  and  the  effectiveness  of  trained  teachers  in  implementing  new \ncurriculum  and  assessment  system  will  be  used.  MESC  will  monitor  project  activities  using \ndata and feedback from schools, and data received from consultants. \n\ntheir  execution,  achievements,  and  progress \n\ntargets  and \n\n68.  MESC will monitor and evaluate the project outcomes, in accordance with the schedule \nand  terms  of  reference  agreed  upon,  by  the  Government,  ADB,  AusAID,  and  NZAID. \n\n\f17 \n\nPerformance  evaluations  will  examine  the  impact  of  project  interventions  on  learning \noutcomes, as can be measured by standardized assessment.  \n\n \n\n9.  \n\nProject Review \n\n69. \nDuring  the  first  year  of  the  Project,  the  Government,  ADB,  AusAID,  and  NZAID  will \nconduct a semiannual review of project performance. In subsequent years of the Project, the \nGovernment,  ADB,  AusAID,  and  NZAID  will  conduct  at  least  one  joint  project  review  per \nyear. This  joint  project  review will  include  an  examination  of  the  budgetary  allocations, \noperation  and  maintenance  costs,  staffing  and  other \nrecurrent  costs, \nimplementation  arrangements,  and  achievements  under  the  Project.  The  review  includes \nassessing progress in each component, identifying difficulties and constraints, and determining \nways to  overcome them. MESC  management,  specifically the  CEO  and  assistant  CEOs,  will \nbe a primary source of information for these reviews.  \n\nincremental \n\n70. \nIn  addition,  the  Government, ADB, AusAID,  and  NZAID  will jointly conduct  a  midterm \nreview  during  the  third  year  of  implementation.  This  will  (i)  review  the  scope,  design,  and \nproject  implementation  arrangements;  (ii)  evaluate  pilot  programs;  (iii)  assess  performance \nagainst targets and benchmarks; (iv) review lessons and experiences  with implementation of \neach  component;  (v)  review  compliance  with  the  loan  agreement  and  bilateral  funding \nagreement(s); and (vi) recommend any changes in project implementation, if required. \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits  \n\n71. \nThe Project will support developing new primary curriculum in Samoan, English, social \nsciences,  mathematics,  and  science,  with  supporting  learning  materials  and  extensive  in-\nservice teacher training. The assessment system  will  be reformed  and  strengthened  and the \nlearning  materials  established.  These \ncapacity \ninterventions  are  expected  to  improve  rural  students\u2019  learning,  thus  ensuring  they  acquire \nlanguage  skills,  have  more  opportunities  for  further  education  and  training,  and  are  able  to \nperform  better  in  the  formal  labor  market.  More  than  40,000  primary  school  students  will \nbenefit from investments. Children in disadvantaged areas will be the principal beneficiaries.  \n\nto  design  and  produce  high-quality \n\n72. \nThe  Project  will  support  more  equitable  provision  of  qualified  teachers.  For  primary \nschools, the Project  will support  a  pilot to retain qualified teachers in schools in remote rural \nlocations.  The  upgrading  of  secondary  school  facilities  in  disadvantaged  districts  to  national \nstandards  will  include  provision  of  equipment  and  furniture,  and  operation  and  maintenance \nfunds. The primary beneficiaries will be 15,000 rural children enrolled in secondary schools of \na national standard. This is expected to also improve primary school completion rates.  \n\nImpact on Poverty and Gender. Improved access to better education and training will \n73. \nincrease  the  participation  of  the  disadvantaged  in  the  formal  labor  market.  By  targeting  rural \nlocations,  gains  will  also  flow  into  the  local  economy.  Male  participation  in  higher  education \nand retention in rural areas will be improved. Special education needs will be fully taken into \naccount in the new curricula and upgraded school facilities. \n\nEnvironment  and  Social  Safeguards.  The  Project  will  involve  upgrading  and \n74. \nrehabilitating  existing  school \nfacilities  and  MESC  headquarters,  with  no  negative \nenvironmental or resettlement impact. No land acquisition or resettlement is required under the \nProject. All the land for the schools is already at the existing school sites and adequate for the \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\nadditional  classrooms  for  new  subject  curricula.  The  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social \nanalysis is in Appendix 13. \n\n75. \nEconomic Benefits and Financial Sustainability. International evidence finds a high \nsocial  and  economic  return  to  primary  and  secondary  education  investment.  In  Samoa, \nparticipation in secondary education is a prerequisite for entry into the formal labor market. In \n2000, a study on the private sector workforce found that 93% of the private sector workforce \nhad secondary education. Overseas remittances by Samoans working abroad constitute about \n17.4%  of  national  income  and  educational  qualifications  are  required  for  successful \nemigration.  Better  education  will  help  disadvantaged  groups  benefit  economically  from  the \nProject.  The  anticipated  social  benefits  are  the  foundation  for  Samoa\u2019s  commitment  to  the \nMillennium Development Goals.  \n\n76. \nDespite  considerable  Government  efforts,  the  education  sector  is  dependent  on \nexternal  assistance  grants  to  finance  development  as  well  as  nonsalary  recurrent  costs.  In \nrecent years between 20% and 45% of total sector funding has been in the form of grants and \nloans.  During  the  Fact-Finding  Mission,  a  financial  analysis  and  projection  model  was \ndeveloped, which suggests that with growth in the economy the Government will likely be able \nto  sustain  the  recurrent  costs  of  the  system  within  the  next  decade.  Funds  for  proposed \noperational and debt repayments are clearly identified in the project financing framework and \nwill be reflected in future Government budgets. Appendix 14 provides additional details on the \neconomic analysis, and financial and sustainability analyses.  \n\n77. \nThe  Project  will  provide  bridging  support  to  allow  continuity  in  the  provision  of  critical \nquality inputs. Policy analysis and dialogue during the preparation of the next 9-year plan will \ninclude  education  sector  financing  and  sustainability  issues.  The  Project  will  provide \noperational financing, and research and training programs aimed at strengthening policy and \nstrategy  development  to  support  improved  aid  coordination  and  transition  to  a  sector \napproach.  \n\n78. \nFinancial Management Assessment. A review of the financial management systems \nof  MOF  and  MESC  was  completed.11  This  review  and  a  World  Bank  financial  management \nassessment  conducted  by  a  qualified  accredited  financial  management  specialist  under  the \nCyclone Emergency Recovery Project in April 2004,12 indicate that the financial management \nsystems  and  procedures  proposed  for  the  Project  meet  ADB\u2019s  requirements.  A  summary  is \npresented in Appendix 15 with supporting details provided in Supplementary Appendix C. \n\nB. \n\nRisks  \n\n79. \nIncreasing Pressure on the Recurrent Budget. In Samoa, new investments must be \ncarefully assessed for their impact on the provision of nonsalary recurrent inputs. The Project \nprovides support for materials development, teacher training, and other quality enhancements \nand  adopts  a  bridging  strategy  that  provides  continuity.  The  development  of  a  sector  policy \nand  financing  framework  with  sustainable  operation  and  maintenance  costs\u2014supported  by \nADB and other development partners under the EPSP\u2014will address this risk.  \n\n80. \nInvestments in Civil Works May Not be Maintained. Many communities cannot meet \nthe costs of utilities and routine maintenance of buildings and equipment does not occur. This \n\n                                                 \n11 Financial assessment of MOF and MESC was undertaken during the Fact-Finding Mission for the Project from 30 \n\n12 Independent  State  of  Samoa;  Cyclone  Emergency  Recovery  Project;  Financial  Management  Assessment \n\nMay to 14 June.  \n\nSummary; Report No. T-7622. \n\n\f19 \n\nrisk  will  be  partly  offset  by  the  sector  policy  framework  being  developed,  which  will  provide \npolicies and procedures for maintenance and asset protection.  \n\n81. \nInvestments  in  Teacher  Training  May  Be  Lost  through  Attrition.  Retention  of \nteachers  with  expertise  is  difficult,  as  they  are  in  demand  by  the  private  sector  and/or  other \nGovernment  ministries.  Teacher  training,  particularly  in  information  and  communication \ntechnology,  may  contribute  to  attrition  from  the  profession  and  investments  could  be  lost. \nUnder the Project (and through building capacity for teacher development, policy development, \nand strategic planning), the Government will assess teacher development issues and develop \nstrategies to address them. Improvements in physical work environments and the introduction \nof innovative teaching techniques are expected to improve teacher job satisfaction. \n\nFacilities  May  Be  Underutilized  Due  to  Patterns  of  Internal  Migration.  Some \n82. \nsecondary  schools  have  very  low  enrollments  and  are  in  close  proximity.  In  such  instances, \nefficiency  could  be  improved  by  rationalizing  school  provision.  A  detailed  forecast  of  future \ndemand for secondary schools to be upgraded under the Project has been undertaken. ADB, \nAusAID,  and  NZAID  will  continue  policy  dialogue  on  rationalization  of  the  education  system \nand  will  assist  MESC  in  developing  student  flow  and  simulation  models  for  more  efficient \ninvestments in civil works. \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n83. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n84. \nThe  government  will  commission  an  external  review  of  the  efficiency  of  procurement \nmethods  and  contracts  packaging  for  equipment  and  materials  procured  under  ESP  I  and \ndiscuss the findings during the Project inception and agree with the ADB, AusAID, and NZAID \non the remedial measures to be taken based on such review prior to engaging in procurement \nunder this Project. \n\n85.  Within  12  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  (i)  develop  an  evidence \nbased Education, Sports and Culture Policy and Strategic Plan (2006-2014) for the education \nsector,  including  impact  studies  on  poverty  alleviation  and  targeted  support  to  the \neconomically  disadvantaged;  (ii)  provide  a  copy  of  such  strategic  plan  to  ADB,  AusAID, \nNZAID,    and  other  relevant  development  partners  for  review  and  comments  prior  to  tabling \nsuch plan for cabinet approval; (iii) consider comments from ADB, AusAID, and NZAID prior to \ntabling such policy and plan for approval; and (iv) table it for cabinet approval.  \n\n86.  Within  3  year  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  (i)  develop  a  policy  and \nstrategy on teacher supply and demand and conditions of service based on, inter alia, (a) the \nfindings and recommendations of the supply and demand study supported under ESP I;13 (b) \nanalyses  and  recommendations  that  will  emerge  from  the  TA  for  National  Teacher \nDevelopment Framework, (c) findings of pilot projects on teacher housing financed under the \nProject,  (ii)  provide  the  policy  and  strategy  to  ADB  and  bilateral  donors  for  review  and \ncomments,  (iii)  consider  comments  from  ADB  and  the  bilateral  donors  prior  to  tabling  such \npolicy  and  strategy  for  approval,  and  (iv)  table  it  for  cabinet  approval  (v)  and  implement  it  in \naccordance with its terms.  \n\n                                                 \n13 ADB.  2000.

Samoa. \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n87.  Within  3  years  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  ensure  that  a  system  to \nassess student learning outcomes and the impact of the project investments is in place. This \nwill  include  developing  a  sample  based  standardized  system  for  the  assessment  of  student \nlearning  that  will  be  used  as  a  baseline  for  reporting  of  progress  towards  key  performance \nindicators.  \n\n88. \n The  Government  will  cause  submission  of  a  satisfactory  maintenance  plan  by  the \nrespective  communities  as  a  condition  precedent  to  their  schools  being  upgraded  under  the \nProject. \n\n89. \nThe  Government  will  take,  and  shall  cause  MOF  and  MESC  to  take,  all  necessary \nmeasures,  including  the  provision  of  additional  funds,  to  ensure  that  sufficient  counterpart \nfunds are made available and provided for the Project in a timely manner.  \n\n90.  Within  the  Project  period,  the  Government  will  develop  and  implement  a  plan  for  the \nrationalization of schools to ensure resources are used cost-effectively.  \n\n91.  MESC  will  cause  the  contractors  to  maximize  the  employment  of  local  persons  in \nparticular  those  who  suffer  hardship,  who  meet  the  job  and  efficiency  requirements  for  the \nconstruction, rehabilitation, and maintenance of Project facilities. Contractors shall be required \nto give due consideration to the contribution of local women for the construction, rehabilitation, \nand maintenance of Project facilities.  \n\n92. \n\nThe Government will ensure that the Project will not entail any involuntary resettlement.  \n\n93.  Within  3  years  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  have  (i)  developed \ninformation  and \ncomprehensive  action  plans  satisfactory \ncommunication  technology  education  in  secondary  schools,  and  (ii)  taken  appropriate \nmeasures  based  on  the  lessons  learned  from  the  ADB-supported  SchoolNet  pilot  project \n(footnote 6) to expand outreach to rural areas.  \n\nto  mainstream \n\nto  ADB \n\n94.  Within  3  years  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  develop  and  implement  a \nplan  for  every  child  to  have  a  complete  set  of  textbooks  that  will  address  issues  of  finance, \nprocurement,  storage,  distribution,  and  school  based  policies  to  extend  the  life  of  textbooks. \nThe  Government  will  allocate  adequate  funding  in  the  education  budget  for  financing  the \ndevelopment and implementation of this plan. \n\n95. \nThe Government shall jointly undertake with ADB, AusAID, and NZAID two reviews of \nthe Project in the first year of Project Implementation, a review of the Project each subsequent \nyear and a midterm review of the Project at the end of the third year of Project Implementation. \n\nB. \n\nCondition for Loan Effectiveness \n\nThe Government shall have entered into a binding agreement with AusAID and NZAID \n\n96. \nfor the cofinancing of the Project. \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \n97. \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove: \n\n(i) \n\nthe loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawings Rights 5,655,000 \nto  the  Independent  State  of  Samoa  for  the  Education  Sector  Project  II  from \n\n\f21 \n\nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per \nannum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  a  term  of  32 \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years and such other terms and conditions \nas  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan \nAgreement presented to the Board;  \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nADB administering the grant under the terms of partial administration modality \nin  an  amount  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $8,600,000.0  to  be  provided  by \nthe Government of Australia for the purposes of partly funding the Project; and  \n\nADB administering the grant under the terms of partial administration modality \nin  an  amount  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  amount  of  $8,600,000.0  to  be \nprovided by the Government of New Zealand for the purposes of partly funding \nthe Project. \n\nJOSEPH B.

National  examinations \nare held in years 8 and 12. For year 13, a regional examination provides access to the university \npreliminary  year.  The  National  University  of  Samoa,  Samoa  Polytechnic,  and  some  other \npostsecondary  institutions  in  Apia  offer  postsecondary  education.  The  Ministry  of  Education, \nSports,  and Culture (MESC) is responsible for policy formulation,  guidance, and supervision  of \nall government schools and institutions. Village committees run and secondary schools and are \nresponsible  for  setting,  collecting,  and  spending  school  fees;  constructing  and  maintaining \nbuildings;  and  providing  consumables.  The  Government  funds  teachers\u2019  salaries,  some \nconsumables, and initial sets of textbooks every 5 years for primary schools. The exceptions are \nfour government senior colleges, one on Savai\u2019i and three on Upolu, which are fully government \nfunded. \n\nThe Government has made considerable progress since adopting education policies and \n2. \nstrategies for 1995\u20132005. Among them are development and provision of textbooks and learning \nresources for primary education, a new secondary curriculum, upgrading of facilities in primary \nand  secondary  schools,  establishment  of  an  education  resource  center  on  Savai\u2019i,  and \nexpansion  of  special  needs  education  and  early  childhood  education.  MESC  management \ncapacity  has  been  strengthened.  A  comprehensive  management  information  system  has  been \ndeveloped. Long-term policies and strategies have been elaborated in a framework designed for \nfuture policy, strategy, and corporate planning. \n\nB. \n\nAccess and Equity \n\n3. \nGenerally children throughout Samoa have access to primary and secondary education. \nGender  equity  is  not  a  serious  issue.  However  not  all  children  participate.  In  2004,  40,137 \nstudents  were  enrolled  in  primary  education  (69%  of  the  age  group)  up  from  39,639  in  2003. \nAvailable  data  indicate  that  net  enrollment  in  primary  education  declined  from  77%  in  1995  to \n69% in 2004. Since 1995, the participation rate (gross enrollment rate in primary education has \nremained around 97%. Between 1995 and 2004, secondary enrollment increased by 11% from \n13,298 to 14,766. The net enrollment rate has progressively improved from 36% to 43%. While \nthe  female  primary  enrollment  rate  was  lower  (48%),  female  secondary  enrollment  was  higher \n(52%). Of the 160 primary schools, about 9% are church schools and 3% are private schools. Of \nthe 46 secondary schools, 41% are church schools and 4% are private schools; the remainder \nare public schools.  \n\n4. \nAbout 84% of year 1 entrants were retained at year 8 (retention rate), and 88% of year 8 \ngraduates went on to year 9 (transition rate), up from 82% in 1994/95. In 2004, 77% of year 9 \nentrants  completed  year  12  and  57%  of  the  year  12  graduates  continued  on  to  year  13,  an \nincrease  of  10% from  1995.  However,  more than  half of the year  13 students do  not complete \nschooling. \n\n5. \nEvery village has a primary school. Clusters of villages make up districts and each district \nhas a secondary school with the bigger ones having two. Theoretically access to schools should \nnot be an issue. Recent community consultations identified the condition of school facilities as an \nimportant  source  of  dissatisfaction.  Although  many  primary  schools  and  some  secondary \nschools have been upgraded in recent years, schools in the poorer areas still operate in facilities \nthat  do  not  meet  national  standards,  often  without  proper  classrooms  and  equipment. \nSubstandard schools convey an image of poor quality service, create an apathetic teaching and \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nlearning  environment,  and  can  result  in  low  student  learning  and  high  dropout.  Access  and \nequity  in  education  are  also  related  to  languages  of  instruction,  particularly  English  in  the  later \nyears  of  schooling.  Although  predominantly  in  Samoan  in  the  first  3  years  of  primary  grades, \nEnglish  competency  becomes  a  major  factor  toward  late  primary  and  all  of  secondary  school. \nNational policy requires pluralistic bilingualism; the acquisition of English while maintaining and \ndeveloping  Samoan.  Rural  children  have  less  access  to  social  conditions  that  enable  greater \ncompetency  and  fluency  in  English.  Although  English  seems  to  play  a  major  part  in  formal \nschooling, Samoan must be equally addressed because Samoan competency becomes crucial \nin adulthood when people take on various roles in their families, in the workplace, and in society \nat large. Bilingualism is therefore a key factor in access and equity. Access is also limited due to \nother  factors  such  as  inability  to  pay  (hardship),  migration,  and  social  priorities  other  than \neducation upon which expenditures are made. \n\nC. \n\nQuality \n\n6. \nGraduates  have  low  levels  of  functional  literacy  and  numeracy.  This  results  from  an \neducation system that fails to prepare students for higher learning. Achievement tests conducted \nat primary level (Samoa primary education literacy level [SPELL] one, SPELL two, and the year \n8 examination) and at secondary level (year 12 examination) indicate that achievement is below \nexpectations and, in a number of subject areas, declining. The SPELL one test results show that \na  record  57%  of  children  are  at  risk  in  year  4.  Since  1995,  improvements  have  been  made  in \nSamoan literacy, but 30% of children are still at risk of not achieving the required literacy level; in \nnumeracy, 33% are at risk. The SPELL two test results (for year 6 students) are even more of a \nconcern.  Results  in  English  deteriorated  from  14%  at  risk  in  2001  to  57%  at  risk  in  2003.  For \nSamoan,  they  declined  slightly  from  14%  to  16%;  while  the  numeracy  results  increased  from \n55% in 2001 to 73% in 2003. However, an analysis of district figures shows disparities that point \nto  faults  in  the  tests,  If  MESC  continues  to  use  these  tests  they  must  be  re-examined  and \nvalidated. The assessment system needs careful reexamination. \n\nThe  mean  (raw)  scores  on  the  year  8  examinations  in  all  subjects  from  1997  to  2002 \n7. \nshow  a  steady  decline  in  all  mean  scores.  On  a  scale  of  100,  English  declined  from  42  to  37, \nSamoan  59  to  47,  mathematics  30  to  28.7,  basic science  39  to  24.8,  and  social  science  42  to \n25.8. SPELL one and two and the year 8 examinations indicate declines in quality. More year 4 \nand  6  students  are  at  risk  and  year  8  examination  results  continue  to  decline.  By  these  more \ndirect and objective measures of education  quality, the situation in primary  grades is a serious \nconcern.  \n\nStudents completing secondary school and passing examinations to enter postsecondary \n8. \nand  university  courses  are  deficient  in  basic  numeracy  and  literacy  skills.  Many  secondary \nschools  do  not  offer  one  or  more  applied  subjects  due  to  lack  of  teachers,  materials,  or \nequipment. At secondary level, scores on the year 12 examination generally declined over the 5 \nyears between 1997 and 2002, but increased in 2003. If this trend is maintained, it could reflect \nthe efforts of recent projects aimed at improving the quality of secondary education.  \n\n9. \nThe  primary  school  curriculum  is  problematic;  it  is  about  25  years  old.  Also  absent  are \nclear  guidelines  of  expected  learning  outcomes  set  for  literacy  and  numeracy  skills,  as  well  as \nsocial and cultural skills that children should master as they progress through primary school. An \nupdated  curriculum  policy  framework  and  subject  and  year-level  curriculum  statements  that \nemphasize  more  active,  child-centered  learning  activities  in  the  classroom,  strengthening  of \npedagogical  teaching  skills,  and  a  range  of  classroom  assessment  techniques,  is  essential  for \nhigh-quality teaching and learning. The Government intends to develop an integrated curriculum \nfor primary years 1\u20133 and subject-specific curricula in seven subject areas for years 4\u20138, which \ntake into account bilingual needs. Ensuring citizens are fluent in both Samoan and English is an \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n29 \n\nobjective  of  the  Government,  and  an  effective  bilingual  policy  and  program  is  a  priority.  A \nsecondary  education  curriculum  framework  for  years  9\u201313  is  being  implemented.  The  primary \ncurriculum  needs  to  be  reviewed;  teachers  provided  with  manuals,  textbooks,  and  learning \nmaterials; and related in-service training programs designed. More effective instructional practice \nwill  also  have  to  include  an  effective  use  of  assessment.  Modern  assessment  strategies  have \nbeen  introduced  in  recent  curriculum  projects  supported  by  development  partners.  These  are, \nhowever, not yet widely applied.  \n\n10. \nThe  supply  of  learning  materials  to  schools  to  date  has  largely  been  dependent  on \nprojects  undertaken  by  external  assistance  agencies  with  the  Government.  Present  quantities \nare insufficient. Books are typically shared, remain in school, and generally are not available for \nhomework  and  personal  study  purposes.  Shortages  have  been  reported  to  force  students  to \ncopy  material  from  the  blackboard.  Many  primary  teachers  have  been  trained  in  more  learner-\ncentered teaching and assessment methods, but learning materials are still based on the older \ncurriculum.  The  new  curriculum  framework  (years  1\u201313),  including  the  introduction  of  bilingual \neducation  in  primary  schools,  will  create  a  significant  need  for  new  textbooks,  student \nworkbooks, and other learning materials. Moreover supplementary materials such as readers (in \nSamoan and English) and audiovisual materials are in short supply. Shortages of teaching and \nlearning resources unfavorably affect teaching effectiveness and impair the ability of teachers to \nuse new improved teaching practices that the new curricula call for. \n\nTeachers play the leading role in delivering quality education. Well-trained teachers with \n11. \nadequate  skills  to  transmit  knowledge  and  manage  classrooms  are  in  short  supply.  Primary \nteacher  attrition  rates  are  as  high  as  5%  annually.  Unless  corrective  action  is  taken  to  reduce \nattrition,  the  output  of  the  preservice  program  will  need  to  double.  At  the  secondary  level,  the \ngrowth  in  enrollments  will  require  an  increase  in  the  output  of  the  preservice  programs. \nSignificant  shortages  can  be  expected  in  sciences,  economics,  and  accounting.  In  addition, \nteachers need to be trained in the new curriculum that will be introduced. \n\nThe  importance  of  having  well-trained  teachers  is  realized  and  the  Government  has \n12. \nimplemented  a  number  of  projects  aimed  at  improving  teaching.  The  Primary  Education \nMaterials  Project  Phase  I  (1998-2000)  and  Phase  II  (2000-2004)  have  provided  in-service \ntraining  for  2,753  primary  school  teachers.  The  Samoa  Secondary  Education  Curriculum  and \nResources  Project  and  Education  Sector  Project  I  provided  in-service  training  for  2,489 \nsecondary  teachers.  However,  some  teachers  express  a  lack  of  understanding  of  how  to  put \nnew curriculum and teaching methods into practice in the classroom. \n\nD. \n\nEfficiency  \n\n13. \nThe trend in repetition rates (the percentage of children remaining in the same grade) in \nprimary  education  has  been  variable  over  the  years.  Rates  for  some  grades  have  increased; \nothers have decreased. The average repetition  rate in  primary schools has fluctuated  between \n1.1% and 2.1%. In 1995, the rate was 2.0%, in 2003 it was 2.1%, and in 2004 1.7%. Repetition \nrates  in  secondary  schools  also  have  generally  improved  since  1995,  but  remain  high  at  the \nupper  grades.  Repetition  rates  are  highest  for  years  12  and  13  where  screening  examinations \nare imminent. \n\nIn 2003, the repetition rate was high in years 1 (6%) and 8 (4%), 11 (5%), 12 (10%), and \n14. \n13  (9%).  The  dropout  rate  in  years  1\u20132  was  5%,  and  increased  to  9%  in  years  8\u20139.  The \nsecondary school dropout rate was high in years 10\u201311 (12%) and 12\u201313 (38%), indicating that \nmore  than  half  of  secondary  school  students  drop  out  before  completing  the  cycle. The  trends \nare  positive,  but  the  high  dropout  from  year  1  is  a  concern  given  the  objective  of  primary \neducation for all. Dropout in years 8\u20139 through 12\u201313 has improved but remains high. The high \ndropout  in  years  12\u201313  can  be  attributed  to  students  discontinuing  their  education  after  the \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nPacific senior secondary certificate. One main cause of dropping out is the low level of learning \noutcomes, as demonstrated in the year-end examinations. Another cause seems to be related to \nhigh  tuition  fees.  The  factors  affecting  education  quality  are  many  and  are  interlinked,  hence \ndifficult  to  untangle.  It  is  clear  that  curriculum,  materials,  assessment  systems,  pre-  and  in-\nservice teacher training, and Samoan language of instruction are among the important factors.  \n\n15. \nTwo  other  indicators  are  often  used  for  efficiency:  completion  and  transition  rates. \nCompletion  rate  is  difficult  to  calculate  for  lack  of  data.  A  rough  recalculation  indicates  about \n75.6% children  entering year  1  will  complete year  8  after  8  years and  35.5%  of youth  entering \nyear 9 will complete year 13 after 5 years. The transition rate from primary to lower secondary \nhas  increased  since  1996.  However,  the  rate  from  lower  to  upper  secondary  education  has \ndeclined.  The  transition  rate  from  year  12  to  year  13  has  increased  since  1996,  but  in  2003 \nremained  the  same  as  it  was  in  1999.  In  2004,  the  rate  increased  markedly  from  52%  to  57% \ndue perhaps to efforts to extend year 13 to all secondary schools.  \n\nE. \n\nRelevance  \n\n16. \nThe education system serves two labor markets: internal and external. The internal labor \nmarket  centers  upon  agriculture,  fishery,  construction  and  transportation,  and  small  business. \nManufacturing and services sectors have been increasing recently. Yet, few formal wage paying \npositions are available in the country for highly trained technicians or skilled workers. As a result, \na  large  number  of  Samoans  (35.4%  of  the  resident  population  of  Samoa)  live  overseas  and \nmany hold such jobs. The funds they repatriate represent about 17.4% of national income. Many \nSamoan youth also study in universities overseas prior to returning to the country. The education \nsystem, therefore, must serve two client groups with different aspirations and choices. An effort \nis  being  made  to  do  so  by  replacing  the  two-track  secondary  education  system  with  a  system \nproviding  a  compulsory  general  education  with  elective  applied  subjects.  Providing  the  basic \ngeneral knowledge  and skills needed to  move  to  higher levels of  education,  while  at the same \ntime providing relevant job skills, is challenging.  \n\nProviding secondary students with a good general education helps make them trainable. \n17. \nIt  also  prepares  them  for  higher  education.  Providing  skills  training  in  addition  to  general \neducation can be valuable as well, but the course content must remain relevant. It is suggested \nthat, the Government should assign qualified teachers; increase budget; and improve teaching of \napplied  subjects  such  as  agriculture  science,  design  technology,  carpentry,  and  textile  at  the \nsecondary level to make the system effective. \n\n18. \nAn  average  of  about  4,350  youth  leave  school  each  year.  The  majority  enter  the  labor \nforce,  but  few  find  formal  employment.  Primary  production  allows  a  livelihood  for  many \nSamoans,  yet  increased  Government  investment  is  needed  in  technical  education  aimed  at \nimproving  sector  productivity.  Low  investment  in  agricultural  skill  reinforces  the  low  image  that \nwork  in  the  primary  sector  has  among  people.  Therefore,  government  investment  in  this  area \nwould be both pro-poor and growth oriented.  \n\nF. \n\nFinance  \n\n19. \nEducation, consistently the largest single item in the national budget, averaged between \n15.5%  and  19%  per  annum  during  the  past  5  years.  External  assistance  through  grants  for \nspecific  programs  is  provided  by  many  donors.  ADB  is  the  only  lending  agency.  Parent \ncontributions  to  primary  and  secondary  education  through  fees  are  minimal.  Fees  are \ndetermined  by  individual  school  committees.  Generally  the  income  is  sufficient  only  to  pay  for \nbasic utilities.  \n\n20. \nAn important issue concerns the high level of salary expenditure in the recurrent budget. \nAt  about  95%,  it  is  well  above  that  of  most  countries  (with  the  exception  of  other  Pacific \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n31 \n\ncountries).  Very  few  resources  are  left  for  other  operational  expenditures.  This  is  a  concern  in \nview of the need to raise the morale of teachers and the need for new teachers. The inability of \nmany  communities  to  provide  funds  for  school  maintenance  is  another  concern.  As  the \neducation  sector  is  already  a  primary  recipient  of  government  budgetary  support,  opportunities \nfor  increasing  overall  government  expenditure  on  education  may  be  limited.  The  only  likely \nopportunities for generating additional resources may be improvements in efficiency.  \n\nG. \n\nManagement  \n\n21.  MESC  is  responsible  for  education  policy,  planning,  and  administration  of  government \nprimary  and  secondary  schools.  It  liaises  with  churches  and  private  schools  to  which  the \nGovernment  provides  an  annual  per  capita  grant  (ST2,550,000  in  2004/05).  Early  childhood \neducation  and  special  education  remain  outside  MESC  administration,  but  the  status  is  being \nreviewed  and  may  be  administered  by  MESC  in  the  near  future.  Operational  administration  of \nMESC is the responsibility of the chief executive officer (CEO) who oversees the work of seven \ndivisions:  (i)  school  operations;  (ii)  curriculum  materials  and  assessment;  (iii)  policy,  planning, \nand  research;  (iv)  corporate  services;  (v)  sports;  (vi)  culture;  and  (vii)  Savai\u2019i  divisions.  An \nassistant CEO heads each division. Management oversight within MESC is the responsibility of \nthe Core Executive, which meets weekly and consists of the CEO (chair), assistant CEOs, head \nof the Institutional Strengthening Project, and manager of the Education Sector Project I project \nmanagement team. Policies are implemented by way of corporate planning, introduced on a tri-\nannual basis from 2000. The effectiveness of implementation is reviewed annually and prior to \nthe preparation of the next medium-term corporate plan. \n\n22.  MESC  has  prepared  a  school  management  and  organization  manual.  The  manual \noutlines  the  responsibilities  of  the  community,  school  committee,  school  principal,  parents, \nstudents,  and  school  review  officer.  Facilities  and  equipment  maintenance  procedures  are \ndescribed. It outlines the school annual plan. Schools will prepare annual plans in collaboration \nwith  school  committees.  These  include  school  improvement  plans,  budgets,  curriculum,  and \nmaintenance  plans.  A  minimum  standard  baseline  checklist  has  been  developed  and  can  be \nused to identify schools where management, leadership, or other training may still be required. \n\n23. \nDespite major undertakings, weaknesses remain, hampering efforts to improve efficiency \nand  effectiveness  of  service  delivery.  The  education  management  information  system  is \noperating  effectively,  and  provides  detailed  education  statistics,  but  they  are  not  always  used \nand  uncertainties  remain  on  key  indicators  such  as  gross  and  net  enrollment  rates.  The \nassessment system needs to be revised to be useful for managing and monitoring quality. The \nresearch  capacity  needs  to  be  strengthened  if  it  is  to  help  address  key  questions  of  education \npolicy.  Innovations  need  to  be  piloted,  evaluated,  and  when  successful,  expanded  nationwide \nPolicies and procedures for school and community development planning have been developed \nand  piloted.  They  need  to  be  implemented  and  supported  by  training  and  financial  resources. \nSchool management committees have been established but their roles and responsibilities need \nto  be  clarified  and  their  capacities  developed.  The  potential  of  information  and  communication \ntechnology  in  strengthening  the  capacity  of  education  sector  management  needs  to  be \ndeveloped. \n\nAn  important  management  challenge  is  to  increase  the  effectiveness  of  external  aid  to \n24. \nthe  sector.  The  short\u2013term  focus  of  projects,  overlap  and  duplication  of  objectives  and \ninvestments,  fragmentation  of  effort,  and  multiple  planning  and  reporting  requirements  weaken \nthe  overall  impact  of  aid.  Aid  coordination  has  improved  in  recent  years,  but  the  Government \nneeds to take a leadership role and agencies need to agree formally on arrangements to align \nagency  objectives  and  Government  priorities  and  harmonize  procedures  and  processes  for  a \nsector approach including joint reviews and cofinancing. \n\n \n\n\fAusAID \n\nECE \n\n2001 \n\n23,000 Upgrade facilities

reports, tender \ndocuments, and contracts for civil works \nto be approved by the attorney general\u2019s \noffice.  \nWith the early 2002 public service \nreform, all architectural and construction \nsupervisory work had to be outsourced. \nOutsourcing was a new experience for \nthe ESP I. The liability period must be \nincluded in the new contract.  \nStudents and teachers are not using the \nequipment (computers) due to lack of \ntechnical support and/or maintenance. \nTechnical support should be ensured for \ninstallation of computers and other \nsophisticated office equipment. \nMaintenance support should be more \nreadily available. \n\nCommunities in disadvantaged areas \noften cannot provide necessary furniture \nfor their schools. This has resulted in \nsome schools having the necessary \nfurniture, while in others students are \nsitting on the floor because the \ncommunity cannot afford to provide the \nneeded furniture.  \nProjects are successful when the \n\nA template was prepared to use for \nsubproject appraisal reports, tender \ndocuments and contracts to be endorsed \nby the attorney general. \n\nThe liability period will be included in \nfuture contract agreements.  \n \n\nThe Project will ensure that technical \nsupport is provided for installation of \ncomputers and other sophisticated office \nequipment. Through regular supervision, \nthe Project will ensure that maintenance \nsupport is readily available and proper \nmaintenance is observed to avoid \nmishandling of equipment. Through \nschool supervision and training, the \nschool review officers and school \nprincipals will be asked to allow students \nto use the computers. \nThe Project will provide better planning \nin the allocation and distribution of \nfurniture. A full set of furniture should be \nprovided to schools supported by the \nProject either by the community or, if not \npossible, by the Project.  \n\nAn assurance will be obtained from the \n\n\fProject \n\nObjective \n\nLesson Learned \n\nturnover of experienced staff from the \nproject management team is reduced.  \nThis is also true for experienced teaches \nas well. To retain experienced staff, \nsalaries must be matched with the \nmarket and a new salary followed by the \nproject management team. \nGiven the number of students in Samoa, \nrelatively small numbers of materials are \nrequired for procurement. The numbers \noften are too small to attract the attention \nof international bidders using \ninternational shopping. Therefore, either \nthe quantities need to be increased by \ncombining orders for other commodities \nor direct procurement should be allowed. \nDirect procurement is now being \napproved by ADB if the order is itemized.\nA comprehensive curriculum framework \nis essential before developing learning \nmaterials and teachers\u2019 manuals; it will \nimprove the impact on student learning. \nTeachers also need to be trained in \nimplementing new learning materials.  \n\nEffective adoption of pedagogical \npractices by teachers as a result of the \nintroduction of new materials and in-\nservice courses need to be evaluated on \nan ongoing basis to ensure teacher \neffectiveness. \nImpact of new curriculum and in-service \ntraining on student learning \nachievements should be assessed by \nstandardized assessment. \n\nAppendix 3Appendix 5 \n\n35 \n\nAction Taken \nGovernment that new salary structure by \nthe Public Service Commission should \nbe followed for hiring of the project \nmanagement team. \n\nThese lessons will be used during the \nprocurement. \n\nThe Project will have a comprehensive \ncurriculum framework to introduce new \ncurriculum, learning materials, teaching \nmanual, and corresponding in-service \ntraining. \n \n \nThe Project will have a system of \nquantitative and qualitative (classroom \nobservation) research/assessment to \nevaluate the impact of new curriculum \nand in-service teacher training on \nstudent learning outcomes. \nThe Project will develop standardized \ntest instruments for assessing learning \noutcomes. \n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n4\n\n3\n5\n\n \n\nImprove quality of \nprimary education by \nproviding learning \nmaterials. \n\nAustralian Agency for \nInternational \nDevelopment \n(AusAID)-funded \nPrimary Education \nMaterials Project I \nand II \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nProject \n \n\n \n\nNew Zealand Agency \nfor International \nDevelopment-funded \nSamoa Secondary \nEducation Curriculum \nand Resources \nProject \nAusAID-funded \nInstitutional \nStrengthening Project \n\n \n\n \n\nObjective \n\nLesson Learned \n\nAction Taken \n\nAssessment of learning and planning \nintervention programs to address student \nlearning difficulties is important to \nimprove/equalize learning outcomes for \nspecial needs students. \n\n3\n6\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n4\n \n\ni\n\nThe Project will address the issue by \nexpanding the range and quality of \nstudent assessment, student feedback, \nand reporting on student achievement.

These  issues  contribute  to  (i) \nlow  levels  of  student  achievements  and  of  functional  literacy  and  numeracy,  even  among  the \nhigh-school graduates; (ii) inequitable access to quality schooling among the disadvantaged; (iii) \nhigh repetition and dropout rates; (iv) higher turnover of teachers; and (v) irrelevant curriculum.  \n\nTeacher  quality  is  one  reason  for  the  low  quality  of  education.  While  the  curriculum  is \n2. \nbeing modernized and new teaching resources are being developed, a similar investment is not \nbeing made in teacher development. As a result, both pre- and in-service teacher training has \nnot kept pace with the rapidly changing knowledge, skills, and dispositions required by the new \ncurriculum,  teaching  approaches,  and  teaching  resources.  Given  the  urgency  of  the  concern \nabout  teacher  quality,  recent  teacher  training  interventions  have  targeted  in-service  training \nsupported  by  external  funding,  which  are  not  sustained.  Such  project-based  training  provides \ntemporary  relief  but  also  creates  a  gap  between  pre-  and  in-service  teacher  training  and \ndifferent  levels  of  teacher  proficiency.  The  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  help    the  design  and \ndevelopment of the teacher training activities planned in the Education Sector Project II. \n\n3. \nTo increase the efficiency of the education system, long-term prioritized and sequenced \nsector  reform,  and  teacher  development  need  to  be  addressed  the  Strategy  for  the \nDevelopment of Samoa, 2002-2004. Such an approach with an investment plan will allow better \ncoordination  of  education  assistance,  and  responsiveness  of  education  services  to  supply \nappropriately trained teachers for the different grades and subject specialization.  \n\nII. \n\nTHE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Output \n\nThe  TA  is  to  help  the  Government  develop  a  comprehensive  system  for  development \n4. \nand management of high-quality teachers. The outputs will be (i) an institutional structure with \nnecessary  legislation  to  manage  and  monitor  the  quality  of  teacher  development;  (ii)  a  set  of \npolicies  and  procedures  to  manage  all  activities  associated  with  teacher  development,  quality, \nand  supply;  (iii)  an  agreed  financial  planning,  management,  and  monitoring  system  for  the \nreform of teacher development with detailed budgeting and funding options; and (iv) an agreed \npartnership  between  all  stakeholders  involved  in  teacher  development.  The  TA  output  will  be \npresented  in  a  single  comprehensive  report  compiled  from  the  individual  reports.  The  design \nand monitoring framework is in Table A5.1. \n\nB. \n\nCost and Financing  \n\n5. \nThe total cost of the TA is estimated to be $450,000 equivalent, of which $281,000 is the \nforeign  exchange  cost  and  $169,000  equivalent  the  local  currency  cost  (Table  A5.2).  The \nGovernment  has  asked  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  finance  $350,000  (78%) \nequivalent,  covering  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $69,000  equivalent  of  the  local \ncurrency  cost.  The  TA  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program.  The \n                                                 \n1  Government of Samoa. 2002.

During  the  first  phase, \n6. \nstakeholder  consultation  will  be  undertaken  to  ensure  ownership  of  the  recommendations \nincluded in the reports and the eventual national teacher development framework (NTDF). This \nwill  involve  five  formal  workshops  to  consider  alternative  approaches  to  developing  and \nmanaging an NTDF. During phase one, existing education documents; census data on teacher \nrecruitments  and  student  enrollments;  teacher  supply;  demand,  and  quality;  available  financial \nresources;  and  absorptive  capacity  of  teacher  development  activities  will  be  reviewed.  The \nreview  will  cover  capacity  and  quality  of  all  teacher  training  institutions  in  the  country  and  the \nprograms  offered  by  them.  A  short  sample  survey  will  be  conducted  to  collect  disaggregated \ndata  for  net  teacher  demand  and  supply,  academic  and  teaching  qualifications,  demands  for \nsubject  specialization,  teacher  incentive  schemes,  support  from  education  administrators,  and \nissues related to quality service provision. The information will be used to identify the extent of \nthe  gap  between  teachers\u2019  current  competencies  and  those  expected  to  implement  the  new \ncurriculum,  and  interventions  required  for  the  development  of  an  NTDF  that  would  ensure \ncapacity for sustained development and management of well-trained teachers. \n\nDuring  the  second  phase,  the  TA  will  assist  the  Government  in  developing  a  policy \n7. \nframework to  help  articulate the  NTDF by outlining its priorities for pre- and in-service teacher \ndevelopment.  The  policy  framework  will  include  minimum  standards  for  (i)   academic  and \nprofessional competencies for primary and secondary teachers and for each subject; (ii) teacher \ntraining  institutional/organizational  capacity  to  deliver  appropriate  types  and  levels  of  teacher \ntraining  programs;  and  (iii)  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  teacher  performance  for  initial \nregistration  plus  periodic  reviews.  The  framework  will  include  (i)  guidelines  for  articulation \nbetween pre- and in-service and other professional upgrade training programs; (ii) guidelines for \naccrediting  in-service  and  professional  upgrades  to  formal  qualifications;  (iii)  guidelines  to \ndevelop  teaching  portfolios  to  evaluate  classroom-based  performance  of  teachers;  (iv) \nguidelines  to  monitor  institutional  collaboration,  joint  projects  with  schools  and/or  teacher \nprofessional  organizations  in  respective  areas;  (v)  guidelines  for  teacher  remuneration  and \nincentive  schemes  to  ensure  equity  and  fair  distribution  of  teachers  through  the  country;  and \n(vi) guidelines  for  establishing  a  system  of  teacher  registration  and  accreditation.  The  policy \nframework  and  procedures  will  be  developed  through  a  consultative  process  involving  all \nstakeholders.  The  Ministry  of  Education,  Sports  and  Culture  (MESC)  will  hold  a  2-day  formal \nworkshop  involving  technical  experts,  teachers,  parents,  private  sector  partners  in  education, \ne.g.,  National  University  of  Samoa,  church  schools,  nongovernment  organizations,  private \nschools, and other policymakers, to seek feedback from the stakeholders regarding the contents \nof  the  teacher  development  policy  framework.  The  feedback  will  be  incorporated  in  the  final \nproduct covering teacher development policy reform and major activities with estimated budget, \ntime frame, and targets for teacher development for the next decade.  \n\n8. \nFurthermore,  the  TA  will  help  the  Government  begin  the  process  of  aligning  current \nteacher training programs to the new quality, efficiency, and sustainability standard. It will help \ndevelop:  (i)  appropriate  legislation  to  implement  teacher  registration  and  in-service  teacher \nperformance  monitoring,  (ii)  teacher  competencies,  (iii)  processes  for  monitoring  institutional \ncapacity to provide appropriate quality teacher training programs, (iv) a manual of policies and \nprocedures for national teacher development decision making, and (v) a reporting mechanism. \nThe  TA  scope  will  not  undertake  the  full  development  and  implementation  of  the  actions \nidentified, but it will provide a strong platform for MESC to work from.  \n\n\fAppendix 3Appendix Appendix 55  39 \n\nThe consultants\u2019 will provide one comprehensive report that integrates all aspects from \n9. \ntwo individual reports for each phase. The first of the two individual reports will include (i) a brief \ndescription of the current approach to teacher development and management based on relevant \ndisaggregated data obtained for the surveys and focus groups; (ii) a detailed, but concise and \nfocused analysis of key issues related to quality, efficiency, and cost effectiveness; (iii) concise \nanalysis of causes related to the issues; and (iv) a short description of past performance of the \nGovernment  and  external  assistance  in  teacher  development  including  in-service  teacher \ntraining  and lessons learned. It  will (i) provide  a set of  quality indicators,  with  baseline values, \nexpected  targets  with  time  frame,  and  monitoring  mechanism;  and  (ii)  formulate  of  a  set  of \nrecommendations for the conceptualization and development of an NTDF.  \n\n10. \nThe  second  individual  report  will  include  policy  guidelines  including  the  rationale, \nprocesses,  and  exemplars  for  (i)  developing  teacher  standards  and  competencies  for  primary, \nsecondary,  and  subject  specializations;  (ii)  monitoring  institutional  standards  and  capacity  to \ndevelop,  deliver,  and  monitor  appropriate  training  programs;  (iii)  guidelines  for  accrediting  in-\nservice  and  professional  upgrade  programs  to  formal  qualifications;  (iv)  guidelines  to  develop \nteaching  portfolios  to  evaluate  classroom-based  performance  of  teachers;  (v)  guidelines  to \nmonitor  institutional  collaboration,  and  joint  projects  with  schools  and/or  teacher  professional \norganizations  in  respective  areas;  and  (vi)  guidelines  for  teacher  remuneration  and  incentive \nschemes to ensure equity and fair distribution of teachers throughout the country. \n\nD. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n11. \nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  and  MESC  the  Implementing \nAgency  for  the  TA.  MESC  will  appoint  a  senior  staff  member  as  coordinator  for  all  matters \npertaining  to  the  TA.  Five  counterpart  staff,  three  from  MESC  and  two  from  the  Faculty  of \nEducation  of  the  National  University  of  Samoa,  will  be  appointed  to  work  closely  with  the \ninternational  consultants  to  provide  assistance  and  advice,  and  help  formulate  the  final \ndocuments. The existing Education Steering Committee will be involved to advice on all policy \nand legal issues associated with the TA. If needed the committee could be expanded to include \nmembers  to  oversee  specific  areas  of  TA  implementation.  The  committee  will  meet  at  least \nthree times (at the beginning, middle, and end of TA) to provide guidance. \n\n12. \nADB  will  engage  four  international  and  five  domestic  consultants  with  experience  in  all \naspects  of  the  specified  scope  of  work.  The  international  consultant  group  will  comprise  (i)  a \nteacher education planning and institutional development specialist who will be the team leader \n(4.5 person-months), (ii) a teacher education/quality assurance specialist (3.5 person-months), \n(iii) a legislation and policy development expert (1 person-month), and (iv) a financial planning \nspecialist  (1  person-month).  The  domestic  consultants  will  be  (i)  an  education  administration \nand policy specialist (4 person-months), (ii) a teacher education specialist (3 person-months),(iii) \na  participatory  planning  specialist  (1.5  person-month),  (iv)  a  teacher  training  specialist  (2.5 \nperson-months), and (v) a finance and legal specialist (1.5 person-months). The consultants will \nbe selected through a firm in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \nother  engagement  arrangements  for  domestic  consultants  acceptable  to  ADB.  Supplementary \nAppendix D provides the detailed terms of reference for the consultants.  \n\nThe TA will be implemented over 10 months. It is expected to start in June 2006 and be \n13. \ncompleted  by  April  2007.2  The  team  leader  and  the  teacher  education/quality  assurance \nspecialist will prepare a TA implementation plan. Within 4 weeks after starting the TA, the team \nleader will submit a brief inception report summarizing initial findings, identifying specific issues, \n\n                                                 \n2  Synchronizing the work of this TA to match with the teacher training activities under the loan Project will be useful \nas  the TA  work  provides  minimum  standards  for teacher  competency  at various  levels of  the  school  system  and \nsubject type. \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nand suggesting changes to the methodology and program, if any.

The Government will use \nresults from monitoring and evaluation to improve performance in the Project and across the sector. \nA performance framework will be established (under component 5.3) and will be maintained by the \nMinistry of Education, Sports, and Culture (MESC). An important aspect of the framework will be to \nidentify  user  requirements  and  the  types  and  level  of  information  needed  for  effective  decision \nmaking  by  the  Government,  including  the  Education  Steering  Committee  and  MESC  Core \nExecutive. \n\nThe performance framework will include the elements of monitoring and evaluation specified \n2. \nhere  for  each  component.  Further,  it  will  be  integrated  with  standard  Government  reporting \nsystems. Monitoring will be ongoing, and will be formally reported to the Government and funding \nagencies through the Project\u2019s review and forward program process. \n\nThe  Government  and  development  partners  will  participate  in  a  joint  program  review  at \n3. \nregular  intervals  through  the  life  of  the  Project  that  will  ideally  coincide  with  MESC\u2019s  6-monthly \nassessment  against  the  performance  framework.  A  midterm  and  final  evaluation  of  the  Project\u2019s \nactivities will also be jointly conducted to provide information for the Government and development \npartners. \n\n4. \n\nThe responsible unit is the Core Executive and the main activities are the following: \n\nEstablish project implementation benchmarks and performance framework. \nIdentify data requirements for monitoring performance. \nIdentify data collection methods/instruments. \nIdentify feedback mechanisms (sharing of results).  \nConduct periodic monitoring as required. \nPrepare monitoring reports and the review and forward program. \nAssist in developing terms of reference for the midterm review. \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii) \n(viii)  Assist in conducting the midterm review. \n(ix) \n(x) \n\nAssist in developing the terms of reference for the final project review. \nAssist in conducting the final project review. \n\nB. \n\nComponent 1  \n\nMonitoring and evaluation of component 1 activities will focus on the development of primary \n5. \ncurriculum  and  learning  assessment  systems,  multimedia  materials  for  science  and  agricultural \nscience,  and  bilingual  materials  development.  Progress  toward  the  objective  will  be  measured  by \nmonitoring  input  availability  (textbooks  and  learning  materials),  as  well  as  outcomes  (retention \nrates,  standard  assessments  of  learning  achievement,  examination  results,  and  transition  rates). \nOther  activities  and  their  outputs  will  be  considered  as  general  activities  and  monitored  under \ncomponent 3.   \n\nThe  responsible  units  are  the  Curriculum  Materials  and  Assessment  Division  and  Core \n\n6. \nExecutive. The main activities are the following: \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nSpecify the schedule, sequencing, activities, and outputs for materials development. \nDetermine the frequency for formal reporting (how often it will be conducted) in line \nwith the project performance framework and associated benchmarks. \nIdentify  how  activities  and  outputs  will  be  monitored  by  Curriculum,  Material,  and \nAssessment Division, i.e., what will be monitored (indicators), when, and by whom. \nIdentify issues and questions to be examined and type of information to be collected. \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n51 \n\n(v) \n\nConduct  monitoring  and  report  results  to  the  Core  Executive  through  MESC\u2019s \nstandard reporting processes.  \n\nC. \n\nComponent 2  \n\nMonitoring  and  evaluation  of  component  2  activities  will  focus  on  implementation  of  the \n7. \nteacher  development  framework,  specifically  the  conduct  and  evaluation  of  pre-  and  in-service \ntraining.  Progress  in  teacher  development  will  be  monitored  through  reports  on  the  delivery  of \ntraining  programs,  studies  using  classroom  observation  protocols,  and  the  analysis  of  reports  of \nschool principals and school review officers.  \n\n8. \n\nThe effectiveness of the Agricultural Science Fellowship program will also be assessed. \n\nThe  responsible  units  are  the  School  Operation  Division  and  Core  Executive.

Provision of \nfurniture and equipment for schools will also be monitored. The project management team will have \noverall  responsibility  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  under  this  component  but  will  hire  supervising \narchitect/engineers  under  subcontracts \nto  monitor  and  evaluate  school  construction  and \nrehabilitation. Monitoring and evaluation will also cover the capital works, supply, and installation of \nany  printing  equipment  for  MESC.  Under  component  3,  the  new  MESC  headquarters  will  be \nconstructed at the Government\u2019s Malifa compound. The new building will enable effective operation \nof MESC to deliver quality education support services.  \n\nThe  responsible  units  are  the  project  management  team  and  Core  Executive.

Yes \nContribution of sector/subsector to reduce poverty in the country: \n\nIs the sector Identified as a national priority in country poverty \npartnership agreement? Yes \n\nSamoa does not have abject poverty, but pockets of poverty and poverty of opportunity exist, including lack of education \nand  access  to  health  services,  lack  of  economic  assets  and  employment  opportunities,  social  exclusion,  and  political \nmarginalization. Vulnerability is another major factor contributing to poverty. While the gross enrollment rate is quite high, \nnet enrollment is only 69% at the primary level, and completion rates are low. Most people lack access to quality primary \nand secondary education, resulting in high repetition and dropout rates, making the system very inefficient. Even students \nwho complete the full cycle of primary and secondary education often lack the skills required by the economy or for self-\nemployment.  Thus,  dropouts  and  out-of-school  youth  continuously  add  to  the  ranks  of  the  vulnerable,  ultimately  falling \nprey to social ills, exclusion and poverty.  \n\nThe Government\u2019s education policies and strategies for 1995\u20132005 focus on major education reforms, and these have \nsuccessfully  completed  a  number  of  activities.  Enrollment  rates  in  Samoa  are  very  impressive  compared  with  those  in \nother  Pacific  countries.  Still,  the  gains  have  not  been  equally  shared.  Poor  students  drop  out  without  acquiring  useful \nskills.  The  Project  will  address  the  gaps  in  the  education  sector  by  providing  better  school  facilities,  especially \nrefurbishing  primary  schools  and  expanding  the  unified  secondary  education  system  in  poor  rural  areas,  renewing  the \nprimary  curriculum,  providing  textbooks  for  secondary  students,  strengthening  pre-  and  in-service  teacher  training \nprograms,  and  improving  the  examination  and  assessment  system.  The  Project  will  address  factors  that  contribute  to \ndropping out and inefficiency. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPoverty Analysis  \n\nPoverty Classification: General intervention  \n\nB. \nUnemployment and absence and/or lack of appropriate schooling in rural and urban communities are cited as two major \ncauses of hardship among youth. An emerging trend of increased dropout rates among youth in both rural and urban \nareas is perceived, resulting in an increasing number of unemployed youth with little prospect of securing good paying \njobs. In rural areas, migration of the young population to urban areas has left large tracts of plantation lands idle. Rural \nchildren  have  generally  more  limited  access  to  secondary  education.  Only  22%  of  the  population  is  concentrated  in \nurban Apia, and the majority (48%) of the population lives in predominantly rural areas (northwest Upolu and Savai\u2019i).1 \nEighteen of the 46 secondary schools are based in Apia with eight located in northwest Upolu. The Apia schools tend to \nbe  much  larger  than  the  others,  and  the  quality  offered  considered  to  be  much  better.  Therefore,  the  demand  for \nschooling in Apia is high, and as a result schools in Apia are larger. Schools in rural areas often operate from low-quality \nfacilities  and  learning  inputs,  which  create  considerable  inequity  in  the  access  to  secondary  education  among  the \ndisadvantaged group. The Project will improve access to quality secondary education by improving school environments \nwith better classrooms, facilities, equipment, and trained teachers.  \n\nThe emerging pattern is dissatisfaction of communities with the poor state of health facilities and services as well as the \nstate  of  most  school  facilities  in  Upolu.  The  lack  of  market  opportunities  for  agricultural  produce  and  communication \nfacilities were the primary source of dissatisfaction for communities consulted in Savai\u2019i. Overall, the perceived lack of \ninfrastructure/services  and/or  poor  quality,  has  significantly  contributed  to  hardship  in  the  communities.  Lack  of \ncommitment to customer service by government departments was perceived to be a primary reason for the nondelivery \nand/or deterioration in the quality of needed services and existing facilities.  \n\nConsultations identified the following community priorities to address causes of hardship in society: (i) reduction of cost \nof  living,  (ii)  accessibility  of  loan  assistance,  (iii)  support  for  agriculture  development,  (iv)  provision  of  services  and \ninfrastructure  especially  education,  and  (v)  access  to  housing  assistance.  In  addition,  the  following  capacity-building \nneeds were identified to strengthen community efforts in addressing hardship in the community: (i) business skills, (ii) \ncattle-farming skills, (iii) fund raising, (iv) safe drinking water, (v) school improvement activities, (vi) nutrition education, \n(vii) road maintenance, (viii) computer literacy, and (ix) management skills for village councils.  \n\nThe  Project  would  improve  the  delivery  of  education  services  and  improve  the  negotiation  power  of  the  graduates. \nKnowledge  on  school  improvement  activities  were  identified  as  necessary  to  improve  education  quality  for  village \nchildren,  while  improved  knowledge  on  nutrition  will  promote  overall  health  standards  for  families  in  the  villages. \nKnowledge  of  computer  use  will  facilitate  access  to  unlimited  opportunities  provided  by  information  technology.  The \nprimary beneficiaries will be children from rural and economically disadvantaged households. About one fifth (20.3%) of \nall  households  are  estimated  to  have  per  capita  expenditure  below  the  basic  needs  poverty  line.  The  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) will support the renovation and equipping of secondary schools in rural and disadvantaged \n\n                                                 \n1  Abbott, D. 2002.

All the project-supported schools will be provided with learning environments at the national \nstandard. \n\nThe  project  design  was  based  on  broader  stakeholders\u2019  participation,  including  key  national,  district,  and  village \npolicymakers. Consultations through focus group meetings and workshops were conducted with different education and \ntraining  agencies,  local  leaders,  civil  society,  communities,  and  nongovernment  organizations.  Besides  workshops  to \ndiscuss  the  issues,  timely  consultations  with  government  staff  were  held  during  the  technical  assistance  (TA).  School \nteachers, principals, parents, and students were consulted during TA implementation. The timing, venue, and method of \norganizing  public  consultations  were  arranged  so  that  disadvantaged  groups  can  attend  and  have  a  chance  to  speak \nout. Special attention was paid to consultations with local people about the selection of school sites and of beneficiaries.  \n\nThe full participation of project beneficiaries and stakeholders in the whole project cycle started with the project design \nstage and will continue throughout project implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. Special measures will ensure the \nparticipation of females and local communities in project design implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. The public \nawareness campaign will support the successful implementation of new curriculum and learning assessment systems, \nparticipation  for  demand  generation,  as  well  as  village  community  involvement  in  monitoring  the  upgrading  of  school \nfacilities and support through counterpart funding. \n\nGender Development \n\nD.  \nStrategy to maximize the impact on women: Samoa has no gender disparities in access to education. In fact, more girls \nenroll  in  secondary  schools  than  boys.  The  majority  of  teachers  are  female.  However,  to  empower  the  parents, \nespecially  mothers  in  making  decision  on  their  children\u2019s  education  and  demand  quality  education,  mothers  will  be \nincluded  in  e  school  committees.

The medium-term outlook is for 3\u20134% economic growth. \nGovernance standards are high, with a commitment to sound macroeconomic management and \npublic  sector  reform.  While  the  economy  continues  to  rely  heavily  on  external  assistance  in  the \nform  of  grants  and  soft  loans,  the  cost  of  servicing  external  debt  has  been  declining  steadily, \ndecreasing  by  11%  between  2003/04  and  2004/05.  The  economy  is  also  helped  by  large \nremittances  from  Samoans  living  overseas,  primarily  in  Australia,  New  Zealand  and  the  United \nStates.  Migration  for  new  employment  amounted  to  4,000\u20135,000  annually  between  1998  and \n2002. The country has a clear vision for economic and social development in the medium term. \nThe  Strategy  for  the  Development  of  Samoa  (SDS)  for  2005\u20132007  was  completed  in  January \n2005  and  includes  a  commitment  to  restrain  the  annual  overall  budget  deficit  to  no  more  than \n3.5% of GDP and to annual inflation rates of less than 3.0%. \n\nB. \n\nThe Sector Context \n\n2. \nThe  Government  has  identified  education  as  a  priority  area  for  economic  and  social \ndevelopment  and  to  alleviate  hardship;  education  is  consistently  the  largest  single  item  in  the \nnational  budget,  averaging  16.1%  over  the  past  5  years.1  Support  to  education  typically \nrepresents over 4.5% of GDP, which is extremely high by regional and international standards.2 \nThe Education Sector Project II is clearly aligned with Government policy priorities and is directly \nresponsive  to  priorities  articulated  in  the  SDS.  The  SDS  identifies  seven  strategic  objectives  in \neducation  and  the  Project  addresses  six  of  these  as  follows:  (i)  project  components  1  and  2, \nstrengthening community support for education, improving curriculum and assessment practices; \nimproving teacher quality, and supplying improved teaching materials (SDS objectives 1 through \n4); (ii) component 3, upgrading school facilities and improved equipment (SDS objective 5); and \n(iii)  under  components  4  and  5,  strengthening  the  capacity  of  the  Ministry  of  Education,  Sports \nand Culture (SDS objective 6). \n\n3. \nIndicators  point  to  financial  stress  within  the  education  sector,  despite  the  high  level  of \ngovernment support and substantial international development assistance. This is particularly the \ncase  in  the  recurrent  budget  and  in  support  to  basic  education.  Analysis  of  expenditure  data \ncombined  with  estimates  of  inflation,  suggest  that  per  student  expenditure  at  the  primary  level \ndecreased by over 15% in the past 4 years.3 The decline in support to basic education appears to \nbe driven primarily by patterns of resource allocation within the education sector (Table A14). It \nindicates that primary\u2019s share of the total education budget has decreased from 44.2% to 35.7%, \nduring the past 4 years.  \n\nThe  high  proportion  of  the  recurrent  budget  required  to  meet  salary  costs  is  also  a \n4. \nconcern.  At  about  95%,  it  is  above  that  of  most  countries  (with  the  exception  of  other  Pacific \ncountries), limiting resources for operational expenditures. The lack of teachers in some areas is \nsignificant,  especially  for  secondary  education  and  the  subject  areas  of  mathematics,  sciences, \nand  agriculture.  The  teaching  profession  does  not  attract  the  most  talented  and  qualified \nstudents. Both constraints are related to low wages; low esteem of teaching as a profession; and \n                                                 \n1  This  excludes  allocations  to  the  Ministry  of  Finance  whose  vote  covers  a  range  of  statutory  commitments.  In  part, \n\neducation\u2019s share of the budget also reflects the high level of external grant assistance directed to the sector. \n\n2  The high share of GDP reflects, in part, the impact of external grants to education relative to other sectors. \n3  The ADB Pacific Department database has a discontinuity in base years for the consumer price index. This analysis \ncombined ADB data for 2001 through 2003 with Government of Samoa estimates of inflation for the third quarter of \n2003.  \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nin some instances, poor working conditions. In May 2005, the Government announced substantial \nincreases in public sector salaries (ranging from 30%\u201342%). Given that salaries constitute such a \nlarge  share  of  the  education  budget;  these  adjustments  may  place  further  strain  on  operating \nbudgets.  \n \n\nTable A14: Trends in Government Resource Allocation within the \n\nEducation Sector by Subsector \n\n(%) \n\nPrimary  Secondary  Polytech \n14.7 \n13.4 \n13.2 \n13.3 \n\nYear  \n2001 \n2002 \n2003 \n2004 \nNUS = National University of Samoa, Polytech = polytechnic. \nSource: Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Education, Sports, and Culture. \n \n\nNUS \n17.2 \n16.1 \n15.2 \n15.8 \n\n44.2 \n40.8 \n37.9 \n35.7 \n\n7.9 \n7.7 \n7.0 \n7.1 \n\nOther \n16.1 \n22.0 \n26.8 \n28.0 \n\n5. \nThe Project will address the issue of nonsalary recurrent inputs in the short- to medium-\nterm under component 1. At present, provision of teaching and learning materials and in-service \nteacher training is primarily externally financed. Component 1 of the Project will provide continuity \nof  these  critical  resources.  The  Government  provides  few  resources  for  school  maintenance  as \nthis  is  a  community  responsibility.  Many  communities  (especially  rural  and  low-income)  are  not \nable  to  provide  sufficient  funds  for  appropriate  school  maintenance.  The  Project  will  ensure \nsufficient allocations for operation and maintenance at the schools supported under component 2. \nComponent  3  will  strengthen  policy  analysis  and  planning  and  will  assist  the  Government  in \ndeveloping long-term strategies to address this issue.  \n\n6. \nThe  effectiveness  of  project-based  external  assistance  is  a  concern.  Samoa\u2019s  education \nsector  received  substantial  external  support  under  the  Education  Sector  Project  I  and  other \ninitiatives.4  Aid  coordination  and  the  effectiveness  of  these  activities  are  also  a  concern.  The \nGovernment  reaffirmed  that  the  Project  will  be  managed  and  implemented  under  a  single \nframework. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will be assisting the Government in developing a \ncomprehensive  education  policy  framework  and  strategic  plan.  The  issues  of  aid  coordination, \noptions for moving toward a sector-wide approach, and external on-budget support for recurrent \ncosts will be included in this initiative.  \n\nC. \n\nDemand Analysis \n\n7. \nSocial  demand  for  education  is  high,  especially  at  the  secondary  level.  Although \nenrollment  in  secondary  education  is  not  compulsory,  between  1995  and  2004  secondary \nenrollment increased by 11%. At present only 43% of the secondary age cohort is enrolled and \nthe Project will help address anticipated secondary enrollment growth, especially in rural areas. In \nrural  areas,  when  quality  of  education  services  is  poor,  demand  diminishes  as  parents  have  to \npay for higher fees and bear other direct costs.  \n\nThe  pattern  of  demand  at  the  primary  level  is  less  clear.  Although  primary  education  is \n8. \ncompulsory, data suggest that net enrollment in primary education declined from 77% in 1995 to \n69% in 2004. The causes of this decline are unclear and may have implications for the demand \nfor  secondary  places.  However,  one  explanation  could  be  that  the  management  information \nsystem  reporting  is  not  reliable.  Another  explanation  may  be  that  with  declining  quality,  parents \n\n                                                 \n4  Appendix 3 provides a summary of external assistance. \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n57 \n\ndo  not  value  education.  The  Project  will  strengthen  the  information  system  and  will  have  an \nawareness program for parents and community.  \n\n9. \nThe  growth  of  secondary  education  has,  in  turn,  led  to  growth  in  demand  for  places  at \ntertiary  institutions.  This  is  a  major  factor  in  the  increasing  financial  stress  evidenced  at  the \nprimary level. The Government has placed a cap on support to the National University of Samoa. \nLittle research has been done on the price elasticity of postsecondary education and willingness \nand ability to pay fees that represent economic costs. \n\nD. \n\nEconomic Rationale \n\n10. \nInternationally,  the  economic  rationale  for  public  sector  involvement  in  the  finance  and \nprovision of basic education is well-established and applies to Samoa. International research has \ndemonstrated the high social rate of return to basic education. As of 2001 approximately 50,000 \npeople were in the formal workforce in Samoa accounting for 25% of the total workforce. Those \nemployed in the private sector and receiving higher average incomes also report higher levels of \nsecondary  education  (93%)  and  of  these,  21%  report  postsecondary  qualifications.  Workers  in \nthe  informal  sector  have  lower  educational  attainment  with  61%  with  secondary  education  and \n15%  with  tertiary.  The  Government  sees  investment  in  human  capital  as  imperative  for  growth: \n\u201cThe creation of employment opportunities through economic growth needs to be matched by the \ncreation of a workforce with education and skills to meet the demands of employers.\u201d  \n\nThe Samoan education system is a combination of public, church, and private providers. \n11. \nMost Government schools have a high degree of community participation in school management. \nMost  primary  schools  and  all  but  four  secondary  schools  are  viewed  as  the  property  of  the \ncommunity with the Government providing teachers. The Project will build upon the principles of \npublic-private-partnership  and  strengthen  delivery  and  improve  quality  in  approximately  23%  of \nSamoa\u2019s secondary schools. Through support of policy analysis and policy dialogue, the Project \nwill assist the Government in evaluating cost-recovery alternatives for postsecondary education, \nand in this way, will improve the economic efficiency and viability of the system. \n\nE. \n\nAlternative Analysis and Efficiency Issues \n\n12. \nIn  close  consultation  with  stakeholders,  a  range  of  alternative  project  designs  were \nanalyzed.  The  project  design  reflects  substantial  evolution  from  the  feasibility  study,  with  ADB \nplaying a smaller role in the renovation and construction of the primary schools. ADB will finance \nrehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  almost  all  the  identified  secondary  schools  and  colleges.  The \nEuropean  Union  and  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  will  support  primary  school \nconstruction  and  rehabilitation  through  their  microfinancing  projects.  Australian  Agency  for \nInternational  Development  (AusAID)  and  New  Zealand  Agency  for  International  Development \n(NZAID) agreed to finance activities under a redesigned component 1. \n\n13. \nThe Project will provide support to quality improvement and increasing efficiency resulting \nin  learning  outcomes.  The  sector  study  indicates  that  prior  investments  have  not  always  been \neffective, especially at the primary level. One of the key findings of the review is that to achieve \nefficient  and  effective  outcomes,  all  aspects  of  education  need  to  be  addressed  suggesting \nbenefits  from  adopting  a  singular  sector  approach.  For  example,  previous  projects  failed  to \nrecognize the need to retrain teachers to be able to capture the benefit of improved curricula and \nteaching  materials;  and  likewise  projects  failed  to  address  issues  of  attrition  from  schools,  the \nneeds  of  rural  pupils,  and  the  ability  to  attract  teachers  into  rural  areas.  Lessons  from  past \nprojects  also  highlight  that  while  benefits  can  be  substantial  the  lack  of  holistic  and  well-\nsequenced interventions means most projects fail to deliver expected benefits and are simply not \nsustained beyond the life of the project.  \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nF.  \n\nBenefits and Costs \n\n14. \nThe  primary  beneficiaries  will  be  children  from  rural  and  economically  disadvantaged \nhouseholds. About one fifth (20.3%) of all households had per capita expenditure below the basic \nneeds poverty line. ADB will support the renovation and equipping of nine secondary schools and \nthree  colleges,  as  well  as  the  refurbishment  of  Fagaloa  School  to  create  a  pilot  community \nlearning center. In addition, the provision of teacher housing will increase the supply of teachers \nin disadvantaged areas.  \n\nEducation in Samoa will continue to rely on external assistance for some time. The Project \n15. \nwill be an integral part of that assistance and will provide skill strengthening for 1,900 teachers, \n300,000  student  learning  sets,  and  10,500  teacher  manuals.  Further,  a  total  of  9  secondary \nschools  with  a  total  roll  of  nearly  2,200  students  (16%  of  total  secondary  enrollment)  will  be \nupgraded to provide more efficient service delivery. \n\nlabor  market  consists  of  public  sector  employment,  agriculture, \n\nThe  education  system  of  Samoa  serves  two  labor  markets:  internal  and  external.  The \n16. \ninternal \nlight \nmanufacturing,  and  the  services  sector  (especially  tourism).  Overseas  remittances  by  Samoans \nworking abroad constitute about 17.4% of national income (excluding in-kind remittances). In rural \nSamoa  only  17%  of  households  receive  income  from  wages  and  salaries.  Households  in  rural \nareas have limited access to services, and fewer opportunities for income generation. Moreover, \na  much  lower  proportion  of  households  in  remote  areas  receive  remittances  from  abroad.5 \nEducational  qualifications  are  correlated  with  successful  emigration.  By  improving  education  in \nrural and disadvantaged communities, the Project will contribute to poverty reduction. \n\nfishery \n\nG. \n\nSustainability \n\n17. \nThe Project will provide bridging support to allow continuity in provision of critical quality \ninputs  (including  instructional  materials  and  teacher  training)  that  cannot  be  financed  by  the \nGovernment,  in  the  short-term.  This  will  avoid  an  interruption  of  services  while  longer  term \nstrategies  are  developed  and  agreed.  During  the  Fact-Finding  Mission,  a  projection  model  was \ndeveloped  to  extrapolate  past  trends  in  economic  growth  and  sector  finance,  and  to  project \nanticipated costs and resources likely to be available to the sector (Figure A14). All values are in \nconstant 2004/05 tala. The target level for resources required is set at the highest level over the \nprevious 5 years. Estimates of fiscal capacity are based on assumptions about the growth of GDP \nand  education\u2019s  share  of  GDP.  Combining  \u201cresource  envelope\u201d  projections  with  projections  of \nlikely  future  costs  provides  a  basis  for  assessing  the  potential  for  long-term  financial \nsustainability. The model suggests that, with economic growth and continuity in education\u2019s share \nof  GDP,  existing  programs  could  be  sustainable  from  Government  sources  (including  loans  but \nexcluding grants) in about 10 to 11 years.  \n\nH. \n\nSensitivity and Risk Analyses \n\nSensitivity analysis was conducted using the model and a range of assumptions regarding \n18. \ninflation (provided by the International Monetary Fund and the Government) and growth of GDP \n(World Bank, ADB, and the Government) over 13 years. Projections of the time needed to attain \nfinancial sustainability are robust across the range of likely assumptions. \n\n                                                 \n5  Forty percent of households in Apia receive remittances, compared with 25% in rural Savai\u2019i. \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n59 \n\nFigure A14: Projections of Financial Sustainability:\nProjected Capacity to Fully Fund Education Sector (Revenue and Loans)\n\n \n\nSustainability\n\nTarget\n\nCapacity\n\n \n\n0\n0\n/\n9\n9\n\n1\n0\n/\n0\n0\n\n2\n0\n/\n1\n0\n\n3\n0\n/\n2\n0\n\n4\n0\n/\n3\n0\n\n5\n0\n/\n4\n0\n\n6\n0\n/\n5\n0\n\n7\n0\n/\n6\n0\n\n8\n0\n/\n7\n0\n\n9\n0\n/\n8\n0\n\n0\n1\n/\n9\n0\n\n1\n1\n/\n1\n0\n\n2\n1\n/\n1\n1\n\n3\n1\n/\n2\n1\n\n4\n1\n/\n3\n1\n\n5\n1\n/\n4\n1\n\n6\n1\n/\n5\n1\n\n7\n1\n/\n6\n1\n\n8\n1\n/\n7\n1\n\nFiscal Year\n\nI. \n\nDistribution Analysis \n\n19. \nThe  primary  beneficiaries  will  be  children  from  rural  and  economically  disadvantaged \nhouseholds.

The  mission \nfound that the financial management systems of MOF and MESC meet international standards for \nfinancial management, accounting, and auditing; and was confident that the systems will meet the \nrequirements of Asian Development Bank (ADB). The assessment was based on a range of prior \nanalyses:  \n\n2. \nADB  conducted  a  financial  management  assessment  (FMA)  during  preparation  of  the \nEducation  Sector  Project  I.  The  analysis  concluded  that  \u201cADB-sponsored  Treasury  Institutional \nStrengthening  Project  has  been  very  successful.  It  has  led  to  clearly  enhanced  internal  control \nprocedures:  these  have  facilitated  improved  internal  control  and  have  resulted  in  significant \nimprovements  in  transparency,  accountability  and  disclosure.  Senior  staff  in  the  Department  of \nTreasury  impressed  as  being  well-qualified,  serious  and  committed:  they  fully  understand  and \naccept  that  ADB's  requirements  must  be  satisfied.  It  is  evident  that  co-operation  between  the \nDepartment of Treasury and the Department of Education works well\u201d. \n\nDetails of the assessment, which covers over 80 specific aspects of the Government\u2019s FMA \n\n3. \nsystem, are included in Supplementary Appendix B. \n\n(i) \n\nFinancial records of the Education Sector Project I was audited annually.

The ADB analysis found that \nthe  Government  was  in  compliance  with  ADB  requirements  in  all  areas  of  the \nassessment. A final audit will be conducted at the end of December 2005. \n\nThe  World  Bank  conducted  an  FMA  of  Government  systems  in  April  2004,  in \npreparation for a cyclone emergency relief project. The objective of the assessment was \nto  determine  whether  the  project  had  in  place  an  adequate  financial  management \nsystem  as  required  by  the  World  Bank  under  OP/BP  10.02.  The  assessment \nin  management  procedures  (which  have  been \nrecommended  minor  changes \nimplemented)  and  concluded  that  the  project  did  meet  minimum  World  Bank  financial \nmanagement requirements.  \n\n(iv) \n\nThe ADB Fact-Finding Mission conducted an additional FMA using the ADB knowledge \nmanagement  guidelines  and  the  toolkit  checklist  for  FMA.
