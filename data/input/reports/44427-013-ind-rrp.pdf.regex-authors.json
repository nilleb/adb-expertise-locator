I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto India for the Chhattisgarh State Road Sector Project. The report also describes proposed \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  for  Institutional  Strengthening  of  the  Chhattisgarh  Public  Works \nDepartment  (CGPWD),  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA.1 \n \n2.  The project will improve about 916 kilometers  (km) of state roads, in line with the \nChhattisgarh  Road  Master  Plan,  2005\u20132016.  It  will  involve  upgrading  roads  to  two  lanes, \nstrengthening culverts and bridges, and building new road sections and bridges. Consulting \nsupport will be provided to support implementation of civil works.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Under its India country partnership strategy, 2009\u20132012, the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) supports all levels of road sector development as a core infrastructure operation to \nfacilitate sustainable economic growth.3 The project is consistent with the strategic objective set \nout in the country partnership strategy, which recognizes the limited network capacity and \nlimited  operational  capacity  for  management  of  road  assets  and  road  safety  as  the  main \nchallenges in the road transport sector in India; and recommends the expansion of support to \nthe state road sector to ensure an inclusive approach to fill the gap between ADB\u2019s financial \nsupport in the rural road sector and the Government of India\u2019s National Highway Development \nProgram. The project is included in ADB\u2019s India country operations business plan, 2012\u20132014 \nand was advanced for approval in 2012 because of the high level of project preparation and \nproject readiness achieved.4 \n \n4.  In India, road transport accounts for 68% of freight movement and 87% of passenger \ntraffic. The national highways and the secondary system are unable to cope with the rapid traffic \ngrowth. In the road sector, freight traffic increased by about 12% and passenger traffic by about \n8% per year from 2000 to 2008 (footnote 3). The rapid growth in traffic has led to congestion, \ndeterioration of roads, and increased transport costs. State roads, the secondary road system in \nIndia, link national highways with district headquarters and important towns. The secondary \nsystem comprises about 13% of the road network and carries about 40% of traffic. About half of \nthe roads in the secondary system are estimated to be of poor riding quality. \n    \n5.  Chhattisgarh is one of the underdeveloped states of India and was established on 1 \nNovember 2000 through bifurcation from Madhya Pradesh state. Chhattisgarh is rich in mineral \nand coal deposits and is located in the east of central India. About 41% of its 21 million \npopulation live below the national poverty line. Since about 32% of its population is tribal and \nscheduled caste, and forests cover about 44% of its area of 135,194 square kilometers (km2), it \nis known as a tribal and forest state. \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided TA to prepare the project. (ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance to India \nfor Capacity Development to Enhance Project Readiness and Results Monitoring for Transport Projects. Manila TA \n7252-IND). \n3  ADB. 2009. Country Partnership Strategy: India, 2009\u20132012. Manila. \n4  ADB. 2012. Country Operations Business Plan: India, 2012\u20132014. Manila. ", "2 \n6.  Roads are the main mode of transportation in Chhattisgarh. National highways provide \ngood east\u2013west connections with neighboring states, and the main north\u2013south connection \nwithin the state. However, state highways and major district roads in Chhattisgarh are mostly in \npoor condition, and are not usable in the monsoon season. This is especially true for roads in \nsouthern and northern Chhattisgarh, where most of the tribal people live. Many roads are only \nsingle or intermediate lane roads, which lack sufficient capacity to cope with the growing traffic. \nThe total road length in Chhattisgarh is about 36,000 km, with road density less than 30 km per \n100 km2 against the national average of 100 km per 100 km2. Moreover, 80% of its existing road \nnetwork  has  an  international  roughness  index  worse  than  4.  Thus,  Chhattisgarh  lacks  an \nadequate road network to support the required mobility between areas with natural resources, \nindustrial centers, and economic development zones, and to provide better access to social \namenities.  \n \n7.  To improve state roads, in 2002\u20132003, the CGPWD prepared a 10-Year Master Plan for \nRoad Sector Development for 2003 to 2012, which aims to (i) promote the development of six \nmain road corridors, (ii) remove capacity bottlenecks from the network to better connect rural \nareas, and (iii) support socioeconomic development by improving road access and connectivity \namong growth centers. Based on the master plan, the government of Chhattisgarh (GOC) \nprepared  and  approved  a  priority  investment  program  for  the  improvement,  rehabilitation, \nstrengthening, and widening of about 5,000 km of state roads at an estimated cost of about \nRs105 billion. The master plan was updated in February 2006 using ADB\u2019s TA for Preparing the \nChhattisgarh State Roads Sector Development to identify road sector development needs for \n2005\u20132016.5 It recommended the development of 8,871 km of state highways and major district \nroads at a cost of Rs33 billion in 2004 prices. \n \n8.  To support improvement of the road network in Chhattisgarh, by implementing the road \nmaster plan, ADB provided a loan of $180 million6 in 2003 for improvement of 1,250 km of state \nroads in Chhattisgarh as well as TA to support reforms in the state roads sector. The project \nwas successfully implemented and completed in July 2011 but it faced completion delays of \nabout 2.5 years. These were mainly due to (i) initial delays caused by a lack of project readiness \nat the time of loan approval; and (ii) limited capacity for project management and project \nimplementation in the CGPWD, which was at the time of loan approval being established as an \nindependent  department  for  the  state  of  Chhattisgarh,  which  was  bifurcated  from  Madhya \nPradesh only 3 years earlier. ADB provided capacity development for road sector management \nin Chhattisgarh through TA (footnotes 5), which supported (i) updating of the road master plan \nfor 2005\u20132016; and (ii) establishing policies for planning and management in the CGPWD, \nwhich also helped to prepare this project. Therefore,  delays in project implementation  are \nexpected to be avoided, as (i) project readiness is high, with the detailed design of all sample \nroads and the proposed non-sample roads completed; and (ii) the institutional capacity of \nCGPWD has been substantially strengthened. \n \n9.  The  roads  proposed  for  inclusion  under  the  project  have  been  selected  from  this \nupdated road master plan for 2005\u20132016. The project will supplement ADB\u2019s support in the rural \nroad sector in Chhattisgarh by linking rural roads to the state and national highway network\u2014\nproviding access for the rural population to markets, businesses, social services, and education. \n \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to India for Preparing the Chhattisgarh State Roads Sector Development. Manila \n(TA 3995-IND). \n6  ADB. 2003. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to India for the \nChhattisgarh State Roads Development Sector Project. Manila (Loan 2050-IND). \n ", "3 \n10.  The project is prepared as a sector loan, as (i) the GOC has a sector development plan \nin place (the road master plan, 2005\u20132016); (ii) the CGPWD has sufficient institutional capacity \nto implement this sector development plan, as demonstrated by the successful completion of \nthe previous loan; and (iii) appropriate policies for project preparation and project management \nto implement the sector development plan have been established. The two sample subprojects \nare (i) the Simga\u2013Kurud road (SH-20, 110 km); and (ii) the Nandghat\u2013Gidhori road (SH-10, 91 \nkm). These represent almost 25% of the project cost. The non-sample roads will be selected \nand approved in line with the process outlined in the project administration manual (PAM).7 \n  \n11.  As the sector assessment identified lack of road maintenance in the past as the key \nfactor leading to the deteriorated status of many project roads, the main focus of institutional \nstrengthening  by  the  capacity  development  TA  attached  to  the  proposed  loan  will  be  on \nimproving maintenance management and road asset management. The budget available to the \nCGPWD for road maintenance was found to be sufficient. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The  envisaged  impact  of  the  project  is  improved  connectivity  in  Chhattisgarh.  The \noutcome of the project is an improved road transport system in Chhattisgarh. \n \nC.  Outputs \n13.  The outputs of the project will be about 916 km of reconstructed and rehabilitated state \nroads in 15 road sections; the sample projects comprise of 2 roads with a total length of 201 km, \nthe proposed non-sample roads comprise of 13 roads with a total length of 715 km. Thus, after \ncompletion of this project, a total of 2,166 km out of the 8,871 km of state roads identified in the \nstate road sector development plan (2005\u20132016) for priority improvement and widening will be \ncompleted with ADB financing.  \n \n14.  The TA attached to the project will support improvement of the capacity of the CGPWD \nin procurement, contract management, and project management. Establishment of a road asset \nmanagement  system  initially  for  the  roads  financed  by  ADB  will  be  supported  by  the  TA \nincluding procurement, customization and commissioning of the information technology system, \ncollection of the baseline data, training of staff in the use of the road asset management system \nfor planning of road maintenance activities, and training of staff in expanding the road asset \nmanagement for use with all roads managed by CGPWD. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n15.  The project is estimated to cost $428.1 million (Table 1). \n \n16.  The government has requested a loan of $300,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod  of  5  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility,8 a commitment charge of 0.15% per year \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The \ngovernment has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking \n                                                \n7  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n8  The interest includes a maturity premium of 20 basis points. \n ", "4 \nthat  these  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem         Amounta \nA.

The government has requested that repayment follow the annuity-style commitment-\nlinked  repayment  option.  Based  on  the  above  loan  terms  and  this  repayment  option,  the \naverage loan maturity is 18.31 years and the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.20% per \nannum.  \n \n18.  The financing plan is in Table 2. The ADB loan will finance 70% of the project cost. This \nis  considered  acceptable,  taking  into  account  that  the  GOC  has  allocated  its  counterpart \nfinancing for 30% of the cost. By including more roads in the loan, the benefits will be spread \ninto more areas of the state. \n \n19.  The government will make available the loan proceeds to GOC on a back-to-back basis \nand GOC will bear the foreign exchange risk on the ADB loan in accordance with the policy of the \ngovernment. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nAmount  Share of \nSource  ($ million)    Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank  300.00    70.00 \nGovernment of Chhattisgarh  128.10    30.00 \n  Total    428.10    100.00 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n ", "5 \nA.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  The executing agency for the project will be the GOC acting through the CGPWD. A \nproject implementation unit, established under the CGPWD with field offices at key locations, \nwill be responsible for day-to-day project implementation and management and will assign \nadditional staff to work on the project. One or two full-time project managers will be assigned for \neach  contract  package.  The  project  managers  will  be  delegated  adequate  technical  and \nadministrative  authority  for  expeditious  project  implementation.  The  CGPWD  will  engage \nconstruction supervision consultants to act as the engineers for the construction contracts. \n \n21.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe PAM (footnote 7).  \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2013\u2013December 2017 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2017 \nManagement \n(i)  Executing agency  Chhattisgarh Public Works Department \n(ii)  Implementation unit  Raipur, 1 project director with 25 staff plus field offices \nProcurement  International  19 civil works  $9,000,000\u2013\ncompetitive bidding   contracts  $27,000,000 each \nConsulting services  Quality- and cost- 3 contracts with  $12,000,000 \nbased selection; full  about 2,936 person-\ntechnical proposal  months \nRetroactive financing and advance  Works and consulting services \ncontracting \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed according to the Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to time) of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and detailed arrangements \nagreed on between the Government of India and ADB. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n22.  ADB  approved  advance  contracting  of  civil  works  in  February  2012. During  project \npreparation, the CGPWD\u2019s procurement activities for the sample roads were well advanced. \nBased on this, the government requested retroactive financing for all project components. Up to \n20% of the loan proceeds will be eligible for retroactive financing, provided that expenditures are \nincurred on works, equipment, and consulting services for the project in accordance with agreed \nprocedures  and  during  the  12  months  before  the  signing  of  the  loan  agreement.  The \ngovernment  and  the  GOC  have  been  informed  that  approval  of  advance  contracting  and \nretroactive financing does not in any way commit ADB to finance the project. \nV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n23.  Capacity  development  TA  for  $1,000,000  for  Institutional  Strengthening  of  the \nChhattisgarh Public Works Department will support the institutional development initiatives of \nthe GOC. The TA will assist and support the project implementation unit in improving project \nimplementation,  designing  and  approving  additional  non-sample  projects,  enhancing  road \nsafety, and ensuring the future operation and maintenance of the project roads through an \nimproved road asset management system. The consultants will conduct district and statewide \ntraining and workshops as required. \n \n ", "6 \n24.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, of which (i) $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources); and (ii) $500,000 by \nthe Department for International Development of the United Kingdom to be administered by \nADB.10 An international consulting firm will be recruited by ADB according to its Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Consultants will be asked to \nsubmit simplified technical proposals, and the selection will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s quality- \nand cost-based selection method using a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20. \nVI.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n25.  The project was prepared with the enhanced capacity of the CGPWD, which has been \ngained through the first loan and TA provided for capacity building. The CGPWD engaged \ndetailed design consultants with its own funds to prepare detailed design for roads proposed for \nADB  financing,  incorporating  ADB\u2019s  requirements  of  economic,  social,  and  environmental \nstudies into the consultants\u2019 terms of reference. The GOC asked ADB for TA to conduct due \ndiligence to ensure that the detailed design complies with ADB requirements. \n \n26.  The engineering design for the project roads was prepared to minimize land acquisition \nas well as social and environmental impacts. A road safety audit was performed as part of the \ndetailed design and the recommendations were incorporated in the engineering design of the \nproject. Advance actions have been taken to ensure that the construction can commence early. \nAll of these measures have improved project readiness and will mitigate the risk of delay. \n \n27.  The selection criteria and approval process for non-sample roads is provided in the PAM \n(footnote 7). All non-sample roads must be technically feasible, economically and financially \nviable, and safeguard reports in compliance with the resettlement framework, environmental \nassessment and review framework, and the indigenous peoples planning framework must have \nbeen approved by ADB. The detailed design for the non-sample roads has been completed by \nGOC under its own funding and GOC asked ADB for TA to conduct due diligence to ensure that \nthe design for the non-sample roads complies with ADB requirements. The due diligence for the \nnon-sample roads is in an advance stage of preparation. \nB.  Economic and Financial \n28.  The economic evaluation of the project followed the standard practice of comparing life \ncycle road and user costs with and without the project, using the net present value with a 12% \ndiscount rate and economic internal rate of return (EIRR) as decision criteria. The highway \ndevelopment and management system was used in the analysis, which focused on transport \ncost  savings.  Value  added  from  better  transport  links  resulting  in  new  industries  and \nemployment are not quantified in this analysis but are captured through benefits from generated \ntraffic. \n \n                                                \n10  The portion to be financed by the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom will be \napproved  as  a  subproject  under  ADB.  2011.  Cluster  Technical  Assistance  to  India  for  Advanced  Project \nPreparedness  for  Poverty  Reduction.  Manila  (C-CDTA  0003-IND)  following  the  procedure  for  approval  of \nsubprojects  under  cluster  TA  in  accordance  with  ADB.  2011.  Technical  Assistance.  Operations  Manual. \nOM D12/OP. Manila (issued on 14 July). The TA will be approved by the vice-president operations 1 under the \npowers currently delegated by the President to the vice-presidents to approve TA projects. See ADB. 2008. \nIncreasing the Impact of the Asian Development Bank\u2019s Technical Assistance Program. Manila (R87-08, May). \n ", "7 \n29.  The EIRR for the sample roads evaluated is 19.8% for the Nandghat\u2013Gidhori road (SH-\n10, 91 km) and 21.0% for the Simga\u2013Kurud road (SH-20, 110 km). Overall, both sample roads \nare very robust, with high EIRR, satisfying the economic efficiency criteria. The sensitivity of the \nEIRR for the sample project roads was analyzed with respect to changes in the benefit and cost \nstreams. The following sensitivity test cases were examined: (i) construction costs increased by \n15%, (ii) time benefits reduced by 50%, (iii) benefits decreased by 15%, and (iv) a combination \nof (i) and (iii). The results show that the quantified economic benefits are robust to various \nsensitivity tests. All selected roads have an EIRR above 12% in all sensitivity tests.11 \n \n30.  Financial sustainability. Incremental recurrent costs associated with the project are \nestimated  to  be  0.8%  of  the  current  maintenance  budget  of  Chhattisgarh  Public  Works \nDepartment  and  0.2%  of  the  overall  budget  on  an  annual  basis.  The  allocation  for  road \nmaintenance was on average around Rs2,800 million until FY2010\u201311, and has been increased \nto Rs3,040 million in FY2011\u201312 and Rs5,675 million in FY2012\u201313. The budget allocation for \nroad maintenance in FY2012\u201313 was assessed to fully meet the maintenance needs for the \nstate roads network and the Government of Chhattisgarh is committed to maintain a similar \nlevel of budget for road maintenance works. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that funds will be \navailable to meet the maintenance costs. \nC.  Governance \n31.  Institutional capacity. A team of individual consultants supplemented the CGPWD\u2019s \ncapacity  during  project  preparation.  The  CGPWD\u2019s  capacity  for  implementation  will  be \nsupported by the supervision consultant, who will also assist with the approval process for non-\nsample roads. For long-term capacity strengthening, TA will be provided to make the CGPWD \nmore effective in developing, operating, and maintaining state roads. \n \n32.  Financial management. The CGPWD has experience in implementing an ADB-funded \nproject. It has satisfactory capacity for project financial accounting and sufficient knowledge of \nADB\u2019s  disbursement  procedures.  The  TA  will  support  the  introduction  of  a  computerized \naccounting  system  in  the  project  implementation  unit  and  strengthening  of  the  financial \nmanagement system.  \n \n33.  Procurement.  Goods and works  will be procured according to ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). All civil works will be procured  through \ninternational competitive bidding. All consulting firms will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time) using quality- and \ncost-based selection, with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20. The CGPWD has prepared the bid \ndocuments for the first four works contracts and the supervision consultant for the project as \npart of advance procurement action.  \n \n34.  Anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto  and  discussed  with  the  government,  the  GOC,  and  the  CGPWD.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 7). \nD.  Poverty and Social \n35.  Chhattisgarh state has a population of 20,833,803, out of which 16,648,056 persons live \nin rural areas, based on the 2001 census. The state has a population density of 151 per km2 \n                                                \n11 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nand almost 31.8% of the total population of the state is tribal. Chhattisgarh has a high incidence \nof poverty in the country\u201440.9% of people live below the poverty line.12 \n \n36.  The poverty and social assessment surveyed about 25,000 households and men and \nwomen participated in focus group discussions. The majority stated that the project will increase \neconomic and employment opportunities by improving linkages to markets, production centers, \nand public and social service facilities. \n \n37.  Gender.  Focus  group  discussions  were  undertaken  with  women  from  different \nsocioeconomic groups in the project influence area. Women stated that the project will benefit \nthem; better roads will promote better transport services and give everyone better access to \nsocial  services,  markets,  workplaces,  higher  education,  health  facilities,  and  employment \nopportunities. \n \n38.  The same effects are expected to be attained under this project for both men and \nwomen.  The  bidding  documents  provide  clauses  designed  to  ensure  that  all  civil  works \ncontractors  comply  with  applicable  labor  laws;  do  not  employ  child  labor;  encourage  the \nemployment of the poor, particularly women; and do not offer different wages to men and \nwomen, particularly for work of equal value. \n \n39.  HIV and AIDS. India\u2019s National AIDS Control Organisation estimates the number of \npersons living with HIV in India at 2.31 million in 2007, and adult HIV prevalence at 0.34%. \nAccording to India\u2019s National AIDS Control Organisation, HIV infection is typically concentrated \namong the poor and marginalized groups (including such high-risk groups as sex workers, drug \nusers, migrant laborers, and truck drivers). These groups, particularly truckers, propel the HIV \nepidemic, and studies indicate that the infection is spreading rapidly to the general population. \nBut Chhattisgarh is a low-prevalence state. Based on the poverty and social assessment, there \nis no risk that the project will increase HIV/AIDS incidence. Contractors will carry out HIV/AIDS \nawareness  for  their  laborers  at  work  sites  and  this  will  be  monitored  by  the  construction \nsupervision consultants during project implementation. \nE.  Safeguards \n40.  Environmental impact. The project is classified category B for environmental impact in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  two  sample  subprojects \ninclude  rehabilitation  of  existing  roads  within  the  right-of-way  for  most  of  their  length.  No \nprotected areas, environmentally sensitive habitats, or reserved forests exist in or near the \nproject area. Therefore, the project is unlikely to cause any significant, adverse, or irreversible \nenvironmental impacts. Initial environmental examination (IEE) reports, including environmental \nmanagement plans (EMP), have been prepared for each subproject. Anticipated impacts, which \nare mainly confined to the construction stage, include generation of dust, noise, exhaust, wastes, \nimpacts on water quantity and quality, soil erosion and siltation, tree removal, and occupational \nhealth  and  safety  issues.  These  impacts  will  be  addressed  through  mitigation  measures \nprovided in the EMP, which will be included in the agreement with the contractor. Extensive \npublic consultations have been conducted while preparing the IEE, and a grievance redress \nmechanism has also been prepared. An  environmental assessment and review framework \n(EARF) has been prepared to guide environment safeguards-related preparatory work for the \nnon-sample subprojects and to ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and \n                                                \n12  Government of India, Ministry of Home Affairs, Office of Registrar General & Census Commissioner. 2002. Census \nof India 2001. New Delhi. \n ", "9 \nthe environmental policies of the Government of India. According to the EARF, the non-sample \nsubprojects will follow a similar approach for project preparation and implementation as the \nsample subprojects. The EARF as well as the IEE reports for the sample subprojects have been \nendorsed by the executing agency and disclosed on the ADB website as required by ADB\u2019s \nPublic Communications Policy (2011). \n \n41.  Land acquisition and resettlement impact. The project is classified category A for \nresettlement impacts. Resettlement plans have been prepared for the two sample subprojects. \nA resettlement framework has been prepared for the project. For all the subsequent subprojects \nthat have resettlement impacts, resettlement plans will be prepared in accordance with the \nsafeguard provisions in the resettlement framework. \n \n42.  The project was developed with a view to avoiding or minimizing land acquisition and \ninvoluntary resettlement by adopting the most feasible technical design. The proposed widening \nof roads will occur within the existing right-of-way. A full census was conducted, based on the \ndetailed designs for the two sample subprojects. Resettlement plans were prepared for the two \nsample subprojects according to the government\u2019s National Rehabilitation and Resettlement \nPolicy (2007), the state resettlement policy, and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. According \nto the census carried out for the two sample subprojects, 1,013 persons will be displaced, out of \nwhich four households will be physically displaced and 143 economically displaced. The total \nresettlement budget for the sample subprojects is Rs14,961,691. Compensation rates for the \nloss of land and structures, shifting assistance, income restoration assistance, and additional \nsupport for vulnerable groups are provided in the resettlement framework and resettlement \nplans.  Meaningful  consultation  and  information  disclosure  were  undertaken  during  the \npreparation of resettlement plans, including with (i) project-displaced persons, and (ii) the public \nthrough  the  ADB  website.  If  any  changes  or  additional  land  requirements  or  involuntary \nresettlement impacts are identified during implementation, a related resettlement plan will be \nprepared or modified according to the applicable laws referred to in the resettlement plan. \nADB\u2019s prior approval will be obtained before further implementation of the relevant section of the \nsubproject. \n \n43.  Impact on indigenous people. The project is classified category B in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. Scheduled tribes account for 31.8% of the total population \nin Chhattisgarh. The tribal population is scattered\u2014not concentrated in any particular sample \nsubproject areas\u2014and interacts freely with the outside community. The study undertaken for \npreparation  of  the  sample  subprojects  did  not  show  any  difference  in  impact  between \nindigenous  and  non-indigenous  groups  in  the  project  locations.  The  poverty  and  social \nassessment survey confirmed that the socioeconomic impacts of the project will not differ \nsignificantly  for  tribal  groups  compared  with  the  remainder  of  the  population.  In  addition, \nmeaningful consultations were conducted with both primary and secondary stakeholders to \nobtain a comprehensive perspective on the project and its impacts, and to obtain an estimate of \nlosses they would suffer and to develop ways to mitigate those losses. Special provisions have \nbeen  made  under  the  resettlement  plans  to  address  impacts  on  indigenous  peoples.  An \nindigenous  peoples  planning  framework  has  been  prepared  to  address  any  unanticipated \nimpacts on indigenous peoples during the implementation of existing or additional subprojects. If \nany significant impacts on indigenous peoples are identified, an indigenous peoples plan will be \nprepared in accordance with the indigenous peoples planning framework and submitted to ADB \nfor approval. \n \n ", "10 \nF.

ASSURANCES \n45.  The government, the GOC, and CGPWD have assured ADB that implementation of the \nproject shall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the PAM and loan documents. \n \n46.  In addition to the standard assurances, the government, the GOC, and CGPWD have \ngiven assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n47.
