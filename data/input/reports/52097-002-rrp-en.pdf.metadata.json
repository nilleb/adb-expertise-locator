The report also describes proposed technical assistance \n(TA) for Enhancing Road Safety, Disaster Risk Reduction, and Project Implementation Capacity, \nand if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the \nBoard, approve the TA. \n \n2. \nThe project will improve the capacity, reliability, and safety of road links between Pokhara, \nNepal\u2019s second-largest city, and Mugling, a central junction of the strategic road network (SRN) \nthat further links to Kathmandu, the administrative and economic capital; and Bharatpur, Nepal\u2019s \nfourth-largest  city  and  a  gateway  to  the  East\u2013West  Highway  and  international  markets.  The \nproject will finance the first phase of upgrading Mugling\u2013Pokhara Highway, and will (i) rehabilitate \nand widen to four lanes the 81-kilometer (km) section between Abukhaireni and Pokhara, and (ii) \nincrease awareness and strengthen the capacity of the Department of Roads (DOR) in road safety \nand  disaster  risk  reduction.  A  second  phase,  covering  the  8  km  section  between  Mugling  and \nAbukhaireni, will be considered as a subsequent project because of engineering constraints.1 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nCountry context. Nepal is landlocked and bordered to the north by the People\u2019s Republic \nof  China,  and to the  south,  east,  and  west  by  India.  Consequently,  Nepal  relies  heavily  on  its \ndirect  neighbors  for  international  trade,  mainly  India  which  traded  65%  of  Nepal\u2019s  imports  and \nexports in fiscal year (FY) 2019. Economic growth improved to 7.3% per year on average during \nFY2017\u2013FY2019, compared with an annual average of 3.3% during FY2014\u2013FY2016. However, \ngross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  largely  depends  on  exogenous  factors,  such  as \nremittances, which accounted for 25.4% of GDP in FY2019; and rainfall, as agriculture accounted \nfor  27%  of  GDP  in  FY2019.2  Nepal\u2019s  economy  suffers  from  a  lack  of  competitiveness  and  is \nparticularly hampered by its deficient infrastructure network and the resulting high operating costs \nand travel  times,  which  (i)  constrain the  development  of  competitive export  supply  chains,3  (ii) \nhinder the  exploitation of  its  natural resources  and  tourism  potential,4  and (iii)  impede  regional \nintegration and trade with indirect neighbors.5 \n \n                                                \n1  The 8 km, two-lane section between Mugling and Abukhaireni cannot be widened to four lanes  because of steep \nslopes and the presence of a hydropower plant. A second project phase will thus include (i) the construction of a \ngreenfield,  two-lane  alignment  on  the  opposite  side  of  the  valley  between  Mugling  and  Abukhaireni;  and  (ii)  the \nrehabilitation and improvement of the two-lane section. Feasibility and detailed design studies are ongoing for phase \n2, which is under consideration for financing in 2021. \n\n2  ADB. 2019. Asian Development Outlook 2019: Strengthening Disaster Resilience. Manila.  \n3  Government of Nepal, Department of Customs. 2019. Nepal Foreign Trade Statistics, Fiscal Year 2018/19 (2075/76). \nKathmandu. Exports decreased by 3.6% annually and in real terms from FY2009 to FY2019. Sustained by foreign \nremittances, which increased from 2.0% of GDP in 2000 to 25.4% in 2019, imports grew by 9.2% from FY2009 to \nFY2019. \n\n4  World Travel & Tourism Council. 2018. Travel & Tourism Economic Impact 2017. London. The contribution of tourism \nto Nepal\u2019s economy is estimated at 7.5% of GDP, supporting about 0.95 million jobs. Tourist arrivals  exceeded 1 \nmillion  in  2018,  but  remain  significantly  below  Nepal\u2019s  natural,  historical,  and  cultural  potential,  and  below  the \ngovernment\u2019s ambition of reaching 2 million tourists by 2020. \n\n5  Excluding India, trade with other South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) members accounts for \n0.7% of Nepal\u2019s trade. SASEC members are Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fTransport sector. Roads are the predominant mode of transport for more than 90% of \n4. \ngoods  and  passengers,  although  road  density  remains  low  at  47  km  of  road  per  100  square \nkilometers of land area, and 2.5 km per 1,000 people.6 The SRN totals 12,494 km, 51% of which \nis paved, and is developed and maintained by the DOR in the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure \nand Transport (MOPIT). The number of registered vehicles increased from 0.7 million in FY2009 \nto 3.2 million in FY2018, and motorcycles accounted for 79.6% of sales. Vehicle registrations are \nexpected to quadruple by 2029, highlighting the need to increase capacity. The high traffic fatality \nrate of 15.9 fatalities per 100,000 people also mandates road safety improvements, notably by \nstrengthening road designs.7 The SRN maintenance budget increased by 10.0% annually and in \nreal  terms  during  FY2013\u2013FY2020;  however,  the  average  budget  utilization  of  81%  requires \nimprovements in asset management and planning practices. International and domestic air travel \nincreased by 7.2% and 2.0% annually during 2011\u20132018, but capacity constraints at Kathmandu \nairport inhibit growth.8 \n \n5. \nSector road map. The transport sector is guided by the National Transport Policy, 2002; \nthe  Priority Investment Plan,  2007\u20132016;  and MOPIT\u2019s  5-year  strategic  plan.9 The road  sector \nstrategy of the government\u2019s Fourteenth Plan, 2017\u20132019 aims to (i) expand the SRN to improve \ninterprovincial  and  national  connectivity;  (ii)  promote  economic growth  through  higher  regional \nintegration;  (iii)  reconstruct  roads  damaged  by  the  April  2015  earthquake;  (iv)  provide  greater \naccess to social services and markets; (v) improve road safety and road maintenance; and (vi) \nsupport the development of the agriculture, industry, energy, and tourism sectors.10 \n \n6. \nSubregional cooperation. The government strategy is aligned with subregional policies, \nnotably SASEC\u2019s objectives to facilitate trade, enhance accessibility to national and transnational \nmarkets, and improve connectivity through the development of multimodal transport systems.11 \nThe  improvement  of  the  East\u2013West  Highway\u2014Nepal\u2019s  main  domestic  and  international  trade \ncorridor\u2014and of its feeder roads is recognized by the government and development partners as \na priority to implement the strategies. The project is part of a comprehensive set of interventions \nby the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the government, and the World Bank to improve Nepal\u2019s \nmajor  highways.12  The  project  is  consistent  with  the  objectives  of  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership \nstrategy  for  Nepal,  2013\u20132017  to  enhance  global\u2013local  connectivity,  and  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s \ncountry operations business plan, 2019\u20132021; and in SASEC\u2019s operational plan, 2016\u20132025.13 \n \n7. \nRegional context. Pokhara is the capital of the Gandaki Province and has a population \nof about 450,000 people in 2019. It is a major economic and social hub for its hinterland, although \nPokhara\u2019s  location  at  the  foot  of  the  Himalayas  impedes  connectivity  and  restricts  access  to \nmarkets, jobs, and social opportunities. The sinuous 200 km journey to Kathmandu takes over 5 \nhours by road. There are no railway or waterway connections, and its domestic airport handled \n\n                                                \n6  Compared with 12.2 km of road per 1,000 people in Bhutan, 4.1 km in India, and 5.5 km in Sri Lanka. \n7  World Health Organization. 2018.

Preparation of the country partnership strategy, 2020\u20132024 is underway. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fonly 610,000 passengers in 2018. A new regional international airport in Pokhara will alleviate the \ncapacity constraints of the existing airport and is expected to be completed in 2021. Despite poor \ntransport links, Pokhara\u2019s attractive environment makes it a primary tourism destination, and it \nwelcomed about 376,000 international visitors in 2017 (40% of all international arrivals in Nepal, \nup from 22% in 2001).14 \n \n8. \nProject design. The project road is the primary access link of Pokhara to Kathmandu and \nis a major feeder road of two SASEC corridors linking Kathmandu to Dhaka (Bangladesh) and \nKolkata (India) through Mugling and the East\u2013West Highway. It is a two-lane carriageway that \nhandles  about  7,400  vehicles  per  day,  including  14%  of  goods  vehicles  and  up  to  55%  of \nmotorcycles in urban areas. Traffic is forecast to increase to 13,000 vehicles per day by 2040, \nand the rising number of motorcycles creates significant road safety risks, notably as (i) the road \nwinds  through  the mid-hill  region  of  Nepal  and  its geometry  can  be  improved,  (ii)  slow-moving \nvehicles  and  pedestrians  are  not  segregated  in urban  areas,  and (iii)  the  pavement  is  in  poor \ncondition.15  The  road  will  be  widened to four  lanes to cater to increasing demand,  and  design \nstandards will feature enhanced geometry, pavement, structure, drainage, safety, and intelligent \ntraffic system features to improve sustainability, safety awareness, and safety compliance. The \nroad will be median divided, and service lanes in urban areas will improve safety, particularly for \nwomen and children, who are more likely to walk, ride a bicycle, or use public transport than men. \n \nProject  benefits.  The  project  will  directly  support  economic  growth  by  (i)  lowering \n9. \ntransport costs and reducing logistics constraints; (ii) improving accessibility to domestic markets, \njobs, and social services; (iii) enhancing national connectivity between Pokhara and Kathmandu; \nand (iv) facilitating access to international markets through Bharatpur and India. Consequently, \nthe project is expected to (i) promote the development of the private sector and competitive export \nsupply  chains  in  Pokhara  and  its  hinterland,  (ii)  increase  domestic  and  international  trade,  (iii) \nimprove regional integration, and (iv) leverage Pokhara\u2019s tourism potential. The project will also \nincrease connectivity and urban road safety for the major settlements located between Mugling \nand  Pokhara,  and  strengthen  disaster  resilience  by  installing  a  landslide  monitoring  and \nmanagement system and replacing the structurally weak Madi bridge. \n \n10. \nADB\u2019s interventions and lessons learned. ADB is a leading partner for the development \nof the SRN and has financed five projects from 2010 to 2018 to improve about 1,212 km of road, \ntotaling $690.8 million.16 The project design incorporates lessons from previous projects, notably \non  (i)  project  preparation:  a  preparatory  facility  financed  the  detailed  design  to  minimize  initial \nimplementation delays, and the project is procurement ready;17 (ii) procurement: three large works \npackages are expected to attract experienced international contractors and improve the quality of \nworks;  (iii)  material  availability:  a  consulting  services  package  will  be  carried  out  to  assess \nnationwide  material  availability  and  quality;  (iv)  disaster  risk  resilience:  climate  adaptation \nmeasures and the attached TA will strengthen landslide monitoring and management capacity; \nand  (v)  asset  sustainability:  performance-based  maintenance  contracts  will  ensure  funding \n\n                                                \n14 Government  of  Nepal,  Ministry  of  Culture,  Tourism  and  Civil  Aviation.  2016.

While performance-based \nmaintenance  contracts  will  promote  private  sector  participation,  and  recent  improvements  in \npolitical  stability  reduce  investment  risks,  the  potential  for  private  sector  financing  and  public\u2013\nprivate partnerships remains limited and justifies the need for public sector involvement. \n \n11. \noperational priorities:18 \n \n\nAlignment  with  Strategy  2030.  The  project  will  contribute  to  achieving  the  following \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nAccelerating progress in gender equality. The project will (a) promote women\u2019s \neconomic empowerment by reducing time poverty and improving access to social, \nhealth, job, and market opportunities; (b) target women in awareness campaigns \non  road  safety,  disaster  risk  reduction,  HIV/AIDS,  sexual  harassment,  abuse, \nexploitation, and human trafficking; and (c) target vulnerable and women-headed \naffected households in livelihood improvement programs. \nTackling  climate  change,  building  climate  and  disaster  resilience,  and \nenhancing environmental sustainability. Significant disaster risk reduction and \nclimate adaptation measures, totaling 15.6% of civil works costs, will strengthen \ndisaster risk resilience. The attached TA will also develop a landslide monitoring \nand management system to mitigate environmental sustainability risks. \nStrengthening governance and institutional capacity. The project will improve \n(a)  service  delivery  through  the  civil  works  contracts,  which  were  designed  to \nimprove works quality, improve the completion timeline, and promote private sector \nparticipation  in  the  road  maintenance  during  operation;  and  (b)  institutional \ncapacity in traffic management, procurement, and contract management. \nFostering  regional  cooperation  and  integration.  The  project  will  enhance \nconnectivity  and  competitiveness  to  promote  regional  trade,  tourism,  and  value \nchains; and is aligned with SASEC\u2019s strategy and operations plan (footnote 11). \n\nProject Description \n\n \nB. \n \n12. \nThe  project  is  aligned  with the  following  impacts:  (i)  transport  connectivity  within  Nepal \nand  with  neighboring  countries  improved  (footnote  10),  and  (ii)  physical  connectivity  and \nmultimodal linkages for land-based transport along major trade routes enhanced (footnote 11). \nThe project will have the following outcome: efficiency and safety of the road transport system \nimproved.19 \n \nOutput 1: Road network upgraded and maintained. The loan will finance the upgrading \n13. \nof about 81 km of road between Abukhaireni and Pokhara from two to four lanes, and feature (i) \nimproved safety, including crash barriers in hilly areas, and service lanes for pedestrians, bicycles, \nand motorcycle users in urban areas; (ii) intelligent transport system equipment, such as traffic \nlights and warning systems; and (iii) enhanced sustainability, with a 5-year performance-based \nmaintenance  period.  The  project  road  includes  nine  major  bridges,  including  two  for  which  a \nseparate civil works contract package is provided, in addition to 26 minor bridges. \n \n14. \nOutput  2:  Awareness  of  communities  and  capacity  of  government  staff  on  road \nsafety, disaster risk reduction, and project implementation improved.

The TA will support three outputs: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nintelligent traffic management and information system for road safety developed, \nincluding  the  design of a  safety-oriented  plan  to  incorporate  intelligent transport \nsystems and road safety technologies in the project road; \nlandslide  monitoring  and  management  system  for  disaster  risk  reduction \ndeveloped,  including  the  identification  of  landslide-sensitive  areas  and  the \npreparation of a risk monitoring and reduction plan; and \nprocurement  and  contract  management  capacity  enhanced,  including  training \ncourses on procurement of works, contract management, and dispute resolution \nunder the International Federation of Consulting Engineers. \n\n \n22. \nThe TA is estimated to cost $550,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6).22 The government will provide counterpart \nsupport in the form of counterpart staff, data, maps, and other in-kind contributions. Equipment \npackages under the loan will support the implementation of the intelligent traffic management and \ninformation system, and of the landslide monitoring and management system. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\n \nA. \n \nDOR prepared the engineering designs of the project road in accordance with the Asian \n23. \nHighway  Class  1  standard,  and  aimed  to  improve  road  safety  and  geometry,  avoid  land \nacquisition,  and  minimize  social  and  environmental  impacts.  The  project  road  will  be  widened \nfrom two to four lanes, and the completed road will have a design speed of 80 km per hour, dual \ncarriageways  separated  by  a  3-meter  median,  3-meter  shoulders  on  both  sides,  and  new \npavements. The project will integrate safe and socially inclusive design features, such as 41 km \nof  footpaths,  20  km  of  service  lanes  segregating  slow-moving  vehicles,  46  disabled-friendly \npedestrian crossings, 46 sheltered bus stops, and reflective lane markers.  \n \n24. \nThe project road is in the subtropical climate zone with high rainfall and heat hazard risks, \nhigh  rainfall-induced  landslide  risks  in  sections  of  the  road  traversing  steep  terrain,  medium \nearthquake risk, and very low river flooding risks. The main climate risks in the project area are \ntemperatures  increasing by  1.2\u00b0C\u20131.7\u00b0C during 2019\u20132050,  rainfall  levels  increasing  by  15%\u2013\n                                                \n22 Attached  Technical  Assistance  Report:  Enhancing  Road  Safety,  Disaster  Risk  Reduction,  and  Project \n\nImplementation Capacity (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fEconomic and Financial Viability \n\n20%  during  2019\u20132050,  and  extreme  rainfall  increasing  in  frequency.  To  address  these  risks, \nengineering  designs  of  the  road  and  bridges  have  integrated  climate  adaptation  measures, \nincluding slope protection works, increased road embankment and bridge heights, and increased \ncross and side drainage capacity. \n \nB. \n \n25. \nEconomic viability. The economic evaluation of the project followed ADB guidelines and \ncompared life cycle economic costs and benefits in with- and without-project scenarios, using a \n9.0%  discount  rate  and  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  as  decision  criteria.23  The \nhighway development model 4 was used to estimate road agency and road user costs based on \ninput  data  on  traffic; road geometry;  pavement  condition;  and maintenance,  improvement,  and \noperating costs. The analysis considered the project costs of the entire Mugling\u2013Pokhara corridor, \nincluding phase 2 of the project. Project benefits include savings associated with vehicle operating \ncosts,  travel  time,  and  road  accidents  (unquantified).  The  EIRR  of  the  project  is  estimated  at \n13.9%. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated the robustness of the economic viability of the project \nunder adverse changes in costs and benefits, with an EIRR of 11.9% under the most sensitive \nscenario involving a 10% increase in capital costs and 10% decrease in benefits. \n \n26. \nFinancial viability. The project is not revenue generating, and cost recovery will not be \nsought. The Roads Board of Nepal funds maintenance from allocations of the Ministry of Finance \nand from toll revenues. The annual SRN maintenance budget increased from NRs2.7 billion in \nFY2013  to  NRs8.0  billion  in  FY2020  in  nominal  terms,  or  an  annual  growth  rate  of  16.7%  in \nnominal terms and 10.0% in real terms. The project\u2019s average annual incremental recurrent costs \nare estimated at 0.75% of the maintenance budget, and it is thus reasonable to expect that DOR\u2019s \nbudget allocation will be able to meet the project\u2019s incremental maintenance costs, particularly \nconsidering that the road is a major highway and trading corridor of Nepal.24 \n \nC. \n \n27. \nThe FY2020 budget, which doubled the allocation for road maintenance, also introduced \na tax of NRe1.0 per liter of fuel and diesel to be channeled toward road maintenance. Despite the \nincreasing  commitment  of  the  government  and  the  minimal  impact  of  the  project  on  DOR\u2019s \nmaintenance budget, the historical underfunding of road maintenance still represents a risk to the \nproject\u2019s  sustainability,  as  the  maintenance  budget  could  be  channeled  toward  other  roads \nrequiring more urgent maintenance. Consequently, the project design incorporated the following \nmeasures to mitigate the risk of funding availability and strengthen the project\u2019s sustainability: \n\nSustainability \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nCivil  works  contracts  include  a  1-year  defect  liability  period  and  a  5-year \nperformance-based maintenance period under the responsibility of the contractors \nafter  construction.  This  will  strengthen  works  quality  by  the  contractor,  promote \nprivate  sector  participation  in  the  maintenance  of  the  project  road  under  the \nsupervision  of  DOR,  and  guarantee  the  availability  of  budget  and  physical \nresources in the initial phase of operation. \nThe  project  design  includes  adaptation  measures  estimated  at  15.6%  of  capital \ncosts,  compared  with  about  5.0%  for  most  road  projects,  which  represent  a \nstrengthening  of  technical  specifications  against  assessed  environmental  and \nclimate risks. The attached TA will also support institutional capacity improvements \nin landslide management and disaster risk reduction. \n\n                                                \n23 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n24  Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\nD. \n \n28. \nInstitutional  capacity.  The 2015  Constitution  of  Nepal,  which  introduced three tiers  of \ngovernment, entrusted the development and management of the national highway network to the \nfederal  government,  under  MOPIT  and  DOR.  The  Project  Directorate  (ADB)  of  DOR,  which \nhandles project management for ADB\u2019s strategic road sector projects, has good technical capacity \nand  significant  experience  implementing  ADB  projects.  Its  project  director  reports  to  DOR\u2019s \ndirector  general,  who  in  turn  reports  to  the  MOPIT\u2019s  secretary.  The  capacity  of  DOR  will  be \nstrengthened through consulting services contracts for (i) construction supervision, which include \ntraining  in  design,  contract  management,  and  quality  assurance;  (ii)  an  independent  design \nchecking for third-party review and approval of bridge designs; and (iii) a raw material survey to \nassess raw material availability, quantity, and quality for construction projects across Nepal. \n \n29. \nFinancial  management.  The  assessed  pre-mitigation  financial  management  risk  is \nmoderate  mainly  because  DOR  has  an  established  record  in  implementing  ADB-financed \nprojects, and adequate financial management capacity in accounting, disbursement procedures, \nand  reporting.  All  transactions  are  recorded  by  government  accounting  systems,  reflected  in \ngovernment  accounts,  and  subjected  to  statutory  audit  by  the  comptroller.  The  project \nmanagement  unit  maintains  separate  books  of  accounts  following  government  accounting \nstandards, under the cash basis of accounting; and prepares annual project financial statements, \nwhich  are  audited  by  Nepal\u2019s  Office  of  the  Auditor  General.  The  financial  management \nassessment  identified  the  following  risks:  (i)  increasing  financial  management  requirements, \nparticularly with the increasing project pipeline, coupled with frequent project staff turnover; (ii) \nlack  of  comprehensive financial  information  in  periodic  project  progress  reports;  and (iii)  weak \ninternal  audit.  The  main risk  mitigation  actions  include  (i)  assigning  additional  financial  staff  to \nproject field offices, (ii) ensuring proper training in ADB systems and procedures, and (iii) including \nadditional financial information in the quarterly progress reports as agreed with ADB. \n \nProcurement. Procurement and consultant recruitment will follow the ADB Procurement \n30. \nPolicy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers \n(2017, as amended from time to time). The amended Public Procurement Act (2017) and Public \nProcurement Regulations (2017) of Nepal are generally acceptable to ADB and encompass best \ninternational procurement practices. While Nepal\u2019s procurement risk rating is  substantial, DOR \nhas  significant  experience  with  ADB\u2019s  procurement  requirements,  and  the  sector  and  project \nprocurement risks are moderate. Engagement of all consulting firms will use the quality- and cost-\nbased selection method with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10. Advance actions for the recruitment of \nconstruction supervision  consultants  started  in  August 2019,  and  invitation for  bids for  the  two \nroad packages were published in September 2019. \n \nIntegrity  due  diligence  was  conducted.25  No  significant  integrity  risks  were  identified. \n31. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment  and  MOPIT.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM. \n \nE. \n \n32. \nPoverty. The direct area of influence of the project includes 456,273 residents living in 10 \nmunicipalities crossed by the project road, in the districts of Kaski and Tanahu. About 11.8% of \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n                                                \n25 ADB. 2003.

Manila. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fresidents live below the national poverty line, below the national average of  18.7%. The major \nincome  sources  are  remittances  (22%),  agriculture  (21%),  trade  (20%),  and  services  (12%). \nAccess to sanitation (99%) and piped water (95%) is high. The project is expected to improve \naccess to economic opportunities and social services, reduce intraregional disparities, promote \nthe development of trade and tourism, and encourage the creation of competitive export jobs and \nservices;  the  project  is  also  expected  to  create  about  1.65  million  person-days  of  skilled  and \nunskilled employment during construction. \n \nGender. The project is categorized some gender elements. A poverty and social analysis \n33. \nassessed  the  socioeconomic  characteristics  of  1,297  households\u2014including  322  households \nheaded by women\u2014representing 6,828 people, 50% of them women and girls. Overall, women \nwere supportive of the positive impact that the project will deliver, including expected increased \naccessibility  to  education  and  health  facilities,  reduced  travel  time,  and  expanded  access  to \nagricultural products and job markets. The gender benefits of the project also include (i) a safer \nurban environment, with infrastructure features friendly to elderly people, women, children, and \npeople  with  disabilities;  (ii)  livelihood  improvement  programs  prioritizing  vulnerable  affected \nhouseholds and affected households headed by women; (iii) ensured participation of women in \nawareness programs on  road  safety,  disaster  risk  reduction,  HIV/AIDS,  and  human  trafficking; \nand  (iv)  ensured  participation  of  female  MOPIT  and  DOR  staff  on  capacity  building  activities. \nGender, social development, livelihood improvement, and road safety awareness experts will be \nhired to support the gender activities of the project. \n \n34. \nHIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking.  HIV  prevalence  in  Nepal  is  low,  at  0.2%  of  the \npopulation aged 15\u201349.26 About 39 HIV incidences were recorded in the districts affected by the \nproject, while about 50 nongovernment organizations work in HIV prevention. Human trafficking \nin Nepal remains prevalent, with an estimated 5,957 cases of abducted persons in FY2016 (80% \ninvolving women and children, primarily for forced labor and sexual exploitation). While the project \nwill facilitate movements of people and require a significant labor force, it will widen an existing \ncorridor  and  is  not  expected  to  contribute  to  a  significant  increase  in  HIV/AIDS  and  human \ntrafficking.  The  project  will  recruit  a  nongovernment  organization  to  conduct  an  HIV/AIDS  and \nhuman trafficking awareness campaign along the road corridor. The contractors will also conduct \nHIV/AIDS awareness sessions and provide voluntary testing and guidance to their workforce. \n \nF. \n \n35. \ncategories are as follows.27 \n \n36. \nEnvironment  (category  B).  The  project  road  will  be  rehabilitated  and  widened  to four \nlanes  in  the  existing  right-of-way,  and  the  road  is  not  located  in  or  near  any  environmentally \nsensitive area. The environmental impacts of the project are not expected to be significant and \nirreversible, and will be mainly restricted to the construction stage. Anticipated impacts involve \nlandslide  and  erosion,  dust,  noise,  exhaust,  construction  and  domestic  waste,  water \ncontamination,  occupational  health  and  safety,  siltation,  traffic  congestion  during  construction, \nand air pollution and road safety during operation. An initial environmental examination has been \nprepared  for  the  project  and  was  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website  in  July  2019;  it  includes  an \nenvironmental management plan providing mandatory mitigation measures to be implemented by \ncontractors.  Concerns voiced  by  affected  persons and stakeholders  during  project  preparation \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n26 Government of Nepal, Ministry of Health and Education. 2014. Country Progress Report on HIV/AIDS. Kathmandu. \n27 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\fwere  incorporated  in  the  design,  and  a  grievance  redress  mechanism  will  alleviate  concerns \nduring  implementation.  About  6,694  trees  will  need  to  be  removed  and  a  compensatory \nafforestation program will be implemented, with a ratio of 25 saplings planted for each felled tree. \n \nInvoluntary resettlement (category A). The project will require private land acquisition \n37. \nof  1.28  hectares,  where  the  existing  alignment  is  insufficient  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the \nproject design, mainly at intersections and bridges. The project will affect 143 private land parcels \nbelonging to 122 households, with parcels mostly comprising small strips of uncultivated (1.21 \nha) and cultivated (0.07 ha) land on either side of the existing road. There is no major impact on \nthe income of affected households arising from the loss of land. \n \n38. \nThe project will affect 810 households (3,985 persons) and 767 private structures along \nthe right-of-way; 85% of affected households are non-titled, and only 4% are below the poverty \nline. A resettlement plan was prepared for the project road and is disclosed on the ADB website.28 \nThe entitlement matrix provided under the resettlement plan includes mitigation measures and \nresettlement  assistance  commensurate  with  the  project  impacts;  incorporates  lessons  from \nprevious projects; and provides compensation at replacement cost for land, structures and trees, \nshifting  and  reconstruction  assistance,  loss  of  income,  and  livelihood  measures.  Public \nconsultations  were  undertaken  from  2016  to  May  2019  and  will  continue  as  the  plan  is \nimplemented.  An  adequate  grievance  redress  mechanism  is  in  place  at  the  project  level,  in \naddition to the provisions for redress under the Land Acquisition Act of Nepal (1977). Livelihood \nmeasures  will  particularly  target  vulnerable  households  and  households  headed  by  women. \nInstitutional arrangements and capacity to implement the plan are adequate. \n \nIndigenous peoples (category C). The project road does not cross traditional customary \n39. \nor tribal lands. More than half of affected households belong to various ethnic groups recognized \nby  the  government  (mainly  Dalit,  Gurung,  Magar,  and  Newar);  however,  they  share  the  same \nincome-generating  activities  and  access  to  services  and  opportunities  as  other  affected \nhouseholds. The social impact assessment also indicates that households from these groups tend \nto  have  a  higher  socioeconomic  status  than  others,  are  well  integrated,  will  not  be  impacted \ndifferently, and will benefit equally from the project. The project will also not impact the dignity, \nhuman rights, livelihood systems, or culture of ethnic groups; or affect the territories or the natural \nand  cultural  resources  that  they  own,  use,  or  occupy.  Cultural  aspects  were  considered \nparticularly during public consultations, information disclosure, livelihood improvement measures, \nand the grievance redress mechanism. \n \nImplementation. DOR is experienced and has adequate institutional capacity regarding \n40. \nADB\u2019s  procedures  and  requirements,  and  the  Project  Directorate  (ADB)  will  implement  the \nenvironmental safeguards and resettlement plan. Resettlement and environment specialists will \nsupport the Project Directorate (ADB) in guiding and reviewing the implementation of safeguard \nplans  and  documentation.  Environmental,  gender,  and  social  experts  from  the  construction \nsupervision consultants will assist DOR with the implementation and monitoring of safeguard and \ngender activities. Contractors will be required to have environmental, health, and safety officers \nto ensure the environmental management plan is properly implemented. An external monitor will \nprovide a third-party review of the resettlement plan. The government will finance and implement \nenvironmental and resettlement activities. Detailed implementation arrangements are in the PAM. \n \n\n                                                \n28 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nG. \n \n41. \nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.29 The integrated benefits and impacts \nare expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nExtreme weather events \nand steep slopes result in \nlandslides and delay \nconstruction. \n\nInadequate maintenance \naffects road use in the \nlong term. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nMitigation Measures \nConstruction of the Mugling\u2013Narayanghat Road was hampered by multiple landslides and \nseveral traffic interruptions, resulting in negative project perception. The project is split in \ntwo  phases  to  carry  out  comprehensive  studies  of  alternative  options  and  an \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  on  the  steepest  road  section  between  Mugling  and \nAbukhaireni, which will be financed in a subsequent phase. This will significantly help with \ntraffic operation during the construction of the Mugling\u2013Abukhaireni section. The attached \ntechnical  assistance  will  also  assist  in  improving  the  landslide  monitoring  and \nmanagement capacity of the executing and implementing agencies. \nThe pavement of the road has been designed for 20-year durability. Civil works contracts \ninclude  a  1-year  defect  liability  period  and  a  5-year  performance-based  maintenance \nperiod  under  the  responsibility  of  the  contractors.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  will \ncontinue dialogue with the government to reduce the periodic maintenance backlog. \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \nThe government and MOPIT have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \n42. \nconform to all applicable ADB requirements, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, financial management, and disbursement \nas described in detail in the PAM and loan documents. \n \n43. \nwhich are set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n \n\nThe government and MOPIT have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n44. \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$195,000,000 to Nepal for the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Mugling\u2013Pokhara \nHighway Improvement Phase 1 Project, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in concessional \nterms, with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per \nyear thereafter; for a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms \nand conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n                                                \n29 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n2 October 2019 \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n13 \n\n \nImpacts the Project is Aligned with \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\n(i) \n\ntransport  connectivity  within  Nepal  and  with  neighboring  countries  improved  (Fourteenth  Plan, \nFY2017\u20132019);a and \n\n(ii)  physical connectivity and multimodal linkages for land-based transport along major trade routes \n\n \n\nenhanced (SASEC Operational Plan, 2016\u20132025)b \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms \n \na\u2013b.
