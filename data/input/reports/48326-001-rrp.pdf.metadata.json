It  will  help \nrehabilitate selected (i) traditional irrigation and rural road infrastructure in the 15 worst-affected \nprovinces,  based  on  the  damage and  needs  assessment  (DNA)  undertaken  by  the  Ministry  of \nRural  Rehabilitation  and Development  (MRRD); 3 and (ii) formal  irrigation system  infrastructure \nin three provinces, based on the DNA completed by the Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW).4  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n \n3. \nAfghanistan  is  classified  as the  world\u2019s  second most flood-prone  country,  after  Bhutan, \non  the  basis  of  average  annual  number  of  flood-related  deaths  per  million  people. 5  The \ntopography, climate, and land cover of the mountainous regions  result in the mountain valleys \nbeing  prone  to  flooding.  Typically,  heavy  rain  in  the  spring  and  early  summer  combined  with \nsnow  and  glacier  melt  cause  flash  flooding  and  damage to  villages,  roads,  and  farming  areas \nclose to the rivers. Flooding is exacerbated by the narrow valleys, which channel the floodwater \nthrough  villages,  destroying  homes  and  livelihoods.  Significant  losses  also  result  from \ninundation  of  crops  and  irrigation  facilities,  and  the  deposit  of  silt,  rocks,  and  debris  in  canals \nand fields. \n \nDuring  April\u2013early  June  2014,  heavy  rains  over  many  parts  of  northern  Afghanistan \n4. \nresulted in severe flash floods, causing widespread destruction and loss of life. By 22 May 2014, \n125,000  people  residing  in  123  districts  in  27  provinces  had  been  affected.  While  flooding  is \ncommon  in  most  years,  the  2014  northern  floods  were  exceptionally  severe  and  are  regarded \nlocally as a 1 in 100-year event.  \n   \n\n1. \n\nDamage, Loss, and Needs Assessment \n\nThe Afghanistan National Disaster Management Authority is the lead agency responsible \n5. \nfor  disaster  management  in  the  country.  With  provincial  disaster  management  agencies,  the \nauthority  coordinated  disaster  relief  efforts  financed  by  central  and  line  agency  governments, \nnongovernment  organizations,  and  multilateral  funds.  A  comprehensive  DNA,  inclusive  of  key \ndevelopment  partners  and  government  agencies,  was  not  possible  due  to  poor  security \nconditions.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  estimated  flood  losses  at  over  $800  million.  ADB \n\n                                                \n1  Financing partners: the governments of Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  Provinces  include  Badakhshan,  Baghlan,  Balkh,  Bamyan,  Daikundi,  Faryab,  Ghor,  Jowzjan,  Kunar,  Laghman, \n\nNuristan, Panjshir, Samangan, Sar-e-pul, and Takhar. \n\n4  Provinces include Balkh, Jowzjan, and Samangan. \n5  United  Nations  Development  Programme,  Bureau  for  Crisis  Prevention  and  Recovery.  2004.  Reducing  Disaster \n\nRisk: A Challenge For Development. New York. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nestimated  the  cost  of  damage  in  four  provinces, 6  based  on  multi-agency  consultations,  at \naround  $240  million,  with  70%  of  losses  from  housing,  crop  and  livestock  losses,  and  deaths. \nSince many families have sustained damage to or loss of their homes and in many cases their \nlivestock, they require urgent humanitarian and economic assistance. During the ADB DNA and \nfact-finding mission, extensive losses to rural infrastructure significantly impacting the livelihood \nof thousands of people were observed.  \n \n6. \nOn 4 August 2014, the government requested an emergency assistance grant to assist \nwith  repairing  or  reconstructing  damaged  village  connectivity  and  irrigation  infrastructure,  and \nrepairing farm to market roads. \n \n7. \nMRRD  has  estimated  the  cost  to  repair  small-scale  irrigation  infrastructure  at  $19.6 \nmillion in 15 provinces (mainly to canals, intakes, and other structures; retaining walls; and land). \nIt has estimated the repair or reconstruction costs of village roads and bridges at $12.3 million, \nwith village roads particularly being severely affected.  \n\n \nMEW  has  estimated  the  cost  to  repair  larger-scale  irrigation  infrastructure  in  need  of \n8. \nearly  repair  at  $6.3  million  in  Balkh,  Jowzjan,  and  Samangan  provinces.  This  includes  the \nreconstruction of the Hacha Qala weir servicing extensive irrigation areas in Jowzjan province, \nand many subprojects comprising canal bank protection and repair.  \n\n \n9. \nThe  ADB  fact-finding  mission  verified  damage  to  a  sample  of  assets.  The  damage \nassessment estimates provided by MRRD and MEW, totaling $38.15 million, formed base cost \nestimates for infrastructure rehabilitation (Table 1). \n\n \n2. \n\nGovernment and Development Partner Response \n\nflood  humanitarian  relief \n\n10. \nThe  national  response  to  the  northern  flood  disaster  has  been  limited  due  to  financial \nresource  constraints.  The  National  Emergency  Fund  receives  an  annual  contribution  of  \nAF900  million  ($16  million)  from  the  government,  much  of  which  has  been  applied  to  the \nnorthern \nin  2014.  Local  government  agencies  have  helped \ncommunities\u2019  complete  temporary  repair  of  irrigation  facilities  through  the  provision  of \nexcavators and sandbags.  \n \n11. \nThe  on-the-ground  humanitarian  response  was  generally  prompt  and  effective  through \nseveral  government  departments  and  provincial  agencies,  United  Nations  agencies,  and \nnumerous  nongovernment  organizations.7 The  United  Nations  Office  for  the  Coordination  of \nHumanitarian  Affairs  is  coordinating  support  for  house  reconstruction.  The  World  Bank  is \nproviding  a  grant  of  $20  million  under  its  ongoing  Irrigation  Restoration  and  Development \nProject  to  repair  previously  rehabilitated  infrastructure.  ADB  investments  to  repair  village \neconomic infrastructure and rural connectivity will complement the large humanitarian efforts of \nthe government and its development partners. \n \n12.  With its  support for  agriculture  and natural  resources,  including  irrigation infrastructure, \nthe  project  is  to  contribute  to  the  achievement  of  government  and  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  development  outcomes,  as  outlined  in  the  interim  country  partnership  strategy,  2014\u2012\n2015 for Afghanistan. For national planning, the project is directly supportive of the agriculture \n\n                                                \n6   Balkh, Faryab, Jowzjan, and Sar-e-pul. \n7  See details in Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fand  rural  development,  and  infrastructure  development  clusters  of  the  government\u2019s  national \npriority programs. The project will contribute to ADB\u2019s commitment under the Midterm Review of \nStrategy  2020  to  strengthen  integrated  disaster  risk  management  to  reduce  vulnerability  to \nnatural and environmental hazards. \n \nB. \n \n13. \nThe project outcome will be restoration of irrigated agriculture and access to markets. \n \nC. \n\nThe project impact will be improved community welfare in flood-affected project areas. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\nThe project outputs will be (i) selected flood-damaged infrastructure rehabilitated, and \n14. \n(ii)  project  management.  The  project  will  help  communities  and  MEW  to  repair  damaged \nirrigation structures and land, including protecting land from further erosion with retaining walls \nwhere required, and returning assets to production as soon as possible. Investments in village \nroads  and  bridges  will  allow  rural  connectivity  to  be  restored.  The  infrastructure  to  be \nrehabilitated  will  be  subject  to  selection  criteria  set  out  in  the  project  administration  manual \n(PAM).8 Key criteria include that (i) assets were damaged by the 2014 floods; and (ii) repairs \nare technically feasible, cost-effective, financially sustainable, and economically viable.  \n \nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n15. \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $57.24 million (Table 1). \n\nTable 1:  Project Investment Plan ($ million) \n\nItem \nA.

For output 1, MRRD will implement rehabilitation \nof traditional irrigation and rural roads assets, and MEW the rehabilitation of government-owned \nirrigation  schemes.  MRRD  will  make  extensive  use  of  community  participation  for  contracting \nand implementing subprojects. Since 2001, MRRD has successfully executed more than 50,000 \ncommunity participation contracts through the National Solidarity Program, with a total value of \naround  $4  billion. The flagship national  program for  rural  reconstruction is  largely funded  by  a \nWorld  Bank-managed  multi-donor  trust  fund.  MRRD  will  use  the  four  existing  project \nIrrigation  Rehabilitation  and \nimplementation  units  (PIUs)  under \nDevelopment Project,11 and will establish two additional PIUs in Bamyan and Takhar to support \nproject  implementation.  The  project  will  add  less  than  10%  to  the  typical  annual  community \nparticipation contract implementation workload for MRRD. For output 1, MEW will implement the \nrehabilitation  of  formal  irrigation  schemes,  most  of  which  it  manages.  It  will  utilize  the  project \nmanagement  office  (PMO)  and  project  implementation  office  (PIO)  established  under  the \ntranche  1  project  of  the  Water  Resources  Development  Investment  Program, 12  with  the \nproposed  project  financing  any  incremental  staff.  MEW  is  currently  implementing  three  ADB \nprojects.

Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Multitranche \nFinancing  Facility  and  Administration  of  Grant  and  Cofinancing  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Afghanistan  for  the \nWater Resources Development Investment Program. Manila. \n\nc   The  project  is  eligible  for  universal  procurement  under  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines \n\n(2013, as amended from time to time). \n\nd   The government has been advised that approval of advance contracting does not commit ADB to future financing \n\nof the project. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n19. \nProcurement  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2013,  as \namended  from  time  to  time)  taking  into  account  ADB\u2019s  Operations  Manual  instructions  on \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nprocurement  in  disaster  and  emergency  assistance  situations. 13 Recruitment  of  consulting \nservices  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as \namended from time to time). MRRD will contract communities to undertake rehabilitation works \nin  approximately  506  villages  or  groups  of  villages.  MRRD  will  manage  the  community \nparticipation  contracting  process  in  line  with  the  management  guidelines  detailed  in  the  PAM. \nPriority subprojects identified by MEW and MRRD are listed in the PAM (footnote 11).  \n \n20. \nAn  emergency  assistance  grant  normally  has  a  2-year  implementation  period.  In  the \nAfghan post-conflict situation where security issues and various constraints can cause delays, a \n3-year project implementation period is more appropriate.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\nA. \n \n21. \nAt fact-finding, security limitations constrained the conduct of due diligence for damaged \nirrigation  and  rural  roads  assets.  Extensive  damage  was  noted  in  a  wide  geographic  area;  a \ncommon  theme  was  that  failed  assets  had  been  built  to  lower  engineering  standards.  More \nrecent  construction  built  to  higher  standards  and  intended  to  be  resilient  to  more  extreme \nweather events survived the floods intact.  \n \n22. \nDamaged infrastructure will be repaired or replaced with a \u201cbuild-back-better\u201d philosophy \nto improve flood resilience through better infrastructure design, building materials, construction \nmethods,  and  supervision.  This  is  within  the  skills  set  of  the  implementing  agencies  and \nconstruction teams as assets built more recently have survived recent flood events. Community \ndevelopment councils (CDCs) will be used for all traditional irrigation and rural road construction \nwork, and therefore operation and maintenance will be within their capacity. MEW will manage \nlarger irrigation infrastructure using existing irrigation system management mechanisms.  \n \n23.  MRRD\u2019s ability to recruit sufficient engineers of adequate ability to design and supervise \nsubproject  implementation  will  be  key  to  the  success  of  output  1.  MRRD\u2019s  provincial \ndepartments  already  employ  numerous  engineers  recruited  from  their  own  province  or  other \nprovince; discussions in Balkh and Samangan indicate a sufficient pool of engineers on which to \ndraw.  All  CDCs  have  experience  in  managing  and  constructing  village  infrastructure  on  their \nown  account  and  under  the  National  Solidarity  Program.  During  fact-finding,  all  CDCs \nexpressed  confidence  in  the  availability  of  sufficient  skilled  and  unskilled  laborers  in their  own \nand/or  adjoining  villages  to  complete  subprojects  to  a  high  standard.  MEW  is  competent  and \nexperienced,  and  the  work  envisaged  is  within  their  technical  capacity.  Subproject  selection \ncriteria defined in the PAM requires an assessment of technical feasibility for all subprojects. \n \nB. \n \n24. \nIn accordance with ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy (2004), economic \nanalysis  for  the  subprojects  will  be  conducted  by  MRRD  and  MEW  before  subproject \nimplementation.  The  analysis  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the \nEconomic  Analysis  of  Projects,14 and  will  ensure  that  subproject  classes  have  an  economic \ninternal rate of return of at least 12% prior to implementation. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n                                                \n13 ADB. 2004. Disaster and Emergency Assistance. Operations Manual. OM D7/BP. Manila. \n14 ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \nGovernance \n\nThe project will reduce incremental recurrent costs through the replacement of damaged \n25. \nassets  with  improved  quality  structures  using  the  build-back-better  approach.  The  majority  of \nassets will be rebuilt using community participation contracts, and will be owned and maintained \nby the communities in the future. The communities will provide at least 7% in kind contribution \non average for all contracts procured with community participation. \n \nC. \n \nAnticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \n26. \nto  and  discussed  with  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. ADB reserves the right to investigate, audit, and examine \nthe  records  and  accounts  of  MRRD  and  MEW  directly  or  through  its  agents,  for  any  alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  project.  To  support  these \nefforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  are \nincluded in the grant agreements and the bidding documents under the project. \n \nFinancial management. MRRD and MEW are currently implementing ADB projects and \n27. \nhave  financial  management  skills  that  satisfy  ADB  requirements.  The  current  financial \nmanagement  system  of  the  ministries  is  capable  of  (i)  recording  the  required  financial \ntransactions and balances, (ii) providing regular and reliable financial statements and monitoring \nreports  during  project  implementation,  (iii)  safeguarding  financial  assets,  and  (iv)  preparing \nrequired financial documents to audit acceptable to ADB. The MRRD PIUs and MEW PIO are \nstaffed with experienced personnel familiar with ADB\u2019s Handbook for Borrowers on the Financial \nManagement  and  Analysis  of  Projects  (2005).  MOF  has  adequate  financial  management \ncapacity  to  satisfy  ADB  requirements  for  an  executing  agency,  records  required  financial \ntransactions  and  balances,  provides  regular  and  reliable  financial  statements  and  monitoring \nreports,  safeguards  financial  assets,  and  submits  the  required  financial  documents  in  an \nauditable form and format.  \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n \n28. \nProject  performance  management  system.  A  project  performance  management \nsystem will be established within 3 months of grant effectiveness.15 MEW will adapt the MRRD-\nmanaged system for its use. The database  will be updated and monitored monthly. MRRD will \nprovide quarterly reports to ADB. \n \nD. \n \nIn most cases, full irrigation would not be feasible for several years in the absence of the \n29. \nproject,  causing  widespread  hardship  and  hunger.  The  post-flood  emergency  repairs \nundertaken by the villages are not durable and will likely be lost again in the next flood, probably \nduring 2015. Consequently, in the absence of the project, agricultural production will be severely \nlimited.  In these  circumstances,  and  where  substantial  areas  of  land  can be  brought  back  into \nproduction in 1\u20132 years, financial returns are likely to be high. \n \n30. \nThe damage and loss assessment estimates that the irrigation outputs will benefit more \nthan  112,000  flood-affected  households  and the  village  road  outputs  will  benefit  87,000 flood-\naffected households (with some overlap between the two categories). This equates to almost 1 \nmillion  affected  people  in  15  of  the  most  severely  flood-affected  provinces.  The  main \n\n                                                \n15 The short time frame is considered feasible, since the  project performance management system will be similar to \n\nthat used for the Community-Based Irrigation Rehabilitation and Development project (footnote 14). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nbeneficiaries  will  be  farming  families  previously  benefiting  from  irrigation  systems,  and  village \npeople who will be able to have continued access to markets and regional centers. \n \n31. \nThe  implementation  modality  for  the  traditional  irrigation  and  rural  roads  activities  is \nsimilar to the National Solidarity Program, enabling farmers and local laborers to undertake the \nconstruction  under  the  guidance  of  MRRD  engineers.  Local  communities  will  therefore  benefit \nfrom  both  infrastructure  and  construction  income,  which  can  be  immediately  applied  to  cope \nwith  damaged  housing  and  economic  assets.  The  project  utilizes  an  inclusive  design  for \ncommunity engagement to encourage peace building in a post-conflict environment. \n\n \n32. \nThe  role  of  women  in  the  project  area  is  dictated  by  tradition,  with  women  largely \nengaged in unpaid work within the house compound. Women have expressed concerns about \nlack of food, income, work opportunities, health facilities, and potable water. Gender roles in the \nproject area are unlikely to change. Apart from improving irrigation water supplies, which has an \nimpact on household food security, the project will have a limited gender impact. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nto \n\nit  proposes \n\nrehabilitate  existing \n\nLand  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  project  is  categorized  C  for  involuntary \n33. \nresettlement.  As \nflood-damaged \nreconstruct  and \ninfrastructure,  the  project  team  is  confident  that  land  acquisition  and  physical  and  economic \ndisplacement  and/or  any  other  negative  impacts  are  not  required  under  the  project  and  its \noutputs. The project will not support any subprojects that require land acquisition or involuntary \nresettlement.   \n \n34. \nIndigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  categorized  C  in  relation  to  indigenous  peoples. \nAfghanistan  is  inhabited  by  ethnic  groups  across  its  34  provinces.  None  are  considered \nindigenous  peoples  as  defined  by  the  ADB  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  for  project \noperation  purposes.  Afghan  minority  ethnic  groups  (mainly  comprising  Kuchi  and  Hazara)  are \nnot found in the subproject areas, hence will not be impacted by subprojects in any manner. \n \n35. \nEnvironment.  The  project  is  categorized  B  for  environment.  A  rapid  environmental \nassessment checklist will be used at the time of subproject identification to determine the level \nof  study  required.  Subprojects  with  potential  significant  environmental  impacts  and  risks \n(category  A)  will  be  excluded  from  financing.  An  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework for the project was prepared and disclosed on the ADB website on 12 August 2014. \nThe  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  (i)  specifies  the  requirements  for \nsubproject selection, screening and categorization, assessment, consultation and participation, \nand environmental planning; (ii) assesses MRRD and MEW capacity for implementing national \nenvironmental laws and ADB requirements; (iii) describes monitoring and reporting procedures; \nand  (iv)  specifies  implementation  procedures  and  responsibilities.  Adverse  environmental \nimpacts such as noise, air and water pollution, and soil erosion could occur during construction. \nHowever,  these  are  site-specific  and  temporary  in  nature,  and  will  be  mitigated  through \nimplementation  of  environmental  management  plans.  An  initial  environmental  examination, \nincluding environmental management plans, will be prepared for any category B subproject. The \ninitial  environmental  examinations  and  relevant  environmental  monitoring  reports  will  be \ndisclosed on the ADB website.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fSecurity \n\nF. \n \n36. \nPoor security in the project provinces can delay project activities. Before implementation \ncommences, discussions will be held with local security agencies, particularly the police and the \nAfghanistan National Army. These consultations will continue on a regular basis. Relatively few \nsecurity  problems  are  envisaged  due  to  the  positive  contribution  of  the  project  to  economic \ndevelopment  in  the  project  areas.  Communication  links  will  be  established  with  every  CDC, \nwhich  will  provide  early  warning  of  any  security  issue.  Adequate  security  to  allow  subproject \nimplementation is a selection criterion. Where security prevents adequate design or supervision \nduring project implementation, subprojects may need to be put on hold or cancelled. A national \nproject  security  officer  will  be  appointed  to  advise  all  PIUs  on  security  matters.  A  budget  of \n$749,000 has been provided to meet security needs.  \n \nG. \n \n37.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4, and described together \nwith  the  procurement  risk  assessment  and  risk  mitigation  action  plan  in  the  overall  risk \nassessment and risk management plan.16 The integrated benefits and impacts are expected to \noutweigh the costs. \n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nFinancial malfeasance or corruption   Among other things, collusion of contractors is possible, this will be closely \n\nRisk Description \nSecurity problems delay \nimplementation \n\nFurther flooding sufficient to damage \nrepaired structures  \nSlow construction delays completion \nunder the Ministry of Rural \nRehabilitation and Development  \n\nDifficulty in attracting quality \nconsulting and construction firms to \nbid  \nDelayed award of contracts \n\nImplementing entity experience and \ncapacity \n\nReporting and monitoring  \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nMitigation Measures or Risk Management Plan \nSecurity is a significant issue in much of rural Afghanistan. The project design \nmitigates security risks through the use of community participation in \nimplementation and the use of nationals for field supervision functions. A \nbudget is provided to meet security needs. The project will withdraw from \nareas on the advice of its security adviser. \nThe project is adopting a build-back-better approach, which will ensure that \nassets are less likely to be damaged by future floods. \nMeasures include (i) recruiting many engineers to design and supervise \nsubprojects, (ii) using community participation processes to construct \nsubprojects, and (iii) moving engineers between provinces to support \nprograms that are experiencing time delays. \n\nmonitored through the use of third party monitoring and supervision \nconsultants and frequent review missions. \nAll packages of the Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW) except one are over \n$100,000 and should attract qualified contractors.  \n\nClose supervision of procurement activities by ADB through Afghanistan \nResident Mission staff and resident mission consultants. The implementation \nschedule will be closely monitored and support provided by the resident \nmission as needed. \nThe project management unit in the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and \nDevelopment and project management office in MEW are already \nimplementing ADB- and World Bank-financed projects. Their capacity will be \naugmented with additional offices and staff. Training will be provided through \navailable technical assistance resources to new staff as needed. \nThe PMOs are experienced in submitting the necessary reports in accordance \nwith ADB requirements. The same procedures will be followed in project \nreporting and control mechanisms. \n\n                                                \n16 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n38. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAM \nand grant documents.  \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed grants would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \n\n39. \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n \n\nthe grant not exceeding $40,000,000 to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan from \nADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  for  the  Northern  Flood-Damaged  Infrastructure \nEmergency Rehabilitation Project, on terms and conditions that are substantially \nin  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  grant  (Special  Operations) \nagreement presented to the Board; and \n\n(i)  \n\n \n(ii)  \n\nthe  grant  not  exceeding  $16,660,000  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Afghanistan,  to \nbe provided by the Afghanistan Infrastructure Trust Fund, for the Northern Flood-\nDamaged Infrastructure Emergency Rehabilitation Project, and the administration \nby  ADB  of  such  grant,  on  terms  and  conditions  that  are  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft grant (externally financed) agreement \npresented to the Board. \n\n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n \n \n9 October 2014 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nData Sources and \nReporting \nMechanisms \n\n \nNational Statistics Office \nprovincial poverty data \n\n \nPPMS and project \ncompletion survey \n \n \n \n \nPPMS and project \ncompletion survey \n\nAssumptions and Risks \n\nRisk \nFurther flooding may occur in the \naffected areas \n \nAssumption \nResponsible parties each provide \ntimely maintenance support to \nthe rehabilitated structures   \n \n \nRisk \nDeteriorating security prevents \ngrowth in agricultural productivity \n \n \n\nRisk \nDeteriorating security hinders \ndesign or civil works \n \n  \n\nDesign Summary \nImpact \nCommunity welfare in \nflood-affected project \nareas improved \n\nOutcome \nIrrigated agriculture \nand access to \nmarkets restored  \n\nOutputs \n1.
