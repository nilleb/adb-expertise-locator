THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed policy-\nbased loan to the Republic of Fiji for subprogram 2 of the Sustained Private Sector-Led Growth \nReform Program.1 \n \n2.  The proposed subprogram 2 will support the government in creating an environment in \nwhich the private sector is able to develop and better drive national economic growth through \ninvestment, by improving management of public finances; strengthening the performance of state-\nowned enterprises (SOEs) and opening opportunities for private investment; and enhancing the \npolicy,  legislative,  and  regulatory  environment  in  which  businesses  operate.  The  program \nsupports the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Strategy 2030 operational priority on strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity, particularly in small island developing states.2 \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  Development context. Fiji has had a stable government and policy direction for more \nthan a decade, with uninterrupted economic growth since 2010. Fiji has become a hub for \nneighboring South Pacific countries, but growth remains constrained by its remote location, \ndispersed islands, and small population. Fiji is also vulnerable to disasters triggered by natural \nhazards, including cyclones and floods. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has estimated \nsuch events may reduce Fiji\u2019s potential annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth by 2 \npercentage points.3 Historically, real GDP growth has been low and volatile, averaging 2.5% per \nyear from 1980 to 2018. \n \n4.  Economic performance. The government has driven growth performance since 2010 \nthrough expansionary fiscal policy, including by cutting taxes and increasing public investment, \nand accommodative monetary policy with relatively low interest rates. Efforts to improve SOE \nprofitability are working, but SOE productivity remains low, and they contributed just 4.0% to GDP \nin 2014 despite controlling up to 17% of the economy\u2019s total fixed assets.4 The potential gain from \nopening areas of the economy to the private sector is considerable. Economic growth averaged \n4.5% per year from 2014 to 2018. Growth is forecast at 2.9% in 2019 and 3.2% in 2020, based \non expectations of steady tourism expansion and sustained public and private enterprise growth. \n \n5.  Fiscal situation. Reliance on public sector-led growth has resulted in an average net \nfiscal deficit of 3.1% of GDP from FY2014 to FY2018 (Table 1). In FY2019, public expenditure is \nestimated at 28.9% of GDP, with a net fiscal deficit of 3.3% financed by external and domestic \nborrowings. The estimated FY2020 deficit is 2.6%, with debt equivalent to 44.8% of GDP. There \nis room for additional government borrowing, but the public debt ceiling is 50% of GDP. Given the \nlimited fiscal space, and the need to build fiscal buffers to ensure adequate resources for disaster \nresponse, the government needs to carefully balance fiscal consolidation and the resultant impact \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.

Macroeconomic challenges. Fiji\u2019s small size, remoteness, and susceptibility to disasters \nresult in a high-cost business environment that discourages private sector activity, especially \noutside tourism and construction.6 From 2010 to 2017, total investment averaged 18.9% of GDP. \nPublic investment increased from 3.3% of GDP in 2010\u20132013 to 5.8% of GDP in 2014\u20132017, but \nprivate and SOE investments declined from 13.9% of GDP to 11.4% of GDP during this period.7 \nFiji is seeking to stimulate a sustained increase in private investment to reduce reliance on public \ninvestment to drive economic growth. This will enable more rapid, broad-based growth, while \nensuring the government retains sufficient fiscal room to respond to shocks. The government \nacknowledges the need for more private investment to meet its long-term 5% growth target, which \nis estimated to require an investment\u2013GDP ratio of 25%. In 2018, the IMF advised the government \nthat sustaining high growth will require continuity in structural reforms that lower the cost of doing \nbusiness and improve the overall business climate.8 \n \n7.  ADB engagement. ADB has engaged in public sector management and private sector \ndevelopment through regional and country-specific technical assistance (TA) projects to support \npublic financial management (PFM), SOE reform, and business climate reform.9 Lessons from \nADB\u2019s engagement in these areas in Fiji and across the Pacific, including from implementing \nsubprogram  1,  are  to  (i)  identify  champions  to  strengthen  reform  commitment  and  lead \nimplementation, particularly for SOE reform and divestment; (ii) obtain endorsement so that \nreforms  are  not  derailed  if  leadership  changes;  (iii)  pursue  moderate,  sequenced  reforms, \nespecially if institutional capacity is limited; (iv) provide sufficient time to develop capacity and \ninstitutionalize reforms; (v) meet with the government specialists responsible for undertaking \n                                                \n5  ADB has recognized the important role policy-based lending can play in these circumstances (Independent \nEvaluation Department. 2018.

The program has identified \nchampions  in  each  ministry  and  meets  regularly  with  permanent  secretaries  to  ensure \ncommitment will withstand staff changes. Improved coordination of TA support from ADB and \nother development partners has increased government capacity to complete reforms while \nreinforcing the program\u2019s analytical underpinning (footnote 9). \n \nB.  Policy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n8.  Government strategy. The government\u2019s National Development Plan, 2017\u20132036 (NDP) \nenvisions inclusive socioeconomic development through a strategy to become a regional South \nPacific hub for business, transport, communications, and other services; and targets a fourfold \nincrease in per capita income by 2036.10 To achieve this goal, the government recognizes the \nneed for greater private investment and participation by accelerating structural reforms. \n \n9.  Structural reform program. Since 2007, the government has introduced substantive and \nprogressive structural reforms to improve the business environment and opportunities for private \nsector-driven growth. With support from ADB and other development partners, the government is \naccelerating efforts to increase private investment. Priority areas for implementation of NDP \nreforms  are  (i)  fiscal  management,  particularly  PFM;  (ii)  the  policy,  legal,  and  institutional \nframework  for  SOEs  and  public\u2013private  partnerships  (PPPs);  and  (iii)  the  business  and \ninvestment climate.11 \n \n10.  Assistance modality. The government has requested a programmatic policy-based loan \nseries with three subprograms (2018, 2019, and 2020) to support NDP implementation. The \ngovernment, ADB, and the World Bank have agreed on substantive policy actions that require \nsufficient  time  for  preparation  and  constituency  building  to  garner  political  support.  The \nsequencing of reforms over three subprograms (i) accommodated the financing need for FY2018, \nthrough subprogram 1, approved in June 2018 for $15 million; and (ii) matches further program \nfinancing  to  anticipated  budget  needs,  while  allowing  time  for  effective  and  sustained \nimplementation. The programmatic approach allows for prioritization across multiple reform areas \nto account for limited implementation capacity, while providing flexibility to respond to emerging \nopportunities and constraints. \n \n11.  Alignment. The program (i) will help the government achieve inclusive socioeconomic \ndevelopment (para. 8); (ii) is fully aligned with the government\u2019s policy priorities in national budget \ndocuments and the NDP; (iii) is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2019\u20132023 \nfor Fiji and Pacific Approach, 2016\u20132019 in its focus on reducing the cost of doing business, \nmanaging risks from natural and economic shocks, and enabling value creation by supporting \nprivate sector growth;12 and (iv) with regards to Strategy 2030, (a) directly supports the operational \npriority of strengthening institutional capacity for governance by strengthening the quality and \ncapacity of public institutions to undertake reforms and promote private sector development; and \n                                                \n10 Government of Fiji, Ministry of Economy. 2017. 5-Year & 20-Year National Development Plan: Transforming Fiji. \nSuva. \n11 Sector Assessment (Summary): Public Sector Management (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n2); and ADB. 2018.

Policy actions. Implementation of the government\u2019s structural reform agenda underpins \nthe provision of policy-based lending from ADB and the World Bank.13 Subprogram 2 actions build \non reforms undertaken through subprogram 1 and provide direction for subsequent indicative \ntriggers for subprogram 3, ensuring that formal policy underpinnings are in place and reforms are \ncredible, consistent, and predictable. Under subprogram 2, ADB supports 21 policy actions across \nthree reform areas contained in the policy matrix (Appendix 4) and described in paras. 13\u201319.  \n \n13.  Some indicative actions for subprogram 2 presented in the documentation for subprogram \n1 were adjusted.14 Nonetheless, the overall strength of subprogram 2 has been maintained given \nearly and overachievement of some policy actions, addition of new policy actions, changes to \nincrease the efficiency of policy actions in supporting program outcomes, and the relatively less \ncentral nature of delayed actions.15 \n(i)  One indicative subprogram 3 action was brought forward to subprogram 2: the \ncirculation of a draft investment bill to stakeholders upon the approval of an \ninvestment policy statement. The subprogram 2 policy action on divestments and \nPPPs was surpassed, with two transactions (only one was required). \n(ii)  Two substantial actions were added to subprogram 2:(a) reforms to the recruitment \nmethod  for  SOE  directors,  which  supported  merit-based  appointments  and \nincreased representation of women on SOE boards; and (b) passage of the \nEmployment Relations (Budget Amendment) Act 2018, which includes reforms to \nmaternity and family leave policies to enhance the ability of women to remain in \nthe paid workforce and to provide men with parental leave. \n(iii)  Two actions in subprogram 2 were changed to more directly support the outputs: \n(a) the Ministry of Economy (MOE) will not conduct a diagnostic study for the \nmedium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) given that MTEF impediments are \nunderstood at the working level, and instead created new budget templates for use \nby ministries for the FY2020 budget, resulting in more immediate benefits through \nincreased accuracy of forward estimates, and thereby supporting an effective \nMTEF; and (b) regarding the competition and consumer policy framework, the \ngovernment will consult government stakeholders and the private sector more \nwidely before drafting a new policy framework, which is expected to improve the \nquality of draft legislation and its acceptance by the private sector. The change \ndoes not impact the indicative action for subprogram 3. \n(iv)  Two actions have been delayed from subprogram 2 to subprogram 3. Because of \ntheir interrelated nature, the privatization guidelines will come into force with the \nPublic Enterprises Act 2019 during subprogram 3. Action to strengthen regulations \nand processes regarding building permits will now include the streamlining of all \nforms and their access though a new online portal, which will substantially reduce \nthe compliance burden for applicants. \nFollowing these changes, the government has completed all 21 actions that form subprogram 2. \n                                                \n13 The NDP forms the basis for reforms contained in the policy matrix (Appendix 4). The World Bank policy matrix for \nits parallel program contains seven prior actions, of which three are common to ADB\u2019s subprogram 2. The three \ncommon actions relate to ADB actions 2.1.6 (policy framework for granting government guarantees), 3.1.2 (approved \ninvestment policy statement), and 3.2.1 (regulations under the Personal Property Securities Act 2017). \n14 Approved Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Sustained Private Sector-Led \nGrowth Reform Program Subprogram 1 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 Further details and reasons for the changes are summarized in in Changes from Subprogram 2 Indicative Policy \nActions to Final Policy Actions (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "5 \n14.  Fiscal  management.  The  government  recognizes  that  sound  PFM  systems  and \nprocesses that promote fiscal discipline, strategic allocation of resources, and efficient service \ndelivery provide the private sector with policy certainty and business confidence as well as more \ncost-effective public services. The following subprogram 2 policy actions support this outcome: \n(i)  Public financial management framework. Building on subprogram 1 reform \nactions, the MOE completed several reforms to improve the PFM framework as \npart  of  subprogram  2  and  has  continued  to  implement  the  Public  Financial \nManagement Improvement Programme, 2016\u20132019 approved in subprogram 1 by \n(a) holding consultations with stakeholders as part of the review of the Financial \nManagement Act 2004;16 the review will strengthen accountability and clarify the \nfinancial  authority  of  the  permanent  secretaries,  a  key  first  step  toward  the \ndevolution of decision-making authority; and (b) improving the recording and \nmonitoring of revenue arrears, including preparing an aging debtors report with \nrevenue summaries published in the FY2019 national budget supplement.17 In \naddition, updated budget templates were developed for use in preparing the \nFY2020  national  budget,18  which  will  help  improve  the  accuracy  of  forward \nestimates. Improved national budgets will provide the private sector with better \neconomic data upon which to base private investment decisions. Finally, the \nMinistry of Education, Heritage and the Arts; the Ministry of Health and Medical \nServices; and the Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation (MOWCPA) \nhave participated in an operational plan framework pilot that combines and aligns \nservice delivery, staffing, and corporate planning requirements. \n(ii)  Debt management. In subprogram 1 the government approved the FY2018 Debt \nManagement Strategy, a rolling debt management strategy to be adjusted with the \ngovernment\u2019s annual financing needs while minimizing financing costs. Ongoing \ncommitment to improved debt management was evidenced in subprogram 2 with \nthe inclusion of the FY2019 Debt Management Strategy in the national budget \nsupplement, and increased transparency by publishing quarterly debt reports on \nthe MOE website, including updates on domestic and external debt levels and \ncontingent liabilities. The strategy includes risk management strategies to maintain \nstable debt servicing costs while considering exchange rate risks, and to maintain \na stable and affordable debt maturity structure to reduce the burden of resettlement \nand minimize exposure. The strategy is key to the government\u2019s medium-term debt \npolicy, which focuses on maintaining debt sustainability by reducing fiscal deficits \nand adopting sound risk management strategies. \n(iii)  Financial management. ADB TA enabled the government to commission a review \n(finalized in early 2019) of the financial management information system to assess \nwhether this software is user-friendly and fit-for-purpose. The report was presented \nto the Minister for Economy in May 2019 and recommends a new system be \nintroduced. Following the subprogram 1 focus on making payments more efficient, \nthe  government  now  makes  75%  of  payments  digitally,  including  for  private \nbusinesses that supply the government with goods and services. \n \n                                                \n16 Government  of  Fiji.  2016.

Reform progress \nwill be assessed and the findings will guide the updating of the Public Financial Management Improvement \nProgramme, 2016\u20132019. \n ", "6 \n15.  Subprogram 3 will build on these reforms through Cabinet approval of the revised Public \nFinancial Management Bill. Government public expenditure reviews will help evaluate public \nexpenditure in terms of effectiveness, consistency with priorities, and results; and explore gender-\nresponsive budgeting activities. Following the pilot of the new operational plan framework, it will \nbe implemented by three additional line ministries. The MOE will begin implementing decisions \nfrom the financial management information system review by developing clear business and \ntechnical requirements and issuing a public tender. The government will continue  implementing \nelectronic payments through digital platforms. ADB (footnote 9) and development partners\u2014\nincluding the governments of Australia and New Zealand, the World Bank, and the Pacific \nFinancial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC)\u2014are supporting these reforms. \n \n16.  Policy, legal, and institutional framework for state-owned enterprises and public\u2013\nprivate partnerships. The profitability of Fiji\u2019s SOE portfolio has improved markedly since 2010, \nbut productivity remains low in many SOEs, and the government is seeking to improve their \nperformance (para. 4),19 including through SOE divestment, outsourcing, and PPPs to increase \nprivate sector investment, innovation, and expertise. However, progress has been hindered by a \nlack of consistent and predictable policies and processes. With ADB support (footnote 9), the \nDepartment of Public Enterprises has progressively implemented the following subprogram 2 \npolicy actions to address these issues:20 \n(i)  State-owned enterprises reform. A Public Enterprises Bill 2019 was tabled and \npassed by Parliament, with validation by the Parliament Standing Committee on \nJustice, Law and Human Rights for review and consultation, including gender \nanalysis. The act is expected to come into force in the fourth quarter of 2019, \nestablishes a clear framework to strengthen SOE governance, transparency, and \naccountability;  and  improve  performance  and  service  delivery.21  Recruitment \nmethods for SOE directors have been improved, including by widening the search \nfor eligible candidates; the percentage of female directors has increased from 8.4% \nin 2017 to 16.4% in 2018.22 To better monitor the fiscal risks associated with SOEs, \na new fiscal risk assessment framework has been approved for use by the MOE, \nand the Cabinet has approved a new policy framework for government guarantees \nfor  SOEs\u2019  financial  liabilities,  with  guarantees  subject  to  Parliamentary \nauthorization and written guarantee agreements with the government. \n(ii)  Divestment and public\u2013private partnerships. The government has completed \ntwo  transactions  between  March  2018  and  May  2019,  with  a  concession \nagreement signed for the upgrade and operation of the Lautoka and Ba hospitals, \nand the sale of the Government Printing and Stationery Department. The PPP \npolicy approved under subprogram 1 has come into force, and the government has \nappointed  the  International  Finance  Corporation  as  a  transaction  advisor  to \ndevelop a PPP for affordable and climate-resilient housing. \n \n17.  Subprogram 3 provides for the Department of Public Enterprises to conduct training \nprograms on the compliance requirements of the Public Enterprises Act 2019 for 75% of directors \n                                                \n19 The portfolio\u2019s average return on equity for 2011\u20132017 was 8.4%, with a return on assets of 3.6%. For 2002\u20132010, \nthe average return on equity was \u20130.2% and the return on assets was 0.0%. \n20 The Ministry of Public Enterprises merged with the MOE in 2019 and is now the Department of Public Enterprises \nwithin the MOE. \n21 Among other key features, the bill (i) harmonizes different forms of SOEs under a single framework; (ii) establishes \na framework for the identification, costing, contracting, and financing of community-service obligations that applies \nto all SOEs; (iii) makes the minister for public enterprises solely responsible for SOEs, with clear duties and \nresponsibilities; and (iv) strengthens the director appointment processes and directors\u2019 duties and responsibilities. \n22 As of 31 December 2017, 9 of 107 directors were female (8.4%); by 31 December 2018, 20 of 122 directors were \nfemale (16.4%). \n ", "7 \nand senior management of SOEs.23 To strengthen financial oversight of SOEs, the government \nwill develop and implement a new policy framework for onlending. Privatization guidelines will \ncome into force and be made available to the public. The government will reform at least one \nmore SOE (through corporatization, partial privatization, divestment, liquidation, or substantial \nrestructuring; or formation of a PPP). It will develop PPP implementation guidelines, including on \nthe  PPP  procurement  process,  and  appoint  transaction  advisors  to  support  potential  PPP \ntransactions. ADB will continue to support these actions (footnote 9). \n \n18.  Business and investment climate. Foreign direct investment in Fiji averaged 7.1% of \nGDP from 2012 to 2017 and is inadequate to support the targeted economic growth rates (para. \n6). This reflects a weak investment climate affected by policy uncertainty, delays in addressing \nunderlying structural constraints, and gaps in the commercial legal framework. The government \nhas introduced progressive structural reforms since 2007 (para. 9), and (supported by ADB and \nother development partners) has taken steps to improve the business and investment climate in \nconsultation with the private sector through the following subprogram 2 policy actions: \n(i)  Foreign  investment  and  trade.  To  boost  investor  confidence  and  reduce \nuncertainty regarding the  resolution  of  international  commercial  disputes,  the \nInternational Arbitration Act 2017 (which provides for arbitrations seated in Fiji and \nthe enforcement of foreign arbitral awards in Fiji) has come into force.24 To comply \nwith its World Trade Organization (WTO) Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) \ncommitments, the government has completed four category B commitments.25 In \naddition,  the  Ministry  of  Industry,  Trade  and  Tourism  (MITT)  consulted \nstakeholders  on  a  draft  investment  bill,  following  Cabinet  approval  of  the \ninvestment  policy  statement.  Collectively  these  reforms  support  an  improved \nbusiness environment and specifically assist trade across borders. \n(ii)  Access to finance. Regulations under the Personal Property Securities Act 2017 \nappoint the Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) as the registrar. The act will enable lenders \nto accept movable assets as security for loans more easily, cheaply, and securely. \nThis is of particular benefit to businesses owned by women, who are less likely to \nhave fixed assets, such as land. \n(iii)  Ease of doing business. The government has circulated draft bills to enhance \nthe  legal  framework  for  trademarks,  designs,  and  patents  for  stakeholder \ncomments, and consultations have been held regarding the review of the Fijian \nCompetition and Consumer Commission Act 2010, both of which are fundamental \nfor  private  sector  development  and  entrepreneurship.  A  new  action  under \nsubprogram 2 seeks to make it easier for mothers to enter and remain in the paid \nworkforce. The government has increased paid maternity leave from 84 to 98 days, \nand introduced paternity leave and family care leave through an amendment of the \nEmployment Relations Act 2007, which was passed by Parliament.26 \n                                                \n23 A significant improvement over 2017, when less than 25% of directors and senior managers were trained. \n24 International arbitration provides an alternative, cost-effective, and time-efficient means of dispute resolution between \nparties. It is recognized in 160 countries, including Fiji\u2019s major sources of foreign direct investment. Fiji\u2019s International \nArbitration Act 2017 implements Fiji\u2019s treaty obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and \nEnforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, known as the New York Convention, which it acceded to in 2010. Fiji\u2019s chief \njustice has also established high court rules on international arbitration proceedings defining the court\u2019s powers and \nresponsibilities. \n25 Category B commitments are provisions that the WTO member will implement after a transitional period following \nthe entry into force of the TFA. The four category B commitments implemented are: Article 6.1 on General Disciplines \non Fees and Charges Imposed on or in Connection with Importation and Exportation; Article 8 on Border Agency \nCooperation; Article 10.6 on Use of Customs Brokers; and Article 12 on Customs Cooperation. \n26 To ease the extra cost to businesses related to these changes, the government introduced a 150% tax deduction for \nall businesses for salaries and wages paid to employees during paternity and family care leave. According to ADB. \n ", "8 \n19.  Under Subprogram 3 Cabinet will approve legislation for tabling in Parliament, including \nbills related to investment, trademarks, designs, and patents. Four additional WTO TFA category \nB commitments will be achieved. The Regulation of Building Permits Act 2017 will come into force, \nmembers will be appointed to the Building Permits Evaluation Committee, regulations will be put \nin place that include standardized forms, and an online information portal will be launched. The \ngovernment will establish the personal property securities registry, which will coincide with coming \ninto force of the Personal Property Securities Act 2017, thus completing the reform. The Cabinet \nwill also approve a new policy framework relating to competition and consumer law. \n \n20.  Gender.  Subprogram  2  is  classified  effective  gender  mainstreaming  and  improves \nwomen\u2019s  access  to  services,  opportunities,  and  decision-making  by:  (i)  including  open \nconsultation and gender analysis (validated by the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and \nHuman Rights) of all legislation (the Public Enterprises Act 2019, International Arbitration Act \n2017,  and  Personal  Property  Securities  Act  2017);  (ii)  when  reviewing  fiscal  management \nsystems, consulting  with the MOWCPA, and prioritizing the trialing of new planning frameworks \nby  the  MOWCPA  to  aid  with  service  delivery,  staffing,  and  planning  requirements;  (iii) \nstrengthening recruitment methods and merit-based appointments for SOE directors, leading to \nwomen\u2019s increased representation on SOE boards (para. 16(i)); (iv) improving women\u2019s economic \nempowerment and access to finance through the Personal Property Securities Act 2017, which \nenables lenders to more easily, cheaply, and securely accept movable assets as security for \nloans,  which  will  particularly  benefit  businesses  owned  by  women;  and  (v)  enacting  new \nprovisions in Fiji\u2019s Employment Relations Act 2007 to support women in the workforce by \nextending maternity leave and introducing paternity and family leave. \n \n21.  ADB engagement. ADB has a long-standing engagement with the government on SOE \nand business climate reforms. Support for fiscal management and PFM reforms increased during \n2018 and 2019. ADB\u2019s strong relationship with the government has helped ADB play an important \nrole in identifying and implementing critical structural reforms. Specifically, ADB has directly \nsupported drafting of policy or legislation on PPPs, SOEs, international arbitration, and personal \nproperty securities; and ADB has provided implementation support. The programmatic approach \nhas enabled the sequencing of complex reforms, with ADB TA involvement across all reform \nareas in support of all subprograms, aligned with development partners. \n \n22.  Development partner coordination. The program is part of a multi-development partner \npackage of support for structural reform. It is aligned with the World Bank\u2019s development policy \noperation, also planned for approval in 2019, and the Government of New Zealand\u2019s grants for \n2019 and 2020. The World Bank aligned three of its seven actions to ADB actions (footnote 13), \nand the Government of New Zealand disbursed in August 2019 based on the completion of the \nADB policy actions. ADB is working closely with the World Bank, the governments of Australia \nand New Zealand, and PFTAC to support implementation.27 \n \nC.  Impacts of the Reform \n \n23.  Implementation of the policy actions for the overall reform program will improve the quality \nof budget systems and institutions; improve the productivity and competitiveness of SOEs; and \nhelp create new businesses and formal job growth, including for women.28 Research indicates \n                                                \n2018. Women and Business in the Pacific. Manila,  maternity leave provisions are important for women\u2019s continued \nparticipation in the workforce. Women were recognized to be underrepresented in the Pacific workforce. \n27 The IMF confirmed on 9 May 2019 that the Staff Report for the 2018 Article IV Consultation (footnote 8) may serve \nas the International Monetary Fund Assessment Letter (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nthat strong budget institutions help improve fiscal balances and public external debt outcomes, \nsupporting  expectations  that  fiscal  management  reforms  will  improve  the  fiscal  balance.29 \nImproving the policy, legal, and institutional framework for SOEs will strengthen governance, \ntransparency, and accountability; improve performance and service delivery; reduce contingent \nliabilities;  create  room  for  private  investment;  and  improve  the  reliability,  efficiency,  and \naffordability of public services. Fiji\u2019s business environment reforms are expected to increase its \nease of doing business score from 60.71 in 2017 to at least 64.0 by 2020,30 which would bring Fiji \nclose to the performance of Malta (65.43) and South Africa (66.03) in 2018. An analysis of whether \nbusiness regulatory changes are linked to economic outcomes found that a 10-point improvement \nin the ease of doing business score is linked to a 0.5\u20130.6 increase in new businesses per 1,000 \nworking-age adults.31 When applied to Fiji, this suggests a 3-point improvement in the ease of \ndoing business score can be expected to create about 95\u2013114 additional businesses per year. \nThis would create jobs and income-earning opportunities and thereby help address remaining \npoverty and achieve inclusive socioeconomic development. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n24.  The government has requested a regular loan of $65 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance subprogram 2.32 The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n \n25.  Parallel collaborative partner cofinancing from the World Bank consists of up to $64 million \nfor subprogram 2, and the Government of New Zealand will provide a grant of $1.7 million (NZ$2.5 \nmillion).33  The  subprogram  2  financing  will  help  meet  the  government\u2019s  total  financing \nrequirements for FY2020 and FY2021, projected at F$1.6 billion. The gap will be filled by \nconcessional project loans and domestic bonds. The program has considered the government\u2019s \nfinancing needs, its ability to rebuild fiscal buffers to respond to disasters triggered by natural \nhazards, the availability of alternative financing and estimated financial support from other \npartners, and debt sustainability. \n \n                                                \n29 E.

Public Financial Management and Fiscal \nOutcomes in Sub-Saharan African Heavily-Indebted Poor Countries. IMF Working Paper. 08/217. Washington, DC: \nIMF. \n30 Reforms under the program are expected to improve scores for the following Doing Business topics: (i) getting credit \n(personal property securities reform); (ii) enforcing contracts (international arbitration reform); (iii) trading across \nborders (WTO TFA implementation); and (iv) dealing with construction permits (building permits reform). The name \n\u201cdistance to frontier\u201d was changed to the \u201cease of doing business\u201d in 2019. The process for calculating the score is \nunchanged (World Bank. Doing Business). \n31 The analysis of 2003\u20132013 panel data for more than 180 countries used the \u201cdistance to frontier\u201d score (footnote \n30). R. Divanbeigi and R. Ramalho. 2015. Business Regulations and Growth. Policy Research Working Paper. 7299. \nWashington, DC: World Bank. \n32 Before its 7 June 2019 FY2020 budget announcement, the government requested that ADB financing be rebalanced \nbetween subprograms 2 and 3, with $10 million brought forward from subprogram 3 to subprogram 2 to reflect revised \nforecasts of financing needs. \n33 At the time of approval of the programmatic approach and subprogram 1, the World Bank was expected to provide \ncofinancing of $35 million for subprogram 2. The government requested that the World Bank add its International \nDevelopment Assistance allocation to the operation. The Government of New Zealand is a new cofinancing partner. \n ", "10 \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n26.  The implementation period for subprogram 2 is March 2018\u2013March 2020, which covers \nthe preparation and completion of the policy actions for subprogram 2 that was carried out from \nMarch 2018 to May 2019. The corresponding period for subprogram 3 is expected to be from May \n2019 to March 2020. The MOE will continue to be the executing agency for subprogram 2. The \nMOE has taken the lead in coordinating subprogram 2 action implementation, engaging in \nprogress meetings with the MITT and the RBF as implementing agencies, and providing updates \nto ADB. The MOE has also actively coordinated policy dialogue and needed technical support for \nthe program reforms with partners, including ADB, the governments of  Australia and New \nZealand, IMF\u2019s PFTAC, and the World Bank. Proceeds of the policy-based loan will be withdrawn \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time).34 \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n27.  Following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), subprogram 2 is classified category \nC for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. Program activities will \nbe confined to policy and institutional reforms. No activity will result in or lead to involuntary \nresettlement, or negatively affect indigenous peoples or the environment. \n \n28.  The program is expected to have positive social outcomes (para. 23). The public sector is \na  key  provider  of  infrastructure  and  services  to  low-income  households.  Improved  fiscal \nmanagement will help ensure that the government has the resources to respond to economic \nshocks and disasters triggered by natural hazards (which tend to have an adverse effect on the \npoor) while maintaining critical public services. Improving policies and institutions for SOE reforms \nand private sector participation will increase competition and make basic goods and services \nmore affordable, while creating more jobs and opportunities in Fiji. The government also agreed \nto comply with ADB information disclosure and consultation requirements. \n \n29.  Risks. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 2 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.35 PFM systems are assessed as capable \nof supporting reliable service provision. Policy reforms and TA support will address other fiduciary \nrisks. The overall risk of the operation is moderate. To mitigate risks, the program focuses on \nareas where the government has a strong record, selects options for policy actions in subprogram \n3 that will continue to maintain reform momentum, and facilitates strong coordination with other \ndevelopment partners to ensure timely provision of TA to support implementation. \n \nTable 2: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nThe government cannot  The FY2018 budget included civil service reforms, such as an adjustment to civil \nimplement the policy reform  service wages, and some improvements in retention are being seen.

ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, the MOE, the MITT, and the RBF. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n31.  The government and the MOE have assured ADB that implementation of subprogram 2 \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anti-corruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the loan agreement. It is a condition of loan effectiveness for the government to meet the policy \nactions before the release of the tranche for the second subprogram, and these policy actions \ncontinue to be in effect. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n32.  I am satisfied that the proposed policy-based loan would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nloan of $65,000,000 to the Republic of Fiji for subprogram 2 of the Sustained Private Sector-Led \nGrowth Reform Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in regular terms, with interest to \nbe determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility; for a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \n \n  Takehiko Nakao \n21 August 2019  President \n ", "12  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nCountry\u2019s Overarching Development Objective \nInclusive socioeconomic development achieved (National Development Plan 2017\u20132036)a \n \nPerformance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nEffect of the Reform  By 2021:     \nPrivate sector-led  a.
