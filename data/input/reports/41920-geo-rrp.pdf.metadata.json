I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nsenior loan of up to $25 million to Joint Stock Commercial Bank of Georgia (BOG) for the \npurpose of onlending to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Georgia (the ADB loan).  \n \n2.  The ADB loan is to be part of a $125 million term loan provided by ADB and Citibank as \ncoarrangers with Citibank underwriting $100 million. The proposed ADB loan is ADB\u2019s first \ntransaction in Georgia since the country joined ADB as a new member in February 2007. \nAppendix 1 provides the design and monitoring framework. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: BACKGROUND, CHALLENGES, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Georgian Economy: Overview and Outlook \n3.  Economic  growth  in  Georgia  continued  at  an  impressive  pace  in  2006  (real  gross \ndomestic product [GDP] growth was 9.4% in 2006, 7.7% in 2005, and 6.2% in 2004),1 despite \nrapidly rising energy prices; deteriorating relations with its main trading partner, the Russian \nFederation; and a decline in agricultural output. This strong performance was largely due to a \ncombination of macroeconomic stability, and the dramatically improved business environment \nresulting  from  the  implementation  of  several  reforms.  GDP  growth  was  further  fueled  by \nmanufacturing, services, and construction. The sanctions imposed by the Russian Federation in \nmid-2006 have thus far had a limited impact on the Georgian economy. Export growth remained \nstrong in the latter half of 2006, as Russian markets were replaced by those of other countries \nas the main destination for most exports (except wine); remittance flows remained steady. \n \n4.  Inflation subsided by year-end 2006 to 8.8%, well below the peak of 14.5% recorded in \nJuly 2006. The current account rose to 15.2% of GDP.2 Strong tourism receipts, reflecting a \nsharp increase in tourists from Armenia, offset higher than expected import volume growth, \nmainly  in  durable  goods.  The  capital  account  strengthened,  bolstered  by  foreign  direct \ninvestment inflows, which increased to $890 million in 2006 (excluding privatization). \n \n5.  Georgia\u2019s fiscal performance in 2006 was more expansionary than planned. In contrast \nto the commitment to limit the annual deficit to reduce inflationary pressures, spending overruns \nof almost 1% of GDP involved mainly capital and military expenditures. As of year-end 2006, the \nfiscal  deficit  was  2.9%  of  GDP,  exceeding  projections.3  Despite  the  fiscal  overspending, \nmonetary policy was on track. National Bank of Georgia (NBG) successfully intervened in the \nforeign exchange market to prevent a temporary surge in foreign exchange inflows related to \nBOG\u2019s initial public offering (IPO) from influencing the exchange rate. Georgia\u2019s total external \ndebt continued to decline in 2006, falling to $1.6 billion (20.6% of GDP)4 from $1.7 billion \n(25.8% of GDP) in 2005.  \n \n                                                 \n1  Government estimate, per Central and West Asia Regional Department of ADB.   \n2  Ministry of Finance. \n3  Statistic of 2.9% from the International Monetary Fund. Georgian Ministry of Finance statistics state 1.9% on a \ncommitment basis, and 2.2% on a cash basis.   \n4  Available: http://www.nbg.gov.ge/NBG_New/Publications/Buletin/Last/B-5.2e.xls provides the NBG estimate for \ntotal external foreign debt-to-GDP ratio. The International Monetary Fund presents a slightly higher percentage \n(21.8%)  for  public  and  publicly  guaranteed  external  debt  (nominal),  as  a  percentage  of  GDP.  Available: \nhttp://www.imf.ge/aattach/272.pdf. \n \n ", "2   \n6.  Notwithstanding the generally positive economic outlook in the medium-term, certain \nconcerns exist. The ongoing effects of Russian sanctions, particularly the impact of higher \nenergy prices, are expected to reduce economic growth, with real GDP growth expected to \nmoderate in 2007 to 6.5%. Higher energy prices will also create inflationary pressure; however, \nthis should be offset by the slowing of the economy and inflation is projected to actually fall to \n7%  in  2007.  The  ongoing  challenge  for  the  Government  of  Georgia  will  be  to  maintain \nmacroeconomic stability while moving forward with ongoing reforms.  \n \n7.  The  World Bank  named  Georgia  as  the  number  one  reformer  worldwide5  and  the \nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) cites the country as having the \nthird lowest corruption in the Eastern European region.6 Georgia is rated by Standard & Poor\u2019s \nas B+/Stable/B and Fitch Ratings as BB-/Stable/B. \n \nB.  The Banking Sector  \n1.  Overview  \n8.  With the consolidation of the banking sector over the past several years (247 banks in \n1995 to 21 in 2006), seven commercial banks currently dominate the market, accounting for \nnearly 90% of total assets and gross loans. The banking sector has experienced rapid growth \nover the past few years in line with overall economic growth in Georgia. Private credit grew on \naverage by 62% year-on-year in 2006, after averaging 60% growth in 2005. Demand deposits \nincreased by more than 70% in both 2004 and 2005, and by 58% in 2006 (Table 1). Appendix 2 \nprovides details on the banking sector. \n \nTable 1: Georgian Banking Sector Aggregate Figures, 2005\u20132006  \n($ million) \n \nAggregate Figure  2005  2006  Growth (%) \nTotal Assets  1,421  2,467  73.5 \nGross Loans  965  1,565  62.1 \nDeposits  858  1,359  58.3 \nShareholder\u2019s Equity  267  524  96.0 \nNet Income  35  54  57.5 \n              Source: National Bank of Georgia. \n \n9.  Penetration of the Georgian banking system is still fairly low compared to most Central \nand Eastern European (CEE) and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries, and \nmultibranch banks have difficulty attaining a critical mass of operations. Despite the system\u2019s \nvery rapid growth over the last few years, even the leading banks have only a modest scale of \noperations and asset bases compared to those in more developed markets. The ratio of money \nsupply to GDP is very low in Georgia compared with other transition countries, suggesting that \nlending activity can be increased, particularly to the industry and agriculture sectors, without \nsignificant  overheating.  The  potential  for  market  growth  is  further  emphasized  by  the \ncomparatively low ratio of gross loans to GDP (15%), the low card penetration as percentage of \n                                                 \n5  World  Bank.  2007.

Appendix 4 provides a comparison and peer group analysis (by customer, return on \nequity,  network,  and  net  commission  income)  of  the  top  seven  banks.  Given  the  high \nconcentration among the top seven banks, consolidation is unlikely; however it is very likely \noutside this group. All of the top five banks have significant foreign ownership comprised of \nportfolio  investors,  as  in  case  of  Bank  of  Georgia,  development  financial  institutions,  and \nstrategic investors.  Bank Republic is controlled by Societe Generale, VTB Bank Georgia is \nowned by Russian Vneshtorgbank; Procredit Bank is controlled by a foreign holding company, \nwhich in turn is controlled by foreign investors, and HSBC recently acquired a banking license to \nstart operations in Georgia.  Further significant foreign players considering entering the market \nwould more likely target acquiring a local bank (BOG being one of the possible acquisition \ntargets) rather than creating greenfield operations.  \n \n11.  In 2006, NBG published a development strategy for the Georgian banking system for \n2006\u20132009, identifying several goals. Foremost among these is increasing the depth, efficiency, \nand sustainability of the banking system. To achieve these objectives, NBG set out a timetable \nfor implementing the next stage of reform measures, including harmonizing domestic banking \nlegislation with relevant European Union laws and progressively reducing reserve requirements, \nalthough reserve requirements have been gradually increased for GEL funds from 2% to 13% in \n2007. Specific initiatives include (i) consolidating the banking sector by increasing the minimum \ncapital requirement for all commercial banks to GEL12 million (approximately $6.8 million) in \nJuly 2007; (ii) amending legislation to allow for the enforcement of \u201cfit and proper\u201d regulations; \n(iii) strengthening anti-money-laundering legislation; and (iv) sanctioning the establishment of \ncredit information bureaus.  \n \nC.  Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises  \n12.  SME Sector. SMEs have a significant role to play in all of ADB\u2019s developing member \ncountry  economies  and  are  often  key  drivers  of  employment,  economic  growth,  and \ndevelopment, making a significant impact on GDP. The development of SMEs is therefore an \nimportant engine of growth and a key contributor to poverty reduction by creating employment, \nincreasing individual incomes, and generating tax revenues. In Georgia, however, the SME \nsector is severely constrained, representing only 10% of GDP, while a few big businesses \ncontrol 90% of the country\u2019s assets.  \n \n13.  SMEs rely heavily on access to external capital to finance their operations. In most of \nADB\u2019s developing member countries, SMEs have difficulty accessing financial services and \nsecuring financing. Although bank loans are the dominant form of external financing (due to the \nunderdeveloped corporate bond markets), only a small number of SMEs in the region have \naccess to bank lending (mostly only for working capital). Lack of access to bank lending is \nconsidered in most of the countries as the main financing difficulty and a stumbling block for \nsustaining SME growth. This is no different in Georgia. Due to these financing constraints, \ngrowth in the SME sector has been severely curtailed, with only 5%\u201310% of potential SME \nborrowers receiving needed bank credit.8 Part of the problem derives from constraints on the \n                                                 \n7 Data provided by People\u2019s Bank of Georgia.  ADB\u2019s draft publication, \u201cGeorgia: 2007 Country Performance \nAssessment (Draft),\u201d corroborates this level of deposit penetration, noting an increase in deposit-to-GDP ratio from \n7.2% in 2003 to 17.2% in 2006. \n6  Source: http://www.georgiatoday.ge/article_details.php?id=2503. In the absence of credit from banks, SMEs have \nto look to alternative sources to finance their growth. Primary among these are funding from retained earnings \n ", "4   \nSMEs themselves, such as their lack of collateral and lack of proper bookkeeping and financial \nreporting. In addition, demand for bank credit far outstrips what banks are able to supply; indeed, \nin 2006, the gap between supply and demand for credit totaled $500 million. Georgian banks \nare,  however,  beginning  to  look  increasingly  at  the  SME  sector  as  a  promising  business \nopportunity, a strategic move that is well-aligned with the economic needs of the country, as \nwell as with the main drivers of economic growth (agriculture, machinery), which are often SME-\nled. As Georgian banks begin to look to developing the SME sector, they require increased \nresources to support this new growth, and ADB is committed to supporting them in this regard. \n \nIII.  THE BORROWER \nA.  Overview \n14.  BOG was established in 1994 through the privatization of the state-owned housing \nfinance bank, Binsotsbank. Operating under a general banking license, BOG developed into a \nuniversal bank, aided by technical assistance and participation in institution-building programs \nprovided by ABN AMRO Bank and a number of international financial institutions, such as \nEBRD and Deutsche Investitions-und Entwicklungsgesellshaft mbH (DEG). \n \n15.  BOG is currently the largest bank in Georgia with systemic importance (25%\u201340% share \nof total assets, loans, and deposits) (Table 2). Headquartered in Tbilisi, capital of Georgia, as of \nyear-end 2006 BOG maintained a network of 99 branches throughout Georgia and had 124 \nautomated teller machines (ATMs). Together with its financial subsidiaries, BOG provides one \nof  the  widest  ranges  of  financial  services  available  in  this  relatively  underbanked  and \nunsophisticated market.  \n \nTable 2: Market Shares of Georgian Banks, as of 30 November 2006 \n(%) \n \nBank  Assets  Loans  Deposits  Equity \nBank of Georgia  27.8  25.3  23.1  39.3 \nTBC Bank  23.0  22.8  26.4  13.4 \nUnited Georgian Bank  11.6  14.5  13.1  6.0 \nProCredit Bank  10.0  11.8  9.6  7.0 \nBank Republic  8.7  7.6  11.6  7.9 \nCartu Bank  7.1  8.2  4.0  10.7 \nOther Banks  12.0  9.8  12.1  15.8 \nTotal Market  100.0  100.0  100.0  100.0 \nSource: ING.  \n \n16.  BOG is rated by all three international rating agencies and has a long-term rating of B+ \nfrom Standard & Poor\u2019s, B3/Ba1 from Moody\u2019s, and a B+ from Fitch (Table 3).9  \n \n                                                                                                                                                          \n(profits) and from the informal sector (i.e. pawnshops, relatives, moneylenders, etc.). Due to the high costs often \nassociated with financing from retained earnings and the informal sector, and the often low level of SMEs\u2019 profits, \nthese forms of financing are not optimal, and act as constraints to growth.   \n9  BOG is the only Georgian bank to have obtained ratings from all three international rating agencies. Its ratings \nwere most recently confirmed in connection with its debut Eurobond issue in spring 2007. BOG reported that it is \nrequesting Moody\u2019s for an upgrade, but noted that a review of Moody\u2019s rating will not happen before September \n2007. ", "  5\n17.  Moody\u2019s rating is the highest currently attainable by any Georgian bank, and reflects \nBOG\u2019s  systemic  importance  and  market  share,  and  hence  the  likelihood  that  BOG  would \nreceive financial support if needed from the Government. \n \nTable 3: Bank of Georgia\u2019s Ratings by International Rating Agencies \n \n  Local  Foreign  Eurobonds \nCurrency  Currency  due 02/2012 \nFitch       \nLong term  B+  B+  B+ \nShort term  B  B   \nOutlook  stable  stable  stable \n       \nMoody\u2019s       \nLong term  Ba1  B3  Ba2 \nShort term  P-3     \nOutlook  stable  stable  stable \n       \nS&P       \nLong term  B+  B+  B+ \nShort term  B  B   \nOutlook  stable  stable  stable \nS&P = Standard & Poor\u2019s. \nSources: Rating agency reports. \n \n18.  In  general, the  agencies  indicate  that  the  ratings  reflect BOG\u2019s  (i)  strong  domestic \nposition, providing the widest range of financial services of any bank in the Georgian market; (ii) \nadequate capitalization; (iii) sound core profitability; and (iv) well-defined, albeit aggressive, \nstrategy to develop into a universal financial services provider. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \nA.  Overview \n19.  ADB proposes to provide a senior loan of up to $25 million with a term of up to 3 years to \nBOG for the purpose of onlending to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Georgia \n(the ADB Loan).  \n \n20.  The ADB loan is part of a joint $125 million facility provided by ADB and Citibank as \ncoarrangers (the ADB/Citibank Facility) with Citibank underwriting $100 million.  \n \n21.  The ADB/Citibank Facility will be divided into three tranches, with tranches 1 and 2 to be \nunderwritten by Citibank, and tranche 3 to be underwritten by ADB: (i) tranche 1 will be in an \namount of $50 million with a maturity of 12 months; (ii) tranche 2 will be in an amount of $50 \nmillion with a maturity of 18 months; and (iii) tranche 3 (the ADB Loan) will be in an amount of \nup to $25 million and a maturity of up to 3 years. \n \nB.  Main Terms and Conditions \n22.  The proposed loan will be sourced from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources and will carry an \ninterest rate based on the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) plus a margin determined by \nADB's Credit Enhancement and Pricing Committee. The committee will also determine the up-\nfront  and  commitment  fees.  The  loan  documentation  will  include  financial  covenants \n ", "6   \n(contemplated are the NPL ratio and capital adequacy ratio) as well as covenants relating to \nADB\u2019s policies. The proposed loan will be unsecured. \n  \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Justification  \n1.  Development Outcome \n23.  The proposed ADB assistance will promote the following development: \n \n(i)  Support  the  emerging  banking  sector.  The  banking  sector  in  Georgia  is \ngrowing rapidly, but remains small. The loan-to-GDP ratio of 15%, deposit-to-\nGDP ratio of 11%, and card penetration of 6% indicate that banking penetration \nin the country is much smaller than in many of its peers. By providing additional \nfunding to BOG to expand its banking operations, ADB will be achieving its first \nobjective: support the emerging banking sector.  \n \n(ii)  Increase access to SME financing. ADB\u2019s second objective is to foster BOG\u2019s \nSME financing operations by providing part of the debt funding needed for its \nexpansion in this particular sector. This will in turn help to expand the SME sector \nitself, which is a main force behind economic growth in Georgia and contributes \nsignificantly to employment creation.  \n \n(iii)  Extend maturities for leading banks in Georgia. ADB\u2019s third objective is to \nextend  the  maturities  of  loans  provided  to  top  banks  in  Georgia.  Whereas \nCitibank is providing two tranches of lending at 12 and 18 months, the ADB loan \nwill have a 3-year tenor. This will allow BOG to better match longer-term loans to \nborrowers with longer-term financing as provided by ADB. \n \n(iv)  Catalyze foreign funds into Georgia. Through ADB acting with Citibank as \ncoarranger for this transaction, ADB is helping to catalyze foreign investment into \nthe country by providing confidence in the transaction to other investors who are \ncontemplating participating in the syndicated portion of the loan, and by helping \nto establish a visible pricing benchmark to which other investors will refer to \nfacilitate pricing future transactions.  \n \n24.  Achievement of these objectives will result in the following outcomes: (i) BOG will be \nenabled to conduct more business and will contribute to an expanding banking sector; (ii) SMEs \nin Georgia will have broader access to financing as a result of BOG\u2019s increased ability to finance \nthe SME sector; (iii) BOG will be better able to match assets and liabilities, and the precedent \nmay be set for other funders to provide funding of similar tenor; and (iv) more foreign investors \nwill be attracted to provide funding to Georgian financial institutions.  \n \n2.  Value Added by the Asian Development Bank \n25.  ADB\u2019s proposed loans will add value by (i) enabling BOG to grow its SME loan portfolio; \nand (ii) providing BOG with access to longer maturities, matching its assets and liabilities better. \nSpecifically, ADB will provide a 3-year loan to BOG, thereby creating a visible benchmark for 3-\nyear funding in a publicly syndicated loan transaction (a year-and-a-half beyond what Citibank \nwill be offering through its involvement in the transaction). ", "  7\n \n \n3.  Design and Monitoring Framework \n26.  ADB has prepared a design and monitoring framework and will measure the expected \ndevelopment impact of the loan, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Management Development Results \nPolicy (Appendix 1). \n \n4.  Fit to Country and Sector Strategy \n27.  ADB  has  not  yet  prepared  a  Country  Partnership  Strategy  for  Georgia.  ADB  will \ntherefore initially establish a presence in the country through its non-sovereign operations while \naddressing  key  development  areas,  such  as  SME  and  capital  market  development.  The \nGeorgian Government is fully supportive of ADB\u2019s involvement in the financial sector as its first \nintervention in the country, and arranged for introductory meetings between ADB staff and top \nGeorgian commercial banks. Based on those meetings, ADB will consider providing financing to \nthree banks (out of the group of the top seven), through debt and equity financing and technical \nassistance, as well as the issue of guarantees (including for securitization transactions). The \nproposed  transaction  forms  an  integral  part  of  ADB\u2019s  move  into  this  new  market,  and  is \nparticularly important as ADB has teamed up with Citibank.  \n \nB.  Environmental and Social Safeguard Policies  \n28.  The proposed loan is classified as category FI (financial intermediary) under ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy (2002). BOG follows EBRD\u2019s environmental and social safeguard policies, \nhas established an environmental management system (EMS), which is in line with ADB\u2019s \nstandards,  and has sufficient capacity to implement them. Significant environmental impacts \nare not expected, as BOG will be using the proceeds of the ADB loan to onlend exclusively to \nSMEs. The proposed loan is classified as category C under ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement \nPolicy (1995) and Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998), as no involuntary resettlement or \nadverse impacts on indigenous peoples are foreseen in relation to any activities of BOG. \n  \nC.  Anticorruption Policy, and Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of \nTerrorism \n29.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  BOG. \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB \nreserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant \nprovisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan documentation. BOG has also \nbeen  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  the  combating  of  money  laundering  and  financing  of \nterrorism. 10   Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB will require BOG through covenants in the loan documentation to institute, \nmaintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls following international best practice \nstandards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  corruption  or  money-laundering  activities  or  the \nfinancing of terrorism, and to covenant with ADB to refrain from engaging in such activities.  \n \n \n                                                 \n10  ADB. 2003.

The proposed senior loan to BOG will be ADB\u2019s first nonsovereign investment in Georgia. \nOnce approved, it will increase ADB\u2019s private sector investment in the banking sector from \n21.58% to 22.16%. The proposed loan is within ADB\u2019s aggregate country, industry, group, and \nsingle project exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n31.

The  Georgian  banking  sector  was  transformed  immediately  upon  Georgia\u2019s \nindependence from the former Soviet Union in 1991, when a two-tier banking system was \nintroduced: the former GosBank (state bank of the Soviet Union) Georgia branch became the \nNational  Bank  of  Georgia  (NBG)  and  various  commercial  banks  were  established. \nSubsequently, the five state-owned Georgian banks (Agromretsvbank, Binsotsbank, Eximbank, \nMretsvmshenbank, and Savings Bank) were fully privatized from 1993 to 1995.  \n2.  NBG was established as an independent supervisory, regulatory, and monetary body; \nhowever many of the practices in place when it was part of the former Soviet Union remained \nlargely unchanged. In particular, it was still directly influenced by the Government and required \nto finance the budget deficit and provide indirect loans to state-owned enterprises in Georgia.  \n3.  During 1991\u20131994, Georgia experienced intense political and economic turmoil resulting \nfrom the breakup of traditional trade relations within the former Soviet Union, followed by a \nmilitary coup, civil war, and two secessionist wars. As a result, Georgia experienced one of the \ndeepest economic recessions among the former Soviet republics. During this period, NBG \npursued an overly liberal monetary policy, which, coupled with low capital requirements for the \nlicensing  of  commercial  banks  (the  minimal  statutory  capital  for  a  bank  in  1994  was \napproximately  $500  in  real  terms),  encouraged  rapid  growth  in  the  number  of  banking \ninstitutions in the country\u2014from five commercial banks in 1991 to 226 in 1994. By 1994, the \nmajority of commercial banks were in financial difficulty, and as a result of hyperinflation, bank \ndeposits had lost almost all value. \n4.  On 23 June 1995, Parliament adopted the Organic Law of Georgia on the National Bank \nof Georgia, and on 23 February 1996 it adopted the Banking Law, which strengthened the \nindependence of NBG and granted it more authority to suspend the licenses of banks that failed \nto  meet  prudential  norms.  NBG\u2019s  banking  supervision  policy  was  based  on  the  25  Key \nPrinciples  of  Efficient  Banking  Supervision  developed  by  Basel  Committee  of  Banking \nSupervision.  Furthermore,  new  rules  and  procedures  to  regulate  banking  activities  were \nintroduced that envisaged the creation of a new system of assets classification to identify credit \nrisks with greater precision, enhance external and internal auditing functions, and eliminate \nconflicts  of  interests  in  banking  activities.  As  a  result  of  these  changes,  the  number  of \ncommercial banks in Georgia was reduced by 173 to 53 during the 3 years from 1994 to 1997. \nFollowing these reforms, the banking industry became the fastest growing industry sector in \nGeorgia. From 1997 to 2004, financial intermediation grew by almost 8.7 times in real terms, \ncompared with an increase in gross domestic product (GDP) of 1.6 times.  \n \n5.  In 1997, additional bank industry regulations came into force. NBG lowered reserve \nrequirements in an attempt to encourage greater financial intermediation in Georgia by reducing \nthe intrinsic costs of high reserve requirements to commercial banks operating in the territory. At \nthe same time, the minimum capital adequacy ratio was increased from 8.0% to 10.0% of total \nassets. In January 1997 NBG announced its plan to gradually increase the minimum capital \nrequirement  for  commercial  banks  to  GEL5.0  million  by  the  end  of  2000,  to  promote \nconsolidation of the banking sector. Throughout 1998 NBG pursued this objective by revoking \nlicenses of banks failing to meet minimal capital requirements and other prudential regulations.  \n \n ", "Appendix 2  11\n \n6.  1998 was marked by the Russian financial crisis, which led to a 40% devaluation of the \nlari,  the  Georgian  currency;  a  consequent  reduction  in  commercial  bank  deposits;  and  a \nsignificant slowdown in GDP growth. NBG introduced stricter prudential norms to stabilize the \nGeorgian banking sector and prepared a plan to help banks maintain their liquidity by offering \nshort-term liquidity loans. Only two Georgian banks requested stabilization loans of less than \nGEL4.0 million in total. \n \n7.  From 1999, new accounting rules consistent with international accounting standards \nwere introduced and minimum capital adequacy requirements strengthened from 10.0% of total \nassets to 12.0% of risk-based assets of tier-one capital and 15.0% for total capital. Banks were \nrequired to appoint international audit firms to carry out external audits from February 1999. \n \n8.  In 2000, NBG introduced the CAEL (capital, assets, equity and liquidity) methodology for \nassessing  the  financial  condition  of  operating  commercial  banks.  This  system,  which  has \nevolved into and is now known as the CAMEL (capital, assets, management, equity, and \nliquidity) system, is routinely used by NBG analysts to assess the performance of banks and \ndevelop a set of recommendations on measures needed to induce improvements in the financial \nand operating results of the banking institution in question. As a result of the introduction of \nthese policies and prudential norms, the number of licensed commercial banks decreased to 30 \nby 31 December 2000, 19 by 31 December 2005, and 17 by 30 November 2006. \n \n \n ", "", "GEORGIAN BANKING SECTOR COMPARISON \n  A\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nix\nAppendix A3.1: Banking Market Shares of Top Seven Banks by Assets   Appendix A3.2: Gross Loans to GDP (%, 2005)   3\n100% 90 % Georgia 15% 2   1\n90%   83%  \n78%\n80%   Romania 22%\n70S%ource:   [ People\u2019s Bank.  66% 65% 64%\nSerbia, Russian Federation 26%\n60%   50% 49%\n50%   42% 41% Ukr., Lth, Turkey, Poland 31%\n35%\n40%  \nSlovakia 36%\n30%  \n20%   Czech Republic 39%\n10%\n \nBulgaria 43%\n0%\n \nGeorgia   Belarus Hungary  SlovakCizaech Republic Slovenia Bulgaria Romania PRolusasnidan Federation Ukraine SlovHeunniag, aErys,t oBnoisai,a L-Hateviraz0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50%52%5660%%\nSource: People\u2019s Bank. \nAppendix A3.3: Card Penetration (% of population, 2005)  Appendix A3.4: Total Deposits to GDP (%, 2005) \n70% 63% Georgia 11%\n60% Ukraine, Serbia, Russian Federation 25%\nRomania, Lithuania 28%\n50%\nLatvia 31%\n40%\n30% Poland 39%\n30%\nHungary 43%\n19%\n20% 14%\nEstonia, Bosnia-Herz 47%\n10% 6% Turkey, Bulgaria 50%\nSlovenia, Slovakia 56%\n0%\nCzech Republic 63%\nCzech Hungary Poland Russian Georgia\nRepublic  Federation 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70%\nSource: People\u2019s Bank.
