The  proposed  ADB  loan  is  ADB\u2019s  first \ntransaction  in  Georgia  since  the  country  joined  ADB  as  a  new  member  in  February  2007. \nAppendix 1 provides the design and monitoring framework. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: BACKGROUND, CHALLENGES, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nGeorgian Economy: Overview and Outlook \n\n3. \nEconomic  growth  in  Georgia  continued  at  an  impressive  pace  in  2006  (real  gross \ndomestic product [GDP] growth was 9.4% in 2006, 7.7% in 2005, and 6.2% in 2004),1 despite \nrapidly  rising  energy  prices;  deteriorating  relations  with  its  main  trading  partner,  the  Russian \nFederation; and a decline in agricultural output. This strong performance was largely due to a \ncombination  of  macroeconomic  stability,  and  the  dramatically  improved  business  environment \nresulting  from  the  implementation  of  several  reforms.  GDP  growth  was  further  fueled  by \nmanufacturing, services, and construction. The sanctions imposed by the Russian Federation in \nmid-2006 have thus far had a limited impact on the Georgian economy. Export growth remained \nstrong in the latter half of 2006, as Russian markets were replaced by those of other countries \nas the main destination for most exports (except wine); remittance flows remained steady. \n \n4. \nInflation subsided by year-end 2006 to 8.8%, well below the peak of 14.5% recorded in \nJuly  2006.  The  current  account  rose  to  15.2%  of  GDP.2  Strong  tourism  receipts,  reflecting  a \nsharp  increase  in  tourists  from  Armenia,  offset  higher  than  expected  import  volume  growth, \nmainly  in  durable  goods.  The  capital  account  strengthened,  bolstered  by  foreign  direct \ninvestment inflows, which increased to $890 million in 2006 (excluding privatization). \n \nGeorgia\u2019s fiscal performance in 2006 was more expansionary than planned. In contrast \n5. \nto the commitment to limit the annual deficit to reduce inflationary pressures, spending overruns \nof almost 1% of GDP involved mainly capital and military expenditures. As of year-end 2006, the \nfiscal  deficit  was  2.9%  of  GDP,  exceeding  projections. 3   Despite  the  fiscal  overspending, \nmonetary  policy  was  on  track.  National  Bank  of  Georgia  (NBG)  successfully  intervened  in  the \nforeign  exchange  market  to  prevent  a  temporary  surge  in  foreign  exchange  inflows  related  to \nBOG\u2019s  initial  public  offering  (IPO)  from  influencing  the  exchange  rate.  Georgia\u2019s  total  external \ndebt  continued  to  decline  in  2006,  falling  to  $1.6  billion  (20.6%  of  GDP) 4  from  $1.7  billion \n(25.8% of GDP) in 2005.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1  Government estimate, per Central and West Asia Regional Department of ADB.   \n2  Ministry of Finance. \n3  Statistic  of  2.9%  from  the  International  Monetary  Fund.  Georgian  Ministry  of  Finance  statistics  state  1.9%  on  a \n\ncommitment basis, and 2.2% on a cash basis.   \n\n4   Available:  http://www.nbg.gov.ge/NBG_New/Publications/Buletin/Last/B-5.2e.xls  provides  the  NBG  estimate  for \ntotal  external  foreign  debt-to-GDP  ratio.  The  International  Monetary  Fund  presents  a  slightly  higher  percentage \n(21.8%)  for  public  and  publicly  guaranteed  external  debt  (nominal),  as  a  percentage  of  GDP.  Available: \nhttp://www.imf.ge/aattach/272.pdf. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nNotwithstanding  the  generally  positive  economic  outlook  in  the  medium-term,  certain \n6. \nconcerns  exist.  The  ongoing  effects  of  Russian  sanctions,  particularly  the  impact  of  higher \nenergy  prices,  are  expected  to  reduce  economic  growth,  with  real  GDP  growth  expected  to \nmoderate in 2007 to 6.5%. Higher energy prices will also create inflationary pressure; however, \nthis should be offset by the slowing of the economy and inflation is projected to actually fall to \n7%  in  2007.  The  ongoing  challenge  for  the  Government  of  Georgia  will  be  to  maintain \nmacroeconomic stability while moving forward with ongoing reforms.  \n \nThe  World  Bank  named  Georgia  as  the  number  one  reformer  worldwide 5   and  the \n7. \nEuropean  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development  (EBRD)  cites  the  country  as  having  the \nthird lowest corruption in the Eastern European region.6 Georgia is rated by Standard & Poor\u2019s \nas B+/Stable/B and Fitch Ratings as BB-/Stable/B. \n \nB. \n\nThe Banking Sector  \n\n1. \n\nOverview  \n\n8. \nWith the consolidation of the banking sector over the past several years (247 banks in \n1995  to  21  in  2006),  seven  commercial  banks  currently  dominate  the  market,  accounting  for \nnearly 90% of total assets and gross loans. The banking sector has experienced rapid growth \nover the past few years in line with overall economic growth in Georgia. Private credit grew on \naverage by 62% year-on-year in 2006, after averaging 60% growth in 2005. Demand deposits \nincreased by more than 70% in both 2004 and 2005, and by 58% in 2006 (Table 1). Appendix 2 \nprovides details on the banking sector. \n \n\nTable 1: Georgian Banking Sector Aggregate Figures, 2005\u20132006  \n($ million) \n\n \n\nAggregate Figure \nTotal Assets \nGross Loans \nDeposits \nShareholder\u2019s Equity \nNet Income \n\n2005 \n1,421 \n965 \n858 \n267 \n35 \n\n2006 \n2,467 \n1,565 \n1,359 \n524 \n54 \n\nGrowth (%) \n73.5 \n62.1 \n58.3 \n96.0 \n57.5 \n\n              Source: National Bank of Georgia. \n\n \nPenetration of the Georgian banking system is still fairly low compared to most Central \n9. \nand  Eastern  European  (CEE)  and  Commonwealth  of  Independent  States  (CIS)  countries,  and \nmultibranch  banks  have  difficulty  attaining  a  critical  mass  of  operations.  Despite  the  system\u2019s \nvery rapid growth over the last few years, even the leading banks have only a modest scale of \noperations and asset bases compared to those in more developed markets. The ratio of money \nsupply to GDP is very low in Georgia compared with other transition countries, suggesting that \nlending  activity  can  be  increased,  particularly  to  the  industry  and  agriculture  sectors,  without \nsignificant  overheating.  The  potential  for  market  growth  is  further  emphasized  by  the \ncomparatively low ratio of gross loans to GDP (15%), the low card penetration as percentage of \n\n                                                 \n5   World  Bank.  2007.

Given  the  high \nconcentration  among  the  top  seven  banks,  consolidation  is  unlikely;  however  it  is  very  likely \noutside  this  group.  All  of  the  top  five  banks  have  significant  foreign  ownership  comprised  of \nportfolio  investors,  as  in  case  of  Bank  of  Georgia,  development  financial  institutions,  and \nstrategic  investors.    Bank  Republic  is  controlled  by  Societe  Generale,  VTB  Bank  Georgia  is \nowned by Russian Vneshtorgbank; Procredit Bank is controlled by a foreign holding company, \nwhich in turn is controlled by foreign investors, and HSBC recently acquired a banking license to \nstart operations in Georgia.  Further significant foreign players considering entering the market \nwould  more  likely  target  acquiring  a  local  bank  (BOG  being  one  of  the  possible  acquisition \ntargets) rather than creating greenfield operations.  \n \n11. \nIn  2006,  NBG  published  a  development  strategy  for  the  Georgian  banking  system  for \n2006\u20132009, identifying several goals. Foremost among these is increasing the depth, efficiency, \nand sustainability of the banking system. To achieve these objectives, NBG set out a timetable \nfor  implementing  the  next  stage  of  reform  measures,  including  harmonizing  domestic  banking \nlegislation with relevant European Union laws and progressively reducing reserve requirements, \nalthough reserve requirements have been gradually increased for GEL funds from 2% to 13% in \n2007. Specific initiatives include (i) consolidating the banking sector by increasing the minimum \ncapital  requirement  for  all  commercial  banks  to  GEL12  million  (approximately  $6.8  million)  in \nJuly 2007; (ii) amending legislation to allow for the enforcement of \u201cfit and proper\u201d regulations; \n(iii)  strengthening  anti-money-laundering  legislation;  and  (iv)  sanctioning  the  establishment  of \ncredit information bureaus.  \n \nC. \n\nSmall and Medium-Sized Enterprises  \n\n12. \nSME  Sector.  SMEs  have  a  significant  role  to  play  in  all  of  ADB\u2019s  developing  member \ncountry  economies  and  are  often  key  drivers  of  employment,  economic  growth,  and \ndevelopment,  making  a  significant  impact  on  GDP.  The  development  of  SMEs  is  therefore  an \nimportant engine of growth and a key contributor to poverty reduction by creating employment, \nincreasing  individual  incomes,  and  generating  tax  revenues.  In  Georgia,  however,  the  SME \nsector  is  severely  constrained,  representing  only  10%  of  GDP,  while  a  few  big  businesses \ncontrol 90% of the country\u2019s assets.  \n \n13. \nSMEs  rely  heavily  on  access  to  external  capital  to  finance  their  operations.  In  most  of \nADB\u2019s  developing  member  countries,  SMEs  have  difficulty  accessing  financial  services  and \nsecuring financing. Although bank loans are the dominant form of external financing (due to the \nunderdeveloped  corporate  bond  markets),  only  a  small  number  of  SMEs  in  the  region  have \naccess  to  bank  lending  (mostly  only  for  working  capital).  Lack  of  access  to  bank  lending  is \nconsidered  in  most  of  the  countries  as  the  main  financing  difficulty  and  a  stumbling  block  for \nsustaining  SME  growth.  This  is  no  different  in  Georgia.  Due  to  these  financing  constraints, \ngrowth  in  the  SME  sector  has  been  severely  curtailed,  with  only  5%\u201310%  of  potential  SME \nborrowers  receiving  needed  bank  credit.8  Part  of  the  problem  derives  from  constraints  on  the \n                                                 \n7   Data  provided  by  People\u2019s  Bank  of  Georgia.    ADB\u2019s  draft  publication,  \u201cGeorgia:  2007  Country  Performance \nAssessment (Draft),\u201d corroborates this level of deposit penetration, noting an increase in deposit-to-GDP ratio from \n7.2% in 2003 to 17.2% in 2006. \n\n6   Source: http://www.georgiatoday.ge/article_details.php?id=2503. In the absence of credit from banks, SMEs have \nto  look  to  alternative  sources  to  finance  their  growth.  Primary  among  these  are  funding  from  retained  earnings \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nSMEs themselves, such as their lack of collateral and lack of proper bookkeeping and financial \nreporting. In addition, demand for bank credit far outstrips what banks are able to supply; indeed, \nin  2006,  the  gap  between  supply  and  demand  for  credit  totaled  $500  million.  Georgian  banks \nare,  however,  beginning  to  look  increasingly  at  the  SME  sector  as  a  promising  business \nopportunity,  a  strategic  move  that  is  well-aligned  with  the  economic  needs  of  the  country,  as \nwell as with the main drivers of economic growth (agriculture, machinery), which are often SME-\nled.  As  Georgian  banks  begin  to  look  to  developing  the  SME  sector,  they  require  increased \nresources to support this new growth, and ADB is committed to supporting them in this regard. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE BORROWER \n\nA. \n\nOverview \n\n14. \nBOG  was  established  in  1994  through  the  privatization  of  the  state-owned  housing \nfinance bank, Binsotsbank. Operating under a general banking license, BOG developed into a \nuniversal  bank,  aided  by  technical  assistance  and  participation  in  institution-building  programs \nprovided  by  ABN  AMRO  Bank  and  a  number  of  international  financial  institutions,  such  as \nEBRD and Deutsche Investitions-und Entwicklungsgesellshaft mbH (DEG). \n \n15. \nBOG is currently the largest bank in Georgia with systemic importance (25%\u201340% share \nof total assets, loans, and deposits) (Table 2). Headquartered in Tbilisi, capital of Georgia, as of \nyear-end  2006  BOG  maintained  a  network  of  99  branches  throughout  Georgia  and  had  124 \nautomated teller machines (ATMs). Together with its financial subsidiaries, BOG provides one \nof  the  widest  ranges  of  financial  services  available  in  this  relatively  underbanked  and \nunsophisticated market.  \n\n \nTable 2: Market Shares of Georgian Banks, as of 30 November 2006 \n(%) \n\nAssets \n27.8 \n23.0 \n11.6 \n10.0 \n8.7 \n7.1 \n12.0 \n100.0 \n\n \nBank \nBank of Georgia \nTBC Bank \nUnited Georgian Bank \nProCredit Bank \nBank Republic \nCartu Bank \nOther Banks \nTotal Market \nSource: ING.  \n \n16. \nfrom Standard & Poor\u2019s, B3/Ba1 from Moody\u2019s, and a B+ from Fitch (Table 3).9  \n \n\nDeposits \n23.1 \n26.4 \n13.1 \n9.6 \n11.6 \n4.0 \n12.1 \n100.0 \n\nLoans \n25.3 \n22.8 \n14.5 \n11.8 \n7.6 \n8.2 \n9.8 \n100.0 \n\nEquity \n39.3 \n13.4 \n6.0 \n7.0 \n7.9 \n10.7 \n15.8 \n100.0 \n\nBOG is rated by all three international rating agencies and has a long-term rating of B+ \n\n                                                                                                                                                          \n(profits) and from the informal sector (i.e. pawnshops, relatives, moneylenders, etc.). Due to the high costs often \nassociated with financing from retained earnings and the informal sector, and the often low level of SMEs\u2019 profits, \nthese forms of financing are not optimal, and act as constraints to growth.   \n\n9  BOG  is  the  only  Georgian  bank  to  have  obtained  ratings  from  all  three  international  rating  agencies.  Its  ratings \nwere most recently confirmed in connection with its debut Eurobond issue in spring 2007. BOG reported that it is \nrequesting  Moody\u2019s  for  an  upgrade,  but  noted  that  a  review  of  Moody\u2019s  rating  will  not  happen  before  September \n2007. \n\n\f17.  Moody\u2019s  rating  is  the  highest  currently  attainable  by  any  Georgian  bank,  and  reflects \nBOG\u2019s  systemic  importance  and  market  share,  and  hence  the  likelihood  that  BOG  would \nreceive financial support if needed from the Government. \n\n \nTable 3: Bank of Georgia\u2019s Ratings by International Rating Agencies \n\n  5\n\n \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\nForeign \nCurrency \n\nEurobonds \ndue 02/2012 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFitch \nLong term \nShort term \nOutlook \n \nMoody\u2019s \nLong term \nShort term \nOutlook \n \nS&P \nLong term \nShort term \nOutlook \nS&P = Standard & Poor\u2019s. \nSources: Rating agency reports. \n\nB+ \nB \nstable \n \n \nBa1 \nP-3 \nstable \n \n \nB+ \nB \nstable \n\nB+ \nB \nstable \n \n \nB3 \n \nstable \n \n \nB+ \nB \nstable \n\nB+ \n \nstable \n \n \nBa2 \n \nstable \n \n \nB+ \n \nstable \n\n \n18. \nIn  general,  the  agencies  indicate  that  the  ratings  reflect  BOG\u2019s  (i)  strong  domestic \nposition, providing the widest range of financial services of any bank in the Georgian market; (ii) \nadequate  capitalization;  (iii)  sound  core  profitability;  and  (iv)  well-defined,  albeit  aggressive, \nstrategy to develop into a universal financial services provider. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nOverview \n\nThe  ADB  loan  is  part  of  a  joint  $125  million  facility  provided  by  ADB  and  Citibank  as \n\nADB proposes to provide a senior loan of up to $25 million with a term of up to 3 years to \n19. \nBOG  for  the  purpose  of  onlending  to  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs)  in  Georgia \n(the ADB Loan).  \n \n20. \ncoarrangers (the ADB/Citibank Facility) with Citibank underwriting $100 million.  \n \nThe ADB/Citibank Facility will be divided into three tranches, with tranches 1 and 2 to be \n21. \nunderwritten  by  Citibank,  and  tranche  3  to  be  underwritten  by  ADB:  (i)  tranche  1  will  be  in  an \namount  of  $50  million  with  a  maturity  of  12  months;  (ii)  tranche  2  will  be  in  an  amount  of  $50 \nmillion with a maturity of 18 months; and (iii) tranche 3 (the ADB Loan) will be in an amount of \nup to $25 million and a maturity of up to 3 years. \n \nB. \n\nMain Terms and Conditions \n\nThe proposed loan will be sourced from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources and will carry an \n22. \ninterest  rate  based  on  the  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)  plus  a  margin  determined  by \nADB's  Credit  Enhancement  and  Pricing  Committee.  The  committee  will  also  determine  the  up-\nfinancial  covenants \nfront  and  commitment \n\nloan  documentation  will \n\nfees.  The \n\ninclude \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n(contemplated  are  the  NPL  ratio  and  capital  adequacy  ratio)  as  well  as  covenants  relating  to \nADB\u2019s policies. The proposed loan will be unsecured. \n  \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nJustification  \n\n1. \n\nDevelopment Outcome \n\n23. \n\nThe proposed ADB assistance will promote the following development: \n \n(i) \n\nSupport  the  emerging  banking  sector.  The  banking  sector  in  Georgia  is \ngrowing  rapidly,  but  remains  small.  The  loan-to-GDP  ratio  of  15%,  deposit-to-\nGDP ratio of 11%, and card penetration of 6% indicate that banking penetration \nin the country is much smaller than in many of its peers. By providing additional \nfunding to BOG to expand its banking operations, ADB will be achieving its first \nobjective: support the emerging banking sector.  \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\nIncrease access to SME financing. ADB\u2019s second objective is to foster BOG\u2019s \nSME  financing  operations  by  providing  part  of  the  debt  funding  needed  for  its \nexpansion in this particular sector. This will in turn help to expand the SME sector \nitself, which is a main force behind economic growth in Georgia and contributes \nsignificantly to employment creation.  \n\nExtend  maturities  for  leading  banks  in  Georgia.  ADB\u2019s  third  objective  is  to \nextend  the  maturities  of  loans  provided  to  top  banks  in  Georgia.  Whereas \nCitibank is providing two tranches of lending at 12 and 18 months, the ADB loan \nwill have a 3-year tenor. This will allow BOG to better match longer-term loans to \nborrowers with longer-term financing as provided by ADB. \n\nCatalyze  foreign  funds  into  Georgia.  Through  ADB  acting  with  Citibank  as \ncoarranger for this transaction, ADB is helping to catalyze foreign investment into \nthe country by providing confidence in the transaction to other investors who are \ncontemplating participating in the syndicated portion of the loan, and by helping \nto  establish  a  visible  pricing  benchmark  to  which  other  investors  will  refer  to \nfacilitate pricing future transactions.  \n\n \n24. \nAchievement  of  these  objectives  will  result  in  the  following  outcomes:  (i)  BOG  will  be \nenabled to conduct more business and will contribute to an expanding banking sector; (ii) SMEs \nin Georgia will have broader access to financing as a result of BOG\u2019s increased ability to finance \nthe SME sector; (iii) BOG will be better able to match assets and liabilities, and the precedent \nmay be set for other funders to provide funding of similar tenor; and (iv) more foreign investors \nwill be attracted to provide funding to Georgian financial institutions.  \n \n\n2. \n\nValue Added by the Asian Development Bank \n\n25. \nADB\u2019s proposed loans will add value by (i) enabling BOG to grow its SME loan portfolio; \nand (ii) providing BOG with access to longer maturities, matching its assets and liabilities better. \nSpecifically, ADB will provide a 3-year loan to BOG, thereby creating a visible benchmark for 3-\nyear funding in a publicly syndicated loan transaction (a year-and-a-half beyond what Citibank \nwill be offering through its involvement in the transaction). \n\n\f  7\n\n3. \n\nDesign and Monitoring Framework \n\nADB  has  prepared  a  design  and  monitoring  framework  and  will  measure  the  expected \n26. \ndevelopment impact of the loan, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Management Development Results \nPolicy (Appendix 1). \n \n\n4. \n\nFit to Country and Sector Strategy \n\n27. \nADB  has  not  yet  prepared  a  Country  Partnership  Strategy  for  Georgia.  ADB  will \ntherefore initially establish a presence in the country through its non-sovereign operations while \naddressing  key  development  areas,  such  as  SME  and  capital  market  development.  The \nGeorgian Government is fully supportive of ADB\u2019s involvement in the financial sector as its first \nintervention in the country, and arranged for introductory meetings between ADB staff and top \nGeorgian commercial banks. Based on those meetings, ADB will consider providing financing to \nthree banks (out of the group of the top seven), through debt and equity financing and technical \nassistance,  as  well  as  the  issue  of  guarantees  (including  for  securitization  transactions).  The \nproposed  transaction  forms  an  integral  part  of  ADB\u2019s  move  into  this  new  market,  and  is \nparticularly important as ADB has teamed up with Citibank.  \n\n \n\nB. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Safeguard Policies  \n\n28. \nThe  proposed  loan  is  classified  as  category  FI  (financial  intermediary)  under  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy (2002). BOG follows EBRD\u2019s environmental and social safeguard policies, \nhas  established  an  environmental  management  system  (EMS),  which  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s \nstandards,    and  has  sufficient  capacity  to  implement  them.  Significant  environmental  impacts \nare not expected, as BOG will be using the proceeds of the ADB loan to onlend exclusively to \nSMEs.  The  proposed  loan  is  classified  as  category  C  under  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement \nPolicy  (1995)  and  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998),  as  no  involuntary  resettlement  or \nadverse impacts on indigenous peoples are foreseen in relation to any activities of BOG. \n  \nC. \nTerrorism \n\nAnticorruption  Policy,  and  Combating  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of \n\n29. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  BOG. \nConsistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB \nreserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant \nprovisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan documentation. BOG has also \nbeen  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  the  combating  of  money  laundering  and  financing  of \nterrorism. 10   Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency,  ADB  will  require  BOG  through  covenants  in  the  loan  documentation  to  institute, \nmaintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls following international best practice \nstandards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  corruption  or  money-laundering  activities  or  the \nfinancing of terrorism, and to covenant with ADB to refrain from engaging in such activities.  \n \n \n\n                                                 \n10  ADB. 2003.

The proposed loan is within ADB\u2019s aggregate country, industry, group, and \nsingle project exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n31. \nADB  will  enter  into  acceptable  loan  agreements  and  other  required  legal  documents, \nfollowing approval of the proposed loan by the Board. These agreements will be on terms and \nconditions satisfactory to ADB. \n \n32. \nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment will be asked to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed ADB loan to BOG. \nNo funding under the loan will be made available until ADB receives such confirmation. \n \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n33. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  a  loan  of  up  to  $25 \nmillion  to  Joint  Stock  Commercial  Bank  of  Georgia  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  on \nsuch terms and conditions as are substantially set forth in this report, and as may be reported to \nthe Board.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n12 July 2007 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n9\n\n \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nPerformance \nTargets/Indicators \n\nData Sources/Reporting \nMechanisms \n\nAssumptions \nand Risks \n\n \n\nDesign \nSummary \nImpact \n \nThe GDP composition \nof the Georgian \neconomy is more \ndiversified (i.e., more \nSMEs in more sectors \ncontribute to a more \ndiversified economy) \n\nOutcome \n \nBOG provides \nincreased, sustainable \naccess to finance to \nSMEs in Georgia \n \n\n \n\u2022  NBG statistics \n \n\n \n\u2022  Percentage of GDP \ncontributed by the \nSME sector rises \nfrom 15% to 20% in \n5 years \n\n \n\n \n\u2022  BOG\u2019s quarterly and \nannual financial \nstatements \n\n\u2022  Reporting specifically \nrequested by ADB \n\n \n\u2022  BOG\u2019s number of \nSME borrowers \nincreases (10% in \nnext 24 months)  \n\u2022  BOG\u2019s credit quality \nis high, nonperforming \nloans less than 4% \n\n\u2022  BOG\u2019s return on \n\nequity stays above \n15% \n\n\u2022  BOG\u2018s capital \nadequacy ratio \nremains above NBG \nnorms \n\nOutputs \n \n\u2022  ADB provides senior \n\nloan \n\n\u2022  BOG operationalizes \nuse of senior loan \n\n \n\u2022  Loan requests \n\nreceived by BOG \nincrease by 25% per \nannum from current \nlevels \n\n \n\u2022  BOG\u2019s quarterly and \nannual financial \nstatements \n\n\u2022  Reporting specifically \nrequested by ADB \n\n \n \nActivities with Milestones \n1.1  Provide BOG with $25 million senior loan by August  2007. \n\n\u2022  ADB and BOG enter into loan agreement \n \n\n1.2  Operationalize proceeds of senior loan by BOG (ongoing). \n\n\u2022  Origination of (new) client opportunities \n\u2022  Due diligence on clients \n\u2022  Completion of loan agreements with clients \n\u2022  Disbursement of loans to clients \n\nAssumptions \n\u2022 \n\nIncreased access to \nfinance from banks will \nlead to more SMEs \nreceiving loans and \nexpanding their role in \nthe economy \n\n\u2022  Stable or increased \n\neconomic development \nin Georgia \n\n \nAssumptions \n\u2022  SME demand exists for \n\nloans \n\n\u2022  No adverse economic \ndevelopments in \nAzerbaijan \n\n\u2022  No regulatory changes \n\nfor banking  \n\n\u2022  No other exogenous \n\nfactors have a negative \nimpact on banking \ndevelopment  \n\nRisk \n\u2022  BOG breaches domestic \nprudential/NBG norms \n\n \nAssumptions \n \n\u2022  Prevailing market \n\nconditions are stable \n\n\u2022  All regulatory approvals in \n\nplace for ADB  \n\n \nInputs \n \n\u2022  ADB: $25 million \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  BOG  =  Bank  of  Georgia.

In particular, it was still directly influenced by the Government and required \nto finance the budget deficit and provide indirect loans to state-owned enterprises in Georgia.  \n\nDuring 1991\u20131994, Georgia experienced intense political and economic turmoil resulting \n3. \nfrom  the  breakup  of  traditional  trade  relations  within  the  former  Soviet  Union,  followed  by  a \nmilitary coup, civil war, and two secessionist wars. As a result, Georgia experienced one of the \ndeepest  economic  recessions  among  the  former  Soviet  republics.  During  this  period,  NBG \npursued an overly liberal monetary policy, which, coupled with low capital requirements for the \nlicensing  of  commercial  banks  (the  minimal  statutory  capital  for  a  bank  in  1994  was \napproximately  $500  in  real  terms),  encouraged  rapid  growth  in  the  number  of  banking \ninstitutions  in  the  country\u2014from  five  commercial  banks  in  1991  to  226  in  1994.  By  1994,  the \nmajority of commercial banks were in financial difficulty, and as a result of hyperinflation, bank \ndeposits had lost almost all value. \n\n4. \nOn 23 June 1995, Parliament adopted the Organic Law of Georgia on the National Bank \nof  Georgia,  and  on  23  February  1996  it  adopted  the  Banking  Law,  which  strengthened  the \nindependence of NBG and granted it more authority to suspend the licenses of banks that failed \nto  meet  prudential  norms.  NBG\u2019s  banking  supervision  policy  was  based  on  the  25  Key \nPrinciples  of  Efficient  Banking  Supervision  developed  by  Basel  Committee  of  Banking \nSupervision.  Furthermore,  new  rules  and  procedures  to  regulate  banking  activities  were \nintroduced that envisaged the creation of a new system of assets classification to identify credit \nrisks  with  greater  precision,  enhance  external  and  internal  auditing  functions,  and  eliminate \nconflicts  of  interests  in  banking  activities.  As  a  result  of  these  changes,  the  number  of \ncommercial banks in Georgia was reduced by 173 to 53 during the 3 years from 1994 to 1997. \nFollowing  these  reforms,  the  banking  industry  became  the  fastest  growing  industry  sector  in \nGeorgia.  From  1997  to  2004,  financial  intermediation  grew  by  almost  8.7  times  in  real  terms, \ncompared with an increase in gross domestic product (GDP) of 1.6 times.  \n \n5. \nIn  1997,  additional  bank  industry  regulations  came  into  force.  NBG  lowered  reserve \nrequirements in an attempt to encourage greater financial intermediation in Georgia by reducing \nthe intrinsic costs of high reserve requirements to commercial banks operating in the territory. At \nthe same time, the minimum capital adequacy ratio was increased from 8.0% to 10.0% of total \nassets.  In  January  1997  NBG  announced  its  plan  to  gradually  increase  the  minimum  capital \nrequirement  for  commercial  banks  to  GEL5.0  million  by  the  end  of  2000,  to  promote \nconsolidation of the banking sector. Throughout 1998 NBG  pursued this objective by revoking \nlicenses of banks failing to meet minimal capital requirements and other prudential regulations.  \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n11\n\n \n\n1998 was marked by the Russian financial crisis, which led to a 40% devaluation of the \n6. \nlari,  the  Georgian  currency;  a  consequent  reduction  in  commercial  bank  deposits;  and  a \nsignificant  slowdown  in  GDP  growth.  NBG  introduced  stricter  prudential  norms  to  stabilize  the \nGeorgian banking sector and prepared a plan to help banks maintain their liquidity by offering \nshort-term  liquidity  loans.  Only  two  Georgian  banks  requested  stabilization  loans  of  less  than \nGEL4.0 million in total. \n \n7. \nFrom  1999,  new  accounting  rules  consistent  with  international  accounting  standards \nwere introduced and minimum capital adequacy requirements strengthened from 10.0% of total \nassets to 12.0% of risk-based assets of tier-one capital and 15.0% for total capital. Banks were \nrequired to appoint international audit firms to carry out external audits from February 1999. \n \nIn 2000, NBG introduced the CAEL (capital, assets, equity and liquidity) methodology for \n8. \nassessing  the  financial  condition  of  operating  commercial  banks.  This  system,  which  has \nevolved  into  and  is  now  known  as  the  CAMEL  (capital,  assets,  management,  equity,  and \nliquidity)  system,  is  routinely  used  by  NBG  analysts  to  assess  the  performance  of  banks  and \ndevelop a set of recommendations on measures needed to induce improvements in the financial \nand  operating  results  of  the  banking  institution  in  question.  As  a  result  of  the  introduction  of \nthese policies and prudential norms, the number of licensed commercial banks decreased to 30 \nby 31 December 2000, 19 by 31 December 2005, and 17 by 30 November 2006. \n \n \n \n\n\f\fGEORGIAN BANKING SECTOR COMPARISON \n\nAppendix A3.1: Banking Market Shares of Top Seven Banks by Assets  \n\nAppendix A3.2: Gross Loans to GDP (%, 2005) \n\n83%\n\n78%\n\nSource:  [ People\u2019s Bank. \n\n66% 65% 64%\n\n50% 49%\n\n42% 41%\n\n35%\n\nGeorgia\n\nRomania\n\nSerbia, Russian Federation\n\n15%\n\n22%\n\n26%\n\nUkr., Lth, Turkey, Poland\n\n31%\n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n3\n\n \n \n \n\n1\n2\n \n\nG eorgia\n\nB elarus\n\nH ungary \n\nSlovakia\nC zech R epu blic\n\nSlovenia\n\nBulgaria\n\nR o m ania\n\nU kraine\n\nPoland\n\nR ussian Federation\n\n36%\n\n39%\n\n43%\n\n52%\n\n56%\n\n0%\n\n10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60%\n\nAppendix A3.3: Card Penetration (% of population, 2005) \n\nAppendix A3.4: Total Deposits to GDP (%, 2005) \n\n63%\n\n30%\n\n19%\n\n14%\n\n6%\n\nGeorgia\n\n11%\n\nUkraine, Serbia, Rus s ian Federation\n\nRom ania, Lithuania\n\n25%\n\n28%\n\n31%\n\n39%\n\n43%\n\n47%\n\n50%\n\n56%\n\n63%\n\nCzech\nepublic \n\nR\n\nHungary\n\nPoland\n\nGeorgia\n\nRussian\nFederation\n\n0%\n\n10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70%\n\nSource: People\u2019s Bank. \n\nSource: People\u2019s Bank. \n\nSlovakia\n\nCzech Republic\n\nBulgaria\n\nHungary, Bosia-Herz\n\nSlovenia, Estonia, Latvia\n\nSource: People\u2019s Bank. \n\nLatvia\n\nPoland\n\nHungary\n\nEs tonia, Bos nia-Herz\n\nTurkey, Bulgaria\n\nSlovenia, Slovakia\n\nCzech Republic\n\n100%\n\n90%\n\n80%\n70%\n\n60%\n\n50%\n\n40%\n\n30%\n20%\n\n10%\n\n0%\n\n70%\n\n60%\n\n50%\n\n40%\n\n30%\n\n20%\n\n10%\n\n0%\n\n \n\n \n%\n90\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4  13\n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\nGEORGIAN BANKS PEER GROUP ANALYSIS \n\nFigure A4.1: Georgian Banking Sector\u2014Largest Number of Customers \n\n63% \n\n5%\n\n6%\n\n2.4% \n\n11.6%\n\n5.8%\n\n4%\n\n2.2%\n\ns\nr\ne\nm\no\nt\ns\nu\nC\n\n \nf\no\n \nr\ne\nb\nm\nu\nN\n\n2 0 0 ,0 0 0\n\n4 0 0 ,0 0 0\n\n8 0 0 ,0 0 0\n\n6 0 0 ,0 0 0\n\n2 8 0 ,3 5 3\n\n1 ,6 0 0 ,0 0 0\n\n1 ,4 0 0 ,0 0 0\n\n1 ,2 0 0 ,0 0 0\n\n1 ,0 0 0 ,0 0 0\n\n1 ,5 1 0 ,0 0 0\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1 3\n \n \n \n \n \nNotes: 1.
