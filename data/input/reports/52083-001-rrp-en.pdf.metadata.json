The Malolos-Clark Railway Project comprises: (i) Malolos-Clark section (51.2 km) from Malolos to Clark and \nClark International Airport, and (ii) Blumentritt extension (1.9 km) connecting Solis and Blumentritt stations in Metro Manila \nDistrict I (City of Manila). Both sections are part of the NSCR and extensions of the Tutuban-Solis-Malolos section financed by \nthe Japan International Cooperation Agency. The NSCR will be completed during 2022-2025 as an integrated 163 km dedicated \nsuburban passenger railway system comprising four sections: (i) Tutuban-Solis-Malolos, (ii) Malolos-Clark-Clark International \nAirport, (iii) Solis-Blumentritt-Calamba, and (iv) Clark-New Clark City. The project will provide affordable, reliable, and safe \npublic transport; reduce greenhouse gas emissions; and contribute to cutting travel time from Metro Manila to Clark from 2-3 \nhours (by bus) to less than 1 hour by rail.\nImpact: Local, national, and international connectivity improved\nOutcome: Efficiency and capacity of transportation along the Manila-Clark corridor improved\nOutputs: (i) New railway line commissioned,  and (ii) Institutional capacity strengthened\n\nImplementation Arrangements: Department of Transportation will be the executing agency.\n\nProject Readiness: Project readiness is high, as the entire scope to be financed by the MFF has been appraised by ADB, the \ndetailed engineering design has been completed, and bidding for the first three contracts financed under the MFF started in \nJanuary 2019. The contractor will be mobilized by October 2019.\n\n11. Milestones\nModality\nMultitranche financing facility\nTranche I\nTranche II\nTranche III\n\n12.

The project will support the construction of two sections, totaling 53.1 kilometers \n(km), of the North\u2013South Commuter Railway (NSCR), connecting the regional center of Clark in \nCentral Luzon with Metro Manila and Calamba, Laguna.1 The Malolos\u2013Clark Railway Project will \nprovide  affordable,  reliable,  and  safe public  transport;  reduce greenhouse  gas  emissions;  and \ncontribute to cutting travel time from Metro Manila to Clark from 2\u20133 hours (by bus) to less than 1 \nhour by rail.2 The project is included in the country operations business plan, 2019\u20132021 of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) for the Philippines.3 \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE \n\n \n2. \nDevelopment  problem.  The  Philippines  is  among  the  fastest  growing  economies  in \nSoutheast Asia, with an average annual economic growth rate of 6.2% from 2010 to 2015. The \nPhilippine Development Plan (PDP), 2017\u20132022 looks to maintain this momentum by continuing \nthe  government\u2019s  emphasis  on  inclusive  growth.4 Under  the  PDP,  the  government  has  set  a \nstrategic  target  to  reach  upper-middle-income  status  by  2022  by  increasing  gross  domestic \nproduct (GDP) per capita from $3,550 in 2015 to $5,000 by 2022. However, while the national \npoverty rate fell from 25.2% of the population in 2012 to 21.6% in 2015, this still translated into \n22 million poor people in 2015. Such a level is quite high for a middle-income country. Household \nincome inequality in the Philippines is also among the highest in Southeast Asia. Wide income \ndisparities across the country\u2019s regions indicate that the benefits of economic growth have not \nbeen distributed evenly. \n \n3. \nTo sustain high growth and ensure it is more inclusive, the Philippines needs to increase \nboth  public  and  private  investments  in  climate-resilient  infrastructure.  The  World  Economic \nForum\u2019s  Global  Competitiveness  Report,  2017\u20132018  ranked  the  country\u2019s  infrastructure \ncompetitiveness 97th out of 137 countries surveyed, well behind regional peers Malaysia (22nd), \nThailand (43rd), and Indonesia (52nd).5 This is the result of years of low spending specifically on \npublic infrastructure. At 35% of GDP in 2015, Philippine public capital stock is the lowest among \nmembers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The ASEAN simple average \nis 69% of GDP (Figure 1). Not only is the infrastructure deficit an impediment to accelerating long-\nterm  economic  growth  and  reducing  poverty,  but  it  also  leads  to  significant  economic  losses \nbecause of pollution and time delays caused by road congestion. The PDP estimated economic \nlosses due to road congestion in 2014 to be at least $53.6 million per day (equivalent to around \n$18  billion  per  year)  in  Metro  Manila.  Moreover,  the  lack  of  safe  and  efficient  public  transport \n\n                                                \n1  The Malolos\u2013Clark Railway Project comprises: (i) Malolos\u2013Clark section (51.2 km) from Malolos to Clark and Clark \nInternational Airport, and (ii) Blumentritt extension (1.9 km) connecting Solis and Blumentritt stations in Metro Manila \nDistrict I (City of Manila). Both sections are part of the North\u2013South Commuter Railway (NSCR) and extensions of \nthe Tutuban\u2013Solis\u2013Malolos section financed by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The NSCR will \nbe completed during 2022\u20132025 as an integrated 163 km dedicated suburban passenger railway system comprising \nfour  sections:  (i)  Tutuban\u2013Solis\u2013Malolos,  (ii)  Malolos\u2013Clark\u2013Clark  International  Airport,  (iii)  Solis\u2013Blumentritt\u2013\nCalamba, and (iv) Clark\u2013New Clark City (paragraph 7). \n\n2  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2018.

The BBB program aims to \nraise public spending on infrastructure from 5.1% of GDP in 2016 to 7.0% of GDP by 2022. The \ntotal estimated funding requirement under the BBB program to achieve the targeted infrastructure \noutlays  over  this  period  is  $158  billion.  To  meet  these  requirements,  the  government  plans  to \nraise funds from three primary sources: direct government spending through the national budget, \nprivate capital, and official development assistance. BBB projects include railways, expressways, \nbridges,  airports,  urban  public  utilities,  and  flood  risk  management  investments.  For  FY2018, \nactual  public  spending  on  infrastructure  was  equivalent  to  6.2%  of  GDP  in  terms  of  budget \nobligations  and  4.6%  of  GDP  in  terms  of  cash  disbursements  (Figure  1).7 This  has  been  the \nhighest level attained in more than 10 years. \n \nRoad  map.  In  the  Philippines,  substantial  underinvestment  in  infrastructure  has  led  to \n5. \nchronic  capacity  constraints  in  the  transport  sector,  resulting  in  economic  losses  due  to  road \ncongestion (paragraph 3) and in significant air pollution, as 98% of passenger transport and 55% \nof freight transport are by road.8 It is however estimated that by 2040, 30%\u201340% of passengers \nin the corridor from Clark to the National Capital Region (NCR) will use the new rail line. Today, \ncommuter railways are operated only in Metro Manila and the Laguna Province. Comprising just \nthree elevated rail lines, Metro Manila\u2019s rail-based public urban transport system has a total length \nof 48.5 km; these transported 283 million passengers in 2015.9 In addition, Philippine National \nRailways  (PNR)  operates  a suburban  commuter  railway  from Tutuban  southbound  to  Alabang \n                                                \n6  Build, Build, Build. http://www.build.gov.ph. \n7  Budget obligations refer to construction contract commitments made for projects, while cash disbursements refer to \n\ncash releases to pay for construction (footnote 5). \n\n8  The remaining 2% of passenger transport is by air and sea, and the remaining 45% of freight transport is by sea. \n9  JICA.  2018.

Demand on the corridor \nexceeds 50% of the network\u2019s capacity\u2014a level at which traffic quickly builds up, especially during \npeak hours.  \n \n6. \nAir  transport  infrastructure  in  the  NCR  is  also  unable to satisfy growing  demand  for  air \ntransport  because  of  capacity  constraints.  Ninoy  Aquino  International  Airport  (NAIA)  and  Clark \nInternational Airport (CIA) are the two major airports serving  the NCR. NAIA handled about 42 \nmillion  passengers  in  2017,  which  substantially  exceeded  the  airport\u2019s  35  million  maximum \ncapacity.12 NAIA has become increasingly congested, but its location in the heart of Metro Manila \nlimits the potential for further expansion. The government plans to decongest traffic at NAIA and \nmeet  growing  demand  for  air  travel  by  diverting  more  passengers  to  CIA,  which  will  have  an \nannual  capacity  of  12  million  passengers  when  the  new  terminal  is  completed  in  2020.13 To \nachieve this, it is vital to have affordable, fast, and reliable transport links between CIA and Manila. \n \nThe project is in line with the PDP and the National Transport Policy, 14 and is part of the \n7. \ngovernment\u2019s  flagship  NSCR  project,  a  163  km  suburban  railway  network  connecting  Clark \n(including  CIA  and  New  Clark  City)  with  Metro  Manila  and  Calamba,  Laguna,  by  2025.  To  be \nconstructed  in  sections,  the  network  comprises  (i)  the  37  km  Tutuban\u2013Solis\u2013Malolos  section, \nconstruction of which will begin in early 2019, with operation expected to begin in 2022; (ii) the \n53.1 km Malolos\u2013Clark Railway Project (footnote 1), construction of which will launch in 2019, \nwith partial operation scheduled to commence in 2022; (iii) the 55 km Blumentritt\u2013Calamba South \nCommuter  Railway  Project,  construction  of  which  is  expected  to  begin  in  2020,  with  operation \nslated for    2024;  and (iv)  the  extension from  Clark  to New  Clark  City,  construction  of  which  is \nexpected to start in 2022 for operation by 2025. An extension for long-haul services to the port of \nBatangas and to Legaspi in Southern Luzon is planned beyond 2025. \n \nPolicy framework. The government is taking a threefold approach to developing transport \n8. \ninfrastructure in the NCR and surrounding regions. Its first step was to streamline infrastructure \npolicy  to  accelerate  investment  approvals  and  construction.  In  June  2017,  the  government \napproved  the  National  Transport  Policy,  which  guides  transport-related  agencies  on  policy \ndecisions  and  future  investment  and  coordinates  national  and  local  efforts.  Embedded  in  the \nNational Transport Policy is the Philippine Transportation System Master Plan, which will ensure \na  holistic,  well-coordinated,  and  evidence-based  project  selection  process.  Additionally,  the \ngovernment  has  adopted  a  hybrid  policy  for  financing  and  operating  large  and  complex \ninfrastructure  investments.  Under  this  policy,  the  government  will  finance  public  infrastructure \nthrough a combination of the national budget and official development assistance, with operation \n\n                                                \n10 The Philippine National Railways (PNR) commenced limited services to General Pascual Station in the north of Metro \nManila and to Calamba in Laguna Province in 2018. Limited local services are operated in the Bicol Region between \nNaga City and Legaspi City. \n\n11 The National Capital Region (NCR) comprises the 16 cities known as Metro Manila. \n12 Manila  International  Airport  Authority.  2018.

The \nregional growth centers will be linked by improved transport infrastructure to support accelerated \neconomic growth. The government is developing Clark and New Clark City as a regional growth \ncenter, with CIA as a regional gateway integrating Central Luzon with the Asian region thereby \nfurther deepening regional cooperation. This will contribute to better integration of the Philippines \nwith  ASEAN  economies  and  attract  more  foreign  direct  investment.  New  Clark  City  will \naccommodate 1.2 million residents and 800,000 jobs by 2045 and will become an administrative \ncenter and education hub for the country. The railway network will be the backbone of the public \ntransport system. Connecting Clark, New Clark City, and CIA with the NCR by rail will also help \nrelieve  road  congestion  and  reduce  high  transport  and  logistics  costs.  Developing  Clark  as  a \nregional center and promoting a shift of population growth from the high-density NCR to Central \nLuzon will spur economic growth along the entire North-South corridor.  \n \n10. \nThe  third  component  of  the  government\u2019s  threefold  approach  is  the  2017\u20132022  Public \nInvestment  Program,  through  which  the  government  has  approved  several  large  transport \ninfrastructure  investments  in  the  NCR  to  reduce  congestion,  environmental  pollution  and \nassociated high transport and logistics costs.16 These investments include (i) rehabilitating Metro \nRail Transit (MRT) line 3; (ii) extending Light Rail Transit (LRT) lines 1 and 2; and (iii) constructing \nMRT line 7 and MRT line 4 (15 km Ortigas\u2013Rizal line); constructing a Quezon City\u2013NAIA subway; \nbuilding elevated pedestrian walkways known as Edsa Greenways; building up to 10 new Metro \nManila bridges across the Marikina and Pasay rivers; and constructing additional connector roads. \nThe government is also improving interchanges between the MRT and LRT lines and improving \nintermodal  integration  with  buses  and  with  other  transport  modes.  South  of  Metro  Manila,  the \ngovernment plans to build a 50 km expressway along the shoreline of the Laguna de Bay lake to \nfurther ease traffic congestion. \n \nStrategic context. To sustain high growth, the Philippines needs to significantly increase \n11. \ninvestments \nregions, \ncommunities, and people; and raise infrastructure competitiveness (paragraph 3). Investments in \nurban development are needed to address infrastructure deficits in large cities resulting from rapid \npopulation  growth  and  urbanization.  The  government\u2019s  BBB  program  emphasizes  physical \nconnectivity, urban development, and water resource management to address the infrastructure \ndeficit.  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  (CPS),  2018\u20132023  for  the  Philippines  consolidates \nlending  activities  into  larger  programmatic  approaches  and  increases  synergies  across  ADB \noperations.17 ADB will add value to the financing it provides by helping the government design, \nprepare,  bring to the  market,  and  implement  priority  public  investment  projects  under  the  BBB \nprogram  through  large-scale  capacity  development  technical  assistance  (TA).  The  project  is \n\nimprove  connectivity  between \n\nin  climate-resilient \n\ninfrastructure; \n\n                                                \n15 Selection of the O&M contractor for the NSCR is under preparation.

ADB  has  supported the \n12. \ngovernment\u2019s BBB program through a mix of modalities. First, ADB has provided TA to support \nthe  government  in  simplifying  infrastructure  policy  and  streamlining  approval  procedures. 18 \nSecond,  through  policy-based  lending,  ADB  has  supported  the  government  in  establishing  a \npolicy  framework  for  increased  private  participation  in  infrastructure  projects  and  in  reforming \ncapital markets to improve the availability of long-term financing for infrastructure.19 Third, ADB \napproved in October 2017 an Infrastructure Preparation and Innovation Facility (IPIF) TA loan of \n$100 million to support the Department of Public Works and Highways and the DOTr to prepare \nquality, large, and complex infrastructure projects under the BBB program and to strengthen the \ncapacity  to  implement  the  projects.20 ADB  has  also  provided  an  IPIF TA  grant  of  $5  million  to \ndevelop the capacity of the Department of Public Works and Highways and the DOTr to manage \nlarge projects.21 Fourth, ADB has increased financing for transport infrastructure projects in the \nPhilippines.  From  1990  to  2016,  ADB  financing  for  transport  infrastructure  totaled  only  $860 \nmillion  (nominal  values)\u2014an  average  of  $32  million  per  year.  The  CPS,  2018\u20132023  has \nsubstantially  rebalanced  the  lending  pipeline  toward  infrastructure  projects,  with  transport \naccounting for at least 47% of the scaled-up indicative lending pipeline for 2019\u20132021. In addition \nto sovereign loans, the Private Sector Operations Department provided a nonsovereign loan to \nthe  Mactan  Cebu  International  Passenger  Terminal  Project,  which  was  completed  in  2018.22 \nMeanwhile, ADB\u2019s Office of Public\u2013Private Partnerships has signed a mandate with the Philippine \ngovernment-owned Bases Conversion Development Corporation to provide transaction advisory \nservices for urban investments in New Clark City.  \n \n13. \nADB\u2019s value addition. Cofinancing of the project and of additional segments of the NSCR \nby ADB and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) will help ensure that the project \nis delivered within a short time frame and with high technical, social, and environmental standards. \nCapacity  development  support  for  the  DOTr  through  the  IPIF  TA  loan  and  grant  will  support \ninstitutional strengthening of the DOTr throughout the project. A consulting firm financed by ADB \nthrough  the  IPIF  with  specialization  in  the  railway  subsector  will  support  the  DOTr,  especially \nduring project preparation and procurement, while the Railway Project Implementation Support \nand Institutional Strengthening TA project (footnote 2) supports the implementation of safeguard \nmeasures and gender action plan. The institutional development component under the project will \nfurther  support  the  DOTr  in  managing  the  large  investment  by  establishing  an  information \ntechnology system to handle the document flow for improved project management, scheduling, \nand coordination between the parties involved. \n\n                                                \n18 ADB. 2014.

ADB\u2019s experience with financing large railway projects provides several \n14. \ncritical lessons that have been incorporated into the project. First, large railway projects financed \nby ADB in South Asia and Southeast Asia have shown that the following are vital to delivering \nhigh-quality  projects  in  a  timely  manner:  (i)  conducting  advance  planning  and  detailed  project \npreparation; (ii) making sure that executing agencies have strong capacity for project preparation, \nprocurement, land acquisition and resettlement, and project implementation; (iii) integrating the \ndesign  with  other  transport  modes  for  strong  intermodal  integration;  and  (iv)  considering  O&M \nrequirements at an early stage. A consulting team financed by JICA incorporated these lessons \nin preparing the design for the NSCR (including the Malolos\u2013Clark section covered by this project). \nThe addition of the Blumentritt extension will address the need for integrating the new system with \nthe existing MRT lines in Metro Manila. The JICA-financed design consulting team will continue \nits services until the general consultant and construction supervision consultants, which will also \nbe  financed  by  JICA,  are  mobilized.  To  further  strengthen  the  DOTr\u2019s  capacity  during  project \npreparation and project implementation, consultants engaged through the IPIF are supporting the \nDOTr with railway-specific knowledge and will act as the \u201cshadow operator\u201d until the operation \ncontractor is selected.23 \n \n15. \nThe  second  lesson  is  that  past  greenfield  railway  projects  implemented  under  public\u2013\nprivate  partnerships  have  failed  because  of  a  lack  of  sufficient  revenues  in  the  initial  years  of \noperation, or because of delays in project implementation. The DOTr will therefore cover the entire \ncost of O&M for the NSCR, using government resources, until traffic has picked up to a level that \nwill  allow  the  operation  contractor  to  recover  the  full  O&M  costs,  including  replacement  of \nequipment, from revenues.24 The third lesson is that resettlement plans for large railway projects \nmust  (i)  focus  on  large  numbers  of  poor  project-affected  households  and  (ii)  ensure  adequate \nliving standards and conditions at resettlement sites and provide an effective grievance redress \nmechanism.  Railway-related  resettlement  can  impact  large  numbers  of  informal  settler \nhouseholds  residing  on  government  land  near  railway  tracks,  resulting  in  a  much  larger \npercentage of project-affected households living in poverty than for other infrastructure projects. \nThe  project\u2019s  resettlement  action  plans  (RAPs)  will  address  poverty  among  displaced  people \nthrough  a  robust  livelihood  restoration  and  improvement  program  that  will  provide  additional \nsupport to vulnerable households and assist low-income informal settlers in gaining tenure of a \nhome.25 The site validation process will include criteria on accessibility to schools, health facilities, \nand transport; and the DOTr will be required to ensure that all utilities are in place and functioning \nat resettlement sites before families are relocated. \n \n16. \nAlignment with Strategy 2030. The project is aligned with pillar 1 of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 \non accelerating infrastructure and long-term investments of the CPS (footnote 17), which aims to \ndevelop  climate-resilient  infrastructure  to  meet  expanding  demand;  better  connect  regions, \ncommunities, and people; and raise competitiveness.26 The project supports the implementation \nof Strategy 2030 as summarized in Table 1.27 \n \n                                                \n23 The consultant firm engaged under this Technical Assistance Loan is the \u201cshadow operator\u201d for the project and acts \nas  the  operator  of  the  railway  during  the  design  and  construction  phase  of  the  project,  until  the  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) contractor has been selected and mobilized. \n\n24 Once O&M cost including replacement of equipment are fully covered by revenues, the DOTr intends to replace the \n\nO&M contract with a concession agreement. \n\n25 TA for Poverty Reduction in Communities Affected by the Malolos\u2013Clark Railway Project, which will be financed by \nan ADB-administered trust fund and will further support the livelihood restoration program for poor displaced persons, \nis under preparation. \n\n26 ADB.  2018.

The project will support gender equity by \nencouraging contractors to employ at least 40% women during construction and \noperation. The project will also support programs to raise awareness amongst women, \nincluding project affected women, on employment opportunities created by the project. \nPromoting women\u2019s economic empowerment. The project will maximize women\u2019s \naccess to markets and opportunities for skilled jobs.  \nAccelerating low greenhouse gas development. The project will support climate \nchange mitigation by encouraging commuters to shift from road- to rail-based public \nurban transport with lower GHG emissions. \nEnsuring a comprehensive approach to build climate and disaster resilience. The \nproject supports the implementation of climate- and disaster-resilient infrastructure, with \ndesigns addressing earthquake risks and flooding risks during strong rainfalls and \ntyphoons. \n\nMaking cities more livable  Providing integrated solutions.

By contracting operation and maintenance of the \nproject to a private sector entity, the project will promote more effective and timely \nservice delivery and encourage greater accountability for the services provided.  \nStrengthening capacity and standards. The project will provide capacity development \nsupport to uphold environmental and social safeguards, adhere to procurement and \nfinancial management standards, and implement anticorruption measures. \nEnhancing connectivity and competitiveness. The project will improve access to \nClark International Airport, improve NCR\u2013Central Luzon connectivity, and enhance the \ncompetitiveness of the Philippines by facilitating access to higher-capacity regional and \ninternational air transport. \nGHG = greenhouse gas, NCR = national capital region. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nFostering regional \ncooperation and \nintegration \n\nIII. \n\nTHE INVESTMENT PROJECT \n\nOutputs \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  local,  national,  and  international \n17. \nconnectivity  improved  (footnote  4).

The project will help finance the construction \nof an elevated double-track railway lines totaling 53.1 km, including the 51.2 km Malolos\u2013Clark\u2013\nCIA  section  (Malolos\u2013Clark  section),  and  the  1.9  km  Solis\u2013Blumentritt  section  (Blumentritt \nextension) linking the project to the existing rail-based public urban transport system in Manila. \nThe project also includes (i) construction of a depot near CIA for the maintenance of rolling stock \nand fixed assets, with a training center for railway staff and an operation control center; and (ii) \nseven stations integrating design features that are friendly to and safe for elderly people, women, \nchildren, and people living with disabilities. \n \n19. \nOutput 2: Institutional capacity strengthened. Implementing the project and preparing \nfuture O&M arrangements require a high level of capacity in managing projects, contracts, and \n\n                                                \n28 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fdocument flow. The component will (i) establish a training program for DOTr staff in procurement, \nproject  and  contract  management,  railway  operation,  and  asset  management;  (ii)  establish  a \nsystem  to  manage  the  document  and  funding  flow  among  all  parties  involved  in  project \nimplementation,  including  technical  staff;  and  (iii)  address  the  government\u2019s  gender  and \ndevelopment  mandates  to  ensure  the  provision  of  quality  railway  services  to  women  and \nmarginalized segments of the population. \n \n20. \nConsulting services. Project design, implementation, and capacity development for the \nentire  NSCR  network  will  be  supported  by  the  following  consulting  services:  (i)  detailed \nengineering  design  consultants  financed  by  JICA;  (ii)  JICA-financed  general  consultant  and \nconstruction  supervision  consultant  who  will  coordinate  all  project  activities  and  construction \nsupervision for contracts financed by ADB and JICA; (iii) advisory services to the DOTr provided \nby the consulting firm recruited under the IPIF (footnote 20), which will also support procurement \nand serve as the shadow operator (footnote 23) until the O&M contract is awarded; and (iv) project \npreparation and implementation support consultants financed by ADB TA (footnotes 2 and 21). \n \nUse of multitranche financing facility. These outputs are best financed by an MFF to \n21. \nachieve the outcome in an efficient and effective manner.29 The Malolos\u2013Clark Railway Project \nwill be financed by an MFF with three tranches adopting the time-slicing approach for large-scale \nstand-alone projects. At the time of MFF processing, the design, procurement, and safeguards \nhave been appraised for the entire MFF. Each tranche will finance slices of a group of contracts \nper the indicative tranche schedule, and the amount for each tranche will be requested per the \ndisbursement  progress  and  projection.  The  tranche  schedule  is  based  on  the  disbursement \nprojection. The MFF modality enables ADB to support implementation of the road map under the \npolicy  framework  through  a  long-term  partnership  with  the  government  and  to  combine \ninfrastructure investments with policy dialogue and sector reforms. \n \n22. \nthe project. \n \nC. \n \n23. \nphysical and price contingencies, interest, and other charges during implementation (Table 2). \n \n\nThe  investment  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $6.139  billion,  including  taxes  and  duties, \n\nScope of project 1.

The  project  will  be  cofinanced  by  JICA  on  a  parallel \ncollaborative basis,  but the  cofinancing  will  not  be  administered  by  ADB.31 The  JICA  loan  was \napproved in December 2018 and signed on 21 January 2019. \n \nD. \n \n28. \nThe DOTr will be the executing agency for the project. A project management office (PMO) \nwill be established under the office of the undersecretary for railways. A full-time project manager \nwill head the PMO and will be directly responsible for day-to-day implementation of the project. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n                                                \n30 Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 ADB is financing civil works (i.e., viaducts, bridges, stations, tunnels, and depot buildings) while JICA is financing the \ncore  system  (i.e.,  tracks,  depot  equipment,  power  supply  and  electrification,  signaling  and  telecommunication \nsystems, and procurement of rolling stock) and consulting services. The audited project financial statements for the \nproject will cover expenditures financed by ADB and/or the DOTr only, and will not include JICA cofinancing. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fConsultants  financed  by  ADB  under  the  IPIF  will  advise  the  PMO  on  project  preparation, \nprocurement, and project management. The project will be implemented under the government\u2019s \nhybrid  policy  for  infrastructure  investments  (paragraph  8);  specific  O&M  arrangements  will  be \nestablished during project implementation. Under this framework, a private service contractor will \noperate and maintain the Malolos\u2013Clark Railway, together with other sections of the NSCR. The \nDOTr  will  be  assisted  by  consultants  engaged  under  IPIF,  who  will  also  serve  as  the  shadow \noperator  (footnote  23),  until  the  O&M  contract  is  signed  in  2020.  The  DOTr  will  cover  O&M \nexpenditures, especially in the initial years of operation before all sections have been completed \nand  revenue  is  insufficient  to  cover  the  full  cost  of  O&M.  Implementation  arrangements  are \nsummarized in Table 4 and described in detail, including specific arrangements for project 1, in \nthe FAM. \n \n\nTable 4: Implementation Arrangements \n\nMay 2019\u2013December 2024 \nTranche 1: December 2021; MFF: December 2024 \n\nArrangements \n\nAspects \nMFF availability period \nEstimated completion date \nManagement \n\n(i)  Executing agency \n(ii)  Project management office \n\nProcurement \nRetroactive financing and advance \ncontracting \n\nDisbursement \n\n6 civil works contracts \n\nDepartment of Transportation  \nManila, 1 full-time project director with 2 senior project manager, 13 project \nmanager (1 for each contract) and up to 330 staff in 12 divisionsa \nOpen competitive bidding \nRetroactive financing and advance contracting is proposed for works, goods \nand services, and consultant recruitment. Retroactive financing will be \nprovided to finance expenditures incurred before loan effectivity, but not \nearlier than 12 months before signing the loan agreements and not exceeding \n20% of the respective loan amount. \nThe loan proceeds will be disbursed following ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements \nagreed between the government and ADB. \n\n$2.525 billion \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, MFF = multitranche financing facility. \na  The  project  management  office  will  be  established  to  manage  the  implementation  of  the  Malolos\u2013Clark  Railway \nProject and the South Commuter Railway Project. The full quantity of 330 staff will be posted once implementation \nof both projects starts. \nSource: ADB estimates.  \n \nADB-financed works will be procured through open competitive bidding following the ADB \n29. \nProcurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB \nBorrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). The DOTr will be supported by the Procurement \nService of the Department of Budget and Management and the consultant team engaged under \nthe  IPIF  in  the  procurement  process.  ADB  will  support  to  ensure timeliness  and  quality  of  the \nprocurement process in accordance with ADB\u2019s procurement requirements. \n \n30. \nProject readiness. Project readiness is high, as the entire scope to be financed by the \nMFF  has  been  appraised  by  ADB,  the  detailed  engineering  design  has  been  completed,  and \nbidding  for  the  first  three  contracts  financed  under  the  MFF  started  in  January  2019.  The \ncontractor will be mobilized by October 2019. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\n \nA. \n \nConsultants recruited under the IPIF have confirmed the project\u2019s technical viability. The \n31. \nrailway line is fully grade-separated; this will minimize the impact on communities along the line, \nreduce the risk of flooding and improve the safety of operations. Adaptation measures related to \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\fEconomic and Financial \n\nthe location and elevation of the depot, slope protection at river crossings, cross-drainage, and \nconstruction  of  the  line  mainly  on  the  viaduct  have  been  incorporated  in  the  project  design  to \nreduce climate change risks. The design criteria are based on international best practices and \nproven technologies for suburban commuter railways and have been standardized for the NSCR \nto ensure interoperability and simplify O&M. \n \nB. \n \nEconomic and financial  analyses  concluded  that  the  project  is  economically  viable and \n32. \nfinancially sustainable.32 The project will provide faster rail connectivity for commuters along the \nManila\u2013Clark  corridor,  where  road  transport  has  traditionally  been  the  primary  mode  of \ntransportation. Demand forecasts were prepared using DOTr\u2019s multi-modal transport model for \nthe greater NCR. It is estimated that by 2040, 30%\u201340% of passengers in the corridor will shift to \nthe new rail line. The project\u2019s economic internal rate of return is 12.3%, and the net present value \nis $1.9 billion using a 9% discount rate. The economic analysis compared the benefits and costs \nof  with-project  and  without-project  scenarios.  The  main  project  benefits  relate  to  (i)  savings  in \ntravel time for rail passengers: direct express rail services will connect Manila with CIA within 1 \nhour, while travel by bus from Manila to Clark takes 2\u20133 hours depending on the time of the day; \n(ii)  savings  associated  with  reduced  congestion  on  parallel  roads  (traffic  on  these  roads  is \nprojected to decline by about 10%); and (iii) reduced carbon dioxide emissions associated with \nroad  travel.  A  sensitivity  analysis  tested  the  effects  of  possible  negative  changes  in  the  key \nparameters  that  determine  the  project\u2019s  costs  and  benefits.  The  analysis  indicates  that  the \nproject\u2019s economic viability would remain satisfactory even under adverse scenarios. \n \nA financial assessment was undertaken to examine the viability of the project investment. \n33. \nThe project\u2019s lending decision is based on economic viability rather than financial viability. The \nincremental  revenues  generated  by  the  project  during  its  first  40  years  of  operations  will  be \nsufficient  to  finance  the  project\u2019s  recurrent  costs,  including  replacement  of  rolling  stock.  In the \ninitial years of operation, particularly before the southern section is completed, revenues will be \ninsufficient to cover all O&M costs. The government has committed to fully finance project O&M. \n \nC. \n \n34. \nFinancial management. The financial management assessment was prepared following \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects  and  Financial  Due \nDiligence: A Methodology Note, and related technical guidance notes.33 The assessment found \nthat the DOTr has sound financial and accounting systems; adheres to the procedures, manuals, \npolicies,  guidelines,  and  reporting  framework  prescribed  by  the  Commission  of  Audit;  follows \naccrual-based accounting in an enterprise resource planning system based on Philippine Public \nSector Accounting Standards; and has a robust internal control system with a separate internal \naudit division. The overall financial management assessment risk is substantial, with appropriate \nrisk mitigation measures in place. Details of risks and key mitigating measures are in the FAM. \n \n35. \nProcurement  and  anticorruption  measures.  ADB  will  review  procurement-related \ndocuments at all major milestones before proceeding with bidding and contract awards. Six large \nworks  packages  will  be  procured  to  complete  the  project  and  will  be  financed  by  ADB  under \ntranche 1 and subsequent tranches. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                \n32 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n33 ADB. 2005.

The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the FAM. \n \nD. \n \n36. \nThe project will contribute to economic growth and employment by facilitating mobility and \nimproving  accessibility  to  centers  of  job  opportunities.  By  2022,  it  is  estimated  that  81,000 \npassengers  per  day  will  travel  along  the  Blumentritt\u2013Malolos\u2013Clark\u2013CIA  section  of  the  NSCR. \nConstruction activities under the project will create temporary employment for more than 23,900 \nworkers, and the operation of the project railways will provide employment to more than 1,400 \npeople.  The  train  services  will  help  poor  and  low-income  families,  including  women,  access \nincome-generating  opportunities,  health  services,  and  educational  facilities.  This  will  reduce \npoverty and alleviate disparity among urban, peri-urban, and rural areas. The project benefits of \nreduced  travel  time,  increased  social  mobility,  and  safety\u2014factors  that  facilitate  getting  out  of \nincome poverty\u2014will benefit women in particular by better access to jobs and education. Informal \nsettlers along the PNR right-of-way will also benefit from secured tenure options through social \nhousing  programs  included  in  the  resettlement  activities,  as  well  as  livelihood  restoration  and \nimprovement programs included in the RAPs. \n \nGender action plan. The project is classified effective gender mainstreaming. The gender \n37. \naction plan includes the following key measures: (i) integrating gender-responsive and inclusive \ndesign features in the new rail stations; (ii) implementing interventions to prevent and address \nsexual harassment in public transport and during executing civil works; (iii) strengthening capacity \nfor gender mainstreaming within the DOTr and partner agencies; and (iv) strongly encourage the \nO&M contractor to promote gender equality and to employ 40% women in the O&M workforce.34 \nFor women directly affected by the project, the gender action plan will also ensure that livelihood \nskills programs are gender-responsive in line with the gender mainstreaming mandate of partner \ngovernment agencies, such as the technical education and skills development authorities and the \npublic employment service offices of the local government units. \n \n38. \nHIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking.  HIV  infection  and  human  trafficking  are  risks  in  the \nproject areas. The influx of workers in the project area during construction could create additional \nHIV  transmission  risks.  The  project  will  mitigate  these  risks  by  providing  HIV  awareness  and \nprevention programs to construction workers. as set out in the environmental management plan \n(EMP) that will form part of the contractor\u2019s obligations. Livelihood disruptions resulting from land \nacquisition and relocation will create additional human trafficking risks, that will be addressed by \na detailed livelihood restoration and improvement program set out in the RAPs. \n \n39. \nCommunication strategy. A communication and participation strategy for the project is \nunder  preparation  with  support  by  ADB  TA  (footnote  2).  Incorporating  stakeholder  analysis \nfindings, the  strategy  will  identify  effective communication channels,  best  approaches to foster \nparticipation  and  partnerships,  key  messages,  and  means  of  integrating  activities  with  the \ngrievance redressal mechanism. The strategy will set forth implementation time lines, roles and \nresponsibilities, budget, monitoring and evaluation requirements for project communication. Key \ncomponents of the strategy will include proactively disclosing project information and activities to \nlocal  communities  and  stakeholders;  soliciting  stakeholders\u2019  input  and  feedback  on  beneficial \nmitigation measures; encouraging community participation in project activities that affect or could \nbenefit  stakeholders,  such  as  civil  works  construction;  and  conducting  awareness-raising \nactivities related to HIV/AIDS, human trafficking, and safety measures. The PMO will have overall \n\n                                                \n34 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n12 \n\n \n\n\fSafeguards \n\nresponsibility for the implementation of the strategy, supported by the construction supervision \nconsultant. Required resources will principally take the form of human resource input from local \ngovernment units, local community-based organizations, and contractors involved in the project. \n \nE. \n \n40. \nThe  project  comprises  the  (i)  Malolos\u2013Clark  section  (51.2  km)  and  (ii)  the  Blumentritt \nextension; (1.9 km). The project is cofinanced by JICA, and the facilities financed by JICA  are \nincluded in the assessment of safeguard impacts.35 Implementation of the project will follow ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009). The Malolos\u2013Clark section and the Blumentritt extension are \nextensions of the Tutuban\u2013Solis\u2013Malolos project, which was conceptualized earlier and is being \nimplemented  by  the government  with financial  support from  JICA. The Tutuban\u2013Solis\u2013Malolos \nproject will be implemented following safeguard procedures agreed between the government and \nJICA. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the safeguard categories of \nthe project are as follows.36 \n \nEnvironment (category A). The project was assessed category A for the environment. \n41. \nEnvironmental impact assessments (EIAs) have been prepared for the Malolos\u2013Clark section and \nfor  the  Blumentritt  extension  in compliance with the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.37 Key  project \nenvironmental issues identified and addressed are dust emissions during construction, noise and \nvibration during construction and operation, waste generation, traffic congestion and impediments \nto public access, and occupational and community health and safety. Public consultations were \nundertaken  during  EIA  preparation.  The  DOTr  will  ensure  that  (i)  the  EMP  in  the  EIAs  will  be \nincorporated in bid documents for all packages regardless of financing source; (ii) consultations \nwith people affected by construction activities are carried out throughout construction; and (iii) the \ngrievance redress mechanism will be adequately resourced, and publicized before commencing \ncivil works. The DOTr will allocate resources for proper EMP implementation and will designate \nstaff to supervise and monitor  EMP implementation, supported by the construction supervision \nconsultant. The DOTr will engage an external environmental monitor and will submit semiannual \ninternal  and  external  monitoring  reports  to  ADB  for  review  and  public  disclosure.  The \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  framework  for  the  MFF  following  the  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  will  guide  the  preparation  of  environmental  assessment  documents,  if  required,  for \nsubsequent tranches. The environmental assessment and review framework and the draft EIAs \nwere disclosed on ADB\u2019s website, the draft EIAs were published on 3 December 2018.38 \n \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  A).  The  project  was  assessed  category  A  for \n42. \ninvoluntary resettlement. The project will require acquisition of 49 hectares (ha) of land: 46 ha for \nthe  Malolos\u2013Clark  section  and  3  ha  for  the  Blumentritt  extension.  Resettlement  impacts  have \nbeen minimized by using PNR-owned land and government-owned land wherever possible. Out \nof the estimated 1,889 project affected households, equivalent to a total number of 7,581 project \naffected persons, the majority are expected to be severely affected and required to relocate and \nmost of them are informal settlers. A resettlement and indigenous peoples planning framework \n(RIPPF) has been prepared for the MFF following the Safeguard Policy Statement to guide the \npreparation of the RAPs. The RAPs have been prepared for the Malolos\u2013Clark section and the \nBlumentritt extension based on resettlement surveys, social assessments, and consultations. The \n\n                                                \n35 ADB and JICA will closely coordinate the implementation of the projects, including any safeguard matters. \n36 ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n37 The EIA for the Blumentritt extension is part of the EIA for the Solis\u2013Calamba section, which will be financed as part \n\nof ADB\u2019s South Commuter Railway Project, planned for board consideration in 2020. \n\n38 Environmental Impact Assessments and Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the \n\nlist of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\fRAPs will be updated based on the detailed engineering design. The RAPs mitigate involuntary \nresettlement impacts by providing compensation at replacement cost along with assistance for \nrelocation  and  livelihood  restoration.  Measures  have  been  incorporated  to  improve  the  living \nstandards  of  vulnerable  affected  people.  As  the  DOTr  has  limited  experience  in  implementing \nRAPs for foreign-assisted projects, capacity building will be supported by ADB TA (footnote 2). \nThe DOTr has set up a right-of-way PMO and a technical working committee. A comprehensive \ngrievance redress mechanism has been established, and ADB staff and consultants have initiated \ntraining  sessions  on  rolling  out  the  mechanism.  RAP  implementation  will  be  financed  by  the \ngovernment. The RIPPF and RAPs have been disclosed on ADB\u2019s website.39 \n \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  B).  The  whole  project  is  assessed  category  B  for \n43. \nindigenous  peoples  because  of  the  project\u2019s  proximity  to  indigenous  ancestral  domain  land  in \nPampanga  province.  However,  due diligence  confirmed that the  project does not  encroach on \nindigenous peoples\u2019 land and a certificate of non-overlap with ancestral domain land has been \nissued  by  the  Philippines\u2019  National  Commission  on  Indigenous  Peoples.  Furthermore,  due \ndiligence for the project indicated that impacts on indigenous peoples are not anticipated, and an \nindigenous peoples plan was not prepared. The RIPPF for the MFF follows the Safeguard Policy \nStatement to guide the preparation of indigenous peoples plans, should impacts on indigenous \npeoples be identified when subsequent tranches are processed. \n \nF. \n \n44. \nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  5  and  described  in \ndetail  in  the  Risk  Assessment  and  Risk  Management  Plan.40 It  is  expected  that  the  integrated \nbenefits and impacts will outweigh the costs. \n \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nRisks \nDelay in releasing \ncounterpart funds \n\nO&M financial \nsustainability \n\nDelay in Tutuban\u2013\nSolis\u2013Malolos \nrailway project \ncompletion \n\nDelay in capacity \nexpansion of Clark \nInternational Airport \n\nDelay in the \ndevelopment of \nNew Clark City \nIncrease in building \nmaterial costs \n\nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigation Measures \n\nNEDA approved the project in November 2018; land acquisition and resettlement costs and \ncounterpart funds for works are budgeted in 2019.
