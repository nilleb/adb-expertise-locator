The summary of the environmental impact assessment was \nAssessment  circulated  to  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) and placed on the ADB website on 28 May 2007. \n   \nProject Description  The Project covers 3,655 square kilometers of the oasis of the Yinchuan \nPlain extending into the Helan Mountains to the west of the Yellow River \nin Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. It comprises three districts and two \ncounties that surround the ancient city of Yinchuan, the capital. The \nProject will support the policies and plans of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous \nRegion government (NHARG) to combat land degradation through an \nintegrated  ecosystem  management  (IEM)  approach.  Since  2003,  the \nPRC has been selectively introducing IEM in acknowledgment of the \nmultidimensional nature of land degradation. IEM approaches emphasize \nthe  links  between  natural  ecosystem  capacities  and  socioeconomic \nactivities,  and  seek  to  holistically  rehabilitate  damaged  ecosystem \nservices and functions by tackling the root causes of damaging practices, \nincluding  reduction  of  rural  poverty.  The  Project  will  reform  enabling \npolicies and regulations, as well as build institutional, regulatory, and \npolicy capacity to combat land degradation using an IEM approach. It will \ndemonstrate measures to achieve improved water and land use planning \nand  management,  support  sustainable  rural  livelihoods  in  poor \ncommunities  through  contracts  with  commercial  enterprises,  and  link \ncommercial  and  conservation  values  to  rehabilitate  the  degraded \nwetlands and grasslands. A Global Environment Facility (GEF) grant will \nensure  that  an  IEM  approach  is used  in  project  implementation  and \nprovide support measures to protect 15 globally threatened species. A \nmarket-based approach will be taken to promote sustainable resource \nuse  and  protect  and  conserve  wetlands,  grasslands,  transboundary \nflyways, and cultural sites. Tourism and recreation opportunities will be \nprovided for 1.1 million local residents and visitors.  \n   \nRationale The PRC has some of the worst land degradation problems in the world, \n \nespecially in the vast western region where more than 350 million people \nlive  and  poverty  incidence  is  the  highest.  In  recent  decades,  the \npressures of intensified use, increased population, and rapid economic \ngrowth  have  led  to  losses  of  vital  ecosystem  services,  and  reduced \nproductivity of grasslands, farmlands, wetlands, forests, and mountain \nareas.   \n ", "ii   \n  Programs  to  combat  land  degradation  were  initiated  under  the  9th \n(1996\u25002000) and 10th (2001\u25002005) five\u2013year plans, and have resulted \nin some environmental improvements. However, the high cost of top-\ndown and uncoordinated sector approaches are of concern. The root \ncauses, such as rural poverty and alternative livelihood options to reduce \nactivities that damage the environment, were inadequately addressed. \nThe project area typifies problems found in many parts of the western \nregion. Very fast economic growth in recent years, overuse of water and \nagrochemicals in agriculture, conversion of marginal desert-edge lands \nto irrigation for poor farming households, and rapid urban and industrial \nspread  with  high  pollution  have  resulted  in  significant  loss  of  vital \necosystem  services  and  values.  Reversing  this  trend  requires \nstrengthening  the  quality  of  the  policy  and  regulatory  framework, \ncoordinating land and water planning and management, and expanding \nthe role of markets in activities that are compatible with the rehabilitation \nof ecosystems and their sustainable future use.\n \n   \nImpact and  The impact of the Project will be improved environmental management to \nOutcome  rehabilitate the ecosystems and increased rural incomes in the Yinchuan \narea. The main outcome is to introduce an IEM approach to provide \nsustainable livelihoods for the population of the project area.  \n   \nProject Investment  The  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $221.0  million \nPlan  equivalent, including taxes and duties of $4.2 million. \n   \nFinancing Plan  A loan of $100,000,000 from the ordinary capital resources of ADB will \nbe provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term including a grace \nperiod of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, \nand  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan \nAgreement. NHARG will ensure counterpart funding of $116.5 million \nequivalent. \n \nGEF grant cofinancing of $4,545,000 equivalent, to be administered by \nADB, has been approved for the Project. \n   \nAmount \nSource  ($ million)  % \nA.

NHARG will onlend part of the loan proceeds to the participating \nlocal government agencies under the same terms and conditions as the \nADB  loan.  The  subborrowers  will  assume  the  foreign  exchange  and \ninterest rate variation risks for their part of the ADB loan.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 April 2015 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 October 2014 \nCompletion Date   \n   \nImplementation  NHARG will be responsible for overall implementation of the Project and \nArrangements  for coordinating activities of the project implementing agencies and their \nrespective  project  implementation  units.  The  lead  group,  formed  by \nNHARG, will ensure coordination across sectors and provide important \ndecision-making for key project plans, strategic decisions, and policy \nissues. The provincial project management office (PPMO), established \nby  NHARG,  will  be  provided  with  adequate  full-time  staff.  It  will  be \nresponsible for day-to-day project implementation, and coordinate and \nprovide leadership in IEM approaches. IEM capacity within the PPMO \nwill be developed.  \n   \nExecuting Agency  NHARG, through its Finance Department \n   \nProcurement  Goods, works, and related services for ADB-financed and GEF-financed \ncontracts  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Depending on the \nvalue, contracts for equipment and materials will be awarded through a \ncombination  of  international  competitive  bidding,  limited  international \nbidding, national competitive bidding, direct contracting, and community \nparticipation. Foreign contractors may bid on contracts using national \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures.  A  procurement  plan  covering  goods, \nworks, and services, including the contract value, procurement method, \nand  prequalification  of  bidders  was  agreed  with  NHARG  at  loan \nappraisal. \n   \nConsulting  The  Project  will  finance  27  person-months  of  international  and  100 \nServices  person-months  of  national  consulting  services  in  three  contract \npackages.  \n \nPackage A, comprising 4 international and 7 national person-months to \nstrengthen the project management capabilities of the PPMO, will be \nfinanced  from  the  GEF  grant.  Individual  consultant  selection  will  be \napplied.  ADB  will  be  responsible  for  recruitment  and  the  PPMO  for \ncontract negotiations and contract management.  \n \nPackage B, comprising 12 international and 77 national person-months \nto provide technical specialists, will be financed from the GEF grant. A \nconsulting  firm  will  be  recruited,  based  on  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection  (80:20),  to  provide  the  required  services.  ADB  will  be \nresponsible for recruitment and the PPMO for contract negotiations and \ncontract management. \n ", "iv   \n  Package C, comprising 11 international and 16 national person-months \nto provide specialist technical services in water resource management, \nwill be financed directly from the loan. Individual consultant selection will \nbe  applied.  The  PPMO  will  be  responsible  for  selection,  contract \nnegotiations, and contract management. Consultants will be recruited in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time).  \n   \nProject Benefits  Income  benefits  will  be  achieved  for  about  46,400  rural  households, \nand Beneficiaries   including previously resettled poor communities and Hui minority people. \nThese will result from linkages to enterprises in conservation-oriented \nproduction of beef, dairy, grapes, and other agricultural activities such as \nChinese  dates,  wolfberry,  and  other  fruits;  fodder;  and  significant \nproduction of vegetables, mushrooms, medicinal herbs, and cut flowers. \nVocational and technical training will be provided for rural households. \nAbout 5,200 nonfarming jobs will be created in the livestock, perennial \ncrops, and other agricultural industries.  \n \nProject activities will enhance the environment and improve the habitats \nof Shahu Lake, Yuehai Lake, and the Yinchuan City wetlands. Water \nresources and livelihood improvement will directly benefit about 10% of \nthe  land  area  and  an  estimated  32%  of  the  rural  population.  About \n124,195  hectares  of  the  piedmont  zone  of  the  Helan  Mountains, \nwetlands,  and  the  Helan  Nature  Reserve  will  benefit  from  improved \nprotection and conservation management. The benefits from investments \nto restore and conserve ecosystem functions, services, and values to \nhelp  protect  the  habitat  of  threatened  wild  species  have  not  been \nquantified but are believed to be substantial. \n   \nRisks and  The Project adopts an ecosystem-based approach to address the root \nAssumptions  causes of land degradation and related issues, and the planning and \nimplementation  of  project  activities.  Top-down  and  sector-specific \napproaches to land degradation have been expensive and only partially \nsuccessful in the PRC.  \n \nRisks facing successful project management and implementation include \n(i) lack of familiarity with ADB policies and procedures; (ii) changes in \nPPMO personnel; (iii) bureaucratic and lengthy procurement decision-\nmaking; (iv) inadequate management capacity that compounds delays; \nand (v) procurement, fraud, and corruption. To mitigate these risks, the \nProject  will  provide  technical  and  management  advisory  support  and \ntraining, particularly during the first 2 years of project implementation. \nThe multifaceted character of the Project limits its financial and economic \nrisks. The risks to individual activities may be significant, but are all \nunlikely to occur, so the overall project risk is low.   \n \n \n ", "  v\n  Market risks include (i) excess production could lower local prices and \nreduce  returns  to  households,  which  would  be  more  likely  if  local \nproduction is not adequately connected to market distribution chains; and \n(ii) tourism demand could fail to grow as expected due to congestion or \nother negative impacts. These risks will be mitigated through planning \nand  coordination  of  producers,  market  diversification,  and  integrated \ntourism sector planning. Some activities face technical risks, and these \nare addressed by ensuring that appropriate contractual relationships are \nin place; and providing for adequate reviews, technical assessments, \nand monitoring. \n   \nGEF Grant  In October 2002, the PRC Government entered a strategic partnership \nwith  GEF  and  other  international  partners  to  develop  and  scale  up \ncomprehensive  resource  management  approaches  that  integrate  the \necological,  economic,  and  social  dimensions  of  the  land  degradation \nproblem  through  an  IEM  approach.  GEF  has  provided  a  grant  of \n$4,545,000,  which  will  be  administered  by  ADB.  The  GEF-financed \nactivities  will  ensure  the  IEM  approach  is  followed  to  contribute  to \nrestoring the productive and protective functions of the area\u2019s ecosystem \nresources. The project area includes 68% of the vertebrate species and \n42%  of  vascular  plants  in  the  Ningxia  Hui  Autonomous  Region;  the \nalluvial  plain  of  the  Yellow  River  system  is  its  most  important  zone. \nFifteen globally threatened species are in the project area, of which nine \nare permanent residents and the other six are migratory birds. An IEM \napproach will be followed for protecting resident and migratory species \nand their grassland and wetland habitats, as well as for building the \ninstitutional and regulatory capacity to rehabilitate, sustainably manage, \nand protect the ecosystems in the project area.  \n   \n \n \n ", "vi \n \n \n ", "vii \n \n ", " \n \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), and (ii) proposed administration of a grant from \nthe Global Environment Facility (GEF) for the Ningxia Integrated Ecosystem and Agricultural \nDevelopment Project.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  In  August  2005,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  project  preparatory \ntechnical assistance (TA) to help the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region (NHAR) of the PRC to \nformulate the Project.1 GEF also provided assistance to formulate the Project. This report is \nbased on the findings of the TA, feasibility studies of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region \ngovernment  (NHARG),  findings  of  ADB  missions,  and  discussions  with  officials  and \nstakeholders. The project design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n3.  The PRC has some of the worst land degradation in the world, with more than 40% of its \nland area, or between 3 million and 4 million square kilometers (km2) adversely affected. The \nvast western region accounts for 71% of the country\u2019s land area and has a population of more \nthan 350 million, including many of the most poor and vulnerable. A strong correlation exists \nbetween  land  degradation  and  poverty  incidence.  Although  the  western  region  has  fewer \nbiodiversity species than the rest of the country, the richness of the endemic species is higher, \nand a serious threat of species extinction coexists with severe to moderate land degradation in \nnearly half of its area. The pressures of intensified use and rapid economic growth in recent \ndecades have adversely impacted the quality of most farmland, grassland, forests, wetlands, \nand mountain areas of the western region. To respond to the increasing threat, the PRC \nGovernment (the Government) significantly expanded its programs to combat land degradation \nunder the 9th (1996\u20132000) and 10th (2001\u20132005) five-year plans (FYPs), including reforestation, \nclosure and protection of natural forests, grassland improvement, soil and water conservation, \nbiodiversity  protection,  and  renewable  rural  energy.  The  Western  Development  Strategy, \nadopted  in  1999,  aims  to  (i)  reduce  economic  disparities  between  the  western  and  other \nregions, and (ii) ensure sustainable natural resource management. \n \n4.  Located  in  the  center  of  the  western  region,  Ningxia  is  the  smallest  of  the  PRC\u2019s \nprovinces, with a land area of 66,400 km2 and a population of only 5.8 million. It is one of the \ncountry\u2019s five ethnic minority regions, with approximately 2.1 million Hui, most of whom maintain \nMuslim traditions. Mostly a dry and desert-like region, it is bordered by the Yinchuan Plain in the \nnorth along the Yellow River, which runs for 397 kilometers (km) from the west to the northeast \nand provides extensive irrigation areas. Semi-arid loess plateau areas in the south and the large \nTenger,  Ulan  Buh,  and  Mu  Us  deserts  border  the  northern  and  eastern  parts  of  Ningxia. \nAlthough it has the second smallest provincial gross domestic product, Ningxia\u2019s economy grew \nquickly with annual growth of 10.9% during the 10th FYP, exceeding the national average and \nsupported by the continuing stimulus of the Western Development Strategy. Infrastructure and \nsocial  indicators  improved  significantly,  and  poverty  decreased.  Urbanization,  at  42%,  is \ngrowing at 9% annually. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005.

The TA is under the \nCountry Programming Framework for the PRC\u2013GEF Partnership on Land Degradation in Dryland Ecosystems. \n ", "2   \n5.  The oasis of the Yinchuan Plain has the best natural resource endowment in Ningxia. \nThe Yellow River flows through it, and it has areas of good soil in the alluvial plain and irrigation \ncanals dating back more than 2,000 years. It is protected from the prevailing winds and large \ndeserts to the north by the Helan Mountains. Wetlands provide an international flyway for birds \nmoving seasonally between north Asia and southern areas of the PRC and beyond. The project \narea lies in and around this oasis on the western side of the Yellow River, including the \npiedmont zone and the Helan Mountains, and covers about 3,655 km2 including three districts \n(Jinfeng,  Xingqing,  and  Xixia),  two  counties  (Helan  and  Yongning),  and  Yinchuan  City. \nYinchuan, the capital, is undergoing a building boom, including a new district to support a large \nnew  government  complex;  it  is  densely  settled  with  a  population  of  1.14  million.2 Poverty \nincidence is quite low, but the area has pockets of resettled poor migrants (about 74,000) from \nthe southern region of Ningxia. Over time, the quality of the water and land resources has been \ndegraded because of expansion of agriculture onto marginal soils, overgrazing, and industrial \nand urban pollution, with significant loss of vital ecosystem functions, including loss of habitat for \nwild  species  and  loss  of  productive  capacity.  However,  the  project  area  has  favorable \nhydrological characteristics; and major features of the Yellow River pass through it; the area has \nconsiderable deep alluvial aquifers in the wetlands and the protected Helan Mountains. These \nconditions provide the area with resources key to enterprise development in livestock raising, \nmeat and dairy production, higher-value horticulture, and tourism-related industries. A review of \nthe sector analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n6.  NHARG has taken preliminary measures to conserve water, close the Helan Mountains \nto grazing, promote conservation agriculture, and seek a more comprehensive approach to the \nroot causes of environmental degradation. NHARG\u2019s 11th FYP (2006\u25002010) recognizes the \nchallenge: \u201cThe implementation of the 10th FYP was good, but the weak economic status of the \nNHAR  remains.  We  face  problems  such  as  unsustainable  growth  and  lack  of  integrated \ndevelopment.\u201d3 However, economic considerations dominate planning and the target growth \nrate is more than 10% during the 11th FYP. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n7.  The  signs  and  symptoms  of  land  and  water  degradation,  including  salinity, \ndesertification, soil erosion, polluted waterways, and lack of vegetative cover on farming areas \nand grasslands, are widespread throughout the project area. As the population expanded and \nagricultural,  urban,  and  industrial  influences  grew,  ecosystem  degradation  and  the  lack  of \ncapacity to control it have become key problems. Contributing factors include the following: \n \n(i)  Unsuitable agricultural practices. On good agricultural land, excessive tillage \nand removal of all crop residues exposes soil to high seasonal winds, loss of soil \nquality, and high risk of dust storms. Poor rural households have been resettled \non marginal lands with lighter soils and low water-holding capacity. Crops grown \non these areas require large inputs of water and fertilizers to achieve acceptable \n                                                 \n2  The project area is 60% urban and 40% rural, with average per capita income of $919 equivalent in urban areas \nand $393 equivalent in rural areas. \n3  Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Government. 2006.

Beijing (12 February). \n ", "    3 \nproductivity,  leading  to  polluted  runoff  and  widespread  salinity.4 Increasing \ndemand for cashmere has led to replacing sheep with goats, and overstocking of \nanimals on grasslands. \n \n(ii)  Uncoordinated water and land management. Poor management of the lakes \nand  wetlands  along  the  Yellow  River  has  resulted  in  eutrophied  waterways, \npolluted  habitat  for  aquatic  and  birdlife,  and  loss  of  tourism  and  recreation \npotential.  Irrigation  canals  are  mostly  unlined  leading  to  large  losses  and \ninefficient  water  delivery.  Excessive  extraction  of  cheap  groundwater  for \nagriculture, industry, and urban uses has led to a lowering of the groundwater \ntable in some areas. \n \n(iii)  Poor  management  of  natural  resources.  Ecosystem  elements  have  been \ntreated  in  isolation  from  each  other,  based  on  institutional  mandates.  Land \ndegradation  control  and  ecosystem  rehabilitation  have  emphasized  top-down \nengineering solutions on a sector basis (e.g., programs in forestry, agriculture, \nand water resources), and have rarely involved the participation of local residents \nin identifying solutions. Habitat and biodiversity loss from inappropriate land use \nactivities and past poor ecosystem management decisions have resulted.       \n \n8.  Reversing ecosystem degradation in the project area requires that the root causes be \naddressed so that rehabilitation measures can be successful. Historically, the Government\u2019s \nprograms to combat land degradation have not adequately addressed these basic causes, \nwhich  include  rural  poverty,  lack  of  alternative  livelihoods  that  avoid  damaging  practices, \ninadequate land tenure arrangements, and lack of rural financial services. Although physical \nsigns of improvement can be seen in some areas (e.g., regrowth of vegetation after closure of \nthe  Helan  Mountains  to  grazing),  the  Government  remains  concerned  about  the  top-down \nsector-by-sector approach, lack of coordination within the institutional system to tackle cross-\nsector issues, high cost, and need to develop sustainable livelihoods for inhabitants of affected \nareas.5 As  identified  through  the  work  of  the  ongoing  PRC\u2013GEF  Partnership  on  Land \nDegradation in Dryland Ecosystems,6 including in the NHAR, and the work of the TA team \n(footnote  1),  the  main  barriers  to  be  overcome  to  address  the  root  causes  of  land  and \necosystem degradation in the project area are (i) improving the quality of the policy and legal \nand/or regulatory framework to provide a consistent, well-understood, and well-coordinated set \nof policies, incentive-based measures, and regulations to ensure adequate land tenure and land \n                                                 \n4  For example, in Ningxia, twice as much water is needed to produce a unit of rice compared to the national average. \nThe intensity of agrochemical use is five times the national average, while crop yield is only half the national \naverage. This has heavily contaminated water for agricultural irrigation. From 1986 to 2000, NHAR had the highest \npercentage growth in conversion of steppe and/or desert into irrigated cultivated land area of any province and/or \nregion, despite being one of the driest areas in the country. This has led directly to further land degradation as \nmany areas were either unsuitable for cultivation or were overcultivated, contributing to loss of soil health, drier \nsoils, increased exposure to wind erosion, and long-term desertification. \n5  Evidence of this is provided in two recent evaluation studies, (ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China for Poverty Reduction in Key Forestry Conservation Programs. Manila; and ADB. 2003. \nTechnical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Poverty Reduction in the Grassland Improvement \nProgram. Manila), which undertook field surveys covering the Government\u2019s major greenside environmental \nprograms in multiple provinces in 2005. Both studies concluded that while some good environmental outcomes \nwere achieved in line with their objectives (e.g., through tree planting and grassland rehabilitation), poverty was not \nsignificantly reduced, livelihood development was not achieved, and sustainability of the programs relied on large \ngovernment  subsidies.  The  studies  identified  key  reforms  to  be  addressed  by  future  programs,  including  \n(i) reversing the top-down and centralized approach to planning and implementation, and (ii) increasing the \nparticipation of local people. \n6  ADB. 2002.

Manila. \n ", "4   \nuse  arrangements;  (ii)  addressing  inconsistencies  between  sector  approaches  and  area \nplanning,  and  building  institutional  capacity  to  address  resource  management  using  an \necosystem approach, especially for upgrading land and water management; (iii) expanding the \nrole of markets to better serve the income needs of the rural population in industries by making \nmore efficient use of land and water; and (iv) linking commercial and conservation values in the \nfuture management of ecosystems.  \n \n9.  The existing policy and legal framework in the NHAR is reasonably clear about the \nrequirements, responsibilities, and working arrangements for all agencies; as well as the targets \nthey are expected to meet and the policies they have to follow. However, with regard to handling \nmore complex multisector issues, such as the control of land degradation, desertification, and \nbiodiversity protection, no effective mechanism is currently in place to ensure cooperation and \nconsultation  among  sectors,  institutions,  and  agencies.  Farmers  and  the  public  lack \nunderstanding  of  the  role  and  functions  of  regulations. Overlapping  functions between  the \nagencies  and  overlapping  responsibilities  between  specific  laws,  regulations,  and  policies \nrequire urgent reform and actions to meet the complex environmental challenges of the project \narea.7 Substantial efforts and cooperation at all levels are needed to remove the gaps and \noverlaps in existing environmental policies, laws, and regulations. Local regulations are not fully \nenforced,  land  tenure  arrangements  are  often  uncertain,  and  land  use  rights  for  rural \ncommunities require reform to promote a long-term perspective. Introducing special legislative \nprovisions  and  supporting  policy  to  enable  rural  citizens  to  participate  in  decision-making \nprocedures for the use and management of the land they use is an important part of this \nprocess. \n \n10.  NHARG has made a start in addressing some of the problems of land degradation (e.g., \nthrough  a  grazing  ban  and  urban  water  conservation  measures),  and  now  plans  a \ncomprehensive integrated ecosystem management (IEM) approach to combat the wider causes \nof past environmental damage, and to ensure that future resource use is sustainable. This is \nsupported by the preparation of a land degradation strategy and action plan, authored by a \nmultisector  NHAR  task  force.  The  strategy  acknowledges  that  the  existing  institutional \narrangements are inadequate for a comprehensive approach.8 The lead group (para. 42) and \nsector specialists who contributed to this work will have a key role in the management and \nintellectual leadership of the Project and in ensuring that the IEM approach is institutionalized in \nthe project area. Zoning of land to align land use with ecosystem capacity; analyses of future \nwater demand to balance urban, rural, and environmental uses; provision of access and free \nsharing between stakeholders of data and information on ecosystem characteristics and trends; \nand multidisciplinary training to develop greater skills and awareness are all needed. Irrigation \nsystem rehabilitation, improved on-farm water delivery and management, reduced agricultural \nrunoff into wetlands, and improved soil quality through the adoption of conservation agriculture \nare changes NHARG will pursue in the project area.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n7  Ningxia OP12-Executing Office. November 2006. Strategy and Action Plan on Combating Land Degradation, p. 38, \nnotes, for instance, that (i) the Soil Conservation Law mainly focuses on water erosion and soil loss, but it cannot \nsolve the other root problems of land degradation in wider aspects concerning soil heath and the environment; and \n(ii) the Law on Desertification Prevention and Control mainly focuses on the actions of vegetation reconstruction to \nsolve the problems of wind erosion, but does not address soil salinity, acid rain, soil pollution, soil fertility \ndegradation, and deterioration of soil biological and physical characters, which must also be addressed for a \ncomprehensive solution. Work is under way to address these issues. \n8  Ningxia OP12-Executing Office (footnote 7). Similar work has been simultaneously prepared in six provinces and/or \nautonomous regions: Gansu, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia Hui, Qinghai, Shaanxi, and Xinjiang Uygur. \n ", "    5 \n11.  Improving rural incomes through agriculture-based livelihoods with greater choices is an \nimportant way to reduce poverty and provide an alternative to current unsustainable practices. \nOf the 450,000 rural residents in the project area, approximately 74,000 have been resettled \nfrom the very poor southern areas of Ningxia in six villages, known as poverty communities. \nLocated on marginal lands between the alluvial soils of the Yellow River and the rocky piedmont \nzone of the Helan Mountains, these villages have a higher vulnerability to poverty than most \nother rural dwellers, with average per capita income of between the equivalent of $0.41 and \n$0.56 per day. Approximately 73% of the population is Hui minority. Their per capita land \navailability and grain production is also lower than average. In some rural areas, a transition has \ncommenced away from low-yielding cereals and grazing using traditional practices to higher-\nvalue and more resource-efficient industries with lower water demand such as vineyards and \nwine making, dairy, halal meat products, medicinal herbs, other perennials, and greenhouse-\nbased horticulture. The market analysis in Supplementary Appendix A shows trends toward \nincreasing consumption of these goods in general, and in niche markets for some of Ningxia\u2019s \nproducts in particular (e.g., halal market). Commercial enterprises are leading this transition, \nwith processing, marketing, and export experience. The most prominent is the Ningxia State \nFarm Group (NSFG), which either employs or has commercial links with approximately 45% of \nthe rural population.9 NSFG and several other state-owned enterprises have the capacity to \nexpand their operations, and offer a range of market-oriented services and opportunities to the \nrural community, including the rural poor.  \n \n12.  The cultural, aesthetic, and wildlife habitat values of the ecosystems in the project area, \nwhich offer significant benefits if well protected, have eroded over time. In the past, wetlands \nwere  filled  in  to  support  agriculture  and  urban  growth;  on  the  remaining  water  bodies, \ncommercial exploitation took priority over conservation, threatening wildlife, and weakening vital \necosystem functions. These and other tourist venues have not attracted significant numbers of \nvisitors nor has tourism expanded strongly compared with neighboring provinces due to the \nlower quality of the tourism experience offered. Linking commercial enterprises owned by NSFG \nand  Yinchuan  Municipality  with  conservation  objectives  offers  a  good  opportunity  to  inject \nfinance to protect assets of significant value, and to diversify the livelihoods of rural people. \n \n13.  Government Policies and Plans. The Government\u2019s development program is set out in \nthe PRC\u2019s 11th FYP (2006\u25002010). It aims to develop a harmonious society through a science-\nbased and people-centered development approach and continued economic reforms. The plan \nincludes  emphasis  on  resource  conservation,  environmental  protection,  cleaner  production \nsystems, and increased reliance on ecosystem rehabilitation processes. The western region will \nreceive continued attention to address poverty and regional economic imbalances. \n \n14.  ADB Country Partnership Strategy. ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy (2008\u25002010) \nemphasizes continued support to poorer provinces and integrated rural development, and the \nPRC\u2019s contribution to protecting regional and global public goods.10 The Project supports ADB\u2019s \nstrategic concerns to improve the environment and promote balanced and inclusive growth, as \nset out in the strategy. Project activities are aimed at promoting sustainable rural development \nwith an emphasis on managing ecosystems and addressing rural poverty through livelihood \nprograms.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n9  NSFG, a part of the Ningxia Agricultural Reclamation Bureau, occupies 78,957 hectares on 9 sites, or about 22% of \nthe project area.  \n10  ADB. 2008.

To address concerns about the performance of its own programs, \nand to gain from international experience, the Government entered a strategic partnership with \nGEF  and  other  international  partners  to  develop  and  increase  comprehensive  resource \nmanagement  approaches  that  integrate  the  ecological,  economic,  regulatory,  and  social \ndimensions of the land degradation problem. Land degradation severely endangers the PRC\u2019s \nrich  biodiversity,  especially  through  human  activities,  many  of  which  are  illegal  or  poorly \nmanaged  under  the  law  and  destroy  natural  habitats,  especially  through  land  conversion, \nindustrialization, poor management of water resources, and deforestation. ADB\u2019s first project \nunder the PRC\u2013GEF Partnership on Land Degradation in Dryland Ecosystems, the Capacity \nBuilding to Combat Land Degradation Project,11 is ongoing in six provinces and/or autonomous \nregions: Gansu, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia Hui, Qinghai, Shaanxi, and Xinjiang Uygur. In Ningxia, \na multiagency task force prepared a provincial strategy and action plan for land degradation \ncontrol using an IEM approach. In addition, a smaller legal, institutional, and policy review team \nassessed requirements of the legal and policy environment; its findings are incorporated in the \nstrategy.12 Appendix 2 provides details of the IEM approach, and its use internationally and in \nthe Project.  \n \n16.  In addition, the World Bank financed nine projects in education, health, infrastructure, \nand rural development; International Fund for Agricultural Development supported environment \nand  rural  development  projects;  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  supported  three \nprojects for communications, forestry, and education; United Nations Children\u2019s Fund supported \nprojects for a range of social welfare improvements; United Nations Development Programme \nsupported projects for agriculture and water resources; and World Food Programme supported \nfour projects (Appendix 3). \n \n17.  Lessons. ADB\u2019s agriculture, environment, and natural resource development projects in \ngeneral,  and  especially  in  the  PRC,  indicate  the  need  for  stakeholder  involvement  and \ncommunity participation in planning and implementation, as well as close coordination among \nimplementing agencies and the private sector. Combating land degradation in the PRC has \nmostly been through top-down application of sector-by-sector engineering solutions. In the \nNHAR,  the  IEM  strategy  task  force  assessed  this  approach  to  be  expensive  and  lack \nsustainability. Combating land degradation is effective if delivered as part of a comprehensive \npoverty reduction framework, particularly in areas where the causality between degradation of \nfragile  ecosystems  and  poverty  incidence  is evident.  A recent  ADB  evaluation  shows  that \nsuccessful poverty reduction interventions link the poor to economic growth centers, commercial \nvalue-adding enterprises, and associated off-farm employment opportunities.13 To address the \npoverty-environment  nexus,  ADB  recently  suggested  that  interventions  to  improve  the \nproductivity of land and other natural resources through irrigation, better management of water, \nand  other  environment-related  interventions  would  impact  significantly  on  the  poor.  Poor \nfarmers typically work on low productive marginal land caused by insufficient moisture or other \nsoil deficiencies and aggravated by changing climate patterns.14 This closely describes the \nsituation faced by the poverty communities that will be helped by the Project.  \n \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2004.

Based  on  lessons  from  dryland  experience  in  industrial  societies  (e.g.,  Australia, \nCanada, and United States), Africa (e.g., Ethiopia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, and Sudan), PRC, and \nSouth America (e.g., El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua); and the experience of \ndryland research institutions such as the International Center for Agricultural Research in the \nDry Areas and the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics, GEF and \nother development partners including the World Bank and leading bilateral agencies have been \nsupporting the PRC to change its approach to combating land degradation. In these countries, \nfrom the 1930s onward, bottom-up approaches bringing local farmers and/or graziers, scientists, \nbusiness,  and  government  agencies  together  to  solve  local  problems  have  proved  to  be \nsuccessful. Adequate incentives, controls, and financial resources to ensure that environmental \nfunctions and services were rehabilitated and maintained are essential. Large areas that were \nseverely degraded have been rehabilitated and are being used for sustainable agriculture and \nother  purposes,  yielding  higher  output  and  wealth  for  larger  populations  than  in  the  past. \nCommunity organizations, including farmer and water-user associations, and a clear legal and \nregulatory  framework  are  featured.  Market-based  solutions  that  link  rural  populations  with \nprocessors and markets are essential for viable livelihoods. \n \n19.  A major international review of lessons on the functioning of dryland ecosystems and the \nlivelihood  systems  of  residents  concludes  that  an  integrative,  participatory  approach  that \naddresses land degradation, poverty, safeguarding biodiversity, and protecting cultural heritage \noffers a far higher probability of finding sustainable development solutions for the 2.5 billion \nglobal  dryland  residents.15 The  Project  will  adopt  a  holistic  IEM  approach  with  balanced \nemphasis  on  ecosystem  conservation  and  sustainable  rural  livelihoods.  This  requires \ninstitutional capacity for implementation, especially when new concepts and technologies are \nintroduced. Lessons from similar ADB projects are (i) the provincial government should provide \nthe project management office with adequate financial and staff resources to ensure strong \nownership;  (ii)  a  strong  lead  group  is  necessary  to  provide  leadership  and  guidance;  \n(iii)  commercial  projects  should  be  supported  only  if  an  entity  exists  to  financially  and \nmanagerially  back  the  proposal,  and  is  committed  to  promoting  rural  development;  \n(iv) commercial operations should adopt a flexible approach and be sensitive to changes in \nmarket demand and prices; and (v) consultants are required to support institutional capacity \nbuilding of the stakeholders involved, including project management. The Project will exchange \ninformation  with  other  projects  under  the  umbrella  of  the  PRC\u2013GEF  Partnership  on  Land \nDegradation in Dryland Ecosystems.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n20.  The impact of the Project will be improved environmental management to rehabilitate \necosystems  and  increased  rural  incomes  in  the  Yinchuan  area.  An  increased  number  of \nsmallholders and poor rural communities will be linked to enterprises in conservation-oriented \nindustries  to  provide  alternatives  to  current  agricultural  practices  that  are  damaging  to \necosystems.  Farmland  degradation  (e.g.,  soil  quality)  and  wetland  water  quality  will  be \nimproved, and conservation agriculture will be practiced on 35,000 hectares (ha) of farmland. \nThe wildlife conservation area will be approximately 115,360 ha; and wetland conservation will \nbe practiced on 8,825 ha. Visitors to tourism sites will expand to 1.1 million each year. \n \n                                                 \n15 Reynolds, J. et al. 2007.

The Project\u2019s main outcome is to introduce an IEM approach to provide sustainable \nlivelihoods for the population of the project area. In line with successful experience in the PRC \nand internationally, a comprehensive approach to address the multidimensional root causes is \nneeded to effectively address ecosystem degradation. The main targets and indicators are \n(i) demonstration  of  the  IEM  approach  through  policy,  regulatory,  and  institutional  reforms; \n(ii) livelihood  improvement  for  up  to  140,000  smallholder  farmers,  including  six  poor \ncommunities, and increased incomes for 20 enterprises through a transition to higher value and \nmore resource-efficient industries; (iii) reduction of agrochemical and water use per unit of \ncultivated area; (iv) increase in water allocations for nine major lakes and wetland systems, and \nless runoff from agriculture; and (v) protection of 15 globally threatened wild species.  \n \n22.  The Project has four outputs: (i) IEM capacity building and project management, (ii) land \nand  water  resource  management,  (iii)  rural  livelihood  improvement,  and  (iv)  ecosystem \nconservation. \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n1.  IEM Capacity Building and Project Management \n \n23.  Under this output, an integrated approach to ecosystem management will be developed. \nOverall project management and IEM capacity building are needed to institutionalize IEM and \nbring guidance from the lead group (para. 42) representing the stakeholder agencies. \n \n24.  IEM Capacity Building. Three aspects will be covered: \n \n(i)  Policy, legal, and regulatory frameworks.16 To enable implementation of an \nIEM  approach,  the  Project  will  establish  (a)  IEM  principles,  including \ncoordination  and  public  participation;  (b)  water  resource  zoning;  (c)  spatial \nplanning for land and water use regulations according to ecosystem capability; \n(d) creation and management of the Helan piedmont conservation management \narea (HPCMA); (e) control of pesticide and fertilizer usage to reduce nonpoint \nsource  pollution;  (f)  a  water  pricing  mechanism  to  support  water  trading  in \nNingxia; (g) management of wetlands; (h) revenue-sharing arrangements for \nenterprises  operating  cultural  or  tourism  sites;  (i)  contractual  farming \narrangements for smallholder farmers; and (j) legal recognition of rural farmer \nand water-user associations, including contract services. With the assistance of \nspecialist consultants, NHARG staff will prepare the necessary policy papers, \ndraft laws, and regulations for NHARG approval. These provisions will either be \nincorporated in the proposed regulations currently being drafted by NHARG for \nwetland management and the new implementation provisions for the Water Law \n(2002), or incorporated in an IEM policy to be issued by NHARG for the project \narea. The IEM policy will be followed, in the later stages of the Project, by \ncomprehensive IEM regulations that incorporate the main principles of the IEM \npolicy and lessons from project implementation. \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n16 The Project\u2019s work will complement and build from the Ningxia-wide policy and regulatory framework reforms that \ncommenced under the TA for Capacity Building to Combat Land Degradation Project (footnote 11). Improved land \ntenure and water rights arrangements for rural households are among the benefits from the proposed reforms. \n ", "    9 \n(ii)  Training and capacity building. Increased coordination and integration will be \ndeveloped  through  cross-sector  planning  sessions,  and  design  and \nimplementation of an IEM demonstration area. Training and study tours will be \nprovided to build institutional capacity, develop skills, and provide vocational \ntraining in the rural community. Based on a training needs assessment, specialist \nconsultants and qualified training institutions will deliver the training.17 Training \nconsultants  will  develop  short-term  domestic  training  courses  and  materials. \nAwareness building study tours will expose senior and midlevel managers to IEM \nconcepts and applications. Overall, 35 people will be included in study tours over \n4 years. A total of 76 stakeholder representatives will visit various programs and \napproaches throughout the PRC, including other IEM projects.18 \n \n(iii)  Information systems and monitoring. The Project will support development of \nthe  operating  capacity  of  the  NHARG  IEM  information  center.  All  agencies \nrepresented in the provincial project management office (PPMO) and the lead \ngroup will have access to ecosystem-relevant data through a signed data-sharing \nagreement. The public will have free access to the data through a web-based \nportal; 13 agencies signed an agreement to freely exchange data in April 2007. \nThe  ongoing  monitoring  and  evaluation  methods  being  developed  under  the \nCapacity Building to Combat Land Degradation Project will be used. Agreements \nto ensure use and analysis of data from service providers including the Ningxia \nRemote Sensing Center, Land Degradation Data Center, and Ningxia University, \nwill be signed. \n \n25.  Project  Management.  The  PPMO  has  been  established  under  the  Foreign  Debt \nManagement Office within the Ningxia Finance Department (NFD), and will be fully staffed once \nthe  Project  is  approved.  The  PPMO  provides  the  office  for  the  lead  group  and  will  be \nresponsible for overall project implementation including overall planning, coordination of work \nplans, financial management, technical support, stakeholder agency coordination, and reporting. \nIt will be responsible for implementing some project activities including (i) IEM institutional \nstrengthening,  including  preparation  of  the  HPCMA  management  plan;  and  (ii)  IEM \ndemonstration and, through the concerned stakeholder agencies, coordinating arrangements to \ndemonstrate new technologies for land management using conservation agriculture. The Project \nwill provide salaries and operating costs for the PPMO, including sector staff and a group of 10 \ntechnical  experts.  Training  will  be  provided  in  procurement,  financial  management, \ndisbursement, work planning, and reporting.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n17 Training providers will be leading universities and technical, research, and/or extension institutes in the PRC, \nNHAR, and the Asia and Pacific region. A list of training courses has been agreed, including natural resource \nmanagement,  conservation,  economic  valuation  of  resources  and  ecosystems,  market-based  resource \nmanagement,  ecological  development  and  business,  poverty  and  linkages  to  land  degradation,  water  use \nefficiency, land use and spatial planning, ecosystem zoning, management objectives, management regulations, \nconservation agriculture, tourism planning, information and data management systems, natural resource policy, law \nand regulations, contract farming, market chains and value addition, and community and participatory natural \nresource management. \n18 Possible destinations include wetland management and conservation-based tourism (Hong Kong); ecological \nmanagement of land and natural resources (Qinghai); fodder, silage, and livestock production systems (Inner \nMongolia and Heilongjiang); conservation agriculture in dryland agriculture (Beijing district); and the World Bank-\nfinanced Gansu and Xinjiang Pastoral Development Project, and Loess Plateau Watershed Rehabilitation Project. \n ", "10   \n2.  Land and Water Resource Management \n \n26.  Under this output, the Project will establish area planning and build instutional capacity \nto address resource management on an ecosystem basis. Interventions include (i) integrated \nwater  resource  planning  and  spatial  planning;  (ii)  conservation  agriculture  demonstrations, \nfarmer field schools, and fertilizer management demonstrations; and (iii) improvement of water \nresource efficiency for 15,000 farmers. \n \n27.  Integrated  Water  Resource  Management  Plan  (IWRMP)  and  Spatial  Planning. \nNHARG  (through  the  Ningxia  Water  Resource  Department  [NWRD]  and  assisted  by \nconsultants) will prepare an IWRMP within the first 2 years of the Project. This will assist in \nbalancing demand and availability of water (surface and groundwater) and the potential reuse of \nwater, in accordance with a long-term water conservation strategy. The IWRMP will establish \nthe policy and guide water investment. It will be updated as new data becomes available. A \nspatial planning framework will be developed and implemented under the leadership of the \nPPMO,  which  will  work  with  stakeholders  to  define  management  objectives,  management \nzones, environmentally sensitive areas, conservation areas, land use options, and programs \nneeded to achieve these. The process will involve local participation, field assessments, and \ncoordination between sectors. \n \n28.  Conservation  Agriculture  and  Fertilizer  Management  Demonstrations.  \nDemonstrations of conservation agriculture for smallholders will be undertaken at three sites \nincluding crop residue mulching, minimum tillage, crop rotations, and improved pest and plant \nnutrient management.19 Work will build on existing Ningxia Agricultural Reclamation Bureau \n(NARB) demonstrations to increase the adoption of conservation agriculture outside the NSFG \nareas. The Project will train trainers and then work through existing farmer associations and \nrural cooperatives. The farmer associations will have linkages to machinery cooperatives and \nNSFG, to enable smallholders to access the necessary farm equipment. An action research \nprogram will apply site-specific nitrogen management and the economic use of fertilizer within \nthe catchment of Shahu Lake. A nitrogen balance model will be developed to define nitrogen \ncrop  demand,  identify  fertilizer  placement  technologies,  and  introduce  nitrogen  stripping \npractices through reed-bed management. Soil and water testing will be included within an \nintensive monitoring program that involves land users and farmer field schools. \n \n29.  Water Resource Efficiency. The Project will support design and construction of part of \nXixia Canal, including 15.1 km of inverted siphon past the protected area for Xixia tombs,  \n16 km of the main canal, control and monitoring stations, 21.3 km of new secondary canals,  \n118 km of secondary canals to be lined, and lining of 632 km of laterals and on-farm distribution. \nXixia Canal will be extended (31.1 km) to replace the current low-efficiency Xigan Canal, and \nwill  serve  a  15,546  ha  irrigation  area.  The  increased  efficiency  will  enable  water  to  be \ntransferred to the Yinchuan wetlands, plus support livelihood development, including for poor \ncommunities. The current irrigation area will be rehabilitated to ensure efficient water distribution \nthrough  canal  lining,  laser  leveling,  and  conversion  to  gravity-fed  irrigation.  To  strengthen \nirrigation management, the Project will use water scheduling, monitoring, and shorter return \nperiods to reverse overwatering and salinization risks.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n19 The three sites are (i) Zhengshaqu village in Yongning County (for spring corn trials), (ii) Tongchang village in \nHelan County (trials for intercropping of winter wheat and silage), and (iii) Xiaodianzi village of Pingluo County \n(trials for spring wheat and corn). This last site is related to the nitrogen management trials at Shahu Lake. \n ", "    11 \n3.  Rural Livelihood Improvement \n \n30.  The Project will develop and implement sustainable livelihood programs in the project \narea.20 Expanding the role of markets to improve rural incomes in industries that make more \nefficient use of land and water is a vital part of the strategy to reduce ecosystem degradation. \nThrough NARB, Yinchuan Municipality, and Ningxia Administrative Bureau, the Project will \nsupport demonstrations of the Government\u2019s policy of industry supporting rural smallholders and \ncity to support rural as foreshadowed in the new socialist countryside policies of the 11th FYP. \nThe Project will support enterprises that link with smallholder producers and adopt more benign \nland use systems in higher value markets.  \n \n31.  Under NARB, beef, dairy, and higher value horticultural production will be expanded \ninvolving up to 8,325 households: (i) The existing beef herd will be expanded and a halal-\ncertified beef slaughterhouse built. The genetic quality of the central breeding herd will be \nupgraded, and through artificial insemination services, the quality of smallholder animals will be \nimproved, along with a beef finishing feedlot, and smallholder beef breeding and rearing units. \n(ii) The existing dairy herd on Pingjipu State Farm will be split into five herds and the state farm \nwill  provide  cooperative  milking  platforms  with  breeding  and  technical  support  services  to \nprovide  milk  to  an  existing  milk  processing  plant.  All  livestock  operations  will  involve  the \nconversion to perennial fodder production systems requiring less water and soil disturbance.  \n(iii) Up to 670 ha of existing flood-irrigated land will be converted to small contract viniculture to \nsupply a processing facility, and market through the existing local and national distribution \nnetwork.  The  viniculture  will  use  cover  crops  and  water-saving  irrigation  technologies  to \nincrease the sustainability of land use. These enterprises will adopt biogas, biofertilizer, and \nwater-recycling technology. \n \n32.  In Yinchuan Municipality, the Project will address sustainable land management and \npoverty reduction through production systems for up to 9,800 households, including perennial \ncrops. Water and agrochemical use will be reduced compared to current practices. Vocational \nand technical training will be provided for up to 3,000 individuals, including through NHARG\u2019s \nongoing programs. Based on past research into alternative cropping and irrigation systems on \nfragile soils on the margin of the piedmont zone, land currently cropped by poor households will \nbe converted into sustainable systems where crops and soil types are more appropriately \nmatched.21  \n \n33.  Under Ningxia Administrative Bureau\u2019s existing state-owned enterprise, the Project will \nsupport development of a pilot district involving perennial crops such as Chinese dates (jujube) \nand alfalfa along with a beef feedlot, contract fodder, and livestock production systems for \nresettled smallholders in poverty villages. Up to 4,680 households will be involved with intensive \nhousehold production systems for livestock, fodder, passive solar housing, and greenhouse \nproduction. The enterprise will develop its plant propagation business and infrastructure, and \nprovide processing and market distribution services to smallholders. Vocational training will be \nprovided  to  give  local  people  new  skills  to  enable  them  to  better  compete  for  off-farm \nemployment.22 \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n20 The sustainable livelihoods approach of the Department for International Development was used in the design of \nthe Project. \n21 These activities are also called Yinxi alternative livelihoods.  \n22 These activities are also called high technology and ecological agriculture. \n ", "12   \n4.  Ecosystem Conservation  \n \n34.  This output is designed to address the threats of further conversion and degradation of \nhabitat, and promote biodiversity conservation. It covers (i) Shahu and Yuehai lakes, (ii) Helan \nMountains Nature Reserve and its extension into the piedmont zone, (iii) Yinchuan wetlands, \nand (iv) Yinxi wetlands. At these sites, commercial tourism will be balanced with ecosystem \nconservation, habitats for wild species, and preservation of cultural heritage sites and values.  \n \n35.  The incorporation of conservation values will enable future sustainable use and build \npublic  awareness  of  wetland  functions,  conservation,  and  habitats.  On  NSFG-managed \nwetlands at Shahu Lake, activities will cover revegetation, galleries, viewing platforms to see \nwild birds, aquaculture, and tourist accommodation with wastewater treatment and a scientific \neducation center. At Yuehai Lake, activities will include aquatic plants for commercial use, a \nprocessing  plant  for  aquatic  vegetarian  food,  ecological  rehabilitation,  water  supply  and/or \nheating, and regreening of wetland landscapes. \n \n36.  On  three  sites  managed  by  Yinchuan  Municipality,  conservation  values  will  be \nincorporated  into  commercial  tourism  to  rehabilitate  and  protect  ecosystem  services  and \nfunctions, protect wildlife, and enhance the quality of tourism experiences: (i) An extended \nconservation management zone that unifies the current Helan Mountains Nature Reserve with \n53,150 ha of the piedmont zone will be set up as the HPCMA and managed for a biodiversity \nhabitat. Fencing and patrolling west of the new Xixia Canal will prevent illegal grazing, antiquity \ncollection, and poachers. An IEM ecological restoration demonstration center and support for \nbiodiversity conservation will emphasize the management of local endangered species and \ntourism  impacts.  An  integrated  ecotourism  management  plan  will  be  prepared.  (ii)  At  the \nYinchuan  wetlands,  management  planning  and  monitoring  will  be  accompanied  with \nrehabilitation of vegetation and management of wetland parks for recreation and sustainable \nuse  of  wetland  resources.  The  current  public  awareness  programs  will  be  upgraded  and \ninvestments made in water quality management, including water treatment. The Project will \nsupport the existing Mingcui training center to build capacity of staff of wetland management \nagencies. (iii) At the Yinxi wetlands, a program to conserve wildlife habitats and improve the \nquality of the wetlands will be introduced including restoration of 8,000 ha of natural grassland \nand protection of linked wetlands on each side of Xigan Canal with waterfowl habitat. \n \n5.  GEF-Financed Project Activities  \n \n37.  GEF joint cofinancing will support a multifocal approach to conserving biodiversity and \ncombating land degradation.23 The GEF-financed activities will ensure that the IEM approach is \nfollowed  to  contribute  to  restoring  the  productive  and  protective  functions  of  ecosystem \nresources. An IEM approach will be followed for the protection of resident and migratory species \nand their grassland and wetland habitats; as well as for building the institutional and regulatory \ncapacity to rehabilitate, sustainably manage, and protect the ecosystems. GEF will finance \ncomplementary  activities  in  each  of  the  four  outputs  to  ensure  that  incremental  global \nenvironmental benefits above the baseline investment are achieved. For output 1, GEF will \n                                                 \n23 GEF operations programs 1, 2, 3, and 4 cover biodiversity conservation in arid and semi-arid regions, freshwater \necosystems, forest ecosystems, and mountain ecosystems; whereas operations program 15 covers sustainable \nland management. Combined, these programs will support an IEM approach under the Project. Following changes \nin GEF\u2019s financial arrangements, OP12 for IEM no longer provides project financing. The GEF project proposal was \nconsidered  at  the  intercessional  council  meeting  in  July  2007.  However,  following  the  deletion  of  the \nsubcomponents relating to Xixia Tombs, Helankou Rock Drawings, and Jiangjun House, which involved a revision \nof GEF\u2019s financing for the Project, the proposal was resubmitted to the GEF Council in March 2008, and its \napproval was obtained on 25 July 2008. \n ", "    13 \nsupport institutional reform and capacity strengthening, reflecting the demonstration value to the \nNHAR and the PRC. GEF will support equipment costs and training for project management \nand consulting services related to the introduction of improved natural resource management, \nconservation  agriculture,  wildlife  conservation,  study  tours,  and  international  and  national \npostgraduate  studies.  For  output  2,  GEF  will  finance  the  IWRMP  and  spatial  planning \nprocesses, conservation agriculture demonstration sites, farmer training program, and fertilizer \nmanagement  demonstrations  reflecting  the  impact  this  is  expected  to  have  on  aquatic \nbiodiversity, wetland habitat functions, and migratory wildlife. For output 3, GEF will support \ntraining  of  local  communities  in  appropriate  land  use  technologies,  vocational  training, \nintegrated planning systems, and development of conservation and public education programs. \nFor output 4, GEF will support the establishment of the HPCMA and the capacity of staff to \nmanage endangered species; biodiversity habitat protection and restoration planting programs \nfor  the  Yinxi  wetlands;  and  biodiversity  conservation  management  programs  including \nprotection, bird observation hides and boundary demarcation, and wetland training programs. \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n38.  The  Project  is  under  the  PRC\u2013GEF  Partnership  on  Land  Degradation  in  Dryland \nEcosystems (footnote 6). It is governed by a country programming framework approved by the \nGEF Council at its Beijing meeting in October 2002. The framework covers a programmatic \napproach over 10 years (2003\u20132012) and seeks to combat land degradation, reduce poverty, \nand conserve biodiversity through capacity-building investments and development of viable \nmodel IEM demonstration investment projects.24 As a comprehensive demonstration investment \nunder the PRC\u2013GEF partnership, the Project is linked to a network in the PRC, involving 11 \ngovernment agencies; six provinces and/or regions; policy, legal, regulatory, and institutional \nreforms; participatory processes; and development partner cooperation. It is part of a planned \nlong-term programmatic approach, and will provide and gain feedback and information from \nother parts of the PRC. The IEM approach is well grounded in international experience of \nsuccessful dryland rehabilitation and in some bilateral assistance projects in the PRC. It is \nhighly relevant to the new socialist countryside policies for rural regeneration under the 11th \nFYP. The ongoing Capacity Building to Combat Land Degradation Project has sensitized the \nGovernment  to  IEM.  The  proceedings  of  an  international  workshop  on  IEM  endorsed  this \napproach for the PRC,25 and the case for integrative approaches for the world\u2019s drylands is \nstrongly supported by a recent scientific review of worldwide evidence from the 1930s onward \n(footnote 15).  \n \n39.  The project area includes 68% of the vertebrate species and 42% of vascular plants in \nthe NHAR, with the alluvial plain of the Yellow River system being its most important zone. \nFifteen globally threatened species exist, of which nine are permanent residents and six are \nmigratory birds. GEF will support the protection of these globally threatened species and their \nhabitats, and build institutional capacity to rehabilitate and sustainably manage the ecosystems \nin the project area.  \n \n                                                 \n24 The initial focus (2003\u20132005) was on six provinces and/or autonomous regions in the western region that are \nnational priority areas and of global significance for land degradation control and biodiversity preservation: Gansu, \nInner Mongolia, Ningxia Hui, Qinghai, Shaanxi, and Xinjiang Uygur with a population of about 120 million. Eleven \ncentral government agencies are involved: Legislative Office of the State Council, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of \nFinance, Ministry of Land and Resources, Ministry of Science and Technology, Ministry of Water Resources, \nNational  Development  and  Reform  Commission,  Poverty  Alleviation  Office  of  the  State  Council,  State \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, State Forestry Administration, and Working Committee for Legislation of the \nNational People\u2019s Congress. During 2006\u25002012, the entire western region will be eligible. \n25 Jiang, Z. 2006. Integrated Ecosystem Management: Proceedings of an International Workshop.

Financing Plan \n \n41.  The Government has requested a loan of $100,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a term of 25 years, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and \nsuch other terms and conditions as set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements. The \nGovernment has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking \nthat these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on any advice or \ncommunication from ADB. In addition to the ADB loan, which will finance 45.2% of total costs, a \ngrant of $4,545,000 from GEF will finance 2.0% of project costs. The Borrower of the loan will \nbe the PRC. The ADB loan proceeds will be made available to NHARG, which will onlend part \nof the loan proceeds to NARB and the Yinchuan municipal government (subborrowers). The \nonlending will be on the same financial terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan, with \nNHARG and the subborrowers bearing the exchange rate and interest rate variation risks, and \nperforming the obligations applicable in the Project Agreement, which will be made an integral \npart of the onlending agreements. The financing plan in Table 2 provides details of the project \nimplementing  agencies  (PIAs),  including  the  subborrowers,  which  will  be  responsible  for \nproviding the counterpart funds for the Project. \n \n \n                                                 \n26 The final amounts of the ADB loan and GEF grant were agreed following appraisal in 2007.  \n ", "    15 \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Total  % \nA.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n42.  NHARG,  acting  through  NFD,  will  be  the  executing  agency  responsible  for  overall \nimplementation of the Project. NFD has already formed the lead group, which will ensure \ncoordination across sectors and provide an important decision-making role for key project plans, \nstrategic decisions, and policy issues. NFD has also established the PPMO and assigned core \noffice staff members. The project organization chart is in Appendix 5. NFD will ensure that the \nPPMO is provided with an adequate number of full-time staff members and be the coordinating \npoint for project implementation. Development of IEM capacity will be undertaken through the \nPPMO, which was formed to provide coordination and leadership in IEM approaches, and will \ninvolve  all  stakeholder  agencies.  ADB  will  provide  training  on  project  administration  and \nfamiliarization with ADB\u2019s policies and procedures.  \n \n43.  The  PIAs,  including  Ningxia  Administrative  Bureau,  NARB,  NWRD,  and  Yinchuan \nMunicipality, will be the coordinating bodies for implementation as each will use a range of \nstate-owned  enterprises,  and  state-sponsored  and  public  sector  bureaus  as  project \nimplementation units (PIUs) to implement the subprojects. Twelve PIUs, as well as the PPMO, \nwill implement the 23 subprojects. The implementation capacity of the PIUs was assessed. \n \n  2.  Implementation Period \n \n44.  The Project will be implemented over 6 years from November 2008 to October 2014. \nThe project implementation schedule is in Appendix 6.  \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n45.  Goods, related services, and civil works financed partly or wholly by ADB and GEF will \nbe procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to \ntime) and the procurement plan described in Appendix 7, which will be reviewed and updated on \nan annual basis. Contract packages for goods and related services exceeding $1,000,000 will \nbe awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding or limited international bidding, \nwhile  those  costing  between  $100,000  and  $1  million  will  be  awarded  through  national \ncompetitive bidding. Contracts below $100,000 will be procured through shopping. For contracts \nbelow  $10,000,  direct  contracting  can  be  used.  Civil  works  contracts  costing  more  than  \n ", "16   \n$10 million will be procured using international competitive bidding, while those valued at the \nequivalent of $10 million or less can be procured using national competitive bidding procedures \nacceptable to ADB. Small-scale works and contracts in rural areas may be awarded using \ncommunity participation procedures. The selection of suppliers and/or contractors and award of \ncontracts will be subject to ADB approval.27 The relevant sections of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) will be included in all procurement documents and contracts. A \nprocurement plan setting out an indicative list of all procurement packages and the procurement \nmethods is provided in Appendix 7.  \n \n46.  Three  PPMO  staff  will  be  assigned  procurement  management  activities,  including \nmonitoring of the procurement plan and coordinating procurement activities under the Project. \nMeasures to strengthen the capacity of PPMO staff in undertaking procurement activities will be \nimplemented, including the engagement of project management consultants, financed by the \nGEF grant, to provide training on procurement and other aspects of project implementation. \nPPMO staff will be nominated to attend ADB-sponsored courses and seminars on procurement \nand project implementation. NFD will appoint a procurement agent to help with procurement and \nto ensure compliance with ADB policies and procedures, on terms and conditions satisfactory to \nADB. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n47.  The Project will finance three consulting packages. Package A, financed by the GEF \ngrant, will comprise 4 international and 7 national person-months of individual consultants to \nstrengthen the project management capabilities of the PPMO. ADB will be responsible for the \nselection with concurrence of NHARG and the PPMO for contract negotiations and contract \nmanagement.  Package  B,  financed  under  the  GEF  grant,  will  comprise  a  team  of  12 \ninternational and 77 national person-months to provide technical specialists. In selecting the \nfirm, the quality- and cost-based selection method, with a quality-cost weighing of 80:20, will be \nused and short-listed firms will be required to submit simplified technical proposals. The PPMO \nwill be responsible for the selection, contract negotiations, and contract management. Package \nC, financed under the loan, will comprise 11 international and 16 national person-months of \nindividual consulting services in the field of water resource management to be financed directly \nfrom the loan. Individual consultant selection will be applied. The PPMO will be responsible for \nthe selection, contract negotiations, and contract management. A summary of all consulting \npackages is included in Appendix 8 while detailed terms of reference for consulting services are \nin  Supplementary  Appendix  C.  All  recruitment  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n \n5.  Advance Procurement and Retroactive Financing  \n \n48.  NHARG requested and ADB approved a provision for advance contracting for consulting \nservices. NHARG also requested retroactive financing for civil works, equipment, and services; \nsetting  out the  details in  a  written  request  to  ADB.  ADB  advised  NHARG  that  retroactive \nfinancing could only apply to up to 20% of the ADB loan in respect of expenditures incurred not \nearlier  than  12  months  before  the  signing  of  the  Loan  Agreement.  Further,  all  contracts \nproposed for retroactive financing will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines. Advance action will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants and Procurement Guidelines. The Government and NHARG were advised that \n                                                 \n27 ADB will require the PPMO to use ADB-approved standard bidding documents to ensure high quality and \nconsistency, and to facilitate ADB review. This is reflected in the project administration memorandum. \n ", "    17 \napproval of the advance action and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the \nProject.  \n \n6.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n49.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  NHARG,  NFD,  and  the  PIAs.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB and GEF in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of \nADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the executing agency; PIAs; and all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. The \nproject design and implementation arrangements provide for mitigating corruption risks. Risks \nassociated with project management, including procurement and disbursement, will be mitigated \nby (i) engaging an international consultant and a national consultant to advise and assist in \nprocuring goods and services, and engaging other consultants; (ii) introducing a dual signing \nsystem  requiring  the  civil  works  contractor  awarded  the  contract  to  sign  an  anticorruption \ncontract  with  the  employer;  and  (iii)  requiring  periodic  inspection  by  the  PPMO  of  the \ncontractor\u2019s activities related to fund withdrawals and settlements. \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n50.  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). Since many of the payments will be made for \nlarge contracts, direct payment, reimbursement, and commitment procedures will be used to \nwithdraw funds from the loan account. To expedite the flow of funds and simplify document \nprocessing,  the  statement  of  expenditure  procedure  may  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible \nexpenditures for any individual payment not exceeding $100,000. The payments exceeding the \nstatement of expenditure ceiling will be reimbursed based on a full documentation process. \nBefore  disbursement  for  any  activity,  the  Government  will  have  certified  to  ADB  that  the \nonlending agreement, which will include the terms and conditions required under the Loan \nAgreement, has been duly executed and delivered on behalf of NHARG and the subborrowers, \nand is fully effective and binding upon the parties in accordance with its terms. GEF grant funds \nwill be channeled through ADB. To expedite the disbursement of the loan and GEF grant \nproceeds, the Government will set up two imprest accounts, one for the loan proceeds and one \nfor the GEF grant, in a commercial bank acceptable to ADB. Disbursements from the imprest \naccounts will be supported by an appropriate withdrawal application and related documentation. \nThe initial amounts to be deposited in each imprest account will not exceed the estimated \nexpenditures for the next 6 months or 10%, respectively, of the loan amount and GEF grant, \nwhichever is lower.  \n \n51.  The  PPMO  requires  additional  capacity  and  experience  to  deal  efficiently  with  the \noperation and withdrawal procedures necessary for the operation of the imprest accounts. \nAccordingly, assistance and training will be provided so that PPMO staff can expedite loan and \nGEF grant disbursements. An assessment of the financial management capability of NFD and \nthe  PIAs  and  the  specific  arrangements  for  managing  the  project  funds  are  provided  in \nSupplementary Appendix D. \n \n \n \n ", "18   \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n52.  All agencies involved in project implementation will maintain records and accounts that \nidentify  goods  and  services  from  loan  proceeds  and  the  GEF  grant,  financing  resources \nreceived, expenditures incurred, and use of local funds. These records and accounts will be \nestablished and maintained in accordance with sound accounting principles and internationally \naccepted accounting standards, and with the PRC\u2019s Accounting Law. The PPMO will review and \nconsolidate  these  accounts  and  have  them  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  sound \naccounting practices by the sovereign audit agency of NHARG or other auditors acceptable to \nADB. The audits will be carried out in accordance with the regulations for auditing approved by \nthe State Council and ADB. The audit report will include a statement verifying whether or not the \nfunds disbursed by ADB were used for the purposes for which they were provided, as well as a \nseparate auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of the imprest account and statement of expenditures \nprocedures. The PPMO will submit copies of the audited accounts and auditor\u2019s report to ADB \nwithin 6 months after the end of each financial year. The PPMO will prepare consolidated \nsemiannual reports indicating progress made, problems encountered during the period, steps \ntaken  or  proposed  to  remedy  the  problems,  proposed  program  of  activities,  and  progress \nexpected for the next 6 months. Both the loan and GEF grant will be covered in these reports. \nWithin 6 months of physical completion of the Project, the PPMO will submit a completion report \nto ADB describing achievements in relation to the Project\u2019s expected impact, outcome, and \noutputs.  \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n53.  To monitor the progress of the Project in achieving the expected outcome and outputs, \nthe PPMO will establish and maintain a project performance management system (PPMS) \ndesigned  to  permit  adequate  flexibility  to  adopt  remedial  action  regarding  project  design, \nschedules, activities, and development impacts. The PPMS will adopt the following agreed \nindicators (i) project progress, (ii) enabled framework improvements (harmonization of policies \nand  regulations,  and  clear  institutional  mandates),  (iii)  results  of  capacity  development,  \n(iv) IEM capacity-building performance, (v) progress toward demonstration and field targets,  \n(vi)  environment  improvements,  and  (vii)  related  social  impacts  of  the  Project.  At  project \ninception, the PPMO, in consultation with each subborrower and with the assistance of the \nconsultants, will develop comprehensive PPMS procedures to establish baseline values and \nsystematically  generate  data  on  inputs  and  outputs  of  the  project  activities;  and  the \nsocioeconomic, agricultural, and environmental indicators to measure project impacts.  \n \n54.  The  PPMO  will  refine  the  PPMS  framework,  confirm  achievable  targets,  firm  up \nmonitoring and recording arrangements, and establish systems and procedures no later than  \n6 months after commencing project implementation. The PIAs will report baseline and progress \ndata  at  the  requisite  time  intervals  to  the  PPMO,  including  annual  reporting  on  the \nenvironmental  management  plan  (EMP).  The  PPMO  will  be  responsible  for  analyzing  and \nconsolidating the reported data through its management information system, and reporting the \noutcome to ADB through semiannual progress reports.  \n \n10.  Project Review \n \n55.  In addition to regular monitoring reports, project performance will be reviewed twice per \nyear for the first 3 years and once a year thereafter, jointly by ADB and NHARG. The review will \n(i) assess implementation performance and achievement of progress toward project outcomes \nand outputs, and financial progress, (ii) identify issues and constraints affecting implementation, \nand (iii) work out a time-bound action plan for their resolution. ADB and the Government will \n ", "    19 \nundertake a midterm review to assess implementation status and take appropriate measures \nincluding modification of scope and implementation arrangements, and reallocation of loan and \ngrant proceeds, as appropriate, to achieve the Project\u2019s expected impact.  \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Benefits and Impacts \n \n56.  The Project\u2019s strategy for achieving benefits and impacts has four aspects: (i) building on \nthe success of commercial and state-owned enterprises (mostly within the NSFG group) and \ntheir links to local, national, and international markets and supply chains; (ii) investment and \ninstitutional links between these enterprises and poor and marginalized smallholders who do not \nhave market opportunities and whose basic needs result in degradation of the environment;  \n(iii) support for programs that provide skills for the rural labor force thus enabling surplus labor \nto move into nonfarm work; and (iv) development of plans and institutions to support the \ntransition  from  a  predominantly  rural  society  to  an  urban  and  industrial  society,  and  the \nchanging demands on land and ecological services. The transition from traditional low-yielding \nand  polluting  agricultural  practices  used  to  produce  grains  to  cleaner  and  more  resource-\nefficient industries such as greenhouse-based horticulture, vineyards and winemaking, other \nperennial crops; livestock products; and medicinal herbs for higher-value and export markets \nhas  already  begun,  as  has  tourism.  The  Project  will  support  this  transition.  Conservation \nagriculture has commenced and will be significantly expanded under the Project. NHARG is \nkeen to use the Project to demonstrate that the environment can be rehabilitated in ways that \nwill bring income benefits to rural people and ensure the effective conservation of ecosystem \nservices,  functions,  and  values  for  future  generations.  The  Project\u2019s  water  resources  and \nlivelihood improvement components will directly benefit some 10% of the land and up to an \nestimated 46,400 households or 32% of the rural population in the project area. Improved \nprotection and conservation management and conservation agriculture will be practiced on \n35,000 ha of farmland, in the Helan Nature Reserve, and on 124,185 ha of wetlands and wildlife \nconservation areas. \n \n57.  The Project will have a positive impact on rural livelihoods through added income to \nindividual rural households from increased annual production of milk (23,800 tons); beef (6,760 \ntons); wine (5,000 tons); Chinese dates (14,000 tons); wolfberry (2,250 tons); grapes and other \nfruits (more than 30,000 tons); fodder (48,000 tons); and production of vegetables, mushrooms, \nmedicinal  herbs,  and  cut  flowers.  Rural  households  and  the  previously  resettled  poor \ncommunities will gain production and supply contracts, with greater certainty of land tenure and \nirrigation services through contracts with enterprises in the case of beef, dairy, perennial crops, \nand ecological agriculture. \n \n58.  Project activities will enhance the environment and improve the habitats of Shahu Lake, \nYuehai Lake, and Yinchuan City wetlands; and lead to increased visitor numbers and revenues. \nBiodiversity conservation benefits will accrue through restored habitat and protection for wild \nplants  and  animals,  including  15  globally  threatened  species  of  birds,  mammals,  and  the \nChinese softshell turtle.  \n \n1.  Financial Analysis \n59.  Separate  financial  analysis  was  carried  out  for  11  activities.  For  the  remaining  12 \nactivities, costs were estimated but direct benefits were not quantified. Financial indicators were \nestimated for 10 activities, with financial internal rates of return above the weighted average \n ", "20   \ncost of capital calculated for 9 of them. This indicated their financial viability.28 The financial \ninternal rate of return for the Yinchuan City wetlands was only 0.7%, but this is regarded as a \nvaluable public good by Yinchuan Municipality, which will provide financial subsidies to ensure \nsustainability. No financial internal rate of return was estimated for the overall Project. \n \n60.  Rural livelihood improvement will significantly impact the incomes of most participating \nhouseholds.  A  range  of  activities  is  included  to  increase  household  incomes  by  between \nCNY2,537 and CNY37,200 per year.29 About 10,000 of households expected to participate in \nthe Project are currently classified as poor and additional income from project-related activities \nis expected to raise these households out of poverty. Estimated household incremental incomes \nare above the poverty line (CNY1,000 per capita per year in Yinchuan Municipality); these \nexclude beef production, which is a secondary activity in household farming and so does not \nrepresent the full household income. Details on the financial analyses are in Appendix 9.  \n \n2.  Economic Analysis \n61.  Economic analysis was carried out for 10 activities and the Project. Six are concerned \nwith agricultural production, with benefits primarily in the form of increased crop or livestock \noutputs, and five are wetlands or cultural sites for which measurable benefits are increases in \nvisitor numbers and tourism-related revenues. Benefit estimates are based on data capturing \nthe current situation and on conservative assessments of future scenarios with the Project in \nplace. With- and without-project scenarios are identified. In the project scenarios, particularly for \nagriculture, ongoing damaging practices that lead to ecosystem degradation mean that current \nproduction will likely only be maintained with increasing inputs and costs in the future. Declining \nreturns are likely in the absence of the Project, but these are not included in the without-project \nassumptions. This suggests that for agriculture, project benefits are likely to be underestimated. \nIn addition to the quantified benefits included in the project financial and economic analyses, \nenvironmental, ecosystem, cultural, and heritage benefits will be generated. \n \n62.  The economic internal rate of return for the whole Project, including all 23 activities, is \nestimated at 14.4% and the net present value at CNY201.4 million. The economic internal rates \nof return for the 10 activities for agriculture and wetlands vary widely, although most are in the \nrange of 13\u201317%. The highest economic internal rates of return are for horticultural viniculture \n(44.5%) and Yuehai Lake (40.3%) subprojects. Yinxi alternative livelihood is 11.3%, but has the \ngreatest poverty reduction impact so is justifiable on that basis. The Yinchuan City wetlands \ninvestment is justified on the basis of environmental protection benefits, including its role in \nsupporting a unique and permanent collection of indigenous plants in the botanical garden. \nDetails on the economic analyses are in Appendix 9. \n \n3.  Sustainability \n63.  The Project\u2019s overall sustainability will be assisted by investments to either generate \nlarge  revenue  streams  to  support  ongoing  operations  or  count  on  the  support of  NHARG \nagencies  that  are  strongly  committed  to  project  success  should  revenue  shortfalls  occur. \nOngoing fiscal implications for NHARG will be limited. Thirty-five percent of project investments \nwill be made by experienced commercial enterprises that are fully responsible for the financial \noperation of the investment. NWRD will fund 18% of investments in the water resource area \nusing water fees to cover ongoing operation and maintenance costs. Yinxi alternative livelihoods \naccounts for 26% of project investments and will incur low ongoing costs since new crops \nestablished under the Project will be operated by individual households.  \n                                                 \n28 The weighted average cost of capital is 4.0%.  \n29 These estimates assume no opportunity cost for household labor applied in project-related activities. \n ", "    21 \nB.  Social and Environmental Dimensions \n \n1.  Social Benefits and Poverty \n \n64.  The Project targets rural poor communities and large numbers of rural smallholders in an \nethnic minority region. Of the 74,000 previously resettled people from the very poor southern \narea of Ningxia, approximately 73% are Hui Muslims. They reside in four of six resettlement \ntownships:  Liangtian,  Mingning,  Naliangtaizi,  and  Xingjing.  From  the  livelihood  survey \ncompleted  during  the  TA  (footnote  1),  the  communities  are  poor  and  have  low  economic \ndevelopment due to low education, especially among women; access to poor quality land with \nhigh irrigation costs; and heavy reliance on off-farm income. Project design has specifically \nincluded contract farming, processing, and alternative livelihoods through links with enterprises, \nvocational and technical training, and increased irrigation efficiency measures to benefit these \ncommunities. A gender plan described in Appendix 10 will be developed during implementation. \nNo negative impacts are anticipated for Hui people.  \n \n65.  Overall, up to an estimated 46,400 households will benefit, with the majority of these Hui \nfrom previously resettled poor communities, including up to 5,200 individuals who will benefit \nfrom employment. The Project will train approximately 2,200 individuals in technical subjects, \n5,500 farmers in field schools and a demonstration program on conservation agriculture, and \nsome 3,000 rural poor in vocational training through which additional livelihood options will \ndevelop. Adverse consequences are minor and come from land acquisition for the Project. \nThese will be mitigated by compensation payments and provision of replacement houses, if \nnecessary, as per a resettlement plan that will be updated in the final design. Demonstration of \nnew  conservation  agriculture  approaches  to  land  use  management  will  improve  water-use \nefficiency; while integrated pest and nutrient management will aid beneficiaries\u2019 integration into \nhigher-value  market  chains  and  enable  households  to  attain  higher  incomes,  reduce \nvulnerability, and increase their participation in rural decision making. Project-related human \ncapital investments for rural households provided as skills and vocational training will support \nthe orderly movement of labor into off-farm employment. \n \n2.  Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement \n \n66.  For  the  construction  of  Xixia  Canal,  compensation  will  be  paid  for  (i)  permanent \nacquisition of 18 ha of orchards and irrigated farmland, and 246.7 ha of woodland, grassland, \nand wasteland; and (ii) temporary acquisition of 9.3 ha, including 0.5 ha of orchards. For the \nirrigation rehabilitation, 34 ha will be temporarily acquired during construction. The owners will \nbe compensated and these lands will be restored and returned to owners once construction is \ncomplete. A short resettlement plan was prepared, endorsed by the PPMO, and posted on \nADB\u2019s website, covering all the temporary or permanent impacts; it has been disclosed to those \naffected. About 770 households (approximately 3,260 people) will be impacted to a very limited \nextent. The impacts will be confirmed once final project design is completed. The resettlement \nplan will be updated and disclosed to those affected and submitted to ADB for approval prior to \naward of civil works contracts. Compensation payments and cost-based entitlements will be a \nprecondition for the commencement of civil works. The estimated cost of resettlement is $2.6 \nmillion  equivalent,  including  contingencies.  The  Project  includes  provision  for  external \nresettlement  monitoring  and  reporting.  In  addition,  the  PPMO  will  report  to  ADB  on  land \nacquisition and  resettlement  issues  each  quarter  and  at  project  completion. The  summary \nresettlement plan is included in Appendix 11. \n \n \n \n ", "22   \n3.  Environmental Impact \n \n67.  The project investments have a range of positive impacts on the environment through \nchanges in land, water, wetlands, and conservation management practices. The Project is \ncategorized as environment category A, following the realignment of the Xixia Canal extension \nto bypass Xixia tombs within the priority protection area of the tombs. Environmental impacts \nare  addressed  by  10  initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs),  one  environmental  impact \nassessment (EIA), and a consolidated summary EIA (posted on ADB\u2019s website on 28 May \n2007), including a consolidated EMP. The aesthetics of Xixia tombs will be protected through \nthe use of an inverted siphon. Key environmental issues relate to wastewater from agricultural \nprocessing and livestock enterprises, which will be addressed through water treatment and \nprocessing, particularly animal waste treatment using biodigesters and biofertilizer treatments. \nProject environmental assessments provide strategies to avoid, manage, and mitigate adverse \nimpacts, and recommend monitoring to be undertaken during implementation. The PPMO will \nreport on the findings of the monitoring programs semiannually. Final detailed designs will be \nsubject to final IEE and EIA scrutiny, and will be reported to ADB for its concurrence and \napproval. \n \nC.  Risks \n68.  The Project will adopt an integrated approach to address land degradation and related \nissues, and to plan and implement project activities. In the past, sector-specific approaches to \nland degradation have generally been unsuccessful. For the project impact and outcomes, risks \ninclude (i) the IEM approach may be ineffective as Yinchuan City and NHARG\u2019s economic \ngrowth  ambitions  overwhelm  a  reasonable  balance  between  growth  and  environmental \nrehabilitation and protection, leading to further ecosystem deterioration; and (ii) climate change \nreduces  available  water  resources,  especially  from  the  Yellow  River.  These  risks  can  be \nmitigated in part by planning, monitoring, and enforcing appropriate policies and regulations. \nMeasures that reduce water use per unit of agricultural production are especially valuable and \nare supported by the Project. Raising stakeholder awareness and incorporating conservation \nvalues  into  land-use  planning,  farming  practices,  and  wetland  management  are  essential. \nLeaders acting as high-profile champions who advocate appropriate policy settings are also \nimportant.  Other  risks  facing  project  management  and  implementation  include  (i)  lack  of \nfamiliarity with ADB policies and procedures, (ii) changes in PPMO personnel, (iii) bureaucratic \nand lengthy procurement decision making, (iv) inadequate management capacity compounding \ndelays, and (v) procurement fraud and corruption. To mitigate these risks, the Project will \nprovide technical and management advisory support and training, particularly during the first 2 \nyears of implementation.                                             \n                                                                \n69.  The multifaceted character of the Project limits its financial and economic risks. The risks \nto individual subprojects may be significant, but all are unlikely to occur; the overall project risk \nis low. Market risks include (i) excess production could lower local prices and reduce returns to \nhouseholds; this would be more likely if local production is not adequately connected to market \ndistribution chains; and (ii) tourism demand could fail to grow as expected due to congestion or \nother negative impacts. These risks will be mitigated through planning and coordination of \nproducers, in particular, through market diversification, and with coordinated tourism sector \nplanning.  Technical  activity  risks  are  addressed  by  (i)  ensuring  appropriate  contractual \nrelationships are in place; and (ii) providing for adequate review, technical assessment, and \nmonitoring. \n \n \n \n ", "    23 \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n70.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government, NHARG, and NFD have given \nthe following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n1.  IEM Policy in the Project Area \n \n71.  NHARG will issue, within 5 years of commencement of the Project, the IEM policy, \nsatisfactory to ADB, which will incorporate for the project area (i) the recommendations of the \nStrategy and Action Plan on Combating Land Degradation in Ningxia (final report); (ii) principles \nof the IEM approach for the NHAR, including the items in para. 24 (i) (a), (c), (h), (i), and (j); and \n(iii) guidance to government agencies on the use of IEM practices in their area of responsibility \n \n72.  The  PPMO  will,  prior  to  completion  of  the  Project,  submit  to  NHARG  its \nrecommendations and findings for implementation of the IEM policy. \n \n73.  NHARG will formulate and gradually apply principles of conservation agriculture within \nthe policy for the whole project area based on an IEM approach to address land degradation \ncontrol. \n \n2.  Environmental Management  \n \n74.  NHARG will, within 3 years of the commencement of the Project, or such other period as \nwill be agreed between NHARG and ADB, prepare and submit legislation recommendations to \nthe  Standing  Committee  of  the  People\u2019s  Congress  of  the  NHAR,  which  will  include  draft \nregulations relating to wetlands management, and draft regulations on water resource zoning, \nsatisfactory to ADB. \n \n75.  NHARG will, within 3 years of the commencement of the Project, or such other period as \nwill be agreed between NHARG and ADB, prepare and submit legislation recommendations to \nthe  Standing  Committee  of  the  People\u2019s  Congress  of  the  NHAR,  which  will  include  draft \nregulations relating to implementation of the National Water Law (2002), and regulations on the \ncontrol of pesticide and fertilizer usage to reduce nonpoint source pollution, satisfactory to ADB. \n \n76.  NHARG will ensure that, by no later than 31 December 2008, the HPCMA (west of the \nXixia Canal) will be classified and gazetted as a provincial nature reserve and not be used for \nfuture  activities  that  will  damage  the  original  ecological  environment,  including agricultural, \nforestry, production, or industrial use. \n \n77.  On the basis of monitoring methods to be agreed between NWRD and ADB, and in \naccordance with the IWRMP, NHARG will ensure that the provision of Xixia Canal will not result \nin any increased water extraction from the Yellow River for the irrigation system including Meili, \nYaojin, Xigan, and Xixia canals. \n \n78.  NHARG, through NWRD, within 18 months of the commencement of the Project, will \nprepare and issue the IWRMP, including a water pricing mechanism to support water trading in \nthe NHAR, satisfactory to ADB. NHARG will ensure that the necessary regulations with respect \nto implementation of the IWRMP will be incorporated in the draft regulations relating to the \nimplementation of the National Water Law (2002) as referred to in para. 75.  \n \n ", "24   \n3.  Implementation \n \n79.  NHARG will establish the lead group, which will ensure overall coordination between \nsectors and agencies. The lead group will be chaired by the governor of Ningxia (or his and/or \nher  representative).  Membership  will  comprise  those  in  charge  of  each  of  the  concerned \ndepartments of the NHAR including finance, forestry, agricultural and animal husbandry, and \nwater resources; and representatives of Development and Reform Commission, Environment \nProtection Bureau, Yinchuan Municipality, NARB, and Ningxia Administrative Bureau. The main \nresponsibilities of the lead group include (i) approve important policies and principles relating to \nIEM; (ii) review project plans and ensure that all activities are in accordance with IEM; (iii) refer \ntechnical plans and sector plans to sector experts for review; (iv) approve final project work \nplans,  enable  coordination,  and  improve  interagency  communications;  and  (v)  provide \nleadership and guidance to the IEM spatial planning programs. The lead group will meet each \nquarter during implementation and such other times as may be necessary. It will be supported \nby a lead support group which, for the duration of the Project, will be the PPMO.  \n  \n80.  NFD has established the PPMO, which will have a dual role of managing the Project and \nproviding necessary support to the lead group. The PPMO will be adequately staffed once the \nProject is approved with full-time personnel to properly carry out the tasks assigned to it under \nthe Project. The PPMO will be equipped with skill sets and resources: (i) project administration \nincluding planning, financial management, and project management; (ii) sector focal points for \neach of the PIAs; and (iii) a group of technical experts who can review plans, proposals, and \ninvestments to ensure technical correctness and coordination with the relevant departments and \nagencies. International and national consultants will conduct their research and consultancy \nwork under the direction of the PPMO. Following completion of the Project, the PPMO will \ncontinue its role of supporting the lead group. \n \n81.  NHARG will ensure that part of the loan proceeds are onlent to the subborrowers and \nthat such onlending in all cases is on the same terms and conditions as the ADB loan. \n \n82.  NHARG will take all necessary measures to ensure that all the PIAs and PIUs carry out \ntheir respective activities under the Project and the timely provision of all counterpart funding for \nsuccessful implementation of the Project.  \n \n83.    NHARG will procure the necessary approvals from the Ningxia Cultural and Relic \nManagement Bureau for the alignment of Xixia Canal and report the approval to the State Relics \nManagement Administration.  \n \n84.  NHARG will implement the Project in concurrence with the gender action plan agreed \nbetween NHARG and ADB, and the participation plan to be drawn up within 6 months of \ncommencement of the Project. \n \n4.  Capacity Building \n \n85.  NFD will ensure that all PIAs, PIUs, and other relevant stakeholders implement, in \naccordance with the implementation plan agreed upon by NHAR and ADB, the capacity building \nand  institutional  strengthening  recommendations  made  by  the  consultants,  as  set  out  as  \noutput 1 of the Project. \n \n86.  NFD will select the most suitable and available trainers and training institutions based \nupon selection criteria to be agreed by NHAR and ADB. \n \n ", "    25 \n87.  NFD will ensure that all staff selected for training are suitable for such training and are \nselected using a transparent and objective methodology. NFD will take such steps as may be \nreasonable to ensure that all staff who receive training under the Project remain available during \nthe project implementation period.  \n \n5.  Environment \n \n88.  NFD  will  cause  each  relevant  PIA  to  construct,  maintain,  and  operate  the  project \nfacilities in strict conformity to (i) all applicable national and local government environmental \nlaws,  regulations,  and  procedures;  (ii)  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002);  and  (iii) the \nenvironmental mitigation and monitoring measures detailed in the approved EIA, summary EIA, \nand relevant summary IEEs and EMP for the Project. \n \n89.  NFD will ensure that all IEEs and EIA are reviewed and updated, after final detailed \ndesigns are completed and approved by ADB and prior to any works being undertaken, and all \nmitigation measures will be incorporated in the bidding documents and civil works contracts. \n \n90.  NHARG will ensure that each PIA (i) engage sufficient personnel and resources to \nmonitor implementation of the EMP; and (ii) provide monitoring reports to the PPMO, which will \ncoordinate the preparation of a semiannual environmental report on implementation of the EMP \nin a format acceptable to ADB for the duration of the Project. \n \n91.  NHARG will ensure that all planting of perennial trees, plants, and shrubs in the project \narea will be made on the basis of sound ecological considerations, taking into account the \nefficiency of water usage and an IEM approach to natural resource management. \n \n6.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n \n92.  NHARG will ensure that (i) all land acquisition and rights-of-way required by the Project \nare made available in a timely manner; (ii) the resettlement plan will be implemented promptly \nand efficiently in accordance with its terms; (iii) the resettlement plan will be prepared and \nimplemented  in  accordance  with  all  applicable  national  and  local  government  laws  and \nregulations and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995); (iv) the resettlement plan will be \nupdated and submitted to ADB for approval, prior to award of civil works contracts and following \nany changes arising from finalization of detailed design; (v) it will consult with and disclose the \nresettlement plan to all affected persons and the public, and on ADB\u2019s website; (vi) it will make \nthe  necessary  and  timely  provision  from  counterpart  funding  for  compensation,  eligibility, \nrehabilitation measures, resettlement costs, grievance redress, and monitoring and evaluation; \n(vii) compensation and allowances are paid and assets are replaced before the displacement of \naffected people; and (viii) it will engage an independent agency acceptable to ADB, who will \nmonitor and evaluate implementation of the resettlement plan and forward reports to ADB \nannually. \n \n7.

Appendix 2   \n \nSECTOR ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Overview \n \n1.  The Project covers a total land area of 3,655 square kilometers (km2), distributed across \nthe six counties and/or districts under Yinchuan Municipality. Rangeland is the largest land \ncover, particularly in the most fragile Helan Mountain foothills. The project area of proposed \ninterventions is bounded to the west by the Helan Mountains, to the east by the Yellow River, to \nthe north by a line above the Shahu Lake wetland region, and in the south by the southern \nboundary of Yongning County. The project area is in an arid part of the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC) with adverse climatic conditions: low precipitation; high potential evaporation; \ngroundwater with high pH and, in places, high salinity and alkalinity; cold winters; and mild \nsummers. However, the area has favorable hydrological characteristics: major features of the \nYellow River pass through it; the area has considerable wetlands; deep alluvial aquifers; and the \nprotected  Helan  Mountains.  These  conditions  provide  the  area  with  resources  key  to \ndevelopment in the rural sector.  \n \n2.  Drylands cover about 41% of the world\u2019s land surface and are home to over 38% of the \nworld\u2019s population. Severe land degradation is present on 10\u250020% of these drylands and \npoverty exceeds that of any other ecosystem classification worldwide. The PRC has some of \nthe worst land degradation in the world, with more than 40% of its land area adversely affected; \na strong correlation exists between land degradation and the incidence of poverty. The PRC \nGovernment\u2019s  past  top-down  and  uncoordinated  sector-by-sector  approach  has  proven \nexpensive and only partially successful. Because the root causes have not been adequately \naddressed, the approach was not sustainable. A recent worldwide review of lessons identified \nfor drylands strongly endorses an integrative approach of the type being taken by the Project, \nbased  on  key  lessons  that  include  the  following:1 (i)  Desertification2 has  emerged  from  a \ncombination  of  social  and  biophysical  causal  factors.  Poor  resource  management  is \ncompounded by weak institutions, poorly implemented technologies, or exploitative economic \nsystems. (ii) Expansion of cropping into rangelands during wet periods often results in crises \nand environmental collapse when dry conditions  return, e.g., the 1930s dust bowl (United \nStates)  and  desertification  of  the  PRC\u2019s  Ordos  Plateau  (adjacent  to  the  project  area).  \n(iii) Development projects in drylands that have been justified as reducing poverty have been \ndriven by higher political or economic objectives (e.g., relocation of people). Out-migration is \noften needed to sustain poverty reduction in drylands. Poverty trap thresholds require outside \ninterventions and livelihood diversification to reduce dependency on highly variable natural \nresources. (iv) Top-down policies often contradict local practices and undermine sustainable \ndevelopment. An increased role for local communities and land users is needed for win-win \n(environment\u2013development)  outcomes  requiring  rights  to  participate  and  capacity  building \ninitiatives. Combining local environmental knowledge with scientific knowledge can contribute to \nsustainable management. (v) The critical dynamics of dryland human\u2013environmental systems \nare determined by slow variables (e.g., soil fertility, household capital wealth) with long turnover \ntimes, not by fast variables (e.g., crop yields, household disposable cash), which are poor \nindicators of land degradation or the need for intervention. However, most interventions focus \non the less strategically important fast variables, leading to confusion and poor designs based \non a lack of understanding of system dynamics. \n                                                 \n1  Reynolds, J. et al. 2007.

Ecosystem degradation, of which land degradation is a major component, is mostly \ncaused  by  interacting  socioeconomic  factors  (e.g.,  overexploitation  of  natural  resources, \npoverty,  and  population  pressure).  Ecosystem  management  attempts  to  address  these  by \ninfluencing the ways in which people use natural resources and benefit from viable ecosystems. \nIntegrated ecosystem management (IEM) is a holistic approach to addressing the linkages \nbetween ecosystem functions and services, and social, economic, and production systems. It \nrecognizes that people and the natural resources they depend upon directly or indirectly, such \nas land, water, and forests, are inextricably linked. Rather than treat each resource in isolation, \nIEM  offers  the  option  of  treating  all  elements  of  ecosystems  together  to  produce  multiple \nbenefits.  IEM  is  incorporated  in  a  number  of  international  conventions  concerning  the \nenvironment and development; and international experience demonstrates the value of this \napproach. \n \n4.  Based  on  lessons  from  dryland  experience  in  industrial  societies  (e.g.,  Australia, \nCanada, and United States), Africa (e.g., Ethiopia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, and Sudan), PRC, and \nSouth America (e.g., El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua); and the experience of \ndryland research institutions such as the International Center for Agricultural Research in the \nDry Areas and the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics; the Global \nEnvironment Facility (GEF) and other development partners have been supporting the PRC to \nchange its approach to combating land degradation. In these countries, from the 1930s onward, \nbottom-up  approaches  bringing  local  farmers  and  graziers,  scientists,  business,  and \ngovernment  agencies  together  to  solve  local  problems  have  proved  successful.  Adequate \nincentives, controls, and financial resources to ensure that environmental functions and services \nare rehabilitated and maintained are essential. Large areas that were severely degraded have \nbeen rehabilitated and used for sustainable agriculture and other purposes, and yield higher \noutput and wealth for larger human populations than previously. Community organizations, \nincluding farmer and water-user associations, and a clear legal and regulatory framework, are \nfeatured. Market-based solutions that link rural populations with processors and markets are \nessential  for  viable  livelihoods.  An  international  workshop  on  IEM,  held  in  Beijing  on  1\u25002 \nNovember  2004,  introduced  the  concepts  and  principles  to  promote  an  understanding  of \novercoming the main barriers to combating land degradation.3 \n \nB.  IEM in the PRC \n \n5.  The PRC Government is adopting the IEM approach under the 11th Five-Year Plan \n(FYP), as IEM is seen as having a better chance of lasting success than the top-down, sector-\nby-sector  approach,  which  has  been  the  PRC\u2019s  conventional  approach.  The  PRC\u2013GEF \nPartnership on Land Degradation in Dryland Ecosystems is helping introduce the IEM approach.  \n \n6.  The  first  project  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  under  the  partnership,  the \nCapacity Building to Combat Land Degradation Project, is ongoing in six provinces and/or \nautonomous  regions:  Gansu,  Inner  Mongolia,  Ningxia  Hui,  Qinghai,  Shaanxi,  and  Xinjiang \nUygur. Its initial focus is for each province and/or region to (i) prepare its own strategic plan for \nland degradation control using an IEM approach; (ii) review relevant policy and legislative and/or \nregulatory  conditions;  (iii)  strengthen  national  and  provincial  coordination,  and  improve \n                                                 \n3  Seven barriers to a comprehensive approach to land degradation in the PRC are (i) weak policy and legislative \nframework, (ii) uncoordinated sector approaches, (iii) poor application of lessons from previous experience,  \n(iv) undeveloped participatory approaches, (v) poorly developed locality-specific land use planning, (vi) perverse \nincentives, and (vii) inadequate financial arrangements and incentives.   \n ", "34      Appendix 2 \nprovincial  and  county  operating  arrangements;  (iv)  support  the  capacity  for  future  IEM \ninvestment projects;4 (v) examine ways to improve and coordinate existing monitoring and \nevaluation systems; and (vi) support project implementation. A multiagency task force has been \ninvolved in preparing a Ningxia IEM strategy and action plan for land degradation control. The \nfirst draft report was completed in November 2006. In addition, a smaller legal and policy review \nteam has undertaken a detailed assessment of the legal and policy environment required for \nIEM within Ningxia, and incorporated the findings within the strategy.5 \n \n7.  Through the initial capacity building, awareness on IEM has been achieved among a \nrelatively limited number of government officials, planners, and technical experts. However, \neffective  operationalization  of  the  IEM  strategy,  particularly  through  implementation  of  the \nProject, requires a critical mass of people with not only a good understanding of IEM but also \nthe capacity to plan and implement IEM-based field interventions. The concepts and principles \nof IEM are new to Ningxia. While they are gaining acceptance, time will be required to include \nthem in development policies, programs, and investment projects, although the principles are \nincorporated within Ningxia\u2019s 11th FYP. \n \n8.  Previous  aid-assisted  projects  in  the  drylands  of  the  PRC  have  used  an  IEM-style \napproach,  e.g.,  local  community  participation,  bottom-up  design,  scientific  resource,  social \nassessments, and detailed monitoring. These include bilateral project assistance from Australia \nand Canada in Inner Mongolia and Qinghai; the World Bank\u2019s Loess Plateau rehabilitation \ninterventions; and most recently, the Gansu and Xinjiang Pastoral Development Project. Yet, \ndespite good local results, mainstreaming has not occurred as they were seen as \u201ctoo slow and \ntoo expensive,\u201d and poorly understood at senior levels. The changed rural priorities under the \n11th FYP provide a far better chance of success. Under the Project, the links between rural \ncommunities  and  commercial  enterprises  to  overcome  poverty  offer  a  more  sustainable \nalternative than a fully public sector-led intervention. \n \nC.  IEM Approach under the Project \n \n9.  The Project is the main instrument through which IEM will be institutionalized in Ningxia. \nFigure  A2  shows  key  links  between  project  area-wide  policy,  regulatory,  and  ecosystem \nanalysis  through  site-specific  conservation  and  livelihood  development.  The  project \nmanagement structure and role of state-owned enterprises in helping poor households exit \npoverty is given in Supplementary Appendix E. Consultant services will assist implementation \n(Appendix 8). The following measures will underpin introduction of an IEM approach: \n \n(i)  Project  management  and  planning.  A  common  understanding  of  the \necosystems  of  the  project  area  is  needed  if  an  IEM  approach  is  to  be \nsuccessfully taken. A multisector approach is essential as no agency has all the \ndisciplinary  experts  required  to  solve  the  multidimensional  problems  of  land \ndegradation.  This  requires  coordination  and  cooperation  between  all  sector \n                                                 \n4  This includes (i) documenting IEM/land degradation control-related projects and programs, (ii) identifying lessons \nfrom past successes and failures by assessing the impact of past investments, (iii) training a cadre of provincial \nplanners with the skills required to design land degradation control investment projects, and (iv) conducting \nfeasibility studies of priority IEM and/or land degradation control project investments eligible for possible financing \nunder the partnership. \n5  Ningxia OP12-Executing Office. November 2006. Strategy and Action Plan on Combating Land Degradation. The \nreport  was  prepared  by  a  multidisciplinary  team  of  Chinese  academics,  sector  experts,  and  Ningxia  Hui \nAutonomous Region (NHAR) officials who worked together for 12 months. The final report will be submitted to the \nNHAR government for approval, so that it will become an executable policy document.  \n ", "                                                                                                                                                      Appendix 2  35   \nagencies, especially those responsible for agriculture, livestock, forestry, land \nand water resources, environment, science and technology, finance, planning, \nand legislation; and project implementing agencies and the public. Training and \ncapacity development for stakeholder agencies and participants will be provided, \nand regulatory reforms will support improved ecosystem management.  \n(ii)  Spatial planning, integrated water resource management plan, zoning, and \nIEM information center. The slow variables (para. 2) will be assessed so that \nfuture  development  takes  place  within  the  sustainable  capacity  of  the \necosystems.  This  will  provide  all  stakeholder  agencies  and  leaders  with  an \nunderstanding of the capacity of the physical aspects of the ecosystems, and \nfuture demands. A signed agreement is already in place between 13 agencies to \nshare information with an open access website, and an IEM information center is \nbeing equipped that will have analysis and mapping capacity.  \n(iii)  Site-specific  planning  and  sustainable  development.  This  will  include \ngrasslands, wetlands, and irrigated areas. It will involve commercial enterprises \nto  help  small  farmers  exit  poverty  through  links  to  market  opportunities  in \nsustainable production systems, and rehabilitate areas for conservation of natural \nhabitats  that  provide  vital  ecosystem  functions  and  services.  Participation  of \ncommunity  organizations  (e.g.,  114  farmer  associations  and  163  water-user \ngroups  are  in  the  project  area)  is  a  feature  that  will  replace  the  top-down \napproach. Sector and market issues are addressed in paras. 10\u250011. \n(iv)  Technology  demonstrations  of  best  practices.  The  focus  will  be  on \nconservation agriculture, water use efficiency, fertilizer management, wetland \nand grassland management, and integrated pest management, e.g., substantial \necological and environmental benefits can be gained from adopting conservation \nagriculture practices. This is a holistic approach to agricultural production based \non  enhancing  natural  soil  biological  regeneration  processes  involving  \n(a) improved soil organic matter management for the efficient use of rainfall, soil \nmoisture, and plant nutrients; and (b) maintenance of soil physical properties by \nkeeping mechanical tillage to the absolute minimum required for direct planting \nand/or seeding.  \n \nD.  Market and Sector Issues \n \n10.  The current conditions in key sector markets likely to be developed or influenced under \nthe Project are summarized in this appendix. All production interventions under the Project are \nbased on sound assessments of financial and economic aspects of the proposed commodities, \nand commercial decisions by the investing enterprises. Market conditions and forecasts of \nfuture market opportunities (i.e., supply, demand, and anticipated price trends) are detailed for \nthe  following  markets:  livestock  raising  and  the  production  of  processed  beef  and  dairy \nfoodstuffs, including halal products for established export markets; vineyards and wine; Chinese \nmedicinal herbs; horticulture; and the supply and condition of existing tourism facilities and \nproducts. Expectations regarding future tourist numbers likely to visit the city of Yinchuan and \nsurrounding areas are considered along with assessments of the impact of planned upgrades to \nexisting cultural\u2013historical sites and nature preserves on future visitor arrival figures. Reviewing \nthe  planned  increases  in  output  for  these  commodities  and  increases  in  visitor  numbers \nforecasted to result from the proposed project activities, trends toward increasing consumption \nof these goods in general, and in niche markets for some of Ningxia\u2019s products in particular \n(e.g., halal markets), suggest a highly favorable market environment can be expected to support \nthe planned development activities. \n \n ", "36      Appendix 2 \n11.  The sustainability of the natural resource base is analyzed in two detailed supporting \ndocuments: (i) Environmental Assessment Report (May 2007), and (ii) the final GEF submission \n(August 2007). The precarious state of the natural resource base means that project-financed \ninnovations are required that will support (i) rehabilitation of vital functions; (ii) development of \npromising growth or niche markets under technologies offering sustainable resource use; and \n(iii) improved future economic and commercial viability, so that rural producers can improve both \nthe level and the sustainability of their incomes.  \n \n \n   \n  Figure A2: Overview of Project Implementation Linkages \n   \n \n  Leading Group\n  Spatial Plan Task Force \n \n \n \n \nWRD Planning Institute \n  IWRMP Zonation Task Force \n \n \n \n    port \n       nt Sup M-a Ynian-g xHei mPWCeeMntltAa Pnldasns COoSmwitnmee eMdr caEinnaalt egarenpmdri esSnettas t,e-\n    me - Yinchuan Wetlands Agency \ne\n        Manag  Annual Plans\n  ct \n      Proje Tech- nCoolnosgeyr vDaetmioonn Asgtrraictiuolntusre SF/ D ept Agric /W  RD\n  - Water Use Efficiency Site Committees\n  - Site Specific N-it IrPoMgen Management and Staff \n \n \n  Site Extension Programs\n \n \nBest Management Practices\nResource Users via\n  - Conservation Agriculture\nWater User \n  - Perennial Crops Associations \n- Water Use Management\n  - Wetland Habitat Management Farmer Associations\nMarketing Association\n  - IPM\n \n \nAgric = agriculture, Dept = department, HPCMA = Helan mountains piedmont conservation management area, \n \nIPM = integrated pest management, IWRMP = integrated water resources management plan, SF = state farm, \n  WRD = Water Resources Department. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n ", "    Appendix 3  37\n      \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE  \nFunding  Amount \nProject Title  Year \nAgency  ($ million) \nAsian  1.

The initial period of the Project will address planning needs in the project area using \nspatial planning procedures to define land use capability, ecologically sensitive areas, and \nconservation zones. An integrated water resource management plan (IWRMP) will be prepared \nearly in the Project. The introduction of management zones will be supported through the \ndevelopment of management planning, demonstration of new technologies, and development \nand extension of best management practices for land users. These systems will be supported \nthrough  the  capacity-building  programs;  introduction  of  institutional  reforms;  use  of  supply \ncontracting and market chain linkages; and strengthening of farmer, grower, and water user \nassociations to enable them to (i) access technical services, (ii) deliver farmer field schools, and \n(iii) link producers to supply and market chains.

Analysis of the Project \n \n1.  Project Assessment \n \n1.  The Project has 23 main activities overall (Supplementary Appendix E). Of these, 13 do \nnot  generate  direct,  quantifiable,  economic  benefits,  but  are  important  public  goods  for \nenvironmental management and capacity building; only project costs are estimated. For the \nremaining 10, the benefits and costs are estimated, and financial and economic indicators \nassessed (Table A9.1). Together, these investments will ensure reforms provide livelihood \nimprovements, poverty reduction, and sustainable economic development in the project area. \n \nTable A9.1: Assessment of Project Activities \nActivity  Main Project Activities \nCost estimates only  Building IEM institutional arrangements (including legal reform, information \nmanagement, training and capacity building), project management, spatial planning, \nIWRM planning, Helanshan Nature Reserve, Yinxi wetlands and grassland set-aside, \nconservation agriculture, Yinchuan City wetlands \nBenefits and costs  Water resources (sustainable land resources)a, Xixia Canal (irrigation system and \non-farm water efficiency),b beef production, dairy production, vineyards, Shahu Lake, \nYuehai Lake, Yinxi alternative livelihoods, high technology agriculture \nIEM = integrated ecosystem management, IWRM = integrated water resource management. \na   Only benefits relating to conservation agriculture are estimated.  \nb   Benefit-cost evaluation combined with Xixia Canal. \nSource: Asian Development Bank.                          \n \n2.  Benefit and cost estimates are based on feasibility study estimates originally prepared \nby  the  project  implementing  agencies  (PIAs)  for  the  various  subprojects.  The  technical \nassistance team reviewed the estimates and modified or reformulated them as necessary to \nmeet the Project\u2019s requirements and to ensure conformity with the relevant Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects  (1997)  and  Financial \nManagement and Analysis of Projects (2005). The Project has two types of subprojects: those \nconcerned with agricultural production and for which quantifiable benefits are physical outputs \n(such  as  beef,  wine,  vegetables);  and  the  wetlands  and  cultural  relic  sites  for  which  the \nquantifiable outputs are visitor numbers and visitor receipts. In one case, Yuehai Lake, benefits \nare a combination of visitor receipts and sales of aquatic products from the lake. \n \n3.  For subprojects that involve agricultural production, the expected benefits are sufficient \nto  provide  incentives  for  households  to  participate  in  subproject  activities  and  adopt  new \nproduction and management methods that will be introduced by the subprojects. For this group \nof subprojects, per household annual incremental net benefits vary between CNY2,400 and \nCNY37,000.  Net  benefits  reflect  the  resources,  including  labor,  involved  in  the  production \nactivity. \n \n4.  Benefit estimates are based on the current situation and data in each case, and on \nconservative assessments of future developments with the Project. With- and without-project \nscenarios  are  identified  for  each  subproject.  However,  agricultural  subprojects  have  a \nbackground issue of land degradation, which was not directly considered in the analysis. Most \nscenarios assume that the future without the Project is more or less the same as the present. \n ", "56      Appendix 9 \nThis  tends  to  overestimate  the  without-project  production  since  given  continued  land \ndegradation, present production is more likely to only be maintained with increasing inputs and \ncosts, and declining returns for producers. \n \n5.  The Project will generate many nonquantified benefits, most fall into two broad groups: \nenvironmental and ecosystem benefits, and cultural and heritage benefits. Together, these are \nsignificant benefits that add justification for project implementation. Included in these groups are \n(i) benefits accruing from the protection and restoration of wetlands and wildlife habitats, and \nimprovements  in  wildlife  populations;  (ii)  improvements  in  biodiversity,  especially  on  the \npiedmont of Helan Mountains; (iii) improvements in water quality from secondary treatment of \nsewage  plant  effluents,  including  the  use  of  selected  plants  to  remove  water  pollutants;  \n(iv) reduction in water pollution from the overuse of nitrogen and other fertilizers on project area \nfarms; (v) reduced land degradation; and (vi) intangible benefits accruing from the protection \nsites of cultural and historical importance. \n \n6.  Financial and economic indicators estimated for the activities and the overall Project are \ngiven in Table A9.2. These exhibit a considerable range of values of internal rates of return and \nnet present value, both financial and economic. Only one, Yinchuan City wetlands, has financial \nindicators below the acceptance level determined by the weighted average cost of capital of \n4.0%. This subproject has significant investments in wetland environmental and ecological \ninfrastructure, but relatively limited visitor potential because of the size and location. It focuses \non the wetland environment and habitats and does not offer the wide range of leisure activities \nassociated with, for example, Shahu and Yuehai lakes. \n \n7.  One subproject, Yinxi alternative livelihoods, has an economic internal rate of return \n(EIRR) that is just below the 12% discount rate. The benefits are conservatively estimated, so \nthe EIRR may be underestimated to some extent. This activity has the greatest potential direct \nimpact on poverty reduction as it will involve about 9,800 households, a high proportion of which \ncurrently fall below the poverty line defined by Yinchuan Municipality and all of which can expect \nto have household incomes above the poverty line once the Project is established.   \n \n8.  The EIRR for the whole Project is estimated at 14.4% and the net present value at \nCNY201.4 million. Because the Project is multifaceted with subprojects across several diverse \nsectors, this result is robust to variation in key variables within any of its component parts. Since \nadverse movements in prices or outputs in tandem are not likely, the effect of variations on the \nwhole Project is limited. For example, if the selling prices for milk, beef, and wine, all important \nquantified benefits, were all 10% below the prices assumed in the analysis, the EIRR for the \nwhole  Project  would  still  be  13.1%.  Conversely,  a  reduction  in  total  project  costs  of  6% \nincreases the EIRR only to 14.6%. \n \n2.  Financial Analysis \n \n9.  The impact of the Project on household incomes is summarized in Table A9.3. These \nincomes  do  not  include  the  value  of  households\u2019  own  labor,  which  in  most  cases  will  be \napproximately equivalent to one full-time person. Household incomes with the Project are above \nthe poverty line (CNY1,000 per capita per year in Yinchuan Municipality) in all these cases \nexcept for beef production, which is an additional activity to households\u2019 other farming activities, \nand therefore does not represent the full household income. \n \n \n \n ", "                                                                                                                                                   Appendix 9         57   \n10.

Assumptions Applied in the Economic and Financial Analyses \n \n12.  The economic and financial analyses are in 2007 constant prices. The exchange rate \nused throughout is CNY7.64 = $1, the prevailing rate at appraisal in April 2007. The project life \nfor the analysis is 25 years. For the economic analysis, the discount rate is 12%; and for the \nfinancial analysis, a weighted average cost of capital of 4.0% was estimated and used. In the \nfinancial analyses of the subprojects, value-added, business, income, and consumption taxes \nand surtax are applied at the rates applicable for the type of business activity concerned.  \n \n13.  For most commodities, little or no price distortion is apparent in the market. Current \nmarket prices are used for all financial prices, for both traded and nontraded goods. For all \ngoods for which a specific conversion has not been estimated, a conversion factor of 1.0 is \nused. Conversion factors for maize, wheat, and beef are estimated based on calculated import \nparity prices. Tax and other transfer payment calculations are included in the financial analysis \nbut are deleted in the economic analysis. A shadow wage rate factor of 0.80 is applied to the \nprice of unskilled labor in the economic analysis. Conversion factors used in the analysis are \ngiven in Table A9.5. \n \nTable A9.5: Conversion Factors \nItem  Value \nStandard conversion factor  1.00 \nFertilizers  1.20 \nWheat  0.94 \nFeed concentrate (based on maize)  1.13 \nIrrigation water  5.00 \nShadow wage rate factor  0.80 \nSource:  Asian Development Bank estimates.          \n \n14.  Import  parity  prices  for  fertilizers,  maize,  wheat,  and  beef  are  estimated  based  on \naverage commodity prices for 2004\u22122006, as reported by the World Bank. These calculated \nprices are used to estimate conversion factors for these goods. For fertilizers, a composite \nconversion factor is estimated based on the ratio for urea, phosphate, and potash of 2:1:1. For \nbeef, the calculated conversion factor is 1.01, which is approximated to 1.0. \n \n15.  The  price  of  unskilled  labor  in  the  project  area  is  about  CNY25  per  day.  For  the \neconomic analysis, a shadow wage rate factor of 0.80 is applied. \n \n16.  The price of irrigation water is generally accepted to not reflect its true resource cost. A \nrecent World Bank project used an economic price for water of CNY0.3 per cubic meter (m3), \n ", "                                                                                                                                                   Appendix 9         59   \nwhich is adopted here as well.3 This compares with a current financial price for irrigation water in \nthe project area of CNY0.06 per m3. \n \n4.  Distribution and Poverty Impact \n \n17.  Although the main focus of the Project is on IEM, several subprojects will also have a \nsignificant impact on poverty reduction. Those that will have the greatest impact are the Yinxi \nalternative livelihoods and the high technology agriculture subprojects. These focus on the \nneeds of the resettled population, which is the poorest group in the project area. Together, \nthese  subprojects  will  benefit  at  least  11,000  households  (55,000  people),  generating \nincremental benefits per capita that in almost all cases will be greater than the present poverty \nline income for Yinchuan Municipality of CNY1,000 per capita per year. The high technology \nagriculture subproject will generate significant demand for daily employment for people living in \nthe area but not directly involved in subproject activities. \n \n18.  The  beef  production  and  vineyards  subprojects  will  benefit  a  large  number  of \nhouseholds. Together, these subprojects will improve the livelihoods of about 7,500 households, \nalthough mostly Ningxia State Farm Group households, which are not currently below the \nofficial poverty line. \n \n19.  Quantified benefits of the Project accrue principally to (i) households participating in the \nagricultural  and  livestock  production  activities  through  increased  household  incomes; \n(ii) households benefiting from increased full- or part-time employment with tourism, processing, \nand production activities, and through increased or more regular household income; (iii) the \ncommercial PIAs and enterprises through increased revenues and profits; and (iv) Ningxia Hui \nAutonomous Region government through increased tax revenues from the Project\u2019s commercial \nactivities (estimated at around CNY30 million per year). Nonquantified benefits in the form of \nstrengthened institutional planning, management, and coordinating skills and capabilities accrue \nto the PIAs and enterprises.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.   Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \n1.  Based on the country poverty assessment, the country partnership strategy, and the sector analysis, describe how \nthe project would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty reduction \nstrategy of the partner country. \n \nThe country partnership strategy (2008\u20132010)a of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC) emphasizes continued support to reduce poverty, improve the quality of life for the millions of people with \nlow incomes, and support for the PRC\u2019s contribution to protect regional and global public goods. The Project supports \nADB\u2019s strategic concerns to improve the environment and promote equitable and inclusive gowth, as set out in the \nstrategy. Nationally, poor people mostly live in the central and western provinces that lag the eastern provinces in \nachieving the Millennium Development Goals. In these regions, poverty is mostly rural and strongly correlated to \naccess  to  land  and  incidence  of  land  degradation.  The  Project  will  address  poverty  reduction  by  introducing \necologically sound investments that support the livelihoods of the rural poor in obtaining better access to higher-value \nmarket chains and off-farm income, as well as through improving vocational skills, and reducing vulnerability through \ncontract farming arrangements that include provision of technical, financial, and marketing skills.  \n \nThe PRC and ADB will cooperate on a broad range of activities related to policy and regulatory reform and capacity \nbuilding in the environment sector, and support projects to reduce poverty as one of the underlying causes of \nenvironment problems. Projects will be designed so that the poor increase their incomes, while also capturing \nenvironmental benefits. To sharpen the poverty focus of environmental work, the PRC and ADB are addressing land \ndegradation through an integrated ecosystem management (IEM) approach by supporting implementation of the long-\nterm  PRC\u2013Global  Environment  Facility  (GEF)  Partnership  on  Land  Degradation  in  Dryland  Ecosystems.  The \npartnership addresses policy, institutional, technical, and financing issues related to combating land degradation \nthrough a programmatic approach. It aims to arrest land degradation and restore dryland ecosystems to reduce poverty \nin the western region. The Project is one of the demonstration investment projects to be designed as part of the PRC\u2013\nGEF partnership. \n \nThe project area has a population (including Yinchuan City) of 1.14 million with about 60% (690,000) urban and about \n40% (450,000) rural. The project area of 3,655 square kilometers includes three districts (Jinfen, Xingqing, and Xixia) \nand two counties (Helan and Yongning). In 2004, the average annual urban income was CNY7,200 ($931.13) \ncompared with the rural per capita income of CNY3,080 ($398.32). The project area includes 19 townships in Yinchuan \nand nine state farm enterprises of the wider Ningxia Agricultural Reclamation Bureau. The project area comprises an \nintensively irrigated and cropped alluvial plain with shallow wetlands, an extensive piedmont area of poor quality soils, \nand the Helan Mountains. Irrigation water is largely dependent on surface water from the Yellow River, which is \nincreasingly facing new demands and declining availability. Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region (NHAR) had the highest \nrate of land conversion of all provinces in the last decade with expansion of irrigated agriculture on marginal soils, \nlinked to increased agrichemical use, increased runoff and salinization, and loss of water quality and grasslands.  \n \nThe  Government\u2019s  strategy  considers  rapid  urbanization  as  an  important  means  for  reducing  poverty.  Rapid \nurbanization  creates  new  challenges.  For  example,  competing  demand  from  urban  and  rural  water  users  will \nnecessitate reallocation of water, and increasingly scarce water resources need integrated planning systems for \nimproved water conservation and use efficiency. The Project will provide the opportunity to achieve the objective of \ndemonstrating and improving the institutional capacity to implement an IEM approach to sustainable use of natural \nresources, agriculture, and biodiversity conservation by means of (i) establishing an IEM institutional framework; (ii) \ndemonstrating integrated land and water resource management; (iii) improving rural livelihoods, through promoting \nenterprise development, and sustainable commercial agricultural (e.g., vineyards and processing, dairy production, \nhigh-technology agriculture, and greenhouse production); and (iv) integrating conservation and tourism through cultural \nand nature tourism, wetland conservation, and management.  \n \n ", "    Appendix 10     61 \n \n    \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                          Targeting Classification: Targeted Intervention \n\u2013Households \n1.    Key Issues  \n \nPoverty in the project area remains significant by world benchmarks. Using the poverty line of Yinchuan Municipality \n(CNY1,000 per capita per year)b 48,000 people are classified as poor and a similar number deemed vulnerable to \npoverty with incomes less than CNY1,500 per capita per year. The majority of poor were resettled into the project area \nthrough a government poverty reduction program from the extremely impoverished southern mountainous area of \nNingxia during 1983 to 1997. The Project\u2019s poverty classification is Targeted Intervention-Households.  \n \nA social and poverty assessment was carried out for each of the subprojects in compliance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nIncorporation of Social Dimensions in Bank Operations. The assessments included rural livelihood assessment, which \nconfirmed disparate growth rates between sectors resulting in large income inequities between rural and urban \nhouseholds and between groups of rural dwellers. Poverty analysis was undertaken using a field survey of 270 rural \nhouseholds and participatory rapid assessment within three typical communities identified through key informant \ndiscussions within the project area. They are (i) a resettlement community in the transition zone of piedmont and river \nplain, (ii) a community within the irrigated alluvial plain, and (iii) a state farm community. Institutional consultation was \nundertaken regarding ongoing programs and experiences in poverty reduction. The assessment concludes that rural \npoverty is mostly confined to previously resettled villages on marginal soil between the piedmont and the alluvial plain; \nhowever, even households in the irrigation scheme displayed indicators of increased vulnerability to poverty. State-\nfarm rural households, while having higher incomes, are found to have weaknesses in social capital and housing. \nPoverty is linked closely to limited land per capita, declining productivity, low education, increased migration for work \nand households headed by women, increased dependence on straw and crop residues for heating (reducing soil \nnutrients), and lower salaries for off-farm work. A significant finding was the inability of Hui women, who are Muslim, to \nfind off-farm employment due to their inability to migrate to work for religious reasons and the limited casual local work \nopportunities.  \n \nRural incomes are 50% lower than urban incomes creating incentives for urbanization. The underlying causes of rural \npoverty are (i) lack of reliable irrigation; (ii) small landholdings; (iii) poor soil quality and traditional farming technologies; \n(iv) surplus labor within households and limited off-farm job opportunities; (v) the need for high inputs on marginal land \n(fertilizer, machinery, and irrigation); and (vi) lack of diversified crops, especially economic crops. The analysis \nconcludes that poverty is linked strongly to insufficient land per capita and other resources, including water, limiting \nhouseholds in building sufficient capital to exit poverty. These underlying causes of rural poverty support the need for a \nstrategy that includes facilitating rural labor to move into off-farm employment.  \n \nThe Project\u2019s strategy is to address poverty by (i) addressing the root causes of land degradation, thereby reducing the \nvulnerability of households to poverty; (ii) increasing incomes by linking producers to higher-value crops and markets; \nand (iii) providing opportunities for developing skills for off-farm employment. The design of interventions on improving \nrural livelihoods and poverty reduction will result in productivity improvements and greater market certainty, leading to \nincreased incomes, especially for poor smallholders in previously resettled communities. Conservation agriculture \ntechnologies,  land  use  matched  to  soils  and  land-use  capability,  improved  water  use  and  nutrient  efficiency, \nstrengthened farmer associations, access to rural finance, contract farming agreements linked to processing and \nmarket chains, and capacity development will all contribute to improved sustainable livelihoods and improved resilience \nfor poor rural households.  \n \n \n2.   Design Features \n \nA key design feature builds on the findings of a recent ADB evaluation of poverty exit achievements, which highlighted \nthe success of linking the rural poor to commercial value-adding enterprises and the associated off-farm employment \nopportunities.  The  Project  applies  this  by  promoting  perennial  crops,  grape  and  wine  processing,  ecological \ngreenhouse systems, livestock and dairy production, provision of renewable rural energy programs, as well as the \nintroduction of time-saving technologies to enable movement of surplus labor into off-farm employment. Vocational \ntraining will enable rural residents to compete for higher paying jobs and reduce poverty in the project area.   \n \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \n \nN.A. \n \n \n ", "62     Appendix 10 \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nKey Issues \n \nIn  the  project  area,  of  the  74,000  previously  resettled  people  from  the  very  poor  southern  area  of  Ningxia, \napproximately 73% are Hui Muslims. They reside in four of six resettlement townships: Liangtian, Minning, Naliangtaizi, \nand Xinjiang. From the livelihood survey done during the technical assistance, the communities are found to be poor \nand have low economic development due to (i) low education, especially among women; (ii) access to poor quality land \nwith high irrigation costs; and (iii) heavy reliance on off-farm income. To address these issues, the project design has \nspecifically included contract farming, processing, and alternative livelihoods through links with enterprises, vocational \nand technical training, and increased irrigation efficiency measures to benefit these communities.  \n \nOverall, up to an estimated 46,400 households will benefit, with the majority of these Hui from previously resettled poor \ncommunities, including up to 5,200 individuals who will benefit from employment. The Project will train approximately \n2,200 individuals in technical subjects, 5,500 farmers in field schools and a demonstration program on conservation \nagriculture, and some 3,000 rural poor in vocational training through which additional livelihood options will develop. \nAdverse consequences are minor and come from land acquisition for the Project. These  will be mitigated by \ncompensation payments and provision of replacement houses, if necessary, as per a resettlement plan that will be \nupdated in the final design. Demonstration of new conservation agriculture approaches to land-use management will \nimprove water-use efficiency; while integrated pest and nutrient management will aid beneficiaries\u2019 integration into \nhigher-value market chains and enable households to attain higher incomes, reduce vulnerability, and increase their \nparticipation in rural decision making. Project-related human capital investments for rural households provided as skills \nand vocational training will support the orderly movement of labor into off-farm employment.  \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.    Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nThe project design process was linked and extended the ongoing OP12 PRC\u2013GEF Capacity Building to Combat Land \nDegradation Projectc and its development of a Ningxia Land Degradation Strategy and Action Plan using local experts \nworking in a multistakeholder, and multisector planning procedure. For the design of the Project, consultation has taken \nplace with stakeholders, beneficiaries, and directly affected people, and will continue during implementation. A \nparticipatory and consultative methodology was adopted to undertake the social analysis and rural livelihood survey \nduring the project preparatory technical assistance. It involved (i) a formal questionnaire survey with 270 households; \n(ii) discussions with project stakeholders; (iii) a series of stakeholder workshops with the four subborrowers; and \n(iv) interviews with key informants in rural communities, key Government staff and nongovernment organizations, \nethnic minorities, and women. Detailed discussions were maintained using both sector and cross-sector working \ngroups that included the provincial project management office (PPMO) and its expert groups, project implementing \nagencies and associated state-owned enterprises, design institutes, academics, and safeguard agencies including \nenvironment and poverty reduction officials under the leadership of the PPMO. The working groups\u2019 findings were \ncollectively discussed and reviewed through a series of stakeholder workshops. \n \n2.   What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n Information sharing         Consultation        Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \nDuring project implementation, the participation of stakeholders including beneficiaries will continue to be built through \nparticipatory  planning  and  implementation  processes.  For  example,  inclusive  processes  will  be  established  for \nparticipation in water resources planning, IEM spatial planning, conservation, and wetland management planning. The \nuse of demonstrations linked to the involvement of farmer and water user associations in farmer field schools, training \nprograms, contract farming systems, and outreach programs will adopt a highly participatory approach to rural \nlivelihood improvement. The extent and scope of participation will require institutional capacity building early during \nproject implementation to facilitate successful implementation of IEM approaches. \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nIf a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan (including budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \n \nNo C&P plan was prepared but it will be developed by the PPMO with assistance from the sociologist included in the \nconsulting package (B) during the first year.  \n \n ", "    Appendix 10     63 \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues \nGender roles are determined by a combination of cultural factors, occupations, environmental conditions, education, \nand employment opportunities. In the project area, except for the Ningxia State Farm Group, income inequities create \nincentives for rural males to migrate to urban labor markets, thus resulting in feminization of agriculture (women now \ncontribute up to 70% of the rural workforce). Female participation standards for training (including farmer field schools \nand formal training), vocational training, employment, and contract farming opportunities have been proposed along \nwith recommendations for female representation in farmer associations and the provision of opportunities in a manner \nthat enables female participation.  \n \n2.

Major impacts are defined as involving affected people being physically \ndisplaced from housing and/or losing 10% or more of their productive, income-generating assets. \n \n ", "    Appendix 11       65    \nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN  \n \n1.  The Project will support activities that require limited land acquisition, house demolition, \nand  resettlement.  In  accordance  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995), a short resettlement plan was prepared by the project implementing \nagencies (PIAs) with assistance from the Foreign Debt Management Office of the Ningxia Hui \nAutonomous Region\u2019s Finance Department, and based on consultation with affected parties. As \nfinal engineering designs are to be completed during implementation, the resettlement plan will \nneed to be updated based on the final design documentation, especially for the proposed Xixia \nCanal extension. \n \nA.  Project Impacts \n \n2.  Project construction will require the permanent acquisition of 264.7 hectares (ha) of land \nfor the Xixia Canal. Of the permanent land being acquired, only 10 ha are irrigated and 8 ha are \norchards. Temporary land acquisition during construction will be required for the Xixia Canal \n(9.3 ha) and irrigation rehabilitation (34 ha). No displacement of private housing is required. \nApproximately 3,260 people in 770 households will be affected, but the impacts are relatively \nminor  and  will  be  fully  mitigated  through  compensation  provided  by  the  Project  and  new \nopportunities through investments made by the Project.  \n \nB.   Policy and Legal Framework  \n \n3.  The resettlement plan incorporates the legal requirements of the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC) and ADB policy. The main principles guiding these requirements are (i) minimize \nnegative  social  impacts  of  project  design;  (ii)  carry  out  resettlement  and  compensation  to \nimprove, or at least restore the preproject income and living standards of people affected;  \n(iii) fully inform and consult those affected on compensation options and resettlement planning; \n(iv) provide asset compensation at replacement rates; and (v) compensate in full for lost assets, \nreplacement of assets, and resettlement allowances prior to ground leveling or demolition. \n \n4.  The resettlement plan stipulates eligibility and entitlements for land, houses, and income \nlosses, and rehabilitation subsidies in accordance with the 1998 Land Administration Law; State \nCouncil Document No. 28, Deepening Reform on Land Acquisition Systems and Reinforcement \n(2004);  and  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy.  The  legal  framework  specifies \ncompensation  standards,  and  each  subcomponent  will  determine  compensation  provisions \nbased on stated criteria and how they apply to local land productivity and site features.  \n \n5.  People affected through the permanent acquisition of land will be compensated through \npayment of (i) a land compensation fee, and (ii) a resettlement subsidy. According to the \nNingxia Regulation for Land Acquisition (1997) and the Ningxia Land Administration Regulations \n(2000), affected people will also receive compensation for the loss of crops and trees. Yinchuan \nMunicipality has also issued rules for resettlement implementation procedures. \n \n6.  According  to  the  policy  and  socioeconomic  conditions  at  the  project  sites,  detailed \ncompensation rates will be agreed upon with affected individuals or groups. For the short \nresettlement plan, compensation rates for land compensation, resettlement, relocation support, \nand  subsidy  are  based  on  the  Ningxia  Land  Administration  Regulations.  Under  these \nregulations each PIA has established compensation rates and estimated the cost based on local \nconditions and resettlement impacts.  \n \n ", "66     Appendix 11 \n7.  For cultivated land, compensation rates are 6\u221210 times output based on the average of \nthe previous 3-year output by different forms of land use. Noncultivated land is compensated at \n1\u22122 times the average of the previous 3-year annual land output. Compensation rates for lost \nincome  from  annual  crops  are  the  average  of  the  previous  3-year  annual  output;  \n2\u20133  times  the  average  annual  value  for  perennial  crops.  Land  used  temporarily  during \nconstruction will be compensated at a rate equivalent to production values foregone for the \nperiod of loss, which is expected to be less than 2 years. The contractor will restore any land \nrequired temporarily during project construction to its original condition.  \n \n8.  For structures to be demolished, replacement value defines compensation to be paid to \naffected households where rates are derived from the prices within affected areas. Those losing \nstructures will receive compensation for their plot and relocation costs. House compensation will \nnot be reduced for depreciation, and people will be allowed to salvage materials from their \nhouses. Miscellaneous resettlement support for transport and temporary housing for those \nbeing resettled is based on three times the average of the previous 3-year land output. \n \n9.  The provincial project management office (PPMO) and the relevant PIA will ensure that \nresettlement entitlements are provided to affected people prior to demolition or resettlement. \nLand compensation and resettlement subsidies will be paid to those affected or village leaders. \nHousing compensation and compensation for crops and other assets will be provided directly to \nthose affected by the loss of assets.   \n \nC.  Resettlement and Rehabilitation \n \n10.  The  impact  of  the  Project  on  people  and  their  assets  is  considered  to  be  minor. \nRehabilitation options will be selected in consultation with each individual household. Where \nhouseholds are seriously affected and risk being worse off, despite the full set of compensation \npayments,  they  will  receive  the  following  entitlements:  (i)  guarantee  of  hire  for  project \nconstruction  labor,  (ii)  offer  of  permanent  employment  by  the  project  proponent,  (iii)  skills \ntraining, and (iv) priority for involvement in other project components with the township. \n \n11.  When the public sector is affected, the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region government \n(NHARG) will help the PIAs arrange alternative land, housing, and shop arrangements. The \nprocess requires each PIA to obtain the approval of Yinchuan Municipality to proceed, and \nthereafter the PIA will apply to the Land Reserves Office for alternative premises. The PIA will \nbe required to pay the Land Reserves Office in return for the reallocation of premises from \nwithin the public sector pool.  \n \nD.  Resettlement Cost and Funding \n \n12.  Based  on  detailed  cost  estimates  of  the  subcomponents,  the  total  cost  of  land \nacquisition and resettlement is $2.6 million equivalent, inclusive of contingencies and taxes. \nThese costs are included within the total project costs. Compensation for land acquisition, \ndemolition of structures, and other costs will be paid directly to the affected entity or person \nthrough the project implementation unit of the respective PIA. According to the compensation \npolicies  and  standards  defined  in  the  resettlement  plan,  the  payment  and  usage  of \ncompensation funds will be undertaken under the supervision of the PPMO, with regular review \nby  an  independent  external  monitoring  agency.  The  funding  for  resettlement  costs  will  be \nprovided through the counterpart funds to be provided by each subborrower. Disbursements will \nbe monitored quarterly to ensure that full compensation has been paid in a timely manner. \n \n ", "    Appendix 11       67    \nE.  Information Disclosure and Public Participation \n \n13.  Preliminary  consultation  with  the  identified  affected  people  has  taken  place.  The \nsummary  of  the  Environmental  Assessment  Report  (May  2007)  describes  in  detail  the \nconsultation process, which included two rounds of public consultation on the Xixia Canal \nextension, plus other surveys and discussions. Detailed consultation will follow the detailed \ntechnical design.  \n \n14.  The resettlement plan was approved by ADB and posted on ADB website on 4 June \n2007. The plan was sent to the PPMO and PIAs for dissemination to the affected people who \nwere  informed  of  the  scope  of  the  Project,  land  compensation  and  resettlement,  their \nentitlements, and the procedure and timelines. Consultation and participation will be continued \nthrough subproject implementation, including signing compensation contracts and providing \nreplacement land. \n \nF.  Institutional Responsibilities \n \n15.  The PPMO will be responsible for planning, finance and administration, and project \nmanagement staff, as well as the focal point representatives and a group of technical experts. \nThe  PIAs  will  be  responsible  for  borrowing  and  repaying  the  loan,  the  use  of  Global \nEnvironment Facility funds, and Government counterpart funding.  \n \n16.  The  main  PIAs  are  (i)  Ningxia  Agricultural  Reclamation  Bureau,  (ii)  Ningxia  Water \nResources Department, (iii) Ningxia Administrative Bureau, and (iv) Yinchuan Municipality. \n \n17.  The PPMO has responsibility for ensuring procedures of the Government of the PRC, \nNHARG, and ADB are followed. The PIAs will be responsible for implementing resettlement \naccording to the resettlement plan and coordinating the planning, implementation, financing, \nand reporting of land acquisition and resettlement. The PIAs will take primary responsibility for \nthe resettlement consultation, implementation, and timely delivery of entitlements by appointing \na focal point to be in charge of all resettlement issues. \n \nG.  Grievance Procedures \n \n18.  Complaints  and  grievance  procedures  for  land  acquisition  in  the  PRC  are  well \nestablished. Affected people will be made aware of grievance procedures through participatory \nmeetings and through the resettlement information booklet provided to village leaders and those \naffected.  Where  no  agreement  is  reached  on  compensation  and/or  resettlement  costs, \ngrievances  can  be  lodged  with  the  village  committee.  If  no  agreement  is  reached  within  \n2  weeks,  the  complainant  has  1  month  to  elevate  the  grievances  to  the  county  land \nmanagement bureau or the PIA. If still unresolved within 2 weeks, the PPMO will try to achieve \na solution. The final redress would be sought, if necessary, in the civil courts, in accordance with \nthe Administrative Procedure Law of the PRC.  \n \nH.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n19.  Following  the  requirements  of  ADB,  compensation  and  resettlement  issues  will  be \nmonitored using both internal and external monitoring and evaluation. The monitoring is to \nestablish  that  affected  parties  or  villages  receive  compensation  for  resettlement  and \nrehabilitation. After completion of land acquisition and resettlement, the PPMO will prepare a \ncompletion report and submit it to ADB. \n \n ", "68     Appendix 11 \n20.  Internal resettlement monitoring will be carried out by the respective PIAs. During the \nland acquisition stage, the PPMO will collect records of impacts, compensation payments, \nemployment activities, training, and grievances. The PPMO will compile these individual project \nreports, as relevant, into an overall resettlement progress report for the subprojects and submit \nit to ADB as part of quarterly reporting on the Project until land acquisition and compensation \nactivities are completed.  \n \n21.  For external resettlement monitoring and evaluation, a local sociologist will be contracted \nfor 1 person-month per annum for 4 years to assess and report socioeconomic progress based \non independent monitoring and evaluation of land compensation activities. The monitoring and \nevaluation will be based on site visits and key informants. The independent monitor will assess \nwhether (i) project implementation is in compliance with the policies and entitlements set out in \nthe resettlement plan, (ii) the affected people have fully restored their livelihoods, and (iii) the \naffected  people  have  directly  benefited  from  the  Project.  The  monitor  should  make \nrecommendations  to  improve  implementation.  The  resettlement  monitoring  and  evaluation \nshould be carried out once every year and an annual report prepared for submission to ADB \nand the PPMO. \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20080808112038+08'00'", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Keywords": "environmental sustainability, sustainable economic growth, private sector development, agriculture natural resources, environment biodiversity, adb president reports recommendation, rrp: prc 38660, ningxia integrated ecosystem, agricultural development pr", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.0.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20080902111805+08'00'", "Title": "Ningxia Integrated Ecosystem and Agricultural Development Project"}, "author_page": " \nVice President  C.
