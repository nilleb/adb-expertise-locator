THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan from the ordinary capital resources of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) (A loan); and (ii) \na proposed loan funded by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Infrastructure \nFund (B loan), both to the Republic of Indonesia for the Integrated Participatory Development \nand Management of Irrigation Program.1 \n \n2.  The program will support the Government of Indonesia in implementing its irrigation \nimprovement  program  (IIP),  2015\u20132025,2 which  advances  the  overarching  agenda  of  food \nsecurity and rural poverty reduction through increased and improved water delivery.3 The focus \nof the ADB support will be on improving irrigation system operation, maintenance, and water \ndelivery to farmers. The program will finance a time slice of the government\u2019s IIP in 74 districts. \nThe International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) is providing parallel financing to the \nMinistry of Agriculture for improved delivery of agricultural services to maximize the benefits of \nthe irrigation improvements.4 \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Strategic Context   \n \n3.  Boosting rural incomes and improving food security are significant concerns in Indonesia. \nPoverty is still predominantly rural, with poverty rates in rural areas 1.8 times higher than in \nurban areas.5 Millions of people derive their incomes from food production, and food is the \nsingle largest expenditure item for the vast majority of households.6 Despite positive trends in \nagricultural production, Indonesia still faces rising food imports, higher domestic food prices, \nand sporadic food shortages. Key agricultural products include rice, soybean, corn, fruit, and \nvegetables. With most of the rice coming from irrigated areas, water resources and irrigation \nmanagement play an important role in the country\u2019s efforts to increase agricultural output.7 \nHowever, water availability to the farm community is erratic in many areas. The Ministry of \nPublic Works and Housing (MPWH)\u2014in charge of irrigation infrastructure\u2014estimates that only \n55% of the nation\u2019s irrigation system is functioning at full capacity, limiting yields and reducing \ncropping intensity.8 Irrigated agriculture is also sensitive to climate change. \n \n4.  Since  2006,  the  Directorate  General  of  Water  Resources  (DGWR),  MPWH,  has \nintroduced reforms to improve water delivery and operation and maintenance (O&M) services \n                                                      \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The IIP is a subprogram of the Sector Plan for Water Resources from the Ministry of Public Works and Housing. It \nis aligned with the 2015\u20132025 strategy for irrigation. Government of Indonesia, MPWH. 2011. Kebijakan Irigasi \nTahun, 2015\u20132025. Jakarta. \n3  The ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance for the Integrated Participatory Development and \nManagement of Irrigation Project for Western and Eastern Indonesia Phase 1 (TA 8460-INO).  \n4  IFAD  financing  of  \u20ac94.56  million  was  approved  in  December  2015  and  will  be  recorded  as  collaborative \ncofinancing. \n5  In 2016, 17.28 million people (14.0%) of people in rural areas fell below the rural poverty line of Rp350,420 per \ncapita  per  month.  Central  Bureau  of  Statistics.  2016  Profile  of  Poverty  in  Indonesia. \nhttps://bps.go.id/website/pdf_publikasi/Penghitungan-dan-Analisis-Kemiskinan-Makro-Indonesia-Tahun-2016--.pdf \n(accessed 7 April 2017). \n6  In 2015, agriculture contributed to 14% of the gross domestic product, with an estimated 39 million people working \nin the sector.

Jakarta. \n ", "2 \nand farmer\u2019s involvement by applying participatory irrigation management.9 In 2010, the DGWR \nestablished a directorate dedicated to O&M for water resources. Asset management and needs-\nbased budgeting (NBB) processes have been introduced to address the long-term sustainability \nof the infrastructure. In 2015, the DGWR institutionalized reforms introduced under the ADB-\nfinanced Participatory Irrigation Sector Project to improve sector performance.10 This provides a \nrobust regulatory framework for irrigation infrastructure, management, and O&M. \n \n5.  Since 2015, the implementation of the IIP has progressed with 834,000 hectares (ha) of \nirrigation  systems  rehabilitated,  460,000  ha  of  irrigation  infrastructure  inventoried  and  161 \nirrigation  commissions  established  nationwide.  However,  there  are  remaining  gaps  that \nconstrain effective implementation of the IIP. Institutions and processes need strengthening, \nespecially at the subnational level, to ensure sufficient budget allocation for routine O&M. To \nthis end, a sound irrigation asset management registry and better planning at the scheme level \nare required, as a basis for NBB and performance benchmarking. Water delivery services also \nneed improvements to provide the intended level of service and to cope with climate variability. \nIrrigation schemes need to be rehabilitated or upgraded to improve water efficiency and climate \nresilience.  Improving  irrigation  services  is  necessary  to  increase  rice  yields  and  cropping \nintensity, provide farmers with an incentive to diversify from low- to high-value crops, increase \nrural incomes, and enhance food security. Better integration between irrigation and agriculture is \nneeded to adapt to climate risks. \n \nB.  Program Rationale \n \n6.  The program is aligned with the government\u2019s long-term National Development Plan, \n2005\u2013202511 and National Medium-Term Development Plan, 2015\u20132019,12 in which water and \nfood security are priorities. To meet these national goals, the IIP calls for participatory irrigation \nmanagement,  better  asset  management  systems,  NBB,  strengthening  of  water  users \nassociations (WUAs) and water resources agencies (WRAs), and the rehabilitation of 3.2 million \nha  of  irrigation  systems. The  program  is  also  aligned  with  the  priorities  of  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership strategy, 2016\u20132019 for Indonesia.13 The program is included in ADB\u2019s country \noperations business plan, 2017\u20132019 for Indonesia. It is aligned with ADB\u2019s Water Operational \nPlan, 2011\u20132020 and Operational Plan for Agriculture and Natural Resources, 2015\u20132020.14 \n \n7.  This operation will be delivered using the results-based lending (RBL) modality because \nof (i) the strong government ownership of and commitment for the IIP; (ii) the nature of the \nprogram, which requires a results and system approach; (iii) the opportunity to leverage ADB \nfinancing  by  influencing  key  results  under  a  large  program;  and  (iv)  the  potential  for \nharmonization among development partners through a mutual focus on results. RBL is also a \nsuitable modality because it can (i) provide the most effective support by leveraging institutional \n                                                      \n9  Participatory irrigation management is a process that involves farmers and beneficiaries in the planning, design, \nconstruction, and operation and maintenance of irrigation systems.  \n10 ADB. 2003.

The  program  incorporates  the  key  recommendations  on  sustainability  from  the \nParticipatory Irrigation Sector Project: (i) strengthening institutional frameworks and improving \nimplementation  processes;  (ii)  facilitating  convergence  between  irrigation,  livelihood,  and \nagriculture interventions; (iii) incorporating irrigation development and management plans into \nregional plans; and (iv) enhancing the roles of communities and women in governance and \nservice delivery. 16 The program will also introduce innovations: (i) upgrading the irrigation asset \nmanagement information system (IAMIS) to a web-based and geospatial interface to facilitate \ndata management; (ii) introducing aerial surveys to reduce costs and improve the quality of the \nasset registry; (iii) preparing water accounting using satellite data to predict water availability \nand adjust engineering design; (iv) pilot testing water productivity measurement as a future \nvehicle  for  policy  making  and  improving  water  security;  and  (v)  improving  standards  for \nengineering design to integrate infrastructure, agriculture, and climate resilience. \n \nC.  Program Scope \n \n9.  The  RBL  program  will  strengthen  capacity  to  address  institutional  weaknesses, \norganizational  fragmentation,  and  weak  governance  to  improve  O&M  and  management  of \nirrigation systems. It will also improve water delivery to farmers by rehabilitating infrastructure. \nThis combination of measures will improve rural resilience and boost water resource productivity. \nIFAD\u2019s  support  will  complement  RBL  program  by  addressing  underperforming  extension \nservices, poor access to financial services, and inefficiencies in the value-chain and cropping \npatterns that contribute to low farm incomes.

Program Results   \n \n10.  The  RBL  program\u2019s  impacts  will  be  improved  rural  incomes  and  livelihoods,  and \nenhanced  food  security.  The  outcome  will  be  sustainable  and  more  productive  irrigated \nagriculture in 74 districts, as evidenced by the enhanced performance of irrigation systems (DLI \n1).17 An additional indicator on increased crop yield will reflect the convergence with agricultural \ninterventions  by  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  IFAD. 18  The  program  will  emphasize \nstrengthening  of  institutions  and  systems,  including  better  tracking  of  irrigation  system \nperformance. Increased farmer participation will help improve water delivery. Improved asset \nmanagement, NBB, and planning will improve O&M to ensure sustainability of the irrigation \ninfrastructure. The outcome will be achieved through three outputs. \n \n11.  Output 1: Systems and institutional capacity for sustainable irrigated agriculture \nstrengthened.  Output  1  will  support  institutional  measures  that  strengthen  the  planning, \nmanagement, and delivery of irrigation systems; and improve the linkage between irrigation \nservice  delivery  and  agricultural  development  support.  It  will  support  the  upgrading  of \n(i) engineering guidelines for irrigation infrastructure to improve water efficiency and climate \nresilience, and (ii) planning guidelines to ensure that irrigation and agriculture development are \nintegrated (DLI 2).19 DLI 3 measures the operationalization of irrigation commissions, which will \nimprove  subnational  institutional  capacities  for  integrating  agriculture  and  infrastructure \ndevelopment and O&M. Capitalizing on these strengthened institutions, this output will support \nthe process to incorporate irrigation development and management plans into regional plans as \ncaptured by DLI 4.20 A capacity development framework will be implemented and monitored \n(program action plan [PAP])21 to strengthen the capacity of river basin organizations (RBOs), \nWRAs, and subnational planning agencies to address weaknesses in implementing government \nsafeguards,  procurement,  financial  management,  gender  mainstreaming,  engineering,  and \nirrigation O&M and management processes.  \n \n12.  Output 2: Irrigation operation, maintenance, and management improved.

Crop \nyield will depend more on Ministry of Agriculture interventions than on the program, so it has not been made a DLI. \n19 Improved guidelines will benefit the IIP nationwide with an investment estimated at $6.4 billion for infrastructure. \n20 The irrigation development and management plan is approved with appropriate budget allocations by the district or \nprovince parliament. It then becomes part of the development policy and plan for that district and/or province. \n21 Program Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "5 \nfocuses on measures aimed at enhancing irrigation sustainability and resilience at the scheme \nlevel. Having a better understanding of the condition of the irrigation network is critical to this \neffort. Toward that end, the program will upgrade and update the IAMIS to cover 2.5 million ha \nof irrigated area using aerial surveys of assets and remote sensing technologies (DLI 5). This \nwill enable better linkages between asset management, sector budgeting, and planning. The \nparticipation  of  beneficiaries  is  central  in  improving  asset  management  and  water  service \ndelivery. Output 2 will enhance the role and participation of WUAs, including women and poor \nfarmers, in the planning, design and construction, and operation of irrigation infrastructure to \nimprove maintenance and management (DLI 6). Output 2 will also promote climate-resilient \npractices and provide training to farmers in water management.22 It will ensure the convergence \nof  irrigation,  livelihood,  and  agriculture  interventions  in  the  technical,  socioeconomic,  and \ninstitutional profiling of irrigation schemes as a basis for investments (DLI 7).  \n \n13.  Output 3: Irrigation infrastructure improved. The program will support infrastructure \nrehabilitation  and/or  upgrading.  Rehabilitation  will  address  design  shortcomings,  restore \neffective water service delivery, and improve water efficiency and climate resilience (DLI 8). To \nensure the technical soundness of investments, the program will confirm the reliability of water \nsources through water accounting. The combination of participatory approaches and technology \nwill lead to irrigation systems with improved efficiency that better serve the farm community. \nTable 2: Disbursement-Linked Indicators \nDisburseme Share of Total \nnt Allocated  ADB and AIF \nIndicator  ($ million)  Financing (%) \nOutcome: Sustainable and more productive irrigated agriculture in 74 districts     \nDLI 1: By 2021, performance of irrigation systems in the program area improved by  42.0  7.0 \nat least 15% from 2017 level \nOutput  1:  Systems  and  institutional  capacity  for  sustainable  irrigated     \nagriculture strengthened \nDLI  2:  Planning  and  engineering  guidelines  for  irrigation  delivery  systems  are  36.0  6.0 \nimproved by 2019 \nDLI 3: Irrigation commissions operationalized to enhance institutional capacity for  54.0  9.0 \nintegration and coordination of agriculture and infrastructure development in 74 \ndistricts and 14 provinces by 2021  \nDLI 4: At least 74 district irrigation development and management plans endorsed by  18.0  3.0 \ndistrict heads by 2021 \nOutput 2: Irrigation operation, maintenance, and management improved     \nDLI 5: Irrigation asset management improved for 2.5 million hectares of irrigation   138.0  23.0 \nsystems by 2021  24.0  4.0 \nDLI 6: Effective management of tertiary irrigation systems through operationalizing at \nleast 4,500 water users associations by 2021 \nDLI 7: Improved assessments integrating agriculture and infrastructure development  36.0  6.0 \nconducted for at least 719 priority schemes by 2021 \nOutput 3: Irrigation infrastructure improved     \nDLI  8:  Rehabilitated  irrigation  infrastructure  in  program  areas  increased  by  252.0  42.0 \n500,000 hectares by 2021 \nTotal  600.0  100.0 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, AIF = ASEAN Infrastructure Fund, ASEAN = Association of Southeast Asian \nNations, DLI = disbursement-linked indicator. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n14.

Program  financing.  The  government  is  expected  to  finance  $1,051  million.  The \ngovernment  has  requested  (i)  a  regular  loan  of  $500  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources (A loan) and (ii) a loan of $100 million funded from the ASEAN Infrastructure Fund (B \n                                                      \n24 Through the Local Government and Decentralization Project approved in September 2014, the World Bank is \nsupporting improvement of subnational governments\u2019 accountability and reporting of the specific allocation funds \nfor the basic infrastructure, including irrigation.

Based on the straight-line method, \nthe average maturity is 13 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. The B loan \nwill  have  a  17.5-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  an  annual  interest  rate \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on the \nstraight-line method, the average maturity is 13 years, and there is no maturity premium payable \nto ADB. The World Bank, through its Water Resources and Irrigation Sector Management \nProgram, will provide $28 million. The financing plan is summarized in Table 4. \n \nF.  Capacity Development and Program Action Plan \n \n18.  The program will strengthen the capacity of agencies involved in the IIP, especially at \nthe subnational level. A capacity development framework will be prepared, implemented, and \nmonitored. The PAP includes key actions in specific technical areas, governance and fiduciary \nmanagement, monitoring and evaluation (M&E), environment and social safeguards, and social \ninclusion and gender mainstreaming. The PAP will also strengthen government systems and \ninstitutions to manage performance and deliver results, notably in performance measurement, \nplanning, supervisory and monitoring mechanisms, and addressing gaps in relevant knowledge. \nThe government will procure consulting services to support the implementation of the PAP. \n \nG.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  The executing agency will be the DGWR, MPWH. National RBOs and provincial and \ndistrict WRAs\u2014as implementing agencies\u2014will deliver infrastructure investment and irrigation \nservices,  each  according  to  its  level  of  responsibility.26 Under  the  overall  guidance  of  the \nMinistry of Home Affairs, provincial and district planning agencies\u2014as implementing agencies\u2014 \nwill ensure institutional strengthening, planning, and internalization of O&M into five-year and \nannual plans.27 The program completion date is on 31 December 2022.28 \n \nIII.  SUMMARY OF ASSESSMENTS \n \nA.  Program Technical Assessments \n \n20.  The program\u2019s soundness was assessed according to its relevance, justification, and \nadequacy.29 The program is highly relevant to Indonesia\u2019s efforts to improve food security and \nfoster rural income growth. The program is designed to improve irrigation service reliability and \nsustainability. Program interventions are well-justified, focusing on key results to implement the \nIIP. The program addresses inefficiencies in the delivery of irrigation services by strengthening \nWRAs and increasing beneficiary participation. To maximize the benefits brought by improved \nwater  delivery,  the  program  will  align  irrigation  efforts  with  agriculture  development.  The \n                                                      \n25 The assessment of the government budgets (including projected provisions for the program) confirmed the ability \nof the government to meet financing requirements and, in time, to ensure no program implementation delays. \n26 Irrigation schemes of less than 1,000 ha are the responsibility of districts; irrigation schemes above 1,000 ha and \nbelow 3,000 ha are managed by provinces, while schemes above 3,000 ha are managed by national RBOs. \n27 The National Development Planning Agency will provide strategic and policy guidance. \n28 To enable verification and reimbursement of 2021 achievements and financial closing of the loans.  \n29 Program Soundness Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nprogram was screened for climate change risks and found to be at medium risk.30 The climate \nrisk  and  vulnerability  assessment  also  identifies  adaptation  measures.  Economic  benefits \ninclude  (i)  improved  farm  income  resulting  from  improved  yield,  cropping  intensity,  and \nagricultural development; and (ii) O&M cost savings owing to the improved IAMIS. 31 At the \nprogram level, the economic internal rate of return is 14%. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the \nprogram  is  robust  against  downside  risks.  Since  2011,  the  O&M  expenditure  for  national \nirrigation schemes has consistently increased. For subnational irrigation schemes, the provision \nfor O&M  expenditure  has  been  less  predictable,  the  program  will  help  the government to \nallocate the required funds for O&M. The IAMIS will bring substantial O&M cost savings and \nbudget allocation efficiency for the government. Consequently, the government will be able to \ndeliver more extensive irrigation maintenance services, with the same budget provision as set \nout under the IIP. To ensure long-term sustainability of the program, the government has agreed \nto allocate adequate funds for O&M of the irrigation schemes rehabilitated under the program.  \n \n21.  The program is categorized some gender elements. The primary beneficiaries of the \nprogram will be local farming communities, including poor women farmers, and agricultural \nworkers.  The  program  will  enhance  participation  and  decision-making  by  women  by                          \n(i) accelerating the capacity development of stakeholders, (ii) increasing the share of women in \nstrategic  positions,  (iii) ensuring  better  social  organization  of WUAs,  and  (iv) strengthening \ninstitutions for pro-poor monitoring and gender mainstreaming in the irrigation sector. \n \nB.  Program Systems Assessments \n \n22.  Monitoring and evaluation system. The M&E system assessment found that the M&E \nsystem  under  the  Directorate  of  Operation  and  Maintenance,  DGWR\u2014which  covers \ninfrastructure, O&M, WUA participation, institutional, and other aspects\u2014is the most appropriate \nto  monitor  program  implementation.  However,  reports  from  some  districts  with  weaker \ncapacities are delayed or incomplete. The program provides a unique opportunity to enhance \nand  strengthen  the  M&E  system  by  (i) upgrading  the  forms  to  ensure  that  all  indicators \npresented in the result frameworks are captured, (ii) improving the capacity of agencies to \ncomply with reporting requirements, (iii) preparing annual performance reports, and (iv) adopting \nthe IAMIS as the M&E system in the long term. The DGWR will consolidate and submit periodic \nprogress reports on the achievement of DLIs, PAP actions, and other performance indicators.  \n \n23.  Fiduciary systems. The fiduciary assessment confirms that the government financial \nmanagement,  procurement,  and  anticorruption  systems  are  adequate  with  some  mitigation \nmeasures.32 The financial management system assessment indicates a moderate fiduciary risk. \nWhile some financial management weaknesses and shortcomings have been identified, these \ncan be effectively addressed through the proposed mitigation measures. The assessments \nfound that (i) improvements were needed in planning and budgeting, (ii) further computerization \nwas  required  for  accounting  and  financial  reporting,  and  (iii)  the  capacity  of  implementing \nagencies should be strengthened. The PAP includes the following risk mitigation measures: (i) \nprovision  of  capacity  building  in  financial  management,  supported  by  consultants;  and  (ii) \npreparation of consolidated unaudited financial statements at the program level. \n \n24.  The  program  will  entail  the  procurement  of  civil  works,  goods,  consulting  services, \n                                                      \n30 Climate Risk Vulnerability Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n32 Program Fiduciary Systems Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nsurveys,  and  individual  facilitators.  Except  for  large  consulting  services  to  support  the \nimplementation of the program, it is unlikely that packages will attract international bidders. \nOverall, the legislative framework for goods, works, and smaller consulting packages\u2014where \nthe national market can meet the demand\u2014is largely adequate and incorporates internationally \nrecognized principles of public procurement. The procurement assessment has identified the \nfollowing risks: (i) low procurement capacity in some districts and provinces; (ii) procurement \ndelays owing to insufficient planning and late release of government budgets; (iii) large numbers \nof bids being disqualified for not meeting technical, administrative and commercial terms, which \nleads to suboptimal competition; (iv) inconsistent procurement monitoring across all procuring \nentities; and (v) barriers for the participation of international contractors and consultants. The \nrisks will be mitigated by (i) improving procurement reporting, (ii) ensuring that procurement \nactions  are  completed  early  each  year,  (iii)  conducting  procurement  and  probity  audits \nthroughout the program, (iv) procuring the large consulting services needed for the program \nunder the ADB-funded Accelerating Infrastructure Delivery through Better Engineering Services \nProject,33 outside the RBL program, and (v) conducting a value-for-money audit. The Guidelines \nto  Prevent  or  Mitigate  Fraud,  Corruption,  and  Other  Prohibited  Activities  in  Results-Based \nLending for Programs were explained to, and discussed with, the government.34 \n \n25.  Safeguard systems. The program is classified category B for environment, involuntary \nresettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples.35 The  program  safeguard  system  (PSS)  will  apply. \nPotential  environment  impacts  include  those  from  rehabilitation  of  irrigation  infrastructure, \nchanges in river morphology, and reduced water quality. Those impacts are reversible and site-\nspecific, and mitigation measures can be readily designed within the PSS. Rehabilitation works \nwill occur on existing irrigation canals that already have right-of-way. The works will not require \nany significant relocation of households or acquisition of productive assets. They might only \naffect crops and land temporally and cause temporary loss of income. Severe impacts on \nindigenous peoples are not envisaged. The PSS assessment revealed that the PSS is broadly \naligned with ADB\u2019s Safeguards Policy Statement (2009).36 The main gaps identified are (i) weak \nscreening and reporting; (ii) limited awareness of government\u2019s regulations on safeguards at the \nregional level because of rapid issuance of new regulations and guidance; and (iii) limited staff \nand budget for safeguards implementation. These gaps will be addressed through (i) upgrading \nof the screening procedures, and guidelines on environment assessment and management; (ii) \nimproving reporting and monitoring processes and capacity; (iii) institutional strengthening of \nenvironment and social safeguards units in RBOs and WRAs; and (iv) improving compensation \nand assistance to meet ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement principles. Environment and social \nsafeguard specialists and consultants will assist the government in implementing the PAP. \n \nC.  Integrated Risk Assessment and Mitigating Measures \n \n26.  An integrated risk assessment considered potential risks associated with (i) program \nresults, (ii) fiduciary and safeguards systems, and (iii) the operating environment. Major risks \nand mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5. The assessment concludes that benefits \n                                                      \n33 ADB.  2016.
