The program will finance a time slice of the government\u2019s IIP in 74 districts. \nThe International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) is providing parallel financing to the \nMinistry of Agriculture for improved delivery of agricultural services to maximize the benefits of \nthe irrigation improvements.4 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nStrategic Context   \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nBoosting rural incomes and improving food security are significant concerns in Indonesia. \nPoverty  is  still  predominantly  rural,  with  poverty  rates  in  rural  areas  1.8  times  higher  than  in \nurban  areas.5 Millions  of  people  derive  their  incomes  from  food  production,  and  food  is  the \nsingle  largest  expenditure  item  for  the  vast  majority  of  households.6 Despite  positive  trends  in \nagricultural  production,  Indonesia  still  faces  rising  food  imports,  higher  domestic  food  prices, \nand  sporadic  food  shortages.  Key  agricultural  products  include  rice,  soybean,  corn,  fruit,  and \nvegetables.  With  most  of  the  rice  coming  from  irrigated  areas,  water  resources  and  irrigation \nmanagement  play  an  important  role  in  the  country\u2019s  efforts  to  increase  agricultural  output.7 \nHowever,  water  availability  to  the  farm  community  is  erratic  in  many  areas.  The  Ministry  of \nPublic Works and Housing (MPWH)\u2014in charge of irrigation infrastructure\u2014estimates that only \n55% of the nation\u2019s irrigation system is functioning at full capacity, limiting yields and reducing \ncropping intensity.8 Irrigated agriculture is also sensitive to climate change. \n \n4. \nSince  2006,  the  Directorate  General  of  Water  Resources  (DGWR),  MPWH,  has \nintroduced  reforms  to  improve  water  delivery  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  services \n                                                      \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The IIP is a subprogram of the Sector Plan for Water Resources from the Ministry of Public Works and Housing. It \nis  aligned  with  the  2015\u20132025  strategy  for  irrigation.  Government  of  Indonesia,  MPWH.  2011.  Kebijakan  Irigasi \nTahun, 2015\u20132025.

Asset management and needs-\nbased budgeting (NBB) processes have been introduced to address the long-term sustainability \nof  the  infrastructure.  In  2015,  the  DGWR  institutionalized  reforms  introduced  under  the  ADB-\nfinanced Participatory Irrigation Sector Project to improve sector performance.10 This provides a \nrobust regulatory framework for irrigation infrastructure, management, and O&M. \n \n5. \nSince 2015, the implementation of the IIP has progressed with 834,000 hectares (ha) of \nirrigation  systems  rehabilitated,  460,000  ha  of  irrigation  infrastructure  inventoried  and  161 \nirrigation  commissions  established  nationwide.  However,  there  are  remaining  gaps  that \nconstrain  effective  implementation  of  the  IIP.  Institutions  and  processes  need  strengthening, \nespecially  at  the  subnational  level,  to  ensure  sufficient  budget  allocation  for  routine  O&M.  To \nthis end, a sound irrigation asset management registry and better planning at the scheme level \nare required, as a basis for NBB and performance benchmarking. Water delivery services also \nneed improvements to provide the intended level of service and to cope with climate variability. \nIrrigation schemes need to be rehabilitated or upgraded to improve water efficiency and climate \nresilience.  Improving  irrigation  services  is  necessary  to  increase  rice  yields  and  cropping \nintensity, provide farmers with an incentive to diversify from low- to high-value crops, increase \nrural incomes, and enhance food security. Better integration between irrigation and agriculture is \nneeded to adapt to climate risks. \n \nB. \n \n6. \nThe  program  is  aligned  with  the  government\u2019s  long-term  National  Development  Plan, \n2005\u2013202511 and  National  Medium-Term  Development  Plan,  2015\u20132019,12 in  which  water  and \nfood security are priorities. To meet these national goals, the IIP calls for participatory irrigation \nmanagement,  better  asset  management  systems,  NBB,  strengthening  of  water  users \nassociations (WUAs) and water resources agencies (WRAs), and the rehabilitation of 3.2 million \nha  of  irrigation  systems.  The  program  is  also  aligned  with  the  priorities  of  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership  strategy,  2016\u20132019  for  Indonesia.13 The  program  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country \noperations business plan, 2017\u20132019 for Indonesia. It is aligned with ADB\u2019s Water Operational \nPlan, 2011\u20132020 and Operational Plan for Agriculture and Natural Resources, 2015\u20132020.14 \n \n7. \nThis operation will be delivered using the results-based lending (RBL) modality because \nof  (i)  the  strong  government  ownership  of  and  commitment  for  the  IIP;  (ii)  the  nature  of  the \nprogram,  which  requires  a  results  and  system  approach;  (iii)  the  opportunity  to  leverage  ADB \nfinancing  by  influencing  key  results  under  a  large  program;  and  (iv)  the  potential  for \nharmonization  among  development  partners  through  a  mutual  focus  on  results.

It  will  also  improve  water  delivery  to farmers  by rehabilitating  infrastructure. \nThis combination of measures will improve rural resilience and boost water resource productivity. \nIFAD\u2019s  support  will  complement  RBL  program  by  addressing  underperforming  extension \nservices,  poor  access  to  financial  services,  and  inefficiencies  in  the  value-chain  and  cropping \npatterns that contribute to low farm incomes.

The  outcome  will  be  sustainable  and  more  productive  irrigated \nagriculture in 74 districts, as evidenced by the enhanced performance of irrigation systems (DLI \n1).17 An additional indicator on increased crop yield will reflect the convergence with agricultural \ninterventions  by  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  IFAD. 18  The  program  will  emphasize \nstrengthening  of  institutions  and  systems,  including  better  tracking  of  irrigation  system \nperformance.  Increased  farmer  participation  will  help  improve  water  delivery.  Improved  asset \nmanagement,  NBB,  and  planning  will  improve  O&M  to  ensure  sustainability  of  the  irrigation \ninfrastructure. The outcome will be achieved through three outputs. \n \n11. \nOutput  1:  Systems  and  institutional  capacity  for  sustainable  irrigated  agriculture \nstrengthened.  Output  1  will  support  institutional  measures  that  strengthen  the  planning, \nmanagement,  and  delivery  of  irrigation  systems;  and  improve  the  linkage  between  irrigation \nservice  delivery  and  agricultural  development  support.  It  will  support  the  upgrading  of \n(i) engineering  guidelines  for  irrigation  infrastructure  to  improve  water  efficiency  and  climate \nresilience, and (ii) planning guidelines to ensure that irrigation and agriculture development are \nintegrated (DLI 2).19 DLI 3 measures the operationalization of irrigation commissions, which will \nimprove  subnational  institutional  capacities  for  integrating  agriculture  and  infrastructure \ndevelopment and O&M. Capitalizing on these strengthened institutions, this output will support \nthe process to incorporate irrigation development and management plans into regional plans as \ncaptured  by  DLI  4.20 A  capacity  development  framework  will  be  implemented  and  monitored \n(program  action  plan  [PAP])21 to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  river  basin  organizations  (RBOs), \nWRAs, and subnational planning agencies to address weaknesses in implementing government \nsafeguards,  procurement,  financial  management,  gender  mainstreaming,  engineering,  and \nirrigation O&M and management processes.  \n \n12. \n                                                      \n17 The government\u2019s irrigation performance index measures improvements in infrastructure, water efficiency, cropping \nintensity, WUA participation, and other supporting factors required for sustainable and more productive agriculture.  \n18 Cropping intensity is the number of times a crop is planted per year in a given agricultural area, while crop yield for \nrice refers to the weight of rice, at agreed standard moisture content, per unit of land area harvested for rice. Crop \nyield will depend more on Ministry of Agriculture interventions than on the program, so it has not been made a DLI. \n\nOutput  2: Irrigation  operation,  maintenance, and  management improved. Output 2 \n\n19 Improved guidelines will benefit the IIP nationwide with an investment estimated at $6.4 billion for infrastructure. \n20 The irrigation development and management plan is approved with appropriate budget allocations by the district or \n\nprovince parliament. It then becomes part of the development policy and plan for that district and/or province. \n\n21 Program Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\nfocuses on measures aimed at enhancing irrigation sustainability and resilience at the scheme \nlevel.  Having  a  better  understanding  of  the  condition  of  the  irrigation  network  is  critical  to  this \neffort. Toward that end, the program will upgrade and update the IAMIS to cover 2.5 million ha \nof  irrigated  area  using  aerial  surveys  of  assets  and  remote  sensing  technologies  (DLI  5). This \nwill  enable  better  linkages  between  asset  management,  sector  budgeting,  and  planning.  The \nparticipation  of  beneficiaries  is  central  in  improving  asset  management  and  water  service \ndelivery. Output 2 will enhance the role and participation of WUAs, including women and poor \nfarmers,  in  the  planning,  design  and  construction,  and  operation  of  irrigation  infrastructure  to \nimprove  maintenance  and  management  (DLI  6).

The  program  will  support  infrastructure \nrehabilitation  and/or  upgrading.  Rehabilitation  will  address  design  shortcomings,  restore \neffective water service delivery, and improve water efficiency and climate resilience (DLI 8). To \nensure the technical soundness of investments, the program will confirm the reliability of water \nsources through water accounting. The combination of participatory approaches and technology \nwill lead to irrigation systems with improved efficiency that better serve the farm community. \n\nTable 2: Disbursement-Linked Indicators \n\nDisburseme\nnt Allocated \n($ million) \n \n42.0 \n\nShare of Total \nADB and AIF \nFinancing (%) \n \n\n \n\n \n\n6.0 \n\n7.0 \n\n36.0 \n\n54.0 \n\nirrigated \n\ninstitutional  capacity  for  sustainable \n\nIndicator \nOutcome: Sustainable and more productive irrigated agriculture in 74 districts \nDLI 1: By 2021, performance of irrigation systems in the program area improved by \nat least 15% from 2017 level \nOutput  1:  Systems  and \nagriculture strengthened \nDLI  2:  Planning  and  engineering  guidelines  for  irrigation  delivery  systems  are \nimproved by 2019 \nDLI  3:  Irrigation  commissions  operationalized  to  enhance  institutional  capacity  for \nintegration  and  coordination  of  agriculture  and  infrastructure  development  in  74 \ndistricts and 14 provinces by 2021  \nDLI 4: At least 74 district irrigation development and management plans endorsed by \ndistrict heads by 2021 \nOutput 2: Irrigation operation, maintenance, and management improved \nDLI 5: Irrigation asset management improved for 2.5 million hectares of irrigation  \nsystems by 2021 \nDLI 6: Effective management of tertiary irrigation systems through operationalizing at \nleast 4,500 water users associations by 2021 \nDLI 7: Improved assessments integrating agriculture and infrastructure development \nconducted for at least 719 priority schemes by 2021 \nOutput 3: Irrigation infrastructure improved \nDLI  8:  Rehabilitated  irrigation  infrastructure  in  program  areas  increased  by \n500,000 hectares by 2021 \nTotal \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  AIF  =  ASEAN  Infrastructure  Fund,  ASEAN  =  Association  of  Southeast  Asian \nNations, DLI = disbursement-linked indicator. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n14. \n\nThe  RBL  program  has  a  robust  and  comprehensive  results  framework. 23  The  DLIs \n\n \n138.0 \n24.0 \n\n \n23.0 \n4.0 \n\n \n252.0 \n\n \n42.0 \n\n600.0 \n\n100.0 \n\n36.0 \n\n18.0 \n\n9.0 \n\n3.0 \n\n6.0 \n\n                                                      \n22 IFAD  will  also  promote  climate-resilient  practices  and  provide  training  to  farmers  in  production,  soil  and  crop \n\nmanagement, improved planting methods, and improved pest and harvest management. \n23 Program Results Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fcomprise critical institutional output and outcome indicators to improve institutional and systemic \ncapacity and irrigation infrastructure.

The  government  is  expected  to  finance  $1,051  million.  The \n17. \ngovernment  has  requested  (i)  a  regular  loan  of  $500  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources (A loan) and (ii) a loan of $100 million funded from the ASEAN Infrastructure Fund (B \n                                                      \n24 Through  the  Local  Government  and  Decentralization  Project  approved  in  September  2014,  the  World  Bank  is \nsupporting  improvement  of subnational  governments\u2019  accountability  and  reporting of  the specific  allocation  funds \nfor the basic infrastructure, including irrigation.

Based  on the  straight-line  method, \nthe average maturity is 13 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. The B loan \nwill  have  a  17.5-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  an  annual  interest  rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on the \nstraight-line method, the average maturity is 13 years, and there is no maturity premium payable \nto  ADB.  The  World  Bank,  through  its  Water  Resources  and  Irrigation  Sector  Management \nProgram, will provide $28 million. The financing plan is summarized in Table 4. \n \nF. \n \n18. \nThe  program  will  strengthen  the  capacity  of  agencies  involved  in  the  IIP,  especially  at \nthe  subnational  level.  A  capacity  development  framework  will  be  prepared,  implemented,  and \nmonitored. The PAP includes key actions in specific technical areas, governance and fiduciary \nmanagement, monitoring and evaluation (M&E), environment and social safeguards, and social \ninclusion  and  gender  mainstreaming.  The  PAP  will  also  strengthen  government  systems  and \ninstitutions  to  manage  performance  and  deliver  results,  notably  in  performance  measurement, \nplanning, supervisory and monitoring mechanisms, and addressing gaps in relevant knowledge. \nThe government will procure consulting services to support the implementation of the PAP. \n \nG. \n \n19. \nThe  executing  agency  will  be  the  DGWR,  MPWH.  National  RBOs  and  provincial  and \ndistrict  WRAs\u2014as  implementing  agencies\u2014will  deliver  infrastructure  investment  and  irrigation \nservices,  each  according  to  its  level  of  responsibility. 26  Under  the  overall  guidance  of  the \nMinistry of Home Affairs, provincial and district planning agencies\u2014as implementing agencies\u2014 \nwill  ensure  institutional  strengthening,  planning,  and  internalization  of  O&M  into  five-year  and \nannual plans.27 The program completion date is on 31 December 2022.28 \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nIII. \n\nSUMMARY OF ASSESSMENTS \n\nProgram Technical Assessments \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  program\u2019s  soundness  was  assessed  according  to  its  relevance,  justification,  and \n20. \nadequacy.29 The  program is  highly  relevant to  Indonesia\u2019s  efforts to  improve  food  security  and \nfoster rural income growth. The program is designed to improve irrigation service reliability and \nsustainability. Program interventions are well-justified, focusing on key results to implement the \nIIP. The program addresses inefficiencies in the delivery of irrigation services by strengthening \nWRAs  and  increasing  beneficiary  participation. To  maximize  the  benefits  brought  by  improved \nwater  delivery,  the  program  will  align  irrigation  efforts  with  agriculture  development.  The \n\n                                                      \n25 The assessment of the government budgets (including projected provisions for the program) confirmed the ability \n\nof the government to meet financing requirements and, in time, to ensure no program implementation delays. \n\n26 Irrigation schemes of less than 1,000 ha are the responsibility of districts; irrigation schemes above 1,000 ha and \n\nbelow 3,000 ha are managed by provinces, while schemes above 3,000 ha are managed by national RBOs. \n\n27 The National Development Planning Agency will provide strategic and policy guidance. \n28 To enable verification and reimbursement of 2021 achievements and financial closing of the loans.  \n29 Program Soundness Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fProgram Systems Assessments \n\nprogram was screened for climate change risks and found to be at medium risk.30 The climate \nrisk  and  vulnerability  assessment  also  identifies  adaptation  measures.  Economic  benefits \ninclude  (i)  improved  farm  income  resulting  from  improved  yield,  cropping  intensity,  and \nagricultural  development;  and  (ii)  O&M  cost  savings  owing  to  the  improved  IAMIS. 31 At  the \nprogram level, the economic internal rate of return is 14%. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the \nprogram  is  robust  against  downside  risks.  Since  2011,  the  O&M  expenditure  for  national \nirrigation schemes has consistently increased. For subnational irrigation schemes, the provision \nfor  O&M  expenditure  has  been  less  predictable,  the  program  will  help  the  government  to \nallocate  the  required  funds  for  O&M.  The  IAMIS  will  bring  substantial  O&M  cost  savings  and \nbudget  allocation  efficiency  for  the  government.  Consequently,  the  government  will  be  able  to \ndeliver  more  extensive  irrigation  maintenance  services,  with  the  same  budget  provision  as  set \nout under the IIP. To ensure long-term sustainability of the program, the government has agreed \nto allocate adequate funds for O&M of the irrigation schemes rehabilitated under the program.  \n \n21. \nThe  program  is  categorized  some  gender  elements.  The  primary  beneficiaries  of  the \nprogram  will  be  local  farming  communities,  including  poor  women  farmers,  and  agricultural \nworkers.  The  program  will  enhance  participation  and  decision-making  by  women  by                          \n(i) accelerating the capacity development of stakeholders, (ii) increasing the share of women in \nstrategic  positions,  (iii) ensuring  better  social  organization  of  WUAs,  and  (iv)  strengthening \ninstitutions for pro-poor monitoring and gender mainstreaming in the irrigation sector. \n \nB. \n \n22.  Monitoring and evaluation system. The M&E system assessment found that the M&E \nthe  Directorate  of  Operation  and  Maintenance,  DGWR\u2014which  covers \nsystem  under \ninfrastructure, O&M, WUA participation, institutional, and other aspects\u2014is the most appropriate \nto  monitor  program  implementation.  However,  reports  from  some  districts  with  weaker \ncapacities  are  delayed  or  incomplete.  The  program  provides  a  unique  opportunity  to  enhance \nand  strengthen  the  M&E  system  by  (i) upgrading  the  forms  to  ensure  that  all  indicators \npresented  in  the  result  frameworks  are  captured,  (ii)  improving  the  capacity  of  agencies  to \ncomply with reporting requirements, (iii) preparing annual performance reports, and (iv) adopting \nthe IAMIS as the M&E system in the long term. The DGWR will consolidate and submit periodic \nprogress reports on the achievement of DLIs, PAP actions, and other performance indicators.  \n \n23. \nFiduciary  systems.  The  fiduciary  assessment  confirms  that  the  government  financial \nmanagement,  procurement,  and  anticorruption  systems  are  adequate  with  some  mitigation \nmeasures.32 The financial management system assessment indicates a moderate fiduciary risk. \nWhile  some  financial  management  weaknesses  and  shortcomings  have  been  identified,  these \ncan  be  effectively  addressed  through  the  proposed  mitigation  measures.  The  assessments \nfound that (i) improvements were needed in planning and budgeting, (ii) further computerization \nwas  required  for  accounting  and  financial  reporting,  and  (iii)  the  capacity  of  implementing \nagencies should be strengthened. The PAP includes the following risk mitigation measures: (i) \nprovision  of  capacity  building  in  financial  management,  supported  by  consultants;  and  (ii) \npreparation of consolidated unaudited financial statements at the program level. \n \n24. \n\nThe  program  will  entail  the  procurement  of  civil  works,  goods,  consulting  services, \n\n                                                      \n30 Climate Risk Vulnerability Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n32 Program Fiduciary Systems Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nsurveys,  and  individual  facilitators.  Except  for  large  consulting  services  to  support  the \nimplementation  of  the  program,  it  is  unlikely  that  packages  will  attract  international  bidders. \nOverall,  the  legislative  framework  for  goods,  works,  and  smaller  consulting  packages\u2014where \nthe national market can meet the demand\u2014is largely adequate and incorporates internationally \nrecognized  principles  of  public  procurement.  The  procurement  assessment  has  identified  the \nfollowing  risks:  (i)  low  procurement  capacity  in  some  districts  and  provinces;  (ii)  procurement \ndelays owing to insufficient planning and late release of government budgets; (iii) large numbers \nof bids being disqualified for not meeting technical, administrative and commercial terms, which \nleads  to  suboptimal  competition;  (iv)  inconsistent  procurement  monitoring  across  all  procuring \nentities;  and  (v)  barriers  for  the  participation  of  international  contractors  and  consultants.  The \nrisks  will  be  mitigated  by  (i)  improving  procurement  reporting,  (ii) ensuring  that  procurement \nactions  are  completed  early  each  year,  (iii)  conducting  procurement  and  probity  audits \nthroughout  the  program,  (iv)  procuring  the  large  consulting  services  needed  for  the  program \nunder the ADB-funded Accelerating Infrastructure Delivery through Better Engineering Services \nProject,33 outside the RBL program, and (v) conducting a value-for-money audit. The Guidelines \nto  Prevent  or  Mitigate  Fraud,  Corruption,  and  Other  Prohibited  Activities  in  Results-Based \nLending for Programs were explained to, and discussed with, the government.34 \n\n \n25. \nSafeguard  systems. The program is classified category B for environment, involuntary \nresettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples. 35  The  program  safeguard  system  (PSS)  will  apply. \nPotential  environment  impacts  include  those  from  rehabilitation  of  irrigation  infrastructure, \nchanges in river morphology, and reduced water quality. Those impacts are reversible and site-\nspecific, and mitigation measures can be readily designed within the PSS. Rehabilitation works \nwill occur on existing irrigation canals that already have right-of-way. The works will not require \nany  significant  relocation  of  households  or  acquisition  of  productive  assets.  They  might  only \naffect  crops  and  land  temporally  and  cause  temporary  loss  of  income.  Severe  impacts  on \nindigenous peoples are not envisaged. The PSS assessment revealed that the PSS is broadly \naligned with ADB\u2019s Safeguards Policy Statement (2009).36 The main gaps identified are (i) weak \nscreening and reporting; (ii) limited awareness of government\u2019s regulations on safeguards at the \nregional level because of rapid issuance of new regulations and guidance; and (iii) limited staff \nand budget for safeguards implementation. These gaps will be addressed through (i) upgrading \nof the screening procedures, and guidelines on environment assessment and management; (ii) \nimproving  reporting  and  monitoring  processes  and  capacity;  (iii)  institutional  strengthening  of \nenvironment and social safeguards units in RBOs and WRAs; and (iv) improving compensation \nand  assistance to meet ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  principles.  Environment  and  social \nsafeguard specialists and consultants will assist the government in implementing the PAP. \n \nC. \n \n26. \nAn  integrated  risk  assessment  considered  potential  risks  associated  with  (i)  program \nresults,  (ii)  fiduciary  and  safeguards  systems,  and  (iii)  the  operating  environment. Major  risks \nand mitigating measures  are  summarized  in Table  5. The  assessment  concludes  that  benefits \n\nIntegrated Risk Assessment and Mitigating Measures \n\n                                                      \n33 ADB.  2016.

The 6 criteria are \nmeasured and weighted for every irrigation scheme as follows: (i) functioning \ninfrastructure (45%); (ii) agriculture productivity (15%); (iii) supporting facilities for \nO&M (10%); (iv) adequacy of human resources for O&M (15%); (v) adequacy of \ndata and information (5%); (vi) water user association participation (10%).  \n \nDGWR has a system for measuring this index that involves collection of field \ndata in a series of forms. \n \nBaseline: The IKSI is measured for irrigation schemes under national authority \nin the program area. In 2015, the average IKSI for national schemes in the \nprogram area was 60%. There is no baseline for subnational schemes. \n \n\u201cProgram area\u201d means irrigation schemes of more than 400 ha and 10 irrigation \nschemes with an area of less than 200 ha included in the selected 74 districts \nacross 16 provinces.  \n \nThe definition of targets each year is geared towards strengthening the IKSI \nmonitoring to be able to (a) set baseline data for 2017, (b) ensure the channels \nfor regular data collection and annual report are well established and produce \nannual reports by 2018, and (c) start tracking performance index improvement in \n2019, 2020, and 2021. This system will be combined with the IAMIS described in \nDLI 5, when complete.   \n \nConditions for disbursement are met if the target specified each year is \nachieved.  \n \nPartial disbursement: The DLI is scalable and partial disbursement is allowed. \nIf the target for each year is not met, then disbursement can be proportional to \nthe increase made (e.g., if an improvement in IKSI for the program area is \nincreased by only half the target set, then 50% of the planned disbursement for \nthat year can be made).  \n \nDisbursements are allowed for early or late achievement of the DLI.
