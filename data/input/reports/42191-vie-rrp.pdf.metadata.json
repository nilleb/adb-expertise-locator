A  review  of  its \nenvironmental implications indicates that several actions included in \nthe  policy  framework  of  this  subprogram  are  likely  to  have  positive \nenvironmental \nimpact.  Enhancement  measures  have  been \ndeveloped  to  optimize  this  positive  impact.  No  action  has  been \nidentified as likely to have a negative environmental impact. \n \nThe proposed program cluster will help the Government of Viet Nam \ncarry  out  policy  reforms  that  are  needed  for  the  successful \nimplementation  of  the  poverty  reduction  program  embedded  in  the \nSocioeconomic Development Plan (SEDP) 2006\u20132010. To this end, \nSIPRP V will provide parallel financing with the World Bank\u2019s poverty \nreduction  support  credits  (PRSCs)  7\u20139  within  the  framework  of  the \nPRSC process.  \n \nSubprogram  1  will  provide  parallel  financing  with  PRSC  7  and \nsupport  actions  included  in  its  policy  matrix.  The  Government,  the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  the  World  Bank,  and  other \ndevelopment agencies participating in the PRSC process agreed on \nthe  policy  matrix  for  PRSC  7  after  a  series  of  consultations  in  2007 \nand  in  the  first  half  of  2008.  The  policy  matrix  is  based  on  the \nGovernment\u2019s reform agenda and includes a wide spectrum of policy \nactions  in  business  development,  social  inclusion,  natural  resource \nmanagement,  and  governance.  Subprogram  1  will  focus  on  those \nactions  in  the  policy  matrix  for  PRSC  7  that  complement  policy \nactions supported by ADB\u2019s other program loans to Viet Nam or are \notherwise important to ADB\u2019s operations in this country.  \n \nViet  Nam  has  made  remarkable  progress  in  poverty  reduction  over \nthe last 15 years by carrying out a broad range of policy reforms to \nfoster  sustainable  and  inclusive  economic  growth  and  strengthen \nsocial  protection.  Since  2002,  an  increasing  number  of  multilateral \nand  bilateral  development  agencies  have  supported  these  reforms \nthrough the World Bank\u2013led PRSC process. \n \nThe PRSC process comprises several closely related activities jointly \nundertaken each year by participating development agencies to help \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \n\nfor \n\nthe  Government  carry  out  policy  reforms  needed  for  the  successful \nimplementation  of  its  poverty  reduction  strategy.  The  process \ninvolves  the  preparation  of  Viet  Nam  development  reports  by \nparticipating  agencies,  consultations  on  the  policy  matrices  for \nPRSCs  among  participating  agencies  and  between  these  agencies \nand  the  Government,  and  general  budget  support  (in  the  form  of \ngrants and concessional loans) to Viet Nam by participating agencies \nto  cover  some  of the  costs  of  the  policy  reforms  to  the  budget. The \nthe  participating \nWorld  Bank  coordinates  PRSC  activities \ndevelopment agencies. \n \nADB  joined  the  PRSC  process  in  2003  and  has  taken  part  in  all \nPRSC  activities  since  then.  In  2004\u20132007,  ADB  approved  four \nsingle-tranche  standard  program  loans  (one  loan  every  year)  to \nViet Nam to support, through the PRSC process, the implementation \nof  the  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  programs.  SIPRPs  I\u2013III \nprovided  parallel  financing  with  the  World  Bank\u2019s  PRSCs 3\u20135, \nrespectively,  in  support  of  the  implementation  of  the  Government\u2019s \nComprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy 2002\u20132010. \nSIPRP  IV  provided  parallel  financing  with  PRSC 6  in  support  of the \nimplementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010. \n \nWith SIPRP V, ADB will stay involved in the PRSC process through \n2010,  that  is,  until  the  implementation  of  SEDP  2006\u20132010  is \ncompleted.  This  will  enable  ADB  to  promote,  with  relatively  modest \nfinancing, a wide spectrum of policy reforms that are essential for the \nsuccessful  implementation  of  SEDP  2006\u20132010.  Consequently,  the \nproposed  program  cluster  will  help  ADB  achieve  the  strategic \nobjective  of  its  country  strategy  and  program  2007\u20132010  for \nViet Nam,  which  is  to  help  the  Government  reduce  the  poverty  rate \nto  10%\u201311%  by  2010  through  the  successful  implementation  of \nSEDP 2006\u20132010.  \n \nFurthermore,  continued  participation  in  the  PRCS  process  will \nprovide  ADB  with  another  means  of  coordinating  its  activities  in \nViet Nam  with  those  of  other  development  agencies.  SIPRP V  will \nhelp  ADB  fulfill  its  obligations  under  the  Rome  Declaration  on \nHarmonization  (2003),  the  Paris  Declaration  on  Aid  Effectiveness \n(2005), and the Hanoi Core Statement on Aid Effectiveness (2005).  \n \nThe intended impact of SIPRP V is a continued reduction in poverty \nin Viet Nam in 2008\u20132010 and beyond. Its expected outcome is the \nsuccessful  implementation  of  the  Government\u2019s  SEDP  2006\u20132010, \nwhich  will  not  only  reduce  poverty  in  2006\u20132010  but  also  improve \nthe \nViet  Nam\u2019s  economic  competitiveness  and  strengthen \nfoundations  for  sustainable  and  inclusive  growth  and  a  continued \nreduction in poverty beyond 2010. \n \nSome  of  the  actions  that  are  included  in  the  policy  framework  of \nsubprogram 1 of SIPRP V entail substantial costs to Viet Nam\u2019s state \nbudget.  The  actions  included  in  the  policy  matrix  for  PRSC  7  are \n\n\f \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nLoan Amount and \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nDisbursement \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \n\n \n\niii \n\nestimated to cost the state budget $450 million in 2008 and 2009.  \n \nThe  World  Bank  has  already  approved  PRSC  7  amounting  to \n$150 million  from  the  International  Development  Association.  A \ndozen  other  development  agencies  participating  in  the  PRSC \nprocess  (including  ADB)  are  expected \nto  provide  grants  or \nconcessional  loans  totaling  about  $200  million  in  cofinancing  or \nparallel financing with PRSC 7. The remaining costs to the budget of \nthe actions included in the policy matrix for PRSC 7 will be covered \nby the Government. \n \nIt is proposed that a loan in various currencies equivalent to Special \nDrawing  Rights  16,439,000  be  provided  for  subprogram  1  from \nADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources.  The  loan  will  have  a  term  of \n24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; an interest rate of 1.0% \nduring the grace period and 1.5% during the amortization period; and \nother terms and conditions set forth in the Loan Agreement. The loan \nproceeds  may  be  used  to  finance  eligible  imports  incurred  within \n180 days before the date of loan effectiveness.  \n \nThe loan will be fully utilized by 31 December 2009. \n \nAll  actions  included  in  the  policy  framework  of  subprogram  1  have \nbeen completed. Therefore, the proposed loan will be disbursed in a \nsingle tranche once the loan is declared effective. \n \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  used to finance the full foreign  exchange \ncosts  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  and \nprocured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and \nimports  financed  from  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  As \nprovided  in  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and \nRelated  Requirements  for  Program  Loans  (1998),  the  proceeds  of \nthe  program  loan  will  be  disbursed  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of \nViet Nam  as  the  Borrower.  No supporting  import  documentation  will \nbe required provided that the value of Viet Nam\u2019s total imports minus \nimports  from  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and  imports \nfinanced under other official development assistance is at least equal \nto  the  amount  of  the  loan  to  be  disbursed.  The  Government  will \ncertify  its  compliance  with  this  formula  with  its  withdrawal  request. \nOtherwise,  import  documentation  under  existing  procedures  will  be \nrequired.  ADB  will  have  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  loan  proceeds \nand  to  verify  the  accuracy  of  the  Borrower\u2019s  certification.  As  such, \nthe procedures for procurement and disbursement of funds, and the \nuse of counterpart funds, are felt to be satisfactory. \n \nThe State Bank of Viet Nam (SBV) will be the Executing Agency for \nthe  proposed  program  cluster.  SBV  hosts  the  PRSC  coordination \nunit,  which  facilitates  interactions  between  the  Government  and \ndevelopment  agencies  within  the  framework  of  the  PRSC  process. \nSBV was also the Executing Agency for SIPRPs I\u2013IV. \n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nLoans for \nSubprograms 2 and 3 \n\n \nProgram Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nAssumptions and \nRisks  \n\n \n\nA loan for subprogram 2 will be proposed to the Board of Directors in \n2009 and a loan for subprogram 3 will be proposed in 2010 after the \npolicy  actions  to  be  covered  by  the  subprogram  concerned  are \ncompleted. Tentatively, the amounts (in US dollars) and the terms of \nthese  loans  will  be  the  same  as  those  of  the  proposed  loan  for \nsubprogram  1.  Hence,  the  tentative  total  amount  of  the  proposed \nprogram cluster will be $75.0 million.  \n \nThe  policy  reforms  that  the  proposed  program  cluster  will  advance \nwill yield considerable economic benefits to Viet Nam. They will raise \nthe living standards of the Vietnamese people and reduce poverty by \nfostering  environmentally  sustainable  and  socially \ninclusive \neconomic  growth.  The  policy  reforms  in  the  area  of  social  inclusion \nwill be particularly beneficial to the poor and the near-poor.  \n \nThe policy reforms supported by SIPRP V will also increase budget \nrevenue  by  expanding  the  tax  base,  and  will  reduce  budget \nexpenditure  by  improving  public  finance  management.  Over  the \nmedium  term,  the  financial  benefits  of  these  reforms  to  the \nGovernment are likely to exceed their costs (including interest to be \npaid on loans received from various development agencies within the \nframework of the PRSC process). \n \nThe  proposed  program  cluster  will  support  policy  actions  that \nconstitute  critical  steps  in  policy  reforms  needed  for  the  successful \nimplementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010 and are particularly relevant to \nADB\u2019s  operations  in  Viet  Nam. The  reforms,  however,  must  be fully \ncarried  out  if  SEDP  2006\u20132010  is  to  be  successfully  implemented. \nTherefore,  it  is  assumed  that,  after  completing  the  policy  actions \ncovered  by  SIPRP  V  and  the  other  actions  included  in  the  policy \nmatrices for PRSCs 7\u20139, the Government will follow through with the \npolicy  reforms  needed  for  the  successful  implementation  of  SEDP \n2006\u20132010 on its own or with the support of development agencies \nunder  other  projects.  It  is  further  assumed  that  the  investment \nprojects  that  are  included  in  SEDP 2006\u20132010  and  necessary  for \nattaining its targets and goals will be implemented on schedule.  \n \nThese  assumptions  are based  on  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to \ncarry  out  the  policy  reforms  and  implement  the  investment  projects \nthat  are  needed  to  achieve  the  targets  and  goals  of  SEDP 2006\u2013\n2010.  Furthermore,  the  policy  reforms  that  are  needed  for  the \nsuccessful  implementation  of  SEDP  2006\u20132010  are  now  or  will  be \nsupported by ADB through other policy-based loans to Viet Nam and \nby  other  development  agencies  both  within  and  outside \nthe \nframework of the PRSC process. \n \nThere is a risk that inflation, which accelerated markedly  in late 2007 \nand early 2008, will stay high long enough to preclude the successful \nthe \nimplementation  of  SEDP  2006\u20132010  and, \nachievement of its poverty reduction target. There is also a risk that \nthe ongoing global financial crisis and economic slowdown combined \n\nin  particular, \n\n\fv \n\nwith the macroeconomic stabilization measures taken recently by the \nGovernment  will  slacken  growth  in  Viet  Nam  to  a  degree  that  will \nrender  some  targets  and  goals  of  SEDP  2006\u20132010  (including  the \npoverty reduction target) impossible to attain. \n \nHowever,  the  macroeconomic  situation  in  Viet  Nam  has  started  to \nimprove.  Monthly \nin  June\u2013\nSeptember  2008,  and  there  was  deflation  in  October  2008.  As  a \nresult, year-on-year inflation fell in September\u2013October 2008. At the \nsame  time,  economic  growth  slowed  down  only  moderately  and \nstayed  quite  high  by  international  standards.  Moreover,  Viet  Nam\u2019s \neconomic prospects in the medium to long term remain good. Hence, \nthe risks that SEDP 2006\u20132010 will not be successfully implemented \nand  the  expected  outcome  of the  proposed  program  cluster  will  not \nbe attained are rather small. \n\ninflation  decelerated  significantly \n\n \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nprogram cluster to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Support for the Implementation of \nthe Poverty Reduction Program (SIPRP) V, comprising three subprograms, and (ii) a proposed \nloan for subprogram 1 of the SIPRP V. The design and monitoring framework for the proposed \nprogram cluster is in Appendix 1. \n\nII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n\nViet Nam\u2019s economy has been one of the fastest growing in Asia in the last two decades. \n2. \nGrowth was particularly strong in the last several years, with real gross domestic product (GDP) \nincreasing  by  8.1%  yearly  on  average  in  2003\u20132007.  In  2007,  real  GDP  grew  by  8.5%,  the \nhighest  rate  since  1996.  GDP  per  capita  at  current  prices  rose  from  $441  in  2002  to  $818  in \n2007, and GDP per capita in dollars at purchasing power parity (PPP) from $1,649 to $2,587. \n \n3. \nIn  recent  years,  however,  growth  of  aggregate  demand  has  outpaced  growth  of \naggregate  supply.  While  expansionary  monetary  and  fiscal  policies  and  extensive  borrowing \nand spending by state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have fueled the growth of aggregate demand, \nthe  growth  of  aggregate  supply  has  been  constrained  by  infrastructure  bottlenecks,  relatively \nlow efficiency of public investment, and increasingly acute shortages of skilled labor. As a result, \ninternal and external macroeconomic imbalances have emerged.  \n \n4. \nOn the domestic side, average annual inflation jumped from 1.8% in 1999\u20132003 to 7.9% \nin  2004\u20132007.  Inflation  was  quite  high  in  late  2007  and  the  first  half  of 2008,  with  food  prices \nrising  particularly  fast.  In  June  2008,  the  consumer  price  index  was  26.8%  higher  than  in \nJune 2007, and the index of food items (with a combined weight of almost 43% in the consumer \nprice index) was 45.6% higher. Period-average inflation reached 20.3% in January\u2013June 2008. \nThe  high  inflation  was  not  only  due  to  the  excessively  rapid  growth  in  aggregate  demand  in \n2007, but also due to increases in world commodity prices (especially energy and food prices) in \n2007 and the first half of 2008 and the supply-side shocks of late 2007 and early 2008 (including \nthe outbreak of pig and poultry epidemics, unusually harsh winter in the northern provinces, and \nfloods in the central provinces). \n \nIn the external sector, the current account balance turned from a surplus in 1999\u20132001 \n5. \nto  a  deficit  in  2002\u20132007  and  the  first  half  of  2008.  Moreover,  the  current  account  deficit \nwidened from 0.4% of GDP in 2006 to 9.6% of GDP in 2007 and about 23% of GDP in January\u2013\nJune 2008. Exports grew fast, but imports grew even faster, resulting in sharp increases in the \ntrade  deficit.  At  the  same  time,  inflows  of  foreign  capital,  especially  foreign  direct  investment, \nremained  strong.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  accession  to  the  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO)  in  early  2007 \nmade its policy framework more predictable and the country more attractive to foreign investors. \nNet  foreign  direct  investment  inflows,  which  ranged  between  $1.4 billion  and  $2.3  billion  in \n2003\u20132006,  surged  to  $6.6  billion  in  2007  and  $4.2 billion  in  the  first  6  months  of  2008. \nConsequently, the overall balance of payments recorded a surplus in both 2007 and the first half \nof  2008.  Gross  official  international  reserves  almost  doubled  from  $11.5  billion  at  the  end  of \n2006 to an estimated $21.4 billion at the end of June 2008.  \n \n6. \nIn  response  to  accelerating  inflation  and  the  ballooning  current  account  deficit,  in  April \n2008  the  Government  changed  its  top  policy  priority  from  maintaining  high  growth  rates  to \n\n \n\n\fcurbing  inflation  and  the  trade  deficit.  In  January\u2013June  2007,  it  took  a  range  of  measures  to \nachieve  these  objectives.  In  particular,  it  tightened  monetary  and  fiscal  policies  and  its  control \nover investments by SOEs. The State Bank of Viet Nam (SBV) raised the reserve requirements \nfor  banks  and  the  policy  interest  rates.  While  budgetary  expenditure  on  targeted  social \nassistance programs increased, administrative and capital expenditures were cut substantially. \nInvestments by SOEs (especially in noncore businesses) were curtailed.  \n \n7. \nThere  are  signs  that  these  measures  are  restraining  the  growth  of  aggregate  demand \nand  reducing  the  macroeconomic  imbalances.  Money  supply,  which  expanded  by  46.1%  in \n2007,  grew  at  an  annualized  rate  of  8.5%  in  the  first  half  of  2008.  The  balance  of  the \nconsolidated budget turned from a deficit of 5.5% of GDP in 2007 to a surplus of 0.3% of GDP \nin January\u2013September 2008. Year-on-year GDP growth moderated to 6.5% in the first 9 months \nof 2008. Monthly inflation fell from 3.9% in May 2008 to 0.2% in September 2008, and there was \n0.2% deflation in October 2008. Food prices stabilized by September 2008 and fell by 0.4% in \nOctober 2008. Year-on-year inflation dropped from 28.3% in August 2008 to 26.7% in October \n2008.  The  monthly  trade  deficit  narrowed  from  $3.2  billion  in  March  2008  to  less  than  $1.0 \nbillion  in  June\u2013October  2008.  In  a  sign  of  continued  optimism  among  foreign  investors  about \nViet  Nam\u2019s  medium-term  economic  prospects,  new  foreign  direct  investment  commitments \nsurged to $59.3 billion in January\u2013October 2008 from $21.3 billion in all of 2007. \n\nIII. \n\nTHE SECTOR \n\nA. \n\nSector Description and Performance  \n\n1. \n\nRecent Progress in Poverty Reduction \n\n8. \nViet  Nam  has  reduced  poverty  dramatically  over  the  last  15\u201320  years  (Appendix  2). \nAccording to the most recent  available  household  survey  data,  the  poverty  rate  (based  on  the \ncost of a consumption basket allowing for a daily intake of 2,100 calories per person and some \nnonfood expenditure) dropped from 58.1% in 1993 to 16.0% in 2006.1 The food poverty rate fell \nfrom  24.9%  to  6.7%  over  the  same  period,  while  the  poverty  gap  narrowed  from  18.5%  to \n3.8%.2  \n \n9. \nMeasures  of  poverty  not  based  on  household  survey  data  point  to  declines  of  similar \nmagnitudes  in  poverty,  even  though  they  give  different  levels  of  poverty.  In  particular,  the \nproportion of people living on less than $1.0 (at PPP) per day dropped from 50.8% of the total \npopulation in 1990 to 4.0% in 2007, and the proportion living on less than $2.0 (at PPP) per day \nfell from 87.0% to 32.9%.3 The poverty rate based on the methodology of the Ministry of Labor, \nInvalids and Social Affairs (MOLISA) fell from 22.0% in 2005 to an estimated 14.7% in 2007.4  \n \n\n                                                \n1  World  Bank.  2007.  Vietnam  Development  Report  2008:  Social  Protection.  Joint  donor  report  to  the  Vietnam \n\nConsultative Group Meeting, Hanoi, 6\u20137 December 2007. \n\n2   The food poverty rate is the proportion of people whose total expenditure would not be enough for a daily intake of \n2,100 calories even if it were entirely allocated to food. The poverty gap is the difference between the poverty line \nand the average expenditure of the poor expressed as a percentage of the former. \n\n3   World Bank. 2008. East Asia: Testing Times Ahead. Washington, DC. \n4  The  poverty  rate  based  on  the  methodology  of  the  Ministry  of  Labor,  Invalids  and  Social  Affairs  (MOLISA) \nmeasures  the  proportion  of  people  living  below  the  official  poverty  line,  which  is  D260,000  per  person  in  urban \nareas and D200,000 per person in rural areas. Households below the poverty line are identified by local officials of \nMOLISA through a combination of their personal knowledge, survey techniques, and village discussions.  \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nAccordingly,  Viet  Nam  has  made  good  progress  toward  the  Millennium  Development \n10. \nGoals  (MDGs).  It  has  already  achieved  four  MDG  targets  and  is  likely  to  attain  another  four \nahead  of  time.  Besides  the  targets  related  to  extreme  poverty  and  hunger,  Viet  Nam  has \nachieved  the  targets  concerning  the  gender  gap  in  primary  and  secondary  education  and  the \nincidence  of  malaria  and  other  diseases.  It  has  not  yet  attained  but  is  likely  to  achieve  the \ntargets  relating  to  the  completion  of  primary  schooling  by  boys  and  girls,  under-five  mortality, \nmaternal mortality, and the spread of HIV/AIDS.  \n \nA  combination  of  robust  economic  growth  and  more  efficient  social  protection  has \n11. \nenabled  Viet  Nam  to  make  such  great  strides  in  poverty  reduction.  Economic  growth  has \ncreated  new  jobs,  raised  incomes,  and  lifted  millions  of  people  out  of  poverty.  But  economic \ngrowth alone would not have enabled Viet Nam to reduce poverty as much as it has done. Many \nof those who have not benefited directly from economic growth (often for reasons beyond their \ncontrol)  have  been  lifted  out  of  poverty  or  prevented  from  falling  into  poverty  because  more \nresources  have  become  available  for  social  protection (thanks to  the robust  economic growth) \nand social protection has become significantly more efficient.  \n\n2. \n\nPoverty Reduction Support Credit Process \n\nThe main reason why Viet Nam has been able to sustain strong economic growth for a \n12. \nlong time and to improve the efficiency of social protection significantly is that, since launching \nthe  Doi  Moi  program  in  1986,  the  country  has  carried  out  a  broad  range  of  policy  reforms \nfostering  sustainable  and  inclusive  economic  growth  and  making  social  protection  more \ntargeted. In particular, Viet Nam has been undertaking gradual transition from a command to a \nmarket economy, and from a social protection system that relies heavily on price subsidies to a \nsystem  based  on  targeted  programs.  It  has  also  continuously  strengthened  natural  resource \nmanagement  and  improved  governance.  Since 2002,  more  and more multilateral  and  bilateral \ndevelopment  agencies  have  supported  these  reforms  through  the  World  Bank\u2013led  poverty \nreduction support credit (PRSC) process.  \n \n13. \nThe  PRSC  process  comprises  several  closely  related  activities  jointly  undertaken  each \nyear by participating development agencies to help the Government carry out the policy reforms \nneeded  for  the  successful  implementation  of  its  poverty  reduction  strategy.  The  process \ninvolves  the  preparation  of  Viet  Nam  development  reports  by  participating  agencies, \nconsultations on the policy matrices for the World Bank\u2019s PRSCs among participating agencies \nand between these agencies and the Government, and general budget support (in the form of \ngrants  and  concessional  loans)  to  Viet  Nam  by  participating  agencies  to  cover  some  of  the \nadjustment  costs  of  the  policy  reforms  to  the  budget.  The  World  Bank  coordinates  PRSC \nactivities for the participating development agencies. \n  \n14.  While the Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy largely determines its reform agenda, \nthe Viet Nam development reports translate this agenda into specific policy actions. Because a \nsustained  reduction  in  poverty  requires  continued  and  balanced  progress  in  a  wide  range  of \npolicy reforms, the Government has an extensive reform agenda and the Viet Nam development \nreports specify numerous policy actions in many different areas.  \n \n15. \nSome  of  these  actions  are  included  in  the  policy  matrices  for  PRSCs.  During  the  year \nbefore that of the expected approval of a particular PRSC by the World Bank, the participating \ndevelopment agencies agree among themselves and the Government on an initial list of actions \nto be included in the policy matrix for the PRSC. At the start of the year when the PRSC is to be \n\n \n\n \n\n\fapproved by the World Bank, the agencies hold joint consultations with the Government on the \nstatus of the policy actions on the initial list. When the World Bank undertakes the appraisal and \nthe  negotiations  for  the  PRSC  (usually  in  May  of  the  year  when  the  PRSC  is  expected  to  be \napproved),  the  agencies  and  the  Government  agree  on  the  final  list  of  policy  actions  for  that \nPRSC. Some actions that were included in the initial list are modified or dropped at this stage, in \nview of their status and likelihood of being completed before the World Bank\u2019s Executive Board \ndeliberates on the PRSC.  \n \nActions in all key reform areas are usually included in the policy matrices for PRSCs to \n16. \nhelp  the  Government make  balanced  progress  in  reforms  across  various  areas  and fully  carry \nout its reform agenda. Therefore, the policy matrices for PRSCs tend to be fairly broad in scope \nand  to  closely  match  the  Government\u2019s  reform  agenda.  This  makes  the  PRSC  process \nattractive  to  a  large  number  of  development  agencies  (focusing  on  different  areas  of  policy \nreforms)  and  contributes  to  the  strong  government  ownership  of  the  actions  included  in  the \npolicy matrices for PRSCs.  \n \nAt the same time, the good-practice principle of criticality in development policy lending \n17. \nby  the  World  Bank  guides  the  selection  of  policy  actions  within  a  particular  reform  area. \nAccording  to  this  principle,  only  those  actions  that  are  critical  to  the  achievement  of  results \nshould be made conditions for disbursement.5 Therefore, the policy matrices for PRSCs include \nonly those actions that the participating development agencies and the Government consider to \nbe  critical  steps  in  the  reform  process  in  the  area  concerned  and  for  which  the  Government \nneeds the combined support of many development agencies. The Government follows through \nwith  the  reform  process  on  its  own  or  with  the  support  of  development  agencies  under  other \nprojects.  This  approach  helps  keep  the  policy  matrices  for  PRSCs  manageable  despite  their \nbroad scope. But it also limits the continuity of actions included in the policy matrices for various \nPRSCs. \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  joined  the  PRSC  process  in  2003  and  has  taken \n18. \npart  in  all  PRSC  activities  since  then.  In  2004,  ADB  approved  SIPRP  I,  a  single-tranche \nstandard program loan of $6.4 million. SIPRP I provided parallel financing with the World Bank\u2019s \nPRSC  3  in  support  of  the  implementation  of  the  Government\u2019s  Comprehensive  Poverty \nReduction  and  Growth  Strategy  (CPRGS)  2002\u20132006.  SIPRP  II  and  SIPRP  III  ($15 million \neach) were approved in 2005 and 2006 and provided parallel financing with PRSC 4 and PRSC \n5,  respectively.  Like  SIPRP  I,  SIPRP  II  and  SIPRP  III  were  single-tranche  standard  program \nloans, which supported the implementation of CPRGS 2002\u20132006. With support from ADB, the \nWorld  Bank,  and  other  development  agencies  through  the  PRSC  process,  the  policy  reforms \nneeded for the successful implementation of CPRGS 2002\u20132006 were carried out and most of \nthe CPRGS goals were achieved.6 \n\n3. \n\nSocioeconomic Development Plan 2006\u20132010 \n\n19. \nSEDP 2006\u20132010 was adopted by the Government in 2006. Unlike previous SEDPs, it \nwas  prepared  in  an  open  and  participatory  manner  involving  extensive  consultations  with  civil \nsociety,  businesses,  and  development  agencies,  and  is  oriented  more  toward  attaining \n\n                                                \n5  World Bank. 2005.

Its  targets  include  a  reduction  in  the  poverty  rate  (based  on  MOLISA\u2019s  methodology) \nfrom  22%  in  2005  to  10%\u201311%  in  2010.  SEDP  2006\u20132010  also  aspires  to  strengthen  the \nfoundations  for  environmentally  sustainable  and  socially  inclusive  economic  growth  and  a \ncontinued reduction in poverty beyond 2010. It provides for a broad range of policy reforms and \na  large  number  of  investment  projects  aimed  at  achieving  its  targets  and  goals.  The  joint \nInternational Development Association (IDA)\u2013International Monetary Fund staff advisory note of \n5 December 2006  on  Viet  Nam\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy  concluded  that  SEDP  2006\u20132010 \nhas the key features of a poverty reduction strategy and is likely to lead to economic growth and \npoverty reduction.7 \n \n20. \nSince  late  2006,  the  PRSC  process  has  supported  the  policy  reforms  needed  for  the \nsuccessful  implementation  of  SEDP  2006\u20132010.  In  2007,  about  a  dozen  multilateral  and \nbilateral  development  agencies,  including  ADB,  provided  general  budget  support  to  Viet  Nam \nwithin the framework of the PRSC process to help the Government keep these reforms on track \nin 2007. In particular, the World Bank approved PRSC 6 amounting to $175 million from IDA in \nJune  2007,  and  ADB  approved  the  $15.0-million  SIPRP  IV  (another  single-tranche  standard \nprogram loan) for this purpose in October 2007.  \n \n21. \nSignificant progress was made in 2007 toward achieving the outcome of SIPRP IV and \nthe  targets  of  SEDP  2006\u20132010.  The  poverty  rate  based  on  the  MOLISA\u2019s  methodology  fell \nfrom 22.0% in 2005 to 14.7% in 2007. The ratio of merchandise exports to GDP increased from \n63%  in  2005  to  about  70%  in  2007,  exceeding  the  SIPRP  IV  outcome  performance  target  of \n65%  in  2010.  The  share  of  the  domestic  private  sector  in  total  investment  reached  41%,  well \nabove the 34% in 2006 and the SIPRP IV target of 35% in 2010. The proportion of underweight \nchildren  in  2007  was  estimated  at  22.3%,  compared  with  25.0%  in  2005  and  the  SIPRP  IV \ntarget of less than 22.0% in 2010. About 71% of the rural population had access to clean water \nin 2007, compared with 62% in 2005 and the SIPRP IV target of 75% in 2010.  \n\nB. \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nChallenges in Poverty Reduction \n\n22. \nDespite the tremendous strides Viet Nam has made in eradicating poverty over the last \n15 years, much remains to be done. First, the absolute number of poor people is still quite large, \nalthough  their  share  of  the  total  population  has  been  drastically  reduced.  In  2006,  5.7 million \npeople suffered from hunger. In 2007, 3.4 million people survived on less than $1.0 (at PPP) per \nday and 28.1 million people lived on less than $2.0 (at PPP) per day (footnote 3). \n \nSecond, the  incidence  of  poverty  is  still fairly  high  in  the  rural  areas  and among  ethnic \n23. \nminorities, even though it has been decreasing faster than in urban areas and among the ethnic \nmajority.  In  2006,  the  poverty  rate  was  20.4%  in  rural  areas  (compared  with  3.9%  in  urban \nareas) and 52.2% among ethnic minorities (compared with 10.2% among the Kinh and Chinese \nmajority) (footnote 1). The rural areas accounted for 73.3% of the total population but 93.6% of \nthe poor. Ethnic minorities made up only 13.5% of the total population but 44.4% of the poor.8 \n \n                                                \n7   IMF  and  IDA.  2006.  Vietnam:  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  Paper\u2500Annual  Progress  Report\u2500Joint  Staff  Advisory \n\nNote.

Paper prepared for the \n\nMid-Year Consultative Group Meeting for Vietnam, Sapa, 5\u20136 June 2008. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\nThird, the rural poor and poor ethnic minority people not only account for relatively large \n24. \nproportions  of  their  respective  population  groups,  but  also  have  significantly  lower  average \nincomes than the urban poor and poor ethnic majority people, respectively. In 2006, the poverty \ngap was 4.9% in the rural areas and 15.4% among ethnic minorities, compared with 3.2% in the \nurban areas and 2.0% among the Kinh and Chinese majority (footnote 1). \n \n25. \nFourth, the incidence of poverty varies significantly across regions. It is fairly low in the \nSoutheast,  Red  River  Delta,  Mekong  Delta,  and  South  Central  Coast,  but  quite  high  in  the \nNorthern  Mountains  (especially  the  Northwest  Mountains),  North  Central  Coast,  and  Central \nHighlands.  In  2006,  the  poverty  rate  was  30.2%  in  the  Northern  Mountains  (49.0%  in  the \nNorthwest Mountains), 29.1% in the North Central Coast, and 28.6% in the Central Highlands, \ncompared with 5.8% in the Southeast and 8.8% in the Red River Delta.  \n \n26. \nFifth, the vulnerability of the population to poverty is rather high, especially in the urban \nareas. The large difference between the proportion of the population living on less than $2.0 (at \nPPP) a day (32.9% in 2007) and the share of the population living on less than $1.0 (at PPP) a \nday  (4.0%  in  2007)  suggests  that  the  near-poor  account  for  a  substantial  proportion  of  the \npopulation.  A  relatively  small  external  or  internal  shock  and  a  moderate  deterioration  in  the \neconomic situation can push many of these people into poverty. \n \nFinally,  some  negative  trends  in  poverty  have  emerged  recently.  According  to  the \n27. \nhousehold  survey  data,  urban  poverty  increased  somewhat  between  2004  and  2006,  with  the \npoverty rate rising from 3.6% in 2004 to 3.9% in 2006 and the food poverty rate increasing from \n0.8% to 1.2%. Anecdotal evidence suggests that poverty increased further in the urban areas in \n2007 and the first half of 2008 because of high inflation and in particular soaring food prices.9 \n\n2. \n\nOpportunities Afforded by the Poverty Reduction Support Credit Process \n\n28. \nTo  meet  the  remaining  challenges  of  poverty  reduction,  Viet  Nam  needs,  among  other \nthings, to press ahead with the policy reforms that address the structural causes of high inflation \n(such  as  the  relatively  low  efficiency  of  public  investment  and  supply-side  rigidities),  further \nincrease the efficiency of social protection, and foster environmentally sustainable and socially \ninclusive  economic  growth  over  the  medium  term.  Some  of  these  reforms  are,  however,  quite \ncomplex. Besides, their costs to the economy as a whole and to the state budget in particular \nare  likely  to  exceed  their  benefits  in  the  short  term.  They  are  therefore  likely  to  put  a \nconsiderable burden on the state budget in the short term. Moreover, they are likely to result in \nnet  losses  to  some  economic  actors  even  over  the  long  term.  Consequently,  some  of  these \nreforms are likely to meet with resistance from potential losers.  \n \nStrong  support  from  development  partners,  through  the  PRSC  process,  can  help  the \n29. \nGovernment  carry  out  these  reforms.  In  2006,  under  the  auspices  of  the  Network  on \nDevelopment  Evaluation  of  the  Development  Assistance  Committee  of  the  Organization  for \nEconomic  Co-operation  and  Development,  several  development  agencies  and  governments \ncommissioned an evaluation study of partnership general budget support (PGBS) operations in \nseven developing countries, including Viet Nam. The study looked into the relevance, efficiency, \nand effectiveness of PGBS (involving several development agencies and the government), such \n\n                                                \n9  According to one estimate, a 10% rise in food prices in Viet Nam reduces the poverty rate in rural areas by 0.98 \npercentage  points,  but  increases  the  poverty  rate  in  urban  areas  by  0.53  percentage  points  (Vu,  Linh,  and  Paul \nGlewwe.  2008.  Impacts  of  Rising  Food  Prices  on  Poverty  and  Welfare  in  Vietnam.  Paper  commissioned  by  the \nWorld Bank). \n\n\f7 \n\ntransparent, \n\nas the PRSC process in Viet Nam, and found it to be an efficient, effective, and sustainable way \nof  supporting  national  poverty  reduction  strategies.  PGBS  can  significantly  affect  policies  and \npolicy  processes  through  financial  empowerment,  stronger  incentives  within  government,  and \nbetter coherence and coordination among international partners. In the countries covered by the \nstudy,  PGBS  has  reinforced  collaboration  between  governments  and  development  agencies \nand  improved  harmonization  of  official  development  assistance.  It  has  helped  make  public \nfinance  management  more  comprehensive  and \nincreased  pro-poor  public \nexpenditures, and resulted in large savings to the government in transaction costs. The PRSC \nprocess  in  Viet  Nam  has  had  a  strong  positive  impact  on  policy  reforms.  It  is  a  successful \nexample  of  government\u2013donor  collaboration,  of  learning  from  experience,  and  of  objectives \nmet.10  \n \nIndeed,  the  PRSC  process  has  been  a  driving  force  of  policy  reforms  in  Viet Nam  in \n30. \nrecent years. The Government has ably used the involvement of a large number of development \nagencies (including ADB) in the process to overcome domestic resistance to policy reforms. To \ndeal with such resistance, government agencies advocating certain reform measures have often \nproposed the inclusion of these measures in the policy matrices for the PRSCs.  \n \n31. \nAccording to the World Bank\u2019s report on the implementation and results of PRSCs 1\u20135, \nthe first phase of the PRSC process in Viet Nam (which involved PRSCs 1\u20135 and supported the \nimplementation  of CPRGS  2002\u20132006)  contributed  to the  significant  progress  achieved  by the \ncountry  in  transition  to  a  market  economy,  social  inclusion,  and  the  building  of  modern \ngovernance.  The  PRSC  process  had  a  direct  influence  on  the  adoption  of  policy  actions  that \nwere  conducive  to  higher  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction,  and  helped  spread  market \nmechanisms, create wage employment, and improve the delivery of public services. The annual \nPRSC cycle with tight deadlines increased incentives to complete key policy actions on time. In \naddition,  the  PRSC  process  helped  the  Government  strengthen  its  capacity  to  conduct  cross-\nsector  policy  dialogue  and  deliver  results  on  time.  Consultations  with  a  large  number  of \ndevelopment  agencies  within  the  framework  of  the  PRSC  process  demonstrated  the \nGovernment  the  benefits  of  an  open  dialogue  on  key  issues  and  made  it  more  receptive  to \nsharing  its  draft  documents  at  an  early  stage  and  eliciting  feedback  from  the  relevant \nstakeholders.11 \n \n32. \nAccording to stakeholder consultations that were held in 2006 as part of an independent \nevaluation of the first phase of the PRSC process, the process was beneficial to policy reforms \nin Viet Nam. The policy dialogue within the framework of the PRSC process was emphasized by \nboth  the  Government  and  the  participating  development  agencies  as  a  major  benefit  of  the \nprocess. The Government valued the ideas offered by the development agencies on the design \nand  implementation  of  policy  reforms,  while  the  development  agencies  gained  a  broader \nunderstanding  of  the  direction  of  the  reform  process  and  government  thinking.  Other  PRSC \nbenefits  stemmed  not  only  from  improving  the  quality  of  policies  but  also  from  locking  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s  commitment  to  specific  reforms  and  speeding  up  their  implementation.

Three  more  SIPRP  loans  are  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and \nprogram  2007\u20132010  and  country  operations  business  plan  2008\u20132010  for  Viet  Nam.13 All  of \nthem are envisaged as single-tranche standard program loans similar to SIPRPs I\u2013IV. SIPRP V \n(envisaged  as  a  single-tranche  standard  program  loan  and  included  in  the  2008  indicative \npipeline) is to provide parallel financing with PRSC 7; SIPRP VI (in the 2009 indicative pipeline), \nwith PRSC 8; and SIPRP VII (2010 indicative pipeline), with PRSC 9. \n \n34. \nCombining these three single-tranche operations into a program cluster entitled SIPRP V \nand  comprising  three  chronologically  ordered  subprograms  is  proposed  for  a  number  of \nreasons. First, SIPRPs V\u2013VII are to provide parallel financing with the World Bank\u2019s PRSCs in \nsupport  of  the  implementation  of  SEDP  2006\u20132010.  More  specifically,  they  are  to  help  the \nGovernment  carry  out  policy  reforms  that  are  needed  for  the  successful  implementation  of \nto  complete.  A  program  cluster  with \nSEDP  2006\u20132010  but  will \nchronologically ordered subprograms is more suited to such reforms than a series of standard \nprogram loans each supporting a 1-year program. At the same time, a program cluster permits \nmore flexibility  than a multitranche  standard  program  loan  in  adjusting the  policy framework,  if \nneeded, to ensure its full consistency with the policy matrices for future PRSCs. \n \n35. \nSecond,  combining  SIPRPs  V\u2013VI  into  one  program  cluster  will  reaffirm  ADB\u2019s \ncommitment  to  stay  involved  in  the  PRSC  process  through  2010  and  strengthen  ADB\u2019s \npartnership  with  the  Government  and  other  development  agencies  participating  in  the  PRSC \nprocess.  SIPRP  V  will  build  on  SIPRP  IV  and  help  the  Government  carry  out  policy  reforms \nneeded  for  the  successful  implementation  of  SEDP  2006\u20132010.  Subprogram  1  will  provide \nparallel financing with PRSC 7, subprogram 2 with PRSC 8, and subprogram 3 with PRSC 9.  \n \n36. \nThird, combining SIPRPs V\u2013VII into one program cluster will make more predictable the \namounts of general budget support to be provided by ADB to Viet Nam within the framework of \nthe PRSC process. Medium-term budget planning and external debt management will therefore \nbe easier for the Government.  \n \n37. \nFinally,  combining  SIPRPs  V\u2013VII  into  a  program  cluster  will  save  staff  resources  for \nADB. SIPRP V will require less staff time to process than three separate SIPRP loans, primarily \nbecause only one concept paper on the entire program cluster will need to be prepared instead \nof three. Similarly, only one program completion report (PCR) on the entire SIPRP V will need to \nbe prepared after the completion of subprogram 3. The Government\u2019s final report to the National \nAssembly on the implementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010 can be used in evaluating SIPRP V since \nthe performance targets and indicators of SIPRP V are aligned with those of SEDP 2006\u20132010, \nand  SEDP 2006\u20132010  will  have  been  implemented  by  the  time the  PCR  on  SIPRP  V  is  to  be \nprepared. \n\n                                                \n12  Bartholomew,  Ann,  and  Catherine  Dom.  2006.

Manila. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nHence,  combining  SIPRPs  V\u2013VII  into  a  program  cluster  is  consistent  with  the \n38. \nrecommendations of the PCR on SIPRP III and the aforementioned evaluation study on general \nbudget  support.  The  PCR  on  SIPRP  III,  noting  the  substantial  staff  time  required  to  process \nSIPRP loans, recommended the streamlining and simplification of the process.14 The evaluation \nstudy  on  general  budget  support  concluded  that  development  agencies  embarking  on  PGBS \nshould  be  prepared  for  a  lengthy  engagement.  It  recommended  development  agencies \nproviding  such  support  to  Viet  Nam  within  the  framework  of  the  PRSC  process  to  make  long-\nterm (3\u20135 years) funding commitments and provide schedules of disbursements.  \n \n39. \nUnlike SIPRPs I\u2013IV, whose policy matrices were identical to those of the corresponding \nPRSCs, the proposed program cluster will be centered on those actions in the policy matrices \nfor  PRSCs  7\u20139  that  complement  policy  actions  supported  by  ADB\u2019s  other  program  loans  to \nViet Nam  or  are  otherwise  important  to  ADB\u2019s  operations  in the  country.  SIPRP V  will  thus  be \nmore congruent with ADB\u2019s other operations in Viet Nam.  \n \n40.  With SIPRP V, ADB will stay involved in the PRSC process through 2010, that is, until \nSEDP  2006\u20132010  is  fully  implemented  (Figure  1).  ADB  can  therefore  promote,  with  relatively \nmodest  financing,  a  wide  range  of  policy  reforms  that  are  needed  for  the  successful \nimplementation  of  SEDP  2006\u20132010.15 Consequently,  the  proposed  program  cluster  will  help \nADB achieve the objective of its country strategy and program 2007\u20132010 for Viet Nam, which \nis to help the Government reduce the poverty rate to 10%\u201311% by 2010. \n \n41. \nFurthermore, continued participation in the PRCS process will provide ADB with another \nmeans  of  coordinating  its  activities  in  Viet  Nam  with  those  of  other  development  agencies. \nSIPRP  V  will  help  ADB  fulfill  its  obligations  under  the  Rome  Declaration  on  Harmonization \n(2003), the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness (2005), and the Hanoi Core Statement on Aid \nEffectiveness (2005). \n\n                                                \n14  ADB. 2007.

Its  expected  outcome  is  the  successful  implementation  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s  SEDP  2006\u20132010.  To  this  end,  the  proposed  program  cluster  will  help  the \nGovernment carry out the policy reforms that are needed for the successful implementation of \nSEDP  2006\u20132010  by  supporting  the  policy  actions  that  are  critical  steps  in  carrying  out  the \nreforms  and  are  particularly  relevant  to  ADB\u2019s  operations  in  Viet  Nam.  The  successful \nimplementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010 will not only reduce poverty during 2006\u20132010 but will also \nincrease Viet Nam\u2019s economic competitiveness and strengthen the foundations for sustainable \nand  inclusive  growth  and  a  continued  reduction  in  poverty  beyond  2010.  The  Government\u2019s \nDevelopment Policy Letter is in Appendix 3. \n\nB. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions \n\n43. \nThe  Vietnam  Development  Report  2007  provides  the  analytical  basis  for  the  second \nphase  of  the  PRSC  process  (which  involves  the  World  Bank\u2019s  PRSCs  6\u20139  and  supports  the \nimplementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010) and the proposed program cluster. The report was jointly \nprepared  by  16 development  agencies,  including  ADB,  in  2006.  It  analyzes  the  medium-term \ndevelopment  challenges  facing  Viet  Nam  and  reviews  the  Government\u2019s  strategy  for \novercoming  these  challenges,  as  set  out  in  SEDP  2006\u20132010.16 It  also  identifies  the  policy \nreforms that are needed for the successful implementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010 and proposes \nspecific policy actions to advance these reforms.  \n \n44. \nfollowing four broad reform areas: \n \n\nThe  policy  actions  proposed  by  the  Vietnam  Development  Report  2007  fall  into  the \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nBusiness  development.  Equitizing  or  restructuring  SOEs,  developing  the \nfinancial and private sectors, improving the quality of infrastructure services, and \ndeepening Viet Nam\u2019s integration into the global economy.  \nSocial inclusion. Improving the quality of health care and education and access \nto these services, strengthening social protection, and promoting gender equality.  \nNational  resource  management.  Strengthening  the  management  of  natural \nresources  (including  water,  land,  and  forests)  and  the  protection  of  the \nenvironment.  \nGovernance.  Improving  planning  processes,  strengthening  public  financial \nmanagement and pubic administration, reducing corruption, and improving legal \ntransparency and accessibility.  \n\n \n\n45. \nSome of the actions proposed in the Vietnam Development Report 2007 were included \nin  the  policy  matrices  for  PRSC  6  and  SIPRP  IV.  The  remaining  actions  served  as  a  starting \npoint in the selection of actions to be included in the policy matrix for PRSC 7.  \n \n\n                                                \n16 World Bank. 2006. Vietnam Development Report 2007: Aiming High. Joint donor report to the Vietnam Consultative \n\nGroup Meeting, Hanoi, 14\u201315 December 2006. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fThe initial list of policy actions for PRSC 7 was discussed and agreed on in 2007 by the \n46. \ndevelopment  agencies  participating  in  the  PRSC  process  and  the  Government.17 In  January\u2013\nMarch 2008, the development agencies held two rounds of consultations with the Government \non the status of that initial list. On the basis of those discussions, the list was slightly modified. \nWhen the World Bank conducted the appraisal and the negotiations for PRSC 7 in May 2008, \nthe  development  agencies  and  the  Government  agreed  on  the  final  list  of  38  policy  actions, \ndown from the original 61.18 ADB took part in all of these consultations and provided substantive \ninputs to the policy matrix for PRSC 7.  \n \n47. \nThe  actions  covered  by  subprogram  1  of  the  proposed  program  cluster  were  selected, \nthrough consultation among various units of ADB and with the Government, from the final list of \nactions included in the policy matrix for PRSC 7. The tentative policy actions for subprograms 2 \nand 3 were drawn from the tentative list of policy actions for PRSCs 8\u20139. Only those actions that \ncomplemented policy actions supported by ADB\u2019s other program loans to Viet Nam and did not \nduplicate  those  actions,  or  were  otherwise  important  to  ADB\u2019s  operations  in  Viet  Nam,  were \nselected. All actions selected for subprogram 1 were completed by October 2008. The following \nis  a  brief  description  of  these  actions  and  their  relationships  with  the  tentative  actions  under \nsubprograms 2 and 3 and ADB\u2019s other operations in Viet Nam.19  \n\n1. \n\nBusiness Development \n\n48. \nAction  1:  Assess  the  scope  and  nature  of lending  and  other transactions  among \naffiliated parties within economic groups and general corporations. There is concern that \nthe involvement of large SOEs in the financial sector, through their control of commercial banks \nand  other  financial  institutions,  could  undermine  the  efficient  allocation  of  capital  and  be  a \nsource of instability in the medium term. Investments by large SOEs in real estate and the stock \nmarket probably fueled the recent stock market and real estate bubbles. As a first step toward \nregulating  these  activities,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  has  assessed  the  scope  of  related \nlending  and  related  party  transactions  and  their  implications  for  economic  stability  and  overall \nefficiency.  MOF  reviewed  outside  investments  by  economic  groups  and  general  corporations, \nassessed  the  conditions  under  which  they  borrow  from  the  banks  they  have  invested  in,  and \nevaluated  the  extent  and  pricing  of  sales  among  affiliates.20 This  assessment  will  be  useful  in \ndesigning the SOE Reform and Corporate Governance Facility, a program loan in ADB\u2019s 2009 \nindicative  lending  pipeline  for  Viet  Nam  that  is  intended  to  facilitate  the  reform  of  SOEs  and \nimprove corporate governance at these enterprises. \n \n\n                                                \n17 The  experience  with  previous  PRSCs  showed  that  policy  reforms  tend  to  make  slower  progress  in  areas  where   \npolitical  will  is  limited,  institutional  responsibilities  overlap,  or  analysis  is  insufficient.  This  finding  was  taken  into \naccount  when  the  initial  list  of  policy  actions  for  PRSC  7  was  drawn  up.  An  action,  though  deemed  relatively \nambitious, was included in the list if the political will to carry it out was believed to be strong and the action was \nsupported by sound analysis and fell within the area of responsibility of a single government agency. If political will \nfor the action was deemed to be limited or the analytical basis was weak or the action was a responsibility held in \ncommon by several government agencies, a less ambitious alternative was chosen. \n\n18  The final list of actions included in the policy matrix for PRSC 7 is in Appendix 4.  \n19 The  policy  matrix  and  the  objective  tree  for  SIPRP  V,  which  are  given  in  Appendix  5,  show  graphically  how  the \npolicy  actions  covered  by  subprogram  1  and  the  tentative  policy  actions  under  subprograms  2  and  3  are \ninterrelated and how they will contribute to the outputs, outcome and impact of SIPRP V. The status of the actions \ncovered by subprogram 1 is described in Appendix 6.   \n\n20  World Bank. 2008. International Development Association Program Document for a Proposed Credit in the Amount \nof  SDR92.1  Million  (US$150.0  Million  Equivalent)  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Vietnam  for  a  Seventh  Poverty \nReduction Support Operation. Washington, DC (Report No. 42896-VN). \n\n12 \n\n \n\n\f13 \n\nThe  assessment  will  also  be  useful  in  carrying  out  action  1  (strengthen  the  financial \n49. \nmanagement  of  SOEs  and  their  investment  in  other  entities,  defining  the  level  of  such \ninvestments)  under  subprograms  2  and  3.  Action  1  under  subprogram  1  and  actions  1  and  2 \n(transfer state ownership rights in equitized SOEs to the State Capital Investment Corporation) \nunder  subprograms  2  and  3  will  help  equitize  or  restructure  SOEs,  thereby  contributing  to \nbusiness development and the successful implementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010.  \n \n50. \nAction  2:  Approve  equitization  plans,  allowing  the  participation  of  strategic \ninvestors, for two state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs) and complete the equitization \nof  one  of  them.  The equitization of SOCBs  is  an important part of market-oriented reforms in \nViet Nam. By Prime Minister\u2019s Decisions 1289/QD-TTg of 26 September 2007 and 313/QD-TTg \nof  24  March  2008,  the  Government  approved  the  equitization  plans  for  Vietcombank  and \nMekong Housing Bank, respectively. Both plans provide for an initial public offering and the first \ngeneral meeting of shareholders.  \n \n51. \nThe  equitization  of  Vietcombank  has  essentially  been  completed.  The  bank  held  an \ninitial  public  offering  in  December  2007  and  its  first  general  meeting  of  shareholders  in  April \n2008.  However,  the  sale  of  the  bank\u2019s  shares  to  strategic  investors  and  its  listing  on  a  stock \nexchange have been postponed in view of unfavorable market conditions. \n \n52. \nAction  3:  Issue  a  road  map  to  ehnace  bank  supervision,  including  off-site \nsupervision  and  risk  management  tools.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  banking  system  has  expanded  rapidly \nsince  the  1990s,  both  in  number  of  banks  and  in  size  of  credit  portfolio.  Numerous  joint-stock \nbanks  with  relatively  small  capital  have  been  established  and  have quickly  built  up  their  credit \nportfolios, often with inadequate regard for quality. SOCB lending to SOEs has been extensive \nbut not always commercially viable. Many banks have excessive exposure to the stock and real \nestate markets. Now that stock prices have fallen from their record highs in 2007, the real estate \nmarket  has  cooled,  interest  rates  have  risen,  and  economic  growth  is  slowing  down,  serious \nvulnerabilities  have  emerged  in  the  banking  system.  Although  reliable  data  on  nonperforming \nloans  are  not  available,  one  can  assume  with  a  reasonable  degreee  of  confidence  that  the \nshare  of  these  loans  in banks\u2019  portfolios  has  increased  significantly  in  the  last  several  months \nand is likely to increase further in the months ahead. It is therefore particularly encouraging that, \non  24  August  2007,  the  SBV  governor  issued  Decision  1976/QD-NHNN  approving  a  proposal \nfor  the  organizational  and  operational  reform  of  banking  supervision,  including  off-site \nsupervision and risk management tools. The proposal is in effect a road map for strengthening \nrisk management at commercial banks and their prudential supervision by SBV. On 31 January \n2008, SBV adopted Plan 1094/KH-NHNN implementing this proposal. \n \n53. \nAction  3  (complete  the  equitization  of  four  SOCBs,  with  the  participation  of  strategic \ninvestors)  under  subprograms  2  and  3  will  be  a  continuation  of  action  1  under  subprogram  1. \nThese two actions\u2014together with action 4 (certify the internal credit rating system of all banks \nand  approve  inspection  manuals)  and  action  5  (prepare  a  revised  law  on  the  central  bank \nfocusing its mandate on, and enhancing its autonomy in regard to, monetary policy and financial \nsector stability) under subprograms 2 and 3\u2014will complement policy actions and reforms under \nsubprogram 1 of the Third Financial Sector Program Loan (approved in November 2007)21 and \nthe technical assistance (TA) for Support for Developing Capital Markets and Building Capacity \n\n                                                \n21  ADB.  2008.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Program \nCluster and Loan to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Third Financial Sector Program Loan (Subprogram \n1). Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\nin  the  Financial  Sector  (approved  in  June  2008). 22  The  actions  will  contribute  to  business \ndevelopment  and  poverty  reduction  through  a  sound  banking  system  and  a  better-developed \nfinancial sector.  \n \n54. \nAction 4: Rationalize incentives related to the enterprise income tax and simplify \ntax  procedures for  household  businesses.  Household businesses in Viet Nam now pay the \ncorporate  income  tax  (CIT).  In  November  2007,  the  National  Assembly  passed  the  Law  on \nPersonal  Income  Tax,  under  which  income  from  household  businesses  can  be  declared  and \ntaxed as individual income. The law also unified the tax rates for Vietnamese and foreigners and \nreduced  the  maximum  rate  from  40%  to  35%.  As  regards  the  CIT,  in  November  2007,  MOF \nissued  Circular  134/2007/TT-BTC  with  a  positive  list  (deductible  items)  and  a  negative  list \n(nondeductible items). The revised Law on Corporate Income Tax, lowering the base rate of the \nCIT from 28% to 25% and imposing time restrictions on many exemptions and preferential rates, \nwas passed by the National Assembly in June 2008 and is to take effect on 1 January 2009. \n \n55. \nAction 5: Raise the cap on shareholdings by a single foreign investor in unlisted \ncompanies.  Restrictions  on foreign  ownership  of  local  companies  present  a  serious  barrier  to \ninflows of foreign direct and portfolio investment into Viet Nam. There is a 49% ceiling on foreign \nownership  of  listed  nonfinancial  companies. There  is  also  a  15%  cap  on the  share  of  a  single \nstrategic foreign investor in the capital of a local joint-stock bank; this cap can be raised to 20% \nby  Prime  Minister\u2019s  decision,  depending  on  the  case.  But  while  a  single  strategic  foreign \ninvestor may hold up to 20% of the shares of a local joint-stock bank, the combined share of all \nforeign investors cannot exceed 30%. Until recently, the share of foreign investors in the capital \nof many other types of companies, including equitized but still unlisted SOEs, could not exceed \n30%. The Government\u2019s Decree 139/2007/ND-CP of September 2007 on the implementation of \nthe  Enterprise  Law  effectively  abolished  the  30%  cap  on  foreign  ownership  of  unlisted \ncompanies (other than those that are subject to sector-specific restrictions on private or foreign \nownership). \n \n56. \nActions  4  and  5  under  subprogram  1\u2014together  with  action  6  (establish  a  national \nbusiness registry with a unique number for business, tax, statistics, and seal agencies), action 7 \n(adopt guidelines to govern the operations of the Viet Nam Competition Council), and action 8 \n(revise the legal framework for the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises and enable \nbetter  links  with  large-scale  industries)  under  subprograms  2  and  3\u2014will  complement  actions \nand  initiatives  supported  by  subprogram  2  of  the  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  (SME) \nDevelopment Program Loan (approved in December 2006)23 and phase 2 of the TA for Making \nMarkets Work Better for the Poor (approved in February 2008).24 The actions will contribute to \nbusiness  development  and  the  successful  implementation  of  SEDP  2006\u20132010  by  promoting \nprivate sector development.  \n \n57. \nAction  6:  Separate  power  transmission  and  generation  assets  and  regroup \ntransmission assets under a single National Power Transmission Corporation. The rapidly \ngrowing  demand  for  electricity  is  among  the  most  pressing  infrastructure  challenges  facing \nViet Nam.

In a crucial step toward \nthe  creation  of  such  a  market,  power  transmission  and  generation  assets  were  recently \nseparated  and \nthe  National  Power  Transmission \nCorporation,  which  started  operating  on  1  July  2008.  The  company  is  responsible  for  the \nconstruction, operation, and maintenance of Viet Nam\u2019s power transmission network comprising \n220 kilovolt  (kV)  and  500 kV  lines  and  substations. The  separation  of  power  transmission  and \ngeneration assets and the establishment of the National Power Transmission Corporation have \npaved the way for the consolidation and equitization of generation assets and the creation of a \nwholesale market for electricity. \n \n58. \nAction  6  under  subprogram  1\u2014together  with  action  9  (adopt  a  pricing  system  for \nelectricity from renewable energy and provide incentives for the procurement of energy-efficient \nequipment by the Government) and action 10 (adopt user charges designed to better manage \ndemand for infrastructure services) under subprograms 2 and 3\u2014will help improve the quality of \ninfrastructure  services.  The  actions  will  complement  ADB\u2019s  numerous  ongoing  and  planned \nenergy  and  other  infrastructure  projects  in  Viet  Nam  and  contribute  to  business  development, \neconomic growth, and poverty reduction.  \n \n59. \nAction  11  (complete  the  legal  framework  enabling  the  improved  provision  of  logistics \nservices, including multimodal transport) and action 12 (issue a time-bound action plan for the \nimplementation  of  commitments  to  the  WTO)  under  subprograms  2  and  3  will  help  Viet  Nam \nintegrate  itself more  deeply  with  the  global  economy,  expand  trade,  reap  the  benefits  of WTO \nmembership,  and  mitigate  its  adverse  effects.  The  actions  will  thereby  contribute  to  business \ndevelopment and the successful implementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010. \n\n2. \n\nSocial Inclusion \n\nthe  near-poor. \n\n60. \nAction  7:  Increase  the  health  insurance  premium  paid  on  behalf  of  the  poor  and \nIn  October  2002,  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Decision \npartially  subsidize \n139/2002/QD-TTg introduced a government contribution of D50,000 per person per year toward \nhealth  insurance  of  the  poor.  The  amount  of  the  contribution  was  raised  to  D60,000  in  2006, \nD80,000  in  2007,  and  D130,000  in  2008.  The  Government  is  now  considering  setting  its \ncontribution  at  3.0%  of  the  minimum  wage;  this  will  increase  the  amount  of  the  contribution \nfurther  (given  the  current  minimum  wage  of  D540,000  per  month).  Prime  Minister\u2019s \nDecision 289/2008/QD-TTg  of  March  2008  allowed  the  near-poor  to  join  the  voluntary  health \ninsurance  program,  with  the  Government  contributing  50%  of  their  insurance  premium.  In \nSeptember 2008, the Ministry of Health and MOF issued interministerial circular 10/2008/TTLT-\nBYT-BTC,  which  specified  the  mechanism  for  the  Government\u2019s  50%  contribution  towards \nhealth insurance of the near-poor. \n \nAction  7  under  subprogram  1\u2014together  with  action  13  (adopt  standards  for  the \n61. \ncertification  of  health  care  practitioners  and  the  classification  of  private  health  facilities)  and \naction  14  (establish  regulatory  and  institutional  frameworks  for  the  monitoring  of  the \nperformance of health care providers) under subprograms 2 and 3\u2014will improve the quality of \nhealth  care  services  and  access  to  such  services.  The  actions  will  complement  the  ADB \nprojects  Health  Care  in  the  Central  Highlands  (approved  in  January  2004  and  intended  to \nimprove  the  availability  of  good-quality  health  care  services  in  five  provinces  in  the  Central \nHighlands)25 and  Health  Care  in  the  South  Central  Coast  Region  (approved  on  7  November \n\n                                                \n25  ADB.  2004.

The actions will \nalso  improve  starting  conditions  for  the  Secondary  Education  Sector  Development  Program \n(which  is  in  the  indicative  pipeline  for  2009  and  is  intended  to  improve  secondary  education \nlearning  outcomes).  Action  7  under  subprogram  1  as  well  as  actions  13\u201316  under \nsubprograms 2  and  3  will  contribute  to  the  successful  implementation  of  SEDP  2006\u20132010  by \nmaking economic growth more socially inclusive.  \n\n3. \n\nNatural Resource Management \n\nthe \n\nfunctions.  On \n\nAction  8:  Allocate \n\ninstitutional  responsibilities  for \n\n63. \nintegrated  river  basin \nmanagement.  Until  recently,  river  basin  management  was  carried  out  by  both  the  Ministry  of \nNatural  Resources  and  Environment  (MONRE)  and  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Rural \nDevelopment  (MARD).  This  arrangement  significantly  complicated  integrated  river  basin \nmanagement  and  compromised  its  efficiency  and  effectiveness.  In  January  2008,  the \nGovernment  issued  Decree  01/2008/ND-CP  spelling  out  the  functions  and  tasks  of  MARD. \nRiver  basin  management  was  not  among \nthe  other  hand, \nDecree 25/2008/ND-CP, issued by the Government in March 2008, listed integrated river basin \nmanagement  among  the  key  functions  of  MONRE  and  authorized  the  latter  to  represent \nViet Nam in the Mekong River Council. \n \n64. \nAction 8 implemented a key recommendation of the draft final report of the Water Sector \nReview  Project,27 an  ongoing  TA  project.  By  doing  so,  it  settled  a  policy  issue  that  adversely \naffected many water management projects of ADB, including Central Region Water Resources \n(approved  in  December  2005  and  aimed  at  strengthening  irrigation  management  in  six \nprovinces  in  the  central  region  of  Viet  Nam)28 and  Central  Region  Small  and  Medium  Town \nDevelopment  (approved  in  November  2006  and  intended  to  improve  water  supply  services  in \neight small and medium-sized towns in the central region).29  \n \n65. \nirrigation \nmanagement  companies  to  improve  their  service  orientation  and  financial  viability)  and \naction 18 (develop a unified national sanitation strategy and encourage greater participation by \ncommunes  and  the  private  sector  in  sanitation)  under  subprograms  2  and  3\u2014will  improve  the \nmanagement of water resources. Action 19 (approve a national target program for adapting to \nthe  climate  change  and  allocate  institutional  responsibilities  for  its  implementation)  and \naction 20 (establish national and regional pollution monitoring systems to enable results-based \nenvironmental planning) will enhance environmental protection. All these actions will contribute \nto the successful implementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010 by strengthening management of natural \nresources.  \n\nAction  8  under  subprogram  1\u2014together  with  action  17  (restructure \n\n                                                \n26 ADB.  2008.

As part of the modernization of planning processes in \nViet  Nam,  further  progress  has  recently  been  made  in  developing  a  monitoring  framework  for \nSEDPs.  In  May  2007,  the  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investment  approved,  through  Decision \n555/2007/QD-BKH, a results-based monitoring and evaluation framework for SEDP 2006\u20132010. \nThe framework specifies the monitoring indicators and the agencies responsible for reporting on \nindividual  indicators.  ADB  assisted  the  ministry  in  developing  the  framework  through  the  TA \nproject Results-Based Monitoring of Poverty Reduction and Growth (approved in July 2005).30 \n \n \n67. \nAction  9  under  subprogram  1\u2014together  with  action  21  (establish  a  legal framework for \nstrengthening  urban  planning  and  urban  infrastructure  management)  and  action  22  (integrate \nsector policies and national target programs at the commune level, emphasizing participation at \nall stages) under subprograms 2 and 3\u2014will help improve planning processes. The actions will \ncontribute to the successful implementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010 by improving governance.  \n \n68. \nAction  10:  Issue  regulations  on  the  contents  and  timing  of  disclosure  of  State \nAudit  of  Viet  Nam  (SAV)  reports,  including  reports  on  audits  of  individual  entities. SAV \nwas established in 2004 as an independent institution reporting to the National Assembly, which \nwas  empowered  to  appoint  and  dismiss  the  Auditor  General.  In  July  2007,  SAV  issued \nDecision 03/2007/QD-KTNN  mandating \nfindings  and \nrecommendations. Three types of SAV documents must be disclosed: (i) annual audit reports, \n(ii) reports on the implementation of audit conclusions and recommendations, (iii) and the audit \nreports  and  the  audit  minutes  pertaining  to  audits  of  individual  entities.  This  regulation \nadequately defines the responsibilities for disclosure, the reports to be disclosed, and the timing \nand  means  of  disclosure.  Since  the  issuance  of  the  decision,  SAV\u2019s  audit  reports  have  been \ndistributed  to  members  of  the  National  Assembly,  press  conferences  have  been  held  on  the \nconclusions and recommendations of several of the reports, and various individual audits have \nbeen posted on SAV\u2019s website. \n \n69. \nAction  10  under  subprogram  10\u2014together  with  action  23  (formulate  a  public  debt \nmanagement law consolidating the management of domestic and external debt) and action 24 \n(adopt  public  sector  financial  reporting  standards  in  line  with  international  standards)  under \nsubprograms  2  and  3\u2014will  help  improve  governance  and  contribute  to  the  successful \nimplementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010 by strengthening public financial management. The actions \nwill  complement  the  activities  under  the  aforementioned  TA  projects  Support  for  Developing \nCapital Markets and Building Capacity in the Financial Sector (footnote 22) and Results-Based \nMonitoring of Poverty Reduction and Growth (footnote 30), as well as the TA project Supporting \nFinancial Management Decentralization (approved in December 2007).31  \n \n70. \nAction  11:  Extend  the  \u201cone-stop  shop\u201d  (OSS)  mechanism  to  all  ministries  and \nagencies and introduce an interlinked OSS mechanism to further simplify administrative \nprocedures.  As  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  simplify  administrative  procedures  and \nimprove  the  business  environment,  the  Prime  Minister  in  June  2007  issued  Decision \n93/2007/QD-TTg requiring all local public service agencies to introduce an OSS mechanism or \nan  interagency  OSS  mechanism.  Several  provinces  and  cities  have  already  done  so.  The \n                                                \n30 ADB.  2008.

Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fMinistry of Home Affairs has issued a document with guidelines for allowances for civil servants \nworking  at  the  OSS  offices,  to  encourage  them  to  fulfill  their  tasks.  Moreover,  Resolution \n53/2007/NQ-CP of November 2007 called for the pilot-testing of the OSS mechanism in seven \nnational ministries. \n \n71. \nAction 11 under subprogram 1\u2014together with action 25 (conduct user-feedback surveys \nto  assess  the  quality  of  public  services)  and  action  26  (develop  a  road  map  for  improving  the \nquality of public services, taking into account the findings of the surveys) under subprograms 2 \nand 3\u2014will help improve governance by strengthening public administration. These actions will \ncomplement  the  activities  under  the  TA  project  Supporting  Civil  Service  Reform  (approved  in \nAugust  2008  and  expected  to  develop  an  integrated  civil  service  reform  policy  framework).32 \nAction  11  under  subprogram  11  will  also  help  improve  the  business  environment  in  Viet  Nam \nand  thus  complement  policy  actions  and  initiatives  supported  by  subprogram  2  of  the  SME \nDevelopment  Program  Loan  (footnote  23)  and  phase  2  of  the  TA  for  Making  Markets  Work \nBetter for the Poor (footnote 24). \n \n72. \nAction  12:  Implement  the  asset  declaration  requirement  in  regard  to  senior \nofficials  and  their  immediate  families,  with  penalties  for  noncompliance.  The  asset \ndeclaration  requirement  was  introduced  by  the  Anti-Corruption  Law  of  2006  and  regulated \nthrough  Decree  37/2007/ND-CP  of  9  March  2007,  which  laid  down  disciplinary  measures  for \nnoncompliance.  To  implement  the  law  and  the  decree,  the  Government  Inspectorate  issued \nCircular  2442/TT-TTCP  of  13 November  2007  providing  detailed  practical  guidelines  for  the \ndeclaration process, and Official Letter 533/CCTN-TTCP of 2 April 2008 setting out a standard \ntemplate for reporting by ministries, agencies, and provinces. Extensive training was conducted \nat the end of 2007 and government employees were asked to submit their asset declarations by \nFebruary  2008.  Compliance  has  been  high.  Verification  is  based  on  denunciations.  Action 12 \nunder  subprogram  1\u2014together  with  action  27  (prepare  a  revised  press  law  to  encourage \naccurate,  objective,  and  responsible  reporting  on  corruption)  and  action  28  (adopt  a \ncomprehensive anticorruption strategy) under subprograms 2 and 3\u2014will help reduce corruption \nand improve governance. \n\nC. \n\nImportant Features \n\n73. \nAs  indicated  above,  the  proposed  program  cluster  will,  in  some  respects,  be  a \ncontinuation  of  SIPRPs  I\u2013IV.  Like  the  latter,  it  will  support  the  implementation  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s  poverty  reduction  program  by  providing  parallel financing with  the World  Bank\u2019s \nPRSCs. It will build on SIPRP IV to help the Government carry out policy reforms needed for the \nsuccessful implementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010.  \n \n74. \nUnlike  SIPRPs  I\u2013IV,  however,  SIPRP  V  will  take  the  program  cluster  approach.  Its \nimplementation period (3 years) will be shorter than the usual implementation period of program \nclusters (4\u20137 years). The program cluster approach is nonetheless warranted because all three \nsubprograms  of  SIPRP  V  will  support\u2014within  the  framework  of  the  PRSC  process\u2014the \nimplementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010.  \n \n75. \nSubprogram  1  will  provide  parallel  financing  with  PRSC  7,  which  was  approved  by  the \nWorld Bank on 25 June 2008. The Government, the World Bank, ADB, and other development \nagencies participating in the PRSC process agreed on the policy matrix for PRSC 7 through a \nseries of consultations held in 2007 and the first half of 2008. The matrix encompasses a wide \n\n                                                \n32 ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Supporting Civil Service Reform.

These  actions  were  chosen  through \nconsultations  among  various  units  of  ADB  and  with  the  Government.  All  of  them  were \ncompleted  by  October  2008.  Therefore,  loan  effectiveness  will  be  the  only  condition  for  the \nrelease of the loan tranche for subprogram 1. \n \n77. \nLikewise,  loans for  subprograms  2  and  3  will  be  proposed  to  ADB\u2019s  Board  of Directors \nafter  the  actions  included  in  the  policy  matrices  for  PRSCs  8  and  9  and  covered  by \nsubprograms 2 and 3, respectively, of SIPRP V are completed. This means that when the Board \nof  Directors  deliberates  on  subprograms  2  and  3  of  SIPRP  V,  there  will  be  no  pending  policy \nactions under the subprogram concerned. Loan effectiveness will be the only condition for the \ntranche release. \n \nThe design of the proposed program cluster takes into account the findings of the 2001 \n78. \nand 2007 studies on program lending of the Operations Evaluation Department. The 2001 study \nexpressed concerns about the complicated policy matrices and the excessive use of conditions \nthat  adversely  affect  program  performance.33 The  2007  study  identified  factors  affecting  the \nrelevance, effectiveness, and efficiency of the impact, outcomes, and outputs of program loans. \nThe  factors  that  promote  the  achievement  of  the  desired  results  and  are  within  ADB\u2019s  control \nare  (i)  consistency  of  reform  outcomes  with  the  government  reform  agenda  and  priorities, \n(ii) sufficient analysis and dialogue, and (iii) focused and manageable conditions that were acted \nupon  before  program  start-up. The factors that  impede the  achievement  of the  desired  results \nbut  are  within  ADB\u2019s  control  are  (i)  overly  complex  designs  with  too  many  tranche  release \nconditions  specified  in  the  policy  matrix,  and  (ii)  deferment  of  conditions  to  later  tranches \n(footnote 15). \n \n79. \nAlthough  SIPRP  V  will  cover  only  those  actions  in  the  policy  matrices  for  PRSCs 7\u20139 \nthat  are  particularly  relevant  to  ADB\u2019s  operations  in  Viet  Nam,  it  will  still  have  a  fairly  broad \nscope.  The  reason  is  that,  as  mentioned  above,  a  sustained  reduction  in  poverty  requires \ncontinued  and  balanced  progress  in  policy  reforms  in  many  areas.  Consequently,  the  policy \nmatrix  for  PRSC  7  includes,  and  the  policy  matrices  for  PRSCs  8  and  9  are  likely  to  include, \nactions in many different areas. Besides, ADB is active in many sectors in Viet Nam, and policy \nreforms in these sectors are of particular relevance to its operations. \n \n80. \nAt the same time, there will be only limited continuity in the policy actions supported by \nthe  various  subprograms  of  SIPRP  V.  This  is  because  the  policy  matrix  for  PRSC  7  includes \nonly  those  actions  that  development  agencies  participating  in  the  PRSC  process  and  the \nGovernment considered to be critical steps in the reform process in particular areas in 2007 and \nthe  first  half  of  2008  and  for  which  the  Government  needed  the  combined  support  of  many \ndevelopment  agencies.  Actions  for  PRSCs  8  and  9  will  be  selected  on  the  basis  of  the  same \ncriteria  and  will  not  necessarily  continue  actions  included  in  the  policy  matrix  for  the  previous \nPRSC.  \n\n                                                \n33  ADB.  2001.

So do some of the actions that are part of the policy matrix for PRSC 7 \nbut  are  not  covered  by  subprogram  1  of  the  proposed  program  cluster.  For  example,  the \nincrease in the health insurance premium paid on behalf of  the poor and the partial subsidies to \nthe  near-poor  will  cost  the  budget  an  estimated  $47  million  in  2008  and  about  $130  million  in \n2009. The total cost to the state budget in 2008 and 2009 of the actions included in the policy \nmatrix for PRSC 7 is estimated at $450 million.  \n \n82. \nIt  is  proposed  that  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights \n16,439,000  be  provided  for  subprogram  1  of  SIPRP  V  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources. \nThe  loan  will  have  a  term  of  24  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  an  interest  rate  of \n1.0%  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  during  the  amortization  period;  and  other  terms  and \nconditions set forth in the Loan Agreement. The World Bank has already approved PRSC 7 in \nthe  amount  of  $150  million  from  IDA  and  more  than  10  other  development  agencies  are \nexpected  to  provide  grants  or  concessional  loans totaling  about  $175 million  as  cofinancing  or \nparallel  financing  with  PRSC  7  (Appendix  7).  The  remaining  cost  to  the  budget  of  the  actions \nincluded in the policy matrix for PRSC 7 will be covered by the Government of Viet Nam. \n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nExecuting Agency \n\nSBV will be the Executing Agency for the proposed program cluster and have the overall \n83. \nresponsibility  for  the  implementation  of  all  its  subprograms.  SBV  hosts the  PRSC  coordination \nunit,  which  facilitates  interactions  between  the  Government  and  development  agencies  within \nthe framework of the PRSC process. SBV was also the Executing Agency for SIPRPs I\u2013IV.  \n \n84. \nThe government agencies represented at the National Steering Committee on the PRSC \nprocess  will  be  implementing  agencies  for  the  proposed  program  cluster. 34  They  will  be \nresponsible for carrying out the actions included in the policy matrix of the program cluster and \nwill provide updates on the status of these actions to the PRSC coordination unit of SBV. \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe  proposed  program  cluster  will  be \n\nto \n85. \n31 December 2011. Subprogram 1 will be implemented from 1 January to 31 December 2009, \nsubprogram  2  from  1  January  to  31  December  2010,  and  subprogram  3  from  1  January  to \n31 December 2011.  \n\nfrom  1  January  2009 \n\nimplemented \n\n3. \n\nDisbursement and Procurement \n\n86. \nSince all actions included in subprogram 1 have been completed the proposed loan will \nbe disbursed in a single tranche when the loan is declared effective.

It consists of representative of \ngovernment  agencies  responsible  for  policies  and  sectors  covered  by  the  PRSC  process.

No  supporting  import  documentation  will  be  required,  provided  that  the  value  of \nViet Nam\u2019s  total  imports  minus  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and \nimports financed under other official development assistance is at least equal to the amount of \nthe  loan  to  be  disbursed.  The  Government  will  certify  its  compliance  with  this  formula  with  its \nwithdrawal  request.  Otherwise,  import  documentation  under  existing  procedures  will  be \nrequired. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy \nof  the  Borrower\u2019s  certification.  As  such,  the  procedures  for  procurement  and  disbursement  of \nfunds, and the use of counterpart funds, are felt to be satisfactory. \n\n4. \n\nAnticorruption \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n88. \nwith  the  Government.  Consistent  with  its commitment to good governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to SIPRP V. To support these efforts, \nrelevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the relevant loan regulations.  \n \n89. \nThe  Government  has  taken  an  active  approach  to  fighting  corruption,  and  recently \nadopted  several  legal  documents  against  corruption,  including  the  Anti-Corruption  Law.  A \nnational steering committee against corruption, headed by the Prime Minister, has been set up. \nThe  committee,  which  has  the  power to  suspend  officials  suspected  of wrongdoing,  is  already \nengaged  in  several  high-profile  investigations.  Substantial funds  have  been  allocated from the \nstate budget to anticorruption activities, and results of investigations into corruption overseen by \nthe Government Inspectorate have been disclosed. \n\n5. \n\nLoans for Subprograms 2 and 3 \n\nAfter the development agencies participating in the PRSC process and the Government \n90. \nagree on the final list of policy actions for PRSC 8, the actions to be covered by subprogram 2 \nof  SIPRP  V  will  be  separated  from  those  to  be  covered  by  subprogram  3.  If  necessary,  the \nactions under subprogram 2 will be adjusted and made fully consistent with the policy matrix for \nPRSC 8. A loan for subprogram 2 will be proposed to ADB\u2019s Board of Directors in 2009 after the \npolicy actions to be covered by this subprogram are completed. After the development agencies \nparticipating in the PRSC process and the Government agree on the final list of policy actions \nfor PRSC 9, the policy actions under subprogram 3 will be adjusted, if needed, to ensure their \nfull consistency with the policy matrix for PRSC 9. A loan for subprogram 3 will be proposed to \nthe  Board  of  Directors  in  2010  after  the  policy  actions  to  be  covered  by  this  subprogram  are \ncompleted.  \n \nThe tentative amounts and terms of the loans for subprograms 2 and 3 will be the same \n91. \nas  those  of  the  loan  for  subprogram  1.  Hence,  the  tentative  total  amount  of  the  proposed \nprogram  cluster  will  be  $75.0  million.  The  loans  for  subprograms  2  and  3  (including  their \namounts and terms) are, however, subject to separate approval by the Board of Directors. \n\n                                                \n35  ADB. 1998.

Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n6. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n92. \nProgress  in  the  implementation  of  SIPRP  V  will  be  assessed  in  2009  and  2010  in \nconjunction  with  the  processing  of  loans  for  its  subprograms  2  and  3,  respectively.  The \nassessments  will  be  included  in  the  loan  documents  for  subprograms  2  and  3.  A  PCR  for  the \nentire program cluster will be prepared after the completion of subprogram 3.  \n \n93. \nData needed for the monitoring and evaluation of SIPRP V will be obtained from (i) the \nGovernment\u2019s annual reports to the National Assembly on the implementation of SEDP 2006\u2013\n2010,  (ii)  electronic  and  paper  publications  of  the  relevant  government  agencies,  (iii) the \nrelevant  government  agencies  through  the  PRSC  coordination  unit  of  SBV,  and  (iv)  other \nsources indicated in the design and monitoring framework.  \n\nV. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACT, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial Benefits \n\n94. \nThe policy reforms that the proposed program cluster will support will yield considerable \neconomic  benefits to  Viet  Nam  and  substantial financial  benefits to the Government. They  will \nraise  the  living  standards  of  the  Vietnamese  people  by  fostering  environmentally  sustainable \nand  socially  inclusive  economic  growth.  The  reforms  will  also  increase  budget  revenue  by \nexpanding  the  tax  base,  and  reduce  budget  expenditure  by  improving  public  financial \nmanagement. Over the medium term, the financial benefits of these reforms to the Government \nare  likely  to  exceed  their  costs  (including  interest  to  be  paid  on  loans  received  from  various \ndevelopment agencies within the framework of the PRSC process). \n\nB. \n\nSocial Impact \n\n \n\nA detailed poverty and social impact assessment of subprogram 1 of SIPRP V has been \n95. \nprepared in accordance with (i) ADB\u2019s Operations Manual section on the incorporation of social \ndimensions into ADB operations,36 and (ii) the handbook on social analysis issued in November \n2007  by  ADB\u2019s  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development  Department  and  Strategy  and  Policy \nDepartment.  In  particular,  the  social  implications  of  the  actions  covered  by  the  subprogram \n(including their indigenous people, involuntary resettlement, and gender implications) have been \nreviewed. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is given in Appendix 9. \n\nThe  conclusion  is  that  the  policy  actions  included  in  the  policy  framework  for \n96. \nsubprogram 1 of SIPRP V will have significant social effects. In particular, they will help reduce \npoverty  in  Viet  Nam  not  only  by  fostering  environmentally  sustainable  and  socially  inclusive \neconomic growth,  but  also  by  increasing social assistance  to  the  poor  and  the  near-poor. The \npoor will directly benefit from the increases in the health insurance premium paid on their behalf \nby  the  Government.  The  near-poor  will  directly  benefit  from  government  subsidies  for  their \nhealth insurance premiums. Ethnic minorities will benefit more than the ethnic majority from the \nactions  included  in  the  policy  framework  of  subprogram  1  because  poverty  incidence  is \nsignificantly  higher  among  ethnic  minorities  than  among  the  ethnic  majority.  Yet,  none  of  the \nactions included in the policy framework of subprogram 1 is centered on ethnic minorities or has \nan  adverse  impact  on  ethnic  minorities.  The  subprogram  has  therefore  been  assigned  to \nindigenous people category C.  \n\n                                                \n36  ADB.  2007.  Operations  Manual.  Section  C3:  Incorporation  of  Social  Dimensions  into  ADB  Operations.  Manila \n\n(25 April). \n\n \n\n\f23 \n\n \n97. \nThe  proposed  program  cluster  will  not  have  an  investment  component  and  the  actions \nincluded in the policy framework of its subprogram 1 will not cause any involuntary resettlement. \nTherefore, the subprogram has been assigned to involuntary resettlement category C. It has no \nsignificant gender implication.  \n\nC. \n\nEnvironmental Impact \n\nthe  policy  actions  concerning \n\nSubprogram  1  of  SIPRP  V  has  been  assigned  to  environmental  category  C.  Its \n98. \nenvironmental implications have been reviewed and a matrix of potential environmental impact \nhas been prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s environmental policy. The matrix is in Appendix 9. \n \nThe review of the environmental implications of subprogram 1 concluded that several of \n99. \nthe actions included in the policy framework for this subprogram are likely to have at least minor \npositive  environmental  impact.  The  policy  action  related  to  the  clarification  of  institutional \nresponsibilities for integrated river basin management, for one, is likely to have a major positive \ntransmission \nimpact,  while \ninfrastructure  and  the  improvement  of  SEDP  monitoring  systems  are  likely  to  have  minor \npositive  impact.  Enhancement  measures  have  been  developed  to  optimize  the  expected \npositive impact. No action has been identified as likely to have a negative environmental impact. \nAccordingly,  no  further  environmental  assessment  of  subprogram  1  is  warranted  and  no \nenvironmental impact assessment is required. \n \n100.  A  preliminary  analysis  of  the  potential  cumulative  environmental  impact  of  the  policy \nactions  to  be  supported  by  subprogram  1  and  the  tentative  policy  actions  to  be  supported  by \nsubprograms  2  and  3  concluded  that  the  impact  is  likely  to  be  positive.  The  environmental \nimplications of subprograms 2 and 3 will be assessed in detail in 2009 and 2010, respectively, \nafter the policy matrices for PRSC 8 and 9 are finalized and the policy actions to be supported \nby subprograms 2 and 3 of SIPRP V are confirmed.  \n\nthe  management  of  power \n\nD. \n\nAssumptions and Risks \n\n101.  The proposed program cluster will support policy actions that constitute critical steps in \nthe  policy  reforms  needed  for  the  successful  implementation  of  SEDP  2006\u20132010  and  are \nparticularly  relevant  to  ADB\u2019s  operations  in  Viet  Nam.  The  reforms,  however,  need  to  be  fully \ncarried out if SEDP 2006\u20132010 is to be successfully implemented. Therefore, it is assumed that, \nafter  completing  the  policy  actions  covered  by  SIPRP  V  and  the  other  actions  included  in  the \npolicy  matrices  for  the  World  Bank\u2019s  PRSCs  7\u20139,  the  Government  will  follow  through  with  the \npolicy reforms needed for the successful implementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010 on its own or with \nthe  support  of  development  agencies  under  other  projects.  It  is  further  assumed  that  the \ninvestment projects that are included in SEDP 2006\u20132010 and necessary for attaining its targets \nand goals will be implemented on schedule.  \n \n102.  These assumptions are based on the Government\u2019s commitment to carry out the policy \nreforms and implement the investment projects that are needed to achieve the targets and goals \nof  SEDP  2006\u20132010.  Furthermore,  policy  reforms  that  are  needed  for  the  successful \nimplementation  of  SEDP  2006\u20132010  are  now  or  will  be  supported  by  ADB  through  other \npolicy-based loans to Viet Nam (such as the financial sector program loans and the small and \nmedium-sized  enterprise  development  loans)  and  by  other  development  agencies  both  within \nand outside the framework of the PRSC process. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\n \n\n103.  There  is  a  risk  that  high  inflation  will  persist  long  enough  to  preclude  the  successful \nimplementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010 and, in particular, the achievement of its poverty reduction \ntarget.  There  is  also  a  risk  that  the  ongoing  global  financial  crisis  and  economic  slowdown \ncombined with the macroeconomic stabilization measures recently taken by the Government will \nslacken  growth  in  Viet  Nam  to  a  degree  that  will  render  some  of  the  targets  and  goals  of \nSEDP 2006\u20132010 (including the target related to the poverty rate) impossible to attain. \n \n104.  However, as mentioned above, the macroeconomic situation in Viet Nam has started to \nimprove.  Monthly  inflation  decelerated  significantly  in  June\u2013September  2008,  and  there  was \ndeflation in October 2008. As a result, year-on-year inflation fell in September-October 2008. At \nthe  same  time,  economic  growth  slowed  down  only  moderately  and  remained  quite  high  by \ninternational  standards.  In  the  baseline  scenario  of  the  Asian  Development  Outlook  2008 \nUpdate,  real  GDP  is  projected  to  grow  by  6.5%  in  2007  and  6.0%  in  2008.  Period-average \ninflation  is  forecast  to  decline  from  25.0%  in  2008  to  17.5%  in  2009.37 Moreover,  Viet  Nam\u2019s \nmedium- to long-term economic prospects remain good. Hence, the risks that SEDP 2006\u20132010 \nwill  not  be  successfully  implemented  and  the  expected  outcome  of  the  proposed  program \ncluster will not be attained are rather small. \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n105. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n\n \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe  actions  included  in  the  policy  framework  of  subprogram  1  of  SIPRP  V  and \nspecified in the Development Policy Letter will continue to be in effect during the \nimplementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010; and \nAdequate  and  timely  counterpart  funds  for  carrying  out  these  actions  will  be \nmade available. \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed program cluster and loan would comply with the Articles \n\n106. \nof Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n \n\nthe program cluster to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Support for the \nImplementation of the Poverty Reduction Program V; and \nthe loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 16,439,000 to \nthe  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  subprogram  1  of  the  Support  for  the \nImplementation  of the  Poverty  Reduction  Program  V from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace \nperiod  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  a  term  of  24  years,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  8  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  Agreement  presented  to  the \nBoard. \n\n \n14 November 2008 \n                                                \n37  ADB.  2008.

The country\u2019s overall poverty rate\u2014the proportion of the population living below the \nofficial  poverty  line\u2014has  been  on  a  sustained  downward  trend,  from  58%  in  1993  to  16%  in \n2006, as measured by the Viet Nam Household Living Standards Survey (Table A2.1).1 Much of \nthis  success  is  attributed  to  the  Government\u2019s  ability  to  take  advantage  of  sustained  high \neconomic growth rates. \n \n2. \nGrowth  has  been  particularly  strong  in  the  last  several  years,  with  real  gross  domestic \nproduct (GDP) increasing by an average annual rate of 8% in 2003\u20132007. In 2007, GDP grew \nby 8.5%, the highest rate since 1996. GDP per capita at current prices increased from $441 in \n2002 to $818 in 2007, while GDP per capita in purchasing power parity (PPP) dollars rose from \n$1,649 to $2,587. Inequality, as measured by the Gini index, has increased modestly, from 0.33 \nin 1993 to 0.42 in 2004 and 2006. At the same time, there have been significant improvements \nin social indicators, from increasing net enrollment rates to expanded health insurance coverage \nand improved access to electricity, clean water, and sanitation. These indicators, coupled with \nthe possession of durable goods, reflect significant improvements in people\u2019s standards of living. \nThe  overall  result  is  that  about  35 million  people  have  been  able  to  escape from  poverty  over \n1993\u20131996. In 2006, about 13.4 million people out of the total population of about 84.2 million \nremained poor. Rapid inflation since 2007 is a cause for concern, and may reverse some of the \ngains made in poverty reduction particularly in urban areas. \n \n\nTable A2.1: Poverty Reduction in Viet Nam, 1993\u20132006 \n \n\n1993 \n\n1998 \n\n2002 \n\n2004 \n\n2006 \n\nPopulation group \n\nPoverty rate (%) \n\n  Urban  \n\n  Rural  \n\n  Kinh and Chinese  \n\n  Ethnic minorities  \n\nFood poverty rate (%) \n\n  Urban  \n\n  Rural  \n\n  Kinh and Chinese  \n\n  Ethnic minorities  \n\nPoverty gap (%) \n\n  Urban  \n\n  Rural  \n\n  Kinh and Chinese  \n\n  Ethnic minorities \n\n58.1  \n\n25.1  \n\n66.4  \n\n53.9  \n\n86.4  \n\n24.9  \n\n7.9  \n\n29.1  \n\n20.8  \n\n52.0  \n\n18.5  \n\n6.4  \n\n21.5  \n\n16.0  \n\n34.7  \n\n37.4  \n\n9.2  \n\n45.5  \n\n31.1  \n\n75.2  \n\n15.0  \n\n2.5  \n\n18.6  \n\n10.6  \n\n41.8  \n\n9.5  \n\n1.7  \n\n11.8  \n\n7.1  \n\n24.2  \n\n28.9  \n\n6.6  \n\n35.6  \n\n23.1  \n\n69.3  \n\n10.9  \n\n1.9  \n\n13.6  \n\n6.5  \n\n41.5  \n\n6.9  \n\n1.3  \n\n8.7  \n\n4.7  \n\n19.5  \n\n3.6  \n\n25.0  \n\n13.5  \n\n60.7  \n\n7.4  \n\n0.8  \n\n9.7  \n\n3.5  \n\n4.7  \n\n0.7  \n\n6.1  \n\n2.6  \n\n16.0 \n\n3.9 \n\n20.4 \n\n10.3 \n\n52.3 \n\n6.7 \n\n1.2 \n\n8.7 \n\n3.2 \n\n3.8 \n\n3.2 \n\n4.9 \n\n2.0 \n\n34.2  \n\n29.2 \n\n22.8  \n\n19.2  \n\n15.4 \n\nSource: World Bank. 2007.

All  the  2006  poverty  figures  cited  in  this  appendix  are  based  on \npreliminary analyses. The official final results of the 2006 survey are expected by the end of 2008. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n31 \n\nFood  Poverty  and  the  Poverty  Gap.  The  food  poverty  rate  (the  proportion  of  people \n3. \nwhose  total  expenditure  would  not  suffice  for  a  daily  intake  of  2,100  calories  even  if  it  were \nentirely allocated to food) fell from 25% in 1993 to 7% in 2006. While falling rapidly, food poverty \nstill affects nearly 9% of rural households, and a full 29% of ethnic minority households. But it \nshould  be  noted  that  the  poverty  gap  is  closing;  poor  people  across  all  population  groups  are \nmoving closer to the poverty line. The poverty gap\u2014the average distance from the poverty line, \nsometimes also called the depth of poverty\u2014fell from 6.9% in 2002 to 3.8% in 2006.2 For ethnic \nminorities, the poverty gap in 2006 was similar to that of the Kinh and Chinese majority 13 years \nearlier, in 1993. \n \n4. \nRegional  Disparities.  Though  the  nationwide  progress  is  undeniable,  a  look  beyond \nnational  averages  is required  to gain  a  more  complete  understanding  of  the  poverty  picture  in \nViet Nam. There are significant disparities across regions (Table A2.2). The three regions with \nthe  highest  poverty  rate  in  2006,  well  above  the  national  average  of  16%,  were  the  Northern \nMountains  (30.2%),  the  North  Central  Coast  (29.1%),  and  the  Central  Highlands  (28%).  The \nthree  least-poor  regions  in  2006,  where  the  poverty  rate  was  significantly  below  the  national \naverage,  were  the  Southeast  (5.8%),  the  Red  River  Delta  (8.8%),  and  the  Mekong  Delta \n(10.3%). But even in these relatively better-off areas there are persistent pockets of poverty. \n \n\nTable A2.2: Poverty in Viet Nam by Region, 1993\u20132006 \n(%) \n\nRegion \n\n1993 \n\n1998 \n\n2002 \n\n2004 \n\n2006 \n\nNorthern Mountains  \n\n81.5  \n\n64.2  \n\n43.9  \n38.4  \n\n68.0  \n\n35.4  \n29.4  \n\n58.6  \n\n30.2 \n25.0 \n\n49.0 \n\nNortheast  \n\nNorthwest \n\n \n\n \n62.7  \n74.5  \n47.2  \n70.0  \n37.0  \n47.1  \n58.1  \n\n \n\n \n29.3  \n48.1  \n34.5  \n52.4  \n12.2  \n36.9  \n37.4  \n\nRed River Delta  \n\nCentral Highlands  \n\nNorth Central Coast  \n\nSouth Central Coast  \n\n8.8 \n29.1 \n12.6 \n28.6 \n5.8 \n10.3 \nMekong Delta  \nViet Nam  \n16.0 \nSource: World Bank. 2007.

Viet  Nam  is \nurbanizing, but in 2006 the population was still about three-quarters rural. The rural poverty rate, \nat 20.4%, is substantially higher than the urban poverty rate of 3.9%, and the rural poor made \nup more than 93% of the country\u2019s poor people (Table A2.3). Farmers are the vast majority of \nthe  rural  population,  and  the  poverty  rate  is  much  higher  among  rice  farmers  (23.4%)  than \namong non-rice farmers (7.5%). While the urban poverty rate is very low, the 2006 data indicate \nthat  it  is  increasing.  As  it  is  the  first  time  in  many  years  that  poverty  has  been  shown  to  be \nincreasing,  it  is  important  to  assess  the  causes.  The  analysis  in  the  Vietnam  Development \nReport 2008 points to increasingly higher prices in the cities as a plausible explanation, citing a \nboom in real estate prices, which has increased the cost of retail trade and other services in the \n\n                                                \n2   World  Bank.  2007.

Therefore, even basic staples can cost significantly more than in rural areas. \nHigher  prices  in  urban  areas  can  result  in  lower  living  standards  for  those  whose  earnings  do \nnot grow accordingly and could push the near-poor into poverty. It must be noted that the rising \nurban poverty measured in 2006 was likely to have been worsened by the high inflation in 2007 \nand 2008. \n \n\nTable A2.3: Distribution of Poverty in Viet Nam, 2006 \n(%) \n\nPopulation group \n\nShare of \nPopulation \n\nPoverty \nRate \n\nPoverty \nGap \n\nContribution to \nTotal Poverty \n\nTotal population \n\n100.0 \n\n16.0 \n\n \n\n \n\nRural  \n\nUrban  \n\n73.3  \n\n20.4  \n\n26.7  \n\n3.9  \n\nKinh and Hoa  \n\n86.5  \n\n10.2  \n\nEthnic minorities  \n\n13.5  \n\n52.2  \n\n15.4  \n\nNonfarmers  \n\nFarmers  \n\n29.0  \n\n5.0  \n\n71.0  \n\n20.4  \n\n3.8 \n\n4.9  \n\n0.8  \n\n2.0  \n\n1.1  \n\n4.9  \n\n100.0 \n\n93.6 \n\n6.4 \n\n55.6 \n\n44.4 \n\n9.1 \n\n90.9 \n\nSource: World Bank. 2008.

Hanoi. \n\n \n6. \nPoverty  and  Ethnic  Minorities.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  impressive  growth  story  has  unfortunately \nnot benefited all population groups equally. Ethnic minorities\u201453 officially recognized groups\u2014 \ncompose about 13.5% of the Vietnamese population. Minorities, with an average poverty rate of \n52.2%  in  2006,  are  significantly  worse  off  than  the  majority  Kinh.  By  comparison,  the  poverty \nrate  among the  Kinh  and  Chinese  was just  10.3%. With the  exception  of  the  Chinese  and  the \nKhmer  and  Cham, the  remaining  50  ethnic groups mostly  reside  in remote,  mountainous  rural \nareas  and  are  economically  and  socially  disadvantaged  across  a  range  of  dimensions.  The \nmembers of ethnic minority groups are more than four times as likely to be poor than the Kinh \nand Hoa, and are also more likely to be malnourished, illiterate, and suffering from poor health. \nAccording to the 2004 Viet Nam Household Living Standards Survey, less than one-third (29%) \nof  all  ethnic  minority  adults  aged  18  and  older  had  completed  lower  secondary  education. \nPhysical  access  to  social  services  in  challenging  mountainous  terrain  is  a  major  constraint. \nEthnic minority children who are able to attend secondary school are faced with a major barrier \nto  academic  achievement  in  limited  proficiency  in  the  Vietnamese  language.  Poorly  equipped \nschools,  limited  teacher  supply,  and  teaching  methods  that  fail  to  respond  to  the  needs  of \nnonnative  speakers  can  perpetuate  social  exclusion  and  isolation.  Despite  composing  a \nrelatively small share of the national population, minorities accounted for about 44% of the poor \nin 2006. Some government agencies forecast an increase in the number of the ethnic minority \npoor, to more than half of Viet Nam\u2019s poor population by 2010.3  \n \n7. \nthe majority (Kinh and Chinese) and ethnic minorities (an aggregation of all other ethnic groups). \nHowever,  ethnic  minorities  are  in fact  a  heterogeneous  group.  Statistically  representative  data \n\nMost analyses of ethnic minority poverty in Viet Nam have compared two populations\u2014\n\n                                                \n3   Baulch, Bob. 2008.

The  Vietnam  Development  Report  2008 \nfinds that ethnic minority groups based in the lowlands (Khmer and Cham) have seen dramatic \nrates  of  poverty  reduction.  Valley-dwelling  rice  farmers  in  the  Northern  Mountains  (Tay,  Thai, \nMuong  and  Nung)  have  also  fared  relatively  better  in  terms  of  poverty  reduction.  But  other \nminorities  in  the  Northern  Mountains,  the  Central  Highlands,  and  the  South  and  North  Central \nCoasts remain extremely poor. The lack of progress for these groups tends to be hidden by the \nmore  rapid  improvements  among  the  larger  ethnic  minority  groups.  For  example,  the  overall \npoverty rate in the Central Highlands fell by a full 23 percentage points between 2002 and 2006. \nHowever,  the  disaggregated  data  suggest  that  there  has  been  almost  no  movement  in  living \nstandards for minority groups in that region (including the Jarai, E-de, Ba Na, and Xo Dang). \n \n8. \nPoverty  Measurement. Two different poverty measurement methodologies are applied \nin  Viet  Nam\u2014one  by  the  General  Statistics  Office  of  Viet  Nam  (GSO)  and  a  second  by  the \nMinistry  of  Labor,  Invalids  and  Social  Affairs  (MOLISA).  The  GSO  implements  the  Viet  Nam \nHousehold  Living  Standards  Survey,  an  international  standard  living  standards  survey.  The \npoverty  rate  is  the  percentage  of  the  population  that  cannot  afford  a  consumption  basket  that \ncomprises  food  and  nonfood  items,  with  food  expenditure  being  high  enough  to  secure  2,100 \ncalories  per  day  for  each  household  member.  The  food  poverty  rate  is  the  proportion  of  the \npopulation that is too poor to afford the food part of the consumption basket, even if they did not \npurchase any nonfood items. The cost of the consumption basket (food plus nonfood) is referred \nto as the poverty line. The survey measures household expenditure.  \n \nThe MOLISA methodology is based on household income. In the 1990s MOLISA defined \n9. \nthe  national  poverty  line  as  the  income  equivalent  needed  to  buy  15,  20,  and  25  kilograms  of \nrice  per  person  per  month  for  mountainous,  rural,  and  urban  areas,  respectively.  In  a  2005 \nmethodology  revision,  MOLISA  increased  the  poverty  line  from  D150,000  to  D260,000  per \nperson  per  month  for  urban  areas  and  from  D100,000  to  D200,000  for  rural  areas  (including \nmountainous  and  remote  areas).4 Under  certain  conditions,  province  and  city  administrations \nare authorized to raise the poverty line to allow more households to qualify for poverty programs. \nAfter  revising  the  definition  of  the  poverty  line  in  2005,  MOLISA  estimated  that  26%  of  the \npopulation  was  classified  as  poor  at  the  end  of  2005,  nearly  twice  the  percentage  under  the \nearlier  definition.  This  estimate  fell  to  18.7%  of  households  in  2006,  and  14.8%  in  2007.  The \nMOLISA approach to poverty assessment is more \u201cbottom\u2013up,\u201d as its local offices identify poor \nhouseholds  consultation  with  villagers.  The  Vietnam  Development  Report  2008  assesses  the \nGSO and MOLISA methods as essentially complementary, as the GSO metric is more reliable \nat aggregate levels while the MOLISA metric is better at the commune level. \n \n10. \nInternational  Poverty  Lines.  It  is  not  surprising  that  poverty  measured  against  the \ninternational  poverty  lines  of  $1-a-day  and  $2-a-day  in  1993  PPP  dollars  has  also  fallen \ndramatically  in  Viet  Nam  (Table  A2.4).  From  more  than  half  of  the  population  in  1990,  the \n$1-a-day  poverty  rate  fell  to  just  4%  of  the  population  in  2007.  It  is  generally  accepted  that \npoverty  measured  in  this  way  is  more  of  a  tool  for  international  comparisons  over  time  rather \nthan current national policy-making or targeting, as the present value of $1 in 1993 PPP terms is \nextremely low. However, a look at the $2-a-day poverty head count sheds light on vulnerability \nto  poverty.  In  2006,  more  than  one-third  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  population  (36.3%)  fell  below  the \n$2-a-day  poverty  line.  Recalling  the  official  national  poverty  rate  of  16%,  the  significant \n\n                                                \n4  Under certain circumstances, provinces and cities are authorized to raise the poverty line to allow more households \n\nto qualify for poverty programs. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\ndifference between the two indicates that a large share of the population subsists on the lower \nside of the income distribution, and is thus particularly vulnerable to falling into poverty.  \n\n \nTable A2.4: $1-a-Day and $2-a-Day Poverty in Viet Nam, 1990\u20132007 \n \n\n$1-a-Day \n\n \n\n$2-a-Day \n\nPoverty \nRate \n(%) \n50.8 \n23.6 \n16.9 \n13.6 \n7.8 \n4.0 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nPoverty \nMagnitude  \n(million) \n33.6 \n17.3 \n13.0 \n10.9 \n6.4 \n3.4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nPoverty \nRate \n(%) \n87.0 \n69.4 \n65.9 \n58.2 \n43.9 \n32.9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nPoverty \nMagnitude \n(million) \n57.6 \n50.8 \n50.5 \n46.4 \n36.0 \n28.1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nTotal \nPopulation \n(million) \n66.2 \n73.2 \n76.6 \n79.7 \n82.0 \n85.3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nYear \n1990 \n1996 \n1999 \n2002 \n2004 \n2007 \n\nNote: The World Bank sets the international poverty lines at $1.08 and $2.15 per person per \nday  (1993  purchasing  power  parity  dollars)  for  all  countries.

According to the most recent progress report for Asia \nand  the  Pacific,  Viet  Nam  is  an  early  achiever  for  most  of  the  Millennium  Development  Goals \n(MDGs). 5  Early  MDG  achievement  is  reported  for  the  targets  of  reducing  poverty  and  the \nincidence  of  underweight  children,  achieving  gender  equality  at  the  secondary  level,  reducing \nthe under-five mortality and infant mortality rates, reducing the tuberculosis prevalence rate and \ndeath rate, maintaining forest cover and protected areas, and increasing access to clean water \nin urban and rural areas and sanitation in urban areas (Table A2.5). The rate of progress toward \nthe rural sanitation target is considered on track, as is the primary cohort survival rate (e.g., the \nproportion  of  children  starting  grade  1  that  reach  grade  5).  The  less-encouraging  news  is  that \nViet  Nam  is  making  only  slow  progress  on  gender  equality  at  the  primary  level.  Offtrack \nMDGs\u2014where there is either no progress or regression\u2014include the targets related to primary \nenrollment  and  primary completion rates, gender  equality  at the tertiary level,  HIV  prevalence, \nand carbon dioxide emissions. Viet Nam is commendable for its development of additional goals, \nbeyond the MDGs, as part of the process of developing their national development targets. The \nViet  Nam  Development Goals  (VDGs)  are  the  local  version  of the  MDGs  and  are,  in  a  sense, \nmore ambitious.  \n \n\n                                                \n5   UN  ESCAP,  ADB,  UNDP.  2007.

The  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy  is  embedded  in  the  Socioeconomic \nDevelopment Plan (SEDP) 2006\u20132010.  \n \n13. \nSocioeconomic  Development  Plan  2006\u20132010.  The  National  Assembly  approved \nSEDP 2006\u20132010 in 2006. Unlike previous plans, SEDP 2006\u20132010 was prepared in an open \nand  participatory  manner  involving  extensive  consultations  with  civil  society,  businesses,  and \ndevelopment  agencies.  It  is  oriented  more  toward  attaining  development  outcomes  (including \npoverty reduction) and less toward achieving production targets. The SEDP has a strong results \norientation, with performance indicators that include the VDGs and the MDGs. Its goals include \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\naverage annual real GDP growth of at least 7.5% and a reduction in the poverty rate to 10%\u2013\n11%  in  2010  (from  22%  in  2005).  SEDP  2006\u20132010  sets  out  desired  development  outcomes \nand  the  policy  reforms  needed  to  attain  them.  It  relies  on  analysis  rather  than  administrative \nreporting to substantiate its recommendations and includes a framework for monitoring progress. \nThe SEDP identifies appropriate policies and aligns resources with those policies, which fall into \nthree  main  pillars:  (i)  business  development,  (ii)  inclusive  growth,  and  (iii) natural  resource \nmanagement.  Governance  and  institutional  development  is  a  crosscutting  theme  to  deliver  in \nthe  three  pillars. The  joint  International  Development  Association\u2013International  Monetary  Fund \nstaff advisory note on Viet Nam\u2019s poverty reduction strategy dated 5 December 2006 concludes \nthat SEDP 2006\u20132010 has the key features of a poverty reduction strategy and is likely to lead \nto economic growth and poverty reduction.6 \n \nThe SEDP\u2019s overarching goal statement is supported by eight core task areas, of which \n14. \nthe  sixth  pertains  particularly  to  poverty  reduction  and  social  development:  \u201crealize  social \nprogress, equity, and gender equality; create jobs, encourage wealth creation through legitimate \nchannels, reduce poverty and alleviate hunger, develop the social security system and prevent \nsocial  problems.\u201d 7  Unlike  the  previous  plan  (SEDP  2001\u20132005),  this  one  clearly  defines \ndevelopment  targets,  identifies  appropriate  policies,  and  aligns  resources  with  those  policies. \nThe  stated goals  in  the area  of \u201csocial  affairs\u201d  are  to  continue  on  a  path  toward  achieving  the \nMDGs, as follows:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nUniversal  lower  secondary  education  is  achieved.  By  2010  tertiary  education  is \nprovided to 200 per 10,000 people. Trained labor rate reaches 40% of total social \nlabor. \nAll  households  in  need  have  access  to  housing  at  14\u201315  square  meters  per \ncapita, telephone density reaches 35 sets per 100 people, Internet subscriptions \nare 12.6 per 100 people, Internet users are 48% of the population, with expanded \nuse of information technology. \nThe  population  growth  rate  is  low  at  1.14%,  population  does  not  exceed \n88.4 million, and the urban population is about 26.4 million. \nJobs  are  created  for  more  than  8  million  laborers,  meaning  an  average  of  1.6 \nmillion jobs per year. Vocational training is offered to 7.5 million people, of whom \n25%\u201330% receive long-term training. The urban unemployment rate stays below \n5%. \nThe agricultural labor force is reduced to 50% of the population. \nAverage life expectancy is 72 years. \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii)  Maternal mortality is reduced to less than 70 per 100,000 live births, the number \nof  doctors  reaches  7  per  100,000  people,  and  pharmacists  with  university \ndegrees reach 1\u20131.2 per 10,000, with hospital beds at 26.3 per 10,000 people. \n\n(iv) \n\n(viii)  Food poverty is eliminated, and the poverty rate is reduced to 10%\u201311% by 2010.  \n \n15. \nThis  SEDP  makes  stronger  references  to  participatory  and  inclusive  approaches  than \nprevious  plans,  following  on  the  CPGRS  which  stated  that  poverty  reduction  enables  poor \ncommunities  to  take  initiative,  and  encouraged  self-help  efforts.  The  CPRGS  set  out  the \nGovernment\u2019s  intent  to  involve  civil  society  and  community  organizations  at  the  local  level  to \nimprove  the  participation  of  the  poor  in  the  development  process.

Social protection expands opportunities, enhances equity, and \nprotects  against  risks  and  shocks.  Targeted  programs  focus  on  particularly  disadvantaged \ngroups and geographic areas. \n \nViet Nam fares reasonably well in comparison with the 30 other countries in Asia and the \n17. \nPacific  according  to  ADB\u2019s  social  protection  index  (SPI).9 The  SPI  values  range  from  a  low  of \n0.01 (Papua New Guinea) to a high of 0.96 (Japan). Viet Nam\u2019s SPI of 0.38 ranks the country at \n13 out of 31, just below Nauru but above Malaysia. The SPI is a composite index based on four \nsocial  protection  summary  indicators.  Expenditure  measures  total  expenditure  on  all  social \nprotection  programs  as  a  share  of  GDP  (0.041  in  Viet  Nam).  Coverage  measures  the \nbeneficiaries of targeted social protection as a share of the reference population group, i.e., the \nelderly,  the  disabled,  the  unemployed,  etc.  (0.40).  Distribution  calculates  the  number  of \nbeneficiaries who are poor as a share of the poor population, or efficiency of poverty targeting \n(0.71). Impact is the average social protection expenditure for each poor person as a share of \nthe national poverty line (0.17). Viet Nam falls into the group of countries with an average SPI \nranking (the all-Asia average is 0.36). The policy priority for countries with average SPIs is likely \nto  be  improving  the  efficiency,  functioning,  and  targeting  of  current  programs.  The  social \nprotection summary indicator for impact, at 17%, is lower than the average of 23% for Asia. \n \nSocial  Safety  Nets.  Social  safety  net  programs  (e.g.,  social  assistance  and  child \n18. \nprotection) account for 29% of Viet Nam\u2019s total social protection expenditure (27.4% and 1.6% \nrespectively).  The  target  group  coverage  ratios  are  64.6%  of  the  poor,  100%  of  the  disabled, \nand  62.4%  of  targeted  children.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  overall  social  protection  summary  indicator  for \ncoverage,  at  0.40,  is  high;  only  eight  other  countries  have  values  higher  than  this.  In  a \ndecentralized country like Viet Nam, the amount of budgetary resources at the local level has a \nmajor  influence  on  the  ability  to  implement  social  policy,  deliver  social  services,  and  provide \nsafety  nets.  According  to  the  Vietnam  Development  Report  2008,  powerful  allocation  norms \nhave been set up to transfer resources from richer to poorer provinces (on a scale much larger \nthan  similar  efforts  in  richer  countries)  but  there  has  been  less  progress  in  the  allocation  of \nprovincial  resources  to  districts,  communes,  and  below.  In  general,  programs  targeted  to \nspecific  households  are  of  mixed  quality.  Some  have  considerable  impact  but  others  are  less \neffective. \n \n19. \nLabor  Market  Programs.  The  SPI  assessment  of  social  protection  expenditure  by \ncategory  of  program  shows  that  only  7.7%  of  the  total  goes  toward  labor  market  programs \n\n                                                \n8  The  Grassroots  Democracy  Decree  79  (2003)  institutionalizes  the  participation  of  local  communities  and \ncommunity-based  organizations  in  development  activities.  A  UNDP  assessment  finds  that  Viet  Nam\u2019s  legal \nframework for facilitating participation and consultation is well-developed, but that local people\u2019s knowledge of and \naccess  to  the  \u201cthe  legal  framework\u201d  is  limited  and  consequently  tends  to  be  interpreted  by  officials  at  their  own \ndiscretion. http://www.un.org.vn/undp/projects/vie02007/News2005/project_supports_undp_assessment.htm \n\n9   ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\n(direct  employment  generation,  labor  exchanges  and  other  employment  services,  skills \ndevelopment and training, and the development of labor legislation) in Viet Nam. \n \n20. \nEach  of  the  country\u2019s  64  provinces  has  a  vocational  training  center  under  the  local \ndepartment  of  labor,  invalids,  and  social  affairs.  The  Government  implements  a  National \nTargeted  Program  on  Job  Generation  and  provides  credit  through  the  National  Fund  for  Job \nCreation and the Social Policy Bank. The vocational training system is being strengthened and \ndiversified  to  meet  the  demands  of  the  labor  market.  The  Government  does  not  provide \nunemployment insurance, but it does give (i) allowances for early retirement; (ii) access to credit \nfor  opening  new  business  after  retirement;  and  (iii)  free  vocational  training  for  the  poor  in \ngovernment-run  vocational  training  centers.  In  the  ADB  SPI  analysis  of  target  group  coverage \nratios,  only  9.4%  of  the  unemployed  and  underemployed  are  covered  by  social  protection \nprograms. \n \n21. \nViet  Nam  introduced  a  minimum  wage  for  foreign-invested  companies  in  1990  and  for \ndomestic enterprises in 1993. The former varies by region; the latter is uniform throughout the \ncountry. The ratio between minimum and average wages in domestic enterprises has increased \nmoderately,  from  25%  in  1998  to  32%  in  2006,  but  minimum  wages  applying  to  foreign \ncompanies  remain  substantially  higher.  The  margin  varies  from  more  than  50%  to  more  than \n90%  depending  on the  region. This  is  incompatible  with  the  national  treatment  principle  of  the \nWorld Trade Organization. Viet Nam thus needs to unify the minimum wage, and this will mean \nincreasing  the  domestic  enterprise  minimum  wage.  This  may  affect  employment  creation  and \nformalization.  \n \nOld-Age  Pensions. Before doi moi Viet Nam only had an old-age pension program for \n22. \ncivil  servants  and  workers  in  state-owned  enterprises.  Coverage  was  extended  in  1993  to \ndomestic  and  foreign  private  enterprises  on  a  contributory  basis.  These  programs  are \nadministered  by  Viet  Nam  Social  Security  (VSS).  There  is  also  a  noncontributory  scheme  for \npeople over 85 who lack resources (administered by MOLISA). The system is now undergoing \nmajor  and  rapid  reform.  The  first  Social  Insurance  Law  was  passed  in  2006,  with  various \nelements  being  implemented  over  2007\u20132009.  The  aim  is  to  expand  coverage  and  ensure \nfinancial sustainability. Along with a voluntary pension program for informal sector workers, the \ncompulsory program applies to all Vietnamese working in any enterprise provided they have at \nleast  a  3-month  contract. To  receive  a  pension, participants  must  contribute for  20  years. The \nminimum pension is set equal to the minimum wage; the maximum is 75% of the average salary. \nRetirement age is relatively low at 55 for women and 60 for men. The main difference between \nthe  voluntary  and  the  compulsory  programs  is  that  under  the  voluntary  scheme  there  is  no \nceiling on contributions and no minimum pension. \n \n23. \nParticipation in the compulsory scheme is growing steadily from its low base, with about \n8  million  active  contributors  in  2007  (18%  of  the  labor  force  and  54%  of  employment  in \nstate-owned  enterprises,  foreign  companies,  and  private  domestic  firms).  In  2007  there  were \nabout 1.9 million pensioners, about 25% of the population aged 60 and above. But almost half \nof pension spending went to the richest two quintiles, with only 2% to the poorest\u2014the pension \nsystem  is  thus  not  pro-poor.  Whether  the  national  voluntary  pension  program  for  the  informal \nsector  will  attract  many  members  is  not  yet  clear.  The  largest  voluntary  pension  scheme  in \nViet Nam operates in the province of Nghe An, with about 85,000 participants in 2007. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n39 \n\nTargeted Programs for Poverty Reduction.10 Viet Nam implements a host of targeted \n24. \nprograms to reach the most disadvantaged. Some provide cash support to particular vulnerable \ngroups;  others  deliver  other  forms  of  targeted  assistance  to  disadvantaged  groups  or  regions. \nThe pricing of utilities such as water can also be based on different groups\u2019 ability to pay. Cash \ntransfers  are  paid  out  by  social  guarantee  funds,  which  provide  regular  relief  to  defined \nvulnerable  groups  and  to  war  veterans  and  war  invalids.  Subsidies  are  provided  through  the \nNational  Targeted  Program  for  Poverty  Reduction  (NTPPR),  formerly  the  Hunger  Eradication \nand  Poverty  Reduction  Program.  Development  assistance  to  poor  communes  is  managed \nthrough  program  135  (program  for  socioeconomic  development  in  communes  facing  extreme \nhardship  in  ethnic  minority  and  mountainous  areas),  whereas  program  132  and  program  134 \nseek  to  support  ethnic  minorities  with  agricultural  and  residential  land,  housing,  and  water \nsupply. These initiatives differ not only in the nature of the benefits they provide, but also in the \ntargeting techniques they apply to identify beneficiaries. \n \n25. \nActivities  under  the  NTPPR  2006\u20132010  fall  into  three  areas:  (i)  development  of \nproductive  activities  of  the  poor,  (ii)  provision  of  access  to  basic  services,  and  (iii)  capacity \ndevelopment and monitoring. The first area includes the largest single component of the NTPPR, \nthe provision of preferential credit. The second area focuses on health care, education, housing, \nwater  supply,  and  legal aid.  A  total  of  D43.5  trillion  has  been  allocated to  this  program  over  a \n5-year period, with 60% going to the provision of preferential credit. The central budget covers \n29%  of  the  envelope,  with  local  governments  and  local  communities  expected  to  contribute  a \nfurther 5% and 6%, respectively. \n \n26. \nThe  NTPPR,  like  its  predecessor  (the  Hunger  Eradication  and  Poverty  Reduction \nProgram 2001\u20132005), targets households that have been identified as poor using the MOLISA \nmethodology. In practice, whether household income is above or below the threshold is decided \nthrough  a  combination  of  surveys  and  community  discussions.  Program  135  is  geographically \ntargeted. The first phase of the program allocated D700 million per year to identified communes. \nPoverty  maps  show  that  the  communes  targeted  by  program  135  were  generally  those  with \nhigher  poverty  rates.  Targeting  issues  arise  at  lower  levels,  as  resource  allocation  may  favor \nwealthier  villages  within  a  commune  and  not  everyone  in  a  village  is  necessarily  poor.  The \nsecond phase of program 135 (2006\u20132010) is tackling these issues by requiring the inclusion of \nboth  poorer  villages  within  the  poorest  \u201czone  III\u201d  communes  and  the  poorest  villages  in  the \nless-poor \u201czone II\u201d communes. \n \n27. \nThe  overall  number  of  beneficiaries from  targeted  programs  is not  easy  to  estimate. In \nthe case of the Social Guarantee Fund for Regular Relief, it has increased more than threefold \nover  the  first  part  of  the  decade.  The  number  of  beneficiaries  has  risen  in  all  categories.  Yet, \nregular relief in the form of monthly cash transfers to vulnerable groups still covers only a small \nfraction  (about  0.5%)  of the  Vietnamese  population.  Although funding  has  increased, reaching \nD750  billion  in  2007,  it  remains  an  important  constraint.  The  resources  supporting  these  cash \ntransfers  come  from  a  combination  of  national  and  local  sources,  with  their  amount  varying \nwidely across the country. \n\n                                                \n10 This discussion is summarized from World Bank. 2007. Vietnam Development Report 2008: Social Protection. Joint \ndonor  report  to  the  Vietnam  Consultative  Group  Meeting,  Hanoi,  6\u20137  December  2007  (Chapter  7:  Targeted \nPrograms). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\nD. \n\nChallenges in Poverty Reduction \n\n28. \nPersistent  Pockets  of  Poverty.  Though  the  overall  poverty  reduction  picture  is \nimpressive, there are still about 13.4 million people living in poverty in Viet Nam, with 5\u20136 million \nexperiencing  food  poverty.  It  is  important  to  focus  on  those  places  and  populations  where \npoverty  persists,  and  to  understand  the  reasons  why  they  are  not  benefiting  from  economic \ngrowth  like  the  majority  of  the  population.  Ethnic  minorities  are  at  a  major  disadvantage,  and, \nwhile some of the targeted programs work well, much more remains to be done. \n \n29. \nRising Urban Poverty. Certainly poverty remains an overwhelmingly rural phenomenon. \nBut the figures for 2006 suggest that economic growth alone may not be sufficient to deal with \npoverty  in  urban  areas. The  major  cities  of  Viet Nam  have  been  booming for many  years,  but \nurban poverty appears to have stabilized, if not increased, from 2004 to 2006. Statistical issues \nnotwithstanding, 11  any  increase  raises  questions  in  a  country  where  poverty  has  fallen \nconsistently  and  rapidly  over  the  past  13  years.  Understanding  why  this  is  so  particularly \nimportant for adjusting social protection policies in a period of rapid urbanization (footnote 2). \n \n30. \nHigh Vulnerability to Poverty. From the large difference between the $1-a-day and the \n$2-a-day poverty rate (4% and 33% in 2007, respectively) it is clear that many Vietnamese can \nbe  considered  near-poor,  and  thus  particularly  vulnerable  to  falling  into  poverty  in  the  face  of \nshocks. Global macroeconomic conditions  have deteriorated  since the  second  half  of 2007. In \naddition  to  a  slowdown  in  industrial  countries,  there  is  considerable  uncertainty  in  financial \nmarkets and a surge in the world prices of commodities. Increases in the international prices of \nrice  and  oil  are  of  particular  concern.

The Ministry of Finance (MOF) has prepared an assessment report on the \ninternal trading of general corporations and economic groups. It also held a conference on \nstate-owned enterprise reform on 23 April 2008. At the conference, MOF presented a report \non investments in noncore businesses (such as banking) by some general corporations and \neconomic groups, together with some warnings and recommendations on adjusting the cap \non investments in noncore businesses by general corporations and economic groups. These \nrecommendations have been incorporated into the government decree that is now being \ndrafted to replace Decree 199/2004. \nCompleted. Equitization plans for Vietcombank and Mekong Housing Bank were approved \nby Prime Minister\u2019s Decision 1289/QD-TTg of 26 September 2007 and Decision 313/QD-TTg \nof 24 March 2008, respectively. Both plans provide for an initial public offering and the first \ngeneral meeting of shareholders.  \n \nThe equitization of Vietcombank has essentially been completed. The bank held an initial \npublic offering in December 2007 and the first general meeting of shareholders in April 2008.  \n\n5\n0\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n6\n \n\ni\n\n3. Issue a road map to \nenhance bank supervision, \nincluding offsite supervision \nand risk management tools  \n\nCompleted. By his Decision 1976/QD-NHNN of 24 August 2007, the Governor of the State \nBank of Viet Nam (SBV) approved a proposal for the organizational and operational reform \nof banking supervision, including off-site supervision and risk management tools. On \n31 January 2008, SBV adopted Plan 1094/KH-NHNN implementing this proposal. \n\n4. Rationalize incentives \nrelated to the enterprise \nincome tax and simplify tax \nprocedures for household \nbusinesses \n\n5. Raise the cap on \nshareholdings by a single \nforeign investor in unlisted \ncompanies \n\nCompleted. Circular 134/2007/TT-BTC issued on 23 November 2007 specified the \ndeductible and nondeductible items for the corporate income tax (CIT) through a positive list \n(deductible items) and a negative list (nondeductible items). The revised Law on Corporate \nIncome Tax adopted by the National Assembly on 3 June 2008 further rationalized incentives \nrelated to the CIT. \n \nAt present, household businesses pay the CIT. However, after the Law on Personal Income \nTax takes effect on 1 January 2009, revenues of household businesses can be declared \n(and taxed) as individual income. Household businesses will be able to pay the personal \nincome tax instead of the CIT.  \nCompleted. According to Government Decree 139/2007/ND-CP of 5 September 2007 \nguiding the implementation of the Enterprise Law, foreign investors may hold up to 100% of \nshares in unlisted companies (other than those that are subject to sector-specific restrictions \non private or foreign ownership). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nReform Area \n\nAction \n\nStatus \n\n6.

Establish a list of \nindicators, data sources, and \na reporting mechanism for  \nthe monitoring of the SEDP  \n \n\nCompleted. On 3 March 2008, the Government approved a plan to separate power \ntransmission and generation assets and regroup transmission assets under a single National \nPower Transmission Corporation. The corporation became operational on 1 July 2008. It is \nresponsible for the construction, operation, and maintenance of Viet Nam\u2019s power \ntransmission network, including 220 kilovolt (kV) and 500 kV lines and substations. \n\nCompleted. In accordance with Prime Minister Decision 139/2002/QD-TTg of \n15 October 2002, the Government\u2019s contribution to health insurance for the poor was set at \nD50,000 per person per year, and raised to D60,000 per person per year in 2006, D80,000 in \n2007, and D130,000 in 2008. The Government is now considering setting its contribution at \n3.0% of the minimum wage. This will further increase the contribution (since the minimum \nwage is now D540,000 per month). Furthermore, the Prime Minister issued \nDecision 289/2008/QD-TTg on 18 March 2008, which allowed the near-poor to join the \nvoluntary health insurance program, with 50% of their insurance premium contributed by the \nGovernment. On 24 September 2008, the Ministry of Health and the MOF issued an \ninterministerial circular 10/2008/TLLT-BYT-BTC on the implementation of this Decision. \n\nCompleted. Until recently, river basin management was effectively carried out by both the \nMinistry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE) and the Ministry of Agriculture and \nRural Development (MARD). Government Decree 01/2008/ND-CP of 3 January 2008 on the \nfunctions and tasks of MARD did not include river basin management in the list of functions \nof MARD. At the same time, Government Decree 25/2008/ND-CP of 4 March 2008 listed \nintegrated river basin management as a key function of MONRE and authorized the latter to \nrepresent Viet Nam in the Mekong River Council. \n\nCompleted. By its Decision 555/2007/QD-BKH of 30 May 2007, the Ministry of Planning and \nInvestment (MPI) approved a results-based monitoring and evaluation framework for the \nSocioeconomic Development Plan (SEDP) 2006\u20132010. The framework specifies monitoring \nindicators and agencies responsible for reporting on individual indicators. In accordance with \nGovernment Resolution 02/2008/NQ-CP of 9 January 2008, MPI is now preparing a decree \non annual reporting on the implementation of SEDP. This decree will further clarify the \nreporting mechanism for the monitoring and evaluation of SEDP.  \n\n10. Issue regulations on the \ncontents and timing of \ndisclosure of State Audit of \nViet Nam (SAV) reports, \nincluding audits reports of \nindividual entities \n\nCompleted. On 26 July 2007, SAV issued Decision 03/2007/QD-KTNN on the disclosure of \naudit results and reports on the implementation of its audit conclusions and \nrecommendations. The decision defined (i) responsibilities for the disclosure, (ii) reports to \nbe disclosed, and (iii) timing and means of disclosure. It also defines three types of reports \nthat are subject to disclosure. These are (i) annual audit reports, (ii) reports on the \nimplementation of audit conclusions and recommendations, and (iii) the audit reports and the \naudit minutes pertaining to audits of individual entities. \n\n \n\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n6\n \n\ni\n\n5\n1\n \n\n \n\n\fReform Area \n\nAction \n\nStatus \n\n11.

Implement the asset \ndeclaration requirement in \nregard to senior officials and \ntheir immediate families, with \npenalties for noncompliance \n\nCompleted. On 22 June 2007, the Prime Minister issued Decision 93/2007/QD-TTg on \u201cone-\nstop shop\u201d and interagency \u201cone-stop shop\u201d mechanisms in local state administrative \nagencies. The decision required all local public service agencies to introduce an OSS \nmechanism or an interagency OSS mechanism. Several provinces and cities have already \ndone so. The Ministry of Home Affairs has organized training courses for officials specialized \nin administrative reforms in all provinces. It has also issued a guiding document on the \nallowance for civil servants working at the OSS offices to encourage the fulfillment of their \ntasks.  \n \nOn 7 November 2007, the Government issued Resolution 53/2007/NQ-CP, which called for \nthe pilot-testing of the OSS mechanism in seven ministries at the national level\u2014the Ministry \nof Culture, Sports and Tourism; the Ministry of Finance; the Ministry of Home Affairs; the \nMinistry of Industry and Trade; the Ministry of Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs; the Ministry \nof Natural Resources and Environment; and the Ministry of Planning and Investment. \n\nCompleted. Asset declaration was introduced by the Anti-Corruption Law of 2006 and its \nimplementation Decree 37/2007/ND-CP of 9 March 2007, which stipulated disciplinary \nmeasures for noncompliance. To implement the law and decree, the Government \nInspectorate issued Circular 2442/TT-TTCP of 13 November 2007, which provided detailed \npractical guidelines for the declaration process, and Official Letter 533/CCTN-TTCP of \n2 April 2008, which introduced a standard template for reporting by ministries, agencies, and \nprovinces.

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n\nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nViet  Nam\u2019s poverty  reduction strategy  is  embedded in the Socioeconomic  Development Plan  (SEDP)  2006\u20132010. \nIts development goals (the country\u2019s version of the Millennium Development Goals), the key targets pursued by the \nSEDP,  include  eliminating  food  poverty  and  reducing  the  poverty  rate  to  10%\u201311%  by  2010.  The  SEDP  also \nidentifies  appropriate  policies  and  aligns  resources  with  those  policies,  which  are  concerned  with  (i) promoting \ngrowth  and  transition  to  a  market  economy,  (ii)  reducing  poverty  and  ensuring  social  inclusion,  (iii) managing  the \nenvironment  and  natural  resources,  and  (iv)  building  institutions  to  support  the  strategy.  The  joint  International \nDevelopment  Association\u2013International  Monetary  Fund  staff  advisory  note  of  December  2006  concluded  that \nSEDP 2006\u20132010 has the key features of a poverty reduction strategy and is likely to lead to economic growth and \npoverty  reduction.  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  2007\u20132010  for  Viet  Nam  supports  the  implementation  of \nSEDP 2006\u20132010. \n \nThe SEDP policies, however, are considered remarkably broad and must be prioritized and sequenced. Measures \nmust be selected within each of the pillars and attention must be paid to the content of the most important ones. The \nWorld Bank\u2019s poverty reduction support credits (PRSCs) are multisector instruments well suited to satisfying these \nrequirements. The first PRSC cycle provided effective support for policy reforms, according to several independent \nevaluations. The second PRSC cycle, starting with PRSC 6 in 2007, will support the implementation of SEDP 2006\u2013\n2010. Support for the Implementation of the Poverty Reduction Program (SIPRP) V will be ADB\u2019s fifth policy-based \nlending operation in Viet Nam and will provide parallel financing with the World Bank\u2019s PRSC 7. PRSC 7 identifies \npolicy  areas  in  SEDP  2006\u20132010  and  other  key  documents  and  strategies  and  classifies  them  into  four  pillars: \n(i) business  development,  (ii)  social  inclusion,  (iii)  natural  resources  management,  and  (iv) governance.  Unlike \nSIPRPs  I\u2013IV,  which  were  all  single-tranche  standard  program  loans,  SIPRP  V  will  take  the  program  cluster \napproach. It will consist of three chronologically ordered subprograms, which will help the Government carry out the \npolicy reforms needed for the successful implementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010 in 2008\u20132010.  \n \nSIPRP  V  will  directly  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  by  supporting  the  implementation  of  policy  actions  that  will \nincrease  social  assistance  to  the  poor  and  the  near-poor.  The  poor  will  directly  benefit  from  the  increase  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s  contribution  to  their  health  insurance  premiums  and  from  participation  in  the  voluntary  pension \nprogram.  The  near-poor  will  directly  benefit  from  government  subsidies  for  their  health  insurance  premiums.  As \nrobust economic growth has been the key driver of poverty reduction in Viet Nam, SIPRP V would indirectly reduce \npoverty by supporting other policy actions that ensure high and sustainable economic growth. These policy reforms \nwill  raise  the  living  standards  of  the  Vietnamese  people  by  fostering  environmentally  sustainable  and  socially \ninclusive economic growth, increase budget revenue by expanding the tax base, and reduce budget expenditure by \nimproving  public  financial  management.  Ethnic  minorities  will  benefit  more  than  the  ethnic  majority  from  these \nactions because the poverty rate is significantly higher among ethnic minorities than among the ethnic majority.  \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                             Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n \nKey Issues  \nSIPRP V supports the implementation of policy reforms in (i) business development, (ii) social inclusion, (iii) natural \nresources management, and (iv) governance. The policy reforms will affect the economy as a whole. The SIPRP V \nactivities do not focus on specific households, on sectors or subsectors that directly support the achievement of the \nMillennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs),  or  on  key  constraints  on  poverty  reduction  in  specific  geographic  areas. \nInstead,  they  will  generally  improve  the  enabling  policy  and  institutional  environment  for  pro-poor  growth,  social \ndevelopment,  and  good  governance,  thereby  indirectly  reducing  poverty.  Therefore,  SIPRP  V  is  classified  as  a \ngeneral intervention.  \n\nThe policy reforms supported by SIPRP V belong to the sector of law, economic management, and public policy, in \nthe  three  key  thematic  areas  of  (i)  sustainable  economic  growth,  (ii)  inclusive  social  development,  and \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n57 \n\n(iii) governance.  SIPRP  V  supports  the  implementation  of  12  specific  policy  actions  in  all  four  pillars  of  PRSC  7. \nGenerally,  the  sector  support  provided  by  SIPRP  V  will  lead  to  poverty  reduction  by  promoting  (i)  business \ndevelopment  and  wider  availability  of  economic  opportunities  for  the  poor  and  near-poor;  (ii)  a  reduction  in  the \nhealth, economic, and environmental vulnerabilities of the poor and other excluded groups; and (iii) an increase in \ngovernment accountability in the use of public resources and the management of SEDP targets. \n \nViet  Nam\u2019s  overall  poverty  rate  has  been  on  a  sustained  downward  trend  in  the  last  two  decades.  The  overall \npoverty rate dropped from 58.1% in 1993 to 28.9% in 2002, and to 16% in 2006. Still, about 13.4 million people live \nin  poverty  in  Viet  Nam,  and  5\u20136  million  experience  food  poverty.  As  the  large  difference  between  $1-a-day  and \n$2-a-day poverty (4% and 33% in 2007, respectively) makes clear, many Vietnamese can be considered near-poor, \nand  thus  particularly  vulnerable  to  falling  into  poverty  in  the  face  of  shocks.  The  disparities  in  poverty  across \nregions, areas, and ethnics remain significant. In 2006, the three poorest regions had poverty rates of 28%\u201331%, \nmuch  higher  than  the  5%\u201311%  in  the  three  least-poor  regions.  The  rural  poverty  rate,  at  20.4%,  is  substantially \nhigher  than  the  urban  poverty  rate  of  3.9%.  Ethnic  minorities,  with  an  average  poverty  rate  of  52.2%,  are \nsignificantly worse off than the majority Kinh, with a poverty rate of 10.3%.  \n \nViet  Nam\u2019s  impressive  economic  growth  has  unfortunately  not  benefited  all  population  groups  equally.  The \nminorities  accounted  for  about  44%  of  the  poor  in  2006  and  will  constitute  more  than  half  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  poor \npopulation by 2010. Ethnic minorities are at a major disadvantage, and their poverty persists. Almost all the ethnic \nminorities  reside  in  remote,  mountainous  rural  areas  and  are  economically  and  socially  disadvantaged  across  a \nrange  of  dimensions.  The  members  of  ethnic  minority  groups  are  more  likely  to  be  malnourished,  illiterate,  and \nsuffering  from  poor  health.  Physical  access  to  social  services  in  challenging  mountainous  terrain  is  a  major \nconstraint.  Poorly  equipped schools,  limited  supply  of  teachers, and teaching methods  that  do  not  respond  to  the \nneeds  of  nonnative  speakers  can  perpetuate  social  exclusion  and  isolation.  Furthermore,  the  urban  poverty  rate, \nafter increasing in 2006, is believed to have been worsened in 2007 and 2008 by increasingly higher prices in the \ncities,  resulting  in  lower  living  standards  for  those  whose  earnings  do  not  grow  accordingly  and  pushing  the \nnear-poor into poverty. \n \nSocial  protection  and  targeted  programs  for  poverty  reduction  are  required  for  inclusive  growth.  Social  protection \nexpands opportunities, enhances equity, and protects against risks and shocks. Social protection in Viet Nam takes \nthe form of social safety nets, labor market programs, and old-age pensions. Social safety net programs account for \n29% of Viet Nam\u2019s total social protection expenditure and cover 64.6% of the poor. In general, programs for specific \nhouseholds are of mixed quality, with some having considerable impact but others less effective. Under the National \nTargeted Program on Job Generation, the Government provides credits for job creation and free vocational training \nfor  the  poor  in  government-run  vocational  training  centers.  The  old-age  pension  includes  a  voluntary  pension \nprogram,  whose  coverage  has  been  expanded  to  include  informal  sector  workers,  and  a  compulsory  program \napplied to all Vietnamese doing contractual work in any enterprise. The minimum pension is equal to the minimum \nwage;  the  maximum  is  75%  of  the  average  salary.  However,  the  attractiveness  of  the  national  voluntary  pension \nprogram for the informal sector is unclear, while only 2% of the compulsory scheme benefits the poorest.  \n \nViet Nam implements a host of targeted programs to reach the most disadvantaged groups and geographic areas. \nThe  National  Targeted  Program  for  Poverty  Reduction  (NTPPR)  provides  assistance  to  poor  households  in  three \nareas:  (i)  development  of  productive  activities  for  the  poor,  mainly  through  preferential  credit,  (ii)  access  to  basic \nservices  (health  care,  education,  housing,  water  supply  and  legal  aid);  and  (iii)  capacity  development  and \nmonitoring.  The  second  phase  of  a  program  for  socioeconomic  development  in  communes  face  with  extreme \nhardship in ethnic minority and mountainous areas (program 135) provides development assistance to poor villages \nin the poorest communes, and to the poorest villages in less-poor communes. Programs 132 and 134 support ethnic \nminorities with agricultural and residential land, housing, and water supply. Although there is no estimate of the total \nnumber of beneficiaries of targeted programs, the figure has reportedly risen. \n \nThe Government is aware of the challenges that face it, and has prepared an explicit section on ethnic support in \nSEDP 2006\u20132010. The Government also has preferential and special programs for the poor and special programs \nfor  ethnic  people  in  these  regions,  e.g.,  the  comprehensive  Hunger  Eradication  and  Poverty  Reduction  Program \n2006\u20132010 and other targeted programs, such as program 135. These programs have generally benefited the poor. \nThe  programs  could  be  made  more  effective  through  further  decentralization,  a  focus  on  capacity  building,  and \nparticipation by the affected people in planning, monitoring, and evaluation. \n \nThe specific policy actions supported by SIPRP V will contribute directly as well as indirectly to poverty reduction in \nViet  Nam.  SIPRP  V  supports the  implementation  of  policies  that  will  reduce  the  health  and  economic  risks  of  the \npoor and the near-poor\u2014the policy of increasing the health insurance premiums for the poor and providing partial \nsubsidies  for  the  near-poor,  and  the  policy  of  introducing  voluntary  pension  programs  for  farmers  and  informal \nsector,  allowing  the  poor  to  participate.  On  the  other  hand,  the  policy  support  in  business  development  and \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\ngovernance will have indirect impact on poverty reduction. Particularly, SIPRP V supports a series of policies that \nwill (i) enhance the efficient use of public resources by state economic groups and general corporations, including \nstate-owned commercial banks and state electricity providers; (ii) introduce more competition into the economy by \nraising  the  cap  on  shareholdings  by  single  foreign  investors;  and  (iii)  stimulate  the  development  of  household \nbusinesses through tax reforms. The policies of monitoring SEDP implementation, regulating the disclosure of state \naudit  reports,  and  extending  \u201cone-stop  shop\u201d  (OSS)  services  to  all  ministries  and  agencies  are  expected  to \nstrengthen government accountability and capacity to manage pro-poor growth. \n \n \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending \n \nThe policy actions supported by SIPRP V will have both direct and indirect impact on some targeted groups and the \neconomy  as  a  whole  over  the  medium  term.  First,  the  operating  efficiency  of  large  state-owned  enterprises  will \nimprove.  Assessing  transactions  among  affiliated  parties  within  economic  groups  and  general  corporations, \napproving  and  completing  the  equitization  plans  of  two  state-owned  commercial  banks,  and  separating  power \ntransmission and generation assets will directly affect these state-owned enterprises and banks. These policies are \nexpected  to  increase  the  efficient  use  of  public  resources  and  improve  the  quality  of  services  provided  by  these \nenterprises. Second, more economic opportunities will be created for the private sector. The policy of raising the cap \non the shareholdings of single foreign investors will directly benefit foreign investors, while the policy of rationalizing \nincentives related to the enterprise income tax and simplifying tax procedures for household businesses will directly \nlead  to  an  expansion  in  the  economic  activities  of  domestic  private  enterprises  and  production  units.  Third,  more \nsupporting  administrative  procedures  will  be  instituted  for  enterprises  as  well  as  people.  The  policy  of  extending \nOSS  services  and  introducing  interlinked  OSS  services  will  further  simplify  administrative  procedures.  These \npolicies will benefit a wide range of groups. Fourth, the regulation specifying the content and timing of disclosure of \nState  Audit  of  Viet  Nam  reports  will  increase  government  accountability  for  the  use  of  public  resources.  Fifth, \ngovernment capacity to monitor the SEDP 2006\u20132010 targets, including the poverty targets, will be strengthened. \nFinally, the provision of subsidized health insurance and the introduction of voluntary pension programs will reduce \nthe health and economic risks of the poor and the near-poor. \n \nAll the policy actions under SIPRP V will have no adverse impact on vulnerable groups, particularly the poor and the \nnear-poor.  on  the  other  hand,  these  policy  actions  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  the  poor  and  the  near-poor  by \n(i) promoting the development of the private sector, especially household businesses, and thus increasing demand \nfor unskilled labor; (ii) making net public transfers to the poor and near-poor through subsidies for health insurance \npremiums;  and  (iii)  facilitating  access  to  public  goods  and  services  through  more  efficient  state  economic  groups \nand general operations, which provide public utilities, especially electricity.   \n \nThe  policy  actions  under  SIPRP  V  will  have  an  indirect  rather  than  a  direct  impact  on  the  MDGs.  These  policy \nactions  are  not  directly  linked  to  the  MDG  targets.  However,  their  implementation  will  lay  the  foundation  for \nachieving  these  targets.  The  policy  actions  under  SIPRP  V  will  address  the  major  structural  weaknesses  of  Viet \nNam\u2019s economy, and therefore make economic growth more sustainable and improve living standards in general.  \n \n\nII. SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\n \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \n \nThere may still be around 13.5 million people living in poverty in Viet Nam, with between five and six million being \nfood-poor. People in the rural or mountainous areas are more likely to be poor than those living in urban or lowland \nareas. Overall, the ethnic minorities are still much poorer than the Kinh and Chinese majority. The main constraints \non the ability of the ethnic minorities to lift themselves out of the poverty are poor infrastructure, lack of access to \nsocial  services,  low  educational  attainment,  and  limited  land  for  agriculture  production.  Furthermore,  domestic \nmigrants outside the agriculture sector are very vulnerable to economic shocks.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n59 \n\n  \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n \n1.  Summary of the consultation and participation (C&P) process during the program preparation \n \nSEDP  2006\u20132010  makes  stronger  references  to  participatory  and  inclusive  approaches  than  previous  plans.  It \nexpands the participation and heightens the role of nongovernment organizations and intensifies the participation of \npeople,  communities,  and  civil  society  in  planning,  implementation,  and  monitoring,  from  central  to  local  levels. \nViet Nam\u2019s development partners have aligned their efforts behind SEDP 2006\u20132010, expressing satisfaction with \nits  preparation  process  and  acknowledging  it  as  a  credible  strategy  for  fostering  economic  growth  and  poverty \nreduction.  The  SEDP  is  a  comprehensive  document  dealing  with  almost  every  aspect  of  economic  reform.  As  it \nstrongly  focuses  on  social  inclusion  and  poverty  reduction,  the  SEDP  is  considered  a  tool  of  upstream \nharmonization, giving government and the international community a shared view of what needs to be done.  \n\n \n\nThe  PRSCs  identify  policy  actions  within  the  SEDP  framework.  They  constitute  a  platform  for  continued  policy \ndialogue on a broad range of issues with government counterparts and were jointly drawn up by many development \npartners  through  regular meetings  held  to  reach consensus  on  how  to  proceed, discuss ideas  and  plans  with  the \nGovernment,  and  assess  progress  on  economic  reform.  The  new  PRSC  cycle  was  prepared  on  the  basis  of  the \nViet Nam Development Report 2007, Aiming High, which translated the SEDP into a workable set of policy actions, \nwith proper prioritization and sequencing. The new cycle also takes into account the concerns brought up during the \nmidyear consultative group meeting and the Viet Nam Business Forum. In 2007, a series of consultations on PRSC \noperations  took  place  with  government  officials,  elected  representatives,  civil  society,  and  the  private  sector. \nPRSC 7 grew out of the existing donor commitments to support Viet Nam\u2019s reform agenda. Fourteen policy areas \nwere  chosen  and  these  were  discussed  over  several  rounds  of  technical  meetings  with  20  line  ministries  and \ngovernment agencies. \n \n2.  What level of C&P is envisaged during the program implementation and monitoring? \n \n\u2327 Information sharing     \u2327 Consultation    (cid:2) Collaborative decision making      (cid:2) Empowerment \n \n3. Was a C&P plan prepared?  (cid:2) Yes \u2327 No \n \nThe  policy  actions  of  SIPRP  V  are  based  on  PRSC  7,  which  is  being  jointly  undertaken  by  the  participating \ndevelopment agencies. As ADB has joined the PRSC process, no further C&P plan is needed. \n \n \nC.  Gender Development \n \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nOver  the  last  20  years,  Viet  Nam  has  made  remarkable  progress  in  reducing  gender  disparities.  Ranked  80th \namong 136 countries on the gender development index, it is one of the Southeast Asian countries that have made \nthe most rapid progress in closing the gender gaps. There are few differences between boys and girls in nutrition \nand  school  enrollment.  The  country  has  virtually  achieved  universal  primary  education,  is  on  the  way  to  attaining \nuniversal lower secondary education, has achieved high adult literacy rates for men and women, and has exceeded \nthe target of 30% of postgraduate qualifications going to women. With 83% of women between the ages of 15 and \n60  participating  in  the  labor  force,  its  participation  rates  for  women  in  economic  activities  are  the  highest  in  the \nworld.  The  number  of  women  engaged  in  wage  employment  has  increased,  and  now  accounts  for  26%  of  the \nfemale labor force. Similarly, the gender gap in wages and incomes has declined significantly. Viet Nam also has \nthe highest percentage of women in national parliament in Asia and the Pacific, at around 27% since 2002.  \n\nDespite  the  country\u2019s  impressive  achievements  in  narrowing  gender  gaps,  however,  women  remain  at  a \ndisadvantage compared with men. First, ethnic minority women and girls lag behind ethnic minority men and Kinh \nand Chinese women in access to health, health insurance, education services, and economic opportunities; around \none-fifth of ethnic minority young women have never attended school, ethnic minority girls of school age are more \nlikely than their male counterparts to be working, and 87% of ethnic minority women in rural areas are self-employed \nin  agriculture  and  least  likely  to  be  in  wage  employment.  Second,  women  are  overrepresented  in  agriculture \nself-employment  because  of  poor  access  to  skills  training,  which  limits  their  ability  to  apply  for  some  jobs.  Third, \nmen  benefit  more  from  jobs  with  decision-making  power  and  that  offer  higher  pay  and  professional  prospects. \nFourth, while the wage gap has narrowed, men still earn more than women. Fifth, men and women contribute equal \ntime to income generation but not to housework. As a result, women work an average of 13 hours a day, compared \nwith only 9 hours for men. Sixth, men\u2019s opportunities to capitalize assets are greater than women\u2019s. Women are less \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nlikely  to  have  security  of  land  tenure,  which  would  not  only  give  them  better  access  to  capital,  but  would  also \nincrease  their  security  in  case  of  divorce  or  inheritance.  Lastly,  very  few  women  are  represented  in  leadership \npositions at the central level. Women are almost invisible in leadership positions across most departments and all \nsectors at the local level. \n \n2.  Key Actions \n \nViet Nam has developed a strong legal, policy, and institutional environment to empower women and reduce gender \ngaps. Its Constitution provides for gender equality and SEDP 2006\u20132010 integrates gender equality considerations \nin  agriculture,  employment,  environmental  management,  health,  and  education.  Viet  Nam  was  one  of  the  first \ncountries  to sign and  ratify  the  Convention  on  the  Elimination  of  All  Forms  of  Discrimination  against Women.  The \nnew Law on Gender Equality decrees equal rights for women in many areas such as the political arena, economic \nopportunity, labor, employment, education and training, science and technology, health care, culture information and \nsports, and family. This law represents a unified legal framework for addressing gender disparities and increasing \nwomen\u2019s participation in decision making. The Land Law requires the inclusion of the names of both husband and \nwife in all new land use right certificates. The National Strategy for the Advancement of Women to 2010 identifies \npriorities  related  to  gender  equality.  The  National  Committee  for  the  Advancement  of  Women  is  a  high-level \nmultisectoral  committee  responsible  for  promoting  gender  equality.  The  Viet  Nam  Women\u2019s  Union  is  a  mass \norganization for women that facilitates the implementation of projects and programs at the local level, in addition to \nrepresenting its members in national policy dialogue. \n \nPRSC  7  directly  supports  women  by  defining  institutional  responsibilities  for  the  implementation  of  the  Gender \nEquality Law and the monitoring of gender equality. Although SIPRP V does not include policy actions in the gender \narea, its two policy actions related to health insurance premiums and participation in the voluntary pension program \ndirectly address the health care and economic disadvantages of women, especially among the ethnic minorities. \n \n(cid:2) Gender plan            (cid:2) Other actions/measures              \u2327 No action/measure \n \n\nIII.

Neither PRSC 7 nor \nSIPRP V covers policy areas that directly \nrelate to resettlement.  \n \nHowever, under previous PRSCs, a \nregulation was issued by the Government to \naddress resettlement. Decision 33 provides \npolicy support for the resettlement of ethnic \nminorities in 2007\u20132010. These policies \ninclude community support (infrastructure \ninvestment, cash subsidies for land \ncompensation, staff) as well as support for \nindividual households (land assignment, \ncash subsidies).  \n \nIn 2006, ADB and the Committee for Ethnic \nMinorities completed a joint situational \nanalysis of resettlement policies in the \nnorthern mountainous areas. This study was \nused in the preparation of PRSCs 6\u20137. \n \nThe redesigned program for socioeconomic \ndevelopment in communes faced with \nextreme hardship in ethnic minority and \nmountainous areas (2006\u20132010), known as \nprogram 135\u2013phase 2, supports \n\nPlan or Other Measures \nIncluded in Design \n\n \n(cid:3) Full \n(cid:2) Short \n(cid:2) Resettlement framework \n\u2327 None \n \n\n \n(cid:2) Plan \n(cid:2) Other action \n(cid:2) Indigenous peoples \nframework \n\u2327 No action \n\n \nIndigenous \nPeoples \n \n\n \nNo Impact  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n61 \n\n \n \n\nsocioeconomic development in about 1,644 \nof the country\u2019s poorest communes and \n2,500 of its poorest villages, through a \ncombination of rural infrastructure, \nproduction and livelihood enhancement, and \ninstitutional capacity-building services.  \n \nPRSC 7 covers two policy areas with direct \nimpact on ethnic minority poverty. First, \ntuition fees at the secondary and tertiary \nlevels will be reviewed and made to better \nreflect market conditions, and policies will be \nstrengthened to protect the poor. The \nmeasures to be carried out in this regard \ninclude the application of (i) the lowest fee \nlevel in remote areas, where most of the \nethnic minorities live; (ii) scholarship grants \nof up to 80% of the minimum wage, for \nstudents from poor and ethnic households; \nand (iii) concessional credit for students. \nThe ethnic minorities will directly benefit \nfrom increased financial assistance for \nsecondary and tertiary education. Second, \nthe health insurance premium paid on behalf \nof the poor will be increased and a partial \nsubsidy will be extended to the near-poor. \nEthnic minorities will benefit somewhat more \nthan the rest of the population because the \nproportion of the poor and near-poor is \ngenerally higher among ethnic minorities \nthan among the ethnic majority. Health \ninsurance premiums for the poor increased \nin 2008. Near-poor households receive 50% \nhealth insurance subsidy from the \nGovernment.  \n \nSIPRP V covers assistance for health \ninsurance but not education fees. Therefore, \nit has a direct impact on the ethnic minorities \nonly through subsidized health insurance. \nSIPRP V has an indirect effect on the \nreduction of poverty among ethnic minorities \nby supporting other policy reforms.  \n \nPRSC  7  and  SIPRP  V  support  policy  areas \nthat will promote business development and \ngenerate new job opportunities.  \n \n\n \nDecision 134 issued by the Government \ndefined a set of policies for assisting ethnic \nminority poor households in the form of \nproduction land, housing, and water. So far, \nmore than D2.0 trillion has been spent on \nthese three forms of assistance.  \nFurthermore, the Government approved a \nsecond phase of the Hunger Eradication and \nPoverty Reduction Program and program \n135 through 2010.

Given the unchanged incomes and \nthe rapid increase in the prices of foods and \nfoodstuffs, the real purchasing power of \nmany households, especially the poor \nhouseholds, has been significantly reduced.  \n \nThe Government has implemented a policy \npackage, including tighter monetary and \nfiscal policies, to stabilize the economy. The \nsituation improved in June and July but is \nstill fragile. In addition to short-term factors, \nstructural factors also contribute to the \ndeterioration of macroeconomic \nenvironment.  \n \nPRSC 7 and SIPRP V, supporting the \nmedium- and long-term policies of the \nSEDP, will have a positive impact on the \nstabilization of the economy and social \nprotection.  \n\nIV.

This lack of clarity \ncompromised the efficiency and effectiveness of river \nbasin management activities. \n\nDecrees 01/2008/ND-CP of 3 January 2008 and \n25/2008/ND-CP of 4 March 2008 transferred the \nresponsibilities for river basin management from \nMARD to MONRE.  \n\nThe allocation of clear institutional responsibilities \nwithin MONRE will be a critical component of the \neffective development and implementation of future \nactivities. Adequate resources and capacity are \nrequired within MONRE to ensure that the outcomes \nof such activities are optimized. \n\nGovernance \n\n9.

This framework includes \nobjectives, targets, and indicators for the monitoring \nof environmental issues structured around the \nfollowing broad themes: sustainable use of land, \nforests, and water; reduction of pollution and \nenvironmental degradation; and sustainable \ndevelopment.  \nThe monitoring system for environmental issues is \ndetailed and comprehensive for some themes (such \nas forestry) but overly general and lacking in ease of \nmeasurability for others (such as reduction of \nenvironmental pollution). \n\nOverall, however, the inclusion of such issues in the \nSEDP monitoring framework represents an important \nstep in the recognition of the relationship between the \nenvironmental, social, and economic aspects of \nnational development.  \n\nThe improvement of the monitoring and reporting \nsystem for SEDP implementation could result in \nminor positive environmental benefits.
