I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed equity \ninvestment of up to $25,000,000 in Indian rupee equivalent in Avaada Energy Private Limited \n(AEPL)  for  the  Avaada  Solar  Project  in  India.  The  report  also  describes  the  proposed \nadministration of an equity investment of up to $25,000,000 in Indian rupee equivalent to be \nprovided by Leading Asia's Private Infrastructure Fund (LEAP)1, and if the Board approves the \nproposed equity investment, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve \nthe administration of the equity investment by LEAP. \n \n2.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  invest  in  AEPL  along  with  two  European \ndevelopment finance institutions, which will invest up to $25 million each, on the same terms and \nconditions. The proposed investment will enable AEPL to expand its solar photovoltaic (PV) \noperating and under construction generation capacity from 593 megawatts (MW) as of December \n2018 to 1,991 MW operating capacity by March 2023. The project will help the Government of \nIndia to meet the targets for non-fossil-fuel-based electric power generation and reduce India\u2019s \nemission intensity. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n3.  Project identification. AEPL, sponsored by Vineet Mittal through his investment vehicle \nAvaada  Power  Private  Limited  (APPL,  or  the  Sponsor),  is  one  of  India\u2019s  fastest-growing \nindependent power producers (IPPs) in solar power generation. ADB has prior experience of \nworking with Vineet Mittal. It invested $39 million in June 2014 and $11 million in March 2016 in \nWelspun Renewables Energy Private Limited (WREPL), a company controlled by Welspun \nEnergy Limited (WEL), which was co-sponsored by Vineet Mittal and B. K. Goenka. WREPL grew \nto be India\u2019s largest solar power company, with 1,140 MW of capacity, within 2 years of ADB \ninvestment. In 2016, the two partners decided to part ways and sold WREPL to Tata Power. ADB \nsuccessfully exited the investment with satisfactory returns. The proceeds realized by WEL were \ndivided between the two partners by demerging WEL. The demerger resulted in the formation of \nAEPL, with Vineet Mittal getting its full ownership. Mittal\u2019s vision for AEPL is to make it one of the \nleading solar companies in India by leveraging his strong industry experience. \n \n4.  AEPL has secured power purchase agreements (PPAs) for 1,199 MW of solar PV \nprojects: 335 MW operating, 258 MW under construction, and 606 MW under development, as of \nDecember 2018. It has approached ADB for an aggregate equity investment of $50.0 million to \nmeet the equity requirements as per its business plan.  \n \n5.  The project provides ADB with an opportunity to further its commitment to scale up clean \nenergy financing.2 ADB\u2019s initiative will actively support the Government of India\u2019s target to achieve \n175 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy generation capacity by 2022, of which 100 GW shall be \nfrom solar power. As of December 2018, operational solar generation capacity in India was about \n27.6 GW. The government expects the private sector to lead the capacity addition. The unique \nreverse auction structure, favorable movements in solar panel prices, creation of credible offtake \nintermediaries such as the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) and enabling of infrastructure \nin the form of solar parks has resulted in solar power tariffs coming down rapidly to the current \n                                                \n1  Financing Partner: Japan International Cooperation Agency. \n2  ADB. 2009.

In \naddition to PPAs with government agencies, there is approximately 5 GW of near-term potential \nfor direct power sales to industrial customers under the open access policy of state governments, \nwhich is more profitable. AEPL is looking to build a portfolio of open-access and auction-based \nprojects to balance risks and returns. \n \n6.  Project design. AEPL has secured 1,199 MW of solar PV generation PPAs. Of the 593 \nMW operational or under construction projects, PPAs for 443 MW are for terms of 25 years. \nBalance 150 MW PPAs are with industrial customers with strong credit ratings in the state of \nKarnataka and are of varying tenors (5\u201325 years), with options to renew on mutually agreeable \nterms. All projects with long-term PPAs have been acquired based on a competitive bidding \nprocess with the lowest power tariff being the key winning criteria. For new project bids after ADB \ninvestment, rigorous project selection criteria have been agreed upon between investors and \nAEPL. \n  \n7.  Through  Vineet  Mittal\u2019s  earlier  leadership  of  WEL,  which  was  the  sole  in-house \nengineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) provider to WREPL, he has built strong \nexecution capabilities. This provides AEPL with a unique edge in bidding, as it undertakes all EPC \nwork related to its underlying projects, allowing it to control project costs and timelines and retain \nthe EPC margin. AEPL is the sole entity through which the Sponsor will own and operate all \nrenewable energy projects undertaken by it. \n \n8.  Investee and sponsor. AEPL (project details as provided in Table 1) is owned entirely by \nAPPL, which in turn, is owned by Vineet Mittal and his spouse, Sindoor Mittal. Vineet Mittal has \nan established track record of implementing 1,140 MW of renewable energy projects capacity in \nfour years at WREPL. Prior to establishing WREPL, Vineet Mittal established an outsourcing \ncompany in India, Infowavz (now called Stream, a business process outsourcing firm). He is the \nchairman of the Solar Energy Task Force and a Co-Chair of the Renewable Energy Committee \nat The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHAM). He was twice \nrecognized as the \u2018Solar Man of the Year\u2019 in 2012 and 2014. \n \n9.  (Confidential information redacted).  \n \n10.  As part of the demerger process, the team from WEL, comprising about 167 professionals, \nhas moved to AEPL and at APPL. Vineet Mittal spearheads overall strategy including project \nselection, procurement, and liaison with government agencies. Sindoor Mittal is responsible for \nleadership development and capital raising. Kishor Nair, who has more than 30 years of business \nexperience, leads project execution and implementation. Sudhir Sehgal, who has more than 35 \nyears of industry experience, leads project development, design, and engineering. The finance \nteam has strong relationships with large domestic financial institutions, having raised more than \n$1 billion of project financing. A separate team for land acquisition, with extensive experience in \npurchasing and leasing land, has already identified a land bank for significant expansion through \nfuture projects.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "3 \nTable 1: Avaada Energy Private Limited\u2019s Existing Projects \nBid Tariff  Tenor  Capacity \nLocation  State  PPA  (\u20b9/kWh)  (Years)  (MW)  COD \nOperational      335    \nChalisgaon  Maharashtra  SECI  4.43  25  80   Jun 2018 \nBanavikal, Ilkal (OA)  Karnataka  Corporate  4.46  10\u221225  90   Mar 2018 \nHanegal (OA)  Karnataka  Corporate  4.79  5\u221225  30   Mar 2018 \nKanahosahalli (OA)  Karnataka  Corporate  4.30  25  30   Mar 2018 \nBhadla  Rajasthan  SECI  2.62  25  100   Oct 2018 \nKanpur  Uttar Pradesh  Central  4.18  25  5   Oct 2018 \nConstruction      258   \nPavagada  Karnataka  State  2.92  25  150   Mar 2019 \nIREL  Orissa  Central  3.90  25  5   Sep 2019 \nHAL  Telangana  Central  3.12  25  3   Sep 2019 \nSatara  Maharashtra  SECI  4.43  25  100   Sep 2019 \nDevelopment          606   \nGujarat  Gujarat  State  2.44  25  300   Sep 2020 \nPavagada 2  Karnataka  State  2.92  25  150   Mar 2020 \nBadaun  Uttar Pradesh  State  3.23  25  50   Sep 2020 \nTBD  Uttar Pradesh  State  3.07  25  100   Nov 2020 \nDistributed  Multiplea  State  3.23  25  6   May 2019 \nTotal         1,199     \nCOD = commercial operations date, HAL = Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, IREL = Indian Rare Earths Limited,       \nkWh = kilowatt-hour, MW = megawatt, OA = open access, PPA = power purchase agreement, SECI = Solar Energy \nCorporation of India, TBD = To be decided. \na  States of Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. \nSources: Avaada Energy Private Limited and Asian Development Bank. \n \n11.

Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n16.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is fully aligned with \nADB's Energy Policy, which prioritizes support for renewable energy development (footnote 2). \nThe project is consistent with ADB's Strategy 2030.6 It contributes to ADB\u2019s goal to provide climate \nfinance  of  $80  billion  cumulatively  from  2019  to  2030.  It  relates  to  two  of  the  five  core \nspecializations of ADB: infrastructure, and environment. The project will also contribute to ADB\u2019s \noperational goal of scaling up private sector development and private sector operations. The \nproject is aligned with the country partnership strategy, 2018\u20132022 for India, which calls for higher \nefficiency and carbon mitigation through power generation from renewable sources.7  \n \n17.  Lessons from previous operations. The extended annual reviews of wind and solar \nprojects previously financed by ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department in India highlighted \nthree key lessons: (i) the importance of resource assessment, (ii) the risks associated with land \nacquisition,  and  (iii)  the  need  for  adequate  power  evacuation  facilities.  These  have  been \nincorporated as part of implementation arrangement of the project and will be closely monitored \nby ADB as a key shareholder. \n \nD.  Project Cost and Financing Plan \n \n18.

The investment is a general corporate finance transaction under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009) (SPS). ADB has categorized the investment in compliance with its SPS as \nfollows: environment (category B), involuntary resettlement (category B), and indigenous peoples \n(category B).8 This categorization is based on the potential environmental and social impacts of \nthe AEPL\u2019s existing and future projects. AEPL will use ADB\u2019s equity investment for developing \nrenewable power projects, primarily solar PV plants. ADB has undertaken due diligence and \nreviewed the potential environmental and social impacts of the project and the measures to avoid, \nminimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse impacts in the safeguard reports and plans. \nThe environmental and social measures and the institutional capacity and commitment of AEPL \nto manage the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts are deemed adequate. \n \n34.  An external third party conducted a corporate audit in accordance with ADB\u2019s SPS \nrequirements.9 The  corporate  audit  assessed  that  the  operations  of  the  company  were  in \ncompliance with the statutory requirements. The current environmental and social systems, \nprocesses, and practices of the company were also commensurate with the risks and impacts \nassociated with its business and operation. The corporate audit findings indicated that AEPL\u2019s \nESMS is broadly aligned with ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements. However, some of the processes \nand  procedures  (like  early  stage  screening  of  risks,  construction  phase  labor,  and  safety \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2009.

The  audit  also  indicated  that \nenvironmental and social resources and capacity at the corporate and project level must be \nstrengthened and regular training on ESMSs and environmental and social issues should be \nperformed to ensure adequate implementation.10 \n \n35.  A corrective action plan has been developed incorporating these and other audit findings \nand recommendations based on which AEPL will strengthen and update its existing ESMS to \ncomply with ADB requirements. AEPL will also strengthen its environmental and social team \nresources and capacity and provide regular ESMS and environmental and social training at the \ncorporate and project level. AEPL will also report on an annual basis to ADB on ongoing \ncompliance with ESMS and ADB\u2019s SPS requirements. \n \n36.  AEPL will comply with the national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection \nStrategy  (2001),  take  measures  to  comply  with  the  internationally  recognized  core  labor \nstandards. AEPL will report on an annual basis to ADB on (i) its compliance with such laws, and \n(ii) the measures taken. ADB will seek information and conduct consultation with affected people \nin accordance with ADB requirements.11 \n \n37.  AEPL is committed to implement measures to promote gender equality and women\u2019s \nempowerment in its business activities following ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development. 12 \nTherefore, the project is classified as \u201cSome Gender Elements\u201d. AEPL has agreed to undertake \nthe following key measures: (i) increase employment of women in the company (from the current \nbaseline of 12% to 24%), (ii) support skills development of women, (iii) support education of girls, \nand (iv) provide sanitation facilities for women. The project team supported AEPL in development \nof a gender action plan. AEPL will submit periodic reports on the implementation of gender \nmeasures to ADB. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n38.  AEPL was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that the \ninvestment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.
