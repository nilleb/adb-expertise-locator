Since the end of the \narmed  conflict,  substantial  progress  has  been  made  in  addressing  challenges  and  security \nconcerns.  At  the  end  of  the  war  in  2009,  32  welfare  centers  in  the  north  had  about  327,000 \ninternally displaced persons. As of October 2010, less than 23,000 remained, and the majority \nof those are expected to return to their original residences by the end of the year, with the rest \nreturning early next year following completion of demining in their home regions. Development \npartners  remain  engaged  with  the  government,  and  are  placing  increased  emphasis  on  early \nrecovery  and  rehabilitating  and  reconstructing  basic  infrastructure.  Security  and  access  has \nimproved substantially, and demining is expected to be completed by the end of 2010 or early \n2011. \n \n4. \nDecades  of  internal  conflict  resulted  in  Jaffna  Peninsula  lagging  behind  the  rest  of  the \ncountry  economically,  as  many  facilities  for  fish  processing  and  other  key  industries  were \ndestroyed.  Investment  levels  have  remained  extremely  low,  little  maintenance  has  been \nundertaken on surviving infrastructure, and key industries, such as agriculture and fishing, have \nbeen abandoned. Poverty is the most pressing issue in Jaffna. The incidence of poverty in the \nNorthern  Province  is  estimated  to  be  37%,  compared  with  15%  for  the  country  as  a  whole.3 \nPoverty  in  the  Northern  Province  is  multidimensional  and  distinct  from  the  rest  of  the  country. \nBoth  income  poverty  levels  and  non-income  poverty  levels  remain  high,  and  vulnerabilities \nresulting  from  the  past  conflict  persist.  Providing  basic  needs  will  mitigate  against  these \nvulnerabilities  and  result  in  improved  health  and  human  capital.  Provision  of  basic  needs  will \ncomplement government efforts to promote sustainable livelihoods, improve access to markets, \nand increase employment in the Northern Province. \n \nProvision  of  water\u2014the  most  basic  of  needs\u2014and  sanitation  require  careful \n5. \nconsideration  because  of  the  distinct  characteristics  of  Jaffna.  Because  of  Jaffna's  unique \ntopography  and  morphology,  the  peninsula  depends  primarily  on  groundwater  resources  not \nonly  for  drinking  water  but  also  for  many  other  purposes,  including  agriculture,  the  primary \n                                                 \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   A  comprehensive  study  of  water  resources  in  Jaffna  Peninsula  and  a  feasibility  study  were  conducted  under \n\ncomponent D of the ADB-supported Conflict Affected Areas Rehabilitation Project (approved in 2003). \n\n3  Government  of  Sri  Lanka.  2009.  Wadakkil  Wasantham:  Three  Year  Development  Strategy  for  the  Northern \n\nProvince. Colombo. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\neconomic  activity.  The  aquifer  is  fragile  and  at  risk  because  of  bacteriological  contamination \nresulting  from  inadequate  sanitation  and  nutrient  contamination  resulting  from  agricultural  run-\noff. Over-extraction of groundwater has also led to salinity intrusion. Addressing threats to water \nresources  in  Jaffna  requires  an  integrated,  cross-sectoral,  and  multidisciplinary  institutional \nframework.  Currently  no  regulatory  mechanism  for  water  resources  exists  to  coordinate,  plan, \nand oversee monitoring activities. \n \n6. \nKey  development  problems  affecting  water  and  sanitation  in  Jaffna  are  related  to  (i) \ndamaged  sanitation  facilities  and  a  lack  of  access  to  water; 4  (ii)  weak  water  resource \ncoordination  and  planning  and  a  lack  of  essential  policies  for  managing  water  resources;  and \n(iii) poor institutional capacity of water and sanitation authorities and inadequate awareness on \nwater conservation, environmental protection, and hygiene among beneficiaries. \n  \n7. \nThe  government  recognizes  the  project  as  a  key  priority  and  a  key  part  of  the \nrehabilitation  and  reconstruction  program  for  the  Northern  Province.  The  project  is  consistent \nwith  the  government's  10-year  development  framework,5 which  (i)  targets  increased  access  to \nwater supply and sanitation, (ii) encourages the use of alternative water sources to protect and \nconserve  water  resources,  (iii)  identifies  Jaffna  as  a  national  growth  center,  (iv)  promotes \nlocalized measurement and achievement of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals \nin  recognition  of  regional  variations,  and  (v)  works  to  rehabilitate  and  reestablish  residents' \naccess  to  basic  infrastructure  in  post-conflict  areas.  It  is  also  consistent  with  (i)  the  country \npartnership and strategy of the Asian Development Bank (ADB),6 which aims to achieve socially \ninclusive development by expanding access to high-quality water supply and other  services in \nlagging  regions,  and  to  assist  poor  households  in  establishing  links  to  water  supply  systems; \nand  (ii)  the  country  operations  business  plan  of  ADB, 7 which  identifies  drinking  water  and \nsanitation systems as areas of ADB intervention. The project was prepared in consultation with \ndevelopment partners, and will be cofinanced by Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD). \n \nLessons  learned  from  previous  projects  and  evaluation8 in  Sri  Lanka  have  highlighted \n8. \nthe need to (i) incorporate greater consultation and participatory processes into project design \nand  implementation,  (ii)  establish  effective  regulatory  entities  and  take  other  measures  to \nprevent  conflicts  between  water  users,  (iii)  ensure  proper  project  cost  estimates,  (iv)  revise \nwater  tariffs  to  be  more  sustainable,  (v)  introduce  sewerage  tariffs,  and  (vi)  provide  capacity \nbuilding to staff of agencies involved in water and sanitation. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n9. \nThe  impact  of  the  project  will  be  improved  health  and  human  development  in  urban \nareas  of  Jaffna  Peninsula.  The  project  will  contribute  to  rehabilitating,  reconstructing,  and \ndeveloping  areas  affected  by  conflict.  The  outcomes  of  the  project  will  be  (i)  improved  water \nsupply  and  sanitation  infrastructure  for  residents  and  returning  internally  displaced  persons  in \ntargeted urban areas, and (ii) improved protection and management of Jaffna Peninsula's water \nresources.  The  project  area  covers  the  Jaffna  Peninsula  and  Poneryn  Pradeshiya  Sabha  in \nKilinochchi District. The project comprises stage 1 of phase 1 of the government\u2019s three-phase \nplan to provide water for the entire Jaffna Peninsula.9 \n \n\n                                                 \n4   Less than 0.5% of residents in Jaffna Peninsula have access to piped water, compared with a country average of \n\nmore than 32%. \n\n5   Government of Sri Lanka. 2006.

Water  supply.  This  comprises  (i)  rehabilitating  and  improving  headworks  at  the \nIranamadu  Tank10 to  increase  water  resources  and  tank  efficiency  levels;  (ii)  constructing  a \nwater  intake, 11  a  raw-water  supply  system,  a  water  treatment  plant,  and  a  treated  water \npumping  station;  (iii)  laying  treated-water  transmission  mains12 to  the  Jaffna  Municipality;  and \n(iv) providing water connections to an urban council and Pradeshiya Sabhas en route to Jaffna \nMunicipality13 involving 12 off-takes.14 From the treated water transmission main, the project will \n(i)  build  new  water  distribution  systems  for  Jaffna  Municipality  and  the  Chavakachcheri  Urban \nCouncil  that  will  provide  poor  areas  with  access  to  household  connections  and  metered \ncommunity  water  facilities;15 (ii)  build  new  water  distribution  systems  for  selected  Pradeshiya \nSabhas of the Jaffna and Kilinochchi districts, including pipe extensions to property boundaries \nfor  ease  in  providing  household  and  community  connections;16 (iii)  install  bulk/system  water \nmeters;  (iv)  institute  a  leak  detection  program  for  the  existing  distribution  network;  and  (v) \nprovide spare parts and maintenance equipment.17 \n \nSewerage and sanitation. This comprises (i) building a sewage collection system,18 (ii) \n12. \nbuilding  a  sewage  treatment  plant,  (iii)  building  an  effluent  sea  outfall,  and  (iv)  providing \nmaintenance  equipment.  The  project  will  also  provide  low-cost  sanitation  systems  for  poor \ncommunities in the form of household or communal latrines.19 Given the fragility of the aquifer, \nall latrines built under this component will be connected to a septic tank, unless they are within \nthe area of Jaffna Municipality served by the sewerage system. A connection to the sewerage \nsystem will be compulsory in this area. Septic tank cleaning machines will also be provided. \n \n\n2. \n\nStrengthening Jaffna Water Resource Management \n\n13. \nThis  component  will  (i)  assist  the  Jaffna  Water  Resources  Management  Committee  in \ndesigning  a  policy  and  institutional  framework  for  integrated  water  resources  management  by \nfinancing  a  study  to  develop  a  water  resources  management  plan;20 (ii)  support  the  National \n\n                                                 \n10  Includes raising and strengthening the embankment; repairing sluices, radial gates, spillway, and lift irrigation; and \n\nautomation.  \n\n11  To abstract 27,000 cubic meters per day. \n12 Treated water transmission mains are estimated to be 44 km long. \n13  These  may  include  the  following  Pradeshiya  Sabhas  and  Urban  Council:  Pallai  (Pachcilaipallai)  and  Pooneryn  in \nKilinochchi  District;  Kodikamam,  Chavakachcheri,  Kopay,  Nallur,  Valigamam  South,  Valigamam  West,  Kayts, \nVelanai, Pungudutivu Islands, and Karainagar. \n\n14 The government has requested AFD to fund item (ii) and part of item (iii) as well as associated consulting services \n\nfor design and supervision. \n\n15 The project will support progressive phasing out of stand posts and their conversion into metered community water \nfacilities.  Communities  supplied  with  water  through  communal  metered  facilities  will  form  community-based \norganizations (CBOs) that will register and sign agreements with the National Water Supply and Drainage Board.  \nThe CBOs will nominate representatives to coordinate and collect payments. \n\n16 There  will  be  about  300,000  beneficiaries  of  the  water  system  comprising  an  estimated  two-thirds  of  residents  in \n\nthe coverage area. \n\npersons. \n\n17 The water supply component supports stage one of the first phase of the government\u2019s multiphased approach for \n\nsupplying water to the whole Jaffna Peninsula. \n\n18  The  sewerage  system  will  cover  the  most  densely  populated  areas  of  Jaffna  Municipality,  benefiting  80,000 \n\n19  These will be in areas within the project's water supply service area not covered by the project's sewerage network. \nWork in this area will be coordinated with sanitation projects of the government and other development partners. \n20 The  Jaffna  water  resources  management  committee  will  expand  on  the  Jaffna  Water  and  Sanitation  Sectoral \nCommittee  chaired  by  the  government  agent.  Members  will  include  the  NWSDB  (secretariat);  divisional \nsecretaries;  secretaries  of  municipal  and  urban  councils  and  Pradeshiya  Sabhas;  nongovernment  organizations; \nand the regional director for health services. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fWater  Supply  and  Drainage  Board  (NWSDB),  the  Water  Resources  Board,  and  other \ninstitutions  in  developing  a  groundwater  quality  and  quantity  monitoring  system;  (iii)  support \nmunicipalities,  urban  councils,  and  Pradeshiya  Sabhas \nin  monitoring  and  managing \ngroundwater resources by helping them design effective by-laws, rules, and regulations; and (iv) \nconduct  public  water  conservation,  environmental  protection,  and  hygiene  awareness \ncampaigns, and a program for community monitoring. \n \n\n3. \n\nBuilding Capacity of the NWSDB to Carry  Out Project Implementation and \nBuild Regional Office in Jaffna  \n\n14. \nThis  component  will  (i) support  the NWSDB  to  build  a  regional  office  in  Jaffna,  and  (ii) \nprovide  capacity  and  administration  support  for  the  Jaffna  Regional  Office  (JRO)  to  carry  out \nproject implementation. \n \nD. \n \n15. \nTable 1, and the financing plan is in Table 2. \n \n\nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $164  million.

The government has provided ADB with (a) the reasons for its decision to borrow \nunder ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (b) \nan undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance \non  any  communication  or  advice  from  ADB;  and  (ii)  a  loan  in  various  currencies equivalent  to \nSDR44,286,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources which will have a 32-year term, including \na  grace  period  of  8  years,  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan and project agreements. \n \n17. \nThe  government  has  also  sought  a  loan  from  AFD  in  the  amount  equivalent  to  $40 \nmillion to finance part of the cost of the water supply subcomponent and associated consulting \nservices for design and supervision. Conditions and arrangements for AFD cofinancing will be \nthrough  a  bilateral  financing  agreement  to  be  negotiated  between  the  government  and  AFD \nafter  approval  of  the  loan  expected  in  December  2010.  AFD  will  administer  its  loan  and  the \ncoordination arrangements of this collaborative cofinancing will be detailed in a memorandum of \nunderstanding between ADB and AFD.  \n \n18. \nThe  two  ADB  loans,  which  amount  to  $90  million,  or  54.9%  of  the  project  investment \ncost),  will  be  used  to  finance  civil  works,  equipment,  consultants,  incremental  administration \ncosts,  and  financial  charges;  financing  from  AFD  of  $40  million  equivalent,  or  24.4%  of  the \nproject  investment  costs,  will  be  used  to  finance  civil  works  and  equipment  required  for \nimplementing part of the water supply component; and government financing in the amount of \n$34 million, or 20.75% of the total project investment costs, will be used to finance environment \nand social mitigation costs, and taxes and duties. \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n\nAmount\n($ million)\n\nShare of \nTotal (%) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n20.00\n70.00\n40.00\n34.04\n164.04 \n\n \n12.19 \n42.67 \n24.38 \n20.75 \n100.00\n\nSource \nA.

The  TA  output  will  be  capacity  built  for  service  delivery  through  training  for  the \nNWSDB (JRO), the Jaffna Municipal Council, urban councils, selected Pradeshiya Sabhas, and \nthe  Water  Resources  Board.  The  main  activities  will  be  (i)  conducting  a  detailed  needs \nassessment; (ii) formulating a 4-year capacity building program; (iii) identifying course providers \nand key staff to be trained; and (iv) conducting courses and annual training. The TA is estimated \nto cost $665,000 equivalent, of which $600,000 equivalent will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB's  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-IV).  The  government  will  finance  the \nremaining  $65,000  equivalent.  The  executing  and  implementing  agency  for  the  TA  is  the \nNWSDB.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  through  the  institutional  development  section  of  the \nproject management, coordination, and implementation unit (PMCIU). \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical  \n\n21. \nThe piped water supply system with water sourced from Iranamadu is currently the only \nviable  option  to  provide  27,000  cubic  meters  per  day  of  water  required  to  replace  the  Jaffna \nPeninsula's  reliance  on  increasingly  poor  quality  local  ground  water  supplies. 22  The  water \ntreatment  plant  will  be  a  conventional  surface  water  treatment  plant.  The  NWSDB  has \nexperience with such plants. This will require ensuring upstream management of the catchment \nand ensuring source protection by the government. Due to land constraints, a sewage treatment \nplant with a mechanical system is proposed. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n22. \nThe NWSDB suffers from large financial losses because of low tariffs, increasingly high \nenergy  costs,  high  nonrevenue  water,  and  high  accounts  receivables. However,  its  losses  are \ndeclining  as  a  result  of  major  tariff  revisions  in  2009  and  declining  operational  costs.  The \n\n                                                 \n22  Alternate sources were extensively considered during prefeasibility. Bore holes were constructed and modeling for \nvarious scenarios were undertaken. These show groundwater to be limited and not a current sustainable technical \noption. Continued study and modeling  will be a part of the project. Sources found sustainable can be considered \nfor  a  future  phase  of  water  supply.  Barrages  and  dikes,  first  introduced  in  the  1700s  by  the  Dutch  and  further \ndeveloped after, act as saltwater exclusion schemes. Their ongoing rehabilitation and reconstruction is expected to \ncontribute to reduced exposure and vulnerability of the aquifer.  \n\n \n\n\ffinancial internal rates of return for the water and sewerage subprojects are negative because of \nlarge capital costs. Nevertheless, the adopted subproject designs are considered the least-cost \noption. To maintain operation of the subprojects, it will be imperative to implement the indicative \nfinancial  improvement  action.  The  NWSDB  will  submit  to  ADB  income  statements  and  annual \nprojections  that  include  operations  and  maintenance,  debt  service,  and  depreciation  costs.  If \nannual  projections  show  negative  values,  the  NWSDB  will  raise  water  and  sewerage  tariffs  to \nsecure a positive net income ratio. Economic analysis shows that the economic internal rates of \nreturn  for  the  base scenarios  are  15.5%  for  water  supply  and  13.4%  for  sanitation.  These  are \nhigher than the economic opportunity cost of capital estimated at 12%. \n\nC. \n\n \nGovernance \n\nFinancial management assessment undertaken during project preparation indicates that \n23. \nthe  NWSDB  can  manage  loan  proceeds  during  project  implementation.  However,  for  the \nNWSDB to achieve the highest accuracy in accounting, it is necessary for NWSDB to complete \nand  fully  implement  the  ongoing  enterprise  resource  planning  system 23 development.  Also, \nregistration  of  newly  created  assets  in  accounting  books  is  generally  delayed  even  after  the \nNWSDB  completes  construction  work.  As  such,  depreciation  on  assets  is  not  accounted  for \nand/or  is  underestimated  by  the  NWSDB.  This  may  affect  the  tariff  revision  process,  as  the \nNWSDB\u2019s  tariff  policy  is  to  recover  operations  and  maintenance  costs  and  the  higher  of  debt \nservice costs or depreciation costs. \n \n24. \nThe  NWSDB,  a  central  institution  with  a  strong  provincial  presence,  has  been  the \nexecuting  agency  for  ADB  projects  in  Sri  Lanka  before,  and  is  familiar  with  ADB  operational \nguidelines.24 However,  as  the  project  deals  with  water  resources  and  entails  transmission  of \nwater from the mainland to the Jaffna Peninsula in a post-conflict setting, the project proposes \nthat the NWSDB pay more attention to stakeholder consultation than in previous projects it has \nadministered.  The  project  will  encourage  and  strengthen  institutions  directly  linked  to  project \nexecution to conduct consultations with not only beneficiaries but all persons who might possibly \nbe  affected  by  the  project,  preferably  on  an  ongoing  basis.  Special  attention  will  be  paid  to \nmanaging  grievances  of\u2014and  ensuring  that  benefits  accrue  to\u2014farmer  communities  living  in \nand  around  the  water  source  (Iranamadu  Tank).  Relevant  institutions  will  be  strengthened  to \ndeal with amicably resolving any water-rights disputes and conflicts that may arise.  \n \n25. \nThe  government  will  provide  ADB  with  detailed  quarterly  progress  reports  on  project \nimplementation,  which  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  procedures.  Independent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB \nwill  audit  the  project  accounts,  including  the  imprest  accounts,  second-generation  imprest \naccounts, and statement of expenditures.  \n \n26. \nProcurement  will  be  carried  out  by  the  PMCIU  and  the  project  implementation  unit. \nGoods, related services, and works to be financed from the loan will be procured in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). Civil works contracts \nvalued  at  $3  million  equivalent  and  above  and  equipment  contracts  valued  at  $500,000  and \nabove will be undertaken through international competitive bidding procedures, while civil works \ncontracts  valued  at  less  than  $3  million  will  be  carried  out  under  national  competitive  bidding. \nEquipment  packages  valued  below  $500,000  will  be  procured  following  national  competitive \n\n                                                 \n23 Enterprise  resource  planning  is  generally  an  integrated  computer-based  system  used  to  manage  internal  and \n\nexternal resources, such as tangible assets, financial resources, materials, and human resources. \n\n24 This  will be the sixth ADB project executed by the NWSDB,  which has also implemented large projects for other \ndevelopment partners. The NWSDB is generally experienced in procuring infrastructure schemes and contracts of \nsubstantial  size  required  to  meet  international  standards.  Moreover,  given  that  the  agency  is  run  by  professional \nengineers, the NWSDB generally possesses sufficient technical knowledge to assess bids. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nbidding  procedures  and  packages  valued  at  $100,000  equivalent  and  below  will  be  under \nshopping procedures. The summary of major procurement packages are in Table 3. \n \n27. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government,  the  NWSDB,  and  the  Northern  Provincial  Council.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 21). \n\nD. \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\n28. \nSafe water and sanitation are basic needs, and providing those needs in the project area \nwill  directly  reduce  poverty.  Increasing  access  to  safe  water  and  improving  sanitation  further \nreduce  poverty  by  (i)  improving  public  health  and  reducing  malnutrition,  resulting  in  reduced \nexpenditures  on  health  and  reduced  work  days  lost  from  morbidity  (which  in  turn  leads  to \nincreased labor productivity and income); and (ii) time savings from water collection, particularly \nfor  women  and  children,  resulting  in  more  time  for  productive  activities  and  improving  human \ncapital.  The  project  will  (i)  provide  access  to  household  water  connections  and  metered \ncommunity water facilities in poor areas, and (ii) provide low-cost sanitation programs for poor \ncommunities  in  the  form  of  individual  household  or  communal  latrines.  Management  of  water \nand sanitation facilities for the poor will be through a participatory approach.25  \n \nParticipation  is  a  crucial  element  of  the  project's  pro-poor  approach.  The  project  will \n29. \nprovide  opportunities  to  form  and  empower  community-based  organizations,  and  will  help \nvulnerable groups and the very poor obtain water connections through a scheme of staggered \npayments for water connections. Nongovernment organizations will be engaged to support the \nPMCIU  and  local  governments  in  mobilizing  communities  and  delivering  essential  training  for \ncommunity-based organizations in planning, monitoring, and evaluating sanitation and hygiene \nimprovement. Local authorities will be invited to play an active role in service delivery planning \nand administration, and community leaders will be invited to actively participate in the proposed \nproject\u2019s  water  conservation,  environmental  protection,  and  hygiene  awareness  campaign.  A \nseparate  grant  is  proposed  to  provide  relief  to  communities  outside  the  service  area  of  the \nproposed  loan.  This  grant  will  provide  water  and  sanitation  services  and  livelihood  support  to \nreturning internally displaced persons and others living in poor rural communities.26 \n \n30. \nDespite  women\u2019s  major  responsibilities  in  collecting,  using,  and  managing  water,  they \nare  rarely  involved  in  decision  making  on  the  planning,  design,  and  construction  of  water \nfacilities.  To  maximize  benefits  for  women,  the  project  must  recognize  their  role  and  needs  in \nthe  decision  making  process.  Key  issues  to  be  addressed  include  (i)  consulting  with  both \nwomen and men on issues surrounding water transfer, the use of water for cultivation, drinking \nwater,  and  sanitation;  (ii)  mainstreaming  gender  concerns  into  water  and  sanitation  at \norganizational  and  program  levels;  and  (iii)  building  the  capacities  of  both  men  and  women  to \nenable an effective mainstreaming process.27  \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nEnvironment.  The  project  is  categorized  as  environmental  category  B  and  an  initial \n31. \nenvironmental  examination  (IEE)  with  a  detailed  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  was \n\n                                                 \n25 Strategies are further discussed in the Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of \n\n26 The proposed grant design will provide human and financial capacity support and monitoring to facilitate operation \n\nlinked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\nand maintenance of rural schemes. \n\n27  Detailed in the Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fprepared in accordance with ADB's Safeguards Policy Statement (2009).28 The IEE concludes \nthat  no  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  are  anticipated.29 The  project's  significant \nenvironmental  benefits  will  include  protection  of  the  fragile  aquifer,  improved  hygiene  and \nsanitary  conditions,  improved  wastewater  treatment  and  disposal,  improved  ecosystem  health \nresulting from reduced discharge of wastewater into sensitive areas, and reduced water losses \nfrom  the  currently  inefficient  water  distribution  system.  Mitigation  measures  and  monitoring \nplans  have  been  proposed  in  the  EMP.  The  EMP  will  be  implemented  and  monitored  by  the \nPMCIU.  Project  engineering  and  institutional  consultants  will  assist  the  PMCIU  in  ensuring \nimplementation of the EMP.  \n \nSocial. The project is category B for involuntary resettlement.30 A resettlement plan was \n32. \nprepared for the acquisition of a 0.3-hectare privately owned land plot affecting one household. \nThe project is category C for indigenous peoples. The population in the project area is largely \nhomogenous (Tamil) and the socioeconomic survey and consultations show that no distinctive \nand separate indigenous peoples live in the project area.  \n \nThe  NWSDB  has  developed  internal  safeguards  capacity  from  past  and  ongoing ADB-\n33. \nsupported  projects.  However,  given  the  sensitivity  of  the  Jaffna  Peninsula  in  the  post-conflict \ncontext,  the  project  will  ensure  that  adequate  numbers  of  staff  are  in  place  to  handle  both \nenvironmental and social safeguards during project implementation.31 The IEE and resettlement \nplan  will  be  posted  on  ADB's  website.  Annual  EMP  and  resettlement  plan  implementation \nprogress reports will be provided to ADB. \n \nF. \n\n \nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n34.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4.  \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n\nRisks \nLack of capacity in service delivery \n\nEconomic growth cannot be easily projected  \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe project includes technical assistance for building capacity for water \nsupply and sanitation service delivery through training for the NWSDB \n(JRO), the Jaffna Municipal Council, urban councils, selected \nPradeshiya Sabhas, and the Water Resources Board. \nBecause of the 30-year conflict, unrestricted access only recently \nbecame possible. Because of the Northern Province\u2019s uncertain \neconomic growth potential, the project constitutes just the first phase of \nan adopted phased approach. The project covers basic requirements \nfor a 20-year projected population and a conservative growth pattern. \nThe project scope has been phased to accommodate a 50% swing in \nwater demand.\n\nWater demand grows at a slower or more rapid \npace than planned  \nEssential water tariff revisions are not undertaken  Government to assure in loan agreement. \nGovernment to assure in loan agreement. \nSewerage tariffs do not cover operations and \nmaintenance  \nNo cash flow for operations and maintenance of \nnew systems \n \n\nNew water supply and sewerage systems will be phased for highest \npriority areas. As demand increases further capacity will be added by \nfuture projects.\n\n                                                 \n28  A  single  environmental  and  social  assessment  and  planning  process  and  unified  safeguard  documentation, \nconsultation, and disclosure requirements  will be adopted to  satisfy the safeguard principles and requirements of \nADB and AFD. \n\n29 Location  impacts  include  minor  loss  of  on-site  ecology  and  the  conversion  of  small  amounts  of  rural  agricultural \nland.  Construction-related  impacts  relate  to  dust  generation  from  excavation  activities;  and  increased  vibrations, \nnoise, fumes, and traffic disruption during construction activities. Good engineering design and management plans \nwill  minimize  these  impacts  as  well  as  any  impacts  associated  with  operations.  All  effluent  discharge  will  comply \nwith national standards. \n\n30 Rehabilitation work will be undertaken within existing facilities and new construction will be undertaken on vacant \ngovernment  land,  wherever  possible.  Where  land  acquisition  is  required,  project  design  ensures  that  no \ndisplacement will result and that the land is not a significant source of income or subsistence. \n\n31 This includes  an environmental officer and a resettlement  officer. Through the PMCIU, these officers  will monitor \n\nand supervise the EMP, and coordinate any land acquisition and resettlement activities. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks \nFunding for irrigation support not secured \n \nDelays in obtaining A9 right of way  \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nGovernment is committed and provides assurance that the funds for \nirrigation will be provided. \nGovernment to ensure coordination with relevant agencies in \nscheduling pipe-laying and road repairs, and will ensure that it is \npermitted to lay water lines under existing or future carriageways, if \nrequired.\nThe project includes capacity building to coordinate water resource \nmanagement and a public awareness campaign. \n\nEmergence of other water users or polluters not \nunder the influence of NWSDB \nA9 = Kandy to Jaffna Highway, JRO=Jaffna Regional Office, NWSDB = National Water Supply and Drainage Board.\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n35. \nThe government and the NWSDB have assured ADB that implementation of the project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n \n36. \nproject, which are set forth in the loan and project agreements.  \n \n\nThe  government  and  the  NWSDB  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loans  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \n\n37. \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB), and recommend that the Board approve: \n \n(i) \n\nthe loan of $20,000,000 to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Jaffna \nand  Kilinochchi  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;
