The  economic \n2. \nreforms  introduced  by  the  Government  in  1991  have  liberalized  trade  and  industry,  opened \nseveral  sectors  to  private  investment,  and  increased  the  role  of  market  forces.  The  domestic \neconomy is also better integrated with the global economy through capital and technology flows. \nThe  Tenth  Five  Year  Plan  (2002\u20132007)  envisages  an  average  gross  domestic  product  (GDP) \ngrowth rate of 8%. It also specifies various other objectives aimed at enhancing human welfare.  \n \n3. \nThe  provision  of  adequate  infrastructure  is  essential  for  the  achievement  of  growth \ntargets. A consensus has formed within the development community that there is also a strong \nlink between infrastructure development and poverty reduction. Given the large geographic area \nand  population  of  India,  the  future  financing  requirements  for  infrastructure  development  are \nconsiderable.  The \ninvestment \nrequirements equal 7\u20138% of GDP. \n \n4. \nThe public sector has historically been the main provider of infrastructure in India. The \nbudget for 2005/06 sees large sums of money allocated for infrastructure, including as much as \nRs 930 billion for highway construction. The budget also includes the launch of a 4-year plan to \nimprove rural infrastructure. The plan is currently being drawn up, and funding for the plan has \nyet  to  be  allocated.  The  Government\u2019s  fiscal  deficit  currently  stands  at  approximately  4.8%  of \nGDP and the total public sector debt burden has reached 80% of GDP. This severely limits the \nability of the Government to meet the future infrastructure financing requirements, and the focus \nis shifting toward the private sector. Moving forward, the ability to mobilize private capital will be \nkey to infrastructure development in India. \n \n\nInfrastructure  Report1  estimated \n\ninfrastructure \n\nIndia \n\nthat \n\n1. \n\nSector Review \n\n5. \nAlthough recent government pronouncements have increasingly emphasized the need to \nsecure  investment  in  major  infrastructure  projects,  real  progress  has  been  made  only  in  the \ntelecommunications sector and, more recently, in road construction.2\n \n\n2. \n\nRoads \n\nIndia's poor road network has received renewed emphasis in recent years. There are 3 \n6. \nmillion  kilometers  of  roads,  most  of  which  are  poorly  maintained.  National  highways  cover \n65,565 kilometers and carry approximately 40% of total road transport. The ambitious National \n\n                                                 \n1  National  Council  of  Applied  Economics  and  Research.  1996.  India  Infrastructure  Report:  Policy  Imperatives  for \n\nGrowth and Welfare. New Delhi. \n\n2 Main source for the sector review: Economist Intelligence Unit. 2004. Country Profile: India. London.  \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nHighway Development  Program (NHDP) is upgrading more than 14,000 kilometers of national \nhighways  in  the  Golden  Quadrilateral  (Delhi,  Kolkata,  Chennai,  and  Mumbai)  and  the  North\u2013\nSouth  and  East\u2013West  corridors  at  a  total  cost  of  approximately  $13  billion\u2013$15  billion.  In \naddition, plans have been developed to continue the expansion of the NHDP in five additional \nstages to be implemented over 7 years. The total cost of this new series of NHDP is estimated \nat $40 billion. The Government intends for the private sector to implement and finance 44% of \nthe  new  program.  In  addition  to  the  NHDP  program,  the  Government  plans  to  initiate  a \nnortheastern  state  program  valued  at  $2.8  billion,  of  which  the  National  Highway  Authority  of \nIndia will develop about 10\u201315% on a build-operate-transfer basis. The remaining 85\u201390% will \nbe developed by the Border Road Organization under public sector financing mechanisms. \n \n\n3. \n\nPorts \n\n7. \nIndia  has  13  major  ports,  seven  on  the  east  coast  and  six  on  the  west.  They  are \nmanaged  by  the  Port  Trust  of  India.  An  additional  148  minor  ports,  managed  by  state \ngovernments, account for 18% of total cargo handled. The major ports (encompassing 82% of \nall cargo) handled 314 million tons (t) of cargo in FY2002/03, compared with a capacity of 363 \nmillion  tons.  India\u2019s  ports  are  plagued  by  inefficiency.  Poor  port  governance  and  inefficient \ncustoms clearing translate into high costs. An identical shipment of textiles to the United States \nfrom  India  costs,  on  average,  20%  more  than  from  Thailand  and  35%  more  than  from  China. \nGovernment initiatives to increase private sector participation include: automatic approval for up \nto  100%  foreign  ownership  in  port  and  harbor  construction  projects;  establishing  a  Tariff \nAuthority for Major Ports to determine port charges collected by private providers; and setting up \na  Maritime  States  Development  Council  to  help  frame  an  integrated  port  development  policy. \nThe Government has also drawn up plans to promote joint ventures between major Indian ports \nand minor foreign ports in a bid to attract new technology and improve management practices. \n \n\n4. \n\nCivil Aviation \n\n8. \nThe state-owned domestic carrier, Indian Airlines, has retained a dominant position in air \ntransport  despite  liberalization  of  the  sector  to  allow  private  domestic\u2014but  not  foreign\u2014\noperators.  Private  operators,  notably  Jet  Airways  and  Sahara,  have  steadily  increased  their \nmarket share. The state-owned international carrier, Air India, has continued to suffer losses as \na  result  of  increased  competition  and  a  rising  wage  bill.  Plans  to  lease  out  Mumbai,  Delhi, \nChennai,  and  Kolkata  international  airports  have  been  drawn  up,  and  three  new  international \nairports will be constructed with private sector participation in Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Goa. \n \n\n5. \n\nTelecommunications \n\n9. \nIndia\u2019s  telecommunications  sector  has  registered  rapid  growth  in  recent  years,  spurred \nby  reforms  to  introduce  greater  competition  to  the  sector.  However,  market  penetration  is  still \nrelatively  low.  There  is  an  average  of  one  public  phone  for  every  383  people  living  in  India\u2019s \ncities,  and  3.8  million  of  India's  6  million  villages  currently  have  a  public  telephone.  Mobile \nphone services have been liberalized since 1994. The number of mobile subscribers grew from \n3.2 million at the end of 2000 to about 10.9 million by the end of 2003. Basic telecommunication \nservices  have  also  been  liberalized,  but  so  far  private  services  are  being  offered  in  only  six \nstates (Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Punjab). The \nstate-owned international call carrier lost its monopoly and was privatized on 1 April 2002. Long-\ndistance  services  have  been  open  to  private  competition  since  January  2000.  Rates  for  long-\ndistance and international calls have fallen, but remain high by international standards. Internet \nconnectivity  remains  low  at  six  users  per  1,000  people,  compared  with  26  users  per  1,000 \npeople in China. \n\n\f \n\n \n \n\n6. \n\nPower \n\n \n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\nAlthough total power generated has continued to increase, reaching 573.2 billion kilowatt \n10. \nhours  in  FY2001/02,  shortages  amounted  to  6%  of  total  demand,  rising  to  over  12%  at  peak \ntimes.  Problems  in  the  power  sector  include  inefficient  state  electricity  boards,  high  levels  of \npower  theft,  unsound  cross-subsidization  policies,  and  chronic  underinvestment.  The  average \ncost  of  power  in  India  exceeds  Rs4  per  unit.  This  compares  with  less  than  Rs2  in  the  United \nStates and Rs2.5 in South Korea. India\u2019s power sector urgently requires substantial investment. \nHowever,  after  decades  of  neglect,  the  public  sector  lacks  the  necessary  resources,  and  the \nprivate  sector  is  unwilling  to  fill  the  gap,  deterred  by  the  fact  that  the  main  electricity \npurchasers\u2014the state-owned State Electricity Boards\u2014are bankrupt. Only industry is charged a \nmarket  rate,  while  more  than  25%  of  power  generated  is  lost  in  transmission  and  distribution, \nmuch  of  it  stolen.  The  central  Government  has  drawn  up  an  agreement  with  the  state \nadministrations whereby State Electricity Boards would charge users market rates for electricity, \nreserving subsidies for those genuinely in need. In return, the central Government will cover the \n$5.6  billion  that  the  Sate  Electricity  Boards  owe  power  generators,  through  the  issue  of  long-\nterm bonds. In an effort to stimulate further investment in the power sector, proposals for 100% \nforeign  direct  investment  in  electricity  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  projects  up  to \naround $300 million receive automatic approval. Power transmission has also been opened to \nthe private sector. \n \n\n7. \n\nCoal, Oil, and Gas \n\nIndia\u2019s  total  coal  reserves  are  estimated  to  be  about  200  billion  tons,  while  proven \n11. \nreserves total about 70 billion tons. Coal accounts for 67% of commercial energy supplies, but it \nis a polluting and inefficient energy source because of its high ash content. Low levels of mining \nproductivity are also a serious problem. In an attempt to promote greater investment, regulation \nhas been reduced and coal mining no longer requires licenses. India is a net importer of oil. In \nFY1998/99,  India  produced  64.5  million  tons  of  refined  products  and  consumed  90.6  million \ntons.  Boosted  by  the  start  of  production  at  Reliance  Industries\u2019  27  million-ton  refinery,  in \nFY2001/02  the  crude  imports  deficit  of  refined  products  turned  into  a  net  export  of  3.1  million \ntons. Over 75% of India\u2019s total estimated reserves of 17 billion tons oil equivalent is in the form \nof natural gas. India has introduced measures to encourage the production of natural gas. With \nregard to distribution, the price and distribution controls that were introduced at the time of the \noil crisis in the 1970s were finally removed on 1 April 2002, and a number of Indian and foreign \ncompanies have received licenses to open petrol stations.  \n \n\n8.  \n\nTourism Sector \n\nA  sustained  promotional  campaign  undertaken  by  the  Government  has  led  to  a \n12. \nsubstantial increase in foreign tourists\u2014to more than 3 million arrivals in 2004. Occupancy rates \nand average room rentals have surged, leading to strong growth for companies in the industry, \nreflected by the robust performance of hotel companies. A number of companies are expanding \ncapacity  to  meet  the  acute  shortage  of  rooms  and  increase  their  borrowings,  which  provides \nopportunities  for  equity  investors.  Tourist  inflow  is  likely  to  continue  to  increase  with  the \nimprovement of airports and road infrastructure across the country. \n \nAcross  all  sectors,  infrastructure  remains  inadequate  to  support  sustained  high \n13. \neconomic growth rates. However, regulations are evolving to support private sector participation \nand generate more investment opportunities in Indian infrastructure businesses.  \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nChallenges and Opportunities\n\n \n \nB.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n14. \nIn order to overcome impediments, the Government of India launched the Infrastructure \nDevelopment  Finance  Company  Ltd.  (IDFC)  in  1997  to  finance  private  sector  infrastructure \nprojects. ADB was an investor in IDFC from its inception. To date, IDFC is effectively a publicly \nowned  company,  but  it  is  in  the  process  of  increasing  its  private  ownership  and  has  recently \nlisted its shares on the National and Bombay Stock Exchanges. Over the past few years, IDFC \nhas  rapidly  expanded  its  rupee-based  lending  to  Indian  infrastructure  projects  and  firmly \nestablished its position in the Indian market. \n \n15.  While  local-currency  debt  capital  is  now  available  for  infrastructure  projects,  equity \ncapital  is  still  lacking.  Financial  institutions  and  commercial  banks  conduct  due  diligence  of \ninfrastructure  undertakings  and  assess  the  technological  and  commercial  viability  of  the \nprojects. In most situations, the financial institutions and commercial banks insist on a financing \nmix of debt and equity with a ratio of 70 to 30.  \n \nThere  have  been  many  situations  in  which  domestic  entrepreneurs  in  India  have  been \n16. \nunable  to  raise  their  equity  contribution  for  otherwise  viable  projects.  Investments  in \ninfrastructure projects have been restrained because of this lack of equity capital. \n \nTo  promote  equity  investment  in  infrastructure,  the  Government  has  added  a  new \n17. \nclause\u2014Section  10  (23G)\u2014to  the  Income  Tax  Act  that  provides  financial  incentives  for  equity \ninvestments  in  infrastructure  undertaken  by  infrastructure  funds  and  infrastructure  capital \ncompanies. In addition, the Securities and Exchange Board of India has recognized funds with a \nclear  focus  on  infrastructure  as  venture  capital  funds,  and  has  permitted  their  registration  as \nsuch.  By  registering  as  venture  capital  funds,  these  entities  are  entitled  to  certain  financial \nbenefits,  such  as  a  10-year  tax  holiday,  and  are  exempted  from  obtaining  approvals  from  the \nReserve Bank of India and the Foreign Investment Promotion Board. Appendix 1 reviews recent \nregulatory changes supporting private equity investments in India.   \n \n18. \nTo complement the IDFC\u2019s provision of debt capital, the Ministry of Finance in 2003 set \nup  the  India  Development  Fund  I,  an  infrastructure  equity  fund  managed  by  IDFC  Private \nEquity,  a  100%  subsidiary  of  IDFC.  The  India  Development  Fund  I  is  the  predecessor  fund  of \nthe proposed Fund.  \n \n19. \nThe  India  Development  Fund  I\u2019s  shareholders  include  leading  financial  institutions  in \nIndia.  In  effect,  the  fund  is  mostly  owned  by  state-owned  companies.  One  of  the  purposes  of \nADB's  possible  involvement  is  to  support  the  Fund  in  mobilizing  resources  from  international \ninvestors for the first time.   \n \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5\n\n \n\nA. \n\nObjectives and Description  \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED FUND \n\nSponsor and Co-investors \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n20. \nADB  proposes  to  make  an  equity  investment  in  the  Fund  in  an  amount  of  up  to  the \nlesser of $45 million or 25% of the Fund\u2019s total share capital, including parallel vehicles, if any. \nADB will not be the largest investor in the Fund, taking into consideration the commitments to \nthe Indian fund, at any time.  \n \n21. \nThe  primary  objective  of  the  Fund  will  be  to  achieve  medium-term  capital  gains  by \ninvesting in high-growth infrastructure businesses in India, principally through equity or equity-\nrelated instruments. The Fund aims to take advantage of the ongoing increase in expenditures \nin Indian infrastructure by focusing on investments in private companies engaged in developing, \nconstructing, maintaining, or operating infrastructure facilities or services in India. The Fund may \nalso invest in foreign companies that have a significant presence in India and play a substantial \nrole in providing infrastructure facilities or services. \n \nB.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n22. \nThe Fund will be managed by IDFC Private Equity Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the \nInfrastructure  Development  Finance  Company  (IDFC),  an  Indian  financial  institution  set  up  in \n1997, which focuses on financing infrastructure projects in India. \n \n23. \nfinancing large infrastructure projects.  \n \n24. \nIDFC  Private  Equity  is  currently  managing  India\u2019s  largest  domestic  infrastructure  fund, \nthe  India  Development  Fund  I.  The  Fund  manager  has  taken  a  proactive  role  in  sourcing \ninvestments and created most of India Development Fund I\u2019s transactions.  \n \n25. \nreputation for smooth execution and competence.  \n \nC.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \nThe  Indian  fund  will  be  managed  by  IDFC  Private  Equity  Limited,  a  public  limited \n26. \ncompany incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1956. The role of the Fund manager is \nto (i) identify potential fund investment opportunities, (ii) screen investment proposals based on \na thorough appraisal of the feasibility and risks, (iii) supervise and monitor fund investments, (iv) \ndispose  of  the  shares  of  companies  invested  at  the  time  of  exit,  and  (v)  undertake  all  Fund \naccounting, compliance, and investor reporting. The Fund manager will be contractually bound \nto carry out its responsibilities in accordance with the Fund\u2019s investment policy.  \n \n \n \n \n\nIn just 2 years the team has invested most of  the Fund and in doing so has created a \n\nThe  sponsor  of  the  Fund  is  IDFC,  which  has  extensive  expertise  in  appraising  and \n\nGovernance Structure  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fIV. \n\nINVESTMENT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\n \n\n6 \n\n \nA. \n \n\nJustification \n\n1. \n\nDevelopment Impact \n\n27. \ndevelopment objectives: \n \n\nBy  providing  financing  for  this  transaction,  ADB  intends  to  achieve  the  following \n\nHelp  India  meet  the  infrastructure  development  requirements  that  are  essential \nfor sustained economic growth.  \n\nSupport the Government\u2019s strategy of encouraging private sector participation in \ninfrastructure  development,  given  the  large  investment  requirements  and  the \nlimited  amount  of  public  sector  financing  available.  The  Fund  will  help  the \nGovernment  reroute  resources  from  investments  in  infrastructure  to  other  types \nof expenditure. \n\nMobilize  long-term  capital  in  the  form  of  private  equity  from  private  sources  for \ninfrastructure development. \n\nDiversify  sources  of  finance  available  to  infrastructure  companies  by  including \nequity finance, which enables these companies to buy fixed assets to be used as \ncollateral for commercial bank loans, thereby leveraging their expansion.  \n\nDemonstrate to the private sector that investment in infrastructure companies in \nIndia can be commercially attractive, thus mobilizing investments by building up \nlocal private equity investment management capacity in a specialized area. \n\nContribute  to  the  development  of  a  well-functioning  regulatory  and  legal \nenvironment in India. The Fund will be required to collect consistent information \non  regulatory  problems  encountered  by  the  infrastructure  businesses  in  the \nportfolio  encounter.  The  Fund  will  report  this  information  on  a  regular  basis  to \nADB's  South  Asia  Department  to  support  the  formulation  of  a  conducive \nregulatory framework for private infrastructure companies. \n\nValue added of ADB  \n\nADB involvement adds value to the Fund in the following ways: \n\n \n28. \n \n\nCatalytic and demonstration effect. Given the significant risks and challenges \nfacing  potential  investors,  ADB  will  serve  a  catalytic  role  in  attracting  additional \nlocal and foreign long-term private investments to India. ADB will demonstrate by \nits intervention the credibility of infrastructure equity finance in India and mobilize \ncapital  to  support  other  private  equity  funds.  This  Fund  is  particularly  well \npositioned  to  achieve  a  demonstration  effect  as  ADB  is  to  support  the  Fund  in \nmobilizing resources from international investors for the first time.  \n\nPrivate sector development. The Fund will make a direct contribution to private \nsector development in India. The Fund, with a portion of its funding coming from \nprivate  institutional  investors,  will  employ  market-based  mechanisms  to  develop \nprofitable  and  sustainable  private  infrastructure  companies.

This  strategy  stresses  the  relevance  and  impact  of  ADB\u2019s  private \nequity  investments  and  describes  how  ADB  intends  to  tailor  ADB's  products  to  the  specific \nrequirements of the beneficiary countries.  \n \nB. \n\nMeasuring Development Effectiveness \n\n \n30. \nPSOD  and  Operations  Evaluation  Department  (OED)  are  in  the  process  of  formulating \nguidelines  for  implementing  good  practice  standards  (GPS)  for  evaluation  of  private  sector \ninvestment  operations,  which  were  prepared  by  the  Evaluation  Cooperation  Group3  of  the \nmultilateral  development  banks.  These  GPS  cover  the  roles  of  the  independent  evaluation \ndepartment and the private sector department itself, the evaluation dimensions for private sector \noperations,  the  nature  of  annual  reporting,  dissemination  of  reports,  and  lessons  learned. \nAccording  to  the  GPS,  the  three  principal  dimensions  for  private  sector  evaluation  are \ndevelopment  outcome,  investment  profitability  for  the  multilateral  finance  institution,  and \noperational effectiveness. PSOD will measure the expected development outcome of this Fund \nat the Fund level, the subproject level, and beyond the Fund by monitoring certain performance \nmeasures  for  the  duration  of  the  Fund.  The  performance  measures  for  development  outcome \nare encompassed in three key areas: \n\nBusiness performance. Will assess the extent to which the Fund has reached \nits objectives in terms of overall profitability and commercial viability of the Fund \nand subprojects.  \n\nEconomic  sustainability.  Will  evaluate  the  Fund's  and  subprojects'  effects  on \nthe  developing  member  country's  economy  and  the  associated  benefits  and \ncosts.  On  one  hand,  these  measures  assess  the  extent  to  which  the  Fund \nimproved the allocation of resources and provision of financial services to viable \nprivate  enterprises.  On  the  other  hand,  these  measures  evaluate  whether  the \nsubprojects directly generated benefits to the local economy. \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\nPrivate  sector  development.  Addresses  the  Fund\u2019s  impact  on  private  sector \ndevelopment beyond the Fund and its immediate stakeholders\u2014i.e., the Fund\u2019s \ncontribution  to  the  growth  of  viable  financial  institutions  and  financial  markets \ndevelopment. \n\n \nA set of quantitative and qualitative performance measures has been developed to track \n31. \nthe development impact of this investment for each key area. These performance measures are \nprovided in Appendix 2. \n\nEnvironmental Protection and Social Safeguard Guidelines \n\nC.  \n \n                                                 \n3   The  Evaluation  Cooperation  Group  was  established  by  the  multilateral  development  banks  for  the  purpose  of \ndesigning common evaluation standards for private sector operations. The Evaluation Cooperation Group\u2019s work is \nongoing  and  some  aspects  of  the  existing  evaluative  framework  might  be  subject  to  change  according  to  best \npractices. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nThe Fund is classified as category FI.4 The Project's impact on indigenous peoples has \n32. \nbeen classified as C (no impact). All companies in which the Fund invests will also comply with \nADB\u2019s  environmental  and  social  safeguard  policies,  including  policies  related  to  involuntary \nresettlement and indigenous people as well as all environmental laws and regulations in force \nwithin  the  relevant  jurisdiction.  The  Fund  will  also  comply  with  anti-money  laundering  and \nfinancing of terrorism policies. \n \n33. \nThe  implementation  of  an  environmental  management  system  that  includes  ADB \nenvironmental  and  social  safeguards  represents  an  essential  value  addition  by  ADB  to  this \nprivate  equity  fund.  Close  coordination  with  ADB  will  be  necessary  to  ensure  that  the  Fund \nmanager  possesses  the  skills  to  screen  and  categorize  prospective  investments  based  on \nenvironmental and social impacts. The Fund will ensure that at least one of its employees has \nreceived  environmental  training  and  training  in  application  of  ADB's  social  safeguard  policies. \nThe Fund manager will appoint a senior officer to implement and supervise the environmental \nand  social  management  system  and  an  environmental  coordinator  to  conduct  reviews  of \ninvestee companies with respect to all applicable ADB policies. The Fund has developed and is \ncommitted to implementing an environmental management system that is satisfactory to ADB. \nThe  environmental  management  system  might  be  adapted \nto  accommodate  bilateral \ndevelopment  finance  institutions  that  invest  in  the  Fund,  in  which  case  it  will  be  submitted  to \nADB\u2019s Environment and Social Safeguards Division for approval.  \n \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nADB will enter into suitable documentation that will indicate ADB\u2019s commitment to invest \n34. \nan amount up to the lesser of $45,000,000 or 25% of the Fund\u2019s total share capital (including \nparallel  investment  vehicles,  if  any)  following  approval  of  the  investment  by  ADB\u2019s  Board  of \nDirectors. ADB will not be the largest investor in the Fund, taking into consideration investments \ninto  the  Indian  fund.  ADB  will  satisfy  itself  with  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  all  principal \ndocuments associated with its investment in the Fund.  \n \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n35. \nI am satisfied that the proposed investment in IDFC Private Equity Fund II as described \nin  this  report  complies  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove  the  investment  of  up  to  the  lesser  of  $45,000,000  or  25%  of  the  Fund\u2019s  total  share \ncapital (including parallel investment vehicles, if any) in IDFC Private Equity Fund II from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n10 January 2006 \n \n\n                                                 \n4   FI stands for financial intermediary. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9\n\n \n\nTHE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT OF THE PRIVATE EQUITY INDUSTRY IN INDIA \n\n \n1. \nThe  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India  (SEBI)  issued  its  Regulations  for  Venture \nCapital  in  1996,  thus  establishing  the  agency\u2019s  authority  over  the  funds,  the  limits  on  their \nactivities, and incentives for them to finance and rescue troubled companies. There are no legal \nor  regulatory  differences  between  venture  capital  firms  and  private  equity  firms.  The \nGovernment  first  permitted  financial  institutions,  commercial  banks  (including  foreign  banks), \nand subsidiaries of commercial banks to establish venture capital companies under guidelines \nissued in 1988. In addition, under current central-bank regulations, banks\u2019 investments in mutual \nfunds catering to venture capital funding are considered to be outside the ceilings applicable to \nbanks\u2019 investments in corporate equity and debt.1\n \n2. \nIndia has allowed foreign venture capital funds to operate since 1995. They may either \nhold shares of unlisted Indian companies directly (up to a maximum of 25% of equity) or route \ntheir  investments  through  domestic  venture  capital  funds  and  companies.  Prior  to  guidelines \nissued in September 2000, direct exposure by offshore private equity funds in shares of unlisted \ncompanies was treated as a foreign direct investment, and approval was needed, in line with the \nGovernment\u2019s  general  policy  on  foreign  investments.  Indocean  Venture  Fund  (now  Indocean \nChase),  originally  set  up  by  George  Soros  and  Chemical  Bank,  was  the  first  such  overseas \nprivate equity fund. \n \n3. \nThe  regulatory  environment  for  the  private  equity  industry  was  being  simplified  during \n1995\u20132000.  Foreign  institutional  investors  participated  in  the  growth  of  the  private  equity \nindustry through the foreign direct investment regulations of the Government and the simplified \ntax  administration  procedures  under  the  Indo\u2013Mauritius  Double  Taxation  Avoidance  Treaty. \nWhile  the  foreign  direct  investment  route  offered  minimum  investment  restrictions  for  private \nequity funds, exit pricing and repatriation of capital were regulated by the Reserve Bank of India. \nIn order to bring these capital flows under regulations of the venture capital industry, new SEBI \nregulations  were  issued  with  simplified  exit  pricing  and  repatriation  procedures  for  foreign \ninvestors. \n \nFollowing amendments to the 2000 budget, the Government allowed private equity funds \n4. \n\u201cpass-through\u201d status, meaning that no tax is levied on the distributed or undistributed income of \nthe funds. To avoid double taxation, a private equity fund's income is taxed only in the hands of \nthe investor. \n \n5. \nSEBI  was  also  made  the  sole  regulatory  authority,  to  which  private  equity  funds  must \nsubmit  quarterly  reports.  In  September  2000  SEBI  announced  the  guidelines  that  currently \ngovern  venture  capital  investment,  based  on  the  January  2000  recommendations  of  the \nChandrashekhar committee on venture capital. After another set of amendments in April 2004, \nthe following rules now apply: \n\n(i) \n\nForeign  venture  capital  investors  can  invest  in  India  without  approvals  from  the \nForeign Investment Promotion Board if they register with SEBI. \n\n                                                 \n1  Dossani,  Rafiq,   and   Martin  Kenney.   2002.

The \nfund cannot invest in associated companies of ventures that it finances. \n\nA  fund  must  invest  66.67%  (lowered  from  75%  in  April  2004)  of  its  investable \nfunds  in  unlisted  equity  or  equity-linked  instruments.  The  remaining  33.3%  can \nbe  invested  in  subscriptions  to  initial  public  offerings  (IPOs)  of  companies  or  in \ndebt instruments of a  company in which the  venture fund has already  made an \nequity investment. \n\nThe  April  2004  amendments  removed  a  previous  one-year  lock-up  for  IPO \nsubscriptions.  They  also  allowed  investments  within  the  33.3%  category  in \npreferential allotments of equity shares of a listed company, subject to a one-year \nlock-in, and in equity shares or equity-linked instruments of a listed company that \nis financially weak. \n\nThe removal of a profitability criterion as a listing requirement had an important \neffect  on  the  private  equity  industry  as  it  provided  an  exit  mechanism  for \ninvestors,  in  particular  for  technology  companies.  To  replace  the  profitability \nrequirement, a firm will would be delisted if it did not earn profits within 3 years of \nlisting. \n\n(vii) \n\nAcquisition  of  shares  by  the  investee  company  or  its  promoters  from  a  venture \nfund  is  exempt  from  the  provisions  of  the  takeover  code  and  will  therefore  not \nmandate an open offer. \n\n(viii)  Mutual funds may invest 5% of the corpus of an open-ended scheme and 10% of \n\nthe corpus of a closed-ended scheme in a venture fund. \n\n(ix) \n\nIn April 2004 the SEBI also removed some previous restrictions, allowing venture \nfunds  to  invest  in  real-estate  companies,  in  gold-financing  companies,  and  in \nequipment-leasing and hire\u2013purchase companies registered with the RBI. \n\n \n6. \nThese  regulations  significantly  improve  the  regulatory  environment  for  private  equity \nfunds  operating  in  India,  such  as  the  Infrastructure  Development  Finance  Company  (IDFC) \nPrivate Equity Fund II. In addition, they reflect a strong commitment by the Indian Government \nto support the provision of long-term equity finance to domestic entrepreneurial companies. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f1\n2\n \n \n \n \n \n \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n2\n \n\ni\n\nPERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR DEVELOPMENT OUTCOMES \n\n1. \n\nBusiness Performance (Fund) \n\nFinancial objectives \n\n(cid:131) Overall profitability of the Fund \n\nEconomic Sustainability (Fund and Subprojects) \n\n \nPerformance Measures  \n(Qualitative and/or Quantitative) \n\n(cid:131) Gross internal rate of return (database)a \n(cid:131) Net internal rate of return (database) \n\n \nImpact \n\n \nImpact \n\n \nPerformance Measures  \n(Qualitative and/or Quantitative) \n\n(cid:131) Annual net profit of subproject (database) \n(cid:131) Annual net revenue of subproject (database) \n\n \n\n(cid:131) Additional debt raised by subprojects as a result of the \n\nequity investments (database) \n \n\n \n \n(cid:131) Actual capacity utilization of infrastructure company once \n\noperations have started (PCR) \n\n \n(cid:131) Comparison of actual capacity utilization achieved by \neach infrastructure subproject with capacity utilization \noriginally targeted (PCR) \n\n(cid:131) Subproject economic \n\nperformance \n  \n\n(cid:131) Contribution to widening \ninfrastructure companies' \naccess to finance \n \n\n(cid:131) Positive externalities of the \nsubprojects in the targeted \nsectors, such as additional \nhandling volumes in ports, and \npassengers and cargo \ntransported through airports \n \n \n\nEfficient  allocation  of  finance  and/or  provision  of \nfinancial services to economically viable enterprises  \n\nAdditional  direct  contributions  of  subprojects  to  the \nlocal economy  \n\nPrivate Sector Development (Impact Beyond Fund and Subprojects) \n\n \nImpact \n\n \nPerformance Measures  \n(Qualitative and/or Quantitative) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nConcept \n\n \n2. \n\nConcept \n\n \n\n \n3. \n\nConcept \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fConcept \n\n \n\n \nImpact \n\nContribution \ninstitutions and financial market development  \n\nthe  growth  of  viable \n\nto \n\nfinancial \n\n     \n\n \n\n  \n\n \nPerformance Measures  \n(Qualitative and/or Quantitative) \n\n(cid:131) Induce financial institutions to \n\nprovide long-term equity to both \nIndian private equity funds and \nIndian infrastructure subprojects \nby demonstrating commercial \nviability  \n\n(cid:131) Number of Fund\u2019s investment professionals raising a \nsubsequent fund in financial sector of a DMC (PCR) \n\n(cid:131) Fund manager raising a subsequent fund (PCR) \n(cid:131) Enhanced future private sector funding for infrastructure \n\nsubprojects (PCR) \n\n(cid:131) Mobilized domestic finance for investments in \n\n(cid:131) Resource mobilization through \n\ninfrastructure companies by the Fund (at Fund closing) \n\n(cid:131) Mobilized international finance for investments in \n\ninfrastructure companies by the Fund (at Fund closing) \n(cid:131) Growth in private equity market in the domestic financial \n\nsector (PCR)  \n\n(cid:131) Increased access to long-term finance (PCR) \n\nprivate equity \n \n \n\n \n(cid:131) Growth in financial services in \nthe domestic financial marketsb \n \n \n\n \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, DMC = developing member country, IRR = internal rate of return, PCR = project completion report, SMEs = small and \nmedium enterprises. \na  Performance measures followed by \u201c(database)\u201d will be monitored regularly in the framework of the Private Sector Operations Department\u2019s database \n\nfor funds.
