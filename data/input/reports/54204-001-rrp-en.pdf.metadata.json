THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed equity \ninvestment of up to $25,000,000 in ATH International Venture Pte Limited (Singapore) (ATHIV) \nfor the Pacific Telecommunications Modernization Project in Papua New Guinea (PNG). \n \n2.  Amalgamated Telecom Holdings Limited (Fiji) (ATH), through its wholly owned special-\npurpose vehicle ATHIV, is raising equity to partially fund its $404.5 million telecommunication \nventure in PNG. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will be a cornerstone investor in ATHIV, \nand its $25 million equity investment will support the establishment of Vodafone PNG as a new \ntelecommunication operator that will provide increased and improved mobile, broadband, and \ninternet services in PNG. The provision of reliable and affordable telecommunication services will \nbenefit PNG\u2019s underserved population, leading to greater socioeconomic growth and poverty \nreduction. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n3.  Project identification. Universal access to telecommunication infrastructure is critical to \nany  country\u2019s  socioeconomic  development.  Increased  mobile and  internet  connections  can \n(i) improve access to domestic and regional markets for traders, manufacturers, and business \nowners; (ii) increase access to education, finance, telemedicine, and government services; and \n(iii) facilitate communication between rural and urban communities. PNG, with a population of 9.3 \nmillion, is the region\u2019s largest yet least-developed telecommunication market.1 PNG\u2019s internet \nprices are among the highest in the world, with 55% of internet services still connected to 2G, \nfollowed by 23% to 3G, and only 22% to 4G. The mobile penetration rate is 32% and internet \npenetration rate is 11% of the total population.2 Low penetration rates and high prices are a \nconsequence of low bandwidth capacity, underinvestment in technology, and lack of market \ncompetition that have resulted in pent up demand for affordable and quality mobile and data \nservices in PNG. \n \n4.  PNG\u2019s telecommunication market is presently serviced by two operators\u2014Digicel (PNG) \nLimited and Bemobile\u2013Telikom (Kumul Telikom Holdings)\u2014although Digicel\u2019s 92% mobile market \nshare  effectively  makes  it  a  quasi-monopoly  in  PNG  (footnote  2). 3  [CONFIDENTIAL \nINFORMATION DELETED] \n \n5.  Given the current state of PNG\u2019s telecommunication industry, the market is ripe for a \ndisruptive new entrant that can realize PNG\u2019s untapped potential and feed the latent demand for \nquality telecommunication services. Other factors supporting the entry of a new market participant \ninclude (i) a favorable regulatory regime that aims to promote market competition; (ii) strong \ndemand for high-speed data, especially from retail consumers and corporate enterprises in urban \ncenters; and (iii) increasing deployment of national and international fiber optic cables and \nsatellites such as Kacific5, Coral Sea Cable, and Kumul Submarine Cable that will provide high-\nspeed international bandwidth at much lower costs.  \n                                                \n1  Global System for Mobile Communication Association (GSMA). 2019.

ATH, with its telecommunication operations in six Pacific markets, has been conducting \nextensive due diligence on PNG\u2019s telecommunication industry since 2013, when it considered the \nacquisition of Bemobile.6 In 2018, ATH set up ATHIV in Singapore to raise capital for its new PNG \nventure.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n7.  Project description. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n10.  Investee and sponsor description. The investee, ATHIV, is a special-purpose vehicle \nset up by ATH to roll out its PNG venture. ATH, the project sponsor, pioneered 4G+ technology \nin Fiji and has extensive experience in the Pacific telecommunication market. ATH\u2019s recent \nregional telecommunication acquisitions include Kiribati Telecom Services (in 2015); Vanuatu \nTelecom (in 2017); BlueSky Group operations in Samoa, Cook Islands, and American Samoa (in \n2018 and 2019); and Digitec Communications Limited (in 2019). ATH is a publicly listed company \non the South Pacific Stock Exchange, with market capitalization of approximately $380 million (as \nof July 2020). While ATH is the project sponsor, the project will be managed by ATH\u2019s subsidiary, \nVodafone Fiji Limited\u2014Fiji\u2019s largest telecommunication operator which holds 81% of Fiji\u2019s mobile \nmarket.10 [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n12.  ADB  conducted  enhanced  tax  integrity  due  diligence.  ADB  obtained  reasonable \nassurances that relevant entities were not established or are being used for money laundering or \nterrorism financing in the project jurisdiction, and that the transaction is not being used for tax \nsecrecy, tax evasion, or tax fraud, with the tax integrity risks being low and acceptable. \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n13.  Impact. The project is aligned with the following impact: reach of modern and affordable \nICT across PNG improved. \n \n14.  Outcome.  The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:  penetration  of  high-quality, \nreliable, and affordable mobile telecommunication services in the country increased.16 \n \n15.  Outputs. The project has the following outputs: (i) telecommunication towers are installed, \n(ii) Vodafone PNG\u2019s 4G network rolled out, (iii) gender-inclusive local employment is generated, \n(iv) gender equality of Vodafone PNG product offering is enhanced, (v) Vodafone PNG becomes \na  more  gender-inclusive  work  environment,  and  (vi)  gender-inclusive  corporate  social \nresponsibility program is developed by Vodafone PNG. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n                                                \n6  Following PNG\u2019s 2011 constitutional crisis, Bemobile\u2019s financial and operating performance suffered greatly. In a \n\u201cWhite Knight\u201d rescue attempt, the Fiji National Provident Fund offered to acquire Bemobile in 2013. This offer was \nultimately rejected when Telikom PNG fully acquired Bemobile in 2015. In 2019, ADB and ATH commissioned two \nindependent consultants, Kitskoo and Gibson Quai International, to conduct market and technical due diligence for \nthe PNG venture. The results of their due diligence were submitted to ADB in January 2020. \n10 Amalgamated Telecom Holdings Limited and Subsidiary Companies. 2019. 2019 Annual Report.

ADB\u2019s Strategy 203017 recognizes the unique development challenges facing Pacific small \nisland developing states, including PNG, and has a special focus on increasing private sector \ninvestment in these countries. In line with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 and its country partnership \nstrategy for Papua New Guinea, 2016\u20132020,18 this project helps to improve livelihoods and \nenhance digital connectivity for the most poor and vulnerable sections of society, while also \nimproving PNG\u2019s business environment through private sector development. The project supports \noperational priority 1 (addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities) as it will generate \njobs for local people living in rural and urban areas in PNG. Job creation within local communities \nwill provide stable earnings and help to bridge inequality between rural and urban populations. \nThis project strongly supports operational priority 2 (accelerating progress in gender equality) as \nit increases economic empowerment of women through greater employment opportunities and \nimproved access to ICT infrastructure. Through the development of anti-sexual-harassment and \nfamily violence support policies at Vodafone PNG, this project aims to address some of the vital \nissues regarding gender-based violence in PNG.19 This regional project supports operational \npriority 7 (fostering regional cooperation and integration) as it expands regional investment \nbetween Pacific countries. This venture is a regional collaboration between Fijian entities and \ninstitutional investors from Samoa and PNG. The project builds on ADB\u2019s existing regional \ninitiatives, including the recently approved Asia\u2013Pacific Remote Broadband Internet Satellite \nProject (Kacific), which will complement Vodafone PNG\u2019s ability to provide low-cost internet \ncoverage to even the most remote locations on the island. \n \nD.

Projected Financial and Economic Performance \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n22.  Lessons from previous operations. This is ADB\u2019s third private sector project in PNG\u2019s \nICT subsector, demonstrating ADB\u2019s comprehensive approach towards  the development of \nPNG\u2019s telecommunication industry. In 2009, ADB provided an $18 million loan to Digicel, followed \nby loan and equity assistance to Bemobile in 2011. While the loan assistance to Digicel has been \nrated highly successful, with the borrower\u2019s business success and development performance \nbeing rated excellent, the Bemobile investment did not achieve the desired results, and thus offers \nvaluable lessons for this project. The key lessons from the Bemobile investment are as follows: \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n \n23.

ADB\u2019s $25 million equity will be funded from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources and will be \ninvested on pro-rata terms to acquire ordinary shares of ATHIV. [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION \nDELETED] \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n25.  Support the inclusive development of Papua New Guinea\u2019s telecommunication \nindustry. PNG\u2019s telecommunication industry is relatively undeveloped, with a vast majority of the \npopulation having little or no internet access. ADB\u2019s equity investment will provide crucial capital \nfor ATH\u2019s venture in PNG, which will deliver quality telecommunication services to the population. \nSuperior and affordable telecommunication services will not only facilitate greater communication \nwithin the country and region but also serve as a basic access tool for other sectors, such as \nhealth care, education, and finance.26 With ADB\u2019s shareholding in ATHIV, and with an ADB \nnominee on the ATHIV board of directors, ATH and Vodafone PNG will gain valuable insights into \nbest practices and lessons from ADB\u2019s previous projects in the PNG telecommunication industry \nand in other comparable markets in Asia. \n \n26.  Catalyze private sector financing for Papua New Guinea. Obtaining private sector \nfinance for PNG is challenging, but COVID-19 and the ensuing credit crunch complicated ATH\u2019s \ncapital raising. Thus, ADB\u2019s investment at this time is both compelling and pivotal. The signaling \neffect and increased market confidence from ADB\u2019s investment will greatly enhance ATH\u2019s ability \nto raise debt and equity for this project. Furthermore, ADB\u2019s role as cornerstone investor and \narranger for this transaction will be of significant value to all investors. ADB has selected top-\nnotch expertise for the market, technical, financial, legal, and environmental and social due \ndiligence aspects of this investment, which greatly benefits all shareholders. \n \n27.  Progress towards market-leading standards. As cornerstone investor, ADB will support \nVodafone PNG\u2019s adherence to high corporate governance and integrity standards, as well as the \nestablishment of market-leading social and environmental standards, with demonstration effects \nin the PNG telecommunication industry. Further, ADB will enhance gender inclusivity at Vodafone \nPNG by improving gender balance and opportunities for women in the workplace. \n \nC.

Manila. \n ", "6 \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n31.  The investment is a general corporate finance transaction under Appendix 4 of ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009). ADB has categorized the investment in compliance with \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement as follows: environment category B, involuntary resettlement \ncategory C, and indigenous peoples category B.29 This categorization is based on the potential \nenvironmental and social impacts of the company\u2019s existing and future telecommunication tower \nsites and project activities. \n \n32.  ADB has undertaken due diligence and reviewed the potential environmental and social \n(E&S) impact of the project and the measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for \nadverse impacts in the safeguard reports and plans.30 A corporate audit was undertaken by an \nexternal third party in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements. The \naudit comprised (i) a corporate audit of VFL\u2019s existing E&S  procedures (as the recognized chief \noperating entity of ATHIV) that will be implemented in PNG; (ii) an audit of Vodafone PNG\u2019s \nexisting E&S processes and procedures in the absence of an existing environmental and social \nmanagement system (ESMS), and implementation; and (iii) a review of compliance with national \nlaws of Vodafone PNG\u2019s identified existing procedures, sites, and facilities. \n \n33.  Audit findings and recommendations have been documented and agreed with ATHIV and \nVFL in a corrective action plan for the project. In line with the corrective action plan, Vodafone \nPNG will prepare an ESMS satisfactory to ADB requirements, building on existing Environmental \nand  Social  policies  and  procedures  of  Vodafone  PNG  and  VFL.  ATHIV  has  engaged  an \naccredited third-party consultant to undertake an initial environmental examination of the project \nand an environmental management framework plan and indigenous peoples plan to comply with \nADB\u2019s requirements and national regulations. The indigenous peoples plan will be disclosed prior \nto ADB\u2019s first disbursement, and customary landowners will be consulted in accordance with the \nplan before construction at each tower site. Vodafone PNG will strengthen its environmental and \nsocial capacity. It will report semiannually to ADB regarding compliance with the ESMS and ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement requirements. \n \n34.  Vodafone PNG will pay special attention to PNG\u2019s more than 800 ethnic groups, which \nhold customary ownership of about 97% of all land. There will be no involuntary land acquisition, \nand all tower locations will be leased. Any transaction involving customary land will go through a \nculturally sensitive negotiation and engagement process, following a protocol developed in line \nwith national regulations. Similarly, Vodafone PNG will develop a culturally sensitive grievance \nredress mechanism accessible to any affected indigenous peoples and customary landowning \ncommunities, including both men and women. The surrounding indigenous communities will be \nrecruited during project construction and will also benefit from a number of social development \nprograms implemented by Vodafone PNG through its corporate social responsibility program. \n \n35.  Effective gender mainstreaming. Following ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development, \nVodafone  PNG  has  incorporated  measures  to  promote  gender  equality  and  women\u2019s \nempowerment in its business activities.31 Digital gender gaps, gender-based income inequality, \nand gender-based violence are some of the crucial issues to be addressed in PNG.

ATHIV  and  its  subsidiary Vodafone  PNG  will  (i)  apply ADB's prohibited  investment \nactivities list, (ii) ensure that investments using ADB funds comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement and abide by national laws and regulations, and (iii) establish and maintain an \nappropriate ESMS satisfactory to ADB before disbursement. The ESMS will set out requirements, \nas  applicable,  for  compliance  with  national  labor  laws  and  measures  to  comply  with  the \ninternationally recognized core labor standards, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy \n(2001). The ESMS will also contain requirements, as applicable, for information disclosure and \nconsultation with affected people following ADB requirements. ATHIV will report regularly to ADB \nregarding (i) Vodafone PNG\u2019s compliance with such laws and (ii) the measures taken.33 \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n37.  ATHIV and its subsidiary Vodafone PNG were advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing \nbest international practice relating to combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing \nof terrorism. ADB will ensure that the investment documentation includes appropriate provisions \nprohibiting corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB in \nthe event of noncompliance. \n \nC.
