The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will be a cornerstone investor in ATHIV, \nand its $25 million equity investment will support the establishment of Vodafone PNG as a new \ntelecommunication  operator  that  will  provide  increased  and  improved  mobile,  broadband,  and \ninternet services in PNG. The provision of reliable and affordable telecommunication services will \nbenefit  PNG\u2019s  underserved  population,  leading  to  greater  socioeconomic  growth  and  poverty \nreduction. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nProject Identification and Description \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nProject identification. Universal access to telecommunication infrastructure is critical to \nany  country\u2019s  socioeconomic  development.  Increased  mobile  and  internet  connections  can \n(i) improve  access  to  domestic  and  regional  markets for  traders,  manufacturers,  and business \nowners; (ii) increase access to education, finance, telemedicine, and government services; and \n(iii) facilitate communication between rural and urban communities. PNG, with a population of 9.3 \nmillion,  is  the  region\u2019s  largest  yet  least-developed  telecommunication  market.1 PNG\u2019s  internet \nprices are among the highest in the world, with 55% of internet services still connected to 2G, \nfollowed by  23% to 3G, and only 22% to 4G. The mobile penetration  rate is 32%  and internet \npenetration  rate  is  11%  of  the  total  population.2 Low  penetration  rates  and  high  prices  are  a \nconsequence  of  low  bandwidth  capacity,  underinvestment  in  technology,  and  lack  of  market \ncompetition  that  have  resulted  in  pent  up  demand  for  affordable  and  quality  mobile  and  data \nservices in PNG. \n \nPNG\u2019s telecommunication market is presently serviced by two operators\u2014Digicel (PNG) \n4. \nLimited and Bemobile\u2013Telikom (Kumul Telikom Holdings)\u2014although Digicel\u2019s 92% mobile market \nshare  effectively  makes  it  a  quasi-monopoly  in  PNG  (footnote  2). 3  [CONFIDENTIAL \nINFORMATION DELETED] \n \n5. \nGiven  the  current  state  of  PNG\u2019s  telecommunication  industry,  the  market  is  ripe  for  a \ndisruptive new entrant that can realize PNG\u2019s untapped potential and feed the latent demand for \nquality telecommunication services. Other factors supporting the entry of a new market participant \ninclude  (i)  a  favorable  regulatory  regime  that  aims  to  promote  market  competition;  (ii)  strong \ndemand for high-speed data, especially from retail consumers and corporate enterprises in urban \ncenters;  and  (iii)  increasing  deployment  of  national  and  international  fiber  optic  cables  and \nsatellites such as Kacific5, Coral Sea Cable, and Kumul Submarine Cable that will provide high-\nspeed international bandwidth at much lower costs.  \n\n                                                \n1  Global  System  for  Mobile  Communication  Association  (GSMA).  2019.

The investee, ATHIV, is a special-purpose vehicle \n10. \nset up by ATH to roll out its PNG venture. ATH, the project sponsor, pioneered 4G+ technology \nin  Fiji  and  has  extensive  experience  in  the  Pacific  telecommunication  market.  ATH\u2019s  recent \nregional  telecommunication  acquisitions  include  Kiribati  Telecom  Services  (in  2015);  Vanuatu \nTelecom (in 2017); BlueSky Group operations in Samoa, Cook Islands, and American Samoa (in \n2018 and 2019); and Digitec Communications Limited (in 2019). ATH is a publicly listed company \non the South Pacific Stock Exchange, with market capitalization of approximately $380 million (as \nof July 2020). While ATH is the project sponsor, the project will be managed by ATH\u2019s subsidiary, \nVodafone Fiji Limited\u2014Fiji\u2019s largest telecommunication operator which holds 81% of Fiji\u2019s mobile \nmarket.10 [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n12. \nADB  conducted  enhanced  tax  integrity  due  diligence.  ADB  obtained  reasonable \nassurances that relevant entities were not established or are being used for money laundering or \nterrorism financing in the project jurisdiction,  and that the transaction is not being used for tax \nsecrecy, tax evasion, or tax fraud, with the tax integrity risks being low and acceptable. \n \nB. \n \n13. \nICT across PNG improved. \n \n14. \nreliable, and affordable mobile telecommunication services in the country increased.16 \n \nOutputs. The project has the following outputs: (i) telecommunication towers are installed, \n15. \n(ii) Vodafone PNG\u2019s 4G network rolled out, (iii) gender-inclusive local employment is generated, \n(iv) gender equality of Vodafone PNG product offering is enhanced, (v) Vodafone PNG becomes \na  more  gender-inclusive  work  environment,  and  (vi)  gender-inclusive  corporate  social \nresponsibility program is developed by Vodafone PNG. \n \nC. \n \n\nOutcome.

In  a \n\u201cWhite Knight\u201d rescue attempt, the Fiji National Provident Fund offered to acquire Bemobile in 2013. This offer was \nultimately rejected when Telikom PNG fully acquired Bemobile in 2015. In 2019, ADB and ATH commissioned two \nindependent consultants, Kitskoo and Gibson Quai International, to conduct market and technical due diligence for \nthe PNG venture. The results of their due diligence were submitted to ADB in January 2020. \n\n10 Amalgamated Telecom Holdings Limited and Subsidiary Companies. 2019. 2019 Annual Report.

In  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  and  its  country  partnership \nstrategy  for  Papua  New  Guinea,  2016\u20132020, 18 this  project  helps  to  improve  livelihoods  and \nenhance  digital  connectivity  for  the  most  poor  and  vulnerable  sections  of  society,  while  also \nimproving PNG\u2019s business environment through private sector development. The project supports \noperational priority 1 (addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities) as it will generate \njobs for local people living in rural and urban areas in PNG. Job creation within local communities \nwill provide stable earnings and help to bridge inequality between rural and urban populations. \nThis project strongly supports operational priority 2 (accelerating progress in gender equality) as \nit increases economic empowerment of women through  greater employment opportunities and \nimproved access to ICT infrastructure. Through the development of anti-sexual-harassment and \nfamily violence support policies at Vodafone PNG, this project aims to address some of the vital \nissues  regarding  gender-based  violence  in  PNG. 19 This  regional  project  supports  operational \npriority  7  (fostering  regional  cooperation  and  integration)  as  it  expands  regional  investment \nbetween  Pacific  countries.  This  venture  is  a  regional  collaboration between  Fijian entities  and \ninstitutional  investors  from  Samoa  and  PNG.  The  project  builds  on  ADB\u2019s  existing  regional \ninitiatives,  including  the  recently  approved  Asia\u2013Pacific  Remote  Broadband  Internet  Satellite \nProject  (Kacific),  which  will  complement  Vodafone  PNG\u2019s  ability  to  provide  low-cost  internet \ncoverage to even the most remote locations on the island. \n \nD. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nE. \n \n18. \n \n\nTable 2 summarizes the implementation arrangements.20 \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nAspects \nRegulatory \nframework \n\nManagement \n\nImplementation \nperiod \nEquity \ndisbursement \nConstruction \nand operations \narrangements \nPower supply \n\nTable 2: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \nThe  telecommunication  industry  in  Papua  New  Guinea  (PNG)  is  governed  by  an \nindependent  regulator,  the  National  Information  and  Communications  Technology \nAuthority  (NICTA),  with  additional  oversight  from  the  Independent  Consumer  and \nCompetition Commission, to ensure fair competition in the telecommunication industry. \nNICTA is responsible for issuing telecommunication licenses in PNG.  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \nVodafone  PNG  will  be  managed  by  the  operating  subsidiary  of  ATH\u2014Vodafone  Fiji \nLimited,  which  has  prior  experience  in  greenfield telecommunication  rollout in  Kiribati \nand other Pacific countries.

This is ADB\u2019s third private sector project in PNG\u2019s \nICT  subsector,  demonstrating  ADB\u2019s  comprehensive  approach  towards  the  development  of \nPNG\u2019s telecommunication industry. In 2009, ADB provided an $18 million loan to Digicel, followed \nby loan and equity assistance to Bemobile in 2011. While the loan assistance to Digicel has been \nrated  highly  successful,  with  the  borrower\u2019s  business  success  and  development  performance \nbeing rated excellent, the Bemobile investment did not achieve the desired results, and thus offers \nvaluable lessons for this project. The key lessons from the Bemobile investment are as follows: \n\nProjected Financial and Economic Performance \n\n \n\n \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n\nCOVID-19 Impact.  \n\n \n23. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n \nA. \n \nADB\u2019s $25 million equity will be funded from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources and will be \n24. \ninvested on pro-rata terms to acquire ordinary shares of ATHIV. [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION \nDELETED] \n \nB. \n \n25. \nSupport  the  inclusive  development  of  Papua  New  Guinea\u2019s  telecommunication \nindustry. PNG\u2019s telecommunication industry is relatively undeveloped, with a vast majority of the \npopulation having little or no internet access. ADB\u2019s equity investment will provide crucial capital \nfor ATH\u2019s venture in PNG, which will deliver quality telecommunication services to the population. \nSuperior and affordable telecommunication services will not only facilitate greater communication \nwithin  the  country and  region  but  also  serve  as a basic  access  tool for other  sectors,  such  as \nhealth  care,  education,  and  finance.26 With  ADB\u2019s  shareholding  in  ATHIV,  and  with  an  ADB \nnominee on the ATHIV board of directors, ATH and Vodafone PNG will gain valuable insights into \nbest practices and lessons from ADB\u2019s previous projects in the PNG telecommunication industry \nand in other comparable markets in Asia. \n \n26. \nCatalyze  private  sector  financing  for  Papua  New  Guinea.  Obtaining  private  sector \nfinance for PNG is challenging, but COVID-19 and the ensuing credit crunch complicated ATH\u2019s \ncapital raising. Thus, ADB\u2019s investment at this time is both compelling and pivotal. The signaling \neffect and increased market confidence from ADB\u2019s investment will greatly enhance ATH\u2019s ability \nto  raise debt and  equity for  this project.  Furthermore,  ADB\u2019s  role  as  cornerstone  investor  and \narranger for  this transaction  will  be  of  significant value  to all  investors.  ADB has  selected  top-\nnotch  expertise  for  the  market,  technical,  financial,  legal,  and  environmental  and  social  due \ndiligence aspects of this investment, which greatly benefits all shareholders. \n \n27. \nProgress towards market-leading standards. As cornerstone investor, ADB will support \nVodafone PNG\u2019s adherence to high corporate governance and integrity standards, as well as the \nestablishment of market-leading social and environmental standards, with demonstration effects \nin the PNG telecommunication industry. Further, ADB will enhance gender inclusivity at Vodafone \nPNG by improving gender balance and opportunities for women in the workplace. \n \nC. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nRisks \n\n                                                \n26 ADB. 2014.

ADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement as follows: environment category B, involuntary resettlement \ncategory C, and indigenous peoples category B.29 This categorization is based on the potential \nenvironmental and social impacts of the company\u2019s existing and future telecommunication tower \nsites and project activities. \n \n32. \nADB has undertaken due diligence and reviewed the potential environmental and social \n(E&S) impact of the project and the measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for \nadverse impacts in the safeguard reports and plans.30 A corporate audit was undertaken by an \nexternal  third  party  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  requirements.  The \naudit comprised (i) a corporate audit of VFL\u2019s existing E&S  procedures (as the recognized chief \noperating  entity  of  ATHIV)  that  will  be  implemented  in  PNG;  (ii)  an  audit  of  Vodafone  PNG\u2019s \nexisting E&S processes and procedures in the absence of an existing environmental and social \nmanagement system (ESMS), and implementation; and (iii) a review of compliance with national \nlaws of Vodafone PNG\u2019s identified existing procedures, sites, and facilities. \n \n33. \nAudit findings and recommendations have been documented and agreed with ATHIV and \nVFL in a corrective action plan for the project. In line with the  corrective action plan, Vodafone \nPNG will prepare an ESMS satisfactory to ADB requirements, building on existing Environmental \nand  Social  policies  and  procedures  of  Vodafone  PNG  and  VFL.  ATHIV  has  engaged  an \naccredited third-party consultant to undertake an initial environmental examination of the project \nand an environmental management framework plan and indigenous peoples plan to comply with \nADB\u2019s requirements and national regulations. The indigenous peoples plan will be disclosed prior \nto ADB\u2019s first disbursement, and customary landowners will be consulted in accordance with the \nplan before construction at each tower site. Vodafone PNG will strengthen its environmental and \nsocial capacity. It will report semiannually to ADB regarding compliance with the ESMS and ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement requirements. \n \n34. \nVodafone PNG will pay special attention to PNG\u2019s more than 800 ethnic groups, which \nhold customary ownership of about 97% of all land. There will be no involuntary land acquisition, \nand all tower locations will be leased. Any transaction involving customary land will go through a \nculturally sensitive negotiation and engagement process, following a protocol developed in line \nwith national regulations. Similarly, Vodafone PNG will develop a culturally sensitive grievance \nredress mechanism accessible to any affected indigenous  peoples and customary landowning \ncommunities, including both men and women. The surrounding indigenous communities will be \nrecruited during project construction and will also benefit from a number of social development \nprograms implemented by Vodafone PNG through its corporate social responsibility program. \n \nEffective gender mainstreaming.
