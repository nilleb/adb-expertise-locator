THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed results-\nbased  loan  to  the  Perusahaan  Listrik  Negara  (State  Electricity  Corporation)  [PLN],  to  be \nguaranteed by the Republic of Indonesia, for the Sustainable and Reliable Energy Access \nProgram\u2014Western and Central Java.1 The report also describes the proposed administration of \ntechnical assistance (TA) to be provided by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge \nPartnership Fund for Capacity Development in Emerging Technologies, and if the Board approves \nthe proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the \nadministration of the TA. \n \n2.  The program covers five provinces in the western and central parts of Java island\u2014\nBanten, Central Java, Jakarta Special Capital Region, West Java, and Yogyakarta Special \nRegion\u2014collectively home to 41% of Indonesia\u2019s 270 million people.2 The expected outcome is \nenhanced access to sustainable and reliable energy for the population in Western and Central \nJava. Three output results contribute to the outcome: (i) power grid rehabilitated, strengthened, \nand expanded; (ii) clean energy use promoted; and (iii) institutional capacity strengthened. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Strategic Context \n \n3.  Country context. Following the Asian financial crisis in 1998 and until 2019, Indonesia\u2019s \neconomy grew at an annual rate of 5% or more. The steady economic growth coupled with strong \npro-poor policies helped lift income levels and, with a gross national per capita income of $4,050, \nIndonesia became an upper middle-income country in 2020.3 However, the severe economic \ndisruption due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has caused the per capita gross \nnational income to decline to $3,870, and Indonesia was reclassified as a lower middle-income \ncountry in 2021. Indonesia\u2019s economy contracted by 2.1% in 2020, for the first time in 21 years. \nWith the onset of COVID-19, about 30 million workers were adversely affected in 2020 by \nreduction in working hours, suspension of employment, and job losses. Workers\u2019 wages fell by \n5.2%  year-over-year,  and  many  moved  back  to  agriculture,  a  reversal  in  the  structural \ntransformation of the economy. An additional 2.8 million people have fallen below the poverty line, \nwith poverty incidence increasing from 9.2% in 2019 to 10.2% in 2020, which reversed the \ntrajectory of declining poverty since 2006. The National Medium-Term Development Plan 2020\u2013\n2024 (RPJMN),4 in conjunction with COVID-19 recovery strategies being formulated by the \ngovernment, seeks to address these challenges in support of boosting the economy and reducing \npoverty. Sustainable infrastructure investments will be instrumental in supporting these objectives \nas they will help increase productive capacity, create employment, and lift economic growth rates, \nwhile strengthening Indonesia's resilience to withstand future climate risks. \n \n \n1  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided transaction TA.

Together with its subsidiaries, the PLN is responsible for sourcing and \ndelivering electricity to end users.5 PLN\u2019s Electricity Power Supply Business Plan (RUPTL), 2021\u2013\n2030,6 includes the following targets: near 100% electrification by 2022 and by 2030 increased \ngeneration  capacity  by  an  additional  40.6  gigawatts  (GW);  strengthened  transmission  and \ndistribution systems for reliable and sustainable electricity supply; expanded smart grid projects; \nand expanded clean energy use through electric vehicle charging infrastructure and rooftop solar \nphotovoltaic  systems.  As  part  of  the  Paris  Agreement,  Indonesia  committed  to  reducing \ngreenhouse gas emissions and increasing the use of renewable energy. The investment needs \nfor 2021\u20132030 for power generation, transmission, and distribution are $90.3 billion, of which \n$39.5 billion is to be financed by the private sector and $50.8 billion by the PLN. Cost recovery \nfor grid development is difficult given tariff affordability and long payback periods. Sovereign \nfunding support for electricity grid development lowers the PLN\u2019s cost of capital and improves \nfinancial viability to fulfil its public service obligations.  \n \n5.  The government is undertaking reforms in the sector, expanding private investment, \nimproving gender equality, continuing subsidy reform, and strengthening the PLN\u2019s governance \nand financial capacity.7 Within the PLN, reforms comprise five priority themes: (i) lean (efficiency \nand reliability, with digitalization of its major business processes including e-procurement), (ii) \ngreen (reducing dependence on fossil fuels and doubling the PLN\u2019s current 7.8 GW of renewable \nenergy capacity  by  2025),  (iii) innovation  (exploring  revenues  from  other  sources,  such  as \nelectricity sales to the e-mobility sector), (iv) gender (enhancing career pathways for women), and \n(v)  customer  focus  (specifically  on  enhanced  digital  payment  mechanisms  and  improved \ncommunication).8 The energy sector will be fundamental to the government\u2019s COVID-19 response \nand economic recovery program. Throughout the crisis, electricity supply has supported essential \nservices and maintained productivity under work-from-home arrangements. \n \n6.  ADB support. The programmatic support by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nIndonesia in the energy sector includes (i) policy, institutional, and regulatory support through \npolicy-based lending;9 (ii) comprehensive knowledge and capacity support, as well as special \ninitiatives;10 (iii)  a  results-based  lending  (RBL)  program  for  electricity  grid  strengthening  in \n \n5  Program Soundness Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) covers the role of the \nprivate sector in PLN operations. \n6  PLN. 2021.

Program Rationale \n \n7.  Focus on Java. Java dominates Indonesia\u2019s economy, contributing 59% of national gross \ndomestic product (GDP) in 2020. It hosts most manufacturing hubs and 62% of the country\u2019s \nmicro and small enterprises (MSEs) (footnote 2). Java has achieved the national goal of universal \nelectricity access; however, power quality issues, frequent interruptions, and electricity losses \nundermine its economic growth.13 Grid strengthening could have prevented the major blackouts \nexperienced in Western and Central Java, including Jakarta, in 2019 and 2020.14 To achieve \nsustained and higher economic growth, Java will require 259 terawatt-hours of electricity by 2030, \nor 66.4% of the country\u2019s total projected demand (footnote 4). Meeting this demand requires the \nstrengthening of Java\u2019s power grid, which will also support Indonesia\u2019s low-carbon transition with \nthe ability to integrate increased amounts of renewables into the grid. The program will finance a \nslice of the broader program in the RUPTL, 2021\u20132030 and enhance access to sustainable and \nreliable energy for the people in Western and Central Java.15 \n \n8.  Overall development impacts. The program area is home to 112.0 million people, \nincluding 9.6 million poor and another 21.0 million near the poverty line, and hosts 11.3 million \n(56.3%) of Indonesia\u2019s MSEs who employ 24.4 million (58.9%) of the country\u2019s MSE workforce.16 \nGreen energy investments supported by the program have estimated GDP output multipliers of \n1.1\u20131.5 compared to 0.5\u20130.6 for fossil fuel energy investments and improve job creation by a ratio \nof 3:1 compared to spending on fossil fuels.17 Through the delivery of affordable, sustainable, and \nreliable electricity, the program will support Java\u2019s economic recovery and transform its poorer \nareas into growth engines through agro-industries, tourism, and MSEs. \n \n9.  COVID-19 impact. As of October 2021, COVID-19 had led to more than 140,000 deaths \nin Indonesia.18 It has also affected the livelihood of about 30 million people through reduced work \n \n11 ADB. 2015.

These actions are expected to facilitate a \ngreen, inclusive, and resilient recovery. The program will address the risks from COVID-19 \nthrough (i) noncontact, digital, or social distancing strategies during training and community \noutreach programs; and (ii) stringent health and safety protocols during infrastructure work. \n \n10.  Contribution to the State Electricity Corporation\u2019s reforms. The program will support \nfour of the five PLN reform areas (para. 5): (i) innovation through technology and infrastructure \nupgrades  to  make  services  more  efficient  and  reliable,  including  e-procurement  and  other \ndigitalization efforts; (ii) financial management reforms; (iii) renewable generation expansion and \nthe promotion of clean energy use through electric vehicles; and (iv) enhancing career pathways \nfor female staff by prioritizing spaces in technical training programs. \n \n11.   Gender gaps in access, skills, jobs, and leadership in the sector. Women\u2019s labor \nforce participation has stagnated since 2020, reaching only 55% in 2020 as compared to 84% for \nmen.20 This differential is acute in the more technical professions. In 2018, women represented \nonly 12% of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics tertiary education graduates, and \nin the high-tech industry, only 14% of women employed held professional or technical positions \ncompared to 31% of men.21 To address this gender gap, state-owned enterprises such as the \nPLN are increasing the workforce opportunities for female staff by prioritizing spaces in technical \ntraining  programs  to  enhance  their  career  pathways.  Further,  state-owned  enterprises  are \nrecognizing the importance of engaging all users of their services (for the PLN, provision of \nenergy) in project outreach activities, acknowledging that previous female participation rate of \n20% was insufficient to respond to the broader needs and concerns of communities. \n \n12.  Modality. The RBL modality is suitable as it will (i) provide incentives for governance and \nefficiency reforms within the PLN\u2019s systems, (ii) reduce high transaction costs associated with \nscattered small investments, (iii) increase accountability for delivering and sustaining results, \n(iv) consolidate gains in the PLN\u2019s institutional strengthening from previous RBL programs (para. \n14), (v) provide incentives for clean and renewable energy initiatives, and (vi) leverage financing \nand improve development partner coordination. \n \n13.  Lessons learned. ADB has provided three RBL programs to date in the energy sector in \nIndonesia (footnote 11) and has captured a number of lessons based on its experience. The \nproposed fourth RBL program applies a number of relevant lessons, notably (i) avoiding past \nbottlenecks by focusing on disbursement-linked indicators (DLIs) that are within the PLN\u2019s own \ncontrol; (ii) involving all PLN stakeholders, including local units, in DLI development; and (iii) \nstrengthening capacity to ensure timely, accurate, and complete data reports. In addition, this \nprogram  benefited  from  previous  RBL  programs  in  expanding  support  to  institutional \nstrengthening, which has increased with successive programs but targeted different geographical \nregions.  For  example,  the  second  RBL  program  (Electricity  Grid  Development  Program) \n \n19 ADB. 2020.

Previous RBL programs also showed the importance of contextualizing each \nprogram component, given the diversity of Indonesia. The program will focus on issues pertinent \nto Java. \n \n14.  Value added by ADB. ADB was the first development partner in Indonesia to support \nenergy programs through the RBL modality, which has enabled close collaboration both with the \nPLN and other key development partners. ADB\u2019s support of multiple phases of the RBL programs \n(footnote 11) provides an opportunity to see progress made and assess the value addition of ADB \nsupport,  which  includes  (i)  gender  mainstreaming;24 (ii)  financial management reforms  and \ngovernance  support  with  actions  and  the  first-time  DLI  to  improve  financial  management; \n(iii) procurement audits and increased transparency, building on the gains from Electricity Grid \nDevelopment Program Phase 2 (footnote 22); (iv) renewable and clean energy reform support, \nincluding a new solar rooftop business model, increased electric vehicle infrastructure and sales, \ncontrol center upgrades to reflect increased integration of renewable energy, and capacity \nbuilding in renewable energy integration and battery storage; (v) system automation, drawing from \ninternational expertise; (vi) environmental safeguards system improvement; and (vii) disaster risk \nand climate change assessment to support the PLN\u2019s new climate change management unit in \nimproving grid resiliency. \n \n15.  Development partner coordination. ADB\u2019s RBL operations are well-coordinated with \nkey development partners.25 Previous RBL programs are cofinanced with the World Bank and \nGerman  development  cooperation  through  KfW  (footnote  11).  The  Asian  Infrastructure \nInvestment Bank is supporting the PLN\u2019s program in East Java and Bali to achieve full coverage \nof development partner support for Java island.26 The Government of Australia will support \nsafeguard and results monitoring capacity, building activities for efficient program implementation, \nthrough a subproject TA of ADB-administered Sustainable Infrastructure Assistance Program.27 \nADB is also collaborating with other development partners for potential cofinancing opportunities.  \n \n \n22 ADB. 2017.

The program is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 \nand contributes to six operational priorities.28 It is also aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy for Indonesia, 2020\u20132024, which emphasizes economic recovery through sustainable \nand resilient energy infrastructure,29 and is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, \n2021\u20132023.30 The program contributes to achieving Sustainable Development Goal 7 (affordable, \nreliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all) and Sustainable Development Goal 13 (climate \naction). \n \nC.  Program Scope \n \n17.  The PLN and ADB have agreed on an RBL program size of $1,411.0 million, of which the \nADB loan will finance $600.0 million. The difference between the broader government program \nand the RBL program is summarized in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Program Scope \nItem  Broader PLN Program  Results-Based Lending Program \nOutcome  Energy security enhanced  Access to sustainable and reliable \nenergy for the population in Western and \nCentral Java enhanced \nKey outputs  (i)  Power generation capacity increased.

Program Results \n \n18.  Impact and outcome. The RBL program\u2019s impact will be enhanced quality of life in \nIndonesian society through the provision of reliable electricity (footnote 6). The outcome will be \nenhanced access to sustainable and reliable energy for the population in Western and Central \nJava, with four outcome DLIs to measure program results. 31 Reliability will be measured by the \nSystem Average Interruption Frequency Index (DLI 1) and the reduction in the average duration \nof recovery per medium-voltage feeder line interruption (DLI 2). Clean energy use  will be \nmeasured  by  PLN  energy  sales  at  electricity  supply  and  electric  vehicle  charging  stations \n \n28 The six operational priorities are (i) poverty and inequality reduction (1.2, 1.3); (ii) gender equality and women\u2019s \nempowerment (2.1); (iii) climate change, climate and disaster resilience, and environmental sustainability (3.1, 3.3); \n(iv) more livable cities (4.1); (v) rural development and food security (5.1); and (vi) strengthened governance and \ninstitutional capacity (6.1, 6.2).

Output 1: Power grid rehabilitated, strengthened, and expanded. Progress toward \nthis output will be tracked by DLIs that monitor (i) the reconductoring (replacing the current \ncarrying conductors) of transmission lines and the rehabilitation and/or extension of medium-\nvoltage distribution lines (DLI 5); and (ii) the enhancement of power grid automation and other \nupgrades (DLI 6). DLI 6 will support the upgrading of the Java\u2013Bali load dispatch center to a \nmodern central transmission control center and the installation of remotely controlled distribution \nswitchgear. The program will also support a geographic information system-based integrated \ndistribution management system for assets, customer services, and operation and maintenance, \nand the expansion of an advanced electrical metering system. \n \n20.  Output 2: Clean energy use promoted. Output 2 will support the development of a new \nbusiness model to expand PLN-owned solar photovoltaic systems on rooftop space connected to \nthe PLN grid (DLI 7). An indicator not linked to disbursement will track the expansion of electricity \nsupply and electric vehicle charging stations. Output 2 will also support training for PLN staff \nnationwide, including female professionals, on emerging technologies, such as grid automation, \nelectric vehicle charging, and energy storage (DLI 8), with partial support from a TA grant (para. \n28). \n \n21.  Output 3: Institutional capacity strengthened. This output will (i) improve asset and \nwaste management through rehabilitating warehouses and constructing new hazardous waste \nstorage  facilities  to  meet  improved  health,  safety,  and  environmental  criteria  (DLI  9); \n(ii) strengthen the PLN\u2019s procurement system by expanding and monitoring the e-procurement \nand  systems,  applications,  and  products  in  data  processing  (enterprise  resource  planning \nsoftware integrated system) (DLI 10); and (iii) support the PLN to conduct consumer education \non safe and productive energy use through more inclusive outreach with at least 30% female \nparticipation (DLI 11). \n \n22.  Development and verification of indicators. The DLI targets and results chain were \ndeveloped in a year-long consultative process with experienced system planners in the PLN, \nbased on (i) the PLN\u2019s actual performance over the past period, (ii) RUPTL targets, (iii) the \ndifference that the RBL program\u2019s financing would bring to infrastructure upgrades and electricity \nreliability, and (iv) the impacts of COVID-19.34 The process ensured that the DLIs and other \nperformance indicators would provide ambitious yet achievable measures of progress toward the \noutputs and outcome, and that outputs were sufficient to achieve the outcome. All DLIs will be \nverified by an independent verification agent (IVA). Table 2 summarizes the DLIs and the share \nof ADB financing allocated to each. Following ADB\u2019s RBL modality, the allocation was based on \nthe relative importance of each DLI for the program outcome. \n \n \n32 Electric vehicle charging stations and electricity supply stations (typically used by street vendors for battery charging). \n33 Commercial and nontechnical losses are outside the PLN\u2019s control and are difficult to differentiate from total losses. \n34 Due to COVID-19 mobility restrictions, PLN\u2019s maintenance programs were severely impacted, with underinvestment \nexacerbating reliability concerns over the next 2\u20133 years.

Program financing. The PLN has requested a regular loan of $600 million from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources to help finance the program. The loan will have a 20-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per \nyear; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on the \nstraight-line method, the average maturity is 12.75 years, and there is no maturity premium \npayable to ADB. The ADB loan proceeds are not linked to any specific expenditure item but are \nan integral part of the program\u2019s overall financing plan. The financing plan for the broader PLN \nprogram and the RBL program is shown in Table 4. \n \nTable 4: Program Financing Plan \nAmount  Share of Total \nSource  ($ million)  (%) \nPLNa  811.0  57.5 \nADB     \nOrdinary capital resources (regular loan)   600.0  42.5 \nTotal  1,411.0  100.0 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, PLN = Perusahaan Listrik Negara (State Electricity Corporation).  \na  From PLN\u2019s internal cash flows, commercial funding partners, and equity injections from the government. \nSources: ADB and PLN. \n \n25.

The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook (2017,  as  amended from time  to  time)  and  detailed \narrangements agreed upon between the borrower and ADB. Disbursement (Table A3.3) will be \nmade subject to verification of evidence of achievement by the IVA, according to the verification \nprotocols. Loan proceeds will be disbursed to the PLN\u2019s general account with a commercial bank. \nIf a DLI target has not been fully achieved but partial disbursement has been agreed, ADB will \ndetermine the amount to be disbursed based on achievement. Disbursements will be made as \nspecified in the verification protocols for early or late achievement and in accordance with the \nverification protocols. Advance financing and financing for prior results will be available within the \n \n ", "10 \nRBL policy limits.35 No later than 6 months after program completion, the PLN will refund any \nadvance (or portions of advances) if the DLIs have not been fully met by program completion. \nTable A3.2 shows the prior results planned for DLIs 6 and 7. Advance financing will support the \ncapital expenditure required to achieve DLI targets in 2021\u20132022. \n \nF.  Capacity Development and Program Action Plan \n \n26.  The program action plan (PAP) will address the needs identified during assessments and \nstrengthen the PLN\u2019s capacity for achieving program results sustainably.36 The PAP includes \nactions in specific technical areas, monitoring and evaluation (M&E), fiduciary management, \ngender, and safeguards to complement the program\u2019s physical investments. \n \nG.  Technical Assistance \n \n27.  The TA will help strengthen the capacity of PLN staff nationwide (of which 23% will be \nwomen) in emerging technologies. The TA will support training on (i) power grid system planning \nand automation; and (ii) solar photovoltaic integration to grids, electric vehicle charging services, \nand utility-scale energy storage systems.37 The TA is estimated to cost $550,000, of which \n$500,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge \nPartnership Fund and administered by ADB. The PLN will provide support with counterpart staff, \noffice and workshop space, office supplies, secretarial assistance, local communication facilities, \nand other in-kind contributions. \n \nH.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n28.  The PLN is the executing agency. The implementation of the program will be undertaken \nby the PLN\u2019s regional offices and units, with oversight by PLN headquarters in Jakarta.38 A \nprogram management team established at the PLN, with the team lead nominated by the PLN, \nwill monitor and report on progress. An IVA will be engaged to conduct verification of program \nresults and PAP implementation.39 The program will be implemented from January 2021 to \nDecember 2025.40 \n \nIII.  SUMMARY OF ASSESSMENTS \n \nA.  Program Technical Assessments \n \n29.  Program soundness and results assessment. The technical assessment indicates a \nrobust program design and sound implementation arrangements with no major technical issues \nor concerns that will affect the DLIs.41 The results framework was considered, the DLIs are critical \n \n35  Up to 20% of the loan can be disbursed for agreed results achieved prior to the effective date but no earlier than 12 \nmonths before the signing of the loan agreement (financing for prior results) and up to 25% can be disbursed for \nadvance financing. The combined outstanding balance of advance financing and amount of financing for prior \nresults withdrawn should not exceed 30% of the total loan size. \n36  Program Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n37  Attached Technical Assistance Report: Capacity Development in Emerging Technologies (accessible from the list \nof linked documents in Appendix 2). \n38  Key PLN divisions in headquarters have developed good capacity to plan and manage RBL programs because of \ntheir experience with ADB\u2019s three earlier RBL programs (footnote 11) and the World Bank\u2019s Program-for-Results \nfor Sumatra. \n39  ADB will conduct an open competitive bidding process. \n40  Program Implementation Document (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n41  Program Soundness Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "11 \nindicators  for  achieving  RBL  program results, the  M&E  system  is fit for  purpose,  and the \nexpenditure framework and financing plan are robust. The program will enhance the reliability of \nelectricity  supply,  especially  in  areas  prone  to  lower  power  quality  and  interruptions.  The \nprogram\u2019s support for a centralized control center and advanced automation systems would \nfurther improve transmission grid stability, while improving distribution automation systems would \nreduce the frequency and duration of outages. Specific mitigation measures to minimize technical \nissues will be addressed through the PAP. \n \n30.  Central Java is among the top three provinces with the highest potential for rooftop solar \non residential buildings.42 The program supports the development of a new business model to \nincrease rooftop solar photovoltaic uptake as a low-carbon solution that is technically simple and \ncost-effective. The program also supports the continued rollout of the PLN\u2019s electric charging and \nelectric vehicle infrastructure. In summary, the PLN's plan to develop the power systems in \nWestern and Central Java is strongly justified and operationally  viable and is expected to \n(i) improve service quality and reliability, (ii) expand access to electricity for households and \nbusinesses in line with growing demand, (iii) promote renewable energy use, and (iv) promote \nclean energy use for transport. \n \n31.  Poverty reduction. The program is expected to expand livelihood options, reduce income \npoverty, reduce time poverty, and promote the expansion of MSEs (paras. 8 and 9). About 9.1 \nmillion poor households, including 1.8 million poor households headed by women, will benefit \nfrom having access to reliable electricity and expanded livelihood opportunities. \n \n32.  Gender. The program is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. The program \nproposes to bring time savings to women and girls, who carry the burden of household drudgery \nand responsibilities, while improving their potential to engage in productive energy-reliant income-\ngenerating activities. In the program provinces, women\u2019s median earnings range from 29.9% \n(West Java) to 40.9% (Yogyakarta Special Region) of the median male earnings.43 In 2016, small \nand  medium-sized  enterprises  headed  by  women  contributed  9.1%  of  GDP.44 Formalizing \nelectrical  connections  in  urban  poor  areas  will  make  households  headed  by  women  less \nvulnerable to exploitation. Improved access to electricity will improve household health outcomes \nby minimizing air pollution and fire risks and stimulate increased participation of MSEs owned by \nwomen, thereby contributing to addressing the gender gap in income poverty.45 This program will \nalso address the non-income dimensions of poverty, such as time poverty, irregular water supply, \nand suboptimal public health facilities, by providing a reliable electricity supply. In addition, the \nprogram  is  supporting female  professionals  in the  PLN  to  increase  and  demonstrate their \nknowledge and application of new technologies through prioritizing 23% of training opportunities \nfor female staff (DLI 8).46 This will improve women\u2019s job skills, incomes, and career options, and \nsupport men and women to improve livelihood opportunities by building their knowledge and \nunderstanding of safe and productive energy use (with a minimum participation rate of 30% for \n \n42  Based on the Institute for Essential Services Reform\u2019s technical calculation for 34 provinces in Indonesia.

Through prioritizing \n23% female participation in training on new technologies, female professionals within the PLN will be better \nequipped to compete for promotions, including leadership roles. \n \n ", "12 \nwomen) (DLI 11). These actions will be further entrenched through the PAP's commitment to \nsupport the institutionalization of gender mainstreaming within the PLN.47 \n \nB.  Program Systems Assessments \n \n33.  Monitoring and evaluation systems. The M&E systems assessment conducted for this \nRBL built on earlier assessments. The PLN\u2019s M&E system has the capacity to track all DLIs and \nother indicators and report regularly on these and involve stakeholders in the process. The PLN\u2019s \nmanagement reporting information system already monitors some DLIs.48 \n \n34.  Fiduciary systems. The program will use the PLN\u2019s fiduciary systems for financial \nmanagement, procurement, and audit. An assessment of the systems to determine their ability to \nmanage fiduciary risks showed that they provide reasonable assurance that the RBL program \nfunds will be used as intended, with due consideration for economy and efficiency. \n \n35.  Financial management. A financial management assessment was concluded in 2021, \nwith  reference  to  ADB  guidance  on  financial  management.  The  previous  RBL  financial \nmanagement risk assessments conducted in 2015, 2018, and 2020 assessed the PLN\u2019s overall \nfinancial  management  risk  moderate.  The  financial  management  assessment  for  the  RBL \nprogram indicates that the moderate rating is still valid. The main deficiencies and risks in the \nPLN\u2019s financial management systems will be addressed through activities under the PAP. \n \n36.  Procurement  system.  A  procurement  assessment  conducted  during  2020\u20132021 \nconfirmed PLN\u2019s procurement practices to be aligned with previous findings, and the overall \nprocurement framework is considered appropriate for program implementation. The RBL program \nwill rely on the PLN\u2019s systems and will exclude high-value contracts in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nRBL policy. PLN regional offices and units (PLN transmission offices and PLN distribution offices) \nissue purchase orders under a framework contract established by PLN headquarters and conduct \nthe procurement of works and installation services. A key lesson from the ongoing RBL programs \nis the low level of utilization of the procurement and contract monitoring application, despite its \nwide availability. The program addresses these through DLI 10. For the RBL program, the PLN \nhas agreed to undertake internal procurement audits of 10% of all contracts each year.  \n \n37.  Integrity  due  diligence  was  conducted  on  the  PLN,  the  members  of  its  board  of \ncommissioners, and its board of directors, and no significant or potentially significant integrity risks \nwere detected.49 Guidelines to prevent or mitigate fraud, corruption, and other prohibited activities \nin results-based lending for programs were explained to and discussed with the government and \nthe PLN.50 \n \n38.  Safeguard systems. The program safeguard systems currently in place at the PLN are \nbroadly aligned with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The PLN has established a \ncomprehensive system of guidelines and decrees that supplements the national regulatory \nframework  for  environmental  and  social  safeguards.  The  program  safeguard  systems \nassessment drew on previous assessments for prior RBL programs (footnote 11); field visits; and \nconsultations with various PLN offices, government and nongovernment institutions in Jakarta, \nBanten, West Java, and Central Java, and a number of affected people and indigenous peoples \n \n47  Program Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n48  Monitoring and Evaluation Systems Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n49  ADB. 2003.

Environment safeguards. The program is categorized B for environmental safeguards, \nas eligible activities are anticipated to have minor, site-specific, and reversible impacts during \nconstruction.  Activities  that  would  be  classified  category  A  for  environment  as  per  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009), or those specified in the 2019 regulation issued by the \nMinistry of Environment and Forestry (MOEF), are not eligible under the RBL program and will be \nexcluded during the screening of annual work plans.53 The PLN will develop standard operating \nprocedures on management of waste and materials, with targets that follow MOEF regulations \nand guidelines.54 \n \n40.  Climate change assessment. The program climate risk is assessed medium.55 ADB will \nsupport the PLN to assess the vulnerability of the PLN\u2019s existing and planned power grid network \nto climate and geophysical hazards in Western and Central Java. Climate mitigation is estimated \nto cost $94.5 million and climate adaptation is estimated to cost $29.3 million. ADB will finance \n100% of mitigation and adaptation costs. \n \n41.  Social safeguards. The program safeguard systems assessment identified gaps in the \nPLN\u2019s institutional capacity and conduct of social safeguards systems,56 which will be addressed \nthrough the PAP. The safeguards category of this program is B for both involuntary resettlement \nand indigenous peoples. For involuntary resettlement, land required for program activities is \nexpected to be minimal with no physical displacement. There will be no relocation of indigenous \npeoples, and the impacts on indigenous peoples communities are minimal, if encountered at all.57 \nScreening for both involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples will be conducted rigorously \nto exclude category A activities. The safeguard program actions include measures to strengthen \nmeaningful consultations, grievance redress mechanisms, the screening process, record-keeping \nof negotiated land settlement, monitoring, and programs for indigenous peoples on enhancing \naccess to and awareness of electricity. \n \nC.
