This will be achieved by \nsaving energy, increasing capacity, deferring distribution capacity \nexpansion  by  distribution  network  rehabilitation,  and  reducing \nlighting  by  residential \npeak  demand \ncustomers.  \n \nThe efficient lighting program will pilot the use of 500,000 compact \nfluorescent  lamps  (CFLs)  and  light-emitting  diodes  (LEDs)  in \nselected isolated and islands grids.  \n \nIndonesia  ranks  among  the  top  20  polluters  in  the  world.  The \ncountry's CO2 emissions per capita have grown significantly since \nthe  1980s,  a  large  part  of  which  is  from  the  burning  of  oil. \nEmissions  will  get  worse  in  the  short  term,  as  the  Government \nplans  to  rapidly  expand  the  use  of  coal  for  power  generation  to \nreduce its reliance on imported oil.  \n \nThe  Government's  energy  conservation  and  energy  efficiency \ninitiatives  will  offset  part  of  these  emissions,  and  these  efforts \nneed to be part of mainstream planning to have larger impact. PT \n(Persero) Perusahaan Listrik Negara (State Electricity Corporation \n[PLN]),  the  state-owned  power  utility,  has  invested  in  energy \nefficiency  projects  for  its  power  distribution,  which  has  reduced \noverall  distribution  losses  and  CO2  emissions.  To  maintain  the \nmomentum, PLN has an ambitious plan to invest about $1.2 billion \nin  distribution  between  2010  and  2014.  A  large  part  of  this  plan \nwill be financed by internal resources, and loans from bilateral and \nmultilateral partners.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  engage  with  PLN  in  its \noverall energy efficiency improvement initiative, with the proposed \nsmall  Project  covering \nthe  entire  Java\u2013Bali  network  with \ncofinancing from the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD). \nThe proposed project components could be implemented within 2 \nyears.  If  the  proposed  Project  and  the  partnership  in  financing  is \nsuccessful, ADB will scale up this operation with a sector project \n(using a multitranche financing facility) and support part of PLN's \nfinancing needs for the energy efficiency strategy.  \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  objective  is  to  reduce  the  peak  load  demand  and \nsystem  losses  by  implementing  distribution  network  rehabilitation \nand  an  efficient  lighting  program  that  will  also  contribute  towards \ngreenhouse gas reduction. Carbon credits will be sought following \nthe  approved  methodology  of \nthe  Clean  Development \nMechanism\u2019s  (CDM)  executive  board.  This  investment  is  in  line \nwith  ADB's  commitment  to  clean  energy  and  energy  efficiency \nacross Asia.  \n \nAbout  200  megawatts  (MW)  equivalent  in  distribution  system \ncapacity will be freed and about 400 gigawatt-hours (GWh) will be \nsaved annually through energy efficiency at a cost well below the \ncost  of  developing  equivalent  new  capacity.  This  will  reduce  the \nemissions  of  Indonesia's  power  sector  by  about  330,000  tons  (t) \neach year.   \n \nThe impact of the proposed Project will be reduced CO2 emissions \nby the power sector. The outcome of the Project is to contribute to \nPLN's  overall  power  distribution  efficiency  and  quality  of  power \nsupply.  \n \nThe investment cost of the Project is estimated at $120.0 million, \nincluding  physical  and  price  contingencies,  interest  and  other \ncharges  during  implementation,  and  taxes  and  duties  of  $9.0 \nmillion. \n \nA loan of $50,000,000 from the ordinary capital resources of ADB \nwill be provided to the Republic of Indonesia under ADB's London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will \nhave  a  25-year  term  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an \ninterest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB's  LIBOR-based \nlending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  annum,  and \nsuch  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and \nproject agreements. AFD will cofinance the Project in the amount \nof $50 million. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace \nperiod  of  5  years,  and  an  interest  rate  in  LIBOR  equivalent  to  a \nEuro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR)-flat rate and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\fiii \n\nloan \n\nthe  AFD \n\nA  cofinancing  agreement  will  be  entered  into  by  ADB  and  AFD \nunder  which  the  parties  will  jointly  finance  the  investment  costs. \nADB  will  administer \nincluding  procurement, \nrecruitment  of  consultants,  and  disbursement,  according  to  the \ncofinancing agreement to be signed. \n \nA  grant  from  the  Clean  Energy  Fund  under  the  Clean  Energy \nFinancing  Partnership  Facility  will  be  provided  to  PLN  in  the \namount of $1.0 million equivalent to be administered by ADB.  \n \nPLN  will  finance  $19.0  million  of  the  Project  costs,  including  all \nlocal taxes and duties.  \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nAFD a \n\nMulti-Donor Clean Energy Fund \nunder the Clean Energy Financing \nPartnership Facilityb \n\nPT (Persero) Perusahaan Listrik \nNegara \n\nTotal \n\nTotal \n50.0 \n50.0 \n \n \n \n1.0 \n \n19.0 \n120.0 \n\n% \n41.67 \n41.67 \n   \n \n \n0.83 \n \n15.83 \n100% \n\na Agence Francaise de D\u00e9veloppement. \nb Established by the governments of Australia, Norway, Spain, and \nSweden; and administered by ADB. \n\n         Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nUnder  a  subsidiary  loan  agreement  that  will  be  on  terms  and \nconditions  satisfactory  to  ADB  and  AFD,  the  Government  will \nrelend to PLN the proceeds of the ADB and AFD loans.  \n \nNovember 2012 \n \nMay 2012 \n\n \nPLN will be the executing agency and has overall responsibility for \nthe  implementation  of  the  Project.

The \nretroactive  financing  for  goods  will  cover  the  12  months  prior  to \nthe date of the loan agreement with a ceiling of $5 million, or 10% \nof the ADB loan amount. The Government was advised that ADB \napproval  of  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  does \nnot  commit  ADB  to  approve  the  proposed  loan  and  that  ADB \nfinancing  will  be  dependent  upon  the  Government's  compliance \nwith  all  aspects  of  ADB's  procedural  requirements,  including \ncompliance with the relevant provisions of the loan agreement and \nADB's guidelines. \n \nAll  procurement  to  be  financed  under  the  ADB  and  AFD  loans \nand  CEF  Grant  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time), \nand the procurement plan prepared and agreed upon between the \nGovernment  and  ADB.  Ten  contract  packages  will  be  procured \nunder  the  Project  through  either  international  competitive  bidding \nor national competitive bidding. Equipment for the pilot project for \nefficient  lighting  will  be  procured  though  limited  international \nbidding.  \n \nConsultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  under  the  Project  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). An international consulting \nfirm  will  be  engaged  to  manage  implementation  of  the  Project. \nThe firm will deliver 105 person-months of consulting services (15 \nperson-months of international and 90 person-months of national \nconsulting)  following  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and  cost-based  selection \nmethod  and  using  full  technical  proposal.  Individual  consultants \nwill  deliver  18  person-months  of  consulting  services  (6  person-\nmonths  of \ninternational  and  12  person-months  of  national \nconsulting)  for  implementation  of  the  pilot  project  for  efficient \nlighting.  \n \nThe  Project  will  reduce  the  power  sector's  CO2  emissions  by \n330,000 t per year. It will also support registration of the proposed \nProject  with  the  regulatory  authorities  to  capture  the  value  of  the \navoided emissions as cash flows under the CDM. The value of the \navoided CO2 emissions will be around $3.5 million each year. \n  \nThe  proposed  Project  will  improve  the  efficiency  of  power \ndistribution in all of its five regions on the islands of Java and Bali. \nPLN will save energy by reducing its distribution losses and at the \nsame  time  improve  power  supply  voltage  to  its  feeders  in  west, \ncentral, and east Java. \n \n \n\n\fRisks and Assumptions \n\nv \n\n \n \nOverall,  about  400  GWh  of  electricity  will  be  saved  annually\u2014\nabout  100  GWh  in  Jakarta,  40  GWh  in  central  Java,  50  GWh  in \nwest Java, 180 GWh in east Java, and 30 GWh in Bali. The value \nof  the  400  GWh  of  saved  power  (assuming  a  marginal  cost  of \n$0.15 per kilowatt-hour) is about $60 million each year. \n \nAbout  200  MW  of  equivalent  distribution  system  capacity  will  be \nfreed  and,  using  the  saved  energy,  PLN  will  be  able  to  connect \nabout 1.2 million additional customers to the Java\u2013Bali network.  \n \nThis  Project  involves  no  new  technology  and  PLN  has  all  the \nnecessary skills to design and implement the project components, \nhence  risks  related  to  design  and  implementation  are  low. \nShortage  of  power  generation  in  the  system  is  another  risk,  as \ndistribution  investment  alone  will  not  improve  power  supply \nreliability and quality unless there is sufficient power to distribute. \nHowever,  PLN's  efforts  in  mobilizing  financing  from  both  internal \nand external resources is showing results as about 2,500 MW of \nadditional  generation  capacity  in  Java  will  be  commissioned \nbetween 2010 and 2012.  \n \nPLN  has  also  identified  a  range  of  specific  risks:  (i)  stronger \ngrowth  in  electricity  demand,  resulting  in  overuse  of  existing \nequipment  (reducing  its  lifespan);  (ii)  a  worsening  financial \nsituation,  if revenues  are  lower  than  expected because  of delays \nin  the  payment  of  subsidies  by  the  Government;  and  (iii) \ninsufficient  investment  from  independent  power  producers  (IPPs) \ndelaying  the  much-needed  investments  in  generation.  PLN  has \ndeveloped a range of mitigation measures to address these risks, \nsuch  as  (i)  planned  investments  to  rehabilitate  and  optimize  the \ndistribution  network  to  reduce  overloading  and  promote  demand-\nside  management  to  reduce  demand,  (ii)  arrangements  to  raise \ncapital from the domestic market and through borrowings (bilateral \nand multilateral lenders) so that investments can be implemented \nin a timely manner, and (iii) introduction of higher tariffs and terms \nto  secure  primary  energy \nlong-term \ncontracts, etc. \n\nrequirements \n\nthrough \n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nloan  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia,  (ii)  proposed  administration  of  a  loan  to  be  provided  by \nAgence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement  (AFD)  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia,  and  (iii)  proposed \nadministration  of  a  grant  to  be  provided  by  the  Clean  Energy  Fund  under  the  Clean  Energy \nFinancing  Partnership  Facility  to  PT  (Persero)  Perusahaan  Listrik  Negara,  for  the  Java\u2013Bali \nElectricity Distribution Performance Improvement Project. The design and monitoring framework \nis in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nIndonesia  ranks  among  the  top  20  polluters  in  the  world.  The  country's  carbon  dioxide \n2. \n(CO2)  emissions  per  capita  have  grown  significantly  since  the  1980s,  a  large  part  of  which  is \ndue to the burning of oil. As a strategy to reduce its reliance on imported oil, the Government \nplans to rapidly expand the use of coal for power generation, which will increase CO2 emissions \nfrom  the  power  sector.  At  the  same  time,  the  Government  has  taken  initiatives  to  implement \nenergy  conservation  and  energy  efficiency  policies  to  reduce  emissions.  PT  (Persero) \nPerusahaan  Listrik  Negara  (State  Electricity  Corporation  [PLN]),  the  state-owned  power  utility, \nhas  invested  in  energy  efficiency  projects  for  power  distribution,  which  has  reduced  overall \ndistribution losses and CO2 emissions. PLN has an ambitious plan to invest about $1.2 billion in \nthe  distribution  sector  between  2010  and  2014  to  further  reduce  distribution  losses  and  CO2 \nemissions.  A  large  part  of  this  plan  will  be  financed  by  loans  from  bilateral  and  multilateral \npartners.  \n \n3. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  engage  with  PLN  in  its  energy  efficiency \nimprovement  initiative,  with  the  proposed  small  Project  covering  the  entire  Java\u2013Bali  network \nwith  cofinancing  from  AFD.  If  the  proposed  Project  and  the  partnership  in  financing  are \nsuccessful, ADB will scale up this operation with a sector project (using a multitranche financing \nfacility)  and  support  PLN's  financing  needs  for  pursuing  its  energy  efficiency  strategy.  This \ninvestment  will  supplement  ADB  ongoing  policy  work  in  the  power  sector,  and  will  reduce \nenergy  sector  emission  by  reducing  distribution  losses,  promoting  energy  efficient  lighting \nalternatives to customers, and making customers aware of energy efficiency measures.  \n \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nGeographically Indonesia is unique with its huge number of islands and vast coastlines. \n4. \nAbout  65%  of  the  population  of  Java  island  lives  in  coastal  regions,  and  they  are  therefore \nvulnerable to the effects of sea-level rise. Indonesian islands are vulnerable to earthquakes and \nhigh waves because of their geographic location\u2014between two shelves of the Asian landmass \nand  the  combined  Australian  and  New  Guinean  landmass.  Indonesia's  forest  areas  are  also \nprone to natural disasters, and events such as volcanic and tectonic earthquakes and tsunamis \nare fairly common. In addition, the islands are subject to extreme weather events, such as long \ndry  seasons  and  floods.  According  to  the  International  Disaster  Database  (2007), 1  the  10 \nbiggest natural disasters in Indonesia in the last 100 years took place after 1990, and most of \nthese  disasters  were  weather-related:  flood,  drought,  forest  fire,  and  increase  of  endemic \ndiseases. The Government estimates that the economic losses from the 10 biggest disasters to \nbe about $26 billion, of which around 70% is climate related. \n\n                                                 \n1    Centre  for  Research  on  the  Epidemiology  of  Disasters  (CRED).  2007.  The  International  Disaster  Database. \n\nAvailable: http://www.emdat.be/ \n\n\f  \n\n2 \n \n\nAs  Indonesia  is  vulnerable  to  the  threat  of  climate  change,  the  Government  plans  to \n5. \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector, and from land use, land-use change, \nand  forestry.  Indonesia ratified  the United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change \nthrough  Act  No.6  in  1994,  and  ratified  the  Kyoto  Protocol  through  Act  No.  17  in  2004.  It  also \nplans to invest in carbon sequestration activities. The Government plans to work with its bilateral \nand multilateral partners to tackle the threat of climate change. \n \nAccording to the World Resource Institute's publication2 in 2007, Indonesia\u2019s emissions \n6. \nper  capita  have  grown  by  about  150%  since  the  1980s,  and  by  about  67%  since  the  1990s. \nAbout 56.5% of annual CO2 emission is from oil burning, 35% is from coal, and 18.5% is from \ngas.  Estimates  for  annual  emissions  vary  from  250  million  tons  (t)  to  280  million  t.  The  power \nsector is a major emitter, and this will increase further with the Government's plan to expand the \nuse of coal for power generation. \n \nAccording  to  a  Government  study,3 if  no  effort  is  made  to  reduce  emissions,  total  CO2 \n 7. \nemissions from the energy sector could reach 1,200 million t by 2025. The Government could \nsignificantly reduce these emissions using three simple strategies: (i) energy diversification, (ii) \nenergy conservation; and (iii) implementation of clean technology. The immediate solutions are \nincreased  use  of  renewable  energy,  energy  efficiency,  and  conservation.  According  to  the \nNational  Energy  Conservation  Master  Plan 4 ,  Indonesia  could  save  about  10%\u201330%  of  its \nenergy  demand  through  conservation  and  efficiency  measures.  A  detailed  analysis  of  climate \nchange issues and overall emissions in Indonesia is discussed in Appendix 2. \n \n8. \nDespite  the  Government's  plan  to  diversify  energy  resources  and  mainstream  energy \nefficiency,  it  is  compelled  to  build  more  coal-fired  power  stations  to  meet  immediate  energy \ndemands. These short-term decisions are prompted by the many problems faced by the power \nsector, some of which are discussed in section B.  \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nKey Problems and Constraints  \n\na. \n\nGrowing Power Demand, Supply Shortage, and Lack of Investment \n\n9. \nIndonesian electricity demand is growing rapidly; demand growth peaked at about 16% \nper  annum  during  1994\u20131995,  with  a  maximum  demand  of  about  12,800  megawatts  (MW)  in \n1997.  This  demand  was  met  by  power  purchase  contracts  with  independent  power  producers \n(IPPs); most contracts were 30-year \"take-or-pay\"5 agreements in dollars. When demand growth \nslowed  in  1997,  these  take-or-pay  obligations  led  PLN  into  a  severe  financial  crisis  and,  as  a \nresult, investments in the power sector fell considerably. New investments have not kept pace \nwith  the  growing  demand  for  electricity;  since  2001,  electricity  sales  have  grown  by  about  7% \nand  the  peak  demand  by  6%,  but  during  the  same  period  PLN\u2019s  power  system  grew  by  less \nthan half of that amount\u2014the transmission network grew by 3.2%, the distribution network grew \nby 1.7%, and new generation capacity grew by 1.4%. Distribution rehabilitations were delayed. \nThe  deferral  of  rehabilitation  has  no  immediate  impact  on  the  distribution  system  but  as \ninvestments are delayed (due to budget shortfall), the distribution systems were overloaded and \n                                                 \n2 Climate Analysis Indicators Tool (CAIT).

Because of lack of investments in the power sector, the main islands of Java \nand  Bali  are  experiencing  power  outages.  With  the  high  demand,  the  system  reserve  margin \nhas become smaller, causing frequent load shedding with blackouts lasting for 2\u20133 hours each \nday. In December 2008, the maximum system demand was 15,570 MW (compared with 16,300 \nMW  in  2007)  in  the  Java\u2013Bali  grid  and  during  the  same  month  PLN  had  to  shed  between  80 \nMW and 860 MW every day from the peak demand. Detailed analysis of the power sector is in \nAppendix 3.  \n \n\nb. \n\nDependency on Oil and High Cost of Power \n\n10. \nOil is one of the most expensive fuels for power generation. As more than 30% of power \ngeneration in Indonesia is based on either diesel or fuel oil, the cost of power generation is high. \nIn 2008, PLN's average cost of production was $0.13 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), while the cost of \npower generation in neighboring countries was between $0.03/kWh6 and $0.11/kWh. Since PLN \nis  fully  exposed  to  the  international  market  price  of  oil,  its  reliance  on  oil  also  creates  large \nfluctuations in its power generation cost, while the tariff remains fixed.  \n \n\nc. \n\nLack of Incentives and Policy Support for Renewable Energy \n\n11. \nIndonesia  has  great  potential  for  renewable  energy,  especially  hydro  and  geothermal. \nSolar technologies are becoming more attractive in Indonesia as price of solar panels has come \ndown and panel efficiencies have improved. In addition, there is scope for low-carbon emission \nenergy sources based on coal seam methane and coal mine methane. These sources improve \nenergy security as they are not exposed to international supply or pricing risks. The Government \nhas  to  provide  direct  incentives  for  renewable  energy  development,  so  that  in  isolated  off-grid \nareas  and  in  remote  islands,  small-scale  renewable  energy  generation  could  be  established, \ndespite its high cost, rather than the ubiquitous stand-alone diesel generation. \n \n\nd. \n\nLowest Electrification Rate in the Region \n\n12. \nAbout  90  million  people,  or  38%  of  the  Indonesian  population,  have  no  access  to \nelectricity  and  most  of  the  rural  population  relies  on  biomass  for  their  primary  fuel  for  cooking \nand kerosene for their lighting needs. Because of the lack of incentives for private investment \nand shortage of capital for public investment, access to electricity by the Indonesian population \nremains one of the lowest in the region.  \n \n\ne. \n\nInefficient Lighting Contributing to High Energy Intensity \n\n13. \nIndonesia's  energy  consumption  per  capita  is  much  smaller  than  it  is  in  both  Thailand \nand Malaysia, while Indonesia's energy intensity is significantly higher than that of its neighbors. \nUse  of  relatively  inefficient  appliances  by  residential  consumers  contributes  to  this.  Although \nelectricity consumption by the residential sector varies widely across different income classes in \nrural  and  urban  areas,  on  average  more  than  50%  of  the  electricity  is  used  for  lighting  by \nresidential  customers.  Consumers  are  aware  of  the  benefits  of  energy  efficient  compact \nfluorescent lamps (CFLs), however they continue using incandescent bulbs which are cheaper \nbut  consume  about  five  times  more  energy.  Consumers  are  concerned  about  the  cost  and \nquality of CFLs, but unaware of the quality, standard, or regulated labeling for CFLs. While good \nquality  CFLs  can  last  for  8,000\u201315,000  hours,  poor  quality  ones  often  fail  within  100  hours. \nWhen cheap ones fail after a short time, consumers are reluctant to replace them. \n\n                                                 \n6  The average wholesale electricity price in the National Electricity Market of Australia.  \n\n\f  \n\n4 \n \n\nf. \n\nMain Cause of the Problems \n\n14.  Most  problems  described  in  paras.  9-13  stem  from  the  following  main  causes:  (i)  low \ntariffs and high subsidies, (ii) policy gaps as a result of poor coordination and decision making, \n(iii)  barriers  to  private  sector  investment  and  lack  of  regulatory  clarity,  (iv)  PLN's  overall \nmonopoly  position,  and  (v)  the  absence  of  a  rural  electrification  strategy  and  financing.  In \naddition, the Indonesian power tariff is one of the lowest in Asia and, because of the low tariffs, \nPLN  only  recovers  part  of  its  cost  of  electricity  production  and  supply  from  its  sales  revenue. \nElectricity  tariffs  have  remained  the  same7 since  2003,  although  the  cost  of  supply  has  more \nthan  doubled  from  $0.056  to  $0.132  per  kWh  during  the  same  period.  Since  the  Government \nhas maintained these low tariffs for social reasons, it provides direct subsidies to PLN to meet \nthe financing gap. In 2008, subsidies to PLN became a major drain on Government budget and \nreached  the  all  time  high  of  $7.6  billion,  increasing  from  $315  million  in  2004.  Detailed \ndiscussion  on  tariffs  and  subsidies  is  in  Appendix  4.  The  low  tariffs  and  associated  subsidies \nhave created a range of disincentives for PLN, consumers, and other stakeholders, leading to \nthe main problems in the sector.  \n \n\n2. \n\nGovernment\u2019s Policies and Plans \n\n \n15. \nAs  Indonesia  is  an  oil  producing  country,  the  Government  has  always  faced  the  policy \nissue of allocating the right amount of oil for local consumption and for export, especially during \nperiods of high prices. For example, after the oil crisis of the 1970s it progressively reduced the \nproportion of oil for power generation from about 70% in the 1980s to about 54% in 1993 and to \n21% in 1998. However, this proportion rose back to about 36% in 2005, and the high domestic \nconsumption made Indonesia a net importer of oil. This prompted immediate policy change, and \nthe Government increased domestic oil prices by 49% in March 2005 and by 105% in October \n2005, causing the price of high-speed diesel to triple, from $0.18 per liter in 2004 to $0.55 per \nliter in 2006.  \n \nIn  addition  to  raising  prices,  the  Government  initiated  a  fast-track  program8 to  reduce \n16. \ndependency  on  oil  for  power  generation.  Under  this  program,  it  plans  to  develop  10  coal-fired \npower plants in Java\u2013Bali (7,520 MW) and 23 coal-fired power plants outside Java\u2013Bali (1,963 \nMW). A second fast-track program that includes about 60% renewable energy generation will be \nimplemented between 2009 and 2014. These initiatives will address the immediate problems of \npower  shortage,  the  high  cost  of  power  (and  dependency  on  oil),  and  low  use  of  renewable \nenergy.  As  a  policy  support  to  encourage  these  investments,  in  April  2009  the  Government \nissued ministerial decree No.5/2009, which removed the previous price cap of $0.045/kWh for \npower purchase from IPPs, and gave PLN the exclusive authority to decide on IPP prices. PLN \nhas increased the price for new IPPs to between $0.065/kWh and $0.085/kWh, and since then \nhas acted as a single buyer of electricity from the IPPs. ADB's engagement in the power sector \nwill help the Government to switch to clean coal technologies and renewable energy options for \nfuture power generation (discussed in paragraph 29). \n \n17. \nThe overall sector strategy is reflected in the Government\u2019s Blueprint of National Energy \nManagement  2005\u20132025,  which  recognizes  the  high  share  of  oil  in  the  energy  mix  and \ndependence on oil imports, and sets the following targets for 2025: to reduce the use of oil to \n\n                                                 \n7  In real terms, the tariffs have actually been reduced by about 50% since 2003, as the Indonesian consumer price \n\nindex increased to 161.73 in 2008 from 105.65 in 2003. Source: Statistics Indonesia. \n\n8  Presidential Decree No. 71 of 2006, requiring PLN to invest in new coal steam-fired power plants under its energy \n\ndiversification strategy and add about 10,000 MW to address the power deficit. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 5\n\nless than 20% and increase the use of (i) coal (from 15.7% to more than 33%), (ii) liquefied coal \n(to more than 2%), (iii) natural gas (from 23% to more than 30%), (iv) geothermal energy (from \n1.9% to more than 5%), and (v) biofuels and other renewable energy (to more than 10%).  \n \nThe  Government  is  addressing  the  issue  of  lowest  electrification  in  the  region  in  its \n18. \nNational Electricity Development Plan, which aims to increase the electrification ratio to 90% by \n2020.  PLN  plans  to  connect  around  10  million  new  customers  between  2010  and  2014  to \nachieve the Government\u2019s commitment to increasing the electrification rate, and has a long list \nof investment plans with an estimated cost of about $14.4 billion.  \n \n\n3. \n\nOpportunities \n\nIn  some  respects  the  power  sector  in  Indonesia  has  significantly  improved  in  recent \n19. \nyears  compared  to  the  1990s  and  early  2000s.  These  improvements  are  in  line  with  broader \ntrends  to  better  economic  management  and  governance  in  Indonesia.  For  example,  PLN  has \nintroduced  greater  transparency  in  reporting,  established  good  corporate  governance  and \nindependent audit, and strengthened financing to support issuance of international bonds. It is \nalso  moving  from  an  engineering-dominated  culture  to  one  with  greater  emphasis  on  other \ndisciplines.  For  example,  losses  have  been  reduced  gradually  since  2004.  In  2007,  the \ngigawatt-hours  sold  per  employee  increased  to  3.8  GWh  from  1.7  GWh  in  2002,  and  the \nnumber  of  customers  served  per  employee  increased  to  941  from  648  in  2002.  PLN  has  also \ndeveloped  separate  accounting  reports  for  the  operations  of  its  distribution  businesses  in \ngeographic regions. Sector issues are discussed in details in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n \nIn  relation  to  energy  efficiency,  the  energy  policy  currently  being  developed  should  set \n20. \nout principles that guide priorities, identify specific areas for immediate attention, and consider \nbudget  implications.  ADB's  sector  study  recommends  the  setting  up  of  a  separate  directorate \ngeneral  for  energy  efficiency  and  renewables  to  lead  implementation  of  the  energy  efficiency \npolicy.   \n \n21. \nAs  Indonesia\u2019s  subsidized  energy  sector  contributes  to  inefficient  public  spending  and \nimpedes  investment  to  modernize  the  sector,  there  is  a  strong  economic  justification  for \ninvesting in projects that mitigate climate change. In addition, because the subsidies are linked \nto world energy (and price shocks), potential carbon payments for emission reductions will not \nonly provide economic benefits but also reduce exposure to oil prices\u2014sufficient incentives to \npromote energy efficiency.   \n \n22. \nPLN is committed to increasing efficiency in its distribution network. During 2004\u20132008 \nPLN  invested  about  $730  million  in  the  Java\u2013Bali  distribution  network,  averaging  about  $175 \nmillion  each  year,  except  in  2008  when  the  investment  level  dropped  to  about  $33  million \nbecause  of  the  high  price  of  fuel.  Investments  were  made  in  electrical  equipment  and  in \nreplacing old equipment that did not meet load specifications. Networks were optimized to meet \nthe changing needs of growing power demand and changing load flow conditions, and to avoid \noverloading  of  equipment  and  bottlenecks  in  the  network.  These  investments  reduced \ndistribution  losses.  PLN  management  is  committed  to  reducing  distribution  losses  to  6%  (the \ninternational norm is 3%\u20135%) by investing about $1.2 billion between 2010 and 2014. In 2008, \nthe distribution system loss was about 8.4%\u2014its lowest level ever\u2014as a result of PLN's network \noptimization investments since 2003.  \n \n23. \nThrough the proposed Project, ADB will establish a partnership with the AFD to support \nPLN's  energy  efficiency  initiative.  It  will  also  bring  in  expertise  and  processes  to  quantify  and \n\n\f  \n\n6 \n \n\ncapture  the  benefit  of  the  avoided  CO2  emissions  as  a  financial  benefit  to  the  project,  and \nparticipate  in  the  global  efforts  to  mitigate  the  threat  of  climate  change.  If  this  approach  and \npartnership  is  successful  and  progress  is  made  on  implementation  of  some  of  the  policy \nrecommendations,  ADB  will  scale  up  this  small  investment  with  a  sector  project  for  energy \nefficiency and renewable energy to meet the growing local investment need and to generate the \nglobal public good of emission reduction to tackle the threat of climate change.   \n \n\n4. \n\nClean Development Mechanism Credits  \n\n \nUnder the Kyoto Protocol, the Clean Development Mechanism9 (CDM) was developed to \n24. \nset targets for emissions and create a market for emission reduction with economic value. The \nCDM allows emission reduction (or emission removal) projects in developing countries to earn \ncertified emission reduction (CER) credits, each equivalent to 1 ton of CO2 and these CERs can \nbe  traded,  sold,  and  used  by  industrialized  countries  to  meet  part  of  their  emission  reduction \ntargets set under the Kyoto Protocol. Indonesia has large potential to reduce emissions either \nby energy saving or through energy efficiency. As Indonesia relies heavily on oil and coal for its \npower  production,  it  is,  theoretically,  a  country  with  high  CDM  potential  in  the  Association  of \nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region. An emission factor of more than 0.8 tons of CO2 per \nMWh  implies  that  each  megawatt-hour  of  avoided  power  generation  in  Indonesia  produces \nabout 60% more emission credit than it does in the Philippines, which has an emission factor of \nabout 0.5 tons of CO2 per MWh. Despite this large incentive, according to the database of the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), as of October 2009 only \n24 projects had been registered from Indonesia with the executive board of the CDM and about \n224,000 CERs had been issued, indicating that Indonesia had only been able to capture about \n2% of the global CDM market.  \n \n\n5. \n\nADB Strategy  \n\n25. \nThe developing countries of Asia are gradually developing strategies and programs for \nboth their climate change and adaptation measures. To mitigate energy-associated emissions, \nenergy efficiency improvements and low-carbon and zero-carbon solutions are being adopted. \nAlready,  ADB  is  working  with  new  financing  mechanisms  and  capacity  building  for  energy \nefficiency  improvements,  renewable  energy,  waste  to  energy,  sustainable  transport,  and  other \nemission mitigation projects. This will be achieved through ADB's clean energy and environment \nprograms,  including  the  Energy  Efficiency  Initiative,  Carbon  Market  Initiative  (CMI),  and \nSustainable Transport Initiative. \n \nADB has initiated a range of energy programs including the Energy Efficiency Initiative10 \n26. \nto  increase  the  number  of  clean  energy  projects  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific.  One  of  the  key \ncomponents of the program is the CMI, which provides technical support and up-front financing \nfor  clean  energy  projects  with  greenhouse  gas  mitigation  benefits.  The  CMI  is  a  value-added \nservice extended to renewable energy and energy efficiency projects in Asia and the Pacific that \nare  suitable  for  ADB  financing.  It  contributes  to  ADB\u2019s  sustainable  development  efforts  by \nproviding  additional  financial  incentives  to  project  developers  and  sponsors  to  construct  and \noperate  clean  energy  projects.  In  Indonesia,  ADB  provided  technical  assistance  to  develop \ninstitutional capacity to process and promote CDM projects.11 \n\n                                                 \n9   More information is available at http://cdm.unfccc.int/index.html \n10 Launched in July 2005, with the aim of investing $1 billion per year on clean energy from 2008 to 2010 \n11  ADB.  2004.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  Institutionalizing  the  Clean  Development \n\nMechanism. Manila.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 7\n\n \n27. \nADB  has  had  a  long  relationship  with  the  Government  of  Indonesia  and  PLN.  ADB \nstarted its lending in 1970 and has financed 30 power projects totaling about $3.4 billion and 36 \ntechnical  assistance  projects  totaling  about  $14  million.  The  lending  has  focused  on  the \ngeneration and  transmission sectors.  ADB  Independent  Evaluation  Department  studies  for the \nsector  show  that  ADB  has  a  comparative  advantage  in  providing  loans  for  energy,  transport, \ncommunications,  social  infrastructure,  and  finance  projects.  The  Independent  Evaluation \nDepartment noted that in the power subsector, with few exceptions, the completed loan projects \nsucceeded in achieving their expected outputs and immediate objectives, including the provision \nof  additional  capacity  to  match  load  growth,  the  removal  of  transmission  system  constraints, \nimprovement  in  system  efficiency  and  reliability,  increase  in  the  use  of  indigenous  energy \nresources (hydropower and geothermal), and contribution to socioeconomic development. \n \nADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  for  2006\u2013200912 and  country  operations  business \n28. \nplan  2009\u20132011 13 support  a  medium-term  growth  rate  of  6%  per  annum  and  highlight  the \nimportance  of  removing  infrastructure  bottlenecks  in  the  power  sector  and  establishing \nattractive, effective, and transparent incentives for private sector participation.  \n \n29. \nClean  energy  and  energy  efficiency  will  be  the  target  of  ADB's  future  investments  in \nIndonesia.  Investment  in  the  generation  sector  will  be  either  in  the  form  of  public\u2013private \npartnerships  (to  encourage  private  sector  investments)  or  through  the  use  of  guarantee \ninstruments  to  mobilize  commercial  cofinancing  that  will  be  limited  to  renewable  energy \n(hydropower  or  geothermal  power)  and  efficient  thermal  power  plants14 (with  supercritical  or \nultra-supercritical boiler combined-cycle gas-fired  power plants). ADB's  involvement will play a \ncatalytic role by attracting other investors. ADB's interest will be limited to strategic transmission \ninvestments that will (i) link different islands to reduce the overall need for reserve capacity to \nimprove  system  reliability,  remove  transmission bottlenecks,  and  transmit  cheaper  power  from \none area to the other; or (ii) connect two transmission grids across national boundaries where \nboth  countries  will  benefit  from  cross-border  power  trading  with  ADB  playing  the  role  of  an \nhonest  broker.  In  addition,  ADB  will  promote  political-risk  guarantees  or  other  guarantees  to \nreduce  the  risk  of  private  investments  in  power  transmission.  ADB's  focus  on  distribution  will \ncover both rehabilitation for loss reduction and reliability improvement, and new investments to \nsupport new connections.  \n \n30. \nRecently the Government requested the International Energy Agency (IEA) to undertake \nan  energy  policy  review  for  Indonesia,  which  suggested  six  areas  for  priority  attention:  (i) \ndomestic  energy  pricing  and  subsidies;  (ii)  policy  coordination,  decision  making,  and \nimplementation;  (iii)  energy  sector  investment;  (iv)  independence  and  authority  of  energy \nregulators; (v) harnessing of a sustainable development agenda particularly through renewable \nenergy implementation; and (vi) mainstreaming of energy efficiency and conservation policy. As \na necessary next step of the IEA study, ADB has finalized a detailed sector diagnostics and a \nsector strategy. These studies are in Supplementary Appendixes A and B.  \n \n\n6. \n\nDevelopment Coordination \n\n31. \nThe  World  Bank's  strategic  focus  is  on  strengthening  the  technical  and  operational \ncapacities of state institutions such as PLN. Together with ADB and Japan, the World Bank is \n\n                                                 \n12  ADB. 2006. Indonesia Country Strategy and Program (2006\u20132009). Manila. \n13 ADB 2008.

The  policy  loans  of  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  have  the  objective  of  increasing  private \ninvestments  in  the  energy  sector  through  public\u2013private  partnerships,  focusing  on  clean  and \nrenewable  energy  projects  (such  as  geothermal  power  investments  together  with  Pertamina \nGeothermal  Energy  and  the  $500  million  Upper  Cisokan  pumped  storage  project),  and  power \ntransmission and distribution projects including gas distribution.  \n \n32. \nJapan's  lending  to  Indonesia  has  been  similar.  About  26%  of  its  total  portfolio  in \nIndonesia is for the energy sector; \u00a5377 billion of development assistance was lent to the sector \nduring  1996\u20132006.  Japan  has  also  prepared  a  geothermal  sector  master  plan,  which  was \ncompleted in December 2007, and an energy efficiency study, finalized in 2008. Project lending \nby  Japan  has  mainly  focused  on  generation,  including  both  small-scale  geothermal  and  gas-\nfired power plants. In 2009, Japan International Cooperation Agency signed an agreement with \nPLN to finance the $1.8 billion high-voltage direct current link connecting Sumatra with Java to \nmeet  the  growing  demand  for  power  in  the  Java\u2013Bali  grid.  Cooperation  and  harmonization  of \ndevelopment partners in the power sectors has been generally fluid with regular invitations from \neach of the key players to participate in meetings or missions and exchange of information and \ndocuments.  Policy  dialogue  was  undertaken  jointly  on  several  occasions  and  this  is  well \nreceived  by  the  Government  in  light  of  the  Paris  Declaration.  Key  activities  and  strategies  of \nmajor development partners are described in Appendix 5. \n \n\n7. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n33. \nDuring  and  after  the  Asian  financial  crisis,  many  components  of  the  then  ongoing \nprojects had to be cancelled due to inadequate counterpart financing. ADB's last energy sector \nproject  loan 15  had  sufficient  allocation  for  counterpart  financing.  However,  difficulties  in \ncomplying  with  ADB\u2019s  social  and  environmental  safeguards  policies  and  slow  processing  of \ncontract awards delayed the implementation of these projects. Although both the projects were \ndesigned  to  be  completed  by  March  2008,  less  than  30%  of  the  combined  loan  amount  had \nbeen  disbursed  as  at  February  2010.  Land  acquisition  and  resettlement  has  been  the  main \ncause of implementation delay of these two projects. The proposed Project will not face these \ndelays as it involves no new civil works. \n \n34. \nThe  risk  of  procurement  delays  has  been  addressed  through  advance  procurement \naction  for  consultant  selection  and  for  preparation  of  bidding  documents.  ADB's  procurement \nspecialists have been involved in designing the procurement plan and its contract packages to \nminimize the risk of future delays. Because the project components involve rehabilitation, they \nwill not trigger any of the social and environmental policy safeguards of ADB.  \n\n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n35. \nThe impact of the proposed Project will be reduced CO2 emissions by the power sector. \nThe  reduction  will  be  about  330,000  tons  each  year  for  about  15  years\u2014  a  small  amount \ncompared  with  the  total  annual  emission  by  the  Indonesian  power  sector.  Despite  its  small \nimpact,  nationally  the  Project  will  demonstrate  the  ability  to  (i)  defer  large  investments  in \n                                                 \n15 ADB.  2002.

Once  successful,  a  larger  operation  of  a  similar  type  will  reduce \nlarge emissions by the power sector.  \n \nThe  outcome  of  the  Project  will  be  to  contribute  to  PLN's  corporate  effort  to  improve \n36. \noverall distribution efficiency and improve quality of power supply. Overall loss will be reduced \nto  7.0%  from  8.4%  by  2013.  Customers'  power  supply  voltage  will  improve  in  all  regions, \nespecially  in  rural  areas.  In  2008,  on  average,  each  customer\u2019s  power  supply  was  interrupted \nabout  6.8  times.  The  project  will  contribute  to  reducing  the  average  number  of  power \ninterruptions  per  year  to  three  interruptions  by  2013.  Reliable  and  higher  quality  power  in  the \nhouse  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  household  income  and  social  activities,  especially  in  the \nevening.  The  increased  longevity  of  appliances  (in  households,  schools,  or  hospitals)  will \nincrease service delivery and economic activities.  \n  \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n1. \n\nPart 1: Reduction of Distribution Losses  \n\nThe  proposed  Project  has  five  outputs:  (i)  reduced  losses  in  the  Java\u2013Bali  power \n37. \ndistribution  system,  (ii)  incremental  sales  resulting  from  increased  distribution  capacity,  (iii) \nincreased  access  to  power  by  new  customer  connections,  (iv)  reduced  peak  demand  and \nincreased awareness of efficient lighting options in isolated grids and selected islands, and (v) \nefficient project implementation.  \n \n \n \nOutput  1.  The  Project  will  reduce  distribution  losses  by  (i)  reconfiguring  electrical \n38. \nequipment through optimization of its location and size, (ii) reconductoring or replacing old low- \nand  medium-voltage  overhead  distribution  lines,  (iii)  replacing  overloaded  low-  and  medium-\nvoltage transformers with new transformers of appropriate specifications, (iv) inserting additional \ntransformers  (splitting  feeders  into  two)  in  long  low-voltage  overloaded  distribution  lines,  (v) \ninstalling cubicles that will operate within design parameters, and (vi) new switching stations and \ncapacitors. By 2012, the total savings from loss reduction will be about 400 GWh each year\u2014\ncomprising about 100 GWh in Jakarta, 40 GWh in central Java, 50 GWh in west Java, 180 GWh \nin  east  Java,  and  30  GWh  in  Bali.  The  value  of  the  400  GWh  of  saved  power  (assuming  a \nmarginal cost of $0.15/kwh) is about $60 million each year.  \n \n39. \nOutput  2.  Incremental  sales  are  the  additional  energy  the  distribution  network  will  be \nable to distribute to customers because of the optimization of its distribution system. As some of \nthe  bottlenecks  will  be  removed,  the  network's  overall  capacity  will  increase  because  of  the \nProject. Incremental sales will be the result of (i) reconfiguring the equipment, (ii) reconductoring \nboth  low-  and  medium-voltage  overhead  lines,  (iii)  additional  transformer  capacity,  and  (iv) \ncapacitors that will reduce reactive power. The overall incremental sales will be about 635 GWh \nper  year,  with  about  175  GWh  in  Jakarta  where,  for  each  square  kilometer  (km),  PLN's  load \ndensity  is  about  2.2  MW  serving  about  (6,800  people),  and  about  85  GWh  in  central  Java, \nwhere the load density is 68 kilowatts (kW), serving about 980 people. \n \n40. \nOutput  3.  Increased  access  to  power  is  an  indirect  output  of  this  Project.  The  energy \nsaved  in  output  1  will  be  enough  to  connect  about  1.2  million  new  customers  to  the  grid  in \nJakarta (275,000), central Java (110,000), west Java (110,000), east Java (620,000), and Bali \n(85,000).  As  a  result,  the  waiting  time  for  new  connection  will  be  reduced.  The  waiting  list  for \nnew connection has grown from 414,000 in 2004 to about 800,000 in 2008. At the end of 2008, \nwhile PLN connected about 800,000 new customers, another 819,000 were on the waiting list\u2014\n\n\f  \n\n10 \n \n\n2. \n\nPart 2: Efficiency Lighting Pilot  \n\n225,000 in west Java, 200,000 in Jakarta, 210,000 in central Java, 160,000 in east Java, and \n24,000 in Bali. Larger numbers of customers will be connected through incremental sales. \n \n \n \n41. \nOutput  4.  Reduced  peak  demand  in  pilot  areas  will  be  achieved  by  promoting  energy \nefficient  lighting  solutions  to  residential  customers.  Compact  fluorescent  lamps  (CFLs)  are  a \nwell-established alternative to incandescent light bulbs. According to recent IEA studies,16 about \n25% of the energy consumed by CFLs is converted to visible light compared with just 5% for a \nconventional incandescent lamp. Hence a typical CFL consumes about 20%\u201325% of the energy \nused  by  an  incandescent  light  bulb  for  the  same  level  of  light.  Put  simply,  if  1  million \nincandescent  bulbs  are  replaced  with  CFLs  at  a  cost  of  about  $1.0  million,  the  electricity \ndemand  will  be  reduced  by  50  MW.  The  impact  on  the  power  system  will  be  the  same  as \nbuilding a new 50 MW power station, which may cost at least $50 million, another $2 million\u2013$3 \nmillion each year to operate, and take 3\u20134 years to construct. \n \nElectricity  consumption  by  Indonesia\u2019s  residential  sector  varies  widely  across  different \n42. \nincome classes in rural and urban areas. However, more than 50% of the electricity is used for \nlighting by residential customers, making efficient lighting the main focus for immediate energy \nefficiency gains. Under this Project about 500,000 CFLs and LEDs will be distributed in selected \nisolated and island grids covering the entire country. Multiple sites (either island grid or isolated \nsystems within the main islands) will be part of the pilot. This will include the distribution of about \n30,000  CFLs  on  the  island  of  Nusa  Penida,  which  will  have  a  large  visible  and  quantifiable \noutput.  Nusa  Penida  has  an  installed  capacity  of  about  3,400  kW,  of  which  about  900  kW  is \ngenerated  by  wind  and  solar  and  the  remainder  by  diesel  that  is  shipped  to  the  island. \nPreliminary  estimates  suggest  that  the  maximum  demand  of  1,900  kW  of  the  island  could  be \nreduced  by  300  kW  if  efficient  lighting  is  used  by  its  7,000  users.  The  marginal  cost  of \ngeneration on Nusa Penida is about $0.30/kWh that involves burning about 7,000 liters of diesel \nfuel  each  day  at  a  cost  of  $7,000,  including  transport  cost.  This  could be  reduced  by  30%\u2014a \npotential saving of $800,000 each year\u2014if each family on the island replaced their incandescent \nbulbs  with \nin \nSupplementary Appendix F.  \n \n \n \n43. \nOutput  5.  The  Project  will  also  provide  consultants  to  support  Project  implementation, \npreparation and evaluation of bidding documents, and construction supervision. Although PLN \nhas  the  technical  competency  to  design  and  implement  similar  projects,  implementation \nconsultants  will  support  PLN  to  implement  the  project  within  the  tight  2-year  time  frame.  In \naddition, the consultant will assist PLN in all aspects of procurement and will also ensure that \nthe design is the least-cost solution for the individual region.  \n \nC. \n\nlow-wattage  CFLs  or  equivalent  LEDs.

The medium-voltage feeders are short and the main \npart of the network is underground. The sustained heavy feeder loads have damaged parts of \nthe  distribution  network.  Hence,  system  reconfiguration,  including  reinforcement  by  new, \nefficiently  located  urban  substations,  is  required  to  reverse  this  situation.  In  Jakarta  and  the \nTangerang region the Project will (i) install around 226 additional distribution transformers with \n315 kilovolt-amperes (kVA), 400 kVA, 630 kVA, and 1,000 kVA ratings; (ii) upgrade 77 existing \ndistribution  transformers  and  connecting  low-voltage  lines;  (iii)  lay  about  180  km  of  medium-\nvoltage underground cables and about 25 km of overhead distribution lines; and (iv) connect 21 \nadditional distribution transformers on the medium-voltage overhead line in the industrial areas \nof Tangerang and Kebayoram. \n \n\n2. \n\nWest Java  \n\n46. \nIn  west  Java  and  Banten,  most  feeder  lines  are  long,  resulting  in  high  losses  and  a \nnetwork that operates on a poor power factor of less than 0.85.17 The city of Bandung faces a \nlarge number of outages each year as feeder lines are overloaded. The Project will procure new \nefficient  transformers,  and  shorten  the  length  of  feeder  lines  to  reduce  losses  to  improve  the \nquality  of  supply,  especially  in  the  main  industrial  areas.  The  Project  will  cover  Bandung  (the \ncapital city of west Java), Banten (the capital of Banten province), Bekasi, Depok and Karawang \n(industrial areas near Jakarta), and Bogor.  \n \n47. \nThe  Project  will  (i)  add  15  new  switching  stations  on  land  already  owned  by  PLN;  (ii) \ninstall  new  medium-voltage  feeder  lines  (about  249  km  of  underground  cables  and  45  km  of \nmedium-voltage overhead distribution lines); (iii) reconductor around 160 km of medium-voltage \ndistribution  lines;  (iv)  install  or  replace  62  medium-voltage  cubicles  in  switching  stations;  (v) \nmotorize 110 remote-controlled reclosers, load break switches,18 and cubicles; (vi) install around \n350  new  pole-mounted  distribution  transformers,  and  6    transformers  (400  kVA  and  630  kVA) \nconnected by 150 km of low-voltage distribution lines equipped with twisted cable; (vii) upgrade \n108  distribution  transformers;  (viii)  replace  around  50  km  of  low-voltage-line  conductors, \nchanging  from  35  square  millimeter  bare  conductors  to  low-voltage  twisted  cable;  and  (ix) \nreplace 915 low-voltage panels in the distribution transformers.  \n \n\n3. \n\nCentral Java \n\nThe  central  Java  distribution  system  supplies  large  rural  areas  and  some  big  cities.  In \n48. \nrural areas, the single-phase system is unable to cope with load density and growth. The long \nfeeder  length,  which  in  some  cases  exceeds  60  km,  causes  large  voltage  drops  and  high \nlosses.  The  power  factor  (about  0.8)  is  also  seen  as  a  problem  in  this  region.  In  central  Java \n(central  Java  and  Jogyakarta),  the  Project  will  (i)  transform  about  85  km  of  single-phase \nmedium-voltage  lines  to  three-phase  lines;  (ii)  upgrade  about  61  km  of  three-phase  medium-\nvoltage lines; (iii) upgrade 2,888 pole-mounted distribution transformers according to the above \nupgrading; and (iv) install 13 capacitors banks along 13 medium-voltage feeder lines. \n \n\n                                                 \n17 Power factor is the ratio of the real power to the apparent power, and is a number between 0 and 1 expressed as a \n\npercentage. \n\n18 An electric switch designed to operate (open or close) a circuit with several hundred thousand volts. \n\n\f  \n\n12 \n \n\n4. \n\nEast Java  \n\n49. \nThe distribution system in east Java is characterized by two different types of networks: \none supplying large industrial customers and the other supplying residential consumers through \nlong  feeders.  The  network  is  old  and  overloaded.  The  Project  will  upgrade  urgently  needed \noverloaded feeders and (i) reconfigure around 445 km of medium-voltage lines so that they can \nsupply  the  main  feeder  loads  to  two  different  switching  stations;  (ii)  upgrade  about  510  km  of \nmedium-voltage  distribution  lines;  (iii)  upgrade  about  970  km  of  low-voltage  distribution  lines; \nand (iv) upgrade about 1,055 distribution transformers and reconfigure the corresponding low-\nvoltage systems. \n \n\n5. \n\nBali \n\nThe  island  of  Bali  has  many  commercial  (large  hotels  and  resorts)  and  high-revenue \n50. \nresidential customers, mostly in south Bali; the population in east and north Bali is more rural. \nTwo challenges are faced in Bali: (i) rehabilitating the aged network in the southern part to meet \nquality  of  supply  expectations  of  the  tourism  industry,  and  (ii)  improving  the  reliability  of  the \nunderground  system.  The  Project  will  (i)  replace  about  100  km  of  low-voltage  distribution  line \nconductors  and  4  km  of  underground  cables,  (ii)  install  296  pole-mounted  distribution \ntransformers  and  equip  the  corresponding  new  connecting  low-voltage  lines,  and  (iii) \nreconfigure the feeders from New Kuta and Payangan switching stations to optimize the spindle \nsystem. This will need about 18 km of new medium-voltage lines.   \n \nD. \n\nSpecial Features \n\nPLN  is  operating  in  an  environment  where  the  cost  of  power  generation  is  high  and, \n51. \ndepending  on  international  oil  price  variations,  the  generation  cost  may  even  increase  further. \nTherefore,  there  is  a strong  argument  for improving  energy  efficiency  to  reduce  the  volume  of \nhigh-cost  (and  subsidized)  energy  and  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  Indonesia  has  large \nnumbers  of  incandescent  bulbs  in  operation  and  consumers\u2014especially  poor  ones\u2014have  not \nshifted  to  energy  efficient  CFLs  to  reduce  energy  consumption.  While  some  consumers  have \nswitched  to  CFLs,  others  have  opted  for  inexpensive  CFLs  (three  for  $1),  which  are  often  of \npoor quality and last only about 1,000 hours. On an overall life cycle cost basis these are more \nexpensive than ordinary incandescent bulbs. Hence there is a need to demonstrate and quantify \nthe benefits of CFLs to policy makers and end consumers.  \n \n52. \nThis  project  will  demonstrate  that  (i)  good  quality  CFLs  can  last  10,000\u201315,000  hours \nand can reduce lighting energy demand by 80%, (ii) through competitive bulk procurement the \ncost of high-quality CFLs can be reduced to $1.00\u2013$1.50, and (iii) CDM credit may bring more \nrevenue than the cost of a CFL and its free distribution to end consumers. The planned 500,000 \nCFLs under the proposed pilot in isolated and island grids will save about 20,000 tons of CO2 \nemissions each year, and the overall value of CDM credit could be close to $200,000 each year \nfor  the  next  5\u20137  years,  almost  offsetting  the  total  cost  of  the  CFLs.  Once  these  benefits  are \ndemonstrated and a methodology for receiving CDM credit is secured, PLN may scale up CFL \ndistribution to customers across the nation.  \n \n53. \nIn  2007,  a  PLN  plan  to  distribute  about  50  million  CFLs  would  have  achieved  demand \nreduction of at least 1,200 MW of peak system capacity plus associated transmission, avoiding \ninvestment  of  $1.3  billion  of  power  generation  capacity  and  saving  $450  million  a  year  in  fuel \ncosts.19  \n\n                                                 \n19  Saving 500,000 tons of oil at about $900 per ton. \n\n\f \n\n \nE. \n\nProject Investment Plan  \n\n \n\n 13\n\n54. \nThe project investment cost is estimated at $120.0 million, including taxes and duties of \n$9.0  million.

All  procurement  contracts  will \ncontain anticorruption provisions as specified by ADB and will address environmental and social \nissues  in  compliance  with  ADB  and  AFD  rules.  Procurement  details  are  provided  in  the \nprocurement plan (Appendix 8). \n \n\n4. \n\nAdvance Procurement Action and Retroactive Financing  \n\n62. \nThe  Government  requested,  and  ADB  management  approved,  (i)  advance  action  for \nprocurement of goods and related services, and (ii) retroactive financing for goods and related \nservices. The advance action will cover tendering and bid evaluation up to the stage of ADB\u2019s \napproval  of  PLN\u2019s  recommendation  for  award  of  contract  before  the  effective  date  of  the  loan \nagreement. The retroactive financing for goods will cover the 12 months prior to the date of the \nloan agreement, with a ceiling of $5 million or 10% of the ADB loan amount. The Government \nwas  advised  that  ADB  approval  of  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  does  not \ncommit ADB to approve the proposed loan and that ADB financing will be dependent upon the \nGovernment's  compliance  with  all  aspects  of  ADB's  procedural  requirements,  including \ncompliance with the relevant provisions of the loan agreement and ADB guidelines. \n \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n63. \nConsultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  under  the  Project  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  An  international \nconsulting  firm  will  be  engaged  to  manage  implementation  of  the  Project.  The  firm  will  deliver \n105  person-months  of  consulting  services  (15  person-months  of  international  and  90  person-\nmonths  of  national  consulting)  following  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  and \nusing full technical proposal. The outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix \n9. Individual consultants will deliver 18 person-months of consulting services (6 person-months \nof  international  and  12  person-months  of  national  consulting)  for  implementation  of  the  pilot \nproject for efficient lighting. \n \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n64. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  PLN.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project. \n\n\f  \n\n16 \n \n\nThe Government and PLN will also (i) undertake necessary measures to create and sustain a \ncorruption-free  environment  for  activities  under  the  Project;  (ii)  institute,  maintain  and  ensure \ncompliance  with  internal  procedures  and  controls  for  activities  under  the  Project,  following \ninternational best practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption, money laundering \nactivities, and the financing of terrorists, and shall require all relevant ministries and agencies to \nrefrain from engaging in any such activities; (iii) comply with ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, \nas  amended  to  date);  and  (iv)  where  appropriate,  ensure  that  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy are included in all bidding documents for the Project. The Government and \nPLN  (i)  acknowledge  ADB\u2019s  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive  and  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project,  and  (ii)  agree  to \ncooperate  fully  with  any  such  investigation  and  to  extend  all  necessary  assistance,  including \nproviding  access  to  all  relevant  books  and  records,  as  may  be  necessary  for  the  satisfactory \ncompletion of any such investigation. All external costs related to such investigations will be met \nby the Project resources. \n \n65. \nTo ensure transparency and good governance, PLN will publicly disclose on its website \ninformation  on  how  loan  proceeds  are  being  used.  For  each  procurement  contract,  PLN  will \ndisclose (i) the list of participating bidders, (ii) the name of the winning bidder, (iii) basic details \non bidding procedures adopted, (iv) the amount of the contract awarded, (v) a list of goods and \nservices  purchased,  and  (vi)  the  intended  and  actual  utilization  of  loan  proceeds  under  each \ncontract being awarded. PLN will ensure that all project staff are fully aware of ADB procedures, \nincluding  procedures  for  implementation,  procurement,  use  of  consultants,  disbursement, \nreporting, monitoring, and prevention of fraud and corruption. ADB will organize special training \nfor  PLN  staff  covering  all  aspects  of  project  implementation  and  ADB  procedures,  including \nprocedures  for  implementation,  procurement,  use  of  consultants,  disbursement,  reporting, \nmonitoring, and prevention of fraud and corruption. \n  \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n66.  Withdrawal  of  ADB  and  AFD  loan  and  CEF  Grant  proceeds  will  be  in  accordance with \nADB's  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  with \narrangements  between  the  Government  and  ADB.  All  payments  including  payments  for \nconsultants, contractors, and suppliers of the main procurement packages will be paid by direct \npayment. \n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n67. \nThe Government and PLN will maintain records and accounts to identify all goods and \nservices  financed  by  loan  proceeds.  PLN  will  maintain  separate  accounts  by  funding  source \n(ADB  and  AFD  and  CEF  Grant).  Each  of  the  regional  offices  will  maintain  similar records  and \nsubmit annual accounts and financial statements to PLN headquarters for further submission to \nADB. The Government and PLN will ensure that accounts and financial statements are audited \nannually,  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles.  The  annual  Project  account  will \ncontain detailed descriptions of the sources of receipts and expenditures. The annual financial \nstatements will consist of income statement, balance sheet, statement of cash flows and related \nnotes to the financial statements. The annual financial statements shall be consolidated for all \nPLN's operations. The audits will be conducted by independent auditors that will be selected in \naccordance with competitive selection procedures acceptable to ADB. PLN will furnish to ADB \nand AFD, not later than 6 months after the close of each fiscal year, certified copies of audited \nproject  accounts  and  audited  financial  statements,  and  ensure  that  the  auditors  provide  an \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 17\n\nopinion on PLN's compliance with the agreed financial covenants and indicate the details of the \nactual calculation for all ratios.  \n \n68. \nPLN will prepare quarterly progress reports and submit them to ADB and AFD within 20 \ndays of the end of the quarter. The reports will be prepared in a format acceptable to ADB and \nwill  include,  among  other  things,  (i)  project  progress  in  each  project  area,  (ii)  the  status  of \ninstitutional development activities, (iii) delays and problems encountered and actions taken to \nresolve them, (iv) compliance with loan covenants, and (v) expected progress during the next 6 \nmonths.  Within  6  months  of  the  Project's  physical  completion,  the  Government  and  PLN  will \nprepare  and  submit  to  ADB  and  AFD  a  project  completion  report  in  ADB's  standard  format, \nincluding costs and status of compliance with loan covenants. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n69.  Within 3 months of the loan effectiveness date the project management unit will develop \na  project  performance  management  system  on  the  basis  of  the  project  design  and  monitoring \nframework to examine the Project\u2019s technical performance; evaluate delivery of project facilities; \nassess achievement of project objectives; and measure the Project\u2019s social, economic, financial, \nenvironmental, and institutional impacts. \n \n\n10. \n\nStakeholder Participation and Consultation during Implementation \n\n70. \nAs part of its own requirements, PLN will meet stakeholders in each of the five regions \nduring  implementation  with  support  from  implementation  consultants.  During  the  feasibility \nstudy, focus group interviews were conducted with customers to identify the potential impact of \nthe Project in terms of access to reliable electricity and its impact on daily life, social services, \nand  business.  ADB  and  AFD  missions  will  meet  stakeholders  during  project  inception  and \nreview missions.  \n \n\n11. \n\nProject Review \n\n71. \nIn  addition  to  regular  monitoring,  ADB,  AFD,  and  the  Government  will  jointly  review \nproject performance at least twice a year. The review will assess implementation performance \nand achievement of project outcomes and objectives, review financial progress, identify issues \nand constraints affecting the Project, and work out a time-bound action plan for their resolution \nand  monitoring  of  compliance.  In  2010,  ADB,  AFD  and  the  Government  will  undertake  a \nmidterm  review  to  assess  implementation  status;  review  project  parameters;  and  take \nappropriate  measures  including  modifying  the  scope  and  implementation  arrangements,  and \nreallocating  loan  and  grant  proceeds,  as  appropriate  given  implementation  experience,  to \nachieve the project objectives. \n \n\n12. \n\nFinancial Performance of PLN and Financial Management \n\n72. \nPLN\u2019s  operational  and  financial  performance  over  the  past  5  years  has  strengthened \nconsiderably. Its net sales (revenue from customers and subsidies) increased by about 170%, \nfrom Rp62 trillion in 2004 to Rp169 trillion ($17 billion) in 2008. PLN\u2019s earnings before interest, \ntaxes,  depreciation,  and  amortization  (EBITDA)  were  Rp15.85  trillion  in  2008  with  an  EBITDA \nmargin  of  9.6%  in  2008.  However,  overall  net  income\u2014net  of  taxes,  interests,  and  payments \nrelated  to  exchange  rates\u2014has  been  negative  for  all  years  during  2004\u20132008.  Government \nsubsidies,  under  the  public  service  obligations  (PSOs),  contributed  a  significant  part  of  the \n\n\f  \n\n18 \n \n\nrevenue.21 If tariffs are increased to achieve full cost recovery, PLN will be able to continue its \noperations,  as  it  has  the  overall  human  resources,  systems,  and  financial,  accounting,  and \ntechnical infrastructure to run the power sector in Indonesia. Each PLN distribution branch has \nfinance, budget, accounting, and revenue control divisions with experienced staff. Each branch \nhas  a  computerized  enterprise  resource  planning  system  to  control  financial  management, \nbudget  planning,  and  human  resource  management.  Each  branch  produces  individual  annual \nfinancial statements and budget reports. The financial reports include the balance sheet, profit \nand  loss  reports,  and  cash-flow  reports.  All  the  reports  and  activities  are  regularly  audited  by \nPLN  branch  or  headquarters  internal  auditors,  external  auditors,  and  state  auditors.  The \nfinancial  management  system  and  PLN  distribution  office  staff  are  considered  adequate  for \naccounting purposes. Detail assessment of PLN's financial performance is in Appendix 10. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\nA. \n \nThe financial analysis of the Project was carried out in real terms using 2009 prices. The \n73. \ncosts  include  capital  investment,  physical  contingency,  and  operation  and  maintenance. \nFinancial benefits in the financial analysis were based on (i) the value of the energy saved using \nthe  average  fuel  cost  of  $0.035  per  kWh,  and  (ii)  the  value  of  the  incremental  sales  from  the \nincreased  capacity  of  the  distribution  system.  Incremental  sales  are  multiplied  by  a  projected \nPSO  margin  of  4.5%.  The  average  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  is  19.1%,  which \nexceeds  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  of  2.0%.  The  robustness  of  the \ninvestment  was  evaluated  by  carrying  out  a  sensitivity  analysis  for  changes  in  major \nassumptions.  The  Project  is  thus  considered  financially  viable  and  sustainable.  Details  are  in \nAppendix  11.  Detailed  explanation  of  the  valuation  of  the  benefits  and  the  methodology  for \ncalculation is in Supplementary Appendix D.  \n \nB. \n \n74. \nThe estimation of the project net present value and economic internal rate of return (EIRR) \nis carried out in two cases: (i) a conservative case, using only the loss-reduction benefits; and (ii) \nusing both incremental sales and loss reduction. For case (i), the Project's EIRR is estimated at \n35.9%. The net economic present value at a 12% discount rate is $202 million. When the benefits \nof increased, sales are added to the benefits of loss reduction and the economics of the project \nbecome  even  stronger.  With  the  proxy  value  of  increased  sales  at  almost  Rp1,000/kWh  (the \ndifference between the captive power price and supply cost) the EIRR is more than 100% and the \nproject's net present value is about $1.4 billion. The detailed economic analysis is in Appendix 12. \n \nC. \n \n\nEnvironmental Benefits and Social Safeguards \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental Aspects \n\n75. \nADB  has  discussed  with  PLN  the  types  of  distribution  lines  and  devices  that  will  be \ninstalled, the types of waste that could be generated during the implementation of the project, \nand PLN's corporate management strategy for handling such waste materials. Most capacitors \nand transformers will be newly installed and some will be reinforced, new distribution lines will \nbe  installed,  mostly  pole-mounted  transformers  will  be  added,  and  no  new  substations  will  be \nbuilt.  Waste  generated  will  be  minimized  and  contain  no  hazardous  materials.  PLN  also \n\n                                                 \n21 Subsidy as percentage of total revenue: 5.6% in 2004 and 49.6% in 2008. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 19\n\nconfirmed  that  no  circuit  breakers  and  capacitors  will  be  decommissioned  under  the  Project. \nSuch  activities  do  not  require  UKL/UPL  (environmental  management  certificate)  according  to \nthe  Government's  AMDAL  or  environmental  impact  assessment  process  law.  The  Project  is \nassessed environment category C, and as such, according to ADB's Environment Policy (2002) \nand  Operations  Manual  Section  F1/OP  (2006),  an  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  (EIA)  or \nInitial Environmental Examination (IEE) is not required.  \n \n\n2. \n\nResettlement  \n\n76. \nThe  Project  will  not  involve  any  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  All  rehabilitation \nactivities  will  be  undertaken  on  land  already  owned  or  leased  by  PLN  or  within  premises  of \nexisting facilities. Idle land owned by the Government is often occupied by squatters, but PLN \nhas  confirmed  that  no  such  cases  are  involved  in  this  project.  PLN  also  confirmed  that  the \nproject activities in central and east Java will not involve any involuntary resettlement.  \n \n77. \nADB's Project Appraisal Mission visited both of these sites and confirmed this claim. On \nthe basis that no resettlement impacts are envisaged, the resettlement impact of the Project will \nbe category C and therefore no resettlement plan is required. If the Project changes and needs \nto be recategorized, a resettlement plan will be prepared at that time.  \n \n\n3. \n\nSocial Aspects \n\nSustainability \n\n \n78. \nThe  Project  will  not  have  any  negative  impact  on  ethnic  minority  groups;  overall  the \neffects  will  be  significantly  positive  because  customers  from  all  ethnic  groups  will  benefit  from \nthe  Project.  Therefore,  ADB's  indigenous  peoples  policy  will  not  be  triggered.  Appendix  13 \nprovides a summary poverty reduction and social strategy.  \n \nD. \n \n79. \nThe Project covers investments and activities that are part of the core business activities \nof a power distribution business. PLN has the technical ability to maintain its network and has \nplans for it. Financing is also not constrained as the Government has been providing subsidies \nwhich  consistently  cover  the  shortfall  in  revenue.  The  only  remaining  risk  is  high  oil  prices  in \nfuture if the reliance on oil continues.  \n \nE. \n\nRisks \n\n \n80. \nThis Project involves no new technology and PLN has all the necessary skills to design \nand  implement  the  project  components,  making  it  a  less  risky  project  in  terms  of  design  and \nimplementation.  \n \n81. \nLack  of  power  generation  in  the  system  is  a  risk.  Distribution  investment  alone  will  not \nimprove  power  supply  reliability  and  quality  unless  there  is  sufficient  power  to  distribute. \nHowever,  PLN's  efforts  to  mobilize  financing  from  both  internal  and  external  resources  is \nshowing  results,  as  about  2,500  MW  of  additional  generation  capacity  in  Java  will  be \ncommissioned between 2010 and 2012. PLN has also identified the following specific risks: (i) a \nstronger growth of electricity demand would result in an overuse of existing equipment (reducing \nits lifespan), (ii) a worsening financial situation would exist if revenues are lower than expected \nbecause  of  delay  in  the  payment  of  subsidies  by  the  Government,  and  (iii)  insufficient \ninvestment  from  IPPs  would  delay  the  much-needed  investments  in  generation.  PLN  has \nestablished  the  following  mitigation  measures:  (i)  investments  to  rehabilitate  and  optimize  the \n\n\f  \n\n20 \n \n\ndistribution  network  to  reduce  overloading  and  promote  demand  management  to  reduce \ndemand;  (ii)  arrangements  to  raise  capital  from  the  market  and  through  borrowing  so  that \ninvestments  can  be  implemented  in  a  timely  manner;  and  (iii)  the  introduction  of  higher  tariffs \nand terms to secure primary energy requirements through long-term contracts, etc. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\nIn  addition  to  standard  assurance,  the  Government  and  PLN  have  given  the  following \n\n82. \nproject-specific assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\nThe Government and PLN will ensure that throughout the implementation of the \nProject,  adequate  budgetary  allocation  of  the  required  counterpart  funds  are \napproved  and  released  in  a  timely  manner  to  ensure  proper  implementation  of \nthe Project. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n  \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\n \n(vii) \n\n \n\nThe Government and PLN will ensure that the implementation of the Project will \n(a)  be  conducted  in  a  manner  that  will  not  cause  any  adverse  environmental \nimpact,  and  (b)  comply  with  the  Government\u2019s  environmental  laws  and \nregulations, and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002).  \n\nThe Government and PLN will ensure that the implementation of the Project will \nnot  require  any  land  acquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement.  Nevertheless,  in \nthe  event  that  any  project-related  activity  will  cause  land  acquisition  and/or \ninvoluntary  resettlement,  the  Government  and  PLN  will  promptly  prepare  a \nInvoluntary \nresettlement  plan  and  other  requirements  set  out \nResettlement Policy (1995).  \n\nin  ADB's \n\nPLN will perform all actions necessary to ensure that, beginning 1 January 2012, \nit will achieve a self-financing ratio of at least 15% (fifteen percent) and produce, \nfor  each  of  its  fiscal  years  after  fiscal  year  ending  on  31  December  2011,  cash \nfrom  internal  sources  equivalent  to  not  less  than  15%  (fifteen  percent)  of  the \nannual  average  of  PLN's  capital  expenditures  incurred,  or  expected  to  be \nincurred, for that year and the succeeding fiscal years. \n\nPLN will perform all actions necessary to ensure that, (a) it will not incur any \ndebt,  unless  its  net  revenues  for  the  twelve  (12)  months  prior  to  the  date  of \nsuch  incurrence  will  be  at  least  1.2  times  for  the  period  beginning  1  January \n2011  and  at  least  1.5  times  for  the  period  beginning  1  January  2012,  of  its \nestimated maximum debt service requirements for any succeeding fiscal year \non all its debt, including the debt to be incurred \n\nPLN will maintain, for its fiscal year ending on (a) 31 December 2011, a ratio of \ntotal operating expenses to total operating revenue not higher than 87% (eighty \nseven percent), and (b) 31 December 2012, a ratio of total operating expenses to \ntotal operating revenue not higher than 80% (eighty percent). \n\nBy  July  2010,  PLN  will  publicly  disclose  on  its  website  the  breakdown,  by \ncustomer class, of its cost of its electricity supply for fiscal year 2009 into three \n(3)  components,  namely  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  and  make \nsimilar disclosure in July of the succeeding years for the relevant fiscal year. \n\n\f \n\n \n83. \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n 21\n\n(viii)  The  Government  and  PLN  will  continue  their  cost  reduction  initiatives  by \nchanging  the  generation  mix  and  improvement  of  energy  efficiency.

Geographically,  Indonesia  is  unique  with  its \nhuge number of islands and vast coastlines. About 65% of the population of the island of Java \nlives  in  coastal  regions,  making  them  vulnerable  to  the  effects  of  sea-level  rise.  Indonesian \nislands  are  vulnerable  to  earthquakes  and  high  waves  because  of  their  geographic  location\u2014\nsituated  between  shelves  of  the  Asian  landmass  and  the  combined  Australian  and  New \nGuinean  landmass.  Indonesia's  forest  areas  are  also  prone  to  natural  disasters,  and  volcanic \nand tectonic earthquakes and tsunamis are fairly common. In addition, the islands are subject to \nextreme weather events such as long dry seasons and floods. \n \n2. \nIndonesia is vulnerable to the threat of climate change, and therefore it is important that \nit takes part in the global effort to mitigate global warming and climate change. Indonesia plans \nto  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  from  the  energy  sector,  land  use,  land-use  change,  and \nforestry. It also plans to invest in carbon sequestration-related activities. The Government plans \nto work with its bilateral and multilateral partners to tackle the threat of climate change. \n \nB. \n\nContributions to Emissions and the Clean Development Mechanism \n\n1. \n\nEmissions and Energy Sector \n\nIndonesia\u2019s  emissions  per  capita  have  grown  almost  150%  since  the  1980s,  and  67% \n3. \nsince  1990  (World  Resource  Institute1,  2007).  Up  to  56.5%  of  annual  carbon  dioxide  (CO2) \nemissions  are  from  the  burning  of  oil,  followed  by  coal  (25%)  and  gas  (18.5%).2  In  2003,  the \nMinistry  of  Energy  and  Mineral  Utilization  published  a  report  which  stated  that  the  annual \nemission is 243 million tons of CO2 (Pusat Informasi Energi, 2005). In 2004, total CO2 emissions \nfrom the energy sector were 275.37 million tons of CO2. The largest share of CO2 emission from \nthe energy sector in Indonesia (about 40% of the average annual emissions in 2004) was from \nindustry. This was followed by electricity plant (27%), transportation (23%), and household and \ncommercial use (10%).3 To meet the demand, Indonesia plans to rapidly expand the use of coal \nfor  power  generation,  including  building  more  than  10,000  megawatts  (MW)  of  new  coal-fired \npower generation capacity. The expanded used of coal will significantly increase the emission of \npollutant such as sulfur oxide, nitrous oxide, and particulate matter. \n \n\n2. \n\nClean Development Mechanism and Government's Action \n\n4. \nIndonesia  ratified  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change \n(UNFCCC) through Act No.6, in 1994, and in 2004 it ratified the Kyoto Protocol through Act No. \n17.  The  Ministry  of  Environment  established  Indonesia\u2019s  designated  national  authority  in  July \n2005.  Several  consultation  meetings  with  ministries,  the  private  sector,  and  nongovernment \norganizations have been conducted. The main ministries related to the CDM are the Ministry of \nEnvironment,  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mineral  Resources,  Ministry  of  Forestry,  Ministry  of \nTransportation and Communication, Ministry of Industry and Trade, and Ministry of Agriculture. \n \n\n                                                 \n1 Climate Analysis Indicators Tool (CAIT). Available: http://cait.wri.org/ \n2  Indonesia and Climate Change: current status and policies. Jakarta, 2007.  \n3 Energy statistic (year 2005) from the Energy Information Center, Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n25\n\n3. \n\nProject  Registered  by  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on \nClimate Change for Indonesia  \n\n5. \nIndonesia\u2019s  CDM  progress  is  rather  slow  compared  to  other  countries,  such  as  the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China  and  India.  There  are  24  projects  in  Indonesia  registered  with  the \nexecutive board of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), \nwith total emission reductions of 9,085,392 tons of CO2 equivalent (tCO2eq) by 2012, and 127 \nprojects  are  at  or  beyond  the  validation  stage.  Most  of  the  registered  projects  are  in  the \nrenewable energy and waste sectors\u2014seven are biomass projects, five are biogas projects, and \ntwo  are  energy  efficiency  projects.  By  comparison,  India  has  420  registered  projects  which \ngenerate 237,934,238 tCO2eq of emission reduction, while the People\u2019s Republic of China has \n530 registered projects which account for 869,778,233 tCO2eq of emission reduction. \n \nC. \n\nSustainability and Energy Sector Emissions  \n\nAccording  to  a  Government  study,4  the  business-as-usual  scenario  could  see  annual \n6. \nCO2  emissions  from  the  energy  sector  in  Indonesia  reach  1,200  million  tons  by  2025.  With \ndiversification  of  energy  sources  (the  target  for  new  and  renewable  energy  is  17%  of  national \nenergy  composition)  and  conservation  efforts,  the  CO2  emission  reduction  target  from  the \nbusiness-as-usual  scenario  is  17%.  If  nuclear  electric  power  generation  exceeds  the \nPresidential  Instruction  target  of  2%  and  reaches  11.5%,  CO2  emissions  could  be  reduced \nfurther by 20%. Optimizing geothermal electric power to 8.4% of national energy could reduce \nthe  figure  further  by  23%,  while  implementing  carbon  capture  and  storage  technology  will \nreduce the figure by 40% of CO2 emissions in 2025. \n \n7. \nThe  government  supports  three  mitigation  efforts:  (i)  energy  diversification,  (ii)  energy \nconservation,  and  (iii)  implementation  of  clean  technology  (such  as  carbon  capture  and \nstorage). Solutions that could be immediately implemented are energy diversification, renewable \nenergy,  and  energy  conservation.  Energy  conservation  would  cover  (i)  disseminating \ninformation  about  energy  conservation  to  energy  consumers;  (ii)  introducing  incentives  and \ndisincentives through financial mechanisms; (iii) regulating to implement energy conservation by \nall  users  and  implement  an  energy  saving  standard;  (iv)  reducing  energy  intensity,  including \nimplementing  carbon  labeling  in  industry;  (v)  utilizing  science  and  technology  to  develop \nfunctional,  efficient,  and  good  quality  products;  and  (vi)  formulating  and  implementing  energy-\nsaving building standards. \n \nThe National Energy Conservation Master Plan5 quantifies the energy savings potential \n8. \nas  15%\u201330%  for  the  industry  sector,  25%  for  the  transportation  sector,  and  10%\u201330%  for \nhouseholds  and  commercial  buildings.  The  Government  expects  that  Indonesia  could  save \nabout 10\u201330% overall through conservation. Therefore, the demand-side management, with the \nobjective of increasing energy consumers' awareness of conservation and energy efficiency, is \ngiven priority in national energy management. \n\n                                                 \n4 Republic of Indonesia. 2007.

It  has  large  reserves  of  oil,  gas,  and \n1. \ncoal,  and  it  is  the  world's  largest  liquefied  natural  gas  producer.  Indonesia  had  4.3  billion \nbarrels1 of proven oil reserves as of January 2007, however production has decreased over the \nlast  decade  because  of  declining  output  from  mature  oil  fields,  lack  of  investments  in \nmaintaining  existing  oil  wells,  and  lack  of  new  exploration.  Indonesia  was  the  only  Southeast \nAsian  country  to  join  the  Organization  of  the  Petroleum  Exporting  Countries  in  1962,  but \nwithdrew its membership as it became a net oil importer in 2008. Because of its abundance of \nfossil fuel reserves, the economy has always been energy-intensive compared with those of its \nneighbors.  \n \n2. \nIndonesian  power  sector  is  vertically  integrated,  and  the  state-owned  power  utility,  PT \nPerusahaan  Listrik  Negara  (State  Electricity  Corporation  [PLN]),  is  responsible  for  developing \nand  operating  the  sector.  PLN  started  its  power  business  in  1965  with  about  300  megawatts \n(MW) of power generation capacity and in 2008 it supplied electricity to 34 million customers for \ntotal revenue of $15.5 billion. PLN directly employs about 25,000 people. While PLN maintains \nits geographical monopoly in power transmission and distribution, it shares its power generation \nwith  27  privately  owned  independent  power  producers  and  about  5,500  captive  power  plants \nthat supply power to PLN under retail contract. In addition, various electricity cooperatives own \nand operate power generation capacity in islands other than Java and Bali.  \n \n\n1. \n\nPLN and Its Power System \n\n3. \nIn  2008,  the  total  power  generating  capacity,  including  captive  generation,  was  about \n36,500  MW,  of  which  PLN  and  the  independent  power  producers  owned  29,000  MW.  Almost \nthree-quarters  of  PLN\u2019s  generating  capacity  is  located  in  the  Java\u2013Bali  system,  with  the  rest \nspread  over  600  isolated  systems  in  the  islands  outside  Java\u2013Bali.  Despite  the  Government's \nvarious  initiatives  to  diversify  the  generation  mix,  expensive  fuel  oil  continues  to  be  the \ndominant2  fuel  for  power  generation.  The  power  sector  is  also  a  major  contributor  to  carbon \ndioxide (CO2) emissions.  \n \n4. \nThe  islands  of  Java  and  Bali  account  for  about  80%  of  Indonesia's  total  power \nconsumption,  servicing  the  needs  of  60%  of  the  total  population,  or  about  140  million  people. \nThe Java\u2013Bali grid is fully interconnected by 70 kilovolt (kV), 150 kV, and 500 kV transmission \nlines, and has a peak demand of 16,300 MW. The peak demand load is expected to grow by an \naverage annual rate of 9.4% up to 2030. The current installed capacity of 22,336 MW in Java\u2013\nBali, including about 3,865 MW from the independent power producers, is not adequate to meet \ndemand  growth  because  of  transmission  constraints.  Hence,  the  Java\u2013Bali  grid  needs  about \n2,500 MW of additional generating capacity each year to meet the forecast demand.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1 Source: Energy Information Association. Available http://www.eia.doe.gov/cabs/Indonesia/Oil.html \n2  Fuel  oil  represents  25%  of  generation  in  2008,  down  from  36%  in  2007  as  a  result  of  high  oil  prices.  In  2008, \n\nhowever, oil represented about 57% of PLN's cost of power generation.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n27\n\nTable A3.1: PLN's Power Generation Capacity, MW \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTotal \n\n3,438 \n\n4,007 \n2,136 \n\n4,891 \n2,136 \n\nJava-Bali \n2,386 \n\nOutside Java \n1,052 \n \n884 \n0 \n \n0 \n1,100 \n0 \n40 \n659 \n2,602 \n6,337 \n576 \n6,913 \n\nPower Plant \n% \nHydro \n11.8 \nCombine \n \n- Gas Fire \n16.8 \n- Oil Fired \n7.3 \nSteam \n \n- Gas Fire \n3.4 \n- Oil Fired \n6.5 \n- Coal \n18.9 \nGeothermal \n1.4 \nGas Turbine \n9.4 \nDiesel \n9.2 \nSubtotal \n84.8 \nIPP \n15.2 \n100.0 \n    Total \nMW = megawatts, PLN = PT (Persero) Perusahaan Listrik Negara (State \nElectricity Corporation) \nSource: PLN \n\n1,000 \n800 \n5,520 \n360 \n2,086 \n76 \n18,371 \n3,865 \n22,236 \n\n1,000 \n1,900 \n5,520 \n400 \n2,745 \n2,678 \n24,708 \n4,441 \n29,149 \n\n \n\n5. \nPLN  serves  customers  over  a  large  area  which  stretches  more  than  3,000  kilometers \n(km) from east to west with 31,600 circuit-km of transmission lines and about 566,000 circuit-km \nof medium- and low-voltage distribution lines. In 2008, total transmission and distribution losses \nwere 10.6%, of which 8.4% was distribution loss. The power transmission loss is relatively low \nin  Indonesia  as  its  power  generation  facilities  are  located  close  to  the  load  centers.  The \ndistribution losses vary across the region: 9.3% in west Java, 10.1% in Jakarta, 7.2% in central \nJava, 8.1% in east Java, and 7.4% in Bali. In 2008, the system average interruption frequency \nindex  (SAIFI,  the  commonly  used  power  supply  reliability  indicator)  also  varied  significantly \nacross the region: 4.7 in west Java, 6.1 in Jakarta, 12.7 in central Java, 3.9 in east Java, and \n7.5 in Bali. A technical assessment of PLN's regional distribution network is in Supplementary \nAppendix C.   \n \n\n2. \n\nLegal Regulatory Framework  \n\n6. \nThe  Electricity  Act  (Law  No.  15  of  1985)  sets  out  the  overall  legal  framework  for  the \nsector.  The  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mineral  Resources  is  responsible  for  power  sector \ndevelopment policies and discharges its control and regulatory functions through the Directorate \nGeneral for Electricity and Energy Utilization (DGEEU). The DGEEU is also the sector regulator, \nand its role is to (i) ensure achievement of the National General Plan for Electricity; (ii) formulate \nsector policy and strategy; (iii) optimize the utilization of various energy sources; (iv) establish \nand develop electricity supply, utilization, and operational management; (v) regulate the selling \nprice of electricity subject to parliamentary approval; and (vi) facilitate private investment.  \n \nThe Energy Law  No. 30 of August 2007 created a National Energy Council chaired by \n7. \nthe  President  with  the  authority  to  design  and  formulate  energy  policy  on  behalf  of  the \nGovernment; the policy then must be endorsed by Parliament. The main provisions of the law \nare: (i) increase utilization of new renewable energy, (ii) development of incentives for promoting \nrenewable energy and energy efficiency, (iii) market based pricing for energy, and (iv) targeted \nsubsidies  for  low  income  customers.  The  law  also  requires  synchronization  of  national  and \nregional plans, and encourages research and development in energy.  \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n8. \nIn September 2009, a new electricity law was passed, which enables local authorities in \nthe  country  to  provide  electricity  to  their  region  from  private  companies,  bypassing  PLN's \nnetworks. Although the state-owned companies will have the right of first refusal to develop new \npower generation projects, the local authorities will be able to approve new projects and private \npower producers will be allowed to propose tariffs reflecting the true cost of power generation. \nThe  new  law  will  also  (i)  abolished  the  uniform  postage  stamp  pricing3  and  allows  electricity \ntariffs  to  be  determined  by  the  cost  of  generation  in  each  region;  (ii)  developed  a  role  for \nregional governments in setting regional power tariffs; and (iii) allows for a higher price for better \npower supply quality and reliability. \n \nB. \n\nFuture of the Power Sector and Sector Projections  \n\n1. \n\nPower Demand \n\n9. \nElectricity demand is growing in various regions of the country at between 7% and 9%. \nThe DGEEU and PLN predict that this demand growth will continue at an average of about 9.7% \nto 2018. Given this rapid growth rate and declining performance of PLN\u2019s aging power plants, \nlow reserve margins are already causing supply problems, and most regions are experiencing \nload  shedding  and  blackouts.  PLN\u2019s  operational  assets \ninclude  44,258  circuit-km  of \ntransmission lines, substation capacity of 103 megavolt-amperes (MVA), and medium- and low-\nvoltage  lines  totaling  397,030  circuit-km.  Outside  Java\u2013Bali  the  geographical  features  (islands \nand inhabited forests) have resulted in fragmented power supply grids, some with a capacity of \nonly  about  10  MW.

SECTOR ROAD MAP \n \n\nA. \n\nTariff and Subsidy Issues \n\nIndonesia has one of the lowest electricity tariffs in Asia. Electricity tariffs have remained \n1. \nthe same since 2003, although the cost of supply has more than doubled from $0.056 to $0.132 \nper kilowatt-hour (kWh) between 2004 and 2008. In real terms, the tariffs have actually reduced1 \nby  about  50%  between  2003  and  2009,  while  over  the  same  period  tariffs  for  residential \ncustomers  in  countries  across  the  region  have  increased\u201433%  in  the  Philippines,  20%  in \nMalaysia, 18% in Viet Nam, and 11% in Singapore.  \n \n2. \nDespite  the  low  tariffs,  PT  Perusahaan  Listrik  Negara  (State  Electricity  Corporation \n[PLN])  has  remained  financially  viable  because  of  direct  subsidies  from  the  Government. \nSubsides are an integral part of PLN\u2019s operation, and a key element for its financial viability. For \nexample,  in  2008  from  a  typical  residential  customer  consuming  about  100  kWh/month  PLN \nreceived about $5 as revenue, which is less than half the overall cost of production and supply \nof about $13; Government subsidy would have paid for the gap of about $8. A customer with the \nsame consumption would have paid about $18 in Manila and about $13 in Singapore. While a \ndirect subsidy has made PLN financially viable and sustainable, the Government has struggled \nwith these subsidy commitments, especially in 2008 when the subsidy level reached about $7.6 \nbillion (up from $315 million in 2004) because of record high international oil prices.  \n \n3. \nThe fuel subsidy was originally designed to shield low-income groups from the impacts \nof  the  high  oil  price,  but  over  time  it  has  benefited  all  users.  Based  on  government  data,  the \n40%  of  high-income  earners  receive  70%  of  the  subsidy,  and  the  40%  of  poor  families\u2014the \nintended recipients\u2014receive only 15%. The subsidies have created a vicious circle\u2014every time \nthe price of oil increases, PLN cost of generation in its oil plants increases, forcing it to delay its \npreventive maintenance, which in turn increases losses, increasing the need for more subsidies. \nThe  subsidy  in  2008  would  have  been  about  $13  billion  if  the  entire  population  had  access  to \nelectricity.  \n \n4. \nIn  April  2008,  the  Government  introduced  a  penalty  (or  discount)  mechanism  for \nconsumption  above  (or  below)  the  agreed  threshold  within  a  tariff  class.  This  initiative  for \nreducing  subsidies  was  introduced  for  large  residential  customers;  it  also  demonstrated  the \nGovernment's  appreciation  of  the  need  for  across-the-board  tariff  increases  for  PLN.  Overall, \nthe financial impact of this initiative was insignificant considering the compound effects of input \nprice increases. Nevertheless, the Government recognizes that restoring PLN\u2019s financial viability \nin the medium term is crucial to enhancing its creditworthiness and avoiding requests by IPPs \nand their lenders for government guarantees against this off-take risk. PLN has published on its \nwebsite  a  breakdown  of  the  2007  public  service  obligation  (PSO)  by  region  and  customer \ncategory. A  new practice to be adopted by PLN will involve greater coordination and dialogue \nwith other Government agencies to develop a 3-year PSO plan to be published on its website. \nThis  will  be  closely  monitored  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mineral \nResources, Ministry of Planning, and other government departments. \n \n5. \nThe  Government  is  cognizant  of  the  need  to  target  subsidies.  In  2008,  residential \ncustomers received 50% of all subsidies, followed by industry customers (32%) and commercial \ncustomers  (12%).  Within  the  residential  customer  group,  only  36%  went  to  customers  who \n\n                                                 \n1  The Indonesian consumer price index increased to161.73 in 2008 from 105.65 in 2003. Source: Statistics \n\nIndonesia. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n31\n\nconsumed small amounts of electricity. These low-consumption residential customers only paid \n10%\u201320% of the cost of supply.  \n \n6. \nIndonesia  became  a  net  importer  of  oil  in  2005  due  to  natural  maturation  of  producing \nfields combined with slower reserve replacement rates. The Government increased domestic oil \nprices by 49% in March 2005 and 105% in October 2005. The price of high-speed diesel tripled \nfrom Rp1,650 per liter in 2004 to Rp5,000 per liter in 2006, making diesel-fuelled generation of \nelectricity  extremely  costly  at  about  $0.22/kWh.  The  Government  has  deferred  electricity  tariff \nincreases since late 2003, opting to heavily subsidize electricity tariffs until social and economic \nconditions  allow  resumption  of  appropriate  cost-recovery  tariff  adjustments.  The  average \nelectricity  tariff  was  increased  by  29%  in  April  2000,  17%  in  July\u2013October  2001,  and  through \nquarterly adjustments of 6% during 2002\u20132003. These increases brought the average tariff from \nabout  $0.025/kWh  in  1998  to  $0.068/kWh  in  late  2003,  but  no  further  tariff  increases  have \nsubsequently been approved. The average cost of generation is about $0.09/kWh in the Java\u2013\nBali  grid  and  considerably  higher  in  the  outer  islands  where  generation  is  mainly  provided  by \ndiesel units.   \n \nB. \n\nSector Reform and Policy Issues  \n\n7. \nAt  the  Consultative  Group  on  Indonesia  meeting  in  January  2005,  the  Government \nasked  ADB  to  provide  medium-term  support  for  infrastructure  reforms  and  thereby  help \nimplement the country's medium-term development plan. This request led to an intensification of \nADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government  and  other  development  partners.  ADB,  the  Japan \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency,  and  the  World  Bank  jointly  prepared  six  policy  briefs  on \nissues and constraints facing the main infrastructure sectors (including the power sector) and on \nreforms  needed  to  address  them.  Building  on  these  efforts,  the  Government  took  a  range  of \ncritical steps to set the pace for reforms. In February 2006, it released the infrastructure policy \npackage  and  this  resulted  in  the  Infrastructure  Reform  Sector  Development  Program  (IRSDP) \nloan series consisting of three subprograms starting in 2006 and ending in 2010. Looking at the \npower  sector  alone,  the  IRSDP  includes  eight  policy  actions  leading  to  20  outputs  to  be \nachieved during the 5-year program cycle.  \n \nThe reforms for the power sector are challenging but progress has been achieved under \n8. \nthe first two subprograms (the second one was approved in November 2008) with the third one \nscheduled for completion in the third quarter of 2010. This policy loan mandates an active and \nongoing  dialogue  between  the  Government  and  ADB,  and  is  conditional  on  progress  being \nmade.  Therefore,  ADB,  together  with  the  DGEEU,  PLN,  and  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mineral \nResources, frequently discusses the policy actions and the progress. A summary of the power \nsector reforms included under the IRSDP is in Table A4.1. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nTable A4.1: Targeted Power Sector Reforms by ADB under the Infrastructure Reform \nSector Development Program \n \n\nPolicy Action \nPolicy Action No. 1 \nUndertake long-term planning for the \npower sector in terms of physical \nexpansion, service coverage, and \nsector restructuring \n\nPolicy Action No. 2 \nAdopt a legal framework for the energy \nsector that ensures energy security \nthrough diversification of energy \nsources and energy conservation \nPolicy Action No. 3 \nRevise the legal framework for the \npower sector to remove uncertainty \ncaused by the annulment of Law \n20/2002 on electricity by the \nConstitutional Court \nPolicy Action No. 4 \nStrengthen PLN\u2019s institutional structure \nand capacity in the areas of project \nplanning and implementation, financial \nmanagement, and corporate  \ngovernance \nPolicy Action No. 5 \nAdopt appropriate tariff policy for PLN \ncustomers in line with the cost recovery \nprinciple outlined in Presidential \nRegulation 67/2005 (this refers to \ncooperation between Government and \nprivate sector) \n\nPolicy Action No. 6 \nAdopt regulatory arrangements for the \npower sector that are consistent with \nthe new legal framework and aim at \neconomic regulation \nPolicy Action No. 7 \nReview the current PSO policy for the \npower sector to make it affordable for \nthe poor, and to increase PSP and \nservice coverage \nPolicy Action No. 8 \nImprove the investment climate for \nindependent power producers \n\nImplementation Status \n1.

The World  Bank program also calls \nfor reforms in the power sector, and policy actions are outlined in Table A4.2. \n \n\nTable A4.2: Targeted Power Sector Reforms by the World Bank under the Infrastructure \nDevelopment Policy Loan \n\nCompleted in 2008  \n\nImplementation Status \nCompleted in 2007 \n\nPolicy Action \nPolicy Action No. 1 \nPublication of breakdown of the 2006 PLN PSO \ncompensation payment by region and customer category \n(updated based on audit by Supreme Audit Agency) \nPolicy Action No. 2 \nPublication of the 2007 PLN PSO by region and consumer \ncategory; and publication of a forward 3-year PLN PSO plan \nintegrating electrification, investment, and fuel assumptions \nPolicy Action No. 3 \nPublication of a 3-year PLN PSO forecast, based upon \nassumptions and a model shared and agreed upon by \nMEMR, MOF, Ministry of State-Owned Enterprises, and PLN \nPolicy Action No. 4 \nReview of basic electricity tariff and level and coverage of \nsubsidy \nPolicy Action No. 5 \nIncrease from 44% to 70% the proportion of PLN PSO \nreceived by residential consumers with connections of less \nthan 900 volt-amperes \nPLN = PT (Persero) Perusahaan Listrik Negara (State Electricity Corporation), PSO = public service obligation.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank \n \nC. \n\nScheduled for completion in 2010 \n\nRoad Map for the Sector  \n\nTo be completed in 2010 \n\nCompleted in 2009 \n\n10. \nThe  sector  strategy  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  plan  to  target  subsidies  more \naccurately  based  on  affordability  by  consumer  groups,  and  help  the  Government  to  establish \ncredible  and  effective  regulatory  bodies  responsible  for  overseeing  the  setting  of  electricity \ntariffs  and  ensuring  that  the  electricity  tariff  balances  the  needs  of  the  public  and  private \ninvestors.  On  the  conventional  energy  side,  the  medium-term  strategy  will  be  to  attract  more \nprivate  investors  for  generation  through  improved  regulatory  certainty  and  clearly  targeted \nsubsidies,  which  will  be  equally  passed  to  the  operators\u2014private  or  publicly  owned\u2014that  are \nasked  to  meet  PSO  obligations.  Support  for  developing  clean  coal,  coal-based  methane,  and \ncoal-mine  methane  generation  will  be  a  priority.  The  transmission  sector  will  cover  new \ntransmission lines to remove transmission bottlenecks and improve connectivity across regions \nto  deliver  power  at  least  cost.  Distribution  network  investment  will  target  rehabilitation  of  old \ndistribution networks. Off-grid distribution will be used for isolated remote areas, making power \naccessible to the rural poor. Maximum support will be given to regions experiencing electricity \ncrises  where  power  rehabilitation  and  re-powering  generation  will  bring  rapid  benefits. \nIncentives will be established for captive power producers and for PLN to enter into load-sharing \ncontracts to use surplus captive power.  \n \n11. \nAggressive energy efficiency programs and demand-side management initiatives are the \npaths  that  offer  most  hope  in  the  meantime  for  easing  the  power  shortages  at  an  affordable \ncost. Six building blocks will be used to streamline action and plans for energy efficiency: \n\n \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\nPromote  efficient  lighting  in  all  areas.  Promote  use  of  compact  fluorescent \nlighting for all residential customers, especially the poor customers in rural areas; \nimprove  the  overall  quality  of  compact  fluorescent  lamps  (CFLs)  through  better \nlabeling and monitoring; improve efficiency in public lighting; and make financing \navailable for efficient public lighting programs. \n\nDevelop  appliance  and  equipment \nlabeling  and  minimum  energy \nperformance  standards.  Implement  mandatory  labeling  for  all  household \nappliances,  establish  testing  laboratories  for  certification  and  monitoring,  and \nreduce standby losses.  \n\nMake  buildings  more  energy  efficient.  Establish  minimum  performance \nstandards  for  new  and  renovated  buildings,  revise  residential  and  commercial \nbuilding  codes  for  better  lighting  and  heat  management,  develop  minimum \nenergy performance standards integrated into the mandatory product quality and \nsafely  standards,  and  develop  action  plans  to  improve  energy  efficiency  for \ncommercial  and  government  office  buildings,  especially \nfor \ncentralized airconditioning and cogeneration.  \n\nload-shifting \n\n \n(iv)  Make  power  generation  and  distribution  more  efficient.  Improve  energy \ntransformation losses in generation from an average rate of 40% or lower to the \ninternational  benchmark  of  about  60%,  improve  energy  conversion  efficiency  in \npower  generation  from  an  average  rate  of  40%  or  lower  to  international  best \npractice  of  about  50%,  and  reduce  losses  in  electricity  transmission  and \ndistribution.  \n\nFacilitate  financing  of  energy  efficiency  investments.  Offer  revolving  fund \nand other financing packages for small and medium-sized enterprises, establish \nelectricity  service  companies  for  energy  audit  and  energy  efficiency  programs \nbased  on \nfair  benefits  sharing  schemes,  support  system  and  process \noptimization for industrial projects, develop targeted use of tax benefits for priority \nenergy  efficiency  and  environmental  projects,  promote  certified  energy  efficient \nappliances  and  equipment  using  tax  incentives,  and  develop  appropriate  tariff-\nbased incentives for energy efficiency.  \n\nRaise  energy  efficiency  awareness.  Raise  awareness  of  current  product \nlabeling  to  customers,  especially  policy  makers  and  business  leaders;  develop \neducation and training plans and programs for energy managers in industry and \nutilities; develop teaching aids for primary, secondary, and vocational educational \ncurricula  through  community  programs;  and,  through  cooperation  with  local \ncommunity groups, develop and publish industrial and commercial benchmarking \naudit programs. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n35\n\nDEVELOPMENT COORDINATION \n\nMajor Development Partners: Strategic Foci and Key Activities  \n\n \nA. \n \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  ADB  financed  seven  projects  with  loans  totaling \n1. \n$1,987  million  for  the  energy  sector.  ADB's  supported  strategies  for  competitive  power  sector \nthrough sector restructuring. After the financial crisis that hit Indonesia in 1997, ADB provided \nfive quick-disbursing loans, which included $400 million for two loans for the energy sector with \npurposes  to  (i)  restructure  the  power  sector,  (ii)  develop  a  competitive  electricity  market  with \nmultiple  sellers  and  multiple  buyers  in  the  Java-Bali  region,  and  (iii)  build  capacity  for \nestablishment of competitive electricity markets. In 2002, ADB financed two loans: one loan1 for \nrenewable  energy  development,  which  packaged  a  variety  of  subprojects  (8  miniature \nhydropower  plants,  2  small  hydropower  plants,  2  geothermal  plants);  and  a  second  loan2  for \nexpansion of PLN\u2019s transmission capacity, which are currently under implementation.   \n \n2. \nSince 2005, ADB, joined Japan International Cooperation Agency, and the World Bank \nand have been the Government\u2019s principal development partners in the power sector. Given the \nimportance of power sector reforms for the medium and long term plans of the Government, the \nthree  donors  joined  hands  to  work  on  the  Infrastructure  Reform  Sector  Development  Program \ninitiated  in  2005  and  set  to  be  completed  in  2010  focusing  on  key  policy  action  items \nharmonized into a common agenda covering a review of tariffs, targeted subsidies, possibility of \na  proper  regulator,  and  transparency  in  public-private  partnerships  for  independent  power \nproducer contracts.  \n \nAustralian  Aid (AusAID). The Government of Australia's overseas aid comprehensive \n3. \nplan follows the $1 billion Australia Indonesia Partnership for Reconstruction and Development \nprogram  (AIPRD),  which  articulated  Australia\u2019s \nIndonesia\u2019s \ndevelopment.  Australia  plans  to  incorporate  climate  change  principles  across  the  program. \nIndonesia\u2019s  poor \nAustralia  has  made  small  but  significant  gains \ninfrastructure and low investment in the water and sanitation area, which has been a significant \narea  of  Australia\u2019s  development  assistance  to  Indonesia  since  the  1970s.  It  recently  provided \nADB  $3.5  million\u2013$2.0  million  for  water  and  sanitation  area  and  $1.5  million  for  geothermal \ndevelopment  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  in  the  energy  sector.  Australia\u2019s  primary \nintervention  for  Indonesia  is  to  reduce  greenhouse  emissions  from  deforestation  and  support \nsustainable forest management through the forests and climate initiative. Australia will work with \ngovernments and local communities in Kalimantan to trial approaches to reducing deforestation, \nhelping to cut greenhouse gas emissions. \n \n4. \nAgence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement  (AFD)  financed  a  $500  million  loan  ($200 \nmillion in 2008 and $300 million in 2009) under the umbrella of \u201cClimate Change Program Loan\u201d \njointly  with  the  Government  of  Japan.  The  loan  has  been  disbursed  and  fully  blended  into \nGovernment's  budget.  Its  purpose  is  to  support  policy  reforms  in  favor  of  climate  change \nmitigation  and  adaptation.  The  agreed  policy  matrix  covers  a  range  of  issues:  (i)  reduction  of \nemissions of greenhouse gases (forestry, energy and industry), (ii) adaptation to climate change \n(water and agriculture) and (iii) cross-cutting activities (spatial planning, CDM, etc.). The policy \nmatrix  encompasses  all  expected  regulatory  reforms  and  public  actions  to  tackle  the  threat  of \nclimate change: laws and decrees, pilot projects, master plans, etc.  \n                                                 \n1  ADB  2002.

European Union conducted in December 2009, a national conference \nworkshop  on  Solar  Photovoltaic  development  in  potential  for  Indonesia  including  overview  of \npolicies  on  energy  and  rural  development.  The  scope  covers  development  of  design  of  solar \npower and installation Tool Kit and developing awareness among end users.  \n \n6. \nJapan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). About 26% of Japan's total portfolio \nin  Indonesia  is  for  the  energy  sector;  \u00a5377  billion  of  development  assistance  was  lent  to  the \nsector during 1996\u20132006. Japan has also prepared a geothermal sector master plan, which was \ncompleted in December 2007, and an energy efficiency study, finalized in 2008. Project lending \nby  Japan  has  mainly  focused  on  generation,  including  both  small-scale  geothermal  and  gas-\nfired power plants. In 2009, Japan International Cooperation Agency signed an agreement with \nPLN to finance the $1.8 billion high-voltage direct current link connecting Sumatra with Java to \nmeet the growing demand for power in the Java\u2013Bali grid.  \n \n7. \nWorld  Bank.  The  World  Bank's  strategic  focus  is  on  strengthening  the  technical  and \noperational capacities of the state institutions such as PLN. Together with ADB and Japan, the \nWorld  Bank  is  supporting  effective  targeting  of  electricity  subsidies  and  development  of  a \nsustainable  pricing  policy.  The  policy  loans  of  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  have  the  objective  of \nincreasing  private  investments  in  the  energy  sector  through  public\u2013private  partnerships, \nfocusing  on  clean  and  renewable  energy  projects  (such  as  geothermal  power  investments \ntogether  with  Pertamina  Geothermal  Energy  and  the  $500  million  Upper  Cisokan  pumped \nstorage project), and power transmission and distribution projects including gas distribution.  \n \nInstitutional Arrangements and Processes for Development Coordination  \nB. \n \n \n8. \nThe  government  is  committed  to  mitigating  climate  change  and  has  identified  GHG \nreduction  priorities  in  the  energy  sector,  including  (i)  energy  efficiency,  particularly  in  the \nindustrial sector; (ii) renewable energy for power generation (geothermal, hydro and biomass); \nand (iii) low-carbon transport, especially public transport, vehicle efficiency improvements, and \nclean  fuels.  There  has  also  been  a  reasonable  degree  of  harmonization  of  multilateral  and \nbilateral  assistance  for  geothermal  development.  In  this  respect,  World  Bank,  JICA,  and  KfW \nhave all joined in their efforts to finance a large-scale geothermal power development program. \nThis  includes  (a)  up  to  260  MW  geothermal  power  by  Pertamina  Geothermal  Energy  to  be \nfinanced by the World Bank; (b) up to 250 MW geothermal by PLN to be financed by the ADB; \nand  (c)  private  sector  geothermal  projects  to  be  financed  by  IFC  and  ADB  Private  Sector \nOperations Department.  \n \n9. \nCooperation and harmonization of development partners in the power sectors has been \ngenerally fluid with regular invitations from each of the key players to participate in meetings or \nmissions  and  exchange  of  information  and  documents.  Policy  dialogue  was  undertaken  jointly \non several occasions, which is well received by the Government in light of the Paris Declaration. \n \nC. \n \n10. \nADB's  support  for  clean  development  mechanism  had  been  mostly  in  areas  of \nsupporting  Clean  Development  Mechanism  project  preparation,  capacity  building  and  Clean \nDevelopment Mechanism finance facility. It is working together with the World Bank to finance a \nrange  of  projects  in  the  energy  sector  using  the  Clean  Technology  Fund.

ADB\u2019s single-stage, two-\nenvelope  procurement  procedure,  wherein  bids  with  separate  envelopes  for  technical  and \nfinancial  proposals  are  submitted  simultaneously  will  be  used.  ADB's  and  its  standard  bidding \ndocument will be applicable throughout the project for all ICB packages whilst PLN's or national \nbidding document may be used for the NCB packages provided that they comply with ADB and \nthe  Government  of  Indonesia's  requirements.  The  procurement  committee  will  open  the \ntechnical proposal first and review the responsiveness of the bidding documents. Only financial \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n41\n\nproposals  of  bidders  with  responsive  technical  proposals  will  be  opened  for  evaluation  and \ncomparison.  The  financial  proposals  of  bidders  whose  technical  proposals  are  not  responsive \nwill be returned unopened. All contracts will be awarded following ICB or NCB procedures and \nthe tender documents will be in English. \n\nFor  supplying  the  main  goods  (conductors,  cables,  and  transformers),  PLN  may  use  a \n4. \n\u201cJoint Procurement\u201d platform for bid registration and submission  and one single region will have \nthe  responsibility  to  issue  the  tender  documents,  to  evaluate  the  offers  and  to  choose  the \nselected supplier on a lowest evaluated cost basis at the time financial proposal is opened based \non  the  proposal  submitted  through  single-stage,  two-envelope  procurement  procedure,  after \nchecking  the  technical  specifications  fulfill  the  bidding  documents  requirements.  An  agreement \nwill be signed with the selected manufacturers fixing the unit price of the items. Then each region \nwill  sign  a  contract  with  the  selected  bidders  for  its  specific  needs.  Thus  a  single  tender \ndocument  will  be  issued  for  each  of  the  main  equipment  items,  i.e.;  then  5  contracts  will  be \nsigned between the 5 PLN regions and the selected manufacturers.  \n\n5. \nThe e-procurement procedure presently in service in PLN could be used for the goods to \nbe  supplied  as  per  the  \u201cJoint  Procurement\u201d  system,  provided  that  ADB  single-stage,  two-\nenvelope  procurement  procedure  is  adopted:  (i)  first  the  commercial,  administrative  and \ntechnical  responsiveness  of  the  bidders  is  checked,  and  (ii)  the  financial  proposals  will  be \nopened  only  for  the  responsive  bidders  and  contract  will  be  awarded  to  the  lowest  evaluated \nsubstantially responsive Bid.  \n\n6. \nThe  main  goods  to  be  supplied  following  the  \u201cJoint  Procurement\u201d  procedure  will  be \ngathered  in  four  packages:  underground  and  twisted  MV  cables,  OHL  MV  conductors, \ntransformers.  Each  item  of  each  package  could  be  awarded  to  a  different  manufacturer, \nfollowing the lowest unit price of this item. \n\n7. \nAll  goods  will  comply  with  the  relevant  international  standards.  In  addition  to  the \nprocurement  of  the  main  goods,  the  other  contracts  will  be  Supply  and  construction.    The \ncontractor  will  propose  a  price  including  the  supply  of  the  minor  items  (joints  and  dead-end, \nterminal  boxes  and  warning  screens  for  cables,  poles  and  fitting,  insulators,  fuse  cut-out, \nlightning arresters, connectors, etc) and their installation in the network.  \n\nThe Supply and Construction contracts might be divided into several lots, each of them \n8. \ncould be awarded to a different contractor. The following table, lists preliminary goods and works \ncontracts for which procurement activity is expected to commence within the next 6 months. \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services  \n\n9. \nConsultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  under  the  Project  in  accordance  with  the \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants by Asian Development Bank and its Borrowers (2007, as \namended  from  time  to  time).  An  international  consulting  firm  will  be  engaged  to  manage \nimplementation of the Project.

As shown in Table A10.2, the gap \n3. \nbetween  PLN's  cost  of  supply  and  the  tariff  has  grown  significantly  over  the  last  5  years.  For \nexample, in 2004, the gap for each kWh of Rp33 (cost of Rp582/kWh and tariff of Rp615/kWh), \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n49\n\nincreased  to  Rp692/kWh  (cost  of  Rp1,318/kWh  and  tariff  of  Rp626/kWh)  in  2008.  The  cost  of \nsupply increased because of the higher cost of fuel, as PLN relies on oil-fired plants. However, \nthe  Government  has  increased  subsidies since  2004  to  offset  rising fuel  costs  and  to  maintain \nregulated tariff rates. \n \n\nTable A10.2: Price Gap and Government Subsidies to PLN \n(Rp/kWh) \n2005 \n\n2007 \n\n2006 \n\nUnit \n\nItem \n\n2004 \n(Actual) \n\nGovernment Subsidy \nAverage Price \nCost of Supply \nAverage Subsidy \n\nRp trillion  3.4 \nRp/kWh \n582 \nRp/kWh \n615 \nRp/kWh \n(33) \n\n12.5 \n591 \n726 \n(135) \n\n32.9 \n628 \n925 \n(297) \n\n36.6 \n624 \n934 \n(310) \n\n2008 \n(unaudited) \n83.9 \n626 \n1,318 \n(692) \n\n2009 \n(estimate) \n45.0 \n626 \n1,081 \n(455) \n\n  ( ) = negative.  \n  Source: PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (State Electricity Corporation). \n \nGovernment  Subsidy.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  has  established  the  rules  for  subsidy \n4. \ncalculation  under  the  Government's  PSO  scheme.  The  PSO  amount  is  theoretically  calculated \nusing the following formula:  supply cost + margin (%) = electricity sales revenue + subsidy \n \nThe  supply  cost  of  PLN  covers  (i)  purchase  of  electricity  from  independent  power \n5. \nproducers (IPPs); (ii) fuel and lubricants; (iii) maintenance expense for generation, transmission, \nand  distribution  assets;  (iv)  personnel  expense;  (v)  administrative  expense;  (vi)  depreciation \nexpense;  and  (vii)  interest  expense  and  financing  charges.  A  margin  is  calculated  by  PLN  to \nmeet  PLN's  financial  ratio  covenants,  including  interest  coverage  ratio,  for  its  global  and \ndomestic  bonds,  and  PLN  estimates  the  required  margin  to  be  4.5%  in  2009.  The  subsidy \namount  is  proposed  by  PLN  to  the  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mineral  Resources  as  a  part  of \nGovernment  budget  and  is  approved  by  Parliament.  Ninety  five  percent  of  approved  budget  is \nprovided to PLN monthly and remainder is given to PLN after the state auditor has conducted its \naudit.  As  shown  in  Table  A10.2,  PLN  received  Rp83.9  trillion  in  2008.  In  2009,  PLN  budgeted \nPSO subsidy of Rp45 trillion reflects lower fuel costs than in 2008. \n \n10,000  MW  Fast-Track  Program.  PLN  is  mandated  by  the  Government  to  promote  a \n6. \nfast-track program to develop 10,000 MW of coal-fired plants. As shown in Table A10.3, the cost \nof  oil-fired  plants  is  extremely  high  compared  with  coal-  and  gas-fired  plants.  The  fast-track \nprogram  will  reduce  PLN's  reliance  on  oil  by  replacing  it  with  coal.  PLN  estimates  the  capital \nrequirements  for  the  program  to  be  more  than  $9  billion.  The  fast-track  program  is  being \nimplemented by PLN, which expects to complete the construction of all the projects by FY2011.1 \n \n\nTable A10.3: Variable Costs by Plant Type, 2007 \n \n\n \n\nPlant Type \nThermal \nGas Turbine \nOil-Fired \nMFO = medium fuel oil. \nSource: PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (State Electricity Corporation). \n\n(Rp/kWh) \n263 \n225\u2013387 \n1,859 \n\n \nFuel Type \nCoal \nGas \nOil (MFO) \n\nVariable Cost \n\n(cents/kWh) \n2.89 \n2.45\u20134.26 \n20.42 \n\n                                                 \n1  32 contracts for 10 locations in Java\u2013Bali (7,520 MW) and 22 locations (1,861 MW) outside Java\u2013Bali have been \nsigned  (13  contracts  were  signed  in  2007  and  19  contracts  in  2008).

Following  the  global  financial  crisis  in  late  2008,  the \nrupiah  has  depreciated  by  about  20%  against  the  US  dollar,  from  Rp9,000  to  Rp11,000.  A \nweakening of the rupiah will increase PLN's financial burden, because PLN needs to pay foreign \ncurrency  denominated  expenses  and  debt  services  whereas  its  revenue  is  denominated  in \nrupiah. The PSO subsidy will cover part of the foreign costs, such as fuel, IPP costs, operation \nand maintenance, and interest payments, but PLN has to repay the actual principal of the dollar-\ndenominated loans. About 40% of PLN\u2019s total liabilities are denominated in US dollars and other \nforeign  currencies.  For  the  forthcoming  bond  repayment  in  2011,  PLN  has  set  up  a  hedging \ncommittee  to  mitigate  the  foreign  exchange  fluctuation  risk,  and  has  conducted  a  sensitivity \nanalysis of rupiah depreciation to demonstrate its financial robustness. \n \nD. \n \n9. \nassumptions are that \n \n\nProjected  financial  statements  from  2009  to  2016  are  prepared  by  PLN.

The \ncapital costs for the Java\u2013Bali distribution projects include capacitor banks, medium-voltage and \nlow-voltage  transformers,  distribution  lines,  and  substations.  All  capital  costs  are  expressed  in \nreal terms using constant 2009 prices. The FIRR was calculated on the basis of the base costs, \nexcluding price contingency and financial charges during implementation. \n \n4. \nThe financial benefits were measured by (i) the reduction of distribution loss as a result of \nthe  improved  distribution  system,  and  (ii)  the  incremental  sales  from  the  additional  capacity  of \nthe new distribution system. Loss reduction and incremental sales in kilowatt-hours (kWh) were \ncalculated  by  each  project  component  from  each  PLN\u2019s  regional  office  (Jakarta,  west  Java, \ncentral  Java,  east  java,  and  Bali).  The  calculation  for  kilowatt-hour  savings  was  conducted  by \nusing  a \nincluding  reconductoring, \nformula  by  each  project  component \nreconfiguration,  transformer,  and  capacitor.  The  financial  benefits  from  loss  reduction  were \ncomputed  from  the  volume  of  loss  reduction  from  the  projects  multiplied  by  fuel  costs.  The \nprojected average fuel cost of $0.032/kWh (Rp356/kWh) was used during the period of analysis. \nThe  financial  benefits  from  incremental  sales  were  computed  from  the  volume  of  incremental \nsales from the projects multiplied by a sales margin of Rp46/kWh. \n \nD.  \n \nThe  FIRR  was  calculated  for  the  Java\u2013Bali  distribution  projects.  The  result  of  the \n5. \ncalculation shows that the FIRR is 19.1%. As this is higher than the estimated WACC of 2.0%, \nthe Project is financially viable. \n \nThe robustness of the investment was evaluated by carrying out a sensitivity analysis for \n6. \nchanges \nthe  case  of \noverexpenditure, increase of operation and maintenance costs, and lower benefits in megawatt-\nhours  (MWh).  Details  of  the  FIRR  calculation  and  sensitivity  analysis  are  in  Table  A11.2.  The \nresults  show  that  all  the  tests,  including  the  worst-case  scenario  (combination  of  all  sensitivity \ntests), achieve higher FIRRs than the WACC, and therefore the Project is financially viable. \n \n\nin  major  assumptions.

\n\nThe Project focuses on the efficiency and reliability improvement in the distribution \n1. \nsystem  of  the  five  regions  of  the  Java\u2013Bali  grid:  west  Java  region,  Jakarta  area,  central \nJava  region,  east  Java  region,  and  Bali  distribution  systems.  The  Project  directly \ncontributes  to  the  Indonesian  national  distribution  efficiency  and  reliability  improvement \nprogram.  The  national  program  (also  called  distribution  road  map)  follows  the  five-point \nstrategy  (Straegi  53,  Direksi  No.  003/2005).  These  include  quality  of  materials  and \nconstruction,  protection  system  improvement,  interruption  monitoring  and  evaluation, \nquality  improvement  for  transaction  points,  and  supply  and  improvement  of  distribution \nlosses.  Three  main  objectives  of  distribution  are  achieving  high  reliability,  high  quality  of \nsupply,  and  high  efficiency.  The  distribution  road  map  identifies  indicators  for  each  of \nthese  three  main  objectives:  improvement  in  the  system  average  interruption  duration \nindex (SAIDI) and system average interruption frequency index (SAIFI) for high reliability, \nmaintaining  voltage  and  frequency  within  the  standards  for  high  quality,  and  reducing \nlosses for efficiency. Improved distribution efficiency and reliability in the above-mentioned \nregional  distribution  networks  will  be  achieved  by  installing  capacitors,  reconfiguring  the \ndistribution  systems,  changing  the  conductor  capacity  to  reduce  losses,  and  upgrading \ntransformers  and  medium-voltage  cubicles.  According  to  the  PT  Perusahaan  Listrik \nNegara (State Electricity Corporation [PLN]), the distribution road map has been prepared \nas part of the overall sector plan based on least-cost analysis. The analysis is voluminous \nand is not presented in this paper. \n \n2. \nThe  existing  transmission  system  of  the  Java\u2013Bali  grid  is  already  fully  utilized; \ntherefore,  the  Project  releases  transmission  capacity  to  meet  the  growing  electricity \ndemand.  Additionally,  the  Project  improves  the  reliability  and  quality  of  power  which  has \nsignificant  benefits  for  PLN  customers.  The  Project  will  create  efficient  and  viable \ninfrastructure that improves access to electricity in a region that is experiencing growth in \ndemand.  It  also  saves  foreign  exchange  spent  on  fuel  imports,  and  will  have  a  positive \nimpact on the environment. Overall, the poorer households are more vulnerable to power \noutages  and  thus  indirectly  benefit  more  from  the  Project.  The  cost  and  benefits  of  the \nproject components have been individually estimated and justified at the system level as \nthe least-cost alternatives. \n \nB. \n\nEstimation of Costs \n\n3. \nThe  economic  analysis  assesses  the  economic  viability  of  the  Project  from  the \nsocietal  resource  utilization  perspective.  Such  analysis  compares  the  social  benefits \ngenerated by the Project against its economic costs. The economic analysis compares the \nwith-project and without-project scenarios. The economic analysis is being carried out with \nthe following input information: \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nAll costs are expressed in 2009 prices. \nThe Project is analyzed over a 25-year period and no residual values are \nassumed, making the analysis a conservative estimation of benefits.  \nCapital  costs \ncontingencies and interest during construction. \nCost estimates exclude all taxes and duties.  \n\ninclude  physical  contingencies,  but  exclude  price \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nThere are no nontraded goods in the Project and it is assumed that there \nare  no  significant  distortions  in  the  wage  rate  for  skilled  labor.  The \ncomponent  of  unskilled  labor  is  negligible  in  the  Project.  Therefore,  no \nstandard  conversion  factor  or  shadow  wage  rate  for  unskilled  labor  is \nrequired. \nOperating and maintenance costs are estimated at 2.5% of capital costs \nfor the entire analysis period.  \n\n \nThe  total  project  costs  consist  of  investment  in  the  medium-voltage  and  low-\n4. \nvoltage lines (rewiring, reconductoring, etc.), transformers, and capacitors, and the cost \nof installation and consulting services. The investments are in five distribution branches \nof  PLN  and  the  consulting  services  are  in  PLN  headquarters.

By rewiring and reconfiguring the medium- and \nlow-voltage  networks,  losses  will  be  reduced.  In  addition,  the  systems  after  the  Project \nwith new transformers, new cubicles, etc, will be strengthened, and thus be able to carry \nhigher  loads.  The  benefits  of  the  Project  will  be  evaluated  through  loss  reductions  and \nincreased carrying capacity. The kilowatt-hour (kWh) savings for each of the measures\u2014\nreconfiguring,  reconductoring,  installing  capacitors  to  improve  the  power  factor,  and \nupgrading \nthe  methodologies  and  using \nmathematical  formulae  discussed  in  Supplementary  Appendix  D.  The  physical  benefit  of \nthe Project are the number of kilowatt-hours of loss reduction (saved) and the number of \nkilowatt-hours of increased sales due to the higher carrying capacity of the system. \n \n6. \nThe  economic  value  of  a  kilowatt-hour  saved  due  to  loss  reduction  can  be \nevaluated from the supply and end-use angles. In the without-project situation, the loss is \nheat lost in the system. The value of such heat waste is equivalent to the supply costs of \nthe  lost  kilowatt-hour.  In  the  with-project  situation,  loss  is  reduced.  Moreover,  given  that \nthe Java\u2013Bali grid is fully loaded and utilized, each kilowatt-hour saved is being consumed \nby end users. So the economic value of each kilowatt-hour loss reduction is the value of its \nsupply (which is lost anyway without the Project) and the incremental consumer surplus of \nthe end user who consumes this kilowatt-hour. For the increased sale  due to a stronger \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n57\n\nsystem, the economic value of a kilowatt-hour is the difference between the willingness to \npay and the cost of supply such kilowatt-hour. \n \n7. \nAccording to PLN, the costs of supply of a kilowatt-hour of electricity vary by region \nand  by  delivery  point.  It  is  lower  for  higher-voltage-level  consumers  and  higher  for  low-\nvoltage-level consumers. The true costs of supply in 2008 are in Table A12.2.  \n \n\nTable A12.2: Cost of Electricity Supply at Delivery Point \n(Rp/kWh) \n\n Item \nJakarta \nWest (Bandung) \nCentral (Semarang) \nEast (Surabaya) \nBali \n\nHigh \nVoltage \n783 \n783 \n783 \n783 \n783 \n\nMedium \nVoltage \n850 \n853 \n849 \n855 \n859 \n\nLow \nVoltage \n1005 \n1024 \n1011 \n1030 \n1012 \n\nAverage \n881.0 \n887.2 \n881.4 \n890.0 \n889.6 \n\n \n\nAverage  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n885.84 \n\n \nkWh = kilowatt hour. \nSource: PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (State Electricity Corporation) provincial branches (compiled by the \nAsian Development Bank). \n\n \nIn  addition,  PLN  indicated  that  the  supply  by  captive  producers  is  very  expensive \n8. \nbecause it is based on diesel generators, and ranges from Rp3,000/kWh to Rp3,500/kWh. \nAt  present,  consumers  are  paying  this  high  price  for  captive  power.  Had  there  been \nenough supply, grid the consumers would be using the grid electricity. As consumers are \npaying for the electricity now, this price of captive power represents current willingness to \npay for the electricity. Thus in this economic analysis, the price of captive power is used as \na proxy for the willingness to pay to value increased sales.  \n \nThe  Project  not  only  saves  energy  but  also  improves  the  quality  and  reliability  of \n9. \npower supply. This results in longer life for electrical equipment and uninterrupted power \nsupply. These benefits are greater for poor households as their capacity to invest in back-\nup  power  and  in  voltage  regulation  and  stabilization  equipment  is  lower.  Other  benefits \nthat have not been quantified are the positive environmental impacts of the Project. This is \nparticularly  important  given  that  Java  has  a  high  concentration  of  industry  and  use  of \ncleaner  fuels  will  result  in  better  air  quality  and  fewer  pollution-related  health  impacts. \nOther  indirect  benefits  are  that  the  availability  of  reliable  electricity  supports  industrial \ngrowth, which in turn creates avenues for employment.  \n \nD. \n\nEstimation of Economic Internal Rate of Return \n\nThe  estimation  of  the  project  net  present  value  (NPV)  and  the  economic  internal \n10. \nrate  of  return  (EIRR)  is  carried  out  in  two  cases:  (i)  a  conservative  case,  meaning  only \nloss-reduction  benefits  are  being  monetized;  and  (ii)  increase  of  sales  is  monetized  in \naddition to the loss reduction. For case (i), the Project's EIRR is estimated at 35.9%. The \nnet economic present value at a 12% discount rate is $202 million. Details of flows of costs \nand benefits over the project life are shown in Table A12.3.   \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n11.  When  the  benefits  of  increased  sales  are  added  to  the  benefits  of  loss  reduction, \nthe  economics  of  the  project  become  even  stronger.  With  the  proxy  value  of  increased \nsales  at  almost  Rp1,000/kWh  (the  difference  between  captive  power  price  and  supply \ncost), the EIRR is about 110% and the Project's NPV is $1.4 billion. \n \n \n\nTable A12.3: Economic Analysis for Efficiency Improvement in Distribution \nNetworks \n \n\nBenefits\nIncremental Avoided\n\nLoss\n\nTotal Benefits Benefits\n\nTotal\nCosts\n\n997,321\n4,875\n\nInvestment\nCosts\n\nCosts\nO&M\nCosts\nRp million Rp million Rp million\n1,027,240\n        \n34,941\n            \n30,066\n30,066\n30,066\n30,066\n30,066\n30,066\n30,066\n30,066\n30,066\n30,066\n30,066\n30,066\n30,066\n30,066\n30,066\n30,066\n30,066\n30,066\n30,066\n30,066\n30,066\n30,066\n30,066\n30,066\n\n29,920\n30,066\n30,066\n30,066\n30,066\n30,066\n30,066\n30,066\n30,066\n30,066\n30,066\n30,066\n30,066\n30,066\n30,066\n30,066\n30,066\n30,066\n30,066\n30,066\n30,066\n30,066\n30,066\n30,066\n30,066\n30,066\n\n     \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n\nYear\n0 2010\n1 2011\n2 2012\n3 2013\n4 2014\n5 2015\n6 2016\n7 2017\n8 2018\n9 2019\n10 2020\n11 2021\n12 2022\n13 2023\n14 2024\n15 2025\n16 2026\n17 2027\n18 2028\n19 2029\n20 2030\n21 2031\n22 2032\n23 2033\n24 2034\n25 2035\n\nEIRR\nNPV\n\n35.9%\n1,973,114\n202\n\n     \n               \n\nRp million\n$million\n\nLoss\nreduction\nMWh\n51,102\n383,739\n405,203\n413,231\n421,873\n446,158\n472,554\n503,093\n531,359\n561,457\n586,053\n601,371\n606,792\n606,909\n606,438\n603,261\n599,614\n600,052\n600,208\n598,181\n595,998\n596,573\n598,089\n599,970\n601,555\n602,721\n\n     \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n\nSales\nMWh\n\n           \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n94,980\n569,614\n634,495\n736,847\n854,188\n966,451\n1,066,557\n1,194,278\n1,325,516\n1,466,811\n1,724,297\n2,069,738\n2,434,587\n2,789,797\n3,061,801\n3,348,510\n3,661,961\n3,858,860\n4,024,041\n4,215,559\n4,414,750\n4,606,275\n4,810,146\n5,027,260\n5,234,998\n5,251,383\n\nCosts Reduction\nRp/kWh Rp million Rp million\n45,268\n     \n45,268\n        \n339,931\n339,931\n        \n   \n358,945\n358,945\n        \n   \n366,056\n366,056\n        \n   \n373,712\n373,712\n        \n   \n395,225\n   \n395,225\n        \n418,607\n418,607\n        \n   \n445,660\n445,660\n        \n   \n470,699\n470,699\n        \n   \n497,361\n497,361\n        \n   \n519,149\n   \n519,149\n        \n532,719\n532,719\n        \n   \n537,521\n537,521\n        \n   \n537,625\n537,625\n        \n   \n537,207\n537,207\n        \n   \n534,393\n   \n534,393\n        \n531,162\n531,162\n        \n   \n531,550\n531,550\n        \n   \n531,688\n531,688\n        \n   \n529,893\n529,893\n        \n   \n527,959\n   \n527,959\n        \n528,468\n528,468\n        \n   \n529,811\n529,811\n        \n   \n531,478\n531,478\n        \n   \n532,881\n532,881\n        \n   \n533,914\n   \n533,914\n        \n\n         \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n\n886\n886\n886\n886\n886\n886\n886\n886\n886\n886\n886\n886\n886\n886\n886\n886\n886\n886\n886\n886\n886\n886\n886\n886\n886\n886\n\nNet\n\nRp million\n   \n(981,972)\n    \n304,990\n    \n328,879\n    \n335,990\n    \n343,646\n    \n365,159\n    \n388,542\n    \n415,594\n    \n440,633\n    \n467,295\n    \n489,084\n    \n502,653\n    \n507,455\n    \n507,559\n    \n507,141\n    \n504,327\n    \n501,096\n    \n501,484\n    \n501,622\n    \n499,827\n    \n497,893\n    \n498,403\n    \n499,745\n    \n501,412\n    \n502,815\n    \n503,848\n\n \n\n \n( ) = negative, O&M = operation and maintenance, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present \nvalue.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.\n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                            Appendix 12 \n\n59\n\nE. \n\nSensitivity Analysis \n\n12.  An analysis has been undertaken to test the sensitivity of the estimated EIRR of the \nProject  to  adverse  changes  in  key  variables.  The  key  risk  factors  that  may  affect  the \neconomics  of  the  project  are  cost  overrun  (increase  in  project  costs  as  result  of  bidding \nprocess)  and  reduced  level  of  benefit  realization.  The  benefit  reduction  may  occur \nbecause  (i)  the  calculation  of  increased  sales  assumed  that  all  the  projected  demand \nwould  be  met  after  rehabilitation  of  the  distribution  system,  and  (ii)  lower  generating \ncapacity.  To  test  these  factors,  two  variables  are  designed:  one  related  to  capital  costs \nand one reflecting benefits. These have been done with an increase of 20% in capital and \noperating  and  maintenance  costs,  a  reduction  in  project  benefits  by  40%,  and  a \ncombination of the increase in costs and decrease in benefits. As shown in Table A12.4, \nthe EIRR is 17.5% even for the combined negative risk scenario where benefits are lower \nand costs are higher.  \n \n\nTable A12.4: Sensitivity Analysis of Economic Internal Rate of Return \n\nSensitivity \nParameter  \n\nBase Case \n\nIncrease in capital cost \n\n(i) \n(ii)  Benefits reduction \n(iii)  Combination of (i)-(ii) \n\n \nPercentage \nChange \n \n \n+20 \n-40 \n \n\n    EIRR (%) \n\n35.9 \n29.8 \n21.3 \n17.5 \n\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, O&M = operation and maintenance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\n \nCountry and Project Title: Indonesia: Java\u2013Bali Electricity Distribution Performance Improvement Project \n\n \nLending/Financing \nModality: \n\n \n\nProject \n\n \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n \n\nSoutheast Asia Department/ \nEnergy and Water Division \n\n \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe  Government  of  Indonesia  has  incorporated  the  national  poverty  reduction  strategy  paper  in  its  Medium-Term \nDevelopment  Plan,  as  poverty  reduction  is  a  major  concern  for  the  Government.  The  2005  country  poverty  assessment  for \nIndonesia  also  found  that  improved  quality  social  services  and  infrastructure  access  are  central  to  poverty  reduction  and \nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals. These make access to energy infrastructure\u2014and promotion of economic \nopportunities\u2014the fundamental building block for reducing long-term poverty. The proposed project will reduce energy losses \nin distribution allowing PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (State Electricity Corporation [PLN]) to connect more customers with the \nsame amount of power generation.  \n \nIndonesia suffers from a deteriorating infrastructure sector, with the lowest electrification rates (62%) in the region. The poor \nstate of the power sector severely constrains economic growth. The Government, as a priority, seeks to develop the power \nsector  to  support  the  country\u2019s  economic  development.  The  main  reason  for  poor  reliability  and  deteriorating  quality  of \nelectricity  is  lack  of  funds  for  new  investment  and  poor  maintenance  in  the  face  of  continued  demand  growth.  The  present \noverload  distribution  system  and  higher  losses  are  a  direct  result  of  old  equipment  and  poor  network  and  inefficient  use  of \nelectricity  by  end  users  (customers).  The  power  sector  needs  immediate  investment  in  generation,  transmission,  and \ndistribution.  PLN  owns  and  controls  all  public  electricity  infrastructure  in  Indonesia,  and  distributes  and  sells  electricity.  The \ngrowing demand for electricity can only be met by developing new generation resources or by using existing resources more \nefficiently.  Energy  efficiency  has  become  a  key  theme  for  the  Indonesian  power  sector  because  of  the  high  cost  of  energy \nsubsidy to the national budget, low tariff compared to marginal cost of power generation, and a looming supply shortage in the \nJava\u2013Bali system.  \n \nAbout  48%  of  Indonesia\u2019s  235  million  people  live  in  rural  areas  and  most  do  not  have  reliable  access  to  modern  forms  of \nenergy such as electricity, gas, and liquid fuels. Even those who are connected to the Java\u2013Bali grid receive electricity of poor \nquality. The proposed Project will distribute good quality and reliable power to the existing consumers with lower losses.  \n \nThe  Project  will  reduce  the  power  sector's  CO2  emissions  by  330,000  t  per  year.  It  will  also  support  registration  of  the \nproposed Project with the regulatory authorities to capture the value of the avoided emissions as cash flows under the CDM. \nThe proposed Project will improve the efficiency of power distribution in all of its five regions on the islands of Java and Bali. \nPLN will save energy by reducing its distribution losses and at the same time improve power supply voltage to its feeders in \nwest, central, and east Java. \n \nThe Project\u2019s objective in terms of contribution to the sector to reduce poverty was assessed. The Project will not have direct \nsignificant impact on economic growth and poverty reduction since it will not provide electricity in new areas. However, about \n200 MW of equivalent distribution system capacity will be freed as a result of the Project and, using the saved energy, PLN \nwill  be  able  to  connect  about  1.2  million  additional  customers  to  the  Java\u2013Bali  network.  The  Project\u2019s  contribution  to  the \nenergy sector will be mainly on loss reduction, which will reduce the cost of power generation for PLN. At present the fuel cost \nof  PLN  is  subsidized  by  the  Government.  With  reduced  fuel  subsidies  to  PLN,  there  will  be  savings  in  Government \nexpenditure,  which  could  be  targeted  for  pro-poor  public  sector  expenditure.  High  quality  and  reliable  electricity  would \ndecrease  production  costs  and  increase  production  for  industry.  It  is  assumed  that  the  low  production  cost  and  increase  in \nproduction would generate more revenue for industry, which could lead to increased labor recruitment.  \n \nB.

The Project\u2019s objective was assessed in terms of social impact.  \n \nThe  poverty  head  count  in  Indonesia  has  been  steadily  falling  since  the  post-Asian  Financial  Crisis  level  of  23.4%  of  the \npopulation  in  1999.  In  2004  the  official  poverty  incidence  was  just  16.7%.  Indonesia\u2019s  poor  continue  to  be  concentrated  in \nrural areas and the rural poverty head count was 20.1% in 2004. The percentage of poor people living in the project provinces \nranges from 3.18% in Jakarta to 21.11% in central Java. The second-highest concentration of poor people (20.08%) is in east \n\n \n\n\f         \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n61\n\nJava (National Socio-economic Survey, 2004). In 2003, Indonesia lost its Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries \nmembership  and  became  an  oil  importer.  Customers  in  Indonesia  are  not  directly  exposed  to  high  oil  prices  as  the \ngovernment subsidizes fuel and electricity. These subsidies are not sustainable when oil prices soar, as was the case in 2008 \nwhen the subsidies were close to $8 billion just for PLN. High levels of subsidies also mean that PLN is left with no additional \nfunds to connect new customers, even though about 38% of the population still does not have access to electricity.  \n \nIn 2005, fuel subsidies made up 25% of Indonesia\u2019s budget, and increased energy subsidies have reduced the Government\u2019s \nability  to  support  education,  health,  small  business  credit  facilities,  and  infrastructure  development.  Although  the  subsidies \nwere designed for the poor, in 2008 the 40% of high-income families benefited from 70% of the subsidies. a \n \nIn October 2005, the Government increased fuel prices by 114%, which increased the price of kerosene by 186% and led to \nincreases in the prices of household goods. The large increase in the kerosene price had a large negative impact, as about \n110 million people live on less than $2 a day (2007) and many do not have access to electricity. While the Government has \nundertaken many initiatives to mitigate the impacts of reduced fuel subsidies, including a series of targeted community-driven \ndevelopment interventions to establish and improve safety nets, increased investment is still needed. The proposed Project \nwill free up power generation to connect more new customers in the Java\u2013Bali distribution network of PLN.  \n \n2. Design Features.  \n \nThe Part 2, Efficient Lighting Pilot, of the Project will also assist residential customers to reduce their electricity bills by using \nefficient lighting. Some households will be able to save about 80% of their cost of electricity for lighting.  \n \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nReliable  and  improved  house  lighting  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  economic  and  social  activities  in  the  evening.  A  high \nquality  and  reliable  source  of  electricity  will  also  increase  the  life  of  household  appliances  for  upper  and  middle-income \ngroups. Hospitals, schools, and other social service institutions will benefit from a high quality and reliable source of electricity, \nand the efficiency of their services will increase.   \n \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nDuring the feasibility study, focus group interviews were conducted with customers to identify the potential impact of the \nProject in terms of access to reliable electricity, and its impact on daily life, social services, and business.  \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n No  \n\n Yes    \n\n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \nC&P will be prepared by implementation consultants working with PLN during implementation. \n \n \nC.   Gender and Development \n \nKey Issues. It is expected that a better quality and more reliable source of electricity will have a positive impact on \n1. \nuse of household equipment, especially kitchen equipment. This could lessen the  workload of  women in upper and  middle-\nincome households. Women running home industries, businesses, and other enterprises might experience lower production \ncosts and increased revenue. \n \n \n2.  Key Actions.

Beneficiaries are \ncustomers from all ethnic \ngroups. The Project will have \nno negative impact on ethnic \nminority groups. \n \n\nThe energy saved from this \nloss-saving initiative will \nallow PLN to connect new \ncustomers including ethnic \nminorities. \n\nFor construction workers, \nsafe drinking water and \nsanitary facilities will be \nprovided at construction \nsites.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nPlan or Other Measures \nIncluded in Design \n\n   Full Plan \n   Short Plan \n   Resettlement Framework \n   No Action \n\n   Plan \n   Other Action \n   Indigenous Peoples \n\nFramework \n\n   No Action \n\n   Plan \n   Other Action  \n   No Action \n\n   Action \n   No Action \n\n  Plan \n  Other Action \n   No Action \n\n \n \nNo impact, as nature of job \nis rehabilitation of equipment \nacross a large geographic \narea, which will not require \nworkers to stay in a single \nlocation for an extended \nperiod of time.
