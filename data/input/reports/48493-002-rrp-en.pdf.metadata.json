The report also describes the proposed \nadministration  of  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  be  provided  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty \nReduction for  the  Madhya Pradesh  Skills  Development  Project,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the \nproposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  approve  the \nadministration of the TA. \n \n2. \nThe  project  will  assist  the Government  of  Madhya  Pradesh (GOMP)  in  transforming  its \ntechnical and vocational education and training (TVET) system to create a skilled workforce that \nmeets the evolving development needs of the state.1 The project will establish a new advanced \nTVET  institute  of  international  standards  to  introduce  high-quality,  technology-oriented  skills \ntraining for the state\u2019s priority sectors. The project will also modernize 10 major industrial training \ninstitutes  (ITIs)  by  upgrading  training  infrastructure  and  curricula  to  impart  quality,  industry-\nrelevant skills. The project aims to increase the employability, productivity, and incomes of the \nworkforce, especially youth, women, and disadvantaged groups. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nMadhya Pradesh, located in central India, is the sixth most populous state with 78 million \npeople. It is a low-income state with per capita income at about 70% of the national average.2  \nDuring  FY2012\u2013FY2018,  Madhya  Pradesh  recorded  impressive  economic  growth  averaging \nmore than 8.0%, higher than the national average of 6.9%. Agriculture underpinned the recent \ngrowth with near double-digit growth (9.3%), in sharp contrast to the overall trend in India.3 The \nindustry sector has also emerged strong, growing at an average of 7.8% since 2015. The service \nindustry has shown steady growth as well, averaging more than 7.0%. Madhya Pradesh is part of \nthe Delhi\u2013Mumbai Industrial Corridor and hosts numerous industrial growth centers along major \ncity  clusters. 4  The  state\u2019s  industrial  promotion  policies  have  boosted  large  investments  in \nmanufacturing, such as automotive and auto components, electronics, and food processing. To \nconvert vibrant investments into sustained economic growth, Madhya Pradesh requires a well-\ntrained workforce to meet current and emerging skill demands across the core industries. The \nstate, however, faces challenges in the supply of skilled workforce. \n \nSkills gap. A skills gap analysis indicates an overall incremental demand for 5.6 million \n4. \nworkers  during  2018\u20132024, 5 with  nearly  two-thirds  being  semiskilled  or  skilled  workers.  The \n\n                                                \n1  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  TA  for  the  Madhya  Pradesh  Skills  Development \n\nProject (TA 9253-IND). \n\n2  Government of India. Open Government Data Platform India. www.data.gov.in (accessed 15 May 2018). \n3 \n\nIn Madhya Pradesh, agriculture and allied sectors contributed to 41% of the gross state domestic product in FY2016, \nwhile the industry sector accounted for 19% and services for 34%. The corresponding sector shares for India overall \nare 19% for agriculture and allied sectors, 24% for industry, and 48% for services. \n\n4   GOMP  designated  six  major  city  clusters:  Bhopal,  Gwalior,  Indore,  Jabalpur,  Rewa,  and  Sagar.  There  are  19 \nindustrial development parks, 129 industrial areas, 8 integrated development centers, and other industrial zones \nbeing developed around these city clusters. During 2012\u20132017, the number of registered micro, small, and medium-\nsized enterprises increased from about 20,000 to 87,000. (Sources: Department of Industry Policy and Investment \nPromotion, GOMP; and Madhya Pradesh Trade and Investment Facilitation Corporation.) \n\n5  ADB  estimates  during  project  preparation  based  on  data  from  the  state\u2019s  industrial  investments,  economic \n\ndevelopment indicators, and employment and unemployment surveys. \n\n \n\n\fhighest  demand  is  in  construction  and  manufacturing,  followed  by  trades  and  repair  services, \ntransportation  and  logistics,  and  other  services.  However,  more  than  half  (55%)  of  the  current \nworkforce is in agriculture, while 22% are in industry and 23% in services.6 The current workforce \nis largely unskilled, with two-thirds having up to primary education. And only 1.2% of the workforce \nhas  undergone  any  formal  vocational  training,  significantly  lower  than  the  national  average  of \n5.4%. The skill levels of the current labor force are, therefore, insufficient to meet the requirements \nfrom  burgeoning  industries.  The  skills  gap  is  particularly  pronounced  in  manufacturing  and \nservices, where the gap widened between 2010 and 2015.7 These are the industries where skill \nrequirements  increasingly  rely  on  technology  applications.  In  agriculture,  the  demand  for \nadvanced knowledge and skills is also increasing to spur productivity and tap into higher-income \nopportunities by moving up the value chain.8 \n \nLow  employability  among  young  people.  Madhya  Pradesh  has  one  of  the  youngest \n5. \npopulations in the country, as well as a large population. The working-age population (aged 15\u2013\n59) will expand from 48 million in 2016 to 56 million in 2026, with 0.8 million potential new entrants \ninto the labor force every year. If these young workers are equipped with education and skills that \nmatch the demand from growing industries, the state will be well poised to reap the demographic \ndividend  for  sustainable and  inclusive  development.  School  enrollments  have  been  improving: \ngross  enrollment  ratios  reached  80%  at the  secondary  level  and  46%  at the  higher  secondary \nlevel in 2015. Yet, young people do not seem to have the requisite employable skills. In the age \ngroup 18\u201329, those with secondary or higher secondary education have one of the lowest labor \nforce participation rates, and those with a college education have a higher unemployment rate \nthan the overall working population (8.7% versus 4.3%). The challenges for employment result \nfrom  limited  opportunities  to  acquire  quality  skills  training.  For  Madhya  Pradesh,  improving \nopportunities for quality TVET is essential in addressing low employability among young people \nand capitalizing on growing industrial investments in the state. \n \n6. \nInadequate quality and industrial relevance of ITI programs.  As post-secondary TVET \ninstitutes offering 1 to 2 years of skills programs, ITIs are the mainstay for semiskilled and skilled \nworkers  in the  state.  About  220 government  ITIs  and  817  private  ITIs  produce  about  100,000 \ngraduates a year. Government ITIs enroll about 45,000 trainees per year, but completion rates \nare only about 50%.9 Employment rates vary across government ITIs, but estimates place them \nbelow 40%.10 ITIs face many constraints in meeting the skill requirements of today\u2019s industries \nbecause  (i)  most  government  ITIs  have  old,  inadequate  training  infrastructure  and  equipment,  \nunable  to  expose  trainees  to  actual  work  settings  of  industries;  (ii)  curricula  are  outdated,  so \ntraining programs are not aligned with the skill requirements of current or emerging industries; (iii) \ntrainers lack sufficient industry information or experience and hence are unable to adapt training \nto ongoing skills demands; and (iv) training courses are offered across 62 trades, but two-thirds \nof enrollments are concentrated in 10 trades, causing inefficiencies in the use and management \nof resources. An employers\u2019 survey reveals that many ITI graduates still require additional training \nwhen  employed,  adding  extra  burden  and  costs  to  employers,  particularly  small  and  medium-\nsized  businesses.11 Inadequate  training  infrastructure  and  uncertain  job  prospects  also  do  not \n                                                \n6  Ministry of Labour and Employment. 2016. Report on Fifth Annual Employment-Unemployment Survey, 2015\u20132016. \n\n7  ADB analysis based on data from the National Sample Survey, 2011\u20132012 and the Employment\u2013Unemployment \n\n8  GOMP, Department of Planning, Economics and Statistics. 2016. Madhya Pradesh Agriculture Economic Survey. \n\nNew Delhi. \n\nSurvey, 2015\u20132016.  \n\nBhopal. \n\n9  Enrollment at private ITIs was 44,000 in 2016\u20132017, less than one-third of the total intake capacity of 147,000. \n10  This estimate is based on data gathered from selected ITIs during project preparation; job placement data are not \n\ncollected systematically by all ITIs. \n\n11  A survey of employers was conducted during project preparation as part of demand assessments. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\finspire young people to pursue a technical career, causing low demand for ITIs. ITIs with proper \ninfrastructure,  equipment,  and  trainers  can  offer  national  certificates  according  to  the  2014 \nNational  Council  for  Vocational  Training  guidelines,  which  enable graduates  to  access  higher-\nwage jobs; yet only 30% of students could obtain such certificates. ITIs need to be invigorated, \nboth in quality and management, to stimulate young people to acquire industry-responsive skills \nand to enhance their employability. \n \n7. \nLack of advanced TVET. While ITIs are expected to train semiskilled or skilled workers, \nMadhya  Pradesh  lacks  advanced  TVET  institutes  where  ITI  trainees  can  pursue  advanced \ntechnical training. Advanced skills are increasingly required in today\u2019s manufacturing and modern \nservice industries, as they rely on technology applications such as information technology-based \nequipment and automated system engineering. Few institutes in the state have the capacity or \ncapability  to  deliver  higher-level  training  in  emerging  skills  for  fast-changing  industries.  This \nconstrains additional skilling opportunities for ITI graduates and their career pursuits in becoming \nhighly skilled technicians. The state is in need of a quality advanced TVET institute, where young \npeople can obtain higher-level, industry-relevant skill sets and those already working can upgrade \ntheir competencies to meet technology-oriented skill requirements. \n \n8. \nThe project and ADB\u2019s value addition. The project aims to equip the men and women \nof Madhya Pradesh with mid- to advanced-level skills to meet emerging demands in the priority \nmanufacturing and service industries, as well as with advanced agricultural skills. To this end, the \nproject will help GOMP transform the state\u2019s TVET system to build quality skilling opportunities. \nIt  will  establish  a  Global  Skills  Park  (GSP),  the  first  multi-skills  park  in India,  which  will  impart \nadvanced job-ready skills training of international standards. It will also modernize 10 major ITIs \nacross the state\u2019s 10 divisions by upgrading training facilities and skills programs to deliver quality, \nindustry-relevant training.12 The unique features of the project are as follows: \n \n\n(i)  Establishment  of  a  vertical  skills  path  for  job-ready  skills  acquisition.  The \nproject will help build a vertical skills path between the existing 10 ITIs and the new \nGSP, through which mid- to advanced-level skills can be progressively acquired. The \nGSP  will  introduce  technology-oriented  skills  of  global  standards,  targeted  at  ITI \ngraduates and others with prior technical training, while ITIs will focus on quality mid-\nlevel skills programs. Training at the GSP and 10 ITIs will take an industrial cluster \napproach  to  develop  a  range  of  core  skills  for  strategic  priority  sectors  (e.g., \nautomotive  engineering,  building  technology).  This  approach  will  not  only  meet \ndemand  for  various  skills  in  each  priority  sector,  but  the  availability  of  relevantly \nskilled  workers  will  also  attract  further  investments  to  the  sector.  This  will  in  turn \ncreate sustainable employment opportunities for the state\u2019s workforce.  \n\n(ITE)  Singapore  and  Deutsche  Gesellschaft \n\n \n(ii)  Benchmarking  training  quality  to  international  and  national  standards.  The \nproject  will  engage  two  international  TVET  partners\u2014the  Institute  of  Technical \nEducation \nInternationale \nZusammenarbeit (GIZ)\u2014to support advanced training at the GSP and to uplift the \nstate\u2019s TVET quality overall. The partners will bring global best practices in TVET \nmanagement,  training  infrastructure,  industry  cooperation,  and  quality  assurance. \nFor ITIs, courses will be upgraded to offer national certificates, so that ITI graduates \ncan  access  higher-wage  jobs  in  and  outside  the  state.  GSP  training  will  provide \ninternationally recognized certificates and facilitate overseas employment.  \n\nf\u00fcr \n\n \n\n                                                \n12  Madya Pradesh is divided into 10 divisions. The 10 ITIs covering these 10 divisions are located in industrial cluster \ncities or main districts: Bhind, Bhopal, Gwalior, Hoshangabad, Indore, Jabalpur, Rewa, Saga, Shahdol, and Ujjain.  \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fOutputs \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe project reflects the priorities of the ADB country partnership strategy, 2018\u20132022 for \n9. \nIndia, which aims to reinforce India\u2019s efforts toward faster, inclusive, and sustainable economic \ngrowth.13 ADB supports skills development to improve the employability and productivity of India\u2019s \ngrowing workforce, which will contribute to the competitiveness and transformation of the Indian \neconomy. The project also incorporates experiences and lessons from ADB\u2019s ongoing support for \nskills initiatives in the states of Himachal, Kerala, and Meghalaya.14 \n \nB. \n \n10. \nThe  project  is  aligned  with the following  impact: employment  and  income  prospects  for \nyoung  men  and  women  in  Madhya  Pradesh  increased.15 The  project  will  have  the  following \noutcome: number of skilled workers with internationally or nationally recognized TVET certificates \nincreased.16 \n \nC. \n \nOutput 1: GSP established for advanced training and TVET support. The project will \n11. \nestablish a new flagship GSP campus in Bhopal with training and other facilities of international \nstandards. The GSP campus is envisaged to be aspirational for the youth of Madhya Pradesh to \nrebrand the TVET image and encourage their acquisition of technical skills for higher-wage jobs. \nThe  GSP  will  consist  of  core  advanced  training  institutes\u2014the  Center  for  Occupational  Skills \nAcquisition and the Center for Advanced Agricultural Training\u2014and TVET support services such \nas entrepreneurship  development, training of trainers,  and  skill-related  research. The GSP  will \nserve as the state\u2019s central hub for other TVET institutes by demonstrating global best practices \nin training delivery, industry cooperation, pedagogy, assessment, and certification. Specifically, \nthe project will (i) create modern training workshops to offer authentic industrial experience  for \njob-ready  skills  acquisition;  (ii)  deliver  advanced  training  for  high-demand  skills  in  the  state\u2019s \npriority manufacturing and service industries with support from ITE and GIZ;17 (iii) forge industry \ncooperation  to  develop  industry-certified  training  and  upskilling  programs;  (iv)  implement \nadvanced  agricultural  skills  training  on  smart  farming  and  post-harvest  technologies;  and \n(v) promote entrepreneurship by nurturing business ideas and facilitating financing and marketing \nlinkages. About 20,000 trainees and trainers will benefit under this output. \n \n12. \nOutput  2:  Quality  and  relevance  of  state  ITI  programs  enhanced.  The  project  will \nsupport  the  modernization of  10  ITIs  across  the  state by  renovating training  infrastructure  and \nupgrading skills courses to be aligned with industrial development needs in each division, as well \nas with national quality standards. The upgraded 10 ITIs will also serve as main resource hubs \nfor about 100 network ITIs across the divisions in order to extend the benefits of improved facilities \nand  TVET  support,  particularly  training  of  trainers,  industry-cooperated  training,  and  career \nguidance services. To invigorate ITI management, each of 10 ITIs will establish its own results-\noriented institutional development plan, which will underpin its performance rating system. Under \nthis  output, the  project will  (i)  upgrade training facilities and equipment  in all  10  ITIs to deliver \nquality  training  aligned  with  the  National  Council  for  Vocational  Training  requirements;  (ii) \n                                                \n13  ADB. 2018.

Their services will include developing industry-\naligned  curricula  and  learning  contents  for  GSP  training,  building  the  capacity  of  trainers, \nestablishing industry links, and setting up credible assessment and certification systems. \n \n\nIII. \n\nATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \nThe attached TA is estimated to cost $2.2 million, of which $2.0 million will be financed on \n20. \na grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The TA will \nbuild the capacity of executing and implementing agencies by supporting start-up activities during \nthe initial 2 years. The TA will assist in (i) preparing operational guidelines and setting up the GSP \nSociety; (ii) developing implementation plans for ITI reform initiatives, such as performance-linked \nincentive schemes; (iii) conducting a tracer study of TVET graduates to establish baseline data; \n(iv)  designing  information  technology-based  TVET  and  career  guidance  modules;  and \n(v) organizing  knowledge-sharing  workshops  on  skills  and  TVET  management.  The  state \ngovernment will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office accommodation \nand supplies, and other in-kind contributions.22 \n \n \n\n                                                \n21  The single source selection was approved by ADB on 16 April 2018 as part of advance contracting. \n22  Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nA. \n \nTraining  programs  in  the  GSP  and  ITIs  were  selected  based  on  skills-gap  analysis, \n21. \ndemand assessments, consultations with industry groups, and discussions among ITI principals. \nTraining  facilities  at  ITIs  were  designed  with  inputs  from  TVET,  architectural,  and  engineering \nexperts to follow international and national standards in technology-oriented training and trade-\nspecific industry requirements. TVET expert inputs will continue during implementation to ensure \nthat all new training facilities meet the required building certification and expected standards for \nadvanced quality training. Although the project is rated low in climate risk assessment, the amount \nfor climate change financing and the level of carbon dioxide emission reduction will be estimated \nwhen building designs for the GSP are finalized.  \n \nB. \n \nEconomic viability. The economic internal rate of return was estimated at 12.9%. The \n22. \nmain benefits considered in the analysis were wages earned after completing training at the GSP \nand ITIs. The main costs are civil works; equipment; private costs of trainees (i.e., training costs \nand opportunity costs); equipment replacement costs; and recurrent costs to sustain the quality \nof training programs. Sensitivity analysis was carried out with a 10% cost overrun (capital and \nrecurrent costs) and a 10% lower wage increase. In all cases, the economic internal rate of return \nexceeds the required rate of 6%, suggesting that the project is economically viable. \n \nFinancial  sustainability.  The  project\u2019s  sustainability  will  depend  primarily  on  (i)  the \n23. \ngovernment\u2019s  ability  to  allocate  adequate  budget  to  TVET  over  time  and  (ii)  the  successful \noperation and efficient management of the new GSP. The GOMP has prioritized scaling up its \nskills initiatives, and TVET expenditure has increased significantly from \u20b92.9 billion in FY2012 to \n\u20b99.3 billion in FY2018. After project completion, incremental recurrent costs (about \u20b9734 million \nor $11.5 million per year) are estimated to account for about 5.1% of the total TVET budget in \nFY2024. In view of the state\u2019s strong economic growth and improved tax revenue, GOMP will be \nable to maintain its high commitment to TVET expenditures. Also, an autonomous GSP Society \nwill be set up to take charge of GSP operation and management after project completion. The \nproject  will  support  the  formulation  of  operational  and  business  plans  for  the  GSP  in  ways  to \nmaximize its efficient management and long-term financial sustainability. \n \nC. \n \n24. \nFinancial management. The financial management risk is moderate mainly because the \nexecuting  agency  (DTESD&E)  and  implementing  agencies  (DOSD  and  MPHIDB)  have \nexperience in managing externally funded projects and are familiar with financial management \nand other fiduciary requirements by development partners. However, the project is the first ADB-\nfinanced project for the executing or implementing agencies. An experienced finance officer has \nbeen appointed to oversee the project and professional accountants will also be engaged for the \nPMU.  The  project  will  support  training  on  ADB\u2019s  financial  reporting,  project  accounting, \ndisbursement procedures, and audit requirements during implementation. While the implementing \nagencies follow the established Madhya Pradesh financial rules, they have limited internal audit \nfunctions. An independent audit firm will be engaged to undertake internal audits and strengthen \nfiduciary controls. \n \n\nGovernance \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nProcurement.  The  procurement  capacity  assessment  shows  that  DOSD  and  MPHIDB \n25. \nhave adequate capacity to carry out the project activities, given their experience in handling works \nfor public housing and ITIs. Since DOSD will procure relatively large civil works and equipment \nfor  the  GSP,  the  PMU  will  engage  experienced  procurement  staff.  Project  management \nconsultants  will  provide  additional  technical  support  and monitoring.  All  procurement  of  works, \ngoods, and services will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to \ntime) and ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time).23 \n  \n26. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government of India and the state\u2019s DTESD&E. The specific policy requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 19). \n \nD. \n \n27. \nPoverty in  Madhya Pradesh had declined since 2004 but was still high at 32% in 2011 \ncompared to the national average of 22%.24 The state has high percentages of scheduled tribes \n(21%)  and  scheduled  castes  (15%),  whose  human  capital  indicators  lag  other  groups.  Also, \nsignificant  gender  differences  exist  in  literacy  (79%  for  men  and  59%  for  women),  labor  force \nparticipation (60% for men and 15% for women), and unemployment (7.2% for men and 15.7% \nfor women) among those aged 18\u201329. The project includes targeted measures to improve training \nand  employment  prospects  for  these  groups.  The  project  is  categorized  as  effective  gender \nmainstreaming, and a gender equality and social inclusion plan was prepared. The key measures \ninclude (i) targeting 30% female enrollment for the GSP and ITI training, (ii) improving the skills \nof women trainers, (iii) constructing women\u2019s hostels in four ITIs and the GSP, and (iv) recruiting \nwomen as security guards for the women\u2019s hostels. The target trainees at the GSP and ITIs will \ninclude 50% from disadvantaged groups (21% scheduled tribes, 15% scheduled castes, and 14% \nother marginal groups combined); 30% women; and 6% people with disabilities. \n \nE. \n \n28. \ncategories are as follows.25 \n \n29. \nEnvironment (category B). For civil works at the GSP and ITIs, potential environmental \nimpacts will be site-specific, reversible, and occur mostly during construction. During operation, \ntraining  facilities  will  require  adequate  water  and  waste  management.  Initial  environmental \nexamination reports, including environmental management plans, were prepared for each of the \nproject  sites  and  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website.  The  implementation  status  of  environmental \nmanagement plans will be monitored and reported to ADB semiannually. \n \n30. \nexpected. All civil works will take place on government-owned land or within existing premises. \n \n31. \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  B).  Given  the  high  proportion  of  scheduled  tribes  and \nscheduled castes in the state, an indigenous peoples plan was prepared to ensure their access \nto  training  in  the  GSP  and  ITIs.  No  adverse  impacts  are  envisaged  for  these  groups;  rather, \nmeasures in the plan will facilitate their access to better training and employment opportunities. \n                                                \n23  The concept paper for the project was approved in December 2016.
