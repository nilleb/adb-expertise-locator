THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nIndia for the Madhya Pradesh Skills Development Project. The report also describes the proposed \nadministration of technical assistance (TA) to be provided by  the Japan Fund for Poverty \nReduction for the Madhya Pradesh Skills Development Project, and if the Board approves the \nproposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  approve  the \nadministration of the TA. \n \n2.  The project will assist the Government of Madhya Pradesh (GOMP) in transforming its \ntechnical and vocational education and training (TVET) system to create a skilled workforce that \nmeets the evolving development needs of the state.1 The project will establish a new advanced \nTVET institute of international standards to introduce high-quality, technology-oriented skills \ntraining for the state\u2019s priority sectors. The project will also modernize 10 major industrial training \ninstitutes (ITIs) by upgrading training infrastructure and curricula to impart quality, industry-\nrelevant skills. The project aims to increase the employability, productivity, and incomes of the \nworkforce, especially youth, women, and disadvantaged groups. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Madhya Pradesh, located in central India, is the sixth most populous state with 78 million \npeople. It is a low-income state with per capita income at about 70% of the national average.2  \nDuring FY2012\u2013FY2018, Madhya Pradesh recorded impressive economic growth averaging \nmore than 8.0%, higher than the national average of 6.9%. Agriculture underpinned the recent \ngrowth with near double-digit growth (9.3%), in sharp contrast to the overall trend in India.3 The \nindustry sector has also emerged strong, growing at an average of 7.8% since 2015. The service \nindustry has shown steady growth as well, averaging more than 7.0%. Madhya Pradesh is part of \nthe Delhi\u2013Mumbai Industrial Corridor and hosts numerous industrial growth centers along major \ncity  clusters.4 The  state\u2019s  industrial  promotion  policies  have  boosted  large  investments  in \nmanufacturing, such as automotive and auto components, electronics, and food processing. To \nconvert vibrant investments into sustained economic growth, Madhya Pradesh requires a well-\ntrained workforce to meet current and emerging skill demands across the core industries. The \nstate, however, faces challenges in the supply of skilled workforce. \n \n4.  Skills gap. A skills gap analysis indicates an overall incremental demand for 5.6 million \nworkers during 2018\u20132024,5 with nearly two-thirds being semiskilled or skilled workers. The \n                                                \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory TA for the Madhya Pradesh Skills Development \nProject (TA 9253-IND). \n2  Government of India. Open Government Data Platform India. www.data.gov.in (accessed 15 May 2018). \n3  In Madhya Pradesh, agriculture and allied sectors contributed to 41% of the gross state domestic product in FY2016, \nwhile the industry sector accounted for 19% and services for 34%. The corresponding sector shares for India overall \nare 19% for agriculture and allied sectors, 24% for industry, and 48% for services. \n4   GOMP designated six major city clusters: Bhopal, Gwalior, Indore, Jabalpur, Rewa, and Sagar. There are 19 \nindustrial development parks, 129 industrial areas, 8 integrated development centers, and other industrial zones \nbeing developed around these city clusters. During 2012\u20132017, the number of registered micro, small, and medium-\nsized enterprises increased from about 20,000 to 87,000. (Sources: Department of Industry Policy and Investment \nPromotion, GOMP; and Madhya Pradesh Trade and Investment Facilitation Corporation.) \n5  ADB estimates during project preparation based on data from the state\u2019s industrial investments, economic \ndevelopment indicators, and employment and unemployment surveys. \n ", "2 \nhighest demand is in construction and manufacturing, followed by trades and repair services, \ntransportation and logistics, and other services. However, more than half (55%) of the current \nworkforce is in agriculture, while 22% are in industry and 23% in services.6 The current workforce \nis largely unskilled, with two-thirds having up to primary education. And only 1.2% of the workforce \nhas undergone any formal vocational training, significantly lower than the national average of \n5.4%. The skill levels of the current labor force are, therefore, insufficient to meet the requirements \nfrom burgeoning industries. The skills gap is particularly pronounced in manufacturing and \nservices, where the gap widened between 2010 and 2015.7 These are the industries where skill \nrequirements  increasingly  rely  on  technology  applications.  In  agriculture,  the  demand  for \nadvanced knowledge and skills is also increasing to spur productivity and tap into higher-income \nopportunities by moving up the value chain.8 \n \n5.  Low employability among young people. Madhya Pradesh has one of the youngest \npopulations in the country, as well as a large population. The working-age population (aged 15\u2013\n59) will expand from 48 million in 2016 to 56 million in 2026, with 0.8 million potential new entrants \ninto the labor force every year. If these young workers are equipped with education and skills that \nmatch the demand from growing industries, the state will be well poised to reap the demographic \ndividend for sustainable and inclusive development. School enrollments have been improving: \ngross enrollment ratios reached 80% at the secondary level and 46% at the higher secondary \nlevel in 2015. Yet, young people do not seem to have the requisite employable skills. In the age \ngroup 18\u201329, those with secondary or higher secondary education have one of the lowest labor \nforce participation rates, and those with a college education have a higher unemployment rate \nthan the overall working population (8.7% versus 4.3%). The challenges for employment result \nfrom limited opportunities to acquire quality skills training. For Madhya Pradesh, improving \nopportunities for quality TVET is essential in addressing low employability among young people \nand capitalizing on growing industrial investments in the state. \n \n6.  Inadequate quality and industrial relevance of ITI programs.  As post-secondary TVET \ninstitutes offering 1 to 2 years of skills programs, ITIs are the mainstay for semiskilled and skilled \nworkers in the state. About 220 government ITIs and 817 private ITIs produce about 100,000 \ngraduates a year. Government ITIs enroll about 45,000 trainees per year, but completion rates \nare only about 50%.9 Employment rates vary across government ITIs, but estimates place them \nbelow 40%.10 ITIs face many constraints in meeting the skill requirements of today\u2019s industries \nbecause (i) most government ITIs have old, inadequate training infrastructure and equipment,  \nunable to expose trainees to actual work settings of industries; (ii) curricula are outdated, so \ntraining programs are not aligned with the skill requirements of current or emerging industries; (iii) \ntrainers lack sufficient industry information or experience and hence are unable to adapt training \nto ongoing skills demands; and (iv) training courses are offered across 62 trades, but two-thirds \nof enrollments are concentrated in 10 trades, causing inefficiencies in the use and management \nof resources. An employers\u2019 survey reveals that many ITI graduates still require additional training \nwhen employed, adding extra burden and costs to employers, particularly small and medium-\nsized businesses.11 Inadequate training infrastructure and uncertain job prospects also do not \n                                                \n6  Ministry of Labour and Employment. 2016. Report on Fifth Annual Employment-Unemployment Survey, 2015\u20132016. \nNew Delhi. \n7  ADB analysis based on data from the National Sample Survey, 2011\u20132012 and the Employment\u2013Unemployment \nSurvey, 2015\u20132016.  \n8  GOMP, Department of Planning, Economics and Statistics. 2016. Madhya Pradesh Agriculture Economic Survey. \nBhopal. \n9  Enrollment at private ITIs was 44,000 in 2016\u20132017, less than one-third of the total intake capacity of 147,000. \n10  This estimate is based on data gathered from selected ITIs during project preparation; job placement data are not \ncollected systematically by all ITIs. \n11  A survey of employers was conducted during project preparation as part of demand assessments. \n ", "3 \ninspire young people to pursue a technical career, causing low demand for ITIs. ITIs with proper \ninfrastructure, equipment, and trainers can offer national certificates according to the 2014 \nNational Council for Vocational Training guidelines, which enable graduates to access higher-\nwage jobs; yet only 30% of students could obtain such certificates. ITIs need to be invigorated, \nboth in quality and management, to stimulate young people to acquire industry-responsive skills \nand to enhance their employability. \n \n7.  Lack of advanced TVET. While ITIs are expected to train semiskilled or skilled workers, \nMadhya Pradesh lacks advanced TVET institutes where ITI trainees can pursue advanced \ntechnical training. Advanced skills are increasingly required in today\u2019s manufacturing and modern \nservice industries, as they rely on technology applications such as information technology-based \nequipment and automated system engineering. Few institutes in the state have the capacity or \ncapability to deliver higher-level training in emerging skills for fast-changing industries. This \nconstrains additional skilling opportunities for ITI graduates and their career pursuits in becoming \nhighly skilled technicians. The state is in need of a quality advanced TVET institute, where young \npeople can obtain higher-level, industry-relevant skill sets and those already working can upgrade \ntheir competencies to meet technology-oriented skill requirements. \n \n8.  The project and ADB\u2019s value addition. The project aims to equip the men and women \nof Madhya Pradesh with mid- to advanced-level skills to meet emerging demands in the priority \nmanufacturing and service industries, as well as with advanced agricultural skills. To this end, the \nproject will help GOMP transform the state\u2019s TVET system to build quality skilling opportunities. \nIt will establish a Global Skills Park (GSP), the first multi-skills park in India, which will impart \nadvanced job-ready skills training of international standards. It will also modernize 10 major ITIs \nacross the state\u2019s 10 divisions by upgrading training facilities and skills programs to deliver quality, \nindustry-relevant training.12 The unique features of the project are as follows: \n \n(i)  Establishment of a vertical skills path for job-ready skills acquisition. The \nproject will help build a vertical skills path between the existing 10 ITIs and the new \nGSP, through which mid- to advanced-level skills can be progressively acquired. The \nGSP will introduce technology-oriented skills of global standards, targeted at ITI \ngraduates and others with prior technical training, while ITIs will focus on quality mid-\nlevel skills programs. Training at the GSP and 10 ITIs will take an industrial cluster \napproach  to  develop  a  range  of  core  skills  for  strategic  priority  sectors  (e.g., \nautomotive engineering, building technology). This approach will not only meet \ndemand for various skills in each priority sector, but the availability of relevantly \nskilled workers will also attract further investments to the sector. This will in turn \ncreate sustainable employment opportunities for the state\u2019s workforce.  \n \n(ii)  Benchmarking training quality to international and national standards. The \nproject will engage two international TVET partners\u2014the Institute of Technical \nEducation  (ITE)  Singapore  and  Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Internationale \nZusammenarbeit (GIZ)\u2014to support advanced training at the GSP and to uplift the \nstate\u2019s TVET quality overall. The partners will bring global best practices in TVET \nmanagement, training infrastructure, industry cooperation, and quality assurance. \nFor ITIs, courses will be upgraded to offer national certificates, so that ITI graduates \ncan access higher-wage jobs in and outside the state. GSP training will provide \ninternationally recognized certificates and facilitate overseas employment.  \n \n                                                \n12  Madya Pradesh is divided into 10 divisions. The 10 ITIs covering these 10 divisions are located in industrial cluster \ncities or main districts: Bhind, Bhopal, Gwalior, Hoshangabad, Indore, Jabalpur, Rewa, Saga, Shahdol, and Ujjain.  \n ", "4 \n9.  The project reflects the priorities of the ADB country partnership strategy, 2018\u20132022 for \nIndia, which aims to reinforce India\u2019s efforts toward faster, inclusive, and sustainable economic \ngrowth.13 ADB supports skills development to improve the employability and productivity of India\u2019s \ngrowing workforce, which will contribute to the competitiveness and transformation of the Indian \neconomy. The project also incorporates experiences and lessons from ADB\u2019s ongoing support for \nskills initiatives in the states of Himachal, Kerala, and Meghalaya.14 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The project is aligned with the following impact: employment and income prospects for \nyoung men and women in Madhya Pradesh increased.15 The project will have the following \noutcome: number of skilled workers with internationally or nationally recognized TVET certificates \nincreased.16 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n11.  Output 1: GSP established for advanced training and TVET support. The project will \nestablish a new flagship GSP campus in Bhopal with training and other facilities of international \nstandards. The GSP campus is envisaged to be aspirational for the youth of Madhya Pradesh to \nrebrand the TVET image and encourage their acquisition of technical skills for higher-wage jobs. \nThe GSP will consist of core advanced training institutes\u2014the Center for Occupational Skills \nAcquisition and the Center for Advanced Agricultural Training\u2014and TVET support services such \nas entrepreneurship development, training of trainers, and skill-related research. The GSP will \nserve as the state\u2019s central hub for other TVET institutes by demonstrating global best practices \nin training delivery, industry cooperation, pedagogy, assessment, and certification. Specifically, \nthe project will (i) create modern training workshops to offer authentic industrial experience for \njob-ready skills acquisition; (ii) deliver advanced training for high-demand skills in the state\u2019s \npriority manufacturing and service industries with support from ITE and GIZ;17 (iii) forge industry \ncooperation  to  develop  industry-certified  training  and  upskilling  programs;  (iv)  implement \nadvanced  agricultural  skills  training  on  smart  farming  and  post-harvest  technologies;  and \n(v) promote entrepreneurship by nurturing business ideas and facilitating financing and marketing \nlinkages. About 20,000 trainees and trainers will benefit under this output. \n \n12.  Output 2: Quality and relevance of state ITI programs enhanced. The project will \nsupport the modernization of 10 ITIs across the state by renovating training infrastructure and \nupgrading skills courses to be aligned with industrial development needs in each division, as well \nas with national quality standards. The upgraded 10 ITIs will also serve as main resource hubs \nfor about 100 network ITIs across the divisions in order to extend the benefits of improved facilities \nand TVET support, particularly training of trainers, industry-cooperated training, and career \nguidance services. To invigorate ITI management, each of 10 ITIs will establish its own results-\noriented institutional development plan, which will underpin its performance rating system. Under \nthis output, the project will (i) upgrade training facilities and equipment in all 10 ITIs to deliver \nquality  training  aligned  with  the  National  Council  for  Vocational  Training  requirements;  (ii) \n                                                \n13  ADB. 2018.

The PMU will be under DOSD, \nheaded by a project director and consisting of managers and experts in training and quality \nassurance, procurement, and finance. The implementation arrangements are summarized in \nTable 3 and described in detail in the PAM (footnote 19). \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  December 2018\u2013December 2023 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2023 \n                                                \n20  ADB financing will cover taxes and duties that (i) are within the reasonable threshold identified during the country \npartnership strategy preparation, (ii) do not represent an excessive share of the investment plan (13% of the loan), \n(iii) apply only to ADB-financed expenditures, and (iv) are considered relevant to the project\u2019s success. \n ", "7 \nAspects  Arrangements \nEstimated loan closing date  30 June 2024 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Project steering committee chaired by chief secretary, with members consisting \nof principal or additional secretaries from the departments of urban development, \nfinance, commerce and industries, rural development, water resources, \nagriculture, higher education, and MPHIDB. \n(ii)  Executing agency  DTESD&E \n(iii)  Key implementing  DOSD, MPHIDB (responsible for procurement and supervision of upgrading \nagencies  works at ITIs) \n(iv)  Implementation unit  Project management unit under DOSD \nProcurement  International competitive bidding  1 contract (works)  $54.94 million \n1 contract (goods)  $24.17 million \nNational competitive bidding  3 contracts (works)  $44.21 million \n10 contracts (goods)  $16.59 million \nShopping  TBD  $3.80 million \nConsulting services  Quality- and cost-based selection  2 contracts  $6.23 million \nSingle source selection  3 contracts  $10.90 million \nQuality based selection  1 contract  $0.62 million \nIndividual  9\u201312  $2.16 million \nRetroactive financing  Applicable for civil works, equipment and materials, and consulting services, \nand/or advance contracting  following ADB policies and procedures.

To implement advanced training at the GSP, ITE and GIZ will be engaged through single \nsource  selection  based  on  their  previous  technical  cooperation  with  GOMP  in  TVET \ndevelopment.21 Their demonstrated experience in carrying out similar assignments in India and \nother countries also supports their engagement. Their services will include developing industry-\naligned  curricula  and  learning  contents  for  GSP  training,  building  the  capacity  of  trainers, \nestablishing industry links, and setting up credible assessment and certification systems. \n \nIII.  ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n20.  The attached TA is estimated to cost $2.2 million, of which $2.0 million will be financed on \na grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The TA will \nbuild the capacity of executing and implementing agencies by supporting start-up activities during \nthe initial 2 years. The TA will assist in (i) preparing operational guidelines and setting up the GSP \nSociety; (ii) developing implementation plans for ITI reform initiatives, such as performance-linked \nincentive schemes; (iii) conducting a tracer study of TVET graduates to establish baseline data; \n(iv)  designing  information  technology-based  TVET  and  career  guidance  modules;  and \n(v) organizing  knowledge-sharing  workshops  on  skills  and  TVET  management.  The  state \ngovernment will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office accommodation \nand supplies, and other in-kind contributions.22 \n \n \n                                                \n21  The single source selection was approved by ADB on 16 April 2018 as part of advance contracting. \n22  Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n21.  Training programs in the GSP and ITIs were selected based on skills-gap analysis, \ndemand assessments, consultations with industry groups, and discussions among ITI principals. \nTraining facilities at ITIs were designed with inputs from TVET, architectural, and engineering \nexperts to follow international and national standards in technology-oriented training and trade-\nspecific industry requirements. TVET expert inputs will continue during implementation to ensure \nthat all new training facilities meet the required building certification and expected standards for \nadvanced quality training. Although the project is rated low in climate risk assessment, the amount \nfor climate change financing and the level of carbon dioxide emission reduction will be estimated \nwhen building designs for the GSP are finalized.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n22.  Economic viability. The economic internal rate of return was estimated at 12.9%. The \nmain benefits considered in the analysis were wages earned after completing training at the GSP \nand ITIs. The main costs are civil works; equipment; private costs of trainees (i.e., training costs \nand opportunity costs); equipment replacement costs; and recurrent costs to sustain the quality \nof training programs. Sensitivity analysis was carried out with a 10% cost overrun (capital and \nrecurrent costs) and a 10% lower wage increase. In all cases, the economic internal rate of return \nexceeds the required rate of 6%, suggesting that the project is economically viable. \n \n23.  Financial sustainability. The project\u2019s sustainability will depend primarily on (i) the \ngovernment\u2019s ability to allocate adequate budget to TVET over time and (ii) the successful \noperation and efficient management of the new GSP. The GOMP has prioritized scaling up its \nskills initiatives, and TVET expenditure has increased significantly from \u20b92.9 billion in FY2012 to \n\u20b99.3 billion in FY2018. After project completion, incremental recurrent costs (about \u20b9734 million \nor $11.5 million per year) are estimated to account for about 5.1% of the total TVET budget in \nFY2024. In view of the state\u2019s strong economic growth and improved tax revenue, GOMP will be \nable to maintain its high commitment to TVET expenditures. Also, an autonomous GSP Society \nwill be set up to take charge of GSP operation and management after project completion. The \nproject will support the formulation of operational and business plans for the GSP in ways to \nmaximize its efficient management and long-term financial sustainability. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n24.  Financial management. The financial management risk is moderate mainly because the \nexecuting  agency  (DTESD&E)  and  implementing  agencies  (DOSD  and  MPHIDB)  have \nexperience in managing externally funded projects and are familiar with financial management \nand other fiduciary requirements by development partners. However, the project is the first ADB-\nfinanced project for the executing or implementing agencies. An experienced finance officer has \nbeen appointed to oversee the project and professional accountants will also be engaged for the \nPMU.  The  project  will  support  training  on  ADB\u2019s  financial  reporting,  project  accounting, \ndisbursement procedures, and audit requirements during implementation. While the implementing \nagencies follow the established Madhya Pradesh financial rules, they have limited internal audit \nfunctions. An independent audit firm will be engaged to undertake internal audits and strengthen \nfiduciary controls. \n \n ", "9 \n25.  Procurement. The procurement capacity assessment shows that DOSD and MPHIDB \nhave adequate capacity to carry out the project activities, given their experience in handling works \nfor public housing and ITIs. Since DOSD will procure relatively large civil works and equipment \nfor  the  GSP,  the  PMU  will  engage  experienced  procurement  staff.  Project  management \nconsultants will provide additional technical support and monitoring. All procurement of works, \ngoods, and services will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to \ntime) and ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time).23 \n  \n26.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government of India and the state\u2019s DTESD&E. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 19). \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n27.  Poverty in Madhya Pradesh had declined since 2004 but was still high at 32% in 2011 \ncompared to the national average of 22%.24 The state has high percentages of scheduled tribes \n(21%) and scheduled castes (15%), whose human capital indicators lag other groups. Also, \nsignificant gender differences exist in literacy (79% for men and 59% for women), labor force \nparticipation (60% for men and 15% for women), and unemployment (7.2% for men and 15.7% \nfor women) among those aged 18\u201329. The project includes targeted measures to improve training \nand employment prospects for these groups. The project is categorized as effective gender \nmainstreaming, and a gender equality and social inclusion plan was prepared. The key measures \ninclude (i) targeting 30% female enrollment for the GSP and ITI training, (ii) improving the skills \nof women trainers, (iii) constructing women\u2019s hostels in four ITIs and the GSP, and (iv) recruiting \nwomen as security guards for the women\u2019s hostels. The target trainees at the GSP and ITIs will \ninclude 50% from disadvantaged groups (21% scheduled tribes, 15% scheduled castes, and 14% \nother marginal groups combined); 30% women; and 6% people with disabilities. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n28.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.25 \n \n29.  Environment (category B). For civil works at the GSP and ITIs, potential environmental \nimpacts will be site-specific, reversible, and occur mostly during construction. During operation, \ntraining  facilities  will  require  adequate  water  and  waste  management.  Initial  environmental \nexamination reports, including environmental management plans, were prepared for each of the \nproject sites and disclosed on the ADB website. The implementation status of environmental \nmanagement plans will be monitored and reported to ADB semiannually. \n \n30.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). No land acquisition or resettlement impacts are \nexpected. All civil works will take place on government-owned land or within existing premises. \n \n31.  Indigenous peoples (category B). Given the high proportion of scheduled tribes and \nscheduled castes in the state, an indigenous peoples plan was prepared to ensure their access \nto training in the GSP and ITIs. No adverse impacts are envisaged for these groups; rather, \nmeasures in the plan will facilitate their access to better training and employment opportunities. \n                                                \n23  The concept paper for the project was approved in December 2016. GOMP will be informed on the availability of \nthe new procurement framework (2017). \n24  Government of India, Planning Commission. 2013. Press Note on Poverty Estimates, 2011\u20132012.

ASSURANCES \n \n33.  The Government of India, GOMP, and DTESD&E have assured ADB that implementation \nof  the  project  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning \nanticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the PAM and loan documents. \n \n34.
