Improvements  to  the  key  Maubin\u2013Phyapon  road  link  will \ndramatically  improve  connectivity,  reduce  travel  times,  and  support  economic  development  in \nthe area, lifting many in this poor region of Myanmar out of poverty. The project will rehabilitate \na key north\u2012south 54.5-kilometer (km) section of road to two lanes with shoulders of appropriate \nwidth, suitable for all standard highway traffic.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nMuch of Myanmar\u2019s primary road network is in poor condition, a consequence of several \n3. \ndecades  of  low  investment  in  new  construction,  rehabilitation,  and  maintenance  activities.  As \nthe country\u2019s economy begins to react to the political and economic changes that commenced in \n2011,  the  road  network\u2019s  condition  will  increasingly  become  an  impediment  to  economic  and \nsocial development, particularly in remote rural areas such as the Ayeyarwaddy Delta. \n \n4. \nThe  Ayeyarwaddy  Delta  is  Myanmar\u2019s  principal  rice  production  region  and  has  the \npotential for large-scale agribusiness and seafood industries. Although served by an extensive \ninland  waterway  network,  the  economic  activities  of  the  region  depend  heavily  on  its  existing \ncore  road  network.  This  network  has  largely  fallen  into  disrepair,  with  much  of  it  beyond \nconventional  maintenance  treatments.  As  a  consequence,  much  of  the  network  requires \ncomplete reconstruction. \n \n5. \nAn  important  link  in  this  network  is  the  road  from  Maubin  to  Phyapon,  which  traverses \nthe  rich  agricultural  area  on  the  southeastern  side  of  the  delta.  The  lack  of  an  effective  road \nsystem  is  a  significant  constraint to economic growth and development. Cash  crops  and  high-\nvalue seafood are not yet viable industries as the travel times along the existing road network \nplace the primary market of Yangon effectively out of reach. The project road would improve the \nnorth\u2012south road link connection in the delta and connect with the major east\u2012west road leading \nto Yangon. Improvements to the core road network would allow this highly productive region to \nrealize  its  economic  potential  and  greatly  enhance  its  agricultural  and  seafood  industries. \nRehabilitation  of  the  Maubin\u2013Phyapon  road  would  improve  access  to  this  densely  populated, \npoor, but productive agricultural area. \n \nThe region\u2019s road network was badly impacted by Cyclone Nargis, which made landfall \n6. \nin  the  Ayeyarwaddy  region  on  2  May  2008.  While  the  cyclone  and  associated  storm  surges \ndamaged  some  of  the  road  network,  damage  also  resulted  from  the  relief  efforts  with \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.

Manila. \n\n\f2 \n\noverloaded  trucks  delivering  supplies  and  humanitarian  aid,  causing  significant  and  long-term \ndamage to the roads, especially along the Maubin to Phyapon road section. \n \n7. \nThe Maubin\u2013Phyapon road is the principal north\u2012south artery on the eastern edge of the \nAyeyarwaddy  Delta  and  provides  an  essential  transport  link  connection  to  economic,  health, \neducation,  and  employment  opportunities.  Traffic  volumes  in  the  area  are  currently  moderate, \nbut are likely to increase rapidly as the country\u2019s economic liberalization program extends into \nthe hinterland. Freight traffic along the road is currently low due to weight restrictions at a key \nbridge along the road. By providing landing points at the numerous locations where waterways \nmeet  the  road,  the  agricultural  hinterland  of  this  part  of  the  delta  region  could  be  made  more \naccessible,  and  the  lives  of  many  of  the  region\u2019s  poor  could  be  improved  through  increased \nopportunities for income generation and improved rural livelihoods. \n \n8. \nThe  proposed  project  fully  supports  the  strategic  thrusts  of  the  Interim  Country \nPartnership  Strategy,  2012\u20132014  for  Myanmar. 3  The  project  supports  the  findings  of  the \nMyanmar Transport Sector Initial Assessment of the need for improved road maintenance and \nrehabilitation  coupled  with  capacity  development  of  government  staff. 4  To  support  the \ngovernment  with  this  priority  project  to  improve  connectivity  to  the  delta  region,  financing \nthrough  an  Asian  Development  Fund  loan  from  ADB  will  be  provided.  The  project,  one  of  the \nfirst  for  ADB  in  Myanmar  since  reengagement  in  2012,  includes  a  number  of  safeguard \nrequirements  which  are  not  complex  in  nature.  In  addition,  the  project  provides  ADB  an \nopportunity to work with the government to ensure a better understanding and compliance with \nADB\u2019s and other development partners\u2019 systems and procedures for lending assistance.5 \n \nThe  project  will  form  part  of  a  broader  engagement  with  the  government  in  the  road \n9. \nsubsector,  and  will  be  used  as  a  pilot  project  to  demonstrate  best  practices  as  part  of  the \nbroader  capacity  development  program. 6  The  support  will  help  institutional  and  capacity \ndevelopment of Public Works, a department of the Ministry of Construction (MOC). \n \nB. \n \n10. \nThe  project  impact  will  be  improved  economic  opportunities  in the  eastern seaboard of \nthe Ayeyarwaddy Delta. The project outcome will be reduced travel times and transport costs in \nthe project area.7 \n \nC. \n \n11. \nand (ii) improved testing facilities at MOC and Public Works laboratories and offices. \n \nOutput 1: Rehabilitated 54.5 kilometer road from Maubin to Phyapon. The completed \n12. \nroad  will  have  two  traffic  lanes  throughout  its  length,  with  about  50  km  of  flexible  pavement \nthrough rural  areas  and about  4.5 km  of  rigid  pavement  through  urban  areas,  specifically  in  the \ntownships  of  Kyaiklat  and  Phyapon.  The  rehabilitation  works  will  also  include  provision  of  a \npermanent two-lane superstructure for the existing Oo Yin Chaung bridge (Km. 25), replacement \n\nThe project will have two outputs: (i) rehabilitated 54.5 km road from Maubin to Phyapon, \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\n                                                \n3  ADB. 2012.

The  road  will  generally  follow  the  existing  vertical \nalignment, with some increase in height to improve (i) the clearance over seasonal flood levels, \nand (ii) possible future climate change-induced increases in river levels due to storm surge. The \nroad cross  section  outside  township areas will  typically  be  2 by  3.3  m traffic  lane carriageway \nwith  surfaced  shoulders  on  both  sides,  for  use  by  nonmotorized  traffic  and  pedestrians.  The \npavement  will  be  flexible,  with  asphaltic  concrete  surfacing.  The  cross  section  within  the \ntownships will typically be 2 by 3.5 m traffic lane carriageway with a rigid unreinforced concrete \npavement and unsurfaced shoulders. \n \n21. \nThe  proposed  pavement  structures  have  been  designed  using  appropriate  design \nmethods  based  on  traffic  projections  on  the  road  over  a  20-year  period  following  project \ncompletion,  essentially  from  2018  to  2038.9 The  traffic  projections  are  based  on  present traffic \nvolumes,  factoring  in  the  likely  rapid  increase  in  traffic  (in  terms  of  traffic  volume  and  loading) \nthat will occur as Myanmar\u2019s economy grows as a result of economic liberalization. \n \nB. \n \n22. \nThe project has an economic internal rate of return of 12.9%, with a net present value of \n$3.7  million  at  a  12%  discount  rate. 10  The  avoidance  of  road  maintenance  of  the  badly \ndeteriorated road offsets 2.1% of the cost of the project. The two main benefits are (i) reduced \nvehicle  operating  costs  (50.5%  of  the  total  benefits)  and  (ii)  reduced  travel  time  (39.0%),  with \nother benefits being fewer accidents (6.6%), generated traffic benefits (3.9%), and less pollution \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n                                                \n9  For  the  flexible  pavement:  ODA.  2013.

Additional  benefits  from  avoidance  of  potential  future  flooding  would  improve  the \neconomic merit of the project. The executing agency is a general government sector unit, and \nthe  project  is  nonrevenue  generating.  The  financial  analysis  concludes  that  the  executing \nagency has sufficient financial capacity to cover the recurrent expenditures of maintaining and \noperating the project in a sustainable manner. \n \nC. \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n23. \nwith the government and MOC. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare  described  in  the  project  administration  manual  (footnote  8).  The  financial  management \nassessment  undertaken  during  project  preparation  reveals  that  while  the  MOC  and  Public \nWorks are adequately qualified and staffed for financial management of development projects, \nthey  have  no  experience  with  ADB  financial  management  policies  and  implementation \nprocedures. Additional training with respect to ADB loan disbursement procedures and financial \nmanagement  practices  for  the  accounting  staff  of  MOC  and  Public  Works  is  included  in  the \nscope  of  the  supervision  consulting  services.  With  this  additional  support,  the  financial \narrangements for the project are suitable for project implementation. In addition, the project will \nestablish  a  financial  management  system  to  align  donor  assistance  with  modernization  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s  public  finance  management  policies  and  procedures. 11  The  MOC  and  Public \nWorks will maintain project records and accounts that identify works and services financed from \nADB loan proceeds, allowing the MOC to meet its objectives related to modernizing its financial \nmanagement  systems.  Annual  audits,  in  accordance  with  national  auditing  standards,  will  be \nundertaken  by  an  independent  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB.  Public  disclosure  of  the  project\u2019s \nincluding  annual  audit  reports,  will  be  guided  by  ADB\u2019s  Public \nfinancial  statements, \nCommunications Policy (2011). \n \n24. \nThe government is committed to promoting good governance and addressing corruption. \nThe  Anticorruption  Commission  was formed  in  January  2013,  and  the  Anticorruption  Law  was \npromulgated in July 2013. \n \nD. \n \n25. \nBased  on  the  social  impact  assessment  undertaken  in  December  2013,  the  project \nsupports  poverty  reduction  and  provides  long-term  positive  impacts  such  as  better  access  to \nbasic  facilities  and  services,  faster  and  more  convenient  travel,  and  job  opportunities  for  the \nlocal  communities  during  construction.  However,  there  are  also  adverse  impacts  such  as \nphysical  and  economic  displacement  of  households  due  to  clearance  along  the  corridor  of \nimpact,  and  increased  risks  of  HIV/AIDS  transmission  and  human  trafficking.  To  ensure  that \nbenefits are maximized and adverse impacts are addressed, a summary poverty reduction and \nsocial strategy has been prepared.12 The gender categorization of the project is \u201csome gender \nelements\u201d  and  includes  provisions  for  female  labor,  gender-sensitive  design  features  such  as \nroad shoulders, and gender issues in the resettlement plan. The project is not considered to be \nwithin  a  conflict-affected  area.  However,  conflict  sensitive  approaches  and  community \nconsultations will be followed where appropriate in project implementation.13 \n \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n                                                \n11 World Bank. 2014.

The \ndominant  land  use  along  the  project  road  is  agricultural  (primarily  rice  production).  The  road \ncorridor  is  not  within  undisturbed  landscapes,  mangrove  areas,  or  near  environmentally \nprotected  areas.  The  project  will  not  encroach  on  environmentally  sensitive  sites.  An  initial \nenvironmental  examination  has  been  prepared  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the  Safeguard \nPolicy Statement. An environmental management plan has been prepared as part of the  initial \nenvironmental  examination.  The  environmental  management  plan  defines  the  institutional \narrangements and responsibilities for its implementation, and includes an environmental training \nprogram  for  the  MOC  and  Public  Works  to  develop  their  capacity  in  environmental \nmanagement. The environmental management plan is to be incorporated into the project\u2019s road \nrehabilitation  civil  works  contract  documentation.  A  grievance  redress  mechanism  has  been \ndeveloped to facilitate resolution of construction-related environmental impacts. \n \n28. \nThe  project  identified  62  affected  households  and  one  government  office  within  the \ncorridor  of  impact,  with  some  of  the  affected  households  relocated  during  project  preparation. \nThe affected households were consulted in 2014 and were informed about the proposed project, \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  and  proposed  assistance  due  to  displacement.  A \nresettlement  plan  has  been  prepared,  which  includes  corrective  actions  for  those  affected \nhouseholds  who  have  already  relocated,  based  on  the  tracer  study  carried  out  during  project \npreparation.  The  project  is  categorized  as  C  for  indigenous  peoples  as  the  homogenous \npopulation is well integrated and the road does not directly impact on any indigenous peoples. \n \n29. \nTraining on social safeguards will be provided to the MOC, Public Works, and concerned \nlocal  authorities  under  the  construction  supervision  consultant  contract  and  under  a  parallel \ntechnical assistance.14 \n \n30. \nIn  compliance  with  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  requirements  on  information \ndisclosure and consultation, the initial environmental examination and resettlement plan will be \nposted on ADB\u2019s website before the project is considered by the ADB Board of Directors. \n \nF. \n \n31.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan. 15 The  combined  benefits  of  the  project \nimpacts are expected to outweigh the project costs. \n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nImplementation \ndelays due to lack of \nfamiliarity with ADB \nguidelines and \nprocedures on \n                                                \n14 ADB.  2010.
