THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of the Union of Myanmar for the Maubin\u2013Phyapon Road Rehabilitation Project.1 \n \n2.  Access  to  the  agriculturally  rich  Ayeyarwaddy  Delta  is  currently  poor,  restraining \neconomic  growth  for  the  region.  Improvements  to  the  key  Maubin\u2013Phyapon  road  link  will \ndramatically improve connectivity, reduce travel times, and support economic development in \nthe area, lifting many in this poor region of Myanmar out of poverty. The project will rehabilitate \na key north\u2012south 54.5-kilometer (km) section of road to two lanes with shoulders of appropriate \nwidth, suitable for all standard highway traffic.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Much of Myanmar\u2019s primary road network is in poor condition, a consequence of several \ndecades of low investment in new construction, rehabilitation, and maintenance activities. As \nthe country\u2019s economy begins to react to the political and economic changes that commenced in \n2011, the road network\u2019s condition will increasingly become an impediment to economic and \nsocial development, particularly in remote rural areas such as the Ayeyarwaddy Delta. \n \n4.  The  Ayeyarwaddy  Delta  is  Myanmar\u2019s  principal  rice  production  region  and  has  the \npotential for large-scale agribusiness and seafood industries. Although served by an extensive \ninland waterway network, the economic activities of the region depend heavily on its existing \ncore  road  network.  This  network  has  largely  fallen  into  disrepair,  with  much  of  it  beyond \nconventional  maintenance  treatments.  As  a  consequence,  much  of  the  network  requires \ncomplete reconstruction. \n \n5.  An important link in this network is the road from Maubin to Phyapon, which traverses \nthe rich agricultural area on the southeastern side of the delta. The lack of an effective road \nsystem is a significant constraint to economic growth and development. Cash crops and high-\nvalue seafood are not yet viable industries as the travel times along the existing road network \nplace the primary market of Yangon effectively out of reach. The project road would improve the \nnorth\u2012south road link connection in the delta and connect with the major east\u2012west road leading \nto Yangon. Improvements to the core road network would allow this highly productive region to \nrealize  its  economic  potential  and  greatly  enhance  its  agricultural  and  seafood  industries. \nRehabilitation of the Maubin\u2013Phyapon road would improve access to this densely populated, \npoor, but productive agricultural area. \n \n6.  The region\u2019s road network was badly impacted by Cyclone Nargis, which made landfall \nin the Ayeyarwaddy region on 2 May 2008. While the cyclone and associated storm surges \ndamaged  some  of  the  road  network,  damage  also  resulted  from  the  relief  efforts  with \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance. ADB. 2012. Technical Assistance to the Republic of the \nUnion of Myanmar for Capacity Building Support for Project Identification. Manila (TA 8251-MYA, approved on 10 \nDecember for $1,500,000). Resources from this technical assistance were used to undertake due diligence on the \nproject. ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u2013\n2020. Manila; ADB. 2014. Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: Meeting the Challenges of a Transforming Asia and \nPacific. Manila. ", "2 \noverloaded trucks delivering supplies and humanitarian aid, causing significant and long-term \ndamage to the roads, especially along the Maubin to Phyapon road section. \n \n7.  The Maubin\u2013Phyapon road is the principal north\u2012south artery on the eastern edge of the \nAyeyarwaddy Delta and provides an essential transport link connection to economic, health, \neducation, and employment opportunities. Traffic volumes in the area are currently moderate, \nbut are likely to increase rapidly as the country\u2019s economic liberalization program extends into \nthe hinterland. Freight traffic along the road is currently low due to weight restrictions at a key \nbridge along the road. By providing landing points at the numerous locations where waterways \nmeet the road, the agricultural hinterland of this part of the delta region could be made more \naccessible, and the lives of many of the region\u2019s poor could be improved through increased \nopportunities for income generation and improved rural livelihoods. \n \n8.  The  proposed  project  fully  supports  the  strategic  thrusts  of  the  Interim  Country \nPartnership  Strategy,  2012\u20132014  for  Myanmar.3 The  project  supports  the  findings  of  the \nMyanmar Transport Sector Initial Assessment of the need for improved road maintenance and \nrehabilitation  coupled  with  capacity  development  of  government  staff. 4  To  support  the \ngovernment  with  this  priority  project  to  improve  connectivity  to  the  delta  region,  financing \nthrough an Asian Development Fund loan from ADB will be provided. The project, one of the \nfirst  for  ADB  in  Myanmar  since  reengagement  in  2012,  includes  a  number  of  safeguard \nrequirements  which  are  not  complex  in  nature.  In  addition,  the  project  provides  ADB  an \nopportunity to work with the government to ensure a better understanding and compliance with \nADB\u2019s and other development partners\u2019 systems and procedures for lending assistance.5 \n \n9.  The project will form part of a broader engagement with the government in the road \nsubsector, and will be used as a pilot project to demonstrate best practices as part of the \nbroader  capacity  development  program.6 The  support  will  help  institutional  and  capacity \ndevelopment of Public Works, a department of the Ministry of Construction (MOC). \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The project impact will be improved economic opportunities in the eastern seaboard of \nthe Ayeyarwaddy Delta. The project outcome will be reduced travel times and transport costs in \nthe project area.7 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n11.  The project will have two outputs: (i) rehabilitated 54.5 km road from Maubin to Phyapon, \nand (ii) improved testing facilities at MOC and Public Works laboratories and offices. \n \n12.  Output 1: Rehabilitated 54.5 kilometer road from Maubin to Phyapon. The completed \nroad will have two traffic lanes throughout its length, with about 50 km of flexible pavement \nthrough rural areas and about 4.5 km of rigid pavement through urban areas, specifically in the \ntownships of Kyaiklat and Phyapon. The rehabilitation works will also include provision of a \npermanent two-lane superstructure for the existing Oo Yin Chaung bridge (Km. 25), replacement \n                                                \n3  ADB. 2012.

To ensure resilience against future \ncyclones, the road rehabilitation includes climate-resilient design components. \n \n13.  Output 2: Improved testing facilities at Ministry of Construction and Public Works \nlaboratories and offices. The project will finance the purchase of (i) testing facilities for MOC \nand  Public  Works  laboratories  and  offices,  and  for  Yangon  Road  Research  Laboratory; \n(ii) bridge testing equipment; and (iii) testing equipment at Public Works offices. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing \n \n14.  The project is estimated to cost SDR52,695,000 ($80.8 million equivalent) (Table 1). \nPhysical and price contingencies account for $16.5 million equivalent and financing charges for \nthe remaining $1.6 million equivalent.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  The  project\u2019s  executing  agency  will  be  the  MOC,  and  Public  Works  will  be  the \nimplementing  agency.  Public  Works  will  establish  a  project  management  unit  that  will  be \nresponsible for the day-to-day management of the project. The project management unit will be \nheaded by a full-time project director of at least a superintendent engineer level, and will be \nstaffed  with  engineering,  financial,  administrative,  and  safeguards  specialists.  The  project \nmanagement unit will be based in Nay Pyi Taw, with an appropriately staffed and resourced \noffice within the project area. \n \n17.  The  rehabilitation  of  the  project  road  will  be  implemented  through  two  civil  works \ncontracts covering (i) the section of the project road from Maubin to  Km. 25, and (ii) the \nremaining length of the road to Phyapon, including within Kyaiklat and Phyapon towns. Each \ncontract will include all works within its length. The Yangon Road Research Laboratory contract \nunder the capacity development program will be procured under national competitive bidding \nprocedures.  All  works  contracts  will  be  procured  following  procedures  set  out  in  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). The government has requested \nthat ADB\u2019s domestic preference provisions be applied for the project\u2019s civil works contracts. \n \n18.   The civil works contracts will be supervised by a construction supervision consultant, \nwho  will  be  the  engineer for  the  contracts  as  defined  in  the  contract  documentation. The \nconsultant will be an international consulting firm engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time) and working with a national \nconsulting firm or directly with national specialists. The consultant will be recruited through \nquality-  and  cost-based  selection.  The  scope  of  the  services  will  include  design  review, \nconstruction  supervision,  and  environment  and  resettlement  monitoring.  For  the  capacity \ndevelopment  program  under  the  project,  the  services  will  be  provided  by  an  international \nconsultant  working  with  national  consultants,  also  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n \n19.   The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe project administration manual.8 \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  April 2015\u2013March 2018 \nEstimated completion date  September 2018 \nManagement \n(i)  Executing agency  Ministry of Construction \n                                                \n8  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "5 \nAspects   Arrangements \n(ii) Implementing agency  Public Works, Ministry of Construction \n(iii) Implementation unit  Project Management Unit (Nat Pyi Taw and project area, 8 staff \nproposed) \nProcurement  International competitive  2 contracts  $60.0 million \nbidding \nNational competitive bidding  4 contracts  $2.5 million \nConsulting services  Construction supervision  69 international  $4.0 million \nQuality- and cost-based  person-months \n  selection  411 national \nperson-months \nAdvance contracting  Advance contracting for civil works and construction supervision \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2012,  as \namended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed \nupon between the government and the Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n20.  The road will follow the present alignment, with an offset of 2 meters (m) to 3 m left or \nright where necessary to avoid interfering with an existing telecommunications cable laid within \nor  adjacent  to  the  road  embankment.  The  road  will  generally  follow  the  existing  vertical \nalignment, with some increase in height to improve (i) the clearance over seasonal flood levels, \nand (ii) possible future climate change-induced increases in river levels due to storm surge. The \nroad cross section outside township areas will typically be 2 by 3.3 m traffic lane carriageway \nwith surfaced shoulders on both sides, for use by nonmotorized traffic and pedestrians. The \npavement  will  be  flexible,  with  asphaltic  concrete  surfacing.  The  cross  section  within  the \ntownships will typically be 2 by 3.5 m traffic lane carriageway with a rigid unreinforced concrete \npavement and unsurfaced shoulders. \n \n21.  The  proposed  pavement  structures  have  been  designed  using  appropriate  design \nmethods  based  on  traffic  projections  on  the  road  over  a  20-year  period  following  project \ncompletion, essentially from 2018 to 2038.9 The traffic projections are based on present traffic \nvolumes, factoring in the likely rapid increase in traffic (in terms of traffic volume and loading) \nthat will occur as Myanmar\u2019s economy grows as a result of economic liberalization. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n22.  The project has an economic internal rate of return of 12.9%, with a net present value of \n$3.7  million  at  a  12%  discount  rate.10 The  avoidance  of  road  maintenance  of  the  badly \ndeteriorated road offsets 2.1% of the cost of the project. The two main benefits are (i) reduced \nvehicle operating costs (50.5% of the total benefits) and (ii) reduced travel time (39.0%), with \nother benefits being fewer accidents (6.6%), generated traffic benefits (3.9%), and less pollution \n                                                \n9  For the flexible pavement: ODA. 2013.

Additional  benefits from  avoidance  of  potential future flooding  would  improve  the \neconomic merit of the project. The executing agency is a general government sector unit, and \nthe  project  is  nonrevenue  generating.  The  financial  analysis  concludes  that  the  executing \nagency has sufficient financial capacity to cover the recurrent expenditures of maintaining and \noperating the project in a sustainable manner. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n23.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and MOC. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the project administration manual (footnote 8). The financial management \nassessment  undertaken  during  project  preparation  reveals  that  while  the  MOC  and  Public \nWorks are adequately qualified and staffed for financial management of development projects, \nthey  have  no  experience  with  ADB  financial  management  policies  and  implementation \nprocedures. Additional training with respect to ADB loan disbursement procedures and financial \nmanagement practices for the accounting staff of MOC and Public Works is included in the \nscope  of  the  supervision  consulting  services.  With  this  additional  support,  the  financial \narrangements for the project are suitable for project implementation. In addition, the project will \nestablish a financial management system to align donor assistance with modernization of the \ngovernment\u2019s  public finance management  policies  and  procedures.11 The  MOC  and  Public \nWorks will maintain project records and accounts that identify works and services financed from \nADB loan proceeds, allowing the MOC to meet its objectives related to modernizing its financial \nmanagement systems. Annual audits, in accordance with national auditing standards, will be \nundertaken by an independent auditor acceptable to ADB. Public disclosure of the project\u2019s \nfinancial  statements,  including  annual  audit  reports,  will  be  guided  by  ADB\u2019s  Public \nCommunications Policy (2011). \n \n24.  The government is committed to promoting good governance and addressing corruption. \nThe Anticorruption Commission was formed in January 2013, and the Anticorruption Law was \npromulgated in July 2013. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n25.  Based on the social impact assessment undertaken in December 2013, the project \nsupports poverty reduction and provides long-term positive impacts such as better access to \nbasic facilities and services, faster and more convenient travel, and job opportunities for the \nlocal  communities  during  construction.  However,  there  are  also  adverse  impacts  such  as \nphysical and economic displacement of households due to clearance along the corridor of \nimpact, and increased risks of HIV/AIDS transmission and human trafficking. To ensure that \nbenefits are maximized and adverse impacts are addressed, a summary poverty reduction and \nsocial strategy has been prepared.12 The gender categorization of the project is \u201csome gender \nelements\u201d and includes provisions for female labor, gender-sensitive design features such as \nroad shoulders, and gender issues in the resettlement plan. The project is not considered to be \nwithin  a  conflict-affected  area.  However,  conflict  sensitive  approaches  and  community \nconsultations will be followed where appropriate in project implementation.13 \n \n                                                \n11 World Bank. 2014.

Safeguards \n \n26.  The project is categorized as B for environment and involuntary resettlement, and C for \nindigenous peoples in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \n \n27.  The project is not anticipated to cause significant adverse environmental impacts. The \ndominant land use along the project road is agricultural (primarily rice production). The road \ncorridor  is  not  within  undisturbed  landscapes,  mangrove  areas,  or  near  environmentally \nprotected areas. The project will not encroach on environmentally sensitive sites. An initial \nenvironmental examination has been prepared to meet the requirements of the  Safeguard \nPolicy Statement. An environmental management plan has been prepared as part of the initial \nenvironmental  examination.  The  environmental  management  plan  defines  the  institutional \narrangements and responsibilities for its implementation, and includes an environmental training \nprogram  for  the  MOC  and  Public  Works  to  develop  their  capacity  in  environmental \nmanagement. The environmental management plan is to be incorporated into the project\u2019s road \nrehabilitation civil works contract documentation. A grievance redress mechanism has been \ndeveloped to facilitate resolution of construction-related environmental impacts. \n \n28.  The project identified 62 affected households and one government office within the \ncorridor of impact, with some of the affected households relocated during project preparation. \nThe affected households were consulted in 2014 and were informed about the proposed project, \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  and  proposed  assistance  due  to  displacement.  A \nresettlement  plan  has  been  prepared,  which  includes  corrective  actions  for  those  affected \nhouseholds who have already relocated, based on the tracer study carried out during project \npreparation.  The  project  is  categorized  as  C  for  indigenous  peoples  as  the  homogenous \npopulation is well integrated and the road does not directly impact on any indigenous peoples. \n \n29.  Training on social safeguards will be provided to the MOC, Public Works, and concerned \nlocal authorities under the construction supervision consultant contract and under a parallel \ntechnical assistance.14 \n \n30.  In  compliance  with  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  requirements  on  information \ndisclosure and consultation, the initial environmental examination and resettlement plan will be \nposted on ADB\u2019s website before the project is considered by the ADB Board of Directors. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n31.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.15 The combined benefits of the project \nimpacts are expected to outweigh the project costs. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nImplementation  ADB  will  provide  support  to  the  MOC  and  Public  Works  with  advance \ndelays due to lack of  procurement action to ensure bid contracts are prepared, advertised, evaluated, \nfamiliarity with ADB  and assessed prior to loan effectiveness. Necessary capacity building for the \nguidelines and  procurement,  engagement  of  consultants,  disbursements,  and  financial \nprocedures on  management will be provided.

The government and the MOC have assured ADB that implementation of the project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n33.  The government and the MOC have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \nproject, which are set forth in the loan agreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n34.
