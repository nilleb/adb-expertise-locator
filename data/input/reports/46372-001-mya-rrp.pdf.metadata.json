I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \npolicy-based loan to the Republic of the Union of Myanmar for the Support for Myanmar\u2018s \nReforms for Inclusive Growth Program.1  \n \n2.  The policy-based loan (PBL) supports the government\u2018s efforts to provide the foundation \nfor  a  more  inclusive  economy  through  transformational  changes  to  macroeconomic  policy \ninstitutions, taking the first steps to enhance transparency and integrity in tax administration, \nstrengthening public financial management (PFM) for better service delivery, business climate \nreforms, and trade liberalization. Reform priorities also include efforts to provide the foundation \nfor promoting inclusive growth through human capital development and initiating market-based \nincentives for stimulating rural development. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The government has made reengagement with the global community a central tenet of \nits reform program. This reengagement has come about in the context of economic reforms \nprecipitated  by  historic  political  reforms,  including  steps  toward  more  democratic  political \ninstitutions. Initiating a framework for a more permanent peace in sub-national conflict regions is \nalso  central  to  the  government\u2018s  political  and  economic  reforms.2 These  twin  reforms  are \ninterdependent and together are signaling to the international community the government\u2018s \ncommitment to implement real change so as to reintegrate the economy with global markets \nand thereby restore sustainable and inclusive economic growth. \n \n4.  The  government\u2018s  economic  agenda  is  large,  complex,  and  long  term.  While  the \ngovernment has done much to lay the building blocks for a market economy, much more needs \nto be done in the areas of macroeconomic policy, trade, investment, and small and medium-\nsized enterprise (SME) development to complete this transition. Stimulating rural development \nand  human  capital  development  for  the  poor  are  vital  for  ensuring  growth  is  inclusive. \nStrengthening PFM systems is also central to ensuring transparent and efficient delivery of \npublic services for inclusive growth. The government recognizes these challenges and has \nrecently announced these areas as key priorities of the draft national development plan 2011\u2013\n2015 that has been submitted to parliament.3 The government also recognizes that the reform \npath will not be easy; there will be many complex challenges along the way, including balancing \ndifferent stakeholder interests and resolving sub-national conflicts and management of these \nchallenges will depend on how the reforms are prioritized, sequenced, and paced over time.  \n \n5.  Economic  growth  and  poverty  incidence.  Myanmar\u2018s  disengagement  with  global \nmarkets since the late 1980s has meant that the economy has not benefited from globalization \nin terms of increased trade, investment, technology transfer, and acquisition of knowledge of \ngood practices in a wide range of sectors, including public governance. This disengagement has \nresulted  in  institutions  being  unfamiliar  with  the  efficient  functions  of  a  market  economy, \nrelatively low economic growth and a relatively high incidence of poverty compared to regional \npeers. Thus, lifting investment growth will be critical for creating higher and sustainable growth.4  \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  For an overview of political developments in Myanmar see: International Crisis Group. 2011.

Jakarta and Brussels (30 November).  \n3  Extracted from the English translation of the speech by President U Thein Sein delivered to senior government \nofficials on 19 June 2012. \n4  ADB. 2012. Myanmar in Transition. Manila \n ", "2 \n \n6.  Despite  progress,  poverty  remains  a  key  challenge.  According  to  results  from  the \nIntegrated Household Living Conditions Survey in Myanmar: Poverty Profile (2009\u20132010),5 the \nnational poverty incidence is estimated at 25.6%; the rate is higher (29.2%) in rural areas, \nwhere about 84.0% of the poor reside. Data also suggest significant regional income disparities \nwith strikingly high rates of poverty incidence in the states of Chin (73%), Rakhine (44%), \nTanintharyi (33%), Shan (33%), and Ayeyarwardy (32%). Conflict areas are characterized by \nhigher  than  average  poverty  rates.  The  survey  shows  a  strong  correlation  between  the \nincidence  of  poverty  and  families\u2018  access  to  economic  opportunities  (such  as  wage \nemployment), economic resources (such as land and credit), infrastructure and basic services, \nand post-primary education.6  \n \n7.  Macroeconomic stability. Maintaining macroeconomic stability\u2014low price inflation\u2014\nhas been a major challenge for Myanmar authorities. The country has experienced frequent \nepisodes of very high inflation from 1990 to 2005. High rates of food inflation in particular hurt \nthe urban poor the most as food accounts for more than 70% of their consumption and the poor \ndo not have assets to hedge against inflation. Central bank financing of the fiscal deficit has \nbeen  the  primary  cause  of  Myanmar\u2018s  high  inflation  environment.  In  recent  years,  the \ngovernment has managed to lower inflation to single-digit figures on the back of lower money \nsupply growth from less deficit financing by the Central Bank of Myanmar (CBM). Nevertheless, \nMyanmar faces long-term risks to macroeconomic stability. These arise from fiscal risks related \nto: (i) increased reliance on resource revenues in the Union budget, which are vulnerable to \nvolatile commodity price cycles; and (ii) continued partial monetization of the budget deficit. \nAvailability of limited monetary policy levers to contain money supply growth and sterilize capital \ninflows also poses risks to maintaining macroeconomic stability.7  \n \n8.  Weak investment climate. Insufficient investor protection, a cumbersome and complex \nlicensing and regulatory environment, and dominance of state economic enterprises in key \nsectors of the economy have suppressed investments in Myanmar. The regulatory environment \nis complex, costly, and unpredictable. It can take up to 6 months for an investment license to be \napproved, as it requires cabinet approval and up to two months to get the first companies \nregistration certificate. The finance sector is very shallow, dominated by the banking sector, and \nexcessively  regulated,  and  this  has  been  a  drag  on  investment  (footnote  7).  International \nfinancial sanctions also suppressed foreign direct investment and trade. These impediments are \nparticularly burdensome on SMEs, which have limited access to credit, technology and skilled \nworkers. \n \n9.  Limited  trade  integration.  Myanmar\u2018s  trade  volume  with  the  rest  of  the  world  is \nrelatively small. Exports are concentrated in resources (especially gas), minerals, and timber, \nwhich together account for 58.0% of total exports. Labor-intensive manufacturing exports and \nagriculture and marine exports are small, amounting to $2 billion in 2010. Imports and exports \nare restricted through a complex non-automatic licensing system meaning that applications for \nlicenses to import and export goods are not approved automatically and need to be reviewed by \nthe  Ministry  of  Commerce  (MOC)  first.  Trade  was  also  restricted  by  the  foreign  currency \nrationing scheme under the government\u2018s \u2017export first\u2018 policy whereby importers must export \ngoods and services first before gaining access to foreign currency. Micro-infrastructure for trade \nfacilitation\u2014such  as  customs  procedures,  trade  logistics,  and  sanitary  and  phytosanitary \n                                                \n5  Ministry of National Planning and Economic Development. 2010.

Improving sanitary and phytosanitary standards, especially \nfood management systems, is critical to improving SME access to export markets and building \nconfidence in the recovering tourism industry.  \n \n10.  Rural  development.  The  majority  of  people  reside  in  rural  areas  and  obtain  their \nlivelihoods  from  agricultural  activities.  About  54.0%  of  poor  people  are  engaged  in  such \nactivities. Thus, stimulating rural development will be an important part of the government\u2018s \nlonger-term poverty reduction strategy. The agriculture sector is primarily subsistence farming \nwith low productivity levels, and it is vulnerable to natural disasters. There are also limited off-\nfarm income opportunities in rural areas. Several key constraints on rural development have \nbeen identified, including pervasive rural infrastructure deficits, restrictions on land usage rights, \npoorly developed support services, and low human capital. Farmers\u2018 limited access to credit, \ninsurance,  and  financial  inclusion  is  a  major  constraint  on  productivity  increase,  crop \ndiversification,  and  risk  mitigation.  Previously  imposed  commercial  taxes  on  exports  of \nagricultural goods hurt farmers\u2018 incentives to produce.8  \n \n11.  Human capital development. Strengthening human capital will be critical to promoting \nlonger-term economic growth, and also to ensuring that the poor rural populations and other \ndisadvantaged  groups  can  participate  in  and  benefit  from  the  growth  and  broader \nsocioeconomic transitions that are now occurring. Myanmar has significantly underinvested in \nthe social sectors, e.g., public spending on education and health is less than 2% of GDP. \nMoreover,  private  sector  participation  in  the  education  sector  has  been  restricted.  While \nMyanmar has achieved important gains in expanding access to primary education, progress has \nlagged in post-primary education. According to the Integrated Household Living Conditions \nSurvey in Myanmar: Poverty Profile (2009\u20132010) (footnote 5), the national net enrollment rate \nfor secondary schools was 52.5% in 2010, with huge regional disparities ranging from 32.7% in \nRakhine to 73.8% in Yangon. Post-primary education faces three major gaps\u2014in equitable \naccess, education quality and relevance (that undermines education outcomes), and education \nmanagement (that undermines efficiency in the sector)\u2014that tend to disproportionately affect \npoor populations and localities.9  \n \n12.  Governance.  Ensuring improvements  in  PFM for  better  public  service  delivery  and \ndevelopment  effectiveness  will  be  central  to  Myanmar\u2018s  development  challenges.  On  the \nrevenue administration side, limited tax revenue collection has resulted in suppressed public \nspending, especially in the social sectors of education and health. Tax revenue collections \namount  to  about  4%  of  GDP,  among  the  lowest  in  the  region.  Revenue  management  is \nchallenged by: (i) limited sources of tax revenue; (ii) a complicated tax structure that encourages \ntax avoidance; (iii) weak tax administration resulting in a small taxpayer base; and (iv) lack of \ntransparency in the collection and recording of income taxes collected from the resource sector.  \n \n13.  On the expenditure administration side, there is a need to ensure the public expenditure \nprogram is balanced between capital spending and recurrent expenditures. This will require \ncontinued  reorientation  of  spending  toward  the  priority  sectors  of  education,  health,  and \nproductive  public  infrastructure.  Increased  public  spending  will  also  require  supporting \nmeasures to improve PFM systems. There are significant weaknesses in budget transparency, \nplanning, and execution; public procurement; and reporting and accounting. These undermine \ngovernment effectiveness in responding to emerging policy priorities. The present budgeting \npractice is input-based incremental and largely top down, with little regard to performance or \n                                                \n8  Sector Assessment (Summary): Agriculture and Natural Resources (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n9  Sector Assessment (Summary): Post-Primary Education (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n2). \n ", "4 \nservice delivery. Capital and recurrent budgets are prepared separately. There are inadequate \ninternal control and audit systems. There is no strategic perspective in debt management and, \nwith the CBM gaining more operational autonomy in the future, the Ministry of Finance and \nRevenue (MOFR) will need to assume more of the debt management functions from the CBM, \nstarting with \"back office\" functions such as accounting, recording, and reporting on MOFR \ndomestic and external debt. The government does recognize these weaknesses and intends to \nprepare measures for strengthening its PFM. For the first time, the government submitted the \nFY2012 union budget to Parliament for review and approval, and resumed the publication of the \nunion budget in the national media after several years of not doing so. \n \n14.  Lessons  for reengagement. ADB\u2018s reengagement with post-conflict Cambodia and \nViet Nam in the early 1990s provides important lessons for assisting Myanmar in its early reform \nperiod. These lessons include the following: (i) policy reforms are more likely to achieve their \noutcomes and have impact if they are owned by the country and are an integral part of the \ncountry\u2018s reform agenda within an agreed performance framework; (ii) programs should focus \non assisting Myanmar crystallize its reform agenda, including prioritizing reforms and defining \nthe sequence and pace of reforms; and (iii) introduction of good practice policy reforms adapted \nto the country\u2018s situation  through significant levels of knowledge support through technical \nassistance.  \n \n15.  Policy-based lending approach. The proposed PBL incorporates these lessons and is \ndesigned to support and sustain the government\u2018s reforms for inclusive growth. The PBL is also \naligned with ADB\u2018s interim country partnership strategy, 2012-2014, which has the medium-term \ngoal of assisting the government in promoting inclusive economic development.10 The PBL is \ndesigned to reflect the unique features of Myanmar\u2018s reengagement with ADB in two respects. \nFirst, Myanmar has debt arrears with the ADB and the World Bank and other development \npartners. Separate third party bridge loans have been prepared to clear debt arrears with ADB \nand  the World  Bank,  and  once  arrears  are  cleared  this  will  allow  ADB full  resumption of \noperations with Myanmar. The proposed PBL in a corresponding amount to the third party \nbridge  loan  (and  a  longer  tenure)  will  help  the  government  repay  the  bridge  loan.11 This \napproach ensures there is no fiduciary risk to use of the PBL loan proceeds. It  will allow \nMyanmar to better manage its limited gross international reserves of about 4 months import \ncover, contribute to Myanmar\u2018s improved debt sustainability and improve Myanmar\u2018s future \naccess to much needed external development financing.12 Second, the proposed PBL, the \nGovernment of Japan\u2018s policy loan, and the World Bank development policy operation are jointly \ndesigned to help sustain the government\u2018s medium term reform agenda. As expected in the \nearly stages of reengagement, the government\u2018s reform agenda is still developing and the \nbenefits  are  only  likely  to  show  up  in  the  medium  to  long  term.  Therefore,  policy \naccomplishments under the PBL will be advanced by a post-program partnership framework \n(P3F) detailing planned activities aimed at sustaining future reforms for inclusive growth through \ngeneral interventions and preparations for targeted sector interventions such as in education. \nTechnical assistance has been and will be provided by ADB and other development partners to \n                                                \n10 ADB. 2012. Country Partnership Strategy: Myanmar, 2012-2014. Manila \n11 A waiver of ADB\u2018s policy that no loans to a borrower with arrears to ADB is required to minimize the tenure of the \nbridge loan (para 41 (ii)). Also, the PBL loan will not become effective until the government\u2018s arrears to ADB has \nbeen fully repaid (para 40). \n12 IMF and World Bank. 2012. Myanmar: Staff Report for the 2012 Staff Monitored Program - Debt Sustainability \nAnalysis.  Washington (29 November). Based on the results of the debt sustainability analysis, clearance of debt \narrears with ADB, World Bank and official creditors would bring Myanmar\u2018s classification to low risk of debt \ndistress.  \n ", "5 \nsupport the government\u2018s medium-term reforms (Appendix 4). Three ADB small-scale technical \nassistance provided input to the formulation of the PBL, P3F and the medium-term framework.13  \n \n16.  Development coordination. The strategic focus of major development partners is to \nreengage with the government and stakeholders with the aim of resuming full operations in the \nnear term. The initial step towards full resumption of operations is Myanmar\u2018s resolution of its \ndebt arrears to multilateral financial institutions (MFIs) and official creditors. The ADB and World \nBank  have  worked  closely  with  the  government  to  resolve  Myanmar\u2018s  debt  arrears.  This \nincluded identifying the third-party bridge loan to clear debt arrears. ADB and World Bank have \nworked closely with the government to formulate their respective policy matrixes and planned \nactivities supporting a common reform agenda. The policy matrixes are similar in content. ADB \nand the World Bank have also closely coordinated operations with the Government of Japan \nand the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The government (through the Department of Budget \nof the MOFR) has coordinated this process within government and with development partners.14 \nOther external creditors are expected to discuss arrears resolution with Myanmar. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n17.  The impact will be improved inclusive growth. This will be measured by increased share \nof  wage  employment  in  total  urban  and  rural  employment  and  increased  real  per  capita \nconsumption of the poorest 30.0% households. The outcome will be to provide the foundation \nfor improved policy frameworks in selected areas and sectors that support inclusive growth, \nsuch  as  macroeconomic  policy,  public  finance,  trade,  investment  and  financial  sector \ndevelopment, agriculture, and education.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n18.  The PBL supports the government\u2018s efforts to provide the foundation for a more inclusive \neconomy  through  four  outputs:  (i)  macroeconomic  stability,  fiscal  sustainability,  and \nstrengthening public finance; (ii) increasing investment, trade, and financial integration; (iii) \nstimulating  rural  development  for  inclusive  growth;  and  (iv)  promoting  human  capital \ndevelopment for inclusive growth. All 22 policy measures (11 policy triggers and 11 policy \nmilestones) required for the PBL have been fully accomplished. \n \n1.  Output 1: Macroeconomic Stability, Fiscal Sustainability, and Strengthening \nPublic Finance \n \n19.  The PBL supports the government in initiating a series of major reforms to promote \nmacroeconomic  stability,  transparency,  and  integrity  in  tax  policy  and  administration,  and \ntransparency in the budget planning process.  \n \n20.  Macroeconomic policy reforms. The government initiated a series of major monetary \nreforms aimed at stabilizing the macro economy with a view to achieving low and stable rates of \ninflation and encouraging employment-generating investment. Its focus has been to initiate \nsteps  toward  a  managed  floating  exchange  rate  policy  and  a  reserve  money  targeting \nframework, with the aim of providing a nominal anchor for macroeconomic stability. Key reforms \nundertaken to establish the exchange rate policy included: (i) abolished the pegged kyat\u2013special \ndrawing right (SDR) exchange rate;15 (ii) established a retail market for foreign exchange; and \n                                                \n13 TA  8113-MYA:  Support  for  Trade  Policy  Development,  TA  8114-MYA:  Capacity  Development  Support  for \nImproving the Business Climate, and TA 8156-MYA: Improving Fiscal Revenue Mobilization.  \n14 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 For 35 years the kyat was officially pegged MK6.4 = $1 whereas the parallel market exchange rate fluctuated \naround MK800\u2013MK900 = $1 in early 2012. \n ", "6 \n(iii) established foreign currency auctions to set the reference rate for the kyat\u2013dollar rate, which \nis published on the CBM website. To support the managed float the CBM will need to implement \neffective monetary tools to manage kyat liquidity in the domestic market and sterilize capital \ninflows. Toward achieving this objective, the CBM has developed a  basic monetary policy \nframework of targeting reserve money. The monetary tool is a CBM auction for interest-earning \ndeposit accounts. The CBM issued a regulation setting up deposit auctions in June 2012 and \nimplemented its first interest-earning deposit auction in September 2012. While establishment of \nthe managed float is a significant goal toward a unified exchange rate system, the lifting of \nremaining exchange rate restrictions is necessary for full unification of the exchange rate. This \nwill require the phasing out of foreign exchange certificates, which are currently not guaranteed \nunder the new exchange rate management law enacted in 2012 (this law provides the CBM with \npowers to regulate, manage, and develop the foreign exchange markets). Thus, under the P3F, \nthe CBM intends to lift remaining foreign currency exchange restrictions, especially phasing out \nof foreign exchange certificates. It will continue to refine the basic monetary policy framework.  \n \n21.  Second, the government drafted amendments to the Central Bank Law that provides the \nCBM with significantly more operational autonomy with corresponding accountability and  a \nmandate  to  conduct  open  market  operations.  The  draft  is  expected  to  be  submitted  to \nParliament in January 2013. A limitation on its autonomy is that the draft law does not prevent \ncentral bank financing of the union budget deficit, although parliamentary approval will now be \nnecessary before the CBM can finance the deficit. Despite this limitation, once enacted the new \nCentral Bank Law will be a major step toward strengthening the governance structure of the \nCBM and providing it with powers to implement monetary policy necessary for macroeconomic \nstability.  \n \n22.  Third, in July 2012 the government approved a new organizational structure of the CBM \nto support implementation of its expanded and strengthened mandates provided for by the \nproposed amendments to the Central Bank Law. The new organizational structure provides for \noversight of the CBM by a board of directors which will include significant representation of \nindependent directors. There will be a monetary policy committee mandated to make decisions \non the CBM's monetary policy stance. Under the P3F, the CBM will complete implementation of \nits new organizational structure and make progress in implementing mandates under the new \nCentral Bank Law.  \n \n23.  Strengthening  tax  policy  and  administration.  The  government  has  made  some \nimportant steps toward simplifying tax structures to ensure broader tax bases and more stable \ntax revenues. The government: (i) abolished and replaced gross profit tax with net profit tax, \nwhich is standard taxation practice; (ii) increased taxable income thresholds for salary earners; \nand  (iii)  abolished  differential  corporate  tax  rates  on  foreign  exchange  earnings.  The \ngovernment also simplified commercial tax on goods and services by reducing the number of \ndifferent  tax  rates  applied  as  well  as  expanding  the  number  of  services  subject  to  the \ncommercial tax. The government has also initiated steps for better transparency by publishing \non the MOFR website the English and Myanmar language versions of the corporate income tax \nlaw  and  the  commercial  tax  law.  This  has  been  supplemented  by  government  education \noutreach activities to taxpayers explaining the tax laws. Under the P3F, the government intends \nto establish a high-level tax administration reform steering committee to oversee development of \na tax administration reform road map with technical support from development partners. \n \n24.  Improving public financial management. Until FY2012, government budget planning \nprocesses were limited. The budget was only approved by cabinet and was rarely published in \nthe national media. The official administrative exchange rate of MK6.4 = $1 was used to value \nforeign currency revenues, which produced highly inaccurate budget estimates. In 2012 the \n ", "7 \ngovernment implemented several measures to promote budget transparency. These measures \nincluded: (i) applied the market exchange rate to foreign currency revenues and expenditures in \nthe union budget; (ii) submitted the union budget to Parliament for approval for the first time; \nand (iii) resumed publication of the union budget law in the media. Another major transparency \nreform was improving the structure of the union budget by preparing separate union and state \nand regional budgets for the first time in FY2012.  \n \n25.  Improving transparency and PFM systems will be a long-term effort. In the short term \nand under the P3F, the government will complete a comprehensive review of the PFM system \nand develop and start implementing a reform action plan covering budget process, budget \nexecution and internal control, accounting, and reporting. The government will enhance public \ndebt  management,  starting  with  strengthening  the  institutional  arrangements  for  debt \nmanagement, in particular establishing the \u2015back office\u2016 necessary for accounting, recording \nand reporting MOFR public debt with ADB technical assistance. Over the medium term, the \ngovernment will include a complete financing plan for the Union budget in its submission to \nParliament. \n \n2.  Output 2: Improving Investment, Trade, and Financial Integration \n \n26.  The PBL supports the government in creating an enabling environment for private sector \ndevelopment, including SME development through a better investment climate, trade policy \nreforms, and finance sector development. \n \n27.  Creating an enabling environment for private sector and small and medium-sized \nenterprise  development. The government initiated a series of reforms to improve private \nsector development. As a first step, it drafted amendments to the foreign investment law to \nincorporate investor protection and streamline approval procedures. The draft was re-submitted \nto parliament in October 2012 for improvement. The government also initiated steps to reduce \nthe regulatory cost of starting and operating a business. These included: (i) Directorate of \nInvestment and Companies Administration (DICA) established a companies registration office in \nYangon (in addition to Nay Pyi Taw); (ii) extended the registration renewal period from 2 years \nto 3 years; and (iii) with ADB technical assistance, initiated development of a road map to \nupgrade company registrations and to expand registration offices in other major urban centers \n(i.e., Mandalay). Finally, the government established an institutional and policy framework for \nSME development through the following main measures: (i) established the SME Center at the \nMinistry of Industry (MOI) to coordinate and develop policy and strategies; (ii) drafted an SME \npolicy that includes SME access to credit, technology adoption, and capacity development; and \n(iii) carried out capacity development with SMEs through workshops and seminars. Under the \nP3F, the DICA will upgrade the company registration system and start a national rollout. The \nSME Center will develop and have endorsed an SME development road map. The government \nhas also drafted a finance sector road map for development of the sector. \n \n28.  Increasing trade integration. The government initiated a series of reforms to liberalize \ntrade with the aim of raising productivity and boosting exports of goods. First, to start the \nreintegration process, the government requested a trade policy review by the World Trade \nOrganization and initiated preparations for the review. Second, in an effort to simplify import \nprocedures, the government introduced automatic licensing for a selection of commodities; 3-\nmonth import and export licenses will be provided automatically for these goods. This pilot \nscheme  reflects  the  government\u2018s  cautious  approach  to  liberalizing  trade  to  ensure \nmacroeconomic stability. Third, the government has removed or reduced barriers to trade or \nimport  of  several  major  agricultural  commodities  and  other  products,  such  as  imports  of \nprepared canned foods, confectionary, fruits, and vehicles. Finally, the government enacted the \n ", "8 \nnew Export and Import Law, which provides the MOC with the mandate to produce trade policy \nand  regulations.  In  addition  to  these  reforms  the  government  also  abandoned  its  foreign \ncurrency rationing scheme under the \u2017export first\u2018 policy. Under the P3F, the government plans \nto complete the trade policy review process, develop a trade sector development strategy, and \nissue trade regulations and rules under the new Export and Import Law. This will include \nregulations on automatic and non-automatic import and export licensing. ADB is providing \ntechnical assistance to support these reforms (footnote 13). \n \n3.  Output 3: Stimulating Rural Development for Inclusive Growth \n \n29.  The PBL supports the government in addressing policy disincentives and constraints on \naccess to technologies and credit faced by farmers with the view to boosting farm productivity \nand incomes. First, the government abolished the commercial tax on exports of agricultural \ncommodities. Second, the government enacted the Microfinance Business Law that provides for \nentry of microfinance institutions into the domestic market and establishment of the Myanmar \nMicrofinance  Supervisory  Enterprise  at  the  MOFR.  Finally,  the  CBM  issued  a  series  of \nnotifications expanding the number of crops and other commodities that can be pledged as loan \ncollateral, thereby improving access to credit of both SMEs and farmers. Under the P3F, the \ngovernment will draft an agriculture sector development strategy. The government will also \ndevelop a financial inclusion strategy to improve the access of poor people to finance.  \n \n4.  Output 4: Promoting Human Capital Development for Inclusive Growth  \n \n30.  The PBL supports the government in addressing gaps in education access, quality and \nrelevance, and management, which particularly undermine educational outcomes for the rural \npoor. The reforms focus on improving planning and resource allocation in the education sector, \nas well as promoting greater private sector participation. \n \n31.  Education sector policy development. The government has launched a process for \nassessing  challenges  and  strengthening  policies  for  education  to  advance  human  capital \ndevelopment  as  a  cornerstone  for  inclusive  growth.  First,  the  government  initiated  the \nComprehensive Education Sector Review (CESR), a government-led review of the education \nsector  involving  collaboration  with  major  development  partners  including  ADB.  The  main \nfeatures of the CESR are: (i) identifying gaps and policy priorities for access, quality and \nrelevance,  and  sector  management;  and  (ii)  mainstreaming  analysis  across  gender, \nsocioeconomic, and geographic dimensions. The review will also include measures to improve \nPFM in the sector for more transparent and efficient delivery of public education services. The \nCESR  will  be  a  2-year  review  process  with  completion  expected  in  2014.  Second,  the \ngovernment  enacted  a  policy  for  universal  provision  of  free  textbooks  to  students  in \ngovernment-recognized primary schools with budget allocated starting in FY2012. Reflected in \nthe P3F, the Ministry of Education (MOE) will complete a review of the policy options and \npriority investments for secondary education, technical and vocational education and training, \nand higher education, with a focus on tightening links with the labor market and integrating \ngender issues. \n \n32.  Enhancing planning and funding for the education sector. The government has \ntaken steps to expand and more effectively utilize public and private resource mobilization for \neducation. First, the government more than doubled the share of the education budget, from \n3.5% of total spending in the FY2011 union budget to 6.0% of total spending in the FY2012 \nbudget. Nearly 40% of the increased budget is allocated to addressing the deficiency in capital \nspending,  mainly  by  building  new  schools.  Second,  to  encourage  greater  private  sector \nparticipation in the sector, parliament approved the Private Schools Registration Law, as a basis \n ", "9 \nfor establishing and recognizing private schools at the primary and secondary level. Reflected in \nthe P3F, to complement the increased resources allocated to the sector, the MOE will develop a \ncosted education sector plan (CESP) drawing on the results of the CESR. The plan will provide \na unified framework for government and development partner investments and will be based on \nclearly identified and sequenced priorities.  \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n33.  To  support  reengagement,  the  government  has  requested  a  single-tranche  loan  of \nSDR372,138,000  ($575,500,000  equivalent)  from  ADB\u2018s  Special  Funds  resources  to  help \nsustain the reform agenda. The loan will have a 24-year term, including a grace period of 8 \nyears;  an  interest  rate of 1.0%  per  annum  during the grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The loan \nproceeds will be disbursed in accordance with the loan agreement and the provisions of ADB\u2018s \nSimplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans.16  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n34.  The PBL covers policy reform accomplishments from August 2011 to October 2012 with \nfinancial closing by March 2013. The P3F covers measures to be implemented from November \n2012 to December 2014. The MOFR will be the executing agency and will be responsible for the \noverall coordination of the P3F and medium-term results framework. To oversee coordination, \nthe MOFR has set up a steering committee, which will meet semiannually. The implementing \nagencies\u2014the  CBM,  MOAI,  MOC,  MOE,  MOI  (SME  Center),  and  MPED  (DICA)\u2014will  be \nresponsible for implementing the measures. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Governance \n35.  Improved governance and anticorruption efforts have emerged as core priorities of the \ngovernment.  The  government  has  just  completed  its  first  public  expenditure  and  financial \naccountability (PEFA), led by the World Bank, and a PFM assessment led by the IMF. The \nresults of these two assessments will be the basis for discussion with authorities on designing \nlonger-term PFM reforms. ADB staff participated in the PEFA mission and closely coordinated \nwith the IMF. The government is also considering initiating steps to join the Extractive Industries \nTransparency  Initiative,  with  the  gas  sector  included  in  the  initiative,  which  will  support \ntransparency  in fiscal revenues  collected from  the gas  sector.  ADB\u2018s  Anticorruption  Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government. \n \nB.  Poverty and Social \n36.  The impact of reforms will be improved inclusive growth. The reforms under the PBL are \nthe initial steps toward a more comprehensive agenda to promote inclusive growth and lower \nthe incidence of poverty through six channels: (i) maintaining macroeconomic stability for a low-\ninflation environment; (ii) improving public financial management for better service delivery to \nthe poor, (iii) increasing investment and SME development leading to higher urban and rural \nwage employment; (iv) lower prices from trade reforms benefiting poorer families; (v) increased \nfarm incomes from improved incentives to produce and  better access to finance; and (vi) \ninvestments in human capital of the poor to ensure they benefit from economic growth in the \nlonger term. The government\u2018s reforms to promote inclusive growth do entail policy costs to the \ngovernment. These include the government budgetary funding to the education sector (the \nbudget allocation to the education sector increased by MK411 billion in the FY2012 union \n                                                \n16 ADB. 1998.

Manila.  \n ", "10 \nbudget)  and  estimated  foregone  tax  revenue  collections  exceeding  $30  million  from  trade \nreforms, among others (footnote 6).  \n \nC.  Safeguards \n37.  The  PBL  does  not  trigger  the  safeguard  policies  and  is  categorized  C  for  the \nenvironment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples.  \n \nD.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n38.  Myanmar is undergoing a major transformation and there are four main risks to the \nreforms: (i) the government\u2018s administrative capacity to implement reforms and resources may \nbe stretched, thereby limiting implementation of reforms; (ii) external financial and economic \nshocks may undermine macroeconomic stability, especially as reforms to the macroeconomic \nframework are still in their infancy; (iii) vested interests may resist trade and investment reforms; \nand (iv) natural disasters present a risk, and their adverse impact on agriculture production \nwould reduce real farm household incomes. Measures to mitigate these risks have been or will \nbe put in place through the PBL, P3F and other development partner initiatives include the \nfollowing. First, all policy measures have been accomplished prior to October 2012. Second, the \nP3F  signals  government  plans  to  advance  reforms  in  these  critical  areas,  and  significant \ntechnical  assistance  will  be  provided  by  development  partners  to  support  the  government \nadvance  reforms.  Third,  the  government  and  development  partners  are  jointly  monitoring \nmacroeconomic conditions and the proposed IMF staff monitoring program with the government \nwill also help mitigate these risks.   \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITION \n \n39.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the PBL shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the loan \nagreement.  \n \n40.  The loan will not become effective until the government's arrears to ADB has been fully \nrepaid. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n41.  I am satisfied that the proposed policy-based loan would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve:  \n \n(i)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR372,138,000 to the Republic of \nthe  Union  of  Myanmar for the  Support  for  Myanmar\u2018s  Reforms for  Inclusive \nGrowth, from ADB\u2018s Special Funds resources, with an interest charge at the rate \nof 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; for a \nterm of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft \nfinancing agreement presented to the Board; and \n(ii)  a waiver of ADB's policy17 that no loans to a borrower with arrears to ADB should \nbe proposed to the Board. \n \n                  Haruhiko Kuroda \n                  President \n6 December 2012 \n                                                \n17 ADB. 1993.
