Reform priorities also include efforts to provide the foundation \nfor promoting inclusive growth through human capital development and initiating market-based \nincentives for stimulating rural development. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe government has made reengagement with the global community a central tenet of \nits  reform  program.  This  reengagement  has  come  about  in  the  context  of  economic  reforms \nprecipitated  by  historic  political  reforms,  including  steps  toward  more  democratic  political \ninstitutions. Initiating a framework for a more permanent peace in sub-national conflict regions is \nalso  central  to  the  government\u2018s  political  and  economic  reforms. 2  These  twin  reforms  are \ninterdependent  and  together  are  signaling  to  the  international  community  the  government\u2018s \ncommitment  to  implement  real  change  so  as  to  reintegrate  the  economy  with  global  markets \nand thereby restore sustainable and inclusive economic growth. \n \n4. \nThe  government\u2018s  economic  agenda  is  large,  complex,  and  long  term.  While  the \ngovernment has done much to lay the building blocks for a market economy, much more needs \nto  be  done  in  the  areas  of  macroeconomic  policy,  trade,  investment,  and  small  and  medium-\nsized  enterprise  (SME) development  to  complete this  transition.  Stimulating  rural  development \nand  human  capital  development  for  the  poor  are  vital  for  ensuring  growth  is  inclusive. \nStrengthening  PFM  systems  is  also  central  to  ensuring  transparent  and  efficient  delivery  of \npublic  services  for  inclusive  growth.  The  government  recognizes  these  challenges  and  has \nrecently announced these areas as key priorities of the draft national development plan 2011\u2013\n2015 that has been submitted to parliament.3 The government also recognizes that the reform \npath will not be easy; there will be many complex challenges along the way, including balancing \ndifferent  stakeholder  interests  and  resolving  sub-national  conflicts  and  management  of  these \nchallenges will depend on how the reforms are prioritized, sequenced, and paced over time.  \n \n5. \nEconomic  growth  and  poverty  incidence.  Myanmar\u2018s  disengagement  with  global \nmarkets since the late 1980s has meant that the economy has not benefited from globalization \nin  terms  of  increased  trade,  investment,  technology  transfer,  and  acquisition  of  knowledge  of \ngood practices in a wide range of sectors, including public governance. This disengagement has \nresulted  in  institutions  being  unfamiliar  with  the  efficient  functions  of  a  market  economy, \nrelatively low economic growth and a relatively high incidence of poverty compared to regional \npeers. Thus, lifting investment growth will be critical for creating higher and sustainable growth.4  \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  For  an  overview  of  political  developments  in  Myanmar  see:  International  Crisis  Group.  2011.

Myanmar in Transition. Manila \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n6. \nDespite  progress,  poverty  remains  a  key  challenge.  According  to  results  from  the \nIntegrated  Household Living  Conditions  Survey  in  Myanmar:  Poverty  Profile (2009\u20132010),5 the \nnational  poverty  incidence  is  estimated  at  25.6%;  the  rate  is  higher  (29.2%)  in  rural  areas, \nwhere about 84.0% of the poor reside. Data also suggest significant regional income disparities \nwith  strikingly  high  rates  of  poverty  incidence  in  the  states  of  Chin  (73%),  Rakhine  (44%), \nTanintharyi  (33%),  Shan  (33%),  and  Ayeyarwardy  (32%).  Conflict  areas  are  characterized  by \nhigher  than  average  poverty  rates.  The  survey  shows  a  strong  correlation  between  the \nincidence  of  poverty  and  families\u2018  access  to  economic  opportunities  (such  as  wage \nemployment), economic resources (such as land and credit), infrastructure and basic services, \nand post-primary education.6  \n \nMacroeconomic  stability.  Maintaining  macroeconomic  stability\u2014low  price  inflation\u2014\n7. \nhas  been  a  major  challenge  for  Myanmar  authorities.  The  country  has  experienced  frequent \nepisodes of very high inflation from 1990 to 2005. High rates of food inflation in particular hurt \nthe urban poor the most as food accounts for more than 70% of their consumption and the poor \ndo  not  have  assets  to  hedge  against  inflation.  Central  bank  financing  of  the  fiscal  deficit  has \nbeen  the  primary  cause  of  Myanmar\u2018s  high  inflation  environment.  In  recent  years,  the \ngovernment  has  managed  to  lower  inflation  to  single-digit  figures  on  the  back  of  lower  money \nsupply growth from less deficit financing by the Central Bank of Myanmar (CBM). Nevertheless, \nMyanmar faces long-term risks to macroeconomic stability. These arise from fiscal risks related \nto:  (i)  increased  reliance  on  resource  revenues  in  the  Union  budget,  which  are  vulnerable  to \nvolatile  commodity  price  cycles;  and  (ii)  continued  partial  monetization  of  the  budget  deficit. \nAvailability of limited monetary policy levers to contain money supply growth and sterilize capital \ninflows also poses risks to maintaining macroeconomic stability.7  \n \n8. \nWeak investment climate. Insufficient investor protection, a cumbersome and complex \nlicensing  and  regulatory  environment,  and  dominance  of  state  economic  enterprises  in  key \nsectors of the economy have suppressed investments in Myanmar. The regulatory environment \nis complex, costly, and unpredictable. It can take up to 6 months for an investment license to be \napproved,  as  it  requires  cabinet  approval  and  up  to  two  months  to  get  the  first  companies \nregistration certificate. The finance sector is very shallow, dominated by the banking sector, and \nexcessively  regulated,  and  this  has  been  a  drag  on  investment  (footnote  7).  International \nfinancial sanctions also suppressed foreign direct investment and trade. These impediments are \nparticularly  burdensome on  SMEs,  which have limited  access to  credit, technology  and skilled \nworkers. \n \nLimited  trade  integration.  Myanmar\u2018s  trade  volume  with  the  rest  of  the  world  is \n9. \nrelatively  small.  Exports  are  concentrated  in  resources  (especially  gas),  minerals,  and  timber, \nwhich  together  account  for  58.0%  of  total  exports.  Labor-intensive  manufacturing  exports  and \nagriculture and marine exports are small, amounting to  $2 billion in 2010. Imports and exports \nare restricted through a complex non-automatic licensing system meaning that applications for \nlicenses to import and export goods are not approved automatically and need to be reviewed by \nthe  Ministry  of  Commerce  (MOC)  first.  Trade  was  also  restricted  by  the  foreign  currency \nrationing  scheme  under  the  government\u2018s  \u2017export  first\u2018  policy  whereby  importers  must  export \ngoods and services first before gaining access to foreign currency.

Improving  sanitary  and  phytosanitary  standards,  especially \nfood management systems, is critical to improving SME access to export markets and building \nconfidence in the recovering tourism industry.  \n \nRural  development.  The  majority  of  people  reside  in  rural  areas  and  obtain  their \n10. \nlivelihoods  from  agricultural  activities.  About  54.0%  of  poor  people  are  engaged  in  such \nactivities.  Thus,  stimulating  rural  development  will  be  an  important  part  of  the  government\u2018s \nlonger-term  poverty  reduction  strategy.  The  agriculture  sector  is  primarily  subsistence  farming \nwith low productivity levels, and it is vulnerable to natural disasters. There are also limited off-\nfarm  income  opportunities  in  rural  areas.  Several  key  constraints  on  rural  development  have \nbeen identified, including pervasive rural infrastructure deficits, restrictions on land usage rights, \npoorly  developed  support  services,  and  low  human  capital.  Farmers\u2018  limited  access  to  credit, \ninsurance,  and  financial  inclusion  is  a  major  constraint  on  productivity  increase,  crop \ndiversification,  and  risk  mitigation.  Previously  imposed  commercial  taxes  on  exports  of \nagricultural goods hurt farmers\u2018 incentives to produce.8  \n \nHuman  capital  development. Strengthening human capital will be critical to promoting \n11. \nlonger-term  economic  growth,  and  also  to  ensuring  that  the  poor  rural  populations  and  other \ndisadvantaged  groups  can  participate \nthe  growth  and  broader \nsocioeconomic  transitions  that  are  now  occurring.  Myanmar  has  significantly  underinvested  in \nthe  social  sectors,  e.g.,  public  spending  on  education  and  health  is  less  than  2%  of  GDP. \nMoreover,  private  sector  participation  in  the  education  sector  has  been  restricted.  While \nMyanmar has achieved important gains in expanding access to primary education, progress has \nlagged  in  post-primary  education.  According  to  the  Integrated  Household  Living  Conditions \nSurvey  in Myanmar:  Poverty  Profile  (2009\u20132010)  (footnote 5),  the national  net  enrollment  rate \nfor secondary schools was 52.5% in 2010, with huge regional disparities ranging from 32.7% in \nRakhine  to  73.8%  in  Yangon.  Post-primary  education  faces  three  major  gaps\u2014in  equitable \naccess, education quality and relevance (that undermines education outcomes), and education \nmanagement  (that  undermines  efficiency  in  the  sector)\u2014that  tend  to  disproportionately  affect \npoor populations and localities.9  \n \n12. \nGovernance.  Ensuring  improvements  in  PFM  for  better  public  service  delivery  and \ndevelopment  effectiveness  will  be  central  to  Myanmar\u2018s  development  challenges.  On  the \nrevenue  administration  side,  limited  tax  revenue  collection  has  resulted  in  suppressed  public \nspending,  especially  in  the  social  sectors  of  education  and  health.  Tax  revenue  collections \namount  to  about  4%  of  GDP,  among  the  lowest  in  the  region.  Revenue  management  is \nchallenged by: (i) limited sources of tax revenue; (ii) a complicated tax structure that encourages \ntax  avoidance;  (iii)  weak  tax  administration  resulting  in  a  small  taxpayer  base;  and  (iv)  lack  of \ntransparency in the collection and recording of income taxes collected from the resource sector.  \n \n13. \nOn the expenditure administration side, there is a need to ensure the public expenditure \nprogram  is  balanced  between  capital  spending  and  recurrent  expenditures.  This  will  require \ncontinued  reorientation  of  spending  toward  the  priority  sectors  of  education,  health,  and \nproductive  public  infrastructure.  Increased  public  spending  will  also  require  supporting \nmeasures to improve PFM systems. There are significant weaknesses in budget transparency, \nplanning,  and  execution;  public  procurement;  and  reporting  and  accounting.  These  undermine \ngovernment  effectiveness  in  responding  to  emerging  policy  priorities.  The  present  budgeting \npractice  is  input-based  incremental  and  largely  top  down,  with  little  regard  to  performance  or \n                                                \n8  Sector Assessment (Summary): Agriculture and Natural Resources (accessible from the list of linked documents in \n\n9  Sector Assessment (Summary): Post-Primary Education (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n2). \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nservice delivery. Capital and recurrent budgets are prepared separately. There are inadequate \ninternal control and audit systems. There is no strategic perspective in debt management and, \nwith  the  CBM  gaining  more  operational  autonomy  in  the  future,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and \nRevenue (MOFR) will need to assume more of the debt management functions from the CBM, \nstarting  with  \"back  office\"  functions  such  as  accounting,  recording,  and  reporting  on  MOFR \ndomestic and external debt. The government does recognize these weaknesses and intends to \nprepare  measures  for  strengthening  its  PFM.  For  the  first  time,  the  government  submitted  the \nFY2012 union budget to Parliament for review and approval, and resumed the publication of the \nunion budget in the national media after several years of not doing so. \n \n14. \nLessons  for  reengagement.  ADB\u2018s  reengagement  with  post-conflict  Cambodia  and \nViet Nam in the early 1990s provides important lessons for assisting Myanmar in its early reform \nperiod.  These  lessons  include  the  following:  (i)  policy  reforms  are  more  likely  to  achieve  their \noutcomes  and  have  impact  if  they  are  owned  by  the  country  and  are  an  integral  part  of  the \ncountry\u2018s  reform  agenda  within  an  agreed  performance  framework;  (ii)  programs  should focus \non  assisting  Myanmar  crystallize  its  reform  agenda,  including  prioritizing  reforms  and  defining \nthe sequence and pace of reforms; and (iii) introduction of good practice policy reforms adapted \nto  the  country\u2018s  situation  through  significant  levels  of  knowledge  support  through  technical \nassistance.  \n \nPolicy-based lending approach. The proposed PBL incorporates these lessons and is \n15. \ndesigned to support and sustain the government\u2018s reforms for inclusive growth. The PBL is also \naligned with ADB\u2018s interim country partnership strategy, 2012-2014, which has the medium-term \ngoal  of  assisting  the  government  in  promoting  inclusive  economic  development.10 The  PBL  is \ndesigned to reflect the unique features of Myanmar\u2018s reengagement with ADB in two respects. \nFirst,  Myanmar  has  debt  arrears  with  the  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  and  other  development \npartners. Separate third party bridge loans have been prepared to clear debt arrears with ADB \nand  the  World  Bank,  and  once  arrears  are  cleared  this  will  allow  ADB  full  resumption  of \noperations  with  Myanmar.  The  proposed  PBL  in  a  corresponding  amount  to  the  third  party \nbridge  loan  (and  a  longer  tenure)  will  help  the  government  repay  the  bridge  loan. 11  This \napproach  ensures  there  is  no  fiduciary  risk  to  use  of  the  PBL  loan  proceeds.  It  will  allow \nMyanmar  to  better  manage  its  limited  gross  international  reserves  of  about  4  months  import \ncover,  contribute  to  Myanmar\u2018s  improved  debt  sustainability  and  improve  Myanmar\u2018s  future \naccess  to  much  needed  external  development  financing. 12 Second,  the  proposed  PBL,  the \nGovernment of Japan\u2018s policy loan, and the World Bank development policy operation are jointly \ndesigned  to  help  sustain  the  government\u2018s  medium  term  reform  agenda.  As  expected  in  the \nearly  stages  of  reengagement,  the  government\u2018s  reform  agenda  is  still  developing  and  the \nbenefits  are  only  likely  to  show  up  in  the  medium  to  long  term.  Therefore,  policy \naccomplishments  under  the  PBL  will  be  advanced  by  a  post-program  partnership  framework \n(P3F) detailing planned activities aimed at sustaining future reforms for inclusive growth through \ngeneral  interventions  and  preparations  for  targeted  sector  interventions  such  as  in  education. \nTechnical assistance has been and will be provided by ADB and other development partners to \n\n                                                \n10 ADB. 2012. Country Partnership Strategy: Myanmar, 2012-2014. Manila \n11 A waiver of ADB\u2018s policy that no loans to a borrower with arrears to ADB is required to minimize the tenure of the \nbridge loan (para 41 (ii)). Also, the PBL loan will not become  effective until the government\u2018s arrears to ADB has \nbeen fully repaid (para 40). \n\n12 IMF  and  World  Bank.  2012.  Myanmar:  Staff  Report  for  the  2012  Staff  Monitored  Program  -  Debt  Sustainability \nAnalysis.  Washington (29 November).  Based on the results of the debt sustainability analysis, clearance of debt \narrears  with  ADB,  World  Bank  and  official  creditors  would  bring  Myanmar\u2018s  classification  to  low  risk  of  debt \ndistress.  \n\n\f5 \n\nsupport the government\u2018s medium-term reforms (Appendix 4). Three ADB small-scale technical \nassistance provided input to the formulation of the PBL, P3F and the medium-term framework.13  \n \n16. \nDevelopment  coordination.  The  strategic  focus  of  major  development  partners  is  to \nreengage with the government and stakeholders with the aim of resuming full operations in the \nnear  term.  The  initial  step  towards  full  resumption  of  operations  is  Myanmar\u2018s  resolution  of  its \ndebt arrears to multilateral financial institutions (MFIs) and official creditors. The ADB and World \nBank  have  worked  closely  with  the  government  to  resolve  Myanmar\u2018s  debt  arrears.  This \nincluded identifying the third-party bridge loan to clear debt arrears. ADB and World Bank have \nworked  closely  with  the  government  to  formulate  their  respective  policy  matrixes  and  planned \nactivities supporting a common reform agenda. The policy matrixes are similar in content. ADB \nand  the  World  Bank  have  also  closely  coordinated  operations  with  the  Government  of  Japan \nand the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The government (through the Department of Budget \nof the MOFR) has coordinated this process within government and with development partners.14 \nOther external creditors are expected to discuss arrears resolution with Myanmar. \n \nB. \n \n17. \nThe impact will be improved inclusive growth. This will be measured by increased share \nof  wage  employment  in  total  urban  and  rural  employment  and  increased  real  per  capita \nconsumption  of the  poorest 30.0%  households.  The  outcome  will  be  to provide  the foundation \nfor  improved  policy  frameworks  in  selected  areas  and  sectors  that  support  inclusive  growth, \nsuch  as  macroeconomic  policy,  public  finance,  trade,  investment  and  financial  sector \ndevelopment, agriculture, and education.  \n \nC. \n \nThe PBL supports the government\u2018s efforts to provide the foundation for a more inclusive \n18. \neconomy \nfiscal  sustainability,  and \nstrengthening  public  finance;  (ii)  increasing  investment,  trade,  and  financial  integration;  (iii) \nstimulating  rural  development  for \ninclusive  growth;  and  (iv)  promoting  human  capital \ndevelopment  for  inclusive  growth.  All  22  policy  measures  (11  policy  triggers  and  11  policy \nmilestones) required for the PBL have been fully accomplished. \n \n\nfour  outputs:  (i)  macroeconomic  stability, \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\nthrough \n\n1. \n\nOutput 1: Macroeconomic Stability, Fiscal Sustainability, and Strengthening \nPublic Finance \n\n \n19. \nThe  PBL  supports  the  government  in  initiating  a  series  of  major  reforms  to  promote \nmacroeconomic  stability,  transparency,  and  integrity  in  tax  policy  and  administration,  and \ntransparency in the budget planning process.  \n \n20.  Macroeconomic  policy  reforms. The government initiated a series of major monetary \nreforms aimed at stabilizing the macro economy with a view to achieving low and stable rates of \ninflation  and  encouraging  employment-generating  investment.  Its  focus  has  been  to  initiate \nsteps  toward  a  managed  floating  exchange  rate  policy  and  a  reserve  money  targeting \nframework, with the aim of providing a nominal anchor for macroeconomic stability. Key reforms \nundertaken to establish the exchange rate policy included: (i) abolished the pegged kyat\u2013special \ndrawing  right (SDR)  exchange rate;15 (ii)  established  a  retail  market for foreign exchange;  and \n                                                \n13 TA  8113-MYA:  Support  for  Trade  Policy  Development,  TA  8114-MYA:  Capacity  Development  Support  for \n\nImproving the Business Climate, and TA 8156-MYA: Improving Fiscal Revenue Mobilization.  \n\n14 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 For  35  years  the  kyat  was  officially  pegged  MK6.4  =  $1  whereas  the  parallel  market  exchange  rate  fluctuated \n\naround MK800\u2013MK900 = $1 in early 2012. \n\n \n\n\f(iii) established foreign currency auctions to set the reference rate for the kyat\u2013dollar rate, which \nis published on the CBM website. To support the managed float the CBM will need to implement \neffective  monetary  tools  to  manage  kyat  liquidity  in  the  domestic  market  and  sterilize  capital \ninflows.  Toward  achieving  this  objective,  the  CBM  has  developed  a  basic  monetary  policy \nframework of targeting reserve money. The monetary tool is a CBM auction for interest-earning \ndeposit  accounts.  The  CBM  issued  a regulation setting  up  deposit  auctions  in  June  2012  and \nimplemented its first interest-earning deposit auction in September 2012. While establishment of \nthe  managed  float  is  a  significant  goal  toward  a  unified  exchange  rate  system,  the  lifting  of \nremaining exchange rate restrictions is necessary for full unification of the exchange rate. This \nwill require the phasing out of foreign exchange certificates, which are currently not guaranteed \nunder the new exchange rate management law enacted in 2012 (this law provides the CBM with \npowers to regulate, manage, and develop the foreign exchange markets). Thus, under the P3F, \nthe CBM intends to lift remaining foreign currency exchange restrictions, especially phasing out \nof foreign exchange certificates. It will continue to refine the basic monetary policy framework.  \n \n21. \nSecond, the government drafted amendments to the Central Bank Law that provides the \nCBM  with  significantly  more  operational  autonomy  with  corresponding  accountability  and  a \nmandate  to  conduct  open  market  operations.  The  draft  is  expected  to  be  submitted  to \nParliament in January 2013. A limitation on its autonomy is that the draft law does not prevent \ncentral bank financing of the  union budget deficit, although parliamentary approval will now be \nnecessary before the CBM can finance the deficit. Despite this limitation, once enacted the new \nCentral  Bank  Law  will  be  a  major  step  toward  strengthening  the  governance  structure  of  the \nCBM and providing it with powers to implement monetary policy necessary for macroeconomic \nstability.  \n \n22. \nThird, in July 2012 the government approved a new organizational structure of the CBM \nto  support  implementation  of  its  expanded  and  strengthened  mandates  provided  for  by  the \nproposed amendments to the Central Bank Law. The new organizational structure provides for \noversight  of  the  CBM  by  a  board  of  directors  which  will  include  significant  representation  of \nindependent directors. There will be a monetary policy committee mandated to make decisions \non the CBM's monetary policy stance. Under the P3F, the CBM will complete implementation of \nits  new  organizational  structure  and make  progress  in  implementing  mandates  under  the  new \nCentral Bank Law.  \n \n23. \nStrengthening  tax  policy  and  administration.  The  government  has  made  some \nimportant steps toward simplifying tax structures to ensure broader tax bases and more stable \ntax  revenues.  The  government:  (i)  abolished  and  replaced  gross  profit  tax  with  net  profit  tax, \nwhich is standard taxation practice; (ii) increased taxable income thresholds for salary earners; \nand  (iii)  abolished  differential  corporate  tax  rates  on  foreign  exchange  earnings.  The \ngovernment  also  simplified  commercial  tax  on  goods  and  services  by  reducing  the  number  of \ndifferent  tax  rates  applied  as  well  as  expanding  the  number  of  services  subject  to  the \ncommercial tax. The government  has  also initiated  steps for better  transparency  by  publishing \non the MOFR website the English and Myanmar language versions of the corporate income tax \nlaw  and  the  commercial  tax  law.  This  has  been  supplemented  by  government  education \noutreach activities to taxpayers explaining the tax laws. Under the P3F, the government intends \nto establish a high-level tax administration reform steering committee to oversee development of \na tax administration reform road map with technical support from development partners. \n \n24. \nImproving  public  financial  management.  Until  FY2012, government  budget  planning \nprocesses were limited. The budget was only approved by cabinet and was rarely published in \nthe national media. The official administrative exchange rate of MK6.4 = $1 was used to value \nforeign  currency  revenues,  which  produced  highly  inaccurate  budget  estimates.  In  2012  the \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\ngovernment implemented several measures to promote budget transparency. These measures \nincluded: (i) applied the market exchange rate to foreign currency revenues and expenditures in \nthe  union  budget;  (ii)  submitted  the  union  budget  to  Parliament  for  approval  for  the  first  time; \nand (iii) resumed publication of the union budget law in the media. Another major transparency \nreform was improving the structure of the union budget by preparing separate union and state \nand regional budgets for the first time in FY2012.  \n \n25. \nImproving  transparency  and  PFM  systems  will  be  a  long-term  effort.  In  the  short  term \nand under the P3F, the government will complete a comprehensive review of the PFM system \nand  develop  and  start  implementing  a  reform  action  plan  covering  budget  process,  budget \nexecution  and internal  control,  accounting,  and reporting. The government  will  enhance  public \ndebt  management,  starting  with  strengthening \nfor  debt \nmanagement,  in  particular  establishing  the  \u2015back  office\u2016  necessary  for  accounting,  recording \nand  reporting  MOFR  public  debt  with  ADB  technical  assistance.  Over  the  medium  term,  the \ngovernment  will  include  a  complete  financing  plan  for  the  Union  budget  in  its  submission  to \nParliament. \n \n\ninstitutional  arrangements \n\nthe \n\n2. \n\nOutput 2: Improving Investment, Trade, and Financial Integration \n\n \n26. \nThe PBL supports the government in creating an enabling environment for private sector \ndevelopment,  including  SME  development  through  a  better  investment  climate,  trade  policy \nreforms, and finance sector development. \n \n27. \nCreating an enabling environment for private sector and small and medium-sized \nenterprise  development.  The  government  initiated  a  series  of  reforms  to  improve  private \nsector  development.  As  a  first  step,  it  drafted  amendments  to  the  foreign  investment  law  to \nincorporate investor protection and streamline approval procedures. The draft was re-submitted \nto parliament in October 2012 for improvement. The government also initiated steps to reduce \nthe  regulatory  cost  of  starting  and  operating  a  business.  These  included:  (i)  Directorate  of \nInvestment and Companies Administration (DICA) established a companies registration office in \nYangon (in addition to Nay Pyi Taw); (ii) extended the registration renewal period from 2 years \nto  3  years;  and  (iii)  with  ADB  technical  assistance,  initiated  development  of  a  road  map  to \nupgrade company registrations and to expand registration offices in other major urban centers \n(i.e.,  Mandalay).  Finally,  the  government  established  an  institutional  and  policy  framework  for \nSME development through the following main measures: (i) established the SME Center at the \nMinistry of Industry (MOI) to coordinate and develop policy and strategies; (ii) drafted an SME \npolicy that includes SME access to credit, technology adoption, and capacity development; and \n(iii)  carried  out  capacity  development  with  SMEs  through  workshops  and  seminars.  Under  the \nP3F,  the  DICA  will  upgrade  the  company  registration  system  and  start  a  national  rollout.  The \nSME Center will develop and have endorsed an SME development road map. The government \nhas also drafted a finance sector road map for development of the sector. \n \n28. \nIncreasing trade integration. The government initiated a series of reforms to liberalize \ntrade  with  the  aim  of  raising  productivity  and  boosting  exports  of  goods.  First,  to  start  the \nreintegration  process,  the  government  requested  a  trade  policy  review  by  the  World  Trade \nOrganization  and  initiated  preparations  for  the  review.  Second,  in  an  effort  to  simplify  import \nprocedures,  the  government  introduced  automatic  licensing  for  a  selection  of  commodities;  3-\nmonth  import  and  export  licenses  will  be  provided  automatically  for  these  goods.  This  pilot \nscheme  reflects \nto  ensure \nmacroeconomic  stability.  Third,  the  government  has  removed  or  reduced  barriers  to  trade  or \nimport  of  several  major  agricultural  commodities  and  other  products,  such  as  imports  of \nprepared canned foods, confectionary, fruits, and vehicles. Finally, the government enacted the \n\nthe  government\u2018s  cautious  approach \n\nliberalizing \n\ntrade \n\nto \n\n \n\n\fnew Export and Import Law, which provides the MOC with the mandate to produce trade policy \nand  regulations.  In  addition  to  these  reforms  the  government  also  abandoned  its  foreign \ncurrency rationing scheme under the \u2017export first\u2018 policy. Under the P3F, the government plans \nto complete the trade policy review process, develop a trade sector development strategy, and \nissue  trade  regulations  and  rules  under  the  new  Export  and  Import  Law.  This  will  include \nregulations  on  automatic  and  non-automatic  import  and  export  licensing.  ADB  is  providing \ntechnical assistance to support these reforms (footnote 13). \n \n\n3. \n\nOutput 3: Stimulating Rural Development for Inclusive Growth \n\n \n29. \nThe PBL supports the government in addressing policy disincentives and constraints on \naccess to technologies and credit faced by farmers with the view to boosting farm productivity \nand  incomes.  First,  the  government  abolished  the  commercial  tax  on  exports  of  agricultural \ncommodities. Second, the government enacted the Microfinance Business Law that provides for \nentry  of  microfinance  institutions  into  the  domestic  market  and  establishment  of  the  Myanmar \nMicrofinance  Supervisory  Enterprise  at  the  MOFR.  Finally,  the  CBM  issued  a  series  of \nnotifications expanding the number of crops and other commodities that can be pledged as loan \ncollateral,  thereby  improving  access  to  credit  of  both  SMEs  and  farmers.  Under  the  P3F,  the \ngovernment  will  draft  an  agriculture  sector  development  strategy.  The  government  will  also \ndevelop a financial inclusion strategy to improve the access of poor people to finance.  \n \n\n4. \n\nOutput 4: Promoting Human Capital Development for Inclusive Growth  \n\n \n30. \nThe PBL supports the government in addressing gaps in education access, quality and \nrelevance,  and  management,  which  particularly  undermine  educational  outcomes  for  the  rural \npoor. The reforms focus on improving planning and resource allocation in the education sector, \nas well as promoting greater private sector participation. \n \n31. \nEducation  sector  policy  development.  The  government  has  launched  a  process  for \nassessing  challenges  and  strengthening  policies  for  education  to  advance  human  capital \ndevelopment  as  a  cornerstone  for  inclusive  growth.  First,  the  government  initiated  the \nComprehensive  Education  Sector  Review  (CESR),  a  government-led  review  of  the  education \nsector  involving  collaboration  with  major  development  partners  including  ADB.  The  main \nfeatures  of  the  CESR  are:  (i)  identifying  gaps  and  policy  priorities  for  access,  quality  and \nrelevance,  and  sector  management;  and  (ii)  mainstreaming  analysis  across  gender, \nsocioeconomic, and geographic dimensions. The review will also include measures to improve \nPFM in the sector for more transparent and efficient delivery of public education services.  The \nCESR  will  be  a  2-year  review  process  with  completion  expected  in  2014.  Second,  the \ngovernment  enacted  a  policy  for  universal  provision  of  free  textbooks  to  students  in \ngovernment-recognized primary schools with budget allocated starting in FY2012. Reflected in \nthe  P3F,  the  Ministry  of  Education  (MOE)  will  complete  a  review  of  the  policy  options  and \npriority  investments  for  secondary  education,  technical  and  vocational  education  and  training, \nand  higher  education,  with  a  focus  on  tightening  links  with  the  labor  market  and  integrating \ngender issues. \n \nEnhancing  planning  and  funding  for  the  education  sector.  The  government  has \n32. \ntaken  steps  to  expand  and  more  effectively  utilize  public  and  private  resource mobilization  for \neducation.  First,  the  government  more  than  doubled  the  share  of  the  education  budget,  from \n3.5%  of  total  spending  in  the  FY2011  union  budget  to  6.0%  of  total  spending  in  the  FY2012 \nbudget. Nearly 40% of the increased budget is allocated to addressing the deficiency in capital \nspending,  mainly  by  building  new  schools.  Second,  to  encourage  greater  private  sector \nparticipation in the sector, parliament approved the Private Schools Registration Law, as a basis \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nfor establishing and recognizing private schools at the primary and secondary level. Reflected in \nthe P3F, to complement the increased resources allocated to the sector, the MOE will develop a \ncosted education sector plan (CESP) drawing on the results of the CESR. The plan will provide \na unified framework for government and development partner investments and will be based on \nclearly identified and sequenced priorities.  \n \nDevelopment Financing Needs \nD. \n33. \nTo  support  reengagement,  the  government  has  requested  a  single-tranche  loan  of \nSDR372,138,000  ($575,500,000  equivalent)  from  ADB\u2018s  Special  Funds  resources  to  help \nsustain  the  reform  agenda.  The  loan  will  have  a  24-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  8 \nyears;  an  interest  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The loan \nproceeds will be disbursed in accordance with the loan agreement and the provisions of ADB\u2018s \nSimplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans.16  \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nE. \nThe PBL covers policy reform accomplishments from August 2011 to October 2012 with \n34. \nfinancial closing by March 2013. The P3F covers measures to be implemented from November \n2012 to December 2014. The MOFR will be the executing agency and will be responsible for the \noverall  coordination  of the  P3F  and  medium-term  results framework.  To  oversee coordination, \nthe  MOFR  has  set  up  a  steering  committee,  which  will  meet  semiannually.  The  implementing \nagencies\u2014the  CBM,  MOAI,  MOC,  MOE,  MOI  (SME  Center),  and  MPED  (DICA)\u2014will  be \nresponsible for implementing the measures. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \nGovernance \nA. \n35. \nImproved  governance  and  anticorruption  efforts  have  emerged  as  core priorities  of  the \ngovernment.  The  government  has  just  completed  its  first  public  expenditure  and  financial \naccountability  (PEFA),  led  by  the  World  Bank,  and  a  PFM  assessment  led  by  the  IMF.  The \nresults of these two assessments will be the basis for discussion with authorities on designing \nlonger-term PFM reforms. ADB staff participated in the  PEFA mission and closely coordinated \nwith the IMF. The government is also considering initiating steps to join the Extractive Industries \nTransparency  Initiative,  with  the  gas  sector  included  in  the  initiative,  which  will  support \ntransparency  in  fiscal  revenues  collected  from  the  gas  sector.  ADB\u2018s  Anticorruption  Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government. \n \nPoverty and Social \nB. \n36. \nThe impact of reforms will be improved inclusive growth. The reforms under the PBL are \nthe  initial  steps  toward  a  more  comprehensive  agenda  to  promote  inclusive  growth  and  lower \nthe incidence of poverty through six channels: (i) maintaining macroeconomic stability for a low-\ninflation  environment;  (ii)  improving  public  financial  management  for  better  service  delivery  to \nthe  poor,  (iii)  increasing  investment  and  SME  development  leading  to  higher  urban  and  rural \nwage employment; (iv) lower prices from trade reforms benefiting poorer families; (v) increased \nfarm  incomes  from  improved  incentives  to  produce  and  better  access  to  finance;  and  (vi) \ninvestments  in  human  capital  of  the  poor  to  ensure  they  benefit  from  economic  growth  in  the \nlonger term. The government\u2018s reforms to promote inclusive growth do entail policy costs to the \ngovernment.  These  include  the  government  budgetary  funding  to  the  education  sector  (the \nbudget  allocation  to  the  education  sector  increased  by  MK411  billion  in  the  FY2012  union \n\n                                                \n16 ADB. 1998.

Manila.  \n\n \n\n\fbudget)  and  estimated  foregone  tax  revenue  collections  exceeding  $30  million  from  trade \nreforms, among others (footnote 6).  \n \nC. \n\nSafeguards \n\nThe  PBL  does  not  trigger  the  safeguard  policies  and  is  categorized  C  for  the \n\n37. \nenvironment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples.  \n \nD. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n38.  Myanmar  is  undergoing  a  major  transformation  and  there  are  four  main  risks  to  the \nreforms: (i) the government\u2018s administrative capacity to implement reforms and resources may \nbe  stretched,  thereby  limiting  implementation  of  reforms;  (ii)  external  financial  and  economic \nshocks  may  undermine  macroeconomic  stability,  especially  as  reforms  to  the  macroeconomic \nframework are still in their infancy; (iii) vested interests may resist trade and investment reforms; \nand  (iv)  natural  disasters  present  a  risk,  and  their  adverse  impact  on  agriculture  production \nwould reduce real farm household incomes. Measures to mitigate these risks have been or will \nbe  put  in  place  through  the  PBL,  P3F  and  other  development  partner  initiatives  include  the \nfollowing. First, all policy measures have been accomplished prior to October 2012. Second, the \nP3F  signals  government  plans  to  advance  reforms  in  these  critical  areas,  and  significant \ntechnical  assistance  will  be  provided  by  development  partners  to  support  the  government \nadvance  reforms.  Third,  the  government  and  development  partners  are  jointly  monitoring \nmacroeconomic conditions and the proposed IMF staff monitoring program with the government \nwill also help mitigate these risks.   \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITION \n\n \n39. \nThe  government  has  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  PBL  shall  conform  to  all \napplicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender,  procurement,  consulting services,  and  disbursement as  described in detail  in  the  loan \nagreement.  \n \n40. \nrepaid. \n \n\nThe loan will not become effective until the government's arrears to ADB has been fully \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  policy-based  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \n\n \n41. \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe  loan  in  various  currencies equivalent  to  SDR372,138,000 to  the  Republic  of \nthe  Union  of  Myanmar  for  the  Support  for  Myanmar\u2018s  Reforms  for  Inclusive \nGrowth, from ADB\u2018s Special Funds resources, with an interest charge at the rate \nof 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; for a \nterm of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and \nconditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft \nfinancing agreement presented to the Board; and \na waiver of ADB's policy17 that no loans to a borrower with arrears to ADB should \nbe proposed to the Board. \n \n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n6 December 2012 \n                                                \n17 ADB. 1993.
