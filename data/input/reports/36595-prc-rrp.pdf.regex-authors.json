An  environmental  impact  assessment  was \nAssessment  undertaken. The summary environmental impact assessment was \ncirculated to the Board of Directors of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) and uploaded on the ADB website on 16 November 2006. \n   \nProject Description  The Project is a key environmental improvement and management \ninitiative of the Hefei municipal government (HMG) to meet national \nenvironmental guidelines and ensure Hefei\u2019s sustainable growth. \nThe Project will bring tangible benefits to the environment of Hefei, \nthe capital of Anhui province, by (i) enhancing the quality of its \nwater  resources,  (ii)  strengthening  the  wastewater  treatment \nfacilities  and  sewer  networks,  (iii)  reducing  the  incidence  and \ndamage  of  flooding  in  three  rivers  and  Chao  Lake,  and  (iv) \nimproving the urban air quality and reducing road accidents and \nvehicular emissions through a more efficient city road network and \nintegrated  transport  management  operations  in  a  model \ndevelopment  zone.  The  Project  also  will  provide  institutional \ncapacity-building measures in urban environmental management \nand  policy  reforms  to  ensure  sustainability  of  the  Project  and \nrelated facilities.  \n \nThe  Project  has  three  components:  (i)  wastewater  and  waste \nmanagement, (ii) river rehabilitation and flood control improvement, \nand (iii) improved road infrastructure and traffic management in the \nXinzhan zone. The Project also provides for institutional capacity \nbuilding  for  project  management  and  operation.  The  Project \nsupports the Government\u2019s 11th Five-Year Program (2006\u20132010) \nto improve the living conditions and health in the cities of the PRC, \nand  to  promote  their  sustainable  economic  development.  It  is \nclassified as a targeted intervention because it will contribute to \nachieving Millennium Development Goal 7, Target 10, which calls \nfor halving the proportion of people without access to safe drinking \nwater and basic sanitation. The Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s \nwater policy and Urban Sector Strategy. \n   \nRationale  Improving the urban environment in Hefei is crucial to achieving \nand  sustaining  HMG\u2019s  medium-  to  long-term  development ", "ii   \nobjectives.  HMG  has  included  a  multisector  environmental \nprotection program in the city\u2019s 11th Five-Year Program. It also has \nidentified a list of priority projects for ADB financing, including the \nproposed  Project,  which  will  improve  wastewater  management, \nflood control, and traffic management in Hefei.  \n \nWater pollution and flooding are major environmental hazards in \nHefei. The Nanfei River cuts through the heart of the city, flowing \nfrom west to east before turning south to drain into Chao Lake, one \nof the five major freshwater lakes in the PRC. Three tributaries of \nthe Nanfei River, which flow through the northern sections of the \ncity, are heavily polluted with sewage and wastewater dumped into \nthe tributaries instead of being collected and sent to a wastewater \ntreatment  plant  (WWTP).  The  WWTPs  in  Hefei  lack  sufficient \ncapacity to handle all of the city\u2019s wastewater, and the sewage \nnetwork is also inadequate. The Nanfei River and its tributaries, as \nwell  as  the  northern  end  of  Chao  Lake  within  the  Hefei \nmunicipality, are prone to flooding, which affects the immediate \nurban area. In addition, the filled and closed solid waste landfill \nnearby seeps wastewater directly into the river and indirectly into \nthe groundwater. Adequate protection of this landfill and disposal \nof seeping wastewater in a WWTP are urgently required.  \n \nMajor traffic jams and flow problems in the city worsen air pollution \nand traffic accidents. To improve traffic flow and reduce vehicular \nemissions, HMG plans to construct expressways and flyovers, and \nupgrade traffic signal networks, using its own resources. It has \nrequested assistance from ADB to upgrade the road network and \ninstall a better traffic surveillance system and traffic management \nscheme as a pilot component of the proposed Project in Xinzhan, a \nhigh-growth industrial and residential zone. This area is adjacent to \nthe  main  stations  that  connect  Hefei  with  the  national  railway \nnetworks. The area will form a hub for transport services, including \nbuses,  logistic  centers,  and  freight  vehicle  operations.  A \nsustainable road safety strategy and vehicle emissions control plan \nwill  be  implemented  in  the  area,  while  the  new  roads  will  be \nprovided with full sewerage and environmental protection systems. \nXinzhan has been developed to complement increasing demand \nfor urbanization in Hefei. Industrial and manufacturing growth in \nthis area also would help reduce poverty in the city through the \nprovision of job opportunities. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  Impact: The Project aims to improve the urban environment, public \nhealth, and quality of life in Hefei by reducing the incidence of \nwaterborne  and  airborne  diseases,  road  accidents,  and  vehicle \nemissions;  and  by  increasing  employment,  and  investment  and \nbusiness opportunities.  \n \nOutcome:  The  Project  seeks  to  improve  public  wastewater \nmanagement, flood control, and transport services in Hefei. \n   ", "  iii\nProject Investment Plan   The Project is estimated to cost the equivalent of $372.36 million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $24.15 million.  \n   \nFinancing Plan   \nAmount \n  ($ million   \nSource  equivalent)  % of Total \nADB Loan  150.00  40.3 \nLocal Bank Loans  55.70  15.0 \nEnterprise Bonds  12.32  3.3 \nDistrict Government  71.40  19.2 \nHefei Municipal Government  82.94  22.2 \n  Total  372.36  100.0 \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nADB will provide a loan of $150 million to finance 40.3% of the \nproject cost, including financing charges during construction. The \nGovernment  will  finance  the  balance  through  a  combination  of \nHMG and district government budget sources, domestic loans from \nPRC banks, and enterprise bonds. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  ADB will provide a loan of $150 million from its ordinary capital \nresources under its London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years; an interest rate determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; an annual commitment charge \nof 0.35%; and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the \ndraft loan agreement. \n   \nAllocation and  The Government of the PRC will relend the loan proceeds to the \nRelending Terms  Anhui provincial government, which will onlend the loan proceeds \nto HMG, the Executing Agency, on the same terms and conditions \nas those of the ADB loan. The loan proceeds then will be onlent to \nthe implementing agencies (IAs) for the three physical components \n\u2014  Hefei  Urban  Construction  Investment  Company,  Hefei  Chao \nLake Ecological and Environmental Improvement Construction and \nAdministration Bureau, and Hefei Xincheng State Assets Operating \nCompany\u2014on the same terms and conditions as those of the ADB \nloan. The end-borrowers will assume the foreign exchange and \ninterest rate variation risks of the ADB loan. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 March 2013 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 September 2012 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  A project leading group will be responsible for project coordination, \nArrangements  and  will  provide  overall  policy  guidance  during  project \nimplementation. Headed by the vice mayor of HMG, the group will \ncomprise representatives from municipal commissions, bureaus, \nand agencies concerned. The project management office (PMO) \n ", "iv   \nfor the project preparatory technical assistance, led by the Hefei \nFinance  Bureau,  will continue  as the  PMO  for  the  Project  and \nsecretariat of the project leading group. It will be responsible for \ncoordinating  implementation  of  project  activities,  as  well  as \nimplementation of the capacity building component. The three IAs \nwill implement nine subcomponents. Hefei Urban Construction and \nInvestment Holding Company Limited will be responsible for seven \nsubcomponents,  while  Hefei  Chao  Lake  Ecological  and \nEnvironmental  Improvement  Construction  and  Administrative \nBureau  and  Hefei  Xincheng  State  Assets  Operating  Company \nLimited will be responsible for one subcomponent each. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Hefei Municipal Government \n   \nProcurement  Goods  and  works  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nProcurement Guidelines (2006, as amended from time to time). \nInternational competitive bidding, national competitive bidding, or \nshopping procedures will be used for procurement, based on the \ncircumstances of each contract package. \n   \nConsulting Services  About 31 person-months of international consulting services and \n108 person-months of national consulting services will be provided \nto  support  the  PMO  and  IAs  in  project  implementation,  and  in \nmanagement and institutional capacity building. The consultants \nwill cover (i) project management and construction supervision, (ii) \nset-up  of  management  information  system  and  project \nperformance  management  system,  (iii)  environmental \nmanagement, (iv) social development, (v) financial management, \n(vi)  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  project  assets,  and  (vii) \ninstitutional strengthening through human resources development \nand  training.  Consultants  will  be  recruited  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2006, as amended from \ntime to time). \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will benefit directly about 2.61 million people living in \nBeneficiaries  the project area, of which about 5.2% are poor (measured by the \nweighted average local urban poverty line of CNY2,760 per year or \nCNY230 ($29.11) per month, which is close to the $1 per day \npoverty line). All the residents of Hefei will benefit indirectly. The \nliving environment will improve as a result of (i) reduced pollution of \nHefei\u2019s surface water, with water quality improving to at least class \nV by 2012 with longer-term potential to be upgraded to class IV \nand class III; (ii) protection from flooding and elimination of hazards \ndue  to  poor  drainage;  (iii)  10%  reduction  in  the  incidence  of \nwaterborne  and  airborne  diseases  from  2005  levels,  with  a \ncorresponding decline in the number of sick days and expenses for \nmedical treatment; and (iv) increased traffic flow, better energy \nefficiency, and reduced waiting times as a result of an improved \nroad network and an innovative traffic management system, which \nwill  reduce  traffic  accidents,  enhance  productivity,  and  lower \nvehicular emissions.  ", "  v\nThe Project will provide 2,830 full-time jobs during construction, of \nwhich  about  60%  will  be  for  the  poor  and  women.  Project \noperations will create 1,080 permanent full-time jobs directly and \nanother  1,730  jobs  through  multiplier  effects,  generating \napproximately  CNY45  million  in  wages  per  year.  Public  health \nbenefits  will  accrue  through  a  reduction  in  the  incidence  of \nwaterborne  and  airborne  diseases,  savings  on  treatment  costs, \nand  improved  workforce  productivity.  The  Project  is  technically \nsound,  affordable  to  the  beneficiaries,  and  financially  and \neconomically viable and sustainable. Through policy dialogue, the \nProject will continue to support HMG in tariff reform to ensure cost \nrecovery, and in strengthening the capacities of wastewater utilities \nto become more attractive for eventual private sector participation. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The  Project  does  not  have  any  unusual  technical  risks. \nConventional engineering designs with proven records of reliable \nperformance will be adopted for wastewater management, landfill \nclosure, flood control, road construction, and traffic management \nand  associated  landscaping.  During  project  implementation,  the \nconsultants  will  support  the  PMO  and  IAs  to  ensure  delivered \nequipment and works comply with the design requirements and \nquality standards.  \n \nThe  following  risks  could  affect  timely  implementation  and \neconomic viability, and reduce the available benefits of the Project: \n(i) amendments and changes to the Hefei master plans, particularly \nfor the Xinzhan zone, which could delay the Project; (ii) lack of \nproper  operation  and  maintenance  of  project  facilities;  (iii) \nineffective organizational structures and inadequate capacity of the \nIAs, which could result in inefficient project development and delay \nimplementation; (iv) delay in the provision of counterpart funding; \n(v)  failure  of  HMG  to  increase  wastewater  tariffs  to  meet  cost \nrecovery  targets;  and  (vi)  unforeseen  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  issues,  which  could  constrain  the  efficient \nimplementation of the project works and restoration of livelihoods \nof affected persons. \n \nRisk (i) will be mitigated by synchronizing the project design and \nimplementation  schedules  with  other  projects  planned  in  Hefei. \nHMG also has provided specific assurances that are covenanted in \nthe Loan Agreement. Risks (ii) and (iii) will be mitigated through \nprovision of institutional capacity building for the IAs with support of \nloan  consultants.  Risks  (iv)  and  (v)  will  be  mitigated  through \ncovenanted assurances from HMG on the provision of counterpart \nfunding, and regular tariff reviews and increases. Risk (vi) will be \nmitigated by strengthening the internal monitoring and supervision \nby PMO and the IAs, and by engaging a qualified external agency \nto monitor and evaluate resettlement. \n ", "Map 1\n116o  00'E 119o  00'E\nANHUI HEFEI URBAN ENVIRONMENT IMPROVEMENT PROJECT\nIN THE\nPEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\nS H A N D O N G\nProvincial Capital\nCity/Town\nMain Road\nSecondary Road\nRailway\nRiver\n34 o 00'N Provincial Boundary 34 o 00'N\nHuaibei Boundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\nXuzhou\nH  E  N  A  N\nJ  I  A  N  G  S  U\nBengbu\nFuyang\nHuainan\nDingyuan\nA  N  H  U  I\nHEFEI\nFeixi Maanshan\nLiuan\nChao Xian\nShucheng\nChao Lake\nWuhu\nLujiang\nTongcheng (Yantze R.)

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People's Republic of China (PRC) for the Anhui Hefei Urban Environment Improvement Project \n(the Project). \n \n2.  The Government asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to help improve the urban \nenvironment  in  Hefei  city,  the  capital  of  Anhui  province,  by  strengthening  its  wastewater \nmanagement, enhancing the quality of its water resources by reducing pollution and damage from \nflooding, and improving urban air quality and traffic management. The Project is consistent with \nADB\u2019s Medium-Term Strategy (2006\u20132008), water policy, and Urban Sector Strategy.1 It will help \nthe PRC achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) for environmental sustainability and \nincreased access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation. This report is based on the results of \nthe  Loan  Appraisal  Mission,  as  well  as  discussions  with  the  central  and  local  governments, \nrelevant agencies, and community organizations. The design and monitoring framework of the \nProject is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n3.  Since the PRC initiated economic reforms in 1978, rapid urbanization has accompanied \nsignificant economic progress.  The urban population has nearly tripled from about 190 million in \n1980 to more than 560 million in 2005, and now accounts for more than 43% of the national \npopulation. The Government\u2019s Agenda for Economic Reform and Social Development aims to \naccelerate urbanization and the development of towns and cities, particularly in metropolitan areas.  \nConsequently, the urban population is expected to reach 47% of the total population by 2010, \nthereby  increasing  the  demand  for  urban  services.2   The  increasing    urban    population, \nindustrialization,  and  economic  development  are  straining  the  overloaded  infrastructure,  and \ncontributing to widespread pollution and environmental threats in PRC\u2019s cities. Without significant \ninvestment, the urban environment will degrade, economic development will be encumbered, and \npeople\u2019s quality of life will deteriorate. \n \n4.  Municipal wastewater is a major contributor to the pollution of PRC rivers and lakes. In \n2005, only about 48.4% of urban wastewater was treated, with the remainder discharged raw and \nuntreated into the rivers and lakes. In the seven major river basins,3 41.8% of the water does not \nmeet PRC\u2019s class III water quality standard and is unacceptable as a source of municipal water \nsupply.4 To reduce pollution in the country\u2019s lakes and rivers, a number of actions are needed, \nincluding (i) strengthening laws and regulations, (ii) adopting a holistic approach to water resources \nmanagement in river basins, (iii) reducing nonpoint sources of pollution, (iv) continuing investment \nin the construction of wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), and (v) continuing institutional and \nfinancial management reforms to facilitate more balanced economic growth and environmental \nsustainability.  \n \n5.  In  PRC\u2019s  11th  Five-Year  Program  (FYP)  covering  2006\u20132010,  the  Government  has \nprioritized addressing environmental issues, including water and air pollution, through policy reform, \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006.

Class I water is \npristine, while class V water is polluted. Class III is the minimum water quality required for municipal water supply. ", "2 \nincreased investment, and improved urban infrastructure management. Recognizing that adequate \nenvironmental protection and pollution controls are essential for sustainable economic growth, the \nGovernment has made environmental protection a national priority in its development strategy. In \naddition to environmental protection laws and implementing regulations that emphasize prevention, \nthe \u201dpolluter pays\u201d principle, and decentralized environmental management, the Government has \nundertaken  many  programs,  including  several  for  wastewater  management.5 Industries  were \nordered to treat wastewater to national discharge standards by the end of 2000. Municipalities \nhave been required under successive FYPs to address wastewater collection, treatment, and \ndisposal. Pollution control plans have been developed and implementation started for the key river \nbasins. Government policies require urban environmental pollution and ecological damage to be \ncontrolled by 2010. Under recent state guidelines, major cities, including provincial capitals, are \nexpected to have wastewater treatment rates of at least 80% by that year.6  Furthermore, the \nGovernment's economic and enterprise reform programs require that all wastewater projects be \nfinancially  sustainable  and  capable  of  cost  recovery.  The  State  Environmental  Protection \nAdministration requires all new WWTPs to provide at least secondary wastewater treatment. The \nmandated treatment level depends on the quality of the receiving water.  \n \n6.  Improving road infrastructure, traffic management, and vehicular emission controls are key \nareas  of  the  Government\u2019s  policy  to  ensure  sustainable  development,  while  protecting  the \nenvironment.  By  the  end  of  2005,  more  than  1.9  million  kilometers  (km)  of  roads  had  been \nconstructed in the PRC with a major focus on expressways.7 Vehicle ownership also has been \nincreasing rapidly, doubling in the past 10 years to almost 21 vehicles per 1,000 people. If trends \ncontinue, vehicle ownership will quadruple from 2005 levels by 2020. Such rapid growth in vehicle \nownership necessitates adequate transport planning, and improved road and traffic management. \nAlthough no specific urban road development plans exist at the state level, individual cities and \nmunicipalities must submit their master plans for urban development, including road infrastructure, \nto the State Council for approval. Local governments also are required to include road safety, traffic \nmanagement, and vehicular emission control schemes in their development plans.  \n \n7.  Hefei municipality, capital of Anhui province, is also the commercial and industrial center. \nWith a population of about 4.5 million, the municipality includes four urban districts and three \ncounties spread over 7,029 square kilometers.8 The topography of the area is dominated by rivers, \nstreams, and lakes. The Nanfei River, a tributary of the Yangtze River and Chao Lake system, \nflows southeast through Hefei to Chao Lake, one of the five major freshwater lakes in PRC. \nAlthough Hefei is hilly, the built-up areas are generally flat with elevations of 12\u201315 meters above \nsea level. Although this is above normal flood height, some low-lying areas along the Nanfei River \nand its tributaries are prone to flooding. Since 1949, the city has experienced 18 floods, four of \nwhich were disastrous.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n5  The PRC Law on Prevention and Control of Water Pollution was adopted in 1984 and amended in 1996. The law was \npassed to (i) prevent and control water pollution, (ii) protect and improve the environment, (iii) safeguard human health, \nand (iv) ensure the effective use of water resources. The law also (i) sets the standards for water environment quality \nand for the discharge of water pollutants; and (ii) covers the planning, supervision, and management of the prevention \nand control of water pollution. \n6  The national guidelines for the construction of municipal wastewater treatment facilities require all major cities to have \na wastewater treatment rate of 80% by 2010. National Development and Reform Commission, State Environmental \nProtection Administration, Ministry of Construction. 2005. Notice on Planning the Construction of Municipal Wastewater \nTreatment and Water Reuse Facilities Throughout the Country. PRC. \n7  Ministry  of  Communications  website  (http://www.moc.gov.cn/06jiaotonggk/):  The  length  of  express  highways \nconstructed in the previous 5 years (10th FYP) was more than in the 7th, 8th, and 9th FYPs combined. \n8  The population of the four urban districts is 1.75 million, excluding an estimated floating population or unregistered \npermanent residents of about 0.35 million. \n ", "3 \n8.  Hefei  has grown  rapidly  in  line  with  its  FYPs  and  the Hefei  Urban  Master  Plan.  The \npopulation is expected to increase to 6.3 million by 2010 and 8.0 million by 2020. However, the \nprovision of basic infrastructure and services has not kept pace with increasing demand. This has \nled to deterioration in the quality of life for urban residents, degradation of the urban environment, \nand  inefficient  economic  development.  Hefei  municipal  government  (HMG)  has  attempted  to \nrelieve pressure on the city\u2019s central commercial areas through further development aimed at \nmanufacturing  industries  and  high-tech  research  centers,  with  associated  residential \naccommodation. This urban expansion is expected to benefit areas (i) at risk of seasonal flooding, \n(ii) in need of basic infrastructure services to remove point sources of pollution and provide for \nfuture  wastewater  discharges,  and  (iii)  requiring  an  improved  road  network  and  better  traffic \nmanagement to reduce traffic congestion and vehicular emissions. Appendix 2 provides an urban \nsector analysis. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n9.  Project  Background.  The  management  of  wastewater,  water  resources,  and  traffic \nmanagement is the key to improving the urban environment by (i) reducing water pollution; (ii) \ndecreasing the occurrence of floods; (iii) reducing air pollution; (iv) promoting sustainable economic \ndevelopment; and (v) improving the living conditions and public health of urban residents, including \nthe poor. In the past, the Government was the sole provider of these urban services, which were \nfunded by tax revenues. Consumers paid minimal or no charges. Over the past decade, the \nGovernment has shifted towards a more market-orientated approach, enterprise provision in the \ndelivery of infrastructure services, and a more integrated approach to urban development and \nenvironmental management. Despite significant progress, more investment and improvement is \nneeded in wastewater, flood control, and traffic management systems. Socioeconomic surveys \nhave shown that the public is becoming increasingly concerned about and more attuned to the \nimpact of wastewater, flooding, and air pollution. Further, the public is increasingly willing to pay for \nthe necessary treatment and environmental improvement. While wastewater companies have been \nestablished in many cities, many are not financially or managerially independent. Tariffs generally \nhave not been increased enough to achieve full cost recovery. Therefore, corporate governance \nneeds  to  be  improved  and  key  personnel  trained,  and  the  enterprises  must  become  more \ncommercially orientated and stronger. \n \n10.  Since 2000, the economy of Hefei has grown at an annual average rate of 13.5%. The \ncombination of rapid economic growth, industrialization, and urbanization have led to major urban \nenvironmental issues in Hefei, including (i) acute shortages of wastewater facilities and sewer \npipelines; (ii) uncontrolled leaks and pollution from a closed landfill site; (iii) poor flood control \ndesign and planning, and inadequate flood protection measures; and (iv) poor traffic management \nand road quality.9 These problems, in turn, have caused poor water quality in the Nanfei River and \nits tributaries, as well as in Chao Lake. Further, they have increased flooding and air pollution, \nwhich have created health hazards, damaged assets (industries and roads), and contributed to a \ngeneral deterioration in the quality of life for residents of Hefei city. At the same time, Hefei is \nfacing the problems of sustaining employment and income-earning opportunities, and providing \nadequate health and education services to the growing population. Aware of the environmental \ndegradation, HMG has embarked on a multisector environmental protection program that will meet \nnational environmental guidelines and ensure Hefei's sustainable growth.10  HMG also needs \nassistance to achieve the MDG for environmental sustainability (Goal 7), which aims to halve the \nproportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015 \n(Target 10). \n \n                                                 \n9  A problem tree analysis workshop was conducted with all stakeholders to highlight the major environmental issues. \n10 Government policies require controlling urban environmental pollution and ecological damage.  \n ", "4 \n11.  Project Rationale. Improving the urban environment by reducing water and air pollution, \nand strengthening environmental protection and management in Hefei, is crucial to achieving and \nsustaining the municipality\u2019s medium-term development objectives. To this end, HMG has identified \na list of priority environment-related investment activities, including the proposed Project, which \nsupports the PRC\u2019s and Hefei\u2019s urban development and environmental management objectives. \nThe Project is also consistent with ADB\u2019s Water Policy and the recently adopted Water Financing \nProgram,  which  seek  to  improve  urban  water  investments  by  providing  investments  in  water \nsupply, sanitation and wastewater management, and environmental improvement.11 \n \n12.  Water pollution and flooding are major environmental hazards in Hefei. The Nanfei River \ncuts through the heart of the city, flowing from west to east before turning south to drain into Chao \nLake. Three tributaries of the Nanfei River, which flow through the northern sections of the city, are \nheavily polluted with sewage and wastewater discharged into the rivers instead of being collected \nand treated at WWTPs. The WWTPs lack sufficient capacity to handle all of the city\u2019s wastewater, \nand the sewage network is also inadequate. These tributaries are also prone to flooding (every 3\u20135 \nyears), although the Nanfei River floods much less frequently (reportedly every 20\u201350 years) \nbecause of flood protection infrastructure. The northern end of Chao Lake is prone to flooding, \nwhich affects the immediate urban area and backs up the Nanfei River and its tributaries. In \naddition, a filled and closed solid waste landfill nearby is seeping waste directly into the Nanfei \nRiver and indirectly into the groundwater. Adequate protection of this closed landfill and disposal of \nseepage in a WWTP are urgently required. Hence, the Project will bring significant environmental \nbenefits to Hefei by improving water pollution and flood management. \n \n13.  Major traffic jams and flow problems in Hefei worsen air pollution and increase traffic \naccidents.  To  improve  traffic  flow  and  reduce  vehicular  emissions,  HMG  plans  to  construct \nexpressways, flyovers, and improved traffic signal systems using its own resources. HMG has \nrequested assistance from ADB to upgrade the road network and install a pilot traffic management \nsystem in Xinzhan, a planned high-growth industrial and residential zone. This area is adjacent to \nstations on the railway network that connect Hefei with key commodities transfer points, which \nsupport the movement of goods and people, enhance transport services for low-income groups, \nand create an integrated and holistic transport system. Industrial and manufacturing growth in the \nXinzhan Zone would help reduce poverty in the city through the provision of job opportunities. The \nplanned ADB assistance in this zone is for the development of a pilot integrated road infrastructure \nand innovative traffic management system that could be replicated later throughout Hefei and \nelsewhere. HMG will provide the remaining infrastructure to the Xinzhan Zone, including electricity, \nwater supply, and sewer and gas transmission lines. \n \n14.  Policy  Dialogue.  The  Project  will  build  on  and  advance  policy  dialogue  with  the \nGovernment on (i) integrated urban development and environmental management, (ii) wastewater \nmanagement, (iii) upstream and basin-wide pollution prevention and control, (iv) improved flood \nmanagement and control, (v) sustainable urban transport management and road safety, (vi) vehicle \nemission control, (vii) cost recovery and tariff reforms, (viii) governance and anticorruption, and (ix) \nprivate sector participation (PSP). Details of the policy dialogue are in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n15.  HMG  has  endorsed  medium-  to  long-term  urban  development  master  plans  and \nenvironmental management programs, including measures to prevent and control air, water, and \n                                                 \n11 The Water Financing Program 2006\u20132010 aims to double investments in the Asia and Pacific region and achieve the \nfollowing results: (i) 200 million people with sustainable access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation, (ii) 100 \nmillion people with reduced risk of floods, (iii) 40 million people with more productive and efficient irrigation and \ndrainage services, (iv) integrated water resource management introduced in 25 river basins, and (v) improved water \ngovernance through national water reforms and capacity development. Targets (i), (ii), and (v) are relevant to the Hefei \nproject. \n ", "5 \nsolid waste pollution, which have significant impacts on urban development. These plans and \nprograms are formulated to ensure sustainable economic development without jeopardizing the \nenvironment  and  living  conditions  in  Hefei.  Support  for  an  integrated  approach  to  urban \ndevelopment and environmental management has been an important element of ADB\u2019s policy \ndialogue and operational activities. The focus for wastewater is the integrated management of \nindustrial and domestic wastewater, including on-site treatment and public sewer connections. \nADB  has  supported  the  Government\u2019s  wastewater  management  policies,  providing  loans \n(Appendix 3) for wastewater treatment components in more than 15 cities, including Hefei.   \n \n16.  Floods in rapidly growing cities damage urban property and have high recovery costs. The \nflood control system in the PRC emphasizes the use of structural measures to reduce flood \nhazards. These measures are essential to improving the security of those living and working in \nflood-prone  areas.  To  mitigate  flood  risks,  nonstructural  approaches  increasingly  are  used, \nincluding  data  acquisition,  flood  forecasting,  flood  warning,  and  response  procedures.  The \ndevelopment  of  flood  protection  measures  for  flood-affected  cities  is  a  local  government \nresponsibility. HMG has prepared the Nanfei River and Chao Lake flood management plan, which \nincludes a range of structural and nonstructural works that take into consideration the overall \nframework of river basin development and national policy on integrated flood management.  \n \n17.  Sustainable transport planning is central to implementing the Hefei Urban Master Plan. The \ndemand  for  road  space  in  Hefei  is  growing  more  rapidly  than  supply.  Traffic  congestion \nundermines productivity and economic growth, increases energy consumption, worsens air quality, \nand degrades the quality of life of urban residents. The lack of roads and traffic congestion \nincreasingly is making Hefei\u2019s suburban and new industrial areas difficult to access, and less \nattractive  to  employers  and  residents.  The  limited  road  space  and  inefficient  use  of  traffic \nmanagement are creating safety concerns for drivers, pedestrians, and non-motorized transport \nusers.12 A well-planned urban road network, combined with an efficient traffic management system \nthat includes vehicular emission controls, is necessary to ensure the sustainable development of \nHefei. It will reduce time lost due to traffic congestion, improve efficiency of energy consumption by \nvehicles, and reduce air pollution. In addition to road infrastructure, the Project has included a pilot \ntraffic management scheme covering traffic control, better user information, road safety and traffic \nenforcement, transport services, maintenance plan, and interagency coordination mechanism. This \nscheme is expected to be replicated in other parts of Hefei and other cities. \n \n18.  Policy dialogue on key reforms is a significant aspect of ADB\u2019s operations in the PRC in \nurban development, including water supply, sanitation, waste management, and urban transport. \nSignificant  progress  has  been  made  in  (i)  introducing  tariff  and  enterprise  reforms,  (ii) \nstrengthening  governance  and  management  of  utilities,  and  (iii)  promoting  PSP.  ADB  has \nsupported the tariff reform process through three technical assistance (TA) projects, which have \ncontributed significantly to water and wastewater tariff reforms and resources conservation.13 The \ntariff guidelines include tariff calculation methodologies that will allow full cost recovery, while \ntaking into consideration affordability and social constraints.  \n \n                                                 \n12 Insufficient roads and inefficient traffic management are the causes of poor road safety records in the PRC. These \nhave health, environmental, and social consequences; and significant implications for national economic growth \nstrategies. In recognition of this, the United Nations for the first time recently integrated road safety into its policies on \nsustainable development. The problem of road safety is acute in all PRC cities. Road safety also has been recognized \nfor its role in achieving the MDGs.  \n13 ADB. 1997. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Water Tariff Study.

The TA also recommended options for encouraging multichannel investment, including PSP \nin urban wastewater management. A good example of successful PSP is provided by a WWTP in \nHefei that was financed under an earlier ADB project. This WWTP became financially viable as a \nresult of tariff reforms supported under the ADB project, and subsequently was prioritized for \ninvestment by a Sino-German joint venture.14 In addition, ADB provided a TA to strengthen policy \nreform on the use of market-based instruments to enhance PSP in public utilities, mainly for water \nsupply and wastewater management. Further, ADB provided a TA to help the water utilities in \nNanjing develop sustainable access to the private long-term capital finance market.15 The Project \nwill continue to help HMG reform tariffs and strengthen the capacity of its wastewater utilities to \nbecome more attractive for eventual PSP. ADB also provided a TA for training on traffic safety, \nplanning, and management.16 \n \n20.  External Assistance. External assistance to HMG for developing and implementing its \nenvironmental infrastructure has come mainly from ADB, World Bank, Japan Bank for International \nCooperation, Denmark, and the Netherlands. Since 1992, ADB has provided 20 loans totaling $2.3 \nbillion to the PRC for urban development and environment projects (Appendix 3). ADB also has \nprovided about $42.0 million for more than 60 TA studies to prepare these projects, and to review \nand study key issues in water resources, urban water supply, wastewater treatment, pollution \ncontrol, and urban transport. \n \n21.  Lessons. In a performance evaluation of a previous wastewater project in Hefei city, ADB \nrated the project highly successful.17 Lessons from ADB\u2019s experience in urban development and \nenvironment projects were considered in policy dialogue with the Government, engineering design \nof the project facilities, and institutional capacity building programs. Lessons from previous projects \nin Hefei city and Anhui province also were considered. First, strategic master plans need to be \nconsistent  and  conform  with  key  urban  sector  issues.  The  Project  includes  several  sector \ncomponents  (wastewater,  flood  protection,  and  traffic  management).  ADB  has  engaged  in \nextensive policy dialogue with the Government to confirm that each project component is in line \nwith its respective master plan. These include the (i) overall Hefei city master plan, (ii) wastewater \nmanagement plan, (iii) river basin management and flood control master plan, and (iv) transport \nand traffic management plan. Second, cost recovery and tariff reform are important. The current \nwastewater tariff generates sufficient revenue to cover the operation and maintenance (O&M) cost \nof the wastewater operations in Hefei, provide the counterpart funding for the Project, and service \nthe ADB loan. During the policy dialogue, an agreement was reached to review the tariff during \nproject implementation, and increase it regularly to ensure cost recovery. Third, increased public \nawareness is one of the most effective ways to improve the urban environment. In view of this \nlesson, the Project provides for public awareness training on environmental health and protection. \nFourth, the establishment of an effective monitoring mechanism for resettlement implementation is \nimportant to ensure that land approval, compensation, and rehabilitation measures are coordinated \n                                                 \n14 Wangxiaoying WWTP Phase II was financed by ADB. 1996.

A recent review of the water supply, sanitation, and waste management sector in the PRC \nidentified successes and deficiencies, as well as lessons, from the portfolio performance.18  The \nmajor issues identified included delays in the start-up of projects and in procurement, and weak \ninstitutional arrangements for project implementation and sustainable operations. These issues \nwere reviewed in detail during project preparation, and the lessons were incorporated in the project \ndesign. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n23.  The impact of the Project is to improve the urban environment, public health, and quality of \nlife  in  Hefei  by  reducing  waterborne  and  airborne  diseases,  road  accidents,  and  vehicular \nemissions; and increasing employment, investment, and business opportunities. The outcome of \nthe Project will be improved public wastewater management, flood control, and transport services \nin Hefei by  \n \n(i)  increasing the wastewater treatment rate from 50% to 80% by 2012;  \n(ii)  upgrading the water quality from much worse than class V to at least class V in \nBanqiao, Ershibu, and Sili rivers by 2012, with longer-term potential for upgrading to \nbetween class IV and class V by 2015 and eventually to class III;  \n(iii)  reducing the probability of floods in the Banqiao, Ershibu, and Sili rivers from an \naverage of every 3\u20135 years to 50\u2013100 years by 2011\u20132012;  \n(iv)  reducing the probability of floods in Chao Lake from an average of every 10\u201320 \nyears  to  at  least  every  20  years,  and  reducing  erosion  of  the  lake  bank  and \nimproving the ecological environment of the lake by 2012; and  \n(v)  creating a sustainable road transport system that is safe, economically viable, and \nenvironmentally  friendly  in  the  Xinzhan  Zone  by  2012,  resulting  in  increased \nindustrial development, more jobs, and better health and safety.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n24.  The Project has three components and related capacity building, broken down into 10 \nsubcomponents (outputs) and 30 activities, which contribute to and fundamentally support Hefei\u2019s \n11th FYP and beyond. The subcomponents include improved wastewater management through \nthe construction of WWTPs and expansion of the sewer network; environmental improvement, and \neffective protection of a closed landfill; river rehabilitation and flood control works; improved road \ninfrastructure  and  traffic  management  in  the  Xinzhan  Zone,  with  an  innovative  pilot  traffic \nmanagement  and  control  system;  and  institutional  capacity  building  for  effective  and  efficient \nproject  implementation  and  management.  Supplementary  Appendixes  B,  C,  and  D  provide \ntechnical details of the physical components. \n \n25.  Wastewater  and  waste  management  of  Hefei  city  has  four  subcomponents.  The  first \nsubcomponent is the construction of the Shiwuli River WWTP with a capacity of 50,000 cubic \n                                                 \n18 ADB. 2005.

The second subcomponent is the \nconstruction of Wangtang Phase II WWTP with a treatment capacity of 100,000 m3/day, a recycled \nwater pump station with a capacity of 35,000 m3/day, and about 33.4 km of sewer network. The \nthird subcomponent is the construction of sewers for four WWTPs throughout Hefei city, which will \ninclude installation of 206 km of sewer network of varying diameters and construction of one \nsewage pumping station. The fourth subcomponent is improvement to the closed Qingxi Road \nLandfill site, including installation of (i) a capping system and surface water drainage system to \nprevent rainwater infiltration, (ii) a leachate collection and piping system to Wangtang WWTP, (iii) a \ngas collection and gas flare off system, (iv)  a vertical subsurface membrane  wall to prevent \ngroundwater intrusion and leakage of leachate into the Nanfei River, and (v) extensive landscaping \nand planting of an urban park. \n \n26.  River rehabilitation and flood control improvement in Hefei has four subcomponents. The \nfirst three subcomponents comprise rehabilitation and flood control improvement for the Banqiao, \nErshibu,  and  Sili  rivers.  Work  includes  river  dredging,  widening  and  reinforcement  of  banks, \nsediment disposal from dredging, and construction of storm water discharge pipelines. Storm water \npumping stations, sewer mains, and sewerage pump stations also will be constructed to enable \ntransfer  to  WWTPs.  Ancillary  works  include  construction  of  access  roads  and  bridges,  and \nnecessary  landscaping.  The  fourth  subcomponent  involves  improvement  to  Chao  Lake  flood \ncontrol works to enhance the ecological environment, strengthen water and soil conservation, and \nincrease flood control capacity. Work includes extension of up to 35.7 km of banks, construction of \n20.7  km  of  erosion  control  structures,  construction  of  a  56.3  km  wave  break  forest  belt, \nconstruction of wave breaks (walls), and road construction around the lake banks. \n \n27.  Improved road infrastructure and traffic management in the Xinzhan Zone focuses on \nimproving road infrastructure and traffic management in the Xinzhan Zone. Nine roads will be built, \nof  which  three  are  main  trunk  roads  and  six  are  secondary  trunk  roads.  Work  will  include \nconstruction of 26.4 km of roads and complete ancillary works, including necessary storm water \nnetwork associated with the construction; and completion and testing of a pilot traffic management, \nsurveillance, and control system to ensure sustainable, integrated, and safe operation after project \ncompletion.  \n \n28.  The Project also provides for institutional capacity building for project management to \nensure that the stakeholders are able to implement the Project effectively and manage the project \nfacilities. The capacity building will include project management consulting services and training \nduring loan implementation. This will help the implementing agencies (IAs) (i) become operationally \nefficient and financially sustainable entities; (ii) comply with relevant national policies for cost \nrecovery, tariff, and enterprise reforms of the wastewater sector; (iii) develop sound O&M plans for \nfuture service provision and commercial growth; (iv) develop a public awareness training program \non environmental protection and social impact monitoring; and (v) improve the efficiency of traffic \nmanagement in the Xinzhan zone. \n \nC.  Special Features \n29.  The Project is ADB\u2019s first multisector urban environment improvement project in the PRC \nthat aims to integrate urban development and environmental management to ensure long-term \nsustainable growth. It also will provide experience for future ADB-financed urban projects in the \nPRC.  The  Project  builds  on  and  advances  ADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  and  initiatives  with  the \nGovernment in several key areas, including (i) urban environment and wastewater management, \n(ii) cost recovery and tariff reform, (iii) corporate governance and enterprise reform, (iv) integrated \nurban infrastructure development and sustainable transport system, and (v) PSP.  \n \n ", "9 \n30.  The Project has been designed to support HMG in creating an enabling environment for \nPSP through tariff reform and improved corporate governance. ADB\u2019s experience in Hefei (para. \n19 and footnote 14) suggests that this is a successful approach to attracting PSP in the longer \nterm. The funding of part of the Project directly from wastewater tariffs is a major reform that is in \nline with ADB\u2019s water policy.  \n \n31.  The road and traffic management subcomponent will address traffic management directly, \nand  is  expected  to  help  to  minimize  air  pollution  generated  from  increased  traffic  volume \nassociated  with  urban  development.  The  Xinzhan  zone  will  be  used  as  a  pilot  area  for  this \nsubcomponent. If successful, it will be expanded across Hefei and potentially to other cities in the \nPRC. In addition to road construction, the subcomponent includes \n  \n(i)  a traffic management scheme focusing on signage and traffic signals that will be \nbuilt using a central control system to synchronize traffic light patterns, facilitate \ntraffic flow, and minimize slow and stop movement of vehicles, thereby improving \nefficiency of energy consumption and reducing vehicular emissions;19  \n(ii)  enhanced management of road safety to (a) reduce the frequency and severity of \nroad accidents; (b) benefit pedestrians, public bus users, and bicycle riders, who are \npredominantly from low-income groups; and (c) increase the economic benefits of \nthe infrastructure investment; and  \n(iii)  integration with other transport modes and logistics centers.20   \n \n32.  Rehabilitation of the closed Qingxi Road Landfill site is an innovative scheme to support \ncomprehensive waste and wastewater management to improve the environment. Improvements to \nthe landfill will eliminate contamination to surface and groundwater, and reduce obnoxious odor to \nsurrounding residents. As such, this initiative would have demonstration effect for other urban \nareas with improperly managed landfill sites. Consequently, these special features and initiatives \nwill bring added value to the Project. \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n33.  The Project is estimated to cost the equivalent of $372.36 million, including taxes and \nduties. Table 1 provides a summary of the project investment plan.

The Government has requested a loan of $150.0 million to finance 40.3% of the project \ncost. The ADB loan will cover civil works, equipment and supplies, project management consulting \nservices and training, and financial charges on the loan during construction. The Government will \nfinance  contingencies.  Counterpart  funding  will  be  provided  by  HMG  (wastewater  tariff,  city \nconstruction and maintenance tax, water resources development fund, and special fiscal funds), \nthe Hefei Urban Construction Investment and Holding Company (HUCIC) enterprise bond, and \ndomestic commercial bank loans. Xinzhan district government will provide counterpart funding for \nthe road component. HMG has provided commitment letters from the Government and domestic \nbanks for the counterpart funds. The financing plan for the Project is summarized in Table 2, with \ndetails provided in Appendix 4 and Supplementary Appendix E. ADB\u2019s loan will come from its \nordinary capital resources. The loan will carry an interest rate to be determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending rate system for US dollar loans, an \nannual commitment charge of 0.35%, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan and project agreement.21 The loan will have a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 \nyears. \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n21 Front-end fee will be waived for projects approved by the Board before the end of June 2007. \n ", "11 \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Total Costs  % \nA.

The Government has provided ADB with the reasons for (i) its decision to borrow under \nADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  on  the  basis  of  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an \nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. The Borrower is the PRC. The Government of the PRC will \nrelend the loan proceeds to the Anhui provincial government (APG), which will onlend the loan \nproceeds to HMG on the same terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan. The loan proceeds \nthen will be onlent to the IAs on the same terms and conditions, with each IA bearing the risks of \nforeign exchange and interest rate variation for their portion of the loan proceeds onlent thereto. It \nis also a requirement that the IAs perform all obligations under the Project Agreement to the extent \napplicable to them respectively which will be made an integral part of the onlending agreement. \nAppendix 5 shows the flow of funds and onlending arrangements. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n36.  HMG will be the Executing Agency for the Project. The project leading group (PLG) will be \nresponsible  for  project  coordination,  and  will  provide  policy  guidance  during  implementation. \nHeaded by the vice mayor, the PLG will comprise representatives of the Hefei Financial Bureau \n(HFB), Hefei Municipal Development and Planning Commission, Hefei Construction Commission, \nHefei Water Affairs Bureau, Xinzhan Management Commission, and HUCIC. \n \n37.  The  three  IAs  are  (i)  HUCIC,  (ii)  Hefei  Chao  Lake  Ecological  and  Environmental \nImprovement  Construction  and  Administrative  Bureau,  and  (iii)  Hefei  Xincheng  State  Assets \nOperating Co. Ltd. These organizations are fully state-owned. The seven subcomponents under \nHUCIC will be carried out through the following arrangements: (i) HUCIC will undertake one \nsubcomponent: Qingxi Road Landfill rehabilitation; (ii) the Hefei Municipal Drainage Office will \nundertake three subcomponents: Ershibu River, Banqiao River, and Sili River flood control; and (iii) \nthe  Hefei  Wastewater  Treatment  Administrative  Department  (HWTAD)  will  undertake  three \nsubcomponents: Shiwuli WWTP, Wangtang WWTP Phase II, and Hefei Sewerage Improvement.22 \nThe Hefei Chao Lake Ecological and Environmental Improvement Construction and Administrative \nBureau, a specifically established nonrevenue-earning government organization under Hefei Water \nAffairs Bureau, will undertake directly the Chao Lake subcomponent. Hefei Xincheng State Assets \nOperating Co. Ltd will implement the Xinzhan Zone component. Institutional capacity building will \nbe implemented through the project management office (PMO).  \n                                                 \n22 HWTAD and Hefei Municipal Drainage Office were designated by HMG to implement the wastewater and river \nrehabilitation and flood control subcomponents under HUCIC in accordance to HMG Notice 123 [2006], dated 23 \nNovember 2006. \n ", "12 \n38.  Established within HFB, the PMO will serve as the secretariat of the PLG and will be \nresponsible  for  coordinating  the  implementation  of  project  activities.  The  PMO  will  (i)  ensure \nadequate interdepartmental cooperation and interagency coordination, (ii) monitor the progress of \nproject implementation, and (iii) coordinate communication with ADB and agencies concerned. A \nproject  implementation  unit  will  be  established  within  each  subcomponent  IA,  and  will  be \nresponsible to the respective IA for coordinating detailed implementation activities. Appendix 6 \nprovides details of the overall project organization. Further details of the institutional arrangements \nand assessment are in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n39.  The Project will be implemented over 5 years from mid-2007 until mid-2012 (Appendix 7). \nThe implementation period is estimated based on the project scope and construction technology \nrequirements.  The  schedule  is  considered  realistic  and  achievable,  because  the  project \nimplementation  structure  is  in  place  and  preparatory  works  are  underway.  ADB\u2019s  successful \nexperience with similar projects in the PRC, combined with the knowledge and experience of HMG \nand the IAs in wastewater management and other urban environmental improvement projects, \nindicates that the schedule is realistic and achievable. \n \n3.  Procurement \n40.  Goods and works will be procured in accordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2006, \nas amended from time to time). Contracts for goods estimated to exceed $1.0 million and contracts \nfor works estimated to exceed $10.0 million will be procured using international competitive bidding \nprocedures. Contracts for goods and contracts for works estimated to cost equal or less than the \ninternational competitive bidding values, but more than $100,000, will be procured using national \ncompetitive bidding procedures in accordance with the PRC Tendering and Bidding Law (1999), \nsubject  to  modifications  agreed  with  ADB.  Contracts  for  goods  and  works  estimated  to  cost \n$100,000 or less will be procured using shopping procedures. Appendix 8 provides an indicative \n18-month procurement plan for the Project.  \n \n41.  ADB has approved HMG\u2019s request for advance contracting, which includes recruitment of \nconsultants, and procurement of goods and civil works. It also approved a request for retroactive \nfinancing of eligible expenditures up to $30 million (equivalent to 20% of the ADB loan), incurred \nbefore  loan  effectiveness,  but  not  earlier  than  12  months  before  the  signing  of  the  Loan \nAgreement.23 Advance contracting will include (i) prequalification of contractors, (ii) preparation of \ntender  documents,  (iii)  evaluation  of  bids,  and  (iv)  recruitment  of  consultants.  All  advance \ncontracting and retroactive financing will be undertaken in conformity with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines. The issuance of invitations to bid under advance contracting and retroactive financing \nwill be subject to ADB approval. The Government, HMG, and the IAs have also been advised that \napproval of advance contracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the \nProject. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n42.  The Project provides funding for 31 person-months of international consulting services and \n108  person-months  of  national  consulting  services  to  support  the  PMO  and  IAs  in  project \nimplementation, and management and institutional capacity building. A consulting firm will be \nrecruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The consulting firm will \n                                                 \n23 The advance action on the procurement and recruitment of consultants, and the uploading of the general procurement \nnotice on the ADB website, will facilitate the start of the advance action process. ADB Management approved advance \ncontracting and retroactive financing on 23 November 2006. \n ", "13 \nbe selected in accordance with the quality- and cost-based selection method using full technical \nproposal procedures. The consulting services will cover (i) project management and construction \nsupervision,  (ii)  setup  of  the  management  information  system  and  project  performance \nmanagement  system  (PPMS),  (iii)  environmental  management,  (iv)  social  development,  (v) \nfinancial management, (vi) O&M of the project assets, and (vii) institutional strengthening through \nhuman  resources  development  and  training.  The  consultants  also  will  assist  the  PMO  with \nquestions regarding ADB procedures and reporting, procurement, quality control, startup testing, \ncommissioning, O&M, and implementation of the PPMS. The PMO will initiate advance action for \nthe recruitment of consultants, including shortlisting qualified consultants. The outline terms of \nreference for consulting services are in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n5.  Governance and Anticorruption Policy \n43.  ADB\u2019s policy on Anticorruption (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith HMG and the IAs. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these efforts, \nrelevant provisions of ADB\u2019s policy on Anticorruption are included in the loan regulations and the \nbidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with \nthe Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records \nand accounts of HMG, IAs, and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers \nas they relate to the Project. For the Project, a number of anticorruption actions have been \nincluded as covenants in the loan and project agreements. Under these covenants, HMG will:  \n(i)  involve the agencies responsible for oversight of each IA in bidding and construction \nto enhance construction quality control and supervise effective work;  \n(ii)  introduce a dual-signing system in which the civil works contract winner also signs \nan anticorruption contract with the employer;  \n(iii)  periodically  inspect  the  contractor\u2019s  activities  related  to  fund  withdrawals  and \nsettlements;  \n(iv)  engage a project management consultant to support the PMO and the IAs to ensure \ngood governance, accountability, and transparency in project operations;  \n(v)  in  consultation  with  relevant  central  Government  ministries,  update  rules  and \nregulations on local and corporate governance and anticorruption, and enhance \ntransparency of the IAs\u2019 operations; and \n(vi)  disclose  a  summary  of  the  audited  financial  statements  and  project  accounts, \nschedules  of  tariff  increases  and  public  hearings,  and  tracking  of  procurement \ncontract awards on the project website of HMG. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n44.  The ADB loan funds will be disbursed in accordance with the procedures in ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  To  expedite  project \nimplementation through timely release of loan proceeds, APG will establish an imprest account \npromptly after loan effectiveness at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB. Disbursements from \nthe  imprest  account  will  be  supported  by  an  appropriate  withdrawal  application  and  related \ndocumentation. Such documentation will demonstrate, among other things, that the goods and/or \nservices were produced in or from ADB\u2019s members, and are eligible for ADB financing. The initial \namount  to  be  deposited  in  the  imprest  account  will  not  exceed  the  Project\u2019s  estimated \nimplementation expenditures for the next 6 months, or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. \nThe  ADB  statement  of  expenditures  procedure  may  be  used  for  reimbursement  of  eligible \nexpenditures. Individual payments to be reimbursed or liquidated under the procedure will not \n ", "14 \nexceed  $200,000.24 Direct  payment  procedures  will  be  used  for  large  civil  works  contracts. \nFollowing the recommendation of the financial management assessment to improve the internal \ncontrol  system  of  the  IAs,  APG  will  review  and  approve  all  withdrawal  applications  prior  to \nsubmission to ADB. As a condition for disbursement of the loan proceeds for any subcomponent, \nthe Government must submit to ADB the certification that (i) the onlending agreement has been \nentered into between HMG and each concerned IA, and (ii) such onlending agreement contains \nthe same financial terms and conditions as required in the loan agreement. \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n45.  The PMO will prepare semiannual progress reports indicating progress made, problems \nencountered during the period under review, steps taken or proposed to remedy the problems, the \nproposed program of activities, and progress expected in the next half year. The IAs will keep \nrecords to allow the identification of goods and services financed from the loan proceeds, following \naccounting  principles  and  practices  prescribed  by  the  Accounting  Law  of  the  PRC.  This  law \nrequires enterprises to prepare financial statements and generally follow recognized accounting \nstandards. The IAs will maintain separate project accounts and records. The financial statements \nof the project accounts and the annual corporate financial statements for IAs will be subject to \nexternal audit by the HMG Audit Bureau, the Anhui Provincial Audit Bureau, and the State Audit \nAdministration. The audits will be carried out in accordance with regulations for auditing approved \nby the State Council, and must meet ADB requirements. A separate auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of \nthe imprest account and statement of expenditure will be part of the audit reports. The IAs\u2019 annual \naudited financial statements and audited project accounts will be submitted to ADB no later than 6 \nmonths after the end of the fiscal year throughout the implementation period. The Government, \nAPG, and HMG have been informed about the ADB policy requiring the submission of audited \nfinancial  statements  on  time.  HMG  and  the  IAs  will  submit  reports  and  information  to  ADB \nconcerning the use of the loan proceeds, project implementation, and IA performance. These \nreports will include (i) semiannual progress reports on project implementation; (ii) annual reports; \nand (iii) a project completion report, not later than 3 months after the completion of the project \nfacilities. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n46.  The PPMS indicators, their relevance, and monitoring practicalities were confirmed and \nagreed  with  PMO  during  project  preparation.  These  include  (i)  service  levels;  (ii)  treated \nwastewater quality and other operational performance measures; (iii) wastewater percentages \ncollected and treated; (iv) public satisfaction with the urban environment; (v) relevant social and \neconomic data; (vi) health and gender data; (vii) incidence of waterborne and airborne diseases; \n(viii) water quality and incidence of seasonal flooding on the Nanfei River, its tributaries, and Chao \nLake; (ix) traffic conditions in the Xinzhan Zone and accident rates; (x) air pollution reduction \nindicators; (xi) expansion of green space; and (xii) increase in public awareness of environmental \nprotection.  \n \n47.  At the beginning of the Project, the PMO and IAs, with the consultant\u2019s assistance, will \ndevelop comprehensive PPMS procedures to generate data systematically on the inputs and \noutputs of the subcomponents, as well as the agreed indicators (para. 46) to be used to measure \nproject impacts. The PMO will (i) refine the PPMS framework, (ii) confirm achievable targets, (iii) \nfirm up monitoring and recording arrangements, and (iv) establish systems and procedures no later \nthan 6 months after loan effectiveness. \n                                                 \n24 Limits for the imprest account and statement of expenditures are in accordance with a recent review of ADB\u2019s PRC \nportfolio and the financial management assessment of the IAs during project preparation. The proposed limits aim to \nfacilitate improved efficiency in loan disbursement. \n ", "15 \n48.  Under the PPMS framework, baseline and progress data will be reported regularly at the \nprescribed  time  intervals  by  the  IAs,  including  semiannual  reporting  of  the  environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP). The PMO will be responsible for analyzing and consolidating the data \nthrough its management information system, established at the time of loan implementation. The \nPPMS will be designed to permit adequate flexibility to adopt remedial action for project design, \nschedule, activities, and development impacts. The PMO, with the assistance of the consultants, \nwill monitor and assess activities, and report to ADB semiannually on physical implementation and \nfinancial aspects of the Project from commencement until 2 years after project completion. This will \nensure that impacts are monitored and reported in line with ADB requirements. \n \n9.  Project Review \n49.  ADB and the Government will review project implementation jointly at least once a year. In \naddition, ADB and the Government will undertake a comprehensive midterm review 2 years after \nthe start of project implementation. This will include a detailed review of the scope, implementation \narrangements, resettlement, achievement of scheduled targets, and progress on the agenda for \npolicy reform and capacity-building measures. Feedback from the PPMS activities will be analyzed. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Project Benefits and Impacts \n50.  The Project will benefit directly about 2.61 million people living in the project area, of whom \nabout 5.2% are poor. All the residents in Hefei will benefit indirectly, as their living conditions will \nimprove as a result of (i) reduced pollution of Hefei\u2019s surface water, with water quality improving to \nat least class V by 2012, with longer-term potential to be upgraded to class IV and eventually class \nIII; (ii) protection from flooding and elimination of hazards resulting from poor drainage; (iii) 10% \nreduction  in  the  incidence  of  waterborne  and  airborne  diseases  from  2005  levels,  with  a \ncorresponding decline in the number of sick days and expenses for medical treatment; and (iv)  \nincreased traffic flow and shorter waiting times due to an innovative traffic management system \nwith improved road safety, which will reduce traffic accidents, enhance productivity, and lower \nvehicle emissions. \n \nB.  Social Dimensions \n1.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n51.  Resettlement  impacts  have  been  identified  and  resettlement  plans  (RPs)  prepared  in \naccordance with PRC land law and ADB\u2019s policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995). With the \nassistance of local design and social institutes, the IAs prepared three full RPs and five short RPs. \nAll subcomponents were planned to minimize disruption of residential areas and communities. The \nWangtang  II  WWTP  does  not  require  an  RP,  because  the  existing  site  is  sufficient  for  the \nexpansion. Impacts will include (i) people affected by the permanent acquisition of land, (ii) people \naffected by the temporary use of land, and (iii) people whose livelihood is affected. The Project will \nrequire (i) the permanent acquisition of approximately 344 hectares of land (69% of which is \ncultivated); (ii) the temporary acquisition of 29.57 hectares of land; and (iii) the demolition of \napproximately  104,200  square  meters  of  household  building  space,  which  will  require  the \nrelocation  of  884  households  with  2,793  persons.  Land  acquisition,  resettlement,  and  all \nassociated costs are estimated at CNY631.75 million or $79.97 million (equivalent to 21.47% of the \noverall project costs). The summary RP is in Appendix 9. \n \n ", "16 \n52.  ADB requires internal and external resettlement monitoring and evaluation of the affected \npersons (APs) during implementation. The IAs will report progress regularly to the PMO, which will \nsummarize the land acquisition and resettlement progress in the semiannual progress reports to \nADB. The PMO will retain the services of a domestic external monitor for this purpose. The monitor \nwill visit the subcomponents every 6 months to (i) review resettlement progress and the general \nwelfare of those affected, (ii) recommend ways to resolve any issues or problems, and (iii) provide \nadvice to IAs and local officials. The monitor will pay special attention to vulnerable groups, \nincluding women and the poor, to assess whether they have regained fully their standard of living. \nMonitoring and evaluation reports will be prepared every 6 months during implementation, followed \nby an annual report 1 year after the completion of resettlement. These reports will be submitted \nsimultaneously to ADB, PMO, and the IAs. They also will be uploaded onto the ADB website. \n \n2.  Poverty Reduction, Health, and Social Benefits \n53.  Poverty and Social Development Impact. The Project supports the achievement of the \nMDG for environmental sustainability (Goal 7), which aims to halve the proportion of people without \nsustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015 (Target 10), through \nimproved urban environmental management. The Project will benefit directly an urban population \nof  2.61  million  by  improving  environmental  conditions  and  enhancing  sanitation  through \nwastewater treatment, flood prevention and control, protection and landscaping of a former landfill, \nand urban transport services. Of the beneficiary population, 5.2% are classified as poor based on \nthe weighted average local urban poverty line of CNY2,760 per year.25  \n \n54.  Public consultation and participation, which have been key elements of the project design, \nwill continue during project implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. Ongoing consultations also \nwill be carried out by the IAs to (i) meet the evolving needs and expectations of the users, (ii) \nincrease the awareness of the public about the benefits of the Project, (iii) encourage the active \ninvolvement  of  local  communities  to  maximize  their  support  for  the  Project,  (iv)  promote \nenvironmental protection, and (v) raise the social acceptance of tariff increases. The Project will \ncreate 2,830 full-time jobs during construction, of which about 60% will be for the poor and women. \nThose temporarily employed in construction will benefit from the training and experience gained \nunder the Project. This experience is expected to enhance their employment opportunities in other \ninfrastructure projects. Project operations will create 1,080 permanent full-time jobs directly and \nanother 1,730 jobs through multiplier effects, generating approximately CNY45 million in wages per \nyear. To maximize the project benefits, women will be given priority in the employment and training \nopportunities generated in the Project\u2019s construction and operation phases. The impacts of tariff \nincreases on the poor will be offset largely by tariff exemptions or subsidies for poor households. \nHMG has assured ADB that it will undertake a regular review of the impact of wastewater tariff \nadjustments on the poor, and will maintain the provision of subsidies to protect the basic living \nstandards of the urban poor. The Project has no impact on indigenous peoples, as no ethnic \nminority groups are in the project area. The summary poverty reduction and social development \nstrategy is in Appendix 10. Details are in Supplementary Appendix H.  \n \n55.  Health Benefits. The improved environmental situation will reduce the population exposed \nto waterborne and airborne diseases, with a corresponding decline in medical costs and the \nnumber of workdays and school days lost due to sickness. The medical cost savings for children, \nthe elderly, women, and the poor would be greater, as they are most vulnerable to such diseases. \nWomen,  with  more  chances  of  contact  with  water  from  household  responsibilities  (especially \ncooking and washing), will benefit disproportionately from the improvements in sanitation, water \nquality, and urban environment as a result of the Project. The poor, who are disproportionately \n                                                 \n25 Measured by the weighted average local urban poverty line of CNY2,760 per year, or CNY230 ($29.11) per month. \nThis is close to the $1 per day poverty line.   \n ", "17 \nexposed  to  unsanitary  conditions,  will  gain more  than  the  average  population  from  improved \nenvironmental  and  living  conditions.  Baseline  costs  of  environmental  diseases  in  Hefei  are \nestimated at CNY32.5 million per year. To realize the full health benefits, parallel improvements in \npublic health education, higher standards of personal hygiene, disease prevention and control, and \nimproved housing and living conditions will be required. The latter will be particularly important for \nthe poor, who are likely to suffer most from the incidence of waterborne and airborne diseases. \nThe Health Benefits and Monitoring analysis is in Supplementary Appendix I. \n \nC.  Financial Analysis, Sustainability, and Affordability Aspects \n56.  The Project is considered financially viable and sustainable. A financial impact analysis of \nthe revenue-generating subcomponents (wastewater) and the nonrevenue subcomponents (the \nothers) was undertaken. A financial management assessment of the IAs also was conducted. \nThese are discussed in Appendix 11. Details of the financial impact analysis are in Supplementary \nAppendix J, while details of the financial management assessment are in Supplementary Appendix \nK.  \n  \n57.  HWTAD,  which  is  funded  through  budget  allocations  from  the  HFB,  constructed  and \noperated the wastewater subcomponents. Wastewater costs are recovered from all water supply \nconsumers through a wastewater tariff of CNY0.6 per m3 for domestic consumers and a weighted \naverage of CNY0.69 per m3 for all consumers. The financial assessment of sustainability was \nundertaken for the entire wastewater operation, including HWTAD operations and capital finance \nfrom HFB. Financial activity was projected over a 30-year operating period based on anticipated \ncosts, sales, and tariffs with and without the Project.  \n \n58.  The analysis indicates that, if tariffs increase with inflation, wastewater operations will be \nprofitable at the municipality level. Further, tariff revenues would be sufficient to cover counterpart \nfunds during loan implementation and service the ADB loan. HMG is aware that the costs of \nWWTP operators might increase. In line with its commitment to tariff reform, HMG is planning a \nminimum increase of 50% in wastewater tariffs in 2007. HMG realizes that additional increases will \nbe required by the time the new WWTPs are operational, and has indicated that a domestic tariff of \nCNY1.1 per m3 can be assumed for 2010 (nearly double the current CNY0.6 per m3). This would \nput the tariff just above the financial average incremental cost of CNY1.0 per m3. If the wastewater \ntariff is increased to CNY1.1 per m3 by 2010, each of the new WWTPs would achieve full cost \nrecovery, which potentially could attract PSP.   \n \n59.  A project-based financial analysis also was undertaken for the Shuwuli River and Wangtang \nII WWTPs. The analysis assumed that the WWTPs operate as self-financing entities, receiving \ntariff revenues from customers serviced by sewers, while paying costs associated with wastewater \ndelivery. Assuming the planned 83% tariff increase, the financial internal rate of return for both \nplants would be 4.3%, compared with a weighted average cost of capital of 2.6%.26 HWTAD has \nagreed to minimum levels of financial performance during operations, and these are included as \nloan covenants covering capital structure (debt to equity), debt service coverage, and liquidity. \nFinancial  projections  have  estimated  the  tariffs  required  for  an  appropriate  level  of  financial \nperformance.  Periodic  tariff  reviews  will  be  required  to  overcome  the  risk  of  poor  financial \nperformance or unexpected changes in the tariff income. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n26 The financial internal rate of return for the Shiwuli River WWTP depends on an expansion of the planned capacity by \n50,000 m3/day, which is in HMG\u2019s plan. \n ", "18 \n60.  The  nonrevenue  subcomponents  involve  public  infrastructure  managed  by  government \ndepartments with limited or no revenue-generating capacity. Forecast debt service and O&M costs \nfor HMG and Xinzhan Development Zone were compared with relevant annual revenues. These \nwere  found  to  be  about  1.0%  and  3.7%,  respectively.  This  indicates  acceptable  fiscal  risk, \nparticularly in light of the rapid growth in government revenues. Appendix 11 shows the financial \nanalysis. \n \n61.  An affordability analysis was undertaken, based on proposed tariffs and household income \ndata from the social survey. Tariffs under the Project are considered affordable if the combined \naverage water and wastewater charges are less than 5% of household income. Tariffs after the \nproposed 83% increase are affordable to the poorest households, whether or not they receive the \nminimum  living  guarantee  (below  CNY230  per  capita  per  month),  which  exempts  them  from \ncharges for the first 4 m3 of water. The affordability analysis is in Appendix 12. \n \n62.  The results of the financial management assessment indicate that the IAs operate as \ndepartments  of  HMG  with  legal  status  denoted  as  either  revenue-generating  or  nonrevenue-\ngenerating  entities.  Accounting  and  financial  management  systems  of  the  IAs  might  require \nimprovement with respect to internal control. In other respects, systems are in place for financial \nreporting, and accounting is fully developed and adequate for the purpose of loan implementation. \nAudit arrangements are generally adequate, though audits appear to be carried out only when the \ndepartments implement major engineering works. Only HWTAD and Hefei Municipal Drainage \nOffice have experience with externally funded projects. Thus, training on ADB procedures and \nrequirements related to procurement, disbursement, financial reporting, and monitoring for the IAs \nand the project implementing units will be required. The capacity building component includes \nfinancial management training. \n \nD.  Economic Aspects \n63.  The economic analysis provides a rationale and justification for the Project based on policy, \nsector, and local area analysis. It considers the Project, not as a stand-alone investment, but as an \nintegral  part  of  the  ongoing  city,  municipal,  and  basin-wide  environmental  programs  directly \ncontributing to flood control and pollution reduction. This will decrease health costs and increase \nthe overall quality of urban life. For the Project as a whole, the analysis covers the economic \nrationale, the rationale for public intervention, the goals of the investment plan, the design of the \nplan, and the expected economic benefits. The economic rationale is sound, based on control of \nexternalities (water and air pollution) and managing natural monopolies (wastewater treatment and \nurban road provision). The main goal of the investment plan is to meet targets for surface water \nquality. The water quality targets are clearly defined, legally established, and consistent with \ninternational practice. The plan to meet the water quality targets uses centralized WWTPs and river \nand lake cleanup. In addition to helping surface water quality, the river and lake components will \ndecrease flooding and provide significant amenities, many of which will be used by the poor. The \nroad component includes traffic management to control congestion, accidents, and air pollution. \nThe economic internal rate of return for all components is above 12% (the economic opportunity \ncost of capital), and the Project\u2019s overall economic internal rate of return is 27%. A summary \neconomic  analysis  is  in  Appendix  13,  while  the  detailed  economic  and  tariff  analysis  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix L. \n \nE.  Environmental Aspects \n64.  The components and subcomponents have been examined against criteria specified in \nADB\u2019s  Environmental  Guidelines  for  Selected  Infrastructure  Projects. 27    Extensive  public \n                                                 \n27 ADB.1988. Environmental Guidelines for Selected Infrastructure Projects. Manila. \n ", "19 \nconsultations involving surveys, meetings with stakeholders, and focus group discussions were \nundertaken twice during the preparation of the domestic environmental impact assessments (EIA). \nApplication methods and standards for preparation of EIAs are in line with the guidelines of the \nState Environmental Protection Administration, and meet existing national laws and regulations. \nThe  Hefei  Environment  Protection  Bureau  and  Anhui  Environment  Protection  Bureau  have \napproved all the EIAs.  \n \n65.  The summary EIA was circulated to ADB\u2019s Board of Directors and posted on the ADB \nwebsite on 16 November 2006. The Project will improve the urban environment and surface water \nquality in the Nanfei River, its tributaries, and Chao Lake; and will help improve the natural \nenvironment. It will target substantial improvements in wastewater management, and will have \nsignificant positive effects on water pollution control. As a result of improved raw water quality, \nHefei\u2019s residents will be provided with more reliable potable water. The Project will also prevent \nleachate pollution from the closed municipal landfill upstream at Qingxi Road adjacent to the \nNanfei River. It also will improve road management and reduce vehicle emissions in the Xinzhan \nZone through a traffic management system. The Government has confirmed the summary EIA and \nEMP. The summary EIA concludes that the Project will have substantial positive environmental and \nsocioeconomic benefits. Affected people will be resettled and their living conditions improved. The \nProject also will have a sustainable impact on poverty reduction. The adverse impacts on the \nphysical and natural environment during the construction and operations stages of the Project will \nbe largely insignificant with the implementation of the recommended mitigation measures. The \nincremental costs required to achieve these are negligible compared with the costs of the Project. \n \nF.  Projects Risks and Mitigation Measures \n66.  The Project does not have any unusual technical risks. Conventional engineering designs \nwith proven records of reliable performance will be adopted for wastewater management, landfill \nclosure, flood control, road construction and traffic management, and associated landscaping. \nDuring project implementation, the consultants will support the PMO and IAs to ensure delivered \nequipment and works comply with the design requirements and quality standards.  \n \n67.  The following risks could affect timely implementation and economic viability, and reduce \nthe available benefits of the Project: (i) amendments and changes to the Hefei master plans, \nparticularly for the Xinzhan Zone, which could delay the Project; (ii) lack of proper O&M of project \nfacilities; (iii) ineffective organizational structures and inadequate capacity of the IAs, which could \nresult in inefficient project development and implementation delays; (iv) delays in the provision of \ncounterpart funding; (v) failure of HMG to increase wastewater tariffs to meet cost recovery targets; \nand (vi) unforeseen land acquisition and resettlement issues, which could constrain the efficient \nimplementation of the project works and restoration of livelihoods of the APs. \n \n68.  Risk (i) will be mitigated by synchronizing the project design and implementation schedules \nwith  other  projects  planned  in  Hefei.  HMG  also  has  provided  specific  assurances  that  are \ncovenanted  in  the  Loan  Agreement.  Risks  (ii)  and  (iii)  will  be  mitigated  through  provision  of \ninstitutional capacity building for the IAs with the support of the consultants. Risks (iv) and (v) will \nbe mitigated through covenanted assurances from HMG on the provision of counterpart funding, \nand regular tariff reviews and increases. Risk (vi) will be mitigated by strengthening the internal \nmonitoring and supervision by PMO and the IAs, and by engaging a qualified external agency to \nmonitor and evaluate resettlement. Several other measures also will help mitigate the project risks: \n(i)  appointment  of  project  implementation  and  monitoring  consultants,  including  environmental \nmonitoring consultants; (ii) EMP monitoring and mitigation arrangements; (iii) EMP environmental \nmanagement training; and (iv) specific assurances from HMG that the PLG and PMO are retained \nfor the loan implementation period and beyond. \n ", "20 \nV.  ASSURANCES28 \n69.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government, APG, and HMG have provided the \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the Loan and Project Agreements:  \n \n(i)  HMG will ensure that (a) all land and rights-of-way are made available in a timely \nmanner,  and  (b)  each  IA  together  with  the  Public  Security  Bureau  cooperate  to \nimplement  required  road  safety  measures,  and  after  construction  submit  emission \nregulation limits and enforcement plans. \n(ii)  HMG will ensure that (a) all local and foreign currency counterpart financing necessary \nfor the Project, including equity contributions and cash advances, are provided in time \nto enable completion of project activities; (b) additional counterpart funding will be \nprovided for any shortfall of funds or cost overruns; (c) the IAs for all components \nreceive  adequate  O&M  budgets  to  sustain  the  facilities;  (d)  the  IA  responsible  for \nwastewater  undertakes  annual  reviews  of  tariffs  and  fees  by  category,  including \nnecessary adjustments to ensure full recovery of O&M, interest charges, depreciation, \ndebt repayment, together with a reasonable profit margin; (e) active support is provided \nfor any potential PSP; (f) the operating companies maintain proper financial ratios \nduring project operation; and (g) the wastewater company establishes and maintain a \nfinancial management system in accordance with the Guidelines for Governance and \nFinancial Management of an ADB Investment Project.  \n(iii)  HMG  will  ensure  that  (a)  the  RPs  will  be  implemented  promptly  and  efficiently  in \naccordance with their terms; (b) the RP provisions will be undertaken in accordance \nwith  all  applicable  PRC  laws  and  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  Involuntary \nResettlement; (c) all APs are given adequate opportunity to participate in resettlement \nplanning and implementation; and ensure that they will be at least as well off as they \nwould have been in the absence of the Project; (d) timely provision of counterpart funds \nwill  be  paid  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities;  and  (e)  any  financial \nobligations in excess of the RP budget estimates are met. \n(iv)  HMG will ensure that each subcomponent IA construct, operate, maintain, and monitor \nthe project facilities in strict conformity with (a) all applicable laws, regulations, and \nstandards;  and  ADB\u2019s  procedure  for  environmental  protection,  health,  labor,  and \noccupational safety; (b) the environmental mitigation and monitoring measures detailed \nin the  approved EIAs, summary EIA, and EMP for the Project; and (c) that adequate \nnumbers  of  personnel  are  engaged  to  monitor  implementation  of  the  EMP,  under \nguidance  of  the  Hefei  Environment  Protection  Bureau  and  Anhui  Environment \nProtection Bureau and/or other relevant environmental monitoring centers. \n \nVI.

Introduction \n \n1.  Before the economic reforms of the 1980s, the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC) was the sole provider of urban services. Wastewater management practice was \nbased on septic tanks, designated open drainage ditches, and no treatment. Urban services were \nfunded through tax revenue, and consumers paid minimal or no charges. Road infrastructure also \nwas poorly developed and vehicle ownership was very low \n \n2.  When economic reforms started in 1978, the urban population grew significantly from about \n160 million (17% of the population) in 1975 to 560 million (43% of the population) in 2005.  This \ntrend is expected to increase to levels of 50% or more over the next 10 years. With this population \ngrowth came an increase in the number of cities\u2014from 122 in 1949 to 661 in 2004. This rapid \nurbanization has increased the pressure on the environment, as well as the management and \nfinancing of public services. The urbanization of rural areas and the high rates of rural-to-urban \nmigration have resulted in a large proportion of migrants living in inadequately serviced peri-urban \nareas.  This  increases  pressure  on  infrastructure  services,  including  urban  transport,  power, \ntelecommunication, water supply, wastewater treatment, and solid waste management. \n \n3.  Hefei  municipality,  which  comprises  four  urban  districts  and  three  counties,  has  a \npopulation of 4.5 million. Like most cities in the PRC, Hefei has grown rapidly over the past 20 \nyears. The population is expected to increase to 6.3 million by 2010 and 8.0 million by 2020. The \nmunicipal gross domestic product is forecast to increase 13.5% per year on average during 2006\u2013\n2010. By 2010, the urbanization rate in Hefei will reach 60%. With the development of high-speed \neconomy,  the  spread  of  urbanization,  and  increase  of  population,  the  city\u2019s  environmental \nconditions  (including  wastewater  and  waste  management),  traffic  situation,  and  quality  of \ngroundwater continue to deteriorate and need urgent attention. \n \nB.  Hefei Urban Plans \n \n4.  The Hefei 11th Five-Year Program (FYP) for 2006\u20132010 and the Hefei Urban Development \nMaster Plan (in draft form) are the blueprints for the physical, economic, and social development of \nHefei in the medium to long term. These plans are based on the population projections of 6.3 \nmillion in 2010 and 8 million in 2020.  \n \n5.  The urban master plan proposes a redevelopment of the old urban center into a new trade \nand finance center. New residential and industrial developments are under construction, and more \nare planned in all directions from the middle of the city to cater for Hefei\u2019s prominent role as a \nmodern science and technology center. Hefei also is becoming an increasingly important road and \nrail transport hub, which will take on more significance when the planned Jianghuai canal linking \nthe Yangtze and the Huai river systems is constructed.   \n \n6.  Economic growth in Hefei is planned simultaneously with expanded urbanization of land \nand population growth. In the 11th FYP, the urban area will increase by 33% from 2005 to 2010.  \nAnnual growth rates of 15.5% are forecast for 2006\u20132010, and a per capita gross domestic product \nof  $5,000  is  forecast  in  2010.  Such  growth  will  exert  substantial  pressure  on  the  urban \ninfrastructure,  and  will  create  much  demand  for  improvement  and  expansion.  Wastewater \ntreatment, sewer network replacement, flood control, and improved traffic management are urgent \nareas for upgrading and expansion. The Asian Development Bank-financed Project is essential to \nhelp the Hefei municipal government (HMG) realize its development goals. \n ", "26  Appendix 2 \nC.  Water Sector \n \n7.  The Hefei piped water system takes water from the Dongpu and Dafangyin reservoirs, \nwhich receive good quality water from the upper reaches of the Nanfei River. Widespread pollution \nsources downstream of these reservoirs lowers river water quality to Class V\u2014well below the \nClass III required for urban piped water supply. As a result, water can no longer be abstracted from \nthe rivers or from Chao Lake, one of the five major freshwater lakes in the PRC. Chao Lake, which \nis part of the \u201cleft bank river system\u201d of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, has at least six \nrivers running into it. The lake has an artificially controlled level with a storage capacity of 4.8 billion \ncubic meters (m3). The development of cities and industrial plants around the lake, and increasing \namounts of agricultural fertilizers and pesticides seeping into the lake, has severely polluted the \nwater.  \n \n8.  As urbanization increases, the Dongpu and the Dafangyin reservoirs to the north of the city \nalso face serious pollution problems, with domestic and other sewage discharged freely. The \nDongpu provides water to all four Hefei water treatment plants (WTP) (also referred to as water \npurification plants), and the Dafangyin will serve the planned WTP No. 6. A separate drainage and \nwastewater system is planned for this area, which will help to protect the reservoirs as water \nsources. \n \n9.  The Hefei Water Supply Group Co. Ltd (HWSC), wholly owned by HMG, supplies piped \nwater in Hefei. The Hefei Water Supply Office administers the sector. The separate Hefei Water \nAffairs Bureau deals with all waters and water resources, including rivers, flood control, etc., \nalthough it is in charge of only the Chao Lake subcomponent of the Project. Piped water supply \ncapacity of the four WTPs in Hefei is 875,000 m3/day. Raw water pumping stations abstract from \nthe Dongpu Reservoir. A similar station on Chao Lake no longer is used due to water pollution. In \naddition, five local pressurization stations distribute the treated water. The majority of the pipes are \nnearly 40 years old, with some as old as 50 years. Water losses have increased from 7% in 2000 \nto 12% in 2005 (on top of 2\u20133% production losses). Although this is low by international standards, \nthe trend is causing concern since the old pipes are obviously deteriorating. Besides the Hefei City \ndistricts, HWSC also provides water to Shangpai town (50,000 m3/day in 2010) in Feixi county, and \nModian township (20,000 m3/day in 2010) in the Yaohai Industrial Area. Plans also are being made \nto supply Shangdun town and Luyang and Shauangfeng industrial areas (50,000 m3/day in 2010). \n \n10.  In addition to HWSC, 25 self-providing water works in Hefei have been built by large-scale \nenterprises and scientific research institutes. Taken together, these add 20\u201325% to the water \nsupply.  The  city  districts  also  might  have  small  private  wells,  as  in  the  counties.  The  Hefei \nMunicipal Waster Supply Plan and its update state that Hefei groundwater is a scarce resource \nand extraction should be controlled. Although future use of groundwater might be necessary, \nconsumers should be encouraged to use piped water. \n \n11.  Domestic water consumption recorded by HWSC, and using their own population served \nestimates, was some 165\u2013170 liter per capita per day (lpcd) in 2005. This consumption drops to \n156 lpcd if the entire registered population is assumed to be served and to 121 lpcd if the total \npopulation is included. Even the latter is higher than the 112 lpcd recorded as a PRC urban median \nby  the  China  Water  Supply  Association  in  2004.  Industrial  demand  in  Hefei  has  declined  in \nabsolute and percentage terms. In 1995, it was 68,000 m3, or 42% of total sales. In 2004, it was \nonly 40,000 m3, or 20% of the total. The reason for the decline is the change in type of industry and \nthe city\u2019s efforts to promote efficient use of water. \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  27 \nD.  Wastewater Sector \n \n1.  Wastewater Treatment \n \n12.  The Hefei Wastewater Treatment Administrative Department plans and controls wastewater \nin Hefei. Ownership is more complex, however. A Sino-German joint venture operates the largest \nwastewater treatment plant (WWTP), the Wangxiaoying WWTP.1 The city owns Wantang I, the \nnext largest WWTP, but the Hefei Water Star Company operates it.  Hefei Wastewater Treatment \nAdministrative Department and Hefei Urban Construction Investment and Holding Co. Ltd, under \nguidance from the Hefei Municipal Construction Commission, will build the planned Wantang II and \nShiwuli WWTPs under the Project. \n \n13.  The extension of the city into new areas will increase the need for a sewerage network, as \nwell as treatment. The city has four full-scale WWTPs, with a combined capacity of 437,000 m3/ \nday. This is 50% of the city\u2019s maximum water supply capacity of 875,000 m3/day, but about 70% of \nthe wastewater flows. The updated Wastewater Plan includes three new projects to address the \nexpected  increase  in  wastewater  flows.  The  Project  will  finance  Wangtang  WWTP  II,  with  a \ncapacity of 100,000 m3/day, and Shiwuli River WWTP, with capacity of 50,000 m3/day. The third, \nCaitanpu WWTP with capacity of 25,000 m3/day, will to be financed using domestic resources. \nWith the construction of these three additional WWTPs, the treatment capacity of Hefei City is \nexpected to increase to 80% of wastewater generated by 2010. About 9% of wastewater treated, \nor 30,000\u201350,000 m3/day, is recycled. The 11th FYP proposes that this should increase to 260,000 \nm3/day, a 20-fold increase, by 2010. To meet this expectation, tertiary treatment (water purification) \nis proposed for the Wantang WWTP II. \n \n14.  The sewer and wastewater network is 250 kilometers (km) long, with a capacity to handle \n437,000 m3/day. This is only a proportion of total requirements. By 2010, the Project will provide an \nadditional 313 km, which will improve the situation significantly. \n \n2.  Sludge Generation, Handling, and Disposal \n \n15.  Wastewater treatment produces significant amounts of sludge, which makes disposal an \nimportant part of operations. The rate of sludge production is approximately 0.5%\u20131.3% of the \nwastewater treated (at a water content of 97%). Sludge produced in Hefei is dried into fertilizer.   \n \n16.  Sludge  contains  large  amounts  of  organic  matter,  comprising  nutrients  and  disease-\ninducing  organisms  and/or  toxic  substances.  Consequently,  the  sludge  must  be  treated  and \nutilized, or disposed of carefully. If simply piled freely, secondary contamination would result, \ncausing widespread surface and groundwater pollution with serious consequences for recipient \nwater bodies such as Chao Lake.  \n \n17.  If  fully  treated,  Hefei\u2019s  wastewater  volume  would  produce  820  tons  sludge  per  day. \nHowever, with the short-term wastewater treatment capacity, the amount of sludge generation \nwould be 575 tons per day. HMG is considering a number of options for sludge treatment, including \nagricultural utilization, incineration, and landfill disposal. HMG is analyzing the costs and benefits of \nthese options to select the most cost-effective solution. In the interim, surplus sludge that is not \n                                                 \n1  Wangxiaoying WWTP Phase II was financed by ADB. 1996.

Manila (Loans 1490 and 1491-PRC and TA \n2693-PRC, approved on 26 November), which was completed in 2002. \n ", "28  Appendix 2 \ndried into fertilizer will be taken to the sanitary landfill site at Longquan in the eastern part of the \ncity. \n \n3.  Flood Control \n \n18.  Although Hefei has been prone to flooding, much work has been done in the past 50 years \nto protect river banks. As a result, the last three major floods affected a steadily decreasing area of \nthe city. The last major flood was in 1991, when 5.5 square kilometers of the city and 86 square \nkilometers of rural areas along the Nanfei River were flooded. Some of these areas now have been \nprotected, but HMG has decided to increase protection to cover a 1-in-100 year flood within the \nwhole Hefei urban area.2 This is included as a policy issue in the Hefei 11th FYP.  Five river areas \nhave  been  identified  as  needing  protection:  the  Sili,  Banqiao,  and  Ershibu  rivers,  which  are \nincluded under the Project; and the Shiwuli and Nanfei rivers to the south of the city, which are not \nincluded.  \n \n19.  The Chao Lake Basin Flood Control Plan has been implemented, and the majority of areas \nabutting Hefei are protected to 1-in-10 to 1-in-20 year levels. The Chao Lake subcomponent within \nthe Project will provide improved flood protection and erosion control measures in the northern \nsection of Chao Lake under HMG administration.  \n \n20.  The  Hefei  Municipal  Drainage  Office,  under  Hefei  Urban  Construction  Investment  and \nHolding Co. Ltd., will implement the three river flood control project subcomponents. When the \nprojects are completed, the municipal engineering maintenance department will provide most of \nthe  maintenance.  The  Hefei  Chao  Lake  Administrative  Bureau  will  organize  the  Chao  Lake \nsubcomponent.  \n \nE.  Solid Waste Sector \n \n21.  The Project includes the restoration of a closed landfill site at Qingxi Road. A medical and \nhazardous waste site originally was included in the Project, but was taken out. As the Qingxi Road \nsite  does  not  include  any  solid  waste  disposal,  an  analysis  of  the  solid  waste  sector  was \nunnecessary. \n \nF.  Road Sector \n \n22.  Due  to  the  rapid  growth  of  Hefei  and  resulting  increase  in  traffic  volume,  the \nComprehensive Transport Plan of Hefei City (1995\u20132010) is no longer considered valid. HMG is \nplanning to prepare a new plan to meet the medium- to long-term needs of the city. Nevertheless, \nthe Comprehensive Transport Plan of Hefei City and the Hefei City and County network map have \nbeen used as the basis for the road sector analysis. The city is being developed on the basis of \nring roads and a grid road network. Since 1983, more than 20 trunk roads have been renovated. \nAs of 2004, the Hefei municipal area had 385 km of roads: 26 main roads with a length of 151 km \nand 66 secondary roads with a length of 234 km. Roads leading to the three counties totaled 769 \nkm. The total road length including rural areas was 1,010 km.  \n \n23.  The Xinzhan Zone, the focal point of the road subcomponent, is a rapidly expanding urban \narea in northeast Hefei. It was established in 1992 to become the city\u2019s road and rail transport hub \nin line with HMG development policy. \n \n                                                 \n2  Hefei Urban Flood Control Plan issued in 1996, updated in 2003 but awaiting approval. \n ", "  Appendix 2  29 \n24.  In 2004, the number of motorized vehicles in Hefei municipality totaled 215,296, including \n6,500 taxis and 2,529 buses. In the past 5 years, the number of vehicles has grown on average \n16% a year, with registered private cars growing more rapidly at 25% per year over the same \nperiod. In 2005, the Xinzhan Zone had 28,234 registered vehicles within the zone and 41,023 \nauthorized drivers. The urban transport infrastructure cannot meet the increasing demand. With \nsuch increases in vehicular traffic, traffic management needs to be upgraded to improve traffic flow \nand  reduce  emissions.  The  limited  road  space  and  inefficient  use  of  the  existing  traffic \nmanagement system are creating road safety concerns for drivers, pedestrians, and non-motorized \ntransport  users.  A  well-planned  urban  road  network,  therefore,  is  necessary  to  ensure  the \nsustainable development of Hefei. \n \n25.  The Hefei Urban Master Plan proposes improving the road and rail transport links to make \nthe city an important transportation hub for the future. Furthermore, the 11th FYP prioritizes the \ndevelopment of the Xinzhan (new station) pilot area into an economically important business and \nresidential area that will need an effective and efficient transportation network. The Project includes \nthe following: \n(i)  A traffic management scheme focusing on signage and traffic lights, which will be \nbuilt  using  a  central  control  system  to  improve  synchronization  of  traffic  light \npatterns, facilitate uninhibited traffic flow, and minimize slow and stop movement of \nvehicles.  \n(ii)  Enhanced management of road safety, which has been included for the first time as \npart  of  the  United  Nations  policy  for  sustainable  development,  to  reduce  the \nfrequency, severity, and cost to the community of road accidents. This will benefit \nthe low-income people who are pedestrians, public bus users, and bicycle riders; \nand will increase the economic benefit of the infrastructure investment.  \n(iii)  Integration with other transport modes, logistic centers, and urban characteristics.3  \n \n26.  Consequently, the road and traffic management subcomponent is directly responsive to \nHefei\u2019s urban development plan, which calls for the expansion of Xinzhan Zone into a modern area \nwith commercial and residential areas cohabiting in harmony. The Project, therefore, will assist the \nHMG significantly in realizing these goals to develop in the Xinzhan Pilot Area a modern integrated \ntraffic management system that can be extended to other parts of Hefei and to other cities. \n \n \n                                                 \n3  HMG has built a zonal vehicle emissions testing center near the Xinzhan Zone for commercial and noncommercial \nvehicles to improve environmental monitoring. \n ", "30  Appendix 3 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE \n \nTable A3.1: Assistance Funded by ADB for Urban Development and Environment \n    Date of  Amount \nNo.  Name  Approval  ($ million) \nA.

Background \n \n1.  The Hefei Urban Environment Improvement Project comprises the following components: (i) \nwastewater and waste management with four subcomponents\u2014Shiwuli Wastewater Treatment \nPlant (WWTP), Wangtang II WWTP, Hefei Sewer network improvement, and Qingxi Road landfill \nclosure; (ii) river rehabilitation and flood control with four subcomponents\u2014Ershibu River, Banqiao \nRiver, Sili River, and Chao Lake; and (iii) improved road infrastructure and traffic management in \nthe Xinzhan zone. For the Wangtang II WWTP, the expansion of facilities will utilize existing land \nwithin the plant boundary. Hence, it will not require any resettlement. For the three subcomponents \nof  Shiwuli  WWTP  and  related  sewers,  Ershibu  River  and  Xinzhan  Road  infrastructure,  a  full \nresettlement plan (RP) was prepared. For the remaining five subcomponents, a short RP was \nprepared.1  \n \nB.  Resettlement Impacts \n \n2.  To avoid or minimize resettlement impacts, local officials and village and street committees \nwere consulted extensively during the feasibility study stages. The Project will affect 20 urban \ncommunities and 11 villages in three districts (Baohe, Luyang, and Yaohai), one development zone \n(Xinzhan), and two counties (Feidong and Feixi), all within Hefei municipality. Many of the affected \nrural communities are villages on the city fringe, which are already urbanizing (Table A9).  \n \nTable A9: Summary of Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts \nPermanent  Temporary \nOf which  House  Affected \n  Project Subcomponent  land  Land  Budget a  \ncultivated  Demolition  Persons \nRef:  Site  acquisition  (ha)  Occupation  (m2)  (APs)   ($\u2019000) \n(ha)  (ha) \n1.1  Shiwuli WWTP  5.18  3.37  1.67  0  256  841 \n1.2  Wangtang II WWTP  0  0  0  0  0  0 \n1.3  Urban Sewer Network  0.10  0  2.67  0  4  38 \n1.4  Qingxi Road Landfill  35.60  0  0  0  131  2,576 \n2.1  Ershibu River Improvement  88.42  70.44  8.67  26,170  2,364  24,675 \n2.2  Banqiao River Improvement  49.07  49.07  4.67  180  1,420  10,461 \n2.3  Sili River Improvement  12.07  11.53  0  11,328  242  4,080 \n2.4  Chao Lake Flood Control  11.47  9.31  11.89  0  827  1,531 \n3.1  Xinzhan Zone Roads  142.45  93.65  0  66,496  2,837  35,766 \n  Total  344.36  237.37  29.57  104,174  8,081  79,968 \nAP = affected person, ha = hectare, m2 = square meter, WWTP = wastewater treatment plant.  \na Exchange rate: $1 = CNY7.9. \nSource: Hefei municipal government. \n \n3.  The  Project  will  permanently  requisition  344.36  hectare  (ha)  of  land,  of  which  69.0% \n(237.37  ha)  is  classified  as  cultivated  land.  In  addition,  29.57  ha  of  land  will  be  occupied \ntemporarily during construction. The Project will demolish 884 residential houses demolished with \nan area of 104,174 square meters. The Project will affect directly 8,081 persons. 7,545 persons will \nhave partial land loss and 2,793 persons will require house relocation, of whom 2,261 persons also \nwill lose some land. The Shiwuli River WWTP subcomponent involved widening two roads and \ndemolishing 23 units and households. These were undertaken using government funds. Similarly, \n                                                 \n1 Three full RPs: (i) Shiwuli WWTP and sewer network subcomponent, (ii) Ershibu River comprehensive treatment \nsubcomponent, and (iii) improved road infrastructure and traffic management in the Xinzhan Zone. Five short RPs: (i) \nBanqiao River comprehensive treatment subcomponent, (ii) improvement of the closed Qingxi Road landfill site \nsubcomponent, (iii) comprehensive ecological and environmental control along Chao Lake of Hefei Municipality, (iv) \nHefei  urban  sewerage  network  improvement  subcomponent,  and  (v)  Sili  River  rehabilitation  and  flood  control \nimprovement works subcomponent. \n ", "42  Appendix 9 \nthe sewer network subcomponent involved widening one road and demolishing 12 units and \nhouseholds  using  government  funds.  The  Hefei  Industrial  Design  Institute  of  Coal  Ministry \nconducted due diligence for both subcomponents in August 2006, confirmed that no resettlement \nissues were outstanding. \n \nC.  Policy and Legal Framework \n \n4.  For people who will be unavoidably affected by the Project, the resettlement objective is to \nachieve equal, or better, income and living standards, in line with the People\u2019s Republic of China \nlaws  and  regulations, as  well  as the  policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995)  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). The compensation for permanent land loss and house demolition is \nbased on the Land Administration Law of People\u2019s Republic of China (2004); the State Council \nDecision  to  Deepen  Reform  and  Strictly  Enforce  Land  Administration  (Document  28  dated \nNovember 2004); Interim Methods for Acquisition of Collective-Owned Land of Hefei Municipality, \nHefei Municipal Government (HMG) (HMG [2003]138 effective 1 January 2003); Hefei Guidelines \nfor Implementing State Council\u2019s No. 28 Documents (HMG [2005]10); and Approval on Basic \nCompensation  Rate,  Price  Difference  of  Property  Ownership  Replacement,  and  Temporary \nResettlement Subsidies of Hefei Urban Housing Demolition, issued by HMG, (Hemi [2006] 32). The \ncutoff date for eligibility for compensation and assistance under the Project will be the date the \nHMG approves the RPs. \n \n5.  After  consulting  with  local  governments  and  affected  persons  (APs),  the  project \nimplementing agencies (IAs) adopted a set of compensation standards based on the replacement \ncost  and  general  practice  in  the  project  districts  and  counties.  The  resettlement  principles \nestablished for the Project are: (i) wherever feasible, land acquisition and involuntary resettlement \nwill be avoided or minimized through the development of design alternatives and the choice of the \nbest alternative; (ii) compensation and entitlements provided will be based on market value or \nreplacement value, and must be adequate to allow those affected to maintain or improve their pre-\nproject standard of living; (iii) temporary land occupancy and the period of disruption are to be \nminimized; (iv) all affected people, whether legal or non-legal residents, are to be taken into \nconsideration and accounted for; (v) where the landholding per capita is not enough to maintain the \nprevious  livelihood  standards,  other  income-generating  activities  will  be  provided  for;  (vi) \nvulnerable  groups  and  the  floating  population  will  be  given  preference  in  such  matters  as \ncompensation,  housing  assignment,  transfer,  and  employment;  (vii)  all  those  affected  will  be \ninformed adequately about eligibility, compensation rates and standards, livelihood and income \nrestoration plans, and project timing; and (viii) close monitoring and timely actions will be carried \nout to identify and resolve problems as they arise.  \n \n6.  For land acquisition, a land compensation fee will be paid to the affected village and street \ncommittees, while a resettlement subsidy due to land loss will be paid to affected households. \nCompensation for young crops, auxiliaries, and other assets will be paid directly to their owners. \nCompensation for the loss of residential housing will be paid directly to the owners according to the \nappraised value of the property. Displaced persons will have the option to purchase residential \nhouses, get a replacement house, or rebuild their houses on housing plots provided to them \nwithout charge. Compensation for the loss of assets or income of enterprises and shops will be \npaid directly to the owners based on the negotiated agreements.  \n \nD.  Resettlement and Rehabilitation  \n \n7.  To minimize the resettlement impact and restore their living conditions and livelihoods, the \nRPs  include  measures  for  relocation  and  income  restoration.  Different  schemes  for  income \nrestoration will be carried out according to the economic characteristics of the affected streets and \nvillages. The main income-restoration measures are (i) cash compensation, (ii) transfer from rural \nto urban registration and joining in the urban social safeguard net, (iii) provision of employment \nopportunities  during  project  construction  and  operation,  and  (iv)  provision  of  training  and \nemployment  information.  Village  collectives  will  invest  land  compensation  in  economic \n ", "  Appendix 9          43 \ndevelopment and social infrastructure, according to the needs of the villagers. Through these \nmeasures, the APs should earn stable incomes that fully restore their living standards. \n \n8.  In addition, more attention will be paid to the compensation and rehabilitation of vulnerable \ngroups. These groups will receive additional assistance as follows: (i) if an affected household \nowns one house with less than 45 square meters, additional compensation will be provided; (ii) \nlocal government will provide economic or low-rent housing for vulnerable families; (iii) the local \nCivil Affaires Bureaus will include the vulnerable groups in the urban social safeguard net or rural \nsocial safety system; and (iv) employment opportunities will be provided to seriously affected \nvulnerable groups, especially women.  \n \nE.  Resettlement Cost and Fund Management  \n \n9.  Land acquisition and resettlement, including contingencies and land taxes, is estimated to \ncost  CNY631.75  million  in  2006  prices  ($79.97  million),  representing  21.47%  of  the  project \ninvestment. This cost is included in the Project budget and will be funded by Hefei Municipal \nFinance  Bureau.  Each  RP  for  the  eight  subcomponents  contains  a  detailed  budget  and  a \ncompensation entitlement matrix. Compensation funds will be paid and used according to the \ncompensation policies and standards defined in the RPs, under the supervision of the internal \nmonitoring agencies and regular review by the external monitoring agency. Detailed measurement \nsurveys will be conducted in each affected community, village, enterprise, and shop. Further, \ncompensation contracts will be negotiated and signed with the community residents committees \nand village committees, households, enterprises, and shop owners. \n \nF.  Information Disclosure, Participation, and Grievance Procedures \n \n10.  The  APs  were  fully  consulted  and  informed  during  the  preparation  of  the  RPs.  Local \nrepresentatives  participated  in  planning  meetings,  interviews,  focus  group  discussions,  public \nconsultation workshops, and community consultations; and their comments and concerns were \nintegrated into the RPs. The draft RPs will be distributed to the affected districts and community \nresidents committees and villages, and resettlement information booklets were disseminated to the \nAPs in early November 2006. In accordance with ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy, the RPs \nwere posted on the ADB website on 20 December 2006. The project IAs will set up project \nresettlement  agencies  to  supervise  implementation,  continue  the  public consultations,  monitor \nprogress, and deal with grievances. The grievance redress procedures are well established\u2014they \nare explained in the resettlement plans and referred to in the resettlement information booklets. \n \nG.  Institutional Arrangement and Schedule  \n \n11.  The project management office (PMO) will assume overall responsibility for supervising \nresettlement. The IAs for the project components will take charge of resettlement compensation \npayment and supervision as part of their functions. The resettlement implementation schedules are \nprepared based on the overall project preparation and construction timetable. No land acquisition \nor demolition will start until RPs are updated based on designs and approved by ADB. Some land \nacquisition is scheduled to begin in early 2007, and all components will be completed by the end of \n2008. Housing relocation will start from July 2007, and livelihood and living conditions will be \nrestored to at least their pre-project level by the end of 2008.   \n \nH.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n12.  Internal and external monitoring of resettlement will be conducted. Each IA will carry out \ninternal supervision and monitoring to ensure compliance with the provisions of the RP. The PMO \nand IAs will engage an independent agency for semiannual monitoring and evaluation, followed by \nan  annual  report  1  year  after  the  completion  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  External \nmonitoring reports will be forwarded directly to the PMO and ADB. \n \n ", "44  Appendix 10 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n \nA.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?      priority in country poverty partnership   \n      No  agreement?      No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in (PRC): \n \nEnvironmental sustainability and poverty reduction have become central tasks in People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). \nConsiderable progress has been made on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). However, progress on some \ngoals and targets has been slow with respect to improving the proportion of the population with access to safe drinking \nwater and reversing environmental degradation. The Project supports the achievement of the MDG for environmental \nsustainability (Goal 7), which aims to halve the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water \nand basic sanitation by 2015 (Target 10), through improved urban environmental management. \n \nThe project impact area of Hefei Urban Environment Improvement Project covers four districts (Baohe, Luyang, \nShushan and Yaohai) and three counties (Changfeng, Feidong, and Feixi) within Hefei City. It will benefit 4.5 million \npeople, including 2.61 million people directly and 1.89 million people indirectly. The poverty and social impacts of the \nProject include: (i) improved environmental conditions and enhanced sanitation through wastewater treatment, flood \nprevention and control, protection and landscaping of a former landfill site, and urban transport services within Hefei \nCity;  (ii)  increased  employment  and  income-generation  opportunities  from  temporary  job  creation  during  the \nconstruction phase and permanent job creation during the operational phase; (iii) reduction in the incidence of \nwaterborne and airborne diseases, with associated reduction in medical costs, and in the number of workdays and \nschool days lost; (iv) reduced flooding with associated damages and economic losses; (v) reduced traffic congestion, \ntraffic accidents, and vehicle emission pollution; increased mobility; better and quicker access to markets, employment \nopportunities, and social services; and accelerated economic development; (vi) value-added benefits from local \nprocurement; (vii) improved investment conditions to stimulate the development of the local economy to create new \njobs and income-generating opportunities, and to accelerate the rehabilitation of Hefei City\u2019s ecological system; and \n(viii) accelerated development of the tourism industry in Hefei City, particularly the Chao Lake area. As a result, the \nlocal residents of Hefei City will enjoy a better quality of life with reduced poverty; increased employment, and \ninvestment and business opportunities; and improved health status. \n \nThe Project will provide 2,830 full-time jobs during construction, of which about 60% will be for the poor and women. \nThose temporarily employed in construction will benefit from additional training and experience that will provide them \nwith opportunities in future planned infrastructure projects. Project operations will create 1,080 full-time permanent \njobs directly and another 1,730 jobs through multiplier effects, generating approximately CNY45.00 million in wages \nper year. \n \nA health impact analysis was conducted to estimate the health benefits associated with wastewater, improved flood \ncontrol, and improved traffic management. In estimating the potential health benefits (savings) attributable to the \nProject, a 40% reduction in waterborne and vector-borne diseases was assumed (World Development Report: \nInvestigating Health, World Bank 1993). The \u201cwithout-project\u201d scenario projects that the incidence of water-related \nhealth costs will (i) increase in real terms with increasing urbanization, (ii) increase untreated wastewater volumes, \nand (iii) increase the pollution of receiving water bodies and generally degrade the urban environment because of lack \nof effective wastewater management services. Health costs have been conservatively assumed to increase by about \n10% annually from 2007 to 2032. Health benefits have been estimated for the \u201dwith-project\u201d scenario, starting to \naccrue from 2012 (the Project\u2019s first full year of operations). As a result of improved environmental pollution control, \nthe population exposed to pollution-related diseases will decline, with the associated reduction in medical costs and \ndrop in number of workdays and school days lost due to sickness. Baseline costs of environmental diseases in Hefei \nare estimated at some CNY32.5 million per year. The net present value of the benefits attributable to the Project, \nwhich will be mainly in urban areas, is estimated at CNY16.3 million ($2.1 million) in 2010\u20132032.  \n \nTo realize the full health benefits, the following will be required: (i) parallel improvements in public health education, (ii) \nhigher standards of personal hygiene, (iii) prevention and control, and (iv) improved housing and living conditions. \nThese will be particularly important for the poor, who are likely to suffer most from the incidence of pollution-related \ndiseases.  The  arrangements  for  monitoring  health  benefits  will  be  incorporated  in  the  project  performance \nmanagement system to be established for comprehensive project impact monitoring. The qualitative benefits of the \nProject will be (i) reduced exposure to waterborne and airborne diseases associated with treatment of a greater \nproportion of wastewater and reduced sewer overflows, and less water bodies receiving wastewater pollutants; (ii) \nreduced groundwater contamination; and (iii) reduced vehicular emissions due to an improved traffic management. \n ", "    Appendix 10       45  \n   \nThe most vulnerable groups including the poor, women, elderly, and the floating population, who are more vulnerable \nto adverse environmental conditions and the lack of financial resources, will benefit disproportionately from the \nimproved environmental quality and health benefits. Poor households and vulnerable groups, which tend to reside in \nareas with poor service levels and are less able to cope with the disruption and illness caused by poor services, will \ngain significant benefits from the Project. The improved wastewater management services and reductions in flooding \nand illness also will reduce women\u2019s burden of work. Poor households will receive tariff exemptions or subsidies for \nservices, largely offsetting the adverse impacts of tariff increases. These subsidies are in addition to the minimum \nlevel guarantees (MLG). \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                               Targeting Classification: Targeted Intervention-M7 T10 \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nThe poverty analysis is based on published statistical data, socioeconomic questionnaire survey of 1,000 households, \nfocus group discussion, and key informant interviews in the nine subcomponent areas of Hefei City during the project \npreparatory technical assistance. Unlike the rural poverty definition, no uniform standard for the urban poverty line \nexists in the PRC. In general, people under the MLG are defined as urban poor. The urban poor mostly consist of \npeople with no or low income, no or low capacity to work, no legal support, and/or no or low capability to work. People \nunder the MLG will receive MLG fund from Hefei Civil Affairs Bureau. In 2006, the MLG was CNY230 per capita per \nmonth. Of the direct and indirect beneficiary population, approximately 5.2% or 89,440 people of the total urban \npopulation live under the MLG. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nStakeholder analysis was conducted during the poverty and social assessment. The primary stakeholders of the \nProject are urban and rural residents, floating population, project affected persons, industries and businesses, the \nexecuting  agency,  and  implementing  agencies.  The  secondary  stakeholders  of  the  Project  include  relevant \ngovernment agencies, such as All Women\u2019s Federation, Civil Affairs Bureau, Poverty Reduction Office, Health Bureau, \netc.  A  participatory  rapid  appraisal  method  and  approach  were  employed  for  the  poverty  and  social  impact \nassessment\u2014such as stakeholder consultation workshops, focus group discussion, and key informant interviews\u2014to \ngain a better understanding of the demand, needs, and interests of the stakeholders, particularly groups that are \nnormally excluded from the decision making process. Two rounds of public consultations in the project areas were \ncarried out to prepare the environmental impact assessment (EIA) and the resettlement plans (RP). The public \nconsultations and information disclosure included: (i) introducing the project components to the stakeholders; (ii) \nsoliciting ideas, suggestions, comments, concerns, and critiques on the potential environmental implications of the \nProject; and (iii) presenting the findings of the EIA and RP, summarizing potential environmental impacts and \nmitigation measure, and providing answers raised by workshop participants. Public consultations and information \ndisclosure of resettlement plans were conducted during surveys, community meetings, interviews, and workshops. \nThe results of these meetings and concerns of the affected persons, particularly the poor and women, were integrated \ninto the RPs, which also describe the public consultation plan and grievance process. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nPublic consultation and participation have been the core elements of the project design, and will continue during the \nproject implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. Ongoing consultations will also be carried out by the implementing \nagencies to understand and meet the evolving needs and expectations of the users, as well as increase the \nawareness of the public, especially the beneficiaries, about the benefits of the Project. These also will encourage the \nactive involvement of local communities to maximize their support to the Project, promote environmental protection, \nand raise the social acceptance of tariff increase. Public consultations will be held during project implementation to \ndiscuss and obtain feedback on tariff adjustments and affordability for consumers and other key stakeholders, \nparticularly the poor. Existing participatory policies that rely on public hearings to gain approval for tariff adjustments \nwill be enforced to provide the mechanism for these consultations. The public consultation and participation will be \ncarried out throughout the EIA and environmental management plan implementation. The consultations, including a \ngrievance mechanism, will continue during land acquisition and resettlement to allow the problems and needs of \naffected persons to be addressed properly in a timely manner before project implementation. \n \n \n ", "46  Appendix 10 \nD.  Gender Development \n Strategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nData from the household survey and focus group discussion indicated that women are primarily responsible for \nwastewater disposal and management, cleanup after flooding, and care for the sick and elders. Time and efforts spent \non these activities will reduce the time for women to engage in income-generating activities, family entertainment, or \nleisure time. Lack of services for flood control, wastewater, and urban transport contribute to gender inequities in \nburden of household work. The poverty and social assessment indicated that women strongly support the Project. \nWomen have perceived that the Project will improve the urban living environment, create employment opportunities, \nand reduce the incidence of waterborne and respiratory diseases. To maximize the project benefits, women will be \nprioritized for employment and training opportunities generated from the Project\u2019s construction and operation phases. \nThe implementing agencies will adopt proactive employment programs for the women. More than 30% of the \nemployment opportunities will be filled by women and the poor during the project construction phase, and 25% during \nthe operation phase. \n \nHas an output been prepared?

Financial Sustainability of Revenue-Generating Subcomponents \n1.  The Hefei Wastewater Treatment Administrative Department (HWTAD) will implement the \nrevenue-generating  subcomponents  involving  wastewater  services,  i.e.,  the  two  wastewater \ntreatment  plants  (WWTPs)  and  the  sewer  network.  Projections  were  prepared  to  assess  the \nfinancial performance of HWTAD combined with wastewater financing responsibilities of the Hefei \nFinance  Bureau  (HFB).  Some  WWTP  operations  have  been  contracted  to  private  sector \ncompanies. HFB recovers the budgeted costs allocated to HWTAD, for the sewer piping system \nand for WWTP contract services, from wastewater tariff revenues collected on the water bill. The \namount allocated is about 80% of the CNY125 million in wastewater revenues (based on water \nsales data). \n \n2.  Financial  projections  were  prepared  until  2042,  but  the  assessment  of  financial \nperformance was based on a period of operations of 20 years following project commissioning \nwhich starts from 2009. The sustainability analysis treats wastewater operations as if they are \nmanaged by a single self-financing entity. Revenues in the analysis are based on water sales and \nthe wastewater tariff. The results of two options for the latter are shown: first with zero tariff \nincrease and second with an 83% tariff increase.  \n \n3.  Important features of the analysis include: \n \n(i)  All calculations based on an annual time step. \n(ii)  Use of standard accounting relationships to develop three basic statements. \n(iii)  Separate projection of \u201cwith project\u201d and \u201cwithout project\u201d relationships. \n(iv)  Opening values in the balance sheet estimated from available information of long-\nterm debt and assumptions regarding assets, other liabilities, and capital.  \n(v)  Project construction costs estimated from costs given in base year (2006) prices.  \n(vi)  Physical contingencies estimated as 10% of civil works and 5% of other costs.  \n(vii)  Price  contingencies  account  for  cumulative  cost  inflation  over  the  construction \nperiod. \n(viii)  Annual project operating costs estimated based on reported facility operating costs. \n(ix)  Recurrent costs for asset management based on the value of fixed assets. \n(x)  Depreciation \u2013 4.0% of original value of fixed assets. \n(xi)  Domestic and international inflation assumptions, from the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB): \nItem  2007  2008  2009  2010  2011  2012+ \nDomestic rate of price inflation (%/year)  3.0  3.2  2.7  2.8  2.0  1.2 \nForeign rate of price inflation (%/year)  2.8  1.2  1.2  1.2  1.2  1.2 \n          Sources:  Asian Development Bank estimates, Hefei municipal government estimates. \n(xii)  Wastewater revenues based on charges levied against water sales.

The \n10-year rate is used for debt servicing. A spread of 0.4% is added to these rates and 0.6% thereafter.  \nb The funding commitment letter from the Project Management Committee of the Hefei China Development Bank \nindicates that interest will be based on benchmark rates of the Central Bank. The indicated rate is based on \navailable information on these rates provided by Hefei Finance Bureau staff. \nc  The indicated rate is based on available information on Bond rates provided by Hefei Finance Bureau staff. \nSources:  Asian Development Bank estimates, Hefei municipal government estimates. \n \n4.  Financial data indicate the average operating ratio for the HWTAD is 1.0. This should \ncontinue since the HFB essentially provides sufficient funds from tariff revenues to cover HWTAD \noperating costs. The remainder is kept to cover capital costs. Most HWTAD operating costs are \ncontractual, however. Data indicate a rapid growth of operations over the past 3 year period due to \nincreases in WWTP capacity. Pipeline costs have fallen from 24% of total costs in 2003 to 10% in \n2005 (actual HWTAD administrative costs have similarly fallen to less than 1.6%). The wastewater \nsystem capital investments for 2003\u20132005 were CNY311 million, with 94% of the total expended \non treatment capacity. Project wastewater investments allocate 28% to pipelines, which will help \naddress the imbalance between transport and treatment capacity.  \n \n5.  Wastewater influent to existing WWTPs in Hefei is estimated to comprise 56% wastewater \ndischarged  by  customers  connected  to  the  sewers  and  44%  water  originating  from  rivers, \ngroundwater infiltration, and storm water runoff flows into the sewers. The actual wastewater share \nwill need to increase, or excess treatment capacity will be built. This should not be difficult if inflows \nfrom rivers are controlled. \n \n6.  In the base case sustainability analysis, the existing tariff was adjusted to keep pace with \ninflation, but was not increased otherwise. This assumed that changes in contract amounts owed \nto operators also would be inflation-based only. Costs based on revenues in 2005 were already \n5%\u201310% below costs based on unit costs, and the contract allows costs and revenues to increase \nevery two years. Hence, a more likely scenario is that costs and revenues both will increase. A \nwastewater tariff increase is being proposed by 2007. It is likely to be 50%, increasing the domestic \ntariff from CNY0.6 per cubic meter (m3) to CNY0.9 per m3. Hefei municipal government (HMG) \nrecognizes  that  further  increases  will  be  necessary.  To  allow  full  cost  recovery,  HMG  has \nsuggested an 83% increase from the current tariff to CNY1.1 per m3 in 2010. The results of this \nalternative also have been calculated. Since costs and revenues are likely to go up, the result \nshould be somewhere between the two alternatives. As at present, not all of the proceeds need be \ngiven to the WWTP, particularly if they are not funding their own debt. \n \n7.  Financial performance ratios (Table A11.1) for total wastewater operations indicate that the \nproject  subcomponents  are  financially  sustainable.  Estimated  operating  ratios,  returns  to  net \nassets, and profit margins are acceptable, given the base assumptions regarding tariffs and costs. \nOther  indicators  are  acceptable  except  for  the  debt-equity  ratio,  which  exceeds  the  ADB \nbenchmark level of 0.6 in the first 4 years after commissioning (only in the first year with the \nindicated tariff increase). The high initial debt-equity ratios reflect the financing strategy for recent \ncapital investments and the ADB-funded investment. By 2014, this ratio will be below 0.6. \n \n ", "    Appendix 11       49  \n   \nTable A11.1: Financial Ratios  \n(values for the first 20 years of operations) \n    No. of Tariff Increase  83% Tariff Increase \nPerformance Ratio  Target  Ave  Max  Min  Ave  Max  Min \nOperating Ratio  \n<1.0  0.54  0.62  0.50  0.31  0.36  0.27 \n(operating expenditures/operating revenues) \nRate of Profit  \n0.06  0.09  0.10  0.07  0.12  0.24  0.07 \n(net after tax earnings/net assets) \nProfit Margin  \nNot app.  0.36  0.46  0.21  0.69  0.82  0.55 \n(net after-tax earnings /operating revenues) \nCurrent Ratio  \n>1.0  22.6  46.0  5.0  71.6  147.4  11.3 \n(current assets/current liabilities) \nRatio of Debt to Equity  \n<0.6  0.40  1.22  0.03  0.19  0.78  0.01 \n(total long-term debt/net assets) \nDebt Service Coverage (cash to pay  \n>1.0  3.87  6.45  1.90  9.28  16.81  4.05 \ndebt service costs/debt service costs) \nSource:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n8.  The project financing plan indicates that tariff revenues will be used to provide financing of \nCNY96  million  during  loan  implementation.  The  pro  forma  analysis  suggests  that  more  than \nCNY140 million should be available for this purpose by 2010. If tariffs are increased, as proposed, \nthe amount would be more. \n \nB.  Financial Return Analysis of Revenue-Generating Components \n9.  Financial internal rates of return were estimated for the Shiwuli WWTP and Wangtang \nWWTP  subcomponents,  assuming  a  scenario  in  which  these  WWTPs  are  operated  as  self-\nfinancing entities that are financially independent of other parts of the wastewater system, but are \nrequired to pay their share of wastewater delivery costs. For this analysis, an 83% increase in the \nwastewater tariff by 2010 was assumed, as HMG agreed is feasible. The financial internal rate of \nreturn for each plant and the combined wastewater components is 4.3%, exceeding the weighted \naverage cost of capital (2.6%). Further, it is generally robust to all tested shocks.  \n \n10.  The financial analysis assumes that the 50,000 m3/day to be installed at Shiwuli WWTP \nunder the Project is extended later to its full 100,000 m3/day design capacity. This is in HWTAD\u2019s \nplan, and will be implemented when the 50,000 m3/day is reached. Demand exists at Shiwuli \nWWTP subcomponent for a full 100,000 m3/day plant. The Wangtang II WWTP includes 100,000 \nm3/day of new capacity. This is expected to provide excess capacity to meet the planned growth of \nthe Wangtang service area. HWTAD has committed to provide sewer piping as necessary. \n \n11.  The  long  run  financial  average  incremental  cost  per  m3  treated  of  the  WWTP \nsubcomponents are: Wangtang II (100,000 m3/day), CNY0.9; Shiwili (50,000 m3/day), CNY1.1; \naverage, CNY1.0. These include an allowance for the sewage system, and could be seen as a \nreasonable basis for an increased tariff. They can be compared with unit costs quoted by the \npresent WWTP varying from CNY0.50 to CNY0.75. Around 10% should be added for the sewage \nsystem plus interest on capital. \n \nC.  Financial Sustainability of Nonrevenue Components \n12.  Apart from three wastewater components, other components do not generate revenue.  \nThey involve public infrastructure managed by government departments with limited or no revenue-\ngenerating capacity. For these entities, the sustainability analysis is based on recent accounts of \nthe HMG. Project recurrent costs are compared with government recurrent revenues. Financial \n ", "50  Appendix 11 \nsustainability is demonstrated if the Project\u2019s incremental impact on recurrent costs is small. Table \nA11.2 summarizes debt servicing costs for the nonrevenue components of the Project. As shown, \noperating,  maintenance,  and  repair  costs  are  conservatively  estimated  to  be  CNY41  million. \nTherefore, recurrent costs, debt service, and operation and maintenance are CNY166 million. \n \n13.  Total  government  revenues  and  expenditures  are  in  Table  A11.3.  Revenues  and \nexpenditures have grown quickly in recent years for the Hefei and Xinzhan Zone governments. \nEstimated recurrent costs are compared with government revenues and expenditures in Table \nA10.4. For Hefei, recurrent costs represent a small portion of budget and total revenues and \nexpenditures, and are not expected to jeopardize government fiscal sustainability. The figures for \nXinzhan Zone are larger. Recurrent costs are about 7% of budget revenues and 4% of total \nrevenues. This represents a higher fiscal burden (5.5% compared with 1.1%), though one that is \nstill sustainable for this component, particularly if revenues continue to increase at recent rates. \n  \nTable A11.2: Recurrent Costs for Nonrevenue-Generating Components \nLocal bank  Enterprise \nItem  ADB Loan  Totals \nloan  Bond \nTotal Loan Amount (CNY \u2018000)  1,200,000  440,000  97,350  1,737,350 \nWastewater Component Loans (CNY \u2018000)  400,000  120,000  0  520,000 \nLoans for Components Funded out of Government Budgets (CNY \u2018000) \nHefei Municipal Government Components  512,000  320,000  97,350  929,350 \nXinzhan Zone Component  288,000  0  0  288,000 \nTotal  800,000  320,000  97,350  1,217,350 \nAnnual Debt Service Cost (CNY \u2018000/year)         \nHefei Municipal Government Components  44,241  43,478  12,607  100,326 \nXinzhan Zone Component  24,885  0  0  24,885 \nTotal  69,126  43,478  12,607  125,211 \nEstimated Operating and Maintenance Costsc (CNY \u2018000/year) \nHefei Municipal Government Componentsb        42,407 \nXinzhan Zone Componentc        15,848 \nTotal        40,733 \nADB = Asian Development Bank \na Estimated as rising to 3% of the original value of the investment for Hefei municipal government components.

Financial Management Assessment \n14.  Financial  management  assessments  were  completed  for  the  following  implementing \nagencies (IAs) and operating agencies: (i) Hefei Urban Construction Investment and Holding Co \nLtd, (ii) Hefei Municipal Government Drainage Office, (iii) HWTAD, (iv) Hefei  Xincheng State \nAssets  Operating  Company  Ltd,  and  (v)  Hefei  Chao  Lake  Ecological  and  Environmental \nImprovement Construction and Administrative Bureau. \n \n15.  In summary the assessments revealed the following: (i) all IAs operate as departments of \nmunicipal government; they are not autonomous; (ii) IAs do not have current experience with ADB \nfunded  projects  so  training  in  ADB  procedures  and  requirements  relating  to  procurement, \ndisbursement, financial reporting and monitoring as well as ADB anti-corruption policies will be \nrequired; (iii)  existing accounting and financial management systems of the IAs may require \nimprovement with respect to internal control, particularly to conflict of interest and anti-corruption \nsafeguards; and (iv) in other respects, systems are in place for financial reporting, accounting and \nauditing and appear to be fully developed and adequate for purposes of loan implementation. \nProject implementing systems will need to be integrated to ensure consistency and provide the \nproject management office with required management information. Towards the end of Project \nimplementation,  computerized  systems  should  be  reviewed  to  see  if  operating  hardware  and \nsoftware need to be upgraded. Further details on the financial analysis and financial management \nassessments are found in Supplementary Appendixes J and K respectively. \n \n ", "52  Appendix 12 \nAFFORDABILITY ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Introduction \n1.  Appendix 12 documents the affordability analysis for the Project, which was undertaken to \nevaluate how increases in wastewater tariffs will impact poor households. However, the effects on \nthe  average  income  group  also  are  shown.  The  scope  of  the  analysis  encompasses  urban \nhouseholds that receive wastewater services from the local governments. The analysis considers \nthe wastewater tariff, but not any other fees or taxes that might be used to finance the project \ncomponents.  The following sections of this appendix (i) define the poverty levels that are used in \nthe analysis, (ii) provide a profile of the expenditures of poor households, (iii) review poverty \nreduction policies of local governments, (iv) evaluate impacts of increased wastewater tariffs, and \n(v)  recommend  measures  to  reduce  the  impacts  of  increased  wastewater  tariffs  on  poor \nhouseholds. \n \nB.  Poverty Levels \n2.  The analysis of poverty considers two poverty lines: one representing absolute poverty and \na  second  representing  relative  poverty.  The  absolute  poverty  line  is  based  on  household \nrequirements for basic food and non-food expenditures. Measures of relative poverty include the \nadditional income needed to pay for social obligations such as funerals and weddings. Published \npoverty lines that are assumed to correspond to absolute and relative poverty are provided in \nTable A12.1.  \n \nTable A12.1: Urban Poverty Lines for the People\u2019s Republic of Chinaa \nItem  Per Capita per Year  Per Capita per Month \nPoverty Lines Assumed to Represent Absolute Poverty \nNational Bureau of Statistics, 2000b  1,875  156 \nMay 2000 Poverty Conferenceb     \nInland cities  1,300  108 \nCoastal cities  1,950  163 \nPoverty Lines Assumed to Represent Relative Poverty \nOfficial municipal poverty lines, 35 major cities, 1998c \nAverage  2,365  197 \nMinimum (Nanchang)  1,720  143 \nMaximum (Shenzhen)  3,828  319 \nHefei (2006)  2,760  230 \na Source: Asian Development Bank, May 2004.

Summary statistics for income and expenditures of low-income households are provided in \nTable A12.2. Reported income and expenditure levels for the lowest 5% of households in Table \nA12.2 are comparable to the absolute and relative poverty levels in Table A12.1 and to the Hefei \nofficial poverty threshold of CNY230 per person per month.

Expenditure  patterns  show  that  low-income \nhouseholds spend proportionately more on food and utilities, and less on more discretionary \nexpenditure categories such as recreation. Expenditures on essentials represent 79% or more of \nthe total expenditures of poor households. The data indicate expenditures on total utilities that \nexceed 10% of consumption expenditures for the poorest households, and about 6% for average \nhouseholds. \n \nTable A12.3: Household Income and Expenditures (CNY per capita per month) \nIncome Class  Lowest Income \u2013 First Decile  Low Income \u2013  Average \n  Lower 5%  Upper 5%  Second Decile  Income \nTotal income - per capita annual  217.1  314.6  377.3  653.8 \nDisposable income  205.2  294.5  355.4  626.0 \nTotal expenditures  229.1  397.3  412.8  653.8 \nConsumption expenditure  198.7  288.1  309.9  475.9 \n   1. food  116.5  143.6  161.6  209.1 \n   2. clothing  14.3  21.3  30.8  53.2 \n   3. household facilities, articles, and services  3.5  11.9  10.3  21.4 \n   4. medical and health expenditures  8.8  13.4  15.0  33.0 \n   5. transportation and communication   12.8  20.1  26.5  47.1 \n   6. recreation, education, and cultural  13.6  28.7  29.5  52.0 \n - education component of item 6  10.1  22.5  21.9  30.3 \n   7. housing  23.0  44.0  27.9  44.5 \n - water, electricity, fuel, others component of 7  21.2  19.9  23.8  30.6 \nOther living expenditures  6.2  5.1  8.3  15.7 \nEssentialsa  174.9  228.7  244.2  337.4 \na Food, clothing, housing, and utilities. \nSource: Anhui Statistical Yearbook 2005, China Statistics Press. \n \nTable A12.4: Expenditure Distribution of Poor Households* (CNY per capita per month) \nIncome Class  Lowest income \u2013 First Decile  Low Income \u2013  Average \n  Lower 5%  Upper 5%  Second Decile  Income \nConsumption expenditure  100.0%  100.0%  100.0%  100.0% \n1.

Water Consumption \n5.  Data provided by the Hefei Water Supply Company (HWSC) indicate that average per \ncapita  domestic  water  use  is  170  litres  per  capita  per  day  (lpcd)  based  on  the  registered \npopulation. The consumption could be as low as 121 lpcd if the entire unregistered or floating \npopulation were serviced by the HWSC and received a water bill. The actual consumption rate \nlikely lies somewhere between these two amounts, since only a portion of the floating population \nwill be serviced through a water meter identified as a domestic service. Circumstances of persons \nin the floating population who are not serviced by a domestic meter include (i) persons living \n\u201crough\u201d or the homeless, (ii) workers in construction camps at building sites, (iii) other workers \nliving on the premises of their workplace, and (iv) persons in un-serviced housing (suburban areas \nor informal housing). Data is not available to determine the actual consumption rate of persons \nserviced through a domestic meter and paying a water bill. A rate of 150 lpcd is assumed for this \nanalysis. \n \n6.  Domestic water consumption is known to increase in response to increasing income levels \nand to fall in response to increasing tariffs. Elasticities are parameters used by economists to \nmeasure these responses. The following elasticities are assumed for this analysis: \n \n(i)  Price elasticity of domestic water demand = \u20130.33. \n(ii)  Income elasticity of domestic water demand = 0.30. \n \nE.  Local Government Poverty-Reduction Policies \n7.  The primary program supporting registered poor families is a basic subsidy, called the \nminimum living guarantee, designed to maintain a minimum level of income. Registered families \nwith incomes below the official poverty line receive help under this program. Subsidies are meant \nto cover all expenses, including the water bill. The size of this security payment makes up the \ndifference between the poverty line and the actual income of the household. The official poverty \nline in Hefei is CNY230 per person per month. \n \n8.  Some cities in the People\u2019s Republic of China offer other poverty-reduction programs in \naddition to the minimum living guarantee. In Hefei, registered households below the official poverty \nline receive the first 4 cubic meters (m3) of water consumed per month at no charge. The cost of \nthis program to HWSC is offset by a subsidy from the government.1 \n \nF.  Tariff Impacts on Poor Households \n9.  The Project might require wastewater tariffs to increase. Hefei municipal government plans \nto increase the wastewater tariff by 50% to CNY0.9 per m3 in 2007 and possibly to CNY1.1 per m3 \nby 2010. The tariff increases will achieve full cost recovery, comply with state government policy on \nthe wastewater tariff, and likely account for funding requirements that go beyond project financing \nneeds. \n \n10.  Estimates were made of monthly household water use, the resulting household water and \nwastewater bill for low-income households, average household subsidy based on household size \ninformation from the Anhui statistical yearbook, and water demand assumptions (Table A12.5). \nThe 50% tariff increase is used in this analysis as a base, though the effects of an 83% increase to \nCNY 1.1 per m3 also are shown. \n \n11.  Based on the analysis summarized in Table A12.5, households would appear to be able to \nafford the tariff increase, even if they are in the lowest income class receiving no water subsidy \n                                                 \n1  In 2006, 5.2% of the urban population in Hefei had incomes below the official poverty line associated with the MLG. \n ", "    Appendix 12       55  \n   \nbecause they are not registered. With the high 83% tariff increase, the share of that group\u2019s \nincome expended for the service is 3.9%, which is below the 5% benchmark assumed for water \nand wastewater together.   \n \nG.  Mitigation of Tariff Impacts \n12.  Poor households have little scope for absorbing even small tariff increases, given their \ncurrent allocation of expenditures. Low-income households experiencing the most extreme poverty \nare the most likely to be adversely affected by the tariff increase. Factors contributing to extreme \npoverty include elevated health care costs associated with poor health of a household member, \nand single-person households that preclude sharing common costs among several persons. Such \nhouseholds might require additional support if their water bill increases. The main policies used to \nsupport poor households facing increasing tariffs are lifeline tariffs, water bill discounts, and direct \nsubsidies. As the lifeline tariff is a poorly targeted policy that benefits all households, not just those \nneeding support, it is not recommended. The existing water bill discount is a much better poverty-\nreduction measure, because it can be targeted properly at poor households. Consideration could \nbe given to extending it to non-registered households. \n \nTable A12.5: Affordability Analysis Based on Official Poverty Lines \nItem  Lowest Income \u2013 First Decile   Low Income \u2013  Average \n  Lower 5%  Upper 5%  Second Decile  Income \nHousehold size  3.5  3.3  3.3  3.0 \nMonthly disposable income         \nPer capita  205.2  294.5  355.4  626.0 \nPer household  712.0  1,021.9  1,186.9  1,846.6 \nWater use (tons/mo)         \nExisting   11.4  12.0  12.7  13.7 \nWith Project   10.9  11.5  12.2  13.1 \nWater and wastewater tariff         \nExisting   1.80  1.80  1.80  1.80 \nWith Project   2.06  2.06  2.06  2.06 \n% increase  14.2  14.2  14.2  14.2 \nWater and wastewater bill, no subsidy         \nExisting   20.6  21.6  22.9  24.6 \nWith Project   22.5  23.6  25.0  26.9 \n% increase  9.3  9.3  9.3  9.3 \nWater and wastewater bill, subsidy         \nExisting   13.4  21.6  22.9  24.6 \nWith Project   14.3  23.6  25.0  26.9 \n% increase  6.7  9.3  9.3  9.3 \nIncome share of the Water and wastewater bill  \n(50% tariff increase)     \nNo subsidy  3.2%  2.3%  2.1%  1.5% \nSubsidy  2.0%  2.3%  2.1%  1.5% \nIncome share of the Water and wastewater bill  \n(83% tariff increase)     \nNo subsidy  3.9%  2.8%  2.6%  1.8% \nSubsidy  2.4%  2.8%  2.6%  1.8% \nSources: World Bank.

The economic analysis covers the Project as a whole and the individual subcomponents.  \nFor the Project as a whole, the analysis covers (i) the overall economic rationale, (ii) the rationale \nfor public intervention, (iii) the goals of the investment plan, (iv) the general design of the plan, and \n(v)  the  overall  economic  benefit  to  be  expected.  The  economic  analysis  also  evaluates  the \nindividual subcomponents for least costs and economic internal rate of return (EIRR). Economic \nanalysis was conducted in accordance with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s Guidelines for the \nEconomic Analysis of Projects and Economic Analysis Retrospective 2005: Strengthening ADB\u2019s \nAid Effectiveness. \n \nB.  Analysis of the Project \n1.  Rationale for the Project \n2.  The primary motivation for the investment plan is the increasing concern over the effects of \neconomic growth on environmental quality in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). Continuing \nurbanization has resulted in water and air pollution, and in the potential for increasing water \nshortages. Surface, groundwater, and air pollution pose risks for public health and the environment \nin general.  Pollution also is starting to constrain national and local development.  \n \n3.  Hefei City urban population increased by a third during the last 5-year plan, and real per \ncapita gross domestic product doubled in each of the last two plan periods. The same growth is \nforecast in the 11th Five-Year Program (2006\u20132010), and is also expected for the period starting \n2010. The urban part of the city lies along the Nanfei River. The Nanfei runs into Chao Lake, which \nis a source for the Yangtze River. The waters of the Nanfei and Chao Lake are polluted and \nclassified as suitable only for agriculture and landscaping. A potential major urban recreational and \nenvironmental benefit is all but unused. The Project contains subcomponents that will affect water \npollution directly by cleaning rivers and treating wastewater. While urban growth in many PRC \ncities has led to serious air pollution, Hefei has not experienced that. However, further urban \ngrowth is expected to lead to problems unless they are controlled early. An important part of the \nProject\u2019s urban road infrastructure subcomponent will be traffic management to control congestion, \naccidents, and pollution. \n \n4.  Another major outcome of the Project is flood control. Economic problems from floods have \nalways existed, and Hefei has been nearly inundated on several occasions in the past. The city \nhas major flood control investments, and the Nanfei is now controlled to a 1-in-100 year flooding \nfrequency throughout urban Hefei. The latest step, included in the Project, is to decrease flooding \nto a 1-in-100 year frequency in the three major tributary rivers of the Nanfei, which run into or \nthrough urban areas, and to between 1-in-20 and 1-in-40 in the parts of more rural Hefei that \nborder Chao Lake.  \n \n2.  Rationale for Public Intervention \n5.  The serious problems with pollution and flooding demonstrate that private sector responses \nalone  are  inadequate.  Generators  of  wastewater  have  the  incentive  only  to  convey  their \nwastewater far enough downstream to avoid polluting themselves. They do not have any economic \nincentive to treat the wastewater at the point of discharge. Vehicle drivers around the world do not \nrealize that the air pollution they cause affects them directly and has a cost to themselves and \n ", "    Appendix 13       57  \n   \nothers. While the private sector is the victim of flooding, the causes are normally too far away or \ntoo large for the sector to be able to deal with economically. \n \n6.  The  investment  plan  involves  government  intervention  at  several  different  levels.  The \ncentral Government has prepared a national level environmental protection plan for Chao Lake. \nThe Anhui provincial government has prepared a Chao Lake flood control plan, which has led to \naction by Hefei, one of the two regional level governments that front the lake. Municipal and county \ngovernments,  particularly  Hefei,  are  making  individual  investments  in  the  flood  control,  river \ncleanup,  and  wastewater  treatment  works.  They  will  be  involved  in  managing  the  completed \nfacilities.  \n \n7.  Government involvement is sound at each level. Government has a role in controlling \nexternalities from discharges of untreated wastewater, coordinating the management of surface \nwater quality, and controlling floodwater. Government involvement in individual projects is justified \nsince urban flood and water quality control, wastewater management, and urban roads are natural \nmonopolies. The local government is adopting various strategies to manage these projects and \nutilities.  Where  output  cannot  be  sold  reasonably,  local  government  departments  will  be  the \nmanagers and maintainers. Local governments will own revenue-earning utilities, which will be \nmanaged as independent public enterprises. Contracting out operations and maintenance of the \nwastewater treatment plants (WWTP) to the private sector is encouraged.  \n \n2.  Goals of the Investment Plan \n8.  The plan has general and specific goals. The general plans for economic growth and \ndevelopment, at the level of Hefei municipal government (HMG), Anhui Province, and PRC as a \nwhole,  provide  the  basis  or  context  for  the  goals  specific  to  the  investment  plan.  The  plan \nrecognizes  that  achieving  these  goals  will  require  protecting,  improving,  and  maintaining \nenvironmental quality, particularly surface water and air quality. \n \n9.  The goals most relevant to the investment plan come from the 11th Hefei Environmental \nPlan. Key features are goals for surface water. These are based on five main classifications, set \naccording to the intended use of the water. The State Environmental Protection Administration sets \nthe  water  quality  goals  for  some  key,  strategic  river  reaches.  More  generally,  the  relevant \nenvironmental protection department at a county, municipal, or provincial level sets the local water \nquality goal. In Hefei urban areas, the goal is limited only to increasing surface water quality so that \n100% meets Class V. The city\u2019s drinking water does not come from the Nanfei, but upstream from \nthe Dafangyin and Dongpu reservoirs. Even those are not yet suitable to be centralized drinking \nwater  sources  as  they  can  contain  too  much  nitrogen  and  phosphorous.  The  plan  aims  to \nstrengthen source protection to ensure water of at least Class II in the reservoirs. Air quality in \nHefei is reasonable. Sulfur dioxideand nitrogen dioxideare Class I, while particulate matter (PM ) \n    10\nis between Class I and Class II. The plan aims to at least maintain that quality as the city grows.  \n \n4.  Design of the Plan \n10.  A unique, least-cost way to achieve all project goals rarely can be found, and any plan that \nsatisfies  those  goals  at  minimum  cost  is  acceptable  in  principle.  Standard  economic  theory \nprovides  a  least-cost  plan,  based  on  economic  incentives,  for  revenue-earning  activities.  For \nwastewater  management,  this  plan  depends  on  a  centralized  system,  including  sewers  and \ntreatment plants. All point-sources should be connected to the sewer system, and the sewers \nshould discharge to treatment plants. The Project will be an important source of assistance in \nhelping the Hefei plan meet that condition.  \n ", "58  Appendix 13 \n11.  The other components of the Project do not earn revenue. In these cases, social choice \ntechniques must be used to help design the plan. Such techniques include benefit-cost analysis, \nthe  results  of  which  are  discussed  in  Section  C.3.  Another  important  element  promotes  the \nimportance  of  projects  that  will  assist  the  poor.  Poverty-related  subcomponent  effects  are \ndiscussed in Appendix 12 and are summarized in Table A13.1. \n \nTable A13.1: Review of Project Effects on the Poor \nProject Component  Project Effects \nIntegrated Treatment  These subcomponents will provide flood control, drainage, and sewerage. They also \nwill provide riverside access and recreational areas, which are expected to be free. \nThe poor will gain. \n- Ershibu River   This subcomponent is in a relatively poor inner city area, which will maximize its \npoverty-related benefits. \n- Banqiao River   The benefits of this subcomponent will grow as migrants move in to take jobs in the \nnewly developed Xinzhan Zone. \n- Sili River   The recreational facilities are more upscale. Being closer to the city center, the area \nwill be ripe for gentrification. The poor will gain if land and property sales are not \nrestricted. \nChao Lake Flooding  Poor farmers will be major beneficiaries. \nWastewater Sewers and  The rich can protect themselves from the harmful effects of uncollected and untreated \nTreatment   sewage. As the poor cannot, they will gain the most. \n- Shiwuli WWTP  This will also control the quality of water possibly used by WTP No. 4. \n- Wangtang II WWTP  As above. \n- Hefei Sewer Network   As above. \nQingxi Road Landfill Site  The subcomponent will control seepage of dangerous leachates into the Nanfei \nRiver, which runs through the city to Chao Lake. The poor are the most likely users of \nriver and lake water. \nXinzhan Zone Project  Transport links will allow the development of new industry and provide jobs for poor \nimmigrants. Harmful side effects (pollution and congestion) will be controlled. \nWTP = water treatment plant, WWTP = wastewater treatment plant. \n \n12.  Other relevant elements of social choice relate to the means to ensure that decisions taken \nhave the support of the people in whose name the decisions are made. The project preparatory \ntechnical assistance household survey asked for opinions on various government services. Highest \npriorities were education and health, followed by wastewater, and flood and storm water control. \nWhen high as well as highest priority was included, roads and public transport also had more than \n90% support. \n \nC.  Analysis of Individual Subcomponents \n1.  Least-Cost Analysis of Individual Subcomponents \n13.  The least-cost analysis ensures that each subcomponent is designed optimally to meet the \ngoals of the Project. The least-cost analysis should cover all feasible alternatives for a given \nsubcomponent, including variations in location, timing, technology, and content. Ideally, least-cost \nanalysis also would cover the planning horizon or capacity of the plant, though capacity often is \nconstrained by other factors.  \n \n14.  In summary, the only real questions that remain relate to the timing of demand for (i) the \nWangtang II WWTP, (ii) some of the recreational facilities included in the integrated river treatment \nsubcomponents, and (iii) the northern part of the Xinzhan Zone road subcomponent. These are all \ndemand-related questions and are discussed in Section C.2. Otherwise, the results of the analysis \nconfirm that the preferred options given for the subcomponents are least-cost.  \n \n ", "    Appendix 13       59  \n   \n2.   Demand for Subcomponents \n15.  The  subcomponents  whose  output  will  be  sold  are  in  the  wastewater  sector,  the  two \nWWTPs,  and  the  sewerage  network.  Following  past  practice  in  Hefei,  revenues  for  these \ncomponents will be determined by costs, and will be paid from wastewater tariffs collected from all \npiped water consumers as part of their water tariff bill. Demand for the subcomponents will depend \non wastewater output in their supply areas, as well as the ability of the collection system to move \nthat wastewater to the WWTP. In the case of the Shiwuli WWTP, forecast output is more than five \ntimes treatment capacity. As such, full usage of the plant should pose no difficulties, even if it is \nextended to the full 100,000 cubic meter per day (m3/day) capacity. For Wangtang (I and II), \nhowever, forecast capacity is about equal to forecast wastewater output. Collecting all this output \nwill be difficult, and it is uncertain that the budget for the collection system is sufficient. In addition, \nthe wastewater forecasts rely on new and planned developments in several areas. While these \ndevelopments are included in the 11th Hefei Environmental Plan, that plan was drafted before \nrecent changes in national policy were introduced. These changes will (i) move national emphasis \nfrom urban back to a more balanced urban and rural policy, (ii) instruct local planners to restrain \ngrowth if that is necessary to sustain the environment, and (iii) evaluate them accordingly. These \nevaluations are important. Taken together, the changes raise some doubt about the need for the \ncapacity planned immediately for the Wangtang II WWTP. One possibility would be to keep in the \nloan sufficient funds for an additional 100,000 m3/day of treatment plant capacity, as requested by \nthe Government. However, this could be split into in 50,000 m3/day segments. Decisions could be \nmade later in the Project on the needs to expand Shiwuli or Wangtang II WWTPs to include the \nsecond 50,000 m3/day. \n \n16.  The river cleanup subcomponents contain large sums for amenities. These are in line with \nthe past policy of HMG to provide extensive green areas. While the basic ideas are good, the plans \nmight be too elaborate. Thus, HMG might wish to review the design and early implementation of \nthese expenditures. \n \n17.  The only other subcomponent for which demand will be relevant is the Xinzhan Zone road \ninfrastructure. The city is expanding and the location of the local railway system means that the \nXinzhan Zone area, which is adjacent to the railway station is an obvious place to direct that \ngrowth. Roads are needed to develop an area. In view of recent changes in national policy, the \nfuture growth of all PRC cities must raise some doubts. These might be reasons to slow the \nimplementation of the more northerly parts of the zone until demand in the south is verified. \n \n3.  Assessment of Individual Subcomponents \n18.  In addition to being least-cost, each subcomponent should be economically justified. The \nfirst standard for judging a subcomponent is with respect to the project goals. Any subcomponent \nthat is least-cost and is identified as an integral component of the Project might be considered \njustified. All subcomponents are integral to the Project. Applying standard benefit-cost analysis can \nstrengthen the economic justification of individual subcomponents. This confirmation is useful since \nit allows the main economic parameters to be derived for the individual subcomponents.  \n \n19.  The types of benefits of different social service subcomponents vary. They can be difficult \nto quantify, and ensuring no double counting within and across benefits also can be difficult. These \ndifficulties  can  be  minimized  through  estimates  for  likely  land  value  increases  since  all \nsubcomponents will contribute to the urban development of Hefei. The total affected area, 101 \nsquare kilometers, is 17% of the area of Hefei urban districts, which is another indication of the \nimportance of the Project. The areas affected by individual subcomponents do not overlap and the \n ", "60  Appendix 13 \n\u201cwith project\u201d and \u201cwithout project\u201d land values used were backed by auction data. Benefits were \nassumed to grow over a lengthy delay period. Assumed increases also were compared with the \nincreases required to give an EIRR of 12%. In the case of Chao Lake, land value benefits are \nsignificant (58% of benefits) but are not sufficient. They have been supplemented by shore erosion \n(32%), amenity (7%), and net tourist income (3%) benefits.  \n \n20.  The  EIRRs  for  the  representative  subcomponents  range  from  21%  to  36%  for  the \nwastewater management projects, and from 13% to 33% for the other subcomponents. Overall, the \nEIRR is about 27%. The results and assumptions for subcomponents are in Table A13.2. While the \nland  value  increases  assumed  might  seem  high,  experience  elsewhere  has  shown  that  the \ndifference between the values of land liable and not liable to flooding can be a factor of four. On \naverage, 10 years delay in reaching the estimated increase is assumed. The average increase \nrequired to produce an EIRR of 12% is 22%. \n \n21.  Details of the sensitivity analysis (Supplementary Appendix L) indicate that the results are \nrobust. Only the Qingxi landfill and Chao Lake have EIRRs below 12% when all benefits are \ndelayed for the full period shown. The proposed investments are considered economically sound \nand justified. \n \nTable A13.2: Economic Results by Subcomponent \nSubcomponent   Base  Base  BCR  Land Value Increase  Delay  Sensitivity \n   NPV  EIRR    Assumed  Required  Years  EIRR \nShiwuli WWTP  452   27.8%  2.7  66%  14%  10.0   15.6% \nWangtang II WWTP  186   20.9%  1.6  49%  23%  5.0   15.3% \nHefei Sewer Network  825   35.8%  4.5  41%  4%  15.0   15.4% \nWastewater  1,463   28.7%  2.8  48%  9%  12.5   15.4% \nQingxi Road Landfill  7   12.7%  1.0  66%  50%  4.7   9.7% \nErshibu River  614   24.9%  2.2  60%  16%  9.7   13.4% \nBanqiao River  840   32.7%  3.6  66%  8%  14.5   14.1% \nSili River  306   24.5%  1.9  50%  20%  4.7   16.0% \nChao Lake  26   13.4%  1.1  103%  na  5.0   9.4% \nRiver/Lake  1,785   25.1%  2.2  59%  16%  10.7   13.6% \nXinzhan Zone  3,441   27.5%  2.2  136%  45%  5.0   19.5% \nHUEIP Project  6,696   26.7%  2.3  75%  22%  9.8   16.9% \nBCR = benefit-cost ratio, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, HUEIP = Hefei Urban Environment Improvement \nProject, NPV = net present value, WWTP = wastewater treatment plant. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20070425141430+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20070403112825+08'00'", "Title": "Anhui Hefei Urban Environment Improvement Project", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Author": "", "Keywords": "water resources, wastewater facilities sewer networks, vehicular emissions road network, river rehabilitation flood control", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 7.0.5 (Windows)"}, "author_page": " \n \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The fiscal year (FY) of Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China ends on 31 \nDecember. \n(ii)  In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nVice President  C.
