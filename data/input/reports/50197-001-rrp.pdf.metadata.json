Bangladesh  is  the  world\u2019s  second  largest  exporter  of \ntextiles  and  garments,  and  this  industry  accounted  for  82%  of  the  country\u2019s  total  merchandise \nexports  in  FY2015,3 generating  export  earnings  of  $24  billion.  It  accounted  for  about  15%  of \ngross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in  FY2014.4 The  textile  and  garment  sector  employs  4  million \nworkers,  of  whom  almost  85%  are  women. 5 In  2013,  after  a  2012  factory  fire  and  a  2013 \nbuilding collapse in Bangladesh had killed more than 1,000 ready-made garment (RMG) factory \nworkers  and  injured  thousands  more,  the  Bangladesh  government,  the  European  Union,  the \nUnited States, and the International Labor Organization (ILO) engaged in a joint initiative called \nBangladesh  Sustainable  Compact  to  promote  continuous  improvements  in  labour  rights  and \nfactory  safety.  A  2015  study  by  the  European  Commission  found  that  Bangladesh  had  made \nmuch  progress  since  the  start  of  the  joint  initiative  in  protecting  labor  rights  and  improving \nbuilding and workplace safety.6 \n \n3. \nBangladesh and international businesses involved in the textile and garment trade have \nundertaken  innovative  initiatives  and  made  a  positive  difference  in  the  area  of  building  and \nworker  safety.  This  has  been  achieved  under  the  2013  Accord  on  Fire  and  Building  Safety  in \nBangladesh  and  the  2013  Alliance  for  Bangladesh  Worker  Safety.  The  accord  is  a  legally \nbinding agreement covering 2013-2018 and signed by more than 200 apparel corporations from \n20 countries, two global trade unions, and many Bangladesh trade unions. The alliance covers \nthe  same  period  and  was  founded  by  a  group  of  North  American  apparel  companies.  The \naccord  and  the  alliance  have  engaged  qualified  consultants  to  inspect  RMG  factories  for  fire, \nelectrical,  and  structural  safety.  As  of  March  2016,  2,197  factories  had  been  inspected,  or \n95.4% of the factories covered under the two agreements as suppliers to accord and/or alliance \ncompany  signatories.7 A  factory\u2019s  first  inspection  produces  a  corrective  action  plan  (CAP)  for \nremedial  safety  changes  that  are  to  be  taken  within  prescribed  time  limits.  The  staff  of  the \naccord and alliance themselves conduct the follow-up inspections to ensure that the CAPs are \nimplemented  according  to  schedule.  The  accord  and  the  alliance  provide  capacity  building \nthrough  health  and  fire  and  general  safety  training  for  workers,  the  formation  of  occupational \nsafety and health committees of worker representatives and management at factories covered \nby their agreements, and the establishment of mechanisms to monitor the health and safety on \n\n                                                \n1   ADB. 2015.

Manila \n2  Sustainable projects refer to the construction or expansion of textile and garment factories that after completion will \nmeet the high structural, fire, and electrical safety standards required by the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in \nBangladesh  or  the  Alliance  for  Bangladesh  Worker  Safety.  All  subborrowers  will  be  required  to  consider  energy \nefficiency and be encouraged to select energy efficient design and equipment for the subprojects. \n \n\n3  ADB. 2016.

The two organizations have set up help lines to enable factory workers to report \nsafety and health concerns confidentially. This bottom\u2013up, participatory approach is expected to \nbecome a key element of the RMG factory safety program in the future.  \n \n4. \nThe  ILO\u2019s  international training  center  and  the  Bangladesh  department  of  inspection  of \nfactories  and  establishments  have  trained  all  the  government\u2019s  labor  inspectors  on  how  to \ninspect  working  conditions,  occupational  safety  and  health  matters,  hazard  identification,  risk \nassessment, and the investigation of work accidents. The ILO is responsible for managing the \nsafety inspection of export-oriented factories that are not covered by the accord and the alliance \nas  suppliers.  As  of  16  March  2016,  1,549  of  these  factories,  which  fall  under  a  government \nnational action plan, had been inspected. Most of the inspections have been done by the private \nsector inspection companies previously engaged for the accord and the alliance programs. The \nILO  plans  to  oversee  the  inspection  and  safety  remediation  of  export-oriented  RMG  factories \nuntil  2021  when  the  government  is  expected  to  be  ready  to  take  over  after  years  of  capacity \nbuilding.8  \n \n5. \nThe attention to safety matters given under the accord and alliance program has set the \nstandard for  RMG  sector  worker  safety  in  Bangladesh.  Domestic  entrepreneurs  are  starting to \nsee  that  making  their  facilities  compliant  with  the  accord  and  alliance  standards  provides  a \ncompetitive advantage that is worth the investment. RMG manufacturing facilities determined to \nbe compliant are gaining market share as export demand shifts toward such factories. This has \ncreated greater demand for the long-term financing for the construction and expansion of RMG \nfactories  that  will  comply  with  accord  and  alliance  standards  after  completion.  The  domestic \nbanks in Bangladesh\u2019s undeveloped finance sector struggle to provide this long-term finance at \ncompetitive interest rates.  \n \n6. \nFinance  sector.  Total  credit  represented  only  59.7%  of  GDP  in  FY2015,  and  credit  to \nthe private sector accounted for 43.9%.9 Banks dominate the finance sector and accounted for \n89.8% of the private sector credit. Asset quality in the banking sector is weak. The sector\u2019s year-\nend  nonperforming  loans  ratio  was  9.7%  in  2014  and  8.8%  in  2015.  Domestic  banks  have no \naccess  to  international  capital  markets.  Long-term  US  dollar  funding  is  available  to  them \nprimarily through international financial institutions.10 \n  \n7. \nTo support continued improvements in the important textile and garment sector and help \nfill  financing gaps  in  the  Bangladesh  finance  market,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has \nsought  to  partner  with  domestic  financial  institutions  that  have  demonstrated  the  ability  to \nfinance  RMG  sector  development.  In  this  regard,  ADB  approved  a  $30  million  loan  facility  for \nBRAC Bank in 2015.11 ADB consulted Eastern Bank about participating in a possible follow-up \nproject.  Eastern  Bank  was  one  of  the  first  banks  in  Bangladesh  to  join  ADB\u2019s  Trade  Finance \nProgram  and  has  been  an  active  member  since  2006.  The  bank  is  committed  to  support  the \ndevelopment of socially and environmentally sustainable projects. It has a good track record of \n\n                                                \n8  The ILO may assume responsibility for inspecting factories supplying to accord and alliance members at the end of \nthe two organizations\u2019 operations commitment period of 2013\u20132018, although both organizations have left open the \npossibility of extensions. \n\n9  Bangladesh Bank. 2016.

Eastern Bank was given a \n$10  million  credit  facility  by  the  International  Finance  Corporation  (IFC)  to  finance  the \nimplementation  of  CAPs  prescribed  after  accord  and  alliance  inspections  at  RMG  factories  in \nthe  country.12 [The  rest  of  this  paragraph  has  been  redacted  due  to  commercially  sensitive \ninformation.] \n \nB. \n \n8. \nEastern  Bank  is  a  leading  private  commercial  bank.  It  was  established  in  1992  and  is \nlisted on the Dhaka and Chittagong stock exchanges. It is one of the most innovative banks in \nthe  country  and  the  first  to  provide  online  banking  services,  green  loans,  US  dollar  financing \nthrough  letters  of  credit,  and  aviation  finance.  In  2015,  it  was  named  the\u201d  best  retail  bank\u201d  in \nBangladesh by The Asian Banker, a provider of strategic intelligence finance in the Asian region. \n[This  sentence  has  been  redacted  due  to  commercially  sensitive  information.]  As  of  31 \nDecember 2015, Eastern Bank had one of the largest private commercial bank branch networks \nin the country\u2014224 outlets overall, consisting of 80 full service branches, 57 small and medium-\nsized  enterprise  (SME)  centers,  72  bill  paying  centers,  and  15  priority  banking  centers.  The \noutlets are spread throughout Bangladesh but are concentrated in the major cities of Dhaka and \nChittagong. \n \n9. \nEastern  Bank  is  primarily  a  corporate  bank.  Corporate  loans  represented  72.1%  of  the \ngross  loan  portfolio  at  the  end  of  2015  and  72.7%  a  year  earlier.  Eastern  Bank  considers \ncorporate  banking  to  be  an  important  strength  and  competitive  advantage.  The  bank\u2019s  active \ntrade  finance  and  foreign  currency  lending  operations  help  attract  corporate  clients.  Foreign \ncurrency loans provided by its overseas banking unit accounted for about 18.4% of its corporate \nlending  at  the  end  of  2015.  The  bank\u2019s  SME  portfolio  accounted  for  14.5%  of  year-end  total \nlending in 2015, slightly down from 15.2% the year before. Comprising 12.4% of overall lending \nwhen 2015 ended, its retail banking business is small but competitive and offers a wide variety \nof deposit, loan, and card products. \n \nC. \n \n10. \nOwnership.  The  shareholders  with  board  representation  hold  a  combined  stake  of \n31.6%. The largest stake of 10% is held by Namreen Enterprises, a shipping company, followed \nby  Mir  Holdings  (5.0%)  and  Borak  Real  Estate  (4.8%).  Other  main  shareholders  with  board \nrepresentation include the board chairperson, M. Ghaziul Haque, who has a combined stake of \n5.2%  with  his  MGH  Group,  a  conglomerate  with  interests  in  shipping,  retail,  and  media.

The proceeds will be used to finance socially and environmentally sustainable projects \nin  the  textile  and  garment  sector.  More  specifically,  the  proposed  loan  will  finance  the \nconstruction or expansion of textile and garment factories that will meet the high structural, fire, \nand  electrical  safety  standards  required  by  the  accord  or  the  alliance  after  completion.  All \nEastern  Bank  borrowers  that  benefit  from  ADB  funding  will  be  required  to  consider  improving \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\nenergy  efficiency  in  their  factories  and  be  encouraged  to  select  energy-efficient  designs  and \nequipment for the subprojects.14 \n \nB. \n \n19.  Monitoring of the project will be carried out by ADB. Eastern Bank will provide ADB with \nfinancial and other reports at predetermined regular intervals and as requested. These reports \nwill  include  (i)  unaudited  financial  statements  on  a  quarterly  basis;  (ii)  audited  financial \nstatements  on  an  annual  basis;  (iii)  compliance  certificates  for  financial  covenants;  (iv) \nsemiannual  reporting  on  the  list  of  subprojects  financed  by  ADB,  including  details  on \nimplementation progress; (v) annual reporting on the implementation of the  environmental and \nsocial management system (ESMS) and on compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009)  and  the  bank\u2019s  gender  action  plan  (GAP);  and  (vi)  annual  reporting  on  selected \ndevelopment indicators agreed on by ADB and the borrower. \n \n20. \nADB will conduct field visits to Eastern Bank and selected ADB-financed subprojects at \nleast annually after the disbursement of the loan. Eastern Bank\u2019s existing ESMS will be updated \nto  improve  the  screening  and  monitoring  of  subprojects.15 The  loan  agreement  between  ADB \nand Eastern Bank will include covenants on safeguards and social protection. [The rest of this \nparagraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information.] \n \nC. \n \n21. \nGreater  access  to  long-tenor  finance  for  ready-made  garment  factory  expansion \nand  construction.  The  RMG  sector  is  a  critical  part  of  the  Bangladesh  economy  but  lacks \naccess to the long-term funding necessary for its development. Local banks cannot obtain long-\nterm  US  dollar  finance  from  commercial  sources.  International  banks  provide  them  only  with \nshort-term  trade  finance  of  up  to  1  year.  The  local  banks  cannot  tap  the  international  capital \nmarkets  because of  Bangladesh\u2019s  low  country  rating. Thus, the long-term funding  provided by \nADB  will  enable  Eastern  Bank  to  offer  long-term  US  dollar  financing  to  the  subproject  clients \nand improve the bank\u2019s asset\u2013liability profile.  \n \nStrengthening  of  Eastern  Bank\u2019s  environmental  and  social  management  system. \n22. \nThe  project  will  help enhance  Eastern  Bank\u2019s  ESMS.  Eastern  Bank  will  be  required  to  comply \nwith  environmental  and  social  safeguard  measures  of  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  In \naddition  to  complying  with  the  safeguard  requirements  introduced  by  the  IFC  remediation \nfinance  program  (footnote  12),  ADB  has  proposed  further  enhancements  to  Eastern  Bank\u2019s \nproject  screening  and monitoring process,  including  the  expansion  of the  bank\u2019s  due  diligence \nchecklist to include environment and social safeguards and other labor aspects.  \n \nGender equity support for women. The ADB loan will incorporate gender elements in \n23. \nEastern  Bank\u2019s  financing  in  the  RMG  industry.  The  project  is  classified  as  effective  gender \nmainstreaming.  ADB helped Eastern Bank to develop a GAP16 to ensure the improvements of \nfacilities and working conditions for women working in the RMG factories financed by ADB. The \n\n                                                \n14 Because  few  factory  owners  are  willing  to  incur  the  costs  of  energy  efficiency  certification,  it  is  not  possible  to \nrequire  them  to  measure  energy  efficiency  level  of  the  subprojects.  However,  Eastern  Bank  will  include  energy \nefficiency as a subloan assessment criterion. It will obtain confirmation from all subborrowers that energy efficient \ndesign and equipment are selected, subject to project cost estimates and other constraints. \n\n15 Financial  Intermediary:  Environmental  and  Social  Management  System  Arrangement  (accessible  from  the  list  of \n\nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n16 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \nA. \n \n26. \n\n \n\nRisks \n\nGAP\u2019s  substantive  gender  design  features  will  include  the  provision  of  a  health  center  and \nsafety training for women working in subproject factories. \n \nD. \n \n24. \nredacted due to commercially sensitive information.] \n \n25. \n \n\nKey  risks  to  the  project  include  the  following:  [The  rest  of  this  paragraph  has  been \n\n[This paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information.]  \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nDevelopment Impacts, Outcome, and Output \n\nImpacts. The impacts will be the following: \n(i) \n\nHealth  and  safety  standards  of  the  garment  industry  in  Bangladesh \nenhanced.  The  textile  and  garment  industry  in  Bangladesh  has  a  poor  safety \nrecord. The loan will support the joint efforts of the government and other national \ngovernments,  international  apparel  companies  and  retailers,  trade  unions,  United \nNations\u2019  agencies,  multilateral  and  bilateral  development  agencies,  and  domestic \nindustries  to  improve  the  health  and  safety  of  workers  in  the  country\u2019s  RMG \nindustry. Since nearly 85% of the RMG workers are women, the project will have a \ndirect  impact  on  improving  the  working  conditions  for  women  workers  in \nBangladesh. \n\n(ii)  Finance sector further developed. The project will give Eastern Bank access to \nlong-term  US  dollar  funds,  which  will  in  turn  increase  its  ability  to  provide \ncompetitively priced long-term foreign currency loans to clients in this key sector of \nthe economy. \n\n(iii)  Energy  efficiency  in  the  textile  and  garment  sector  improved.  While  not \ndirectly measured, the project will help improve the energy efficiency of textile and \ngarment  factories  in  Bangladesh.  This  will  contribute  to  the  reduction  of \ngreenhouse gas emissions and mitigation of climate change. \n\nOutcome. The outcome will be sustainable growth of Eastern Bank\u2019s lending operations \n\n \n27. \nfor socially and environmentally sustainable projects. \n \nOutput.  The  output  will  be  the  expansion  of  Eastern  Bank\u2019s  lending  to  textile  and \n28. \ngarment  factories  that  meet  high  safety  standards  and  are  energy  efficient.  [The  rest  of  this \nparagraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information.]  \n \nB. \n \n29. \nConsistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The midterm review of ADB\u2019s \nStrategy  2020  calls  on  ADB  to  strengthen  its  support  for  the  finance  sector  by  helping  to \ndevelop financial infrastructure, institutions, and products and services.17 The project addresses \nthree  priorities  identified  by  the  midterm  review:  (i)  support  for  poverty  reduction  and  inclusive \neconomic  growth,  (ii)  environment  and  climate  change,  and  (iii)  support  for  private  sector \ndevelopment  and  ADB\u2019s  private  sector  operations.  The  project  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  country \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n                                                \n17 ADB. 2014.

Manila. \n\n\f7 \n\npartnership  strategy  (CPS)  for  Bangladesh  for  2011\u20132015.18 The  CPS  prioritized  support  for \ndeveloping the private sector and the finance sector to accelerate growth, with an emphasis on \nclean energy, infrastructure finance, and expanding credit for SMEs. It called for environmental \nconsiderations to be integrated into sector interventions. \n \n30. \nConsistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  project  is \naligned  with  ADB\u2019s  financial  sector  operational  plan,  which  calls  for  finance  sector  projects  to \nserve  the  needs  for  developing  the  real  economy  and  fit  the  overall  development  agenda \noutlined in ADB\u2019s CPS.19 The project continues ADB\u2019s past support for the textile and garment \nsectors in Bangladesh (footnote 10).  \n \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nA. \n \n31. \nBased  on  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  the  loan  is  classified  as  category  FI  for \npotential impacts on the environment and involuntary resettlement and category FI (treated  as \nC) for indigenous peoples. ADB\u2019s loan proceeds will not finance subloans that are assessed as \ncategory  A  for  environment  or  involuntary  resettlement  or  categories  A  or  B  for  indigenous \npeoples. The  potential  environment  and social  impacts  of  the investment, the risks  associated \nwith  the  borrower's  existing  and/or  likely  future  portfolio,  and  its  commitment  and  capacity  for \nenvironmental  and  social  management  have  been  assessed.  Eastern  Bank  will  apply  ADB's \nprohibited  investment  activities  list,  ensure  that  investments  using  ADB\u2019s  funds  abide  by \napplicable  national  laws  and  regulations  and  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement, \nand enhance its existing ESMS to ADB\u2019s satisfaction before the first disbursement of the loan. \n \n32. \nEastern  Bank  will  enhance  its  ESMS  by  improving  its  ESMS  screening  process.  The \nscreening  process  will  include  ADB\u2019s  prohibited  investment  activities  list  and  cover  ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental and social safeguards requirement. It will cover fire safety, including verification \nof  accord  and/or  alliance  CAP  implementation  status,  and  will  disqualify  high-risk  factories  for \nADB-financed  subloans.  Screening  will  include  the  review  of  the  social  and  labor  audits \nconducted  by  the  factory\u2019s  buyers  and  the  factory\u2019s  compliance  with  local  environmental \nregulations.  Subprojects  found  to  have  high-risk  environmental  and  safety  issues  will  be \nexcluded  from  the  ADB  project.  Eastern  Bank  will  enhance  its  staff  capacity  by  providing \nrelevant training on the ESMS.20 ADB will monitor the bank\u2019s ESMS implementation. \n \nThe  project  is  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming  under  ADB\u2019s  guidelines. \n33. \nEastern Bank\u2019s GAP outlines how the bank will cooperate with its garment factory subborrowers \nto improve working conditions for women workers, integrate gender-sensitive design in garment \nfactories,  conduct  fire  and  building  safety  training  for  women,  and  require  subborrowers  to \nestablish  and  operate  health  center  sections  in  factory  clinics  to  provide  appropriate  medical \nservices  for  women.21 Eastern  Bank  will  monitor  labor  issues  and  GAP  implementation  and \nreport  on  them  in  its  annual  environmental  and social  monitoring  report to  ADB. The  borrower \nwill comply with national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s 2001 Social Protection Strategy, will \ntake measures to comply with the internationally recognized core labor standards.
