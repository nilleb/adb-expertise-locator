THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the report and recommendation on a proposed policy-based \nloan and a proposed policy-based grant, both to the Kingdom of Tonga for subprogram 2 of the \nBuilding Macroeconomic Resilience Program.1 \n \n2.  The program aims to strengthen Tonga\u2019s long-term growth prospects and capacity to \nrespond to external shocks. The programmatic approach, with three subprograms during 2016\u2013\n2018, builds on previous policy-based operations of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and \nother development partners that sustain government efforts to improve (i) its fiscal position by \nadopting prudent policies and better public financial management (PFM), and (ii) the business \nclimate by continuing policy, regulatory environment, and public enterprise reforms. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Development  constraints.  Tonga  faces  challenges  to  macroeconomic  resilience \nbecause of geographic disadvantages, exposure to shocks, and internal bottlenecks. The public \nsector largely drives economic growth, which is highly volatile. Gross domestic product (GDP) \ngrew 1.1% on average during FY2005\u2013FY2015, compared with 3.8% globally. Recovery in \nagricultural production after a drought in 2015, strong remittances, and construction related to \nTonga\u2019s hosting of the 2019 Pacific Games led to estimated GDP growth of 3.1% in FY2016. \nContinued construction for the Pacific Games and tourism will drive medium-term growth. \n \n4.  Although the fiscal position has improved since the global economic crisis, Tonga remains \ndependent on external assistance. Cost overruns or funding shortfalls for the Pacific Games and \nexternal shocks such as substantial crop and infrastructure damage from Tropical Cyclone \nWinston in February 2016 could undermine fiscal sustainability. System and capacity weaknesses \naffect procurement and financial management. Tonga\u2019s business environment is strong relative \nto most Pacific developing countries, but the private sector faces several constraints.2 Legal \nframeworks for bankruptcy, foreign investment, and contracting need further improvement, and \nthe lack of reliable credit information raises the cost of extending credit to new clients. Tonga\u2019s \nstate-owned enterprises (SOEs) accounted for 19%\u201323% of the country\u2019s total capital stock, but \ncontributed only 7% to GDP in FY2014.3 To improve the commercial returns of the SOE portfolio, \nthe government must further emphasize governance, monitoring, and divestment of assets that \ncan be more efficiently operated by the private sector. \n \n5.  Government reforms. Tonga has adopted a reform program to address constraints on \nthe public and private sectors.4 Despite limited policy-making and administrative capacity and a \npolitical economy environment where intertwined political and social networks pose inherent risks \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The program is in Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2016. \nCountry Operations Business Plan: Tonga, 2017\u20132019. Manila. It aligns with ADB. 2016. Pacific Approach, 2016\u2013\n2020. Manila. The concept paper for the program was circulated to the Board of Directors on 22 July 2015. \n2  In the 2017 Doing Business survey, Tonga was the top-ranked Pacific developing country, but was 85th among 190 \ncountries worldwide. World Bank. 2017. Doing Business 2017: Equal Opportunity for All. Washington, DC. \n3  The commercial activities of Tonga\u2019s 14 active SOEs include utilities, banking, and transportation. As of FY2014, \ntotal SOE portfolio assets stood at about $227 million, or just over half that year\u2019s GDP. The four largest SOEs\u2014\nTonga Power Limited, Tonga Development Bank, Tonga Communications Corporation, and Tonga Cable Limited\u2014\naccount for almost three-quarters of total assets. \n4  Sector Assessment (Summary): Public Sector Management (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n2). \n ", "2 \nto  reform  implementation,  Tonga  has  made  good  progress  on  reforms  as  successive \ngovernments have shown persistence. The current government, in office since January 2015, is \ncommitted to \u201ca more progressive Tonga supporting a higher quality of life.\u201d5 \n \n6.  Addressing  fiscal  challenges.  The  government  is  committed  to  prudent  fiscal \nmanagement. Annual average domestic revenue growth of 6.5% outstripped annual average \ngrowth  in  recurrent  expenditure  of  5.0%  during  FY2011\u2013FY2016.  Increased  tax  rates  on \npetroleum products and unhealthy foods (partly offset by tax reductions on healthy alternatives) \nwere the major source of domestic revenue. The wage bill also went up during the period, amid \nfrequent pressures for public sector pay increases and cost of living adjustments. A remuneration \nstructure introduced in FY2017 is expected to stabilize longer-term wage growth, after a one-time \ncost of transitioning to the new structure. Tonga intends to minimize the cost of new developments \nand finance the Pacific Games through domestic revenues, grants, and corporate sponsorship. \nThere is a moratorium on nonconcessional debt. \n \n7.  Tonga\u2019s fiscal situation improved as the deficit (including grants) fell from 7.4% of GDP in \nFY2011 to a modest surplus of 1.7% of GDP in FY2014. Despite strong domestic revenues, the \nfiscal position returned to a deficit of 3.1% of GDP in FY2016 (Table 1) because of current \nexpenditure  growth  (including  a  public  sector  pay  settlement)6 and  lower  grants.  Tonga\u2019s \nimproved debt sustainability led the World Bank and ADB to move from 100% to 50% grant \nfinancing. Increasing tax revenues and a declining wage bill are projected to reduce the deficit in \nFY2017\u2013FY2018. Excluding grants, the fiscal deficit averaged 7.9% during FY2011\u2013FY2016, \nindicating heavy dependence on external financing. \n \nTable 1: Fiscal Framework, FY2014\u2013FY2019 \n(% of GDP unless otherwise indicated) \nItem  FY2014  FY2015  FY2016p  FY2017f  FY2018f  FY2019f \nTotal revenue and grants  27.5  28.1  27.3  27.5  28.6  28.8 \n  Total revenue  20.0  21.4  23.7  24.1  24.6  24.7 \n    of which: tax revenue  17.3  18.3  20.4  20.7  21.0  21.1 \n  Grants  7.5  6.7  3.6  3.4  4.0  4.1 \nTotal expenditure  25.7  29.3  30.4  29.4  29.8  29.9 \n  Current expenditure  25.0  25.8  27.8  26.4  26.1  26.0 \n    of which: wages and salaries  11.2  11.4  12.5  13.4  12.8  12.2 \n             \nOverall balance (including grants)  1.7  (1.2)  (3.1)  (1.9)  (1.2)  (1.1) \n  in $ million  7.6  (5.1)  (13.3)  (8.7)  (5.8)  (5.6) \nOverall balance (excluding grants)  (5.8)  (7.9)  (6.7)  (5.3)  (5.2)  (5.2) \n  in $ million  (25.4)  (33.9)  (28.8)  (23.8)  (24.4)  (25.6) \n             \nPublic debt (domestic and external)  45.8  49.0  48.7  48.2  48.7  47.1 \nGDP ($ million, current prices)  439.0  429.0  430.0  446.0  466.0  488.0 \n( ) = negative, f = forecast, FY = fiscal year, GDP = gross domestic product, p = preliminary. \nSources: Asian Development Bank, Government of Tonga, International Monetary Fund, and World Bank. \n \n8.  Improving the business climate. The government has introduced reforms to create a \nbetter business environment for the private sector and improve the efficiency of public enterprises. \nReforms  include  a  simpler  business  registration  system,  a  new  legislative  framework  for \nreceiverships, and a clear governance framework for natural resources.

However, \nthe performance of the public enterprise portfolio is volatile and can be further improved through \nreforms to the governance and ownership structure of individual SOEs. \n \n9.  ADB contributions. ADB has supported government reforms through budget support and \ntechnical assistance (TA) to improve Tonga\u2019s fiscal performance and business environment \n(figure). ADB disbursed budget support for Tonga in FY2010, FY2014, and FY2016 to address \ndevelopment financing needs, cover reform costs, and provide incentive for implementation \n(footnote 6). It backed the government\u2019s tax revenue mobilization and administrative efficiency \nmeasures, which led to rapid domestic revenue growth (para. 6). ADB assists PFM and civil \nservice reforms through TA8 and is the lead external partner on SOE reforms. Following a \ndecrease in the return on equity of Tonga\u2019s public enterprise portfolio from about 5.6% in FY2006 \nto 0.1% in FY2009, ADB-supported measures to strengthen the Public Enterprises Act 2002, \nimplement skills-based SOE director selection, and commercialize selected SOEs helped push \nup the return on equity to 4.0% in FY2015. Reforms to improve SOE governance and efficiency, \nenhance service regulation, and strengthen public procurement and audit positively affect and \ndirectly complement ADB\u2019s sector investments. \n \nADB Support for Fiscal and Business Environment Reforms in Tonga \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, PFM = public financial management, PSDI = Private Sector Development Initiative, \nSOE = state-owned enterprise, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n10.  Partner  coordination.  Since  2011,  the  government  has  prioritized  and  sequenced \nreforms  through  the  joint  policy  reform  matrix  (JPRM)  process,  which  brings  together  key \nministries and development partners to map out critical constraints, design policy and TA solutions, \nmonitor reform implementation, and mobilize financial assistance.9 ADB, Australia\u2019s Department \nof  Foreign  Affairs  and  Trade,  the  European  Union,  the  International  Monetary  Fund,  New \nZealand\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the World Bank coordinate their budget \nsupport and/or TA operations through the JPRM process. \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2016.

Programmatic approach. ADB\u2019s Building Macroeconomic Resilience Program supports \ngovernment reforms through three subprograms during FY2016\u2013FY2018.10 The programmatic \ndesign  allows  for  reform  sequencing  across  multiple  areas  to  account  for  Tonga\u2019s  limited \nimplementation capacity, while providing flexibility to respond to emerging opportunities and \nconstraints. ADB developed the policy matrix (Appendix 4) in consultation with the government \nand other development partners, and in alignment with national priorities. Subprogram 1 was \ncompleted in FY2016, and supported reforms focused on fiscal consolidation, PFM strengthening, \nand improving the business environment. \n \n12.  Subprogram  2  continues  the  reform  agenda.  During  subprogram  1  preparation,  10 \nindicative triggers for subprogram 2 were identified. Consultation with the government on the \nevolution of reform priorities and context led to the finalization of nine policy actions.11 Since \nsubprogram  3  will  conclude  the  program,  the  indicative  triggers  for  subprogram  3  were \nrationalized in line with government priorities and capacity, to strengthen and consolidate reforms \nimplemented under subprograms 1 and 2. The overall program is expected to close in FY2018, \nprior to the general election scheduled for November 2018. ADB will discuss the need for a follow-\non multiyear budget support program with the new government after the elections. \n \nB.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n13.  The program aligns with the following impacts in the Tonga Strategic Development \nFramework, 2015\u20132025: (i) more inclusive and sustainable growth and development; (ii) a more \ninclusive, sustainable, and dynamic knowledge-based economy; and (iii) more responsive good \ngovernance  (footnote  5).  The  outcome  will  be  an  improved  fiscal  position  and  business \nenvironment in Tonga. The program is consistent with ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach 2016\u20132020 \n(footnote 1), which supports greater resilience to external shocks and risks and a better business \nenvironment as key outcomes. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n14.  The program has four outputs. The first three outputs are in line with the JPRM, and \ncontinue government reform efforts supported by ADB and other development partners. The \nfourth output responds to damage from Tropical Cyclone Winston in the Vava\u2019u island group, \nwhich increased financing needs in FY2016. \n \n15.  Subprogram 2 supports nine policy actions, which build on subprogram 1 reforms and \naddress the critical challenges facing Tonga in improving its fiscal position and business climate. \nThe government has completed all nine actions. Additionally, nine indicative triggers have been \nidentified for subprogram 3, which may be refined based on government priorities and capacity. \n \n16.  Output 1: Fiscal resilience supported. Policy actions under subprogram 1 included \nmeasures to strengthen tax revenue mobilization. The government conducted a civil service \nremuneration review and introduced a new debt management strategy under subprogram 1. \n(i)  Fiscal targets. Subprogram 2 supported the development of a fiscal strategy \nbased on internally consistent medium-term targets for debt, revenue, and public \nservice wage affordability. The government\u2019s previous fiscal strategies and targets \n                                                \n10 ADB. 2016. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Programmatic \nApproach  and  Policy-Based  Loan  and  Grant  for  Subprogram  1  to  the  Kingdom  of  Tonga  of  the  Building \nMacroeconomic Resilience Program. Manila. \n11 Indicative Triggers and Policy Actions Accomplished for Subprogram 2 (accessible from the list of linked documents \nin Appendix 2) summarizes the changes in the policy actions for subprogram 2. \n ", "5 \nwere short term in nature. While Tonga\u2019s fiscal management has been prudent, \nexternal shocks and spending pressures related to the Pacific Games could \nundermine sustainability. The new strategy brings together three fiscal targets to \nbe maintained over the medium term: (a) external debt is below 50% of GDP, with \nonly highly concessional debt contracted; (b) domestic revenue is above 22% of \nGDP; and (c) public remuneration is below 53% of domestic revenue.12 This will \nhelp the government\u2019s planning, build resilience to shocks, and provide sustainable \nfunding for public services. \n(ii)  Tax revenues. Subprogram 2 continued tax regime changes related to health and \nthe environment through increases in selected excise and import duty rates (on \nfuel, alcohol, tobacco and processed food items). The government raised the fuel \nexcise tax by 16% or T$0.09 per liter. It also introduced changes in other excise \ntax and import duty rates to improve revenue mobilization and provide incentives \nfor the consumption of healthy foods.13 Development partners estimate that similar \nmeasures  under  subprogram  1  raised  excise  tax  and  import  duty  revenue \ncollections by T$7.5 million (0.9% of GDP in FY2016), and that measures under \nsubprogram 2 will raise collections by a further T$10.2 million (1.1% of GDP in \nFY2017). These reforms have contributed to raising tax revenue to an estimated \n20.7% of GDP in FY2017. \n(iii)  Civil  service  reforms.  Under  subprogram  1,  the  government  conducted  a \ncomprehensive public remuneration review.  Based on its recommendations, the \ngovernment approved for subprogram 2 a new public service salary structure with \na revised pay scale that provides fair and appropriate remuneration (para. 6). \nPublic  servants  are  being  progressively  moved  to  the  new  payscale.14 The \ngovernment also introduced a moderated performance assessment process under \nsubprogram 2.15 Following a brief adjustment period, these changes will achieve \ncost savings by ending automatic salary progressions and relieve pressure for \nuniversal pay settlements from civil servants at the top of their pay bands. The \nwage bill as a share of domestic revenue is projected to fall below 50% of domestic \nrevenue (in line with fiscal targets) by FY2018. \n \n17.  Subprogram 3 will continue the tax revenue and civil service reforms to help meet \nsustainable wage bill targets. ADB is presently providing TA for civil service reforms (para. 9), and \nJPRM partners expect to provide TA for the tax reforms. \n \n18.  Output 2: An inclusive, modern, and accountable state supported. Policy actions \nunder subprogram 1 included approval of new public procurement regulations and other PFM \nimprovements, such as improved audit follow-up procedures. An independent regulator with \npowers to regulate communication services was also established.16 \n(i)  Procurement.  Subprogram  2  built  on  past  efforts  to  establish  a  centralized \nprocurement  system. It  supported  the  implementation  of  a  new  procurement \n                                                \n12  This includes employer social security contributions. The target moves to 50% over time.  \n13 Government of Tonga, 2016. Ministry of Revenue and Customs. Customs Duty (Amendment) 2016.

The government will also immediately \ntransition other staff who remain on the same or higher salary point under the new system. Staff whose existing \nsalary point is above the band for their new grade will remain on the existing pay scale. The government will remap \nsuch positions to the new pay scale as they are vacated and re-advertised. \n15 The performance assessment process was supposed to be introduced in FY2018 (under subprogram 3) but was \nintroduced in FY2017, indicating rapid reform progress in this area. \n16The  Parliament  approved  the  establishment  of  the  Communications  Commission  with  powers  to  regulate \ncommunication services and manage license issuance, fee setting, monitoring, and consultation with the public. \n ", "6 \ntracking database, which introduced an institutional mechanism that will enable the \nMinistry  of  Finance  and  National  Planning  (MFNP),  through  its  Central \nProcurement Office, to maintain a detailed record of all procurements above the \nsmall-item  threshold  (T$7,500).  Compliance  and  performance  indicators  and \nassociated  targets,  which  will  allow  the  government  to  monitor  procurement \nperformance and maintain records, were also established under subprogram 2. \n(ii)  Regulation. Subprogram 2 supported the cabinet approval of a draft national \nenergy bill, which includes provisions to regulate all energy sub-sectors (electricity, \ngas, petroleum) under a combined sector regulator. Regulation of the energy \nsector currently involves a variety of arrangements, with the Electricity Commission \nregulating distribution and supply and the Tonga Competent Authority regulating \npetroleum prices. The bill will establish an energy sector regulator that will merge \nthe responsibilities of both entities. The government will address the regulation of \nother utilities such as water and waste management after the energy sector \nregulatory reform is completed. \n \n19.  Subprogram 3 is expected to support legislation to improve labor market functioning while \nsafeguarding employee rights, as well strengthening of the national energy bill. The government \nplans to improve its accounting procedures with Pacific Financial and Technical Assistance \nCentre support. ADB TA will help upgrade the financial management system.17 \n \n20.  Output 3: A more dynamic and inclusive economy supported. Business environment \nreforms  under  subprogram  1  included  public  enterprise  governance  improvements  and \ncommercialization of the Tonga Water Board. ADB provides advisory services through the Pacific \nPrivate Sector Development Initiative for these outputs.18 \n(i)  Foreign investment. Foreign direct investment in Tonga is currently about 2.8% \nof GDP and is encumbered by burdensome and complex legislation. ADB\u2019s earlier \nbudget support saw the development of a new investment policy, which was a \npreliminary  step.  Under  subprogram  2,  the  cabinet  has  approved  foreign \ninvestment  legislation  that  makes  it  easier  to  invest  in  Tonga.  The  Foreign \nInvestment (Amendment) Bill includes (a) a clearer definition of what constitutes \nforeign investment, (b) new principles and procedures to manage reserved and \nrestricted lists, (c) transparent procedures for vetting potential investments, and (d) \na requirement for foreign investors to report the status of their investments annually. \nThrough rationalized restrictions, the bill is expected to generate increased interest \nfrom foreign investors, by signaling that the government is serious about cutting \nred tape and by improving the potential profitability of investing in Tonga. \n(ii)  Receivership. To facilitate insolvency proceedings, the cabinet approved the \nReceivership Bill in 2013 to establish a process for identifying and nominating \nreceivers and establishing clear receivership procedures.19 Following delayed \nParliament approval in September 2015, the receivership act was tabled to the \nPrivy  Council  in  October  2015.  After  a  Privy  Council  decision  directed  the \ngovernment to note the grievances concerning asset acquisition detailed in a \npetition to the King of Tonga, the government held four rounds of consultations \nwith petitioners to address their concerns, which were amicably resolved with no \nchanges to the bill\u2019s provisions. Under subprogram 2, the cabinet approved the \n                                                \n17 ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance for Pacific Economic Management (Phase 2). Manila. \n18 ADB. 2013.

A receiver is a person or manager who is appointed \nthrough terms of agreement or by an order from the Supreme Court. \n ", "7 \nact for resubmission to the Privy Council. A bankruptcy policy will be prepared \nafter the act is proclaimed and published in the government gazette. \n(iii)  Public enterprises. Subprogram 2 continued a successful reform program to \nimprove the financial viability of the government\u2019s overall SOE portfolio. The \ncabinet directed the Ministry of Public Enterprises to proceed with a sale of \ngovernment shares in Tonga Cable Limited (TCL). The government holds 82% of \nTCL shares, and the Tonga Communications Corporation, another SOE, holds the \nremainder. The government has approved the sale of 18% of its shares to Digicel, \na  private  telecommunications  operator,  to  ensure  equal  treatment  of \ntelecommunications  operators  and  competitive  pricing.  In  addition,  Tonga \nCommunications Corporation has commissioned asset and enterprise valuations \nas a required step to partial privatization, recognizing the need for strategic \npartnerships in capital and expertise to better meet the demands of a growing \nmarket for data through mobile and fixed-line internet connections. \n \n21.  Subprogram  3  is  expected  to  support  better  credit  information  by  mandating  credit \nreporting, with TA from JPRM partners. Subprogram 3 will also support the revision of foreign \ninvestment regulations, including reserved and restricted lists, and work permit rules to support \nforeign investment legislation approved under subprogram 2. Other areas for support include \ncontinuing successful public enterprise reforms. Work on a private sector development strategy \nto guide reforms  over  the medium  term  is  under  way  and targeted  to  be finalized  during \nsubprogram 3. ADB will continue TA through the Pacific Private Sector Development Initiative. \n \n22.  Output 4: Effective response to disasters supported. Subprogram 1 supported a \nresponse plan to alleviate the hardship and secure the livelihoods of the populations affected by \nTropical Cyclone Winston. While this output area is not part of the triggers for subprograms 2 and \n3, it has allowed Tonga to address damage in the Vava\u2019u group of islands. Although reconstruction \nwork is behind the ambitious schedule envisaged in the initial 6-month response plan, activities \nundertaken so far include crop rehabilitation and disaster-proofing community shelters. The \nrebuilding of damaged schools has also commenced. \n     \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n23.  Excluding grants, the fiscal deficit in FY2017 is estimated to be $23.8 million (5.3% of \nGDP). Grants in FY2017 are expected to total $15.1 million, of which $10.3 million is confirmed \nbudget support. ADB will contribute $2.3 million in budget support grants. Budget support grants \nalso include $2.1 million from the European Union, $3.1 million from the Government of Australia, \n$1.1 million from the Government of New Zealand, and $1.7 million from the World Bank, as \nparallel collaborative partner financing not administered by ADB.20 This will leave a deficit of $8.7 \nmillion (1.9% of GDP) in FY2017, financed partly through budget support loans of $6.0 million \n($2.7 million from ADB and $3.3 million from the World Bank). Concessional project loans and \ndomestic bonds will fill the remaining fiscal gap of $2.7 million for FY2017. Excluding grants, the \nestimated fiscal deficit is $24.4 million in FY2018 and $25.6 million in FY2019. Grants of $18.6 \nmillion in FY2018 and $20.0 million in FY2019 will partly finance these deficits. Of these grants, \n$10.9 million is expected in the form of annual budget support (including $2.3 million from ADB). \nThe rest will be filled by $5.0 million in annual budget support loans (including $2.7 million from \nADB) and from external project financing and domestic borrowing. \n                                                \n20 The World Bank\u2019s policy matrix for its parallel project, the Second Inclusive Growth Development Policy Operation, \nsupports eight of the nine prior policy actions for subprogram 2 in ADB\u2019s policy matrix (Appendix 4). The action on \ncabinet approval of the Receivership Bill (para. 20) appears only in the ADB policy matrix. \n ", "8 \n24.  The government has requested (i) a concessional loan in various currencies equivalent to \nSDR2.026 million ($2.75 million equivalent) 21 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, and (ii) a \ngrant22 not exceeding $2.25 million from ADB's Special Funds resources (Asian Development \nFund) to help finance subprogram 2. The loan will have a 24-year term, including a grace period \nof 8 years; an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the loan agreement. The loan and \ngrant proceeds will finance expenditures under subprogram 2, excluding ineligible items,23 and \nwill be withdrawn, upon effectiveness, following ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2015, as \namended from time to time). \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n25.  The existing institutional structure for aid management in Tonga will be used to implement \nand monitor the policy actions supported by the program. The government\u2019s Budget Support \nManagement Committee, which leads the JPRM process, oversees the program. Through the \ncommittee, the MFNP will provide overall guidance and assume responsibility for coordinating \nprogram implementation, monitoring, and evaluation as the executing agency. The Ministry of \nCommerce,  Consumer,  Trade,  Innovation  and  Labour;  Ministry  of  Meteorology,  Energy, \nInformation, Disaster Management, Climate Change and Communications; Ministry of Public \nEnterprises; Ministry of Revenue and Customs; and Prime Minister\u2019s Office are the implementing \nagencies. Government authorities have confirmed this arrangement. \n \n26.  Subprogram  2  is  implemented  from  July  2016  to  June  2017.  Implementation  of \nsubprogram 3 is tentatively scheduled from July 2017 to June 2018, in line with Tonga\u2019s budget \ncycle. The policy matrix details the program framework, including the policy actions completed \nbefore  Board  consideration  of  subprograms  1  and  2,  and  those  indicatively  proposed  for \nsubprogram 3. Subprogram 3 will be presented for Board consideration after appropriate policy \nactions are completed. The JPRM process will continue to facilitate broad consultations on reform \npriorities. Government authorities will lead consultations on individual reform initiatives, which will \nbe discussed with private sector and civil society as needed.24 \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n27.  The  reforms  will  build  Tonga\u2019s  macroeconomic  resilience  and  ability  to  respond  to \neconomic  shocks.  Envisaged  reform  impacts  include  allocative  efficiency  gains  from  the \nrebalancing of expenditure to priority areas. Increased domestic revenue from tax changes (para. \n16) and higher returns (or less fiscal drain) from more efficient SOEs (para. 20) will gradually \nreduce future development financing needs. A declining wage bill will also contribute to a better \nfiscal position (para. 16). Increased macroeconomic resilience will reduce the negative impact of \nexternal shocks, including on growth and service delivery.25 \n                                                \n21 SDR0.7366 = $1.00 as of 10 April 2017. \n22 A country's eligibility for ADF grants under the revised grant framework is determined by its risk of debt distress. The \nlatest debt sustainability analysis determined that Tonga had a moderate risk of debt distress and was therefore \neligible to receive 50% of its ADF allocation as grants. \n23 List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Consultations are planned around the energy bill, foreign investment legislation, and the private sector strategy. \n25 Macroeconomic resilience comprises fiscal health (i.e., manageable fiscal deficits and public debt levels), adequate \nPFM systems and regulation for efficient and effective service delivery, sufficient cash and foreign reserves to \nrespond to external shocks, and a growing and gradually diversifying economic base. The last element is supported \nby reforms to streamline foreign investment. \n ", "9 \nB.  Governance \n \n28.  Promoting good governance is a key national priority. The government is implementing its \nPFM  reform  road  map,  FY2015\u2013FY2019,  to  close  gaps  identified  through  two  PFM \nassessments. 26  Despite  capacity  limitations  stemming  largely  from  its  small  size,  the \nassessments indicate that, compared with international best practice, Tonga\u2019s PFM system is \nmostly operating at average levels. The assessments indicate that the government has the ability \nto implement its budget but there are procurement, accounting, financial reporting, and auditing \nweaknesses. This program, complemented by development partner TA (footnote 6), addresses \nthose weaknesses. Tonga has taken steps to strengthen anticorruption measures, including by \ncreating  the  Parliament  Standing  Committee  on  Anti-Corruption  in  2015.  Consultations  on \nappointing an independent anticorruption commissioner are ongoing.27 ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy (1998, as amended to date) has been explained to and discussed with the government. \nADB will incorporate further anticorruption-related activities, as feasible and appropriate, in TA \nsupport under subprogram 3. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n29.  Extreme poverty is rare in Tonga, but material deprivation is an issue. The public sector \nis a key provider of infrastructure and services to low-income households, and output 1 will help \nensure that the government has the fiscal resources to respond to future economic shocks and \nnatural disasters (which tend to have an adverse effect on the poor) while maintaining critical \npublic services. The government\u2019s expenditure program includes increased allocations to social \nsectors and infrastructure. Output 2 will increase private sector competition and ensure effective \nregulation, and make basic goods and services affordable. More effective electricity regulation \nshould lead to lower prices and improved service delivery, benefiting the materially deprived \nsections. Output 3 will improve the environment for private sector activity, which would help bring \nmore jobs and opportunities to Tonga. While subprogram 2 is classified as having no gender \nelements, subprogram 3 will support women\u2019s labor market access and rights, and women\u2019s \nparticipation in the private sector through provisions under the Employment Relations Bill and the \nprivate sector development strategy already under preparation.28 \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n30.  Following  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement (2009),  subprogram  2  is  classified  as \ncategory C for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. Program \nactivities will be confined to policy and institutional reforms. No activity will result in or lead to \ninvoluntary resettlement, or negatively affect indigenous peoples or the environment. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n31.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 2 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.29 PFM systems are assessed as capable of \nsupporting mostly reliable services. The remaining fiduciary risks will be addressed through policy \n                                                \n26 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability. 2010.

The government and the MFNP have assured ADB that implementation of the program \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement, as described in detail \nin the loan and grant documents. The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for \nthe program, which are set forth in the loan and grant agreements. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n33.  I am satisfied that the proposed policy-based loan and grant would comply with the Articles \nof Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n(i)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR2,026,000 ($2,750,000)30 to the \nKingdom of Tonga for subprogram 2 of the Building Macroeconomic Resilience \nProgram, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in concessional terms, with an \ninterest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% \nper annum thereafter; for a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; \nand such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those \nset forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board; and \n(ii)  the grant not exceeding $2,250,000 to the Kingdom of Tonga, from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources (Asian Development Fund), for subprogram 2 of the Building \nMacroeconomic  Resilience  Program,  on  terms  and  conditions  that  are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft grant agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n28 April 2017\n                                                \n30 SDR0.7366 = $1.00 as of 10 April 2017. \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpacts the Program is Aligned with \nMore inclusive and sustainable growth and development (Tonga Strategic Development Framework, \n2015\u20132025)a \nA more inclusive, sustainable, and dynamic knowledge-based economy (Tonga Strategic Development \nFramework, 2015\u20132025)a \nMore responsive good governance (Tonga Strategic Development Framework, 2015\u20132025)a \n  Performance Indicators with Targets  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  Programmatic approach     \n  FY2017\u2013FY2019 annual average:    External shocks \nFiscal position  a.
