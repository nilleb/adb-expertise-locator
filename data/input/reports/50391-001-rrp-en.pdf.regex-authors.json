THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to\nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Demonstration of Guangxi Elderly Care and Health\nCare Integration and Public\u2013Private Partnership Project.\n2. The proposed project aims to support Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (GZAR) to\npromote, coordinate, and deliver integrated elderly care and health care services to provide\ncontinued care for those in need. It will serve as a demonstration for the PRC of an integrated\nelderly care and health care system and will be the first project in GZAR to introduce internationally\naccepted public-private partnership (PPP) principles and standards in the elderly care sector.\nII. THE PROJECT\nA. Rationale\n3. The PRC is facing a serious change in its demographic structure. In 2017, 158 million\npeople\u201411.4% of the population\u2014were aged 65 years and above. The aging rate is expected to\nreach 14% in 2025 and 21% in 2035.1 The aging population increases incidence of age-related\ndiseases. Elderly people typically have chronic diseases and experience multiple morbidities. The\nprimary cause of their care dependence is the loss of physical function resulting from chronic\ndiseases and age-associated impairments.2 Further, many elderly people have complex cases of\nmultiple chronic diseases and physical and/or cognitive disabilities which require a continuity of\nservices for both elderly care and health care. Coordination of care between health sector and\nelderly care sector is necessary to provide seamless care services for elderly people in need and\nto reduce avoidable hospitalization.\n4. In an aging society, elderly people tend to be readmitted to hospital because of lack of\nappropriate elderly care institutions that allow them to transition back to their homes.3 However, it\nwould be difficult for families to provide adequate care for elderly people who are discharged from\nhospitals and still require medical and elderly care services. Inadequate care at home can cause\nfurther health problems, which may require readmission to hospital. Frequent transitions between\nhospitals and homes or long stays in hospitals further reduce the functional abilities of the elderly.\n5. In the PRC, more than 100 million elderly people had at least one chronic disease in 2013\n(footnote 2). The burden of chronic disease is expected to increase by 40% by 2030 from the status\nof  2013.  The  number  of  elderly  people  with  multiple  chronic  conditions  is  also  increasing\nsignificantly in the PRC. Those elderly people would require post-acute care and rehabilitation to\nrestore or stabilize their functionality after discharge from hospital as well as elderly care (long-\nterm care) to maintain their activities of daily living.4 A coordination system, linking the acute phase\ncare, post-acute phase care, rehabilitation, and elderly care in an effective and efficient way, is at\n1  The aging rate is the ratio of population aged 65 years and above to the total population.

", "2 \nthe core of integrated health and elderly care. Such a system needs to ensure smooth linkage of \ncare services across the elderly care and health care sectors. \n6. To create a coordination system, a functional hospital discharge management system\nneeds to be established. The discharge management system will (i) clarify care needs after\nhospitalization, including needs for medical care, medication, rehabilitation, and elderly care; and\n(ii) identify  where  and  how  an  elderly  person  can  access  his  or  her  needed  care.  Such\nindividualized care plans should be prepared based on discussions with the elderly people, their\nfamilies, medical experts, therapists, social workers, and elderly care experts. Further, it is\nnecessary to strengthen the elderly care service capacity to meet a range of care needs. The\nintegration of health and elderly care will provide seamless care services across the two sectors\nbased on needs, and avoid using medical resources for the elderly care service provision.5\n7. Enhanced private sector involvement is vital to fill the gap in supplying coordinated elderly\ncare and health care services. Quantity of private providers varies greatly across localities, and no\nscheme has been established to ensure their quality. Considering substantial increase in care\nneeds due to rapid aging of the population, it would be unrealistic for the public sector to be the\nmain provider of care services. Meanwhile, the public sector needs to take responsibility for\nestablishing standardized care needs assessment and service quality monitoring systems. The\nprivate sector could bring its knowledge and experience to better design facilities, engage skilled\nstaff, and provide efficient services under the guidelines and regulations set by the public sector.\nSuch alignment of responsibilities is not yet clearly established in the PRC elderly care sector.\n8. The Government of the PRC has recognized the importance of integrated elderly care and\nhealth care services to respond to its rapidly aging population, and issued a related policy in 2015.6\nIn line with the central policy, the Government of GZAR (GGZAR) in 2016 issued policies on the\nimplementation of elderly care and health care integration, and for enhancing the involvement of\nthe private sector in care service provision for elderly people.7 While the GGZAR issued those\npolicies, it has limited experience and capacity in promoting the integration of elderly care and\nhealth care, and private sector involvement in the coordinated care service provision.\n9. In order to build the institutional capacity and system, the municipalities of Nanning and\nHezhou were selected as pilot cities for elderly care and health care integration in 2017.8 In the\nsame year, people aged 65 years and above were 0.8 million and 0.2 million in Nanning and\nHezhou municipalities which account for 11.4% and 10.1 % of the population, respectively. More\nthan 85% of those elderly people have at least one chronic disease and about 60% have\nmultimorbidity. The integration of elderly care and health care is necessary to provide needed care\nservices for those elderly people. However, most elderly patients directly return home after\ndischarge from tertiary level hospitals. A functional coordination system is not established between\nhospitals and elderly care facilities in those municipalities. The inter-sectoral coordination among\nbureaus, such as the civil affairs bureaus and the health commission, needs to be established.\n5  The PRC\u2019s social security system includes medical insurance, which helps finance medical care services. The PRC \nhas not yet established a long-term care insurance system. Most local governments provide some capital and \noperational subsidies for elderly care institutions. \n6  Government of the PRC, State Council. 2015.

In  2014,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  began  to  support  the  PRC\u2019s  local\ngovernments in promoting elderly care service development, including support to develop a PPP\nmodel in the elderly care sector. Lessons from those initial experiences suggested a strong need\nfor strengthening the governments\u2019 knowledge and capacities in elderly care and PPP.9 ADB has\nextended its support for the central government to establish an overall policy framework for the\nPRC\u2019s elderly care system.10 Previous ADB interventions focused on the three-tiered elderly care\nsystem and indicated that coordination of health care and elderly care services is a challenge in\nthe PRC, which requires urgent policy action. Building on ADB\u2019s experiences and knowledge in\nthe elderly care sector, the project will further support GZAR to achieve its policy target of elderly\ncare and health care integration to better adapt to the needs of its aging population (footnote 7).\n11. The project also supports Healthy China 2030, highlighting the optimization of health\nservices as a critical development challenge in the PRC.11 It is in line with ADB\u2019s (i) country\npartnership strategy for the PRC, 2016\u20132020, focusing on inclusive growth; (ii) Operational Plan\nfor Health, 2015\u20132020, which has elderly care as a focus area; and (iii) Strategy 2030, as it\n(a) demonstrates the \u201cOne ADB\u201d approach with the Office of Public\u2013Private Partnership\u2019s support\nfor catalyzing investments through PPP and delivering integrated solutions, and (b) supports\noperational priorities 1 (addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequality) and 2 (accelerating\nprogress in gender equality).12 The project addresses issues of upper middle-income countries,\nas in ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, through strengthening institutions, developing a demonstrative project,\nexpanding PPPs, and responding to critical social issues, i.e., the aging population. The project\u2019s\ndemonstrative and innovative experiences in the areas of elderly care and PPP will have an\nessential knowledge transfer impact not only on other provinces in the PRC but also on other\ndeveloping member countries facing challenges regarding their aging populations.\nB. Impact and Outcome\n12. The project is aligned with the following impact: integrated elderly care and health care\nservices in GZAR established (footnote 7). The project will have the following outcome: utilization\nof coordinated health care and elderly care services in GZAR increased.13\nC. Outputs\n13.

The project was found to be technically feasible following careful examination of the\nproject\u2019s compatibility with local conditions and capacity for operation and maintenance. Design\noptions in feasibility study reports were compared and least-cost alternatives were selected. The\narchitectural design (layouts), following relevant PRC regulations, incorporated international and\nnational standards as well as good practices, and follows age-friendly, elderly care-focused,\nefficient, and inclusive principles. Low-carbon, seismic structure, and resource-efficient measures\n(including solar hot water systems, intelligent lighting control, and passive energy-saving designs)", "7 \nwill be adopted. The facility design should meet respective functionalities and suitable operation \nof elderly care facilities. To ensure proper facility design, preliminary and detailed designs will be \nreviewed by an elderly care architect and cleared by ADB. \nB. Economic and Financial\n23. Economic. The project foresees the provision of coordinated elderly care and health care\nservices to the rapidly aging populations in Nanning and Hezhou municipalities. The cost-\neffectiveness approach was used for economic analysis, in accordance with ADB guidelines.20\nThe approach required that the elderly care facilities and a medical facility be compared with\nalternative designs, which aim to achieve the same number of elderly people served during the\nsame time frame as the project design. The results of the cost-effectiveness analysis showed that\nthe net present value of the alternative designs would cost $3.64 million more than the project\nscenario over the 20-year operation period, making the project the more cost-effective option.\n24. Financial.  The  financial  analysis  was  conducted  to  determine  the  viability  and\nsustainability of the proposed subprojects. It examined the possible revenues to be generated by\nsubprojects and assessed their projected incremental financials over a life cycle period in real\nterms. The financial internal rate of return of 10.82% for a subproject (medical facility), which is\nhigher than the weighted average cost of capital of 2.27%, shows its financial viability. A fiscal\nsustainability analysis conducted for the elderly care facility subprojects showed that the total\nproject incremental costs will have a negligible impact on the budgets of those municipalities, thus\nconfirming their project sustainability. The maximum impact of the incremental costs will be less\nthan 0.8% of the annual fiscal revenues of the municipalities.\nC. Governance\n25. Financial  management  assessment.  The  financial  management  assessment  was\nconducted in accordance with ADB guidelines.21 It considered the financial management capacity\nof  Nanning  Municipal  Government,  HMG,  and  PIEs.  The  assessment  covered  fund  flow\narrangements, staffing, accounting and financial reporting systems, internal and external auditing\narrangements, and financial information systems. The GPMO has experience in implementing\nADB-financed projects and has a proven record in project financial management. The financial\nmanagement risk is moderate mainly because the PIEs have no experience in implementing ADB\nprojects, and their staff will need to be familiarized with ADB policies and procedures. Mitigation\nmeasures to address identified deficiencies were agreed with the executing and implementing\nagencies, and PIEs. The financial management actions are included in the PAM (footnote 18).\n26. Procurement risk assessment. The procurement risk assessment was conducted in\naccordance with ADB guidelines.22 It confirmed that the GPMO, implementing agencies, and\nPIEs,  acting  through  a  procurement  agency  and  with  the  assistance  of  ADB  and  project\nimplementation support consultants, will have adequate capacity to facilitate compliance with the\nADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for\nADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). The project procurement risk was rated\nmedium. The GPMO has experience in implementing ADB-financed projects and is familiar with\nADB procurement procedures. However, the PIEs lack ADB project experience, and their staff\n20 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila.\n21 ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.

", "8 \nwill need to be familiarized with ADB policies and procedures. Mitigation measures to address \nidentified deficiencies have been agreed with the GPMO, implementing agencies, and PIEs. \n27. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed\nwith the government and the GGZAR. The specific policy requirements and supplementary\nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 18).\nD. Poverty, Social, and Gender\n28. A poverty and social analysis was conducted in Nanning and Hezhou municipalities by\nfocusing on care needs of elderly people and the availability of care services. The household\nsurvey presented that about 20% of elderly people reported their self-rated health status as poor.\nFurther, about 15% of respondents showed physical and/or cognitive impairments at moderate to\nsevere  levels.23  Meanwhile,  the  systematic  coordination  between  medical  and  elderly  care\ninstitutions has not yet been established. The capacity of needed care, such as rehabilitation, is\nalso significantly limited.24 The elderly people in need are not able to receive adequate care\nservices. The project will improve the provision of coordinated care services, thereby providing\nelderly people with better access to urgently needed care services.25\n29. The project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. Better coordinated elderly care\nand health care services will alleviate the burden of the young, especially young women, from\ninformal  family  care  responsibilities,  and  enable  them  to  concentrate  on  improving  their\nprofessional skills and finding jobs. The project will support the gender-sensitive facility use,\nenhance job opportunities for women during the construction and operation phases, and provide\ntraining opportunities for women to strengthen their skills and capacity.\nE. Safeguards\n30. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard\ncategories are as follows.26\n31. Environment (category B). An initial environmental examination (IEE), including an\nenvironmental management plan (EMP), was prepared for five elderly care facilities27 and a\nmedical facility, and was disclosed on the ADB website in June 2019.28 The IEE concluded that\nthe anticipated environmental impacts can be mitigated through effective EMP implementation.\nDuring construction, impacts anticipated\u2014including noise, air pollutants, demolition waste, and\nrisk to community and occupational health and safety\u2014are localized and short-term and can be\neffectively mitigated by implementing good construction practices.29 Contractors will address\nmanagement of wastewater and drainage, medical waste, and their linkage with associated\nfacilities, as required in the IEE and EMP. The EMP lists mitigation procedures that must be strictly\n23 The data were collected from the household survey conducted in Nanning and Hezhou municipalities. ADB. 2019. \nPoverty and Social Analysis Report for the Demonstration of Guangxi Elderly Care and Health Care Integration and \nPublic\u2013Private Partnership Project. Manila (TA 9437-PRC).  \n24 The ratio of physical therapists to beds is very low, i.e., 0.005\u20130.01, even in hospitals. \n25 The project will provide direct, cumulative benefits to an estimated 2,000 elderly people. \n26 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n27 Includes four elderly care facilities under output 1 and one facility under output 2. \n28 The IEE was prepared based on a domestic environmental impact assessment in Chinese language and will be \napproved by the Nanning or Hezhou Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau. \n29 If any asbestos-containing materials are found during the demolition of old facilities, the executing agency will engage \nthe services of a certified agency capable of handling and disposing of the asbestos-containing materials in \naccordance with international best practices. ", "9 \nfollowed in compliance with PRC regulations and ADB guidelines. The executing agency has \nconfirmed its commitment and capacity to implement the EMP. Further capacity building is \nproposed in the EMP. It will assign a safeguards officer within the GPMO to supervise effective \nimplementation of the EMP. The procedures, reporting timelines, and roles and responsibilities of \nrelevant  agencies  are described  in  the  EMP. Environmental  complaints  will  be  handled  in \naccordance with the grievance redress mechanism established for the project by the GPMO. \n32. Climate change. A climate risk and vulnerability assessment found that all project sites\nwould have a medium risk to climate change impact. Flood resilient designs and evacuation\ndevices are the principal measures to mitigate the anticipated impact. Electrical and other water-\nsensitive facilities will not be installed in the basement and lower floors to avoid incidents related\nto flooding. Air drying, heating, and cooling systems will be installed to help disadvantaged\ncitizens adapt to extreme climate conditions. All buildings will achieve energy efficiency standards,\nas required by official regulations. Preserving existing buildings, using renewable energy such as\nsolar heaters, and resource saving such as minimizing the use of cement are main methods to\nmitigate greenhouse gas emissions. The implementing agencies and PIEs will ensure these\nmeasures are incorporated in the detailed designs as proactive adaptation measures.\n33. Involuntary resettlement (category B). The project requires 11.38 hectares (ha) of land,\ncomprising 4.94 ha of rural collective lands and 6.44 ha of state-owned lands. Rural collective\nlands will be acquired for the second elderly care facility under the Hezhou People\u2019s Hospital\nsubproject  and  will  affect  56  households  with  296  persons  in  Xiadao  village,  of  which\n26 households with 152 persons will be significantly impacted because of house demolition.30 The\nincome losses for households with land impacts has been assessed to be insignificant, with less\nthan 1% of their household incomes affected. A draft resettlement plan was prepared following\nthe laws and regulations of the PRC, GZAR, and Hezhou Municipality; and ADB\u2019s Safeguard\nPolicy Statement (2009). HMG will be responsible for paying compensation and assisting affected\npersons before land acquisition and relocation. The other five facilities will be located on state-\nowned lands, and the resettlement due diligence confirmed that there is no past nor present\nconcerns related to involuntary resettlement. During project implementation, the GPMO and\nresettlement management staff of implementing agencies and PIEs will be trained in involuntary\nresettlement procedures. A grievance redress mechanism has been established, and an external\nagency will be engaged for semiannual resettlement monitoring and evaluation.\n34. Indigenous peoples (category C). In subproject areas of Nanning Municipality, ethnic\nminorities account for 50% of the total population. In the subproject area in Pinggui District,\nHezhou Municipality, they account for 2% of the total population. The Zhuang is the dominant\nethnic minority in Nanning while the Yao is the dominant ethnic minority in Hezhou. Ethnic\nminorities live in harmony with others and anticipate no obstruction or discrimination in accessing\nimproved elderly care and health care services under the project. The subprojects will not\nadversely affect their community identities, beliefs, religions, or customs. Therefore, an ethnic\nminority development plan to ensure that they receive improved elderly care services and health\nservices is not required.\n30 Among the 56 households, land acquisition will affect 30 households with 144 persons, house demolition will impact \n11 households with 88 persons, and both land acquisition and house demolition will affect 15 households with \n64 persons.  ", "10 \nF. Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan\n35. The overall benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs and risks involved.\nThe overall risk is rated moderate.
