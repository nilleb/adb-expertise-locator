It  is  further \nproposed  that  subprogram  1  be  supported  by  a  loan  for \n$300,000,000. \n \nTargeting Classification: General intervention \nSector: Finance \nSubsector: Finance sector development \nThemes:  Sustainable \ndevelopment, and governance  \nSubthemes:  Promotion  of  economic  efficiency  and  enabling \nmarkets;  policy, \nlegal,  and  regulatory  reforms; \nfinancial and economic governance. \n \nCategory C \n\ninstitutional, \n\neconomic \n\ngrowth, \n\nprivate \n\nsector \n\n \nFinancial  sector  reforms  are  crucial  to  raising  Indonesia\u2019s  growth \nrate  and  to  increasing  the  economy\u2019s  resilience.  Since  the  Asian \nfinancial  crisis  in  1997,  Indonesia  has  undertaken  key  financial \nsector reforms and has succeeded in restoring the banking sector \nto  solvency  and  profitability.  However,  the  rate  of  economic \ngrowth  has  not  returned  to  pre-crisis  levels.  Indonesia  needs \ninvestments, especially in infrastructure, but the domestic financial \nsector  is  not  yet  able  to  finance  them.  The  financial  sector  is \nshallow  and  dominated  by  banks.  Bank  lending  has  not  yet \nrecovered  to  pre-crisis  levels  and  banks\u2019  balance  sheets  make \nthem  unsuited  to  the  nation\u2019s  need  for  long-term  financing.  The \nnonbank  financial  sector,  in  particular,  the  capital  markets, \nalthough  still  small,  offer  a  major  opportunity  to  reinvigorate \ngrowth thorough more efficient intermediation. \n \nThe goal of the Capital Market Development Program Cluster is to \npromote  the  diversification  and  resilience  of  the  financial  sector \nwhile  supporting  the  medium-term  macroeconomic  goals  of  the \nGovernment.  The  Program  supports  the  Government\u2019s  financial \nsector  reform  agenda  by  focusing  on  capital  markets.  Most  of  its \npolicy  outcomes  will  be  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  financial \nsector policy package (FSPP) and its capital market master plan, \n2005\u20132009 (CMMP). \n \nThe  Program  aims  to  strengthen  transparency  and  information \ndisclosure. This is essential to build confidence in capital markets \nand  institutions,  facilitate  regulatory  oversight,  and,  in  turn,  to \npromote  price  discovery  and  market  liquidity.  Both  supply  and \n\n \nBorrower \n \nThe Proposal \n\n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nThe Program \nRationale \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nfor \n\ndemand  sides  of  financial  markets  will  be  addressed.  On  the \nsupply side, measures are proposed to deepen government bond \nmarkets,  which  are  an  essential  building  block \nthe \ndevelopment  of  corporate  bond  markets  and  inter-bank  money \nmarkets.  On  the  demand  side,  the  investor  base  needs  to  be \nbroadened by promoting institutional investors such as contractual \nsavings and collective investment schemes.  The Program aims to \nstrengthen  the  underlying  structure  for  securities  trading,  so \nfunction  with  sufficient  speed,  efficiency  and \nmarkets  can \naccountability.  Deeper  domestic  capital  markets  and  improved \nfinancial  intermediation  between  savers  and  investors,  supported \nby  stronger  regulation  and  supervision  will  increase  the  financial \nsector\u2019s  contribution  to  economic  growth.  Policy  measures  to \nimprove  financial  governance  and  market  efficiency,  and  to \nreduce systemic risks, are embedded in the Program and will help \nto strengthen investor confidence and the investment climate.  \n \nThe  reform  agenda  is  structured  around  the  following  policy \noutcomes,  which \nfour \ncomponents:  \n \n\nthe  Program\u2019s \n\nthe  basis  of \n\nform \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\ninformation  disclosure  and  price \n\nenhancing \ndiscovery; \npromoting deeper and more liquid financial \nmarkets; \nimproving market surveillance and investor \nprotection; and \nstrengthening governance and human resource \ncapacity. \n\nThe  Program  will  consist  of  two  single-tranche  subprograms \nanchored  on  the  Government\u2019s  financial  sector  reform  programs. \nIt  will  run  from  January  2006  to  December  2010,  with  a  single \ntranche loan of $300 million to be disbursed under subprogram 1 \n(2006\u20132007).  Subprogram  2  is  expected  to  be  ready  for  Board \napproval about 18 months after subprogram 1 becomes effective. \nThe  policy  actions  have  been  divided  into  two  phases:  January \n2006 to September 2007 for subprogram 1 (recognizing measures \nalready  taken  by  the  Government),  and  October  2007  to  June \n2009  for  subprogram  2.  The  Government\u2019s  medium-term  reform \nagenda and its timing will be reviewed in light of the achievements \nof subprogram 1 and reform proposals for the policy environment \nmay  be  modified  if  necessary,  supported  by  subprogram  2.  The \nGovernment envisages support from ADB of $200 million to $300 \nmillion for subprogram 2.  \n \nThe expected impact of the Program is capital market growth and \ndiversification, combined with stronger regulatory and supervisory \ncapacity. It is expected that the Program will lead to an increase in \nthe nonbank financial sector\u2019s share of total financial assets. The \nreforms,  which  concentrate  on  improving  information  disclosure \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \n\n\f \n\niii  \n\nThe Program Loan \nFinancing Plan \n\nPeriod and Tranching \n \n\nCounterpart Funds \n \n\nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\nand  enhancing  market  surveillance,  will  provide  more  protection \nfor investors. To provide a basis for consolidated regulation of the \nnonbank  financial  sector  and  to  move  toward  more  functional \nregulation, oversight of the capital markets was recently combined \nwith oversight of the contractual savings industries on which they \ndepend, principally insurance and pensions. This will be achieved \nthrough the recently merged Bapepam-LK (the capital market and \nnonbank  financial  supervisory  authority)  and  is  expected  to  be \nformalized under a regulatory framework now being developed. A \nnew  risk-based  approach  to  supervision,  which  originated  in \nbanking  and  has  already  been  applied  to  some  securities \nintermediaries,  will  be  applied  to  contractual  savings  institutions \nand  other  capital  market  institutions,  thus  reducing  the  risk  of \nregulatory arbitrage. \n \nA loan of $300,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will \nbe provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased  lending  facility  for  subprogram  1.  The  loan  will  have  a \n15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, an interest rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending \nfacility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  and  such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n \nThe program period is from January 2006 to December 2010, with \na  single  tranche  loan  of  $300  million  to  be  disbursed  under \nsubprogram  1.  Subprogram  2  will  be  submitted  for  Board \nconsideration  about  18  months  after  subprogram  1  becomes \neffective, subject to the Government\u2019s readiness to undertake the \nreform agenda.  \n \nThe  Government  will  use  the  local  currency  counterpart  funds \ngenerated  by  the  loan  proceeds  to  meet  program  expenditures \nand associated costs of reform and additional budgetary allocation \nfor development spending. \n \nBapepam-LK \n \nBapepam-LK  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Program  and \nwill monitor and facilitate the implementation of the agreed reform \nactions  to  ensure  that  they  are  carried  out  in  a  timely  manner. \nDMO  and  the  Directorate  of  Taxes  (DOT),  both  under  MOF, \nBapepeam-LK, Menneg BUMN (the State Ministry of State Owned \nEnterprises), and the Financial System Stability Forum will be the \nimplementing  agencies.  Bapepam-LK  has  established  a  program \ncoordination  committee  headed  by  the  Bapepam-LK  chair  with \nrepresentatives  from  DMO,  DOT,  Menneg  BUMN,  Bappenas \n(National  Development  Planning  Agency),  and  the  Financial \nSystem  Stability  Forum.  The  committee \nfor \ncoordinating  the  implementation  and  sustaining  of  the  program \nactions.  The  committee  shall  oversee  the  implementation  of  the \npolicy  actions  detailed  in  the  Policy  Letter  and  the  Policy  Matrix, \n\nis  responsible \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nProcurement \n\nProgram Benefits and \nBeneficiaries  \n\nand provide guidance and direction to the Executing Agency, the \nImplementing  Agencies  and  other  relevant  line  agencies  of  the \nBorrower. ADB may be invited to participate in the meetings as an \nobserver. \n \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign \nexchange  costs  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items \nproduced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries  (other  than \nitems  specified  in  the  list  of  ineligible  items  and  imports  financed \nby  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources).  The  Government  will \ncertify  its  compliance  with  this  formula  with  each  withdrawal \nrequest.  Otherwise, \nimport  documentation  under  existing \nprocedures  will  be  required.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  audit  the \nuse  of  the  loan  proceeds  and  to  verify  the  accuracy  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s certification.  \n \nThe Program supports the Government\u2019s agenda to establish the \nIndonesian  capital  market  as  a  resilient  and  competitive  market \nthat  supports  higher  growth  for  the  national  economy.  It  will \nprovide  a  policy \nfinancial \ninstruments  and  tenors,  and  new  kinds  of  intermediation.  It  will \nenhance information disclosure and facilitate price discovery, thus \nimproving  the  efficiency  with  which  financial  markets  price  risk.  \nThis will help to create deeper and more liquid capital markets. It \nwill  also  promote  stronger  intermediaries  that  are  better  able  to \nmobilize  and  allocate  resources  and  risks.  Better  market \nsurveillance  and  investor  protection  are  essential  for  capital \nmarket development. Together with the broader economic reforms \nbeing  undertaken  in  Indonesia,  the  development  of  the  capital \nmarkets  will  contribute \nto  productivity  growth,  employment \ngeneration, and financial sector stability. \n \n\nthat  encourages  new \n\nframework \n\nRisks and Assumptions  While mitigation measures have been put in place for some of the \nkey  risks  anticipated  for  program  implementation,  subprogram  1 \nstill faces some risks.  \n \nSustaining  Reforms.  The  financial and  operational  autonomy  of \nBapepam-LK,  which  is  critical  for  effective  supervision  of  the \nnonbank  financial  sector,  will  need  to  be  supported  by  an \nappropriate  regulatory  framework.  Reforms  being  undertaken  by \nthe  Government  may  be  opposed  by  vested  or  competing \ninterests. The public and parliament will need to be persuaded of \nthe  longer-term  benefits  of  reforms  that  have  upfront  costs.  The \nconsolidation  of  reform  initiatives  in  recent  years  and  the \ncommitment  to  further  reforms  by  the  Government  and  a  strong \nparliamentary coalition should ensure Indonesia is on the path to \ngrowth and poverty reduction.  \n \nGovernance and Capacity Constraints. Institutional and human \nresource  weaknesses  within  Bapepam-LK  may  lead  to  delays  in \nimplementing reforms. To address this, technical assistance (TA) \n\n \n\n\f \n\nv  \n\nwill  be  provided  under  the  Program  to  help  address  capacity \nbuilding. Further, the Government has agreed to commit, through \nits normal budgetary processes, appropriate provisions for human \nresources  development  to  sustain  capacity  building  efforts  over \nthe  medium  to  long  term.  ADB\u2019s  Country  Strategy  and  Program \n(2006-2009)  envisages  enhancing  governance  and  reducing \nopportunities for corruption through its lending and TA operations. \nADB  has  provided  support  for  anticorruption  measures,  including \nprocurement  reforms,  during  the  last  7  years.  A  number  of \nongoing \nloan-funded  activities  have  an  anticorruption  and \ncapacity-building  focus.  ADB  has  also  actively  supported  the \nPartnership  for  Governance  Reform  -a  cooperative  relationship \nbetween  the  Indonesian  Government,  civil  society,  the  private \nsector  and  Indonesia\u2019s  international  development  partners  on \ngovernance  reform.  The  Financial  System  Stability  Forum,  which \nbegan  operations  in  June  2007,  will  provide  a  platform  for \nexchanging information and ideas, and will help to coordinate the \nregulatory and supervisory activities of Bank Indonesia, Bapepam-\nLK,  and  the  Lembaga  Penjamin  Simpanan  (Deposit  Insurance \nInstitution).  Successful  implementation  of  the  CMMP  with  the \nsupport  of  the  Program  should  strengthen  the  capacity  and \nauthority  of  Bapepam-LK \nin  regulating  and  ensuring  good \ngovernance in the nonbank financial market. \n \nLack  of  Commitment  and  Accountability.  Lack  of \naccountability,  measurable  outcomes,  industry  commitment,  and \ntactical  planning  may  mean \ninto \nimplementation  difficulties.  There  are  differences  of  view  among \nstakeholders that will need to be resolved if policy reforms are to \nprogress.  However,  progress  is  likely  at  present  in  view  of  the \nstrong Government commitment to reform. The reform program is \nmade  more  tractable  by  a  phased  plan  for  the implementation  of \nwell  defined  measures  over  the  next  4  years,  in  line  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s  CMMP  as  well  as  its  financial  sector  policy \npackage. In addition, the establishment of an internal compliance \nbureau  in  December  2006  and  a  revised  code  of  ethics  will \nstrengthen governance and accountability within Bapepam-LK. \n  \nEnforcement  Constraints.  Bapepam-LK  may  have  difficulty  in \naddressing  its  compliance  and  enforcement  mandate  effectively. \nThe Program focuses on strengthening its investigation strategies \nand enforcement skills through a clearly defined capacity building \nprogram within Bapepam-LK.  \n  \nExogenous  Shocks.  Exogenous  shocks  to  the  economy  that \nadversely  affect  growth  prospects  and  threaten  macroeconomic \nstability are a risk to achieving program outcomes. There is also a \nrisk  of  a  slowdown  in  the  global  economy  and  of  a  disorderly \nimbalances.  However, \nunwinding  of  global  macroeconomic \noverall,  the  economy\u2019s  vulnerability  to  external  shocks  has  been \ndecreasing, primarily because of sound debt and macroeconomic \n\nthe  CMMP \n\nruns \n\nthat \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\nTechnical Assistance \n\nthe \n\nreducing \n\nmanagement.  Indonesia\u2019s  ratio  of  total  external  debt  to  GDP  fell \nfrom  49.3%  in  2005  to  under  37%  in  2006.  The  Program,  in \nconjunction with additional reform programs financed by ADB and \nthe  Development  Policy  Support  Program  financed  by  the  World \nBank  and  the  Government  of  Japan  will  help  to  sustain  the \neconomy\u2019s  growth  path  while \nrisks  of \nmacroeconomic instability. \n \nTA  will  be  provided  and  implemented  at  the  same  time  as  the \nProgram. The TA is estimated to cost $1,500,000 equivalent. ADB \nis administering a portion of the TA not exceeding the equivalent \nof  $500,000  to  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Financial \nthe \nSector  Development  Partnership  Fund  (established  by \nGovernment  of  Luxembourg).  In  addition,  ADB  will  provide  the \nequivalent  of  $700,000  on  a  grant  basis  to  be  funded  from  the \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund. The Government will provide \nthe  remaining  $300,000  equivalent  by  providing  counterpart  staff \nand  other  support  facilities.  The  objective  of  the  TA  is  to \ncomplement the efforts to be undertaken by Bapepam-LK and the \nGovernment  to  build  up  capacity  within  Bapepam-LK  and  the \ncapital  market  industry.  The  TA  will  support  capacity  building  in \nfive main areas: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nregulators \n\ninstitutions \n\ndeveloping  database  and  basic  applied  research  skills \nin Bapepam-LK\u2019s newly established research bureau; \ncarrying  out    on-the-job  training  for  Bapepam-LK  staff \nthrough  secondments  with \nin  other \njurisdictions;  \nimproving the market surveillance and regulatory skills \nof  Bapepam-LK  staff  through  short  courses  by  local \ntraining \nin  collaboration  with  outside \nexperts; \ndeveloping  curricula  for  training  programs,  as  well  as \nstandards  for  certification  for  professionals  in  fields \nrelated  to  capital  markets  (e.g.  general  insurance \nactuaries  and surveillance training for SRO staff); and \ndeveloping an econometric model and related capacity \nto  allow  for  a  better  understanding  of  vulnerabilities  in \nthe  nonbank  financial  sector  by  the  Financial  System \nStability Forum.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nprogram  cluster  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  the  Capital  Market  Development  Program \nCluster comprising two subprograms, and (ii) a proposed loan for subprogram 1. The report also \ndescribes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  strengthening  regulation  and  governance \nincluding the administration of a grant from the Financial Sector Development Partnership Fund \n(FSDPF) and, if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated \nto  me  by  the  Board,  will  approve  the  TA  and  the  administration  of  the  FSDPF  grant.  The \nprogram design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n\nEconomic  Growth. \n\n \n2. \nIndonesia\u2019s  strengthening  macroeconomic  performance  was \nreflected in a rising but still modest growth rate of 5.5% in 2006. This is faster than the average \ngrowth over the previous 3 years but still below the growth rates before the 1997 Asian financial \ncrisis. A key constraint on higher growth is the investment rate, which, while showing signs of \nimprovement,  remains  sluggish.  Fixed  investment  grew  by  just  2.9%  in  2006,  far  below  rates \nachieved  in  2004  and  2005,  although  it  perked  up  in  the  fourth  quarter  when  inflation  and \ninterest rates eased. Weak bank intermediation was another factor limiting investments and the \ngrowth potential.  \n \n3. \nWeak  Investment  Climate.  Lack  of  investment  stems  not  only  from  higher  borrowing \ncosts but also from continuing deficiencies in the business environment.  Realized foreign direct \ninvestment and domestic investment both fell by a third in 2006, foreign direct investment to $6 \nbillion and domestic investment to  $2.2 billion. On the other hand, Investment approvals rose, \nindicating  that  investment  could  turn  up  soon.  As  a  percentage  of  gross  domestic  product \n(GDP), gross fixed capital formation in Indonesia in 2006 was 24%, up slightly from 2005. That \nwas  below  rates  recorded  for  Viet  Nam  (33.1%  in  2005)  and  Thailand  (28.6%),  but  above \nMalaysia (20.2%) and the Philippines (14.2%).    \n \n4. \nSigns  of  Confidence. Inflation eased from above 17% in January 2006 to about 6.6% \nlate  in  the  year  as  the  impact  of  the  2005  boost  in  fuel  prices  faded.  The  Government \nimplemented bold fuel price adjustments in 2005 by reducing domestic fuel subsidies, thereby \nreducing the budget deficit by $4.5 billion for that year. The remaining domestic fuel subsidies \nare expected to be phased out, although no schedule has been provided. Citing improvements \nin  the  country\u2019s  fiscal  management  and  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  deal  with  corruption, \ninternational rating agencies Moody\u2019s and Fitch raised Indonesia\u2019s ratings outlook in early 2007 \nto  positive  from  stable,  though  the  B1  (Moody\u2019s)  and  BB-  (Fitch)  sovereign  rating  has  yet  to \nreach  investment  grade,  as  it  was  before  the  crisis.  The  Government  issued  $2  billion  in \ninternational  bonds  in  2006  and  $1.5  billion  in  February  2007,  bringing  the  total  outstanding \ninternational bonds to $7 billion. Option-adjusted spreads on sovereign bonds maturing in 2014 \nnarrowed  to  157  basis  points  in  late  2006  from  212  basis  points  early  in  the  year.  The  stock \nmarket index soared by 55% over the year, with market capitalization rising to the equivalent of \n37.4% of GDP from 30.0% in 2005. Foreign portfolio equity investment grew by almost 10 times \nto about $2 billion. \n \n5. \nReduced  External  Vulnerability.  The  current  account  surplus  rose  to  $9.9  billion  in \n2006, or 2.7% of GDP. Foreign reserves reached $42.6 billion, equivalent to about 4.5 months \nof  import  cover  and  official  debt  repayment.  Its  strong  external  position  enabled  Indonesia  to \nprepay  its  remaining  $7.8  billion  debt  to  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF).  Overall,  the \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\neconomy\u2019s  vulnerability  to  external  shocks  has  been  decreasing,  primarily  because  of  sound \ndebt management. The ratio of total external debt to GDP has also declined steadily since the \ncrisis, from over 150% of GDP in 1998 to just under 37% in 2006. The debt-service ratio rose to \nabove 24.8% in 2006 from 15.5% in 2005, primarily because of the early repayment of IMF debt \nand the end of a postponement on debt servicing by the Paris Club to help the country handle \nits December 2004 earthquake and tsunami disaster. Public debt was reduced to 41% of GDP. \nThe  Government  worked  to  contain  its  fiscal  deficit  and  to  redirect  public  expenditures  toward \ndevelopment and social goals. The realized fiscal deficit in 2006 was 0.9% of GDP. In 2005, the \ndeficit was 0.5%, mainly because new budgetary procedures delayed the release of funds that \nyear.  Portfolio  investment  has  been  strong;  partly  a  result  of  the  surge  in  global  liquidity,  but \ndirect, long-term investment is tepid. Financial markets continue to experience bouts of volatility, \ninfluenced by global developments and policy delays, and aggravated by the shallowness of the \ndomestic market. \n \n\nTable 1: Main Economic Indicators of Indonesia \n \n2002 \n 1,821.83 \n\n2003 \n 2,013.67 \n\n2001 \n 1,646.32 \n\n2000 \n1,389.77 \n\n2004 \n2,295.83 \n\n2005 \n\n2006 \n2,784.96  3,338.20 \n\n \n\n4.9 \n\n3.64 \n\n4.50 \n\n4.78 \n\n5.03 \n\n5.7 \n\n5.48 \n\n9.3 \n\n14.5 \n\n(4.6) \n\n12.6 \n\n17.6 \n\n(3.0) \n\n10.0 \n\n12.9 \n\n0.1 \n\n5.1 \n\n8.3 \n\n6.4 \n\n7.4 \n\n(0.6) \n\n(1.5) \n\n7,630 \n\n9,595 \n\n10,400 \n\n8,940 \n\n8,465 \n\n9,290 \n\n7,842 \n\n8,379 \n\n10,233 \n\n9,317 \n\n8,562 \n\n8,926 \n\n17.1 \n\n12.8 \n\n2.2 \n\n9,840 \n \n9,706 \n\n6.6 \n\n9.75 \n\n2.9 \n \n9,020 \n \n9,164 \n\n1999 \n1,215.1   \n \n\n \n\n0.8 \n\n1.9 \n\n12.5 \n\n(1.9) \n\nItem \nGDP \ncurrent \nprices (Rp \ntrillion) \nGDP \ngrowth \n(%) \nInflation \n(%) \nBI Rate \n(%) \nNet FDI \n($ billion) \nRp/$ (end \nof period) \nRp/$ \n(average \nof period) \n\nBI = Bank Indonesia, FDI = foreign direct investment, GDP = gross domestic product \nSource: Government of Indonesia. \n\n \nTable 2: GDP Growth in Selected Asian Economies (%) \n \n2006 \n9.4 \n10.7 \n5.5 \n5.9 \n5.4 \n5.0 \n8.2 \n\nEconomy \nDeveloping Asia \nChina, People\u2019s Republic of \nIndonesia \nMalaysia \nPhilippines \nThailand \nViet Nam \n\n2008 \n8.4 \n9.5 \n6.8 \n5.8 \n5.8 \n4.8 \n7.8 \n\n2007 \n8.8 \n10.0 \n6.3 \n5.5 \n5.8 \n4.5 \n8.0 \n\nSource: International Monetary Fund. 2007.

Indonesia  has  taken  important  steps  to  intensify  its \nstructural  reform  agenda,  enhance  the  investment  climate,  improve  public  infrastructure,  and \nstrengthen  financial  sector  intermediation.  A  time-bound  investment  policy  package  was \nintroduced  in  February  2006  and  an  Investment  Law  was  passed  in  March  2007.  An \ninfrastructure reform package was adopted in 2006 in support of the investment policy package. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3 \n\nHowever,  important  and  difficult  issues  related  to  tax  and  labor  markets  remain  under \ndiscussion. \n \n7. \nThe  Medium-Term  Development  Plan.  The  medium-term  national  development  plan, \n2004\u201320091 provides a clear set of targets that the Government wants to achieve by the end of \nthe  period.  Among  them  are  sustained  growth  of  more  than  6%,  job  creation  to  absorb  1.5 \nmillion  new  entrants  into  the  labor  market  annually,  achievement  of  Millennium  Development \nGoal  targets,  and  a  reduction  in  the  stock  of  debt  to  31.8%  of  GDP.  An  investment  climate \nsurvey  conducted  in  December  2005 2 highlighted  the  cost  of  financing  as  one  of  the  main \nconstraints  on  establishing  a  conducive  investment  climate.  The  medium-term  development \nplan sets out a good policy framework for the reforms and investments needed for each sector. \nPolicies  envisaged  under  the  Government\u2019s  medium-term  macroeconomic  framework  should \nthe  business  climate,  and  encourage \nimprove \nhelp  mitigate  economic  vulnerabilities, \ninvestment. An optimistic scenario for the next 5 years is that pending laws and regulations are \nenacted,  encouraging  private  sector  development  and  accelerating  GDP  growth  to  7\u22128%. \nAlternatively, if the country falters in its implementation of policies and fails to unblock funding \nconstraints at the regional level, growth will probably remain below 6%.  \n \n8. \nKey  constraints  on  accelerating  GDP  growth  include  an  absence  of:  (i)  a  stable  and \nconsistent  legal  and  regulatory  environment,  (ii)  well-developed  capital  markets  and  nonbank \nfinancial  sector,  and  (iii)  adequate  skills  and  institutional  capacity  within  public  and  market \ninstitutions. In particular, the 1997 crisis raised awareness of the risks associated with a growth-\noriented development agenda without a deep and diverse financial sector. Indonesia\u2019s banking \nsector has rebounded from the crisis with nonperforming loans (NPLs) reduced and profitability \nand solvency restored. However, bank intermediation is declining, and banks\u2019 reliance on short- \nterm  deposits  makes  them  ill  suited  to  provide  the  long-term  funds  needed  for  a  sustained \nexpansion  of  investment.  The  financial  system  is  still  bank-dominated,  although  increasing \nattention is being paid to the nonbank financial sector. An action plan for the nonbank financial \nsector  was  approved  by  the  Government  in  November  2004  in  consultation  with  ADB.  The \naction  plan  included  measures  to  support  and  implement  the  Government\u2019s  capital  market \nmaster  plan,  2005\u20132009  (CMMP).  The  CMMP  is  principally  focused  on  strengthening  capital \nmarkets by improving surveillance, increasing legal certainty, strengthening the role and quality \nof market players, expanding products, and developing Islamic financial products.    \n \n9. \nFinancial Sector Reforms. Underscoring the priority accorded to achieving a deep and \ndiverse financial sector, a financial sector policy package (FSPP) was introduced in June 2006. \nThis aims to improve policy coordination and to advance the regulation and supervision of both \nbanks  and  nonbank  financial  institutions.  The  FSPP  is  an  annual  exercise  which  reviews \nprogress in a broad set of sectors targeted for reforms, while identifying and setting targets for \nadditional sectors. The Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs, Bank Indonesia, Ministry of \nFinance (MOF), and Ministry of State-Owned Enterprises are signatories to the joint decree for \nimplementing the FSPP. The FSPP complements the CMMP as well as Bank Indonesia\u2019s vision \nof Indonesia\u2019s financial architecture. The Government has signaled its commitment to continuity \nof reforms in this area through the release of another FSSP in 2007.  \n \n10. \nADB  provided  significant  inputs  to  the  preparation  of  the  above  two  financial  sector \npolicy packages. It has also been involved in the Government\u2019s reform process through policy \n\n                                                 \n1 Presidential Regulation 7/2005 on the Medium-Term National Development Plan issued on 19 January 2005. \n2 World Bank Business Survey. 2005. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\ndialogue  and  technical  assistance  (TA).3 The  TA  has  provided  support  to  implement  the  main \nelements of the action plan and the CMMP. These measures have established a good basis for \nfurther  market  development.  While  the  proposed  Program  is  predominantly  focused  on \ndevelopment of the capital market through the implementation of the CMMP, it also embraces \nsome of the broader issues covered under the FSPP. \n \n\nTable 3: Financial Sector Policy Package and Capital Market Master Plan, 2005\u20132009 4 \n \n\ninstitutions  and  policy \n\nCapital Market Master Plan, 2005\u22122009 \nImprove  regulation  and  supervision  of  nonbank \nfinancial sector \n\nFinancial Sector Policy Package \nLaunched  June  2006  as  joint  effort  between  the \nGovernment  and  Bank  Indonesia.

ADB  is  also  involved  in  a  series  of  program  lending \noperations  in  conjunction  with  the  World  Bank\u2019s  development  policy  loans.  These  will  support \nthe Government\u2019s broad-based, cross-cutting, medium-term investment climate and governance \nreform agenda. The first development policy loan was approved by the World Bank in 2004. In \nthat  year,  ADB  provided  parallel  support  through  financial  sector  and  state-owned  enterprise \n(SOE) reform programs. In 2005, at the Government\u2019s request, ADB approved the Development \nPolicy  Support  Program  I  (DPSP  I).5 The  second  DPSP  was  approved  in  2006.6 The  DPSP \nseries  is  embedded  in  the  Government\u2019s  medium-term  national  development  plan  for  2004\u2013\n2009. It supports the broad goal of the plan to stimulate high and sustainable economic growth \n(7% average annual growth by 2009 from about 4% before 2004) and halve poverty incidence \n(from 16.6% in 2004 to 8.2% by 2009). \n \nADB\u2019s  Country  Strategy  and  Program  (CSP). 7  Financial  sector  deepening  that \n12. \nfacilitates  domestic  resource  mobilization  was  identified  as  one  of  the  five  key  areas  for  ADB \nintervention  under  the  CSP  for  2006\u20132009.  The  CSP  recommends  using  a  single-tranche \ncluster approach for program loans to support the Government\u2019s medium-term reform agenda. \nThe CSP also envisages technical assistance in support of these loans.  \n \nThe  proposed  Program  cluster  evolves  from  the  Government\u2019s  medium-term  national \n13. \ndevelopment  plan  to  support  its  financial  sector  reform  agenda  in  line  with  the  CSP,  with  a \nprincipal focus on development of capital markets in Indonesia (Figure 1).  \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2002.

Indonesia\u2019s  financial  sector  has  stabilized  but  continues  to  exhibit \n14. \nstructural vulnerabilities and risks. At an M2-to-GDP ratio of 47% at the end of 2006,8 Indonesia \nlags  behind  regional  competitors  such  as  Malaysia  and  Thailand,  which  have  ratios  of  more \nthan  100%.  Indonesia  has  also  performed  poorly  in  relation  to  its  neighbors  in  terms  of  the \nbreadth  of  its  financial  markets.  The  market  capitalization  of  Asian  equities  has  trebled  since \n1997 and capitalization as a percentage of GDP in Southeast Asian economies such as Hong \nKong,  China;  Malaysia;  and  Singapore  compares  favorably  with  that  in  Germany,  the  United \nKingdom,  and  the  United  States.  In  terms  of  market  value  to  GDP,  despite  increasing  from \n14.5% in 2002 to 37.4% in 2006, Indonesia\u2019s equity market remains one of the smallest in the \nAsia and Pacific region. A more detailed sector analysis is provided in Appendix 2. \n \n15. \nHigh Concentration of Banking Institutions. Banks account for about 80% of financial \nsector assets.9 Despite its size and recent improvements, the Indonesian banking sector is not a \nsource of long-term capital as more than 90% of bank deposits have a maturity of less than 1 \nmonth. As a reaction to the 1997 crisis, bankers in general are risk averse in their approach to \nlending. Banks are reluctant to lend because many large companies are already highly indebted \nand they prefer to keep their funds in risk-free government bonds. As a result, loan levels have \nstayed below deposit levels, making banks very liquid. Much of this liquidity has been invested \nin short-term Bank Indonesia certificates, which have ballooned to a high of Rp190 trillion. \n \nBetter  Risk  Management  in  the  Banking  Industry.  Since  the  NPL  ratio  of  banks \n16. \npeaked at 48% in 1998, the asset quality of commercial banks has recovered. The gross NPL \nratio for the banking industry fell from 7.6% in 2005 to 7% in 2006. The NPL ratio of 15 of the \nlarger banks fell from 10.6% in 2005 to 8.4% in 2006, while those of the other banks are in the \nrange  of  3\u20134%.  The  Government  has  recently  issued  regulations  providing  more  flexibility  for \nstate  banks  to  write  off  their  bad  loans,  so  NPLs  for  state  banks  should  decline  in  future. \nStronger  corporate  balance  sheets,  including  less  reliance  on  external  financing,  have  also \nreduced risks. The average capital adequacy ratio at about 20% in the banking industry is well \nabove  the  prescribed  prudential  norm.  Bank  Indonesia\u2019s  vision  of  Indonesia\u2019s  financial \narchitecture envisages consolidation in the banking industry through a reduction in the number \nof commercial banks from 130 to 80. Banking risk is moderate and controllable because of high \ncapital  adequacy  ratios,  improvements  in  the  payment  system,  the  introduction  of  a  financial \nsector  safety  net,  better  risk  management  practices,  and  stronger  corporate  governance. \nIndonesia\u2019s improvements to risk management are in line with the implementation of Basel II10 \nplanned for 2008.  \n \nUndeveloped  Nonbank  Financial  Subsector.  The  nonbank  financial  subsector  still \n17. \naccounts for only 20% of total financial assets. The sector includes mutual funds (also known as \ninvestment  companies),  insurance  companies,  pension  funds,  securities  brokers  and  dealers, \npawnshops,  rural  institutions,  and  venture  capital  companies.  In  2005,  the  nonbank  financial \nsector  accounted  for  Rp375  trillion  in  assets  (13.7%  of  GDP).  Pension  funds  and  insurance \nfirms account for about half of these assets. \n                                                 \n8   The  M2-to-GDP  ratio  (that  is  demand,  savings,  and  time  deposits  or  M2,  divided  by  the  output  of  goods  and \n\nservices, namely GDP) is a common measure of financial depth. \n\n9  Appendix 2, Table A2.3. \n10 Recommendations on banking laws and regulations issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7 \n\nNeed  for  Stronger  Governance  and  Regulatory  Regime. Financial sector regulation \n18. \nand supervision are under the authority of two main supervisory authorities. Banks are regulated \nand  supervised  by  Bank  Indonesia,  the  central  bank,  which  in  the  aftermath  of  1997  has \nundergone  significant  strengthening  and  has  been  given  financial  and  operational  autonomy. \nThe  Capital  Markets  Supervisory  Agency  (Bapepam),  established  in  1976  under  Presidential \nDecree No. 52/1976, has weaker powers and capacity. It is responsible for the regulation and \nday-to-day  supervision  of  capital  markets  in  Indonesia  and  reports  to  the  MOF.  The  MOF  is \nresponsible  for  high-level  policy  matters  and  Bapepam  has  some  autonomy  in  relation  to  the \nconduct of investigations, inspections, and other regulatory functions.  \n \n19. \nIn  1999,  parliament  passed  a  Banking  Law  to  insulate  the  regulatory  and  supervisory \nframework  from  political  interference.  The  legislation  required  the  establishment  of  a \nconsolidated  supervisory  authority  for  financial  services,  referred  to  as  the  Consolidated \nSupervisory Authority for Financial Services (OJK) by the end of 2002, to be able to cope better \nwith  financial  conglomeration  and  innovation  and  to  lower  the  cost  of  regulation  by  making \nefficient use of scarce resources.  \n \n20. \nHowever,  prudential  regulation  of  banks  focusing  on  their  safety  and  soundness  and \nsystemic risk is fundamentally different from the investor protection needs of securities or capital \nmarkets,  which  are  focused  on  disclosure,  fairness,  and  prevention  of  fraud  through \nenforcement of business rules and punishment of offenders. As became evident following 1999, \nmerging  the  two  different  approaches  and  cultures  poses  significant  challenges,  not  least  of \nwhich  is  the  need  to  manage  the  risks  of  a  decline  in  the  quality  of  supervision  during  the \ntransition phase. This challenge is made more complex in Indonesia where the two entities to be \nmerged  differed  sharply  in  capacity  and  where  systemic  risks  remain  a  key  concern. \nRecognizing  these  risks,  parliament  amended  the  Banking  Law  in  December  2003,  thereby \npostponing the establishment of the OJK from 2002 to 2010. In the meantime, MOF prepared \nan action plan to improve the regulation and supervision of the nonbank financial sector in 2004. \nThe  insurance,  pension,  finance,  and  venture  capital  companies  were  to  be  regulated  by  the \nDirectorate General of Financial Institutions (DGFI) in the MOF until 2005, when a presidential \ndecree  merging  Bapepam  and  DGFI  was  issued.  MOF  merged  Bapepam  and  the  DGFI  into \nBapepam-LK as the sole regulatory and supervisory authority for the nonbank financial sector. \nThe merger and the endorsement of a plan for improvements in the regulatory and supervisory \nstructure  of  the  newly  created  Bapepam-LK  were  significant  steps  toward  strengthening \nsupervision of nonbank financial services, including the capital markets. A senior (echelon 1)11 \nofficial  has  been  appointed  to  head  the  merged  entity,  paving  the  way  for  a  consolidation  of \nnonbank  financial  institution  supervision.  Bapepam-LK  is  working  to  improve  the  operation  of \nthe merged regulators and to increase the capacity of its staff. Both the Australian Agency for \nInternational Development (AusAID) and ADB are supporting this transformation and providing \ntraining and human resource development assistance to Bapepam-LK. The Minister of Finance \nsupports further strengthening of Bapepam-LK\u2019s financial and operational autonomy.  \n \n21. \nShallow  Equity  Market.  Indonesia\u2019s  equity  market  has  improved  steadily  since  2002 \nand was among the best performers in the region in 2004 and 2005. In 2006, it was among the \ntop three bourses in the world with a growth of about 50% in market capitalization. However, the \nIndonesian  capital  market  is  the  second  smallest  capital  market  in  Southeast  Asia  (only  the \nPhilippines is smaller). In terms of market value to GDP, despite increasing from 14.5% in 2002 \n\n                                                 \n11  All structural positions in Indonesia\u2019s national civil service are grouped into echelons, with echelon 1 being the most \n\nsenior. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nto 37.4% in 2006, Indonesia\u2019s equity market remains one of the smallest in the Asia and Pacific \nregion. The number of companies listed gradually increased to 344 at the end of 2006, but this \nis still low by regional standards (Malaysia had 1,025 listed domestic companies at the end of \n2006;  Taipei,China  693;  Thailand  518;  and  the  Philippines  241).  Although  the  number  of \ncompanies  involved  is  small,  both  the  volume  and  value  of  shares  traded  in  Indonesia  and \nmarket capitalization as a share of GDP have increased significantly since 2002.  \n \n22. \nPromising  Fixed  Income  Market.  Although  the  capital  market  remains  small  and \nilliquid,  Indonesia  has  issued  significant  volumes  of  government  bonds.  These  dominate  the \nmarket, there had been 56 issues by the end of 2006 with a market value of Rp419 trillion. The \ncorporate bond market by comparison had seen 236 issues at end-2006 with a market value of \nRp62  trillion.  Government  bonds  represent  about  13.3%  of  GDP  (end-2006)  and  corporate \nbonds  about  1.9%\u2014low  by  the  standards  of  neighboring  countries.  Government  bonds \ncomprise a mix of floating and fixed rate bonds\u2014the recent preference of Bank Indonesia being \nfor  fixed  rate  bonds.  Bank  Indonesia  has  followed  a  strategy  of  consolidating  bond  issues\u2014\nthrough  buy-backs  and  asset  swaps\u2014and  has  sought  to  build  benchmark  issues.  Current \nmaturities  go  out  to  20  years\u2014a  considerable  extension  of  maturity  since  2000.  The  Debt \nManagement  Office  (DMO)  issued  its  first  treasury  bills  in  June  2007  with  a  12-month  tenor. \nBanks  hold  about  three  quarters  of  government  bonds  by  value.  Retail  investors  are  largely \nabsent. A system of primary dealers was introduced in December 2006 and these dealers are \nexpected to provide two-way quotes. In the secondary market, an over-the-counter market and \nthe exchange market co-exist, both offering avenues for trading of all debt securities.  \n \n23. \nIssues  of  Governance  and  Capitalization  in  Contractual  Savings.  The  insurance \nindustry is small in terms of the ratio of premiums to GDP (1.8\u20132% for life insurance and 0.62% \nfor general insurance). It is also characterized by a large number of companies and a relatively \nlow  level  of  capitalization.  Insurance  companies  currently  invest  an  estimated  25%  of  their \nassets  in  short-term  deposits.  The  Government  has  introduced  some  important  regulatory \nchanges  governing  insurers  since  the  Asian  financial  crisis,  including  a  new  risk-weighted \ncapital adequacy regime to encourage mergers and an increase in the capital requirements for \nnew insurance companies. Existing insurance firms have been allowed a grace period to meet \nthese requirements.  \n \n24. \nThe  pension  sector  is  still  small  and  characterized  by  low  coverage  and  limited \ncapitalization.  Four  main  types  of  funds  dominate  the  pension  sector.  Jamsostek  is  a \nmandatory,  publicly-managed  fund  to  which  all  formal  sector  employers  and  employees \ncontribute. Taspen is a publicly-managed pension fund for civil servants. There are two types of \nprivately-managed funds\u2014employer pension funds and financial institution pension funds\u2014both \nof  which  are  voluntary  occupation schemes  for  private  sector  employees.  These  schemes  are \npotentially important to pool financial resources and to diversify their investor base, but there are \nlegal  and  regulatory  impediments  to  this.  Bapepam-LK  oversees  the  voluntary  pension \nschemes. In total, the pension industry controls 4.7% of GDP in assets, compared with Thailand \n(8.4%), Malaysia (57%), and Australia (75%). About half of the assets are in public programs, \nand half in private programs.  \n \n25.  Market  Infrastructure  and  Investor  Protection.  Indonesia\u2019s  two  principal  exchanges, \nthe  Jakarta  Stock  Exchange  (JSX)  and  the  Surabaya  Stock  Exchange  (SSX),  trade  equities, \nbonds, share options and index futures. The SSX focuses on the trading of bonds and futures, \ninstruments  that  JSX  cannot  handle.  However,  the  two  exchanges  compete  for  listings  and \nmany companies are listed on both exchanges. A merger of the two exchanges is included in \nthe CMMP and the 2006 FSPP. In addition, Indonesia has two systems for clearing, settlement, \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9 \n\nand deposits: the Indonesian Central Securities Depository (KSEI), and the Indonesian Clearing \nand Guarantee Corporation (KPEI). JSX, SSX, KSEI, and KPEI are self-regulating organizations \nwith the authority to set rules and oversee the activities of broker-dealers and custodian banks \ndealing in securities and bond trading. There are 125 securities broking companies in Indonesia. \nWith regard to rating agencies, Pefindo is Indonesia\u2019s largest and was established in 1994. It is \nan  affiliate  of  Standard  and  Poor\u2019s  and  has  adapted  its  rating  methodology.  The  only  other \nrating agency is Kasnic Credit Rating Indonesia, incorporated in 1998. Kasnic is affiliated with \nFitch through its shareholder Duff and Phelps. It focuses on asset-backed securities, including \nplans for securitized mortgages, which have not yet been developed in Indonesia. Development \nof the financial sector and the capital markets in particular is hampered by an inability to obtain \nand/or  enforce  timely  commercial  judgments.  Support  has  been  provided  to  the  judiciary  by \nother agencies to enhance its capacity (Appendix 3) but more assistance is required.  \n \n26. \nNeed  for  Stronger  Corporate  Governance.  In  March  2005,  a  World  Bank  review \nassessed  the  extent  to  which  corporate  governance  in  Indonesia  was  in  conformity  with \nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) standards. It concluded that \na number of initiatives are underway that could eventually result in compliance with the OECD \nprinciples. However,  practices  and enforcement  diverge.  ADB  has  supported  the  development \nof  a  corporate  governance  code  for  state-owned  enterprises  and  a  strengthening  of  the \ngovernance  standards  under  the  listing  requirements  for  the  JSX. 12  Guidelines  to  improve \nperformance and corporate governance at state-owned banks was issued in February 2007.  \n \n27. \nSharia-Based  Capital  Market  Products.  Islamic  finance  in  Indonesia  is  newer  than \nconventional  finance,  but  has  grown  rapidly.  Bank  Indonesia  has  developed  a  blueprint  for \nsharia  banking  derived  from  Islamic  values.  Sharia-based  capital  market  products  were  first \nintroduced in Indonesia by a sharia investment fund in mid-1997. At the end of 2006, there were \n20 sharia investment funds (5% of total investment funds in Indonesia). As of December 2006, \nthe total net asset value of these funds was Rp664 billion (1.3% of the total net asset value of \ninvestment  funds  in  Indonesia),  18.7%  higher  than  in  2005.  The  Government  plans  to  issue  a \nnew  sharia  bond  called  sukuks  once  the  draft  bill  on  sharia-based  instruments  that  was \nsubmitted to the parliament in February 2007 is passed.  \n \nNeed  for  Coordinated  Supervision.  There  is  a  global  trend  toward  financial \n28. \nconglomerates, and a tendency for banks and other financial institutions to compete in the same \nmarket  segments.  There  is  therefore  a  need  for  consolidated  and  coordinated  supervision  to \nprevent regulatory arbitrage by important institutions. Bank Indonesia has adopted consolidated \nsupervision  of  financial  groups  and  their  subsidiaries,  but  there  is  also  a  need  for  information \nsharing  and  cooperation  with  Bapepam-LK  in  relation  to  entities  that  are  covered  by  both \nregulators.  Such  cooperation  mechanisms  are  common  in  other  jurisdictions  (e.g.,  the  United \nStates) and need to be extended to other supervisors such as the Deposit Insurance Institution \n(LPS).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n12   ADB  2001.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nB. \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n \n\n1. \n\nEnhance Price Information and Price Discovery  \n\n29. \nFinancial sector reforms are crucial to raising Indonesia\u2019s growth rate and to enhancing \nthe  economy\u2019s  resilience.  Since  1997  Indonesia  has  successfully  undertaken  key  financial \nreforms,  restoring  the  banking  sector  to  solvency  and  profitability.  However,  economic  growth \nhas not returned to pre-crisis levels. Indonesia needs investments, especially in infrastructure, \nbut the domestic financial sector is not yet able to finance them. The financial sector is shallow \nand  dominated  by  banks.  Bank  lending  has  not  yet  recovered  to  pre-crisis  levels  and  banks\u2019 \nbalance sheets make them unsuited to the nation\u2019s need for long-term financing. The nonbank \nfinancial sector, in particular, the capital markets, although still small, offer a major opportunity \nto reinvigorate growth thorough more efficient intermediation.   \n \nTransparency and information disclosure have to be strengthened to build confidence in \n30. \ncapital markets and institutions, facilitate regulatory oversight, and promote price discovery and \nmarket liquidity. The supply and demand sides of financial markets both need to be addressed. \nOn  the  supply  side,  the  government  bond  market  needs  to  be  deepened  as  it  is  an  essential \nbuilding block for the corporate bond and the interbank money  markets. On the demand side, \nthe  investor  base  needs  to  be  broadened  by  encouraging  institutional  investors  such  as \ncontractual  savings  and  collective  investment  schemes.  The  structure  for  trading  of  securities \nhas to be strengthened to make markets fast, efficient, and accountable. Finally, the operational \nand financial autonomy of the regulatory and supervisory authorities needs to be strengthened \nto protect investors. \n \n \n \n31. \nThe Indonesian debt market has long suffered from a lack of price transparency in both \ngovernment  and  corporate  bonds  and  no  entity  is  able  to  offer  a  credible  and  reliable  fair \nvaluation service to the overall market. Availability of reliable and timely information is critical for \ncapital markets to function efficiently and for the prices to reflect the fundamentals. The OECD \nprinciples  of  good  governance  suggest  that  firms  should  disclose  all  material  information  in \naccordance  with  high  standards  of  accounting  and  financial  and  nonfinancial  disclosure. \nPreviously, there was no mandatory post-trade reporting regulation for market participants in the \ngovernment and corporate bond markets and no mechanisms to enable consolidation of market \ndata or provision of real time information. Prior to November 2007, SSX provided an over-the- \ncounter  fixed  income  trading  system  that  can  be  used  to  quote  prices,  review  product \ninformation, and facilitate negotiation and trade reporting for government and corporate bonds \nbut the dealers had few incentives to use the system. Effective November 2007, the over-the- \ncounter  fixed  income  trading  system  has  been  replaced  by  a  centralized  trading  platform. \nDisclosure  is  generally  weak  for  corporate  bonds  and  enforcement  of  disclosure  requirements \nhas  not  been  sufficiently  rigorous.  Despite  the  extensive  rules  governing  mutual  funds, \ndisclosure  in  the  areas  of  investment  policy  and  the  calculation  of  net  asset  value  and  sales \nprocedures is inadequate. Many of the largest mutual funds do not follow the norms of valuation \nestablished by Bapepam-LK. Although listed companies adhere to the regular reporting of their \nfinancial results, there is still considerable room for improving the prompt disclosure of market-\nsensitive information and for strengthening the scope and content of disclosure. \n \n \n \nThe markets are smaller and the secondary markets are less liquid than those of most \n32. \nother Southeast Asian economies (para. 21). The market value more than trebled between 2000 \nand  2005  to  $81  billion,  but  this  was  not  a  significant  increase  over  the  1999  market \n\nDevelop Deeper and More Liquid Capital Markets \n\n2.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n11 \n\ncapitalization  of  $64  billion.  While  2006  saw  a  sharp  increase  to  $139  billion,  Indonesia  still \nremains the fourth smallest market in the Asia and Pacific region. The biggest constraint on the \ndevelopment of the bond markets is the limited liquidity in the secondary markets\u2014which affects \nthe  efficiency  of  the  market  overall.  Against  this  background,  Indonesia  faces  two  challenges: \nfirst, catching up with its neighbors; and second, ensuring that it is able to participate in ongoing \nefforts to integrate regional markets and economies.  \n \n33. \nIssuance  and  Market  for  Corporate  and  Government  Debt  Securities.  The \nIndonesian  corporate  bond  market  is  still  at  its  infancy  and  is  heavily  dependent  on  bank \nfinance.  While  the  small  corporate  bond  market  has  grown,  the  lack  of  a  clear  benchmark  to \nprice  against  hinders  pricing,  although  improvements  in  government  bond  issuance  are \nexpected  to  address  this.  However,  the  Indonesian  government  bond  market  suffers  from \nunequal market access, unequal transactional costs, skewed product distribution, and a lack of \nbenchmark securities. The timetable for the issuance of government bonds is not published in \nadvance  and  Bank  Indonesia  does not  act  as  a  price  taker.  It  has  rejected  bids  and  canceled \nauctions. This increases the risk to participants, which increases the cost of debt and reduces \nthe attractiveness of the market. The lack of market making by intermediaries and the absence \nof  credible  benchmarks  (in  short-,  medium-,  and  long-term  securities)  or  any  form  of  hedging \nmechanism  have  affected  overall  price  formation.  In  2006,  on  average  the  Indonesian  bond \nmarket  experienced  a  daily  spread  of  70\u2013100  basis  points,  one  of  the  highest  in  emerging \nmarkets.  A  lack  of  inter-agency  policy  coordination  hampers  overall  development  and  adds \nmarket distortions. \n \n34. \nAnother issue that affects market efficiency is the Bank Indonesia\u2019s scripless securities \nsettlement system, which undertakes the depository activity for government bonds but does not \nprovide  access  for  nonbanking  institutions  who  are  not  subregistries.  The  level  of  system \nintegration  with  the  subregistries  is  poor  and  contributes  heavily  to  operational  costs  and  the \nlack  of  straight-through  processing  capabilities  for  the  market  as  a  whole.  Issuance  of \ngovernment securities would improve with a coherent policy for debt issuance, a proper primary \ndealer system, and infrastructure to support the primary and secondary market for government \ndebt  securities.  ADB  is  providing  TA  to  Bapepam-LK  (footnote  3)  to  create  a  more  liquid, \ntransparent and competitive bond market with greater and more harmonized access throughout \nthe industry.  \n \n35. \nRepurchase markets. The Indonesian Government began a repurchase market in 2004 \nand  launched  a  master  repurchase  agreement  in  2005.  However,  market  participants  have \nmajor  issues  with  the  agreement  as  there  is  a  lack  of  clarity  with  regard  to  its  terms  and \nconditions and the extent to which parties can exercise their rights in the event of default by a \ncounterparty.  As  of  June  2006,  only  five  institutions  had  executed  the  master  repurchase \nagreement to facilitate repurchasing transactions. Another key hurdle is the master repurchase \nagreement structure, which is based on a sale and buy-back with full legal transfer of securities, \nresulting in the participants being taxed at both stages of the transaction.  \n \n36.  Market  Liquidity.    In  2006,  of  the  344  listed  companies,  8%  (29  companies)  had  no \ntrade  at  all  while  55%  (189  companies)  accounted  for  less  than  0.1%  of  the  total  trading \nfrequency  on  the  JSX.  The  key  reasons  for  the  illiquidity  of  these  shares  are:  concentrated \nshare ownership causing minimum real free float, an absence of corporate action plans, weak \ninvestor relations, and insufficient provision of information to the public. As a consequence the \nmarket  remains  small  and  illiquid  and  this  restricts  the  development  of  domestic  institutional \ninvestors. The process of listing in Indonesia is unnecessarily cumbersome and time-consuming \nand  companies  have  few  incentives  to  list.  Taxation  has  been  a  major  issue,  as  unequal  tax \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\ninstitutions  has  significantly  affected \n\nthe  overall  participation  of  market \ntreatment  of \nintermediaries, especially securities firms. Stock option products were launched 2 years ago but \ndid not find much favor with the market as the rules were not considered attractive. \n \nIt will be important for Indonesia\u2019s capital market to develop supporting infrastructure. In \n37. \naddition to repurchase markets (para. 35), securities lending, margin trading (in particular, short \nselling),  and  a  derivatives  market  need  to  be  developed.  The  lack  of  these  instruments  and \nfacilities  reduces  liquidity  and  increases  the  transaction  costs  of  trading.  Liquidity  will  also  be \nimproved  through  measures  to  widen  the  investor  base,  in  part  through  encouraging  the \nintroduction  of  different  types  of  products  to  suit  the  different  risk  preferences  of  investors. \nThese \nfunds,  municipal  bonds,  asset-  and  mortgage-backed \nsecurities,  and  sharia  products.  There  were  no  significant  government  divestments  of  state-\nowned  enterprises  in  2005  and  2006.  There  needs  to  be  a  focused  strategy  and  plan  for  the \ndivestment of the Government\u2019s ownership of SOEs in order to increase the supply of securities \nto the capital market. Private pension funds would also benefit from better asset allocation and \ninvestment policies and lower costs.  \n \n\ninclude  exchange-traded \n\nFigure 2: Efficiency of the Indonesian Securities Markets \n \nLiquidity \n\nA \nInformation to \nprice accurately \n\nB\nTransaction costs  \n(explicit taxes, commissions, \nfees and impact) \n\nC\nInvestor base very low \nInstitutional investors limited \nSavings rate low at 25% \nFree float very small \nNot many listed companies \n\nTransaction costs high \ncompared with other \nregional exchanges \n\n\u2022  90% of the bonds traded \n\nare government securities \n\nCorporate \nGovernance\n\n\u2022  Crowding out other \n\ninstruments \n\n\u2022  True yield curve yet to \n\nemerge \n\n\u2022  Plan to establish Bond \n\nPricing Agency \n\n\u2022  Dealers mostly banks \n\u2022  Need to improve \n\ntransparency in pricing \n\u2022  One credit-rating agency \n\u2022  Limited issues of private \n\ndebt papers \n\n\u2022  Disclosure needs \nimprovement \n\n\u2022  High concentrated \nownership of the \npublicly listed \ncorporate sector \n\n\u2022  Limited float \n\u2022  Low corporate \ngovernance \n\n\u2022  Minority shareholders \n\nneed legal \nempowerment \n\n\u2022  Bankruptcy law needs \n\nrevision \n\nMarket  Infrastructure \nand Mechanisms\n\nComplementary \nStructure\n\n\u2022  Mutual exchange \n\n\u2022  Short \n\nstructure \n\n\u2022  Settlement T+3 \n\n(3 days after the    \ndate of trade) \n\n\u2022  No investor \n\nprotection fund \n\nselling/margin \ntrading needs \nrevision \n\u2022  Not many \nhedging \ninstruments \n\u2022  Not so very \n\nconducive tax \nenvironment \n\n38.  Mutual Exchange Structure. The mutual structure plus the existence of two competing \nexchanges  without  clear  roles  suggests  that  the  exchanges  will  be  slow  to  innovate  and  to \nrespond  to  investor  and  issuer  needs  and  that  they  will  regulate  poorly.  Mutual  structures  are \ngenerally  recognized  to  be  a  poor  governance  structure  for  modern  exchanges.  An  exchange \noffering all exchange-traded products and run as a commercial company\u2014ideally with its own \nlisting\u2014would  serve  the  Indonesian  market  better.  A  feasibility  study  on  a  possible  merger  of \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n13 \n\n3. \n\nImprove Market Surveillance and Investor Protection \n\nthe  two  exchanges  revealed  that  it  makes  business  sense  for  them  to  merge,  and  that  this \nwould  improve  governance  and  lead  to  savings  through  shared  information  technology  and \nhuman resources.  \n \n \n \n39. \nRegulatory  Structure.  A  strong  Bapepam-LK  is  needed  for  a  coherent  policy  and \nregulatory  approach  to  the  nonbank  financial  sector.  However,  Bapepam-LK  is  still  part  of  the \nMOF and does not have the same autonomy or human resource capacity as Bank Indonesia. A \ncrisis  in  the  mutual  fund  industry  in  2005  revealed  the  consequences  of  weak  regulation, \nalthough  swift  and  resolute  action  by  Bapepam-LK  prevented  a  more  serious  crisis.  A  better \nresourced and more autonomous regulator of nonbank financial institutions is needed before the \nestablishment  of  the  OJK  in  2010.  The  merger  of  Bapepam  and  DGFI  to  form  Bapepam-LK \noffers an opportunity to create such a strong and independent regulator. Bapepam-LK staff lack \nlegal  immunity  when  carrying  out  their  supervisory  functions.  Revisions  to  the  Capital  Market, \nPension  and  Insurance  Laws  also  need  to  be  accelerated  so  legislation  complies  with \nInternational  Organization  of  Securities  Commissions  (IOSCO)  principles  for  securities, \nInternational  Association  of  Insurance  Supervisors  core  principles,  and  OECD  guidelines  for \noccupational  pensions.  Major  steps  are  also  being  undertaken  to  strengthen  the  integrity  of \npublic  institutions  such  as  MOF  and  Bapepam-LK  through  major  restructuring  of  key \ndepartments,  combined  with  significant  pay  increases  for  staff  and  the  introduction  of  strict \nperformance and ethical standards. \n \n40. \nRegulation  and  Supervision.  The  legal  and  regulatory  environment  for  mutual  funds \nneeds  to  be  improved.  The  legislation  is  an  amalgam  of  US  regulations  for  corporate  funds \n(which do not exist in Indonesia) with a few references to contractual funds (i.e., all mutual funds \nin  Indonesia).  The  sections  of  the  Capital  Market  Law  that  pertain  to  mutual  funds  and  the \nassociated  regulations  need  to  be  amended  in  order  to  restore  investor  confidence  in  mutual \nfunds  following  the  recent  crisis  and  to  develop  the  industry.  Bapepam-LK\u2019s  investigation \nprocedures  need  to  be  streamlined  and  the  flow  of  information  improved  so  administrative \nsanctions can be imposed more easily. For suspected criminal offences, better coordination and \ncooperation  with  the  judicial  branch  is  needed.  To  strengthen  its  internal  governance  and \naccountability  Bapepam-LK  needs  to  establish  an  internal  compliance  bureau  with  a  code  of \nconduct for officials and staff. Bapepam-LK\u2019s organizational structure needs to move toward a \nmore  functional  approach  to  address  gaps  in  regulatory  and  supervisory  oversight  and  to \nharmonize regulation and supervision.  \n \n41. \nInvestor  Protection.  Indonesia  does  not  have  an  investor  protection  fund  to  protect \ninvestors in the event of broker default. The rules require securities firms to take out insurance \nto cover this eventuality but such insurance is not available and the rule has not been enforced. \nThis  exposes  investors  to  significant  risk  and  is  likely  to  deter  investors  of  all  sizes  from \nparticipating in the market. Investor protection funds are typically built up by contributions from \nbrokers. \n \nInternational  Cooperation.  Bapepam-LK  has  entered  into  bilateral  arrangements  with \n42. \ndomestic  and  foreign  regulators  and  is  seeking  membership  of  the  IOSCO  multilateral \nmemorandum  of  understanding.  However,  it  is  currently  prevented  from  joining  because  of  a \nlack of legal clarity with regard to its powers to (i) share confidential data with other regulators, \n(ii)  access  bank  records  and  identify  beneficial  ownership  of  shares,  and  (iii)  guarantee \nconfidentiality  of  requests  from  foreign  regulators.  Bilateral  MOUs  with  foreign  capital  markets \nregulators will help strengthen information sharing.   \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n \n\n4. \n\nImprove Governance and Human Resource Capacity \n\nRisk-based Supervision in Contractual Savings Industry. In 2000 Indonesia became \n43. \nthe  first  country  in  Asia to  implement  modern  risk-based capital  requirements  for  both  life  and \ngeneral  insurers.  The  Bureau  of  Insurance  has  been  moving  toward  risk-based  supervision \nalthough  more  rapid  progress  is  necessary.  Implementation  of  risk-based  capital  regulations \nneed to be reviewed and corporate governance standards enforced. The pension industry also \nneeds to move toward risk-based supervision. \n \n \n \n44. \nCoordination  among  Regulators.  If  there  is  more  than  one  regulator,  each  needs  to \nhave very clear and precise objectives, be subject to extensive disclosure requirements, and be \npublicly accountable.\nThere also need to be adequate arrangements, preferably documented, to \nensure  the  regulators  cooperate  when  necessary,  and  that  they  have  powers  to  exchange \nrelevant  information.  Incentives  for  regulatory  arbitrage  should  be  recognized  and  minimized, \nand  regulatory  gaps  spotted  and  filled  at  an  early  stage.  Formal  coordination  between  Bank \nIndonesia, the MOF, and the Deposit Insurance Institution (LPS) needs to be clearly outlined to \nprevent potential risks to the system\u2019s stability. \n \n45. \nAnti-Money-Laundering  Regime.  While  considerable  progress  has  been  made  in \nstrengthening  the  anti-money-laundering  regime  for  the  banking  sector,  the  nonbank  financial \nsector in Indonesia currently lags in comparison, in terms of the effectiveness of regulations and \nsupervision, as well as in the capacity of institutions to comply with the law. To reduce the risk of \nnonbank  financial  institutions  being  used  as  conduits  for  money  laundering,  regulations, \nsupervision  (capacity,  enforcement  powers,  and  sanctions),  and  capacity  for  compliance  will \nneed to be strengthened to achieve parity with the banking sector.  \n \n46. \nInstitutional  Capacity.  The  newly  created  Bapepam-LK  will  require  support  over  the \nmedium  term  for  it  to  become  an  effective  regulator.  Governance  of  regulatory  agencies  and \nmarket institutions requires staff with graduate level education in actuarial science and finance \nand experience in regulatory practices and market surveillance in developed markets. Acquiring \nthese  skills  is  a  pre-condition  for  success  but  will  be  a  major  challenge,  requiring  the \nGovernment  to  commit  adequate  resources  over  the  medium  and  long  term  if  technical  and \nregulatory excellence is to be achieved. \n  \nC. \n \nADB\u2019s  Financial  Sector  Intervention  in  Indonesia.  ADB  has  undertaken  four  major \n47. \nfinancial  sector  operations  in  Indonesia  addressing  banking,  capital  markets,  pensions,  and \ninsurance over the last 19 years. The thrust of financial sector reforms over this period moved \nfrom  a  focus  on  deregulation  of  the  banking  sector  and  capital  market  to  implementation  of  a \ncomprehensive  set  of  reforms  aimed  at  strengthening  potential  safeguards  while  encouraging \nmarket forces and market efficiency. The rapid growth that occurred after deregulation and the \nsubsequent  problems  in  the  banking  sector  highlighted  inadequacies  in  the  legal,  regulatory, \nand  supervisory  frameworks,  while  underpinning  the  importance  of  a  long-term  approach  to \nstrengthening capacity. \n \n\nLessons \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15 \n\nFirst and Second Financial Sector Program (1988 and 1992).13 The first program was \n48. \naimed  at  improving  domestic  resource  mobilization  by  the  financial  sector,  reducing  market \nsegmentation,  and  encouraging  competition  among  financial  institutions,  while  ensuring  the \nsoundness of the financial system. The main objectives of the second program were to ensure \nthe long-term strength and stability of the financial system by introducing prudential safeguards \nand creating and strengthening basic legal, regulatory, and supervisory frameworks. \n \nFinancial  Governance  Reforms  Sector  Development  Program  (FGRSDP).14 ADB\u2019s \n49. \nsupport to the financial sector was an integral part of an IMF-led multidonor rescue package to \nhelp  Indonesia  overcome  the  Asian  financial  crisis.  The  intent  of  the  program  was  to  help \nIndonesia respond to the immediate exigencies of the crisis, as well as to reduce the country\u2019s \nvulnerability to future crises. FGRSDP made significant progress in improving the governance of \nfinancial and public sector allocation of resources. Despite delays in implementation, the policy \nmeasures supported by FGRSDP helped restore financial sector health through consolidation of \nstate-owned banks, closure of insolvent private banks, recapitalization of viable banks, and the \ntransfer  of  nonperforming  loans  to  the  Indonesian  Bank  Restructuring  Agency.  Through \nFGRSDP, ADB was one of Indonesia's key development partners throughout the crisis, and the \nprogram  provided  an  essential  platform  for  continuing  policy  dialogue  at  the  highest  level. \nFGRSDP  was  rated  as  successful. 15  However,  continued  weaknesses  in  financial  sector \ngovernance have undermined the potential for higher growth. \n \nFinancial  Governance  and  Social  Security  Reform  Program  (FGSSR  2002).16 In \n50. \n1999,  parliament  passed  a  Banking  Law  which  was  pivotal  in  insulating  the  regulatory  and \nsupervisory  framework  from  political  interference.  In  2000,  the  Government  asked  ADB  to \nsupport  the  development  of  a  blueprint  for  an  integrated  financial  services  supervisory \ninstitution,  referred  to  as  the  OJK,  to  make  efficient  use  of  scarce  regulatory  resources  and \nstrengthen  harmonization  of \nthe \nestablishment of the OJK by the end of 2002. The FGSSR was broadly conceived to support the \neffective  implementation  of  nonbank  financial  sector  reform,  including  establishing  the  OJK, \nrestructuring  pension  plans,  amending  relevant  laws  and  regulations,  and  consolidating  the \ninsurance sector. \n \nFGSSR-I  has  been  partly  effective  in  achieving  its  goals,  although  OJK  in  its  intended \n51. \nform remains a medium-term objective (paras. 18\u201320). The merger of Bapepam and the DGFI \ninto Bapepam-LK, and the endorsement of a plan for continuing improvements in the regulatory \nand supervisory structure of the newly created entity are significant steps towards strengthening \nthe supervision of nonbank financial services. Market participants see these as positive moves \nthat  will  facilitate  supervision  along  functional  lines  and  encourage  greater  participation  by \ninstitutional  investors  in  capital  markets.  However,  continued  capacity  building  is  required  and \nthe legal framework for enforcement needs to be further improved. \n\nregulation  across  sectors.

ADB TA (footnote 3) has focused on strengthening \n52. \nBapepam-LK,  and  provided  support  for  the  preparation  of  a  nonbank  financial  sector  action \nplan,  an  assessment  of  Indonesian  standards  in  meeting  IOSCO  principles  for  capital  market \nregulation,  and  evaluation  of  training  needs  within  Bapepam-LK.  It  has  also  supported  the \ndevelopment  of  the  bond  market,  improvements  to  the  research  and  surveillance  functions  of \nBapepam-LK,  and  the  preparation  of  regulations  and  guidelines  for  Islamic  financial  products. \nThe  measures  included  under  the  program  reflect  extensive  dialogue,  including  a  major \nworkshop on key issues and findings from the TA in Jakarta in November 2006.   \n \n53. \nLessons  Learned.  Broadly-based  reforms  require  long-term  institutional  development \nand  must  be  fully  aligned  with  the  Government\u2019s  national  and  sector  development  plans.  The \nprogram  cluster  approach  is  a  useful  tool  in  this  regard,  as  it  combines  a  long-term  approach \ncovering a wide range of policy and institutional reforms and with flexibility to adjust to changing \ncircumstances. It allows the gradual introduction of critical components in the sector, including a \ncomprehensive  legal  framework  and  an  action  plan.  Program  clusters  can  also  enable \nbenchmarks  to  be  established  and  unify  policy  makers  who  advocate  reforms.  The  program \ncompletion  report  (PCR) 17 for  FGSSR  recommended  a  framework  based  on  single-tranche \nprograms within a program loan cluster to provide more flexibility while focusing on achievable, \nupfront  outcomes.  Much  of  the  success  of  such  an  approach  will  depend  on  a  genuine \ncommitment by stakeholders. The Indonesia country assistance program evaluation18 noted that \nthe ADB financial sector projects and programs in Indonesia have generally performed well.  \n \n54. \nThese  key  lessons  demonstrate  the  importance  of  (i)  a  medium-term  policy  framework \nsupported  by  a  program  cluster  and  tranching  structure  that  ensures  adequate  time  and \nflexibility  in  formulation  and  implementation  of  a  reform  agenda;  (ii)  participatory  dialogue;  \n(iii)  the  emergence  of  a  stakeholder  voice  and  a  reform  champion;  and  (iv)  TA  design  that \nensures adequate resources are made available for a sufficient duration, with a view not only to \ndeveloping  policy  recommendations,  but  also  to  supporting  implementation.  The  Program  is  a \nmedium-term  program  cluster  that  reflects  (i)  ADB\u2019s  confidence  in  the  Government\u2019s \ncommitment  to  a  medium-term  agenda  in  which  it  has  ownership;  (ii)  a  focus  on  a  broad \nassessment  of  progress  and  the  implementation  capacity  of  the  authorities,  rather  than  on \ntraditional conditions; and (iii) a program design that will assist the authorities to implement their \nstrategy. \n\n \nTable 4: Strategic Focus for ADB Financial Sector Operations in Indonesia \n \n\nConstraints \n\nLessons from ADB operations \n\nCSP Areas of \nEngagement \n\nMedium-Term \nNational \nDevelopment \nPlan Targets \nPrivate financing of \ninfrastructure \n\nLack of depth  \nand breadth in \nthe financial \nsector \n\n\u2022  Post-crisis  reforms  inadequate  to  achieve \n\ngreater depth \n\n\u2022  ADB long-term support for regulatory reforms \n\u2022  Support  to  be  translated  to  achieve  faster \n\n \n\nmarket and product development \n\nFinancial sector \ndeepening \n\n \n\nSource: ADB. 2006.

The  expected \noutcome  of  the  Program  is  sufficient  capital  market  growth  to  diversify  the  markets,  combined \nwith a stronger regulatory and supervisory capacity that will ensure the resilience of the financial \nsector and the economy as a whole. It is expected that the Program will lead to an increase in \nthe nonbank financial sector\u2019s share of total financial assets. To ensure this outcome, a policy \nreform  program  has  been  initiated  over  January  2006\u2212December  2010  aimed  at  enhancing \ninformation  disclosure  and  improving  price  discovery,  creating  deeper  and  more  liquid  capital \nmarkets,  providing  for  better  market  surveillance  and  investor  protection,  and  strengthening \ngovernance  and  human  resource  capacity  in  market  institutions.  The  Program  supports  the \nGovernment\u2019s  financial  sector  reform  agenda,  with  a  focus  on  the  development  of  capital \nmarkets.  \n \n56.   A  program  cluster  modality  is  proposed,  consisting  of  two  single-tranche  subprograms \nanchored  on  the  Government\u2019s  financial  sector  reform  programs.  The  program  period  is  from \nJanuary  2006  to  December  2010,  with  a  single  tranche  loan  of  $300  million  to  be  disbursed \nunder subprogram 1 (2006\u20132007) based on a range of upfront actions taken by the Government \nin the core areas. As shown in the policy matrix in Appendix 4, the actions have been split into \ntwo  phases,  January  2006\u2212September  2007  for  subprogram  1  (recognizing  measures  already \ntaken by the Government), and October 2007\u2212June 2009 for subprogram 2. The Government\u2019s \nmedium-term national reform agenda and its timing will be reviewed in light of the achievements \nof subprogram 1 and possible changes in the policy environment. It will be modified if necessary \nand  supported  by  subprogram  2.  The  Government  envisages  support  from  ADB  of  $200 \nmillion\u2212$300 million for subprogram 2.  \n\n \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions \n\nB. \n \n57. \nThe  policy  measures  supported  by  the  Program  include  a  set  of  sector  reforms  to \npromote financial diversification by enhancing the growth and development of capital markets. \nThe reform agenda is structured around the following policy outcomes, which form the basis of \nthe four components of the Program: \n \n\nenhancing information disclosure and price discovery, \npromoting deeper and more liquid financial markets, \nimproving market surveillance and investor protection, and \nstrengthening governance and human resource capacity. \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n \n1. \n\nComponent 1: Enhancing Information Disclosure and Price Discovery \n\n58. \nThese policy actions are the most important for the development of the capital markets. \nBapepam-LK has issued rules requiring prompt disclosure of secondary trading in bonds and for \nissuers of bonds to have an annual rating while their securities are outstanding. This will enable \nmarket  valuation  of  fixed  income  instruments.  Effective  November  2007,  the  over-the-counter \nfixed  income  trading  system  at  the  SSX  has  been  replaced  by  a  centralized  trading  platform, \nwhich has many advantages over the previous system as it adds value to fixed-income trading \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nwith  improved  trade  execution,  transparent  pricing,  competitive  data  and  lower  costs. \nSubprogram  1  supports  the  issuance  of  regulations  to  establish  a  bond  pricing  agency  in  the \nprivate  sector.  These  measures  will  improve  transparency  and  lead  to  a  fairer  trading \nenvironment in the bond market. They are aimed at addressing the major regulatory failures in \n2005  that  resulted  in  the  mispricing  of  fixed  income  securities  in  mutual  funds  and  a  resultant \nloss  of  confidence  among  mutual  fund  investors  that  led  to  a  fall  in  the  assets  under \nmanagement. The bond pricing agency is expected to be established in 2008 with a mandate to \nprovide  an  independent  and  objective  daily  fair  value  of  all  bonds.  All  issuers  and  public \ncompanies  will  be  required  to  provide  information  on  corporate  governance  as  part  of  their \nannual reports. Policy measures under component 1 are summarized below and the individual \npolicy actions are in Appendix 4: \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1.1 strengthen price information disclosure; \n1.2 enhance market valuation of fixed income instruments; and \n1.3 improve market transparency. \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n2. \n\nComponent 2: Promoting Deeper and More Liquid Financial Markets \n\n59. \nThe  policy  actions  under  subprogram  1  are  designed  to  promote  liquidity  so  investors \ncan buy or sell within narrow margins without affecting the market price. Depth and liquidity are \nessential  to  achieve  market  efficiency  and  resilience  in  the  face  of  volatility  and  uncertainty  in \nexpectations and in financial flows. On the supply side, the Government proposes a sequence \nof measures to develop deeper and more liquid securities markets, particularly at the short end \nof the market, where repurchase agreements will be encouraged. To facilitate the development \nof  the  repurchase  market  subprogram  I  supports  the  issuance  of  guidelines  clarifying  the \naccounting treatment for repurchase transactions, while under subprogram 2, Bapepam-LK will \ncooperate with Bank Indonesia to promote the use of the master agreement in all open market \nrepurchase  transactions,  whether  with  Bank  Indonesia\u2019s  certificates  or  with  new  treasury  bills \nissued  by  the  Debt  Management  Office.  Subprogram  1  also  supports  the  development  of \nbenchmark  yields  for  government  bonds  by  concentrating  issuance  of  government  bonds  at \nselected maturities of 5, 7, 10, 15, and 20 years. A primary dealer system has been established \nwith  market-making  responsibilities  in  government  debt  securities  to  ensure  two-way  quotes, \nthereby supporting the secondary market. To develop the short-term government debt market, \ntreasury bills of 12 months maturity have been issued. The Government will gradually progress \nissuance of treasury bills down to 1 month maturity with the longer term objective of gradually \nreplacing  short-term  bills  issued  by  Bank  Indonesia.  Revised  regulations  on  short  selling  and \nmargin  trading  are  expected  to  be  issued  by  the  end  of  2007.  The  Government  has  also \ndivested itself of 15% of its holding in the state-owned PT Bank Negara Indonesia through an \ninitial public offering in August 2007. It plans to seek parliamentary approval to divest itself of 11 \nmore SOEs by the end of 2007 and 16 more in 2008, thereby increasing the supply of securities \nto the capital markets.  \n \n60. \nTo develop the investor base, subprogram 1 supports the issuance of government bonds \nin  small  denominations  to  attract  the  retail  public.  Rules  have  been  issued  to  facilitate  the \nissuance of new products such as municipal bonds, sharia-based instruments, exchange-traded \nfunds  and  securitization  of  asset-backed  receivables  such  as  mortgages.  Development  of  the \nhousing finance industry is another priority and amendments are planned to Presidential Decree \n18/2005  to  enable  the  Secondary  Mortgage  Corporation  (PT.  Sarana  Multigriya  Finansial)  to \nlend up to 10 years enabling it to develop a critical mass of primary mortgage receivables. This \nmeasure is expected to lead eventually to a secondary market for the securitization of mortgage \nreceivables.  Many  of  these  new  products  will also  benefit  from  MOF\u2019s  amendments  to  the  tax \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n19 \n\nlaw now under consideration by parliament. A draft decree to provide tax incentives to increase \nthe number of listed companies and the pubic float of shares has been submitted by MOF under \nsubprogram 1 for presidential approval within 2007.  \n \nThe  infrastructure  for  trading  is  also  being  enhanced.  Screen-based  trading  has  been \n61. \nintroduced countrywide. The merger of the two stock exchanges in a new exchange in Jakarta \nhas been approved by their shareholders. The Corporate Law has been amended to allow for \nstock  exchange  companies  to  be  owned  by  a  single  legal  entity.  This  is  expected  to  improve \ngovernance of the stock exchange while broadening ownership and integrating offerings of debt \nand  equity  securities.  Policy  measures  under  component  2  are  summarized  below  and  the \nindividual policy actions are in Appendix 4: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n2.1 develop the government bond market; \n2.2 improve secondary market liquidity; \n2.3 improve overall market access and reduce transaction costs; \n2.4 develop new market sectors, products and hedging instruments; \n2.5 enhance performance of contractual savings industry; \n2.6 strengthen governance of stock exchange; and \n2.7 promote more conducive tax environment for capital markets development. \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii) \n\n3. \n\nComponent 3: Improving Market Surveillance and Investor Protection \n\n \n\n62. \nIndonesia  recognizes  that  the  IOSCO  principles  for  investor  protection  provide  a  basis \nfor  the  development  of  modern  capital  markets.  In  line  with  these  principles,  Bapepam-LK\u2019s \noperational  and  financial  autonomy  is  being  enhanced  through  legal  and  regulatory  measures \ndesigned  to  provide  strengthened  regulation  of  capital  markets  and  the  contractual  savings \nindustry. Subprogram 1 supports the development and submission of a proposal to the Minister \nof  Finance  to  consider  an  appropriate  regulatory  structure  for  the  capital  markets  and  the \nnonbank financial institutions supervisory agency. This would be independent of the Ministry of \nFinance but report to the Minister of Finance, with powers to recruit staff outside the civil service \ncode.  After  addressing  the  constraints  to  the  recruitment  of  staff  under  the  civil  service  code, \nsubprogram 2 will support the implementation of the regulatory framework. Amendments to the \nCapital  Market  Law,  the  Insurance  Law,  and  the  Pension  Law  have  been  drafted  under \nsubprogram  1  to  strengthen  the  regulators\u2019  oversight  and  enforcement  powers  in  line  with \ninternational best practices. They have been submitted to the Minister of Finance with the aim of \nsubmitting  them  to  parliament  for  consideration  in  2008.  The  draft  amendments  include \nadequate provisions for legal immunity from civil suits for staff of Bapepam-LK while carrying out \ntheir  duties  and  acting  in  good  faith.  The  proposed  measures  for  greater  operational  and \nfinancial  autonomy  will  also  be  accompanied  by  greater  accountability.  To  ensure  appropriate \nregulation of capital markets and contractual savings products, irrespective of who is providing \nthose  products,  subprogram  1  supports  a  move  toward  a  more  functional  approach  to \nregulation, which will be phased in over 2007\u20132009. Risk-based supervision will be extended to \nall institutions in the capital markets and the contractual savings industries. \n \nBapepam-LK has entered into bilateral MOUs with a number of the foreign regulators to \n63. \nstrengthen  information  sharing,  particularly  in  connection  with  securities  fraud.  Bapepam-LK \nalso  proposes  to  enter  into  agreements  with  foreign  regulators  to  exchange  information  for \ncross-border regulatory enforcement.  \n \n64. \nRegulation of the mutual fund industry will be strengthened under subprogram 1, which \nwill also support a feasibility study for a securities market investor protection fund. Subprogram \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n2  will  support  a  plan  for  its  implementation.  The  key  will  be  to  provide  investor  protection \nthrough  market  surveillance  and  regulation.  Policy  measures  under  component  3  are \nsummarized below and the individual policy actions are in Appendix 4: \n \n \n\n3.1  strengthen  autonomy,  accountability,  supervisory,  and  regulatory  powers  of \nBapepam-LK; \n3.2 promote international cooperation; \n3.3 rationalize the organizational structure of Bapepam-LK; \n3.4 enhance risk-based supervision of contractual savings industry; and \n3.5 strengthen investor protection. \n\n(i) \n \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\n4. \n\nComponent 4: Strengthening Governance and Human Resource Capacity \n\n65. \nTo  improve  governance  there  needs  to  be  better  coordination  among  the  regulators, \nnotably  MOF,  Bank  Indonesia  and  related  agencies  such  as  LPS.  For  a  more  consolidated \napproach,  addressing  harmonization  and  coordination  of  supervisory  and  regulatory  methods \nand  policies,  reporting  and  information  exchange  and  dissemination,  and  consumer  protection \nand education, an MOU on the establishment of a Financial System Stability Forum was signed \nin June 2007 by MOF, Bank Indonesia, and LPS. Subprogram 1 supports the establishment of \nthe  forum  which  will  be  strengthened  over  the  program  period.  The  forum  aims  to  promote \ninformation  exchange  among  fiscal  and  monetary  authorities  and  cooperation  in  financial \nsupervision  and  surveillance.  The  forum  has  members  from  the  financial  supervisory  and \nregulatory  agencies  and  will  make  a  number  of  important  recommendations,  including  on  the \nfinancial  system  architecture  and  implementation  of  the  financial  sector  assessment  program. \nTo  reduce  the  risk  of  nonbank  financial  institutions  being  used  as  conduits  for  money \nlaundering,  subprogram  1  will  support  a  systematic  approach  to  money  laundering  and  know-\nyour-customer rules for nonbank financial institutions.  \n \nA  medium-  to  long-term  agenda  will  be  needed  for  human  resource  development.  The \n66. \nProgram will support the strengthening of the actuarial profession. Bapepam-LK has signed an \nMOU with the University of Indonesia to develop and adopt a plan of collaboration to serve the \nresearch  needs  of  the  capital  markets  and  contractual  savings  industries.  These  collaborative \nefforts will become fully operational under subprogram 2. In addition, Bapepam-LK has adopted \na  medium-term  plan  to  develop regulatory  information  and  the  research  capability  to  meet \ncurrent and future needs. The Program\u2019s associated TA (Appendix 7) will help meet immediate \nneeds  as  well  as  support  a  systematic  approach  to  medium-  and  long-term  capacity  building \nefforts. The Government will commit enough resources to meet the capacity-building needs in \nthe area of capital markets and nonbank financial institutions over the medium and long term.  \nBased on initial feasibility studies, $18 million over the 2008\u20132012 period will be allocated in the \nGovernment budget for human resource development over the medium term (e.g., support for \nsecondments, specialized recruitment and advanced training, specialized training, and support \nthrough  academic  institutions).  With  well-trained  regulators,  regulatory  implementation  and \neffectiveness  will  be  significantly  enhanced.  Policy  measures  under  component  3  are \nsummarized below and the individual policy actions are in Appendix 4: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n4.1 improve overall financial sector risk-management though better  \ncoordination; \n4.2 strengthen the anti-money-laundering regime; \n4.3 strengthen actuarial profession; and \n4.4 enhance industry skills and capacity for capital markets and contractual  \n savings. \n\n(i) \n \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n21 \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nImportant Features \n\nC. \n \n67. \nThe  Program  has  a  number  of  distinct  and  innovative  features.  First,  there  is  strong \nGovernment  commitment  to  the  development  of  capital  markets  through  the  CMMP  and  the \nFSPP.  These  initiatives  represent  a  combination  of  economic,  business,  legal,  and  regulatory \nfactors designed to enhance the role of the Indonesian capital market as an engine of economic \ngrowth.  Second,  the  Program  supports  qualitative  changes  to  processes  to  ensure  effective \nimplementation. It focuses on outcomes and allows for greater flexibility in actions necessary to \nachieve compliance. Third, it is predicated on the need for a policy and institutional response to \nsignificant market developments since the completion of the FGSSR. Fourth, the Program has \nhelped establish a program coordination committee that will be responsible for implementing the \naction  plan adopted  for the  CMMP  and  the  FSPP.  Fifth,  it includes  an indicative  policy  reform \nagenda for subprogram 2 that builds upon subprogram 1 reforms, thus providing for flexibility in \ndeveloping subprogram 2. \n \nD. \n \n68. \nThe  proposed  single-tranche  loan  for  subprogram  1  of  $300  million  will  help  the \nGovernment  meet  its  medium-term  financing  needs.  The  loan  will  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources. It will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, an \ninterest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility, and a commitment charge of 0.75%  per annum.19 The Government has \nprovided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility  on  the  basis  of  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices \nwere its own independent decision and not  made in reliance on any  communication or advice \nfrom ADB.  The Republic of Indonesia will be the Borrower. The loan for subprogram 1 will be \nreleased in one tranche when the conditions of the policy matrix have been met and upon loan \neffectiveness.  The  Government  envisages  a  loan  of  $200  million  to  $300  million  to  finance \nsubprogram 2. The processing of subprogram 2 will be subject to adequate progress of reforms \nand the Government\u2019s readiness to continue with its reform agenda. \n \n69. \nGovernment debt as a share of GDP improved to 41% in 2006 from 45% in 2005 and is \nprojected to fall to about 30% in 2009. The fiscal deficit is projected to increase from the original \nestimate of 1.1% of GDP to 1.5% in 2007. The Government has sought $2.1 billion in program \nloans  (Table  5),  based  on  its  decision  not  to  exceed  its  limits  on  the  issuance  of  domestic \nbonds.  The  modest  increase  in  the  deficit  target  for  2007  and  2008  from  earlier  projections  is \nexpected  to  create  some  room  for  additional  development  spending.  With  high  projected \nrevenues  and  secure  financing,  development  spending  is  projected  to  increase  from  3.1%  of \nGDP in 2006 to 3.9% in 2010 keeping the debt levels sustainable over the medium term. On a \nconsolidated basis, total government investment is projected to increase from 4.8% in 2005 to \n7.7% in 2010. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n19 There  will  be  no  commitment  charge  for  the  single-tranche  loan  if  it  is  declared  effective  and  disbursed  within \n60 days  after  the  signing  of  the  Loan  Agreement.  Currently  the  waiver  on  the  commitment  charge  of  0.50%  is \napplicable to all interest periods commencing from 1 January 2007 up to and including 30 June 2008. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\nTable 5: Government\u2019s 2007 Revised Budget Deficit Projections \n \n\nCategories \n\nA.

The  political  costs \ninvolved in implementing the reforms are considerable and will be felt immediately. Although the \neconomic  benefits  will  greatly  outweigh  the  costs,  they  will  take  time  to  emerge  fully.  Vested \ninterests  benefit  from  the  current  weak  enforcement  of  securities,  pension  and  insurance \nsubsector  regulation;  regulatory  arbitrage;  and  the  absence  of  adequate  risk  management, \nsupervision,  and  transparency  in  securities  trading.  Nevertheless,  the  cost  of  a  delay  in \nimplementing  the  reforms  would  be  substantially  higher  for  the  economy  than  the  adjustment \ncosts. Market forces need an effective and transparent regulatory framework. In the absence of \ntimely reforms, the financial sector will continue to be ineffective in intermediating resources for \nproductive  investment,  financial  institutions  will  remain  vulnerable  to  systemic  risks,  and \ninvestors will be vulnerable to fraud and misconduct. \n \nE. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProgram Management \n\n \n71. \nBapepam-LK will be the Executing Agency for the Program and will monitor and facilitate \nthe implementation of the agreed reform actions to ensure that they are carried out in a timely \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n23 \n\n \n2. \n\n \n3. \n\nmanner.  DMO  and  the  Directorate  of  Taxes  (DOT),  both  under  MOF,  Bapepeam-LK,  Menneg \nBUMN  (the  State  Ministry  of  State  Owned  Enterprises),  and  the  Financial  System  Stability \nForum will be the implementing agencies. Bapepam-LK has established a program coordination \ncommittee  headed  by  the  Bapepam-LK  chair  with  representatives  from  DMO,  DOT,  Menneg \nBUMN, Bappenas (National Development Planning Agency), and the Financial System Stability \nForum. The committee is responsible for coordinating the implementation and sustaining of the \nprogram actions. The committee shall oversee the implementation of the policy actions detailed \nin the Policy Letter and the Policy Matrix, and provide guidance and direction to the Executing \nAgency, the Implementing Agencies and other relevant line agencies of the Borrower. ADB may \nbe invited to participate in the meetings as an observer. \n\nImplementation Period  \n\n \n72. \nThe Government has completed all actions in the policy matrix for subprogram 1. \n\nThe implementation period for Subprogram 1 is from January 2006 to September 2007. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement  \n\n \n73. \nThe loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange cost (excluding local \nduties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding \nineligible items, and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. In accordance \nwith  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements for Program Loans (1998), the reimbursement procedure will be used to disburse \nthe loan proceeds based on certification by the Borrower. No supporting import documentation \nwill  be  required  if  during  each  year  the  value  of  Indonesia\u2019s  total  imports  minus  imports  from \nnonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development \nassistance is equal to or greater than the amount of the loan expected to be disbursed during \nsuch  year.  The  Government  will  certify  its  compliance  with  this  formula  with  each  withdrawal \nrequest.  Otherwise,  import  documentation  under  existing  procedures  will  be  required.  ADB \nreserves  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  the  loan  proceeds  and  to  verify  the  accuracy  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s certification.  \n\nAnticorruption and Fiduciary Assessment \n\n \n4. \n \n74. \nThe  Government  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to \ndate)  and  its  Combating  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism  Policy  (2003). \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability and transparency, ADB will \nrequire the Government to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls \nfollowing  international  best  practice  standards  for  preventing  corruption  or  money  laundering \nactivities or the financing of terrorism and covenant with ADB to refrain from engaging in such \nactivities. \n \nThe  proposed  Program  directly  addresses  anticorruption  issues  in  the  financial  sector \n75. \nthrough \nfraud  and \nmisrepresentation. This is part of a broader Government agenda to fight corruption and improve \nits  public  financial  management  systems.  Presidential  Decree  80/2003  sets  out  the  basic \nprinciples  of  procurement:  transparency,  open  and  fair  competition,  economy,  and  efficiency. \nSeveral  state  auxiliary  bodies  have  been  established  with  mandates  to  fight  corruption:  the \nCommission for Eradication of Corruption, the National Ombudsman Commission, the National \n\nfocus  on  strengthening  protection \n\ninvestors  against \n\nits  core \n\nfor \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\nLaw Commission, and the Commission for the Eradication of Money Laundering.20 Further, the \nDPSP  cluster  (footnote  5)  has  a  core  focus  on  improving  governance  and  anticorruption \ninitiatives. It promotes transparency in public finance management and aims to strengthen the \nexisting  independent  oversight  mechanisms  by  improving  the  auditing  framework.  The \nGovernment  has  reorganized  MOF,  separating  the  budget  and  treasury  functions,  and  has \ninitiated  steps  to  increase  efficiency  and  transparency  and  reduce  corruption  in  public  finance \nmanagement.  The  Government  also  places  significant  emphasis  on  strengthening  internal \ncontrol systems and overall public finance management, with support from the World Bank.21 \n\n \n5. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nfor \n\nthe  withdrawal  applications.  Before  withdrawal, \n\n \nADB retains the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of \n76. \nthe \nthe  Government\u2019s  certification \nGovernment  will  nominate  an  account  (the  Deposit  Account)  at  Bank  Indonesia  to  receive  the \nloan proceeds. The account will be managed, operated, and liquidated in accordance with terms \nsatisfactory to ADB. Bapepam-LK will submit progress reports on policy and institutional reform \nimplementation to the program coordination committee and to ADB. These will be submitted in \nsuch  form  and  in  such  detail  as  ADB  may  request,  and  should  include  (i)  progress  made  and \nproblems  encountered  during  the  period  in  review,  (ii)  steps  taken  or  proposed  to  be  taken  to \nremedy problems encountered, (iii) proposed detailed activities for program implementation, and \n(iv) expected progress based on (ii) and (iii) above. \n \n\n6. \n\nCounterpart Funds \n\n \nCounterpart  funds  generated  by  the  Program  will  be  used  by  the  Government,  under \n77. \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB,  to  meet  program  expenditures  and  associated  costs  of \nreform and additional budgetary allocation for development spending.  \n \n\n7. \n\nMonitoring and Review \n\n \n78. \nADB  will,  in  cooperation  with  MOF  and  Bapepam-LK,  carry  out  periodic  reviews  of \nprogress and outcomes of subprogram I following the subprogram I period. The Government will \nkeep  ADB  informed  of  the  outcome  of  policy  discussions  with  other  multilateral  and  bilateral \nagencies  that  have  implications  for  program  implementation,  and  will  provide  ADB  with  the \nopportunity to comment on any resulting policy proposals. ADB, in collaboration with MOF and \nBapepam-LK,  will  review  program  performance  about  6  months  after  loan  effectiveness  to \nreview the outcome of subprogram 1 and begin preparation of subprogram 2. In addition to the \nprogress reports, MOF and Bapepam-LK will submit within 30 days of the subprogram 1 review \nby  ADB,  a  report  that  will  evaluate  implementation  of  the  policy  reform  measures  under \nsubprogram 1. This report will also assess the impact on the sector, describe lessons identified \nduring the program period, and outline reforms and assistance needed for the development of \nthe sector, to enable processing of subprogram 2. \n\n                                                 \n20 ADB  has  been  closely  involved  in  the  establishment  and  strengthening  of  the  anti-money-laundering  regime  in \n\nIndonesia through TA support as well as policy-based loans. \n\n21 Government Financial Management and Revenue Administration Project approved in December 2004  \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n25 \n\nV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n79. \nTechnical assistance estimated to cost a total $1,500,000 equivalent, of which $700,000 \nwill be financed from the ADB Technical Assistance Special Fund and $500,000 equivalent will \nbe provided from the Financial Sector Development Partnership Fund22 on a grant basis and will \nbe administered by ADB. The TA will focus on supporting Bapepam-LK in its capacity building \nprogram  over  the  medium  term.  Details  of  the  proposed  scope  and  implementation \narrangements are in Appendix 7. \n \n\nVI. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nBenefits \n\nSocial and Environmental Safeguards \n\n \nA. \n \n80. \nThe  Program  supports  the  Government\u2019s  development  agenda  to  establish  the \nIndonesian capital market as a resilient and competitive market that supports higher growth for \nthe  national  economy.  The  Program  will  provide  a  policy  framework  that  encourages  financial \ninnovation  in  terms  of  new  instruments  and  tenors,  and  new  kinds  of  intermediation.  It  will \nenhance information disclosure and facilitate price discovery, thus improving the efficiency with \nwhich  financial  markets  price  risk.  This  will  help  to  create  deeper  and  more  liquid  capital \nmarkets. At the same time, CMDPC will promote stronger intermediaries that are better able to \nmobilize and allocate resources and risks. Better market surveillance and investor protection will \npromote stability and resilience and are essential for capital market development. Together with \nbroader  economic  reforms  in  Indonesia,  the  reform  of  capital  markets  will  thus  contribute  to \nproductivity growth, employment generation, and financial sector stability. \n \nB. \n \n81. \nThe  Program  will  not  entail  any  involuntary  resettlement  or  have  a  negative  impact  on \nindigenous people or the environment. It is classified as category C for involuntary resettlement, \nimpact  on  indigenous  people,  and  impact  on  environment.  The  Program  is  a  general \nintervention aimed at supporting sustainable economic growth and in that respect is expected to \nhave an indirect positive effect on poverty reduction.  Appendix 8 contains the summary poverty \nand social impact analysis and Appendix 9 the environmental impact analysis. \n \nC. \n \n82.  While mitigation measures have been put in place for some of the key risks anticipated \nduring program implementation, subprogram 1 still faces some risks.  \n \n83. \nSustaining Reforms. The financial and operational autonomy of Bapepam-LK, which is \ncritical  for  its  effective  supervision  of  the  nonbank  financial  sector,  will  need  an  appropriate \nregulatory  framework.  Reforms  being  undertaken  by  the  Government  may  be  opposed  by \nvested  or  competing  interests.  The  public  and  parliament  will  need  to  be  persuaded  of  the \nlonger-term benefits of reforms that have upfront costs. The consolidation of reform initiatives in \nrecent  years  and  the  commitment  by  the  Government  and  a  strong  parliamentary  coalition  to \ncontinue with reforms should ensure Indonesia is on the path to growth and poverty reduction.  \n \n\nRisks  \n\n                                                 \n22  Contributor: Government of Luxembourg.  \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\n \n\nGovernance  and  Capacity  Constraints.  Unless  institutional  and  human  capacity \n84. \nbuilding  takes  place  within  Bapepam-LK,  there  may  be  delays  in  implementing  reforms.  TA \nsupport  will  help  address  these  capacity  weaknesses  and  the  Government  has  agreed  to \ncommit, through its normal budgetary processes, appropriate provisions for human development \nto sustain capacity building efforts over the medium and long term. ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and \nProgram  (2006\u22122009)  envisages  enhancing  governance  and  reducing  opportunities  for \ncorruption through its lending and TA operations. ADB has provided support for anticorruption \nmeasures,  including  procurement  reforms,  during  the  last  7  years  and  a  number  of  ongoing \nloan-funded activities have an anticorruption and capacity-building focus. ADB has also actively \nsupported  the  Partnership  for  Governance  Reform\u2014a  cooperative  relationship  between  the \nGovernment,  civil  society,  the  private  sector  and  international  development  partners  on \ngovernance reform. The Financial System Stability Forum which began operations in June 2007 \nwill provide a platform for exchanging information and ideas, and for coordinating the regulatory \nand  supervisory  activities  of  Bank  Indonesia,  Bapepam-LK,  and  the  Lembaga  Penjamin \nSimpanan,  the  three  member  regulatory  agencies.  Successful  implementation  of  the  CMMP \nwith the support of the Program should strengthen the capacity and authority of Bapepam-LK in \nregulating and ensuring good governance in the nonbank financial market.  \n \n85. \nLack  of  Commitment  and  Accountability.  Lack  of  accountability,  measurable \noutcomes,  industry  commitment,  and  tactical  planning  mean  that  the  CMMP  may  run  into \nimplementation difficulties. There are differences of views among stakeholders that will need to \nbe resolved if policy reforms are to progress. However, progress is likely at present in view of \nthe strong Government commitment to reform. The reform program is made more tractable by a \nphased plan for the implementation of well-defined measures over the next 4 years, in line with \nthe  Government\u2019s  CMMP  as  well  as  its  financial  sector  policy  package.  In  addition,  the \nestablishment  of  the  internal  compliance  bureau  in  December  2006  and  the  revised  code  of \nethics will strengthen governance and accountability within Bapepam-LK. \n  \nits \n86. \ncompliance  and  enforcement  mandate  effectively.  The  Program  will  help  to  strengthen  its \ninvestigation  strategies  and  enforcement  skills  through  clearly  defined  capacity-building \nprograms within Bapepam-LK. \n  \n87. \nExogenous  Shocks.  Exogenous  shocks  to  the  economy  that  adversely  affect  growth \nprospects  and  threaten  macroeconomic  stability  are  a  risk  to  the  achievement  of  program \noutcomes.  There  is  also  the  risk  of  a  slow  down  in  the  global  economy  and  of  a  disorderly \nunwinding of global macroeconomic imbalances.  However, overall, the economy\u2019s vulnerability \nto external shocks has been decreasing, primarily because of sound debt and macroeconomic \nmanagement.  Indonesia\u2019s  ratio  of  total  external debt  to  GDP  fell  from 49.3%  in  2005  to  under \n37%  in  2006.  The  Program,  in  conjunction  with  additional  reform  programs  financed  by  ADB, \nand  the  DPSP  being  financed  by  the  World  Bank  and  the  Government  of  Japan,  will  help  to \nsustain the economy\u2019s growth path while reducing the risks of macroeconomic instability. \n\nEnforcement  Constraints.  Bapepam-LK  may  have  difficulty \n\nimplementing \n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n\n \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nA. \n \n88. \nIn addition to the implementation of the actions specified in the policy matrix and to the \nstandard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following  specific  assurances,  which  are \nincorporated in the Loan Agreement. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n27 \n\nContinuity  and  coordination  of  reforms.  The  Government  will  carry  out  the \npolicies and actions in accordance with the schedule of policy reforms contained \nin  the  policy  matrix  and  ensure  sustainability  of  the  reforms  beyond  the \nsubprogram 1 period. \n\nPolicy  dialogue.  The  Government  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  (a)  the  progress \nmade  in  carrying  out  the  TA  attached  to  the  program  cluster  from  time  to  time, \nand  (b)  the  policy  discussions  with  other  multilateral  and  bilateral  agencies  that \nhave implications for implementation of subprogram 1 and will provide ADB with \nan  opportunity  to  comment  on  any  resulting  policy  proposals.  The  Government \nwill  take  ADB\u2019s  views  into  consideration  before  finalizing  and  implementing  any \nsuch proposals. \n\n(iii) \n\nCounterpart  funds.

In  terms  of  composition  and  growth,  Indonesia\u2019s  financial \nsystem has not progressed compared with those of its neighbors. In 2005 Indonesia\u2019s banking \nassets as a percentage of GDP were 49.8%, equity market capitalization was 28.9%, and bonds \noutstanding were 19.6%, much lower than Hong Kong, China; Republic of Korea; Malaysia; and \nSingapore  (Table  A2.1).  Corporate  bonds  were  a  very  small  percentage  of  the  overall  bonds \noutstanding  in  these  economies,  including  Indonesia.    Although  the  Indonesian  capital  market \nhas been the best performing in the region and equity market capitalization has tripled in recent \nyears (37.6% in 2006), issues of breadth and depth of the market and enforcement of regulation \nand supervision remain to be addressed. The long-term debt market has been constrained by \ndelays  in  pension  and  insurance  sector  reforms.  Much  liquidity  is  locked  up  in  government \nbonds.   \n \n\nTable A2.1: Financial Systems in Selected Asian Economies \n\n(% of gross domestic product) \n \n\n2005 \n24.4 \n \n46.6 \n19.6 \n \n76.2 \n88.0 \n36.7 \n68.2 \n40.8 \n\n1997 \n12.9 \n \n26.0 \n1.9 \n \n25.2 \n57.0 \n22.4 \n24.7 \n7.1 \n\n2005 \n163.1 \n \n444.6 \n49.8 \n \n93.5 \n159.4 \n63.2 \n185.4 \n103.6 \n\n1997 \n124.6 \n \n205.1 \n31.1 \n \n37.9 \n100.9 \n56.1 \n122.0 \n79.7 \n \n\nBanks Assets \n2004 \n176.4 \n \n337.5 \n14.6 \n \n130.1 \n169.0 \n66.5 \n176.8 \n129.2 \n\nBonds Outstanding \n2004 \n24.9 \n \n46.3 \n22.6 \n \n83.3 \n90.0 \n28.4 \n73.1 \n41.1 \n\nEquity Market Capitalization \n2005 \n2004 \n1997 \n17.8 \n23.1 \n11.2 \n \n \n \n593.6 \n519.5 \n234.5 \n28.9 \n28.8 \n12.2 \n \n \n \n91.2 \n57.1 \n8.1 \n138.0 \n153.3 \n93.2 \n40.4 \n33.0 \n37.7 \n220.4 \n202.3 \n110.8 \n70.1 \n71.4 \n15.1 \n\n \nEconomy \nPRC \nHong Kong, \nChina \nIndonesia \nRepublic of \nKorea \nMalaysia \nPhilippines \nSingapore \nThailand \n \nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \nSources:  International  Monetary  Fund,  International  Financial  Statistics;  Bank  for  International  Settlements;  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank,  Asian  Bonds  Online;  and  Ghosh,  Swati  R.  2006.  East  Asian  Finance:  The  Road  to  Robust \nMarkets. Washington, DC: World Bank. \n \nIndonesia\u2019s investment to GDP ratio of 21.3 % in 2006 was low compared with ratios in \n2. \nother  economies  in  the  region,  although  the  International  Monetary  Fund  has  projected  that  it \nwill rise to 26.2% by 2009.   \n \nBanking  Institutions  in  Indonesia. The financial sector is dominated by banks, which \n3. \naccount for about 80% of the sector\u2019s assets. However, although the nonbank financial sector \nas  a  percentage  of  GDP  is  small,  it  is  poised  to  grow.  There  are  130  banks:  5  state-owned \nbanks, 72 private banks, 11 foreign banks (100% foreign ownership), 26 regional banks, and 16 \njoint  venture  banks.  The  regulators  plan  to  reduce  the  number  of  banks  to  about  80  through \nmergers.  One  proposal  is  a  minimum  capital  requirement  of  Rp100  billion  by  2010.  In  2006, \nseven  small  banks  were  bought  by  foreign  banks.  The  profitability  of  Indonesia\u2019s  banks,  as \nmeasured  by  the  rate  of  return  on  assets,  has  improved  since  the  Asian  financial  crisis.  The \nreturn on assets was estimated to be 2.6% at the end of 2005\u2014up from negative 18% in 1998. \nMuch of this improvement in profitability occurred during 2002\u20132004. The capital base of banks \nremains strong, with average capital adequacy ratios of 19.3% at the end of 2005.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nTable A2.2: Health of the Indonesian Banking Sector  \n(%) \n\n \nNonperforming loan \nratio \nRate of return on \nassets \nCapital adequacy \nratio \n \nSource:  Bank Indonesia. \n\n1997 \n\n1998 \n\n1999 \n\n2000 \n\n2001 \n\n2002 \n\n2003 \n\n2004 \n\n2005 \n\n7.2 \n\n48.6 \n\n32.9 \n\n18.8 \n\n12.1 \n\n1.4 \n\n(18.8) \n\n(6.1) \n\n1.6 \n\n1.5 \n\n7.5 \n\n2.0 \n\n6.8 \n\n2.6 \n\n6.2 \n\n3.5 \n\n7.6 \n\n2.6 \n\n9.1 \n\n(15.7) \n\n(8.1) \n\n2.1 \n\n18.9 \n\n22.4 \n\n19.4 \n\n19.4 \n\n19.3 \n\n \n4. \nDeposit  Insurance.  To  restore  public  confidence  in  the  banking  sector  following  the \nfinancial  meltdown  in  1997,  the  Indonesian  government  was  compelled  to  pursue  a  blanket \nguarantee program. Under this program, all deposits at banks are insured. Indonesia now has a \nDeposit  Insurance  Institution  (LPS).  Parliament  enacted  Deposit  Insurance  Law  24/2004  on  \n22  September  2004  which  stipulates  that  the  Deposit  Insurance  Institution  has  two  core \nfunctions:  (i)  to  guarantee  customer  deposits,  and  (ii)  to  resolve  failing  banks.  The  Deposit \nInsurance  Institution  carries  out  a  limited  and  explicit  deposit  insurance  scheme,  under  which \ndeposits are currently insured up to Rp100 million. \n \n5. \nNonbank  Financial  Subsector.  The  nonbank  financial  subsector  still  accounts  for  a \nrelatively  low  20%  of  total  financial  assets.  The  sector  includes  mutual  funds  (also  known  as \ninvestment  companies),  insurance  companies,  pension  funds,  securities  brokers  and  dealers, \npawnshops, rural institutions, and venture capital companies.  In line with Indonesia\u2019s long-term \ndevelopment agenda and development priorities, the Government considers development of the \nnonbank  financial  sector  to  be  an  urgent  policy  imperative.  At  present,  however,  Indonesian \ninstitutional investors are relatively small and not yet a source of long-term capital. Indonesia\u2019s \npension funds and insurance companies invest a significant portion of their resources in short-\nterm bank deposits. \n \n\nTable A2.3: Structure of the Financial Sector  \n\nType of Institution and Year \nBanks (2005) \nNonbank Financial Institutions \nFinance Companies (2005) \nInsurance Companies (2005) \nPension  Funds  (2004)  (including  both  public \nand private) \nSecurities Firms (2004) \nPawn Shops (2005) \nRural Institutions (2004) \nMutual Funds (2005) \nVenture Capital Companies (2005) \nOutstanding Corporate Bonds (2005) \nTotal \nEquity Market Capitalization (2005) \nEquity Market Capitalization (2006) \n\nAssets (Rp trillion) \n1470.0 \n374.5 \n67.7 \n75.1 \n \n107.1 \n10.1 \n4.8 \n14.7 \n29.4 \n2.7 \n62.8 \n1844.5 \n801.0 \n1249.1 \n\n% of Assets \n79.7 \n20.3 \n3.7 \n4.1 \n \n5.8 \n0.1 \n0.3 \n0.8 \n1.6 \n0.1 \n3.4 \n100 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\n% of GDP \n49.8 \n13.7 \n2.5 \n2.8 \n \n4.7 \n0.4 \n0.2 \n0.6 \n1.1 \n0.1 \n2.3 \n67.6 \n28.9 \n37.4 \n\n\u2014 = not available. \nSource:  Bapepam-LK. \n \n6. \nInsurance.  Insurance  premiums,  particularly  life  insurance,  grew  rapidly  before  the \ncrisis.  However,  the  insurance  industry  suffered  heavily  from  the  rupiah  devaluation.  Unlike  in \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n35 \n\nbanking,  there  have  not  been  large-scale  corporate  failures  among  insurers,  mainly  because \nregulations  required  insurers  to  hold  a  high  proportion  of  their  funds  in  bank  deposits.  The \ninsurance industry in Indonesia is small and premiums are only 1.8% of GDP (1.18% in life and \n0.62%  in  general  insurance).  As  of  August  2006,  there  were  51  life  insurance  companies,  97 \ngeneral  insurance  companies  and  4  reinsurance  companies.  In  addition,  two  companies \nadministered social security and three managed civil servants and armed forces insurance. The \nindustry is heavily concentrated, with the top five general insurance companies accounting for \n51% of general insurance assets and the top five life insurance companies accounting for 55% \nof  life  insurance  assets.  The  licenses  of  8  companies\u2014five  life  and  three  general  insurance \ncompanies were withdrawn in 2006. The Government is still to address the remaining one state \nlife  and  two  insolvent  general  insurance  companies.  Insurance  companies  currently  invest  an \nestimated 25% of their assets in short-term deposits.  \n \n7. \nTo enable insurers to meet increased capital requirements, the Government now allows \nforeigners  to  own  up  to  99%  of  listed  insurance  companies.  The  insurance  industry  must  be \nconsolidated  into  fewer  but  stronger  companies.  Policy  holders  must  be  protected  and \nstandards  raised  in  anticipation  of  reductions  to  barriers  to  entry  with  equal  treatment  under \nfreer trade agreements. There is also a need to increase the quality of professional services to \nthe  pension  and  insurance  industry,  especially  actuaries  and  accountants  but  also  asset \nmanagers. Quality is a prerequisite to a shift toward risk-based supervision.  \n \n\n \n\nTable A2.4: Ownership Structure of the Insurance Industry, 1985 and 2005 \n \n\nIndicator \n \nNumber of Companies \n% of Total Assets: \n     State \n     Joint Venture \n     Private \nAssets (Rp billion) \n\u2014 = not available. \nSource: Bapepam-LK. \n\nLife Insurance \nCompanies \n\nGeneral Insurance \nCompanies \n\nReinsurance \n\n1985 \n         21 \n\n2005 \n        51 \n\n1985 \n        67 \n\n2005 \n        97 \n\n1985 \n         4 \n\n2005 \n         4 \n\n         41 \n          \u2014 \n         59 \n       409 \n\n          7 \n        49 \n        44 \n 53,940 \n\n        61 \n        14 \n        25 \n      512 \n\n        14 \n        16 \n        70 \n 21,206 \n\n       99 \n         \u2014 \n \n     263 \n\n         \u2014 \n         \u2014 \n \n     978 \n\n \n8. \nPensions. In Indonesia, the pension sector is small, controlling less than 4.7% of GDP \nin  assets,  compared  with  Thailand  (8.4%),  Malaysia  (57%),  and  Australia  (75%).  As  of \n31 December  2006,  there  were  297  private  pension  funds  in  Indonesia  with  net  assets  of \nRp69.17  trillion  covering  privately-managed  employer  pension  funds  and  financial  institution \npension  funds.  Investments  totalled  Rp66.59  trillion.  Only  12%  of  the  workforce  is  covered  by \npublic  pension  and  old-age  savings  programs,  provided  by  PT  Jamsostek  for  private  sector \nworkers, by PT Taspen for civil servants, and by PT Asabri for the military. Less than 2% of the \nworkforce  is  covered  by  voluntary  private  pensions.  The  number  of  employers  using  financial \ninstitution  pension  funds  more  than  tripled  over  the  past  5  years.  The  Private  Pensions  Law \n11/1992  will  be  reviewed  and  amendments  will  be  submitted  together  with  the  amendments \nproposed  to  the  Capital  Market  Law  and  the  Insurance  Law.  Since  1987,  100  pension  funds, \nmainly  defined-benefit  employer  pension  plans,  have  been  liquidated  and  few  new  funds  are \nbeing  created.  The  main  impediments  are:  (i)  private  pensions  have  to  compete  with  other \nfinancial  products,  such  as  mutual  funds  and  insurance,  which  are  more  flexible  (allowing  for \nearly  withdrawals)  and  have  better  tax  regimes;  (ii)  private  pension  savings  have  to  be \nconverted  into  annuities  with  unattractive  rates  upon  retirement  age;  (iii)  although  taxation  of  \nprivate pensions is theoretically an exempt-exempt-taxable (EET) regime, in practice this is not \nthe  case;  (iv)  the  investment  regulations  do  not  meet  international  standards;  (v)  potential \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\ncontributors  may  not  have  enough  funds  for  voluntary  contributions  for  private  pensions  after \ncompulsory contributions to public pensions and related labor law provisions have been met. \n \n9. \nThe  uncertainties  that  prevent  the  growth  of  the  pension  industry  need  to  be  resolved \ntogether  with  the  uncertain  implementation  of  Law  40  on  the  National  Social  Security  System \nand  debates  around  the  funding  of  benefits  under  Law  13  of  2003  on  Labor.  Bapepam-LK  is \nundertaking  steps  to  improve  the  private  pension  industry,  in  particular  to  increase  risk-based \nsupervision. \n \n10. \nEquity  Market.  In  2006  there  was  a  sharp  increase  in  market  capitalization  to \n$139 billion  but  Indonesia  remains  the  fourth  smallest  market  in  the  Asia  and  Pacific  region \n(only  New  Zealand,  the  Philippines,  and  Sri  Lanka  are  smaller).  The  top  5%  of  companies  in \nIndonesia represented 67% of market value and 68% of turnover (the averages for developing \nAsian markets are 61% of market value and 50% of turnover). \n \n11. \nRights  of  minority  shareholders  are  not  well  protected  and  standards  of  corporate \ngovernance remain low. Liquidity is limited by the size of the market. The turnover of domestic \ncompany  shares  in  2006  was  $48  billion\u2014less  than  $200  million  per  day.  However  many \ndeveloping Asian markets are relatively illiquid\u20142006 turnover in Malaysia was only $75 billion, \nin Thailand it was $101 billion, and in the Philippines $11 billion. Indonesia\u2019s turnover velocity of \n35% in 2006 is comparable with many other markets. The amount of capital raised is small, with \nthe Jakarta Stock Exchange (JSX) raising $985 million in 2005\u2014$363 million from initial public \nofferings (IPOs). JSX also operates a second tier market, the development board, to provide a \nplatform for small and medium-sized enterprises and new companies. At the end of 2005 there \nwere  125  exchange  member  securities  companies.  This  is  a  large  number\u2014Malaysia  had  38 \nand Thailand 49\u2014and most do not make a profit given the small size of the market. Bapepam \nimposed more stringent capital requirements in 2004 which reduced the number of firms but the \nnumber still seems excessive.  \n \n\nTable A2.5: Summary of Jakarta Stock Exchange Operations \n \n2002 \n \n268.4 \n \n171.2 \n 120.8 \n 424.9 \n \n  14.4 \n\n2000 \n1999 \n \n \n259.6 \n451.8 \n \n \n178.5 \n134.5 \n147.9  122.8 \n676.9  416.3 \n  \n18.7 \n\n2004 \n2003 \n \n \n680.0 \n460.4 \n \n \n411.8 \n234.0 \n125.4 \n247.0 \n 691.9  1,000.2 \n  \n\n2006 \n \n1,249.1 \n801.3   \n \n  \n  429.5 \n 401.9 \n  406.0 \n  440.0 \n1,162.6  1,805.5 \n  \n   28.9 \n\n2001 \n \n239.2 \n \n148.4 \n  97.5 \n 392.0 \n \n 14.2 \n\n2005 \n \n\n 28.9 \n\n 37.4 \n\n22.6 \n\n  \n\n  \n\n2007 a \n \n1,422.8 \n \n357.4 \n328.8 \n2,055.4 \n \n\n287 \n  21 \n\n    316 \n      31 \n\n \n \n\n   331 \n     22 \n  3,092 \n \n\n   353 \n       6 \n2,953 \n\n   331 \n     12 \n3,724 \n\n    336 \n        8 \n 4,012 \n\n   344 \n     12 \n4,811 \n\n     340 \n         1 \n  4,046 \n\n \n8.58 \n\n \n14.06 \n\n \n6.34 \n\n \n9.66 \n\n \n16.38 \n\n \n4.32 \n\nIndicator \nEquity Market   \nCapitalization (Rp trillion) \nTrading Volumes (billion \nshares) \nTrading Value (Rp trillion) \nJakarta Composite Index \nEquity Market \nCapitalization to GDP (%) \nListed Companies \nNo. of New Issuers \nNo. of Trades (\u2019000) \nTotal Funds Raised (Rp \ntrillion)   \na As of 30 May 2007. \nSource: Jakarta Stock Exchange. 2007. \n\n \n 37.2 \n\n 277 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n37 \n\nTable A2.6: Valuation of Selected Asian Bourses \n \n\nIndex \n\nLocation \n\nPrice a \n\nP/E b \n\nEstimated \nP/E \n\n20,041.1 \n\n30.90 \n\n29.61 \n\nSHSE-SZSE300 \nIND \n\nPeople\u2019s \nRepublic of \nChina \nHongkong, \nChina \nIndia \nIndonesia \nJapan \nMalaysia \n\nHang Seng \n\n20,310.2 \n\n    14.85 \n\nBSE Sensex 30  \nJakarta Composite \nNikkei 225 \nKuala Lumpur \nComposite \nPSEI \nStraits Times \nKospi Index \n\nPhilippines \nSingapore \nRepublic of \nKorea \nSET \nThailand \nP/E = price to earnings ratio.    \na Closing price, as of 2 January 2007. \nb 2006 \nSource: Bloomberg. \n\n13,961.4 \n  1,836.5 \n17,225.8 \n 1,096.2 \n\n2,976.9 \n2,985.8 \n1,435.3 \n\n    25.55 \n    25.53 \n    37.02 \n    17.35 \n\n    15.72 \n    14.44 \n    12.21 \n\n   679.8 \n\n     9.40 \n\n \n\n15.85 \n\n20.50 \n18.82 \n43.16 \n16.68 \n\n16.81 \n16.30 \n14.39 \n\n10.94 \n\n \nIndonesia  has  fewer  IPOs  than  any  other  country  in  the  region  apart  from  the \n12. \nPhilippines.

The  Indonesia  bond  market  remains  small  and  illiquid. \n14. \nGovernment bonds represented about 13.3% of GDP (at the end of 2006) and corporate bonds \nabout 1.9%\u2014low by the standards of neighboring countries. Bonds offered to the public must be \nlisted  on  the  Surabaya  Stock  Exchange  (SSX).  Issuance  of  government  bonds  is  by  auction. \nBanks  are  the  main  holders  of  government  bonds,  with  about  three  quarters  of  the  total  by \nvalue.  Retail  investors  are  largely  absent.  Trading  of  government  bonds  is  increasing,  but \ncorporate bond trading averages only Rp316 billion per day. The SSX provides trading systems \nfor  bonds  but  these  are  little  used  and  most  trading  is  over  the  counter.  A  system  of  primary \ndealers has recently been established and they are expected to provide two-way quotes. There \nis a requirement to report trades to the SSX and trade details are published. \n \n15. \nGovernment  securities  trades  are  settled  electronically  through  Bank  Indonesia\u2019s \nscripless securities settlement system, which offers delivery versus payment settlement through \nlinks to the real time gross settlement system. Bank Indonesia\u2019s scripless securities settlement \nsystem is also used for the auctions of government bonds. Bapepam-LK is the primary regulator \nof bond issuance and trading, but the securities exchanges are responsible for monitoring the \nactivities  of  their  members.  The  inter  dealer  market  association  for  government  securities \n(Himdasun)  has  self-regulatory  responsibilities  and  is  the  custodian  of  the  transaction  data \nreported  by  its  members.  Listed  bonds  are  required  to  have  a  rating  at  issue  but  are  now \nrequired to maintain their annual rating.  \n \n16. \nThe  Debt  Management  Office  issued  its  inaugural  treasury  bills  for  12  months  tenor  in \nJune  2007.  The  target  tenors  of  issuance  are  3  months,  6  months,  9  months  and  12  months \nsecurities. In parallel, Bapepam-LK is working on a focused plan to develop the bond market. \n \n\nTable A2.9: Overall Issuance of Government Bonds \n \n\n% of Total Outstanding \n \n\n$ \n\nRp \n\nTotal Outstanding \n\n \n238,564,501,000,000 \n180,186,698,000,000 \n418,751,199,000,000   \n\nIndonesian \nGovernment  Bonds \n \nTradable Securities \n     Fixed Rate   \n     Variable Rate \n     Subtotal Tradable \nNontradable Securities \nwith Bank Indonesia \n     Fixed Rate \n     Variable Rate \n     Subtotal Nontradable \nTotal Outstanding  \nSource: Directorate General of Debt Management, Ministry of Finance, Government of Indonesia. \n\n271,655,273,841,443 \n274,366,754,841,443 \n274,366,754,841,443 \n693,117,953,841,443   \n\n \n5,500,000,000 \n \n5,500,000,000 \n \n\n \n \n \n5,500,000,000 \n\n0.39 \n0.39 \n0.40 \n \n\n \n34 \n26 \n60 \n \n\nRp \n\n$ \n\n \n\n \n100 \n \n100 \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \nCollective  Investments.  The  mutual  fund  industry  has  been  in  the  spotlight  in  recent \n17. \nyears  because  of  the  tremendous  growth  in  the  number  of  funds  focusing  on  government \nbonds.  The  major  players  include  alliances  from  the  recapitalized  banks  who  transferred  their \nrecapitalized  bond  holdings  to  mutual  fund  subsidiary  companies  and  began  aggressively \nselling  units  similar  to  deposit  products.  There  were  104  licensed  investment  management \ncompanies  at  the  end  of  2005  but  only  74  were  active.  At  the  end  of  2005,  Bapepam-LK  had \nlicensed  19  custodians  but  only  13  were  active.  The  laws  and  regulations  governing  these \ninvestments are not clear\u2014they apply mainly to corporate funds which are rare in Indonesia. As \na result, features that are important in contractual funds, such as the role of the custodian, are \nnot  properly  covered.  Sales  agents  are  largely  unregulated,  and  similar  products  issued  by \ninsurance  companies  are  subject  to  different  regulations.  Bapepam-LK  has  tried  to  address \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n39 \n\nsome of these issues by issuing new rules, but in future regulation and supervision need to be \nbrought  in  line  with  international  standards.  Nevertheless,  mutual  funds  remain  an  important \nsavings vehicle for individuals and institutions. \n \n\nTable A2.10: Mutual Fund Industry in Indonesia, 1996\u20132006 \n \n\nNo. of \nInvestment \nFunds \n\nUnit \nHolders  \n\nNet Asset Value \n(Rp billion) \n\nNumber of Outstanding \nUnits \n\n2,441  \n\n20,234  \n\n15,482  \n\n24,127  \n\n25 \n\n77 \n\n81 \n\n81 \n\n94 \n\n       39,487  \n\n108 \n\n       51,723  \n\n2,782,322.50 \n\n4,916,604.80 \n\n2,992,171.40 \n\n4,974,105.00 \n\n5,515,954.10 \n\n8,003,769.80 \n\n2,942,232,210.52 \n\n6,007,373,758.55 \n\n3,680,892,097.26 \n\n4,349,952,950.82 \n\n5,006,049,769.66 \n\n7,303,771,880.36 \n\n131 \n\n      125,820  \n\n46,613,833.20 \n\n41,665,523,049.21 \n\n186 \n\n      171,712  \n\n69,477,719.80 \n\n60,020,745,572.82 \n\n247 \n\n      299,063  \n\n104,037,824.60 \n\n84,700,701,702.71 \n\n328 \n\n      254,660  \n\n29,405,730.00 \n\n21,262,143,379.98 \n\n202,991 \n\n      516,200,744.00 \n\n\u2014 \n\nYear \n\n1996 \n\n1997 \n\n1998 \n\n1999 \n\n2000 \n\n2001 \n\n2002 \n\n2003 \n\n2004 \n\n2005 \n\n2006 \nSource: BAPEPAM reports. \n\n403 \n\n \n18. \nDeveloping  Sharia-based  Capital  Market  Products.    At the end of 2006, there were \n20  sharia  investment  funds  (5%  of  the  total  number  of  investment  funds  in  Indonesia)  with  a \ntotal  net  asset  value  of  Rp664  billion  (1.3%  of  the  total  and  18.7%  more  than  in  2005).

At  the  end  of  December  2006,  the  market  capitalization \nvalue of the index reached Rp620 trillion or 50% of JSX\u2019s total market capitalization value. The \ntrading  volume  of  the  stocks  listed  in  the  Jakarta  Islamic  Index  at  the  end  of  2006  was  940 \nmillion shares (25% of the total JSX volume), while the trading value was Rp1,243 billion (46% \nof the total JSX value). The Government plans to issue a new sharia bond called \u201csukuks\u201d once \nthe draft bill on sharia-based instruments that was submitted to the parliament in February 2007 \nis  approved.  Issues  related  to  value-added  tax  are  under  consideration  by  the  Directorate  of \nTaxes.  \n \n19.  Market  Infrastructure.  JSX  and  SSX  are  mutual  in  structure.  JSX  was  established  in \n1912  and  SSX  in  1987.  JSX  is  the  recognized  for  stock  listing  and  trading,  whereas  SSX  is \nmainly for listing and trading of bonds and derivative products. The Capital Market Master Plan \n(2000\u20132004) requires brokers to insure against losses, but this is not being adhered to. There is \nno  fund  to  compensate  investors  in  the  event  of  broker  failure.  Clearing  and  settlement  is \nperformed by Indonesian Clearing and Guarantee Corporation (KPEI), owned 90% by JSX and \n10%  by  SSX.  This  self-regulatory  organization  (SRO)  was  established  in  August  1996.  Since \n2001,  it  has  been  providing  securities  lending  and  borrowing  services  to  help  clearing  parties \nmeet  their  temporary  needs  and  prevent  failure  of  transaction  settlements.  Indonesian  Central \nSecurities  Depository  (KSEI)  is  a  nonprofit  SRO  which  performs  depository  and  settlement \nfunction.  KSEI  was  founded  in  December  1997.  The  three  SROs  (JSX,  SSX,  and  KPEI)  own \n16.5%  of  KSEI  shares,  9  custodian  banks  own  36%,  31  securities  companies  own  33.5%,  4 \nregistrars  own  4%,  and  the  remaining  10%  is  kept  in  the  form  of  treasury  stock.  KSEI\u2019s  main \nrole  is  to  facilitate  central  securities  depository  requirements,  including  the  deposition  of \nsecurities  that  are  either  traded  on  Indonesian  stock  exchanges  or  over-the-counter,  and  the \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nmanagement  of  securities  accounts  owned  by  securities  companies  and  custodian  banks  in \nKSEI\u2019s system.  \n \n\nTable A2.11: Market Intermediaries \n \n\nInstitutions \nStock Exchanges \nClearing Guarantee Corporation \nCentral Securities and Depositories \nSecurities Company \nSupporting Institution \nSupporting Profession \nInvestment Advisor/Credit Rating Company \nSource: BAPEPAM-LK. 2006. \n\n \n\nNumber \n2 \n1 \n1 \n125 \n32 \n2,695 \n18 \n\n20. \nOther  Products  and  Services.

A presidential decree \non  secondary  mortgage  financing  was  issued  in  February  2005  establishing  the  Secondary \nMortgage  Corporation  (PT  Sarana  Multigriya  Finansial).  Its  function  is  to  purchase  qualified \nmortgages  from  financial  institutions  and  issue  bonds  backed  by  these  assets.  The  target \nmarket  for  these  mortgage-backed  securities  will  be  long-term  investors,  such  as  insurance \ncompanies and pension funds. It is expected that, during PT SMF\u2019s first 3 years of operations, it \nwill lend to financial institutions, which will on-lend for qualifying mortgages, in order to build up \na  critical  mass  of  primary  mortgage  receivables.  The  loans  will  help  build  qualified  mortgage \nportfolios  for  purchase  by  PT  SMF,  as  well  as  a  track  record  for  lower-  and  middle-income \nsectors of society. \n \n\nTable A2.12: Products and Intermediaries \nVariance of Products in Indonesian Capital Markets (JSX & SSX) \n\nProduct \n\nDetails \n\n  \nExisting Products \n\nEquities \n\n  \n \n344 equities traded in JSX & \nSSX \n\nEquity-based derivatives \nGovernment bonds \nCorporate bonds \nTotal \nNew Products \nExchange Traded Fund \nSukuk (government-sharia bond) \nIndonesian Depository Receipt \nAsset-based Securities \nSecondary Mortgage Facility \nReal Estate Investment Trusts \nSingle Stock Future \n\n3698 contracts traded \nTraded in SSX \nTraded in SSX \n \n \nTo be launched in 2007 \nTo be launched in 2007 \nTo be launched in 2007 \nTo be launched in 2007-2008 \nTo be launched in 2008 \nLaunch date not available \nLaunch date not available \n\nJSX = Jakarta Stock Exchange, SSX = Surabaya Stock Exchange. \nSource: Bapepam-LK. \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nTransaction Value \nin 2006 \n\n(Rp trillion) \n\n% \n\n451.0 \n\n47 \n\n0.6 \n435.6 \n67.8 \n955.0 \n\n0 \n46 \n7 \n100 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n41 \n\n \n\nDEVELOPMENT COORDINATION MATRIX \n\n \nBanking and Formal Credit \n(including SMEs and trade \nfinance) \n\nCapital Markets, Corporate \nGovernance, and Nonbank \nFinancial Institutions  \n\nADB \n\nRural and Microfinance \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFinancial Sector and Social Security Reform Program \n\nTimeframe: 2002\u20132004 \n\n\u2022 \n\u2022  Budget: $250 million (policy-based) loan \n\nSupport for financial sector and social security-related reforms \n \nEstablishment of a Financial Services Authority \n\n\u2022 \nTimeframe: 2002\u20132007 \n\u2022  Budget: $1,500,000 TA grant \n\nTechnical and capacity building support to Bapepam-LK \n \nDevelopment of an anti-money-laundering Regime (Phase II) \n\n\u2022 \nTimeframe: 2004\u20132006 \n\u2022  Budget: $500,000 TA grant \n\nTechnical and capacity-building support to PPATK for implementation of the \nanti-money-laundering regime \nSME Export Development Project \n\n \n\nTimeframe: 2002\u20132007 \n\u2022 \n\u2022  Budget $85 million loan \n\n(credit line) \n\nAustralia \n\nAusAID \nTechnical Assistance Management Facility (TAMF) III  \n\n\u2022 \nTimeframe: 2004-2009 \n\u2022  Budget: Aus$26 million total; \n\nCurrent annual budget approx.

Efforts  will  be  concentrated  on  reforms  to  strengthen  price \ninformation and discovery through bond trade reporting and on moving towards real time price \ninformation. This will be facilitated by the establishment of a bond pricing agency, expected by \n2008.  Subprogram  2  will  enable  prompt  public  disclosure  of  changes  in  beneficial  ownership \nbeyond 5% in the shareholding of any listed company. Secondary market liquidity will be further \nenhanced  through  better  coordination  between  Bapepam-LK  and  Bank  Indonesia,  wider \nacceptance of the repurchase agreement, development of a centralized borrowing and lending \nprogram  for  government  bonds,  revised  rules  on  short  selling  and  margin  trading, issuance  of \nshort-term T-bills of various maturities extended up to 1 year, market-making obligations being \ncarried  out  by  the  primary  dealers,    and  increased  float  and  supply  of  securities  through  the \nprivatization  of  selected  state-owned  enterprises.  New  products  such  as  sharia-compliant \ngovernment bonds (sukuks), municipal bonds, hedging  instruments such as stock options and \nindex-based  options,  and  asset-backed  securities  will  be  developed  and  issued  during  the \nprogram period.   \n \n2. \nInsurance  companies  will  be  allowed  to  hold  a  more  diversified  services  portfolio.  The \npossibility  of  allowing  the  pension  industry  to  invest  in  foreign  assets  will  be  examined. \nProposed  amendments  to  the  Capital  Market  Law  designed  to  demutualize  the  merged \nexchanges  will  be  submitted  to  parliament.  Amendments  to  the  tax  laws  to  address  tax \ndisincentives for financial instruments will also be considered by the parliament. \n \n3. \nMarket  surveillance  and  investor  protection  will  be  enhanced  under  subprogram  2 \nthrough  the  implementation  of  the  regulatory  framework  proposing  greater  financial  and \noperational autonomy to Bapepam-LK. In parallel, proposed amendments to the Capital Market, \nInsurance  and  Pension  Laws  designed  to  achieve  greater  compliance  with  international \nstandards will also be submitted to parliament for approval. Legal immunity will be provided to \nthe staff of Bapepam-LK through these amendments. International cooperation will be enhanced \nwhen  Bapepam-LK  develops  and  implements  the  International  Organization  of  Securities \nCommissions  (IOSCO)  MOU  action  plan.  Bapepam-LK  will  also  develop  centralized \nenforcement  functions  over  all  nonbank  financial  institutions  and  organize  an  enforcement \nbureau along functional lines. Risk-based parameters and minimum capital requirements will be \nreviewed  and  updated  in  line  with  international  standards  for  the  insurance  industry.  The \npension  industry  will  also  move  towards  a  risk-based  approach  to  supervision.  Investor \nprotection  will  be  enhanced  through  an  implementation  plan  for  a  securities  market  investor \nprotection  fund.  Provisions  governing  conflict  of  interest  will  be  strengthened  through  the \nproposed amendments to the Capital Market Law. Rules for using the new bond pricing agency \nquotes as the benchmark for valuation and pricing of collective investment schemes and units \nwill  be  issued  under  subprogram  2.  The  Financial  System  Stability  Forum,  comprising  Bank \nIndonesia, Bapepam-LK and LPS, will provide a platform for exchanging information and ideas, \nand coordinating regulatory and supervisory activities of the three member agencies.  \n \n4. \nGovernance  and  human  resource  capacity  in  the  nonbank  financial  sector  will  be \nenhanced under subprogram 2. Capacity for compliance with anti-money-laundering regulations \nby nonbank financial institutions will be strengthened. Amendments to the current anti-money-\nlaundering law will be drafted to comply with revised FATF 40+9 recommendations, proving for \nreorganization of financial transactions reports and an analysis center. A medium-term capacity-\nbuilding program to enhance the skills and staff of Bapepam-LK as well as the industry will be \n\n \n\n\f64 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nadopted  and  implemented  under  subprogram  2  with  significant  budgetary  support  from  the \nGovernment  and  complemented  by  ADB  technical  assistance  resources  of  $1,200,000 \n(Appendix 7). \n \nThe  policy  reforms  under  subprogram  2  are  indicative  and  the  scope  and  schedule  of \n5. \nsubprogram  2  will  be  modified  as  necessary,  based  on  a  review  of  the  achievements  under \nsubprogram  1.  This  will  provide  flexibility  in  program  design,  as  adjustments  can  be  made  on \nthe basis of the results of subprogram 1 and changes in the external environment. Subprogram \n2 will be subject to the approval of ADB\u2019s Board of Directors. \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n65 \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nIntroduction \n\nBackground and Issues \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nTo  support  implementation  of  the  Capital  Market  Development  Program  Cluster,  the \nRepublic  of  Indonesia  asked  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  provide  technical \nassistance  (TA).  A  TA  grant  of  $700,000  is  included  in  the  2007  assistance  program  under \nADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  2006\u201320091 for  Indonesia.  This  will  be  supplemented  by \ncofinancing  support  equivalent  to  not  more  than  $500,000  from  the  Financial  Sector \nDevelopment Partnership Fund (FSDP)2 on a grant basis. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nCapital Markets Supervisory  Agency (Bapepam-LK). Financial sector regulation and \nsupervision  are  under  the  authority  of  two  supervisory  authorities.  Banks  are  regulated  and \nsupervised  by  the  central  bank,  Bank  Indonesia.  The  Capital  Markets  Supervisory  Agency \n(Bapepam)  was  established  in  1976  under  Presidential  Decree  No.  52/1976  and  given \nresponsibility  for  the  regulation  and  day-to-day  supervision  of  capital  markets  in  Indonesia. \nBapepam is accountable to and reports to the Minister of Finance.  The Ministry of Finance is \nresponsible  for  development  of  high-level  policy  matters,  with  Bapepam  having  reasonable \nautonomy in relation to the conduct of investigations, inspections and other regulatory functions. \nIn  addition  to  Bapepam's  role  in  regulating  capital  markets,  the  Commodities  Futures  Trading \nRegulatory Agency is responsible for regulating and supervising commodity futures trading and \nreports to the Minister of Trade. \n \n3. \nIn 2004, the Ministry of Finance prepared an action plan to improve the regulation and \nsupervision  of  the  nonbank  financial  sector.  The  insurance,  pension,  finance,  and  venture-\ncapital companies were regulated by the Directorate General of Financial Institutions (DGFI) in \nthe Ministry of Finance until 2005, when a presidential decree merging Bapepam and DGFI was \npassed.  The  merger  of  Bapepam  and  the  DGFI  into  Bapepam-LK  and  the  endorsement  of  a \nplan  for  continued  improvements  in  the  regulatory  and  supervisory  structure  of  the  newly \ncreated  merged  agency  were  a  significant  step  toward  strengthening  supervision  of  financial \nservices in the nonbank sector. The legal and regulatory framework for supervision will also be \nimproved through amendments to the Capital Market, Pension and Insurance Laws. To increase \nthe  financial  and  operational  autonomy  of  Bapepam-LK  further  changes  to  the  regulatory \nframework and capacity building will be needed. Bapepam-LK has submitted a proposal to allow \nit  to  recruit  staff  directly  from  the  general  labor  market  rather  than  being  limited  to  a  pool  of \navailable  civil  servants.  Salaries  for  Bapepam-LK  staff  are  no  longer  tied  to  the  general  civil \nservice pay scale, allowing the agency to compete more effectively for able recruits and to retain \nthem.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  has  recently  approved  a  tripling  of  Bapepam-LK  salaries.  To \ndevelop  and  motivate  these  staff,  it  will  be  crucial  for  Bapepam-LK  to  put  in  place  a  well-\ndesigned capacity-building program. \n \n4. \nCapacity Building for Capital Market Development.  The Program is predicated upon \nthe development of a modern risk-based, supervision and regulatory framework for the capital \nmarkets  and  contractual  savings  industries.  This  framework  will  stress  investor  protection, \nmarket  development,  and  system  stability.  This  requires  staff  with  graduate  level  education  in \n\n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program (2006-2009): Republic of Indonesia.

Funding to be administered by ADB. \n\n \n\n\f66 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nactuarial science and finance and experience in regulatory practices and market surveillance in \ndeveloped  markets.  Acquiring  these  skills  is  a  pre-condition  for  success  but  a  very  major \nchallenge over the medium term.  \n \nImplementation  of  the  reforms  supported  under  the  Program  and  the  extent  of  their \n5. \neffectiveness  and  sustainability  depends  not  only  on  the  availability  of  adequate  capacity  in \nBapepam-LK,  but  also  within  capital  market  self  regulatory  organizations  (SROs),  and  in  the \nindustry in general.  Many of the skills required for effective regulation and supervision of capital \nmarkets (as well as effective compliance) are highly specialized and require significant on-the-\njob and advanced formal training.   \n \n6. \nIn  the  short  term,  capacity-building  support  will  be  provided  to  Bapepam-LK  under  this \nassociated  TA.  However,  this  support  needs  to  be  complemented  by  a  medium-  to  long-term \ninitiative to build up a critical mass of staff with relevant skills in Bapepam-LK and the industry in \ngeneral.  This should include support for: (i) scholarships for staff from Bapepam-LK and other \ncapital  market  institutions  for  advanced  degrees  or  other  forms  of  training,  and  (ii)  the \nestablishment of local institutions focused on applied research and training tailored to the needs \nof  Bapepam-LK  and  other  capital  market-related  institutions  as  well  as  to  industry  more \ngenerally. \n \nThe importance of this capacity-building initiative is recognized by both the Government \n7. \nand  the  industry  and  discussions  have  been  underway  for  some  time  among  government \nagencies,  industry  associations,  and  local  universities.3   The  Program  aims  to  support  these \nefforts  and  lend  momentum  to  them  via  the  associated  TA  which  will  help  meet  immediate \nneeds and allow for a systematic approach to medium- and longer-term efforts.  \n \n8. \nThe Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) is shortly to implement a \ntechnical  assistance  project  under  which  change  management  and  human  resources  experts \nwill  be  engaged  to  help  Bapepam-LK  develop  its  human  resources  department  and  plans  to \nmove towards a more functional approach to regulation. This project is expected to complement \npolicy actions within Bapepam-LK and to identify additional training requirements.  \n \nThe  TA  associated  with  the  Program  will  address  immediate  and  short-term  capacity-\n9. \nbuilding  needs  and  complement  the  change  management  assistance  being  provided  by \nAusAID.  The  Government  has  agreed  to  commit,  through  its  normal  budgetary  processes, \nappropriate provisions for human development to sustain capacity building over the medium to \nlong term.4 \n \nC. \n \n10. \nBapepam-LK. It will provide capacity-building support in five main areas: \n \n\nThe  TA  will  draw  upon  the  findings  of  a  human  resources  skills  audit  conducted  by \n\nThe Technical Assistance \n\n(i) \n\nestablishment of a database and improvements to basic applied research skills in \nBapepam-LK\u2019s newly established research bureau; \n\n                                                 \n3  For example, MOF has proposed the establishment of a Capital Markets Institute within the University of Indonesia. \n4  A study  was carried out under a previous TA project to broadly define a medium-term capacity-building program, \nincluding  the  cost  of  carrying  out  the  above  exercise  (ADB.  2002.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Government  of \nIndonesia for Establishing a Financial Services Authority. Manila).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n67 \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nexternal  on-the-job  training  for  Bapepam-LK  staff  through  secondments  with \nregulators in other jurisdictions;  \nshort courses by local training institutions in collaboration with outside experts to \ndevelop the market surveillance and regulatory skills of Bapepam-LK staff; \ncurricula for training programs and standards for certification for professionals in \nfields  related  to  capital  markets  (e.g.,  actuaries  for  general  insurance  and \nsurveillance training for SRO staff); and \nan  econometric  model  and  related  capacity  to  improve  understanding  of  the \nvulnerabilities  in  the  nonbank  financial  sector  by  the  Financial  System  Stability \nForum.  \n\nCost and Financing \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nThe  TA  will  also  provide  focused  support  for  the  implementation  of  selected  reforms \n\n \n11. \nunder the Program. \n \nD. \n \nThe  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  a  total  $1,500,000  equivalent,  of  which  ADB  will  provide \n12. \n$700,000 to be financed from the ADB Technical Assistance Special Fund. A further $500,000 \nequivalent will be provided from the Financial Sector Development Partnership Fund on a grant \nbasis  and  will  be  administered  by  ADB.  The  Government  will  provide  the  remaining  $300,000 \nequivalent by providing counterpart staff and other support facilities (Table A7). \n \nE. \n \nBapepam-LK will be the executing agency for the TA and the research bureau will serve \n13. \nas  the  main  focal  point.  Bapepam-LK  will  provide  office  space,  counterpart  staff,  and  other \nservices  to  the  consultants.  It  will  closely  coordinate  with  other  stakeholders  involved  in  TA \nimplementation. A capital markets capacity-building committee comprising representatives from \nBapepam-LK and the MOF will be established to provide guidance on the allocation and use of \ntraining-related  funds  under  the  TA.  In  collaboration  with  the  consultants  and  the  local \nuniversities, the committee will help to develop curricula for training programs and standards for \ncertification  for  professionals  in  capital  market-related  fields  and  will  select  degree  and/or \ntraining programs and candidates that qualify for scholarship support. A project coordinator will \nprovide  general  administrative  support  for  TA  implementation  and  will  be  responsible  for \noverseeing the implementation of training programs in collaboration with the consultants and the \ncapital markets capacity-building committee. The TA will be implemented over 24 months and is \nexpected to commence in February 2008 and to be completed by January 2010.  \n \n14. \nThe  TA  will  involve  a  combination  of  international  and  national  consultants  to  be \nengaged in response to requirements that will be identified during the course of implementation \nof  the  capacity-building  exercise.  It  is  expected  that  this  will  include:  28  person-months  of \ninternational  consultancy  services  focused  on  capital-market-related  capacity  building,  course \ndevelopment,  and  establishment  of  professional  standards  and  certification;  and  24  person-\nmonths of domestic consultancy services focused on developing a database and basic applied \nresearch  skills  within  Bapepam-LK\u2019s  newly  established  research  bureau.    Consultants  will  be \nengaged on an individual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the \nengagement  of  domestic  consultants.  Outline  terms  of  reference  will  be  developed  in \nconsultation  with  relevant  government  counterparts.  All  consultants  will  submit  an  inception \nreport detailing their draft work plan and schedule within 1 week of fielding and provide concise, \nregular  updates  to  Bapepam-LK  and  ADB  outlining  progress  and  identifying  implementation \n\n \n\n\f68 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nissues.  Where  appropriate,  midterm,  draft  final,  and  final  reports  will  also  be  submitted \naccording  to  a  schedule  agreed  with  Bapepam-LK  and  ADB.  All  services,  equipment,  and \nmaterial to support implementation of the TA will be procured by direct purchase in accordance \nwith  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Equipment  will \ninclude  computer  hardware  and  software  related  to  the  database  for  Bapepam-LK.  All \nequipment procured under the TA will be handed over to Bapepam-LK upon completion of the \nTA.

One of the five priority areas is achieving macroeconomic stability with fiscal sustainability and financial sector \nreforms.  In  addition,  recognizing  that  macroeconomic  and  sector  reforms  will  be  vital  to  attracting  greater  private \nsector investments, the Government has begun to articulate a short- and medium-term reform agenda in the financial \nsector.  Indonesia\u2019s  capital  market  master  plan  (2005\u20132009),  and  the  Government\u2019s  annual  financial  sector  policy \npackage (2006 and 2007) are geared toward increasing the credibility and integrity of the Indonesian financial sector \nand  enhancing  the  effectiveness  of  the  regulation  and  supervision  of  the  financial  services  in  Indonesia.  Stronger \npublic  finances  will  enable  increases  in  social  expenditure  and  investments.  A  strong,  resilient,  and  more  diversified \nfinancial  sector  will  support  growth  and  investments  and  indirectly  contribute  to  poverty  reduction.  A  financial  sector \nthat functions efficiently is vital to support enterprise development and job creation.   \nB. \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nBecause the Capital Market Development Program Cluster is a general intervention, no specific poverty analysis was \nundertaken,  as  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  poverty  assessment  for  Indonesia  was  recently  concluded  and  this \nprovides an in-depth analysis. The Program is anchored in the Government\u2019s medium-term development plan, which \nhas clear targets for poverty reduction based on overall growth targets for the economy.  \nC.

The \npolicy measures include a set of reforms to promote the diversification of financial channels by \nenhancing  the  growth  and  development  of  the  capital  markets.  The  Program  is  a  program \ncluster  with  two  subprograms.  Subprogram  2  is  expected  to  be  ready  for  Asian  Development \nBank  (ADB)  Board  consideration  about  18  months  after  subprogram  1.  This  environmental \nassessment report examines the environmental impacts of the policy component of the Program. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nbasis of four components for the proposed Program: \n \n\nThe  reform  agenda  is  structured  around  the  following  policy  outcomes,  which  form  the \n\nDescription of the Policy Interventions \n\nenhancing information disclosure and price discovery, \npromoting deeper and more liquid financial markets, \nimproving market surveillance and investor protection, and \nstrengthening governance and human resource capacity. \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n \n3. \nThe  Program  is  embedded  in  the  Government\u2019s  medium-term  reform  agenda  and  the \ntwo-tranche structure will provide the Government with the flexibility to adjust the program and \nits speed of implementation according to country developments. \n\n \n\nTable A9: Environmental Assessment of the Policy Interventions \n\nPolicy Area \n\nEconomic and Social \nOutcome \n\nEnvironmental \nImpact \n\nMitigation \nMeasures \n\n1.
