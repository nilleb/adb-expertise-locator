The \nGovernment  of  Viet  Nam  has  requested  a  sector  loan  from  ADB\u2019s  OCR  and  a  sector  loan \nfunded through participation of the AIF to help finance the project.2 The project is included in the \ncountry operations business plan, 2014\u20132016 for Viet Nam.3 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n1. \n\nSocioeconomic Context and Sector Performance \n\nViet Nam\u2019s economy grew steadily at an average annual rate of 6.3% during 2005\u20132012, \n3. \nand  gross  domestic  product  per  capita  increased  from  $699  to  $1,755  in  the  same  period. \nEconomic growth  was  accompanied  by  an  average  growth  in  electricity  demand  of  12.6%  per \nannum  during  2005\u20132012,  while  per  capita  consumption  increased  from  156  kilowatt-hours \n(kWh)  in  1995  to  1,187  kWh  in  2012.  Viet  Nam  also  achieved  notable  progress  in  household \nelectrification\u2014from  50%  in  1995  to  over  97%  by  2012\u2014while  reducing  the  poverty  rate  from \n15.5% in 2006 to 11.1% in 2012. \n \n\n2. \n\nInstitutional Arrangements \n\n4. \nThe  Ministry  of  Industry  and  Trade  has  policy  and  supervisory  responsibilities  for  the \nenergy sector, both as the line ministry and as the ministry with oversight responsibility for the \nstate-owned energy enterprises. Vietnam Electricity (EVN), the main power utility in Viet Nam, is \norganized as a holding company with a series of wholly owned subsidiaries including the three \npower  generation  corporations; 4  the  National  Power  Transmission  Corporation,  which  is \nresponsible for the  500 kV  and  220 kV  transmission  system;  and the five  power  corporations5 \nthat  are  responsible for  the  distribution  and  retail  of  electricity  at  voltage  levels  below  110 kV, \nand for developing and operating 220 kV assets in their respective licensed areas. Hanoi Power \nCorporation (EVN HANOI) and Ho Chi Minh City Power Corporation (EVN HCMC), in particular, \nare the entities in charge of the largest load centers. Ha Noi is home to 6.5 million people and \nHo Chi Minh City has a population of 7.4 million, and together they account for 16% of the total \npopulation. \n \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance: ADB. 2011.

Expanding  the  power  system\u2019s  capacity  sustainably  to  meet  the  rapidly \ngrowing electricity demand is a key priority of the government. According to the seventh power \ndevelopment plan (PDP7),6 demand is expected to grow from 120 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2012 \nto  330  TWh  in  2020,  and  potentially  to  700  TWh  by  2030.  Thus,  generation  capacity  is  to  be \nstrengthened from 26.5 gigawatts (GW) in 2012 to 70.5 GW in 2020, and over 8,000 kilometers \nof  500  kV  lines  and  15,000  kilometers  of  220  kV  lines  will  be  constructed  to  transmit  the \ngenerated  power  to  the  load  centers.7 The  total  investment  needs  for  the  power  sector  up  to \n2020 are estimated to be $48.8 billion, of which $16.3 billion is for grid expansion. \n \n6. \nIn  the  distribution  subsector,  the  combined  peak  load  in  Ha  Noi  and  Ho  Chi  Minh  City \namounted to more than 6.1 GW in 2012, or 23% of the total domestic load, and is expected to \nnearly  double  to  11.2  GW  by  2020.  The  investment  needs  during  2015\u20132020  are  $1.1  billion \neach for EVN HANOI and EVN HCMC.8 \n \nFinancial. The foremost challenge of the power utilities is to mobilize the vast financing \n7. \nfor the above investment requirements while maintaining their financial sustainability. Although \nthere  are  investments  made  by  non-EVN  state-owned  enterprises  and  domestic  and  foreign \nprivate  investors  for  power  generation,  a  large  share  of  the  investments  are  made  by  EVN \nthrough  financing  from  commercial  banks  and  development  partners.  External  borrowings \nduring  2014\u20132015  are  projected  to  average  about  $130  million  per  year  for  EVN  HANOI,  and \n$80 million per year for EVN HCMC. \n \nThe retail tariff schedules are set by the government uniformly across the whole country. \n8. \nWhile the average retail tariff has increased by 79% in nominal terms during 2007\u20132013, it has \ndecreased by 15% in real terms. Moreover, the current average retail tariff of about D1,500/kWh \n(\u00a27.14/kWh) is much lower than the long-run marginal cost estimated to be in the range of \u00a28\u2013\n\u00a29/kWh.  Adequate  and  gradual  tariff  increases  are  required  to  ensure  the  long-term  financial \nsustainability of the power sector. \n \n\n4. \n\nPower Sector Reform and Modernization \n\n9. \nViet  Nam\u2019s  sector  reform  program  began  in  1995,  and  ADB  has  supported  it  with  six \ntechnical assistance (TA) projects between 1995 and 2009.9 The 2004 Electricity Law provided \nthe legal basis for the ongoing reforms, which are being implemented in line with the road map \nfor  establishing  an  electricity  market  in  three  phases:  (i)  phase  1\u2014competitive  generation \nmarket  until  2014;  (ii)  phase  2\u2014pilot  competitive  wholesale  market  from  2015,  and  full \n                                                \n6  Government  of  Viet  Nam.  2011.

The Electricity Regulatory Authority of Viet Nam (ERAV) is now preparing phase 2 \nwith  the  support  of  development  partners,  while  ADB  will  dispatch  resident  advisors  to  assist \nERAV  through  an  existing  TA. 11  Additional  TA  projects  to  prepare  ERAV  and  the  market \nparticipants,  including  the  power  corporations,  are  also  being  discussed  and  coordinated  with \nthe development partners. \n \nThe government aims to reduce its energy intensity and increase the reliability of power \n10. \nsupply through system modernization and removal of constraints in the power grid. Viet Nam\u2019s \nelasticity ratio of electricity consumption growth to gross domestic product growth has averaged \naround 2.0. The PDP7 calls for reducing it to 1.5 by 2015, and to 1.0 by 2020. EVN has steadily \nreduced  system  losses  from  12.2%  in  2003  to  9.2%  in  2012.  At  the  distribution  level,  EVN \nHANOI  aims to reduce system  losses from  7.1%  in 2012  to 6.0%  by  2020,  while  EVN  HCMC \nplans a reduction from 5.6% in 2012 to 5.0% in 2020. To further improve system reliability, both \npower corporations aim to reduce their respective system average interruption duration index by \n30%\u201340% by 2015.12 Their index numbers are very high compared with the standards of utilities \nin developed countries because antiquated equipment and inadequate capacity of the networks \ncause overloading and short circuits. \n \n\n5. \n\nADB\u2019s Sector Experience \n\n11. \nThe energy sector is one of the priority sectors in ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for \nViet  Nam,  2012\u20132015, 13  which  indicates  that  assistance  will  focus  on  sector  reforms  and \ninvestments in the development of the transmission network and energy efficiency. The project \nis  consistent  with  the  draft  Energy  Sector  Assessment,  Strategy,  and  Road  Map.  Since  1994, \nADB  has  provided financing  of  $2.32  billion  to  Viet  Nam\u2019s  energy  sector  investments  and  has \nprovided support through various TA projects, including those that helped initiate power sector \nreforms.  A key  lesson  is that  project  implementation  can  incur  delays  if  (i) project readiness  is \nlow  at  the  start  of  the  project,  (ii)  procurement  packages  are  made  excessively  small  to \nencourage participation of local bidders, (iii) adequate support is not provided to prepare bidding \ndocuments  and  bid  evaluation  reports,  and  (iv)  support  is  not  provided  to  monitor  safeguard \nmeasures.  The  project  mitigates  these  risks  through  a  higher  degree  of  readiness  of  core \nsubprojects\u2014bidding  documents  being  prepared  under  advance  contracting,  and  provision  of \nproject implementation consultants (PICs) for procurement matters and for safeguard monitoring \nand  implementation. While  the  number  of  procurement  packages  tends  to  be  larger  for  sector \nprojects  that  involve  multiple  subprojects,  packages  for  this  project  were,  whenever  possible, \neither  consolidated  into  larger  contracts  or  grouped  into  lots  under  single  procurement \npackages. \n \n\n6. \n\nRationale for Sector Loan Modality \n\nThe  power  sector  is  being  developed  consistently  and  in  line  with  the  PDP7,  and  the \n\n12. \n                                                \n10 Government  of  Viet  Nam.  2006.

Manila. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nrelevant policies in the energy sector  are assessed to be appropriately contributing to  meeting \nthe  growing  demand  for  energy  needed  for  socio-economic  development.  The  successful \nimplementation  by  EVN  HANOI  and  EVN  HCMC  of  sector  lending  projects  funded  by \ndevelopment  partners  demonstrates  the  executing  agencies\u2019  capacity  to  implement  the \ndevelopment  plan.  The  modality  has  been  recommended  in  project  completion  reports  of  two \nsimilar  ADB-financed  projects  with  multiple  subprojects  to  allow  flexibility  toward  changes  in \nproject  scope  and  subprojects  during  implementation. 14 The  sector  loan  approach  will  also \nassist  EVN  in  improving  its  sector  policies  and  strengthening  the  institutional  capacity  of  its \nsubsidiaries. The World Bank\u2019s ongoing Distribution Efficiency Project helps strengthen financial \nmanagement  and  investment  planning  capacity  of  the  power  corporations,  while  an  additional \nTA  by  ADB  is  envisaged  to  build  the  capacity  of  the  power  corporations  to  participate  in  the \ncompetitive wholesale market.15 \n \n\n7. \n\nDevelopment Partner Coordination \n\n13. \nGiven  the  magnitude  and  complexity  of  reforms  and  the  financing  requirements  in  the \npower sector, the project has been developed through in-depth coordination with development \npartners. This allows to collectively support sector reform and power infrastructure development \nin response to the rapidly growing demand for electricity. ADB\u2019s operations in the energy sector \nleverage cofinancing and encourage joint initiatives with other development partners.16 \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n14. \nThe  project\u2019s  impact  will  be  that  growth  in  national  electricity  demand  is  met  in  a \nsustainable  manner,  and  the  outcome  will  be  improved  reliability  and  efficiency  of  electricity \nsupply in Ha Noi and Ho Chi Minh City. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  project\u2019s  outputs,  categorized  into  four  distinct  groups  to  enable  more  focused \n15. \nmonitoring  of  project  performance,  are  the  development  and/or  rehabilitation  of  (i)  four  core \nsubstation  and  transmission  line  subprojects  in  Ha  Noi,  (ii)  four  core  substation  and \ntransmission  line  subprojects  in  Ho  Chi  Minh  City,  (iii)  up  to  20  noncore  substation  and \ntransmission line subprojects in Ha Noi, and (iv) up to nine noncore substation and transmission \nline subprojects in Ho Chi Minh City. \n \n16. \nEight  core  subprojects  which  are  representative  of  the  types  of  subprojects  to  be \nfinanced through the  project  have been  identified  and  appraised  under  the  project  preparatory \nTA  to  serve  as  models  for  the  executing  agencies  to  base  their  appraisal  of  the  remaining \nnoncore  subprojects.  Bidding  documents  for  several  packages  are  under  preparation  by  both \nEVN  HANOI  and  EVN  HCMC  through  advance  contracting.

The  government  has \nrequested  a  loan  of  $172.70  million  from  ADB\u2019s  OCR,  and  a  loan  of  $100.00  million  funded \nthrough  the  participation  of  AIF.17 The  OCR  loan  will  have  a  20-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  5  years,  straight-line  repayment  method,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan and project agreements. Based on this, the average loan maturity is 12.75 years and there \nis no maturity premium payable to ADB. The AIF-funded loan will have the same tenure as the \nADB loan, and an interest rate determined in accordance with its LIBOR-based lending facility, \nand it will finance the same subprojects and components as the OCR loan on a pro-rata basis.18 \nThe government will relend the proceeds of the OCR and AIF-funded loans to EVN HANOI and \nEVN  HCMC  pursuant  to  subsidiary  loan  agreements  with  terms  and  conditions  acceptable  to \nADB. \n \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nItem \nA. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \nB. \nC. \n\n \n\n \n\nBase Costb \n\n1.

They  involve  rehabilitation  of  dilapidated  substation  equipment, \ndevelopment of new substation transformer capacities in the power grid system, and expansion \nof the 110 kV and 220 kV transmission lines. The core subprojects and the  indicative noncore \nsubprojects  use  established  transmission  line  and  substation  technologies  with  which  the \nexecuting agencies are familiar. \n \n22. \nThe project will enable more electricity to be supplied in Ha Noi and Ho Chi Minh City, \nimprove system reliability, and decrease system losses by reducing overloading. The project will \ncontribute  to  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions  by  460,000  tonnes  of  carbon  dioxide \nequivalent per year through replacing suppressed demand which may otherwise be supplied by \ndiesel-powered self-generation, and through system loss reduction.21  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nA  financial  analysis  has  been  carried  out  individually  for  the  core  subprojects  in \n23. \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects.22   All  financial  costs \nand  benefits  are  expressed  in  constant  2013  prices.  Cost  streams  used  to  determine  the \nfinancial internal rate of return\u2014capital investment, and operation and maintenance\u2014reflect the \ncost of delivering the estimated benefits. The financial internal rates of return of 12.2%\u201337.0% \ncompare favorably with the weighted average cost of capital of 4.9%.23 \n \n24. \nThe  economic  viability  takes  into  account  streams  of  costs  and  benefits  resulting  from \nthe  project.  The  economic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRRs)  of  the  core  subprojects,  calculated \nindividually in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects,24 range \nfrom 12.2% to 35.9%, which compares favorably with the 12% opportunity cost of capital. The \nsubproject selection procedure includes a criterion that, for a noncore subproject to be eligible, it \nshould have an EIRR equal to or greater than 12%, or  an EIRR of not less than 10%  if it is a \nsubproject with significant unquantifiable benefits.25 \n \n                                                \n20 Subproject Eligibility Criteria and Selection Procedure (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 Applied  emissions  factors  are  624.4  tonnes  of  carbon  dioxide  per  GWh  for  the  grid  and  764.0  tonnes  of  carbon \ndioxide  per  GWh  for  diesel-generation.

To  ensure  long-term  financial  sustainability  of  the  executing  agencies,  the \ngovernment  shall  continue  to  implement  effective  tariff  reforms  and  adjust  tariffs  based  on  a \ntransparent  methodology.  ADB  is  also  collaborating  with the World  Bank  on  its  TA  to  improve \nthe financial positions of EVN and its subsidiaries.26 \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n26. \nAssessments  on  project  implementation  capacities,  procurement  capacities,  and \nfinancial  management  concluded  that  the  executing  agencies  have  sufficient  implementation \nfinancial \nexperience  and  resources;  appropriate  procurement  practices;  and  adequate \naccounting,  reporting,  and  audit  systems  to  manage  the  project  accounts  and  the  imprest \naccounts. It may be noted that the Financial Action Task Force has recently confirmed that Viet \nNam  has  significantly  improved  its  performance  in  combating  money  laundering  and  the \nfinancing of terrorism.27 ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto  and  discussed  with  the  government,  EVN  HANOI,  and  EVN  HCMC.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 19). \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n27. \nSince  the  household  electrification  rate  in  Viet  Nam  exceeds  97%,  reliable  supply  of \nelectricity as a result of the project will benefit the population regardless of income and gender, \nespecially since the project targets urban and peri-urban areas. The retail tariff is being adjusted \nperiodically, although the average retail tariff is still low at about D1,500/kWh (\u00a27.14/kWh).28 For \npoorer  consumers  with  monthly  consumption  of  below  50  kWh,  the  lifeline  tariff  is  only \nD993/kWh (\u00a24.73/kWh). In addition, households categorized as poor by the Ministry of Labour\u2013\nInvalids  and  Social  Affairs  receive  a  direct  subsidy  of  D30,000  ($1.42)  per  month  for  energy-\nrelated  expenditures.  While  the  retail  tariff  should  gradually  increase  to  ensure  the  sector\u2019s \nfinancial sustainability, the government is committed to retaining these social safety measures. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n28. \nEnvironment.  The  potential  environmental  impacts  of  the  core  subprojects  were \nconfirmed  to  be  short-term  disturbances  during  construction  that  can  be  mitigated  and \nmanaged,  and  are  not  irreversible.  Therefore,  the  core  subprojects  have  been  classified  as \ninitial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  reports  with \ncategory  B  for  environment,  and \nenvironmental  management  plans  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  (2009) 29  and  are  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website. 30  The  environmental \nassessment and review  framework  was also prepared to guide the preparation of IEEs for the \nnoncore  subprojects.  The  subproject  selection  procedure  includes  a  criterion  that  category  A \nsubprojects  are  not  eligible.

The involuntary resettlement impacts of the core subprojects \nwere  confirmed  to  involve temporary  and permanent  land acquisition for  the  development  and \nrehabilitation of transmission lines and substations, but they are not severe and do not involve \nphysical displacement. The persons affected by the core subprojects were consulted about the \nproject and its impacts and mitigation measures. The core subprojects have been classified as \ncategory B for involuntary resettlement, and resettlement plans have been prepared pursuant to \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (footnote 29) and are disclosed on ADB\u2019s website (footnote \n30). A resettlement framework was also prepared to guide the preparation of resettlement plans \nfor  the  noncore  subprojects.  The  subproject  selection  procedure  includes  a  criterion  that \ncategory  A  subprojects  are  not  eligible.  The  executing  agencies  have  experience  in  the \nimplementation of resettlement plans through projects funded by development partners, and the \nPICs  will  provide  further  support  and  training  to  ensure  appropriate  consultations,  detailed \nmeasurement surveys, disclosure, and payment of compensation. \n \n30. \nand peri-urban areas, and is thus classified as category C. \n  \nF. \n\nIndigenous  people. The project will not affect indigenous people since it targets urban \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n31. \nThe overall risk is assessed to be low. The integrated benefits and impacts are expected \nto  outweigh  the  costs.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and \ndescribed in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.31 \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nContracts are numerous and small. \n\nImplementation is delayed due to \ndelays in noncore subproject \npreparation, land acquisition, or \nprocurement, or due to poor \nperformance of the contractors.  \nTransfer tariffs (bulk supply tariffs) \nfor the executing agencies and the \nretail tariff are not set at adequate \nlevels. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nMitigating Measures \nContracts have been consolidated into fewer and larger packages for the core \nsubprojects,  and  the  executing  agencies  have  agreed  to  take  a  similar \napproach to the noncore subprojects. \nProject  implementation  consultants  will  support  the  executing  agencies  in \nsubproject  preparation  and  implementation.  Utilization  of  loan  proceeds  will \nbe  assessed  during  the  midterm  review,  when  initial  loan  allocation  will  be \nreviewed, to the extent possible,  based on performance-related criteria such \nas loan utilization rate, and quality and timeliness of subproject preparation.  \nProject  assurance  requires  the  government  to  continue  to  reform  its  tariff-\nsetting  mechanism,  so  that  retail  and  transfer  tariffs  (to  the  executing \nagencies) are transparent and in line with international best practice, and are \nset  at  a  level  that  ensures  long-term  financial  sustainability  of  the  executing \nagencies. The Asian Development Bank will continue the policy dialogue with \nthe government and maintain close coordination with development partners. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nThe government, EVN HANOI, and EVN HCMC have assured ADB that implementation \n32. \nof  the  project  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning \nanticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the PAM and loan documents. \n\n                                                \n31 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nThe  government,  EVN  HANOI,  and  EVN  HCMC  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain \n\n \n33. \ncovenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan agreements and project agreement. \n \nThe  OCR  loan  and  the  AIF-funded  loan  are  subject  to  cross-effectiveness.
