The  report  also  describes  the  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  and \nthe  administration  of  TA  to  be  provided  by  the  Financial  Sector  Development  Partnership \nSpecial  Fund, 1 the  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-V)  of  the  Asian  Development \nBank (ADB), and the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for Developing the Capital Market, and \nif the Board approves the proposed policy-based loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to \nme by the Board, approve the TA.2 \n \n2. \nThe  program  will  provide  budget  support  for  enhancing  the  role  of  capital  markets  in \nfinancial intermediation and resource mobilization by improving the allocative efficiency between \nsavings and investment through the expansion and diversification of the investor base.3 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nSlow  capital  market  development.  Government  securities,  equities,  and  corporate \nbonds are the key components of Sri Lanka\u2019s capital market. The total size was approximately \n$50  billion  or  64%  of  the  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  at  the  end  of  2015.  Yet,  the  capital \nmarket  is  less  developed  than  in  other  middle  income  countries.  Government  securities \ndominate.  The  market  capitalization  of  the  Colombo  Stock  Exchange  (CSE)  stagnated  as  a \npercentage  of  GDP  at  about  30%  during  2006\u20132015,  and  there  were  just  eight  initial  public \nofferings during 2013\u20132015.  The corporate bond market is still in a nascent stage. The ratio of \noutstanding  corporate  bonds  to  GDP  is  2%\u2014significantly  lower  than  those  of  other  middle-\nincome countries in Asia.    \n \n4. \nOpening  for  reform.  From  2006  to  2015,  government  support  for  capital  market \ndevelopment was limited. Governments recognized what needed to be done, but reforms were \npiecemeal  largely  due  to  other  priorities.  For  example,  although  demutualization  has  been \ndiscussed for over a decade, the CSE is one of the last remaining mutualized stock exchanges \nin  Asia.  It  is  owned  and  dominated  by  brokers  whose  individual  business  interests  take \nprecedence over the exchange and overall market development. However, the government has \nbecome  increasingly  aware  of  the  need  to  institute  backlogged  reforms  so  that  the  capital \nmarket  can  better  intermediate  savings  and  investments  to  drive  future  economic  growth  and \nhas approached ADB and other development partners for assistance.  \n \n5. \nLimited coordination between the regulators. The opportunities for reform begin with \nthe  capital  market  regulators.  The  most  important  of  these  agencies  are  the    Securities  and \nExchange Commission (SEC), the Insurance Board of Sri Lanka (IBSL), and the Central Bank \nof Sri Lanka (CBSL). There is no updated strategic plan for capital market development and no \nforum  for  the  key  agencies  to  coordinate  their  efforts.  The  current  environment  places  undue \npressure  on  the  banking  sector.  Bank  assets  account  for  almost  60%  of  the  country\u2019s  overall \n\n                                                \n1   Established by ADB. Financing partner: Government of Luxembourg. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance for the Capital Market Development Program. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nfinancial assets, and the sector is not the most appropriate nor does it have the capacity to offer \nthe long-term financing essential for private capital investments and infrastructure projects.4  \n \n6. \nWeak  governance  structures.  There  are  also  opportunities  to  strengthen  the  SEC\u2019s \ngovernance.  To  improve  its  internal  governance,  it  will  introduce  term  limits  and  adopt  better \nqualification criteria for recruiting the SEC members. The SEC\u2019s weaknesses as an enforcement \nagency are demonstrated by the fact that more than a fourth of the companies listed on the CSE \ndo not meet SEC listing requirements. The SEC\u2019s automated online market surveillance system \nis limited in that the data extracted from it cannot be used as evidence in court. Poor compliance \nby  listed  companies  with  reporting  and  other  SEC  requirements  deprives  investors  of  reliable \ninformation.  This  is  compounded  by  the  fact  that  the  country\u2019s  audit  regulator\u2014the  Sri  Lanka \nAccounting  and  Auditing  Standards  Monitoring  Board  (SLAASMB)\u2014does  not  have  resources \nneeded  to  properly  validate  the  financial  statements  of  public  companies.  The  educational  and \nqualification  framework  applied  by  the  securities  industry  is  inadequate  and  leaves  the  sector \nwithout  the  human  resource  capacity  needed  to  execute  and  benefit  fully  from  capital  market \nreform initiatives. This shortfall in knowledge and skills undermines the performance of securities \nand insurance professionals and the level of confidence and interests of retail investors, as well as \nthe integrity of the securities industry and insurance industry. \n \n7. \nLimited  coverage  in  mutual  fund,  pension,  and  insurance  industries.  The  mutual \nfund industry is characterized by limited subscriptions and a very small share of the economy\u2019s \noverall  financial  assets.  The  impediments  to  greater  demand  and  growth  include  uneven  tax \ntreatment  between  unit  trusts  and  other  financial  instruments.  Another  problem  is  that  the \nmutual fund industry is largely owned by banks that perceive mutual fund subscriptions to be in \ncompetition  with  their  savings  deposits.  In  addition,  potential  clients  generally  lack  knowledge \nand understanding of the investment benefits of subscribing to mutual funds. The country\u2019s two \nmain  pension  funds,  the  Employees\u2019  Provident  Fund  (EPF)  and  the  Employees\u2019  Trust  Fund, \nboth invest more than 90% of their assets in government securities. This deprives subscribers of \nthe  EPF  and  Employees\u2019  Trust  Fund  of  the  chance  to  earn  better  returns  through  diversifying \ninto  corporate  securities  and  to  intermediate  savings  to  private  enterprise.  The  insurance \nindustry  has  made  only  small  inroads  into  the  economy.  Its  investments  are  spread  more \nbroadly  across  the  segments  of  the  capital  markets,  but  it  still  needs  reform.  Insurance \ncompanies should adopt recapitalization measures. The incomplete legal segregation of the life \nand  nonlife  operations  of  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  largest  insurance  company,  the  Sri  Lanka  Insurance \nCorporation,  undermines  the  credibility  of  the  regulator.  The  absence  of  a  dispute  resolution \npanel to address the grievances of policy holders undermines the trust of subscribers. \n \n8. \nIncreasing  threat  of  fiscal  dominance.  Sri  Lanka  is  experiencing  pressure  that \nprevents  the  competitive  auctioning  of  government  securities  based  on  market  prices.  It  also \nhampers formulation of a credible government yield curve and a liquid bond market. The current \noperating  framework  of  the  primary  dealer  system  does  not  promote  competitive  bidding.  The \nabsence of an auction calendar makes the timing of auctions and the levels of interest rates less \npredictable.  This  undermines  the  credibility  of  the  primary  market,  as  does  the  rejection  of \nauction  bids  and  the  limited  capital  of  primary  dealers.  Another  major  obstacle  to  the  proper \nfunctioning of the primary dealer system is that no high-level committee of CBSL and Ministry of \nFinance  (MOF)  officials  exists  to  oversee  and  coordinate  on  the  issuing  of  government \n\n                                                \n4  In  addition  to  licensed  banks,  nonbank  financial  institutions  such as  licensed  finance  companies and specialized \nleasing companies account for 9%, contractual savings institutions (including Employees\u2019 Provident Fund) for 19%, \nand CBSL for 12%. http://www.cbsl.gov.lk//htm/english/05_fss/pv/f_1.html  \n\n\f3 \n\nsecurities,  including  the  determination  of  cutoff  yields.  The  absence  of  an  electronic  trading \nsystem  to  capture  all  government  securities  trading  prevents  the  necessary  disclosure  and \ntransparency.  All  of  these  factors  contribute  to  a  deficient  primary  dealer  system  and  point  to \nfinancial repression. The development of a secondary government securities market is inhibited \nbecause  primary  pricing  does  not  reflect  market  fundamentals.  The  development  of  the \nsecondary  government  bond  market  is  also  held  back  by  the  frequent  issuing  of  government \nsecurities with an average series size too small to allow the creation of liquid benchmark issues. \n \nElements missing for stronger capital market. Because the credible government yield \n9. \ncurve and liquid government bond market necessary for it to function properly are lacking, the \ncorporate bond market is underdeveloped. A market in asset-backed securities is also hindered. \nThis is because no legislation exists to accord them bankruptcy-remote status and tax neutrality. \nThe  absence  of  a  central  counterparty  system  and  a  clearing  company  for  exchange-listed \nsecurities  prevents  effective  management  of  settlement risk.  It  also  deters  the  development of \nderivatives  because  the  critical  market  infrastructure  required  for  netting  of  transactions  is  not \navailable.  The  lack  of  such  hedging  instruments  and  mechanisms  are  an  obstacle  to  risk \nmanagement.  The  introduction  of  derivatives  trading  with  a  focus  on  plain  vanilla  instruments \nand under close supervision by the SEC is needed to support a more efficient and liquid capital \nmarket. Structured products, such as mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities, \nshould  be  developed  through  the  enactment  of  a  securitization  act  to  diversify  the  number  of \nfinancial  instruments  available.  The  depth  and  breadth  of  the  capital  market  have  also  been \nrestricted in that many state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have not been listed on the CSE.  \n \n10. \nFuture  potential.  The  government  knows  that  it  must  take  several  important  steps  to \npromote  investment  and  achieve  greater  and  more  sustainable  GDP  growth.  It  can  remove \ncurrent  obstacles  to  this  growth  by  moving  toward  measured  market-based  structural  reforms \nthrough  deregulation  of  the  financial  system  while  laying  the  foundations  to  ensure  financial \nstability  and  resilience.  The  crucial  steps  are  the  strengthening  of  the  existing  legal  and \nregulatory frameworks, continuing improvements in the market\u2019s infrastructure, and empowering \nsuch  institutions  as  the  SEC,  the  IBSL,  and  the  EPF.  Creating  an  efficient,  reliable  capital \nmarket is a prerequisite for attracting more foreign investment. Most foreign investors require a \ngood  enabling  environment  and  market  depth  before  they  will  gain  the  confidence  to  invest. \nCapital  market  reforms  will  be  an  important  complement  to  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  relatively  open  trade \nregime and to the port of Colombo, which is South Asia\u2019s largest and busiest. \n \n11. \nThrust. To address these constraints, the government and ADB have agreed to anchor \nthe Capital Market Development Program to the government\u2019s long-term national capital market \nstrategy,  which  ADB  worked  with  the  government  to  design.  In  addition,  a  crucial  first  tranche \npolicy action was formulated under the program to build strong (i) ownership at the highest level \non the policy front, and (ii) coordination across the agencies. \n \n12. \nThe program will seek to deepen and broaden Sri Lanka\u2019s capital market by (i) extending \nthe government yield curve and thereby promoting a more liquid government bond market and \neventually a more developed corporate bond market; (ii) catalyzing institutional investor demand \nby broadening, deepening, and diversifying the investor base; (iii) strengthening the institutional \nand  regulatory  capacity  of  the  SEC,  the  IBSL,  the  EPF,  and  SLAASMB;  (iv)  developing \nimportant market infrastructure such as a surveillance systems, trading system, and information \nand  communication  technology  systems;  (v)  enhancing  capacity  development  through  training \nand  promoting  financial  literacy;  and  (vi)  enhancing  the  supply  of  alternative  financial \ninstruments such as derivatives to include for commodities and securitized bonds.  \n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nThe program will support financial inclusion by promoting financial literacy among retail \n13. \ninvestors, expanding mutual funds, and developing consumer protection in the insurance sector \nthrough its adoption of grievance mechanisms. \n \nLinkage  between  reform  program  and  budget  support. The structural reforms to be \n14. \ntaken  under  the  program  include  costly  measures,  such  as  the  costs  of  a  significant \nenhancement  in  the  regulatory  and  enforcement  capacity  of  the  SEC  and  the  IBSL  and  of  a \nshort-term increase in the rates of treasury bills and government bonds to align them more with \nmarket  rates.  Budget  support  is  crucial  under  the  program  to  help  cover  the  costs  of \nimplementing the reforms. Since the reforms are an integral part of the government-owned long-\nterm  national  capital  market  strategy,  the  government  is  firmly  committed  to  instituting  the \nactions under the Capital Market Development Program and has the ability and political will to \nimplement the needed reforms (Appendix 3). \n \n15. \nADB  value  addition.  The  government  and  ADB  have  conducted  extensive  policy \ndialogue on capital market development since the early 1990s, and this close engagement has \nmade  ADB  the  lead  development  partner  in  this  effort.5 ADB\u2019s  strength  in  supporting  capital \nmarket development is its ability to take an integrated approach to helping develop, guide, and \ncarry out policy change. The approach covers (i) policy dialogue, (ii) the structure and design of \ntailor-made policy reforms, (iii) policy implementation support, (iv) capacity development through \nTA  to  ensure  sustainability,  and  (v)  procurement  of  information  technology  systems  to \nstrengthen operations. ADB has the high level of credibility, the means, and the capacity to offer \nthis  comprehensive  solutions-based  approach,  which  can  tailor  best  practices  to  the  needs  of \nand  conditions  of  Sri  Lanka.  Given  the  complexities,  resource  and  expertise  requirements  of \nsuch  reforms,  they  may  be  further  delayed,  be  carried  out  piecemeal,  or  not  happen  at  all \nwithout ADB\u2019s involvement. \n \n16.   ADB\u2019s commitment to supporting capital market development in Sri Lanka is long-term, \nand successful implementation of this program will create an environment conducive to follow-\non reforms. Demutualization of the CSE will allow for its subsequent public listing. Greater retail \npenetration of the insurance sector is still a priority. This program creates the preconditions for \npension  reforms,  and  a follow-on  program  could support their  implementation.  Private  pension \nplans and the establishment of a pension regulator are needed. The reform and public listing of \nSOEs  is  a  multiyear  undertaking.  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  current  efforts  to  establish  an  international \nfinancial center may require external support. The derivative market will need years to develop, \nand the establishment of a commodities exchange would provide agricultural producers with a \nway to mitigate price and other risks. \n \n17. \nDevelopment  coordination.  ADB  has  worked  to  closely  coordinate  its  capital  market \ndevelopment  activities  with  those  of  other  development  partners  and  to  complement  their \nefforts. ADB\u2019s program is part of an umbrella operation to support economic recovery led by the \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF). In June 2016, the IMF approved an extended fund facility of \n\n                                                \n5  Since  1993,  ADB  has  approved  15  technical  assistance  projects  supporting  capital  market  development  in  Sri \nLanka  and  two  major  programs,  one  in  2000  and  the  second  in  2004.  This  support  helped  build  the  reform \nmomentum that has led to the Capital Market Development Program. Under the last program, ADB provided a $65 \nmillion loan to Sri Lanka in 2004 for (i) increasing the financial products and services available to capital markets, \n(ii)  enhancing  corporate  governance  in  the  financial  markets,  and  (iii)  improving  regulations  of  the  insurance \nindustry. (ADB. 2004. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loans to \nthe Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Financial Markets Program for Private Sector Development. \nManila). \n\n\f5 \n\n$1.5  billion  for  Sri  Lanka  that  aims  to  restore  macroeconomic  stability. 6  The  World  Bank \napproved  a  $100  million  development  policy  loan  in  July  2016,  with  the  Japan  International \nCooperation  Agency  providing  another  $100  million  of  parallel  financing. 7 The  World  Bank\u2019s \npolicy  effort focuses  on private  sector  competitiveness, governance,  and  macro fiscal  stability. \nIn December 2016, the World Bank is expected to approve a second policy loan for $75 million \nthat  will  operationalize  key  recommendations  formulated  under  an  IMF\u2013World  Bank  financial \nsector assessment program concluded in June 2016. Along with the World Bank and the IMF, \nthe  United  States  Treasury  and  International  Organization  of  Securities  Commissions  are \nproviding  important  advisory  support  that  will  complement  ADB\u2019s  program;  ADB  has  been \nclosely coordinating with these organizations. \n \n18. \nAlignment  with  ADB\u2019s  strategy  and  lessons  learned.  ADB\u2019s finance sector strategy \nfor Sri Lanka, which is part of its country partnership strategy and country operations business \nplan,  is  based  on  the  government\u2019s  emphasis  on  private  sector  development,  lessons  from \nADB\u2019s previous finance sector interventions, and coordination with other development partners.8 \nCapital  and  bond  market  development  is  in  line  with  the  priorities  of  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020 \nmidterm  review  and  its  financial  sector  operational  plan.  Both  aim  to  facilitate  private  sector \ndevelopment  and  infrastructure  development  by  helping  increase  the  availability  of  long-term \nlocal currency funds for viable financial structures.9 \n \nThe program will build on lessons from findings of a 2008 study by ADB\u2019s Independent \n19. \nEvaluation  Department.  10   In  line  with  the  evaluation  study  report\u2019s  key  recommendations,  its \nprospects  for  achieving  maximum  efficiency  and  effectiveness  have  been  improved  by  (i) \nlimiting the number of policy actions to allow for effective monitoring; (ii) formulating a long-term \ncapital market strategy as a first tranche policy action to ensure that the program is an integral \npart of a government-owned, long-term development strategy; (iii) adopting a holistic approach \nincluding the inclusion of insurance and pension areas; and (iv) consulting comprehensively with \nstakeholders  through  a  national  workshop  to  effectively  diagnose  the  issues  and  build  greater \nownership for the development of a strong, relevant proposed policy matrix.11  \n \nB. \n \nThe  impact  will  be  that  basic  capital  and  investment  needs,  as  well  as  Sri  Lanka\u2019s \n20. \nlonger-term  economic  objectives,  are  supported.  The  outcome  will  be  enhanced  size,  depth, \nand  capacity  of  the  capital  market.

Manila: ADB. \n\nregistered participants from 30 organizations. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nOutputs \n\nC. \n \n21.  Market  facilitation  enhanced.  Enhancing market facilitation  will support more efficient \nmobilization and allocation of resources in the economy. The program will help develop a long-\nterm  vision  for  the  capital  market  by  formulating  a  cabinet-approved  Capital  Market  Strategy \n(Appendix 5), institutionalizing interagency coordination, enhancing the SEC\u2019s role in developing \nand  monitoring  the  market,  strengthening  regulatory  measures,  developing  a  clearing  and \nsettlement  system,  pursuing  demutualization  of  the  CSE,  strengthening  enforcement  of  listing \nrequirements at the CSE, and enhancing financial literacy.12 \n \n22. \nA  Capital  Market  Advisory  Council  at  the  strategic  level  and  the  Capital  Market \nDevelopment Division at the SEC will ensure the successful implementation of the government\u2019s \nmultifaceted  Capital  Market  Strategy.  The  development  of  a  real-time  market  surveillance \nsystem  will  help  the  SEC  detect  trading  irregularities  and  market  abuse  as  they  occur.  This \nsystem  will  make  market  transactions  more  transparent  and  enhance  investor  confidence. \nImproving  the  operational  and  financial  efficiency  of  the  SLAASMB  will  strengthen  compliance \nwith auditing standards. This too will build market confidence by making reliable public company \ninformation available on which potential investors can base their investment decisions. \n \n23. \nIssuing risk-based capital rules for intermediaries and the subsequent implementation of \na recapitalization plan will consolidate the number of intermediaries in the industry and ensure \nthat  those  remaining  will  be  adequately  capitalized.  The  CSE\u2019s  demutualization  will  segregate \nits  ownership  and  management  and  convert  the  exchange  into  a  commercial  and  more \nprofessionally  run  organization  that  can  pursue  market  development  with  more  vigor. \nEstablishing a clearing and settlement system for SEC-listed securities will eventually enable a \ncentral  counterparty  entity  to  guarantee  the  settlement  of  these  securities.  The  SEC  will \nenhance  its  educational  and  qualification  framework.  This  will  include  changes  to  enable \nqualified  market  intermediaries  to  deal  with  a  variety  of  asset  classes,  as  well  as  to  enhance \nfinancial literacy and outreach to retail investors for mutual funds.  \n \n24. \nDemand  measures  enhanced. The policy actions linked to this output will support the \nmobilization  of  capital  market  financing  by  developing  liquid  bond  markets,  expanding \ninstitutional investor demand, and promoting mutual funds. To develop a liquid bond market and \na  reliable  yield  curve,  the  government  will  become  a  price  taker  by  issuing  treasury  bills  and \nbonds  at  market  rates.  The  CBSL  will  publish  a  rolling  12-month  quarterly  Treasury  auction \ncalendar and will execute a strategy to create liquid benchmark issues by reducing the number \nof issues as well as increasing the average size of issues. Creation of liquid benchmark issues \nwill  facilitate  secondary  bond  market  activity.  To  support  a  resilient  primary  government \nsecurities  market,  the  CBSL  will  ensure  compliance  with  capital  adequacy  requirements  for \nprimary  dealers.  A  committee  chaired  by  the  MOF  and  comprising  representatives  from  the \nMOF and the CBSL will be established to oversee government securities issuance procedures.  \n \n25. \nA  robust  mutual  fund  industry  will  be  promoted  under  the  program  by  adoption  of  a \nlegislative  amendment  to  remove  tax  distortions.  The  amendment  will  allow  unit  trusts  to \nbecome tax neutral. The EPF\u2019s capital market participation will be spurred by implementation of \nits  new  information  and  communication  technology  system.  Insurance  industry  participation  in \nthe  capital  market  will  be  enhanced  through  measures  to  promote  the  industry\u2019s  growth  and \nstability. These will include enforcement of compliance with the minimum capital requirements, \n\n                                                \n12 Sri Lanka Capital Market Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f7 \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\nestablishment  of  a  dispute  resolution  panel  to  hear  policyholders\u2019  grievances,  the  legal \nsegregation of the life and nonlife operations of Sri Lanka\u2019s largest insurance company, and the \nformulation  and  implementation  of  a  comprehensive  strategy  for  retail  education.  These  steps \nwill in turn enhance investor demand.  \n \n26. \nSupply measures enhanced. The changes tied to this output will increase the supply of \nquality  bonds  and  alternative  financial  instruments.  Partial  listing  of  SOEs  on  the  CSE  will \nbroaden  and  deepen  the  capital  market. The  corporate  bond market  will  be  catalyzed  through \nthe  implementation  of  quotes  for  corporate  securities  citing  yield  to  maturity,  which  is  a  more \nuseful  indicator  to  investors  than  bond  prices.  Alternative  financial  instruments  such  as \nderivatives will be promoted to develop a deeper and broader capital market by focusing on the \nenabling  regulatory  framework.  The  introduction  of  regulations  for  issuing  derivatives  and  the \nenactment of a securitization act will together encourage the development of such instruments \nas interest rate swaps, currency swaps, and asset-backed securities. \n \nD. \n \n27. \nThe  program  loan  will  be  $250  million,  which  will  be  made  available  in  two  equal \ntranches.  Tranche  2  will  be  released  about  18  months  after  disbursement  of  tranche  1.  The \ntranche amounts reflect the materiality of policy actions required for release of each tranche with \ntranche 1 having fewer but more pivotal policy actions such as the submission of an SEC and a \ndemutualization bill to parliament. The first tranche will be available upon loan effectiveness. \n \n28. \nADB\u2019s  financial  support  addresses  the  development  financing  needs.  In  particular,  the \ncounterpart fund generated  out  of the  loan  proceeds  will  finance  development  expenditures  in \nthe  form  of  the  costs  of  the  adjustments  involved  in  undertaking  the  reforms  agreed  for \nimplementation  under  the  program  and  necessary  to  achieve  the  intended  outputs.  The \nestimated cost of these adjustments is $260 million, and the government has requested a loan \nof $250 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance these costs.13 The loan will \nhave a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, an annual interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan and program agreements. Based on this, the average loan maturity is 9.25 years, and no \nmaturity premium is payable to ADB.  \n \nE. \n \n29. \nThe executing agency will be the MOF. The implementing agencies will be the SEC, the \nMOF,  the  CBSL,  the  IBSL,  the  SLAASMB,  the  EPF,  the  Ministry  of  Public  Enterprise \nDevelopment,  and the Ministry  of  Labor. The  SEC\u2019s  Capital  Market  Development  Division  has \nbeen tasked as the program management unit. A Capital Markets Advisory Council chaired by \nthe  senior  advisor  to  the  prime  minister  and  established  as  a  first  tranche  policy  action  will \nmonitor  the  program. The  deputy  secretary  to the  Treasury  will  be  the  executing  director. The \nprogram will be implemented over 3 years from January 2016 to December 2018. \n \nTranches,  disbursement,  and  counterpart  funds.  The  loan  will  be  provided  in  two \n30. \ntranches and disbursed upon fulfillment of the related program policy actions (Appendix 4). The \nproceeds of the loan will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n                                                \n13 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n(2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  with  the \ngovernment. 14  The  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  foreign  exchange  cost  of  items, \nexcluding items included in a list of ineligible items and imports financed by other bilateral and \nmultilateral sources.15 ADB will have the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify \nthe accuracy of the government\u2019s certification. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \nThe  attached  TA  for  Developing  the  Capital  Market  will  support  the  implementation  of \n31. \nkey reforms under the program.16 The outputs to be supported through the TA activities will be \nthe  (i)  facilitation  of  the  demutualization  of  the  CSE;  (ii)  development  of  a  multilayered, \nmultiproduct  financial  certification  framework  for  brokers;  (iii)  enhancement  of  financial  literacy \nand  outreach  for  unit  trusts;  (iv)  support  of  a  legal  review  of  the  unit  trust  code  and  related \nlegislation; (v) support of a legal review and the drafting of a securitization act; (vi) support of the \nestablishment  of  a  derivatives  market;  (vii)  formulation  of  a  strategy  for  the  development  of  a \ncommodities  exchange;  (viii)  assessment  of  the  options  for  reforming  the  current  system  for \nretirement  savings;  (ix)  enhancement  of  the  EPF\u2019s  capacity  for  managing  risk  in  alternative \ninvestments and foreign equities; (x) support of the establishment of a dispute resolution panel \nfor insurance cases; and (xi) deepening of financial literacy regarding insurance products. \n      \nThe TA is estimated to cost $2,000,000, of which $750,000 will be financed on a grant \n32. \nbasis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-V),  $750,000  will  be  financed  on  a \ngrant  basis  by  the  Financial  Sector  Development  Partnership  Special  Fund  (footnote  1),  and \n$500,000  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  and \nadministered by ADB. The executing agency for the TA will be the MOF. The SEC, the Ministry \nof Labor, the CBSL, the IBSL, and the EPF will be the implementing agencies. The TA will be \nimplemented over 2.5 years starting in December 2016. ADB will engage consultants through a \nconsulting firm in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom  time  to  time).  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nTechnical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The \ngovernment  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office,  office \nsupplies, secretarial assistance, and other in-kind contributions. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nA. \n \n33. \nThe  program  will  facilitate  the  mobilization  of  financial  resources  for  productive \ninvestment and employment generation by supporting the development of the capital market. By \nstrengthening  the  capital  market,  it  will  reduce  systemic  vulnerabilities  in  the  bank-dominated \nfinancial system. By promoting the development of the corporate securities market, mutual funds, \nand  institutional  investors  such  as  insurance  companies  and  the  public  pension  funds,  the \nprogram will diversify the financial instruments available and broaden the investor base. This will \nreduce  market  volatility  and  improve  the  resilience  of  the  finance  sector  to  external  shocks.  In \naddition, by strengthening governance of the capital markets, the program will enhance market \nefficiency and transparency and improve investor protection. \n\n                                                \n14  ADB. 1998.

The  MOF  has  been \nmodernizing  its  management  and  operations,  including  its  administration  of the  national  budget. \nThe  program  will  advance  these  efforts  by  publishing  rules  for  primary  auctions,  developing  an \nauction  calendar  for  government  securities,  and  establishing  a  committee  for  the  strategic \nmanagement of public debt under MOF. The government has national guidelines on selection and \nemployment  of  consultants  that  were  issued  in  2007.  In  the  absence  of  a  codified  public \nprocurement  statute, these  guidelines  have  the  force  of  law.  The  guidelines  are  comprehensive \nand  broadly  aligned  with  those  of  multilateral  agencies.  Sri  Lanka  signed  the  United  Nations \nConvention  against  Corruption  and  is  part  of  the  ADB\u2013Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation \nand  Development  anticorruption  initiative.  Its  legal  framework  for  bribery  and  corruption  is  fairly \ncomprehensive, but there are implementation gaps, and the country ranks 83rd in the perception \nof  corruption.  In  2009,  the  Institute  of  Chartered Accountants  of  Sri  Lanka  issued  the  Sri  Lanka \nPublic  Sector  Accounting  Standards.  These  were  based  on  the  standards  of  the  International \nFederation  of  Accountants  and  introduced  accrual  accounting.  The  program  will  strengthen  Sri \nLanka\u2019s  policy  and  legal  framework  by  helping  to  prepare  and  submit  a  proposed  SEC  bill  to \nParliament.  It  will  strengthen  regulatory  capacity  through  the  attached  TA.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption \nPolicy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  and \nimplementing  agencies.  Implementation  of  the  program  will  adhere  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nImplementing the Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan.17 \n \nC. \n \nFinancial  crises  disproportionately  harm  those  in  society  with  the  fewest  resources  to \n35. \nmitigate their impact. Capital market reforms under the program will help provide investors with \nadditional  investment  opportunities  and  mitigate  the  risk  of  financial  market  instability. \nDiversification  away  from  a  predominantly  bank-based  system  of  financial  intermediation  will \nexpand alternative sources of credit, helping to limit the systemic impacts of economic shocks. \nCapital markets can stimulate healthy competition with the banking sector that results in lower \nborrowing  costs.  The  capital  market  reforms  to  be  pursued  through  the  program  will  help  Sri \nLanka  diversify  its  financial  system  so  that  the  country  can  realize  its  broad-based  economic \ngrowth and socioeconomic development objectives, including poverty reduction. \n \nD. \n \nADB\u2019s evaluation of the program-supported capital market reforms showed that they will \n36. \nhave  no  direct  or  indirect  environmental  impacts,  will  not  cause  involuntary  resettlement,  and \nwill  have  no  impacts  on  indigenous  peoples.  The  program  is  classified  as  category  C  for \nenvironment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \n \nE. \n \n37. \nThe  program\u2019s  overall  risk  rating  is  medium.  This  is  because  (i)  ADB  has  solid \nexperience  in  the  sector  in  Sri  Lanka; (ii) the  MOF,  which  will  be  the  executing  agency,  has  a \ngood performance record in project implementation; and (iii) the program is unlikely to have any \nimpact  on  safeguards.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  the  following \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n17 ADB. 2014.

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will \ncoordinate closely with the World Bank, whose financing, and with \nthe United States Treasury, whose advisor, are expected to support \nsome of the policy actions in the second tranche. \nPublic financial management reform will continue under the support \nprograms of several development partners, and ADB will work \nclosely with the government to ensure that this program loan\u2019s policy \nactions have adequate funding. \nThe SEC bill and demutualization bill, whose submissions to \nparliament are first tranche policy actions, have undergone \nstakeholder consultation to ease their eventual passage. Similar \nconsultation is envisioned for legislation under the second tranche. \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \n38. \nall  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender,  procurement,  consulting services,  and  disbursement as  described  in  detail  in  the  loan \nagreement.  No  disbursement  shall  be  made  for  a  tranche  unless  ADB  is  satisfied  that  the \ngovernment has completed the relevant policy actions specified in the program\u2019s policy matrix. \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  policy-based  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \n39. \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nloan  of  $250,000,000 to  the  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka for  the  Capital  Market \nDevelopment Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term \nof  15  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  program  agreements \npresented to the Board. \n\n30 September 2016\n                                                \n18 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n\fResults Chain \nOutcome \nSize, depth, and \ncapacity of the \ncapital market \nenhanced \n\nOutputs \n1.
