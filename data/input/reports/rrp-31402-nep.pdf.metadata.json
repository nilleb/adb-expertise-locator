The  Project  will  provide  water  supply,  limited\ndrainage,  and  sanitation  facilities  in  selected  small  towns\nfollowing a demand-driven, interactive procedure that ensures\nfull participation of the local water users and non-government\norganizations in the formulation, implementation, and operation\nand maintenance of the subprojects.\nClassification Primary :  Human development\nSecondary :  Poverty reduction\nEnvironmental Assessment Category  B\nAn initial environmental examination was undertaken, and its\nsummary is a core appendix.\nRationale The population in the urban centers along the major national\nhighways  has  been  increasing  rapidly  in  the  past  decade\nmainly as a result of rural migration. The inadequate water\nsupply and sanitation systems in these emerging small towns\nhave adversely affected the quality of life and health conditions\nof the people living in them, with women spending more than\ntwo hours a day fetching water during the dry season.\nThe small towns serve as the economic links between the\nrural areas and the country's urban economy. They are the\nimmediate  markets,  transportation  depots,  and  processing\ncenters  of  agricultural  products  in  the  districts.  Their\ndevelopment will help absorb the rural migrants and reduce\npressures  on  the  urban  environment,  infrastructure,  and\nemployment in the urban centers of the Kathmandu valley.\nImproving water supply and sanitation in the small towns will\ncontribute to poverty reduction in the urban areas.\nObjectives and Scope The  Project  will  improve  water  supply  and  sanitation\nconditions in 40-50 new small towns with average populations\nof  about  12,000  each.  About  0.6  million  people,  of  whom\nmore than 34 percent live below the official poverty line, will\nbenefit from the Project. The objectives are to (i) improve the\nhealth and quality of life of the people living in the project\ntowns by constructing water supply, drainage and sanitation\nfacilities,  and  providing  health  and  hygiene  education;  (ii)\nsupport  community  participation  by  developing  the\ninstitutional  capacity  of  community-based  water  users  and\nsanitation  committees  (WUSCs),  and  by  requiring  the\nbeneficiaries to make contributions in cash or kind to cover\npartial project costs; and (iii) promote community-based water\nquality monitoring. The Project comprises four components:", "iii\nPublic  Awareness  Campaign  and  Health  and  Hygiene\nEducation  (Part  A).  In  all  project  towns,  nongovernment\norganizations  (NGOs)  will  be  engaged  to  carry  out  the\nprograms with focus on (i) community hygiene awareness, (ii)\nparticipation and project ownership, and (iii) construction of in-\npremise sanitation facilities.\nWater  Supply  and  Sanitation  Facilities  (Part  B).

THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed loan\nto the Kingdom of Nepal for the Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2. Small urban centers are emerging along the major national highways of Nepal where the\npopulation has been rapidly increasing over the last decade. In recognition of the adverse impact\nof inadequate safe drinking water supply and poor sanitation conditions on human development\nin such centers, the Government initiated a Fifteen-Year Plan for Small Towns Water Supply and\nSanitation Development (15-Year Plan)1 and asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for\nassistance in preparing a sector investment project in support of that Plan. In August 1998, ADB\napproved technical assistance (TA)2 for the preparation of the small towns water supply and\nsanitation sector project. A Loan Fact-Finding Mission visited Nepal during 21 February-7 March\n2000,  reviewed  the  project  feasibility  study  prepared  by  the  TA  consultant,  and  reached  a\npreliminary understanding with the Government on the scope, cost estimates, financing, and\nimplementation arrangements of the proposed project. Subsequently, the Project was appraised\nduring 8-19 May 2000.3 This report is based on the findings of the Missions; reports prepared by\nthe  TA  consultants  and  other  aid  agencies,  and  discussions  with  Government  agencies,\nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  international  and  bilateral  aid  agencies,  private\ncontractors, and potential project beneficiaries. The project framework is presented in Appendix\n1.\nIII.  BACKGROUND\nA.  Sector Description\n1. General\n3. Nepal is divided into three ecologically distinct regions: mountains, hills, and the Terai.4\nThe regions are diverse in climate and topography as well as in socioeconomic conditions and\ncultural practices. Over the past five decades, Nepal has gradually been urbanizing due to the\nexpansion  of  the  nation\u2019s  road  network,  rural-urban  migration,  and  the  natural  process  of\npopulation growth and development. In less than 44 years, the total population increased from 8\nmillion to nearly 22 million, whereas the urban population increased tenfold \u2013 from 238,000 to\nnearly 2.3 million. Although the urban population remains relatively small compared with the rural\npopulation, urban growth rates, which increased the urban population five times over the last\nthree decades, are significant. Urbanization has not occurred evenly over the country. Statistics\nshow that most urbanization has occurred in the Terai and in small towns along the major\nnational  highways  as  a  result  of  the  rural-urban  migration,  particularly  from  the  hills  to  the\nsouthern plains of the Terai. Most of the newly formed small towns are either on the east-west\n(Mahendra) highway or along the north-south feeder roads leading to the east-west highway.\n                                                \n1  The Plan, approved by the Government on 29 February 2000, covers three periods: 2000-2004, 2005-2009, and\n2010-2014.\n2  TA 3059-NEP: Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Project, for $600,000, approved on 20 August 1998.\n3  The Appraisal Mission comprised X. Ye, Sr. Financial Analyst/Mission Leader; R. O\u2019Sullivan, Counsel; B. Shah,\nWater Engineer/Staff Consultant; T. Villareal, Economist/Staff Consultant; C. Gamiao, Sociologist/Staff Consultant.\nG. Cezayirli, Urban Development Specialist, assisted the Mission in the Head Office.\n4  Terai is the southern plain area bordering India.", "2\nThese small towns were rural villages until recently and lack basic infrastructure to accommodate\nthe rapid population growth.\n4. Nepal has abundant water resources \u2014less than 0.4 percent of the world's population\npossessing about 2.3 percent of the world's water resources. However, drinking water supplies in\nmost towns are generally inadequate in overall coverage, quantity, and quality. A comprehensive\nsurvey in 19965 shows that, on average, only 35 percent of the people living in urban centers\nother than Kathmandu have access to piped water supply. The piped water supplies in the towns\nare usually intermittent, with many towns having water only a few hours a day. People without\naccess to these piped systems use traditional water sources such as springs, ponds, streams,\nand open dug wells. These sources are typically unprotected, and water quality is usually poor.\nPeople spend considerable time and labor collecting water from distant sources (that may or may\nnot be adequate in quantity and quality). Few water supply schemes in the towns have water\ntreatment facilities, although basic sedimentation and chlorination are sometimes used. While\ngroundwater usually requires little treatment, removal of excess iron and calcium carbonate is\nnecessary in some areas of the Terai.\n5. The socioeconomic survey in eight sample towns, conducted during the TA study for\npreparing the Project, indicates that of those households that have water connections, only 15\npercent have regular supplies and the rest have only a few hours of supply per day. In fact,\nunreliable  supply  is  cited  by  most  households  as  the  main  reason  not  to  have  a  house\nconnection. For households without house connections, carrying water from other sources is a\ndaily chore. Consequently these households have very low water consumption of less than 70\nliters per household per day, roughly 12.5 liters per capita per day (lpcd). Household members\nspend a significant amount of time fetching water: from 0.9 hour (Parsa) to as much as 7.0 hours\nper day (Fikkal), or an average of 2.3 hours per day.\n6. For sanitation, the same national survey indicates that about two thirds of the households\nin the urban centers have latrines and about 52 percent have access to sanitation systems (open\nor covered drains and soak pits for discharging liquid waste). Using storm water drains as\nsanitary sewers is a widespread practice in Nepal, and is a principal cause of pollution in the\ncountry\u2019s  watercourses.  Basic  solid  waste  management  systems  in  urban  areas  have  been\nfunctioning for some time and cover about 20 percent of the urban population. However, modern\nand systematic solid waste management practices (e.g., a comprehensive system of sanitary\nlandfills, regularly attended waste transfer stations, and basic reuse/recycling capabilities) have\nyet to be firmly established even in the largest metropolitan areas in Nepal. A Government report6\nindicates that sanitation-related diseases account for 72 percent of the total ailments, and that\ndiarrhea continues to be one of the leading causes of childhood deaths (16-25 percent). The\nsocioeconomic survey conducted in the eight sample towns also confirms that diarrhea and\ndysentery are the most common diseases. Other common illnesses are skin itching, cough, and\nmalnutrition. Most of the water samples from hand pumps and dug wells in the sample towns\nwere found to be contaminated.\n7. The level of sanitation among the eight sample towns varies. On-site sanitation coverage\nranges from 33 percent in Attariya to 92 percent in Fikkal (Table 1). However, in almost all the\ntowns  except  Bandipur  and  Fikkal,  the  level  of  sanitation  is  very  poor  among  the  Tharu7\ncommunities. There is no surface drainage system in Attariya, Bandipur, and Lekhnath and\nsurface runoffs in these towns either infiltrate the ground or flow into natural drains through\n                                                \n5  Central Bureau of Statistics. 1996.

Lack of safe drinking supply and sanitation facilities results in worsening public health\nconditions, deteriorating quality of life, and increased economic costs to the society, such as the\ntime spent on fetching water from distant sources, lost labor productivity due to waterborne\ndiseases,  and  associated  medical  expenditure.  A  study  shows  that  water-related  diseases\naccount for 44 percent of the infant mortality rate, or 45,000 deaths per year. The total health cost\nof morbidity and mortality arising from water-related diseases was estimated at nearly 2 percent\nof the gross domestic product (GDP) and significantly exceeded the Government expenditure on\nwater supply and sanitation facilities. Such cost would be higher if the cost of time spent on\ncollecting water is included.8\n9. Lack of safe and convenient water supply and sanitation facilities, apart from resulting in\nhigh economic costs, also affects such social development objectives as poverty reduction,\nimproving the status of women, and increasing school enrollment of female students. While lack\nof water supply and sanitation affects people of all income levels, it is the poor that are most\nvulnerable. They have little resources and few alternatives to protect themselves from such\nadverse impacts as seasonal drying out of surface water sources, pollution of groundwater, or\nspread of waterborne diseases. Women have traditionally been responsible for most household\nchores and child care. Safe and convenient water supply and sanitation facilities will lessen\nwomen's burden from these household duties and allow them to engage in revenue-generating\nactivities, which in turn will increase their voice in the family as well as in the community. Lack of\nsanitation facilities is reportedly one of the major factors that affect female students\u2019 school\nattendance. A school latrine provided under a project supported by United Nations Children's\nFund  (UNICEF)  in  Chalalganesthan  village  development  committee  (VDC)  has  reportedly\nincreased female students enrollment by 150 percent (footnote 6).\n                                                \n8  Tiwari, D.N. 1998.

Urban Categorization and Definition of Small Towns\n10. The Local Development Act (1991) and other related regulations have classified urban\nsettlements into four administrative categories on the basis of existing infrastructure, population,\nand potential to generate resources. At the lowest level, is the VDC with a population of less than\n20,000. A municipality is the next higher level with a population between 20,000 and 100,000 and\na minimum of NRs2 million in annual revenues. Larger urban centers with populations from\n100,000  to  300,000  and  annual  revenues  of  at  least  NRs50  million  are  classified  as  sub-\nmetropolitan cities. A metropolitan city is at the top of the hierarchy with a minimum population of\n300,000 and NRs100 million in annual revenues. 9\n11. The steady development of the national road network has had a clear impact on the\ncommercial  growth  of  several  areas,  especially  in  the  Terai.  In  addition,  such  support\ninfrastructure as health and education services, banking, and administrative services has further\nfueled rapid growth in certain areas, giving rise to new commercial centers with dramatically\nexpanded wholesale and retail businesses. For a newly formed small town, classified as either a\nmunicipality or a VDC, such livability indicators are important: availability of water, fuel, and\nbuilding materials; agriculture fields and grazing lands; susceptibility to flooding; and conditions of\nclimate, topography, and public health. Economic and administrative factors such as the potential\nof developing into a tourist area, an educational center, or an administrative center are also\nimportant. Taking into account these considerations, the small towns are defined by the following\ncharacteristics:\n(i)  Population and growth. The population of the estimated service area will be from\n3,000 in the hills and 5,000 in the Terai to 40,000.\n(ii)  Population density. The population density should be at least 40 persons per\nhectare  in  areas  that  need  to  be  provided  with  water  supply  and  sanitation\nservices.\n(iii)  Road access. The town is located close to an all-weather road along the east-west\nhighway or the main north-south feeder roads.\n(iv)  Basic  infrastructure.  The  town  should  have  access  to  grid  electricity,  basic\ntelecommunications, banking, a lower secondary school, and a health post.\n(v)  Conditions of water supply and sanitation services. The town must meet at least\ntwo of the following indicators of hardship regarding water supply and sanitation\nfacilities:\n(a)  marginal or unacceptably low water quality below the basic WHO10 water\nquality standards, or national standards when in effect, in two or more\nimportant categories;\n(b)  water quantity available from the current system is less than 30 lpcd;\n(c)  availability of water from taps is less than 2 hours per day;\n(d)  50 percent of the water users have to spend more than 30 minutes per day\nto collect water; and\n(e)  50 percent of the service area population have no private latrines.\n                                                \n9  There are currently one metropolitan city, four sub-metropolitan cities, and 53 other municipalities in the country.\n10World Health Organization.", "5\n12.

The Ministry of Physical Planning and Works (MPPW) is the ministerial-level institution\nwith overall responsibility for water supply and sanitation in the country. It reviews and approves\nsector plans, policies, and the development budget. It supervises several sector institutions,\nincluding  the  Department  of  Water  Supply  and  Sewerage  (DWSS),  Nepal  Water  Supply\nCorporation (NWSC), Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Development Fund Board, and Town\nDevelopment Fund (TDF). NWSC is a semiautonomous corporation responsible for water supply\nin  major  urban  centers  with  current  operations  in  22  major  towns.  The  Fund  Board  is  an\nautonomous  institution  funded  by  the  World  Bank  to  support  small  rural  water  supply  and\nsanitation projects. MPPW also oversees the Melamchi Water Supply Development Board, which\nis responsible for the Melamchi water supply project to bring water from the Melamchi River to the\nKathmandu valley.\n14. DWSS is the lead sector agency responsible for, among others, formulating policies,\nsector planning, and providing training and technical support to the local authorities for water\nsupply and sanitation. DWSS has regional directorates in the five development regions and a\ndistrict office in each of the 75 districts. The total approved staff of DWSS is about 2,400 with 96\nassigned at headquarters. The regional directorates coordinate activities between the central and\ndistrict levels, providing technical support as necessary and monitoring district-level activities. The\ndistrict offices, headed by the district engineers, have assistant engineers, overseers, water\nsupply  and  sanitation  technicians,  women's  workers11,  and  administrative  support  staff.  The\ndistrict  offices  (i)  coordinate  centrally  funded  program  activities  with  district  development\ncommittees (DDCs), municipalities, and VDCs; (ii) design new water supply systems; (iii) manage\nthe construction process, including training for Water Users and Sanitation Committees (WUSCs)\nand coordinating sanitation programs; (iv) operate and maintain water supply systems that have\nnot  yet  been  transferred  to  WUSCs;  and  (v)  provide  technical  and  financial  support  to\ncommunities to overcome major water supply system problems.\n15. TDF, established in 1989,12 is currently governed under the Town Development Fund Act\n2053 (1997). The legislation establishes the TDF as a Government-owned autonomous body to\nprovide financial, technical, and institutional support and research to organizations involved in the\n                                                \n11Staff responsible for addressing women's concerns in designing and operating a water supply system.\n12 Town Development Fund Board (formation) Order, 2045 (1989).", "6\nconstruction and development of municipalities and urban centers.

TDF  may  provide  grants  and  loans  to  any  institution  involved  in  town\ndevelopment, including government and non-government institutions, user groups, VDCs, and\nmunicipalities. TDF currently has 38 staff organized in four divisions (Appendix 2).\n16. Various  local  government  agencies,  or  local  bodies,  including  DDCs,  VDCs,  and\nmunicipalities, have a key role in coordinating and approving the projects and programs planned\nand implemented through central Government line agencies. DDC, an elected governing body in\na district, is responsible for coordinating, managing, and administering government activities\nwithin the district, including planning and implementing development activities within the local\ndevelopment budget. The line agencies are mandated to coordinate the implementation of the\ncentrally funded development projects with the DDCs. The VDC, a village-level elected body, is\nresponsible for village-level administration, planning, and managing local development projects\nfinanced  through  the  grant  program  for  local  governments.  It  also  coordinates  all  other\ndevelopment activities within the village. A municipality is governed by an elected town assembly\nand a mayor who oversees municipal functions. An executive officer from MLD manages the\nmunicipal staff and day-to-day functioning of the municipality. Municipalities have significant\nsources of revenues from a variety of taxes, user fees, and municipally owned enterprises. This\nallows them to borrow funds for infrastructure development from banks or TDF.\n17. Nepal has over 6,000 registered13 local NGOs, and well over a hundred national and\ninternational NGOs. Most of them focus on integrated community development in rural areas. The\neighth and ninth national development plans specifically identified NGOs as important partners in\ndevelopment, and encouraged NGO-Government partnerships to achieve plan objectives. About\n12 national NGOs and as many as a hundred local NGOs have participated in water supply and\nsanitation projects throughout the country. Almost all these activities have focused on small\ngravity  water  supply  schemes  in  the  hills,  or  hand-pump/borehole  programs  in  the  Terai.\nCurrently, a wide range of national and local NGOs are working to improve water supply and\nsanitation services in rural areas. National NGOs such as Nepal Water for Health and the Nepal\nRed Cross Society have substantial experience in the sector.\nB.  Government Policies and Plans\n18. Government policies for the development of the water supply and sanitation sector are\nenshrined  in  a  series  of  legislative  and  administrative  documents.  The  Eighth  National\nDevelopment Plan (1992-1997) first laid down the principles of participatory development and\nprovided the guidelines for water supply and sanitation development programs: (i) demand-\ndriven and based on local felt need, hardship, and willingness to contribute to capital costs; (ii)\ncommunity ownership and management of water supplies and sanitation facilities; (iii) sustainable\nand affordable; (iv) strengthening the user community through organizational support, training,\nand technical and financial assistance; (v) users accountability through their contribution to partly\ncover capital and all operation and maintenance (O&M) costs; and (vi) participation of women,\nlocal communities, NGOs, private sector, and the local governments in the development of\n                                                \n13 Registered with the Social Welfare Council under the Ministry of Social Welfare.", "7\ndrinking water facilities. The plan stressed the mandatory arrangements to involve the beneficiary\ncommunities in the decision-making process. It was estimated that, by the end of the plan period,\nwater supply coverage was 61 percent of the total population, lower than the targeted 72 percent,\nalthough sanitation coverage achieved 20 percent, exceeding the targeted 16 percent.\n19. Building on lessons learned from the eighth plan, the Ninth National Development Plan\n(1997-2002) calls for sustainable development, effective service delivery, and equitable access to\nwater supply and sanitation services. Specifically, the ninth plan advocates (i) mobilizing local\nresources for the supply of safe drinking water; (ii) protecting existing water sources; (iii) giving\npriority to the underprivileged, minority groups, and poorer communities, (iv) encouraging active\ninvolvement of user groups; (v) integrating sanitation programs and water supply activities as\nequal project components to improve environmental hygiene and public health; (vi) developing\nsimple,  low-cost  technologies  that  are  affordable  to  and  within  the  capabilities  of  users  to\nmanage,  operate,  and  replicate;  (vii)  redefining  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  existing\ninstitutions for effective and efficient service delivery, and facilitating decentralized operational\nmodalities; (viii) developing NGOs, community-based organizations, and the private sector as\npartner  organizations  for  overall  sector  development;  (ix)  making  user  groups  and  local\nauthorities fully responsible for the process of project formulation, implementation, and O&M; and\n(x) developing technical and institutional capabilities for reducing water leakage and water waste\nin urban areas.\n20. These policies have gradually gained support from both the central Government and local\nbodies  and  are  reflected  in  various  Government  and  externally  funded  water  supply  and\nsanitation projects in the country. Local contribution to project cost has been widely applied in the\ndevelopment of water supply and sanitation facilities. In line with the Government policy of local\nownership, DWSS in the past decade has transferred about 3,000 water supply schemes to local\nauthorities. DWSS plans to transfer the remaining 660 schemes to local authorities in the next 10\nyears. Development participation, especially ownership by the beneficiaries, requires extensive\ntraining and capacity-building efforts by the Government. As the Government lacks both the skills\nand financial resources to undertake such capacity building at the grassroots level, participation\nin many cases remains at the level of consultation with the beneficiaries. DWSS has also made\nefforts to involve NGOs in sector development activities, such as spring protection, shallow\ntubewell  and  dugwell  construction,  and  gravity  water  supply  schemes  with  less  than  500\nbeneficiaries. It was recently recognized, however, that NGOs services could be more effectively\nutilized in human and community development activities rather than in physical construction. The\ninvolvement of NGOs in water supply and sanitation was also constrained by the relatively low\nremuneration that the Government could pay compared with what external funding agencies\ncould offer. DWSS is currently revising the NGO policy so as to better coordinate with NGOs in\nsector development.\n21. In April 1998, the Government approved the National Water Supply and Sanitation Policy\nwith  the  main  objectives  of  extending  service  coverage,  maximizing  health  benefits,  and\naddressing gender concerns. While most of the policy statements are similar to those made in the\neighth and ninth plans, the newly established sector policy emphasizes that (i) Government\nagencies  should  act  as  facilitators  rather  than  implementers  of  water  supply  and  sanitation\nprojects, with such facilitation taking place at decentralized levels; (ii) the benefits of water supply\nand sanitation projects are to be measured in improved health and reduced burden for women\nand disadvantaged groups; (iii) to safeguard the public interest, the Government must retain\ncertain roles such as coordination of sector activities, regulation of water resource use, monitoring\nwater quality and certain aspects of utility operations; (iv) community-based and private sector\napproaches to provision of water supply and sanitation services are the most efficient and cost-", "8\neffective;  and  (v)  water  supply  and  sanitation  projects  are  sustainable  only  if  beneficiary\ncommunities meet O&M needs.\n22. The 15-Year Plan prepared by the Government recognizes the increasingly important\nroles the newly formed small towns play in bridging rural development and the urban economy, in\nabsorbing the rural migrants and reducing the pressure of urbanization in the Kathmandu valley,\nand in sustaining economic growth and addressing poverty. The plan assesses the demand for\nwater supply and sanitation in the small towns, estimates the investment requirements, and\noutlines a financing plan. The overall approach to meeting the demand of the small towns for\nwater supply and sanitation is in line with the policies stated in the national development plans\nand  the  National  Water  Supply  Sector  Policy.  The  15-Year  Plan  envisages  that  the  total\ninvestment requirements for the small towns\u2019 water supply and sanitation improvement will be\nabout $174 million for a service area population of about 2.1 million. The 15-Year Plan provides,\nfor the first time in the country, a planning framework and will guide future investments for the\ndevelopment of basic services in the small towns.\nC.  External Assistance\n23. Major external assistance in rural water supply and sanitation started in the 1970s and\naccelerated in the 1980s with the launching of the International Water Supply and Sanitation\nDecade (1980-1990). ADB, a lead external funding agency for rural water supply and sanitation\ndevelopment in the country, provided four project loans since 1984 amounting to $64 million and\ncovering about 3 million rural population in the Eastern, Midwestern, and Far Western regions.14\nOf the four projects, three have been successfully completed, and the fourth is progressing well.\nADB has also been instrumental in coordinating the external funding agencies for the planned\nMelamchi water supply project, and approved a loan of $5 million on 10 November 1998 for the\nengineering design of that project. ADB-funded TAs for the sector included a sector profile study\nand  five  project  feasibility  studies.15  Apart  from  ADB,  the  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund\n(UNICEF) and the governments of Finland, Switzerland, and United Kingdom have also provided\nassistance for rural water supply and sanitation. The World Bank has been active in assisting\nurban water supply and sanitation in the country with a series of International Development\nAgency (IDA) credits to NWSC since the late 1970s. More recently, the World Bank funded the\nRural  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Development  Fund  Board,  which  has  been  active  in\nimplementing community-based and demand-responsive rural water and sanitation schemes.\nExternal assistance in the past has focused on either the Kathmandu valley or the rural areas.\nThe new small towns have been neglected. Details of major external assistance to the sector are\nin Appendix 3.\nD.  Lessons Learned\n24. Over the years of ADB\u2019s assistance to the country and the sector, valuable lessons have\nbeen learned. ADB\u2019s first two rural water supply and sanitation projects in the 1980s were\n                                                \n14 These are Loan 719-NEP: Rural Water Supply Sector Project, for $9.6 million, approved on 11 December 1984;\nLoan 949-NEP: Second Water Supply Sector Project, for $14.4 million, approved on 31 January 1989; Loan 1165-\nNEP: Third Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project, for $20 million, approved on 25 June 1992; and Loan  1464-\nNEP: Fourth Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project, for $20 million, approved on 24 September 1996.\n15 TA 482-NEP: Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Profile, for $50,000, approved on 15 September 1982; TA 514-\nNEP: Rural Water Supply and Sanitation, for $150,000, approved on 12 May 1983; TA 876-NEP: Second Water\nSupply Sector Project, for $250,000 approved on 18 May 1987; TA 1510-NEP: Third Water Supply and Sanitation,\nfor $80,000, approved on 18 April 1991; TA 2340-NEP: Fourth Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project, for\n$171,000, approved on 1 June 1995; and TA 3059-NEP: Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Project, for\n$600,000, approved on 20 August 1998.", "9\nessentially supply-driven, with DWSS as both project implementer and operator of the completed\nwater schemes. There was no community participation and little cost recovery. The reliance on\nthe central Government budget for O&M of the rural water supply projects proved nonsustainable.\nThe major lessons from the first two projects are that project sustainability required a participatory\napproach and projects must be demand driven. The commitment of beneficiary communities, in\nterms of capital cost contribution and timely setting up of community-based WUSCs, is essential\nto successful implementation and sustainability of the projects. Such commitment, however, can\nbe obtained only by involving the communities in planning, design, and O&M of the projects,\nwhich in turn requires comprehensive education and interaction with the local communities.\n25. Applying lessons from earlier projects, the third and fourth ADB rural water supply and\nsanitation projects incorporated participation by communities, NGOs, and women in the project\ndesigns. The projects trained DWSS staff in the social aspects of water supply and sanitation\ndevelopment. Under these projects, DWSS started to change from project implementer and water\nsupply system operator to development facilitator. It also started to transfer the completed water\nschemes to the local communities for O&M. While these projects, designed in the first half of the\n1990s, substantially moved away from the supply-driven approach, the participatory approach\nwas essentially in its rudimentary form of consultation with the stakeholders. Later development\nexperience  of  ADB  and  other  aid  agencies  suggests  that  participation  must  go  beyond\nconsultation to focusing on empowerment of the communities in the development process. These\nlessons have been incorporated in the design of the proposed Project. Apart from full involvement\nof the communities in the process of the TA study, the Project will give the local communities the\ndecision power at each stage of subproject design, implementation, and O&M. The performance\nof  and  lessons  from  the  four  ADB-funded  rural  water  supply  and  sanitation  projects  are\nsummarized in Appendix 4.\n26. Countrywide lessons were reported in ADB\u2019s Nepal: 1999 Country Synthesis of Evaluation\nFindings. The key lessons, which were also considered in the design of the Project, are the\nfollowing:\n(i)  Participation of local communities during both design and implementation is crucial\nfor project sustainability and success.\n(ii)  Project  design  should  institute  appropriate  O&M  mechanisms  and  properly\ndelineate responsibilities.\n(iii)  Good governance and anticorruption measures contribute to a more favorable\nproject implementation environment.\n(iv)  Private sector participation should be encouraged especially in the marketing,\ndistribution, and maintenance of project outputs.\nE.  ADB's Sector Strategy\n27. The primary objective of ADB's operational strategy in Nepal is to achieve a sustainable\nreduction in poverty. ADB interventions aim to improve efficiency, predictability, transparency,\nand accountability in key institutions responsible for delivering services while reducing poverty\nthrough equitable access to basic social services to enhance human development. Consistent\nwith these objectives, ADB's sector strategy for water supply and sanitation in Nepal supports the\nGovernment\u2019s sector policies including (i) decentralization: devolving authority and responsibility\nfor developing, operating, and maintaining urban services to local authorities and community-\nbased organizations; (ii) participation: mobilizing, through appropriate policy reform, adequate\nbeneficiary as well as NGO participation in terms of local resources, initiatives, and skills; (iii)\nplanning: encouraging the Government to take a long-term strategic view on sector development", "10\nand broaden the stakeholder base; (iv) standards: promoting higher level of affordable public and\nprivate sanitation standards; and (v) targeting the poor: seeking innovative ways of benefiting the\npoorer groups in the urban centers while striving for economic, financial, environmental, and\ninstitutional viability of development projects. This strategy has evolved over ADB\u2019s operations in\nthe sector.\nF.  Policy Dialogue\n28. In  the  course  of  ADB  assistance  to  the  sector,  staff  have  actively  engaged  the\nGovernment in policy dialogue. The issues include (i) community participation and empowerment\nof WUSCs; (ii) funding for O&M of completed projects; (iii) involvement of NGOs in project\nimplementation; (iv) sensitizing DWSS staff on social issues, including active participation of\nwomen  in  WUSCs;  and  (v)  improvement  of  DWSS  technical  support  to  local  communities.\nAgreements  on  these  issues  were  reflected  in  the  third  and  fourth  ADB  water  supply  and\nsanitation projects. Ongoing dialogue with the Government is focusing on further strengthening\nthe participation and ownership of WUSCs in water supply development, following the efforts of\nthe Government and ADB since the Fourth Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project. To this\nend, the dialogue emphasizes the need to reduce Government subsidies to water supply projects\nand to increase the share of capital cost contribution by WUSCs. As a result of the dialogue, it\nhas been agreed that, in the proposed Project, the water users will eventually contribute 50\npercent of the construction cost of the water supply systems. In line with the increased water\nusers contributions, the dialogue also concentrated on increasing the decision power of the water\nusers in the formulation, design, implementation, and O&M of the water supply systems. This\nrequires that DWSS view itself as a facilitator and WUSCs as the initiator and owner of projects.\nThe dialogue has led to a demand-responsive and interactive development process under this\nProject  wherein  water  users  have  full  decision-making  power  at  every  stage  of  project\nformulation, implementation, and O&M. For the Government to take a long-term view over the\nsector issues and challenges, dialogue has also touched on the need to develop a long-term\nsector plan. The Government has responded positively and worked out the 15-Year Plan for small\ntowns water supply and sanitation to the satisfaction of ADB.\n29. Another  important  focus  of  the  ongoing  policy  dialogue  is  building  transparency  and\nobjectivity into the development process, so as to facilitate participation by local communities.\nReflecting the agreement reached by the Government and ADB, the project design intends to\nmaximize transparency, objectivity, and participation by spelling out and disseminating detailed\nproject information including the rights and responsibilities of key stakeholders in subproject\nidentification, design, implementation, O&M, financing, procurement, monitoring, reporting, and\nauditing. The measures include the following: (i) DWSS will set up a web site to disclose all\nproject-related information\u2013relevant Government policies and procurement guidelines; project\ntown application, evaluation, and selection procedures and criteria; project progress such as\nprocurement, contract awarding, and performance evaluation, etc.; (ii) at each key milestone of\nthe subproject cycle, the project management office (PMO) will seek endorsement from WUSCs\nbefore taking action; and (iii) WUSCs will inform their members of subproject-related information\nthrough public briefings or bulletin boards. Participatory monitoring is expected to be effective in\nreducing the chances of corruption and malpractice and therefore improve project management\nefficiency.", "11\nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA.  Rationale\n30. The Project is based on several fundamental considerations. The first relates to meeting\nbasic human needs and improving the quality of life of small-town residents, especially the low-\nincome groups. The population in the urban centers along the major national highways has been\nincreasing rapidly in the past decade mainly as a result of rural migration. The inadequate safe\nwater supply and sanitation systems in these small towns have adversely affected the quality of\nlife and public health conditions of the people living in them. The hardship experienced by the\npeople, especially women, in accessing basic services severely constrains their ability to improve\ntheir living conditions.The socioeconomic survey conducted under the project preparatory TA\nstudy indicates that in 84 percent of the households, women are responsible for fetching water,\nspending an average of 2.3 hours per day on this task during the dry season. Lack of a safe\ndrinking water supply and in-premise sanitation facilities, combined with nonhygienic behavior,\nresults in poor health profiles and significant economic costs. The low-income groups in the small\ntowns are particularly vulnerable to the poor conditions of the basic services because of their lack\nof resources and alternatives to protect themselves against adverse impacts such as drying out of\nsurface  water  sources,  pollution  of  groundwater,  and  spread  of  waterborne  diseases.  The\nproposed Project will provide safe and convenient water supply to the households and thereby\nallow the people, especially women, to engage in productive activities to improve their living\nconditions.\n31. The second major consideration is the growing role of the small towns in serving as the\neconomic links between the rural areas and the country's urban economy. The small towns are\nthe immediate markets, transportation depots, and processing centers of agricultural products\nfrom the rural areas. They are also the immediate labor markets for the seasonal workers from\nthe rural areas during the slack seasons. Improved basic services will therefore not only help\nsustain commercial activities that will provide employment to and increase people's income in the\nsmall towns, but also enable farmers to realize gains from income-generating activities. Improved\nliving conditions in the small towns are expected to help absorb the rural migrants and reduce\npressures on the urban environment, infrastructure, and employment in Kathmandu valley. The\nmajority of the people living in the small towns are migrants from the hills and mountains, drawn\nby the opportunities for business, employment, or education in the urban centers where they\ncould better utilize their labor and talent. This voluntary resettlement represents an alternative\nway for rural people to reduce poverty.\n32. An additional consideration was to initiate a process of empowering local communities\nand giving them an effective voice in deciding on their development needs. Ensuring that WUSCs\nare equal partners in the development process together with Government agencies, NGOs, and\nthe  private  sector  will  enable  sustainability  and  will  encourage  good  governance  and\naccountability.\n33. The Project will follow a sector lending modality. This is considered appropriate because\n(i) the Government has prepared a 15-year plan for the sector that is satisfactory to ADB, and (ii)\nDWSS has gained substantial experience through the past four ADB-assisted rural water supply\nand  sanitation  sector  projects  in  managing  this  type  of  lending.  The  Project  will  assist  the\nGovernment in covering the investment requirements of the initial years of the 15-Year Plan.", "12\nB.  Objectives and Scope\n34. The Project will improve water supply and sanitation conditions in 40-50 small towns\n(average population about 12,000 per town) where inadequate water supply and sanitation have\nadversely affected the health profile and quality of life of the residents. About 0.6 million people,\nof whom more than 34 percent live below the official poverty line, will benefit from the Project.\nThe objectives are to (i) improve water supply and sanitation facilities and provide an HHE\nprogram in each town, (ii) support community participation in the development of water supply\nand sanitation facilities, and (iii) promote community-based water quality monitoring. The Project\nhas four components:\n1.  Public Awareness Campaign and Health and Hygiene Education (Part A)\n35. Public awareness campaigns (PAC) will be carried out through NGOs in all project towns\nas soon as a town's participation in the Project is confirmed. The PAC will focus on community\nawareness of the project concept including (i) the roles and responsibilities of the WUSCs, local\ngovernments, TDF, and DWSS; (ii) the need to share the capital cost of the water supply\nsystems; (iii) the linkage between the desired level of services, the cost contribution and O&M\nexpenditure, and water tariffs; (iv) the availability of TDF loans and the need to pay back the\nborrowed  funds;  (v)  women's  representation  in  the  decision-making  process;  and  (vi)  land\nacquisition and resettlement issues. The PAC will lead to the signing of the community action\nplan (CAP) by WUSC representatives signifying their understanding of and agreement in principle\nwith  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  Project.  The  project  feasibility  study  for  the  town  will\ncommence once the CAP is signed.\n36. Health and hygiene education (HHE) will commence in a project town when the detailed\ndesign  for  the  subproject  is  completed  and  accepted  by  the  WUSC,  and  the  town  project\nagreement is signed by the WUSC and PMO. The NGO selected to undertake HHE in a project\ntown will coordinate with other institutions and civil groups \u2013 the district health office, district\neducation office, UNICEF, WUSCs, local sanitation clubs, and women's groups \u2013 in developing\nan appropriate training program. HHE will cover (i) school hygiene education; (ii) community\neducation;  and  (iii)  focused  training  including  latrine  construction,  solid  waste  management,\nanimal  waste  management,  and  training  of  community  health  workers.  HHE  is  expected  to\ngenerate  increased  demand  for  improved  household  sanitation  and  the  Project  will  provide\nsupport (up to 50 percent of construction cost) to low-income households interested in building\nprivate latrines for purchasing materials unavailable locally. The private in-premise facilities are of\ntwo  basic  types:  pour-flush  latrines  and  ventilated  improved  pit  latrines,  depending  on  the\nwillingness to pay and preference of the households. Details of HHE are in Appendix 5.\n2.  Water Supply and Sanitation Facilities (Part B)\n37. The water supply systems in the project towns will be essentially piped water supply with\nprivate yard connections. Community taps will be provided for poorer areas adjacent to the\ndistribution  systems.  Collective  or  household-based  rainwater  harvesting  materials  will  be\nprovided  to  poor  communities  where  accessing  the  piped  water  supply  systems  is  neither\ntechnically nor financially feasible. To reduce the overall cost of the subproject, especially the\ncost  of  O&M,  rainwater  harvesting  will  also  be  considered  as  either  an  alternative  or  a\nsupplementary facility for communities where intensive pumping or treatment is required. Subject\nto concurrence from the WUSCs in the project towns, the piped water supply systems intend to\nachieve the following service level: (i) increased per capita water supply; (ii) 24-hour supply with\nadequate residual pressure heads for private connections; (iii) essentially full coverage of the", "13\ndesignated service area; (iv) treated water to meet WHO drinking water quality standards, or\nnational standards when in effect; and (v) predominantly private yard connections, with provision\nfor some community taps and indoor connections. The subprojects in the small towns typically will\nhave  the  following  components:  intake  structure;  transmission  mains;  treatment  facilities\n(sedimentation,  filtration,  and  disinfection);  surface  reservoirs  (gravity  systems);  tubewells\n(pumped systems); submersible pumps; electrical facilities; overhead tank (tubewell systems);\ndistribution mains; house connections; community standposts; appurtenances; pumphouse; and\nguard quarters. The systems will have a 15-year design period, with demand parameters as\nshown in Table 3.\nTable 3: Water Demand Parameters (lpcd) for the Small Towns\n1993 DWSS Design Recommended\nNo. Type of Connection\nGuidelines Demand\n1.

The Project will provide sanitation facilities for both private and public uses. Where space\nis insufficient for private latrines, communal sewerage systems with communal septic tanks will\nbe built, one for every 100 households in the core areas of some Terai towns. In addition, public\nlatrines will be constructed in public areas such as schools, bus parks, and markets. The Project\nwill also provide basic storm water drainage in the core areas of the project towns usually around\nthe markets.\n3.  Technical Support to WUSCs (Part C)\n39. To ensure that WUSCs obtain the necessary capacity to manage the completed water\nsupply systems, WUSC representatives in each of the project towns will receive technical and\nfinancial training during the project implementation period. Technical training will be provided by\nthe design consultants covering system operations, preventive maintenance, and water source\nprotection. Financial training covering tariff planning, billing, collection, and basic accounting will\nbe provided by TDF. In addition, this component will establish technical support centers in each of\nthe five regional offices of DWSS, to provide post-construction, fee-based services to WUSCs\nincluding (i) engineering and other technical support; (ii) water quality monitoring and testing; (iii)\nwater meter calibration; (iv) training in water quality testing and meter calibration (trainees may\ninclude private business persons); and (v) issuing water quality and meter calibration certificates.", "14\n4.  Project Implementation Assistance (Part D)\n40. This component will cover (i) consulting services for project implementation, subproject\nfeasibility studies, engineering designs, construction supervision, and training; (ii) vehicles and\nproject administration equipment; and (iii) project incremental administrative expenses.\nC.  Cost Estimates\n41. The total project cost is estimated at $53.9 million equivalent, comprising $29.7 million (55\npercent) as foreign exchange cost, including $0.7 million interest charges during construction;\nand $24.2 million equivalent (45 percent) as local currency cost, including duties and taxes of\n$4.3 million (Table 4).\nTable 4: Summary of Project Cost Estimates\n($ million)\nForeign Local Total\nItem Exchange Currency Cost\nA.

Financing Plan\n42. It is proposed that the local governments and water consumers contribute, in cash and in\nkind, 20 percent of the subproject construction cost, representing about 15 percent of the total\nproject cost; that the Government contribute 20 percent of the total project cost, including taxes\nand duties of about 8 percent; and that ADB provide a loan of $35 million equivalent from its\nSpecial Funds resources to cover 65 percent of the total Project cost. The ADB loan will have a\nmaturity of 32 years with a grace period of 8 years, and an interest rate of 1 percent per annum\nduring the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter (Table 5).\nTable 5: Proposed Financing Plan\n($ million)\nForeign Local Total Percent\nSource Exchange Currency Cost\nADB 29.7 5.3 35.0 65.0\nGovernment 0.0 10.9 10.9 20.0\nLocal Governments 0.0 8.0 8.0 15.0\nand Water Users\nTotal 29.7 24.2 53.9          100.0\nADB = Asian Development Bank.", "15\n43. At each project town, subproject (town project) financing will be as follows: water supply\nsystems will be financed by WUSCs (20 percent in cash or kind), TDF (30 percent, which will be\ncharged  to  WUSCs  as  subloans),  and  PMO  (50  percent);  public  sanitation  facilities  will  be\nfinanced by local governments (20 percent) and PMO (80 percent); and private latrines will be\nfinanced by participating households (minimum 50 percent) and PMO (up to 50 percent). All other\nrelated costs, including consulting services, PAC, HHE, training, and incremental administrative\nexpenses, will be financed by PMO using project funds.\n44. For water supply systems, apart from the up-front contributions by WUSCs, 30 percent of\nthe construction cost of a town project will be provided by MOF via TDF as subloans to the\nWUSCs, which will be repaid from water tariffs to be collected by WUSCs. The repayments may\nbe used by TDF for financing similar town projects till maturity of its borrowings from MOF. MOF\nwill relend the ADB loan to TDF at an interest rate of 5 percent per annum with 20 years maturity\nincluding a grace period of 5 years. TDF will onlend the funds to WUSCs at an interest rate of 8\npercent per annum with a maturity of 12-15 years including a grace period of 3 years. MOF will\nbear  the  exchange  risk.  MOF,  TDF,  DWSS,  and  ADB  will  jointly  review  the  relending  and\nonlending rates every two years from the date of loan effectiveness to ensure that the rates are in\nline with the general economic conditions of the country.\nE.  The Executing Agency\n45. The Ministry of Physical Planning and Works (MPPW) will be the Executing Agency of the\nproposed Project. MPPW is responsible for formulating and guiding sector activities to meet\nobjectives  and  targets  outlined  in  the  national  development  plans  and  will  have  overall\nresponsibility for the Project. DWSS, the Implementing Agency (IA) for the proposed Project, is\nthe lead agency in the sector. As IA for the past four ADB rural water supply and sanitation sector\nprojects,  DWSS  has  gained  substantial  experience,  especially  through  the  third  and  fourth\nprojects, in implementing sector loans for community-based, demand-driven rural water supply\nand sanitation projects. DWSS has the largest pool of qualified water and sanitation engineers in\nthe  country.  Since  the  ADB  third  rural  water  supply  and  sanitation  project,  DWSS  has\nemphasized the need to improve the social skills of its staff. It has provided staff training in\ndevelopment  issues  related  to  gender,  community  development,  and  NGOs.  It  has  been\ntransforming itself from project implementer in its early years to development facilitator. It has\nfairly well-maintained project accounts, which have been audited by the auditor general of the\nGovernment  in  accordance  with  the  auditing  standards  of  the  International  Organization  of\nSupreme Audit Institutions. The audit reports from the Office of the Auditor General have affirmed\nthat  the  financial  statements  from  the  project  offices  under  DWSS  gave  a  true  and  fair\npresentation of the financial positions of the project accounts.\nF.  Implementation Arrangements\n1.  Project Execution and Coordination\n46. DWSS has established a PMO to manage the Project on a day-to-day basis. PMO, with\nsupport from Project consultants, is responsible for overall implementation and coordination. It will\nset up, at each project town, a town project office (TPO) with qualified staff, including a female\nsocial worker, to coordinate the field activities of consultants, NGOs, local governments, and\nWUSCs. TPO will also supervise the town project implementation, certify the quality and quantity\nof contractor outputs, and submit town project progress reports to PMO. TPO will include two\nrepresentatives from the local WUSC, at least one being female. Where more than one WUSC is\ninvolved in a town project service area, the water users will set up an apex WUSC.", "16\n47. The local governments will be responsible for providing the initial information required for\ntown project application and ensuring that WUSCs will be established in the town project service\narea. An application for project funding, endorsed by the DDC concerned, will be submitted jointly\nby the local government and WUSC to PMO for evaluation. The local governments will contribute\n20 percent of the construction cost of the public sanitation components in the towns, while the\nWUSCs will contribute 20 percent of the construction cost of the water supply systems in the\nservice area. The WUSCs will borrow 30 percent of the water supply construction cost from TDF\nand will be collecting tariffs from the users for the repayment.16 The WUSCs will own the water\nsupply systems and will be responsible for O&M of the systems, setting water tariffs, collecting\ntariffs, and repaying the debt to TDF.\n48. TDF will be responsible for the financial sustainability of the town projects. It will examine\nthe town project costs in connection with the debt servicing capabilities of the local governments\nand the WUSCs; recommend and monitor water tariffs in the project towns to cover at least O&M\nand debt service payments; provide basic training in tariff planning, bookkeeping and accounting\nto WUSCs; disburse and collect loans; ensure that the funds will be used for the intended town\nprojects; and exercise other due diligence as required of a prudent financial institution. TDF will\nparticipate in procurement activities related to town project implementation.\n49. To coordinate the activities of DWSS, TDF, local governments, and WUSCs, a project\ncoordination committee (PCC) will be set up with the Secretary of MPPW as the chairperson and\nthe Joint Secretary of MPPW as the alternate chairperson. The PCC will comprise the Director\nGeneral of DWSS, Executive Director of TDF, and a senior official each from MOF, MLD, and the\nMinistry of Law, Justice, and Parliamentary Affairs. The PCC may invite as ad hoc members\nrepresentatives of local governments and WUSCs from the project towns where particular issues\narise. The PMO manager will serve as member-secretary. The PCC may invite ADB staff, subject\nmatter experts, and NGO representatives as observers. The PCC will meet every quarter or upon\nthe request by any of its members.\n50. Each town project will be demand-driven and formulated through an interactive process\ninvolving significant community participation. The cycle starts from a joint application by the local\ngovernment and WUSC with DDC endorsement. PMO will evaluate and prioritize the applications\naccording to agreed-upon criteria. When the participation of a project town is confirmed, PMO will\nengage an NGO to conduct a PAC to ensure public understanding of the project procedures and\nthe rights and responsibilities of each stakeholder. The WUSC will sign a CAP to confirm its\nwillingness to participate in the Project according to the broad terms and conditions as outlined in\nthe CAP. Consultants will then undertake a feasibility study of various options for the water supply\nand associated service levels and the costs. The recommendations of the feasibility study will be\npresented jointly by the consultants, PMO, and TDF to the WUSC for confirmation. When the\ncommunities confirm the critical design parameters and cost contribution for the town project,\ndetailed engineering design will start. Before tendering, a town project agreement will be signed\nby the WUSC and PMO upon completion of detailed design. The WUSC will be represented in\nthe  evaluation  committee  to  review  the  bid  evaluations  prepared  by  PMO.  With  two\nrepresentatives at the TPO, the communities will also be involved in supervising the town project\nimplementation. It is expected that this interactive process will link service level with affordability\nas well as enhance ownership of the town projects by the local communities.\n                                                \n16According to Water Resources Act 2049 (1992), Water Users Associations (WUAs) are autonomous corporate\nbodies and may act as legal persons to acquire and dispose of properties and sue and be sued.", "17\n2.  Town Project Selection Criteria\n51. To ensure objectivity in prioritizing the project towns, town project selection criteria were\nestablished. The criteria reflect socioeconomic and health conditions as well as willingness to pay\nby  the  communities  for  improved  water  supply  and  sanitation  services  in  the  small  towns.\nCommunities in selected towns must cofinance a minimum of 20 percent of the construction cost,\nand repay through water tariffs, an additional 30 percent of the cost over time. The communities\nmay contribute their share of the construction cost in a mix of cash, labor, or local materials, but\nwith a minimum of 5 percent of the cost in cash. The following factors are included in the\nselection criteria and PMO will prepare the weights to be assigned to each factor before the\nselection:\n(i)  poverty incidence and average income levels;\n(ii)  quality, quantity, and coverage of existing facilities in the service areas;\n(iii)  quality and distance of water sources;\n(iv)  average time spent by individuals to collect water;\n(v)  percentage of cash and in-kind contribution by WUSC;\n(vi)  percentage of cash and in-kind contribution by local bodies or other sources; and\n(vii)  existence of a structure plan for the town.\n3.  Implementation Schedule\n52. The implementation of town projects will involve substantial interaction with the local\ncommunities and governments. The Project is expected to be completed over a six-year period,\nwith initial project preparation commencing in early 2001. The project implementation schedule is\npresented in Appendix 6.\n4.  Operation and Maintenance\n53. O&M of the installed water supply systems will be the responsibility of the WUSCs.\nDepending on the complexities of the systems, WUSCs may choose to have their own members\nundertake O&M, hire qualified individuals, contract out O&M to private operators, or obtain fee-\nbased services from DWSS district offices. The design consultants will give WUSCs training in\nO&M  of  installed  systems.  The  training  will  also  help  WUSCs  monitor  and  supervise  the\nperformance of private operators. The Project will establish regional technical support centers to\nprovide postconstruction technical support to WUSCs for O&M. O&M of the public latrines, drains,\nsewers and communal septic tanks will be the responsibility of the local bodies.\n5.  Procurement\n54. Goods and services financed by ADB under the Project will be procured in accordance\nwith ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. Civil works and supplies for each town project will be\npackaged in one contract. Each contract costing more than $1 million will be awarded following\ninternational competitive bidding (ICB) procedures. For contracts costing $1 million or less, local\ncompetitive  bidding  (LCB)  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB  will  be  followed.  Procurement  of\nequipment and vehicles will follow ICB procedures for contracts valued more than $500,000,\ninternational  shopping  procedures  for  contracts  valued  at  $500,000  or  less.  Minor  office\nequipment  and  consumables  costing  less  than  $100,000  may  be  procured  through  direct\npurchase. Materials required for the construction of private latrines in a project town will be\nprocured through direct negotiations from domestic markets following procedures acceptable to", "18\nADB. Minor works for the development and maintenance of Project facilities may be carried out\nby DWSS on a force account basis.\n55. PMO  will  be  responsible  for  recruiting  consultants,  qualifying  civil  works  contractors,\nevaluating bids, and making recommendations. Recommendations have to be endorsed by the\nevaluation committee, comprising, apart from Government officials, representatives from TDF and\nWUSCs. PMO will prequalify civil works contractors under ICB procedures, and postqualify civil\nworks contractors under LCB procedures. To create employment opportunities and generate\ngoodwill in the communities in the project towns, contractors will be encouraged to subcontract a\npercentage, to be determined by the detailed designs, of the total contract amount of the civil\nworks to local contractors.\n6.  Advance Action\n56. To expedite project implementation, the Government requested ADB approval of advance\naction in recruiting consultants. ADB approved the request as DWSS had actually taken advance\naction  approved  in  earlier  ADB-assisted  projects.  The  Government  has  been  informed  that\napproval of advance action does not commit ADB to finance the whole or any part of the\nproposed Project.\n7.  Consulting Services\n57. Consulting  services  will  be  provided  for  feasibility  studies,  engineering  designs,\nconstruction  supervision,  and  project  implementation  support,  in  accordance  with  ADB's\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the\nengagement  of  domestic  consultants.  International/regional  and  domestic  consultants  with\nexpertise in project implementation will be recruited to provide project implementation support to\nPMO. The consulting services will comprise a total of 233 person-months (5 international and 228\ndomestic).  Consulting  services  for  feasibility  studies,  engineering  designs,  and  construction\nsupervision, estimated at 1,806 person-months of domestic services, will be procured on a town\nproject basis as and when a small town is selected. PMO will shortlist domestic consulting firms\nfor this purpose and will prepare detailed terms of reference for the required consulting services\nfor each selected small town. PMO will invite proposals from the shortlisted consulting firms,\nevaluate the proposals, and award the contract. The shortlist will be updated from time to time\nbased on the performance of the consulting firms.\n58. To conduct PAC and HHE programs in the Project towns, the project will engage the\nservices of qualified NGOs. PMO will shortlist domestic NGOs for this purpose and will prepare\nthe terms of reference for the required services for each project town. PMO will invite proposals\nfrom the shortlisted NGOs, evaluate the proposals, and award the contract. The shortlist will be\nupdated from time to time based on the performance of the NGOs. Detailed terms of reference for\nconsulting services are presented in Appendix 7.\n8.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement\n59. Land acquisition is not envisaged as most of the small towns have sufficient public land\nand generally the land required for the construction of water reservoirs or small treatment plants\nis small. Where land acquisition is required, the WUSC will be responsible for obtaining the land\nprior to awarding the civil works contract. In cases such land is purchased by WUSC from its\nmembers, the cost of the land will be valued according to the rates specified by the District Land\nRevenue Office, and considered part of the required community contribution to the town project", "19\ncost, in addition to their cash contribution. Local governments will be responsible for providing\npublic land needed for constructing public latrines and communal septic tanks. Resettlement, if\nany,  will  be  arranged  by  WUSCs  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  on  involuntary\nresettlement. A short resettlement plan is included in the CAP for guidance of the WUSCs and\nlocal governments. If land acquisition causes significant resettlement, the resettlement plan will\nbe submitted to ADB for approval.\n9.  Disbursement Procedures\n60. PMO will be responsible for preparing disbursement projections and requesting budgetary\nallocations for the counterpart funds. It will establish an imprest account for the Project. The initial\namount will be no more than a six-month projected disbursement. The imprest accounts will be\nestablished, managed, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook.\nMOF will release funds to TDF through disbursement arrangements acceptable to ADB. PMO\nand TDF will coordinate in the timely release of funds to the contractors.\n10.  Reports, Accounts, and Audit\n61. PMO, with assistance from the consultants, will submit to ADB project progress reports\nevery four months in format and details acceptable to ADB. The PMO Manager will submit a\nproject completion report to the Government and ADB within three months of physical completion\nof the Project. The report will, among others, highlight the development impacts achieved.\n62. PMO will set up the project accounts in accordance with Government guidelines. TPOs\nwill assist in collecting and reporting the information required by PMO. The project accounts,\nincluding the imprest accounts, and financial statements of TDF will be audited by auditors\nacceptable to ADB. Assisted by the consultants, PMO will prepare the required information for\naudit in accordance with ADB\u2019s project auditing requirements. Project audit will be carried out\nannually, and audited statements of project accounts and financial statements will be submitted to\nADB within 12 months of the close of the Government's fiscal year.\n11.  Loan Reviews\n63. ADB will conduct loan reviews at least twice yearly. In addition, a comprehensive review\nwill be carried out about 24 months after loan effectiveness. The comprehensive review will\nevaluate the actual progress of each project component; implementation procedures; monitoring\nand evaluation (M&E) activities; functions of the PMO, TDF, and TPOs; relending and onlending\nrates, and the performance of the consultants and the selected NGOs. The financial performance\nand cost recovery of selected WUSCs will also be evaluated. Remedial action will be taken to\naddress any identified problems.\n12.  Monitoring and Evaluation\n64. PMO, assisted by the design consultants, will finalize project performance indicators and\nestablish baseline conditions in consultation with the WUSC and local government in each project\ntown  for  purposes  of  project  M&E.  M&E  indicators  and  procedures  will  be  tested  for  data\navailability  and  other  constraints,  revised  if  necessary,  and  institutionalized  in  WUSCs  and\nDWSS. DWSS will be ultimately responsible for maintaining the M&E systems. A list of indicative\nperformance indicators is presented in Appendix 8.", "20\nG.  Environmental and Social Measures\n65. The Project will substantially improve the environmental sanitation conditions in all project\ntowns with the improvement of water supply, storm water drainage, and public and private\nsanitation facilities. The Project will apply WHO drinking water standards in designing water\nsystems in the project towns and will provide water quality testing services to WUSCs. These will\nhave a long-term impact on environmental conditions and enhance the health profiles in the\nproject  towns.  Initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)  were  undertaken  during  project\npreparation in the eight sample project towns under the TA (footnote 2). The IEEs concluded that\nthe Project would have no significant adverse environmental effects. A summary IEE is presented\nin Appendix 9.\n66. To ensure that women's concerns regarding water supply and sanitation are addressed in\nthe town projects, the Project requires TPOs to have at least one female social worker and one\nwoman representative from the WUSC. Land acquisition and the subsequent resettlement, if any,\nwill be handled by the WUSC and the local government where it takes place, following ADB's\nguidelines. This action will be specified in the CAP. NGOs will be engaged in conducting the PAC\nand HHE. These measures will maximize the participation of women and the local communities in\nthe project towns. The social dimensions of the Project are summarized in Appendix 10.\nV.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA.  Financial and Economic Analyses\n67. Financial and economic analyses of the water supply schemes were carried out in the\neight sample towns during the TA study, and the identified economic benefits were subsequently\nverified during appraisal. The financial analysis concludes that the proposed water tariffs are\nwithin the affordable level of even the low-income groups, and that the subprojects are financially\nviable as they all have positive financial internal rates of return (FIRRs). The weighted average\ncost of capital are assumed to be zero for all the sample town projects. The economic analysis\nconcludes that the economic benefits of the subprojects outweigh the associated economic costs.\nThe weighted average economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the sample subprojects is\nhigher than the assumed economic cost of capital. Detailed financial and economic analyses are\npresented in Appendix 11.\n1.  Tariff Structure and Affordability\n68. Tariff structures for the sample project towns were developed based on assumptions of\ncapital and operating expenditures and taking into consideration the financing arrangements, the\nneed to achieve positive cash balance for the WUSCs, and affordability to the households. There\nare two tariff blocks: tariffs in the lower block (lifeline rate) are in the range of NRs8-15/cubic\nmeter (m3) and those in the higher block (non-lifeline) are at least 1.5 times the lifeline rate (Table\n6). For average-income households, the percentage of income spent on water ranges from 2.0\npercent in Birendranagar to 5.0 percent in Fikkal and Attariya. The average monthly expenditure\non water will be 3.9 percent with an average monthly bill of NRs234. In the case of low-income\nhouseholds, the percentage of household income spent on water ranges from 1.7 percent in\nBirendranagar to 4.9 percent in Attariya. The average for the eight towns is 3.6 percent. While\nthese tariffs are higher than existing ones, they all fall below 5 percent of the household income\nlevel, which is generally considered as the affordability threshold. The tariff structure is developed\nassuming provision of a 24-hour water supply. At the proposed tariffs, the WUSCs should be able\nto accumulate funds to provide for any major capital replacement after 20 years, thus ensuring\nthe continued operation of the schemes.", "21\nTable 6: Tariff Structures and Affordability\nItem AttariyaBirendranagar Fikkal Gaighat Lekhnath Parsa RatnanagarBandipur Average\nTariff Structure (NRs)\nBlocks (m3/month)\n0-10 m3 12.3 8.0 15.0 9.0 12.0 12.5 12.0 12.0 11.6\n> 10 m3 19.0 12.0 22.0 17.0 18.0 19.0 18.0 18.0 17.9\nAverage Tariff (NRs) 15.6 9.5 18.3 12.0 14.4 14.9 14.8 14.0 14.2\nAverage HH\nMonthly Bill (NRs) 313 152 293 192 237 239 237 210 234\n% HH Income 5.0 2.0 5.0 4.2 3.8 3.6 3.4 3.9 3.9\nLow-Income HH\nMonthly Bill (NRs) 161 80 150 90 120 125 120 120 121\n% HH Income 4.9 1.7 4.5 3.4 2.8 4.3 3.6 3.8 3.6\nHH = households, m3 = cubic meter.\n2.  Economic and Financial Viability and Sensitivity Analyses\n69. The results of the financial and economic analyses of the subprojects in the sample towns\nare shown in Table 7. All the EIRRs are above 12 percent, the assumed opportunity cost of\ncapital. The subprojects are also considered financially viable as the FIRRs are positive in all\ncases. The weighted average cost of capital for the WUSCs is assumed to be zero as the\nWUSCs have no capital of their own except, if anything at all, limited budgetary allocations from\nthe central and district governments.\nTable 7: Summary of Economic and Financial Analyses\nItem Attariya Birendranagar Fikkal Gaighat Lekhnath Parsa Ratnanagar Bandipur Average\nEIRR (%) 15.6 16.1 36.0 16.2 17.4 17.5 19.1 16.1 17.2\nFIRR (%) 2.9 3.3 2.8 2.8 2.9 2.7 2.6 2.4 2.8\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, FIRR = financial internal rate of return.\n70. Sensitivity analysis was undertaken to test the overall responsiveness of the weighted\naverage EIRR and FIRR of the water supply projects to adverse changes in the key variables.\nThe variables tested were increases in capital and O&M costs and a reduction in project benefits.\nThe analysis shows that both the FIRR and EIRR are more sensitive to a decline in subproject\nbenefits, but are less sensitive to an increase in capital or O&M costs (Table 8). The EIRR is\nconsidered relatively robust overall and the FIRR remains positive under all scenarios.\nTable 8: Sensitivity Analysis\nParameters EIRR (%) SI (%) FIRR (%) SI (%)\nBase Case 17.2 2.8\nCapital Costs +10% 15.5 8.9 2.0 29.1\nOperating Costs +10% 16.9 1.3 2.5 13.4\nCapital plus Operating Costs +10% 15.0 1.7\nProject Benefits -10% 14.8 12.3 1.5 45.8\nCombination of the above 13.2 0.5\nSensitivity indicator (SI) measures the percentage change in EIRR or FIRR with a 10 percent change in a parameter.", "22\n3.  Subsidies\n71. Water supply and sanitation development in the past was subsidized. While cost recovery\nof O&M had been built into the design of the third and fourth ADB-assisted projects, earlier ADB\nassistance  to  rural  water  supply  and  sanitation  development  provided  up  to  90  percent  of\nsubsidies for capital expenditures. This was considered necessary because of the extremely low\nlevel  of  incomes  and  the  perceived  socioeconomic  benefits  of  such  projects  to  the  poor\nhouseholds. The need to further reduce capital expenditure subsidies is an important part of the\npolicy dialogue between ADB and the Government. Under the proposed Project, local water\nusers will contribute up to 50 percent of the capital cost of the subprojects, with 20 percent to be\npaid up-front and 30 percent to be paid over the next 12-15 years as subloan repayments. The\nproposed cost recovery arrangements are based on the findings of the socioeconomic surveys,\npublic awareness workshops, sector experience of other external funding agencies in the country,\nas well as the policy dialogue.\n72. Nepal is ranked among the countries with the poorest health profiles in the world. Poor\nsanitation conditions all over the country are major contributors to the poor health profiles. People\nin  many  rural  and  semiurban  areas  are  traditionally  reluctant  to  use  latrines,  causing\nenvironmental and health problems in the areas. To encourage people to build and use latrines,\nand considering the positive externalities of sanitation facilities, the Project will also provide\nsubsidies  as  matching  funds  to  low-income  households  that  are  willing  to  construct  private\nlatrines. The subsidies will be limited to 50 percent of the construction cost of the latrines, and will\nbe used for procuring materials that are not available locally.\n73. Under the proposed Project, WUSCs will borrow 30 percent of the subproject construction\ncost from TDF at an interest rate of 8 percent per annum. TDF obtains these funds from MOF at\nan interest rate of 5 percent per annum. These rates are lower than the prevailing market rates,\nreflecting a subsidy in the subloans to the WUSCs. Nevertheless, replacing a portion of the grants\nwith subloans to WUSCs represents unprecedented progress toward cost recovery in the sector.\nIt is expected that with the increase of income of the people in the small towns, the percentage of\nthe cost recovery of the capital expenditure could be further improved in a phased manner in the\nfuture. The proposed relending and onlending rates take into consideration affordability to the\nlow-income households, the financial constraints of the local governments, and acceptability to\nthe general public.\nB.  Environment\n74. The  overall  environmental  benefits  of  the  proposed  Project  are  significant  and\nwidespread. The Project will improve the urban environment and the quality of life in the project\ntowns. The people living in the project towns currently do not have adequate access to safe water\nsupply and sanitation facilities and constantly face environmental pollution. The storm water\ndrainage  and  public  latrines,  communal  sewerage,  and  communal  septic  tanks  will  have  a\npositive impact on the overall environmental situation in the congested core urban areas such as\nmarkets, schools, and bus terminals. The HHE programs to be carried out by NGOs will help\ncommunities  to  improve  their  own  environment,  which  is  currently  being  degraded  by\ninappropriate disposal of human and animal waste, sewage, and solid waste. The improvement of\nenvironmental health conditions will lead to improvement in socioeconomic conditions of the\npeople living in the project towns.", "23\nC.  Social Dimensions\n1.   Impact on Poverty\n75. According  to  official  statistics,  people  living  below  the  official  poverty  line  in  Nepal,\nestimated at NRs4,404 per capita per annum in 1996 prices, accounted for 42 percent in the\ncountry, 44 percent in the rural areas, 34 percent in the urban areas other than Kathmandu, and 4\npercent in Kathmandu. Since most of the small towns are essentially in the rural areas, the ratio\nof the poor to the total population in the small towns is estimated between 34 and 42 percent.\nHowever, poverty has many dimensions. Apart from low income, poverty is also reflected in the\nhardships of the poor in accessing basic services and their vulnerability in the absence of such\nservices. Another dimension of poverty is the poor's lack of power and voice in the development\nprocess. This absence of participation in the development process has resulted in the failure of\nmany poverty reduction programs to actually reach the poor.\n76. The Project is expected to have positive impacts on poverty. The improved water supply\nand sanitation facilities will significantly reduce the costs to the poor in terms of purchasing,\ntreating, and storing water; the medical expenses on waterborne diseases; and lost productive\ntime due to water fetching or illness. As noted earlier, the women in the eight towns surveyed\nspent an average of 2.3 hours a day fetching water during the dry season. The Project will\nprovide  in-premise  taps  and  community  taps  that  will  reduce  the  hardships  of  the  poor  in\naccessing this basic service. The safe water supply combined with sanitation facilities will reduce\nthe vulnerability of the poor to such adverse changes as drying out of a nearby pond, pollution of\nthe shallow well water, or spread of water-borne diseases. Apart from the impacts arising from\nincreased  access  to  safe  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities,  the  Project  will  also  create\nemployment opportunities for low-skilled labor in the project towns for the construction of the\nwater supply and sanitation facilities. The Project will maximize the participation of people living in\nthe small towns in the decision-making process of the town projects, and will provide training and\ncapacity building to the WUSCs for that purpose. While these measures alone are not sufficient to\neradicate poverty, their combination is expected to have a sustainable positive impact on poverty.\n2.  Participation\n77. Empowerment of the local communities and capacity building for the WUSCs are an\nintegral part of the project design. While substantial interactions with the local communities were\nundertaken during the TA study, these will be further strengthened at each stage of the town\nproject formulation, implementation, and O&M. The Project requires that each town project follow\nan interactive process involving PMO, the local communities, and NGOs. Each town project must\nbe initiated jointly by the local government and the WUSC. Upon receipt of a town's application to\nparticipate in the Project, PMO will commence a PAC in the service area of the town through a\nselected NGO. The purpose is to fully disseminate the project information to the general public. In\nparticular, the public will be informed of the rights and responsibilities of the water users in the\ntown project as well as the procedures of town project formulation. The representatives of the\nwater  users  have  to  sign  a  preliminary  agreement  in  the  form  of  a  CAP  with  PMO,  fully\nacknowledging the rights and responsibilities therein. Feasibility study and preliminary design will\nthen start. The result of the study and the design will be presented to the WUSC for confirmation.\nIf it accepts the detailed design, the WUSC will sign a town project agreement with PMO. WUSC\nrepresentatives will be included in the evaluation committee for bid evaluation and will participate\nin the supervision of contractors and verification of the quantity and quality of their output. The\nWUSC will take full responsibility for O&M of the installed town project. The interactive process is\nexpected to not only ensure the local communities\u2019 ownership of the town project, but also\nenhance their willingness to pay for the higher tariffs.", "24\n3.  Governance\n78. The Local Self-Governance Act, 2056 (1999) recently approved by the Government aims\nto strengthen the decentralization process by delegating greater authority and responsibility to\nlocal authorities. Under the Act, municipalities and VDCs are established as autonomous bodies\nthat can levy certain taxes, enter into loan agreements, acquire assets, and participate in legal\nsuits. The bodies are also given the rights, roles, and responsibility for protecting water sources,\nconstructing water supply infrastructure, and preparing, executing and maintaining drinking water\nsupplies.  The  Act  stipulates  that  village-level  projects  will  be  implemented  through  user\ncommittees vested with the power to collect fees from the consumers. The Act indicates that\neventually the role of line agencies will be mainly to finance and facilitate activities, under the\nguidance and direction of the local government. To support the decentralization process, the\nProject requires that DWSS transfer all the water supply schemes under its operation to local\nauthorities within a 10-year time frame. Such transfer will facilitate the transformation of DWSS\nfrom a project implementer to a development facilitator, enhance local authorities' ownership of\nthe installed facilities, improve Government efficiency in infrastructure development and O&M,\nand, most importantly, enable local authorities to base future development programs on a realistic\ncost of water.\n79. Transparency is an important consideration in project design. ADB and Government have\nagreed that, prior to loan effectiveness, DWSS will print and distribute to the local authorities and\nWUSCs  the  procedures  of  town  project  formulation,  implementation,  O&M,  and  rights  and\nresponsibilities of each stakeholder, including capital cost sharing. DWSS will organize at least\nfive regional workshops with participants from local authorities and WUSCs to explain the design\nof the Project and to address the concerns of the local representatives. The communities will be\nfully informed and will have the right to decide whether or not to participate in the Project at the\nearly stages of the project cycle, including PAC, feasibility study, and detailed design. WUSCs will\nalso participate in bid evaluation and construction supervision. The CAP further requires WUSCs\nto fully disclose town project-related information to their members. These measures are expected\nto enhance transparency and improve governance at central and local levels.\nD. Risks\n80. The main risks related to the Project are (i) ineffective project management due to poor\ncoordination between PMO and TDF; (ii) poor performance of TDF in collecting and recycling the\nsubloans because of inadequate capacity; (iii) poor financial performance of WUSCs in collecting\nadequate  tariffs  to  cover  the  O&M  cost  and  debt  service  payments;  (iv)  difficulties  of  the\nsubproject contractors in coordinating the labor and material inputs of local communities; and (v)\nfrequent change of key personnel of PMO and TDF by the Government.\n81. Close  coordination  between  PMO  and  TDF  with  respect  to  town  project  appraisal,\nconsultants and contractors evaluation, loan funds disbursements, and M&E, is essential for\nsuccessful project implementation. TDF, with assistance from German Agency for Technical\nCooperation17 (GTZ), has developed its own project appraisal and monitoring procedures, which\nvary from those of DWSS. To ensure smooth coordination between the two institutions, DWSS\nand TDF reached an agreement by way of a memorandum of understanding delineating the roles\nand responsibilities of each at every stage of a town project cycle. In cases of unexpected dispute\nduring project implementation, PCC will guide and coordinate.\n                                                \n17 Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit.", "25\n82. Although  TDF  has  been  in  operation  for  more  than  10  years,  most  of  its  lending\noperations have been concentrated in the past five years. To ensure that TDF has the capacity to\nmanage the subloans, staff examined its institutional and financial capabilities and concluded that\nTDF is an effective organization and will be able to manage the subloans. GTZ has confirmed\nthat it will continue to provide technical support to TDF at least till June 2004. Loan review\nmissions  will  periodically  review  the  performance  of  TDF  and  take  appropriate  actions  as\nnecessary.\n83. To  ensure  timely  and  adequate  repayment  of  subloans  by  WUSCs,  the  Project  will\nthoroughly examine the debt service capabilities of the WUSCs vis-\u00e0-vis the cost of the town\nproject. The design of the town project will consider affordability, and processing will progress\nonly when WUSCs confirm their agreement on the proposed water tariffs that will cover at least\nthe O&M and debt service expenses. In addition, the Project will provide capacity building and\ntraining to the WUSCs in terms of tariff planning, billing, and collection. Experience shows that\nwillingness  to  pay  will  significantly  improve  if  the  water  users  are  fully  involved  in  project\npreparation and implementation, and if the services are indeed improved.\n84. While the community contribution to the town project cost in labor and local materials will\nenhance local ownership, it will also increase the risk of delay because of the difficulties for town\nproject contractors to manage the timely input of these local contributions. To mitigate such a risk,\na major task of TPO will be to coordinate with WUSCs and town project contractors and carry out\nfield inspection and measurement with respect to timely availability of the local contributions.\nMaintaining  a  stable  team  of  professionals  in  the  PMO  has  been  critical  to  successful\nimplementation of ADB projects. ADB and the Government have agreed that the project manager\nwill keep that position for a minimum of two years, in line with the Government legislation, and\nany replacement must have qualifications acceptable to ADB.\nVI.  ASSURANCES\n85. The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n(i)  A project coordination committee (PCC) will be established before 31 December\n2000, with the Secretary of MPPW serving as the chairperson, and the Joint\nSecretary of MPPW as the alternate chairperson. PCC will comprise the Director\nGeneral of DWSS, Executive Director of TDF, and a senior official each from MOF,\nMLD,  and  the  Ministry  of  Law,  Justice,  and  Parliamentary  Affairs.  The  PMO\nmanager will serve as member-secretary of PCC. PCC may invite representatives\nof the WUSCs and the local governments from the towns where particular issues\narise as ad hoc members, and ADB staff, subject matter specialists, consultants,\nand NGO representatives as observers. PCC will meet every quarter or upon the\nrequest of any of its members.\n(ii)  DWSS will prepare and submit to ADB before 31 December 2000 a detailed 10-\nyear action plan for transferring to local authorities all water supply schemes under\nits operation.\n(iii)  PMO will, in consultation with TDF, finalize town project selection criteria and\nprocedures with proper weighting of each criterion, based on the factors specified\nin para. 51, and submit them to ADB for approval before 31 December 2000.", "26\n(iv)  A  town  project  office  will  be  established  at  each  selected  project  town,  with\nqualified staff including a female social worker, and two representatives from the\nlocal WUSC, at least one of whom is female, to coordinate all field activities and\nsupervise the town projects.\n(v)  MOF and TDF will finalize the relending agreement and TDF will finalize the\nstandard  onlending  agreement  with  the  WUSCs  before  31  December  2000,\nensuring that both agreements are acceptable to ADB.\n(vi)  TDF will\n(a)  commence  making  adequate  provisions  for  nonperforming  assets  from\nFY2000/01;\n(b)  maintain a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.1 times; and\n(c)  be  responsible  for  (1)  the  financial  sustainability  of  the  town  projects  by\nhelping set up and monitoring water tariffs in the project towns to ensure they\ncover  at  least  the  O&M  and  debt  service  payments;  (2)  providing  basic\nbookkeeping and accounting training to WUSCs; and (3) exercising other due\ndiligence required of a prudent financial institution.\n(vii)  MOF will relend ADB funds to TDF under a subsidiary loan agreement for a term\nof 20 years including a 5-year grace period, with an interest rate of 5 percent per\nannum, and TDF will onlend such funds to WUSCs for a period of 12-15 years\nincluding a 3-year grace period, with an interest rate of 8 percent per annum. MOF\nwill bear the exchange risk. These terms and conditions will be reviewed jointly\nand adjusted, if necessary, every two years from the date of loan effectiveness, by\nADB loan review missions, MOF, MPPW, and TDF.\n(viii)  Where a town project involves resettlement, a resettlement plan in line with ADB\nguidelines will be included in the town project agreement as well as the subloan\nagreement; where significant resettlement is involved, such a resettlement plan will\nbe submitted to ADB for approval before the selection of the town project civil\nworks contractors.\n(ix)  The project manager will remain in the position for a minimum of two years, and\nthe replacement must have adequate qualifications acceptable to ADB.\nVII.  RECOMMENDATION\n86.

History, Ownership, and Organizational Structure\n1.  The  Town  Development  Fund  (TDF)  was  established  under  the  Ministry  of  Physical\nPlanning and Works (MPPW) in 19891 to facilitate financing of urban infrastructure projects in\nmunicipalities or urbanizing villages. It is governed under the Town Development Act 2053 (1997),\nwith investment policies and procedures stipulated in the related Town Development Fund Rules,\n1997. The legislation establishes TDF as a Government-owned autonomous body to provide\nfinancial,  technical,  and  institutional  support  and  research  to  institutions  engaged  in  town\ndevelopment. The board of TDF comprises the secretary or the representative from MPPW (chair),\nMinistry of Finance (MOF), and Ministry of Local Development (MLD); five Government-nominated\nmayors representing the five regions; two board-nominated financial and technical experts; and an\nexecutive director appointed by the board through open competition. Others may participate as\nobservers, as necessary.\n2.  With Government approval, TDF may act with any foreign government or organization in\nareas of its activities. It is authorized to receive grant and loan funds from the Government and\nother organizations, foreign Governments, and international agencies for its programs. It may\ninvest funds, issue debentures within prescribed regulations, and retain service charges. TDF may\ngive  grants  and  loans  to  any  institution  engaged  in  town  development:  government  and\nnongovernment  institutions,  user  groups,  village  development  committees  (VDCs),  and\nmunicipalities. TDF stipulates the terms and conditions of its loan or grant and specifies conditions\nof recourse in the event of default, including seizure of pledged security. The board has an\nInvestment Promotion Committee for preparing investment policies and procedures.\n3.  TDF currently has 38 staff organized in four divisions as follows:\n(i) a deputy manager, with a Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree;\n(ii) Loans and Grants Division (a civil engineer, an engineer/architect, and holders of a\nMaster in Finance or Economics);\n(iii) Technical and Monitoring Division (6 civil engineers, 1 undergraduate);\n(iv) Finance Division (3 Bachelors in Commerce, 1 undergraduate); and\n(v) Administration Division (2 Bachelors in law, 2 Bachelors and 1 MA in commerce, 7\nundergraduates, and 11 support staff).\nAdditional staff or consultants are employed on an as-required basis. As a result, TDF maintains a\nlean organization. With the exception of the recently added lawyer and one support staff member,\nmany have been with TDF for at least 4 years, and five (including the deputy manager) for over ten\nyears.\nB.  Performance\n1.  Financial\n4.  TDF\u2019s funding for loan and grant projects to date has originated from the World Bank,\nUnited Nations Development Programme, Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW), and Deutsche\nGesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit [German Agency for Technical Cooperation] (GTZ)\nand Government contributions. As of the end of FY1999, TDF had accumulated grant funds of\n                                                \n1  Town Development Fund Board (formation) Order 2045 (1989).", "31\nAppendix 2, page 2\n$2.90 million, Government contributions of $0.19 million, and World Bank loan of $1.35 million, with\nretained earnings and capital fund totaling $0.42 million. Assets were $4.47 million, including\nproject loans of $3.56 million to municipalities.\n5.  As of the end of FY1999, TDF had disbursed $1.8 million in World Bank loans, $0.2 million\nin GTZ loans and $1.4 million in grants, and $0.5 million in KfW loans plus $1.6 million in grants.\nInterest and principal repayments have almost all been paid within the agreed-upon terms, with\noverdue interest representing 4 percent of total interest charged. Two municipalities have not met\nthe agreed-upon term, requiring the payments to be collected directly from the Government. To\ndate, no provision for loan losses has been made since repayment performance has been strong,\nwith  loans  performance  exceeding  95  percent  of  interest  and  principal  due.  Although  loan\nagreements generally have recourse to payment through the Government, TDF bears the primary\nrisk for loan losses. Recently agreed-upon terms for a second phase of KfW funding will require\nTDF to provide a minimum of 4 percent of interest due for more than 6 months, and 2 percent on\noutstanding principal amounts. The terms also include the recommendation of a recent external\npolicy review2 that TDF should retain and transfer 2 percent of its interest income to a special\ncontingency reserve for potential loan losses.\n6.  Loan approvals have averaged $560,000 annually over the past three years The average\nloan size has increased in recent years to about $110,000, the largest being $440,000. TDF is\ncurrently financing projects in all but 2 of the original 36 municipalities, with 65 projects completed\nand 70 in progress. Social infrastructure development projects include public toilet and drainage,\nwater systems, feasibility studies, solid waste collection equipment and sanitary landfills, school\nbuildings, and bus parks. Commercial loans include those to commercial retail buildings. In total\n(including grant projects), TDF has handled over 553 projects worth almost $8.5 million.\n7.  The net income for TDF has averaged NRs6.5 million,3 over the past three years, with a 3.3\npercent  average  return  on  assets  and  10.0  percent  return  on  equity.  Operating  costs  have\naveraged NRs5.8 million, about 45 percent of the financial margin. The financial statements are\naudited by an independent auditor and submitted to the Government. The board has an audit\nsubcommittee that reviews and acts on the auditor\u2019s report. The audited financial statements of\n1997,  1998,  and  1999  were  reviewed  by  the  Fact-Finding  Mission.  These  audits  included  a\nrigorous compliance review of loan procedures and terms for each project, and the board was\nresponsive to the auditor\u2019s comments.\n2.  Operational\n8.  Over its 10 years of operation, TDF has developed policies, procedures,4 and standardized\ndocuments  for  grant  and  loan  applications,  evaluations,  grant  approvals,  loan  agreements,\ntendering, fund disbursement, and repayment monitoring. Projects under KfW funding are financed\nby grants or loans, depending on the nature of the project and the income of the municipality. It has\nbeen recommended that, in the future, grants will only apply to low-income municipalities and be\nrestricted to the areas of sanitation, environment, and school projects. Grants are provided with\ncounterparts funds from the municipalities. The tendering and contracting of projects financed\nunder KfW funding are monitored by TDF\u2019s own staff at no charge to the municipalities. TDF\nsupplies technical support to the municipalities with inadequate engineering capacity to plan,\nevaluate, and oversee implementation of their projects. It also provides financial and accounting\n                                                \n2  Analysis of the Economic Situation of the Town Development Fund and Evaluation of the Loan and Grant Policy,\nHartmut Volkl Consulting Services for KfW, Frankfurt, Germany, October 1999.\n3  Conversion rate: NRs1=$0.0138 as of 16 August 2000.\n4  TDF. 1999.

The guidelines define the procedures and rules for all\nfunding under the KfW cooperation fund.", "32\nAppendix 2, page 3\ntraining,  support,  and  postimplementation  monitoring  of  operations  to  assess  financial  and\noperational performance.\n9.  For  procurement  of  consulting  services,  TDF  maintains  a  roster  of  24  prequalified\nconsultants for each of architecture and planning projects as well as engineering projects. A roster\nof  12  prequalified  consultants  is  maintained  for  each  category  of  projects.  Depending  on\nperformance, consultants are removed from the list and others added. For competitive bidding, a\nshortlist group of six consultants is drawn from the appropriate pool, based on a regular rotation. If\nless than three proposals are received, additional consultants are invited from the next group. TDF\nprepares  the  terms  of  reference  (TOR)  in  all  projects  requiring  consulting  services.  After  an\ninvitation for proposals, consultants are briefed in a prebid meeting. A two-envelope system is\nused, with 80 percent weight placed on the technical proposal and 20 percent on the financial\nproposal, with minimum requirements in each. Proposals passing the technical evaluation are then\nforwarded to TDF for review and approval before the financial bids are opened with tenderers\npresent. Contracts are awarded on a combined weighted technical and financial score. In the case\nof  supervision  assignments  to  a  design  consultant  (if  prequalified  by  TDF),  negotiations  are\nconducted directly with the consultant who prepared the master plan or design. Services, studies,\nand designs are awarded by competitive bidding if the contract value is greater than NRs0.2\nmillion.  With  contracts  not  exceeding  NRs0.5  million,  direct  negotiation  may  be  used.  The\nguidelines specify recourse in the event of cost overruns from construction delays caused by either\nthe contractor or the municipality. All projects exceeding NRs1.5 million, or where competent\ndomestic consultants are not available, must be supervised by a consultant appointed by TDF.\n10.  For procurement of construction works, projects costing less than NRs1.0 million may be\nexecuted through a User Committee or by municipalities utilizing a force account, or by suppliers\noffering the lowest price, based on quotations in three sealed envelopes (records to be maintained\nby the committee). Local shopping may be used for small purchases that are not necessarily suited\nto inclusion in other works, or where items are readily available through local suppliers. Three\nsealed quotes must be obtained, evaluated, and submitted to TDF for approval. The procedure for\nconstruction projects valued over NRs1.0 million is by tender, using standard tender documents as\nspecified in a project\u2019s appraisal report. The tendering process is similar to the bidding process for\nprocurement of consulting services, with the exception that tenders are nationally advertised. The\ntechnical  evaluation  is  based  on  financial  and  technical  past  performance  and  capacity  to\nundertake the work. Contractors are required to provide performance security. Contracts include\nboth penalties for nonperformance and incentives for early completion.\nC. Capacity for Management of Project Loan Financing\n1. Financial\n11.  Financial projections were prepared to determine the financial capacity of TDF to undertake\nthe proposed Project. As a relatively small financial institution, TDF must have sufficient spread\nbetween the relending rate from MOF and the onlending rate to the subprojects and adequate\nfinancial capacity to cover project-related costs in the intervening period until subloan repayments\nbegin  to  provide  cash  flow  and  revenue.  The  incremental  operation  costs  for  staff,  logistical\nsupport, financial training program, and administration are based on TDF estimates. Construction\ncosts were developed based on four phases of 44 construction projects, with 8 commencing in the\nfirst quarter of 2001, and 12 each in the fourth quarters of 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively.\nEach project is assumed to average NRs62.5 million in 1999 prices. Loan disbursements are\nbased  on  25  percent  of  construction  costs  being  disbursed  semiannually  over  a  two-year\nconstruction period. Based on the ratio of foreign costs to local costs, construction costs are\nassumed to increase 5 percent per year, and the price contingency will be adequately covered by", "33\nAppendix 2, page 4\nAsian Development Bank (ADB) financing being in dollars. Local inflation is estimated to continue\nat 7.0 percent, foreign inflation is assumed as 2.4 percent. As the Water Users and Sanitation\nCommittees  (WUSCs)  will  have  no  funds  to  pay  interest  until  commencement  of  operations,\ninterest during construction is assumed to be capitalized for both WUSC and TDF. Interest on\nborrowing to cover cash flow deficits is assumed at 12 percent, current commercial bank rates on\noverdrafts and loans ranging from 11.5 percent to 15 percent. Interest income on surplus funds\navailable for investment is assumed at 4 percent, current commercial rates on deposits ranging\nfrom 3 percent to 8 percent. No provision is made for income tax, assuming TDF will receive\nexemption.\n12.  Financial projections incorporate the incremental cash flow impacts of the Project with\nprojections for existing TDF operation. The TDF cash flow projections are premised on operational\nplans prior to recently agreed-upon new KfW funding. The projections show that the Project will\ninitially  have  a  negative  impact  on  TDF  incomes  during  the  period  2001-2003  until  interest\nrevenues from subloans flow in starting 2004. However, cash flow should be more than sufficient to\ncover interim expenses relating to the Project. While the overall financial positions are healthy over\nthe projection period, the current ratios will deteriorate till 2005 and improve marginally thereafter,\nindicating inadequacy of long-term capital and the need to finance operations with short-term\nborrowings. This aspect will need to be monitored closely. KfW recently approved DM14.0 million5\nfunding for TDF for a second phase of the town development program for grants and establishment\nof a long-term sustainable revolving fund for financing municipal infrastructure. Plans for managing\nthese funds have not yet been finalized. The new funding will strengthen, rather than weaken\nTDF\u2019s financial capacity, therefore the financial projections conservatively present TDF\u2019s financial\noutlook.\n2. Operational\n13.  The scale of the Project is much larger than anything TDF has handled to date, but its\nperformance  record  indicates  that  it  has  developed  significant  experience  in  working  with\nmunicipalities, and has been able to develop an efficient and effective mode of operation. Over 10\nyears of operation, TDF has developed clear policies, procedures, and standardized documents. It\nhas gained much practical experience in project identification and design, to ensure the projects\nare appropriate and responsive to the needs of the community. It has also gained considerable\nexperience in working with local contractors, improving procedures over time. As an autonomous\nbody, it has been able to exercise flexibility and responsiveness in project implementation, and\ngained trust through transparency of operations.\n14.  It  currently  has  a  trained  staff  of  38,  of  whom  15  have  graduate  or  postgraduate\nqualifications in finance and business administration, engineering, architecture, and law. Further\ncapacity building is ongoing through professional training. TDF estimates that the additional work\nfor the Project could be handled with an additional staff of two or three engineers, a financial\nspecialist, sociologist, accountant, and additional support staff of drivers and a secretary. Under\nthe  recently  approved  second  phase  KfW  funding,  the  technical  assistance  and  international\nconsultant  support  will  be  continued.

Review of First Three Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Projects\n1. Up to the early 1990s, ADB had provided three loans to the Government of Nepal for rural\nwater supply and sanitation development: Loan 719-NEP: Rural Water Supply Project, for $9.6\nmillion, approved on 11 December 1984; Loan 949-NEP: Second Water Supply Project, for $14.4\nmillion, approved on 31 January 1989; and Loan 1165-NEP: Third Water Supply and Sanitation\nSector Project, for $20 million, approved on 25 June 1992. ADB\u2019s first two rural water supply and\nsanitation projects in the 1980s were essentially supply-driven, with the Government executing\nagency serving as both project implementer and operator of the completed water schemes. There\nwas no community participation and little cost recovery. Reliance on the central Government\nbudget  for  the  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  the  rural  water  supply  schemes  was\nnonsustainable.  The  main  lesson  learned  from  the  first  and  second  projects  was  that  the\nsustainability  of  investments  would  be  at  great  risk  unless  the  communities  (i)  were  proved\nmobilized through a comprehensive education program; (ii) had established Water Users and\nSanitation  Committees  (WUSCs),  (iii)  had  indicated  a  strong  willingness  to  contribute  to  the\nsubproject; and (iv) were involved in design, construction, and maintenance. The third project\nincorporated these lessons in its basic design. It was formulated using an approach that was driven\nby the communities\u2019 needs and demands. This community-oriented approach improved the level of\nsustainability dramatically. A second set of lessons was related to the importance of building\ncapacity in the Department of Water Supply and Sewerage (DWSS) to plan its sector activities and\ntrain staff in community-based approaches. The pace of capacity building required acceleration to\nenable DWSS to cope with its new role as a facilitator of community-managed water supply and\nsanitation schemes. The experience of the third project has been factored into the design of the\nFourth Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project. Essentially, greater emphasis has been put on\ncommunity orientation by designing a discrete community education and awareness program, and\nby strengthening DWSS capacities in social facilitation.\nB.  Review of the Fourth Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project\n1.  Background\n2. The  Fourth  Rural  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector  Project,  for  $20  million,  was\napproved on 24 September 1996. The loan was declared effective on 9 January 1997. It is\nscheduled for closure on 30 June 2002, with physical completion in December 2001. The Project\naims to (i) provide water supply and low-cost sanitation in selected rural communities of the\nEastern, Mid-Western, and Far-Western Development regions; (ii) promote hygiene awareness\nwithin the communities; (iii) achieve greater sustainability following a community-based approach;\n(iv) strengthen O&M of completed project facilities; (v) improve cost recovery; and (vi) strengthen\nthe sector organizations including the WUSCs. The Project comprises (i) a community education\nand awareness program that includes a major campaign to educate rural communities on hygiene\nand water use; (ii) water supply and sanitation development including design and construction of\nabout 1,500 simple, gravity-fed piped water supply systems and 900 public latrines in about 300\nsubprojects; and (iii) implementation assistance and institutional strengthening. The Ministry of\nHousing and Physical Planning (currently named Ministry of Physical Planning and Works), as the\nline ministry for the sector, is the Executing Agency, and DWSS, the Implementing Agency.\n2.  Project Progress\n3. The Project is being implemented successfully.  Physical progress as of 15 August 2000 is\nahead of schedule with an estimated physical completion rate of 75 percent for an elapsed time of", "36\nAppendix 4, page 2\n68 percent. A total of 323 water supply subprojects were selected for implementation and appraisal\nreports were submitted to the Asian Development Bank (ADB). As of 31 July 2000, 237 water\nsupply subprojects have been completed in different districts benefiting about 500,000 people. Of\nthe 237 completed subprojects, 89 were fully handed over to WUSCs for O&M. A total of 533\ninstitutional latrines and 11,472 low-cost private latrines have been built. Construction of public\nlatrines in schools and in health posts is expected to accelerate, as additional water supply\nsubprojects are completed.  As part of implementation assistance, 7 out of 22 district office\nbuildings were completed. The remaining office buildings and the expansion of a DWSS training\ncenter are likely to be completed well ahead of the loan closing date.\n4. Community education and awareness program activities have progressed well. Although\nstill behind the training plan targets, a large number of training and orientation programs have been\nconducted for WUSCs, women and children groups, teachers, health post workers, and village\nmaintenance  workers.  Orientation  sessions  have  been  arranged  for  members  of  village\ndevelopment committees and district development committees. The programs have focused on\nincreasing  stakeholders\u2019  awareness  and  knowledge  of  the  benefits  of  improved  water  and\nsanitation, and their role in subproject planning, design, implementation, O&M and water use.\nExchange visits have been organized for district-level DWSS staff and WUSCs to give them\nexposure to subprojects implemented under earlier ADB assistance. Training programs have also\nbeen conducted as part of the institutional strengthening component, to reorient the staff of DWSS\nand  its  field  offices  from  implementer  to  facilitator  of  community-managed  water  supply  and\nsanitation schemes.\n5. Project management is satisfactory, with the project activities well under way and effective\ncoordination between the regional and district offices and consultants. Cumulative contract awards\nand disbursement, as of 15 August 2000, amounted to $14.26 million (77 percent of the net loan\namount) and $18.84 million (79 percent of the net loan amount), respectively.\n3.  Compliance with Project Designs\n6. The subproject selection criteria, which basically include the parameters of hardship, cost\neconomy, and community contributions, were followed during subproject selection. The procedures\nfor implementing subprojects have also been complied with in most cases. These procedures\nessentially include involvement of the community in the initial decisions to become a project\nbeneficiary, and demonstration of the community\u2019s commitment to assuming responsibility during\ndesign,  construction,  and  O&M  phases  of  the  subproject.  In  a  few  cases,  the  subproject\nprocedures  were  short-circuited  to  expedite  the  progress  of  physical  construction.  Moreover,\npolitical interference  has  been  observed  in  a  few  cases  during  subproject  site  selection  and\nimplementation, implying the need for more clearly defined criteria and procedures and a more\neffective subproject monitoring mechanism.\n7. The community education and awareness program has proved effective. The WUSCs and\ncommunities  became  well  aware  of  their  role  and  responsibilities  in  subproject  planning,\nimplementation, and O&M. The training orientation sessions helped develop the capabilities of\nWUSCs,  which,  under  the  guidance  of  DWSS,  have  undertaken  construction  work  and\nmanagement  of  water  supply  systems  on  their  own.  Overall,  the  quality  of  work  has  been\nsatisfactory. WUSCs have demonstrated a high level of project ownership as reflected in effective\nO&M of subproject facilities and the levels of community contribution. In all cases, the communities\nhave made the minimum contribution of 10 percent to the capital cost and deposits of NRs1,000\nper tap stand. The 10 percent contribution requirement was met largely through labor contributions.\nThe total amount collected has been deposited in a maintenance fund in a bank account. Doubling\nof the deposited amount per tap stand under the earlier projects provided WUSCs with improved", "37\nAppendix 4, page 3\nfinancial support. O&M activities are expected to further improve with DWSS approval of a revised\nO&M policy, which will provide for a clearer definition of procedures and O&M responsibilities of\nWUSCs.\n8. The  community  education  and  awareness  program  has  been  useful  in  raising  the\nawareness of communities in proper water use, and improved sanitation and hygiene practices.\nEven  without  Project  financing,  a  large  number  of  households  in  the  subproject  areas  have\nconstructed their own private latrines, demonstrating the effectiveness of the initial community\neducation  sessions  on  hygiene  and  sanitation.  It  was  noted  that  there  was  scope  to  further\nincrease the number of the private latrines through greater emphasis on community awareness\ntraining and orientation. Some training activities were behind schedule, and, in some cases, had\nnot been conducted in a timely manner.\n4.  Key Lessons Learned\n9. The Project was instrumental in the development of an enabling policy and legal framework.\nThe National Water Supply Policy approved in 1998 stipulates that Government agencies act as\nfacilitators rather than providers of water supply and sanitation services. The Drinking Water\nSupply  Regulations,  enacted  as  a  result  of  the  policy  dialogue  pursued  under  the  Project,\nestablished  provisions  for  the  formation,  legal  registration,  and  roles  and  responsibilities  of\nWUSCs. The regulations also spelled out the role of WUSCs in water dispute resolution.\n10. The capability of DWSS and its field offices in subproject preparation and design and in\nmanaging and interacting with beneficiary communities has substantially developed. DWSS has\nlargely  adapted  itself  to  its  new  role  of  facilitator  as  opposed  to  implementer.  Despite  the\nimpressive gains made in the transition, however, the scale of the challenge indicates the need for\nfurther reorientation of DWSS toward social processes. ADB review missions discovered that\nDWSS staff needed better recognition of the importance of social preparation at the community\nlevel. Institutional deficiencies were reflected in some subprojects: community members stated that\nDWSS lacks training programs, some WUSCs were not registered, and water user charges have\nnot yet been fixed by some WUSCs.\n11. A  major  issue  has  been  the  frequent  and  mass  transfer  of  DWSS  field-level  staff.\nDiscontinuity in the service of trained and educated staff has had adverse implications for the\nsustainability of the capacities built in DWSS over a long period. It also affected the smooth\nimplementation of the Project. While this issue is expected to be resolved by the recently amended\nCivil Service Legislation that restricts the frequent transfer of project staff, the overall need for\nfurther capacity building within DWSS and its field offices needs to be addressed. ADB review\nmissions recommended expediting the training activities and expanding the scope of the training\nprogram to adequately respond to the diverse training needs involved in the management of a\ncommunity-based project. The project monitoring capacity of DWSS was also found to be weak\nand in need of strengthening.\n12. The project efforts to enable nongovernment organizations (NGOs) to become effective\nGovernment partners in the water supply and sanitation sector have been partly successful. DWSS\nhas established the Community and NGO Mobilization Section at the national level, with links to its\nfield-level offices. This section developed a policy guideline to promote collaboration with the NGO\ncommunity, and an action plan for involving NGOs in small gravity-fed systems. However, little real\ncollaboration has taken place in the field. The experience of the Project suggests the need for\ndeveloping more enabling operational procedures within DWSS to build better linkages with NGOs\nand clear definitions in future projects of the mechanisms of partnership and the specific roles of\nNGOs in the sector.", "38\nAppendix 4, page 4\nC. Conclusions\n13. The preceding review leads to the following conclusions:\n(i)  Given the opportunity, communities can contribute significantly to the provision and\nmaintenance  of  their  water  supply  and  sanitation  services,  resulting  in  greater\nsustainability of the services.\n(ii)  Community-based approaches, however, take time to develop completely; greater\nattention to the social processes is required.\n(iii)  To ensure that benefits are fully realized and subproject facilities are sustainable,\ncommunity training and orientation need to take place during the earlier part of the\nproject even before construction activities start.\n(iv)  Efforts to build the capacity of DWSS and its field offices need to be intensified to\nenable  DWSS  to  effectively  undertake  the  components  of  a  community-based\nscheme. There is also need to further increase DWSS awareness of the importance\nof the social processes to long-term sustainability and the benefits.\n(v)  To effectively utilize the training provided to DWSS staff and to avoid disruption of\nproject activities, frequent transfer of staff should be avoided.\n(vi)  To ensure adherence by DWSS and communities to the subproject guidelines,\nsubproject selection criteria and subproject guidelines and procedures need to spell\nout in detail each stakeholder's role and responsibilities as well as implementation\nprocedures that strictly sequence the subproject activities.\n(vii)  A more effective subproject monitoring mechanism should be instituted by further\nstrengthening  the  monitoring  capacity  of  DWSS  and  developing  a  system  of\nindicators for monitoring the social processes, e.g., formation/registration of WUSCs\nand orientation of the community. ADB\u2019s supervision of the Project should also\nincorporate measures for effective monitoring of community-based processes.\n(viii)  Further  attempts  should  be  made  to  harness  the  potential  of  NGOs  in  the\nmanagement  of  community-based  water  supply  and  sanitation  schemes.  The\nmodalities of involvement and the specific roles that NGOs are to play have to be\nclearly defined in future projects to effectively use their comparative strength in\ncommunity-oriented schemes.", "39\nAppendix 5, page 1\nHEALTH AND HYGIENE EDUCATION\nA.  Rationale\n1. Sufficient quantities of clean water by itself will not reduce the incidence of water-related\ndiseases,  especially  among  children,  who  comprise  the  most  vulnerable  group.  To  obtain\nmaximum benefits from investments in water supply and sanitation improvement, it is important\nto  implement  broad-based  customer-level  training  and  education  programs  to  increase\nawareness of the critical linkage between health, hygiene, and sanitation practices. The Project\nwill implement a series of education and training activities at the institutional, school, and\nindividual family levels to encourage people to make good use of their improved water and\nsanitation facilities to enhance community, family, and individual health.\nB.  Institutional Setting\n1.  Municipalities and Village Development Committees (VDCs)\n2. Municipalities and VDCs are nominally responsible for maintaining community sanitation\nin the towns. Though these organizations in general are committed to public sanitation in their\nrespective areas, they face serious funding and manpower constraints in carrying out this\nresponsibility. The situation is compounded by lack of proper tools and equipment, training and\neducation among the staff dealing with sanitation, coordination among the sector agencies, and\npolicies to shift responsibility to user groups or private parties, and a general lack of sanitation\nawareness among the townspeople themselves.\n2.  District Health Office (DHO)\n3. DHO is supposed to assist the municipality or VDC and regularly provide annual, if\npossible biannual, health-related data and information. It cooperates in, and provides technical\nsupport  to,  the  public  awareness  programs  and  the  training  programs  designed  to  train\ncommunity  health  workers.  It  seeks  participation  of  the  local  governments  in  its  regular\nprograms. The health data and information provided by DHO will be reviewed regularly by the\nstaff of local governments to assess the level of sanitation in the town, and the impact of\nactivities carried out by the authorized agency.\n3.  District Education Office (DEO)\n4. DEO is supposed to assist the municipality or VDC by providing information about\nsanitation subjects included in the curriculum of schools. DEO also has the responsibility to\nmake teachers available for teachers' training in health and hygiene and nonformal classes in\ncommunities. Students are effective means for implementing any awareness programs. Thus it\nis also the responsibility of DEO to help in such programs organized by any organizations\nincluding nongovernment organizations (NGOs). DEO also plays an active role in organizing\nschool-level programs like quiz contests, essay and drawing competitions, cultural programs,\netc. on health and sanitation.\n4.  United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)\n5. In coordination with DWSS, UNICEF regularly conducts district-level sanitation programs\nto generate health awareness, train people in health and sanitation, construct on-site sanitation", "40\nAppendix 5, page 2\nfacilities,  run  intensive  health  and  sanitation  programs  in  schools,  and  establish  effective\nnational management information system on health and sanitation. One program conducted\njointly  by  UNICEF  and  the  Government  in  a  small  town  is  the  Digo  Vikash  program  in\nBirendranagar.  The  program  is  designed  to  generate  sanitation  awareness  among  women\nthrough saving and credit schemes.\n5.  Communities\n6. Community participation plays a vital role in the successful completion of any project and\nfor  its  sustainable  operation  and  maintenance.  In  the  sanitation  sector,  the  role  that  the\ncommunity must play is even bigger. Experiences of communities in sanitation programs have\nshown  a  direct  linkage  between  the  extent  of  community  participation  and  the  level  of\nimprovements achieved. Almost all the sample towns under the project preparatory technical\nassistance study have registered local clubs interested in participating in sanitation programs.\nThe number and type of clubs vary from town to town. Birendranagar has the highest number of\nclubs (156 clubs), while Fikkal has only 2 clubs. Women's groups are active in every town and\ncan be mobilized for awareness-generating programs, especially in the relatively poorer Tharu\ncommunities.\nC.  Health and Hygiene Education and Focused Training\n1.  Health and Hygiene Education\n7. Health and hygiene education is the most important activity to all the target groups.\nThough the government has already included health as a subject in the regular curriculum of\nschools, and UNICEF has made efforts to provide sound health education to schoolchildren,\nthere are still certain activities to be assessed. Local-level health and hygiene needs must be\nassessed because, in most cases, children learn theories but lack on-site practice. If on-site\npractice is carried out as per the need assessment at the local level, the level of knowledge the\nchildren  receive  will  be  much  higher.  This  end  will  require  the  revision  of  curriculum,\ndevelopment of appropriate educational materials, and development of appropriate skills among\nteachers.\n8. Nonformal education is another method for effective communication of basic knowledge\non health and hygiene to a specific target group like illiterate children and women's groups.\nNonformal classes will be regularly conducted in all project towns. Subjects like health and\nhygiene and food sanitation in nonformal classes will help improve the people's understanding\nof the importance of sanitation and the mechanism to maintain it.\n9. Child-to-child  and  child-to-elderly  people  programs  are  designed  for  effective\ncommunication and transfer of health and sanitation knowledge from educated children to\nilliterate children and elderly people. Children play with children and the educated group can\nrepeat the fieldwork in the form of a play, which can be easily copied by another group.\nSimilarly, children are effective means of communication with grandparents. They can perform a\nsimilar play before their grandparents.\n2.  Focused Training\n10. Training is another important activity to improve the sanitation level in any town, but the\nsubject of training and the target group will differ from town to town. Needs assessment carried", "41\nAppendix 5, page 3\nout during feasibility studies may help decide the content of training in the following subjects: (i)\ngeneration of awareness, (ii) training for health workers, (iii) training for water and sanitation\nuser committees, (iv) training for teachers, (v) solid waste management, (vi) animal waste\nmanagement, and (vii) latrine construction.\n11. The training should be given at both the institutional and target group levels and should\ninvolve a maximum of 20 participants in each training course. The institutional level comprises\n(i) municipal staff of the planning, sanitation, and community development sections; and (ii)\nvillage development committee (VDC) staff of the technical and health sections. The target\ngroup level comprises (i) members of community-based organizations (CBOs), (ii) members of\nlocal clubs, (iii) members of the water users committees, and (iv) community health workers.\nTeachers' training in health education and in nonformal education also has to be carried out by\ninvolving motivated local primary and secondary school teachers.\na.  Awareness Generation\n12. Awareness-generating  programs  will  be  organized  periodically  during  project\nimplementation  by  involving  local  club  members,  women\u2019s  groups,  members  of  CBOs,\ncommunity  workers,  students  of  primary  and  secondary  schools,  and  volunteers.  Staff  of\nmunicipalities and VDCs should also be encouraged to actively participate in these programs.\nPrograms through which awareness can be generated at the town level are mass rallies or\ncampaigns, street dramas, video shows, mass meetings involving different target groups (men's\ngroups, women's groups, children's group), quiz contests, etc. Awareness generation should\nalso be sown in schools by organizing poem competitions, essay competitions, quiz contests,\nand dramas, etc. Students with experience in the subject will be used in the awareness-\ngenerating  programs  at  the  town  level.  Media  is  another  effective  means  for  generating\nawareness,  therefore,  local  media  will  be  mobilized  for  this  purpose.  Posters  and  leaflets\npublished by the Department of Water Supply and Sewerage (DWSS) and UNICEF will also be\nintensively used. The campaign will give particular attention to marginalized groups in each\ntown.\n13. Apart  from  the  general  awareness  campaigns,  training  will  be  given  to  community\nmotivators so that they can play effective roles in generating sanitation awareness. This training\nis to be conducted among staff of municipalities and VDCs, members of clubs and CBOs, and\ncommunity workers, who will later be involved in the awareness-generating programs. The\ntrainers  will  include  community  development  specialists,  municipal  staff  of  the  Community\nDevelopment Section, and local motivators trained earlier. The training will last for six days, and\nwill  cover  these  topics:  (i)  importance  of  awareness-generating  programs,  (ii)  health  and\nhygiene, (iii) communication skills required, (iv) mobilization of communities, (v) mobilization of\nmedia, (vi) use of leaflets and pamphlets, (vii) roles and responsibilities of motivators, (viii)\nmethods of motivation, and (ix) importance of traditional and cultural values of communities.\nb. Training for Community Health Workers\n14. Community health worker training is also proposed especially for members of local\nclubs, CBOs, community workers, and volunteers, to assist the people during epidemics or in\ncases  of  widespread  diseases.  The  subjects  proposed  for  the  training  are  (i)  health  and\nsanitation, (ii) diseases that are due to poor sanitation condition, (iii) measures to prevent such\ndiseases, (iv) treatment methods, and (v) awareness generation. The trainees will be municipal\nsanitation staff, VDC health staff, community workers, local club members, members of CBOs,", "42\nAppendix 5, page 4\nand members of health organizations, etc. The resource persons might be senior staff of DHO\nand experienced members of NGOs. The training will last for five days.\nc. Training for Water User and Sanitation Committees\n15. This training will strengthen the user committee\u2019s ability to build, operate, and maintain\nsanitation facilities. It will cover health and hygiene, types of sanitation programs, importance of\nmaintaining good sanitation, participation and contribution in sanitation programs, roles and\nresponsibilities of users (including women\u2019s groups), value and collection of tariff, maintenance\nof sanitation facilities, etc. The duration of the proposed training is four days.\nd. Training for Teachers\n16. The topics to be covered include health and hygiene, diseases due to poor sanitation,\nimportance  of  keeping  schools  clean,  sanitation  programs  suitable  for  schools  and  their\nimplementation, easy sanitation techniques, communication skills, materials for communication,\netc. The duration of training will be four days. The training has the following objectives: (i)\nprovide primary school children with knowledge of health and sanitation and use them for\ngenerating  awareness  in  the  communities;  (ii)  provide  sanitation  programs  in  schools;  (iii)\nmotivate  schoolchildren  to  use  different  sanitation  measures  in  daily  life;  (iv)  create  an\nenvironment  that  encourages  teachers,  students,  guardians,  officials,  etc.  to  participate  in\ndifferent sanitation programs; and (v) strengthen the capacity of teachers to inspect different\nsanitation programs.\ne. Solid Waste Management\n17. The main objective of this training is to improve the solid waste situation in the project\ntowns by providing inhabitants with knowledge of how to reduce, reuse, and recycle the waste\nproduced  in  their  households.  The  proposed  subjects  to  be  covered  are  types  of  waste\nproduced  in  households,  degradable  and  nondegradable  materials,  method  of  separation,\ncomposting method, use of compost in gardens or fields, disposal of materials that could be\nrecycled, etc. The trainees will be municipal sanitation staff, VDC health staff, members of local\nclubs and CBOs, and members of users' committees and community workers. The resource\npersons will be experienced members of  NGOs. The duration of training will be five days.\nf. Animal Waste Management\n18. Training is necessary because most of the towns have animal waste management\nproblems. The main objective of the training in animal husbandry is to minimize the risk to\nhumans of any disease that animals get because of the circumstances under which they are\nkept.  The proposed  training  will  be  conducted  at  the  target  groups'  level  and  will  include\nsubjects like basic hygiene, types of disease that could come from animals, methods of handling\nanimal waste, etc. The proposed duration of the training is four days.", " 43\nAppendix 6\nIMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE\nTask Description 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006\nQ3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4\nA.

Benchmark Information\n1. As  stated  in  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  Handbook on Benefit Monitoring and\nEvaluation, the collection and analysis of data during the town project planning phase will\ngenerate benchmark information. Each prospective town wishing to be assisted by the Project\nwill complete an application form. During subsequent site visits, project staff will verify data on\nthis form and will fill data gaps by key informant interviews and observation. While this data is\nprimarily intended for use in selecting towns for further investigation under the Project, it will\nbecome an integral part of the data for establishing a sociotechnical profile of the project town.\n2. After a candidate town signs the Community Action Plan (CAP), the project management\noffice (PMO) will arrange for a full feasibility study of the proposed town project. Town residents,\nas owners and stakeholders of the town project, will participate fully in planning and data\ncollection. Much of the data will be collected by rapid appraisal methods using focus group\ndiscussion and key informant interviews. This will include a description of the current (before\nproject) water supply and sanitation situation. A socioeconomic survey will be administered to a\nsample  of  households  to  establish  household  size,  household  income,  age  and  gender\ninformation, and health status. The feasibility report will include a sociotechnical profile of the\nproject town. This profile will present the combined information from the project application and\nfeasibility study. The profile will be designed and organized for project monitoring and evaluation\n(M&E).\nB.  Benefit Monitoring\n3. Two levels of benefit monitoring will be established. One will be managed by the Water\nUsers and Sanitation Committees (WUSCs) as a tool to monitor and improve operation and\nmaintenance (O&M) of the facilities and as a mechanism for periodic reporting to the water\nusers associations (WUAs). The other will be managed by the district offices of the Department\nof Water Supply and Sewerage (DWSS) in coordination with district health offices to determine\n(i) the existing water supply and sanitation services, (ii) use of these services, and (iii) the\nimpact from using the services.\n1.  Monitoring by the WUSC\n4. The project consultants will assist the WUSCs to establish a system to record data and\nprocess it into monitoring information. Together with the accounting system, the recorded data\nwill allow the preparation of indicators, (examples in Table A8) and monthly monitoring reports.\nData requirements will be derived from the indicators, and record books designed for easy\nrecording.  WUSC  staff  will  be  trained  for  both  record  keeping  and  accounting  including\ntabulation, computation, and presentation in tables for easy visual evaluation of service and\nchanges in system operations over time.\n5. The WUSCs must be provided with incentives to carry out the monitoring. First, the\nsystem must be relevant to WUSCs as a tool to improve services and monitor O&M activities.\nSecond,  the  monitoring  system  as  designed  must  be  easy  to  understand  and  simple  to\nimplement. Third, monitoring activities must be included as part of the job description of the\nO&M staff. Finally, annual requests for this information by DWSS\u2019s district offices will be useful\nto prompt action if WUSC officials are negligent. Benchmark information from the project profile\nwill be entered into the record books for easy access by the persons computing the monitoring", "50\nAppendix 8, page 2\nresults. DWSS\u2019s district office staff will review the records during their periodic visits. The\nWUSCs will submit a report of the compiled monitoring results to the DWSS district office\nannually.\n2.  Monitoring by DWSS\n6. DWSS\u2019s  district  office  will  assign  staff  to  participate  in  preparing  the  town  project\ncompletion  report.  This  will  enable  DWSS  to  verify  the  extent  to  which  water  supply  and\nsanitation facilities were installed by the town project. As part of their responsibility for overall\nwater supply and sanitation services in the district, DWSS staff will periodically visit the town\nafter  town  project  completion  to  assess  the  WUSC\u2019s  O&M  activities.  In  addition  to  visual\ninspection of the physical facilities, the records will be reviewed for accuracy and to determine if\nthey are up to date. By comparing the monthly and annual WUSC monitoring information to the\nsituation  after  project  completion,  DWSS  will  determine  if  the  WUSC-managed  O&M  is\nsustainable. This monitoring can be used to identify additional training essential for improving\nthe performance of the WUSC, facilities, O&M staff, and health motivators and volunteers.\nDWSS will incorporate the WUSC\u2019s annual monitoring into its management information system\nas a permanent record that can be accessed at any time for benefit evaluation. DWSS will also\ncoordinate with district health offices for health-related monitoring.\n7. PMO and the project consultants, assisted by DWSS\u2019s district offices and the Town\nProject  Office,  will  carry  out  an  initial  study  of  the  unit  costs  of  construction  materials,\nequipment, and civil works. This study will determine competitive market prices for all major\ncomponents of civil works construction. The initial study conducted in the first year of project\nimplementation will be routinely updated by PMO every year by monitoring price changes over\ntime. The purpose of the initial study and the annual updates is to make sure that engineering\ndesign cost estimates use up-to-date costs, and that civil works contract budgets reflect these\ncosts. This will be useful in the realistic assessment of construction costs and the consequent\nrequirements for community co-financing.\nC.  Benefit Evaluation\n8. Benefit evaluation will assess actual benefits resulting from the project. The benefits will\nbe measured, at least in part, against indicators established by the benchmark information\npresented  in  the  sociotechnical  profile.  The  benefit  evaluation  will  also  examine  the\neffectiveness of the WUSCs\u2019 O&M management.", "51\nAppendix 8, page 3\nTable A8:  Monitoring Indicators and Data Requirements\nCategory Indicator Data\nWater Supply Production (m3/month)\nHouse connections Number\nHouse connection consumption (m3/month)\nStandpipes Number\nStandpipes consumption (m3/month)\nOther users Number\nOther users consumption (m3/month)\nTotal water sales (m3/month)\nWater availability (h/day)\nPopulation served by house connection Number\nPopulation served by standpipes Number\nOrganization Staff Number\nFinancial Water tariff applied NRs/ m3\nFor standpipe NRs/standpipe\nHouse connection billings NRs/month\nStandpipe billings NRs/month\nOther billings NRs/month\nTotal billings for water service NRs/month\nCollections for house connection NRs/month\nCollection for standpipe NRs/month\nCollection for others NRs/month\nTotal collections for water service NRs/month\nAccounts receivable NRs/month\nO&M Salaries/wages NRs/month\nElectricity/fuel NRs/month\nChemicals NRs/month\nOthers NRs/month\nTotal O&M cost NRs/month\nSanitation and Public Health\nPublic latrines Number\nHousehold latrines Number\nHealth motivators Number\nHealth motivators stipend/salary NRs/month\nHealth volunteer Number\nDiarrheal Morbidity for Children Under Five Incidence\nm3 = cubic meter, O&M = operation and maintenance.", "52\nAppendix 9, page 1\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION\nA.  Introduction\n1. The proposed Project is classified as environment category B as per the Guidelines for\nEnvironmental Assessment of Project Impacts  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).\nTherefore, an initial environmental examination (IEE) was carried out for each of the eight\nselected towns in the project preparatory technical assistance for the Small Towns Water\nSupply and Sanitation Sector Project in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment\nRequirements and Environmental Guidelines for Selected Infrastructure Development Projects.\nThe IEE checklist was used and potential impacts arising from subproject location, design and\nconstruction, and operation were examined and mitigation measures suggested.\nB.  Description of the Project\n2. The Project will provide sanitation facilities (latrines, storm water drainage, and limited\nsewerage with communal septic tanks) and water supply systems, gravity or tubewell, in the\nproject towns. The water supply systems will require either new construction (deep-well boring,\ntreatment plants, overhead tanks, and distribution networks) or extension of existing systems.\nC.  Description of the Environment\n1.  Geophysical Profile\n3. Of the eight selected towns for the Project, half are in the Terai, and half in the hills. The\ngeneral  climate  in  these  towns  varies  from  tropical  to  subtropical.  The  average  yearly\ntemperatures in the tropical climate varies from 180 C to 320 C and that in the subtropical\nclimate varies from 150 C to 300 C. Rains occur predominantly during the monsoon (July-\nSeptember). There are both surface and groundwater sources in the Terai. However, towns\nlocated in the hills utilize mostly surface water sources.\n2.  Ecological Profile\n4. The towns and the adjacent areas are fairly rich in flora and fauna, with several kinds of\nmammals, birds, reptiles, and fishes. Several protected areas like the Royal Bardia National\nPark and the Shukla Phanta Reserve in the western part of the country and the famous Royal\nNational Chitwan Park in the central region exist in the vicinity of the subproject areas.\n3.  Human and Economic Development\n5. The  selected  towns  have  population  varying  from  a  few  thousand  to  over  40,000.\nWaterborne and water-related diseases are the major cause of illness, especially among the\nchildren, and the water quality analysis of water samples carried out during project preparation\nindicated the presence of E coli in drinking water in most towns. Public sanitation facilities are\nlacking in most of the towns. Table A9.1 gives details on the service areas and their population.\nThe  towns  are  all  located  on  national  highways  or  roads  linking  to  such  highways,  and\nconsequently, are economically active. There are small and cottage industries in the selected\ntowns, and trade and commerce are one of the major sources of income and employment.\nHowever, because of the semi-urban nature of most of the towns, agriculture still dominates the\neconomic activities. Most towns have basic infrastructure and urban services such as water\nsupply, buses, electricity, telecommunication system, health services, banks, schools, etc.", "53\nAppendix 9, page 2\nTable A9.1:  Service Area Population of the Small Towns\nDomestic Institutions\nIndustrial Units\nNo. Name of Town HHs Pop.

The project towns are semi-urban in character, with relatively low population densities.\nThe average income level is low and has been estimated at about NRs5,000 per month per\nhousehold.  The  primary  economic  activity  of  55  percent  of  the  income-earning  adults  is\nagriculture. Commerce is the second most important primary economic activity. More than 90\npercent  of  the  households  on  all  income  strata  own  their  residence.  Urban  services  like\nelectricity, telecommunication, etc. are available to the town dwellers.\nD.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n7.

All  the  towns  have  sufficient  public  land  and  the  water  supply  systems  will  be\nconstructed  either  along  the  existing  systems  or  on  public  land.  River  catchments  or\ngroundwater will be the sources of water for the systems. A number of public toilets will be\nconstructed at critical places like bus parks, schools, and markets. A limited number of small-\nbore sewerage facilities with communal septic tanks will be built in towns with densely populated\ncore areas that do not permit the use of single-family latrines. Basic storm water drainage will\nalso be constructed in the core areas to supplement the existing drainage.\nb.  Design Aspects\n9. Water supply at the desired service level with adequate pressure and quantity will be\nprovided through simple water treatment or disinfection facilities, as required. Systems will\ninclude  transmission  pipelines,  storage  tanks,  and  distribution  systems  with  household\nconnections (fully plumbed or yard taps) and a limited number of community taps.\nc.  Construction Stage\n10. No unusual or significant environmental problems are anticipated during construction of\nthe water supply systems, drains, and public toilets. Excavation for pipelines and drain trenches\nwill cause some disruption of traffic, and may cause soil erosion and silt runoff. These works will\nbe undertaken primarily in the dry season and with proper monitoring.\nd.  Operations Stage\n11. Adequate water quality testing will be undertaken at the treatment plants and throughout\nthe distribution system for the provision of safe water supply. Regular training and maintenance\nis necessary to achieve full environmental benefit from the water supply component. The Project\nprovides for training of operators and water testing equipment.\ne.  Critical Overall Environmental Review\n12. The planned water supply and sanitation project for the project towns is expected to\nhave  very  small  environmental  impacts  which  can  easily  be  managed  through  adequate\nmitigation measures and regular monitoring during the design, construction, and operation\nphases. The Project will significantly improve personal, household, and community hygiene and\nenvironmental sanitation, thereby enhancing the quality of life and community health.\n2.  Health and Hygiene Education\na.  Design Aspects\n13. Private household latrines will also be promoted. A health education program will be\nimplemented in all participating towns. This program has been designed with the intention of\nincreasing customer awareness of (i) the important causal linkage between using improved\nsanitation facilities and family and individual health; (ii) the importance of improved personal\nhygiene behavior to improving health; and (iii) the provision for families to choose between", "55\nAppendix 9, page 4\nsingle-family  ventilated  improved  pit  latrines  or  pour-flush  latrines  with  septic  tanks.\nCommunities will participate extensively in these programs to enhance their knowledge and\nimprove their behavior and practice to fully benefit from the improved water and sanitation\nfacilities.  No  unusual  or  significant  environmental  problems  are  anticipated  during  the\nimplementation of this component.\nb.  Critical Overall Environmental Review\n14. The community members will take full responsibility for operation and maintenance\n(O&M) of their private toilet facilities. The program will significantly reduce the environmental\ndamage caused by the inappropriate disposal of human waste in the towns, and improve\npersonal hygiene and sanitation in the community.\nE.  Environmental Monitoring and Institutional Requirement\n15. The Project Management Office and the consultant will be responsible for ensuring that\nenvironmental monitoring is designed and incorporated in civil works contracts, with specific\nmitigation measures. The Town Project Office will ensure that the mitigation measures are\ncarried out by the contractors. Regular monitoring of the actual environmental impacts during\nproject operations will be included in the monitoring and evaluation activities of the Department\nof Water Supply and Sewerage (DWSS) and the Sanitation Subsection Unit in each regional\noffice of DWSS.\nF.  Findings and Recommendations\n16. The Project will significantly improve personal, household, and community hygiene and\nenvironmental sanitation, thereby improving the quality of life and community health. The minor\nenvironmental impact arising from the constructions can be easily managed.\nG.  Conclusions\n17. The Project will have no significant adverse environmental impact, but will result in\nnumerous  environmental  improvements.  An  environmental  impact  assessment  is  not\nconsidered necessary.", "56\nAppendix 9, page 5\nTable A9.3:  Potential Environmental Impact and Protection Measures\nAction Damage to Protection Measures Environmental\nEnvironment Effect\nA.

Introduction\n1. The summary of the Project's social dimensions is based on the socioeconomic surveys,\nstakeholder workshops, and public awareness campaigns (PAC) conducted in the eight sample\ntowns  during  the  technical  assistance  study.  The  socioeconomic  surveys  covered  714\nhouseholds chosen at random. The surveys were supported by a PAC involving participatory\nappraisal techniques. A series of meetings and focused group discussions were held with\nvarious stakeholders, including the elected and appointed local officials, water user committees,\nwomen's groups, and the disadvantaged and the poor communities in the eight towns. These\nactivities provided the data for the analysis and assessment of the socioeconomic profile of the\nproject area, community willingness to participate in the planned project, and the potential\nimpact of the Project on specific groups that were used as a basis in the design and feasibility\nanalysis of the Project.\nB. Community Profile\n1.  Demography\n2. The project area comprises 40-50 small towns across the country with a total population\nof about 600,000. The populations of the towns range from 3,000 to 40,000. Most of the towns\nare strategically located on the east-west highways, or along the north-south feeder roads\nconnecting the east-west highway, and are experiencing rapid growth due to the expansion of\nthe national highway network, the development of market centers, and rural to urban migration.\nThe rural-urban migration, particularly from the hills to the southern plains of the Terai, is an\nincreasing phenomenon contributing to relatively modest population growth in many hill towns\nand a high to very high growth rate in towns in the Terai.\n3. The survey of the eight pilot towns indicates that, ethnically, more than half of the\nsample households are Brahmin, Chhetri, or members of an occupational caste having an\nimportant presence in the towns of the survey. Small numbers of Newars and Tharus together\nrepresent about the same number of people as do the occupational castes. About 20 percent of\nRai and occupational caste households are among the lower income households.  On the other\nhand, over a fifth of Chhetri, Gurung, and Newar households rank among the higher income\ngroups.\n4. Average household size is 5.6 resident persons, ranging from a high of 6.9 to a low of\n5.1 in the 714-household sample. The median age is just over 19 years for males and about 20\nfor  females.    This  is  approximately  a  year  higher  than  the  national  population  figures  as\nregistered in the census of 1991. The male-female ratio of the survey population is 0.997. The\nupper income stratum has the lowest male-to-female ratio.\n2.  Employment Pattern\n5. The random sampling included households across the income spectrum where the lower\nincome stratum is defined as monthly household income less than NRs2,500, middle income as\nNRs2,501-10,000, and higher income as more than NRs10,000. Agriculture, commerce, and\nmanual labor together comprise three quarters of the primary economic activities of the sample\npopulation  while  the  remaining  quarter  of  the  population  is  engaged  in  a  variety  of  other\nactivities.  The  primary  economic  activity  of  55  percent  of  the  income-earning  adults  is\nagriculture. Commerce that is biased toward the upper- and middle-income strata is the second", "59\nAppendix 10, page 2\nmost important primary economic activity involving about one eighth of the respondents. Manual\nlabor on a day-hire basis is the third most common source of employment for respondents,\nparticularly  for  poor  households  where  23.5  percent  of  income-earning  members  work  as\nmanual laborers.\n3. Education, Hygiene and Sanitation Behavior, and Health Conditions\n6. About 10.5 percent of the sample population are of preschool age. Of the remaining\npopulation, 57.4 percent have been to school. Of those with school experience, about 58\npercent are male and 42 percent are female. The survey results indicate that the lower the\nincome stratum, the lower the proportion of the population that has attended school. The\naverage number of school years for the poor households is also lower than that for the upper\nincome groups.\n7. The results indicate a generally low-level awareness of hygiene and sanitation among\nthe sample households. About 73 percent of the total respondents do not treat their water in any\nway before drinking. There is also a correlation between the hygiene awareness/practices and\nincome level. Hygiene awareness and frequency of practices are lower among lower income\ngroups. About 16 percent of upper income households filter their drinking water, while the\npercentage of the poor households doing so is less than 2 percent. Among the upper income\nhouseholds,  82  percent  have  adopted  the  practice  of  washing  hands  after  going  to  toilet\ncompared with only 56 percent in the poor households. Among upper income households, 43\npercent of adults bathe daily, which is twice the percentage for the poor households.\n8. Diarrhea and dysentery are the most common diseases in all the pilot towns, but no\nepidemic or other widespread diseases have been recorded in any of the towns. The other\ncommon illnesses are skin itching, cough, and malnutrition. Poor sanitary conditions, and water\nquality, and lack of hygiene awareness are responsible for the poor health conditions in the\nsubproject towns.\n4. Access to Safe Water and Sanitation\n9. Overall, 52 percent of the households have access to piped water. Piped water supply\ndelivery systems are generally unreliable. Two thirds of the households claim that water through\nthe piped system is available only a few hours per day. Over half of the households in the\nsample have a water supply system on their property. The proportion of the upper income\nhouseholds with water is significantly higher than that of the middle and lower income strata.\nHouseholds that do not have a water source on the premises must fetch water from outside. In\nthose cases, an average of 1.7 members per household have water-carrying responsibilities.\nThe average walking times to get drinking water in the monsoon and dry seasons are 5 and 8\nminutes, respectively. The average length of the wait, which varies between 19 and 26 minutes\ndepending on the season, is significantly longer than the time spent in walking to the water\nsource. The average household makes 4.4 trips during monsoon season and 5 in dry season.\n10. Overall, about two thirds of sample households are served by some form of sanitation\nfacilities. The survey indicates a general pattern of declining sanitation facility coverage with\ndescending income stratum. The most widespread sanitation technology in use is the pour flush\nwith water seal, which is used by 40 percent of the households with on-site facilities. A further\n25 percent of households with on-site sanitation facilities have a dug hole, and 20 percent have\na pit latrine.  The remainder simply use nearby fields or riverbanks.", "60\nAppendix 10, page 3\n11. Nearly 80 percent of the households in the sample indicate a priority for improved water\nsupply. Sanitation is ranked as third priority by about 20 percent. The most preferred water\nsupply improvement system is yard taps, followed by public stand-posts. About 10 percent of\nthe sample households preferred an indoor tap.\nC. Willingness to Pay for Services and Response to Affordability\n12. Discussions during the public awareness campaign in the sample towns revealed that all\nstakeholders are willing to contribute to capital cost recovery but do not categorically agree to\nfinancing a percentage of the project cost without knowing the magnitude of the cost. The\nsurvey shows willingness to pay for water tariffs ranging between NRs100 and NRs250 per\nmonth,  lower  than  that  expressed  during  the  PAC.  Willingness  to  contribute  labor  toward\nconstruction of facilities seems to be much higher \u2013 overall, 86 percent of the respondents are\nwilling to contribute labor.  Willingness to contribute is not a function of income stratum, but is\nrelated to the interest of households to improve their water and sanitation facilities.\n13.  Tariff structures in the Project were designed considering the acceptable affordability\nlevels  to  household.  The  proposed  domestic  tariffs  include  two  blocks  for  an  effective\nprogressive tariff structure. This allows average levels of consumption within the recommended\nsocial objective: affordability and willingness-to-pay criteria of 3-5 percent of average household\nincome. The initial tariff block is designed as a lifeline block to give poor households access to a\nminimum level of water supply to meet basic needs at a price that they can afford. The structure\nof tariffs, the customer categories, and the tariff blocks within a category will be decided by\ndiscussing with the communities and their representative water user committees.\nD. Project Impact on Poverty\n14. Precise estimates of the incidence of poverty in Nepal as elsewhere vary depending on\nthe methodology used. Recent research has derived a poverty threshold based on an annual\nincome of NRs4,404 per capita for Nepal, which has been considered sufficient to provide a\nminimum caloric intake and cover essential nonfood expenses. By this definition, the people\nliving below the poverty line accounted for 42 percent in the country, 44 percent in the rural\nareas, 34 percent in urban areas other than Kathmandu, and 4 percent in Kathmandu. Since\nmost of the small towns are essentially in the rural areas as defined in the study, the ratio of the\npoor to the total population in the small towns is estimated at 34-42 percent.  This definition of\npoverty, however, needs to be treated with caution as it does not capture other dimensions of\npoverty such lack of access to basic services, poor environmental conditions, deprivation of\nvoices in the development process, etc.\n15. Poverty incidence based on the indicators of multidimensions of poverty is considered to\nbe much beyond the figure based on only income indicators of poverty among the sample\nhouseholds. Of the households in the sample, 48 percent do not have water available on the\npremises.  These  households  spend  between  2  and  2.5  hours  per  day,  depending  on  the\nseason,  to  keep  the  household  supplied  with  water.  Carrying  water  is  a  strenuous  task;\nmoreover, the time required to collect water is usually spent at the expense of other basic\neconomic and social necessities such as school attendance and earning income. In addition to\nunavailability of water, lack of safe water is another factor that indicates the incidence of poverty\namong sample households. Lack of safe water poses a serious health hazard especially in\nmonsoon season when rainfall runoff sweeps debris into water reservoirs. The survey indicated\n78 percent of households dissatisfied with the quality of water and blaming the polluted water for\ntheir  illnesses.  The  health  problems  associated  with  inadequate  and  safe  water  are", "61\nAppendix 10, page 4\ncompounded by the relatively low coverage of sanitation facilities and low level of hygiene\nawareness perpetuating poverty.\n16. Improved access to safe water under the Project will greatly benefit the poor whose\nattempts to improve their status and health are continually impeded by the need to divert time\nand energy to acquire their daily water needs. Increasing the reliability, quality, and quantity of\nwater on or near the household premises will have a decidedly positive impact on the poor\nhouseholds\u2019 water use patterns. With more convenient access to larger quantities of quality\nwater,  combined  with  hygiene  awareness  education,  the  hygiene  practices  of  the  poor\nhouseholds  will  improve  with  resulting  health  improvements  within  the  poor  communities.\nSimilarly, a convenient and hygienic disposal of human waste will significantly benefit the poor\nin  terms  of  improved  individual,  family,  and  community  health.  The  implementation  of  a\nsuccessful public health and hygiene education program will reinforce the health benefits of the\nimproved water supply and sanitation services. Improved health will result in greater economic\ngains for the poor in the form of enhanced work productivity, reduced number of work or school\ndays  lost  due  to  sickness,  reduced  household  expenditure  on  medical  care,  and  reduced\ndemand for public health services. School attendance and employment rates are expected to\nsignificantly increase.\n17. The  Project  incorporates  a  number  of  social  measures  to  ensure  the  intended\ndevelopmental impact on the poor communities. These include (i) establishment of water supply\ntariffs based on a progressive block rate structure with a lifeline block designed to cater to the\npoorer  households,    (ii)  enabling  households  to  contribute  labor  instead  of  cash  to  the\nconstruction of facilities, (iii) extensive use of participatory processes, (iv) a series of targeted\ncommunity training activities including a training program for health education and awareness,\nand (iv) a community-based approach that empowers communities and the poor to plan and\nmanage their water and sanitation systems.\nE. Project Impact on Gender Issues\n18. The 50.1 percent female in the sample population reflects the female ratio of the Nepali\nnational population. The survey identified 12 percent of households headed by single females.\nThe percentage of households with female heads is higher among poor households than in the\nother income groups. The survey indicates a general pattern of females spending fewer years in\nschool than males. There is also a general pattern of lower average school years the lower the\nhousehold income stratum for both males and females. The mothers in 92 percent of sample\nhouseholds are responsible for the hygiene education of children regardless of income stratum.\n19. Female participation in water carrying is very high. Females represent 84 percent of the\nwater carriers in households that do not have water on the premises. Their participation in water\ncarrying peaks between ages 15 and 39 when they make up about half the water-carrying force\noverall. The average female with water-carrying responsibilities makes more trips per day than\nher male counterpart. To keep the household supplied, each female water carrier must earmark\n1 hour and 20 minutes per day, during monsoon season and an average of 2.3 hours per day in\ndry season.\n20. Females are expected to disproportionately benefit from a project to improve water\nsupply and sanitation facilities. The provision of safe and adequate water will not only improve\nthe health of women and children, but will help women and girls to avoid the backbreaking task\nof carrying water over long distances and time. The release of females to whatever degree from\nthe burden of carrying water will have a positive impact on several areas of social life. School", "62\nAppendix 10, page 5\nattendance and literacy rates and income-earning opportunities for female are expected to\nsignificantly rise.\n21. Public health and hygiene education program with special emphasis on and targeting of\nwomen will have multiplier effects on benefits to the society where the mothers have the main\nresponsibility for managing the household and the hygiene education of children. Women's\nrepresentation in water user committees will ensure active and effective involvement of women\nin the planning and management of domestic water supply and sanitation. This meaningful\nparticipation will improve their status and bridge the gender gap in Nepali society while greatly\nfavoring the sustainability of water and sanitation systems of which women are the predominant\nmanagers and users.\nF. Participatory Process and Empowerment of the Community\n22. Project  preparation  used  a  participatory  approach.  The  PAC  ensured  informed\nparticipation of all stakeholders in project design. The campaign proved to be an effective\nmeans  in  determining  the  community  needs  and  aspirations  and  providing  considerable\ninformation for a community-based approach adopted by the Project.\n23. The participatory approach will be continued during subproject (town project) feasibility\nstudies, the detailed designs, implementation, and operation and maintenance (O&M). More\nimportantly,  the  Project  will  empower  the  communities,  including  the  poor,  to  take  full\nresponsibility in managing their water supply and sanitation facilities. Water users and sanitation\ncommittees (WUSCs) will be formed with members elected by the entire community in each\ntown. Through WUSCs, the communities will have a pivotal role in both decision making as well\nas implementation and postimplementation activities of the Project. The community will be fully\ninvolved in planning, design, and construction of the facilities. They will be allowed to contribute\nlabor to the construction and decide on the amount of cofinancing for construction. Communities\nwill  also  establish  the  appropriate  water  tariff  structures  and  collect  water  tariffs  from  the\nconsumers. The O&M of the water and sanitation facilities, will be the full responsibility of the\ncommunity.\n24. The Project provides various organizational, procedural, and instrumental measures to\nensure that the potential of the communities to successfully implement the community-based\nwater supply and sanitation scheme is harnessed. The measures include (i) conduct of PAC in\ncandidate  towns  to  present  the  Project;  (ii)  signing  by  the  community  of  an  action\nplan/preliminary agreement outlining the roles, rights, and responsibilities of the parties and\nprocedures to follow in providing services; (iii) a subproject (town project) agreement firming up\nthe commitment by the community and other parties; and (iv) establishment of town project\noffices to support WUSCs in the design and construction of the facilities. The Project also\nincludes  a  substantial  community-focused  training  program  targeting  WUSCs,  specific\ncommunity groups, e.g., women and the poor, and the broader public. The Project is essentially\ndesigned to build the capacity of WUSCs and the community groups in performing their roles\nand responsibilities in a community-driven Project, and to raise the public awareness of health\nand sanitation issues.", "63\nAppendix 11, page 1\nECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSES OF SUBPROJECTS\nA.  Introduction\n1. Economic  and  financial  analyses  of  eight  sample  subprojects  were  carried  out  in\naccordance with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB's) Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of\nProjects, Handbook for the Economic Analysis of Water Supply Projects, and Guidelines for\nPreparation and Presentation of Financial Analysis. The analyses included least-cost analysis of\nalternative  water  supply  development  options,  where  applicable;  calculation  of  the  average\nincremental financial cost (AIFC) and average incremental economic cost (AIEC) per cubic meter\nof water sold; comparison of AIFC and AIEC with the proposed average tariff to assess subsidies;\ncalculation of the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) and financial internal rate of return\n(FIRR) for each subproject as well as the combined EIRR and FIRR for all eight subprojects;\ndetermination of a possible tariff structure based on affordability and willingness to pay; and\nfinancial projections to determine the financial sustainability of the water user and sanitation\ncommittees (WUSCs).\nB.  Assumptions\n2. The assumptions in the financial and economic analyses are as follows. The capital and\noperation and maintenance (O&M) costs are based on the least-cost subprojects that meet\ndesign capacity requirements in the planning period of 15 years. A capital allowance equivalent\nto 10 percent of the total capital costs is made every 10 years to cover the cost of replacement of\npumping and other equipment, in addition to ordinary O&M expenditures. In the case of gravity\nschemes, an allowance of 2 percent is provided every 10 years for capital replacement, water\nmeters are assumed to be replaced every 7 years. A residual value equivalent to 50 percent of\nproject capital costs is assumed in year 20 to take account of the remaining economic life of civil\nworks and pipelines, which have an assumed economic life of 40 years. The major O&M costs for\neach  subproject  are  based  on  water  system  characteristics  and  include  (i)  operation,  (ii)\npersonnel, (iii) power, and (iv) maintenance.\n3. The capital and operating cost streams in the financial analysis are those used in the\neconomic analysis plus taxes and duties paid by WUSC on capital inputs and operating costs.\nThe  financial  benefit streams are  revenues  from  water  sales  to  domestic,  commercial,  and\ninstitutional customers. Calculation of the revenues is based on the proposed WUSC tariffs in\neach sample town. The tariffs were discussed and agreed upon at the stakeholders meeting in\nNovember 1999. The projected water sales vary according to connection types: 100 lpcd for\nprivate indoor connections; 65 lpcd for private yard connections and residential schools; 45 lpcd\nfor community taps; 10 lpcd for nonresidential schools; 500 liters per bed per day for hospitals\nand clinics, and 750 liters per day for institutions. Each community tap is assumed to serve five\nhouseholds. Except for households with private indoor taps, all other residential user groups are\nexpected to consume within the lifeline block (10 cubic meter [m3] per month). An allowance of 5\npercent for bad debts is assumed, implying a collection efficiency of 95 percent.\n4. In  quantifying  project  costs  for  economic  analysis,  financial  prices  were  adjusted  to\neconomic prices, removing duties and taxes, and applying a standard conversion factor (SCF) of\n0.90 to nontradable inputs and a shadow wage rate factor of 0.70 for unskilled labor to adjust for\nunderemployment in the country. Foreign exchange costs were converted at NRs68.5 per $1.0.\nAll cost estimates are expressed in constant November 1999 prices. The quantifiable benefits of\nthe  subprojects  include  both  the  incremental  and  non-incremental  benefits.  Nonincremental\nbenefits arise from the resource cost savings of customers switching from other sources to the", "64\nAppendix 11, page 2\nnew  water  supply  system,  plus  the  nontechnical  loss  of  the  unaccounted  for  water  (UFW)\navailable  to  users  as  a  result  of  the  project.  Incremental  benefits  from  additional  water\nconsumption under the project will include the following: (i) additional consumption to meet\nsuppressed or increased demand from existing customers; (ii) additional consumption by new\ndomestic customers; (iii) suppressed demand or increases in demand from commercial and\ninstitutional customers; and (iv) incremental non-technical loss of UFW resulting from the Project.\nC.  Demand Analysis\n5. The  socioeconomic  survey  showed  48  percent  of  households  did  not  have  water\nconnections and had to carry water from other sources. Consequently, consumption was very low\n\u2014less than 70 liters per household per day, or roughly 12.5 lpcd. Of households with piped water\nconnections, only 15 percent had a regular supply, most only getting water for a few hours per\nday. Most households cited the unavailability of water in the existing systems as the reason not to\nhave a house connection. The suppressed demand is therefore very high and lack of water\ncontributes to hardships as well as health concerns.\n6. Demand projections averaged 100 lpcd for private indoor connections, 65 lpcd for private\nyard connections and residential schools, 45 lpcd for community taps, 10 lpcd for nonresidential\nschools, 500 liters per bed per day for hospitals and clinics, and 750 liters per day for institutions.\nThe figures are based on Department of Water Supply and Sewerage (DWSS) guidelines and\ndiscussions with local communities. Annual population growth rates in the subproject towns\nderived from the district profiles range from 1.8 percent to 4.9 percent with an average of 3.3\npercent. It is difficult to determine the impact of the increased tariffs on future demand and\nconsumption patterns as there are very few WUSCs with experience in charging for water, and\ndata for DWSS systems are based on a very low national tariffs.\nD.  Economic Benefits\n7. Economic  benefits  will  arise  from  improved  health  and  sanitation  as  well  as  major\nimprovement to the quality of life through reduction of time in collecting water (a burden that falls\nheavily on women and children) and the increased economic development opportunities resulting\nfrom  infrastructure  improvements  in  the  small  towns.  As  economic  development  and  health\nbenefits are not readily quantifiable, the calculation of economic returns significantly understates\nthe full value of the projects to the economy.\n8. Quantifiable benefits of the sample subprojects were estimated following ADB guidelines.\nThey include benefits of incremental water consumption arising from additional sales to meet the\nsuppressed  and  increasing  demand  from  existing  water  users,  new  domestic  demands,\nsuppressed and new demand from the commercial and industry sectors in the small towns, and\nconsumption  of  UFW  from  additional  water  supplies.  They  also  include  benefits  of  non-\nincremental water consumption as reflected in resource cost savings for customers who will\nswitch from preproject unsafe sources to the water supply systems of the Project.\n9. The major resource cost saving will arise from the reduced time in collecting the daily\nrequired water, as determined for each town in the socioeconomic survey: from a low of 0.86 hour\nper day (Parsa) to as much as 7.0 hours per day in Fikkal, with an average of 2.3 hours. This was\nquantified using an opportunity cost of unskilled labor assessed at an average of about NRs60\nper  day,  converted  to  economic  prices  at  the  shadow  wage  rate  factor  of  0.7.  While  it  is\nimpossible to assume that all the time saved could be income generating, alternative productive\nbenefits could be assumed, such as increased opportunities for school attendance, particularly for", "65\nAppendix 11, page 3\nfemale children.1 No benefit was quantified for potential time savings in bathing, as the low-\nincome customers without water supply connections are likely to continue to use the existing\nsources.\n10. Incremental  benefits  were  calculated  for  increased  consumption  from  suppressed\ndemand, estimated as the difference between current consumption and household demand with\nwater  supply  connections,  valued  at  the  levels  of  willingness  to  pay  determined  in  the\nsocioeconomic survey, a proxy for the average demand price. The economic benefit of non-\nrevenue water consumed, but not paid for, is estimated as 5 percent of total water requirements\nfor each system, valued at the weighted average of incremental and nonincremental benefits. The\nfourth measure of quantified benefits is the value of contributions users are prepared to pay for\nconstruction costs. This constitutes part of their willingness to pay for an improved water system \u2013\nin addition to willingness to pay higher tariffs \u2013 for the utility of improved levels of service including\nthe convenience of house connections.\n11. Unquantifiable benefits will accrue from the economic development of towns fostered by\nimproved infrastructure. They would include not only increased real estate values, but also\nimproved likelihood of increased commerce and industrial activities, and development of such\ninstitutions as schools and hospitals, which require secure water supplies. Although not possible\nto measure, significant health benefits will arise, particularly in conjunction with the Project\u2019s\ncomplementary programs of health and hygiene education. The socioeconomic survey showed\nthat, for households having to fetch water, average daily household consumption of water was\nonly 60.6 to 70.0 liters (seasonally), or an equivalent of 10.7-12.5 lpcd for the average household\nof 5.6 members. Studies have found direct relationships between levels of water consumption\nand hygiene and morbidity and mortality. Increased availability of a convenient water supply,\nalong with the proposed health and hygiene education, will reduce the health risks associated\nwith such a practice as washing dishes adjacent to unsanitary storm drains or in poorly drained\noutdoor areas.\n12. Related to household water storage costs will be savings in expenditure on supplementary\nwater  storage  systems  and  pumping  that  will  be  reduced  or  eliminated  with  reliable  piped\nsupplies. Water resource conservation benefits will be achieved through charging cost-based\ntariffs. The demand management will lead to reduction in water wastage common when water is\nprovided free. Recent studies by DWSS confirm the fact that most water quality problems result\nfrom recontamination during and beyond distribution, instead of the water source or point of\ntreatment.  Improved  distribution  networks,  continuity  of  supply,  and  increased  numbers  of\nconnections  will  reduce  the  likelihood  of  recontamination  from  unclean  containers  used  for\nfetching and storing water necessitated by intermittent and unreliable water service. Unquantified\nhealth benefits will also arise from improved sanitation through construction of public sanitation\nfacilities, private latrines, and drains. These will have positive sanitation impacts, particularly in\nmonsoon season.\nE.  Economic Evaluation of Sample Subprojects\n1. Economic Evaluation and Sensitivity Analysis\n13. The weighted average EIRR for the eight subprojects is estimated at 17.2 percent \u2013\nincluding related soft costs of training and education (excluding project management) \u2013 and well\nexceeds the opportunity cost of capital assumed at 12 percent. A summary of the results, by\n                                                \n1  The socioeconomic survey results indicated 84 percent of the burden of fetching water is carried by females, and a\nlower ratio of female children than male attend school and for fewer years.", "66\nAppendix 11, page 4\nsubproject, is shown in Table A11.1. The EIRRs for the sample subprojects range from 15.6\npercent in Attariya to 36 percent in Fikkal, all higher than the 12 percent threshold. The EIRRs will\nbe higher if nonquantified health benefits of the project are considered. The high EIRR of Fikkal\nresults from high resource cost savings as the average household is currently spending over 7.0\nhours per day to collect water.\nTable A11.1:  Economic Evaluation and Sensitivity Analysis\nEIRR (%) NPV (NRs million)\nProject Town AIEC Base +10% -10% Combined Base +10% -10% Combined\nCase Costs Benefits Cases 1+2 Case Costs Benefits Cases 1 & 2\n(1) (2) (1) (2)\nAttariya 26.5 15.6 13.9 13.7 12.0 11.0 6.1 5.0 0.1\nBandipur 22.9 16.1 14.2 14.0 12.3 2.3 1.4 1.1 0.2\nBirendranagar 19.5 16.1 14.6 14.4 13.0 46.5 31.4 26.8 11.7\nFikkal 28.1 36.0 32.7 32.3 29.3 15.3 14.3 12.8 11.9\nGaighat 30.6 16.2 14.6 14.5 13.0 28.3 19.1 16.2 7.0\nLekhnath 31.4 17.4 15.8 15.6 14.1 42.7 32.2 27.9 17.4\nParsa 20.0 17.5 15.4 15.2 13.3 10.1 6.9 5.9 2.6\nRatna Nagar 21.5 19.1 17.0 16.8 14.8 40.1 30.3 26.3 16.4\nAverage 25.1 17.2 15.5 16.9 15.0 196.3 141.6 166.8 112.2\nAIEC = average incremental economic cost, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present\nvalue.\n14. Sensitivity analysis, conducted for a 10 percent increase in capital and operating costs\nand 10 percent reduction in subproject benefits, is summarized in Table A11.1. It is noted that\neven in the worst case scenario, which combines a 10 percent decrease in benefits and 10\npercent increase in costs, all subprojects are still viable with EIRRs above 12.0 percent except for\nAttariya with an EIRR of just 12 percent. The EIRRs of the subprojects are most sensitive to a\ndecline in project benefits. However, they are robust and the subprojects are economically viable\neven in the combined worst case scenario.\n2. Average Incremental Financial and Economic Costs\n15. The  AIFCs  and  AIECs  for  the  eight  subprojects  were  calculated  to  determine  the\nsubsidies needed to achieve full cost recovery, based on a proposed affordable tariff for each\nscheme, as summarized in the Table A11.2. Both AIFCs and AIECs were based on a 12 percent\nrate of discount, applied to a 20-year projection of the costs and benefits, expressed in financial\nand economic prices, respectively.\n16. The difference between the average incremental cost (AIC) per m3 and the tariff provides\na measure of the subsidy to the beneficiaries per cubic meter of water consumed. The average\neconomic subsidy is NRs10.4 per m3, or 81 percent of the assumed tariff that would be charged,\nand the financial subsidy is NRs15 per m3, or 111 percent of the assumed tariff. However, this\ndoes not account for the fact that the users are themselves contributing 20 percent of the capital\ncosts at the outset of the project. When the AIC is adjusted for this, the actual financial subsidy is\nsignificantly lower, averaging NRs5.9 per m3 (bottom row in Table A11.2). Similarly the true\neconomic subsidy would be significantly lower than indicated. The economic subsidy is justifiable\nas, even without quantification of all the economic benefits, the high economic rates of return for\nthe projects demonstrate that the total economic benefits far exceed the economic costs.", "67\nAppendix 11, page 5\n17. For the financial subsidy, four factors must be considered. First, the poor will receive\nsubsidization through lifeline tariff and public standpipes that cannot yet be fully cross-subsidized\nby the other users to achieve full cost recovery on average. Second, as the Government has\ntraditionally heavily subsidized the water supply, with users paying a fraction of even the basic\noperating  costs,  the  Project  achieves  a  major  shift  toward  full  cost  recovery.  Third,  the\nsubprojects essentially will be financially self-sustaining, paying all O&M costs, debt services,\nreplacement  of  major  assets,  and  accumulating  surpluses  for  system  expansions  or  capital\nreplacement reserves at the end of the projection period, reducing or even eliminating the need\nfor further Government subsidies in the future. Fourth, discussions with local governments show\nthat they are willing to pay much higher tariffs if the ownership of the water systems is transferred\nto them.\nTable A11.2:  AICs and Subsidies\n(NRs/m3)\nCombined\nItem AttariyaBirendranagarFikkalGaighat Lekhnath Parsa RatnanagarBandipur Projects\nAIEC 26.5 19.5 28.1 30.6 31.4 20.0 21.5 22.9 23.2\nAIFC 28.5 23.2 41.4 32.0 39.2 25.7 26.1 26.9 27.8\nAIFC Net of User\nContributions 25.2 19.9 36.2 24.2 33.1 22.8 23.0 23.4 20.1\nAverage Tariff 15.6 9.5 18.3 12.9 14.4 14.9 14.8 14.0 14.2\nEconomic Subsidy 10.9 10.0 9.8 17.7 17.0 5.1 6.7 8.9 10.4\nFinancial Subsidy 12.9 13.7 23.0 19.1 24.8 10.8 11.3 12.9 15.0\nFinancial Subsidy Net of\nUser Contributions 9.6 10.4 17.9 11.3 18.7 7.9 8.2 9.4 5.9\nAIC = average incremental cost, AIFC = average incremental financial cost, m3 = cubic meter.\n3.  Financial Evaluation of Subprojects\n18. Using  the  preceding  assumptions,  the  FIRRs  of  the  sample  subprojects  and  their\nsensitivity toward adverse changes were calculated. The sensitivity analysis was conducted for a\n10  percent  increase  in  construction  and  operating  costs,  a  10  percent  reduction  in  project\nbenefits, and a combination of the two adverse changes. The resultant FIRRs and sensitivity\nanalysis, summarized in Table A11.3, indicate the project is most sensitive to a decline in water\nsales. The relatively high sensitivity of revenues highlights the need to ensure tariff collections.\nTable A11.3:  FIRRs and Sensitivity Analysis\nFIRR (%)\nProject Town AIFC Base +10% in -10% in Combined Cases\n(NRs/m3) Case Costs Benefits 1 & 2\n(1) (2)\nAttariya 28.5 2.9 1.3 1.1 -0.4\nBandipur 26.9 2.4 1.3 1.1 0.1\nBirendranagar 23.2 3.3 2.3 2.2 1.2\nFikkal 41.4 2.8 1.7 1.6 0.7\nGaighat 32.0 2.8 1.8 1.7 0.7\nLekhnath 39.2 2.9 2.0 1.9 1.1\nParsa 25.7 2.7 1.1 1.0 -0.5\nRatna Nagar 26.1 2.6 2.6 1.0 0.8\nAverage 30.4 2.8 1.7 1.4 0.5\nAIFC = average incremental financial cost, FIRR = financial internal rate of return, m3 = cubic meter.", "68\nAppendix 11, page 6\n4. Financial Sustainability of WUSCs\n19. The financial sustainability of the WUSCs is premised on tariffs sufficient to maintain a\npositive  cash  flow  while  meeting  all  costs  of  O&M,  debt  servicing,  capital  expenditure  for\ndistribution system expansion within the current design capacity (15 years), and major scheduled\ncapital  replacements  within  the  projection  period.  It  also  assumes  that  WUSCs  will  not  be\nrequired to pay taxes on their activities. Further objectives include maintenance of a debt-service\nratio of at least 1.1 (net income before interest divided by interest plus principal repayments), an\naverage self-financing ratio of at least 15 percent, and accounts receivable not exceeding 90\ndays of sales revenue.\n20. Financial projections for each system demonstrated that the WUSCs would be financially\nsustainable, based on the criteria, cost, and tariff assumptions described. After paying operating\nand  debt-service  costs,  the  cash  flows  were  positive  throughout  the  projection  period,  with\naccumulated surpluses in year 20 (Table A11.4).\nTable A11.4:  Financial Position of WUSCs\n(NRs million)\nItem Attariya Birendranagar Fikkal Gaighat Lekhnath Parsa Ratnanagar Bandipur Ave.\nOperating surplus\nyear 20 3.2 11.4 0.7 4.4 7.5 2.5 6.8 0.6 4.7\nCash in year 20 15.5 70.0 3.6 16.0 40.5 11.3 31.9 2.6 23.9\nM&E replacement 3.8 3.7 0.3 3.0 2.7 2.9 8.3 0.2 3.0\nMeter replacement 1.2 5.5 0.4 3.6 3.5 1.4 5.0 0.5 2.6\nTotal 5.0 9.2 0.6 6.5 6.2 4.3 13.2 0.7 5.7\nPercent cash on hand 32.2 13.2 17.1 40.8 15.3 38.0 41.6 26.0 23.9\nTimes annual surplus 1.6 0.8 0.9 1.5 0.8 1.7 1.9 1.2 1.2\nM&E = monitoring and evaluation, WUSC = Water Users Sanitation Committee.\n21.

Cost Recovery, Tariff Structure, and Affordability\n22. Government  guidelines  state  that  tariffs  for  future  programs  for  urban  water  supply\nsystems \u201cshould incorporate adequate cost recovery based on differential consumption which", "69\nAppendix 11, page 7\nalso provides a lifeline rate for low income households with low consumption and a penalty rate\nfor excessive consumption.\u201d  In accordance with the guidelines, the project financial objectives for\nthe WUSC systems are to develop appropriate water tariff structures to recover the cost of\nproduction including O&M requirements, debt service, and a contribution toward future capital\ndevelopment, such that they can be financially self-sustaining in the future.\n23. Social objectives are to ensure low-income households will have access to affordable\nwater, with water bills not exceeding 5 percent of their household income. For the poor, this\nrequires the tariff structure to include a lifeline block to ensure that the basic needs (estimated at\n60 lpcd) can be met at an affordable rate of less than 5 percent of average income (assumed at\nNRs250 per household per month). For other domestic users, tariff objectives are the lesser of\nAIFC  and  the  limit  of  affordability.  Average  household  income  in  the  subproject  towns  is\nestimated at NRs5,000 per month, with demand of 100 lpcd.  Therefore, indicative tariffs for the\nsubprojects  in  the  financial  analysis  are  based  on  cost  recovery  objectives  to  increase  the\ncharges for water toward the economic costs to improve the efficiency of resource allocation and\ndemand management; to ensure revenues will be adequate to meet cash flow requirements for\noperations, debt service, and capital replacement; and to provide services at an affordable rate,\nrecognizing the needs of lower income users.\n24. For  each  subproject,  indicative  tariffs  were  developed,  based  on  an  assessment  of\naffordability that would be adequate to cover all operating costs, debt servicing, and capital\nreplacement, while maintaining a positive cash flow. The projections show that, as long as tariffs\nare regularly increased to cover inflation (maintained in real terms), the WUSCs should be able to\ngenerate cash surpluses for expansion or major capital replacement. A blocked tariff is adopted in\nthe financial analysis of the subproject towns, with a lifeline block of 10 m3 per month at a rate\naffordable to low-income users. A second block of tariff is set at 1.5 times the lifeline rate for\nconsumption beyond lifeline amount, or at least AIFC per m3. Table A11.6 summarizes the tariff\nstructure  and  impacts  for  each  project  in  terms  of  estimated  monthly  household  cost  and\naffordability, as measured by percentage of household income for average and low-income\nhouseholds. The rates range from a low of 1.7 percent income for low-income consumers in\nBirendranagar, to the higher limit of 5 percent for average users in Fikkal and Attariya. Based on\nthe affordability criterion of charges not exceeding 5 percent of income, the required tariffs are\nwithin both poor and average households\u2019 ability to pay.\nTable A11.6:  Subproject Indicative Tariffs\nRates (NRs per m3)\nItem Attariya Birendranagar Fikkal Gaighat Lekhnath Parsa Ratnanagar Bandipur Ave.\nTariff Structures\nBands (m3 per month)\n0-10 12.3 8.0 15.0 9.0 12.0 12.5 12.0 12.0 11.6\n>10 19.0 12.0 22.0 17.0 18.0 19.0 18.0 18.0 17.9\nAIFC per m3 28.5 23.2 41.4 28.7 39.2 25.7 26.1 26.9 30.0\nAverage Tariff (Ave. HH) 15.6 9.5 18.3 12.0 14.4 14.9 14.8 14.0 14.2\nAverage Household\nMonthly Bill (NRs/month) 313 152 293 192 237 239 237 210 234\nAffordability - % HH\nIncome 5.0 2.0 5.0 4.2 3.8 3.6 3.4 3.9 3.9\nLow Income\nHousehold\nMonthly Bill (NRs/month) 161 80 150 90 120 125 120 120 121\nAffordability - % HH\nIncome 4.9 1.7 4.5 3.4 2.8 4.3 3.6 3.8 3.6\nAIFC = average incremental financial cost, HH = household."], "metadata": {"Author": "ldm", "CreationDate": "D:20000911131207Z", "Creator": "ADOBEPS4.DRV Version 4.10", "ModDate": "D:20131112183543+08'00'", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 3.01 for Windows", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R165-00RRP.doc"}}
