THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \npolicy-based loan and grant to the Kyrgyz Republic for subprogram 2 of the Second Investment \nClimate Improvement Program.1 The program aims to improve the private sector investment \nclimate in the Kyrgyz Republic.2 It supports increasing access to finance, enabling private \nparticipation in infrastructure, diversifying export products and markets, encouraging diversified \nforeign direct investment (FDI), improving skills to match market needs, increasing transparency \nin government, and reducing the cost of doing business. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n2.  Growth in the Kyrgyz economy slowed from 4.0% in 2014 to 3.5% in 2015 because of \nnegative  spillovers  from  the  recession  in  the  Russian  Federation  and  a  sharp  economic \nslowdown in Kazakhstan.3 Growth in industry slowed from 5.7% in 2014 to 1.4% in 2015 as gold \nproduction  and  construction  halved,  while  textiles  and  electricity  output  also  fell.  Private \nconsumption remained stable at 94.7% of gross domestic product (GDP), compared with 95.0% \nin 2014, and capital investment declined from 32.5% of GDP in 2014 to 27.8% in 2015 because \nof lower remittances and currency depreciation. With GDP growth expected to contract by 1.2% \nin the Russian Federation4 and 2.0% in Kazakhstan5 in 2016, growth in the Kyrgyz economy is \nprojected to slow to 1.0% in 2016. The challenging external environment and fiscal and social \npressures pose significant downside risks. Accession to the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) in \n2015 also brings risks to the country\u2019s competitiveness in trading with non-EEU countries.6 \n \n3.  The Kyrgyz economy depends heavily on natural resource exploitation7 and migration-\nled  remittances.  Recognizing  the  importance  of  diversifying  the  economy,  the  government \nidentified the promotion of the private sector as a key priority under its National Sustainable \nDevelopment  Strategy,  2013\u20132017.8 The  strategy  aims  to  (i)  improve  the  environment  for \ndomestic and foreign investment to increase domestic productivity, (ii) increase transparency \nand efficiency of the public sector, and (iii) create higher-value jobs for the country\u2019s workforce. \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The proposed subprogram 2 is included in ADB. 2015. Country Operations Business Plan: Kyrgyz Republic, 2016\u2013\n2018. Manila. Subprogram 1 of the Second Investment Climate Improvement Program was approved in June 2015 \n(ADB. 2015. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Programmatic \nApproach and Policy-Based Grant for Subprogram 1 to the Kyrgyz Republic for the Second Investment Climate \nImprovement Program. Manila). \n3  The  Kyrgyz  Republic  has  significant  exposure  to  the  Russian  Federation  and  Kazakhstan  through  trade, \nremittances, and investment channels. Remittances contracted 25% in 2015 but still accounted for about 26% of \nKyrgyz\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP). \n4  World Bank. 2016.

Kazakhstan. http://country.eiu.com/kazakhstan \n6  The EEU is an economic bloc comprising a market of 170 million people in Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, the \nKyrgyz Republic, and the Russian Federation. While EEU membership may increase trade in goods and services, \nfacilitate more efficient labor and capital flows, and reduce nontariff barriers, the required tariff increase to the level \nof the EEU common external tariff may deter trade with non-EEU countries. \n7  For example, gold constitutes about 48% of exports. The Kumtor Gold Company alone accounted for about 7.1% \nof GDP in 2015. \n8  Government of the Kyrgyz Republic, National Council for Sustainable Development of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2013. \nNational Sustainable Development Strategy for the Kyrgyz Republic For the Period of 2013\u20132017. Bishkek. \n ", "2 \n4.  Since 2008, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been working with the government \nto  improve  the  investment  climate  and  supporting  private  sector  development.9 Additional \nsupport is needed to (i) expand access to financial services, (ii) improve physical infrastructure \nand services, (iii) align workforce skills with market needs, and (iv) reduce corruption and the \ncost of doing business.10 \n \n5.  Inadequate access to financial services. Banks dominate the Kyrgyz financial system, \nrepresenting 87.4% of finance sector assets. While the depth of the financial system11 has \nimproved\u2014the share of loans to GDP rose from 12.4% in 2011 to 27.1% on 30 June 2015\u2014it \nremains  shallow  compared  with  regional  peers.12 The  access  of  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises (SMEs)  to suitable  products  and  services  is  constrained  by  high  bank  lending \ninterest rates (18.6% as of December 2015) and excessive collateral requirements (150%\u2013\n200%  of  the  loan  amount).  This  results  in  banking  services  being  concentrated  on  larger \ncompanies. Without adequate payment infrastructure (including mobile banking), especially in \nrural areas, the economy remains heavily cash-based. Despite improvements, cash still is used \nin 40% of transactions. The financial intermediation of banks can be increased significantly. \nMost financial flows, including remittances, can be routed through the banking system, thereby \nincreasing funding opportunities for the private economy. Improving lending processes (focusing \non cash flows rather than collateral), strengthening payment systems, and improving financial \nliteracy can help broaden private access to finance. Mobile financial services, backed by a \nsound regulatory framework for an e-economy, can lower the cost of financial intermediation \nand offer opportunities to expand the outreach to (i) new customers, especially those in rural \nareas; and (ii) women and marginalized groups to engage in productive economic activities.13 \n \n6.  High infrastructure and service needs. Continuing budget deficits have constrained \nthe government\u2019s ability to invest in critical infrastructure necessary for private sector activity. \nInvestments and technical competencies are needed to provide better economic and social \ninfrastructure and services (including for trade diversification). A sound policy and regulatory \nframework,  dedicated  financing  for  infrastructure  project  preparation  advisory  services  and \nstructuring, and improved knowledge and technical capacity of key government ministries and \nagencies will help prepare bankable projects and facilitate public\u2013private partnership (PPP) \ntransactions  that  benefit  from  the  expertise  and  incentives  of  private  entities.  To  build  an \neffective PPP program, the government needs to improve its ability to plan, regulate, execute, \nand oversee PPP investments. It also must increase private investor confidence through well-\ndesigned contracts, properly allocating risk and reward incentives for investors and executing \ndemonstration projects.14 Given the early stage of PPP market development in the country and \nthe absence of long-term finance, government support through risk participation, debt, and \nguarantee instruments is likely required to ensure the viability and affordability of PPP projects. \n                                                \n9  ADB.

Achievements include the PPP law and regulations assigning roles \nfor the Ministry of Economy (coordination), Ministry of Finance (risk management), and line ministries (project \ninitiation  and  development);  and  the  establishment  of  the  Project  Development  Support  Facility  for  project \npreparation advisory and structuring. The TA supports output 2 of the second program.  \n ", "3 \nExperience in countries with well-developed PPP markets indicates that at least 5 years are \nrequired to reach contract awards for the first PPP projects. \n \n7.  Trade  and  investment  diversification. Although the government\u2019s trade and FDI15 \npolicies support market openness, as shown by the improvement in the trade-to-GDP ratio from \n95% (2005) to 133% (2015), the Kyrgyz Republic exports mainly gold and other minerals, \ntextiles, and agriculture products. Kazakhstan, the Russian Federation, Switzerland, the United \nArab Emirates, and Uzbekistan absorbed more than 80% of the value of these exports in \n2014.16 In addition, EEU accession has increased the country\u2019s exposure to this economically \nvolatile region, making trade diversification necessary. FDI is focused on a few capital-intensive \ninvestments in mining and energy, with minimal technology and skills transfer or links with the \nlocal  economy.17 A  transparent  investor  grievance  and  dispute  resolution  mechanism  will \nprovide out-of-court settlement of investment disputes and avoid protracted and costly litigation \nand renegotiation of contracts.18  \n \n8.  Industry\u2013labor market skills mismatch. The curricula of the technical and vocational \neducation and training (TVET) systems need to be recalibrated to meet the needs of private \nenterprises.  While  industry  sector  skills  councils  have  been  established,  private  company \nrepresentation is missing. As a result, TVET offerings are essentially driven by student demand, \nrather than by potential employer requirements. The Kyrgyz International Business Council has \nsingled  out the  lack  of qualified  workers as  a key  hurdle to  attracting foreign  investment. \nEquipping the labor force with skills demanded by the private sector will help increase the \ngrowth and productivity of the economy, enhance opportunities for investments in human capital, \nand reduce income inequality. \n \n9.  Weak  governance  and  high  cost  of  doing  business.  Corruption  remains  a  key \nobstacle for doing business. Regulatory and legal reforms are needed to ease the barriers to \nformalizing businesses, reduce arbitrary discretion of officials, and improve accountability of \nlicensing and inspection bodies. E-procurement in the public sector will help limit discretion \n(reducing  the  likelihood  of  petty corruption)  and  enhance  transparency,  accountability,  and \nefficiency in service delivery. It will also create business opportunities for the private provision of \npublic services. Simplifying regulations and reducing compliance costs, including taxes, will give \nunregistered firms incentives to register and pay taxes. \n \n10.  While investment and funding from the People\u2019s Republic of China and the Russian \nFederation will continue, systematic reforms are essential to increase the value addition of \nformal SMEs in the economy, create jobs, and reduce the Kyrgyz economy\u2019s dependence on \nextractive industries and remittance-backed private consumption.19 \n                                                \n15 United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. 2016. Investment Policy Review: Kyrgyzstan. Geneva. \n16 Gold accounts for more than 40% of the total value of exports of gold and other minerals, textiles, and agriculture \nproducts. Central Asia and the Russian Federation absorb about 80% of non-gold exports. \n17 In 2014, FDI was concentrated on exploration, mining, and manufacturing (79%), mainly from Canada, the Russian \nFederation, and the United Kingdom. \n18 The operating contract of the Kumtor gold mine is being renegotiated. \n19 SMEs in the Kyrgyz Republic are defined in terms of employees, turnover, and sector. In agriculture, hunting and \nforestry, fishing, fish farming, mining, processing, construction, and production and distribution of electricity, gas, \nand water, small enterprises have 16\u201350 employees and annual  turnover of Som150,000\u2013Som500,000, while \nmedium-sized enterprises have 51\u2013200 employees and annual turnover of Som500,000\u2013Som2,000,000. In trade, \nmotor vehicle repairs, household goods and personal items, hotels and restaurants, transport and communication, \nfinance, real estate, renting and consumer services, education, health care, and social and personal services, \nsmall enterprises have 8\u201315 employees and annual turnover of Som230,000\u2013Som500,000, while medium-sized \n \n ", "4 \n11.  Government efforts and development coordination. To mitigate the risks of lending \nto SMEs, five regional public credit guarantee funds have been set up, which had leveraged \nSom172 million by an aggregate capital of Som32.5 million as of 2014.20 Warehouse receipts \nfinancing is being piloted, and the Law on Warehouse Receipts is being drafted. To reduce the \nshare of cash circulating in the economy, payments through banks covered 90.5% of public \nsector salaries and 33.4% of pensions in 2014. Amendments to the PPP law, and improved \nproject development and transaction advisory and government financial support, have resulted \nin 14 projects at different stages of preparation\u2014with the first PPP contract award scheduled for \nmid-2017.21 In addition, the amended Law on Investment improves investor protection. \n \n12.  Some of Kyrgyz\u2019s development partners are supporting government efforts to improve \nthe investment climate.22 The International Monetary Fund\u2019s extended credit facility, approved in \nApril 2015, supports fiscal and debt sustainability and financial sector stability.23 The World \nBank helps improve public financial accounting, disclosure, and audit. The International Finance \nCorporation  assists  in  improving  the  foreign  investment  policy  and  related  laws,  and \nagribusiness regulations; and provides PPP transaction advisory services. The Swiss State \nSecretariat for Economic Affairs is cofinancing activities of the World Bank Group. The United \nStates  Agency  for  International  Development  helps  improve  the  competitiveness  of  textile, \ntourism, and construction sectors. The Japan International Cooperation Agency, European Bank \nfor Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and German development cooperation through \nKfW and GIZ are supporting SME and private sector development and PPPs. \n \n13.  ADB\u2019s value addition. The programmatic approach has enabled the government to \nbuild  systematically  on  achievements,  incorporate  appropriate  lessons,  and  steer  a \ncomprehensive reform program.  ADB\u2019s continuing support and government progress made \nunder the program have triggered more ambitious reforms. For example, the government \n(i)  is gradually increasing cashless payments through the banks to (a) help reduce \nthe  size  of  the  informal  economy,  (b)  improve  financial  system  depth  by \nincreasing deposits in the formal financial system, (c) provide financial services \nto the currently underbanked (mainly the poor and women), and (d) increase the \ntransparency of transactions; \n(ii)  developed its PPP policy, legal, institutional, and financial framework in line with \ninternational good practice, resulting in a pipeline of 14 projects, with one project \nexpecting the contract award by mid-2017;24 \n(iii)  acquired the Generalised System of Preferences Plus (GSP+) trade privilege \nfrom the European Union (EU) to diversify exports, which resulted in Turkish \ncompany Deniz Tekstil setting up a textiles factory near Kara-Balta to export to \nthe EU and the EEU;25 \n(iv)  obtained on December 2015 its first sovereign credit rating by leading rating \n                                                                                                                                                       \nenterprises have 16\u201350 employees and annual turnover of Som500,000\u2013Som2,000,000. The informal economy is \nestimated to deprive the Kyrgyz economy of revenues equivalent to 6%\u201313% of GDP. \n20 The regions are Jalal-Abad, Kant, Kara-Balta, Karakol, and Osh. The Association of Guarantee Funds of the \nKyrgyz Republic, a member of the Association of the European Union Guarantee Funds, manages the funds. \n21 Hemodialysis center and clinical laboratories. \n22 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 International Monetary Fund Assessment Letter (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 PPP work is closely coordinated with the International Finance Corporation, Japan International Cooperation \nAgency, and EBRD. \n25 GSP+ is a trade privilege granted by the EU to a few countries to help diversify their economies. It provides zero or \nhighly preferential tariffs for exports of more than 7,000 products from these countries. The countries are required \nto ratify and implement international conventions on human and labor rights, environment, and good governance. \n ", "5 \nagencies (B, stable from Standard & Poor\u2019s; B2, stable from Moody\u2019s Investors \nService) to provide a basis for investors and lenders to price country risks and to \nopen opportunities to diversify its funding sources; and \n(v)  began matching TVET curricula to market demand.26 \n \n14.  The key lesson from the first program27 and subprogram 1 of the second program \n(footnote 2) is that results-based, activity-oriented policy actions and sustained engagement \nwith the government yield good results. This lesson has been incorporated into subprogram 2. \n \n15.  Alignment with ADB\u2019s strategy. The program and its subprograms are aligned with the \ndevelopment priorities in the country partnership strategy, 2013\u2013201728 and the Midterm Review \nof  Strategy  2020,29 and  are  included  in  the  country  operations  business  plan,  2016\u20132018 \n(footnote 2). Private sector development through investment climate improvement is a priority \nunder the country partnership strategy. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n16.  The impact of subprogram 2 will be increased private sector investment in the economy. \nThe outcome will be an improved business and investment climate in the Kyrgyz Republic. \n \nC.  Outputs \n17.  The  second  program  comprises  three  subprograms  to  support  reforms  under  four \noutputs (paras. 18\u201324). All policy actions completed under subprogram 1 remain intact, and the \n21  subprogram  2  policy  actions  have  advanced  the  progress  made  under  subprogram  1. \nSubprogram 2 actions were completed in June 2016, well within schedule,30 despite elections in \n2015 and the formation of a new government. \n \n18.  Output 1: Access to finance increased. This output aims to increase access to finance \nby  reducing  the  costs  and  risks  of  lending  to  SMEs,  increasing  cashless  payments,  and \nincreasing the access of the underbanked (rural population, poor people, women, and those in \nthe informal sector) to the formal financial system. Subprogram 1 (i) prepared the concept for a \nrisk-sharing facility through a guarantee fund for SMEs, (ii) established enabling laws and \nregulations for electronic payments and mobile financial services, and (iii) prepared a strategic \nplan for retail payments including regulatory oversight. \n \n19.  Under  subprogram  2,  the  government  (i)  implemented  a  risk  management  system, \ninternet payment systems, and a dispute resolution system for the Interbank Processing Center \n(IPC); (ii) approved the IPC business strategy, 2016\u20132018 and built the requisite IPC staff \ncapabilities; (iii) put in force regulations for e-money, payment systems operators, and remote \ndelivery of other financial services; (iv) integrated relevant payment cards and money transfer \ncards; 31  (v)  launched  the  State  Program  on  Financial  Literacy;  and  (vi)  approved  the \n                                                \n26 ADB. 2012.

Output 2: Public\u2013private partnership program enhanced. This output aims to enable \nprivate  sector  participation  in  infrastructure  investments  and  services  by  providing  well-\nstructured and bankable PPPs to the market. It will gradually build operational experience \nthrough learning-by-doing on pilot projects.33 Subprogram 1 strengthened the PPP framework \nby (i) drafting amendments to the PPP law; (ii) approving funding for advisory and structuring \nsupport from the Project Development Support Facility (PDSF), established in 2014 for pilot \nprojects (footnote 14); and (iii) approving guidelines on identifying and managing PPP fiscal \nrisks, including PPP contingent liabilities.

It also launched a communication plan to increase PPP public awareness. \n \n21.  Under subprogram 2, the government (i) began structured implementation of its PPP \nprogram,  including  recruiting  and  training  PPP  staff  in  key  agencies;  (ii)  amended  PDSF \nregulations to streamline its steering committee\u2019s approval process for funding prefeasibility \nstudies, feasibility studies, and/or transaction advisory of projects; (iii) established a PPP council \nheaded by the vice prime minister to strengthen oversight of PPP implementation; (iv) undertook \nan interministerial review of the health and transport (road) sectors, and approved strategies \nand  multiyear  public  investment  plans  (up  to  2025),  including  PPPs,  in  those  sectors;  (v) \napproved  PDSF  funding  for  five  projects  and  announced  competitive  tenders  for  related \nprefeasibility and feasibility studies; (vi) signed the feasibility study and transaction advisory \ncontract for a CT scan project; (vii) drafted the mechanism and guidelines for long-term debt \nfinancing of PPP projects; and (viii) amended the draft budget code to include government \nfinancial support for PPP projects. The Parliament amended the PPP law. \n \n22.  Output 3: Trade and investment diversified. This output aims to implement the Kyrgyz \nRepublic\u2019s trade and investment policies, including the priorities set out in the EDP, 2015\u20132017 \nand  capitalizing  on  the  export  opportunities  provided  by  EEU  membership  and  the  GSP+ \nprivileges (footnote 25). Since trade and investment facilitation also covers services, this output \nprovides for the identification of and information on new markets for Kyrgyz exporters and \nopportunities for prospective foreign investors, including addressing investors\u2019 grievances and \ndeveloping workers\u2019 skills in line with market demand. Subprogram 1 helped the country (i) \napply for GSP+ status and prepare for its first sovereign credit rating, (ii) implement the strategy \nof the Investment Promotion Agency (IPA), (iii) draft a strategy for modernizing the national \nquality infrastructure (NQI) for trade in line with international requirements, and (iv) establish \nindustry\u2013TVET coordination for skills development. \n \n23.  Under  subprogram  2,  the  government  (i)  established  the  EDP  secretariat  and \nimplemented the strategy implementation management tool, a web-based interface to support \nall the functions required to effectively manage EDP implementation;34 (ii) obtained GSP+ trade \n                                                \n32 The EDP, 2015\u20132017 lays out specific courses of action to develop the country\u2019s export sector.

Output 4: Transparency and ease of doing business increased. This output aims to \nincrease transparency in government and reduce the regulatory and tax-related costs of doing \nbusiness to give private businesses incentives to expand and formalize, including formalization \nof businesses in the informal sector, many of which are owned by women. Subprogram 1 \nsupported the rollout of e-procurement in all government agencies, as well as the approval of \nlegal  amendments  to  reduce  the tax filing frequency for  SMEs.  Under  subprogram  2,  the \ngovernment  (i)  issued  the  regulation  on  e-procurement  system  maintenance,  assigning \nresponsibilities to relevant government agencies; (ii) allocated a budget for the e-procurement \nsystem effective 1 April 2016 (to ensure continuity after the completion of an ADB\u2019s technical \nassistance project);37 (iii) increased the limit for business turnover exemption from the value-\nadded tax; (iv) waived sales tax on exports and on all noncash payments; and (v) reduced tax \ncompliance costs by reducing tax collection from three agencies to one, the State Tax Service. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n25.  The overall program has three subprograms and an estimated funding requirement \nequivalent to $70 million for 2015\u20132018. Subprogram 1 was funded by a grant of $20 million, \ndisbursed in 2015. Funding for subprogram 2 totals $25 million equivalent. The government has \nrequested (i) a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR8,890,000, and (ii) a grant not \nexceeding  $12.5  million,  both  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  to  help  finance  the \nprogram.38 The loan will have a 24-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an annual \ninterest rate of 1.0% during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter, and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft financing agreement. Subprogram 2 funding will be disbursed in \na single tranche upon loan and grant effectiveness. \n \n26.  The size of subprogram 2 is based on the government\u2019s development financing needs, \nthe  nature  of  the  required  reforms,  and  the  fiscal  benefits  and  development  impact.  The \ndevelopment-related financing gap is about $299.4 million for 2016, an increase of 31.4% from \n2015.39 The \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit is projected at 4.9% of GDP in 2016 and 4.1% in 2017. The gap is to \nbe met mainly from long-term loans from foreign sources (projected at $124.9 million) and \nanticipated  budget  support  from  the  World  Bank ($24.0  million),  ADB  ($25.0  million), \nInternational Monetary Fund ($26.0 million), Russian Federation ($30.0 million), and EU and \nother development partners ($19.9 million). The remaining gap is expected to be met from \nrevenues from proposed privatizations ($42.1 million) and issuance of government bonds ($7.5 \nmillion). ADB\u2019s subprogram 2 will help narrow the financing gap by about 8.3% in 2016. Public \nexternal debt surged from 53% of GDP in 2014 to 63% of GDP during 2015 because of the \n                                                \n35 Priority export industries are agriculture (fruits, vegetables, meat, and dairy products), textile and apparel, tourism, \nconstruction materials, and bottled water. These industries also benefit from the zero or low tariffs of the GSP+. \n36 EU quality standards will be incorporated during the time frame of subprogram 3. \n37 ADB. 2012.

Because of the \nparliamentary elections in 2015, the government delayed \ufb01scal consolidation measures to 2016 \nto improve debt sustainability to an acceptable level by 2018, while continuing to fund programs \nto  reduce  poverty  and  boost  growth.  Budget  support  is  necessary  to  finance  part  of  the \ndevelopment  financing  needs,  covering  the  period  from  the  introduction  of  reforms  to  the \nrealization of fiscal benefits.40 \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n27.  The Ministry of Economy (MOE) is the executing agency. The MOE, the Ministry of \nFinance (MOF), and the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic are the implementing agencies. \nThe government can implement the reforms effectively, as demonstrated by its experience \nunder  the  first  program  and  the  effective  execution  of  policy-based  programs  with  other \ndevelopment partners, including the World Bank. Two technical assistance projects support the \nimplementation of subprogram 2.41 All policy actions under subprogram 2 were completed by \nthe implementing agencies in June 2016; the implementing agency responsible for completing a \nspecific  policy  action  will  be  indicated  in  the  financing  agreement.  Follow-up  actions  for \nsubprogram 3 are being firmed up (Appendix 4). The proceeds of the policy-based loan and \ngrant will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2015, as \namended from time to time). The proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange cost of \nitems, excluding items in the list of ineligible items and imports financed by other bilateral and \nmultilateral sources.42 Implementation of the overall program is expected to finish by October \n2018. Subprogram 1 was implemented from July 2014 to June 2015, while subprogram 2, which \nbegan implementation in July 2015, is expected to be completed in July 2016. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n28.  The reforms supported by the program entail (i) short-term direct and indirect costs to \nthe  government  to  implement  and  monitor  reforms,  and  (ii)  fiscal  benefits  in  the  form  of \nincreased revenues from greater and diversified economic activities. Indirect costs are staff time \nand  administrative  expenses.  Direct  costs  include  the  costs  associated  with  establishing \nguarantee facilities and implementing pilot e-payments projects; required government funding to \nenable  private  participation  in  infrastructure,  including  NQI  for  trade,  infrastructure  project \ndevelopment, and advisory services; and sovereign ratings reviews. The reforms will create a \nbigger formal and diversified economy. Key cost savings and long-term gains from the reform \nprogram will be (i) expanded access to credit for the private sector through guarantee facilities, \nas well as an increase in the volume of money and payments made in the banking system; (ii) \nincreased financial savings and efficiency gains from improved public investment planning, \nexecution, and leveraging of finance through private sources, including PPPs; (iii) more value-\nadded  jobs  through  effective  implementation  of  trade  and  investment  policies;  (iv)  greater \nformalization of the economy by easing of registration, tax compliance, and tax administration; \n(v) greater investor confidence and higher investments; and (vi) improved cost efficiency from   \n                                                \n40 Program Impact and Justification of Policy-Based Lending (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n41 ADB. 2016.

Higher  expenditures  are  imperative, \nnecessitating budget support (footnote 40). \n \nB.  Governance \n29.  Public financial management risks are high but manageable.43 Budget processes and \ntransparency are being improved, and links between the medium-term budget framework and \nthe annual budget are being strengthened with multi-donor support. Central Treasury systems \nare being strengthened and fully automated: all regional treasury departments are connected to \nthe central system and the expenditure segments are fully automated. The World Bank\u2019s Kyrgyz \nAudit and Financial Reporting Enhancement Project is supporting audit and financial reporting \nreforms.  Under  the  grant  project  that  supported  the  first  program  (2008-2014),  the  MOE \napproved contracts which overcharged for the delivery of training components. ADB is working \nwith the Government and the MOE to mitigate risks of similar recurrences, and to recover these \nfunds.44 Public procurement policy has been improved with support from EBRD and the United \nNations  Commission  on  International  Trade  Law.  Through  ADB  support,  a  modern  e-\nprocurement system is being mainstreamed across all central government agencies (footnote \n37). Streamlined tax regulations, lower tax rates, and the automation of tax filing (with support \nunder output 4) are reducing the cost of compliance and rent-seeking opportunities of tax \ncollection officials. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is helping the \ngovernment  monitor  the  progress  and  efficiency  in  anticorruption  reforms. 45  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment and MOE. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n30.  Better access to finance, diversified trade and investment, improved public infrastructure, \nand reduced costs of doing business will stimulate private sector activity. New enterprises and \ngrowth  of  and  innovation  in  existing  ones,  will  create  more  and  higher  value-added  jobs. \nImproved public infrastructure and services will directly benefit the poor and vulnerable, as will \nthe  expansion  of  mobile  and  e-payments.  Subprogram  2,  categorized  as  effective  gender \nmainstreaming,  will  address  the  insufficient  representation  of  women  in  economic  policy \ndevelopment and implementation, and unequal access to assets and resources. SMEs owned \nby women will be supported by the guarantee fund and will be provided with dedicated business \ndevelopment  support  to  capitalize  on  the  EEU  and  GSP+  export  opportunities.  Key \nimplementing agencies under the program, including the MOE and MOF, are hiring women to \nensure appropriate gender balance in key technical positions. Infrastructure PPP projects with \npositive poverty and gender impacts are being prioritized, and the design of infrastructure PPP \nprojects will consider solutions that positively impact poverty and gender. The market-linked \nTVET programs will aim to provide 25% of the jobs and internships to women. Reducing taxes \nand tax compliance requirements will encourage unregistered businesses, many of which are \nowned by women, to enter the formal economy. \n \n                                                \n43 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n44 ADB. 2013.

Program activities are confined to policy and institutional reforms. None of the activities \nwill require involuntary resettlement or affect indigenous peoples. The program is unlikely to \nhave  adverse  impacts  on  the  environment.  Safeguards  categorization  for  environment, \ninvoluntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples are all C in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009). \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n32.  The economy faces substantial downward risks to investments, remittances, and exports \nbecause of the slowdown of its major trading partners in Central Asia. These risks are mitigated \nby the country\u2019s acquisition of the EU\u2019s GSP+. The MOF is developing the treasury single \naccount system and plans to launch the pilot by December 2016. It is also in discussions with \nthe Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency for a project in 2016 to develop the software \nfor financial management information system. The MOF is also working on bringing the treasury \nsystem software in line with EEU requirements. Progress will continue to be monitored during \nthe  preparation  of  subprogram  3.  Corruption  risks  are  being  mitigated  by  mainstreaming \ngovernment e-procurement, reducing tax compliance burdens, and establishing an investor \ngrievance  redress  mechanism.  The  benefits  and  impacts  of  the  program  are  expected  to \noutweigh the costs and mitigate risks. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n33.
