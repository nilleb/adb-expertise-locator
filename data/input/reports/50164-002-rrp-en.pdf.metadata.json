ADB\u2019s  loan \nwould  support  CWE  in  designing,  constructing,  and  operating  a  series  of  facilities  spanning \nseveral  components,  such  as  (i)  wastewater  treatment  plants;  (ii)  sludge  treatment  plants; \n(iii) sewage conveyance and interception pipelines; (iv) dredging of rivers and lakes; (v) other civil \nworks  such  as  riverbank  reinforcements,  odor  treatment  plants,  and  landscaping;  and  (vi) the \ndevelopment of watersheds and wetlands. \n \n3. \nCWE selects subprojects located in urban sections of key rivers and lakes in the central \nand  western  provinces  of  the  PRC  that  are  designated  the  government\u2019s  priority  areas  for \nenvironmental  protection.  For  each  subproject,  CWE  develops  and  operates  the  component \nfacilities as public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs), governed under concession agreements signed \nwith  city  or  county  governments.  It  is  envisaged  that,  by  2024,  river  or  lake  rehabilitation \nsubprojects  will  be  developed  with  wastewater  treatment  capacity  of  2.3  million  tons  per  day, \nsludge treatment capacity of 2,900 tons per day, and 190 kilometers of sewage pipeline networks, \namong  other  infrastructure.  The  facilities  will  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  safeguards  and technical  and \nfinancial eligibility criteria.2 \n \n4. \neconomically viable, and financially sound. [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n\nProject  implementation  is  satisfactory,  and  the  project  remains  technically  feasible, \n\nII. \n\nADDITIONAL FINANCING \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \n5. \nThe proposed increase in the B loan by up to $250 million will address CWE\u2019s request to \nbroaden  its  access  to  international  commercial  financing  and  expand  the  impact  of  ADB\u2019s \ncofinancing program by tapping into increased demand from commercial banks to participate in \nenvironmental PPPs in the PRC. [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nADB\u2019s B loan product has been increasingly effective in catalyzing commercial cofinancing \n6. \nfor infrastructure development in the PRC. During 2012\u20132018, ADB successfully syndicated 15 B-\n\n \n\n \n1  The complementary loan is an Asian Development Bank (ADB) syndicated loan product that can be offered in various \ncurrencies (including local currencies) funded by commercial banks, where ADB is the lender of record. B loans are \ncomplementary loans which are cross-border and in US dollars. For this project, while ADB approved loan facilities \nin US dollars or its equivalent in yuan, the A loan was fully disbursed in US dollars. Therefore, the complementary \nloan will be disbursed in US dollars and in this paper, be referred to as the B loan. \n\n2  Eligibility criteria shall include a concession agreement with service exclusivity; the satisfaction of an environmental \nand  social  management  system  (ESMS),  which  is  compliant  with  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  requirements;  location; \ncompliance with PRC environmental standards; and exclusion of category A projects, among others. \n\n\f2 \n\nloan  and  complementary  loan  transactions,  mobilizing  more  than  $1.5  billion  in  financing  from \nmore than 60 different investors. \n \n7. \nThe proposed increase in the B loan to CWE is beneficial to both the company and the \ncommercial banks, which will all be linked under the ADB B loan umbrella by aggregating multiple \nsubprojects  into  a  single  loan  facility.  Thus, the B  loan  structure  helps  surmount  the  barrier  of \ntransaction  costs, since each  subproject  by  itself  would  be too  small for  international  banks  to \nconsider financing. It will also allow banks participating in the project to gain from benefits accruing \nfrom participating in ADB\u2019s B loan structure. Finally, B loans benefit ADB by aligning the interests \namong  lenders,  avoiding  potential  conflicts  that  might  arise  between  parallel  facilities,  and \nimproving credit monitoring and administration. \n \nThe  proposed  increase  in  the  B  loan  is  consistent  with  the  project\u2019s  development \n8. \nobjectives: to mitigate water pollution in rivers and lakes of the PRC and to encourage private \ninvestment in less-developed areas of the PRC. This is in line with the government\u2019s priority of \nencouraging  new  forms  of  PPP  models  to  promote  water  pollution  control  and  waterbody \nrehabilitation.  The  proposed  increase  in  the  B  loan  amount  is  also  fully  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 2030, which targets a substantial increase in long-term cofinancing by 2030, with every \n$1.00 in financing for ADB\u2019s private sector operations matched by $2.50 of long-term cofinancing.3 \nThe  increased  B  loan  will  catalyze  wider commercial  finance to support  integrated  wastewater \nmanagement  concessions  targeting  environmental  services  for  lakes  and  rivers,  where  bank \nlending, especially from international commercial banks, is limited; and build confidence in future \nprivate sector participation in this emerging area. \n \nB. \n \n9. \nThe impact and outcome of the project remain unchanged while the outputs of the project \nhave been increased to include two additional targets on gender. The project is aligned with the \nfollowing impact: pollution of rivers and lakes in the PRC is mitigated. The project will have the \nfollowing outcome: provision of wastewater management services under integrated concessions \nin selected central and western provinces of the PRC is expanded.4 The key project output is the \nconstruction  of  wastewater treatment  plants  and associated  civil  works for the  improvement  of \nriver  and  lake  water  quality,  with  river  or  lake  rehabilitation  subprojects  being  developed  with \nwastewater treatment capacity of 2.3 million cubic meters per day, sludge treatment capacity of \n2,070  cubic  meters  per  day,  and  190  kilometers  of  sewage  pipeline  networks,  among  other \ninfrastructure. \n \n10.  While the project was approved under a \u201cNo Gender Elements\u201d categorization, as part of \nthe  B-loan  increase,  CWE  has  committed  to  implementing  the  following  gender  initiatives:  (i) \nimplementation of internship programs for female students to support them to move into technical \nroles, and (ii) design and implementation of a non-discrimination policy to support equal treatment \nof women and disabled employees in the workplace. CWE will report on the implementation of \nthe gender outputs that it has committed to, under the annual project monitoring and development \neffectiveness monitoring reporting mechanism. \n \n\nImpact, Outcome, and Output \n\n \n\n \n3  ADB.  2018.

The proposed change will increase the amount of the B loan by up \nto $250 million, taking the total amount of the B loan up to $350 million, to support the company\u2019s \nrobust investment pipeline and accommodate the increased capacity of participating banks. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nD. \n \n12. \nThe safeguard categorization for the proposed increase in the B loan remains unchanged \nfrom  the  original  classification:  category  B  for  environment  and  involuntary  resettlement  and \ncategory C for indigenous peoples. CWE established an ESMS consistent with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement requirements  before  the first  disbursement  of  ADB\u2019s  A loan.  The  ESMS  was \ndesigned based on the due diligence findings and corrective actions identified in an environmental \nand social compliance audit conducted during the project processing stage. In line with CWE\u2019s \nESMS requirements,  ADB  reviewed  and  approved  the  safeguard  documents  for the  two  ADB-\nfunded  subprojects  under  the  A  loan  before  disbursement  and  disclosed  them  on  the  ADB \nwebsite.  The  two  subprojects  were  visited  by  the  ADB  team  safeguard  specialists  during  the \nannual review mission in 2019. While the on-site team did not identify any significant risks and \nimpacts, and confirmed the original categorization, it found information gaps between one of the \nsubproject\u2019s environmental and social audit reports and its implementation (e.g., wetland design \nand its operational management, and renting of land as opposed to purchase at some subproject \ncomponents). Hence, the audit report did not fully assess the environmental and social impacts \nand risks related to the subproject as required under the ESMS. CWE\u2019s annual monitoring report \nof ADB-funded subprojects will address these gaps identified during the review mission. ADB will \ncontinue its review and approval role in the environmental and social due diligence process for \nadditional subprojects under the B loan to ensure that CWE and its consultant thoroughly identify \nand  manage  all  the  environmental  and  social  issues.  This  support  by  ADB  will  continue  to \nstrengthen  CWE\u2019s  capacity  and  resources \nidentify  and  manage  subproject-related \nenvironmental and social risks and impacts. As required in its ESMS, CWE will continue to comply \nwith  national  labor  laws  and,  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection  Strategy  (2001),  will  take \nmeasures  to  comply  with  the  internationally  recognized  core  labor  standards. 5  Information \ndisclosure  and  consultation  with  affected  people  will  continue  to  be  conducted  by  CWE  in \naccordance with ADB requirements. \n\nto \n\n13. \nCWE  has  been  and  will  be  subject  to  an  annual  integrity  due  diligence  review  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Integrity  Due  Diligence  Guidelines  for  Nonsovereign  Operations.6 No \nsignificant or potentially significant integrity risks were identified, as there are no unresolved or \nsubstantiated adverse media or other related information. Having reviewed the investment, ADB \ndoes not believe that it is being used for money laundering, or terrorism financing. \n \nE. \n \n14. \n\nAll other implementation arrangements of the project remain unchanged. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n\n \n5  ADB. 2003.
