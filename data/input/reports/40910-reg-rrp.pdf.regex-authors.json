I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nequity investment in Mekong Enterprise Fund II (the Fund) of up to $10 million or 25% of the \nFund\u2019s total share capital, whichever is less.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: BACKGROUND, CHALLENGES, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Background: Development of SMEs \n1.  Economic progress from a low base \n \n2.  Viet Nam has achieved substantial progress in moving forward from an extremely low \nlevel  of  development  in  the  early  1990s.  With  a  stable  political  regime  and  robust \nmacroeconomic fundamentals, Viet Nam was among the world\u2019s fastest-growing economies in \n2004 and is making good progress in further improving its policy environment.1 Industry and \nservices, together accounting for nearly 80% of the gross domestic product (GDP), were the \nmain  sources  of  growth,  recording  10.2%  and  7.4%  growth  respectively,  while  agriculture \nexpanded the slowest at 2.8%. GDP growth is projected at around 7.6% for 2005, 7.6% in 2006, \nand 7.5% in 2007, supported by strong domestic demand and export growth. Since 2001 \nVietnamese authorities have accelerated the implementation of structural reforms needed to \nmodernize the economy and to produce more competitive, export-driven industries. Viet Nam's \nmembership in the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) and the establishment of the US-Viet Nam \nBilateral Trade Agreement in December 2001 have led to even more rapid changes in Viet \nNam's trade and economic regime. Viet Nam is working toward accession to the World Trade \nOrganization, which is expected to foster its export sectors.  \n \n2.  Emergence of SMEs \n \n3.  ADB\u2019s Country Economic Review reckons that the development of the private sector is \nparticularly important in Viet Nam, because it can have a significant impact on poverty reduction \nthrough its effect on growth and employment.2 Although the Government made only slow \nprogress with its State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) equitization (i.e. partial privatization) program, \nthe private sector in Viet Nam has been growing rapidly since the mid-1990s, and particularly \nsince the implementation of the Enterprise Law on 1 January 2000, when it became significantly \neasier to register new private companies. Since starting the equitization program in the early \n1990s, the government has partially privatized 2,450 SOEs. The SME sector, which is the main \nfocus of this Fund, is still largely undeveloped. This is a reflection of the fact that the operation \nof large scale private sector enterprises was very difficult until the reforms of the 1990s and \nmost private companies in Viet Nam were established as corporate entities only within the last \n10 years.  \n \n4.  It is the growth of these private sector companies that is recognized by the Government \nto be the engine of growth. The development of SMEs can contribute to poverty reduction \nthrough contribution to economic growth, tax revenues, employment creation and individual \nincome. Moreover, the diversification in the economy that will be brought about by SME growth \nin various industry sectors is a stabilizing factor.  \n \n \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program Update for the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam 2006-2008. Manila. \n2 ADB. 2000. Country Economic Review. Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. Manila.  ", "2         \n3.   Cambodia and Laos  \n \n5.  In Cambodia, private companies tend to be smaller than in Viet Nam, but nonetheless \nCambodia has a reasonably thriving private sector. The absence of a state-owned sector in \nCambodia has made it easier for private companies to establish themselves in all areas of the \ncountry\u2019s economy. In addition to locally founded and managed companies, there are a number \nof private companies founded by overseas Cambodians who returned to Cambodia to establish \nbusinesses. There has also been foreign investment into garment manufacturing businesses in \nCambodia, mainly by Taiwanese, Chinese and Korean companies. \n \n6.  Private companies in Laos are significantly smaller than in Viet Nam. It has been difficult \nfor the Fund manager to identify private companies in Laos with annual revenues above $1 \nmillion. Although market reforms instituted in 1986 with the New Economic Mechanism have \nhad a positive effect on the Lao economy, there are only few registered private companies.  \n \n7.  Although there have been no investments in Cambodia and Laos for Mekong Enterprise \nFund  I,  the  Fund  manager  recognizes  strategic  value  in  keeping  its  investment  mandate \nregional to be able to take advantage of such opportunities if they arise in the future. As regional \nintegration progresses, the Fund may also support Vietnamese companies in their expansion to \nLaos and Cambodia. \n \nB.  Challenges and Opportunities \n \n1.  Shortage of finance for private sector SMEs \n \n8.  Numerous market distortions still inhibit adequate supply of financing for private sector \ncompanies,  in  particular  SMEs,  including:  prioritized  lending  to  SOEs,  restrictions  on \ncompetition  from  foreign  banks,  high  collateral  requirements,  limited  project  appraisal  and \nbusiness review capacity, and lack of transparent financial information. The supply of financial \nservices  for  SMEs  comes  mainly  from  the  four  big  state-owned  commercial  banks,  which \ndominate the Vietnamese market with around 70% of all lending. The state-owned banks have \nhigh  levels  of  non-performing  loans  and  they  still  face  pressure  to  lend  to  state-owned \nenterprises even when commercial criteria might dictate otherwise. About 70 per cent of new \nbank credit is currently channeled to SOEs and, when agriculture is removed from the other 30 \nper cent, only a very small amount of lending is actually to SMEs. The leasing industry is small \nwith the main leasing companies being subsidiaries of the state-owned banks, and their main \nactivities being lease finance for their parent companies.3 There is an even wider gap with \nrespect to availability of equity finance. Due to legal and regulatory restrictions, foreign investors \nmainly invest through the foreign investment law and not directly into Vietnamese companies.   \n \n9.  The existence of a private equity market is still negligible. The first private equity fund \nwas introduced in Viet Nam in 1991. However, an extremely small private sector, slow economic \nand political reform, and weak domestic capital markets all contributed to a shortage of good \ninvestments at that time.4 The scarcity of attractive investment opportunities combined with the \nlegal and regulatory limitations on foreign investment and the impact of the Asian financial crisis \nresulted in generally poor fund performance. Since 2000 the investment landscape has been \nimproving steadily. As mentioned above, the acceleration of economic and political reform, \n                                                 \n3  Department for International Development, 2003.

Manila. \n ", "    3\nlegislation stimulating the emergence of the private sector, the enactment of trade agreements \nand positive developments in the banking system, such as the opening of a stock exchange in \nJuly 2000, have created a more favorable operating environment for the private equity industry \nand the companies in which it invests. After a prolonged period of almost no activity from 1997 \nto 2001, the private equity industry has restarted operations and new funds have been launched \nin recent years. However, underdevelopment of the stock market constrains the development of \nthe private equity industry. Please refer to appendix 1 for a brief overview of the securities \nmarket in Viet Nam. These factors contribute to an extremely low private equity investment rate \nof  only  0.03%  of  GDP. 5  Equity  flows  are  further  constrained  by  numerous  investment \nrestrictions, particularly on the use of foreign capital, and by the general opacity of the business \nenvironment, particularly for foreign and institutional investors.  \n \n2.  Mekong Capital\u2019s contribution to SME finance and development impact  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n10.  Mekong  Capital  (the  Fund  manager)  has  accumulated  unique  experience  in  SME \nfinance in Viet Nam\u2019s challenging operating and regulatory environment through its first fund, \nthe Mekong Enterprise Fund I, which was launched with the support of ADB. This fund is now \nnearly fully invested. The Fund manager has gained a positive reputation with the companies in \nwhich it has invested, which will make it significantly easier to convince the owners of promising \nprivate companies that want the Fund as an investor to accept the Fund\u2019s governance and \ntransparency  requirements.  The  Fund  manager  has  dedicated  teams  to  add  value  to  the \ninvestee companies in accounting and finance, process improvements and human resource \nimprovements. Since transparent  accounting   is  a   key  constraint  in Viet Nam,  the Fund  \nmanager  has  supported  the investee companies  to  improve accounting  and  financial  \nreporting to provide a foundation for the shareholders and managers to make well-informed \ndecisions.  The  Fund  manager  has  also  built  a  strong  core  competency  in  manufacturing \nprocess improvement, which is highly appreciated by portfolio companies and critical for future \nvalue creation. The Fund management team has demonstrated that it is able to introduce and \npromote  best  practices  in  Six  Sigma,6  lean  manufacturing;  activity  based  costing,  human \nresource systems and management reporting. This capacity building within portfolio companies \ncontributes  to  sustainable  economic  growth  as  the  Fund  popularizes  best  practices  in \nmanufacturing, finance and administration systems among Vietnamese companies.  \n \n11.  In addition, the Fund plays a key role in improving the corporate governance of its \nportfolio companies thereby removing one of the main impediments to the development of Viet \nNam\u2019s capital markets. The Fund helps to solve this problem by working closely with private \ncompanies to implement high levels of transparency and internal controls, and encouraging and \nsupporting them to be listed on Viet Nam\u2019s stock exchange. In the context of a high aversion to \ntransparency  in  Viet  Nam\u2019s  private  sector,  the  Fund\u2019s  portfolio  companies  set  a  positive \nexample of the benefits of becoming more transparent. \n \n12.  The Fund manager has started to collect data on the predecessor fund\u2019s development \nimpact. In 2004, the predecessor fund\u2019s portfolio companies have added 993 jobs, of which 143 \nwere technical jobs and 26 management jobs. While causality is difficult to establish, it is certain \n                                                 \n5  The private equity investment rate as a share of GDP in 2003 was 0.59% in Singapore, 0.47% in the Republic of \nKorea, but only 0.03% in Viet Nam.

Washington, DC. \n6  Six Sigma  is  a  highly disciplined process that helps organizations focus on developing and delivering near-perfect \nproducts and services. \n ", "4         \nthat the fund\u2019s equity investments made a key contribution to the SMEs\u2019 expansion and future \nprospects.  \n \n  3.  A catalyst for regulatory improvements \n \n13.  As the leading institutional investor in private companies in Viet Nam, the Fund manager \nhas  been  among  the  first  investors  to  encounter  certain  regulatory  hurdles  and  takes  an \norganized approach to addressing and resolving them. For example, recently the Fund manager \nhas  been  raising  issues  related  to  remittance  of  dividends  for  foreign  investors  in  private \ncompanies as well as the ownership restrictions on the industries in which foreign investors can \ninvest in private Vietnamese companies. Mekong Capital maintains a Private Sector Obstacle \nStatus  Report,  which  has  been  well  received  by  various  members  of  the  development \nassistance community. These reports have helped raise awareness of key problems facing \nprivate  sector  companies  in  Viet  Nam  and  investors  in  those  companies.  They  also  help \ninterested parties, including ADB\u2019s Mekong Regional Department and Government agencies, in \ntheir efforts to improve the regulatory environment for private sector development.   \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED FUND \nA.  Objectives and Description \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n14.  The Fund will focus its investment strategy on small and medium-sized enterprises \n(SMEs) with high growth potential in Viet Nam. The Fund may also consider investments in \nCambodia or Laos, but this will be only on an exceptional basis, because physical proximity of \nthe Fund manager to portfolio companies is a crucial factor for successfully investing and \nmonitoring SME equity investments. The average investment size is expected to be $2.5 million.  \n \n15.  The Fund aims to achieve an attractive net internal rate of return (IRR) by investing in \nequity and convertible securities of Vietnamese private and equitized (i.e. privatized) SMEs. The \nFund may also invest in foreign companies or joint ventures with significant operations in Laos, \nCambodia  or  Viet  Nam.  The  Fund\u2019s  primary  focus  will  be  minority  investments,  usually \nrepresenting 20% to 30% of the company\u2019s total equity. The Fund may also engage in buy-outs, \nin which the Fund, either alone or in conjunction with third parties, takes a controlling stake. \nBuy-outs  will  only  be  considered  for  SMEs,  and  will  involve  upgrading  of  management \nprocesses that require the Fund manager to actively add value. The Fund will also have the \nability to invest in companies domiciled in, or having significant operations in, Cambodia and \nLaos.  Fund  manager  closely  monitors  the  development  of  the  private  sector  in  Laos  and \nCambodia, and the experience has been that on an exceptional basis there are companies that \nmight be considered for an investment, in particular in Cambodia. However, it is important to \nnote  that  the  Fund  manager\u2019s  investment  strategy  requires  almost  daily  monitoring  of \ncompanies. Therefore, the Fund manager would have to be represented in Cambodia or Laos, \nwhich requires sufficient deal flow to justify the costs.  \n \n16.  The typical target company for the Fund will most likely have the following characteristics:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "    5\nTable 1: Target Company Characteristics \n \nCharacteristics  US$ million \nAnnual Revenues  5\u201315 \nAnnual net profit  0.5\u20131.5 \nPre-investment valuation  4\u201320 \nAmount of outside equity being sought  1.0\u20135.0 \nExpected average investment size for MEF II  2.5 \n                             Source: Mekong Capital. \n \nB.  Fund Management  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n17.  The Fund will be managed by Mekong Capital (the Fund manager).  Mekong Capital is a \nwell-established private equity fund management company with offices in Ho Chi Minh City. In \norder to make investments in the Hanoi area, and to provide post-investment assistance, the \nFund manager intends  to  open  an  office  in  Hanoi  after  the  initial  closing  of  the Fund.  \nThe Fund manager has promoted and is managing the Mekong Enterprise Fund I (MEF I). This \nis an $18.5 million investment fund, which was launched in April 2002.  \n \n18.  The Fund manager has a strong private equity team in Viet Nam with 12 Vietnamese \ninvestment professionals. The history of the private equity industry is short in Viet Nam, which \ntranslates into scarcity of private equity investment skills. In this context, the Fund manager has \nbeen able to develop systematic and well-documented processes relating to most areas of its \noperations, which has been essential for training investment professionals.  \n \n19.  The Fund\u2019s focus on improving transparency and adding value to its SME portfolio \ncompanies is reflected in its operational structure, which has a different emphasis compared to \nconventional private equity funds. The Fund manager has set up teams with an operational \nbackground who solely focus on recruiting for management positions, improving accounting \nsystems,  enhancing  corporate  governance,  transferring  technology,  and  upgrading \nmanufacturing processes by introducing Six Sigma and lean manufacturing. The resources of \nthese teams, which consist of employees of the Fund manager, can be shared among all \nportfolio companies: \n \n(i)  Accounting  and  finance  team.  The  accounting  and  finance  team  consists \nmainly of former auditor seniors from \u201cbig-4\u201d auditing firms, who are responsible \nfor providing assistance to companies in areas relating to accounting systems, \ninternal  controls  and  financial  management.  Improving  the  transparency  of \nportfolio companies is also a key requirement for achieving a listing on the stock \nmarket. \n \n(ii)  Process improvement team. The process improvement team consists mainly of \nSix Sigma black belts from multinational companies, who are responsible for \nproviding  assistance  to  portfolio  companies  in  areas  relating  to  production \nmanagement,  quality  management,  production  planning,  data  collection  and \ngeneral process improvement.  \n \n(iii)  Recruitment  coordinator.  The  recruitment  coordinator  is  responsible  for \ncoordinating  the  process  of  finding  experienced  managers  for  portfolio \ncompanies.  \n ", "6         \n \n20.  The Fund manager has a strong reputation in the Vietnamese market, which is reflected \nin its ability to build a good investment pipeline for the Fund \n \nIV.  INVESTMENT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Justification of ADB Assistance \n \n1.  Development Impact \n \n21.  By providing financing to the Fund, ADB intends to achieve the following development \nobjectives: \n \n(i)  Mobilization of long-term capital in the form of private equity for SMEs to \nfinance expansion and productivity increases; \n \n(ii)  Diversification of sources of finance available for SMEs by inclusion of \nequity finance, which enables SMEs to buy fixed assets and to use them \nas  collateral  for  commercial  bank  loans  in  order  to  leverage  their \nexpansion.  This  dynamic  process  helps  SMEs  to  become  larger \nenterprises and to eventually raise further capital by listing on a stock \nexchange;   \n \n(iii)  Demonstrating to the private sector that investments in entrepreneurial \nSMEs in the Mekong region can be commercially attractive. The private \nequity industry in this region is still nascent, and ADB\u2019s investment will \nsupport one of the few domestic private equity teams; \n \n(iv)  The Fund manager has developed unique capacity in value addition and \nestablished  dedicated  teams  in  accounting  and  finance,  process \nimprovements and human resource improvements. In particular, the Fund \nwill improve SMEs\u2019 competitiveness by introducing best practices in Six \nSigma,  lean  manufacturing,  activity  based  costing  and  management \nreporting;  \n \n(v)  Improving  the  transparency  and  corporate  governance  of  SMEs,  and \nthereby addressing one of the key constraints of the Mekong region\u2019s \ncapital markets development. In addition, SMEs will increase their tax \ncontributions  as  they  are  required  to  adopt  fully  transparent  financial \nreporting.  \n \n(vi)  The creation of sustainable employment in the SME sector in Viet Nam, \n(and Laos and Cambodia if the fund invests in these countries); \n \n(vii)  Stimulation of private sector development that will serve as a vehicle for \nthe country\u2019s long-term economic progress and stability; \n \n ", "    7\n(viii)  Contribute to the development of a well functioning regulatory and legal \nenvironment through the reporting by the Fund Manager on regulatory \nissues that their SME portfolio companies encounter. This information will \nbe reported on a regular basis to the Mekong Department to support the \nformulation of a conducive regulatory framework for expanding SMEs. \n \n  2.  Value added of ADB  \n \n(i)  Demonstration Effect:  Given the significant risks and challenges facing \npotential investors as well as the nascent nature of Viet Nam\u2019s private \nequity industry, ADB will serve a catalytic role in attracting additional \nprivate equity investors. ADB is playing an active role in structuring the \nFund according to international standards of corporate governance, and \nhas  been  a  strong  partner  of  the  Fund  Manager  since its  launch by \nadvising on the strategy, management and fundraising for MEF I. ADB\u2019s \ninvestment in the Fund will support one of the few domestic investment \nteams and help developing the nascent private equity industry.    \n \n(ii)  Private Sector Development: The Fund, similar to others in which ADB \ninvests, will make a direct contribution to private sector development.  \nThe Fund, with a portion of its funding coming from private investors, will \nemploy market-based mechanisms to develop profitable and sustainable \nenterprises. The Fund will also contribute to the sustainability and growth \nof private enterprises by strengthening their financial structure, improving \ntheir transparency and introducing best practice manufacturing processes.  \n \nB.  Measuring Development Effectiveness \n \n22.  PSOD will measure the expected development outcome of this Fund at the Fund and \nportfolio  company  levels  as  well  as  beyond  the  Fund  by  monitoring  certain  performance \nmeasures throughout the life of the Fund.  \n \n(i)  Business performance (Fund) \n \nOverall profitability of the Fund: gross and net IRR. \n \n(ii)  Economic sustainability (portfolio companies) \n \n(a)  Efficient  allocation  of  finance  and  provision  of  financial  services  to \neconomically viable enterprises. \n \n(i)  Sub-project  economic  performance:  annual  net  profits  and \nrevenues of portfolio companies. \n(ii)  Stronger  local  entrepreneurship:  (a)  number  of  entrepreneurial \nprojects  receiving  finance  from  the  Fund,  and  (b)  number  of \nreturning  entrepreneurs  and  skilled  workers  from  industrialized \ncountries receiving finance and transferring skills. \n(iii)  Contribution to widening the access to finance of SMEs: additional \ndebt raised by subprojects as a result of the equity investments. \n ", "8         \n(iv)  Provision of value-added services enhancing the viability of SMEs: \n(a) number of enterprises advised, and (b) quality of advice in \nfinancial  planning,  expansion  strategies,  human  resource \ndevelopment, accounting standards and corporate governance. \n \n(b)  Direct contribution of portfolio companies to the local economy and living \nstandards. \n \n(i)  Contribution to government revenues: increased amount of taxes \npaid by portfolio companies. \n(ii)  Employment generated: (a) number of jobs created by portfolio \ncompanies, and (b) quality of jobs created by portfolio companies \n(e.g., technical jobs, middle management). \n(iii)  Adoption  of  new  or  improved  technologies  and  production \nprocesses:  (a) increased  investment  in  new  technologies  or \nimproved production processes by portfolio companies, and (b) \nnumber  of  portfolio  companies  implementing  successful  new \ntechnologies. \n \n  (iii)  Private  sector  development  (impact  beyond  the  Fund  and  portfolio \ncompanies) \n \n(i)  New  technology,  development  of  management  skills,  and \nemployee training in the domestic financial sector: (a) number of \nlocal investment professionals in SME private equity trained by the \nFund,  and  (b)  number  of  the  Fund\u2019s  investment  professionals \nraising a subsequent fund in a DMC. \n(ii)  Resource mobilization through private equity: (a) domestic finance \nfor  investments  in  SMEs  mobilized  by  the  Fund,  and \n(b) international finance for investments in SMEs mobilized by the \nFund.  \n(iii)  Positive  effect  on  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  and  its \nadministration: (a) quality and volume of the Fund\u2019s feedback to \nADB  on  improvements  in  the  regulatory  environment,  and \n(b) evidence  of  lobbying  of  the  Fund  for  improvements  in  the \nregulatory framework. \n(iv)  Growth  in  financial  services  in  the  domestic  financial  markets: \n(a) growth in the private equity market in the domestic financial \nsector, and (b) increased access to long-term finance.7 \n   \nV.
