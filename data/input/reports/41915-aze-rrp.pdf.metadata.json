Gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by a \nrecord 34.5% in real terms, the world\u2019s highest growth rate for the second year running. By far, \nthe greatest engine of growth has been the industrial sector, in which value added was up by \njust  over  56%,  bringing  cumulative  growth  in  2005\u20132006  to  almost  150%.  Within  the  industry \nsector, it is the oil and gas sector that is driving the growth. The non-oil economy is still growing \nstrongly, expanding by 11.2% in 2006, but its contribution to GDP is falling as the oil economy \nexpands. Non-oil sectors provided 47% of nominal GDP in 2006, down from 58% a year earlier \nand 61% in 2004. \n \nThe  medium-term  outlook  for  the  economy  of  Azerbaijan  is  positive.  GDP  growth  is \n3. \nexpected  to  continue  posting  high  double-digit  growth  over  the  next  few  years,  mainly  from \nincreased  oil  and  gas  production  and  exports.  Foreign  investment  is  expected  to  decline  over \ntime  as  the  major  oil  and  gas  projects  move  toward  less  intensive  stages.  However,  the \nGovernment of Azerbaijan expects increased domestic public investment to offset some of this \ndecline. Government expenditure rose by over 80% in 2006 and is projected to rise by a further \n50% in 2007, which puts considerable pressure on inflation.1 With the substantial increase in oil \nand  gas  revenues,  and  as  imports  are  expected  to  ease,  the  current  account  surplus  is \nexpected to consolidate further. \n \n4. \nIn the long term, Azerbaijan\u2019s high dependence on oil exports poses a potential threat to \nthe economy given the potential volatility in the international oil market. The main challenge for \nAzerbaijan is to develop the non-oil sector to ensure that the economy continues to grow on a \nsustainable  path  after  the  oil  boom,  meeting  both  short-term  expectations  and  longer-term \ndemands. A key objective is to develop income-generating and new employment opportunities \nin  the  non-oil  sector,  in  such  priority  areas  as  banking  and  finance,  trade,  and  small  and \nmedium-sized enterprise (SME) development.  \n \n5. \nIn February 2007, Fitch Ratings upgraded Azerbaijan's foreign and local currency issuer \ndefault  ratings  to  BB+  from  BB.  Fitch  noted  that  the  country\u2019s  outlooks  remain  stable.  Fitch\u2019s \nupgrade  of  Azerbaijan's  sovereign  ratings  is  justified  by  strong  and  sustainable  economic \ngrowth,  low  government  and  external  debt  ratios,  and  a  growing  current  account  surplus\u2014\nunderpinned by rapidly rising oil and gas production. In September 2006, Moody's assigned a \nforeign and local currency issuer rating of Ba1 to Azerbaijan. \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB  projects  14%  inflation  in  2007.

Manila.  \n\n\f2 \n\n    \n\nB. \n\nBanking Sector in Azerbaijan  \n\n6. \nDespite  tremendous  economic  development,  Azerbaijan's  banking  sector  is  one  of  the \nweakest among the sovereigns rated by Fitch.2 The depth of bank intermediation activity is low \n(system  assets  were  equivalent  to  only  17%  of  GDP  as  of  the  end  of  2006).  The  provision  of \nfinancial services to households and the private sector is very limited\u2014only an estimated 10% \nof  the  total  population  has  bank  accounts,  reflecting  low  confidence  in  the  banking  sector. \nFinancial  services  have  mainly  been  provided  to  the  oil,  construction,  and  trade  sectors\u2014\nleaving the retail and SME sectors notably underserved. \n \n7. \nBanking sector deposits have grown rapidly but remain low, and are not commensurate \nwith  Azerbaijan\u2019s  level  of  development.  According  to  the  National  Bank  of  Azerbaijan  (NBA), \ndeposits  rose  by  50%  in  2006  to  AZN2.0  billion,  an  estimated  11%  of  GDP.  Although \ndollarization  continues  to  persist  in the  banking  sector,  the  share  of  deposits  held  in  AZN  has \nincreased  notably  over  the  past  year,  at  least  in  part  because  of  the  appreciation  of  the  local \ncurrency against the US dollar. By November 2006, 37% of total deposits were held in AZN, up \nfrom just 20% at the end of 2005. \n \n8. \nAzerbaijan\u2019s  commercial  banks  have  used  the  rapidly  growing  deposit  base  to  expand \ntheir  loan  portfolios\u2014an  important  and  positive  development  given  the  marginal  financial \nintermediation  role  that  they  have  played  in  the  economy  to  date.  As  of  December  2006, \nconsolidated  lending  by  banks  was  AZN2.36  billion,  up  64%  from  the  previous  year.  By \nApril 2007, consolidated lending by banks reached AZN2.87 billion. However, despite the large \nincrease  in  the  deposit  base,  it  is  still  too  small  to  meet  the  growing  demand  for  financial \nservices, especially from SMEs.  \n \n9. \nThe  private  and  state-owned  commercial  banks  each  provide  about  48%  of  total  loans \noutstanding,  with  the  remainder  coming  from  non-bank  institutions.  However,  most  private \nbanks focus exclusively on lending to the private sector, primarily individual entrepreneurs and \nSMEs.  Because  of  their  small  size  and  customer  focus,  the  banks  provide  mainly  small  and \nmicro loans and typically do not serve the oil and gas sector. \n \nA  particular  concern  in  the  banking  system  is  the  ratio  and  quality  of  capitalization, \n10. \nparticularly as credit continues to grow rapidly. In response to this, the authorities have worked \nto improve the supervision of the banking system. Minimum capital requirements will be raised \nfrom AZN6.4 million to AZN10.0 million by July 2008, which is expected to translate into further \nconsolidation  and  mergers,  resulting  in  fewer  and  better  capitalized  banks.  This  is  a  positive \nstep toward strengthening the financial system in Azerbaijan. Currently, only 10 of Azerbaijan\u2019s \n44 banks have AZN10.0 million in capital.   \n \nDespite substantial support from multilateral and bilateral agencies, most private banks \n11. \nare expected to remain illiquid and undercapitalized in the medium term. State-owned banks will \ncontinue  to  dominate  the  sector.  Together  with  continued  strong  economic  growth,  this  will \nensure  that  the  risk  of  a  banking  crisis  is  low.  In  February  2007,  a  presidential  decree  was \nenacted  that  called  for  the  privatization  of  Kapital  Bank.  The  privatization  of  one  of  two  of  the \ncountry\u2019s  state-owned  banks  will  be  a  welcome  step  in  opening  up  the  banking  system  to  a \nmore competitive environment.  \n \n \n\n                                                 \n2 Fitch Ratings.

Bank Systematic Risk Report. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 3\n\nC. \n\nSmall and Medium-Sized Enterprises in Azerbaijan \n\n1. \n\nOverview  \n\nSMEs  account  for  about  80%  of  registered  private  businesses  operating  in  Azerbaijan, \n12. \nand represented an estimated 10% of GDP in the past 5 years. SMEs are the biggest source of \ndomestic employment outside of the public sector, providing livelihood for over three quarters of \nthe  country\u2019s  workforce.  An  estimated  70%  of  SMEs  are  located  in  Baku  and  the  Absheron \nPeninsula,  and  have  limited  capacity  for  business  and  regional  expansion,  and  new  export \nopportunities.   \n \n13. \nThe importance of SMEs in relation to general economic vitality is widely acknowledged. \nStudies  have  shown  that,  in  most  countries,  SMEs  and  the  informal  sector  account  for  about \n45\u201375%  of  employment  and  65\u201370%  of  GDP,  regardless  of  the  development  stage  of  the \neconomy. 3  The  development  of  SMEs  is  therefore  crucial  to  the  development  of  the  non-oil \nsector in Azerbaijan.    \n \n14. \nOne  of  the  biggest  hurdles  facing  SMEs  in  Azerbaijan  today  is  the  lack  of  access  to \nfinance.  This  problem  has  been  identified  and  recognized  by  both  the  Government  and  the \ndonor community as a key constraint to SME development, especially outside Baku. \n \n\n2. \n\nGovernment Efforts \n\n15. \nThe Government continues to support SME growth and improved business environment. \nIn the past 2 years, the state policy has shifted from providing direct aid to SMEs to improving \nthe regulatory and business infrastructure to facilitate the development of the private sector. In \nconsultation with the World Bank\u2019s Doing Business Team, the Government has identified a list \nof urgent measures and actions to simplify business regulations in the country.  \n \n16. \nIn  2005,  the  Government  completed  the  2-year  state  program  for  SME  development. \nThe  major  objectives  of  the  program  were:  (i)  creation  and  development  of  legal  and  physical \ninfrastructures for efficient operation of SMEs; (ii) expansion of the foreign economic activity of \nSMEs  and  export  promotion;  and  (iii)  expansion  of  opportunities  for  financial  and  investment \nassistance for SMEs.  \n \n17. \nTo  help  alleviate  the  problem  of  lack  of  financing  faced  by  SMEs,  the  Azerbaijani \nGovernment established a special state budget fund for SME development, supervised by the \nMinistry  of  Economic  Development.  The  fund  is  expected  to  disburse  a  total  of  $94  million  in \n2007  for  various  SME  projects  via  25  private  bank  agents,  1  nonbank  institution,  and  5  credit \nunions. While the loan size varies from $50,000 to $1 million, the annual interest rate is limited \nto  7%  (market  rates  are  in  the  range  of  15\u201320%).  However,  the  Ministry  of  Economic \nDevelopment  recognizes  that  (i)  the  fund  should  not  be  a  continuing  source  of  subsidized \nfinancing  for  SMEs,  and  (ii)  private  banks  have  to  look  actively  for  external  sources  to  reduce \nmarket lending rates. In mid-2007, the Ministry of Economic Development is expected to revise \nthe  fund\u2019s  charter  in  accordance  with  a  new  draft  of  the  second  state  program  on  SME \ndevelopment to be approved in early 2008 \n.  \n\n                                                 \n3  SMEs and Poverty Reduction, a Report for the Ford Foundation's Affinity Group on Development Finance (AGDF) \nSmall and Medium Enterprise (SME) Committee by CFED, 2004.

It  has \ntwo  major  lines  of  business\u2014retail  and  corporate  banking  (except  asset  management  and \ninvestment banking services). It has a significant presence in the retail sector, which accounts \nfor about 60% of its business. It is also the third largest issuer of plastic cards in Azerbaijan.  \n \n19. \nOne  of  the  first  commercial  banks  in  Azerbaijan,  BOB  was  registered  on  14  February \n1994  originally  under  the  name  of  Tugay  Bank.  The  key  founder  of  BOB  was  the  Turkish \ncompany  Nab  D\u0131\u015f  Ticaret.  On  10 February  1997,  BOB\u2019s  name  was  changed  to  Bank  of  Baku \nand it was reregistered as a joint stock commercial bank in August 1997. \n \n20. \nBOB\u2019s  client  base  began  to  grow  beyond  serving  its  corporate  owners  when,  in  May \n2001, it partnered with Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW) to provide credit to SMEs under the \nGermany-Azerbaijan fund. To date, BOB is the largest participant in the program. In 2002, BOB \ndecided  to  broaden  its  focus  on  retail  services,  while  further  developing  its  SME  products. \nEfforts to target the SME market received a further boost from a credit line with the European \nBank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in February 2004.   \n \n21. \nIn February 2005, BOB was merged with OJSC \u0130lkbank, making it one of the 10 largest \nbanks in the country.4 The merger was a consolidation of BOB\u2019s strength in retail banking and \n\u0130lkbank\u2019s strength in corporate banking. As of 31 March 2007, BOB had 287 full-time employees \nwith 207 staff at the branches.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nPROPOSED ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nOverview \n\n22. \nProposed assistance to BOB from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will be in the form \nof:  (i)  a  senior  secured  term  loan  of  up  to  $4  million  (ADB  US  dollar  loan),  and  (ii)  a  senior \nsecured term loan of up to $2 million equivalent in local currency (ADB AZN loan).    \n \nB. \n\nMain Terms and Conditions \n\nThe  ADB  US  dollar  loan  will  have  a  maturity  of  up  to  5  years,  with  an  amortizing \n\n23. \nrepayment structure.  \n \n24. \nThe ADB AZN loan will have a maturity of up to 2 years. ADB would buy local currency \nspot at financial close. To protect ADB from any foreign exchange downturn, the repayment of \nthe ADB AZN loan will be linked to the AZN/US dollar exchange rate and capital protected. The \ncoupon will have a built in AZN/US dollar swap, which will be structured and priced to allow ADB \nto participate in AZN upward movements.  \n \n25. \nThe ADB US dollar loan and ADB AZN loan, sourced from ordinary capital resources, will \ncarry  an  interest  rate  based  on  the  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)  plus  a  margin \ndetermined  by  ADB's  credit  enhancement  and  pricing  committee.  The  committee  will  also \ndetermine the up-front and commitment fees.  \n \n                                                 \n4 The share capital of the newly merged bank was formed in equal amounts by BOB and \u0130lkbank.   \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 5\n\nProceeds  of  the  proposed  loans  will  be  used  by  BOB  for  onlending  to  SME  clients  in \n26. \nAzerbaijan.   The  proposed  loans  will  be secured  by  the  rights  and  receivables  under  the  sub-\nloans. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND ASSUMPTIONS \n\nA. \n\nJustification for ADB Investment \n\n1. \n\nDevelopment Outcome \n\n27. \n \n\n(i) \n\nThe proposed ADB assistance will promote development at the following key levels: \n\nIncreased  access  to  finance  for  SMEs.  SMEs  play  a  significant  role  in  all  of \nADB\u2019s  developing  member  country  (DMC)  economies  and  are  key  drivers  of \nemployment,  economic growth,  and  development.  They  often  have  a  significant \nimpact on the GDP and in most cases grow faster than state-owned enterprises. \nThe development of SMEs is therefore an important engine of growth and a key \ncontributor  to  poverty  reduction  by  creating  employment,  increasing  individual \nincomes, and generating tax revenues. \n \nSMEs  rely  heavily  on  access  to  external  capital  to  finance  their  operations. \nHowever,  in  most  of  ADB\u2019s  DMCs,  SMEs  have  difficulty  accessing  financial \nservices  and  securing  financing.  Although  bank  loans  are  dominating  any \nexternal  financing  (because  of  the  underdeveloped  corporate  bond  markets), \nonly a small number of SMEs in the region have access to bank lending (mostly \nonly  for  working  capital).  In  most  DMCs,  lack  of  access  to  bank  lending  is \nconsidered the main financing difficulty and an obstacle for sustaining the growth \nof  SMEs.  This  is  no  different  in  Azerbaijan.  Appendix  1  discusses  the \ndevelopment impact of SME finance and Appendix 2 analyzes the SME financing \ngap in Asia.  \n \nThe  proposed  assistance  will  allow  BOB \nfinancial \nintermediation to SMEs, in line with its strategic plans. The increased availability \nof  capital  or  funding  to  SMEs  would  help  in  promoting  their  operations  and \nprofitability  and  enhancing  their  competitiveness,  contributing  to  private  sector \ndevelopment and translating into sustainable economic growth in Azerbaijan.   \n \nPromote  development \nin  the  non-oil  sector.  Azerbaijan\u2019s  economy  is \ndominated  by  the  oil  sector  and  is  expected  to  remain  so  for  the  foreseeable \nfuture. In the absence of further oil discoveries, the country\u2019s oil wealth is set to \npeak  relatively  early.  As  such,  the  diversification  of  the  economic  base  will \nbecome  an  increasingly  important  means  to  sustaining  growth  and  will  reduce \nthe  country\u2019s  vulnerability  to  a  sustained  fall  in  oil  prices.  The  proposed \ntransaction, which will indirectly lead to increased lending to SMEs that, as of the \npresent,  have  limited  access  to  bank  financing,  will  support  the  creation  of \nemployment opportunities for a broader portion of the population, outside the oil \nand gas sector.   \n \nSupport  the  emerging  private  banking  sector. The proposed intervention will \nhelp  strengthen  the  banking  sector  at  a  critical  point  in  its  development  and \nenhance confidence in the county\u2019s banking system. The private banking sector \n\nto  provide  increased \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n    \n\nis small and underdeveloped, and not fully able to mobilize the available liquidity \nand  channel  it  toward  SME  investment  through  extension  of  credit.  Support  for \nthe  growth  of  a  promising  and  well-managed  private  bank  will  contribute  to  the \nshift  away  from  the  state-owned  banks\u2019  dominance  of  the  sector.  As  private \nbanks  are  a  key  source  of  small  and  micro  loans  for  the  private  sector,  in \nparticular  individual  entrepreneurs  and  SMEs,  they  are  critical  to  the  economy \n(state-owned banks are not geared to service SMEs, particularly private ones).    \n \nNew and innovative way of local currency funding. ADB is introducing a new \nand  innovative  form  of  local  currency  financing.  This  particular  structure can  be \nreplicated by BOB and other banks in Azerbaijan to gain access to local currency \nfunding,  thereby  reducing  currency  mismatches.  Although  Azerbaijan  is  still \nheavily  dollarized,  local  currency  lending  is  on  the  rise  given  the  ongoing \nappreciation of the AZN. \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\n2. \n\nValue Added by the Asian Development Bank \n\n28. \nADB\u2019s partnership with BOB will further enhance its reputation in the market, improving \nits  ability  to  raise  long-term  deposits  and  issue  bonds.  This  in  turn  will  allow  BOB  to  better \nmanage and reduce the risk of maturities mismatch. ADB\u2019s proposed loans will also allow BOB \nto  expand  its  SME  loan  portfolio,  while  deposit  growth  catches  up  with  loan  growth.  This \ntranslates into higher financing intermediation available to the SME sector.   \n \n29. \nADB  will encourage and support BOB\u2019s adoption of better practices for critical banking \nfunctions  (e.g.,  credit,  asset  liability  management,  anti-money  laundering,  anticorruption,  and \nenvironmental safeguard policies and procedures).  \n \n\n3. \n\nDesign and Monitoring Framework \n\nADB  will  measure  the  expected  development  outcome  of  the  loans  in accordance with \n\n30. \nthe Design and Monitoring Framework (Appendix 3).  \n \n\n4. \n\nFit to Country and Sector Strategy \n\n31. \nIn response to ADB\u2019s draft country strategy and program initiating paper for Azerbaijan, \nthe Government has specifically requested ADB to focus on four priority areas: transport, water \nsupply  and  sanitation,  renewable  energy,  and  private  sector  development. 5   Private  sector \ndevelopment is an integral component of the Government\u2019s sustainable development strategy, \nwhich is also an important thematic priority for ADB. Support for private sector development is \nalso consistent with ADB\u2019s country strategy and program updates for Azerbaijan and the interim \noperational strategy for Azerbaijan.6  \n \n32. \nADB  has  the  opportunity  to  play  a  significant  role  in  private  sector  development  in \nAzerbaijan,  with  a  number  of  possibilities  for  private  sector  operations  in  activities  that  could \nserve  as  important  demonstration  projects  with  a  catalytic  effect  on  regional  economic \ndevelopment. The deepening of financial intermediation, especially to SMEs, is crucial to private \nsector  development.  SMEs  typically  generate  the  most  new  jobs;  introduce  locally  (and \n                                                 \n5 Letter to ADB from the Ministry of Economic Development dated 27 October 2006. \n6 Five country strategy and program updates (CSPUs) have been prepared to better reflect the changing needs and \ndevelopment priorities of Azerbaijan.

SME development is, thus, \na critical component of pro-poor growth strategies and is an important focus for ADB and other \nmultilateral and bilateral development institutions. \n \n33. \nIn March 2006, ADB\u2019s Board of Directors approved a private sector project involving the \nprovision of a financing package of up to $15 million consisting of equity investments and loans \nto  privately  owned  banks  and  leasing  companies  in  Azerbaijan.7  This  was  ADB\u2019s  first  private \nsector  operations  project  in  Azerbaijan.  Since  then,  the  Capital  Markets  and  Financial  Sector \nDivision  (PSCM)  of  the  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  (PSOD)  has  invested \nconsiderable  effort  in  exploring  new  opportunities  and  strengthening  client  relationships.  ADB \ncontinues its dialogue with various banks in the country, in line with ADB\u2019s focus on the banking \nsector to improve financial intermediation to the non-oil sector. This Project is a continuation of \nthose efforts. \n \nThe  proposed  loans  are  also  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy, 8   which \n34. \nstates  that ADB  seeks  to  promote  \u201csound  and  efficient  banking  systems  and  capital  markets,\u201d \nsince  these  are  seen  as  \u201cindispensable  for  macroeconomic  stability,  mobilizing  savings,  and \nensuring availability of long-term financing, an essential requirement for pro-poor growth\u201d. \n \nB. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Safeguard Policies  \n\n35. \nThe  proposed  loans  are  classified  category  FI  (financial  intermediary)  under  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002).  BOB  will  be  required  to  establish  an  environmental  management \nsystem that will cover the environmental assessment procedures of all sub-loans to be financed \nwith  ADB  funds.  The  proposed  loans  are  classified  category  C  under  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary \nResettlement  Policy  (1995)  and  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998),  as  no  involuntary \nresettlements  or  adverse  impacts  on  indigenous  peoples  are  foreseen  in  relation  to  any \nactivities of BOB. The environmental policies of EBRD are already in place. ADB will ensure that \nBOB\u2019s  existing  environmental  management  system,  which  is  based  on  EBRD  standards, \nconforms  to  ADB  standards.  Significant  environmental  impacts  are  not  expected,  as  BOB  will \nuse  proceeds  of  the  proposed  loans  for  onlending  exclusively  to  SMEs  (verified  during  due \ndiligence). \n \nC. \n\nAnticorruption  Policy,  Combating  Money  Laundering,  and  the  Financing  of \nTerrorism \n\n36. \nBOB has been advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and \npolicy  on  combating  money  laundering  and  the  financing  of  terrorism. 9   Consistent  with  its \ncommitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  will  require  BOB \nthrough  covenants  in  the  loan  documentation  to  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with  internal \nprocedures  and  controls  following  international  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of \npreventing  corruption  or  money  laundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism,  and  to \ncovenant with ADB to refrain from engaging in such activities.  \n\n                                                 \n7  To  date,  a  total  of  $12  million  of  loans  have  been  disbursed:  $4  million  to  Microfinance  Bank  of  Azerbaijan, \n\n$4 million to Azerigazbank, and $4 million to Bank Respublika. \n\n8 ADB. 1999.

In \nturn, such growth and modernization are associated with general poverty reduction. SMEs play \na  crucial  role  in  driving  economic  growth  in  both  developing  and  developed  countries.  They \ntypically  generate  the  most  new  jobs;  introduce  locally  (and  sometimes  globally)  relevant \ninnovative  ideas,  products,  and  business  methods;  and  can  push  economic  reform  and  the \nmodernization of uncompetitive economies. \n \n2. \nstrategies: \n \n\nSME  development  is  also  often  seen  as  a  critical  component  of  pro-poor  growth \n\nSMEs generate many of the new jobs in the economy. Since many of these jobs \nare  suitable  for  semiskilled  or  unskilled  workers,  they  can  be  taken  up  by  the \npoor. \n\nSMEs introduce business methods, products, and services that help restructure \nweak  agricultural  sector  or  other  uncompetitive  transition  economies,  thereby \nabsorbing labor that would otherwise drop into the ranks of the poor. \n\nSMEs  help  spread  the  benefits  of  economic  growth  by  engaging  low-income \ngroups  in  national  development.  They  form  dynamic  supply  chain  linkages \nbetween small-scale producers and lucrative urban, national, or export markets.  \nIn  the  reverse  direction,  they  link  large  urban  business  with  mass  consumer \nmarkets in remote areas. \n\n3. \n\nThe following are the effects of SMEs on poverty: \n\nRemoval  of  bias  against  labor-intensive  production. The removal of market \ndistortions  that  lead  to  a  bias  against  labor-intensive  production  techniques \nshould  have  a  clearly  positive  impact  in  reducing  poverty.  Reducing  poverty \nmay improve the environment for SME expansion, so that these efforts can be \nexpected to be mutually reinforcing. Although the expansion of SMEs may not \nbe  sufficient  for  poverty  reduction,  the  likely  positive  effects\u2014through  the \nfamilies  of  SMEs  employees,  better  utilization  of  more  general  aid  donor \ninterventions  across  firms,  and  the  resulting  acceleration  of  human  and \ncommunity  development\u2014make  it  plausible  to  suppose  that  there  is  an \nenormous \u201cvalue\u201d in fighting poverty by investing in SMEs. \n\nThe  effect  of  employing  relatively  low  skilled  workers.  It  is  likely  that  both \nSMEs  and  their  suppliers,  on  average,  employ  a  greater  share  of  local,  low \nskilled  workers  than  large  firms  or  suppliers  to  large  firms.  Since  these \nworkers  plausibly  spend  a  larger  share  of  their  income  on  other  products \nproduced by less skilled workers, there is more likely to be a positive multiplier \neffect  on  the  alleviation  of  poverty  through  SME  support  than  through \ndevelopment projects that lack this focus. \n\n                                                 \n1    SEAF.  The  development  impact  of  small  and  medium  enterprises:  lessons  learned  from  SEAF  investments. \n\nVolume 1.Washington: Small Enterprises Assistance Funds.  \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(i)  \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n     Appendix 1 \n\n \n(iii)  \n\n \n(iv)  \n\n \n(v) \n\nLinkage to small suppliers. It is plausible that SMEs have more supply links \nthan  large  firms  to  the  local  economy,  given  their  small  size  or  lesser \nsophistication,  which  would  generally  inhibit  sourcing  directly  from  abroad. \nSMEs probably import fewer intermediate goods than large firms, suggesting \na  larger  local  multiplier  effect.  It  is  also  a  reasonable  hypothesis  that  SMEs \nbuy a greater percentage of these products from labor-intensive SMEs. This, in \nturn,  should  lead  to  a  greater  expansion  of  sustainable,  local,  employment \nbenefits. \n\nSecurity  of  employment.  When  employees  leave  microenterprises  to  accept \nSME  employment,  their  wage  incomes  are  likely  to  rise  and  become  less \nvariable, making it easier to plan for their families\u2019 welfare. \n\nImpact on children through employment of mothers. If investment in an SME \nraises the incomes of poor mothers with small children, the impact on poverty \ncan  be  great.  Development  microeconomics  consistently  shows  that  a  much \nlarger fraction of an extra dollar earned by a mother goes to the welfare of her \nchildren than of an extra dollar earned by the father. This holds for spending \non  children\u2019s  health  and  education,  as  well  as  home  improvements  and  other \nimportant factors. The impact is especially significant for daughters.  \n\n(vi)   Magnified impact on poverty reduction among very poor people. Targeting \na  small  number  of  very  poor  people  provides  greater  social  benefits  than \ntargeting a larger number of less poor people. Thus, to the degree that SMEs \nhire  relatively  poor  people,  the  impact  of  any  given  income  increase  on \npoverty  would  be  magnified.  Given  the  correlation  between  wage  level  and \nskill  level,  the  tendency  of  SMEs  to  hire  more  unskilled  people  than  larger \nenterprises suggests that this magnified impact is likely at the SME level. \n\n \n(vii)   SME  tax  payments.  Tax  revenues  are  used  to  implement  poverty  impacting \nprograms, such as local infrastructure improvements, health services, or school \nmeals. Since SMEs contribute more tax revenue than microenterprises (which \nin  practice  may  pay  few  or  no  taxes)  or  large  firms  (which  can  often  find \nloopholes or use their influence to pay less than statutory tax rates), support to \nSMEs could be expected to have a greater indirect impact on poverty reduction \nthan other forms of developmental assistance.  \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n 11\n\nSMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISE FINANCING GAP IN ASIA  \n \n\n1. \nRestricted  access  to  formal  credit  is  one  of  the  main  challenges  faced  by  small  and \nmedium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Asia today, and often hinders them from developing their \nfull  potential.  Whereas  all  types  of  firms  mostly  rely  on  retained  earnings,  SMEs  are  more \ndependent on these funds than large firms.   \n\n2. \nThe larger the firm, the easier is access to bank credit and the better the loan conditions \nit  receives.  Loans  to  large  customers  are  encouraged  by  banks  through  employee  incentive \nschemes,  which  are  often  based  on  the  amount  of  credit  granted.  In  addition,  a  vast  array  of \nalternatives  to  domestic  bank  loans  are  available  to  large  firms,  e.g.,  recourse  to  capital  or \ninternational  financial  markets,  augments  their  bargaining  power  in  negotiation  a  loan.  In \ncontrast  to  large  firms,  SMEs  are  often  unable  to  cover  their  financing  needs.  Since  SMEs \nreceive  less  finance  or  face  worse  conditions  than  larger  firms,  they  are  at  a  competitive \ndisadvantage. Without sufficient long-term finance, SMEs are unable to expand their business \nand introduce productivity enhancing technology.   \n\nThe  limitation  of  banking  services  available  to  SMEs  is  mainly  due  to  the  following \n\n3. \nreasons. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nState-owned  banks  (as  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China)  are  not  geared  to \nservice SMEs, particularly private ones.  \nOther banking institutions have limited coverage and financial products. The high \nfrequency  and  short-term  nature  of  SME  loans,  unfamiliar  markets,  ownership \nstructures  that  are  often  complicated,  and  lack  of  sufficient  and  reliable \noperational  and  financial  data  for  loan  appraisal  have  resulted  in  high  business \ndevelopment and administration costs for banks. Because of the long process of \nrecognition, registration, and evaluation for the SME borrower\u2019s collateral, banks \nhave difficulties meeting the SMEs\u2019 frequent and seasonal demand for debt.  \nTo reduce nonperforming loans, many commercial banks have adopted a policy \nof permanently assigning the responsibility of loan performance to loan officers. \nThis has resulted in acute risk aversion at the subbranch and loan officer level, \ncurtailing the amount of loans to SMEs. \n\n(v) \n\n(iv)  Most  developing  member  countries  (DMCs)  lack  a  diversified  financial  sector \ncapable of serving SMEs, i.e., focused financial institutions that are specialized in \nproviding loans for SMEs are missing or are only marginal market participants.  \nIn many markets, credit allocation is distorted by continued policy lending through \ngovernment-owned  banks,  and  restrictions  on competition  from  foreign financial \ninstitutions. \nIn  many  instances,  regulated  (domestic)  bank  lending  rates  do  not  allow \ndomestic banks to price risks appropriately and therefore, banks shy away from \nthis asset, which is often perceived as highly risky. However, this is not true for \nall  cases,  if  appropriate  protection  is  sought  and  thorough  due  diligence  is \nundertaken. \n\n(vi) \n\nBanks cite four main reasons for their reluctance to extend credit to SMEs.  \n\n \n4. \n \n5. \nHigh Administrative Costs of Small-Scale Lending. Since most of the administrative \ncosts of lending are fixed, i.e., independent of the size of the administered loan, economies of \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n     Appendix 2 \n\nscale  arise\u2014the  larger  the  loan,  the  lower  the  unit  costs  of  extending  credit.  Furthermore, \nadministrative  costs  also  include  information  gathering  costs,  e.g.,  visiting  borrowers, \nanalyzing their applications, and monitoring their loans. For a number of reasons, these costs \ntend  to  be  higher  for  small  than  for  large  firms.  SMEs  are  often  located  away  from  the  main \nurban  centers,  their  accounting  skills  and  standards  are  usually  lower,  and  banks  lack \nexperience in servicing them. \n\n6. \nAsymmetric  Information.  A  prerequisite  for  the  efficient  allocation  of  resources  by \nmarket forces is that all participants share the same relevant information. This is not the case in \nfinancial markets. Borrowers will always know more about the viability of their projects and their \nability  and  willingness  to  repay  than  lenders.  The  lender  is  thus  faced  with  uncertainty\u2014both \nwith respect to the expected rates of return of the project he is financing, as well as the integrity \nof the borrower. This uncertainty increases with the length of the loan. Borrowers face difficulties \nin  transmitting  information  about  their  projects  to  lenders,  as  lenders  will  suspect  them  of \nunderestimating  the  risks  of  failure.  The  problem  of  asymmetric  information  is  more  acute  for \nSMEs than larger firms because of lower information standards and greater variability of risk\u2014\nsmall, privately owned firms face no legal reporting requirements and are more vulnerable \nthan large firms. \n \n7. \nBecause  of  asymmetric  information,  it  is  impossible  to  distinguish  accurately \nbetween  good  and  bad  borrowers.  The  two  main  problems  associated  with  asymmetric \ninformation are adverse selection and moral hazard, both of which may affect the quality \nof  the  loan.  Adverse  selection  refers  to  the  fact  that  the  probability  of  default  increases \nwith  the  interest  rate\u2014the  quality  of  the  borrower  pool  worsens  as  the  cost  of  borrowing \nrises. A higher interest rate will attract risky borrowers and drive out good borrowers for \ntwo  reasons:  (i)  worse  risks  are  willing  to  borrow  at  higher  interest  rates  because  they \nknow  that  their repayment probability is low; and (ii)  if riskier projects are associated  with \nhigher returns, a rise in the interest rate will drive out low-risk projects as borrowers  try to \ncompensate for the higher cost of the loan by earning a higher return with a risky project. \nAn  optimal  interest  rate  may therefore exist,  beyond  which additional loans  are  not  made \navailable despite excess demand. Consequently, a backward-bending credit supply curve \nand  equilibrium  credit  rationing  will  exist  because  raising  the  interest  rate  above  the \noptimal  level  would  lower  banks\u2019  profits  as  the  amount  of  risky  projects  in  their  portfolio \nrises (Stiglitz & Weiss, 1981). SMEs are more likely to be rationed because they are seen \nas  particularly  risky.  Although  they  might  be  willing  to  pay  more  to  compensate  for  this \nadditional  risk,  banks  will  refuse  to  raise  the  interest  rate  sufficiently  to  equate  supply \nand demand. \n \n8. \nMoral hazard refers to a situation in which an agent (the borrower) takes an action that \nadversely  affects  the  return  to  the  principal  (the  lender).  It  occurs  if  the  parties  involved \nhave diverging interests and the action taken by the agent cannot be monitored accurately \nby  the  principal.  A  borrower  may,  for  example,  be  tempted  to  exert  less  effort  or  secretly \nswitch  to  riskier  projects  in  order  to  increase  his  return.  Because  of  a  higher  probability  of \ndefault,  the return  to  the  bank  will be  reduced.  Banks can resort  to two  methods  to  reduce \nmoral  hazard:  (i)  by  making  it  profitable  to  tell  the  truth,  e.g.,  through  the  promise  of \nrenewed  credit  in  the  future;  and/or  (ii)  by  including  penalties  for  low  effort  levels, \ne.g., collateral,  which  are  lost  if  the  firm  becomes  insolvent.  Because  of  information \nimperfections  and  costly  control  mechanisms,  the  superior  selection  criteria  based  on  cash-\nflow  projections  is  often  abandoned  in  favor  of  loan  selection  according  to  firm  size  and \ncollateral.  This  results  in  suboptimal  allocation  of  credit  since  some  firms  with  profitable \nprojects may be deprived of credit simply because of their size or insufficient capital.   \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n 13\n\nHigh  Risk  Perception.  Commercial  banks  tend  to  assign  a  high  risk  to  SMEs  and \n9. \nare reluctant to extend credit to them. Because of their small size and inherent vulnerability \nto market fluctuations, the mortality rates of SMEs are relatively high. These firms are often \nrelatively  young,  and  lack  a  financial  history  and  track  record  of  profitable  projects. \nOrganizational  and  administrative  deficiencies,  lower  quality  management,  and  lack  of \nappropriate  accounting  systems  may  also  compromise  the  accessibility  and  reliability  of \ninformation  from  small  firms  on  their  repayment  capacity.  In  addition,  small  loans  to \nindustry are often classified as personal loans. Therefore, banks may lack concrete figures \nof the level of profitability of loans to small enterprises and what costs they entail. Finally, \nthe relative labor intensity of SMEs implies a high debt-to-asset ratio if loans are made. The \nassociated  vulnerability  and  lack  of  sufficient  and  adequate  collateral  further  limits  the \namount of finance that banks are willing to grant them. \n \n10. \nIn Asia, the disadvantage of SMEs with regard to risk perception is aggravated by a \nnumber of factors. Many SMEs have evolved in the informal economy, making it difficult for \nthem  to  document  their  business  history  and  demonstrate  their  economic  potential. \nAdditionally,  small  entrepreneurs  in  emerging  economies  are  typically  less  skilled  in \nbookkeeping,  marketing,  and  management  than  their  counterparts  in  industrial  countries, \nadding to the risk perception with regard to their projects. This is exacerbated by inadequate \nlegal frameworks, which make the enforcement of contracts difficult for lenders. \n \n11. \nLack of Collateral. Under optimal conditions, the net present value of a firm's profit \nstream  should  determine  the  amount  of  credit  it  receives.  However,  because  of  the \nexistence of asymmetric information, banks base their lending decisions on the amount of \ncollateral available. Collateral acts as a screening device and reduces the risk of lending for \ncommercial banks. By pledging its assets, a borrower signals the quality of its project and \nintention  to  repay.  In  the  case  of  default,  collateral  puts  the  lender  in  a  privileged  position \nwith regard to other creditors. Banks\u2019 acceptance of a certain asset as collateral depends on \nthe present and anticipated transaction costs involved. These include the costs of verifying \nownership  of  assets,  determining  their  value  and  marketability,  as  well  as  the  ease  of \nappropriating  and  access  in  comparison  to  other  lenders.  Despite  its  advantages  for \nlenders,  the  policy  of  demanding  collateral  often  inhibits  SMEs  with  viable  projects  from \nattaining credit. Their lack of adequate collateral arises from their labor intensity and from \nthe low value of their machinery and property. \n \n12. \nIn  Asia,  problems  in  the  legal  system  make  debt  enforcement  and  the  use  of \ncollateral  difficult.  Potential  borrowers  may  be  unable  to  pledge  some  of  their  assets  as \ncollateral  because  they  are  unable  to  prove  they  own  them,  because  of  inappropriately \ndefined  property  rights.  Additionally,  moveable  assets  such  as  machinery  or  livestock, \nwhich  constitute  a  large  share  of  small  firms\u2019  assets,  are  often  excluded  as  collateral. \nSince  movable  property  may  be  difficult  to  store,  its  value  declines  over  time  (equipment \ndepreciates and livestock dies), and inefficient secondary  markets lead to high liquidation \ncosts,  lenders  typically  demand  real  estate  as  collateral  instead.  However,  this  is  likely  to \nbelong to large firms or rich landowners. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nData \nSources/Reporting \nMechanisms \n\n \n \n\u2022  NBA statistics \n \n\n14 \n\n     Appendix 3 \n\n \n\nDesign \nSummary \n\nImpact \n \nThe GDP \ncomposition of the \nAzerbaijan  economy \nis more diversified \n(i.e. more SMEs, in \nmore sectors, \ncontribute to a more \ndiversified economy) \n\nOutcome \n \nBOB provides \nincreased, \nsustainable access to \nfinance to SMEs in \nAzerbaijan, in part in \nlocal currency \n \n\nOutputs \n \n\u2022  ADB provides and \nUSD and AZN \nloans \n\u2022  BOB \n\noperationalizes \nuse of loan \nproceeds \n\n \n\nPerformance \nTargets/Indicators \n\n \n \n\u2022  Percentage of \n\nGDP contributed \nby SME sector \nrises from 10% to \n15% in 5 years \n\u2022  Percentage of \nemployment \ncontributed by \nSME sector rises \nfrom 75% to 85% \nin 5 years \n\n \n \n\u2022  BOB\u2019s number of \noutstanding SME \nloans increases \n(10% in next 24 \nmonths, from 296 \nto 325) \n\n\u2022  BOB\u2019s credit \n\nquality is high \u2013 \nNPL level less \nthan 3.0% \n\n\u2022  BOB\u2019s ROE stays \nabove 18.0% \n\u2022  BOB\u2019S maintains \n\nat least 2.0% ROA \n\n\u2022  BOB\u2019s CAR \n\nremains above \nNBA requirements \n\n \n \n\u2022  As of July 2007, \n\nBOB has $6 million \nin USD equivalent \n\n\u2022  Loan requests \n\nreceived by BOB \nincrease by 15%  \nper annum from \ncurrent levels \n\nAssumptions \nand Risks \n\nAssumptions \n \n\u2022 \n\nIncrease access to \nfinance from banks will \nlead to more SMEs \nreceiving loans and \nexpanding their role in \nthe economy \n\n\u2022  Stable or increased \n\neconomic \ndevelopment in \nAzerbaijan \n\nAssumptions \n \n\u2022  There is demand for \nloans from SMEs \n\u2022  BOB does not breach \ndomestic prudential / \nNBA norms \n\n\u2022  No adverse economic \ndevelopments in \nAzerbaijan \n\n\u2022  No regulatory changes \nfor the banking sector \n\n\u2022  No other exogenous \nfactors that have a \nnegative impact on \nbanking sector \ndevelopment  \n\n \nAssumptions \n \n\u2022  Stability of prevailing \nmarket conditions \n\n\u2022  All regulatory approvals \n\nin place for ADB  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\u2022  BOB\u2019s quarterly and \nannual financial \nstatements \n\n\u2022  Reports specifically \n\nrequested by ADB \n\n \n \n\u2022  BOB\u2019s quarterly and \nannual financial \nstatements \n\n\u2022  Reports specifically \nrequested by ADB \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n 15\n\nActivities with Milestones \n \n1.1 Provide BOB with a $4.0 million loan and $2.0 million loan in local \n\ncurrency by July 2007  \n\u2022  ADB and BOB enter into a loan agreement \n\n \n1.2 Operationalization of loan proceeds by BOB (ongoing). \n\nInputs \n \n\u2022  ADB - $4.0 million + \n$2.0 million in local \ncurrency \n\n\u2022  Origination of (new) client opportunities \n\u2022  Due diligence on clients \n\u2022  Completion of loan agreements with clients \n\u2022  Disbursement of loans to clients \n\n \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank;  BOB  =  Bank  of  Baku;  AZN  =  Azerbaijan  manat;  NBA  =  National  Bank  of  Azerbaijan; \nNPL = non-performing loan; ROA = return on asset; ROE = return on equity; SME = small and medium-sized enterprise. \nSource: ADB. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["Currency Unit\n", "Azerbaijan new manat/s (AZN) \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 15 May 2007) \n", "AZN1.00\n$1.00\n", "$1.0953 \nAZN0.9130 \n", " \n \n", "\u2013 \n \n= \n= \n \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n", " \n", " \n", " \nADB \n \nBOB \nCAR \n \nCSPU   \nDMC \n \nEBRD   \n \nGDP \n \nNBA \n \nSME \n \n \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n \n", "Asian Development Bank \nBank of Baku \ncapital adequacy ratio \ncountry strategy and program update \ndeveloping member country \nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development \ngross domestic product \nNational Bank of Azerbaijan \nsmall and medium-sized enterprise \n", "NOTE \n", " \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", " \nVice President \nDirector General \nDirector \n", " \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n \n", " \nL.
