THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed equity \ninvestment of up to $30,000,000 in the India Agri Business Fund II (Fund II), not to exceed 20% \nof Fund II\u2019s total capital commitments and not resulting in the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nbeing the single largest investor in Fund II.  \n \nII.  THE FUND \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n2.  Description. Fund II, to be established as a company incorporated in Mauritius, will be a \nclosed-end private equity fund (PEF), formed to invest in agribusiness companies in India and \nhaving a target capitalization of $200 million. Fund II is a follow-on fund to India Agri Business \nFund I (Fund I), which raised $120 million in 2008, and invested in similar medium-scale private \nsector agribusiness enterprises. Fund II will be managed by Rabo Equity Management Company \nLtd.  (REMCO,  fund  manager),  also  a  company  incorporated  in  Mauritius,  affiliated  with \nCo\u00f6peratieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank B.A. (Rabobank, sponsor), a prominent global \nagriculture focused bank. Rabobank is the key sponsor of Fund II (and of Fund I) and the majority \nshareholder of REMCO. REMCO will engage Rabo Equity Advisors Private Limited, (REAL, fund \nadviser), a company incorporated in India, as its advisor, to provide investment advisory and \nmanagement services. \n \n3.  Investment identification. ADB has been exploring opportunities to support specific \nsegments  of  the  agriculture  sector.  ADB\u2019s  private  sector  operations  have  used  various \ninstruments and investment vehicles to allocate capital and resources to the agriculture sector: (i) \nsince 2006, about $100 million has been allocated to the sector through credit lines to banks; (ii) \nthe Trade Finance Program has supported about $1.4 billion of food and agriculture trade \ntransactions since 2006; (iii) direct loans and equity investments\u2014ADB has approved four direct \nloans for agribusiness companies, aggregating to $108 million, from August 2012 to August 2013; \nand (iv) investment in sector-neutral PEFs, which further invested in agribusiness-focused private \nenterprises.1 \n \n4.  While there is continuing scope for direct financing, the dedicated, sector-specific PEF \nroute to support agribusiness offers several benefits, such as (i) having a focused market and \ncountry coverage for a large and diversified market like India, and reach to highly specialized \ninvestments; (ii) supplementing the financial intervention with a more pronounced element of \ntechnical and managerial support, which will be provided by a sector-specialist fund manager; (iii) \ncountering the cyclicality and uncertainty of the sector, through a portfolio approach toward \nagribusiness investments; and (iv) partnering with other private and multilateral institutions and \naggregating a higher level of capital, through a leveraging effect. 2 \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n5.  The agriculture sector faces severe challenges relating to (i) diminishing yields from \nfarmlands; (ii) limitations in expanding irrigation and increasing the net sown area; (iii) rapidly \n \n1  A brief discussion of ADB\u2019s experience with PEFs and key lessons relating to their performance has been included \nin Sector Overview (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n2   A short note on agriculture sector-focused PEFs in India and their comparative standing to this investment proposal \nis included in Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "2 \n \nreducing groundwater resources and ever-increasing dependence on farm inputs (principally \nfertilizers) to maintain farm-output levels; (iv) the high level of farm-level and storage wastage \ncaused by poor linkages to markets and distorted pricing policies; and (v) limited value addition, \nwhich constrains rural income and employment levels, encouraging migration to potentially worse \nliving conditions in urban slums, and widening regional imbalances. 3 \n \n6.  In this context, Fund II will create a transmission mechanism to bring improved technology \n(like drought-resistant seeds), advanced resource conservation techniques (like micro irrigation), \nreduced wastage (through agri-infrastructure facilities like granaries and warehouses), and higher \nvalue addition (through primary processing activity in the dairy, fruit and vegetable, and oilseeds \nindustry,) to the farm level. The fund manager\u2019s contribution to the business, technology, and \nfinancial aspects of the investee companies\u2014in addition to the new capital\u2014is expected to \nimprove governance and profitability at the company level, and deliver improved inputs, services, \nand value to the agribusiness sector at the farm level.4 \n \n7.  Fund II will leverage both (i) the sponsor\u2019s agribusiness expert knowledge relating to the \nglobal agricultural value chain, which is well demonstrated through the extensive research, \nadvisory, and commercial banking services of Rabobank in emerging markets, including India; \nand  (ii)  the  fund  manager\u2019s  dedicated  resources  and  preferential  access  to  commercial \nagribusiness opportunities in India, through its India-focused private equity investment strategy, \nwhich has been well demonstrated in the investment selection for Fund I. As such, Fund II, being \na  follow-on  fund,  will  benefit  significantly  from  the  pipeline,  business  linkages  relating  to \norigination, structuring, and funding of new investments and transaction-related cost efficiencies \nemanating from Fund I. \n \n8.  Strategy. The fund manager\u2019s investment approach is based on four central principles: \nachieving attractive entry valuations through proprietary sourcing of deal flow; (ii) proactive risk \nmanagement of the risks associated with execution and expansion; (iii) enhancing value creation \nby advising portfolio companies on their business strategies and operations; and (iv) proactive \nexit planning, including installing back-stop arrangements in all investment structures. Fund II\u2019s \noverall investment objective is to generate returns driven by earnings growth and by providing \nexpansion  capital,  through  a  significant  minority  (or  majority  in  exceptional  cases)  equity \ninvestment in established agribusiness companies, led by experienced management teams; and \nto grow these, within 3\u20135 years, to a size that would be of interest to strategic investors, primarily \nlarger domestic or global private sector players in those segments. \n \n9.  Fund II will pursue an investment strategy similar to that of Fund I, making investments of \n$12 million\u2013$15 million each, in a balanced and diversified portfolio of 10\u201312 established, high-\ngrowth businesses. The fund manager will focus on companies in the agribusiness sector \nservicing domestic demand and with possible export potential that are poised to benefit from \ngrowth  trends  in  the  following  four  subsectors:  (i)  agri  inputs  and  farm  services,  (ii)  agri- \ninfrastructure, (iii) primary processing, and (iv) processed food products and services. The \nfinancial analysis details the Fund I investees, the strategic and operational changes brought \nabout by the fund manager, and their impact on the investees\u2019 performance. It also provides a \nsummary overview of the revenue and earnings of the portfolio companies in Fund I, after \n \n3  Sector Overview (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) gives an overview of the challenges \nfaced by the agriculture sector in India. \n4  Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) gives a snapshot of Fund I investments \nand highlights the diversity of the portfolio, specifically in upstream agribusiness, which is expected to be repeated \nin Fund II. \n \n ", "3 \n \n \ninvestment\u2014highlighting that a significant proportion of companies attained levels at or above \ninitial expectations.5 \n \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n \n1.  Ownership \n \n10.  Fund II will issue share capital to its investors, including the sponsor and investment \nmanager. Fund II\u2019s initial close is set to raise a total of $80 million, from Rabobank ($30 million), \nCDC Group PLC ($30 million), and Development Bank of the Netherlands (FMO) ($10 million), \nalongside ADB\u2019s proposed initial investment of $10 million. After its first close, Fund II will \napproach a wider base of private sector institutional investors, to progress toward its target size \nof $200 million.6 \n \n11.  Mauritius has been categorized as \u201dLargely Compliant\u201d with internationally agreed tax \nstandards, in the latest progress report prepared by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation \nand  Development\u2019s  Global  Forum  on  Transparency  and  Exchange  of  Information  for  Tax \nPurposes.7 Fund II  will  obtain  a tax residency certificate  issued  by the  Mauritius  revenue \nauthorities, and its investments are expected to benefit from Indo\u2013Mauritius treaty arrangements \nfor the avoidance of double taxation, in line with the structure for Fund I. \n \n12.  ADB\u2019s review of Fund II does not give ADB cause to believe that it has been established \nor is being used for cross-border tax evasion, money laundering, or terrorism financing in the \njurisdictions involved in the investment. \n \n13.

The two-tiered structure of an overseas fund manager (REMCO), which will appoint an \nonshore  investment  advisor  (REAL),  is  consistent  with  other  PEF  structures  in India.  This \narrangement allows for a segregation of the fund management and the investment decision- \nmaking  processes.  Fund  I\u2019s  investment  team,  under  REAL,  which  will  also  take  on  the \nresponsibilities as Fund II is operationalized, is comprised of 13 investment professionals (to be \n \n5   Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n6   Ownership, Management, and Governance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) gives  details \nrelating to the ownership, management, and governance of Fund II; and profiles of the key staff and management of \nthe fund manager and the fund adviser. \n7  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. 2013.

For Fund I, all the employees of REAL also co-invested 0.35% of the total capital  amount \ncommitted by Fund I, in each of the portfolio companies. This threshold will be raised to 1.00% \nfor Fund II. This is normally not seen with other PEFs in Asia, and is a very positive factor for \nbringing in greater alignment of interests between Fund II\u2019s investors and the fund manager\u2019s \nteam. It also acts as a source of the team\u2019s long-term commitment. \n \n3.  Governance Structure \n \n19.  The fund manager will follow a rigorous multi-staged, deal evaluation process before a \ntransaction is selected for final investment. In the initial stages, deals are logged in and mapped \nto the pipeline of agribusiness investments in India, assessed by the REAL team, and a rapid \nassessment of the profile of the sponsor and the investment, in terms of risks and feasibility, is \ndone. The database of more than 640 private sector Indian agribusiness transactions assessed \nby the team since 2008, is a critical reference for scanning and assessing new opportunities. \nDeals considered potential opportunities for investment are selected for initial due diligence and, \nwithin this subset, a few are proposed to Fund II\u2019s investment committee for initial approvals. \n \n20.  The investment committee for Fund II will follow a two-stage process. The transactions \nselected  at  the  first  stage  are  subject  to  extensive  due  diligence\u2014financial,  business  and \noperations,  technical,  legal,  accounting  and  forensic  background  checks,  as  well  as  the \nenvironment,  and  health  and  safety  dimensions  of  the  investment.  Only  a  select  few  are \nconsidered  acceptable  and  processed  for  final  decisions  by  the  second-stage  investment \ncommittee. \n \n21.  The data relating to the investment process for Fund I underscore its rigor and the quality \nof investment selection. Of nearly 640 transactions included in the deal flow, only 10% were \nselected for initial due diligence, of which only 25% went on to the detailed due diligence stage, \nand  eventually  Fund I  invested  in 10  of these  640  deals  (a  1.50%  deal  conclusion  level, \nhighlighting a very high level of selectivity). \n \n22.  Fund II will also establish an advisory committee consisting of a minimum of five members, \nselected from among the larger shareholders (limited partner equivalents), including ADB, should \nit invest in Fund II. The role of the advisory committee will be to advise Fund II\u2019s board of directors \non (i) review of valuation of Fund II\u2019s assets, (ii) any proposed deviation in the investment \nobjectives and policies of Fund II, (iii) resolution of any conflicts of interest, (iv) extension of the \ninvestment period and term of Fund II, and (v) provide such advice as   Fund II\u2019s board may \nrequest. \n \nD.

The Assistance \n \n25.  ADB will provide an equity investment of up to $30,000,000 in Fund II, not to exceed 20% \nof Fund II\u2019s total committed capital, and not resulting in ADB being the largest investor in Fund II. \nTo mitigate risks, ADB will initially invest $10 million in the first closing of Fund II, with the balance \nof up to $20 million to be invested in Fund II\u2019s second or final close\u2014provided certain targets \nrelating to Fund I exits and returns, and final Fund II size, are met within the stipulated period. \n \nB.  Financial Analysis of Expected Returns and Assumptions \n \n26.  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)].  \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Exit Strategy \n \n27.  Fund II\u2019s preferred exit strategy, as seen in Fund I, is through trade sales, and, to a \nsignificantly lesser extent, public listings. In the fund manager\u2019s view, many multinationals and \ndomestic conglomerates look to acquire companies in high-growth sectors where they do not \nhave a presence, and will pay a premium for agribusiness companies that have a leading industry \nposition,  geographic  coverage,  strong  corporate  governance  and  accounting  standards, \noperational efficiencies, and stable professional management. The fund manager works toward \ncreating  these  value-enhancing  propositions  and  then  aims  to  deploy  its  local  and  global \nrelationships, principally through Rabobank, toward this end. Most of the investments in Fund I \nhave built-in put option provisions as last-resort exit arrangements. Fund II is expected to follow \na similar approach. \n \n2.  Reporting Arrangements \n  \n28.  Fund II will provide to ADB quarterly unaudited and audited annual reports including \nfinancial statements, a fund overview, and an overview of the portfolio, with information on each \nportfolio company\u2019s performance and valuation, which ADB will review and follow up on as \nappropriate. \n \n29.  ADB will be represented on Fund II\u2019s advisory committee, which advises Fund II on \nmatters such as conflicts of interest and other issues related to fund governance.11 Detailed due \ndiligence has highlighted that Fund I reporting arrangements and disclosure standards match \nexpectations.  Fund  II  will  adopt  similar,  and  some  improved,  reporting  standards  and \narrangements. \n \n \n11  The role of the advisory committee is to represent the interests of Fund II\u2019s investors. It will not participate in Fund \nII\u2019s investment process or make investment decisions. \n \n ", "6 \n \nD.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n30.  ADB\u2019s participation in the first closing, as the nodal Asia-focused development financing \ninstitution (the other existing investors Rabobank, CDC Group PLC, and FMO have also invested \nin Fund I), is expected to have a positive signaling effect on other potential participants, and is \nexpected to facilitate capital mobilization for Fund II. By linking its first-close commitment to exits \nand evidence of the commercial performance of Fund I, ADB is indirectly increasing the prospects \nfor expedited capital raising, as this record will bolster the confidence of second- round private \nsector investors, who will place higher emphasis on commercial returns. This approach draws \nsignificantly from the lessons learnt from ADB\u2019s previous PEF investments. \n \n31.  ADB will also establish better standards and measurement frameworks for capturing the \ndevelopment- and safeguards-related aspects of Fund II\u2019s performance as its capital is deployed. \nThese measures will help in more meaningful and causal reporting of Fund II\u2019s development \nimpact, which has been an occasional drawback of such interventions and has been highlighted \nin the detailed evaluation reports on PEF performance prepared by ADB. \n \nE.

DEVELOPMENT IMPACTS AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs  \n \n1.  Impacts \n \n38.  Fund II will contribute to two development impacts. The first is establishment of additional \nprivate  equity  funds  that  have  a  primary  or  dominant  focus  on  Agribusiness  in  India.  By \ndemonstrating financial performance and commercial returns in agribusiness, Fund II will help \ndraw more private sector capital in this sector in India. This is a significant positive contribution of \nFund II, as the agribusiness sector is typically owned and controlled by traditional traders and \nsemiprofessional family-owned small businesses. These businesses, though with very strong \nroots  in  operations,  require  support  in  improving  standards  of  professional  management, \ndisclosure, and transparency to gain acceptability from external private capital providers (debt \n \n ", "7 \n \n \nand equity). PEFs like Fund II can make critical contributions by bringing better management \npractices to these businesses, which also enhance the long-term viability of the sector (footnote \n5). \n \n39.  The second key impact is increased productivity, diversification, and value addition in the \nagriculture sector in India\u2014reflected in higher growth rates, particularly for basic food grains \ncritical for food security, and higher value-added produce. Increased equity participation and value \naddition in the agribusiness sector, along with measures to increase productivity, will create \nincome and employment opportunities at the farm level; and facilitate balanced, inclusive, and \nsustainable economic development in rural India. \n \n2.  Outcome \n \n40.  Outcome. Fund II will achieve positive development and financial returns. It will create a \ntransmission mechanism to bring improved technology (like drought-resistant seeds), advanced \nresource  conservation  techniques  (like  micro-irrigation),  reduced  wastage  (through  agri- \ninfrastructure facilities like granaries and warehouses), and higher value addition (through primary \nprocessing activities in the dairy and oilseeds industries,) to the farm level. \n \n3.  Outputs \n \n41.  The core output of ADB\u2019s investment will be the establishment of Fund II, through the \ncapital raised in the first and the subsequent close, and Fund II\u2019s investment in companies with \nbusiness and operations focused primarily on the Indian agribusiness sector. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n1.  Consistency with Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n \n42.  The Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 has identified agriculture as one of the areas, for \nlinking ADB operations to inclusive growth, and emphasized that continued investments in the \nsector will \"create jobs, promote economic opportunities, and reduce vulnerabilities by connecting \nthe poor to markets and increasing their access to social services and productive assets\".12 This \nhas also been validated through independent valuations, which concluded that ADB\u2019s investments \nin this area had generated jobs, raised rural incomes, and reduced poverty.13 \n \n43.  The country partnership strategy for India, 2013\u2013201714 identifies agribusiness as one of \nthe key sectors to be supported by ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department. \n \n2.  Consistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n \n44.  The investment thesis of Fund II overlaps well with ADB\u2019s agriculture sector strategy,15 in \nparticular with the expanded partnership with the private sector to attract more direct investments \nin productivity enhancement, agro-processing, agro-retailing, and other non-farm rural business. \n \n12  April 2014 Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: Meeting the Challenges of a Transforming Asia and Pacific \n13IED. 2010.

[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)].  \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n46.  Potential environmental impacts that may originate from Fund II\u2019s activities may include \nthe generation and discharge of hazardous waste, air emissions, wastewater discharges, and \nrelease of contaminated materials. Other issues could include threats to plant biodiversity, \nsusceptibility to pest attacks, occupational health concerns, and safety hazards. These impacts \nare expected to be site- and investment-specific, and will be avoided substantially by adhering to \nwell-established and accessible international practices and design and process criteria, which \nFund II will adopt. All of Fund II\u2019s portfolio companies are expected to be classified category B, \nand Fund II is classified category FI overall in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009). On social safeguards, the investment is classified FI, treated as category C, as any \ninvestment having involuntary resettlement or indigenous peoples impacts, will be considered \nineligible for investment. \n \n47.  Fund II and its investees will establish and implement an environmental and social \nmanagement system (ESMS), commensurate with the impacts and risks of their operations. Fund \nII and its investees will comply with all applicable laws and standards on environment, health, and \nsafety aspects; and Fund II will not invest in any entity that is engaged in an activity named in \nADB\u2019s Prohibited Investment Activities List.16 Fund II\u2019s ESMS will include provisions requiring \nFund II and portfolio companies to comply with national labor laws and to take measures in \nrelation to internationally recognized core labor standards, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Social \nProtection Strategy.17 The investment is categorized as having no gender elements. Since this is \na follow-on fund, and the ESMS for Fund I and its investees have already been implemented, \nthere is high certainty that the fund manager will adhere to these requirements for Fund II. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n48.  Fund II, the sponsor, REAL, and REMCO were advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing \nbest international practice relating to combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing \nof terrorism.
