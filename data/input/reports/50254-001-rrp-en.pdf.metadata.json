This will contribute to Nepal\u2019s national goals of \npromoting  and  diversifying  exports,  and  help  the  country  fulfill  its  commitments  to  the  Trade \nFacilitation Agreement (TFA) of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and related international \nstandards on customs. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nThe development problem. Nepal is a least developed country (LDC) aspiring to attain \n3. \nmiddle-income status by 2030, and the manufacturing sector will play a key role in achieving the \naspiration.2 In line with the global 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Government of \nNepal  has  adopted  development  strategies  that  aim  to  expand  the  manufacturing  sector  and \npromote  merchandise  exports  as  vehicles  for  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction. 3 The \nperformance of Nepal\u2019s manufacturing sector has been lackluster, with its share in gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) declining over the years. The ratio of Nepal\u2019s exports to GDP has also declined \nsteadily, the merchandise trade balance has worsened, and exports remain concentrated in a few \nmarkets and commodities.4  \n \n4. \nAs a landlocked country virtually isolated from external markets, Nepal has high transport \nand trade costs. High trade costs impede export competitiveness and are often attributed to high \ntariffs  and  inadequate  transport  and  trade-related  infrastructure.  To  make  its  export  sector \ncompetitive,  Nepal  liberalized  its  trade  regime  by  cutting  tariffs  and  removing  quantitative \nrestrictions. However, infrastructure deficiency and nontariff barriers pose challenges in reducing \ntrade  costs  further.  Studies  have  shown  that  inefficient,  unpredictable,  and  opaque  customs \nprocedures are among the primary nontariff barriers in developing countries\u2014contributing to high \ntrade costs, poor business climate, and inability to integrate into global value chains.5 In a 2016 \nbusiness survey involving 501 Nepalese traders, 51% of exporters and 21% of importers reported \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Government of Nepal, National Planning Commission; and Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2016.

The manufacturing sector\u2019s share \nof GDP declined from 9.5% in the mid-1990s to 6.5% in 2015. The ratio of merchandise exports to GDP declined \nfrom 15.4% in FY2000 to 5.1% in FY2014. The goods trade deficit more than doubled from 13.8% in FY2000 to \n30.3% in FY2016. \n\n5  WTO. 2016. Trade costs and inclusive growth: Case studies presented by WTO chair-holders.

Geneva. \n\n \n\n\ffacing nontariff issues or procedural obstacles to trade.6 Estimates show that for Nepal, nontariff \ntrade costs are equivalent to applying a 325% ad valorem tariff on manufactured exports, 523% \non agricultural products, and 391% overall.7 Inaction on nontariff barriers, including those related \nto customs, imposes an opportunity cost for Nepal\u2019s businesses, government revenues, and the \neconomy as a whole. \n \n5. \nNepal has made a global commitment to undertake customs reforms by acceding to the \nWTO\u2019s  TFA,  the  first  multilateral  trading  agreement  signed  since  the WTO  was  established  in \n1995. The TFA aims to simplify, modernize, and harmonize export and import processes primarily \nthrough reforms to customs clearance procedures. Implementing TFA reforms for LDCs like Nepal \nis  expected  to  increase  the  number  of  products  exported  by  destination  by  11.8%\u201312.8%  and \nraise  the  number  of  destinations  by  product  by  14.1%\u201321.3%.  With  nearly  90%  of  Nepalese \nexporters depending on imported inputs, improved customs procedures are expected to reduce \ntrading costs, lower the cost of importing inputs, and make exports more competitive.8 \n \n6. \nBinding  constraints.  Although  Nepal\u2019s  Department  of  Customs  (DOC)  has  made \nprogress  in  introducing  reforms  and  automation,  it  has  largely  remained  a  revenue-collecting \nenforcement body. It has yet to fully embody the \u201cCustoms in the 21st Century\u201d vision of the World \nCustoms  Organization  (WCO),  which  broadens  the  role  of  customs  from  regulating  trade  to \ninclude facilitating it.9 Customs clearance procedures in Nepal remain focused on exercising at-\nthe-border  controls,  subjecting  some  80%  of  traded  goods  to  physical  inspection. 10  Border \ncheckpoints  are  congested,  and  facilities  and  mechanisms  for  pre-arrival  or  post-clearance \n(behind-the-border)  processing  are  inadequate. 11  Legitimate,  low-risk  trade  suffers  from \ninefficient processes, and is subject to the same red tape as  potentially illicit, high-risk trade.12 \nThese  constraints  not  only  result  in higher  trade  costs,  but  also revenue  leakages. They  pose \nsocial,  environmental  and  cultural  safety,  and  security  risks.  The  lack  of  modern,  risk-based \nprocedures and institutional structures has also prevented the DOC from implementing customs \nprocedures with economic impact (CPEI), which are needed to support the export sector.13 The \nkey elements of the constraints are: \n\n                                                \n6  International  Trade  Centre.  2016.

This policy document redefines the role of customs administrations to meet the \nnew demands arising from the globalization of trade. Such demands task customs to exercise effective security and \ncontrol of international supply chains, while undertaking greater facilitation of legitimate trade. \n\n10 The DOC\u2019s Automated System for Customs Data (ASYCUDA) system identifies high-risk cargo for red lane clearance \nwith physical inspection, low-risk cargo for green lane clearance with minimum inspection, and medium-risk cargo \nfor yellow lane clearance with document verification before release. It also generates statistics on the clearance rate \nof the three lanes.    \n\n11 Government of Nepal, Ministry of Finance, DOC. 2017. Time Release Study Report: Mechi & Biratnagar Customs \n\n2017. Kathmandu. \n\n12 Illicit trade includes (i) trade in counterfeit or contraband goods; (ii) smuggling of highly taxed goods, arms, cultural \nartefacts, and other items that threaten the security and safety of the society; and (iii) noncompliant trade, which \navoids payment of duties and fees. \n\n13 The term CPEI was coined by the European Union\u2019s Customs Union and refers to specific measures to support the \nexport sector. CPEI include customs warehousing, inward and outward processing, temporary admission of goods, \nand transit. Customs-related transit measures include the adoption of the Customs Convention on the International \nTransport of Goods Under Cover of TIR Carnets (TIR Convention). \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nAbsence  of  a  legal  framework  to  introduce  a  risk-based  approach.  Nepal \nlacks the legal provisions to enable customs to play the role of a trade facilitator. \nThe legislative framework governing customs procedures needs to incorporate the \nlegal basis for adopting a risk-based approach. This includes incentivizing traders \nwith a good record of compliance to benefit from faster clearance. \nUnpredictable  and  inconsistent  clearance  procedures,  unsupported  by \nmodern  tools.  Predictable  and  transparent  customs  clearance  requires  a \ncoherent  compliance  strategy  that  integrates  behind-the-border  functions  of  risk \nanalysis  and  management,  intelligence,  valuation,  post-clearance  audit,  and \nadvance rulings. These are not in place or are underutilized in Nepal. In addition, \nmany  customs  border  offices  are  not  connected  electronically  to  the  DOC \nheadquarters,  which  hinders  the  application  of  unified  and  consistent  customs \nprocesses across the country. \nDated institutional structure. The DOC\u2019s organizational structure is not designed \nfor  modern  customs  procedures.  Currently,  1,114  of  the  DOC\u2019s  1,283  customs \nofficers (87%) are stationed at the field offices to conduct traditional at-the-border \nprocesses, and only a small number of staff at  the DOC headquarters performs \nbehind-the-border functions. Some of these functions, which require independent \nsections with segregated responsibilities, are dispersed within a larger entity. The \nDOC organizational chart does not reflect the links between the responsibilities of \ndifferent sections, and mechanisms to facilitate cross-section coordination are not \nstrong.  Weakness  in  the  procurement  and  automation  sections  precludes \nsustainable upgrading of the customs infrastructure. \nShortage  of  requisite  human  resource  capacity  for  a  modern  customs \nadministration.  The  qualifications  of  most  DOC  staff  are  not  aligned  with  the \ntechnical expertise needed to execute behind-the-border functions. About 80% of \nthe  workforce  is  composed  of  junior  level  non-officers  with  limited  competency. \nNepal\u2019s civil service system also imposes a 2-year staff rotation requirement, which \nmakes retention of technical expertise within one agency a challenge. The DOC\u2019s \napproach  to  staff  training  has  remained  unplanned,  without  a  comprehensive \nanalytical basis or a long-term vision. \n\n \nGovernment  reform  agenda.  Trade  facilitation  as  a  means  to  promote  exports  is  a \n7. \npriority  in  Nepal\u2019s  national  development  agenda 14  as  envisaged  in  the  14th  periodic  plan, \nFY2017\u2013FY2020  and  the  Nepal  Trade  Integration  Strategy,  2016. 15  To  this  end,  Nepal\u2019s \nParliament has ratified two key international agreements on expediting the movement, release, \nand  clearance  of  goods:  the  WCO\u2019s  revised  Kyoto  Convention  (RKC)  and  the  WTO\u2019s  TFA.16 \nAccording  to  the  government\u2019s  2015  WTO  TFA  gap  assessment  and  implementation  action \nplan,17 Nepal will comply with 31 of the 37 TFA measures by January 2022. The DOC will lead \nthe implementation of 18 and co-lead in 15 of the 37 measures\u2014most of them related to legal \nand  procedural  reforms,  institutional  framework,  and  training.18 The  TFA\u2019s  entry  into  force  on \n                                                \n14 The development policy letter is in Appendix 3. \n15 Government  of  Nepal,  National  Planning  Commission.  2016.

Washington, DC (restricted distribution). \n\n18 Nepal\u2019s Compliance with the World Trade Organization\u2019s Trade Facilitation Agreement (accessible from the list of \n\nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n22 February  2017  signifies  that  Nepal\u2019s  future  performance  in  trade  facilitation  reforms  will  be \nsubject to the WTO\u2019s enforcement mechanism of dispute settlement understanding.19 \n \n8. \nSince  2003,  the  DOC  has  been  implementing  the  multiyear  Customs  Reform  and \nModernization  Strategies  and  Action  Plan  (CRMSAP)  in  phases.  Key  achievements  under  the \nfourth  phase  of  the  CRMSAP,  2013\u20122017 20  include  ratification  of  the  RKC,  rollout  of  the \nAutomated System for Customs Data (ASYCUDA) World,21 and commencement of the national \nsingle  window,22 all  of  which  have  contributed  to  improved  TFA  compliance.  The  Ministry  of \nFinance  has  approved  the  fifth  phase  of  the  CRMSAP,  2017\u20122021,23 which  aims  to transform \ncustoms  operations  to  risk-based,  paperless  e-Customs,  and  to  introduce  CPEI  to  promote \nexports.  Its  strategic  priorities  and  time-bound  action  points  align  with  Nepal\u2019s  implementation \nschedules for the WTO\u2019s TFA and the RKC (footnote 18). \n \n9. \nThe proposed program. The proposed program fully aligns with the reform priorities and \nimplementation  period  of  the  CRMSAP,  2017\u20122021. The  Asian  Development  Bank (ADB)  has \nprovided  long-term  policy  assistance  to  support  Nepal\u2019s  trade  facilitation  sector  in  planning, \nimplementing, and evaluating the CRMSAP phases. Budget support is considered appropriate to \nfinance part of the projected resource gap to implement the CRMSAP, 2017\u20122021. The policy \nactions trigger and support (i) reforms on legal and procedural issues, (ii) simplified and unified \nprocedures backed by automation tools, (iii) institutional reorganization, and (iv) human resources \ndevelopment.  These  would  help  Nepal  substantially  fulfill  its  WTO  TFA  commitments  and \ncomplement the related activities of the government and other development partners, including \nthose that have committed to support the TFA (para. 14). The two-tranche approach will allow for \nsequential reform milestones to be achieved in the short to medium term, setting the path toward \nthe longer-term reform targets. This would sustain the impact of ADB\u2019s multidimensional support \nthrough continuous policy dialogue, investment, budget support, and capacity development at the \nnational and South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) levels. \n \nADB\u2019s experience and value addition. ADB\u2019s support for trade facilitation in Nepal dates \n10. \nto 1996 when it introduced automation to customs administration. While ADB has kept automation \nas the backbone, its contributions have evolved and it has increasingly combined the delivery of \npolicy and capacity development support for legal, regulatory, and procedural reforms with the \ninvestment of resources needed to implement them.24 ADB has helped the DOC (i) prepare for \naccession to the RKC; (ii) conduct the midterm review of the CRMSAP, 2013\u20122017 and formulate \nthe CRMSAP, 2017\u20122021; (iii) compile an e-Customs master plan; (iv) establish customs client \nservice desks; (v) conduct Time Release Studies (TRSs);25 and (vi) draft legal amendments to \nthe Customs Act, 2007 and related procedures for taking in relief consignment after the April 2015 \nearthquake and for lodging electronic declarations to launch the ASYCUDA World pilot projects. \n\n                                                \n19 WTO.

The  government\u2019s  confidence  in  the  partnership  with \nADB also testifies to ADB\u2019s record of translating knowledge into effective advisory and analytical \ninputs to DOC\u2019s policy formulation.  \n    \n11. \nADB, as an advocate of regional cooperation and integration, brings the added value of \ncomplementing  country-level  support  to  Nepal\u2019s  trade  facilitation  with  subregional  initiatives. \nSince 2001, the ADB-supported SASEC program has provided a platform for member countries \nto address trade facilitation issues of subregional concern collectively, including those identified \nin the WTO\u2019s TFA.26 The SASEC Trade Facilitation Strategic Framework, 2014\u20132018 envisages \ngreater harmonization of trade procedures among the SASEC countries.27 The SASEC Customs \nSubgroup,  established  in  2013,  provides  a  venue  for  dialogue  and  capacity  building  among \ncustoms  directors  general  of  member  countries  on  common  issues  related  to  customs \nmodernization, in line with the WTO\u2019s TFA and other related international conventions.  \n \nADB  lessons  learned.  Key  lessons  from  earlier  ADB  projects  and  an  ADB  program28 \n12. \npoint  to (i) the  appropriateness of two-tranche  releases for  policy-based  lending to trigger and \nmaintain  reform  momentum;  (ii)  the  importance  of  sustained  policy  dialogue  with  concerned \ngovernment  agencies  and  private  sector  stakeholders  to  ensure  implementation  success;  and \n(iii) the  need  for  associated  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  help  the  government  achieve  timely \nprogram and project completion. \n \n13. \nAlignment  with  ADB  strategies.  The  program  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership strategy, 2013\u20122017 for Nepal, which highlights support for customs modernization \nand transport connectivity as complementary investments to be coordinated through the SASEC \nprogram. 29  The  proposed  program  is  in  the  project  pipeline  of  ADB\u2019s  Operational  Plan  for \nRegional Cooperation and Integration, 2016\u2012202030 and aligns with the SASEC Operational Plan \n2016\u20122025.31 \n \n14. \nDevelopment partner coordination. Development partners coordinate interventions in \nsupport  of  Nepal\u2019s  trade  facilitation  on  multiple  levels:  (i)  formally  through  the  national  Aid  for \nTrade32 mechanism, the SASEC Customs Subgroup, and the global TFA Facility;33 and (ii) more \nflexibly at the project level or through targeted collaboration in discrete activities.34 At the project \nlevel, ADB has established a close partnership with the United Nations Conference on Trade and \nDevelopment  in  implementing  successive  ASYCUDA  projects.  The  World  Bank\u2019s  Nepal\u2013India \nRegional Trade and Transport Project is further developing a national single window, conducting \n\n                                                \n26 Nepal is a founding member of the ADB-supported SASEC program.

The World Bank, the WCO, United Nations organizations, and governments of \ndeveloped countries are among the TFAF members. \n\n34 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fOutputs \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\ncustoms risk profiling, and developing selected trade-related infrastructure.35 ADB has scheduled \nregular consultations with the World Bank project teams  and has forged a partnership with the \nWCO to deliver joint capacity development initiatives regularly.  \n \nB. \n \n15. \nThe program\u2019s impact will be expanded exports and increased export competitiveness of \nNepal. It aligns with the government\u2019s vision articulated in the 14th periodic plan and the Nepal \nTrade Integration Strategy (para. 7). The outcome will be increased access by legitimate trade to \nsimplified, harmonized, and modernized trade processes. This will be measured through greater \nuse of green lane clearance for low-risk cargo (footnote 10), an increased percentage of web-\nbased  customs  declaration  clearance  through  ASYCUDA  World,  a  reduction  in  the  average \ncustoms clearance time,36 and an overall improvement in trade facilitation indicator (TFI) scores.37 \n \nC. \n \nThe  program  will  support  a  policy  framework,  which  is  detailed  in  the  policy  matrix  in \n16. \nAppendix 4. The policy actions will focus on six trade facilitation strategic priorities, all featured in \nthe WTO  TFA  articles  and  central  to  the  DOC\u2019s  transformation  to  risk-based,  trade-facilitating \noperations,  collectively  introducing  and  enhancing  behind-the-border  processing.  These  are \n(i) risk management, (ii) post-clearance audit, (iii) advance ruling, (iv) trade facilitation measures \nfor authorized operators, (v) pre-arrival processing, and (vi) expedited shipment. The program\u2019s \ncomprehensive review of customs legislation and expansion of customs automation will improve \nNepal\u2019s compliance with 19 more WTO TFA articles. The program will thus help Nepal comply \nwith 25 of the 37 WTO TFA articles, which is expected to result in a significant improvement in \nNepal\u2019s TFI scores.38 These 25 articles target reform areas that (i) require the DOC to lead the \ngovernment\u2019s compliance efforts; (ii) are listed under the medium-term implementation schedule \nof 2\u20135 years from TFA ratification; (iii) have a high degree of alignment with the RKC commitments \nand  the  CRMSAP,  2017\u20122021  action  points;  and  (iv)  complement  ongoing  work  of  the \ngovernment  and  its  development  partners  (footnote  18).  The  program  will  also  strengthen  the \nDOC\u2019s  institutional  capacity  to handle automation,  procurement,  accounting,  and  staff  integrity \npromotion  as enablers  of  the TFA  reforms. The program\u2019s  policy  matrix  of  two tranches,  each \ncomprising 10 policy actions,39 is designed to target the four elements of the binding constraints.  \n \n17. \nOutput 1: National policy and legal framework for trade facilitation improved. The \nprogram  will  support  (i)  accession  to  the  WTO\u2019s  TFA  and  the  RKC  General  Annex; \n(ii) achievement of the CRMSAP, 2017\u20132021 implementation milestones; (iii) submission of the \nlegal amendments to the cabinet to comply fully with the RKC General Annex and with WTO TFA \n\n                                                \n35 World  Bank.

The CRMSAP, 2017\u2013\n2021 performance indicators include improvement of the TFI score to 1.3 by July 2021 (footnotes 18 and 24).  \n\n39 Tranche 1 policy actions are substantially completed in May 2017. The government will submit to ADB evidence of \ncompliance by the end of June 2017 as stated in Evidence of Compliance with the Policy Matrix (accessible from the \nlist of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nmeasures  on  the  six  trade  facilitation  strategic  priorities; 40  and  (iv)  drafting  of  legislative \namendments and new legislation to comply with 19 customs-related TFA measures and CPEI. \n\n \n\n18. \nOutput  2:  Customs  procedures  improved.  The  program  will  introduce  risk-based \napproaches  to  Nepal\u2019s  customs  clearance,  and  the  government  will  apply  the  streamlined \nprocedures across the country. The program will promote further automation, which will enable \nthe application of consistent and transparent clearance procedures. It will support (i) pilot testing \nof reengineered customs declaration processing steps in three customs offices,41 (ii) pilot testing \nof ASYCUDA World in 10 customs offices,42 and (iii) implementing a risk management framework \nand standard operating procedures. \n \n19. \nOutput 3: Department of Customs organizational structure strengthened. To enable \nthe implementation of the centrally monitored, risk-based approach, the program will strengthen \nthe  DOC\u2019s  organizational  structure  to  perform  the  behind-the-border  tasks  identified  in  the  six \ntrade  facilitation  strategic  priorities.  The  organizational  restructuring  exercise  will  revise  the \norganizational chart to (i) rationalize the reporting channels of key technical sections, (ii) define \nthe  terms  of  reference  for  the  sections,  (iii)  install  mechanisms  for  better  data  sharing  and \ncoordination  between the sections,  and (iv)  create  new  sections  where needed.  As  part  of the \nrestructuring,  ADB\u2019s  associated  stand-alone TA  (para.  22)  will  help  DOC  analyze  the  required \nqualifications and terms of reference for individual staff positions. The  DOC will implement the \nrestructuring plan in incremental phases for a gradual but sustainable change. The program will \nsupport the (i) review of the DOC\u2019s organizational structure, (ii) formulation of a realignment plan, \n(iii)  completion  of  the  initial  phase  of  the  realignment  plan,  and  (iv)  establishment  of  a  risk \nmanagement section. \n \n20. \nOutput 4:  Department of Customs\u2019 capacity enhanced. The adoption of the risk-based \napproach in customs operations in Nepal will require a long-term training plan for DOC staff to be \nimplemented with adequate training tools. The government will prioritize the training required in \nthe  six  trade  facilitation  priority  areas,  and  the  related  areas  of  procurement,  automation, \naccounting,  and  staff  integrity.  To  fill  technical  capacity  gaps  and  address  staff  rotation \nconstraints, the DOC will launch a pool of experts scheme. This will involve a roster for customs \nexperts to act as trainers or to undertake specialized assignments with the DOC. The program \nwill support the (i) formulation of a DOC capacity development plan, (ii) development of training \nmodules, and (iii) establishment of the pool of experts scheme. \n \n\n                                                \n40 Nepal\u2019s  legislative  framework  complies  with  96  of  the  121  RKC  General  Annex  standards.  The  remaining \n25 standards require amendments in 22 articles of the Customs Act, 2007; two Customs rules; and one administrative \ninstruction.  A  summary  of  the  25  amendments,  in  Nepali,  is  in  Government  of  Nepal,  Ministry  of  Finance,  DOC. \nhttp://customs.gov.np/en/%E0%A4%9C%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0%E\n0%A5%80.html \n\n41 Customs  declaration  processing  typically  involves  (i)  data  capture  and  validation,  (ii)  monitoring  of  customs \nregulations, (iii) registration, (iv) calculation of duties and taxes, (v) selectivity, (vi) assessment, and (vii)  release of \ngoods. Streamlined and consistent application of these steps can be a challenge for customs administrations. \n\n42 In addition to the three customs offices that started using ASYCUDA World in 2016 (footnote 21), seven more pilot \ntests  will  be  launched  from  the  highest  revenue-yielding  customs  offices.  Together  they collect  over  95% of total \ncustoms-related revenues annually. In 2016, the three offices cleared 6% of the total declarations through this web-\nbased customs management system. All figures are from government data sources. \n\n \n\n\fDevelopment Financing Needs \n\nD. \n \n21. \nNepal has substantial development financing needs and faces an estimated infrastructure \nfinancing gap of 8%\u201212% of GDP annually until 2020.43 Nepal\u2019s fiscal deficit averaged 1.2% in \nFY2003\u2012FY2016  (footnote  7).  A  budget  surplus  of  1.4%  of  GDP  was  recorded  in  FY2016, \nreflecting chronically weak budget execution.44 The fiscal deficit for FY2017, however, is projected \nat 8.8% of GDP or NRs229.3 billion.45 More than half of this deficit is expected to be financed \nthrough foreign loans. \n \n22. \nThe government estimated the total cost of implementing the program during 2017\u20122021 \nto  be  about  $94  million,  for  which  it  has  provisionally  committed  about  $52  million  of  its  own \nresources (footnote 23). The government is expecting development partner support of $21 million \nfrom  this  proposed  ADB  program.  Additionally,  the  World  Bank\u2019s  trade  and  transport  project \n(para. 14)  will  provide  $16  million,  leaving  a  funding  gap  of  $5  million.46 The  government  will \nensure  that  the  counterpart  funds  generated  from  the  program\u2019s  loan  proceeds  will  support \nimplementation  during  2017\u20122021,  which  significantly  enhances  the  sustainability  of  the \nprogram\u2019s reform measures. The government has also requested associated stand-alone TA to \nsupport reform implementation under the program.47 The TA is estimated to cost $1 million, which \nwill be financed on a grant basis by a Special Fund administered by ADB. \n \nThe government has requested a concessional loan in various currencies equivalent to \n23. \nSDR15,341,000  ($21  million) 48  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  to  help  finance  the \nprogram. The loan will have a 24-year term, including a grace period of 8 years; an interest rate \nof 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; and such other terms \nand  conditions  to  be  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement.  The  funds  will  be  released  in  two \ntranches\u2014$10  million  on  loan  effectiveness  and  $11  million  about  24  months  later\u2014once  the \ngovernment has complied with the policy conditions. \n \nE. \n \n24. \nThe program period will be 4 years starting in July 2017. The DOC will be the executing \nand implementing agency. A program steering committee, chaired by the DOC director general, \nwill  guide  and  monitor  implementation.  Committee  members  will  be  drawn  from  the  DOC,  the \nDepartment  of  Industry,  and  the  finance  and  commerce  ministries.  Members  of  the  Customs \nNational  Trade  Facilitation  Committee,  which  represents  trade-related  stakeholders  from  the \npublic  and  private  sector,  and  ADB  may  be  invited  to  the  steering  committee  meetings.  The \nsteering committee will present the progress of and discuss issues on program implementation at \nregular  meetings  of  the  Customs  National  Trade  Facilitation  Committee.  The  DOC  will  form  a \nprogram  implementation  framework,  headed  by  its  deputy  director  general  (management),  to \nsupervise  five  thematic  task  forces:  (i)  coordination,  (ii)  legislation,  (iii) automation,  (iv)  risk \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n                                                \n43 L.

A quantitative analysis undertaken shows a positive correlation between trade \nfacilitation and trade. Based on simulation results, Nepal\u2019s exports are expected to increase by \n23.0% and imports by 21.6% from improvement in trade facilitation.49 \n \n26. \nNepal\u2019s economy is expected to benefit from lower trading costs, which can help reduce \nthe  price  of  imported  inputs  and  improve  manufacturers\u2019  access  to  imported  inputs\u2014thereby \nimproving  productivity  in  the  manufacturing  sector  and  making  exports  more  competitive.  The \nprogram is expected to lower entry barriers, enabling  manufacturers to enter into new markets \nand  products,  and  diversify  their  export  basket.  Other  expected  benefits  include  (i)  increased \nparticipation  of  Nepalese  firms  in  regional  and  global  value  chains,  (ii)  higher  foreign  direct \ninvestment inflows into Nepal as a result of the improved business climate, (iii) inclusive growth \nthrough poverty reduction and benefits to small and medium-sized enterprises, (iv) improvement \nin Nepal\u2019s customs revenue, and (v) a reduction in trade-related corruption (footnote 7). \n \nB. \n \nADB has carried out a financial management assessment.50 The overall fiduciary risk for \n27. \nthe program is moderate, because of (i) the lack of an internal audit service segregated from the \nprocessing  of  payments,  (ii)  capacity  challenges  in  procurement  and  automation,  and  (iii) the \nperception of customs revenue leakages. These will be mitigated under the program through the \nexpanded application of automation in customs clearance, as well as the requirement under the \npolicy matrix to revise the DOC\u2019s organizational chart and train relevant DOC officials in priority \nareas, including accounting, automation, procurement, and staff integrity. \n \n28. \nwith the government. \n \nC. \n \nThe reforms supported under the program will indirectly contribute to poverty reduction.51 \n29. \nBeneficiaries  from  the  program  include  current  and  future  businesses,  especially  small  and \nmedium-sized enterprises, informal traders, and women traders. More exports and the ensuing \ngrowth  of  manufacturers,  as  well  as  more  investment,  are  also  expected  to  provide  benefits \nthrough  job  creation,  higher  wages,  and  poverty  reduction.  The  program  is  thus  expected  to \ncontribute to inclusive and sustainable growth in the long term. \n \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n                                                \n49 Economic Analysis; and Estimated Gains in Trade from Improvement in Trade Facilitation (accessible from the list \n\nof linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n50 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n51 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fSafeguards \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nD. \n \n30. \nADB\u2019s evaluation of the environmental and social impacts of each policy action shows that \nthe program does not trigger ADB\u2019s safeguard policies. The program is classified category C for \nthe environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \n \nE. \n \nThe overall risk rating for program implementation is moderate. Major risks and mitigating \n31. \nmeasures are described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.52 Key risks \nfor the implementation of the program are related to the unstable political environment of Nepal, \nto  be  mitigated  by  ADB\u2019s  continuous  dialogue  with  the  government,  underpinned  by  close \ndevelopment partner coordination. Shortage of technical capacity in the DOC is also a risk, which \nthe  associated  stand-alone  TA\u2019s  capacity  development  activities  will  help  mitigate. \nImplementation  of  the  government\u2019s  Public  Financial  Management  Reform  Strategy  will  help \naddress some of the country-wide fiduciary risks in the medium term. The integrated benefits and \nimpacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \n32. \nall  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement, as described in detail in the loan \nagreement. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n33. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  policy-based  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nloan in various currencies equivalent to SDR15,341,000 ($21,000,000)53 to Nepal for the South \nAsia  Subregional  Economic  Cooperation  Customs  Reform  and  Modernization  for  Trade \nFacilitation  Program,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  in  concessional  terms,  with  an \ninterest charge at the rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter; for a \nterm of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement  presented  to  the \nBoard. \n \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n1 June 2017 \n\n                                                \n52 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n53 SDR1 = $1.36892 as of 9 May 2017. \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\n \nImpact the Program is aligned with: \nNepal\u2019s  exports  expanded  and  export  competitiveness  increased  (14th  periodic  plan,  FY2017\u2013FY2020; \nNepal Trade Integration Strategy, 2016)a \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nRisks \n\n \nPolitical instability \ncauses irregular \ntrade patterns. \n\n \nThe planned \nelections and \ntransition from a \nunitary state to a \nfederal structure \ndelay \nimplementation of \nreforms. \n\nPerformance Indicators with \nTargets and Baselines \n\nBy 2021 \na.
