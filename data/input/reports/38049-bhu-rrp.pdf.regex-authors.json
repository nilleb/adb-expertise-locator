It includes \ninstitutional  strengthening  and  building  staff  capacity  in  urban \nmanagement and urban service provision, as well as enhancing \npublic awareness on public hygiene.    \n   \nRationale  Thimphu and Phuentsholing face the full force of urban migration \nand urban sprawl generated by limited job opportunities in rural \nareas. The task of absorbing the 70,000 people expected to enter \nthe  labor  market  over  5  year  period  is  quite  challenging.  The \nunemployment rate countrywide is 2\u20133%, but in urban areas the \nrate  is  4.1%  and,  among  those  aged  15\u201319  years,  the  urban \nunemployment figure is as high as 10.9%. The Government is \nresponding to the increase in urbanization by emphasizing the \nimportance of securing equality in living standards in the various \nparts of the country \u201cto ensure that the benefits of development \nare shared equitably between different income groups and regions \nand in ways that promote social harmony, stability, and unity and \ncontribute  to  the  development  of  a  just  and  compassionate \nsociety.\u201d With this requirement in mind, the Government asked for \ncontinued  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  assistance  in \nimproving  urban  infrastructure  and  services  in  Thimphu  and \nPhuentsholing, particularly in their newly expanded areas. It also \nasked  for  support  in  developing  Dagana,  one  of  the  regional \ncenters unassisted by any other source of aid in the past.   \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The primary impact of the Project is improved urban infrastructure \nand urban services management in Thimphu, Phuentsholing, and \nDagana, which will contribute to augmenting the growth potential \nin  these  areas.  The  outcomes  of  the  Project  will  include  (i) \nimproving  urban  infrastructure  planning;  (ii)  constructing  urban \nroads, drainage, and other public infrastructure; (iii) broadening \nwater treatment, supply, and sanitation coverage; (iv) enhancing \ncommunity  awareness  on  proper  hygiene;  and  (v)  providing \ncapacity building in urban facility management to staff of project \ncities and towns and the Executing Agency (EA), the Department ", "ii   \nof Urban Development and Engineering Services (DUDES) of the \nMinistry of Works and Human Settlement (MoWHS).  \n   \nProject Investment Plan  The  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $30.75  million \nequivalent, including taxes, duties, interest charges on the ADB \nloan, and physical and price contingencies.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  ADB  will  provide  a  loan  of  $24.6  million  equivalent  (SDR \n16,597,000), which is 80% of the total cost. The Government will \nfinance $6.15 million equivalent, or 20% of the total project cost, \nincluding  taxes  and  duties,  resettlement  cost,  land  acquisition, \nremuneration of counterpart staff, office accommodation, part of \nthe civil works, and other miscellaneous costs. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $24.6 million equivalent (SDR 16,597,000) from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources will be provided in various currencies to \nfinance  the  Project.  The  loan  will  have  a  term  of  32  years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, with interest charged at the \nrate of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum thereafter.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 December 2012 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2012 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  DUDES, MoWHS.  \n   \nImplementation  The EA will establish a project management unit (PMU) located at \nArrangements  DUDES premises and headed by the project manager. The PMU \nwill  be  the  key  organization  ensuring  overall  execution  and \nimplementation of the Project. The PMU will be responsible for \nplanning, monitoring, and reporting on the Project, as well as for \ncost and quality control. Thimphu City Corporation (TCC) will be \nthe implementing agency (IA) for Component A, Phuentsholing \nCity Corporation (PCC) for Component B, Dagana Dzongkhag for \nComponent C, and DUDES for Components D and E. \n   \nProcurement  Procurement of all goods and services under the Project will be \ncarried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines \n(April  2006).  All  civil  work  contracts  estimated  to  cost  the \nequivalent of more than $1 million will be awarded by international \ncompetitive bidding procedures. Contracts estimated to cost less \nthan  $1  million  will  be  carried  out  using  national  competitive \nbidding  or  other  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB  under  its \nProcurement Guidelines. Procurement of goods will preferably be \ngrouped into packages larger than $500,000 to be suitable for \ninternational competitive bidding procedures. Goods that cannot \nbe grouped into larger contracts and are estimated to cost less \nthan  $500,000  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  limited  international  bidding \nprocedures,  and  miscellaneous  minor  goods  expected  to  cost ", "  iii\nunder  $100,000  equivalent  will  be  purchased  using  shopping \nprocedures. The proposed procurement plan is in Appendix 8. \nWhile procurement will generally be carried out by the PIUs under \nthe guidance of the PMU, equipment and vehicle rentals common \nto all project towns will be procured by the PMU. \n   \nConsulting Services  All consultants under the Project will be recruited in accordance \nwith Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (April 2006). While the \nproject management consultant and the design, monitoring, and \nsupervision consultant will be recruited using the quality- and cost-\nbased selection method, for smaller packages and specialized \nconsulting  services  under  Component  D  of  the  Project, \nconsultants may be selected and engaged using methods such as \nquality-based  selection,  consultants\u2019  qualifications  selection, \nsingle source selection, and individual consultant selection. An \ninternational  consulting  firm  (51  person-months  of  international \nconsulting services and 179 person-months of national) will be \nengaged to assist the PMU in overall project management and \nimplementation.  Similarly,  one  international  consulting  firm  (49 \nperson-months of international consulting services and 68 person-\nmonths of national) will be engaged to assist the PIUs in the \ndesign, monitoring, and supervision of contracts under the Project. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The main benefits of the Project will be (i) improved health and \nBeneficiaries  general living standards for residents of Thimphu, Phuentsholing, \nand  Dagana,  which  will  help  achieve  Millennium  Development \nGoals; (ii) sustainable and reliable urban services through more \neffective  city  corporation  management;  and  (iii)  improved \neconomic and social conditions in the three project areas from \ninvestments  in  roads,  drainage,  water  supply,  sanitation,  solid \nwaste management, and community facilities.  \n \nThe Project will provide improved water supply and sanitation and \nassociated health services to about 19,000 people in poor areas \nselected low coverage and high prevalence of diarrhea and other \nsanitation-related illness. An estimated 55,000 people will directly \nbenefit from the urban infrastructure subcomponents. The Project \nwill also strengthen the capacity and capability of staff at TCC and \nPCC  to  upgrade  infrastructure  in  more  strategically  coherent \nmanner,  plan  budgets  for  continued  maintenance  and  repair \nneeds, and so reduce the frequency of unwarranted breakdowns. \nLocal private contractors, as well as suppliers, will benefit from the \nflow  of  more  than  $27  million  in  contracts  for  civil  works  and \nequipment over the 6 years of the Project.  \n   \n ", "iv   \nRisks and Assumptions  As the scale of civil works under the Project in Thimphu will be \nlarge,  some  risks  arise  that  are  common  to  road,  water,  and \nwastewater  projects.  These  are  (i)  poor  detailed  design  of \nsubprojects, (ii) a lack of experienced contractors available for \nlarger civil work contracts, (iii) poor performance by appointed \ncontractors, (iv) poor supervision and quality control of works by \nthe IAs, (v) construction material not being readily available, and \n(vi) a lack of suitably trained operators for completed plants.   \n \nThe other risk is associated with the land pooling (LP) exercise. \nLP requires extensive consultations among stakeholders and so \ntakes considerable time to reach agreement. While assessments \nundertaken during project preparation show that the impacts on \nindividual affected people or households are not expected to be \nsignificant, ensuring compliance with safeguards may take time. It \nwas noted during project preparation that time and resources are \nrequired to conduct further consultations, particularly with non-\ntitled affected people, and ensure (i) compensation for any losses, \n(ii) that the Government\u2019s Office of Legal Affairs (OLA) verifies \n100% of agreements, and (iii) adequate grievance redress. Delays \nin  compliance  with  safeguards,  particularly  the  provision  of \ncompensation, is a significant project risk. Moreover, the legal and \nadministrative system relating to urban infrastructure is at an early \nstage of development and does not provide a statutory framework \nfor LP.  Because Government-implemented LP schemes in other \nareas have been the subjects of two litigations, a legal opinion is \nbeing obtained from OLA to ensure the contractual validity of the \nproposed LP scheme. Furthermore, enabling provisions in relation \nto  LP  are  being  included  in  Bhutan\u2019s  proposed  urban \ndevelopment/planning law, which will be presented to the National \nAssembly in late 2006. \n   \nTechnical Assistance  In conjunction with the Project, technical assistance (TA) will be \nprovided to support the IAs as they devise and carry out (i) a solid \nwaste management strategy and action plan for Thimphu, (ii) a \ngeotechnical  and  slope  stability  study  in  Dagana;  (iii) \nunaccounted-for water reduction and water calibration, and (iv) an \nLP and urban facility management advisory. The estimated total \ncost of TA is $312,500, of which ADB will finance $250,000 on a \ngrant  basis  from  the  ADB  TA  funding  program.  The  TA \nconsultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants by Asian Development Bank and Its \nBorrowers and will engage individual international consultants (5 \nperson-months) and national consultants (16 person-months).

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Kingdom of Bhutan for the Urban Infrastructure Development Project (the Project).1 This \nreport  also  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Capacity  Building  for  Urban \nInfrastructure Planning and Management. If the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting \nunder  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  will  approve  the  TA.  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Prior to the early 1960s, Bhutan was isolated from the rest of the world and its mainly \nrural population was almost entirely dependent on subsistence agriculture. Since embarking on \na modernization process in 1961, Bhutan has made great progress in improving the standard of \nliving of its people. The development strategy of the Government of Bhutan (the Government) \nhas  focused  on  striking  a  balance  between,  on  the  one  hand,  growth  in  productivity  and \nincomes and, on the other hand, a desire to preserve its cultural and environmental heritage. \nSince it opened to the outside world, Bhutan has embarked on a far-reaching development \nstrategy that has brought significant improvement in the economic and social situation of the \ncountry. Real economic growth has averaged around 7% annually since the 1970s, raising the \ngross domestic product (GDP) per capita from $51 in 1961, then the lowest in the world, to $870 \nin 2005. \n \n3.  The Government\u2019s development plan set out in Vision 20202 is translated into sector \npolicies, strategies, and programs through 5-year development plans. The National Poverty \nReduction Strategy, including the 9th Five Year Plan (FYP), has five overall goals: (i) improving \nthe  quality  of  life  and  income,  especially  of  the  poor;  (ii)  ensuring  good  governance;  (iii) \npromoting private sector growth and employment generation; (iv) preserving and promoting \ncultural heritage and environment conservation; and (v) achieving rapid economic growth and \ntransformation.  The  Government\u2019s  strategic  priorities  to  achieve  these  objectives  are  (i) \nexpanding  infrastructure,  (ii)  setting  sound  macroeconomic  policy,  (iii)  ensuring  good \ngovernance, and (iv) improving access and enhancing social services. The National Poverty \nReduction Strategy accords high priority to infrastructure expansion, rural telecommunications, \nand  urban  infrastructure  development.  It  observes  that  expanding  the  road  network  and \nelectricity grid is an essential prerequisite for improving rural access and providing basic social \nservices such as health and education.  \n \n4.  Urban settlement is a new phenomenon in Bhutan, with a quickening pace in the last 15 \nto 20 years that is already showing signs of putting pressure on urban areas. The beginning of \nurban settlement in Bhutan was the establishment of dzongkhag (district or provincial) centers, \ncurrently numbering 20. These centers began as administrative and religious entities rather than \ncommercial and industrial ones. According to the Government\u2019s first comprehensive census, \nwhose summary result was released on 27 April 2006, the national population is 672,425. The \nurban population currently stands at 31% of the total population. If rural-urban migration trends \n                                                 \n1  The Project was prepared through ADB project preparatory technical assistance BHU-4533 (ADB. 2004. Technical \nAssistance  to  the  Kingdom  of  Bhutan  for  the  Urban  Municipal  Infrastructure  Development  Project.  Manila;  \napproved on 23 December, for $600,000).   \n2  Planning Commission, 1999. Bhutan: 2020-A Vision for Peace, Prosperity and Happiness. Royal Government of \nBhutan. \n ", " 2                         \ncontinue at their current pace, close to half of the country\u2019s population may reside in urban \ncenters by 2020. Ensuring that urban development is environmentally sustainable requires \nimprovements in municipal planning and management capacity and the institutionalization of \ncost-recovery practices for urban services. The urban sector analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n5.  Urban Centers. In 1996, the Government classified the urban centers in five categories, \nfrom A to E sequentially, reflecting their population size and level of public infrastructure (e.g., \nschools, sports grounds, and hotels). In total, 28 urban centers have been designated following \nthis definition by the Planning Commission, comprising 20 dzongkhag (district) headquarters; \ntwo dungkhags (subdistricts); Phuentsholing; and five satellite towns (Bondey, Gedu, Khaling, \nRangjung, and Wamrong). \n \n6.  Urban Sector Policies. The Government is responding to the increase in urbanization \nwith a number of policy documents, including the 9th FYP and Vision 2020, which focus on \ndecentralization, social equity, and building the capacity of local authorities. The legal system in \nBhutan was originally founded on rural life and an agricultural economy. In recent times, the \nGovernment has taken steps to enact laws that will have wider implications for the development \nof urban areas and associated infrastructure. Consequently, the legal and regulatory framework \nis being attuned to accommodate and facilitate urban life and infrastructure development. The \nLand Act of 1979 is the basic law dealing with land in Bhutan and covers all land holdings in the \ncountry. Many provisions contained in this act are becoming outdated and do not effectively \ndeal with issues associated with the development of urban areas and urban infrastructure. The \nGovernment is in the process of proposing the Bhutan Urban Development Act. The draft act in \npreparation covers issues dealing with planned development and management of urban land, \nalso accounting for ownership of urban land and property, land acquisition, compensation for \nland and other assets at reasonable market rates, land disposal, modes of developing land \nincluding land pooling (LP), and other provisions required for planning, allocating and managing \nurban development. The proposed act also provides simpler and more efficient procedures for \nregistering land transfers and a grievance redress system.    \n \n7.  Rapid Urbanization in Thimphu and Phuentsholing. Various programs are already in \nplace to attract people to secondary centers and retain them there to prevent their migration to \nthe major urban centers. Population is not disaggregated by city and town, and numbers vary \nfrom source to source. Based on information shared by the Government\u2019s Ministry of Works and \nHuman Settlement (MoWHS), the preliminary results of the 2005 census, Thimphu\u2019s population \nis estimated at 79,000 and growing annually by around 7%, while Phuentsholing\u2019s is at 20,000 \nand growing at less than 3%. Thimphu is growing at more than double the national growth rate, \npredominantly from rural-urban migration, and its population is projected to reach 150,000 by \n2027. The two cities face the full force of urban migration and urban sprawl due to limited job \nopportunities in rural areas. The task of absorbing the additional 70,000 people expected to \nenter the labor market during the period covered by the 9th FYP (2002-2007) is challenging, \ngiven the low employment elasticity of the power sector, which is the largest industry in Bhutan. \nThe unemployment rate countrywide is 2\u20133%, but in urban areas it is 4.1% and, among those \naged 15 to 19 years, the urban unemployment figure is as high as 10.9%. The summary poverty \nreduction and social strategy is included in Appendix 3. \n \n8.  Thimphu Urban Strategy and Structural Plan. The capital city of Thimphu has had \ntwo major planning activities in the past that form basis for its latest expansion: the Thimphu ", "  3\nUrban  Development  Strategy3 and  the  Thimphu  Structural  Plan.4 The  latter  resulted  from \nincreased pressure from both governments and major landowners in the peripheral areas, \nleading the Government to depart from its strategic incremental approach and undertake a \ncomprehensive structural plan. The structural plan proposed full provision of infrastructure along \nthe entire north-south urban corridor prior to land release. However, the Government\u2019s ability to \nfund this from its own revenues is limited. The structural plan detailed appropriate amounts of \nland required to accommodate expected population and economic growth, allowing for influx to \nthe city. Its project boundary was the urban area of Thimphu, including the outlying areas. It \nundertook  a  detailed  planning  exercise  and  delineated  major  roads,  transportation  routes, \nneighborhood service nodes, land-use zoning, housing and shelter systems, and infrastructure \nsystems for the entire urban area. Following recommendations from the structural plan, in 2001, \n10 neighboring areas around old Thimphu were incorporated into greater Thimphu City and \nplaced under the management of the Thimphu City Corporation (TCC).  \n \n9.  Devolution of Power and Public Services Responsibility. The Royal decree of 1995 \ngranted autonomous status to TCC. Subsequently, in December 2003, a charter was issued in \naccordance with the provisions of the Bhutan Municipal Act 1999 providing autonomy to TCC, \nso that it could effectively and equitably provide services to the residents of the Thimphu \nmunicipal area. The executive head of TCC is the thrompon (mayor), who is appointed by the \nGovernment for a duration of its discretion. In accordance with the provisions of the act and the \ncharter,  TCC  is  directed  by  a  municipal  committee  consisting  of  elected  and  nominated \nmembers. Its functions cover the following: (i) formulating policies and development priorities of \nTCC, (ii) establishing procedures and guidelines, (iii) adopting rules to enable TCC to carry out \nits functions, (iv) reviewing and approving TCC\u2019s annual budget, and (v) any other function that \nthe Government may assign to it. However, all decisions taken by the municipal committee must \nbe submitted to the Government for approval.  \n \n10.  Phuentsholing City Corporation (PCC). From a small hamlet of scattered hutments, \nPhuentsholing town has since 1950 seen unprecedented growth. Today, it is considered the \ncommercial capital of Bhutan. PCC came into being in 1983, though the charter approving its \nincorporation has yet to be issued. It is understood that a proposal for issuing the charter is \nbefore the Government and may be issued in 2006. Thus, as of today, PCC is not a separate \nentity like TCC, but can be considered an arm of the Department of Urban Development and \nEngineering  Services  (DUDES).  For  administrative  and  operational  convenience,  the \nGovernment has appointed a thrompon for PCC. As with TCC, PCC has a municipal committee, \nwhich functions similarly, with decisions made by the municipal committee of PCC also requiring \nsubmission  to  the  Government  for  approval.  Although  the  Government  has  stipulated  the \ndecentralization of planning and service provision to municipalities, in reality, capacity remains \nconstrained, and these functions are retained by MoWHS.  \n \n11.  Institutional and Staff Capacity. Engineers and urban planners in DUDES have had \nlimited  capacity-building  opportunities  through  external  assistance,  but  the  skills  base  and \nhuman resources in TCC and PCC are very constrained. In recent years, consultants have been \nrecruited  to  help  TCC  and  PCC  develop  much-needed  planning,  engineering  design,  and \nprocurement expertise. Against future needs for engineering and planning works foreseen for \nurban development, there is great concern that the staff of DUDES, TCC, and PCC require \nsignificant strengthening of their capacity. \n                                                 \n3  Public Works Department, United Nations Development Programme, and United Nations Centre for Human \nSettlements. 1999.

Limited Local Resource Mobilization. Currently, the two city corporations\u2019 revenue \nbases are not strong. According to the Bhutan Municipal Act (1999), their income is broadly \nsegregated into two categories: tax revenue and non-tax revenue. Tax revenue consists of \ntaxes on land, urban housing, under-developed land, property transfers, and entertainment. The \nGovernment determines the tax rates and manner of levying. Non-tax revenue consists of fees \nand charges such as for land development, sub-division, land demarcation, processing building \nplans, land registration, site plans, vehicle parking, market vending, advertising, water and \nsewerage, etc., as well as fines and penalties. \n \n13.  Dagana  Revenue  Base  and  Limited  Staff  Capacity. Dagana town, the capital of \nDagana Dzongkhag, is headed by a dzongda (district administrator), who is appointed by the \nGovernment.  Dagana  is  located  in  the  geographical  corridor,  which  include  Thimphu  and \nPhuentsholing. The dzongkhag administration is responsible for developing, maintaining and \noperating public infrastructure and services in its jurisdiction. With regard to tax revenues, \nDagana, like other dzonkhag capitals, still falls under the non-urban category, so its tax revenue \nis very limited. Dagana Dzongkhag administration\u2019s operational expenses depend entirely on \ncentral Government subsidy at present. The engineering staff5 undertakes all work for the 11 \ngeogs (counties) and four towns in Dagana, but planning and design are undertaken by DUDES \nin Thimphu.  \n \n14.  External Assistance in Urban Sector. In the last decade, ADB, Government of India, \nWorld  Bank,  and  Danida  have  been  the  key  players  providing  external  assistance  to  the \nGovernment  for  developing  its  urban  sector.  While  India  has  been  a  key  donor  for  large \ninfrastructure projects such as roads and bridges, Danida has supported the Government\u2019s \nprovision of urban infrastructure such as water and waste treatment plants in Thimphu and \nPhuentsholing, a landfill site in Phuentsholing, and pilot housing through various projects. The \nmost recent Danida-supported project is for environment and urban sector program support and \nincludes capacity building and institutional support for the sector, such as capacity building of \nthe local bodies and strengthening environmental management. Danida is currently shifting its \nfocus from major urban centers to five provincial towns. The World Bank has provided various \nsmall-scale infrastructure and capacity-building projects, including utility billing and account \nmanagement, in 10 dzongkhag towns through its Bhutan Urban Development Project 1. The \nGovernment is currently requesting the World Bank to expand its assistance to two or three \nadditional dzongkhag towns and Thimphu. Based on an agreement with the Government, ADB \ncontinues to assist Thimphu and Phuentsholing and is also taking up one of the remaining \ndzongkhag towns, namely Dagana. As there is a great need for infrastructure development in \nthe newly extended areas of Thimphu, the Government, ADB, and World Bank have agreed to \nsplit assistance in local area development geographically, with ADB taking southern Thimphu \nand the World Bank taking northern areas (Appendix 4). Since ADB\u2019s lending operations in \nBhutan began in 1983, it has funded 19 projects with a cumulative value of $111.2 million and \n90 technical assistance activities. The overarching goal of ADB\u2019s development assistance to \nBhutan, as articulated in its country strategy and program6 (2006\u20132010), is poverty reduction \nthrough economic diversification, and its development strategies for achieving this goal focus \nmainly on helping the Government reduce poverty through rural electrification, road network \nexpansion, infrastructure improvements in regional centers, and basic skills development.     \n                                                 \n5  For urban development and municipal services, the dzongkhag administration has a district engineer supported by \nan assistant engineer, 5 junior engineers, and 12 support staff. Dagana town has a population of about 1,200 \naccording to the latest census.  \n6  Asian Development Bank. 2005. Country Strategy and Program (2006-2010): Bhutan. Manila (September). ", "  5\nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n15.  The primary impact of the Project is improved urban infrastructure and urban services \nmanagement in Thimphu, Phuentsholing, and Dagana, which will contribute to increasing the \ngrowth potential in these areas. The outcomes of the Project will include (i) improving urban \ninfrastructure planning; (ii) constructing urban roads, drainage, and other urban facilities; (iii) \nbroadening  water  treatment,  supply,  and  sanitation  coverage;  (iv)  enhancing  community \nawareness of proper hygiene; and (v) providing capacity building in urban facility management \nto staff of project municipalities and MoWHS.    \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n16.  The Project will have five components. Component A: Thimphu Urban Improvement will \ninclude (i) city-level works consisting of water supply source augmentation, treatment, and \ndistribution; upgrading of the existing wastewater treatment plant; and providing solid waste \nmanagement infrastructure and equipment; and (ii) local urban infrastructure provision in four of \nthe five new local areas of southern Thimphu currently being developed by TCC. Component B: \nPhuentsholing Urban Improvement will include (i) roads and drainage, (ii) footpaths and a \npedestrian  bridge,  and  (iii)  social  infrastructure  such  as  fire  hydrants  and  street  lighting. \nComponent C: Dagana Urban Improvement will include (i) water supply source augmentation, \ntreatment and distribution system improvement; (ii) sanitation improvement; and (iii) roads and \ndrainage provision. Component D: Technical Support will include (i) capacity building in DUDES \nand the implementing agencies, and (ii) public awareness enhancement. Component E: Project \nImplementation Support will include consulting services for (i) the project management unit \n(PMU), and (ii) to support project implementation unit (PIU) design, monitoring, and supervision.   \n \n  1.   Component A: Thimphu Southern and City-level Improvement  \n \na.  City-Level Water Supply Augmentation and Distribution \n \n17.    To meet projected water demand in the southern areas of Thimphu, a new water supply \nsystem will be developed. This new South Thimphu water supply system will serve the areas on \nthe eastern left bank of the Wang Chhu, extending from Changjiji in the north to Serbithang in \nthe south. To design an appropriate and least-cost water supply system that would ensure \ndistribution to all project areas by gravity and so minimize resource requirements\u2014both financial \ncosts  and  human  resources  for  O&M\u2014project  preparatory  technical  assistance  assessed \nvarious options for siting the water intake and treatment plant, such as at Ola Rongchu, Ngabi \nRongchu, or Megoipang, as well as treatment methods. Based on these assessments, the \noption of constructing a water intake and treatment plant that uses a simple sand filtration \nprocess in the Megoipang valley was adopted for the Project. The subcomponents will therefore \ninclude (i) constructing at Megoipang an intake and water treatment plant (WTP) with a capacity \nof 6,000 cubic meters (m3)/day; (ii) installing 19 kilometers (km) of water supply mains and an \nassociated  distribution  network;  (iii)  constructing  break-pressure  and  storage  tanks;  (iv) \nimproving 5 km of access road to the WTP; (v) purchasing and installing five bulk meters; and \n(vi) helping TCC develop guidelines and standard operating procedures for water services, \nincluding, among other things, how households will connect. The intake and WTP site will \noccupy approximately 1 hectare of land and include the plant, workshop, and administrative \nbuildings; living quarters for operations staff; and tanks for water storage and clearing. The WTP \n ", " 6                         \nwill consist of simple sedimentation and filtration units, to minimize operation and maintenance \n(O&M) and human resource costs, and use chlorine to disinfect. \n \nb.  City-Level Waste Water Treatment Plant Upgrade  \n \n18.  With the increase in population and water supply, the capacity of the existing wastewater \ntreatment plant (WWTP) in Babesa, currently estimated at 1,750m3/day, will need upgrading. \nThe Project will install mechanical aerators in the existing facultative ponds to increase WWTP \ncapacity to 5,250m3/day. The WWTP has adequate adjacent land on which to further expand \ncapacity to meet projected requirements for the next 20 years. The Project will install a flow \nmeter at the WWTP. \n \nc.  City-Level Solid Waste Management  \n \n19.  To help TCC minimize and manage its growing municipal solid waste burden, a project \nsubcomponent will include (i) rehabilitating the existing landfill site in Mimilakha and providing \nlandfill site machinery (e.g., a compactor), to increase capacity and potentially cover the next 5 \nyears of municipal waste generation; (ii) providing an electrical substation, upgrading the access \nroad, and fencing the perimeter to make operational the existing Serbithang Pilot Composting \nPlant; (iii) constructing a sorting and recycling center to enable waste separation and recycling;7 \nand (iv) purchasing waste collection equipment to allow the separation of waste at source and \nminimize the need for waste disposal at the landfill. The detailed design of the physical works \nand procurement of equipment will only be carried out pursuant to the completion of the Solid \nWaste Management Strategy and  Action Plan for Thimphu covered under a piggy-backed \nadvisory TA (see para. 47). Works under this subcomponent will be carried out in conjunction \nwith a public awareness campaign covered under Component D (para. 25). Pursuant to the \ncompletion of a solid waste management (SWM) strategy and action plan acceptable to ADB, \nand discussions at the midterm review, the Project may include necessary preparatory works, \nincluding surveys for the future landfill site for Thimphu. \n \nd.  Local Area Infrastructure Development in South Thimphu \n  \n20.  Out of 10 new local areas currently being developed by TCC, the Project will develop \nunder this subcomponent infrastructure in four local areas (Lungtenpu, Babesa, Simtokha and \nChangbandu)8 located adjacent to the existing Tashi Chhodzong\u2013Babesa Expressway. The \nsubcomponent will include (i) approximately 20 km of secondary and tertiary roads, as well as \nassociated drainage, to connect the four local areas to major service roads and the expressway; \n(ii) a network of approximately 30 km of secondary and tertiary water distribution pipes; (iii) a \nsewerage collection network of approximately 16.5 km, including 300 manhole chambers and \nassociated structures; and (iv) the provision of approximately 14.6 km of ducting for power and \ntelecommunication networks, 650 meters of service pits, and associated structures.  \n \n2.   Component B: Phuentsholing Urban Improvement  \n \n21.  The  component  will  include  (i)  improvements  to  2.8  km  of  the  road  network;  (ii) \nimprovements to road junctions; (iii) developing four parking lots and 1.2 km of footpaths; (iv) \nconstructing one pedestrian bridge over the Om (Dhoti) River; (v) providing approximately 100 \n                                                 \n7  The subcomponent will include facilitating the involvement of households and communities in waste separation and \nrecycling through public awareness programs developed through the piggy-backed TA (para. 47).  \n8  Listing of local areas is in the order of development stage; Luntenphu is most advanced in reaching landlords\u2019 land \npooling agreement. ", "  7\nstreet  lights;  (vi)  purchasing  and  installing  five  hydrants;  and  (viii)  developing  social \ninfrastructure consisting of a mini public stadium, a central public square (Upper Market Precinct \nImprovement), and river bank improvements. \n \n  3.   Component C: Dagana Urban Improvement \n \na.  Water Supply  \n \n22.   Various options were assessed while designing an appropriate and least-cost water \nsupply system to ensure distribution to all Project areas by gravity and minimize resource \nrequirements for O&M. Based on these assessments, the construction of two new intakes, \nrehabilitation of the existing intake, and construction of a WTP using simple sand filtration units \nat the existing site (using the existing break-pressure tank) was adopted. The subcomponents \nwill therefore include (i) developing two new intakes and rehabilitating the existing intake; (ii) \nconstructing a WTP of 300 m3/day capacity  consisting of simple sand filtration units, with \nchlorine disinfection and storage tanks located in an area of 0.5 hectares; (iii) installing 8 km of \nwater mains supplied by gravity to all areas of the town; and (iv) constructing two break-\npressure tanks. The installation of secondary and tertiary distribution networks, approximately \n200 household water supply connections,9 and subcomponents B and C below, will be carried \nout pursuant to the completion and acceptance by ADB of the Dagana Geotechnical and Slope \nStability Study, to be carried out under the piggy-backed advisory TA (para. 47). For secondary \nreticulation of the water supply, 1.2 km of the 50 millimeter supply pipelines recently installed by \nDagana Dzongkhag will be reused. \n \nb.  Roads and Drainage \n \n23.  The subcomponent will provide improvements and extension to 1.1 km of main roads in \nthe  new  high  street  development  area  and  the  road  leading  to  the  National  Housing \nDevelopment Corporation colony, as well as associated roadside drainage.  \n \nc.  Sanitation \n \n24.  The  subcomponent  will  include  (i)  installing  a  collection  network  for  overflow  from \nhousehold septic tanks in the densely populated high street development area, as well as \nconstructing a simple sewage-stabilization pond on 1 hectare of land, and (ii) providing a septic \ndesludging machine. \n \n4.   Component D: Technical Support \n \n25.  The subcomponent will include technical support by providing (i) consulting services and \nprocuring equipment required for the following: (a) capacity building of DUDES, TCC, PCC and \nDagana Dzongkhag; (b) public awareness support in Thimphu to improve community health and \nsanitation  and  promote  civic  responsibility; 10  and  (ii)  training  courses  for  professional, \noperational,  and  technical  staff  of  DUDES,  TCC,  PCC,  and  Dagana  Dzongkhag  through \nmedium- and long-term training courses. This will assist staff members of DUDES, PCC, TCC, \nand Dagana Dzongkhag enhance their managerial and operational capacity for the proper \nplanning, operation, and maintenance of urban services.  \n \n                                                 \n9 The Project will provide connection to the meter point.  \n10 This will include public awareness support to educate waste generator, and health impacts on waste handlers.  \n ", " 8                         \n5.   Component E: Project Implementation Support  \n \n26.  The subcomponent will include consulting services for the PMU and to support PIU \ndesign, monitoring, and supervision. It will help the PMU and PIUs design, implement and \nsupervise the various interventions under the Project. Consulting support will include (i) project \nmanagement and monitoring; (ii) the detailed design of subcomponents; (iii) contract document \npreparation  and  structuring,  tendering,  evaluation,  execution,  and  management;  (iv) \nconstruction supervision; and (v) the preparation and execution of capacity-building programs. \n \nC.   Special Features \n \n27.  Public  Awareness  Support.  The  Project  will  improve  community  awareness  and \npromote civic responsibility. For example, the solid waste management subcomponent will, with \neffective awareness-raising activities, contribute to solving the problem through better waste \nsegregation at source and a reduction of non-biodegradable items, such as plastic bottles, to \nenable management measures such as recycling and composting of biodegradable items to \nbecome cost effective. It will also support raising public awareness of the need for cost recovery \nin  urban  services,  i.e.  the  need  for  tariff  collection  as  well  as  promote  general  hygiene, \nsanitation, water conservation, and traffic management. Experts will be engaged to review the \ncurrent household- and city-level practices and recommend changes to improve services. \n \n28.  Land Pooling (LP) Process. In Thimphu\u2019s local areas, almost every plot is irregularly \nshaped and is landlocked without any infrastructure facilities, which leaves very limited options \nfor urban development. One option is to develop only those land parcels where services and \namenities can be easily fitted through guided land development, but this would incur uneven \ndevelopment skewed by the original agricultural layout and further fragment urban land. Where \nfield  boundaries  are  irregular,  road  alignments  tend  to  remain  irregular  and  lack  proper \ngeometry or allotment. Infrastructure servicing can be inefficient and expensive, as agricultural \nneeds have very little in common with those of modern services (e.g., drinking water), and \naccommodating proper drainage in narrow lanes is difficult. The other option is site-and-services \nprovision through land acquisition, to be developed by public authorities or through private real \nestate agencies. TCC or private developers would acquire the whole local area for planned \ndevelopment, but this would not necessarily benefit many original landowners; as in many other \ncountries, real estate companies usually buy land cheaply from owners and later sell at a much \nhigher price to well-off households. In addition, there is no private real estate developer in \nBhutan to take all the financial risks of such a large investment or commit to providing sufficient \nurban services, nor does TCC have the required resources. LP has been appraised as the most \nappropriate tool for local area planning in Thimphu in the 10 newly incorporated areas. LP is a \ntechnique used to redefine ownership of land in a way that creates a new configuration of plots \nmore appropriate for urban structures and uses. Urban land development is realized through the \ncontribution of a certain portion of land from each owner, proportionate to his or her holdings, \nwhich produces sufficient land for the provision of public roads, public infrastructure, social \nfacilities,  and  open  space.  The  LP  plan  will  include  safeguards  and,  to  further  ensure \ncompliance with ADB safeguards policies, the following needs are addressed: (i) ensuring \nconsultation  with  non-titled  affected  persons  (APs),  (ii)  identifying  impacts  on  all  affected \npersons (APs) and ensuring compensation at replacement cost for vulnerable and non-titled \nAPs, (iii) agreement from 100% of landowners verified by the Office of Legal Affairs (OLA) as a \nthird party,11 and (iv) improving mechanisms for grievance redress. In these areas, further \n                                                 \n11  Another third party will be identified and included as witness on the side of the landowner in line with a legal \nopinion from OLA (19 July 2006). ", "  9\nconsultations  were  conducted,  particularly  with  non-titled  APs;  the  summary  resettlement \nframework was disclosed and explained to APs particularly regarding entitlements and the \nstrengthened grievance redress mechanism.12  \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan  \n \n29.  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $30.75 million equivalent, including taxes, \nduties, interest charges on the ADB loan, and physical and price contingencies.

Financing Plan  \n \n30.  A  loan  of  $24.60  million  equivalent  (SDR16,597,000)  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources will be provided to finance the Project. The loan will have a term of 32 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, with interest charged at the rate of 1% per annum during the \ngrace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. The loan will cover 80% of the total project cost. \nInterest during the project implementation period will be capitalized. The remaining $6.15 million \nequivalent (20% of the total project cost) will be provided by the Government to finance taxes \nand duties, resettlement cost, land acquisition, and part of the civil works. The financing plan is \nsummarized in Table 2. \n                                                 \n12  Attached as Appendix 11 is the Draft Summary Resettlement Framework for LP related works of Component A, \nwhich sets out the basis, structure, and detailed process proposed for LP in this case. \n ", " 1 0                        \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \nSource  Total Cost  Percent \nAsian Development Bank  24.60  80 \nGovernment   6.15  20 \nTotal  30.75  100 \n                             Source: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n                  \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n31.  The Executing Agency (EA) for the Project will be DUDES. The EA will establish a PMU \nlocated at DUDES premises and headed by the project manager. The PMU, supported by a \nteam of project management consultants (PMC), will be the key organization for ensuring the \noverall execution and implementation of the Project. The PMU will be responsible for planning, \nmonitoring, and reporting on the Project, as well as for cost and quality control. It will  (i) serve \nas the secretariat for the project steering committee (PSC); (ii) undertake project management, \nadministration, and interagency coordination at the executive level; (iii) supervise and guide the \nPIUs; (iv) maintain project accounts; (v) oversee procurement procedures to ensure compliance \nwith the Government\u2019s and ADB\u2019s policies and procedures; (vi) liaise with ADB for quarterly \nproject progress updates and other reporting and communication matters; and (vii) prepare the \nproject completion report to the Government and ADB. The EA will ensure that, throughout the \nproject implementation period, adequate allocations of counterpart funds are made, approved, \nand released in a timely manner to ensure proper project implementation. The EA will provide \nadequate office space for the Project and ensure that the facilities provided under the Project \nare operated and maintained appropriately.  \n \n32.  TCC will be the Implementing Agency (IA) for Component A, PCC for Component B, \nDagana Dzongkhag for Component C, and DUDES for Components D and E. Three PIUs will \nbe established within TCC, PCC and Dagana dzongkhag administration, supported by sufficient \nprofessional staff dedicated to the Project and by design, monitoring, and supervision (DMS) \nconsultants.  \n \n33.  A central PSC will be set up under the chairmanship of MoWHS Secretary to facilitate \nand  ensure  adequate  coordination  among  various  ministries,13 the  EA,  IAs,  and  relevant \nstakeholders, and provide guidance to the PMU and PIUs. In particular, the PSC will (i) meet at \nleast  quarterly  or  more  frequently  if  required,  (ii)  provide  guidance  for  and  ensure  the \nimplementation of Government and ADB policies for the Project, (iii) assist in resolving any \ninteragency implementation problems, (iv) review relevant reports and audit statements from the \nPMU and PIUs as and when required, and (v) ensure that conditions of the Project agreements \nwith ADB are met. Three local PSCs will also be established in Thimphu, Phuentsholing, and \nDagana under the chairmanship of TCC thrompon, PCC thrompon, and Dagana Dzongda to \nensure  coordination  and  provide  guidance  for  local  implementation.  For  efficient  project \nimplementation, the central and local PSCs will be set up within 3 months of loan effectiveness. \nThe implementation framework describing the arrangement mentioned above is in Appendix 6. \n \n                                                 \n13 Committee members of the PSC will include the following: Department of Aid Coordination and Debt Management \n(Ministry  of  Finance),  National  Environment  Commission,  Hydromat  Services  Unit  (Department  of  Energy), \nMoWHS, TCC, PCC, Dagana dzongkhag administration, Bhutan Power Corporation, and Bhutan Telecom.  ", " 11\n34.  The PIUs will be responsible for the day-to-day operations of project construction and \nmanagement including (i) preparing detailed design and works contract documentation, (ii) \ncalling for tenders and awarding contracts, (iii) preparing budgets to ensure necessary funds are \navailable in time to meet contractual requirements, (iv) supervising and monitoring contracts, (v) \ncertifying the progress claims and payment of contractors, (vi) ensuring quality control of works, \n(vii) preparing progress reports for the PMU, and (viii) contract administration.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period  \n35.  The Project will be implemented over 6 years. Implementation is expected to commence \nin the fourth quarter of 2006 and complete in the second quarter of 2012. Key start-up activities \ninclude the following: (i) appointing the project manager, (ii) establishing the central and local \nPSCs, (iii) establishing the PMU and PIUs, (iv) recruiting project staff, the PMC, and the DMS \nconsultant; (v) commencing detailed design, and (vi) implementing resettlement plans. The \nproject implementation schedule is in Appendix 7. \n \n3.  Procurement \n36.  Procurement  of  all  goods  and  services  under  the  Project  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (April 2006). All contracts for works estimated \nto cost the equivalent of more than $1 million will be awarded by international competitive \nbidding (ICB) procedures. Contracts estimated to cost less than $1 million will be carried out \nusing  national  competitive  bidding  or  other  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB  under  its \nProcurement Guidelines. The procurement of goods will preferably be grouped into packages \nlarger than $500,000 to be suitable for international competitive bidding procedures. Goods that \ncannot be grouped into larger contracts and are estimated to cost less than $500,000 will follow \nADB\u2019s limited international bidding procedures, and miscellaneous minor goods expected to \ncost under $100,000 equivalent will be purchased using shopping procedures. The proposed \nprocurement plan is in Appendix 8.  \n \n37.  While procurement will generally be carried out by the PIUs under the guidance of the \nPMU, equipment and vehicle rentals common to all project areas will be procured by the PMU.  \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n38.  All consultants under the Project will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants by the Asian Development Bank and its Borrowers (April 2006). \nWhile the PMC and DMS consultants will be recruited using quality- and cost-based selection, \nfor smaller packages and specialized consulting services under Component D of the Project, \nconsultants may be selected and engaged using methods such as consultants\u2019 qualifications \nselection, quality-based selection, single source selection, or individual consultants selection as \nreflected  in  the  procurement  plan.  An  international  consulting  firm  (51  person-months  of \ninternational consulting services and 179 person-months of national) will be engaged as PMC to \nassist the PMU in overall project management and implementation. Similarly, an international \nconsulting firm (49 person-months of international consulting services and 68 person-months of \nnational) will be engaged as DMS consultant to assist the PIUs in the design, monitoring, and \nsupervision of contracts under the Project.14  \n \n                                                 \n14 Outline terms of reference for consulting services is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n ", " 1 2                        \n  5.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n39.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998) was explained to and discussed with the Government \nand  DUDES.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations \nand the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of the EA, IAs, and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, \nand other service providers as they relate to the Project.15 \n \n40.  The Government will ensure (i) submission of general procurement notice to ADB for \npublication in accordance with the Procurement Guidelines and (ii), upon receiving ADB\u2019s \u201cno \nobjection\u201d to the recommendation of the contract award, shall publish in daily newspapers \ncirculated nationally, both in English and the local language, the results identifying the bid and \nlot numbers, and also (a) the name of each bidder, (b) bid prices as read out at bid opening, (c) \nname and evaluated prices of each bid that was evaluated, (d) names of bidders whose bids \nwere rejected and the reasons for their rejection, and (e) the name of the winning bidder and the \nprice it offered, as well as the duration and summary scope of the contract awarded. In addition \nto  the  standard  ADB  requirements,  to  deter  corruption  and  increase  transparency,  the \nGovernment will create a webpage in the existing DUDES website, and public disclosure board \noutside  the  project  office,  disclosing  information  on  various  matters  regarding  the  Project, \nincluding procurements related to it.   \n \n41.  The Government will allow and assist ADB's representatives\u2019 carrying out random spot \nchecks on the work in progress and utilization of funds for the Project. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n42.  Withdrawal  of  loan  proceeds  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (January 2001), as amended from time to time, and detailed arrangements between \nADB and the Government. To ensure the timely release of loan proceeds and efficient project \nimplementation, an imprest account will be established at the Royal Monetary Authority of \nBhutan for the Department of Aid and Debt Management (DADM) of the Ministry of Finance \nimmediately  after  loan  effectiveness.  DADM  will  be  responsible  for  managing  the  imprest \naccount and ensuring the timely release of funds. Statement of expenditure (SOE) procedures \nmay be used for reimbursing eligible expenditures and liquidating advances to the imprest \naccount for any individual payments not exceeding the equivalent of $50,000. The advance to \nthe imprest account will be limited to expected projected disbursement for the next 6 months or \n10% of the loan, whichever is lower. Auditors satisfactory to ADB will audit the use of the \nimprest account and SOE procedures. A separate audit opinion on the use of the imprest \naccount and SOE procedures will be included in the annual audit report.  \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n43.  The PMU and PIUs will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify \nfinancing resources received and expenditures made on the Project, including all goods, works, \n                                                 \n15 ADB is discussing with the Government an anticorruption act. ADB is requested to provide an informal review on \nthe draft act, particularly the penal and criminal sections.  ", " 13\nand services financed by the loan proceeds and Government funds. The project accounts and \nrelated  financial  statements  will  be  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  sound  auditing \nstandards by auditors acceptable to ADB. The Government will submit annual audited reports \nand related financial statements to ADB within 6 months after the close of each fiscal year. 16 \nDUDES was made aware of ADB\u2019s policy on delayed submission and also of the importance \nthat the quality of audited reports be acceptable.  \n \n44.  The PMU will prepare brief monthly progress reports in a format acceptable to ADB with \ninformation on (i) progress made against established targets, including pre-identified monitoring \nindicators; (ii) delays and problems encountered and actions taken to resolve them; (iii) work \ncarried out by consultants; (iv) updated results of water-quality monitoring and action taken on \nproblems encountered; (v) changes in project staff; (vi) compliance with loan covenants; (vii) a \nproposed program of activities for the next month; and (viii) progress expected during the next 3 \nmonths. The monthly report will be submitted to ADB by the end of first week of the following \nmonth. Within 3 months of physical completion of the Project, the PMU will prepare and submit \nto  ADB  a  project  completion  report  on  the  execution  of  the  Project,  including  costs  and \ncompliance with loan covenants. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n45.  A list of verifiable performance indicators will be prepared by the PMC in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Project Performance Management System (PPMS). The system will establish a \ncause-and-effect relationship between the Project and its impact. The PPMS will comprise (i) a \ncomprehensive list of implementation-related performance indicators duly collected, monitored, \nand recorded by the PMU and PIUs and semiannually assessed by MoWHS and (ii) post-\ncompletion performance and impact data collected by the PMU. Baseline and impact data will \nbe disaggregated by city, town, and local area and by other dimensions to be discussed at \nproject inception. Implementation of performance monitoring will integrate financial and other \naspects. The PMC, through the PMU, will establish the PPMS satisfactory to ADB within 1 year \nof the loan effective date.   \n \n9.  Project Review \n46.  The Project will be reviewed jointly by the EA, IAs, and ADB semiannually to assess \nimplementation progress. A comprehensive midterm review will be carried out by the EA, IAs \nand ADB 3 years after commencement of the Project. Taking into account the PPMS results, \nthe  midterm  review  will  (i)  review  and  evaluate  the  scope,  design,  and  implementation \narrangements of the Project; (ii) evaluate the progress of the institutional development and \ncapacity of the IAs; (iii) identify changes needed in any of the areas mentioned above; (iv) \nassess  the  implementation  performance  against  agreed  project  indicators  and  targets;  (v) \nreview  and  establish  compliance  with  the  loan  covenants;  and  (v)  identify  critical  issues, \nproblems, and constraints, if any, and, if necessary, recommend adjustments in project design \nor implementation arrangements. \n \n                                                 \n16  The  Royal  Audit  Authority  is  being  supported  by  ADB  technical  assistance  on  introducing  financial  and \nperformance audits. \n ", " 1 4                        \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n47.  TA of $250,000 for Capacity Building in Urban Infrastructure Planning and Management \n(Appendix 9) will be provided17 to enhance the capacity of staff at TCC, PCC, and Dagana, as \nADB\u2019s  country  assistance  performance  evaluation  found  in  May  2005  that  the  successful \nimplementation of civil works should be supported by long-term sector involvement combined \nwith capacity-building programs and investment support. To this end, TA will consist of the \nfollowing four components: (i) a solid waste management strategy and action plan for Thimphu, \n(ii) a Dagana geotechnical and slope stability study, (iii) unaccounted-for water (UFW) reduction \nand water calibration for Thimphu and Phuentsholing, and (iv) assistance on LP and managing \nurban facilities. The first component will develop a comprehensive plan, identifying concrete \nshort-, medium-, and long-term measures to minimize and manage solid waste in Thimphu. \nWhile the short-term measures may include rehabilitation of the existing landfill site, medium- to \nlong-term measures will include identifying a future site for a landfill and recycling center for \nThimphu and improving waste segregation at source and waste collection. This component will \nalso  look  at  the  potential  for  private  sector  participation  in  the  solid  waste  management, \nincluding composting operations. The second component, the Dagana geotechnical and slope \nstability study, will be conducted to ensure the project area\u2019s long-term geotechnical stability \nand minimize potential risks to residents and infrastructure, especially assessing the area\u2019s soil \nconditions and landslide risk for its inhabitants. Current financial records of TCC and PCC show \nthat both city corporations\u2019 water supply operations are self-sustaining to the extent that general \nmaintenance costs are recovered but are unable to cover needed repair and expansion of water \ncoverage. Therefore, the third component will include (i) developing an understanding and \nprocedures within PCC and TCC for identifying UFW and (ii) implementing a UFW-reduction \nprogram, including documents for a performance-based bid invitation. The fourth component will \nprovide advisory review for smoother LP implementation and urban facility management.18 TA \nwill be financed as a grant from the ADB TA funding program and be carried out by individual \nconsultants to be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \nInternational inputs of about 5 months and national consultant inputs of about 16 months are \nrequired.   \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.   Expected Project Benefits and Impacts \n \n48.  The main benefits of the Project will be (i) improved health and general living standards \nfor  residents  of  Thimphu,  Phuentsholing,  and  Dagana,  which  will  help  achieve  Millennium \nDevelopment  Goals;  (ii)  sustained  and  reliable  urban  services  through  more  effective  city \ncorporation management; and (iii) improved economic and social conditions in the three towns \narising  from  investments  in  roads,  drainage,  water  supply  and  sanitation,  solid  waste \nmanagement, and other community facilities. \n \n49.  The Project will provide improved water supply and sanitation facilities and associated \nhealth services to about 19,000 people in poor areas selected for low coverage and high \nincidence  of  diarrhea  and  other  sanitation-related  illness.  An  estimated  55,000  people  will \ndirectly benefit from the urban infrastructure subcomponents. The Project will also strengthen \n                                                 \n17  The attached TA will also seek an additional $50,000 from the Cooperation Fund for the Water Sector for top-up \nsupport.   \n18  This should not duplicate with other TAs provided under ADB Road Network project or City Development Strategy  \nassistance under the Cities Alliance (World Bank and United Nations Environment Programme as co-sponsors),  \n2006.  ", " 15\nthe capacity and capability of staff in two city corporations, TCC and PCC, such that they will be \nbetter able to upgrade infrastructure in a more coherently strategic manner, plan budgets for \ncontinued  maintenance  and  repair  needs,  and  so  reduce  the  frequency  of  unwarranted \nbreakdowns. In addition, predominantly local private contractors and their workers and suppliers \nwill benefit from the flow of more than $27 million in contracts for civil works and equipment over \nthe 6 years of the Project.19       \n \nB.   Environment and Social Safeguards \n \n1.  Environment \n \n50.  The  EA  has  prepared  an  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  following  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003).  The  IEE \n(Supplementary Appendix D) shows that the Project will result in substantial net environmental \nand public health benefits. These include (i) better public health from improved water supply, \ndrainage, and solid waste management; (ii) reduced downstream pollution and incidence of \nwaterborne  diseases  from  improved  wastewater  collection  and  treatment;  (iii)  reduced  air \npollution from road and junction improvements; and (iv) improved quality of life from urban \namenities.  Consultations  and  meetings  with  stakeholders  were  undertaken  during  IEE \npreparation to provide general and environment-related information and to obtain feedback on \nproject-related  issues  of  public  concern.  The  salient  points  of  the  IEE  are  summarized  in \nAppendix 10. \n \n51.   The  selection  of  project  components  focused  on  considering  the  most  severe \nenvironmental risks, alleviating waste accumulation problems, and using appropriate and readily \nadopted  technology.  The  Project  will  not  generate  any  significant  negative  environmental \nimpacts. Potential negative environmental impacts, mostly associated with construction, are \ntemporary  and  localized.  The  IEE  contains  (i)  environmental  management  plans  for \nimplementing  mitigation  measures  and  (ii)  an  environmental  monitoring  plan  identifying \nmonitoring  parameters  and  responsible  agencies  to  ensure  that  mitigation  measures  are \nproperly undertaken and potential negative environmental impacts are addressed. The IEE \nconcludes that no further assessment on environmental impacts is required beyond issues to be \nreviewed during detailed design. \n \n2.  Social \n \n52.  Resettlement. The EA prepared draft resettlement plans for Component A (Thimphu), B \n(Phuentsholing), and C (Dagana) following the Government\u2019s Land Act of 1979 (amended in \n1991) and Land Compensation Rate (1996) and ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement \n(1995).20 The Project minimizes land acquisition and resettlement. In Thimphu, there will be no \nland acquisition, but required land will be obtained through LP. An estimated 497 seasonal \nworkers and 173 leaseholders will be affected. The impacts on these affected persons (APs) are \nnot anticipated to be substantial as the affected sources of income are not significant. The \nsocioeconomic survey of APs shows that the average seasonal worker is employed for only 9 or \n10 days a year. An assessment of the Project\u2019s involuntary resettlement impacts will be finalized \nduring detailed design, and an updated resettlement plan will be reviewed and approved by \nADB prior to the award of contracts for works. To ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s policy and \n                                                 \n19 The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 3.    \n20  Supplementary Appendixes F, G, and H.  \n ", " 1 6                        \nrequirements on voluntary donation,21 a resettlement framework22 to guide the implementation \nof the LP scheme has been formulated by the EA. A summary of the resettlement framework is \nin Appendix 11. \n \n53.  In  Phuentsholing,  the  selection  criteria  of  project  components  included  resettlement \nimpacts. To the extent possible, priority was given to components involving rehabilitation on the \npremises of existing urban infrastructure and construction of new facilities on Government land. \nResettlement impacts will be further minimized through careful siting and alignment during \ndetailed design. There will be no land acquisition in Phuentsholing, but the Project will have \nimpact on four residential and one commercial structure owned by the Government, and on a \nGovernment plot leased for use as a scrap yard. New residential quarters will be provided to the \nfour affected households, who are employees of the Royal Bhutan Army, and impacts on \nleaseholders  and  their  10  employees  are  addressed  in  the  resettlement  plan,  which  is \nsummarized in Appendix 12. \n \n54.  Permanent acquisition of 1.1 hectares of land is required in Dagana for water and \nwastewater treatment, which will affect two households. Impacts are not anticipated to be \nsignificant,  as  land  to  be  acquired  is  vacant  and  not  used  for  productive  purposes.  The \nresettlement plan is summarized in Appendix 13. \n \n55.  Indigenous  People.  The  Project  provides  social  benefits  through  improved  and \nexpanded water supply, sanitation, roads, drainage, solid waste management, and community \nfacilities resulting in significant environmental and public health benefits in the project areas. \nSocial assessments undertaken during project preparation do not indicate significant adverse \nimpacts  on  vulnerable  groups  and  did  not  identify  any  indigenous  peoples,  as  the  urban \npopulation  of  the  project  areas  are  fully  mainstreamed.  The  resettlement  plan  provides \nadditional compensation to vulnerable groups including indigenous peoples, if any are found to \nbe affected during detailed design. \n \n56.  Gender. The Project will have no negative gender impacts. Significant environmental \nand public health benefits from the Project will accrue to both women and men. The social \nanalysis conducted during project preparation shows that there is overall gender equality, with \nwomen accorded equal or higher status, particularly regarding property inheritance, managing \ndomestic  finances,  business,  and  household  decisions  (with  women  often  heads  of \nhouseholds). The Project\u2019s water supply component will specifically benefit women because of \ntheir greater involvement in household and agricultural activities compared with men.  \n \nC.  Economic and Financial Benefits  \n   \n57.  Economic  Benefit.  Economic  cost  benefit  analysis  was  undertaken  for  the  water \nsupply, sewerage, solid waste management, and roads/drainage/transportation subcomponents \nin  Thimphu,  Phuentsholing,  and  Dagana.23 The  water  supply  subcomponent  will  bring  as \neconomic  benefit  (i)  savings  in  resource  costs  spent  obtaining  water  from  a  private  or \n                                                 \n21 These safeguards include (i) full consultation with landowners and any non-titled affected people on site selection; \n(ii) ensuring that voluntary donations do not severely affect the living standards of affected people, and are linked \ndirectly to benefits for the affected people, with community sanctioned measures to replace any losses that are \nagreed to through verbal and written record by affected people; (iii) any voluntary \u201cdonation\u201d will be confirmed \nthrough verbal and written record and verified by an independent third party such as a designated non-government \norganization or legal authority; and (iv) having adequate grievance redress mechanisms in place. \n22  Resettlement Framework for Component A (Thimphu) is Supplementary Appendix E.  \n23 Dagana is located in the geographical corridor which includes Thimphu and Phuentsholing.   ", " 17\ncommunity water scheme or standpipe, (ii) savings in time spent treating water, and (iii) the \nvalue of incremental water supply available from the Project. The sewerage subcomponent will \nbring (i) savings in resource costs spent constructing and maintaining septic tanks and (ii) \nreduced medical costs and productivity losses. The solid waste management subcomponent will \nbring savings in (i) time spent disposing of wastes and (ii) investment costs for a new landfill \nsite. The road/drainage/junction subcomponent will bring savings in (i) travel time and (ii) vehicle \noperating costs. Except for subcomponents in Dagana, the economic internal rates of return \n(EIRRs)  are  above  12%.  The  EIRR  for  the  whole  Project  is  21%.24 Preliminary  economic \nanalysis for the Dagana water subcomponent showed an EIRR of 13.1%. While the Dagana \nsewerage subcomponent showed a negative EIRR, it did not consider the potential savings in \nlandslide damage, which would be likely without wastewater management in the Project. \n \n58.  Financial Benefits and Financial Sustainability of the Project. Even though two city \ncorporations are moving towards financial autonomy for recurrent expenditures, they still receive \nsignificant budgetary support from the Government, while capital expenditures are fully met by \nGovernment  budgetary  allocations  without  any  debt  service  requirement.  This  budgetary \nsupport is expected to continue until the city corporations can implement revenue enhancement \nmeasures.25 Assuming this trend will continue for some time, financial projections for two city \ncorporations are made against the sustainability of the urban services under the Project. The \nanalysis shows that the financial impact due to the Project in the recurrent budget would not be \na significant problem, since (i) water and sewerage services from TCC can achieve full O&M \ncost recovery from 2011, (ii) incremental revenues from SWM services from TCC can cover \ntheir  incremental  costs  fully  from  2008  by  servicing  additional  households,  (iii)  additional \nrevenues from land  and urban house taxes and service charges26 can be raised from areas to \nbe  developed  in  Thimphu,  and  (iv)  parking  revenues  in  Phuentsholing  can  provide  full \nincremental O&M costs from 2012. On the other hand, the financial internal rates of return \n(FIRRs) for revenue-generating subcomponents in Thimphu and Dagana (i.e, water, sewerage, \nand SWM) are estimated below the weighted average cost of capital, in the range of -29% to \n-4%, while the FIRR for the revenue-generating subcomponent in Phuentsholing (i.e., parking) \nis estimated at a substantially higher rate of 14%. This is due to the tariff for water, sewerage, \nand SWM being set on a basis of full O&M cost recovery, as capital costs are provided as \ngrants to city corporations and the dzongkhag. While full cost recovery for urban services should \nbe encouraged in the long term, setting tariffs for full cost recovery in the short term would \nrequire  drastic,  politically  unacceptable  increases,  compromising  the  affordability  of  urban \nservices.   \n \nD.   Major Risks \n59.  As the scale of civil works under the Project in Thimphu will be large, some risks arise \nthat are common to road, water, and wastewater projects. These are (i) poor detailed design of \nsubprojects; (ii) a lack of experienced contractors available for larger civil work contracts; (iii) \npoor performance by appointed contractors; (iv) poor supervision and quality control of works by \nthe IAs; (v) construction material not being readily available; and (vi) a lack of suitably trained \noperators for completed plants.   \n \n                                                 \n24  See Supplementary Appendix B for details.  \n25 PCC has already approved a proposal for revenue enhancement measures and submitted it to the Government for \napproval. A similar proposal may be facilitated under the Project for TCC. However, the rates of major taxes, such \nas land tax and house tax, are determined by the Government, not by city corporations, so city corporations are \nconstrained in revenue enhancement tools. See Supplementary Appendix C for details.  \n26 The additional annual revenue will be around Nu2.6 million in fiscal year 2014. \n ", " 1 8                        \n60.  The other risk is associated with the LP exercise. LP requires extensive consultations \namong stakeholders that take time to reach agreement. While assessments undertaken during \nproject preparation show that the impacts on individual affected people or households are not \nexpected to be significant, ensuring compliance with safeguards may take time.27 It was noted \nduring project preparation that time and resources are required to conduct further consultations, \nparticularly with non-titled affected people, and ensure (i) compensation for any losses, (ii) that \nOLA  verifies  100%  of  agreements,  and  (iii)  adequate  provision  for  redressing  grievances. \nDelayed compliance with safeguards, particularly the provision of compensation, is a significant \nproject risk. The Government has provided the implementation schedule of the LP process in \nthe  project  area,  and  ADB  will  closely  monitor  the  progress  and  impact  on  vulnerable \nhouseholds.28 Moreover, the legal and administrative system relating to urban infrastructure is at \nan early stage of development and does not provide a statutory framework for LP. Because \nGovernment-implemented LP schemes in other areas have been the subjects of two litigations, \na legal opinion is being obtained from OLA to ensure the contractual validity of the proposed LP \nscheme. Furthermore, enabling provisions for LP are included in Bhutan\u2019s proposed urban land \ndevelopment/planning law, which will be presented to the National Assembly in late 2006. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances  \n \n61.   In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and DUDES have given the \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n(i)  The Government will immediately notify ADB of any proposed change to its \nadministrative structure and will take all steps necessary to ensure that project \narrangements  are  revised  in  consultation  with  ADB  to  reflect  the  new \nadministrative structure and the viability of the Project. \n(ii)  The Government will ensure that (a) all lands and rights-of-way required for the \nProject  are  made  available  in  a  timely  manner;  (b)  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement activities are carried out in accordance with all applicable laws, \nregulations, and policies of Bhutan, ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement \n(1995),  and  the  agreed  resettlement  plans  and  resettlement  framework;  (c) \npayment of compensation and other entitlements to the affected persons are \nmade prior to their relocation/displacement and commencement of civil works; (d) \nall  civil  works  contractors  engaged  comply  with  the  requirements  of  the \nresettlement plans; the applicable laws, regulations and policies of Bhutan; and \nADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement, to the extent applicable to contractors; \n(e) prior to the award of contract for works, updated resettlement plans based on \nfinal detailed design, endorsed by DUDES, are submitted to ADB for approval \nand  disclosure on ADB\u2019s website and to the affected persons; and (f) progress \nand completion reports on land acquisition, land pooling, and resettlement are \nsubmitted to ADB as set out in the resettlement plans. \n(iii)  The Government will ensure that the land pooling is implemented after free, prior, \nand  informed  consultation,  and  with  the  consent  of  the  affected  persons,  in \n                                                 \n27 Following the ADB Operations Evaluation Division report (2000) on the Kathmandu Urban Development Project: \nthe post-project evaluation revealed that LP often suffers serious implementation delays but can become efficient \nwhen the preparation of new plots is combined with providing basic infrastructure (road and drainage, water supply, \nsanitation,  and  electricity).  Showing  people  the  value-addition  gained  through  donating  their  plots,  and  the \nincreased value of remaining plot they own, considerably boosts support for LP.  \n28 This will be required in the quarterly progress report to be submitted to ADB by the PMU.  ", " 19\ncompliance with the Resettlement Framework for Land Pooling Related-Works of \nComponent A and prior approval of ADB. \n(iv)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  design,  construction,  operation,  and \nimplementation of the Project is carried out in compliance with the Government\u2019s \nenvironmental laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002); and in \naccordance  with  the  initial  environmental  examination  and  environmental \nmanagement plans agreed upon between the Government and ADB; and any \nadverse  environmental  impacts  arising  from  the  construction,  operation,  and \nimplementation  of  the  Project  will  be  minimized  by  implementing  the \nenvironmental  mitigation  and  management  measures,  and  other \nrecommendations specified in the initial environmental examination. \n(v)  The Government will ensure that the Project will not adversely affect vulnerable \ngroups, such as indigenous peoples. In the event of their involvement in any of \nthe project subcomponents, the Government will ensure that the Project will \ncomply with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). \n(vi)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  civil  works  contractors  comply  with  all \napplicable  labor,  health,  and  safety  laws  and  regulations  of  Bhutan  and,  in \nparticular,  (a)  do  not  employ  child  labor  for  construction  and  maintenance \nactivities, (b) provide appropriate facilities (latrines, etc.) for workers and their \nfamilies at construction campsites, and (c) undertake information and awareness \ncampaigns for construction workers on sexually transmitted diseases, HIV/AIDS, \nand  human  trafficking.  The  Government  will  require  contractors  not  to \ndifferentiate  wages  between  men  and  women  for  work  of  equal  value.  The \nGovernment  will  ensure  that  specific  clauses  will  be  included  in  bidding \ndocuments to ensure adherence to these provisions, and that compliance will be \nstrictly monitored during project implementation. \n(vii)  The Government will ensure that the annual recurrent budget allocation currently \nprovided by the central Government to Thimphu, Phuentsholing, and Dagana \nshall be maintained. The Government will disburse the funds to municipalities in \na timely manner.  \n(viii)  The Government will ensure that TCC and PCC will have developed long-term \noperation and maintenance procedures and have sustainable funds to operate \nand maintain the assets upgraded or constructed under this Project.   \n(ix)  The Government will endeavor that the technical capacity in each of TCC, PCC, \nand Dagana Dzongkhag is maintained.  \n(x)  The Government will ensure that water and wastewater tariffs in Thimphu will be \nincreased by at least 6% per annum until 2012. \n(xi)  The Government will ensure that household water connections will be metered \nand  appropriate  water  tariffs  will  be  introduced  at  Dagana  Dzongkhag \nimmediately upon completion of the water supply component under the Project. \n(xii)  The water billing and accounting software, prepared under the Danida-supported \nurban  sector  program  support  (USPS),  will  be  installed  at  TCC,  and  an \nappropriate number of staff (at least two) will be fully trained to operate the new \nsoftware. \n(xiii)  The Government will ensure that the area required for future upgrading of the \nexisting WWTP in Babesa is available and will be acquired in accordance with \nADB\u2019s resettlement and other relevant safeguard policies and guidelines. \n(xiv)  The Government will ensure that an appropriate site for the solid waste sorting \nand  recycling  center  is  identified,  and  that  the  site  complies  with  ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental and social safeguard policies. \n ", " 2 0                        \n(xv)  The Government will ensure that, within 3 months of loan effectiveness, it will \nhave constituted the PSC, set up a PMU under the authority of MoWHS, and \ncompleted the selection process for setting up PIUs in each of the three areas \nand sent to ADB the list of selected members. \n \nB.  Condition for Loan Effectiveness  \n \n62.  The following will be a condition to loan effectiveness: The Office of Legal Affairs will \nhave provided a legal opinion, acceptable to ADB, on the legal validity of the proposed land \npooling scheme. \n \nC.  Condition for Disbursement  \n \n63.  The following will be a condition for loan disbursement: The Government will ensure that \nthe Dagana geotechnical and slope stability study is completed and accepted by ADB prior to \ndesign and implementation of identified subcomponents under Component C of the Project. \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n64.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various \ncurrencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 16,597,000 to the Kingdom of Bhutan for the \nUrban Infrastructure Development Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with interest \ncharged at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter;

Urban Sector Overview \n \n1.  Though urbanization in Bhutan is still only a few decades old, urban areas are already \nexperiencing pressure. According to the definition followed by the Planning Commission, there \nare  28  urban  areas  in  the  country,  including  20  dzongkhag  (district)  headquarters,  two \ndangkhags (subdistricts), Phuentsholing, and five satellite towns. The total population of Bhutan, \nbased on the census carried out in 2005, is 672,425, of which the urban population is estimated \nat around 30.9%. Though the annual national population growth rate is estimated at 2.5%, \nbased on Bhutan\u2019s National Health Statistics for 2000, other sources estimate it at around 3.1%. \nHowever,  Thimphu\u2019s  annual  population  growth  rate  stands  much  higher  than  the  national \naverage and is currently estimated at around 10%. With only 10% of its land arable and the \npopulation  growing  at  such  a  speed,  Bhutan  is  seeing  an  increasing  trend  of  rural-urban \nmigration. It is thus estimated that close to half of Bhutan\u2019s population may reside in its urban \ncenters by the year 2020. The rapid inward migration is already straining the provision of basic \nurban services in the cities Thimphu and Phuentsholing. To prepare for future growth and \nensure sustainable urban development, Bhutan must invest in improvements in infrastructure, \nmunicipal  planning,  and  management  capacity,  as  well  as  institutionalize  cost-recovery \npractices for its urban services.    \n \n2.  Thimphu and Phuentsholing, the two largest cities in Bhutan, are classified as Class A \ncities,1  and  Dagana  falls  under  Class  C  category.  Thimphu  is  Bhutan\u2019s  capital  and \nadministrative center, with almost half of the city\u2019s population estimated to rely directly or \nindirectly on Government wages. Due to its relatively isolated geographic location, Thimphu\u2019s \nindustrial development has been limited, and its economic activity is based mainly on retailing \ngoods and services to the population. Based on a census carried out in May 2005, Thimphu\u2019s \npopulation  is  estimated  at  around  79,000  and  to  be  growing  at  10%  annually,  while \nPhuentsholing\u2019s population is around 20,000 and growing at 3%. Since Thimphu\u2019s population is \nincreasing at more than double the national growth rate, predominantly because of rural-urban \nmigration, it is projected to reach 150,000 by 2020. Both Thimphu and Phuentsholing face the \nfull force of urban migration and urban sprawl linked to limited job opportunities in rural areas. \n \n3.  Water supply in the core areas of both Thimphu and Phuentsholing reportedly covers \naround 80% of residents. However, if the peri-urban population is taken into consideration, then \nthe Thimphu coverage is much lower, supporting the argument that, as the city attracts people \nfrom other parts of Bhutan, the expansion of the urban infrastructure is not keeping pace with \ndemand. Similarly, Dagana faces water shortages at times during the year, mostly due to \ninadequate yield from its current water source. Lack of water treatment facilities and intermittent \nflows pose a high public health risk. Solutions to the intermittent supply problem are to ensure \nproperly  designed  headworks  and  to  secure  sources  with  sufficient  yield.  With  regard  to \nsanitation, centralized wastewater collection and treatment systems were built in mid-1990s in \nThimphu and Phuentsholing, and service coverage is around 30\u201340% of the core areas in both \ncities. However, municipal sewerage system coverage needs to be extended in both Thimphu \nand  Phuentsholing,  considering  the  increasing  growth  pressures  in  these  areas  and  the \nresulting increase in urban densities, which, without management, will bring greater risks to \npublic health and the environment. Unlike in most urban areas in the region, these systems \n                                                 \n1  Cities are categorized according to two broad factors\u2014population and the urban facilities available, for which 26 \ncriteria are applied\u2014and are assigned points based on a measure of these criteria. Category A cities are those that \nsecure 36 points or more. \n ", "       Appendix 2   27 \nhave  separate  sewers,  which  eliminate  health  risks  associated  with  combined  storm  and \nwastewater drainage systems. Water tariffs are generally low, and revenue collected covers \nmostly chemical, electrical, and some repair costs. Wastewater tariffs have been introduced by \nthe municipal governments of both Thimphu and Phuentsholing and are pegged at 50% of the \nwater rates. Therefore, the foundations for some cost recovery in the water and sanitation sub-\nsector are in place. However, due to an acute shortage of skilled professionals and technicians, \nparticularly in this subsector, systems are starting to deteriorate, and unaccounted-for-water \n(UFW) in both cities is typically 25% to 30%, despite the systems\u2019 not being very old. \n  \n4.  Solid waste management in Phuentsholing functions satisfactorily. Though solid waste \ncollection functions satisfactorily in Thimphu, waste separation and disposal management need \nimmediate attention. Municipal waste is dumped in purpose-built landfill sites in the two cities, \nbut the sites are not yet up to current international standards. The present municipal landfill site \nin Thimphu is nearing its capacity, and the composting facility, constructed with support from \nDanish International Development Aid (Danida), is not yet operational. Collection of municipal \nwaste by the two city corporations is undertaken regularly, and streets are comparatively clean \nin the two cities. In Dagana, people deposit their rubbish in communal bins or vats for eventual \nburning. This is a common practice in other rural communities throughout the country.  \n \n5.  As new urban settlements develop in centers such as Thimphu, a critical need exists for \nfurther investment in roads. Though existing roads in the urban centers are in a relatively good \ncondition compared with roads in other countries in the region, there is a prominent lack of \nplanning or coordination between the roads and services organizations. This results in road \nconstruction  authorities  continually  receiving  criticism  for  the  need  to  excavate  newly \nconstructed roads to allow extension of services such as water, power, and communications. \nFurthermore, both old and new roads do not have adequate drainage, so that water ponds on \nthem and leaves deposits of mud and silt. \n \n6.  While a private housing industry has emerged, a severe shortage exists of housing \nsuitable  for  low-  and  middle-income  urban  households.  Lack  of  access  to  urban  land  for \ndevelopment is a serious problem, prompting the Government to undertake land pooling to \nfacilitate rational urban planning.  \n \nB.  Urban Sector Institutions \n \n7.  Urban development, including urban infrastructure and services, is the responsibility of \nthe Ministry of Works and Human Settlement (MoWHS). Within MoWHS, the Department of \nUrban Development and Engineering Services (DUDES) is the nodal agency with responsibility \nfor this function. DUDES consists of four divisions: (i) Urban Planning and Design Division, (ii) \nEngineering Services Division, (iii) Urban Infrastructure Division; and (iv) Rural Infrastructure \nDivision.  For  policymaking,  finance  management,  and  administrative  matters,  DUDES  is \ngoverned  by  the  Policy  Planning  Division  and  the  Administrative  and  Finance  Division  of \nMoWHS.   \n \n8.  In  Thimphu  and  Phuentsholing,  the  principal  agencies  responsible  for  urban \ndevelopment  and  services  management  are  the  respective  city  corporations,  which  are \ngoverned under the provisions of the Bhutan Municipal Act of 1999. In Dagana, responsibility for \nurban development and management lies with the Dagana Dzongkhag. The city corporations \nand dzongkhag administrations both lack the autonomy necessary for them to act in a truly \ndecentralized manner.  \n \n   ", "28       Appendix 2    \n9.  Thimphu  City  Corporation  (TCC)  was  established  in  1993,  and  its  functions  are \nreinforced in the Charter of Thimphu Municipal Corporation 2003. In Phuentsholing, however, \nalthough the Phuentsholing City Corporation (PCC) exists, its incorporation and legal standing \nunder the Bhutan Municipal Act remain pending as the Government has not yet issued the \nnecessary charter. Both TCC and PCC are directed by municipal committees consisting of \nelected and nominated members who provide guidance on policy formulation, establishment \nprocedures,  and  approval  functions.  The  two  city  corporations  have  an  established \norganizational structure, regular staff, and directly employed laborers. However, in practice, the \ntechnical capacities of neither city corporation fully suffices for undertaking the required full \nrange of planning, management, and service-provision functions. \n \n10.  The situation in Dagana is different. In line with other dzongkhags, the dzongkhag \nadministration of Dagana is headed by a dzongda (district administrator) appointed by the \nGovernment. The local administration functions under the control of the Ministry of Home and \nCultural Affairs. For urban and municipal matters, the Dagana Dzongkhag administration has its \nMunicipal  Task  Group,  which  is  essentially  an  advisory  body  for  planning  and  developing \nfacilities  in  the  towns  of  the  dzongkhag.  Significantly,  this  group  does  not  have  authority \ncomparable to that of municipal committees of city corporations.  \n \nC.  Government Policies and Plans \n \n11.  The Government is responding to the increase in urbanization in all the following policy \ndocuments. Bhutan\u2019s National Poverty Reduction Strategy is contained in three documents: \nVision 2020, the 9th 5-Year Plan, and the poverty reduction strategy. The focus of Bhutan\u2019s \ndevelopment policy, as articulated these policy documents, is to pursue the twin goals of growth \nand poverty reduction, traditionally underpinned by a highly inclusive approach to planning. This \napproach  provides  a  sound  framework  for  guiding  internal  development  efforts  as  well  as \nexternal assistance to Bhutan.  \n \n12.  Various Government poverty surveys reveal that communities that are closer to roads \nare better off in terms of economic and social well-being than those farther away. Improving \naccess through infrastructure expansion is a key strategy for reducing poverty, enhancing the \ncoverage and quality of social services and increasing economic opportunities. Starting from a \nvirtual  absence  of  economic  infrastructure  and  social  services  in  the  early  1960s,  steady \nprogress has been registered in delivering basic services, the result of which is most clearly \nreflected in steady progress to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. Between 1970 and \n2000, the infant mortality rate halved, primary education enrollment rates increased fivefold, and \nlife expectancy doubled.   \n \nD.  ADB\u2019s Sector Strategies \n \n13.  Asian Development Bank (ADB) began lending operations in Bhutan in 1983. As of \nMarch 2005, ADB had funded 19 projects with a cumulative value of $111.2 million and 90 \ntechnical assistance activities with a cumulative value of $33.7 million.2 The overarching goal of \nADB\u2019s development assistance to Bhutan, as articulated in its country strategy and program \n(2006\u20132010) for Bhutan, is poverty reduction through economic diversification. Its development \nstrategies to achieve this goal focus mainly on helping the Government reduce poverty through \nrural electrification, road network expansion, infrastructure improvements in regional centers, \nand basic skills development. Infrastructure provision has dominated ADB\u2019s assistance portfolio \n                                                 \n2 ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program: (2006\u20132010): Bhutan. Manila (September).  \n ", "       Appendix 2   29 \nto  Bhutan.  In  1998,  the  Urban  Infrastructure  Improvement  Project  BHU-1625  (UIIP)  was \napproved, including assistance to provide urban infrastructure for Thimphu.    \n \nE.  Lessons Learned \n \n14.  An evaluation of ADB\u2019s assistance to Bhutan conducted in May 2005 found that success \nis greatest and most sustained when ADB maintains long-term sector involvement combined \nwith capacity-building programs and investment support. Based on this evaluation, as well as \nindependent evaluations of its past operations, some of the key lessons learned include the \nfollowing: \n  \n(i)  Frequent turnover of project managers adversely affects project implementation. \n(ii)  Problems with land acquisition can result in project delays. \n(iii)  A solid assessment of the existing policy framework is needed to phase and \nsequence sector reforms. \n(iv)  Inadequate  financial  resources  for  road  operation  and  maintenance  have \nresulted in infrastructure deterioration and deferred maintenance. \n(v)  Close cooperation among technical personnel involved in previous projects and \ninternational consultants should be secured to impart lessons learned. \n(vi)  Capacity building of key implementation staff should be provided prior to project \ncommencement  or  in  its  early  phases  to  avoid  unnecessary  implementation \ndelays.  \n \n15.  Most recent ADB assistance to the urban sector was through the UIIP approved in 1998. \nLessons learned from this and other urban sector projects show that lines of communication, \nsupervisory  roles,  and  formal  contract-monitoring  roles  linking  contractors  and  the  city \ncorporations need to be carefully designed and realigned. For example, contracts for physical \nworks under the UIIP and most other past projects were signed with the Government, while the \nproject management unit acted as their representative and the works were supervised by TCC. \nThis arrangement created difficulties in that the contractors communicated with and complained \nto the project management unit, and so did not deal with the supervising staff. Field inspections \nhave subsequently also raised doubts about the quality of works, with serious deterioration in \nmany of project works appearing within 2\u20133 years of their completion. Poor workmanship and \ninferior materials were also evident in the works. Furthermore, it was shown that a large number \nof small contracts is very difficult to manage and control. \n \n16.  Key lessons learned from other urban projects funded by the World Bank and other \ndevelopment partners, such as Danida, include the following:  \n(i)  Key personnel managing the projects need to be located in the same office as \nthe project manager. \n(ii)  Compensation and resettlement issues need to be negotiated and finalized early \nin the project cycle, and sufficient funds need to be budgeted for and set aside in \nadvance for the compensation and resettlement agreements to be completed in \ntime. \n(iii)  DUDES, the lead agency for planning, is professionally dominated by engineers, \nplanners,  and  architects  and  must  be  supplemented  with  sociologists  and \nsafeguards experts, an institutional development specialist, etc., to be able to \ndeal with cross-sectoral aspects of urban development. \n(iv)  The  involvement  of  beneficiaries,  especially  during  project  identification,  is \nstrongly correlated with good outcomes.  \n   ", "30      Appendix 3        \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nA.

No \n \nContribution of the sector to reducing poverty in Bhutan: \n \nIn the 4 decades since the Government initiated a period of modernization, Bhutanese indicators of welfare and quality \nof life have shown significant improvement, especially in the health, education, infrastructure, and transport sectors. \nHowever, the rapid growth of the urban areas has significant impacts on the urban population, which in the two largest \ncities in Bhutan, Thimphu and Phuentsholing, is rapidly growing as urban migration increases. Accompanying urban \nproblems are shortages in housing, unplanned development, and improper infrastructure and services. The most \ncrucial urban infrastructure and services lacking in Bhutan are roads, drainage, and adequate solid waste and sewage \ndisposal systems. The fast population growth is also placing pressure on employment. While the national rate of \nunemployment is within 2\u20133%, the urban unemployment rate is 4.1%, with urban unemployment among those aged \n15\u201319 as high as 10.9%. \n \nAgainst  this  background,  while  urban  poverty  is  still  considerably  low  (4.5%  in  Thimphu  and  Phuentsholing), \npopulation pressure and rising unemployment, coupled with a lack of urban infrastructure and services, can be \nexpected to worsen income and non-income poverty. The Project will contribute to improved health and general living \nstandards  for  local  populations  in  Thimphu,  Phuentsholing,  and  Dagana,  which  will  help  achieve  Millennium \nDevelopment  Goals,  provide  sustainable  and  reliable  urban  services  through  more  effective  city  corporation \nmanagement, and improve economic and social conditions in the three towns thanks to investments in roads, \ndrainage, water supply, sanitation, solid waste management, and other community facilities.  \n \nThe Project will provide improved water supply and sanitation facilities and associated health services to about 19,000 \npeople in poor areas selected for their low coverage and high incidence of diarrhea and other sanitation-related \nillness. An estimated 55,000 people will directly benefit from the urban infrastructure subcomponents. The Project will \nalso strengthen the capacity and capability of staff in two city corporations, making them better able to upgrade \ninfrastructure in more coherently strategic manner, plan budgets for continued maintenance and repair needs, and so \nreduce the frequency of unwarranted breakdowns. In addition, predominantly local private contractors and their \nworkers and suppliers will benefit from the flow of contracts for civil works and equipment over the project period. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: Targeted Intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nSecondary sources show that 27% of Bhutanese households live below the upper lower poverty line, and 18% live \nbelow the lower poverty line.1 Overall, the incidence of poverty is higher in rural areas, where households continue to \nrely on subsistence agriculture without adequate access to enough land, transport, or community infrastructure. The \nincidence of poverty is higher among households practicing subsistence agriculture and those headed by agricultural \nlaborers. The urban population has lower levels of poverty, with slightly more poverty in smaller towns.  \n \nIn Thimphu and Phuentsholing 4.5% of households are poor. Food poverty affects 1.7% of households. The poverty \nassessment and analysis conducted in 2000 reveals that Thimphu, Phuentsholing, and Dagana are among the least \nvulnerable dzongkhags. Food insecurity is mainly seasonal, with Dagana the most vulnerable among the three due to \nits remoteness, bad roads, and insufficient communication facilities. \n \n                                                 \n1 The lower poverty line (Nu612.1 per capita per month) represents the income required to satisfy basic nutrition needs \nbased on a minimum daily food energy requirement of 2,124 calories per person per day, with a minimum allowance \nfor basic non-food goods. The upper poverty line, set at Nu748.1 per capita per month, allows greater allowance for \nnon-food goods but maintains food expenditures equal to the food poverty line (Nu458.0 per capita per month). \n ", "            Appendix 3  31\n \n \nThe service sector is the main source of income in Thimphu (47%) and Phuentsholing (65%), while in Dagana most \n(76%) are engaged in business. Also important in Thimphu are business (33%) and farming (16%). In Phuentsholing, \nbusiness activities comprise the second most important sector, engaging 35%. Businesses are mostly in trading, \nfollowed by service-related enterprises like barber shops, salons, and restaurants. Dagana\u2019s service sector has 33% \nworking in government jobs with dzongkhag power, roads, postal, police, and other departments. \n     \nIn the three project areas, the socioeconomic survey conducted by consultants during project preparation did not show \nany head of household who was unemployed. The socio-economic survey was conducted under the Bhutan Urban \nInfrastructure Development project preparatory technical assistance (TA BHU-4533 approved in December 2004). \nPrimary data revealed that, in both the Thimphu and Phuentsholing project areas, most households are middle \nincome, earning between Nu5,001 to Nu10,000 per month, and in the service sector. Even though abject poverty was \nnot found in the project areas, 12% in Thimphu and 7% in Phuentsholing earned between Nu2,000 and Nu3,000 per \nmonth. The socioeconomic survey reported average monthly household incomes of Nu2,874 in Thimphu, Nu3,441 in \nPhuentsholing, and Nu4,641 in Dagana. \n \nDeficiencies in access to basic needs, particularly drinking water, was noted in the project areas. The socioeconomic \nsurvey shows that overall consumption of water is approximately 28\u201333 liters per capita per day in the three project \nareas. Low pressure, insufficient quantity, irregular supply, and murky water are some of the complaints reported by \nrespondents in the project areas. Forty-two percent of households in Thimphu and  64% in Phuentsholing have water \nsupplied for only 1\u20132 hours per day, while 32% in Thimphu and 33% in Phuentsholing have water for 2\u20133 hours. In \nDagana, water is supplied in the central area continuously, and limited community stand posts exist. Waterborne \ndiseases, particularly diarrhea, jaundice and typhoid, were noted in all three project areas, exacerbated by poor or \nnon-existent sewage and solid waste treatment. \n \n \nC.           Participation Process \n \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nStakeholder consultations were undertaken during project preparation. Stakeholders consulted include project area \nresidents,  anticipated  project  beneficiaries  and  affected  peoples,  and  community  leaders  such  as  local  area \nrepresentatives and city committee members; the national Government (the Department of Urban Development and \nEngineering Services of the Ministry of Works and Human Settlement, Ministry of Trade and Industry, National \nEnvironment  Commission,  and  Department  of  Aid  and  Debt  Management  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance;  local \ngovernments (Thimphu City Corporation, Phuentsholing City Corporation, and Dagana District administration); donors \nin the sector (Danish International Development Aid [Danida] and World Bank); and the Office of Legal Affairs. \n \nSocioeconomic surveys and consultations resulted in a ranking of community needs. In the project areas, roads, city \nbeautification, drainage, sewerage, and water supply were ranked as priorities. All issues and suggestions raised \nduring stakeholder consultations have been considered during project design.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nParticipation is vital to the Project, particularly where land pooling will be used. The resettlement plan and resettlement \nframework  (Supplementary  Appendix  A  and  Appendix  11)  detail  arrangements  for  consultation,  information \ndissemination, disclosure, and grievance redress, for which the participation of anticipated project beneficiaries and \naffected persons is key.  \n \nD.  Gender Development \n \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThe Project will have no negative gender impacts. The significant environmental and public health benefits from the \nProject will accrue to both women and men. The social analysis conducted during project preparation shows that there \nis overall gender equality, with women accorded equal or higher status, particularly regarding property inheritance, \nmanaging domestic finances, business, and household decisions (with women often heading households). The \nProject\u2019s water supply component will specifically benefit women because of their higher involvement in household \nand agricultural activities compared with men. \n   ", "32      Appendix 3        \nHas an output been prepared?

Introduction and Description of the Project \n \n1.  The  Urban  Infrastructure  Development  Project  (the  Project)  will  improve  urban \ninfrastructure, planning, and management; enhance urban livelihoods; and enhance capacity for \nadministering urban infrastructure supply and maintenance works through four components. \nThe main benefits of the Project will be (i) improved public health and living standards in \nThimphu, Phuentsholing, and Dagana; (ii) sustainable and reliable urban services through more \neffective  management;  and  (iii)  improved  economic  and  social  conditions  arising  from \ninvestments in roads, drainage, water supply, sanitation, solid waste management, and other \ncommunity facilities. An initial environmental examination (IEE) for the Project was prepared \n(Supplementary Appendix D). The salient points from the IEE are summarized below. \n \nB.  Description of the Project Environment \n \n2.  The topographical features of the country are the High Himalayas in the northern region \nwith many peaks and plateaus, ranges and deep valleys running north-south in the central \nregion, and foothills in the south of the country. The country is divided into two broad geological \nzones, the Lesser Himalayan belt along the southern and southeastern border and the Tethyan \nbelt in remaining parts. The climate is wet and hot in the south, dry and cold in the north, dry \nand warm in the inner valleys, moist and cool on the north-south ranges, and alpine to arctic in \nthe High Himalayas.   \n \n3.  Water resources in Bhutan, fed by precipitation over the mountain and hills, consist \nprincipally of a network of mountain streams and rivers, which form four major river basins. \nGroundwater  occurs  in  porous  sediments  and  fractured  rock  deposits  around  the  country, \nfeeding seasonal or perennial springs that are an important water source in rural areas, as is \nevident from frequent springs on hillsides around the country.  \n \n4.  Bhutan has a wide variety of plants in three main eco-floristic zones: alpine, temperate, \nand sub-tropical. Bhutan is situated within a biodiversity hotspot, an area that extends in an arc \nfrom Northern Pakistan across Nepal to Bhutan and northeast India. Bhutan has nine protected \nareas, four of which are designated as national parks, four as wildlife sanctuaries, and one as a \nstrict nature reserve. Some areas are identified as biological corridors. There are no protected \nareas and biological corridors in or around project areas. \n \nC.  Forecasting Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n5.  Impacts  due  to  Location  and  Design.  In  Thimphu,  some  stream  water  from  the \nproposed source stream is currently used for irrigation and domestic drinking water. Potential \nusage conflicts will be mitigated by keeping levels of extraction well below the dry season flow \nas required by law, and a facility for monitoring stream level has been established to determine \nthese levels. Sewerage lines are to be laid in all project towns. Potential contamination of water \nin supply pipes from sewage pipes laid in the same trench will be avoided by ensuring that pipes \nare offset, laid at separate levels, and constructed with strong materials. Problems associated \nwith blockage in the sewerage system will be avoided by adequate design of the system and the \nprovision  of  secure  connections  and  watertight  manhole  covers  to  keep  storm  water  from \nentering the system. The risk of overflow from the treatment plant will be avoided by designing \nthe plant to adequate capacity, including an additional margin to enable it to withstand storms. \n \n  ", "                     Appendix 10  45\n6.  Impacts during Construction. Noise and dust are likely to be caused by the excavation \nof trenches and operation of vehicles and machinery. Mitigation during construction will be by \nmeans of limiting work times to daylight hours, providing information to the public, covering or \nwetting stockpiles during windy conditions and maintaining vehicles and machinery in good \noperable  condition.  Similarly,  fuel  spills  will  be  limited  by  good  vehicle  and  machinery \nmaintenance. \n  \n7.  Road traffic is likely to be impeded by excavation works for both service installation and \nroad improvement works. This will be mitigated by providing information to the public on the \ntiming  and  duration  of  operations  that  affect  traffic  flows  and  using  traffic  management \nmeasures such as erecting temporary signage and providing diversions.  \n \n8.  The release of silt from materials or piles of construction waste will be mitigated by using \nsilt traps or cutoff drains as necessary, promptly and properly disposing of excavated material, \nthe timely delivery of materials to work sites, and, where feasible, limiting excavation work to the \ndry season.  \n \n9.  Chemicals and fuels used in construction pose a risk at construction sites. This risk will \nbe reduced by requiring the contractor to store these items in secure facilities and to collect \nwaste from workshops and dispose of it at approved sites. Toilet facilities will be provided to \nprevent the release of raw sewage from worksites or temporary accommodation.  \n \n10.  Dust, noise, and dangers from quarrying operations will be avoided by sourcing road \nmaterials from only licensed quarries in approved locations. Air pollution from asphalt production \nwill be avoided by using the asphalt plant in Thimphu, which has been installed to international \nstandards,  and,  in  Dagana  and  Phuentsholing,  by  appropriately  siting  the  mobile  plant, \ncontrolling dust and silt release, and using an approved fuel for heating the bitumen.  \n \n11.  Safety risks to workers are not great but can occur as a result of traffic accidents, the \nhandling of hazardous materials, and the excavation of trenches. Contractors will be required to \n(i) train and brief workers on safety precautions and their responsibilities, (ii) provide protective \nclothing, (iii) ensure that plant operators and drivers are appropriately trained and licensed, (iv) \nmake adequate arrangements for emergency treatment, and (v) provide warning signs for the \npublic.  \n \n12.  The risk of damage to utilities and private property will be mitigated by detailed site \ninspections prior to the commencement of works, adequate site supervision, and the provision \nof an emergency supply of repair materials for incidents such as burst water pipes.  \n \n13.  Upgrading the wastewater treatment plant in Thimphu and the wastewater pumps in \nPhuentsholing poses the risk of released raw sewage while the work is in progress. This will be \nmitigated by careful construction planning, providing emergency standby pumps, maintaining a \ncontinual treatment stream, procedures for disinfection and containment of raw or partly treated \nsewage, and delaying new connections until rehabilitation work is complete.  \n \n14.  Impacts during Operation. Improvements to roadside and storm drains will potentially \nresult in the rapid passage of pollutants and contaminants to the river system, particularly if \nhazardous substances are carelessly discarded by the public or drains are not adequately \nmaintained. To mitigate this risk, gross pollutant traps are to be installed at drain outflows in \nThimphu,  and  simple  trapping  devices  will  be  installed  in  Dagana.  To  encourge  public \nparticipation in keeping the environment clean, a program to raise public awareness will be \n   ", "46     Appendix 10     \nincluded  in  the  Project.  Issues  of  maintenance  will  be  addressed  by  means  of  a  project  \ncomponent on operation-and-maintenance capacity building.  \n \n15.  In the catchment area for the new water supply, there is a potential risk that future \nsettlement, intensified grazing, or other land uses that may impair the watershed. This will be \nprevented  by  designating  the  area  as  a  critical  watershed  under  the  Forest  and  Nature \nConservation Act of 1995. \n \n16.  The use of chlorine for water treatment, or of any other hazardous chemicals, may \npresent risks to plant operators and the public if not properly stored, handled, and used. This \naspect will also be addressed through the component on operation-and-maintenance capacity \nbuilding.  \n \n17.  The augmentation and expansion of the water supply in Thimphu will potentially increase \nsewage  flow  in  the  town.  The  corresponding  expansion  of  the  wastewater  collection  and \ntreatment capacity will ensure that this extra volume can be adequately handled.  \n \n18.  Sludge will be produced from both the water and wastewater treatment facilities. In the \ncase of water treatment, sludge production will be low as the source water has low turbidity. \nSludge from the water treatment plant will however contain pollutants such as alum and will \nneed to be disposed of at the city landfill or other approved site. Desludging the wastewater \ntreatment plant will be more frequent, but sludge from this plant will be suitable for re-use.  \n \n19.  Pests and odors from the wastewater treatment plant in Thimphu and Dagana will be \nmitigated by the provision of an adequate buffer distance between the plant and nearby homes, \nas has been provided for by the siting of the existing plant in Thimphu.  \n \nD.  Institutional Requirements  \n \n20.  Overall  responsibility  for  environmental  management  rests  with  the  National \nEnvironment Commission (NEC), which is empowered to issue environmental clearances and \nnational standards. Responsibility for day-to-day environmental monitoring in connection with \nurban infrastructure rests with the city corporations in the case of Thimphu and Phuentsholing \nand the dzongkhag administration in the case of Dagana.1 \n  \n21.  During project implementation, a project management unit (PMU) will be established in \nthe Department of Urban Development and Engineering Services (DUDES), which will provide \ntechnical  assistance  as  well  as  project  management  support.  However,  in  line  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s decentralization policy, the agencies with principal responsibility for supervising \nproject  implementation  will  be  the  Thimphu  City  Corporation  (TCC),  Phuentsholing  City \nCorporation (PCC), and Dagana Dzongkhag administration. During implementation, these three \nagencies will each be supported by a project implementation unit (PIU).  \n \n22.  For environmental monitoring, DUDES will be responsible for ensuring that required \nmitigation is taken into account during the detailed design phase. During construction, the \n                                                 \n1  In Thimphu, management of urban infrastructure and associated environmental monitoring is the responsibility of \nthe Thimphu  City  Corporation,  which has autonomous  status under the Charter of the Thimphu Municipal \nCorporation, 2003. In Phuentsholing, the role is taken by the Phuentsholing City Corporation, which is to attain \nsimilar autonomous status in the near future but currently comes under the Department of Urban Development and \nEngineering Services (DUDES). The relevant authority in Dagana is the district (or dzongkhag) administration, \nwhich has an engineering section that receives advisory and technical support from DUDES. \n \n  ", "                     Appendix 10  47\nsupervising role will fall to the local authority agencies concerned, with the assistance of the \nPIU. In Thimphu, a full-time environment specialist will be recruited to assist with compliance \nmonitoring of project works. In Phuentsholing, where the scale of project works is smaller, \nenvironmental compliance monitoring supervision will be carried out by the PCC\u2019s environment \nwing.  In  Dagana,  where  fewer  works  will  be  carried  out,  the  dzongkhag  administration\u2019s \nengineering section will carry out compliance monitoring, with advice and assistance from the \nhead of the PIU.  \n \n23.  During the operation phase, primary data gathering will remain the responsibility of the \nthree  implementing  agencies,  with  the  NEC  taking  the  coordinating  role.  Environmental \nmonitoring\u2014and collecting information for environmental management generally\u2014is currently \nbeing  developed  according  to  a  strategy  devised  by  NEC  with  the  assistance  of  Danish \nInternational Development Aid (Danida) for an environmental information management system. \nThe  implementation  of  this  strategy  commenced  in  late  2004.  Under  the  Danida-funded \nEnvironment  and  Urban  Sector  Project  Support,  environmental  information  management \nsystems are being established in the towns of Gelephu, Damphu, Gyalphosing, Trashigang, and \nSamtse, with the intention of establishing the system in all towns in the country.  \n \nE.  Environmental Monitoring Plan \n \n24.  Under the Project, environmental monitoring will be undertaken to ensure compliance \nwith specified mitigation measures during design, construction, and operation, and to assess \nchanges, perceived or measured, in certain environmental parameters before, during, and after \nconstruction.  Changes  in  the  environment,  as  perceived  by  project  beneficiaries,  will  be \ndetermined  through  the  project  performance  monitoring  system.  Further  changes  will  be \nmeasured by means of water, leachate, and sludge monitoring at selected sites. The monitoring \nprogram will (i) ensure compliance with the environmental monitoring plan (EMP); (ii) check the \nnature and extent of environmental effects, identifying emerging problems at an early stage; (iii) \nprovide a comparison of the situation before and after the Project; and (iv) provide data that will \nbe of value in planning further urban infrastructure improvements and upgrades. The EMP and \ninstitutional arrangements have been developed following an assessment of existing capacities \nfor environmental monitoring in Bhutan.2  \n                                                 \n2  Compliance Monitoring. Compliance with required mitigation, as specified in the EMP, will be monitored during \ndesign, construction, and operation of the Project. During detailed design, the agency with responsibility to ensure \nthat mitigation measures are incorporated during detailed design is DUDES. Besides the mitigation measures \nspecified in the EMP, DUDES will be responsible for ensuring that the EMP is afforded full contractual standing in \nthe bid documents.  \nEnvironmental Monitoring in the Project Performance Monitoring System. Under this system, changes in the \nenvironment as perceived by project beneficiaries will be determined. Beneficiaries will be asked about the \nfollowing parameters relevant to the health of their urban environment. These are detailed in the IEE. \nWater, Sludge, and Leachate Monitoring. Water quality monitoring will be carried out to check for changes in key \nparameters, as an indication of the performance project infrastructure such as gross pollutant traps and the landfill \nat Thimphu, and to detect any deterioration in quality. National standards for water are published in relation to \nindustrial discharges. Relevant standards for ambient freshwater and drinking water have not yet been developed \nfor Bhutan, but recommendations in The State of the Environment: Bhutan 2001 provide useful interim standards. \nA list of required parameters and appropriate standards in given in the IEE. The frequency of water quality \nmonitoring will be quarterly during construction and biannually during operation. Monitoring may be carried out by \nthe  city  corporations,  which  may  undertake  the  required  monitoring  on  behalf  of  the  Dagana  Dzongkhag \nadministration.  \nSludge will be produced by the water treatment plant and the wastewater treatment plant. In the case of sludge \nfrom the water treatment plant, its composition is largely known from standard testing by TCC. In the case of \nsludge from the wastewater treatment plant, which is to be made available for agricultural and horticultural use, \nmonitoring of persistent toxins is necessary to establish its safety and suitability for these purposes. Monitoring for \nheavy metals is recommended for this purpose.  \n   ", "48     Appendix 10     \nF.   Public Consultation and Information Disclosure \n \n25.  Consultations  took  place  during  IEE  preparation  to  gather  the  views  of  principal \nstakeholders and experience from previous and current projects involved in urban management, \nand to determine the concerns and insights of the public in the project area regarding the \nProject.3 The issues raised by the public and residents of the three towns accord overall with the \nproject components and its commencement is keenly anticipated. There is a strong consensus \non the need for a program to raise public awareness and elicit greater community cooperation \non issues such as the management of waste. Issues relating to the current water supply and \nwaste problems were raised in almost all areas, while other issues of importance included flood \nrisks, drainage problems, road access, slope stabilization, and problems associated with poorly \nmanaged  construction  sites.  The  proposed  component  to  raise  public  awareness  received \nstrong support and a number of suggestions.  \n \n26.  Further consultation is required under the Regulation for Environmental Clearance of \nProjects  of  2002,  which  requires  the  public  disclosure  of  the  findings  of  the  completed \nenvironmental assessment.  \n \nG.  Conclusions \n \n27.  The  selection  of  project  components  focused  on  considering  the  most  severe \nenvironmental risks, alleviation of waste-accumulation problems, and use of appropriate and \nreadily adopted technology. The Project will not generate any significant negative environmental \nimpacts. Potential negative environmental impacts, mostly associated with construction, are \ntemporary  and  localized.  The  IEE  contains  (i)  environmental  management  plans  for \nimplementing  mitigation  measures  and  (ii)  an  environmental  monitoring  plan  identifying \nmonitoring  parameters  and  responsible  agencies  to  ensure  that  mitigation  measures  are \nproperly undertaken and potential negative environmental impacts are addressed. The IEE \nconcludes that no further assessment on environmental impacts is required beyond issues to be \nreviewed during detailed design. \n                                                 \nIn the case of leachate, the presence or not of heavy metals must be determined to confirm that leachate can \nsafely be treated in the wastewater treatment plant. In addition, biological oxygen demand and chemical oxygen \ndemand should be monitored and results recorded to gauge the overall level of pollutants entering the landfill. \nMonitoring the efficacy of containing and controlling leachate flows will be apparent from water quality monitoring.  \n    Heavy metal testing involves the use of sophisticated spectroscopy techniques, which are not currently available in \nBhutan. Sampling can however be arranged in laboratories in the region. On detection of traces of heavy metals, \nrisks and corrective action will be identified on a case-by-case basis. Elements to be tested are mercury, cadmium, \narsenic lead, zinc, and copper. \n3  Meetings with members of the public and community representatives took place with groups of individuals following \na basic agenda that presented a summary of the proposed works under the Project and of project objectives and \nlikely  positive  and  negative  environmental  impacts,  including  construction  phase  and  operational  impacts. \nAttendees of the meeting were informed of effects such as nuisance in the form of noise, dust, and possible traffic \nimpedance during construction. Feedback was sought in respect of any areas of concern that the public may have \nand their suggested means of implementation. Finally, attendees and interviewees were asked about their general \nlevel of acceptance, or otherwise, of the Project. \n  ", "           Appendix 11  49\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \nFOR LAND POOLING-RELATED WORKS OF COMPONENT A (THIMPHU) \n \nA.  Background \n \n1.  The Urban Infrastructure Development Project (the Project) Component A comprises two \nparts: (i) city-level works (water supply, upgrading the existing wastewater treatment plant, and \nsolid  waste  management)  and  (ii)  roads  and  drainage,  and  water  supply  and  sewerage \nconnection in four extended areas of southern Thimphu. To deliver part (ii) the Thimphu City \nCorporation  (TCC)  has  studied  various  urban  development  methods.  Based  on  extensive \ndiscussions and consultations with local residents, TCC\u2019s evaluation shows that land pooling \n(LP)  is  the  most  suited  option  given  plot  configurations,  topographical  conditions,  and \nenvisioned local area plan (LAP) development. LP is a technique for carrying out the unified \nservicing and subdivision of separate landholdings for planned urban development. It is also \nknown as urban land consolidation, land readjustment, land replotting, and land redistribution in \nvarious countries because it involves these processes.1  \n \nB.  Land Pooling Process in Thimphu \n \n2.  LP will be undertaken in Babesa, Changbangdu, Lungtenphu, and Simtokha. The total \narea required for establishing urban infrastructure facilities (roads, drainage, water supply, and \nsewerage connections), public amenities, and green areas is 99 hectares (ha). Consultations \nwere key in developing LAPs and the LP process. The key issues raised during consultations \nwere  addressed  in  the  following  manner:  LP  will  (i)  exclude  traditional  villages2  and  keep \nneighbors together to the extent possible, (ii) ensure no impacts on residential and commercial \nstructures (impacts on other structures such as boundary walls and other assets such as trees \nwill be compensated at replacement cost), (iii) not allocate reserve plots from the local area to \nfinance  LP,  (iv)  include  government  land  to  reduce  the  contribution  required  from  each \nlandowner, and (v) minimize shifts in the land plot owned but where required due to the plot \nbeing rendered inefficient from the perspective of future structures, new plots will be within the \nsame local area with similar physical characteristics.  \n \n1.  Planning Process \n \n3.  Documentation of all land ownership is first collected. Land ownership certificates are \nthen assessed against the land survey. Any discrepancies have to be resolved by agreement \nwith the landowners concerned. \n \n4.  Small Plots. Some plots exist that are smaller than the minimum permitted size for \nstructures (4,000 square feet, or 372 square meters), and some other plots will fall below the \nminimum after they have been pooled. These plots will be shifted to allow owners to use them \nfor structures. If the landowner has a larger plot nearby, the small plot will be shifted adjacent to \nthe large plot. Small plots belonging to landowners with no other plots nearby will be situated \nadjacent  to  other  smaller  plots  to  give  landowners  the  opportunity  to  build  structures  by \namalgamating with other small plots. Prior to LP, all plots are classified as wetlands, so that \nlandowners are not allowed to build any structure regardless of plot size. With LP, landowners, \n                                                 \n1  It is widely used in Japan; South Korea; and Taipei, China and in some cities in Australia and Canada. A somewhat \nsimilar technique known as plot reconstitution is used in some cities in India. LP has also been applied in an ADB-\nfunded project in Nepal. \n2  A traditional village is an enclosed area with traditional structures (houses, warehouses, and animal sheds) that \nhas historical value for conservation identified in the LAP. \n ", "50 \nAppendix 11 \nincluding  small-plot  owners  that  opt  to  amalgamate  their  holdings,  will  be  able  to  build \nresidential and commercial structures on their plots. The shifted small plots will be within the \nsame local area have similar physical characteristics. The requirements for shifting to new plots \nare discussed in the resettlement framework\u2019s principles. \n \n5.  Contribution Ratios. The contribution ratio from different landowners will be similar to \nthe extent possible. Based on evaluations by TCC, the contributions required to optimize LP \naverages 29% and will not exceed 30%. The contribution ratio may vary within the site to reflect \nthe proportion of land that a landowner may have already contributed to create existing access \nroads.  \n \n6.  Moratoriums. Official approval will be sought for LP when the project implementation \nunit (PIU) is adequately established, staffed, and equipped. The PIU should be close to the site \n(or alternatively have a temporary branch located at the site) so that affected persons (AP) can \nvisit  it and consult easily. When LP is formally endorsed, a moratorium on land transfers and \ncultivation will be declared. Public notices will be displayed on the site and in mass media to \nannounce the start of the LP process. \n \n2.  Legal Process \n \n7.  A voluntary contractual framework forms the basis for LP. Landowners volunteer to \ncontribute a portion of their land after considering other options for urban land development and \nprovide their written consent/agreement after free, prior, and informed consultations. The LP \nprocess is then approved and implemented by TCC. \n \n8.  Where there is no land ownership certificate, if local information can substantiate claims, \nland will be registered and a temporary certificate issued, prior to a permanent certificate after \npooling. Only land properly titled and free of encroachment or disputes will be included in LP. LP \nwill include clear building by-laws comprising regulations on plot development including plot \ncoverage, maximum height, set back and side margins, architectural appearance, wastewater \ndisposal,  fire  protection,  etc.  It  will  also  include  planning  by-laws  comprising  regulations \ngoverning the land uses and activities that may take place on the site, as determined by the \npredominant land-use zones. These by-laws will be established and agreed with landowners \nand come into force when layout plans are formally approved and the moratorium lifted. \n \nC.  Issues in the Four Thimphu Extended Areas Land Pooling Process \n \n9.  Extent of LP Area and Landowners Affected. The total area required for establishing \nurban infrastructure facilities (roads, drainage, water supply, and sewerage connections), public \namenities, and green areas is 99 ha. Of this area, 53.7 ha, or 54.2%, will be from contributions \nof 898 landowners;3 45.3 ha, or 45.8%, will be the Government\u2019s contribution. The average \ncontribution is 29% from affected plots. The maximum contribution is 30%.  \n \n10.  Agreement of Landowners. Agreement from 100% of landowners on a zonal basis is \nrequired for ADB financing. Written consents/agreements have been made for contributing to LP \nbetween  the  TCC  and  landowners  since  12  March  2003.  Consistent  with  ADB  safeguard \npolicies, the Office of Legal Affairs (OLA) was identified in 2005 as the legal authority to verify \n                                                 \n3  A socioeconomic profile of landowners is in the resettlement plan. \n  ", "           Appendix 11  51\nthe consents/agreements.4 The OLA will ensure that there is no coercion and that landowners \nunderstand that they have the right to refuse to participate in LP.5 The OLA will provide quarterly \nreports to ADB on the consent/agreements verified. Where 100% consent/agreement is not \nobtained, TCC will redefine the zone to exclude the plots of landowners who do not consent. If \nrezoning is not feasible, ADB will not finance urban development through LP in that zone.  \n \n11.  At the stage of redistributing resized plots to landowners, another agreement is executed \nthat  identifies  the  extent  of  land  contributed  and  contains  a  post-LP  lot  plan.  The  thram \n(inventory of individual land holdings owned by a single household) is not amended in the entire \nprocess. However, the location of the plot attached to the thram is amended, and TCC issues \nan updated ownership certificate to the landowners.  \n \n12.  Minimizing Impacts on Landowners. Impacts on landowners are minimized through (i) \nlimiting  the  contribution  required  and  (ii)  minimizing  impacts  on  living  standards.  To  limit \ncontributions required, (i) LP contributions will be kept to similar percentages to the extent \npossible and will not exceed 30% and (ii) the Government, to the extent possible, will include its \nland to reduce LP contributions. To minimize impacts on living standards, LP will exclude \ntraditional villages and land with residential and commercial structures, and LP will minimize \nshifts in land plot. Inefficient building plots of less than 4,000 square feet will be considered for \nshifting. When shifting the location of plots, the reallocated plot will be within the same zone. \n \n13.  Benefits to Landowners. Landowners contributing to LP will directly benefit from roads, \ndrainage, and water supply and sewerage connections. An economic analysis for the Project \nestimates that, for a typical landowner who owns 1.9 ha and contributes 29% of his land, the net \neconomic benefit from LP will be Nu478,000 per person, which is 15 times the economic value \nof the land without LP. During consultation, landowners will be informed by the Government of \nthe Project\u2019s implementation schedule and the expected timeframe for delivering benefits. \n \n14.  Vulnerable Affected People. During project preparation, three categories of affected \npeople were identified as requiring compensation and assistance. A sample survey showed that \nLP  will  have  impacts  on  vulnerable  landowning  households  and  such  non-titled  APs \n(leaseholders/tenants and agricultural workers/employees). While the sample survey does not \nreflect  single  parent  female-headed,  disabled-headed,  or  indigenous  peoples-headed \nhouseholds, there are an estimated 54 landowning households with reported incomes below the \npoverty  line.  The  survey  also  indicates  potential  impacts  on  an  estimated  497  seasonal \nagricultural workers and 173 leaseholders. A resettlement plan has been prepared to address \nresettlement impacts for vulnerable APs (Supplementary Appendix F). The entitlement matrix is \nshown in Table A11.1.  \n \n15.  While the survey shows that the average seasonal worker is employed for 9 or 10 days \nper year, and that impacts on seasonal workers are therefore not anticipated to be significant, a \nsocioeconomic  survey  on  agricultural  workers/employees  and  leaseholders/tenants  will  be \nundertaken during the preparation of an updated resettlement plan for Component A at the \ndetailed  design  stage.  A  socioeconomic  survey  of  landowners  and  an  assessment  of \nvulnerabilities will also be conducted as part of updating the resettlement plan. The number of \n                                                 \n4 The OLA, formed in 1998, is the legal authority that advises various government agencies on legal matters. Under \nOLA\u2019s legal services drafting division, a lawyer has been assigned to witness and verify voluntary donations from \nlandowners. \n5  A further third party will be identified and included as witness on the side of the landowner based on the legal \nopinion by OLA. \n \n ", "52 \nAppendix 11 \naffected people will be confirmed through the socioeconomic surveys. In addition to vulnerable \nhouseholds identified in the resettlement plan because they were headed by single-parent \nfemales or indigenous people, special attention will be paid to ensure sensitivity to vulnerability \nfrom (i) loss of land resulting in reduced income or source of subsistence, (ii) being close to the \npoverty threshold and thus at risk of falling below the poverty from loss of land, and (iii) other \nsources  of  vulnerabilities.  Understanding  vulnerabilities  is  required  to  ensure  that  the \nentitlements  and  assistance  provided  are  appropriate.  ADB  must  review  and  approve  the \nrevised resettlement plan prior to the award of civil works contracts, and compensation of APs is \nrequired prior to the commencement of civil works. \n \n16.  Implementation  of  LP.  The  Department  of  Urban  Development  and  Engineering \nServices (DUDES) of the Ministry of Works and Human Settlement (MoWHS) will execute the \nADB-financed Project. DUDES will establish a project management unit (PMU) located on \nDUDES  premises  and  headed  by  the  project  manager.  The  PMU\u2014with  three \nprofessional/technical  staff  and  two  support  staff,  and  supported  by  a  team  of  project \nmanagement consultants\u2014will be the key organization ensuring the execution of the Project. \nThe PMU will be responsible for planning, monitoring, and reporting on the Project. A project \nimplementation unit (PIU) will be established in Thimphu City Corporation (TCC) and have 15 \nprofessional/technical  staff  and  four  support  staff.  The  TCC  currently  has  seven \nprofessional/technical staff for the Project, and the rest of the staff requirement will be recruited. \nThe PIU will manage day-to-day operations and implement the resettlement framework. \n \n17.  A social development specialist (SDS) for Thimphu in the PMU will coordinate land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  through  the  PIU  with  support  from  the  project  management \nconsultant\u2019s resettlement specialist. Resettlement plan implementation (excluding monitoring, \nwhich will be undertaken throughout the project period) is expected to be completed within 12 \nmonths. Resettlement framework implementation and oversight of framework monitoring will be \ndirectly undertaken by the SDS at the PMU in coordination with the sociologists at the PIU. \nExternal monitoring and evaluation will be undertaken by the independent monitor engaged for \nthe resettlement plan. Local area representatives6 or city committee members who act as liaison \nbetween APs and TCC will first hear grievances. Institutional roles and responsibilities are \nfurther detailed in the resettlement plan. \n \n18.  Grievance Redress. Any grievances of landowners or non-titled affected people can \nfirst be brought to the attention of the local area representative for the LAP or the elected city \ncommittee members. Grievances not redressed within 15 days will be brought to the PIU, and \nthe PIU head will coordinate with the TCC public consultation cell for redress. Grievances not \nredressed by the PIU within 15 days will be brought to the Land Acquisition and Resettlement \nCommittee7  acting  as  a  grievance  redress  committee.  The  committee  will  meet  when  a \ngrievance is not resolved by the PIU. Members will be given notice of the meeting, meet to \ndetermine the merit of the grievance, and resolve the grievance within a month of receiving the \nnotice for the meeting. Further grievances will be referred by APs to appropriate courts of law. \nThe procedures for redressing grievances are further detailed in the resettlement plan.  \n                                                 \n6  LP will be implemented in the four local areas: Babesa, Changbangdu, Lungtenphu, and Simtokha. The number of \nlocal area representatives is based on the number of landowners in each area. Local area representatives were \nelected by landowners in public meetings conducted during public consultations prior to finalizing local area plans. \n7  The LARC will be composed of a local government representative, the head of the PIU, local area representatives, \nand AP representatives (one BPL household, one tenant/leaseholder, and one agricultural worker). \n  ", "   \nTable A11.1: Entitlement Matrix (Impacts from Land Pooling) \n \n  Type of  Entitled   Compensation Policy  Implementation Issues  Responsible Agency \nLoss/  Person \nApplication \n1  Loss of  Tenants and  1.

The PIU will carry out internal monitoring and provide monthly \nprogress  reports.  The  PMU  will  appoint  an  independent  monitor  to  undertake  external \nmonitoring. The independent agency will monitor the Project on a half-yearly basis and submit \nits reports directly and simultaneously to the PMU and  ADB. Monitoring indicators will be \ndeveloped by the project consultants to ensure that the resettlement framework principles are \nfollowed.  The  resettlement  plan  has  separate  monitoring  requirements  detailed  in \nSupplementary Appendix F.  \n \nD.  The Land Pooling Process and ADB Safeguards Policy  \n \n20.  The relevant Government and ADB policies applicable to LP are Bhutan\u2019s Land Pooling \nManual and Land Compensation Rate (1996) and ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement \n(1995)\u2014particularly  sections  on  voluntary  donation.  ADB  policy  specifies  that  required \nsafeguards include (i) full consultation with landowners and any non-titled affected people on \nsite selection; (ii) ensuring that voluntary donations do not severely affect the living standards of \naffected people and are linked directly to benefits for the affected people, with community \nsanctioned measures to replace any losses that are agreed to verbally and in writing by affected \npeople; (iii) any voluntary \u201cdonation\u201d will be confirmed verbally and in writing and verified by an \nindependent third party such as a designated nongovernment organization or legal authority; \nand  (iv)  adequate  grievance-redress  mechanisms.

Further, LP will be guided by the following principles: \n \n(i)  All APs, titled and non-titled, will be fully informed and consulted on LP sites, \ncompensation, entitlements, and resettlement assistance. \n(ii)  Lack of formal legal land title is not a bar for compensation and assistance. \n(iii)  LP contributions will be confirmed in writing and signed by the landowner, TCC, \nand verified by third parties with copies retained by all parties. \n(iv)  Agreement from 100% of landowners on a zonal basis is required for LP. \n(v)  LP contributions will be kept at similar percentages to the extent possible and will \nnot exceed 30%. \n(vi)  Landowners contributing to LP will directly benefit from roads and drainage and \nwater supply and sewerage connections.8 During consultation, landowners will be \ninformed by the Government of the Project\u2019s implementation schedule and the \nexpected timeframe for the delivery of benefits. \n(vii)  LP will not severely affect the living standards of APs and the following measures \nwill be ensured: \n(a) LP will exclude traditional villages \n(b) LP will exclude residential and commercial structures  \n(c) LP will minimize shifts in land plot owned. Only land rendered inefficient from \nthe perspective of future structures will be considered for shifting. Landowner \nagreement  will  be  required  prior  to  shifting  the  location  of  plots,  and  the \nreallocated plot will be within the same zone. \n(viii)  The Government will not allocate reserve plots from the local area to finance LP. \n(ix)  The Government, to the extent possible, will include Government land to reduce \nLP contributions. \n(x)  All non-titled APs whose income or livelihood is affected is entitled to receive \nassistance to restore income and livelihood to pre-project standards, and all \nvulnerable APs are entitled to additional assistance.  \n(xi)  An adequate grievance redress mechanism will be in place to provide APs with \nrecourse regarding the non-delivery of benefits. \n \n ", "56        Appendix 12 \nDRAFT SUMMARY SHORT RESETTLEMENT PLAN FOR COMPONENT B \n(PHUENTSHOLING) \n \nA.  Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement  \n1.  A short resettlement plan has been prepared for Component B: Urban Infrastructure for \nPhuentsholing  (Supplementary  Appendix  G).  The  Project  minimizes  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement. The selection criteria for subcomponents included one for resettlement impacts. \nPriority  was  given  to  rehabilitation  on  the  premises  of  existing  urban  infrastructure  and \nconstructing new facilities on Government land. Resettlement impacts will further be minimized \nthrough careful siting and alignment during detailed design. No land acquisition is required for \nComponent  B.  The  Component  will  have  impacts  on  one  commercial  and  four  residential \nstructures owned by the Government, and on a Government plot leased for use as a scrap yard. \nNew residential quarters will be provided to the four affected households, who are employees of \nthe Royal Bhutan Army, and affected leaseholders and their 10 employees are entitled to \ncompensation.
