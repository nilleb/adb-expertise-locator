The \nsummary IEE was circulated to the Board on 4 August 2003.  \n   \n Project Description  To solve chronic capacity shortage of national highways (NHs) and \nupgrade key arterial corridors, in 1999 the Government launched \nthe  National  Highways  Development  Program  (NHDP).  Its  key \ncomponents  are  (i)  rehabilitation  and  widening  of  the  Golden \nQuadrilateral,  a  6,000-kilometer  (km)  highway  network,  to  be \ncompleted by the end of 2004 (first phase); and (ii) rehabilitation \nand widening of the 4,000 km North-South (N-S) and 3,300 km \nEast-West (E-W) corridors, to be completed  by the end of 2007 \n(second phase).  \n \n  In support of NHDP, since 2000 the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  has  provided  a  series  of  loans. The National Highway \nCorridor (Sector) I Project is the fourth in this series and the first \nsector loan. The Project\u2019s main element is to rehabilitate and widen \npriority sections of the E-W Corridor, with emphasis on 662 km of \nexisting highway in the states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and \nUttar Pradesh.  \n \nRationale  A program of this magnitude requires broad-based policy reforms, \nranging  from  institutional  capacity  building  for  financial \nmanagement to creation of an enabling environment for private \nsector  participation  (PSP).  ADB  has  adopted  a  programmatic \napproach  to  advance  these  reforms  in  a  progressive  and \nevolutionary manner through a multiyear lending program. ADB, \nthrough the programmatic approach, will assist the Government in \nits efforts to (i) strengthen project development and implementation \ncapability  of  National  Highways  Authority  of  India  (NHAI);  (ii) \nenhance PSP in highway development; (iii) boost sources of funds \nfor NHDP development; (iv) strengthen operation and maintenance \n(O&M) functions of NHAI; and (v) through these actions, enhance \nNHAI\u2019s professional management capability and financial viability.  \n \nA key instrument to facilitate reaching these goals is the trigger \npoint, which requires satisfactory implementation of the agreed-on \nmilestone action before project processing starts. While the trigger \npoint for last year\u2019s project was the progress of PSP, for this year\u2019s \nproject  it  was  to  secure  adequate  funds  to  complete  phase  2        \nof NHDP.   Based on ADB\u2019s 2002 recommendation to increase  the  \n \n ", "iv   \n  cess by 40%, the Government increased it by 50%  effective 28 \nFebruary  2003,  triggering  the  initiation  of  this  year\u2019s  project \nprocessing.  \n \nObjectives and Scope  The  objective  of  ADB\u2019s  programmatic  approach  is  to  help  the \nGovernment strengthen a policy and institutional framework for the \nefficient  delivery  of  highway  development  and  O&M  services \nthrough policy and institutional reforms of current systems.  \n \nUnder this overall framework, this year\u2019s Project focuses on the E-\nW Corridor, using the sector loan modality, to achieve the following \nobjectives:  \n \n(i)  Upgrade the key national arterial corridors connecting the \neastern and western ends of the country to help reduce \nregional disparities. \n(ii)  Facilitate  PSP  in  highway  development  by  providing \nadvisory services to process the PSP component. \n(iii)  Help the Government to prevent further spread of HIV/AIDs \nand raise public awareness of the risks of trafficking in \nwomen and children. \n(iv)  Enhance road safety by introducing a \u201csafety zone\u201d concept \nfor a pilot section in the E-W Corridor. \n   \nCost Estimates  The  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $760  million  equivalent, \nincluding  allowances  for  interest  during  construction.  Foreign \nexchange costs are estimated at $454 million, representing 60% of \nthe total cost, while the local currency costs are estimated at $306 \nmillion equivalent, representing 40%. \n   \nFinancing Plan  It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $400 million from its \nordinary capital resources to help finance the Project, while the \nGovernment will provide the foreign currency cost of $34 million to \ncover the front-end fee and interest during construction, as well as \nlocal currency cost of $258 million equivalent. \n       \n    ($ million) \n  Foreign  Local  Total   \nSource  Exchange  Currency  Cost  Percentage \nAsian Development   381    19   400    53 \n  Bank \nGovernment    34    258   292    38 \nPrivate Sector    40    29    69    9 \n   Total    454    306   760    100 \n  Source:  ADB mission and NHAI. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $400 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will     \nbe provided under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility. The loan \nwill have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an \ninterest rate determined in accordance with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  \nlending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front- \n   ", "     v \n  end fee of 0.50%, and such other  terms  and conditions set forth \nin the draft  Loan and  Project Agreements. The Government will \ncover  the  cost  of  $292  million  equivalent  in  foreign  and  local \ncurrency cost.  \n \nAllocation and  The Government will make the loan proceeds available promptly to \nRelending Terms  NHAI. The Government\u2019s policy of assistance to NHAI for the E-W \nCorridor is a loan-grant ratio of 20:80. In June 2003, the Public \nInvestment Board issued blanket approval of the entire E-W and N-\nS corridors. The Government will bear the foreign exchange risk on \nthe loan. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 December 2007 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2007 \nCompletion Date   \n \nExecuting Agency  NHAI \n \nImplementation  The Project will be implemented by two project implementation \nArrangements  units (PIUs) to be established by NHAI along the priority highways, \nand such other PIUs as required for non-core subprojects. \n   \nProcurement  Civil works will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor Procurement, following international competitive bidding (ICB). \nProcurement of civil works will be carried out among prequalified \nbidders. ICB will be used to procure equipment of an estimated \nvalue  of  $500,000, international shopping for contracts with an \nestimated  value  of  $100,000\u2013$500,000,  and  direct  purchase \narrangement for contracts of less than $100,000.  \n   \nConsulting Services  Consulting services will be required for (i) construction supervision \nfor the project roads (except for the PSP component), (ii) provision \nof a financial adviser\u2019s services for the PSP component, and (iii) \ndesign  of  the  road  \u201csafety  zone\u201d  concept  and  establishing \noperational arrangements for enforcement and emergency medical \nservices along the pilot section of the safety zone. Consultants will \nbe recruited using the quality- and cost-based selection method \n(and full or simplified technical proposals, depending on the size of \nthe contracts) in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants,  and  other  arrangements  acceptable  to  ADB  for \nselecting  and  engaging  domestic  consultants.  In  addition,  an \nindividual domestic consultant would be engaged for overseeing \nthe activities of nongovernment organization who would implement \nan awareness campaign to prevent HIV/AIDs and trafficking of \nwomen and children, and to build capacity. The domestic individual \nconsultant  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  arrangements \nacceptable  to  ADB  for  selecting  and  engaging  domestic \nconsultants. \n    \n ", "vi   \nProject Benefits and  A major benefit of the Project is the sustainable economic growth \nBeneficiaries  to be attained through enhanced efficiency of economic activities. \nThe Project will enable cargo and people to move faster and wider \nat  lower  cost.  While  the  Project\u2019s  overall  impact  on  economic \ngrowth  is  difficult  to  estimate  quantitatively,  direct  economic \nbenefits were estimated conservatively based on the estimate of \nvehicle  operating  cost  savings.  The  economic  internal rate of \nreturn thus calculated was 23% for the core subproject. \n  \nAnother related project benefit is reduced disparities between fast- \nand slow-growing states. Linking the eastern and western ends of \nthe country to major manufacturing and consumption centers will \nhelp significantly integrate isolated and backward economies into \nthe mainstream economies.  \n \nThe Project will contribute to the poverty reduction by establishing \nan  integrated  road  network  consisting  of  rural  roads,  major \ndistrict/state roads, and national highways. The network will thus \nenhance long-term economic opportunities of rural communities by \n(i) enabling villagers to shift from subsistence farming to market-\noriented  agricultural  surplus  production;  and  (ii)  helping  local \npeople, particularly the youth, move out of their communities to \nwork  at  better-paid  jobs  in  manufacturing  or  trading.  Project \nconstruction, tree planting, and ensuing maintenance works will \ndirectly increase earnings of the poor, who are largely depending \non temporary employment, and thus have a short-term poverty \nreduction impact. \n \nRisks and Assumptions  A  potential  risk  is  possible  delays  in  implementation  due  to \nprolonged  land  acquisition.  The  need  for  land  acquisition  is \nrelatively limited. Existing right of ways are usually broad enough \nto accommodate service roads and drainage lines. The recent \namendment of the National Highway Act enables NHAI to acquire \nland expeditiously and predictably. \n  \nAnother potential project risk is possible delay in processing non-\ncore  subprojects  due  to  unfamiliarity  of  NHAI  with  procedural \nrequirements of ADB\u2019s sector loan. Detailed forms of summary \nsubproject appraisal report, checklists, and other reporting formats \nhave  been  provided  to  NHAI  to  facilitate  processing  of  its \nsubprojects.  To  strengthen  its  technical  capability,  NHAI  has \nestablished a technical group of experts within the project team. \nThe project preparatory technical assistance consultants will train \nthe team staff, including the experts. These actions will minimize \npossible delay due to a new lending modality. \n \n \n   \n \n   ", "", "                                   1 \nI.   PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto India for the National Highway Corridor (Sector) I Project.  \n \nII.   RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.   Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  India\u2019s economy has long suffered from the national highway (NH) system\u2019s chronic \ncapacity shortage. Of the NH network of 58,112 kilometers (km), 39% are still single lane and \n59% are two lane, while four-lane highways, a desirable standard for arterial national corridors, \naccount for only 2%. The Government\u2019s Tenth Five-Year Plan (FYP, 2003\u20132007) thus set forth \nseveral investment programs to improve the NH system by (i) widening 22,000 km of two-lane \nroads to four lanes; (ii) constructing 2,000 km of expressways; (iii) widening 22,500 km of \nsingle-lane roads to two lanes; and (iv) strengthening 19,300 km of pavement. Total investment \nrequired to implement these programs is estimated at $37 billion (Appendix 2).  \n \n3.  Because of the magnitude of investments required, the Government has placed highest \npriority on the National Highway Development Program (NHDP) to upgrade three key arterial \ncorridors in 10 years  (1998-2007): (i) Golden Quadrilateral\u20146,000 km; (ii) North-South (N-S) \nCorridor\u20144,000  km;  and  (iii)  East-West  (E-W)  Corridor\u20143,300  km.  Total  program  cost  is \nestimated at $13\u2013$15 billion, on which the Government decided to allocate the central road \nfunds on a priority basis. NHDP is expected to help contribute to the increased integration of the \ncountry by connecting the entire eastern and western and also northern and southern ends of \nthe country.  \n \n4.  Since 2000, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has supported NHDP with three loans, \nand plans to provide another two for 2003\u20132004, totaling $1.54 billion (12% of the total program \ncost). As NHDP implementation is halfway through, ADB conducted a mid-term review and \nevaluated  (i)  physical  progress  of  NHDP;  (ii)  extent  of  PSP;  (iii)  financial  viability  and \nsustainability of NHDP; and (iv) effectiveness of the institutional arrangements.  \n \n5.  Physical  delivery  of  the  program.  The  first  phase  of  NHDP  for  the  Golden \nQuadrilateral, slated for completion by the end of 2004, is well underway. To date, 24% (or \n1,408 km) has been completed, 74.5% (or 4,354 km) is currently under implementation, and \n1.5% (or 84 km) has yet to be awarded. Over the last 4.5 years, the National Highways \nAuthority of India (NHAI) has issued approximately 155 contracts for a total of 6,025 km under \nNHDP  (of  which  40  contracts  or  893  km  have  been  completed).  This  is  an  impressive \nprocurement achievement\u2014 an estimated 35 contracts on average per year or roughly 1,400 \nkm annually. However, assuming an average contract implementation period of 3 years, NHAI \nwill have to double this number of kilometers to complete the remaining 6,962 km programmed \nby the end of 2007. Doubling the pace of delivery will require NHAI to strengthen project \nmanagement capability and, wherever possible, simplify and standardize project preparation \nand processing.  \n \n6.  Private  sector  participation.  Since  1999,  NHAI  has  actively  explored  options  to \nincrease participation of the private sector in highway development. To date, eight toll-based \nbuild-operate-transfer  (BOT)  concessions,  eight  annuity-based  contracts,  and  eight  special-\npurpose  vehicles  (SPVs)  have  been  awarded,  covering  1,154  km  (19%  of  total  length \ncontracted to date), and $1.9 billion of the total project cost with PSP (of which $1.1 billion is \n ", "2 \nestimated to be the private sector contribution). By the end of FY2007/08, the private sector will \nhave contributed $1.8 million or almost 12% of total capital cost for NHDP. This level of PSP, \nhowever,  has  been  achieved  by  the  Government  provision  of  subsidies  of  16\u201349%  of \nconstruction costs1 and also by its payment of annuity of around 16% return. As projects move \nto less-trafficked segments of NHDP networks as those in the E-W and N-S corridors, the public \nsector contribution is likely to be increased significantly. This potential increase should be \nminimized by introducing a variety of credit enhancement mechanisms and innovative PSP \nschemes (Supplementary Appendix A-2 for an overview of, and lessons learned from, PSP).  \n \n7.  Financial viability and sustainability. To complete NHDP, the first- and second-\nphase programs, and others mandated to NHAI, require a total of $32.5 billion2 over FY1999\u2013\nFY2017: $15.2 billion for capital financing, and $17.3 billion for debt service ($1.6 billion for on-\nlent government loans and $15.7 billion for market borrowings). To finance these capital works \nand debt service, it is anticipated for NHAI to raise $30.7 billion over the same period: $15.7 \nbillion from cess (tax), $9.1 billion from market borrowings, $4.1 billion from external assistance, \nand $1.8 billion from PSP. The shortfall of $1.8 billion is envisaged to be financed out of NHAI \ntolls.  Toll  revenue  for  FY2005\u2013FY2017  is  estimated  to  amount  to  $6.5  billion,3  of  which \noperation and maintenance (O&M) will require $5.0 billion.4 Assuming tolls are fully indexed with \ninflation, estimated toll revenue is almost sufficient to cover government debt servicing of $1.8 \nbillion for the period estimated5 (Supplemental Appendix E-2). \n \n8.  A year ago, ADB conducted a long-term cash-flow analysis to find out whether NHAI \ncould finance investments to complete the second phase of NHDP and associated cost of debt \nservices. The analysis found that NHAI would face major cash-flow problems during FY2007-\nFY2009,  and  recommended  substantial  increase  of  cess  or  toll.6  Acting  on  this \nrecommendation, the Government increased cess by 50% effective on 28 February 2003. While \nthis  action will  substantially  resolve  anticipated  cash-flow  problems,  overall  achievability  of \nNHAI\u2019s cash-flow forecast still needs to be critically reviewed. The following are the issues:  \n \n(i)  An additional $6.7 billion has to be raised from the market (2-3 times larger than \nthe amount already raised from the market [$2.4 billion]). While the market has \nbeen receptive to NHAI offerings, they will become less attractive as liabilities of \nNHAI increase and its liquidity becomes more dependent on future borrowings. \nStrengthening  cash-flow  management  and  developing  a  more  transparent \nfinancial reporting system will be critically important (paras. 48\u201350), and will be \nsupported by ADB technical assistance (TA).7  \n(ii)  A fund of $4.1 billion must be raised from multilateral and bilateral agencies. \nNHAI is likely to receive $1.5 billion from ADB (including 2003 and 2004 loans for \nNHDP) and $1.5 billion\u2013$2.0 billion from the World Bank (including one or two \npipeline loans for 2003-2005). The Japan Bank for International Cooperation  \n                                                 \n1  A notable exception to this is the BOT project for the Delhi-Gurgaon section, which has generated to NHAI a \nnegative grant amounting to 11% of project cost.  \n2  Rupee cash-flow forecasts converted at $1 = Rs45. \n3  Rupee cash-flow forecasts assume Rs2.0 million and Rs1.0 million is collected per kilometer on the golden \nquadrilateral, and N-S and E-W corridors, respectively. NHAI toll estimates are indexed in accordance with inflation \nestimated at 4.56% per annum.  \n4  Cash-flow forecasts estimate O&M at Rs11.5 lakh/km of four-lane highway. O&M estimates are indexed in \naccordance with inflation estimated at 4.56% per annum. \n5  With no growth in traffic, Rs1.4 billion will be generated from tolls; with 2% growth in traffic, Rs2.2 billion will be \ngenerated (the latter covering the entire $1.8 billion shortfall). \n6  ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board on a Proposed Loan to India for the East-\nWest Corridor Project. Manila (Loan 1944-IND, para. 13 of the main text, and Supplemental Appendix Z).  \n7  The TA\u2019s scope of work was modified in February 2003 to include social issues and road safety. \n ", "                                   3 \n(JBIC) has not yet committed any new loans for the highway sector. The sources \nfor the additional $1.1 billion\u2013$1.6 billion have yet to be identified or confirmed. \n(iii)  $6.5 billion tolls need to be collected, which require reliable traffic forecast and \nability to collect toll revenues immediately after roads are commissioned, and \npolitical willingness to fully and annually index toll revenues with inflation. \n \n9.  Institutional aspect. Since NHDP started, NHAI has expanded significantly. In 2000, it \nhad 200 staff,8 350 in 2001,9 and 530 now.10 Although the pace of expansion is very fast, it \nmight be justifiable as investment programs are escalating rapidly and government pressure to \nspeed up NHDP is mounting. In 2000\u20132002, staff, productivity increased significantly (by 60%) \nin terms of kilometers processed. However, this pace of staff expansion is still alarming, and \nstaffing increase should be kept to a minimum.  \n \n10.  A key element to slowing down the pace of expansion is outsourcing. NHAI has been \npursuing this direction in a vigorous manner by contracting out various project development and \nimplementation  activities  to  the  private  sector,  including  design,  construction,  construction \nsupervision, and O&M. While enabling NHAI to deliver a larger number of contracts more \nefficiently, this approach outstrips NHAI\u2019s capability to monitor consultants and contractors. The \nproblem is compounded by NHAI\u2019s recruitment policy, which largely depends on deputation of \nstaff from government agencies such as Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MORTH) \nand state public works departments (PWDs). Most professional staff of NHAI (270 out of 530) \nare deputed from these agencies for 2 years, with possible extension of another 3. This staffing \npolicy has caused problems in retaining qualified professional staff, building internal engineering \nand operational capacity, and nurturing a corporate culture significantly different from ordinary \ngovernment agencies. The Project addresses monitoring capacity by strengthening the project \nteam\u2019s capacity by engaging six experienced technical experts. Staffing is being addressed \nunder the ongoing Institutional Strengthening Study financed by the World Bank.  \n  \nB.   Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n1.  ADB Strategy    \n \na.  Programmatic Approach and Policy Dialogue \n \n11.  In providing a series of loans to NHDP, ADB has adopted a programmatic approach to \nrealize medium- to long-term goals in a progressive and evolutionary manner. ADB, through the \nprogrammatic  approach,  will  assist  the  Government  in  its  efforts  to  achieve  the  mid-term \nobjectives to (i) strengthen project development/implementation capability; (ii) enhance PSP in \nhighway development; (iii) strengthen NHAI\u2019s fund mobilization capability; (iv) strengthen NHAI\u2019s \nO&M  function;  and  (v)  enhance  NHAI\u2019s  professional  management  capability  and  financial \nviability. As the midterm review indicates, significant progress has been made for the first three \ngoals.  \n \n12.  ADB has systematically pursued these goals by introducing the concept of the trigger \npoint (project processing starts only upon satisfactory implementation of agreed-on milestones). \nWhile the trigger point for last year\u2019s project was progress of PSP, for this year\u2019s project the \ntrigger point is to secure adequate funds to complete the second phase of NHDP. The trigger \n                                                 \n8  World Bank. 2002. India Transport Sector: The Challenges Ahead. Volume 2. Washington DC. \n9  ADB. 2001. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to India \nfor the Western Transport Corridor Project. Supplemental Appendix L. Manila. \n10 NHAI: A finding of the Loan Fact-Finding Mission.  \n ", "4 \npoint of this year\u2019s project was met when the Government increased cess on 28 February 2003. \nWith progress made in achieving the first three goals, policy dialogue will shift its focus to the \nremaining two goals \u2013 (i) enhancement of O&M function, and (ii) organizational realignment.  \n \n13.  Operation and Maintenance Issue. As more highways are constructed and placed in \nservice, O&M is becoming an increasingly important issue for NHAI. Newly created assets need \nto be maintained, tolls collected with minimum leakage, and rights of way (ROW) kept clear. \nGiven the government decision to convert four-laned NHs into toll roads, O&M should no longer \nbe considered a cost center but a potential profit center. NHDP could generate $200 million\u2013\n$400 million per year. The organizational arrangement, however, is not structured to capture \nthis opportunity. The possibility of establishing a separate line of business within NHAI should \nbe explored, together with development of associated accounting systems which would enable \nproper cost and revenue allocations among different lines of businesses.  \n \n14.  The concept of O&M has been significantly expanded to include asset management, and \nwill  be  further  expanded  to  include  traffic  and  ROW  management.  The  ongoing  corridor \nmanagement unit approach is one trial moving in this direction, which will be continuously \npursued  under  the  programmatic  approach.  It  should  be  fine-tuned  so  that  the  corridor \nmanagement unit approach is effectively implemented under diverse operational circumstances \nsuch as annuity-based or BOT concession schemes. During the Appraisal Mission, it was \nagreed to hold a tripartite meeting between ADB, World Bank, and the  Government to discuss \nthese  O&M-related issues in more depth and from a broader context.  \n \n15.  Another O&M-related issue is tolling, which is a major determinant of NHAI\u2019s financial \nsustainability. Once NHs have four lanes, tolls should be collected as soon as possible\u2014in any \nevent, within six months after construction is completed. Once tolling is widely accepted, the \nnext challenge will be setting tolls at the right level to cover O&M costs and debt services from \nmultilateral agencies. While this current toll policy is justifiable, in the long run they should be \ngradually increased to cover all debt services. Another element of tolls is how they are collected. \nNHAI recently set up an in-house committee to deliberate on toll collection and optimization. \nThese issues will be addressed in the tolling system study funded under ADB\u2019s Surat-Manor \nTollway Project.11 This study will be conducted as an integral part of the policy dialogue to be \nconducted between the Government and ADB. Another issue is the need to grant NHAI the right \nto retain tolls as revenue. Based on the covenant between the Government and ADB in October \n2002, NHAI initiated discussions this year with agencies to acquire this right. The Government \nagreed to finalize an arrangement so that NHAI can be able to retain tolls collected as its own \nrevenue by 31 December 2004.  \n \n16.  Organizational structure of the National Highways Authority of India. This relates to \ntwo sub-issues: a short-term one\u2014a need to realign the current organizational arrangement, \nand a long-term one\u2014a need to change corporate structure. NHAI\u2019s organizational arrangement \nevolved over the years in a rather ad hoc manner. New units were created and new project \nimplementation units (PIUs) added without a clear guide to allocate functions among various \nunits. Now that it has entered a new phase of program implementation and grown in size, NHAI \nshould evaluate how efficient the current organization is and what readjustments are necessary \nto accomplish its mission more efficiently.  \n  \n17.  In the long run, NHAI should look into the possibility of introducing alternative form of \norganization. NHAI\u2019s current business model (a government agent that receives management \n                                                 \n11 Negotiation with a consultant was delayed and is now scheduled for 15 November 2003. \n ", "                                   5 \nfees  in  return  for  construction  and  maintenance)12  is  less  valid  now  in  light  of  the  future \noperation of NHAI. The resulting financial structure (tolls collected are not NHAI\u2019s revenue, and \nhighways constructed are not NHAI\u2019s assets) has significantly constrained strategic options to \nmobilize  funds.  Once  it  is  allowed  to  retain  tolls  as  revenue  as  covenanted  in  the  Loan \nAgreement of the East-West Corridor Project, NHAI should start exploring alternative forms of \norganization (including public corporation) and compare their merits and demerits with those of \nthe present organization. Since next year\u2019s project is likely to be the last in this series of lending \nto NHDP, the issue of organization will be addressed during preparation and processing of next \nyear\u2019s project.  \n \nb.  Sector-Loan Approach \n \n18.  The midterm review indicated that subproject preparation and processing should be \nstandardized  and  project  monitoring  capability  strengthened.  To  do  so  and  to  grant  the \nGovernment\u2019s request to increase flexibility in selection of road sections to be financed by ADB, \nit was decided to apply the sector-loan modality for this year\u2019s project. Requirements for the \nsector  loan  are  (i)  existence  of  a  sector  development  plan,  (ii)  institutional  capability  to \nimplement the sector development plan, and (iii) development of policies to enable the sector to \nimprove  its  performance.  The  Fact-Finding  Mission  found  that  these  requirements  were \nsatisfactorily met (Supplemental Appendix C-4).  \n \n19.  The sector-loan approach adopted for this Project has the following features:  \n \n(i)  Priority highways will be identified to ensure minimum contiguity of project roads. \n(ii)  From  the  above  priority  highways,  a core  subproject  will  be  selected  as  an \nexemplary subproject for the appraisal of the rest of subprojects. \n(iii)  NHAI will select eligible non-core subprojects and appraise them according to \ncriteria agreed on between ADB and NHAI (Appendix 11). Appraised subprojects \nwill be sent for approval to ADB using a summary report format, with supportive \ndocuments being attached. \n \nC.   Lessons Learned \n \n20.  Since 1988, ADB has approved eight loans for the road subsector (Appendix 3) in India, \ntotaling $1.8 billion. Implementation of earlier projects approved in 1988-1993 were significantly \ndelayed due to operational and institutional shortcomings. ADB has thus (i) allowed advance \ncivil works procurement and recruitment of construction supervision consultants, ensuring award \nof contracts upon loan effectiveness; (ii) removed utilities and other encumbrances before \nconstruction starts; (iii) introduced a larger size of contract packages to attract experienced \ninternational contractors; and (iv) raised the level of authority of the engineer to ensure efficient \nand objective decision making during execution. Challenges now are system-wide operational \nissues rather than project-by-project implementation problems. The former includes the need to \nstandardize project development, to be addressed by adopting the sector-loan modality. \n \nD.   External Assistance \n \n21.  The World Bank has also provided 16 loans, amounting to about $3.5 billion, to upgrade \nnational  highways,  improve  state  highways,  and  construct  and  rehabilitate  rural  roads.  As \ncombined World Bank and ADB assistance for the road subsector is over $5 billion, providing \n                                                 \n12 The fee for construction is 1% of cost, while that for maintenance is 9%. \n ", "6 \nsuch assistance should be done in a well-coordinated manner to generate maximum synergy in \noperations,  with  minimum  duplication.  In  2001,  ADB  and  World  Bank  developed  their \ncoordinated assistance strategy for India\u2019s road subsector, which has been updated from time to \ntime to keep it relevant to the government agenda. The Government, ADB, and World Bank, \nhave been holding tripartite meetings periodically to discuss major policy and investment issues \nin  the  road  sector.  The  most  recent  meeting  was  held  in  April  2003,  with  secretary-level \nparticipation  from  the  Government.  Close  coordination  between  ADB  and  World  Bank  will \ncontinue using these mechanisms.  \n \n22.  JBIC is another major donor to the highway sector, having provided five loans amounting \nto $300 million to upgrade NH sections and construct a bridge. While JBIC has not been active \nin India\u2019s highway sector for the last few years, ADB has been in close contact with JBIC to \nexchange  information  and  explore  the  possible  areas  of  cooperation.  The  Department  for \nInternational Development of the United Kingdom is another important partner of ADB in its \noperations  in  India,  having  provided  grant  assistance  to  the  Madhya  Pradesh  State  Road \nProject and the proposed rural roads sector project.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.   Priority Highways  \n \n23.  The Project13 will finance sections of the E-W Corridor under the sector-loan modality. Of \nthese  sections,  662  km  are  priority  highways  in  Rajasthan,  Madhya  Pradesh,  and  Uttar \nPradesh. Priority highways are divided into five sections. Among them, section C was selected \nas a core subproject since it represents a typical set of project development issues, including \ntechnical, environmental, and social ones. If NHAI identifies other sections that need to be \ndeveloped more urgently, the above sections can be replaced by others, or other sections can \nbe added to the above sections, provided that the other sections (i) are part of the E-W Corridor \nand (ii) satisfy eligibility criteria of subprojects (Appendix 11).  \n \nTable 1:  Priority Highways \nSection  Priority Highways   Specific Locations  Length  State \nA  Chittorgarh-Kota (excluding Kota  NH 76 (km212\u2013km376)  164 km  RJ \nBypass) \nB  Kota- RJ/MP Border (excluding  NH 76 (km406\u2013km579)  173 km  RJ \nKota Bypass) \nC  RJ/MP Border-Jhansi (excluding  NH 76 (km579\u2013km609)  131 km  MP/UP \nJhansi Bypass)  Shvpuri Bypass (24km in length) \nNH 25 (km15\u2013km92) \nD  Jhansi-Orai (including Jhansi  Jhansi Bypass (16km in length)  124 km  UP \nBypass)  NH 25 (km104\u2013km212)  \nE  Orai-Bognipur-Barah  NH 25 (km212\u2013km255)   70 km  UP \nNH 2 (km422\u2013km449) \n      km = kilometer, MP = Madhya Pradesh, RJ = Rajasthan, UP = Uttar Pradesh. \n \nB.   Objectives \n \n24.  The objective of ADB\u2019s programmatic approach is to help the Government strengthen \nthe policy and institutional framework for efficient delivery of highway development and O&M \n                                                 \n13 The Project was prepared under ADB. 2002. National Highway Corridor (Sector). Manila (TA 4036-IND). ADB\u2019s \nprevious requirement to convert the grant amount exceeding $250,000 into a part of the subsequent loan will not \nbe applied.  \n ", "                                   7 \nservices through policy and institutional reforms to enhance transport efficiency without causing \nmajor environmental and social problems.  \n \n25.  Under this framework, the Project focuses on the E-W Corridor to achieve the following:  \n \n(i)  Upgrade key national arterial corridors connecting the eastern and western ends \nof the country to help reduce regional disparities. \n(ii)  Facilitate  PSP  in  highway  development  by  providing  necessary  advisory \nservices.  \n(iii)  Contribute to the Government\u2019s efforts to prevent spread of HIV/AIDS14 and \nincrease awareness of possible risk of trafficking in women and children by \ncollaborating with relevant state authorities concerned with health, women, and \nchildren.  \n(iv)  Enhance road safety through pilot introduction of a safety zone for a part of \nnational highway under the E-W Corridor.  \n \nC.   Components and Outputs \n \n1.  Highway Investment  \n \n26.  The component will finance the widening of stretches between Chittorgarh and Orai (592 \nkm) into four-lane roads. The core subproject, a 131 km section between the Rajasthan and \nMadhya Pradesh border and Jhansi, will cost $151.8 million, while non-core subprojects will \ncost an estimated $484.5 million, covering 461 km. ADB will finance the entire foreign exchange \nportion of the project cost, except the front-end fee and interest during construction, which will \nbe borne by the Government (Supplementary Appendix B-1), and part of local currency costs. \nOnce these sections are completed, their O&M will be contracted out to a third party.  \n \n2.  Private Sector Participation  \n \n27.  As NHAI must be encouraged to use PSP as a key modality to finance highways, ADB \nand NHAI agreed that at least 10% of project highways are to be developed under a PSP \nscheme. NHAI will identify section(s) to be developed under the PSP scheme within 3 months of \nloan effectiveness. NHAI will explore the possibility of PSP in the Orai-Balah section (70 km)\u2014\nthe eastern end of the priority highways adjoining golden quadrilateral at Barah. An agreement \nwas reached with NHAI that the PSP component(s) will meet all requirements imposed on the \nsubprojects to ensure, among other requirements, compliance with ADB\u2019s safeguard policies. \nNHAI further agreed to report to ADB in a timely manner the results of the bidding, negotiations, \nand financial closure so that, in case these are not finalized, the Government and ADB can take \nnecessary action promptly.  \n \n28.  While it will not directly finance the PSP development, ADB will help NHAI engage a \nfinancial adviser (a domestic firm costing $100,000 equivalent) (Supplementary Appendix D-4 \nfor terms of reference). Furthermore, to catalyze the inflow of commercial funds for PSP, if \nrequested by the Government and NHAI, ADB\u2019s private sector window would help the private \nconcessionaire  through  lending  or  guarantee  operations.  ADB\u2019s  private  sector  support \nmodalities will, however, be subject to a separate due-diligence exercise. \n   \n                                                 \n14 Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n ", "8 \n3.  HIV/AIDS and Anti-Trafficking  \n \n29.  This  component  is  designed  to  reduce  risks  of  spreading  HIV/AIDS  and  trafficking  \nwomen and children.  \n \n30.  HIV/AIDS subcomponent. This subcomponent will build upon the collaborative model \nto be finalized between NHAI and the National AIDS Control Organization in the form of a \nmemorandum  of  understanding.15  The  subcomponent  will  involve  contribution  of  technical \nexpertise by state AIDS control societies as well as on-the-ground operations along priority \nhighways carried out by nongovernment organizations (NGOs). This subcomponent will engage \nin the following key activities: (i) awareness raising among construction workers, (ii) public \nawareness raising and a change behavior campaign among high-risk groups, (iii) strengthening \nof referral systems for sexually transmitted diseases and HIV for early diagnosis along priority \nhighways, (iv) condom promotion and distribution; and (v) capacity building of service providers \nand decision makers.  \n \n31.  Anti-trafficking subcomponent. This subcomponent will be carried out by NGOs in \nconjunction with HIV/AIDS prevention activities. It will draw on knowledge and expertise from \nstate  departments  of  women  and  child  development  and  social  welfare,  already-operating \nNGOs, and other locally available resources. The subcomponent will engage in three main \nactivities: (i) awareness raising and a safe-migration campaign (target groups are from the \ndemand side [e.g., truck drivers/helpers] and supply side [e.g., commercial sex workers, tribal \nwomen and children, and migrant women]); (ii) channeling resources from national or state \nprograms to empower women and children to vulnerable tribal women or children; and (iii) \ncapacity building of service providers, communities, and decision makers. \n \n32.  NHAI\u2019s environment and social development unit (ESDU)16 will establish an HIV/AIDS \nprevention and anti-trafficking cell within the unit to implement this component. The cell will be \nheaded by a general manager in charge of social development issues, who will be assisted by \nthree staff consultants to be engaged later under a separate financing arrangement.17 The cell \nwill engage three locally based NGOs. The activities of these NGOs would be coordinated and \nmonitored  by  a  domestic  consultant  to  be  financed  by  ADB.  The  estimated  cost  for  the \ncomponent is about $400,000  (Supplementary Appendix B-3). \n \n4.  Road safety  \n \n33.  This component is designed to enhance road safety by introducing a safety zone to a \nselected pilot section on the E-W Corridor. The safety zone is intended to institute several road \nsafety equipment/systems in an integrated manner to maximize their impacts. It will be equipped \nwith  (i)  advanced  traffic  management  systems  to  monitor  the  road  situation  in  a  centrally \ncontrolled manner; (ii) weigh-in-motion and/or static weighing platforms to control overloading; \n(iii) speed-monitoring equipment to spot speeding vehicles; and (iv) ambulances and other relief \nequipment to provide emergency road services. To ensure the effective operation of the safety \nzone, appropriate operators and/or authorities will be mobilized to enforce traffic regulations and \nprovide emergency medical services. The component will decide what systems will work best \nfor the pilot section. The 150-200 km pilot section will be identified for the Jhansi-Lucknow \nsection, which has the highest traffic level in the E-W Corridor. NHAI\u2019s corridor management \n                                                 \n15 Development of the memorandum of understanding was facilitated by the World Bank. \n16 ESDU was established in 2000 at the headquarters to handle environmental and social development issues. It is \nheaded by a general manager.  \n17 Financed by the World Bank.  \n ", "                                   9 \nunit will be a focal point for this component and guided by an appropriate arrangement to be \nestablished within 6 months of loan effectiveness, in coordination with MORTH and relevant \nstate authorities. ADB will finance the consultancy services of $500,000 to define the safety \nzone concept and operational arrangements for enforcement and emergency medical services. \nADB  will  also  finance  the  cost  of  purchasing  equipment  and  systems  ($11.8  million) \n(Supplemental Appendix B-4). \n  \nD.   Cost Estimates  \n \n34.  The total project cost is estimated at $760 million equivalent, including allowances for \ncontingencies and interest during construction. Foreign exchange costs are estimated at $454 \nmillion, representing 60% of the total cost, while local currency costs are estimated at $306 \nmillion equivalent, representing 40%.

Financing Plan \n \n35.  The Government has requested a loan of $400 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to finance the Project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 \nyears, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-end fee of 0.50%, and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements. The Government has provided \nADB with (i) reasons for borrowing under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of \nthese terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent \ndecision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB.  \n \n36.  The Government will cover the foreign exchange cost of $34 million to cover the front-\nend fee, interest, and other charges on the loan during construction. The Government will also \ncover the local currency cost equivalent to $258 million. The construction cost of the Orai-Barah \nsection of priority highways ($67 million equivalent) or such other subproject to be identified by \n ", "10 \nNHAI to be developed under a PSP scheme will be covered by a private concessionaire. ADB \nwill fund consulting services for the PSP scheme ($100,000).

The  Government  will  make  loan  proceeds  available  to  NHAI  promptly.  The \nGovernment\u2019s policy of assistance to NHAI for the E-W and N-S corridors is a loan-grant ratio of \n20:80.  Clearance  was  obtained  on  6  June  2003  from  the  Public  Investment  Board  for \nconstruction of the E-W and N-S corridors and for the loan-grant ratio. The Government will \nbear the foreign exchange risk of the loan.  \n \nF.   Implementation Arrangements \n \n  1.  Project Management  \n \n38.  NHAI will be the Executing Agency for the Project. The Project will be implemented by \ntwo especially created PIUs, which will be in Kota (for the sections in Rajasthan and Jhansi (for \nthe  sections  in  Madhya  Pradesh  and  Uttar  Pradesh)  (Supplementary  Appendix  B-5  for \norganizational structure) and by such other PIUs as required to implement additional non-core \nsubprojects. PIUs should be adequately staffed within 2 months of loan effectiveness and, in \nany case, before the award of civil works contracts under the subprojects, whichever is earlier. \nTwo staff at the level of general manager or deputy general manager will be assigned as project \ndirectors, one for each PIU, to be assisted by deputy general managers or managers, each \nresponsible  for  one  contract  package  or  a  PSP  component.  An  additional  deputy  general \nmanager or manager will be assigned for each PIU to oversee resettlement activities, and \nhandle grievances to be filed by the public, including project-affected people and NGOs. An \naccountant/financial  management  specialist  will  be  assigned  to  each  PIU.  Sufficient \nadministrative authority will be delegated to PIUs for effective and timely project implementation. \nPIU activities will be overseen by the NHAI chair through the project team, which is headed by a \nchief general manager in charge of the E-W Corridor. The project team\u2019s main function is to  \norganize preparation and implementation activities of the Project and process and implement \nvarious consulting service contracts.  \n \n39.  NHAI has already established a project team to develop the E-W Corridor. The team will \nbe supported by a technical group of experts consisting of (i) a group leader/highway engineer; \n(ii) a bridge engineer, (iii) a pavement cum material engineer, (iv) an economic and financial \nanalysis and PSP specialist, (v) an environmental specialist, and (vi) a resettlement and other \nsocial development specialist. The core functions of the technical group of experts are the \nfollowing: \n \n ", "                                   11 \n(i)  Review  and  examine  all  technical  reports,  including  the  feasibility  studies, \npreliminary  design,  initial  environment  examination  (IEE),  resettlement  plans, \npoverty and social development strategy, indigenous peoples\u2019 development plan \n(IPDP) if required, and detailed design to ensure that subprojects are prepared in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  policies  and  NHAI\u2019s  design  standards  and  other \nrequirements.  \n(ii)  Evaluate the overall viability of individual subprojects, and prepare a summary \nappraisal report to be submitted to ADB for approval, together with necessary \nattachments. \n(iii)  Conduct proof checking for highways and bridges. \n(iv)  Prepare bidding documents for the PSP component(s). \n \n40.  Eligibility  criteria  and  detailed  procedures  for  the  approval  process  to  facilitate \npreparation of non-core subprojects are in Appendix 11 and the Summary Appraisal Report \nFormat in Supplementary Appendix C-1. \n \n  2.  Implementation Schedule and Period  \n \n41.  The Project will be implemented over 48 months, inclusive of procurement and pre-\nconstruction activities, and is expected to be completed by 30 June 2007. The schedule will \nallow for acquisition of land free from encumbrances; resettlement; and clearance of all utilities, \ntrees, and any other obstructions from the land to be used for construction. The implementation \nschedule is in Appendix 6.  \n \n  3.  Procurement  \n \n42.  Civil  works  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement \nthrough international competitive bidding (ICB). Procurement of civil works under ICB will be \ncarried out among prequalified bidders. A list of contract packages for the core subprojects is in \nAppendix 5. For procurement of goods, ICB will be used for supply contracts estimated at more \nthan $500,000, international shopping for $100,000\u2013500,000, and direct purchase arrangement \nfor less than $100,000. \n \n43.  To expedite procurement, advance action for prequalification for civil works contracts \nwas approved by Management on 29 July 2003. The Government has been advised that this \napproval does not commit ADB to finance the Project. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n44.  For  the  highway  investment  component,  three  consulting  firms  will  be  engaged  to \nsupervise  construction  of  civil  works  using  full  technical  proposal  method  (Supplemental \nAppendix D-2 for terms of reference, 417 person-months of international and 4,719 person-\nmonths  of  domestic  consultants  will  be  required).  For  the  PSP  component,  a  domestic \nconsulting firm will be engaged to provide financial adviser\u2019s services using simplified technical \nproposal method (Supplemental Appendix of B-2; 15 person-months of domestic consultants \nwill  be  required).  For  the  road  safety  component,  an  international  consulting  firm  will  be \nengaged using simplified technical proposal method to develop a safety-zone concept and build \ncapacity to enforce traffic regulations and provide emergency medical services (Supplemental \nAppendix  B-4;  15  person-months  of  an  international  consultant  and  15  person-months  of \ndomestic consultants will be required). NHAI will engage these consultants in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the \n ", "12 \nselection and engagement of domestic consultants. The consultants will be engaged using the \nquality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  and  full  or  simplified  technical  proposals  in \naccordance with the size of contracts as stated.  \n \n45.  For the HIV/AIDS and anti-trafficking component, NHAI will engage locally based NGOs \nin accordance with its own procedures (Supplemental Appendix B-3; 98 person-months of \ndomestic NGOs will be required). These NGOs\u2019 activities will be supervised by a domestic \nindividual consultant who will also be financed under the component (36 person-months). The \ndomestic consultant will be engaged through arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the selection \nand engagement of domestic consultants. \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n46.  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (January 2001) and Disbursement Guidelines for Disbursement Operations, LIBOR-\nbased Loan Products (July 2002), as amended from time to time, primarily using direct payment \nprocedures for funds under large civil works contracts and consultancy services. To facilitate \nproject implementation through timely release of funds, an imprest account will be established \nby the Government with the Reserve Bank of India. The imprest account will be managed, \nreplenished, and liquidated in accordance with the above handbook and guidelines. The initial \namount to be deposited in the imprest account will be equivalent to the estimated eligible project \nexpenditures  for  the  next  6  months  or  10%  of  the  loan  amount,  whichever  is  lower.  Any \nindividual payment to be reimbursed or liquidated under the statement of expenditure (SOE) \nmethod for reimbursement of certain eligible expenditures will not exceed the equivalent of \n$300,000. \n \n6.  Accounting and Auditing \n \n47.  NHAI\u2019s  accounting  system  was  established  in  accordance  with  government \nrequirements, and its financial statements are prepared in a format prescribed by the Controller \nand Auditor General of India, which audits NHAI\u2019s financial statements annually. As a public \nsector authority, NHAI\u2019s accounting system generally adheres to basic commercial accounting \npractices  commonly  employed  in  India,  and  in  this  regard  is  broadly  in  accordance  with \nGenerally  Accepted  Accounting  Practices  (GAAP)  of  India.  Accrual  accounting  is  used, \ntransactions are recorded on a historical-cost basis, and a balance sheet and a profit-and-loss \nstatements are annually prepared (Appendix 7 for financial statements of NHAI). \n \n48.  To date, however, NHAI operates as a government agent with primary responsibility to \ndevelop national highways. As such, NHAI does not recognize road infrastructure as assets. On \nthe balance sheet, road construction expenditure is shown as work in progress where it remains \nupon completion of works. An accounting policy to otherwise retain these assets on the books \nhas yet to be determined. NHAI\u2019s primary source of reported revenue is the management fee \nreceived from the Government in return for completing the entrusted works. Toll revenues are \nnot treated as NHAI income but as accounts payable to the Government. Similarly, interest \nreceived on unused advances is not treated as NHAI income but is recognized as a capital \nsurplus or an increase to capital. As of FY2000, the main differences NHAI accounting practices \nand statement presentation with those of GAAP in India are detailed in NHAI\u2019s notes to the \nfinancial statements.  \n \n49.  Thus,  while  in  accordance  with  government  reporting  requirements,  NHAI  financial \nstatements do not provide sufficient information to appropriately evaluate the effectiveness of \n ", "                                   13 \nNHAI\u2019s financial structure or financial performance. The lack of integrated physical and financial \nplanning systems and integrated accounting and financial reporting systems does not support \nprovision  of  timely  information  to  management,  or  effective  cash-flow  management.  NHAI \nrecognizes that if it is to become more efficient and autonomous, it needs to strengthen its \nfinancial  management  capacity  and  ability  to  mobilize  financing  in  domestic  as  well  as \ninternational financial markets. The envisaged TA18 will help NHAI address these issues.  \n   \n50.  NHAI will maintain separate project (including subproject) accounts. An independent \nauditor acceptable and satisfactory to ADB will annually audit the project accounts and financial \nstatements of NHAI. It will submit unaudited project accounts to ADB not later than 6 months \nfrom  the  close  of  each  fiscal  year,  and  the  audited  financial  statements  including  project \naccounts not later than 9 months. The annual audit of the project account should separately \ncover the imprest account and SOE procedure. The auditor\u2019s opinion on the imprest account \nand SOE should be separately set out in the auditor\u2019s report. NHAI was made aware of ADB\u2019s \npolicy on delayed submission and also of the importance of satisfactory and acceptable quality \nof audited reports.  \n \n7.  Project Supervision and Review and Reporting \n  \n51.  A project inception mission will be fielded soon after project loan approval to initiate \nimplementation. The Government and NHAI will periodically review the Project to assess and \nevaluate the scope, implementation arrangements (with due participation of local NGOs and \ncommunity),  benefit  monitoring,  and  progress  and  achievement  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProject Performance Management Systems Handbook. The Borrower, NHAI, and ADB will \nundertake a midterm project review in May 2005. It will (i) review the project scope, design, and \nimplementation arrangements; (ii) identify changes needed since project appraisal; (iii) assess \nimplementation performance against project performance indicators; (iv) review resettlement \noperations; (v) review and establish compliance with the legal covenants; (vi) identify problems \nand constraints; and (vii) if necessary, recommend changes in project design or implementation \narrangements. In case the midterm review requires changes in project implementation, NHAI \nand  ADB  will  agree  on  appropriate  measures,  including  changes  in  implementation \narrangements, to ensure that project objectives are met. \n \n52.  NHAI will provide quarterly and semi-annual reports to ADB on project execution. Three \nmonths after project completion, NHAI will provide ADB with a project completion report. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation   \n \n53.  With help from construction supervision consultants, NHAI will monitor and evaluate \nproject  performance  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Project  Performance  Management  System \nHandbook. NHAI will set up the project performance management system within 3 months of \nloan effectiveness. Primary monitoring indicators to be used by NHAI and reported to ADB will \nbe (i) percentage of roads without discernable congestion, to measure capacity expansion; (ii) \ninternational roughness index, to measure the riding quality of project roads; (iii) travel/transit \ntime, to measure increased efficiency for passenger/goods transport; (iv) freight for trucking \nservice and intercity fare for bus services, to measure reduction in transport costs; (v) traffic \nfatalities, to measure increased road safety; and (vi) length of highway sections to be developed \nby the private sector for the entire E-W Corridor, to measure the extent of PSP. Initial and target \n                                                 \n18 ADB. 2000. Enhancement of NHAI\u2019s Capacity for Financial Management and Social/Operational Issues. Manila \n(TA 3724-IND, included in the Western Transport Corridor Project, whose scope was modified in February 2003). \n ", "14 \nvalues for each indicator, together with methodologies for compiling data, are in Supplementary \nAppendix D-1.  \n \nIV.   PROJECT BENEFITS AND IMPACTS \n \nA.  Social Aspect \n \n54.  An  initial  poverty  reduction  and  social  assessment  was  carried  out  during  project \npreparation and, based on the findings, the poverty reduction and social strategy was developed \n(Appendix 9). The Project is classified as economic growth but not as a poverty intervention. A \nparticipatory approach was taken in designing the Project, including consultation with local \ngovernments and communities. NHAI has instituted a system to obtain feedback from road \nusers and other relevant parties. An advisory group of key stakeholders was established in \nOctober  2000  with  participation  of  representatives  from  trucking  industries,  the  public, \nautomobile manufacturers\u2019 associations, financial institutions, chambers of commerce, state \ngovernments, NGOs, and construction and consultancy industries. The Advisory Group meets \nat least twice a year to deliberate on all aspects of highway operations and improvements on \nhighway use. The Advisory Group expressed the need to (i) strengthen road safety measures, \n(ii) control overloading, (iii) prevent encroachment, and (iv) maintain highways.  \n  \n1.   Resettlement and Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Issues \n \n55.  Core  subproject.  A  resettlement  plan  for  the  core  subproject  from  the \nRajasthan/Madhya Pradesh border to Jhansi (package C), covering a stretch of 131 km, has \nbeen prepared. The plan is based on an enumeration of all structures within the existing ROW \nwidth and on the land to be acquired for road widening, including the proposed 24 km Shivpuri \nbypass. The survey data indicates that the impact will be largely on roadside shops/businesses. \nA total of 859 structures (residential/commercial) will require demolition. In addition, the road \nwidening  and  improvements  will  affect  45  religious/community  structures.  Land  acquisition \nsurvey data have been collected to assess subproject impact on agricultural households. Over \n1,400  households  will  be  affected  by  loss  of  agricultural  land:  of  these,  123  families  will \nexperience loss of over 10% of their holdings while 14 will lose 75%.  \n \n56.  According  to  the  revised  resettlement  plan,  construction  of  the  core  subproject  will \nrequire acquisition of an estimated 332 hectares (ha) (212 ha private, 84 ha forest, and 34 ha \nrevenue/government land). The bulk of land acquisition will be from the two ends of the Shivpuri \nbypass. A considerable length of the bypass (about 12 km) will cut through protected forest \nareas. Efforts have been made to minimize land acquisition and reduce resettlement impacts as \nmuch as possible by (i) keeping ROW to 45 meters (m) wide in built-up areas and reserve forest \nareas, (ii) adopting concentric symmetrical widening, (iii) raising carriageway over congested \nsegments, and (iv) using bypasses to avoid congested urban settlements. The ROW in the \nbypass through the reserve forest will use the existing \u201cfire lane\u201d corridor to minimize the impact \non the forest. Statutory approval will be obtained for change in land use.  \n \n57.  As per the resettlement plan, people will lose residential, commercial, and community \nstructures; business and employment; homestead and agricultural land; crops; and livelihood \nsources. Nearly 70% of the structures are pucca (brick and cement) and the rest are semi-\npucca  or  temporary  houses.  Over  40%  of  users  of  the  structures  (particularly  shops)  are \ntenants. Based on estimated incomes from all sources, about 15% of the households are below \nthe poverty line.  \n \n ", "                                   15 \n58.  The summary resettlement plan (Appendix 10) provides further details about subproject \nimpact and measures proposed for mitigation. As per the entitlement matrix, key measures \ninclude compensation at full replacement cost for all lost assets. In addition to payments by the \ncompetent authority, affected people will receive additional grants to match replacement costs \nof lost assets (land and houses), transaction costs such as stamps and registration costs (in \ncase of purchase of replacement land), and other cash grants and resettlement assistance such \nas  shifting  allowance,  and  compensation  for  loss  of  workdays/income  due  to  dislocation. \nFemale-headed  households  and  other  vulnerable  households  will  be  eligible  for  further \nassistance in accordance with entitlement as detailed in the RP. \n \n59.  Two resettlement sites have been identified in consultation with affected people and \nlocal administrations. The sites are close to existing settlements to minimize disruption. Affected \npeople will be given several options for relocation, including additional assistance. The sites for \nresidential dwellers will be developed with basic amenities (e.g., internal roads, sanitary/water \nsupply, community infrastructures, etc.). Displaced households have expressed their desire for \nself-relocation. Besides compensation for lost assets, families requiring relocation will receive \nshifting allowances for resettlement. NHAI disclosed the draft resettlement plan to the affected \npeople/local officials on 27 June 2003. The comments have been used to improve resettlement \nplan  entitlements.  The  project  director  (NHAI-Kota)  conducted  an  information  seminar  in \nSeptember 2003 to disseminate information among various stakeholders, particularly district-\nlevel government officials in Shivpuri.  \n \n60.  A  detailed  field  survey  was  undertaken  to  assess  the  socioeconomic  status  of \nindigenous people and their livelihood sources. The most important scheduled tribes of the \nproject area are the Bhil, Mina, and Saharia in Shivpuri, while a small number of Bhotiya inhabit \nJhansi district of Uttar Pradesh. The core subproject will directly affect only 13 households and \nshops over the 131 km stretch. Socioeconomic and occupational/income data suggest that \naffected scheduled tribes are similar to the overall affected population and largely assimilated \ninto local mainstream communities. The scheduled and non-scheduled tribe population view the \nhighway  project  as  beneficial  as  it  will  likely  generate  more  business  and  economic \nopportunities. Improved transportation and connectivity will increase jobs. \n \n61.  As indicated earlier, scheduled tribes directly affected by the subproject are shop owners \nand  businesspeople.  Their  economic  activities  are  strongly  tied  to  mainstream  economic \nactivities, and unlikely to be affected any differently than non-tribals. As such, a separate IPDP \nfor scheduled tribes is not needed. The resettlement plan paid special attention to scheduled \ntribes and other vulnerable groups within the resettlement processes, particularly livelihood and \nincome restoration, including a separate income restoration program for them. \n \n62.  To effectively manage resettlement and further strengthen ESDU, NHAI has engaged a \nmanager for resettlement. NHAI has indicated that the ESDU will also engage two long-term \nstaff consultants from its own funds\u2014one for resettlement and one for environment from its own \nfunds\u2014to enhance its capacity for management and operations, and thus more closely involve \nESDU staff in resettlement management and supervision of NGOs/consultants in resettlement \nplan implementation. A local resettlement specialist and ESDU will undertake training program \nunder the Project for NGOs and NHAI officials. \n \n63.  Non-core subprojects. A resettlement framework (Appendix C-6) and an indigenous \npeoples\u2019 development framework (Appendix C-7) will serve as a basis to prepare subsequent \nresettlement plans for non-core subprojects and IPDPs as required. The frameworks were \ndisclosed in the project areas in June 2003. All plans will be prepared in full consultation with \n ", "16 \naffected persons and disclosed in draft form to them. The resettlement and IPDP frameworks \nwill be placed on the ADB web site before submission of the Project for board approval.  \n \n64.  Based on the initial checklist and social assessment, NHAI will determine if IPDPs are \nrequired for non-core subprojects. NHAI will ensure that social assessments are incorporated \ninto the subproject design, including measures to minimize or avoid resettlement impacts and \nimpacts on indigenous people who are dependent on land for their livelihoods. NHAI will screen \nand review resettlement plans/IPDPs for subprojects before submitting them to ADB. A qualified \nresettlement specialist has been included in the technical group within the project team for \nsubproject evaluation and screening. \n   \n2.  HIV/AIDS and Trafficking in Women and Children  \n \n65.  Over  the  past  decade,  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking  have  become  major \ndevelopment concerns in India. The Government estimates that about 4 million people are \ninfected with HIV, including 500,000 with AIDS cases in 2002; 85% of transmission is through \nheterosexual sex, and condom use is still not a norm. This makes commercial sex workers and \ntheir clients such as truck drivers and helpers along national highway corridors among the most \nvulnerable high-risk groups. The increase in traffic volume may mean more unsafe sexual \nactivity unless strengthened and targeted interventions are in place. \n \n66.  The  centuries-old  phenomenon  of  trafficking  in  women  and  children  has  reportedly \nintensified with growing economic disparities, increasing number of migrants, and improved \ntransport and communication. Of human trafficking, 90% occurs within the country, with major \ncities such as Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, and Ahmedabad as destinations or transit points to \nabroad.  Traffickers  target  the  most  desperate  and  vulnerable\u2014women  and  children  from \ncommunities stricken by chronic poverty and debt and by natural calamities such as droughts \nand floods; and from scheduled tribes and castes, who are illiterate and have few life skills \noutside their communities. Deception through false promises of better jobs or false marriage \nproposals is the common modus operandi. The combination of the economically and socially \nlow status of women and widespread poverty is at the core of the flesh trade. The known points \nfor  trafficking  include  local  roadside  teashops,  brothels,  construction  sites  and  quarries, \nfactories, bus terminals and railway stations, and urban streets.  \n \n67.  The feasibility study projected an extremely high risk of an AIDS epidemic and human \ntrafficking.  The  project  areas  have  been  severely  affected  by  recent  droughts  and  have \ncommunities of economically and socially vulnerable scheduled castes and tribal groups (e.g., \nMeena, Bedia, Saharia, Bhil). Commercial sex areas are developing along the corridors. The \nimproved  connection  from  these  vulnerable  roadside  communities  to  major  cities,  and  the \nanticipated increase in roadside commercial sex activity will significantly increase the risk of \nHIV/AIDS and human trafficking. The influx of outside laborers (mainly male) during construction \nand their interaction with vulnerable local communities and access to roadside teashops will \nneed special attention. \n \n68.  Truck drivers are not only clients of sex workers but also reportedly help in trafficking \nwomen and children. Young girls are brought from one place to another and subsequently \nhanded over to waiting agents. Meanwhile, the truck drivers themselves drivers shut off a \npossible avenue for these girls to return to normal life. In project areas, major traffic runs from \nnorth to south or vice versa, passing through Shivpuri along NH3 and also through Jhansi along \nNH26. East-west movement is much less frequent due to poor road conditions. However, once \n ", "                                   17 \nthe E-W Corridor is completed, such movement will significantly increase, with the likely result \nthat HIV/AIDS and human trafficking will become more prevalent.  \n \n69.  As  HIV/AIDS  and  other  emerging  social  problems  such  as  poverty  and  indigenous \npeoples\u2019  lack  of  development  become  more  serious,  NHAI  has  strengthened  ESDU\u2019s \norganizational structure by engaging a general manager in charge of these issues. NHAI also \nplans to engage a manager to handle emerging social problems and establish an ESDU cell to \ndeal with HIV/AIDS and human trafficking (para. 32).  \n \n3.  Road Safety \n \n70.  While contributing to economic growth, an improved road network can also lead to more \nroad accidents. National road safety statistics show a 5% annual increase of road accidents in \nthe past 2 years, with around 70,000 fatalities in 2001.19 The fatality rate per 10,000 vehicles is \n21, which is twice higher than in some other Asian countries (for instance, 10 in Thailand). \nAbout 65% of all road accidents occur on NHs; 83% of all nationwide road accidents are the \nfault of drivers. About 50\u201360% of road traffic accidents involve heavy commercial vehicles such \nas trucks and buses.  \n \n71.  The  project  states  have  fewer  traffic  accidents  due  to  low  traffic  density.  Madhya \nPradesh had 58 fatalities per 1 million people in 2000, and Uttar Pradesh, 50\u2014lower than the \nnational average of 78. However, as traffic increases, these numbers are likely to increase \nsubstantially.  \n \n72.  The institutional set-up for road safety faces a number of problems. Coordination among \nvarious agencies is weak. While the National Road Safety Council was established in the late \n1990s, it does not function effectively. The lack of effective traffic regulation enforcement is \nanother  problem.  Institutional  arrangements  for  enforcement  need  to  be  reexamined.  ADB \nintends to undertake soon TA20 on emerging social issues, a component of which will address \nenforcement and compare the current state police-based system and a possible network-based \nhighway police system.  \n \n73.  The establishment of an effective vehicle inspection system is another challenge. Based \non the Motor Vehicle Act and its state implementation regulations, vehicle inspection systems \nare already in place but ineffective. The Government (MORTH and other relevant agencies) and \nthe private sector (automotive industry associations and other parties) have jointly taken a \nsector initiative, in which ADB will actively participate.  \n \n74.  Facilities along highways such as rest areas should be improved. The Government is \nexperimenting with several types of wayside amenities on a pilot basis (for instance, in Haryana \nand Tamil Nadu states), but the facilities appear not to cover a wide range of needs (including of \ntruck drivers, who need special small-scale rest areas).  \n \n75.  Road safety audits have been an integral part of ADB highway projects. Consultants will \nsoon be engaged to carry out safety audits on roads included in the Surat-Manor Tollway, West \n                                                 \n19 Government of India. 2003.

Manila \n(TA 3724-IND, included in the Western Transport Corridor Project, whose scope was modified in February 2003). \nAs soon as the details of the TA proposal are agreed on with the Government, consultants will be short-listed. \n ", "18 \nTransport Corridor, and East-West Corridor projects. The scope of the consultants\u2019 work will be \nexpanded to include the Project.21  \n \n76.  Implementation of the above actions requires a comprehensive, targeted road safety \npolicy. A policy and institutional matrix on road safety (Supplementary Appendix A-3) was \nprepared and discussed with the Government and World Bank to support the Government\u2019s \neffort to develop comprehensive action plans on road safety.  \n \n4.  Poverty Impact \n \n77.  The overall objective of the Project is to connect the eastern and western ends of India \nvia better road networks. Although not designed as a poverty intervention project, the Project \nwill, by virtue of passing through the countryside where a large percentage of the population \nlives below the poverty line, help reduce poverty by encouraging human development and \neconomic growth. Better connectivity with mainstream economic regions will also help reduce \nregional disparities among fast-growing and backward states such as those in the northeast.  \n \n78.   Project roads mostly have two lanes; some have only one. Poverty levels in Madhya \nPradesh are 37%, and in Uttar Pradesh 31%, significantly higher than for India as a whole at \n26.1%. The project region is part of the Bundelkhand plateau, which has little or no productive \nland and low rainfall. Recent persistent drought has forced migration of productive labor and \nencouraged human trafficking and the commercial sex trade in vulnerable sections along the \ncorridor.  A  separate  HIV/AIDS  prevention  and  anti-trafficking  program  will  be  implemented \nunder the Project. Scheduled tribes in the interior have taken to a nomadic lifestyle, moving and \nsettling along the road, seeking jobs.  \n \n79.   Rural  inaccessibility  is  one  of  several  key  reasons  for  poverty  and  deprivation  in \nRajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. Their rural populations are widely dispersed, \nmaking road connectivity a particularly critical factor for those seeking economic opportunities \nand social services. However, past neglect of the road network overall has contributed to lack of \nrural mobility in the states. \n \n80.   The Government\u2019s road sector policy is to establish an integrated road network linking \nlower levels of road systems (rural and major district roads) to higher levels (state roads and \nnational highways) to connect rural communities to urban centers (vertical connectivity), which \nare, in turn, connected to other urban centers (horizontal connectivity). ADB will thus provide \nloans for rural roads, major district/state roads, and NHs. While it will deal with the NH segment, \nthe Project will also improve rural accessibility by establishing a well-integrated road network, \nand thus help reduce poverty in project areas. \n \n81.  Improved  road  networks  will  increase  long-term  economic  opportunities  of  rural \ncommunities  by  (i)  enabling  villagers  to  shift  from  subsistence  farming  to  market-oriented \nagricultural surplus production; and (ii) helping local people, particularly the youth, move out of \ntheir communities to work at better-paid jobs in manufacturing or commerce. The Project will \nalso provide social benefits such as improved access to health, education, and social services. \nThe Project will have a short-term poverty reduction impact as the rural poor are hired for \nconstruction, tree planting, and ensuing maintenance works. These opportunities will directly \nincrease  earnings  for  the  poor,  who  are  largely  dependent  on  occasional  and  temporary \nemployment. \n                                                 \n21 The need for an expeditious road safety audit was discussed during project appraisal. NHAI has assigned a new \ngeneral manager, who is expected to expedite engagement of consultants.  \n ", "                                   19 \n \n  Figure 1: Hierarchical Structure of India's Road \n(Horizontally connected} \nV State Capital \ne\nrtic State Capital StateS Ctaatpei tCaal pital \na\nlly\n c        National Highways\no\nn\nnec DiHstQrict  DiHstQrict \nte\nd  \n         Major District Roads Major District Roads\n   \nBlock   Block  Block  Block  \nHQ HQ HQ HQ\n \n     Rural Roads Rural Roads                     Rural Roads             Rural Roads\n     \nVillage Village Village Village Village Village Village Village\n \nB.  Environmental Assessment \n \n82.  The Project was originally classified as an A/B project in accordance with ADB\u2019s 2003 \nEnvironmental Assessment Guidelines since project roads were planned to traverse Madhav \nNational Park, but it was agreed to develop a bypass to the park. With this modification in \nalignment,  the  Project was  reclassified  as  a category  B  sensitive.  The  summary  IEE  was \nprepared for the core subproject and circulated to the Board on 4 August 2003. \n \n83.  The  park  bypass  goes  through  Chironji  Reserve  Forest,  where  diversification  of \nforestland  to  other  use  is  permitted  with  clearance  from  the  Ministry  of  Environment  and \nForests. NHAI prepared the IEE report, which assessed environmental impacts of the core \nsubproject and prescribed environmental mitigation measures as part of the environmental \nmanagement and monitoring plan. The subproject will have major environmental impacts during \nconstruction. The contractor will implement all required mitigating measures during construction. \nNHAI  will  ensure  that  the  measures  are  stated  clearly  in  contract  documents.  It  will  be \nresponsible for overall implementation of the environmental management plan and, therefore, \nthrough its construction supervision consultant, will supervise and monitor implementation of \nmitigation measures. ADB will also be given all access to undertake environmental monitoring. \nThe total cost of environmental mitigation measures, including the tree planting program and \nenvironmental monitoring, is about Rs70 million.  \n  \n84.  NHAI will also prepare the environmental assessment for non-core subprojects. The \nprocedure for reviewing the IEE report has been established. The key requirements for the \nenvironmental assessment for non-core subprojects are as follows:  \n \n(i)  No subprojects will pass through a designated national park or sanctuaries.  \n(ii)  The IEE, including the environmental management and monitoring plan, will be \nprepared for each subproject.  \n(iii)  If a subproject is less than 500 m from the border of a national park or sanctuary, \nthe subproject will be classified as B sensitive, and the summary IEE must be \nmade public 120 days before awarding of construction works.  \n(iv)  Only subprojects that meet the Government\u2019s environmental requirements will be \nfunded by the Project.  \n ", "20 \n(v)  All environmental assessment documents should be properly kept as part of the \nproject document and made available to the public if required. \n \nC.   Economic Assessment \n \n85.  An economic evaluation of the core section has been undertaken to compare the with- \nand without-project scenarios. In the with-project scenario, the upgraded four-lane highway will \nallow improved traffic flow, higher vehicle speeds, and shorter travel time, all resulting in lower \nvehicle operating costs (VOCs). Economic benefits estimated include VOC savings (as a result \nof better road conditions and increased vehicle operating speeds) for normal traffic,22 and time \nsavings for cargo transport. Economic benefits anticipated from savings in passenger travel time \nand reduced traffic accidents have not been included as they are difficult to estimate.  \n \n86.  Economic costs of implementing the Project are based on financial cost estimates, and \ninclude civil works; environmental improvement works; land acquisition, relocation of utilities, \nand resettlement costs; and construction supervision. Costs related to the HIV/AIDS prevention \nand anti-trafficking, and road safety components; taxes and duties;23 and financing charges, \nincluding interest during construction, have been excluded. Nontradables have been adjusted \nusing a conversion factor of 0.9. \n \n87.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the core section is calculated at 22.9%. A \nsensitivity analysis of the EIRR has been undertaken for changes in the underlying cost-and-\nbenefit parameters. Based on the sensitivity analysis, the Project is determined to be most \nsensitive  to  a  decrease  in  estimated  project  benefits.  In  the  most  adverse  situation\u2014a \nsimultaneous increase of 20% in project costs (capital and O&M), a reduction of 20% in project \nbenefits, and a 2-year delay in project completion\u2014the combined EIRR is estimated at 16.2% \nper cent (Appendix 8).  \n \nD.   Financial Assessment \n \n88.  The core section was also financially evaluated to assess the projected toll revenues \nagainst capital costs to improve and widen the road, and recurring costs for road operations and \nroutine and periodic maintenance over 30 years. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) for \nthe core section is calculated at 6.8%, above NHAI\u2019s weighted average cost of capital in real \nterms at 4.2%, and is most sensitive to reductions in tariff level and traffic assumptions, and less \nsensitive  to  changes  in  O&M  costs  and  delays  in  project  completion.  Verification  and \nappropriate  modeling  of  traffic  assumptions,  and  development  and  implementation  of  an \nappropriate  toll  strategy  will  be  critical  to  ensure  the  Project\u2019s  financial  viability  and \nsustainability. \n \nE.   Potential Risk  \n \n89.  A potential risk is the existing possible delay in project implementation due to prolonged \nland acquisition. The need for it is relatively limited. Most existing ROWs are broad enough to \naccommodate service roads and drainage lines. Land acquisition procedures were streamlined \nby the recent amendment of the National Highway Act, which will enable NHAI, to acquire land \nmore expeditiously and predictably. As indicated by NHAI, the competent authority under the \nNational Highways Act of 1956 was notified in September 2003, notification to acquire land is \nexpected by February 2004, and detailed declaration of land acquisition by May 2004.  \n                                                 \n22 Normal traffic refers to projected traffic in the road corridor that will occur without and with the Project.  \n23 Value-added tax, customs, and duties are roughly estimated to equal 10% of the base cost. \n ", "                                   21 \n \n90.  Another  potential  risk  associated  with  project  implementation  is  possible  delay  in \nprocessing non-core subprojects due to the unfamiliarity of NHAI with procedural requirements \nof ADB\u2019s sector loan. Detailed forms of summary subproject appraisal report, checklists, and \nother reporting formats have been provided to NHAI to facilitate its processing of subprojects. \nTo strengthen its technical capability, NHAI has established a technical group of experts within \nthe  project  team,  covering  highway  design,  bridge  construction,  pavement  and  material, \neconomic and financial analysis, environmental assessment, resettlement, and PSP. Project \npreparatory TA consultants will train staff of the project team, including those of the technical \ngroup of experts. Such action and support will minimize the chance of delay due to a new \nlending modality.  \n \nV.   ASSURANCES \n \n91.  The Government and NHAI have given the following specific assurances, in addition to \nthe standard and usual assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents:  \n \nA.  Project Implementation  \n \n(a)  Within 2 months of loan effectiveness, and in any case before the award of civil \nworks contracts under the subprojects, whichever is earlier, NHAI will ensure that the two PIUs \n(in Kota and Jhansi) and the project team are adequately staffed by experienced managerial \nand  professional  personnel,  including  accounting,  financial  management,  and  resettlement \nexperts, during the entire period of project implementation.  \n(b)  The PIUs will be headed by project directors (at the level of general or deputy \ngeneral manager) assisted by deputy general managers/managers, each responsible for one \ncontract package or PSP component. An additional deputy general manager/manager of NHAI \nwill  be  assigned  to  each  PIU  and  be  responsible  for  overseeing  resettlement,  HIV/AIDS \nprevention,  and  anti-trafficking  activities;  and  for  handling  grievances  filed  by  the  public, \nincluding project-affected people and NGOs.  \n(c)  NHAI will make within 6 months of loan effectiveness, adequate arrangements \nfor coordination with MORTH and relevant state authorities for implementation of Road Safety \nComponent.  \n \nB.  Execution of Civil Works \n \n(d)  That NHAI will, subject to the provisions of clauses (u) and (aa): (1) acquire or \nmake available on time (i.e., strictly in accordance with the schedule in the civil works contract) \nthe land and rights in land, free from any encumbrances; and (2) clear utilities, trees, and any \nother obstruction from such land on time as required for construction relating to each section of \nthe civil works contract under a subproject. \n(e)  NHAI will ensure that subsequent to award of the civil works contract under any \nsubproject, no section or part thereof under the civil works contract will be handed over to the \ncontractor unless the provisions of clauses (d), (u), and (aa) have been complied with. \n \nC.  Road Safety  \n \n(f)  NHAI  will  carry  out  road  safety  audit  for  the  subproject  highways  during \nconstruction and operation, and by 31 May 2006 develop recommendations for other parts of \nthe NH system.  NHAI will also monitor incidence of traffic accidents on subproject highways to \nADB as agreed, during implementation and 2 years after the Project completion. \n ", "22 \nD.  Operation and Maintenance \n \n(g)  NHAI will ensure that upon completion of each subproject highway, its O&M \ncontracts  are  awarded  to  the  third  parties  under  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ensure \nsustainability  of  the  subproject  highways.  NHAI  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  the  terms  and \nconditions of the O&M arrangements. \n(h)  The Government will ensure that NHAI starts tolling the subproject highways as \nsoon as possible, and in any event within six months of construction completion. To achieve this \nthe Government will help NHAI in obtaining the statutory approvals and public notification of the \ntolling.  \n \nE.  Toll \n \n(i)  NHAI will initiate a study on the toll system (as financed under a loan Loan No. \n1747-IND: Surat-Manor Tollway Project) by December 2003 at the latest, for implementation not \nlater than December 2004. \n(j)  The Government and NHAI will finalize arrangements so that NHAI will be able to \nretain tolls collected, as its own revenue from not later than 31 December 2004.  \n \nF.  Private Sector Participation  \n \n(k)  NHAI will ensure that at least 10% of the length of the E-W Corridor to be \ndeveloped under the Project will be under the PSP component.  \n(l)  NHAI will identify and recommend subprojects for inclusion under PSP within \nthree months of loan effectiveness. \n(m)  The Government and NHAI will ensure that the subproject sponsors/bidders for \nthe  PSP  Component  are  selected  in  a  transparent  manner  through  competitive  bidding \nprocedures under intimation to ADB. \n(n)  NHAI will finance and take necessary steps to ensure that the bidding process \nand  award  of  contract  are  carried  out  on  time  so  that  the  PSP  part  is  completed  and \noperationalized along with the rest of the subproject highways. \n(o)  NHAI  will  ensure  that  the  results  of  the  bidding  process,  negotiations,  and \nfinancial closure with the private sector are reported to ADB on time so that the Government \nand ADB can take necessary and prompt action to complete the part(s) in case PSP does not \nfinalize. \n(p)  NHAI  will  engage,  not  later  than  six  months  from  identification  of  the  PSP \nsubprojects, a financial adviser to help package PSP. \n(q)  The Government and NHAI will ensure that in the selection, construction, and \nO&M of the PSP, all criteria and requirements are followed as required for subprojects. \n \nG.  Environment \n \n(r)  NHAI will implement the Project in accordance with ADB's 2003 Environmental \nAssessment Guidelines, as amended from time to time.  \n(s)  NHAI will ensure that all subproject environmental mitigation measures identified \nin the IEE and summary IEE are incorporated into the detailed subproject designs and followed \nduring  construction  and  O&M  of  the  subproject  highways.  NHAI  will  also  ensure  that  the \nsubprojects are designed and constructed according to the environmental management and \nmonitoring plan agreed upon with ADB in accordance with its 2003 Environmental Assessment \nGuidelines, as amended from time to time. \n ", "                                   23 \n(t)  Any  subproject  classified  as  category  A  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  2003 \nEnvironmental Assessment Guidelines, as amended from time to time, will not be eligible for \nfinancing under the Project. \n(u)  NHAI will ensure that any subproject that involves acquisition of a section or part \nthereof  under  a  civil  works  contract  and  that  passes  through  forestland  and/or  needs \ndiversification  of  forestland  to  other  use,  statutory  clearances  under  the  1980  Forest \nConservation Act, and environmental clearances under the 1994 Indian Environmental Impact \nAssessment Notification shall be obtained before civil works start in that section.  \n \nH.  Land Acquisition, Resettlement, and Indigenous Peoples \n \n(v)  For  the  core  subproject  the  Government  and  NHAI  will  implement  the \nresettlement plan agreed upon with ADB, in consultation with the concerned state and district \nauthorities and with people affected by the subproject, in accordance with the Government\u2019s \napplicable laws, ADB\u2019s 1995 Policy on Involuntary Resettlement, ADB\u2019s 1998 Handbook on \nResettlement, and ADB\u2019s 1998 Policy on Indigenous Peoples all as amended from time to time. \nSimilarly for the non-core subprojects, NHAI will prepare and implement resettlement plans and \nIPDP as required, in accordance with the principles and procedures laid out in the resettlement \nframework and IPDF, respectively, to be submitted to ADB for approval before award of the \nrelated civil works contracts. Any changes required in the resettlement plan or IPDP based on \ndetailed subproject designs will be subject to ADB\u2019s approval before the award of any civil works \ncontracts.  \n(w)  NHAI will ensure that people affected by the Project are consulted and fairly \ncompensated on replacement values such that their living standards are not adversely affected, \nin accordance with the resettlement plan. \n(x)  NHAI will submit the progress and completion reports on land acquisition and \nresettlement that will be included under the financial audit statements for each subproject.  \n(y)  NHAI  will  disclose  the  resettlement  plans  for  the  subprojects  and  make  the \ninformation available to all affected people before land acquisition and resettlement, and confirm \nthat such information is posted on ADB\u2019s web site. NHAI will also ensure that essential public \ninfrastructure  that  may  be  affected  under  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  is  replaced \nappropriately and expeditiously in accordance with the resettlement plan. \n(z)  To  ensure  timely  monitoring  of  resettlement  plan  implementation,  NHAI  will \nappoint an independent monitoring expert within three months of loan effectiveness. The expert \nwill provide monitoring reports to ADB through NHAI once every six months. \n(aa)  Under  each  subproject  as  applicable,  NHAI  will  settle  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement compensation issues through (i) payment of full compensation/replacement value \nfor land/structure (residential/ commercial) to legal titleholders (ii) payment of full replacement \nvalue of structure (residential/commercial) to affected informal settlers/roadside squatters (iiii) \npayment of full compensation for acquired land to titled owners and (iv) payment of all other \nadditional benefits and provision of assistance in accordance with resettlement plan provisions, \nincluding income restoration grants and skill training during subproject implementation. \n \nI.  Social Measures \n \n(bb)  NHAI  will  ensure  public  awareness  and  acceptance  of  the  Project  and \nsubprojects through participation of NGOs and local community. To avoid the influx of informal \ndwellers and fraudulent claims during implementation, upon approval of each subproject, NHAI \nwill immediately (within not more than 2 months) commence issuing photo identity cards to all \neligible, including non-titled, affected persons. To facilitate timely and effective implementation  \n \n ", "24 \nand  monitoring  of  the  resettlement  plan,  NHAI  will  hire  NGOs  and  depute  resettlement-\nmonitoring officers in the PIUs.  \n(cc)  NHAI will set up grievance-handling units in ESDU and in each PIU, to address \nenvironmental, resettlement, and other social issues promptly. Grievance redress committees \nwill be formed in accordance with the resettlement plan and resettlement framework in each \ndistrict to resolve land acquisition and resettlement disputes.  \n(dd)  NHAI will ensure that civil works contracts under the subprojects incorporate \nprovisions requiring contractors to (i) carry out HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention programs \nfor labor; (ii) not employ or use children as labor; (iii) disseminate information at worksites on \nrisks of sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS as part of health and safety measures for \nthose employed during construction; and (iv) follow and implement legally mandated provisions \non labor (including equal pay for equal work), health, safety, sanitation, and working conditions. \nThe contracts will also provide for termination of the contract by NHAI in case of breach by \ncontractors of any of the provisions. \n(ee)  NHAI will set up within ESDU an HIV/AIDS prevention and anti-trafficking cell and \nengage qualified locally based NGOs to carry out the HIV/AIDS prevention and anti-trafficking \ncomponent as agreed on with ADB. ESDU will supervise the NGOs and work closely with state \nagencies such as AIDS control societies, departments of women and child development and \nsocial welfare, and other networks dedicated to preventing HIV/AIDS, human trafficking and to \nempowerment of women and children. \n \nJ.  Subproject Selection Criteria and Procedures \n \n(ff)  NHAI will ensure that for being selected, the subprojects follow the eligibility \ncriteria and procedures as agreed on with ADB as given in detail in Appendix 11. \n \nK.  Condition for Award of Civil Works Contract \n \n(gg)  NHAI will not award any civil works contract under a subproject unless it has, \nsubject to provisions of clauses (d), (u), and (aa), (1) acquired or made available the land and \nrights in land, free from any encumbrances; and (2) cleared the utilities, trees, and any obstruction \nfrom such land relating to the first section required to be handed over for commencement of \nconstruction in accordance with the schedule as agreed under the related civil works contract.  \n \nL.  Condition for Loan Disbursement  \n \n(hh)  The Government will have paid the front-end fee on the loan to ADB. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n92.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB and acting in the absence of the President, under the provisions of Article 35.1 of the \nArticles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board approve the loan of $400,000,000 to \nIndia for the National Highway Corridor (Sector) I Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources \nwith interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility;

India has an extensive and diverse transport system of about 3.4 million kilometers (km) \nof road; 63,140 km of rail; 12 major and 182 minor and intermediate ports; 4 major international \nairports; 86 domestic airports; and about 14,500 km of navigable inland waterway. The ratio of \nroad to rail transport has been continuously shifting as demand for transport services changes. \nRoad transport now accounts for over 60% of freight movement and 80% of passenger traffic, \nwith rail transport accounting for much of the remainder. A profile of transport in India is in \nSupplementary Appendix A-1. \n \nA.  Sector Profile \n \n  1.   Transport Planning and Coordination \n \n2.  Transport planning, coordination, and policy setting at the central government level are \nhandled by several line ministries, with overall coordination by several agencies such as the \nPrime Minister\u2019s Office, Ministry of Finance, Planning Commission, and Public Investment \nBoard. The Ministry of Surface Transport was reorganized in November 2000 into the Ministry of \nRoad Transport and Highways (MORTH) and Ministry of Shipping. MORTH\u2019s duties are to \ndevelop and maintain national highways (NHs), and formulate road transport policies. MORTH \ncoordinates state roads and issues guidelines on highway planning, design, and construction. \nThe Ministry of Shipping is responsible for major ports, inland waterway transport, and shipping. \nAll railway planning and operations are under the Ministry of Railways. The Ministry of Rural \nDevelopment is responsible for policy development, monitoring, and coordination of rural roads \nbeing funded by the Central Road Fund (CRF). Airports and civil aviation are under the \nresponsibility of the Ministry of Civil Aviation. \n \n3.  The responsibility for developing and maintaining the NH system rests with the central \nGovernment, while state and district roads are the responsibility of the state governments. To \nseparate its NH planning and operation functions, the Government established the National \nHighways  Authority  of  India  (NHAI)  in  1988.  However,  it  was  activated  only  in  1995.  Its \nresponsibilities include the Golden Quadrilateral, North-South and East-West Corridors, and \nseveral links to major ports and industrial centers. NHAI covers one fourth of the NH network, \nand MORTH is responsible for the rest, with state public works departments as its executing \nagencies. \n \n  2.  Road Network and Traffic \n \n4.  The road network is divided into NHs, state highways and major district roads, and rural \nroads  comprising  other  district  roads  and  village  roads.  The  national  and  state  highways \nfacilitate mobility between states and also between districts, while district and rural roads \nprovide the means to meet social needs and to transport agricultural produce to markets. The \nroad network grew 7.5 times, from 400,000 km in 1951 to 3.4 million km in 2001 (including \n230,000 km of urban roads and 1 million km of earth tracks to villages). Road density is now 1 \nkm/km2, which is  higher than in other developing countries, but road network quality and \ncapacity are grossly inadequate to meet present and future demand for freight and passenger \ntraffic and to connect all villages. \n \n5.  The NH network of 58,112 km carries about 40% of total road traffic. However, 33% of \nthis network is still single lane, 65% two lane, and only 2% four lane. Under the National \nHighway Development Program (NHDP) 1,400 km are planned to be upgraded to four lanes. ", " 28 Appendix 2   \n \n6.  From 1990 to 2000, annual passenger road transport grew at 7.8%, and freight transport \nby 7.6%, which was higher than the growth rate of the gross domestic product (GDP) of 6%.  \n \n3.   Sector Investment Plan \n \n7.  Capacity shortage of the NH systems has been a major problem. Out of a total network \nof 58,112 km, 39% is still single lane, 59% two lane, while four-lane highways, a desirable \nstandard for arterial national corridors, account for only 2%. Faced with this capacity shortage, \nthe Government set forth a major investment plan to improve the NH systems. Key areas of \ninvestment in the 10th Five-Year Plan (FYP, 2003\u20132007) are (i) widening of 22,000 km of two-\nlane roads to four-lane standard; (ii) construction of 2,000 km of expressways; (iii) widening of \n22,500  km  of  single-lane  roads  to  two-lane  standard;  (iv)  improvement  of  19,300  km  of \npavement; (v) construction of 1,200 km of access-controlled bypasses; and (vi) construction and \nrehabilitation of bridges. Total investment required to implement these programs is estimated at \n$37 billion. The program-by-program details are as follows: \n \nTable A2.1: Program Details \n \nCategory  Length  Estimated Amount \n($ million) \nWidening from single lane to 2 lanes   22,522 km    6,256 \nPavement strengthening of 2-lane roads   22,000 km    19,556 \nWidening from 2 lanes to 4 lane or 6 lanes   19,250 km    3,211 \nConstruction of expressways    2,000 km    3,211 \nConstruction of access-controlled bypasses  60 bypasses    2,000 \n(average 20 km of bypass at $5 million per km) \nConstruction of bridges  210 bridges    94 \nRehabilitation of bridges  425 bridges    71 \nMiscellaneous (missing links, road safety, etc.)   Lump sum    1,778 \n  Total        36,521 \nkm = kilometers. \nSource:  Asian Development Bank staff. \n \nThe 10th FYP represents a major uplift of NH development programs compared with those of \nthe 9th FYP (1997\u20132002), which had aimed to (i) widen 944 km of roads to four lanes; (ii) widen \n1,791 km of single-lane roads to two lanes; and (iii) improve 3,042 km of pavement.  \n \n8.  Because of the magnitude of investments required, the Government has placed highest \npriority on the National Highway Development Program (NHDP) to upgrade three key arterial \ncorridors in 10 years (1998-2007): (i) Golden Quadrilateral\u20146,000 km; (ii) North-South (N-S) \nCorridor\u20144,000 km; and (iii) East-West (E-W) Corridor\u20143,300 km. Total  program cost is \nestimated at $13 billion, on which the Government decides to allocate the central road funds on \na priority basis. NHDP is expected to connect the entire country. \n \n9.  In March 2003, the Government announced another program, comparable to NHDP in \nterms of the scale of investments ($8 billion) and length of corridors (10,000 km). The  High-\nDensity  Corridor  Program  aims  to  rehabilitate  and  widen  2.0-  and  1.5-lane  corridors  with \naverage daily traffic of more than 30,000 private car equivalent units. MORTH identified 38 \nHDCs qualified for the Program. It was intended to alleviate traffic congestion along these \ncorridors, which often have higher traffic density than those of NHDP. MORTH was designated ", "      Appendix 2        2 9  \nto be an executing agency. The Program will start this year and will be completed in 7 years \n(including 2 years of construction).  \n \n10.  As public sector funds are limited (i.e., central road funds will not be available for the \nProgram even after the NHDP completion in 2007 since the funds are already tied up for the \nnext 10 years in debt service on market borrowings for NHDP), the Government will resort to the \nprivate sector by adopting build-operate-transfer (BOT) schemes for HDC development. Given \nthe nature of HDCs (which have been used for decades as  non-toll roads), tolls cannot be \ncharged on a full cost recovery basis. For this reason, the Government provides a grant to cover \npart of construction costs to keep tolls at a level affordable for various groups, including local \ncommunities  (the  public-private  partnership  scheme).  Under  the  scheme,  prospective \ncontractors compete for toll concessions.  \n \n4.  Vehicle Fleet and Automobile Manufacturing \n \n11.  India  had  300,000  vehicles  in  1950/51,  and  around  53  million  in  2000/01.  Buses \naccounted for 1%; trucks, 5%; cars and jeeps, 13%; and motorcycles and scooters (two-\nwheelers), 71%. The rest were mostly auto-rickshaws (three-wheelers) and agricultural tractors. \nThe  number  of  automobiles  has  been  growing  at  approximately  9%  a  year,  and  heavy \ncommercial vehicles, at 7.5% over the last 10 years. \n \n12.  The automobile manufacturing industry has been regulated since independence. In \n1947, the Government declared that only indigenous firms operating according to an approved \nplan could manufacture motor vehicles. A vehicle-manufacturing industry was established using \ndomestic capital and little foreign technology transfer. Deregulation started with two-wheelers in \nthe mid-1980s, then passenger cars and commercial vehicles in the 1990s to encourage \nproduction of more fuel-efficient,  safer,  and  better-quality vehicles at reasonable prices. In \n2000/01, 4.75 million motor vehicles were manufactured, 155% over the 1992/93 level, due to \nthe unprecedented increase in manufacturing of two- and three-wheeler vehicles from 1.50 \nmillion to 3.96 million. \n \n  5.  Road Transport Services \n \na.  Road Freight Services \n \n13.  The private sector almost wholly operates road freight. The road freight service industry \nhas four tiers truck operators, brokers, truck owners, and truck drivers. Shippers usually contact \ntruck operators that provide trucking services themselves or use trucks provided by brokers. \nSince they have limited trucking fleets, these truck operators usually contact cargo brokers \nbased in  the regions from which cargoes originate. These brokers (usually individuals) then \ncontact truck owners (again, individuals) or truck drivers, who wait for cargoes at truck yards or \nalong highways. Truck yards are on city outskirts, and most are informal and surrounded by \nsmall buildings housing cargo brokers and small shops. \n \n14.  Trucking operations are small: 77% of truck operators have fleets of five trucks or less. \nMost are family businesses. Truck operators with fleets of more than 20 account for only 6%, \nand many use trucks owned by other people, partly to avoid coming under the Motor Transport \nWorkers Act, which allows truck drivers to work 8 hours per day at most. Large fleet operators \nhave a network of branches and a large market share: 12\u201315% of their business is handled by \ntheir own trucks, and the rest is provided by smaller truck operators or brokers.  \n ", " 30 Appendix 2   \n15.  The  fragmented  structure  of  the  trucking  industry  is  a  major  impediment  to  its \nmodernization. Since they often have limited capital resources, individual truck owners are not \nwilling to invest in high-performance trucks such as multi-axel trucks, but use poorly performing \nlow-priced trucks. Larger truck operators take advantage of these low-cost trucking services. \nAlthough still limited, changes have begun to take place in container-haulage operations in \nwhich multi-axel vehicles are becoming the norm.  \n \n16.  Market entry is not restricted. While the  Motor Vehicle Act requires prospective truck \noperators to obtain a permit, the regional transport authorities usually grant permits to all \napplicants. The real function of the permit system is to facilitate collection of state motor vehicle \ntaxes rather than to control trucking operations. Motor vehicle  taxes reportedly account for \nnearly 10% of state tax revenue. Freight rates are not regulated. Although the Motor Vehicle Act \ngrants the state government authority to set freight rates, it rarely does so as it believes that \nrates should be determined by the market.  \n \n17.  Competition  among  trucking  operators  is  intense  and  any  vehicle\u2019s  operating  cost \nsavings resulting from improved road conditions will mostly likely be passed on to the public. \n \nb.  Road Passenger Services \n \n18.  Main  operators  of  road  passenger  services  are  state  road  transport  undertakings \n(SRTUs), which serve villages, towns, and cities. Until the 1980s, SRTUs dominated passenger \ntransport service. However, their dominance has been declining due to the gradual introduction \nof competition policies announced by the Planning Commission. SRTUs owned 118,000 buses \nas of 31 March 2000, while private sector operators own 440,000 (based on vehicle registration \ndata). Active  in urban areas, these private sector operators  own smaller vehicles, including \ntricycles. \n \n19.  SRTUs\u2019  financial  performance  is  deteriorating,  with  large  deficits  being  registered \n(operating ratio is 77% for urban services, and 89% for rural and intercity services). Yet, central \nand local governments are increasingly reluctant to provide subsidies, which has led to fleet \ndeterioration.  \n \n20.  Passenger  services  are  under  economic  regulation  and  safety  and  environmental \nregulation. The former is implemented by state transport authorities, which regulate market \nentry by issuing operation licenses. Service requirements (e.g., scope of business operations) \nare stated in the operating permits. The authorities also regulate passenger service fares, which \ntend to be kept low due to political pressure.  \n \n21.  Regional transport authorities are responsible for safety and environmental regulations, \nand safety inspections for passenger transport vehicles, their registration, issuance of licenses \nto professional drivers and conductors, and inspection of emission gas. \n \n22.  Competition in the passenger transport service industry exists but is regulated. Since \nfares are regulated and  most SRTUs are in the red, the benefits of vehicle operating cost \nsavings are less likely to be passed on to the public  \n \n                                                 \n1 D.P. Gupta, a local consultant, provided the data. ", "      Appendix 2        3 1  \n  6.  Revenues/Expenditures and Road Fund \n \n23.  The central Government provides funds from yearly budgetary allocations to develop \nand maintain NHs, while state governments fund state highways and major district and rural \nroads. Transport investments have accounted for about 13% of total public sector spending \nunder the Government\u2019s 5-year plans.  \n \nTable A2.2: Five-Year Plan Expenditure in the Transport Sector \n(Rs billion) \n  VI Plan  VII Plan  VIII Plan  IX Plan \nSubsector  (1980-85)  (1985-90)  (1992-97)  (1997-2002)\nRailways  65.85  165.49  321.39    464.05 \nRoads  38.87  63.35  161.33    475.10 \nRoad Transport  12.76  21.51  36.34    59.33 \nPorts  7.25  15.13  24.91    53.31 \nShipping  4.68  7.20  47.26    29.67 \nInland Water Transport  0.63  1.88  1.54    2.80 \nCivil Aviation  9.57  19.48  75.04    69.58 \nOther Transport  \u2014  0.72  2.44    18.51 \nTotal Transport  139.61  294.76  670.25    1,172.35 \nTotal Public Sector   1,092.91  2,187.29  5,332.52    \u2014 \nTotal Transport as age to Pubic Sector   12.80  13.00  12.60    \u2014 \n\u2014 = not available. \nSource: Planning Commission, Government of India. \n \n24.  Road expenditure increased 11 times, from Rs39 billion in the Sixth FYP (1980\u20131985) to \nRs475 billion in the Ninth FYP (1997\u20132002). The transport budget allocation increased about 7 \ntimes in the same period. The road sector\u2019s share of total transport investment also increased \nfrom about 28% in the Sixth FYP to about 40% in the Ninth FYP, reflecting government \ncommitment to improve highway infrastructure to meet the demands of the growing economy \nand help reduce poverty. \n \n25.  A central road fund had existed for years. The central Government revamped it through \ncess (excise duties) of  Rs1  per  liter  of  petrol  (1998)  and  diesel  (1999,  through  the  CRF \nOrdinance). To institutionalize the revamped CRF, Parliament passed the CRF Act in November \n2000. Another increase of  Rs0.50 per liter of petrol and diesel (50% increase in cess) was \neffected on 28 February 2003. These cess are expected to raise Rs90 billion ($1.8 billion) per \nannum. According to the allocation formula, and assuming Rs15.0 billion is raised from petrol \nand Rs75.0 billion from  diesel, approximately Rs37.5 billion will be allocated for rural roads, \nRs30.0 billion for NHs, Rs16.0 billion for state highways and major district roads, and Rs6.5 \nbillion for railway crossings and other purposes. Unlike a typical road fund, which is primarily \nused for maintenance, CRF will be used mainly to develop the road network. In the case of state \nhighways and major district roads, however, a portion may be spent on removing maintenance \nbacklog and rehabilitating badly deteriorated roads. \n   \n7.   Maintenance \n \n26.  NH network maintenance has been neglected due to inadequate fund allocation. The \nNinth FYP doubled the allocation for maintenance, but the maintenance shortfall in FY2000 \nremained at practically the same level (50%) in FY2002. MORTH  dealt with this shortfall by \nimproving riding quality. \n \n27.  NHAI maintains its NHs primarily through a private contractor (and occasionally by \nitself). Maintenance cost has been covered by budgetary support from the central Government. ", " 32 Appendix 2   \nFaced with rapid expansion of its road network, NHAI decided to explore the possibility of \nintroducing asset management to maintain and manage its road network more systematically. \nNHAI commissioned a study under World Bank funding to develop the concept of the corridor \nmanagement units (CMUs). A key element of the CMU concept is to operate and maintain the \nroad network by contracting out to private contractors. A CMU also ensures the integrity of the \nright  of  way  by  maintaining  fences  and  markers,  controlling  overloading of trucks, taking \naccident-prevention measures, removing obstacles on roads, controlling emission, and keeping \nnoise within acceptable limits. With the recent completion of the study, two pilot CMUs will be \nestablished under the Third National Highway Project financed by the World Bank. \n \n28.  NHAI\u2019s policy is to contract out operation and maintenance (O&M) as much as possible \nto the private sector. Under the Surat-Manor and Western Transport projects, advisory services \nwill be provided to develop performance-based O&M agreements with the private sector. \n \n8.  Environmental Issues \n \n29.  Since  1991,  the  Government  has  gradually  intensified  its  control  over  vehicle  gas \nemission. First-stage control was introduced for petrol-powered vehicles in 1991, and for diesel-\npowered vehicles in 1992. The Bharat stage-1 emission standards, which are akin to Euro-1 \nstandards, have been effective throughout the country since 2000. The Government plans to \nintroduce tougher standards, corresponding to Euro-2 requirements, for passenger cars and \ncommercial vehicles. Bharat stage-2 standards, which are close to Euro-2 standards, have been \nin force in the National Capital Region and are intended to be enforced shortly throughout the \ncountry. Leaded fuel has been gradually phased out from metropolitan cities since 1998 with the \nintroduction of unleaded fuel. Now petrol fuel is fully unleaded all over the country. Benzene in \npetrol has also been reduced to 3% all over the country and to 1% in Delhi. Since December \n1998 commercial vehicles over 15 years old have been banned from Delhi\u2019s center. \n \n30.  The  ADB  has  been  working  with  the  Government  to  solve  road  sector-related \nenvironmental  problems  by  preventing  environmental  degradation  during construction and \noperation of highways, for example, and controlling urban traffic pollution. An ADB technical \nassistance2 on environmental management prepared highway project guidelines. They are now \nused on all highway improvement and reconstruction projects in India. ADB\u2019s Second Road \nProject3 studied measures to control traffic pollution in urban areas. The Central Pollution \nControl Board then updated its mass emission regulations and enforced them more stringently.  \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 1993.

Economic Analysis \n \n4.  The economic analysis was conducted for section C\u2014the core section representing \ntypical project roads. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the core section was \ncalculated on the basis of incremental economic costs and benefits resulting from the Project \nover an assumed period of 30 years and a residual value proportional to the estimated remaining \neconomic life. Economic costs and benefits are expressed in 2003 constant prices. \n \n1.  Costs \n \n5.  The  economic  costs  of  implementing  the  Project  are  based  on  the  financial  cost \nestimates,  and  include  civil  works;  environmental  improvement  works;  land  acquisition, \nrelocation of utilities, and resettlement costs; and construction supervision. Costs related to the \nprevention of HIV/AIDS1 and human trafficking, and road safety components; taxes and duties;2 \nand financing charges, including interest during construction, have been excluded. Nontradables. \nprimarily unskilled labor costs and domestically produced materials, have been adjusted to use a \nconversion factor of 0.90. \n \n6.  The  incremental  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  were  calculated  as  the \ndifference between maintenance requirements for the proposed new four-lane highway and the \nexisting  two-lane  highway.  In  the  with-project  scenario,  the  new  road  will  require  routine \nmaintenance as well as periodical surface renewal (every 5 years) and a periodical structural \noverlay (every 20 years). In the without-project scenario, the existing road will require routine \nmaintenance and periodical surface renewal only. \n \n2.  Benefits \n \n7.  In the with-project scenario, the upgraded four-lane highway will allow improved traffic \nflow, higher vehicle speeds, and shorter travel time, all resulting in lower vehicle operating costs \n(VOCs). Economic benefits estimated include: VOC savings (as a result of better roads and \nincreased vehicle operating speeds) for normal traffic,3 and time savings for cargo transport. \nEconomic  benefits  anticipated  from  savings  in  passenger  travel  time,  and  reduced  traffic \naccidents, have not been included as such savings are difficult to estimate.  \n \n8.  Utilizing the highway design and maintenance 4 (HDM4) model, version 1.3, VOC and \ntime  savings  for  cargo  transport  were  calculated  for  a  range  of  vehicle  types  and  road \ncharacteristics. Vehicle types include motorized vehicles (two wheeler, small car, medium-sized \ncar,  minibus,  bus,  light  truck,  medium-sized truck, heavy truck, and articulated truck) and \nnonmotorized vehicles (cycle, rickshaw, and animal cart). Operating cost estimates assume \nlocal driving habits, and local vehicle and road conditions. Decreases in cargo delivery times \nwere estimated by type of cargo vehicle.  \n \n3.  Economic Internal Rate of Return \n \n9.  An economic evaluation was undertaken for the core section, and annual cost-and-\nbenefit streams are summarized in Table A8.4. The EIRR of the core section is calculated at \n22.9%.  \n                                                                 \n1  Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n2  Value-added taxes, customs, and duties are roughly estimated to equal 10% of the base cost. \n3  Normal traffic refers to projected traffic in the road corridor that will occur  in both with- and without- project \nscenarios. Generated traffic was not included because of lack of reliable information.

Based on the sensitivity indicator, the \nProject is determined to be most sensitive to a decrease in estimated benefits. In the most \nadverse  situation\u2014a  simultaneous  increase  of  20%  in  project  costs  (capital  and  O&M),  a \nreduction of 20% in project benefits, and a delay in the project completion by 2 years\u2014the overall \nEIRR is estimated at 16.2%.  \nTable A8.5: Sensitivity Analysis \nScenario  EIRR  Sensitivity Indicator \n(%) \n1  Base case    22.9    0.00 \n2  Increase in Project Capital Costs by 20%    20.4    0.55 \n3  Increase in Project O&M Costs by 20%    22.8    0.02 \n4  Decrease in Project Benefits by 20% a    19.8    0.68 \n5  Delay in Project Completion by 2 years    20.5    0.00 \n6  Combination of Cases 2, 3, 4, and 5    16.2    0.00 \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, O&M = operation and maintenance. \na The decrease in the benefits by 20% reflects the reduction in the traffic volume due to toll imposition. \nSource: Asian Development Bank staff. \n \n11.  Major  assumptions  adopted  for  the  economic  assessment  were  summarized  in \nSupplemental Appendix E-3.  \n \nD.  Financial Analysis   \n \n12.  The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) of the core section was calculated on the basis \nof incremental financial costs and benefits resulting from the Project over an assumed period of \n30 years with a residual value proportional to the estimated remaining economic life. Financial \ncosts and benefits are presented in 2003 constant prices.  \n \n1.  Costs \n \n13.  Project costs are comprised of capital costs and O&M costs. Capital costs include: civil \nworks;  environmental  improvement  works;  land  acquisition,  relocation  of  utilities  and \nresettlement costs; construction supervision; and taxes and duties. Capital costs are to be \nincurred over 36 months starting in 2004 and ending in 2007. O&M costs include annual routine \nmaintenance (estimated at Rs150,000 per km and periodic maintenance undertaken every five \nyears (estimated at Rs5 million per km) and 20 years (estimated at Rs20 million per km and \nimplemented over 2 years).4  \n \n2.  Benefits \n \n14.  Toll revenues are based on the traffic levels and traffic growth rates presented in Tables \nA8.2 and A8.3 and have been projected at 2003 constant prices5\u2014Rs0.55 per km for cars, \nRs0.96 for LCVs and minibuses, and Rs1.92 for trucks and large buses,6 assuming a capture \nratio of 75%. \n                                                                 \n4  Total O&M costs are roughly equal to 2.2% of capital cost per kilometer. \n5  Toll rates are assumed to be relatively inelastic given the general absence of easily accessible alternative roads \nand the small proportional cost of the toll compared to the total cost of vehicle O&M. \n6  2004 toll rates will be based on 1997 approved toll levels, annually indexed for inflation (by an inflation rate that \nis estimated at 4.65%).  ", "                     Appendix 8           43\n   \n3.  FIRR \n \n15.  Based on the above assumptions, the FIRR for the core section is calculated at 6.8%, \ngreater than NHAI\u2019s marginal weighted average cost of capital (WACC) in real terms estimated \nat 4.2%. NHAI\u2019s marginal WACC was estimated on the basis of the following assumptions: (i) \n88% government funding (of which 40% is from cess and 48% grants) at 7%;7(ii) 12% long-term \ndebt at 11%;8 (iii) domestic inflation of 5%, and NHAI\u2019s application for tax-exempt status is \napproved. \n \n16.  Several tests were undertaken to determine the sensitivity of the FIRR to changes in toll \nlevels, traffic capture ratio, traffic volume and traffic volume growth rate, O&M costs, and delayed \nproject completion. A sensitivity analysis was conducted for the case of 20% less traffic due to \ntoll introduction. FIRR is 5.2%, greater than NHAI\u2019s marginal WACC in real terms estimated at \n4.2%. The FIRR is most sensitive to reductions in tariff level and traffic assumptions and less \nsensitive to changes in O&M costs and delays in project completion. Verification and appropriate \nmodeling of traffic assumptions, and development and implementation of an appropriate toll \nstrategy will be critical to ensure the Project\u2019s financial viability and sustainability. \n \n17.  Major assumptions adopted for the financial assessment are in Supplementary Appendix \nE-3. \n \nE.  Poverty Impact Assessment   \n \n18.  The core project area has an estimated population of 605,792, with 200,737 living below \nthe poverty line. The potential poverty penetration ratio is, therefore, above 33%.9 With project \nroad improvements, anticipated VOC savings in passenger (bus) and freight (truck) transport in \na competitive environment will translate to decreased transport costs for the poor. \n \n19.  The poor account for about 80% of passenger traffic but only about 40% of freight \ntraffic.10 Along the core road bus traffic makes up about 20% of traffic volume, and truck traffic, \n70%. The estimated poverty economic impact ratio is 1.95, indicating that the total net economic \nbenefits reaching the poor as a result of the project are likely to be substantial.  \n \n20.  Extending the poverty impact analysis to the entire East-West Corridor increases the \npopulation living in project area to 3 million, of whom approximately 876,000 live below the \npoverty line. The potential poverty penetration ratio for the entire route remains at 29%, with an \nestimated poverty impact ratio of 2.0211 for the entire route. The potential poverty penetration \nratio and the estimated poverty economic impact ratios strongly indicate that the Project will \nhave a positive impact on the area\u2019s poor. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                 \n7  Approximately equal to a 10-year Treasury Bond rate (institutional sales only) and 5-year Triple-A Corporate Bond \nrate (publicly traded). \n8  Assuming that 200,737 are considered to be below the poverty line. \n9  Assuming that 200,737 are considered to be below the poverty line.  \n10 NHAI. 2003.

Country Poverty Partnership Agreement?  \n \n \nContribution of the sector to poverty reduction:  \n \nThe Government has highly prioritized improvement of the national highway (NH) system to develop the \neconomy  and  contribute  to  overall  poverty  reduction.  The  absence  of  adequate  road  infrastructure, \nincluding  connectivity  between  states,  has  long  been  considered  an  impediment  to  development, \nparticularly for transport of goods between states. Road, rail, and inland waterway development are all \nconsidered to be integral to inter- and intrastate development. Infrastructure development encourages \nother development initiatives, which together considerably stimulate economic growth. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Proposed Classification: Other \n \nThe sector loan covers a total distance of 662 kilometers (km), rehabilitating and widening an east-west \nlinkage  from  Rajasthan  to  Uttar  Pradesh.  The  core  project  covers  a  distance  of  131  km  from  the \nRajasthan-Madhya Pradesh border to Uttar Pradesh. \n \nThe main objective of the Project is to connect the eastern and western ends of India via better road \nnetworks. Although not designed as a poverty intervention project, the Project will, by virtue of passing \nthrough the countryside where a large percentage of the population lives below the poverty line, help \nreduce  poverty  by  encouraging  human  development  and  economic  growth.  Better  connectivity  with \nmainstream economic regions will also help reduce regional disparities among fast-growing and backward \nstates such as those in the northeast.  \n \nProject roads are mostly two lanes and, in some parts, single lane. Due to disrepair, a road may remain \nflooded during the monsoon season for up to  4 months which increases people\u2019s hardship and loss of \nworkdays by the poorest. Poverty levels in Madhya Pradesh  and Uttar Pradesh  are 37%  and  31% \nrespectively,  significantly  higher  than  for  India\u2019s  average  of  26.1%.  The  project  region  is  on  the \nBundelkhand plateau, which has little or no productive land and low rainfall. More than three fourths of the \nProject is in Madhya Pradesh, with only 20 km in Jhansi district in Uttar Pradesh. The proposed road \nimprovement passes through 51 rural settlements and 3 urban areas. In Madhya Pradesh, life expectancy \nis 44 years at birth as opposed to the national average of 61, infant mortality rate is 125 compared to 68, \nand less than 10% of houses have access to safe drinking water compared to 62%. \n \nRecent persistent drought has forced migration of productive labor and encouraged human trafficking and \nthe commercial sex trade in vulnerable sections along the corridor. A separate HIV/AIDS prevention and \nanti-trafficking program will be implemented under the Project. Scheduled tribes in the interior have taken \nto a nomadic lifestyle, moving and settling along the road, seeking jobs.  Average landholding is 2.5 \nhectares, most of it unirrigated, and landless families predominate.  \n \nAn estimated 600,000 people reside within the corridor of influence, of whom about 200,000 are below the \npoverty line. The estimated annual per capita income of those living below the poverty line is less than \n$100, in each of the three states, reflecting an average daily income of about $0.30.

Their rural populations are widely dispersed, making road connectivity a particularly critical factor \nfor those seeking economic opportunities and social services.1 However, neglect of the road network \noverall has also hampered rural mobility in all three states. \n \nStudies conducted during preparation of the recently approved Madhya Pradesh State Road Sector \nDevelopment Project of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for example, found that outdated institutional \narrangements had led to most of the state road sector budget being spent on personnel instead of \nmaintaining and developing the roads. Road connectivity is very poor, estimated at 22% in Madhya \nPradesh\u2014one  of  the  lowest  of  all  the  states.  The  ADB-financed  Madhya  Pradesh road project will \nrehabilitate about 1,750 km of state highways and rural connector roads identified as significant road \ncorridors.  The  focus  on  rural  and  state  roads  to  develop internal and interstate connectivity, and \nimprovement of national highways to enhance interstate connectivity will contribute to the overall  well \nbeing of the local population. The proposed India rural road sector project, through provision of all-weather \nroad connectivity, is expected to directly benefit some 71,127 rural villages in Madhya Pradesh and \nChhattisgarh. Finally, the cost of travel is also considered high, especially for those living below the \npoverty line. The minimum fare of Rs10, by local bus, is close to a full day\u2019s income for persons in this \ngroup, with the freight rate at 90 rupees/quintal, equivalent to 3 days' work. Nonetheless, about 80% of the \npassenger and about 50% of freight traffic come from this group. Table A9.2 indicates rural access roads \nwithin the project corridor.  \n \nTable A9.2: Rural Access Roads \nProject Corridor  No. of Roads \n   Left    Right \nNH-25    11    33 \nNH-3      8    10 \nNH-76    14    18 \nTotal    33    61 \n            NH = national highway. \n \nRoad  development  offers  opportunities  for  development  to  be  brought  to  the  region  and  for  local \ncommunities to move in and out of the region, fostering the pull and push of economic development. In the \nimmediate project influence areas, development opportunities are supported by providing people with \naccess to economic opportunities, links to better-priced markets, jobs, and better-quality social and other \npublic services, as well as short-term project-related employment. Equally important is the fact that the \nProject will have indirect impacts on poverty reduction by improving transport efficiency and outreach, thus \nincreasing incomes and jobs; and also generating higher tax revenues to support the state governments\u2019 \nprograms for economic growth, poverty reduction, and human development. Some of the mechanisms \nthrough which the Project may be expected to contribute to  poverty reduction include (i) growth in \n                                                 \n1  In 2001, the population density of Rajasthan was 165/square kilometer (km2) and that of Madhya Pradesh 195/km2, \ncompared with 324/km2 nationally.  ", "      Appendix 9 47\n      \nagricultural  incomes  due  to  access  to  higher-priced  markets,  ability  for  the  first  time  to  transport \nhorticultural  and  other  high-value  produce  to  market,  and  reduced  spoilage;  (ii)  growth  of  the  local \neconomy, leading to increased incomes and jobs; (iii) ability to travel to work outside the community; (iv) \nreduction in prices of consumer goods and services due to lower transport cost; (v) improved health and \nlongevity due to improved access to hospitals and health services (particularly for births); (vi) improved \neducation due to improved access to schools (including post-primary schooling), improved capacity to \nattract qualified school teachers, and more frequent supervision visits by school inspectors; (vii) improved \naccess to agricultural, veterinary, and other extension services; and (viii) improved opportunities for \nparticipation in the wider society outside the villages. \n \nConsiderable potential for tourism also exists in Madhav National Park, King George Castle, Survaya \nFortress (with its palace and temples), Jhansi Fort and Museum, and Rocha Fort complex (with its three \npalaces and sacred pilgrim sites).  \n \nImproving roads; rationalizing congested areas with junctions, truck stops, and lay-bys, improving traffic \nflow;  and  providing  service  roads  in  congested  locations  will  bring  immediate  benefits  to  roadside \ncommunities and non-motorized road users. \n \nThe project beneficiaries will include the rural population of the two states: (i) direct users of road \ntransport,  including  owners  and  operators  of  buses  and  trucks,  passengers  of  the  various  vehicle \ncategories, labor, and the Government; (ii) those benefiting indirectly because they live in the roads\u2019 area \nof influence; and (iii) those benefiting indirectly through the wider impacts of higher economic growth in \ntheir districts and in the states as a whole. Some expected positive impacts include the following: \n \n(i)  Agricultural diversification  often  rapidly  follows  provision  of  all-weather  road  access  to  district \nmarkets, potentially increasing incomes of farmers. Milk and vegetable production can potentially increase \nannual incomes of marginal farmers by Rs4,000\u2013Rs8,000 a year or more, of small farmers by Rs20,000 or \nmore, and farmers with medium-sized or large holdings by Rs50,000 or more. Increased nonagricultural \ninvestment mainly by the nonpoor is also likely in enterprises ranging from small shops and service \nbusinesses to transport enterprises. \n \n(ii) Social service delivery, access, and improved social status of the villages is another positive \nimpact resulting from road connectivity with increased attendance by teachers, health personnel, and more \nfrequent supplies for various government poverty relief programs. Access to social services beyond the \nvillage tends to improve as well because better transportation services make distant services accessible \ndaily the whole year round. Attendance at middle and high schools outside the village also increases. \nSurveys of all groups, including the poorest, indicate significant benefits resulting from road upgrading, in \nparticular by increasing the social status of the village and the families living there. \n \n(iii)  Gender  impacts  are  positive,  with  improved  connectivity  and  transportation,  which  enhances \nconditions and opportunities to raise the social, educational, and health status of girls and women, and \nimprove conditions for safe motherhood. More girls are likely to be sent to high school outside the village \nwhen transport services are improved, and generally women have been found to benefit from more \nfrequent contact with their families in distant locations. \n \n(iv) Poverty reduction results from provision of upgraded all-weather roads in recent years, (specifically in \nMadhya Pradesh. Control studies confirmed that such projects decrease poverty by removing economic \nand  social  development  barriers  created  by  isolation.  Some  landless  households  benefited  from \nopportunities to invest in raising cows and operate roadside stalls. Lower passenger fares and freight rates \nimproved social and economic prospects, and increased economic opportunities to participate in civil \nworks during construction. \n \n \n \n ", "48   Appendix 9 \nC.

The National Highway Corridor (Sector) I Project will widen and improve 653 kilometers \n(km)of two-lane highways to four lanes under the East-West (E-W) Corridor development \nprogram of the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI). The Project includes priority sections \nof the E-W Corridor in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh.

The packages have been classified into (i) a core subproject to be appraised by Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB); and (ii) non-core subprojects, including private sector investment, to \nbe prepared, screened, appraised by NHAI before submission to ADB for approval under the \nsector lending approach. Package C (Rajasthan/Madhya Pradesh border to Jhansi\u2014132 km) \nhas been selected as the core subproject for loan processing.  \n \n3.  NHAI is the Executing Agency of the Project. NHAI prepared a draft resettlement plan for \nthe core subproject (i.e., package C) in June 2003. The resettlement plan has been revised \nbased on new data on land acquisition and structure surveys, with particular attention to impacts \non farm families and tenant households caused by the Shivpuri bypass. For non-core projects, a \nresettlement framework, based on ADB policy guidelines, has been approved by NHAI for \nresettlement plan preparation.  \n \nB.  Package C\u2014Project Impacts \n4.  Package C consists of three sections and will improve and upgrade 131 km of highways \n(National Highway (NH) 76, and NH25) from Shivpuri to Jhansi (Table A10.2). Improvement \nactivities include widening the 3 stretch to four lanes, and improving junctions, underpasses, a \nfly-over,  and  a  major  bypass  to  avoid  urban  settlements  and  congestion.  The  four-lane \ncarriageway is designed for an average of 100 km/hour.  \n \n ", "50   Appendix 10 \nTable A10.2: Package-C Roads \n  \nRoad  Roads  Length \nSection  (km) \nSection 1  NH 76, km 579\u2013km 609 MP Border (includes Shivpuri bypass)  55  \nSection 2  km 15\u2013km 40 (includes Sind River Bridge \u2013 new approach)   26  \nSection 3  km 40\u2013km 92 (includes River Mahuar Bridge \u2013 new approach)  52  \n  km = kilometers, MP = Madhya Pradesh, NH = national highway. \n  Source: Asian Development Bank staff. \n \n5.  The existing right of way (ROW) of the NHs varies from 30 to 50 meters (m). Widening to \nfour  lanes  will  require  additional  land  in  several  sections  beyond  the  existing  ROW. \nImprovements will be confined to 45 m in built-up areas and 60 m in case of the new bypass. \nThe Project area traverses 25 villages and settlements, including the Shivpuri bypass. A major \npart of the Project is within Shivpuri, Madhya Pradesh, while few settlements along NH25 are \nwithin Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh, bordering the Jhansi Development Authority Area.  \n \n6.  The construction of the project highway sections will require acquisition of an estimated \n332 hectares (Table A10.3). The bulk of land acquisition will be for section 1, particularly for the \nShivpuri bypass, involving forest, revenue/government, and privately owned agricultural land at \nthe two approach ends. Efforts have been made to minimize land acquisition and reduce \nresettlement impacts as much as possible by (i) keeping ROW to 45 m in built-up areas; (ii) \nadopting concentric symmetrical widening; (iii) raising carriageway over congested segments, \nand (iv) building bypasses to avoid congested urban settlements. Further efforts to minimize \nproject impacts will be made during final design and project implementation.  \n \nTable A10.3: Land Acquisition by Road Sections \n \nRoad  Road  Area in ha \nSection \nSection 1  NH76\u2013Km 579 to 609 and Shivpuri bypass  194.84 \nSection 2  NH 25\u2013Km 14 to 40 (includes Sind Bridge)  45.71 \nSection 3  NH 25\u2013Km 40 to 92 (includes Mahuar)  90.91 \nrealignment)  \nTotal    331.46  \n  ha = hectares, NH = national highway. \n  Source:  Asian Development Bank staff. \n \n7.  A complete enumeration of all structures within the 45 m ROW was conducted in two \nphases in April-May and early June 2003, to assess the loss of assets and the number of \naffected farm families/households and shops/businesses. Table A10.4 provides detailed data of \nthe project impacts on roadside shops/businesses and village settlements. A total of 859 \nstructures (residential/commercial) will require demolition, affecting some 5,154 people. Road \nwidening and improvements will also affect 45 religious/community structures. Plot acquisition \nsurvey data have been collected to assess the project impact on households affected by the \nloss  of  agricultural  land.  In  all,  the  Project  will  affect  17,470  people  (2,915  households), \nincluding those affected by loss of agricultural plots but not required to move.  \n \n \n ", "                                                                                                                                     Appendix 10      51\nTableA10. 4: Type and Loss of Structures \n \nDistrict  Type of  Residential  Residential/  Commercial  Total  Total APs  \nStructure  Commercial  Structures \n  Permanent  55  73  105  233  1,398 \nShivpuri  Temporary  6  5  9  20  120 \nSemi- 29  26  25  80  480 \nPermanent \n Subtotal  90  104  139  333  1,998 \n  Permanent  2  5  1  8  48 \nDatia  Temporary  1  1  1  3  18 \nSemi- 1  2  1  4  24 \nPermanent \nSubtotal  4  8  3  15  90 \n  Permanent  142  102  91  335  2,010 \nJhansi  Temporary  9  18  19  46  276 \nSemi  38  57  35  130  780 \nPermanent \nSubtotal  189  177  145  511  3,066 \n    Total  283  289  287  859  5,154 \nSource:  Asian Development Bank staff. \n \n8.  Roadside shops/businesses will experience the most impact and be required to relocate. \nPeople  will  lose  (i)  residential  and  commercial  structures,  (ii)  community  structures,  (iii) \nbusiness/employment,  (iv)  homestead  and  agricultural  land,  (v)  crops,  and  (vi)  livelihood \nsources. Nearly 70% of the structures are  pucca (brick and cement) and the rest are semi-\npucca and kuccha. About 40% of the structure users (particularly of shops) are tenants. Based \non the estimated incomes from all sources, about 15% of the households are below the poverty \nline.  \n \n9.  A detailed field survey assessed  the socioeconomic status of indigenous people and \ntheir livelihood sources. The most numerous scheduled tribes of the project area are the Bhil \nand Saharia in Shivpuri district, while a small number of Bhotiya inhabit Jhansi. Other important \ntribes in the region include the Agariya, Korku, Sonar, and Gond. Among the indigenous/tribal \ngroups, the Saharia are more visible. Socioeconomic and occupational/income data clearly \nsuggest that the project-affected. Scheduled tribes (STs) are similar to the overall affected \npopulation and are largely assimilated into the local mainstream communities.  \n \n10.  Only 13 tribal households/shop owners are likely to be affected over the 132 km stretch \nof the highway. Survey data confirmed that they have the same general pattern of activity as \nnon-tribals. For example, 58% of tribals are involved in agriculture as cultivators and laborers. \nSome combine agriculture with small business while about 15% derive their livelihood solely \nfrom trade and non-farm activities. Few depend on forest products. ST and non-ST populations \nboth  view  the  highway  project  as  beneficial  as  it  will  likely  generate  more  business  and \neconomic opportunities. The improved transportation and connectivity will increase jobs.  \n \n11.  Affected  ST  populations  engage  in  economic  activities  that  are  strongly  tied  to \nmainstream ones and will unlikely be affected differently than non-tribals. A separate Indigenous \nPeople Development Plan (IPDP) for the STs, therefore, is not needed. However, given their \nhigher incidence of poverty (about 40%), scheduled tribes and other vulnerable groups will need \nadditional  assistance.  The  revised  resettlement  plan  emphasized  ST  issues,  with  special \nattention to livelihood and income restoration, including a separate program, for STs and \nvulnerable groups. \n ", "52   Appendix 10 \nC.  Resettlement Principles and Entitlement Matrix \n \n12.  The resettlement principles and entitlements are derived from the National Highways Act \n(1956) and ADB\u2019s policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995) and other safeguard policies. The \nprinciples establish eligibility and provisions for all types of losses (land, crops/trees, structures, \nbusiness/employment,  and  workdays/wages).  For  example,  affected  people  will  be \ncompensated fully to replace all lost assets. Besides payments by district collectors, affected \npersons (APs) will receive additional grants to match replacement costs for lost assets (land and \nhouses),  transaction  costs  such  as  stamps/registration  costs  (in  case  of  purchase  of \nreplacement  land),  and  other  cash  grants  and  resettlement  assistance  such  as  shifting \nallowance and compensation for loss of workdays/income due to dislocation. Female-headed \nhouseholds and other vulnerable households will be eligible for further cash assistance for \nrelocation and house reconstruction. Table A10.5 outlines the entitlement in the form of a \nmatrix.  It  incorporates  some  lessons  from  ongoing  NHAI  projects,  particularly  in  income \nrestoration and other livelihood/training programs for economic rehabilitation of affected people, \nparticularly those below the poverty line. \n \n13.  Resettlement sites for relocation of shops/business and affected households have been \nidentified in consultation with APs and local administration. The sites are close to the existing \nsettlements, which will minimize disruption during relocation. APs will be given several options \nfor  relocation,  including  additional  assistance.  The  sites  for  residential  dwellers  will  be \ndeveloped  with  basic  amenities  (e.g.,  internal  roads,  sanitary/water  supply,  community \ninfrastructures, etc.). Households affected by land acquisition have expressed their desire for \nself-relocation. In addition to compensation for lost assets, families requiring relocation will \nreceive shifting allowances for resettlement and income restoration support. \n \nD.  Stakeholder Participation, Disclosure of Resettlement Plan, and Grievances \n \n14.  At various stages of project planning, affected people have been informed and consulted \nabout  the  likely  project  impacts.  Stakeholders  consulted  include  (i)  heads  of \nhouseholds/businesses  to  be  affected;  (ii)  affected  people  in  small  groups;  (iii)  village \npanchayat, sarpanch, and members; (iv) local voluntary organizations and nongovernment \norganizations; (v) government agencies and departments; and (vi) women and other vulnerable \ngroups. A consultation plan to disseminate information and involve APs and host populations \nhas been adopted.  \n \n15.  The draft resettlement plan was disclosed among APs and other stakeholders at the \nproject site in June 2003. The adequacy of the entitlement and mitigation policies were reviewed \nand  discussed  by  project  officials.  Stakeholders\u2019  comments  have  been  used  to  minimize \nimpacts through alternative options/road realignments and improvements in the policy and \nentitlement matrix. The project director (NHAI-Kota) responsible for project preparation at the \nfield level will conduct an IEC in mid-September in Shivpuri to further disseminate information \non the project.  \n \n16.  APs will be involved in resolving any dispute or grievance with regard to resettlement \nplan implementation and benefits. The grievance resolution committee will comprise the project \ndirector (NHAI); district commissioner or his or her representative; representatives of affected \npeople (male and females); local government/panchayat representative; resettlement officer for \nthe project section (NHAI); local land acquisition officer; and NGO representative implementing \nthe resettlement plan. GRC claims will be reviewed and resolved within 3 weeks from the date \nof submission to the local committee. \n \n ", "                                                                                                                                     Appendix 10      53\nE.  Implementation Framework and Budget \n \n17.  The environmental and social development unit (ESDU) of NHAI will implement and \nsupervise  the  resettlement  plan.  NHAI  will  engage  qualified  and  experienced  NGOs  to \nimplement the resettlement plan. They will play an important role in the information campaign on \nresettlement plan policies/entitlements, disbursement of compensation packages as described \nin the matrix, ensure redressal of legitimate grievances by APs, and pay special attention to \nvulnerable groups. \n \n18.  For effective management of resettlement and to further strengthen ESDU, NHAI will \nsoon engage a manager for resettlement. In addition, as indicated by NHAI ESDU will engage \ntwo  long-term  staff  consultants  form  its  own  funds\u2014one  for  resettlement  and  one  for \nenvironment\u2014to enhance its capacity for management and operations. For future projects, \nNHAI has agreed to engage consultants for resettlement planning separately from detailed \nproject report/engineering consultants. This will more closely involve ESDU staff in planning of \nresettlement and supervision of consultants in resettlement plan development.  \n \n19.   A resettlement unit will be established within the project implementation unit (PIU) for \nproject-level resettlement plan implementation. The project director of the PIU will head the \nresettlement unit. A full-time NHAI officer will be in charge of resettlement and rehabilitation \n(R&R), including supervision of the NGO work in the field. The resettlement consultant of the \nproject technical team will provide technical support to the PIU and the R&R officer in terms of \ncoordination and supervision of NGO work in the field as well as help all committees at the \ndistrict level resolve resettlement issues. NHAI will conduct a short training program for R&R \nofficers before project implementation.  \n \n20.  The  total  budget  for  R&R  is  Rs379.65  million,  including  cost  for  land  acquisition, \nresettlement/income restoration, and other administrative/logistic costs, including monitoring \nand evaluation. Resettlement, including land acquisition, will take 36 months. Compensation for \nacquired assets will be paid before construction. The resettlement site will be provided before \nrelocation. Social development and income restoration will be based on needs assessment and \nconsultation with beneficiary groups. The budget provides for separate provisions for income \nrestoration activities and assistance to vulnerable groups.  \n \nF.   Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n21.  The resettlement plan will have internal and external monitoring. Methods are specified \nin the resettlement plan. Internal monitoring will be done by the PIU-ESDU.  It  will  monitor \ncompliance  with  the  principles  and  matrix  set  out  in  the  resettlement  plan,  payment  of \ncompensation,  compensation  record,  completion  of  compensation  before  construction,  job \ncreation, information dissemination, and settling of GRC grievances.  \n \n22.  Independent monitoring, including a major midterm review, will be carried out annually \nby a suitably qualified external expert/agency to be hired by NHAI with ADB concurrence. The \nexternal monitor will be selected within 3 months of loan approval. The monitoring findings will \nbe shared in the form of reports to NHAI and ADB. NHAI will follow up on the monitoring reports \nby the external monitoring experts. \n ", "54    Appendix 10 \nTable A10.5: Detailed Entitlement Matrix \n \n5\nS.No  Category  Type of  Unit of  Entitlement  Details  4\n1A  PPrriovpaetert y  LAlaognsrdisc au nltudr al   TEitnletihtloeldmeern t  C\u201creopmlapceenmsaetniot n at  1.   mIf othree  trheapnla tcheem ceonmt pceonsst a(dtieotne,r amsi ndeedte arms pineerd p bayra t.h 5e. 7c.o1m opf ethteen pt oaluicthyo frraitym, ethweonr kth) eis             A\nassets  cost\u201d or \u201cactual  difference is to be paid by the project in the form of \u201cassistance.\u201d  p\np\nmarket value\u201d  2.
