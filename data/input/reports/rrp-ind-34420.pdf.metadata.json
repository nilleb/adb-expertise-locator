The \nsummary IEE was circulated to the Board on 4 August 2003.  \n \nTo solve chronic capacity shortage of national highways (NHs) and \nupgrade  key  arterial  corridors,  in  1999  the  Government  launched \nthe  National  Highways  Development  Program  (NHDP).  Its  key \ncomponents  are  (i)  rehabilitation  and  widening  of  the  Golden \nQuadrilateral,  a  6,000-kilometer  (km)  highway  network,  to  be \ncompleted  by  the  end  of  2004  (first  phase);  and  (ii)  rehabilitation \nand  widening  of  the  4,000  km  North-South  (N-S)  and  3,300  km \nEast-West  (E-W)  corridors,  to  be  completed  by  the  end  of  2007 \n(second phase).  \n \nIn  support  of  NHDP,  since  2000  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  has  provided  a  series  of  loans.  The  National  Highway \nCorridor  (Sector)  I  Project  is  the  fourth  in  this  series  and  the  first \nsector loan. The Project\u2019s main element is to rehabilitate and widen \npriority sections of the E-W Corridor, with emphasis on 662 km of \nexisting highway in the states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and \nUttar Pradesh.  \n \nA program of this magnitude requires broad-based policy reforms, \nranging \nfinancial \ninstitutional  capacity  building \nmanagement  to  creation  of  an  enabling  environment  for  private \nsector  participation  (PSP).  ADB  has  adopted  a  programmatic \napproach \nin  a  progressive  and \nthese  reforms \nevolutionary  manner  through  a  multiyear  lending  program.  ADB, \nthrough the programmatic approach, will assist the Government in \nits efforts to (i) strengthen project development and implementation \ncapability  of  National  Highways  Authority  of  India  (NHAI);  (ii) \nenhance PSP in highway development; (iii) boost sources of funds \nfor NHDP development; (iv) strengthen operation and maintenance \n(O&M) functions of NHAI; and (v) through these actions, enhance \nNHAI\u2019s professional management capability and financial viability.  \n \nA  key  instrument  to  facilitate  reaching  these  goals  is  the  trigger \npoint, which requires satisfactory implementation of the agreed-on \nmilestone action before project processing starts. While the trigger \npoint for last year\u2019s project was the progress of PSP, for this year\u2019s \nproject  it  was  to  secure  adequate  funds  to  complete  phase  2        \nof NHDP.   Based on ADB\u2019s 2002 recommendation to increase  the  \n \n\nto  advance \n\nfrom \n\nfor \n\n\fcess  by  40%,  the  Government  increased  it  by  50%  effective  28 \nFebruary  2003,  triggering  the  initiation  of  this  year\u2019s  project \nprocessing.  \n \nThe  objective  of  ADB\u2019s  programmatic  approach  is  to  help  the \nGovernment strengthen a policy and institutional framework for the \nefficient  delivery  of  highway  development  and  O&M  services \nthrough policy and institutional reforms of current systems.  \n \nUnder this overall framework, this year\u2019s Project  focuses on the E-\nW Corridor, using the sector loan modality, to achieve the following \nobjectives:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \nUpgrade  the  key  national  arterial  corridors  connecting  the \neastern  and  western  ends  of  the  country  to  help  reduce \nregional disparities. \nFacilitate  PSP \nadvisory services to process the PSP component. \nHelp the Government to prevent further spread of HIV/AIDs \nand  raise  public  awareness  of  the  risks  of  trafficking  in \nwomen and children. \nEnhance road safety by introducing a \u201csafety zone\u201d concept \nfor a pilot section in the E-W Corridor. \n\nin  highway  development  by  providing \n\n \nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $760  million  equivalent, \nincluding  allowances  for  interest  during  construction.  Foreign \nexchange costs are estimated at $454 million, representing 60% of \nthe total cost, while the local currency costs are estimated at  $306 \nmillion equivalent, representing 40%. \n \nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  of  $400  million  from  its \nordinary  capital  resources  to  help  finance  the  Project,  while  the \nGovernment will provide the foreign currency cost of $34 million to \ncover the front-end fee and interest during construction, as well as \nlocal currency cost of $258 million equivalent. \n \n\n \nSource \nAsian Development \n  Bank \nGovernment \nPrivate Sector \nTotal \n \n\n($ million) \n\nForeign \nExchange \n  381 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\n \n\n19 \n\nTotal \nCost \n 400 \n\n \nPercentage \n\n  34 \n  40 \n  454 \n\n  258 \n \n29 \n  306 \n\n 292 \n  69 \n 760 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n53 \n\n38 \n9 \n100 \n\niv \n\n \n\n \n\nObjectives and Scope  \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A  loan  of  $400  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  will     \n\n \nSource:  ADB mission and NHAI. \n \n\nbe  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility.  The  loan \nwill  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an \ninterest rate determined in accordance with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  \nlending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front- \n\n\f \n\nv \n\nend fee of 0.50%, and such other  terms  and conditions set forth \nin  the  draft  Loan and  Project  Agreements.  The  Government  will \ncover  the  cost  of  $292  million  equivalent  in  foreign  and  local \ncurrency cost.  \n \nThe Government will make the loan proceeds available promptly to \nNHAI. The Government\u2019s policy of assistance to NHAI for the E-W \nCorridor  is  a  loan-grant  ratio  of  20:80.  In  June  2003,  the  Public \nInvestment Board issued blanket approval of the entire E-W and N-\nS corridors. The Government will bear the foreign exchange risk on \nthe loan. \n \nUntil 31 December 2007 \n \n30 June 2007 \n \n \nNHAI \n \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  by  two  project  implementation \nunits (PIUs) to be established by NHAI along the priority highways, \nand such other PIUs as required for non-core subprojects. \n \nCivil  works  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines \nfor Procurement,  following  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB). \nProcurement  of civil works  will  be  carried  out  among  prequalified \nbidders.  ICB  will  be  used  to  procure  equipment  of  an  estimated \nvalue  of  $500,000,  international  shopping  for  contracts  with  an \nestimated  value  of  $100,000\u2013$500,000,  and  direct  purchase \narrangement for contracts of less than $100,000.  \n \nConsulting services will be required for (i) construction supervision \nfor the project roads (except for the PSP component), (ii) provision \nof  a  financial  adviser\u2019s  services  for  the  PSP  component,  and  (iii) \ndesign  of  the  road  \u201csafety  zone\u201d  concept  and  establishing \noperational arrangements for enforcement and emergency medical \nservices along the pilot section of the safety zone. Consultants will \nbe  recruited  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method \n(and full or simplified technical proposals, depending on the size of \nthe contracts) in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants,  and  other  arrangements  acceptable  to  ADB  for \nselecting  and  engaging  domestic  consultants.  In  addition,  an \nindividual  domestic  consultant  would  be  engaged  for  overseeing \nthe activities of nongovernment organization who would implement \nan  awareness  campaign  to  prevent  HIV/AIDs  and  trafficking  of \nwomen and children, and to build capacity. The domestic individual \nconsultant  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  arrangements \nacceptable \nfor  selecting  and  engaging  domestic \nconsultants. \n \n\nto  ADB \n\n  \n\n \n\nAllocation and \nRelending Terms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n\nExecuting Agency \n\nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n  \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nA major benefit  of the Project is the sustainable economic growth \nto  be  attained  through  enhanced  efficiency  of  economic activities. \nThe Project will enable cargo and people to move faster and wider \nat  lower  cost.  While  the  Project\u2019s  overall  impact  on  economic \ngrowth  is  difficult  to  estimate  quantitatively,  direct  economic \nbenefits  were  estimated  conservatively  based  on  the  estimate  of \nvehicle  operating  cost  savings.  The  economic  internal  rate  of \nreturn thus calculated was 23% for the core subproject. \n  \nAnother related project benefit is reduced disparities between fast- \nand slow-growing states. Linking the eastern and western ends of \nthe  country  to  major  manufacturing  and  consumption  centers  will \nhelp  significantly  integrate  isolated  and  backward  economies  into \nthe mainstream economies.  \n \nThe Project will contribute to the poverty reduction by establishing \nan  integrated  road  network  consisting  of  rural  roads,  major \ndistrict/state  roads,  and  national  highways.  The  network  will  thus \nenhance long-term economic opportunities of rural communities by \n(i)  enabling  villagers  to  shift  from  subsistence  farming  to  market-\noriented  agricultural  surplus  production;  and  (ii)  helping  local \npeople,  particularly  the  youth,  move  out  of  their  communities  to \nwork  at  better-paid  jobs  in  manufacturing  or  trading.  Project \nconstruction,  tree  planting,  and  ensuing  maintenance  works  will \ndirectly  increase  earnings  of  the  poor,  who  are  largely  depending \non  temporary  employment,  and  thus  have  a  short-term  poverty \nreduction impact. \n \nA  potential  risk  is  possible  delays  in  implementation  due  to \nprolonged  land  acquisition.  The  need  for  land  acquisition  is \nrelatively  limited.  Existing  right  of  ways  are  usually broad enough \nto  accommodate  service  roads  and  drainage  lines.  The  recent \namendment of the National Highway Act enables NHAI to acquire \nland expeditiously and predictably. \n  \nAnother  potential  project  risk  is  possible  delay  in  processing  non-\ncore  subprojects  due  to  unfamiliarity  of  NHAI  with  procedural \nrequirements  of  ADB\u2019s  sector  loan.  Detailed  forms  of  summary \nsubproject appraisal report, checklists, and other reporting formats \nhave  been  provided  to  NHAI  to  facilitate  processing  of  its \nsubprojects.  To  strengthen  its  technical  capability,  NHAI  has \nestablished  a  technical  group  of  experts  within  the  project  team. \nThe  project  preparatory technical assistance consultants will train \nthe  team  staff,  including  the  experts.  These  actions  will  minimize \npossible delay due to a new lending modality. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n          1 \n\nI.  \n\nPROPOSAL \n\n \n\nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \n\n1. \nto India for the National Highway Corridor (Sector) I Project.  \n \n\nII.  \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA.  \n \n2. \nIndia\u2019s  economy  has  long  suffered  from  the  national  highway  (NH)  system\u2019s  chronic \ncapacity shortage. Of the NH network of 58,112 kilometers (km), 39% are still single lane and \n59% are two lane, while four-lane highways, a desirable standard for arterial national corridors, \naccount for only 2%. The Government\u2019s Tenth Five-Year Plan (FYP, 2003\u20132007) thus set forth \nseveral investment programs to improve the NH system by (i) widening 22,000 km of two-lane \nroads  to  four  lanes;  (ii)  constructing  2,000  km  of  expressways;  (iii)  widening  22,500  km  of \nsingle-lane roads to two lanes; and (iv) strengthening 19,300 km of pavement. Total investment \nrequired to implement these programs is estimated at $37 billion (Appendix 2).  \n \n3. \nBecause of the magnitude of investments required, the Government has placed highest \npriority  on  the  National  Highway  Development  Program  (NHDP)  to  upgrade  three  key  arterial \ncorridors  in  10  years    (1998-2007):  (i)  Golden  Quadrilateral\u20146,000  km;  (ii)  North-South  (N-S) \nCorridor\u20144,000  km;  and  (iii)  East-West  (E-W)  Corridor\u20143,300  km.  Total  program  cost  is \nestimated  at  $13\u2013$15  billion,  on  which  the  Government  decided  to  allocate  the  central  road \nfunds on a priority basis. NHDP is expected to help contribute to the increased integration of the \ncountry by connecting the entire eastern and western and also northern and southern ends of \nthe country.  \n \n4. \nSince 2000, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has supported NHDP with three loans, \nand plans to provide another two for 2003\u20132004, totaling $1.54 billion (12% of the total program \ncost).  As  NHDP  implementation  is  halfway  through,  ADB  conducted  a  mid-term  review  and \nevaluated  (i)  physical  progress  of  NHDP;  (ii)  extent  of  PSP;  (iii)  financial  viability  and \nsustainability of NHDP; and (iv) effectiveness of the institutional arrangements.  \n \n5. \nPhysical  delivery  of  the  program.  The  first  phase  of  NHDP  for  the  Golden \nQuadrilateral,  slated  for  completion  by  the  end  of  2004,  is  well  underway.  To  date,  24%  (or \n1,408  km)  has  been  completed,  74.5%  (or  4,354  km)  is  currently  under  implementation,  and \n1.5%  (or  84  km)  has  yet  to  be  awarded.  Over  the  last  4.5  years,  the  National  Highways \nAuthority of India (NHAI) has issued approximately 155 contracts for a total of 6,025 km under \nNHDP  (of  which  40  contracts  or  893  km  have  been  completed).  This  is  an  impressive \nprocurement  achievement\u2014  an  estimated  35  contracts  on  average  per  year  or  roughly  1,400 \nkm annually. However, assuming an average contract implementation period of 3 years, NHAI \nwill have to double this number of kilometers to complete the remaining 6,962 km programmed \nby  the  end  of  2007.  Doubling  the  pace  of  delivery  will  require  NHAI  to  strengthen  project \nmanagement  capability  and,  wherever  possible,  simplify  and  standardize  project  preparation \nand processing.  \n \n6. \nPrivate  sector  participation.  Since  1999,  NHAI  has  actively  explored  options  to \nincrease  participation  of  the  private  sector  in  highway  development.  To  date,  eight  toll-based \nbuild-operate-transfer  (BOT)  concessions,  eight  annuity-based  contracts,  and  eight  special-\npurpose  vehicles  (SPVs)  have  been  awarded,  covering  1,154  km  (19%  of  total  length \ncontracted  to  date),  and  $1.9  billion  of  the  total  project  cost  with  PSP  (of  which  $1.1  billion  is \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nestimated to be the private sector contribution). By the end of FY2007/08, the private sector will \nhave contributed $1.8 million or almost 12% of total capital cost for NHDP. This level of PSP, \nhowever,  has  been  achieved  by  the  Government  provision  of  subsidies  of  16\u201349%  of \nconstruction costs1 and also by its payment of annuity of around 16% return. As projects move \nto less-trafficked segments of NHDP networks as those in the E-W and N-S corridors, the public \nsector  contribution  is  likely  to  be  increased  significantly.  This  potential  increase  should  be \nminimized  by  introducing  a  variety  of  credit  enhancement  mechanisms  and  innovative  PSP \nschemes (Supplementary Appendix A-2 for an overview of, and lessons learned from, PSP).  \n \n7. \nFinancial  viability  and  sustainability.  To  complete  NHDP,  the  first-  and  second-\nphase programs, and others mandated to NHAI, require a total of $32.5 billion2 over FY1999\u2013\nFY2017: $15.2 billion for capital financing, and $17.3 billion for debt service ($1.6 billion for on-\nlent government loans and $15.7 billion for market borrowings). To finance these capital works \nand  debt  service,  it  is  anticipated  for  NHAI  to  raise  $30.7  billion  over  the  same  period:  $15.7 \nbillion from cess (tax), $9.1 billion from market borrowings, $4.1 billion from external assistance, \nand $1.8 billion from PSP. The shortfall of $1.8 billion is envisaged to be financed out of NHAI \ntolls.  Toll  revenue  for  FY2005\u2013FY2017  is  estimated  to  amount  to  $6.5  billion,3  of  which \noperation and maintenance (O&M) will require $5.0 billion.4 Assuming tolls are fully indexed with \ninflation, estimated toll revenue is almost sufficient to cover government debt servicing of $1.8 \nbillion for the period estimated5 (Supplemental Appendix E-2). \n \n8. \nA  year  ago,  ADB  conducted  a  long-term  cash-flow  analysis  to  find  out  whether  NHAI \ncould finance investments to complete the second phase of NHDP and associated cost of debt \nservices.  The  analysis  found  that  NHAI  would  face  major  cash-flow  problems  during  FY2007-\nFY2009,  and \nthis \nrecommendation, the Government increased cess by 50% effective on 28 February 2003. While \nthis  action  will  substantially  resolve  anticipated  cash-flow  problems,  overall  achievability  of \nNHAI\u2019s cash-flow forecast still needs to be critically reviewed. The following are the issues:  \n \n\nrecommended  substantial \n\nincrease  of  cess  or \n\ntoll.6  Acting  on \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nAn additional $6.7 billion has to be raised from the market (2-3 times larger than \nthe  amount  already  raised  from  the  market  [$2.4  billion]). While  the  market  has \nbeen receptive to NHAI offerings, they will become less attractive as liabilities of \nNHAI  increase  and  its  liquidity  becomes  more  dependent  on  future  borrowings. \nStrengthening  cash-flow  management  and  developing  a  more  transparent \nfinancial  reporting  system  will  be  critically  important  (paras.  48\u201350),  and  will  be \nsupported by ADB technical assistance (TA).7  \nA  fund  of  $4.1  billion  must  be  raised  from  multilateral  and  bilateral  agencies. \nNHAI is likely to receive $1.5 billion from ADB (including 2003 and 2004 loans for \nNHDP)  and  $1.5  billion\u2013$2.0  billion  from  the  World  Bank  (including  one  or  two \npipeline  loans  for  2003-2005).  The  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  \n\n                                                 \n1  A  notable  exception  to  this  is  the  BOT  project  for  the  Delhi-Gurgaon  section,  which  has  generated  to  NHAI  a \n\nnegative grant amounting to 11% of project cost.  \n2  Rupee cash-flow forecasts converted at $1 = Rs45. \n3  Rupee  cash-flow  forecasts  assume  Rs2.0  million  and  Rs1.0  million  is  collected  per  kilometer  on  the  golden \nquadrilateral, and N-S and E-W corridors, respectively. NHAI toll estimates are indexed in accordance with inflation \nestimated at 4.56% per annum.  \n\n4  Cash-flow  forecasts  estimate  O&M  at  Rs11.5  lakh/km  of  four-lane  highway.  O&M  estimates  are  indexed  in \n\naccordance with inflation estimated at 4.56% per annum. \n\n5  With  no  growth  in  traffic,  Rs1.4  billion  will  be  generated  from  tolls;  with  2%  growth  in  traffic,  Rs2.2  billion  will  be \n\ngenerated (the latter covering the entire $1.8 billion shortfall). \n\n6  ADB. 2002.

The sources \nfor the additional $1.1 billion\u2013$1.6 billion have yet to be identified or confirmed. \n$6.5  billion  tolls  need  to  be  collected,  which  require  reliable  traffic  forecast  and \nability  to  collect  toll  revenues  immediately  after  roads  are  commissioned,  and \npolitical willingness to fully and annually index toll revenues with inflation. \n\n \n9. \nInstitutional aspect. Since NHDP started, NHAI has expanded significantly. In 2000, it \nhad  200  staff,8  350  in  2001,9  and  530  now.10  Although  the  pace  of  expansion  is  very  fast,  it \nmight be justifiable as investment programs are escalating rapidly and government pressure to \nspeed up NHDP is mounting. In 2000\u20132002, staff, productivity increased significantly (by 60%) \nin  terms  of  kilometers  processed.  However,  this  pace  of  staff  expansion  is  still  alarming,  and \nstaffing increase should be kept to a minimum.  \n \n10. \nA  key  element  to  slowing  down  the  pace  of  expansion  is  outsourcing.  NHAI  has  been \npursuing this direction in a vigorous manner by contracting out various project development and \nimplementation  activities  to  the  private  sector,  including  design,  construction,  construction \nsupervision,  and  O&M.  While  enabling  NHAI  to  deliver  a  larger  number  of  contracts  more \nefficiently, this approach outstrips NHAI\u2019s capability to monitor consultants and contractors. The \nproblem is compounded by NHAI\u2019s recruitment policy, which largely depends on deputation of \nstaff  from  government  agencies  such  as  Ministry  of  Road  Transport  and  Highways  (MORTH) \nand state public works departments (PWDs). Most professional staff of NHAI (270 out of 530) \nare deputed from these agencies for 2 years, with possible extension of another 3. This staffing \npolicy has caused problems in retaining qualified professional staff, building internal engineering \nand  operational  capacity,  and  nurturing  a  corporate  culture significantly different  from  ordinary \ngovernment agencies. The Project addresses monitoring capacity by strengthening the project \nteam\u2019s  capacity  by  engaging  six  experienced  technical  experts.  Staffing  is  being  addressed \nunder the ongoing Institutional Strengthening Study financed by the World Bank.  \n  \nB.  \n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nADB Strategy  \n\n \n\n \n\na. \n\nProgrammatic Approach and Policy Dialogue \n\n \n11. \nIn providing a series of loans to NHDP, ADB has adopted a programmatic approach to \nrealize medium- to long-term goals in a progressive and evolutionary manner. ADB, through the \nprogrammatic  approach,  will  assist  the  Government  in  its  efforts  to  achieve  the  mid-term \nobjectives to (i) strengthen project development/implementation capability; (ii) enhance PSP in \nhighway development; (iii) strengthen NHAI\u2019s fund mobilization capability; (iv) strengthen NHAI\u2019s \nO&M  function;  and  (v)  enhance  NHAI\u2019s  professional  management  capability  and  financial \nviability. As the midterm review indicates, significant progress has been made for the first three \ngoals.  \n \n12. \nADB  has  systematically  pursued  these  goals  by  introducing  the  concept  of  the  trigger \npoint (project processing starts only upon satisfactory implementation of agreed-on milestones). \nWhile  the  trigger  point  for  last  year\u2019s  project  was  progress  of  PSP,  for  this  year\u2019s  project  the \ntrigger point is to secure adequate funds to  complete the second phase of NHDP.

Manila. \n\n10 NHAI: A finding of the Loan Fact-Finding Mission.  \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\npoint of this year\u2019s project was met when the Government increased cess on 28 February 2003. \nWith progress made in achieving the first three goals, policy dialogue will shift its focus to the \nremaining two goals \u2013 (i) enhancement of O&M function, and (ii) organizational realignment.  \n \nOperation  and  Maintenance  Issue.  As  more  highways  are  constructed  and  placed  in \n13. \nservice, O&M is becoming an increasingly important issue for NHAI. Newly created assets need \nto  be  maintained,  tolls  collected  with  minimum  leakage,  and  rights  of  way  (ROW)  kept  clear. \nGiven the government decision to convert four-laned NHs into toll roads, O&M should no longer \nbe  considered  a  cost  center  but  a  potential  profit  center.  NHDP  could  generate  $200  million\u2013\n$400  million  per  year.  The  organizational  arrangement,  however,  is  not  structured  to  capture \nthis opportunity. The possibility of establishing a separate line of business within NHAI should \nbe explored, together with development of associated accounting systems which would enable \nproper cost and revenue allocations among different lines of businesses.  \n \n14. \nThe concept of O&M has been significantly expanded to include asset management, and \nwill  be  further  expanded  to  include  traffic  and  ROW  management.  The  ongoing  corridor \nmanagement  unit  approach  is  one  trial  moving  in  this  direction,  which  will  be  continuously \npursued  under  the  programmatic  approach.  It  should  be  fine-tuned  so  that  the  corridor \nmanagement unit approach is effectively implemented under diverse operational circumstances \nsuch  as  annuity-based  or  BOT  concession  schemes.  During  the  Appraisal  Mission,  it  was \nagreed to hold a tripartite meeting between ADB, World Bank, and the  Government to discuss \nthese  O&M-related issues in more depth and from a broader context.  \n \n15. \nAnother  O&M-related  issue  is  tolling,  which  is  a  major  determinant  of  NHAI\u2019s  financial \nsustainability. Once NHs have four lanes, tolls should be collected as soon as possible\u2014in any \nevent,  within  six  months  after  construction  is  completed.  Once  tolling  is  widely  accepted,  the \nnext challenge will be setting tolls at the right level to cover O&M costs and debt services from \nmultilateral  agencies.  While  this  current  toll  policy  is  justifiable,  in  the  long  run  they  should  be \ngradually increased to cover all debt services. Another element of tolls is how they are collected. \nNHAI  recently  set  up  an  in-house  committee  to  deliberate  on  toll  collection  and  optimization. \nThese  issues  will  be  addressed  in  the  tolling  system  study  funded  under  ADB\u2019s  Surat-Manor \nTollway Project.11 This study will be conducted as an integral part of the policy dialogue to be \nconducted between the Government and ADB. Another issue is the need to grant NHAI the right \nto retain tolls as revenue. Based on the covenant between the Government and ADB in October \n2002, NHAI initiated discussions this year with agencies to acquire this right. The Government \nagreed to finalize an arrangement so that NHAI can be able to retain tolls collected as its own \nrevenue by 31 December 2004.  \n \n16. \nOrganizational structure of the National Highways Authority of India. This relates to \ntwo  sub-issues:  a  short-term  one\u2014a  need  to  realign  the  current  organizational  arrangement, \nand a long-term one\u2014a need to change corporate structure. NHAI\u2019s organizational arrangement \nevolved  over  the  years  in  a  rather  ad  hoc  manner.  New  units  were  created  and  new  project \nimplementation  units  (PIUs)  added  without  a  clear  guide  to  allocate  functions  among  various \nunits. Now that it has entered a new phase of program implementation and grown in size, NHAI \nshould evaluate how efficient the current organization is and what readjustments are necessary \nto accomplish its mission more efficiently.  \n  \n17. \nIn  the  long  run,  NHAI  should  look  into  the  possibility  of  introducing  alternative  form  of \norganization.  NHAI\u2019s  current  business  model  (a  government  agent  that  receives  management \n\n                                                 \n11 Negotiation with a consultant was delayed and is now scheduled for 15 November 2003. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n          5 \n\nfees  in  return  for  construction  and  maintenance)12  is  less  valid  now  in  light  of  the  future \noperation of NHAI. The resulting financial structure (tolls collected are not NHAI\u2019s revenue, and \nhighways  constructed  are  not  NHAI\u2019s  assets)  has  significantly  constrained  strategic  options  to \nmobilize  funds.  Once  it  is  allowed  to  retain  tolls  as  revenue  as  covenanted  in  the  Loan \nAgreement  of the East-West Corridor Project, NHAI should start exploring alternative forms  of \norganization (including public corporation) and compare their merits and demerits with those of \nthe present organization. Since next year\u2019s project is likely to be the last in this series of lending \nto NHDP, the issue of organization will be addressed during preparation and processing of next \nyear\u2019s project.  \n \n\nb. \n\nSector-Loan Approach \n\n \nThe  midterm  review  indicated  that  subproject  preparation  and  processing  should  be \n18. \nstandardized  and  project  monitoring  capability  strengthened.  To  do  so  and  to  grant  the \nGovernment\u2019s request to increase flexibility in selection of road sections to be financed by ADB, \nit  was  decided  to  apply  the  sector-loan  modality  for  this  year\u2019s  project.  Requirements  for  the \nsector  loan  are  (i)  existence  of  a  sector  development  plan,  (ii)  institutional  capability  to \nimplement the sector development plan, and (iii) development of policies to enable the sector to \nimprove  its  performance.  The  Fact-Finding  Mission  found  that  these  requirements  were \nsatisfactorily met (Supplemental Appendix C-4).  \n \n19. \n \n\nThe sector-loan approach adopted for this Project has the following features:  \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nPriority highways will be identified to ensure minimum contiguity of project roads. \nFrom  the  above  priority  highways,  a  core  subproject  will  be  selected  as  an \nexemplary subproject for the appraisal of the rest of subprojects. \nNHAI  will  select  eligible  non-core  subprojects  and  appraise  them  according  to \ncriteria agreed on between ADB and NHAI (Appendix 11). Appraised subprojects \nwill be sent for approval to ADB using a summary report format, with supportive \ndocuments being attached. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n \nC.  \n \n20. \nSince 1988, ADB has approved eight loans for the road subsector (Appendix 3) in India, \ntotaling $1.8 billion. Implementation of earlier projects approved in 1988-1993 were significantly \ndelayed  due  to  operational  and  institutional  shortcomings.  ADB  has  thus  (i)  allowed  advance \ncivil works procurement and recruitment of construction supervision consultants, ensuring award \nof  contracts  upon  loan  effectiveness;  (ii)  removed  utilities  and  other  encumbrances  before \nconstruction  starts;  (iii)  introduced  a  larger  size  of  contract  packages  to  attract  experienced \ninternational contractors; and (iv) raised the level of authority of the engineer to ensure efficient \nand  objective  decision  making  during  execution.  Challenges  now  are  system-wide  operational \nissues rather than project-by-project implementation problems. The former includes the need to \nstandardize project development, to be addressed by adopting the sector-loan modality. \n \nD.  \n \n21. \nThe World Bank has also provided 16 loans, amounting to about $3.5 billion, to upgrade \nnational  highways,  improve  state  highways,  and  construct  and  rehabilitate  rural  roads.  As \ncombined World Bank and ADB assistance for the road subsector is over $5 billion, providing \n\nExternal Assistance \n\n                                                 \n12 The fee for construction is 1% of cost, while that for maintenance is 9%. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nsuch assistance should be done in a well-coordinated manner to generate maximum synergy in \noperations,  with  minimum  duplication.  In  2001,  ADB  and  World  Bank  developed  their \ncoordinated assistance strategy for India\u2019s road subsector, which has been updated from time to \ntime  to  keep  it  relevant  to  the  government  agenda.  The  Government,  ADB,  and  World  Bank, \nhave been holding tripartite meetings periodically to discuss major policy and investment issues \nin  the  road  sector.  The  most  recent  meeting  was  held  in  April  2003,  with  secretary-level \nparticipation  from  the  Government.  Close  coordination  between  ADB  and  World  Bank  will \ncontinue using these mechanisms.  \n \n22. \nJBIC is another major donor to the highway sector, having provided five loans amounting \nto $300 million to upgrade NH sections and construct a bridge. While JBIC has not been active \nin  India\u2019s  highway  sector  for  the  last  few  years,  ADB  has  been  in  close  contact  with  JBIC  to \nexchange  information  and  explore  the  possible  areas  of  cooperation.  The  Department  for \nInternational  Development  of  the  United  Kingdom  is  another  important  partner  of  ADB  in  its \noperations  in  India,  having  provided  grant  assistance  to  the  Madhya  Pradesh  State  Road \nProject and the proposed rural roads sector project.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nPriority Highways  \n\n \nA.  \n \nThe Project13 will finance sections of the E-W Corridor under the sector-loan modality. Of \n23. \nthese  sections,  662  km  are  priority  highways  in  Rajasthan,  Madhya  Pradesh,  and  Uttar \nPradesh. Priority highways are divided into five sections. Among them, section C was selected \nas  a  core  subproject  since  it  represents  a  typical  set  of  project  development  issues,  including \ntechnical,  environmental,  and  social  ones.  If  NHAI  identifies  other  sections  that  need  to  be \ndeveloped more urgently, the above sections can be replaced by others, or other sections can \nbe added to the above sections, provided that the other sections (i) are part of the E-W Corridor \nand (ii) satisfy eligibility criteria of subprojects (Appendix 11).  \n \n\nTable 1:  Priority Highways \n\nSection  Priority Highways  \n\nSpecific Locations \n\nLength \n\nState \n\nChittorgarh-Kota (excluding Kota \nBypass) \nKota- RJ/MP Border (excluding \nKota Bypass) \nRJ/MP Border-Jhansi (excluding \nJhansi Bypass) \n\nJhansi-Orai (including Jhansi \nBypass) \nOrai-Bognipur-Barah \n\nNH 76 (km212\u2013km376) \n\n164 km \n\nRJ \n\nNH 76 (km406\u2013km579) \n\n173 km \n\nRJ \n\nNH 76 (km579\u2013km609) \nShvpuri Bypass (24km in length) \nNH 25 (km15\u2013km92) \nJhansi Bypass (16km in length) \nNH 25 (km104\u2013km212)  \nNH 25 (km212\u2013km255) \nNH 2 (km422\u2013km449) \n\n131 km  MP/UP \n\n124 km \n\nUP \n\n 70 km \n\nUP \n\nObjectives \n\n      km = kilometer, MP = Madhya Pradesh, RJ = Rajasthan, UP = Uttar Pradesh. \n \nB.  \n \n24. \nThe  objective  of  ADB\u2019s  programmatic  approach  is  to  help  the  Government  strengthen \nthe  policy  and  institutional  framework  for  efficient  delivery  of  highway  development  and  O&M \n\n                                                 \n13  The  Project  was  prepared  under  ADB.  2002.  National  Highway  Corridor  (Sector).  Manila  (TA  4036-IND).  ADB\u2019s \nprevious requirement to convert the grant amount exceeding $250,000 into a part of the subsequent loan will not \nbe applied.  \n\nA \n\nB \n\nC \n\nD \n\nE \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n          7 \n\nservices through policy and institutional reforms to enhance transport efficiency without causing \nmajor environmental and social problems.  \n \n25. \n \n\nUnder this framework, the Project focuses on the E-W Corridor to achieve the following:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nUpgrade key national arterial corridors connecting the eastern and western ends \nof the country to help reduce regional disparities. \nFacilitate  PSP  in  highway  development  by  providing  necessary  advisory \nservices.  \nContribute  to  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  prevent  spread  of  HIV/AIDS14  and \nincrease  awareness  of  possible  risk  of  trafficking  in  women  and  children  by \ncollaborating  with  relevant  state  authorities  concerned  with  health,  women,  and \nchildren.  \nEnhance  road  safety  through  pilot  introduction  of  a  safety  zone  for  a  part  of \nnational highway under the E-W Corridor.  \n\n \nC.  \n \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n1. \n\nHighway Investment  \n\n \nThe component will finance the widening of stretches between Chittorgarh and Orai (592 \n26. \nkm)  into  four-lane  roads.  The  core  subproject,  a  131  km  section  between  the  Rajasthan  and \nMadhya  Pradesh  border  and  Jhansi,  will  cost  $151.8  million,  while  non-core  subprojects  will \ncost an estimated $484.5 million, covering 461 km. ADB will finance the entire foreign exchange \nportion of the project cost, except the front-end fee and interest during construction, which will \nbe borne by the Government (Supplementary Appendix B-1), and part of local currency costs. \nOnce these sections are completed, their O&M will be contracted out to a third party.  \n \n\n2. \n\nPrivate Sector Participation  \n\n \n27. \nAs NHAI must be encouraged to use PSP as a key modality to finance highways, ADB \nand  NHAI  agreed  that  at  least  10%  of  project  highways  are  to  be  developed  under  a  PSP \nscheme. NHAI will identify section(s) to be developed under the PSP scheme within 3 months of \nloan effectiveness. NHAI will explore the possibility of PSP in the Orai-Balah section (70 km)\u2014\nthe eastern end of the priority highways adjoining golden quadrilateral at Barah. An agreement \nwas reached with NHAI that the PSP component(s) will meet all requirements imposed on the \nsubprojects  to  ensure,  among  other  requirements,  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  policies. \nNHAI further agreed to report to ADB in a timely manner the results of the bidding, negotiations, \nand financial closure so that, in case these are not finalized, the Government and ADB can take \nnecessary action promptly.  \n \n28.  While  it  will  not  directly  finance  the  PSP  development,  ADB  will  help  NHAI  engage  a \nfinancial  adviser  (a  domestic  firm  costing  $100,000  equivalent)  (Supplementary  Appendix  D-4 \nfor  terms  of  reference).  Furthermore,  to  catalyze  the  inflow  of  commercial  funds  for  PSP,  if \nrequested  by  the  Government  and  NHAI,  ADB\u2019s  private  sector  window  would  help  the  private \nconcessionaire  through  lending  or  guarantee  operations.  ADB\u2019s  private  sector  support \nmodalities will, however, be subject to a separate due-diligence exercise. \n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n14 Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n3. \n\nHIV/AIDS and Anti-Trafficking  \n\nThis  component  is  designed  to  reduce  risks  of  spreading  HIV/AIDS  and  trafficking  \n\n \n29. \nwomen and children.  \n \n30. \nHIV/AIDS  subcomponent.

This subcomponent will engage \nin  the  following  key  activities:  (i)  awareness  raising  among  construction  workers,  (ii)  public \nawareness raising and a change behavior campaign among high-risk groups, (iii) strengthening \nof referral systems for sexually transmitted diseases and HIV for early diagnosis along priority \nhighways, (iv) condom promotion and distribution; and (v) capacity building of service providers \nand decision makers.  \n \nAnti-trafficking  subcomponent.  This  subcomponent  will  be  carried  out  by  NGOs  in \n31. \nconjunction  with  HIV/AIDS  prevention  activities.  It  will  draw  on  knowledge  and  expertise  from \nstate  departments  of  women  and  child  development  and  social  welfare,  already-operating \nNGOs,  and  other  locally  available  resources.  The  subcomponent  will  engage  in  three  main \nactivities:  (i)  awareness  raising  and  a  safe-migration  campaign  (target  groups  are  from  the \ndemand  side  [e.g.,  truck  drivers/helpers]  and  supply  side  [e.g.,  commercial  sex  workers,  tribal \nwomen  and  children,  and  migrant  women]);  (ii)  channeling  resources  from  national  or  state \nprograms  to  empower  women  and  children  to  vulnerable  tribal  women  or  children;  and  (iii) \ncapacity building of service providers, communities, and decision makers. \n \nNHAI\u2019s  environment  and  social  development  unit  (ESDU)16  will  establish  an  HIV/AIDS \n32. \nprevention and anti-trafficking cell within the unit to implement this component. The cell will be \nheaded by a general manager in charge of social development issues, who will be assisted by \nthree staff consultants to be engaged later under a separate financing arrangement.17 The cell \nwill engage three locally based NGOs. The activities of these NGOs would be coordinated and \nmonitored  by  a  domestic  consultant  to  be  financed  by  ADB.  The  estimated  cost  for  the \ncomponent is about $400,000  (Supplementary Appendix B-3). \n \n\n4. \n\nRoad safety  \n\n \nThis  component  is  designed  to  enhance  road  safety  by  introducing  a  safety  zone  to  a \n33. \nselected pilot section on the E-W Corridor. The safety zone is intended to institute several road \nsafety equipment/systems in an integrated manner to maximize their impacts. It will be equipped \nwith  (i)  advanced  traffic  management  systems  to  monitor  the  road  situation  in  a  centrally \ncontrolled  manner;  (ii)  weigh-in-motion  and/or  static  weighing  platforms  to  control  overloading; \n(iii) speed-monitoring equipment to spot speeding vehicles; and (iv) ambulances and other relief \nequipment to provide emergency road services. To ensure the effective operation of the safety \nzone, appropriate operators and/or authorities will be mobilized to enforce traffic regulations and \nprovide  emergency  medical  services.  The  component  will  decide  what  systems  will  work  best \nfor  the  pilot  section.  The  150-200  km  pilot  section  will  be  identified  for  the  Jhansi-Lucknow \nsection,  which  has  the  highest  traffic  level  in  the  E-W  Corridor.

It is \n\nheaded by a general manager.  \n\n17 Financed by the World Bank.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n          9 \n\nunit  will  be  a  focal  point  for  this  component  and  guided  by  an  appropriate  arrangement  to  be \nestablished  within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  in  coordination  with  MORTH  and  relevant \nstate  authorities.  ADB  will  finance  the  consultancy  services  of  $500,000  to  define  the  safety \nzone concept and operational arrangements for enforcement and emergency medical services. \nADB  will  also  finance  the  cost  of  purchasing  equipment  and  systems  ($11.8  million) \n(Supplemental Appendix B-4). \n  \nD.  \n \n34. \nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $760  million  equivalent,  including  allowances  for \ncontingencies and interest during construction. Foreign exchange costs are estimated at $454 \nmillion,  representing  60%  of  the  total  cost,  while  local  currency  costs  are  estimated  at  $306 \nmillion  equivalent,  representing  40%.

The  Government  will \nbear the foreign exchange risk of the loan.  \n \nF.  \n \n \n \n38. \nNHAI will be the Executing Agency for the Project. The Project will be implemented by \ntwo especially created PIUs, which will be in Kota (for the sections in Rajasthan and Jhansi (for \nthe  sections  in  Madhya  Pradesh  and  Uttar  Pradesh)  (Supplementary  Appendix  B-5  for \norganizational structure) and by such other PIUs as required to implement additional non-core \nsubprojects.  PIUs  should  be  adequately  staffed  within  2  months  of  loan  effectiveness  and,  in \nany case, before the award of civil works contracts under the subprojects, whichever is earlier. \nTwo staff at the level of general manager or deputy general manager will be assigned as project \ndirectors,  one  for  each  PIU,  to  be  assisted  by  deputy  general  managers  or  managers,  each \nresponsible  for  one  contract  package  or  a  PSP  component.  An  additional  deputy  general \nmanager  or  manager  will  be  assigned  for  each  PIU  to  oversee  resettlement  activities,  and \nhandle  grievances  to  be  filed  by  the  public,  including  project-affected  people  and  NGOs.  An \nto  each  PIU.  Sufficient \naccountant/financial  management  specialist  will  be  assigned \nadministrative authority will be delegated to PIUs for effective and timely project implementation. \nPIU activities will be overseen by the NHAI chair through the project team, which is headed by a \nchief  general  manager  in  charge  of  the  E-W  Corridor.  The  project  team\u2019s  main  function  is  to  \norganize  preparation  and  implementation  activities  of  the  Project  and  process  and  implement \nvarious consulting service contracts.  \n \nNHAI has already established a project team to develop the E-W Corridor. The team will \n39. \nbe supported by a technical group of experts consisting of (i) a group leader/highway engineer; \n(ii)  a  bridge  engineer,  (iii)  a  pavement  cum  material  engineer,  (iv)  an  economic  and  financial \nanalysis and PSP specialist, (v) an environmental specialist, and (vi) a resettlement and other \nsocial  development  specialist.  The  core  functions  of  the  technical  group  of  experts  are  the \nfollowing: \n \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n          11 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nReview  and  examine  all  technical  reports,  including  the  feasibility  studies, \npreliminary  design,  initial  environment  examination  (IEE),  resettlement  plans, \npoverty and social development strategy, indigenous peoples\u2019 development plan \n(IPDP) if required, and detailed design to ensure that subprojects are prepared in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  policies  and  NHAI\u2019s  design  standards  and  other \nrequirements.  \nEvaluate  the  overall  viability  of  individual  subprojects,  and  prepare  a  summary \nappraisal  report  to  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  approval,  together  with  necessary \nattachments. \nConduct proof checking for highways and bridges. \nPrepare bidding documents for the PSP component(s). \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Schedule and Period  \n\n \nEligibility  criteria  and  detailed  procedures  for  the  approval  process  to  facilitate \n40. \npreparation  of  non-core  subprojects  are  in  Appendix  11  and  the  Summary  Appraisal  Report \nFormat in Supplementary Appendix C-1. \n \n \n \n41. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  48  months,  inclusive  of  procurement  and  pre-\nconstruction  activities,  and  is  expected  to  be  completed  by  30  June  2007.  The  schedule  will \nallow for acquisition of land free from encumbrances; resettlement; and clearance of all utilities, \ntrees, and any other obstructions from the land to be used for construction. The implementation \nschedule is in Appendix 6.  \n \n \n \n42. \nCivil  works  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement \nthrough  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB).  Procurement  of  civil  works  under  ICB  will  be \ncarried out among prequalified bidders. A list of contract packages for the core subprojects is in \nAppendix 5. For procurement of goods, ICB will be used for supply contracts estimated at more \nthan $500,000, international shopping for $100,000\u2013500,000, and direct purchase arrangement \nfor less than $100,000. \n \n43. \nTo  expedite  procurement,  advance  action  for  prequalification  for  civil  works  contracts \nwas  approved  by  Management  on  29  July  2003.  The  Government  has  been  advised  that  this \napproval does not commit ADB to finance the Project. \n \n\nProcurement  \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n44. \nFor  the  highway  investment  component,  three  consulting  firms  will  be  engaged  to \nsupervise  construction  of  civil  works  using  full  technical  proposal  method  (Supplemental \nAppendix  D-2  for  terms  of  reference,  417  person-months  of  international  and  4,719  person-\nmonths  of  domestic  consultants  will  be  required).  For  the  PSP  component,  a  domestic \nconsulting firm will be engaged to provide financial adviser\u2019s services using simplified technical \nproposal  method  (Supplemental  Appendix  of  B-2;  15  person-months  of  domestic  consultants \nwill  be  required).  For  the  road  safety  component,  an  international  consulting  firm  will  be \nengaged using simplified technical proposal method to develop a safety-zone concept and build \ncapacity  to  enforce  traffic  regulations  and  provide  emergency  medical  services  (Supplemental \nAppendix  B-4;  15  person-months  of  an  international  consultant  and  15  person-months  of \ndomestic consultants will be required). NHAI will engage these consultants in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the \n\n \n\n\fselection and engagement of domestic consultants. The consultants will be engaged using the \nquality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  and  full  or  simplified  technical  proposals  in \naccordance with the size of contracts as stated.  \n \nFor the HIV/AIDS and anti-trafficking component, NHAI will engage locally based NGOs \n45. \nin  accordance  with  its  own  procedures  (Supplemental  Appendix  B-3;  98  person-months  of \ndomestic  NGOs  will  be  required).  These  NGOs\u2019  activities  will  be  supervised  by  a  domestic \nindividual consultant who will also be financed under the component (36 person-months). The \ndomestic consultant will be engaged through arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the selection \nand engagement of domestic consultants. \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n46. \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (January 2001) and Disbursement Guidelines for Disbursement Operations, LIBOR-\nbased Loan Products (July 2002), as amended from time to time, primarily using direct payment \nprocedures  for  funds  under  large  civil  works  contracts  and  consultancy  services.  To  facilitate \nproject implementation through timely release of funds, an imprest account will be established \nby  the  Government  with  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India.  The  imprest  account  will  be  managed, \nreplenished, and liquidated in accordance with the above handbook and guidelines. The initial \namount to be deposited in the imprest account will be equivalent to the estimated eligible project \nexpenditures  for  the  next  6  months  or  10%  of  the  loan  amount,  whichever  is  lower.  Any \nindividual  payment  to  be  reimbursed  or  liquidated  under  the  statement  of  expenditure  (SOE) \nmethod  for  reimbursement  of  certain  eligible  expenditures  will  not  exceed  the  equivalent  of \n$300,000. \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting and Auditing \n\nNHAI\u2019s  accounting  system  was  established \n\n \nin  accordance  with  government \n47. \nrequirements, and its financial statements are prepared in a format prescribed by the Controller \nand  Auditor  General  of  India,  which  audits  NHAI\u2019s  financial  statements  annually.  As  a  public \nsector  authority,  NHAI\u2019s  accounting  system  generally  adheres  to  basic  commercial  accounting \npractices  commonly  employed  in  India,  and  in  this  regard  is  broadly  in  accordance  with \nGenerally  Accepted  Accounting  Practices  (GAAP)  of  India.  Accrual  accounting  is  used, \ntransactions are recorded on a historical-cost basis, and a balance sheet and a profit-and-loss \nstatements are annually prepared (Appendix 7 for financial statements of NHAI). \n \n48. \nTo date, however, NHAI operates as a government agent with primary responsibility to \ndevelop national highways. As such, NHAI does not recognize road infrastructure as assets. On \nthe balance sheet, road construction expenditure is shown as work in progress where it remains \nupon completion of works. An accounting policy to otherwise retain these assets on the books \nhas  yet  to  be  determined.  NHAI\u2019s  primary  source  of  reported  revenue  is  the  management  fee \nreceived from the Government in return for completing the entrusted works. Toll revenues are \nnot  treated  as  NHAI  income  but  as  accounts  payable  to  the  Government.  Similarly,  interest \nreceived  on  unused  advances  is  not  treated  as  NHAI  income  but  is  recognized  as  a  capital \nsurplus or an increase to capital. As of FY2000, the main differences NHAI accounting practices \nand  statement  presentation  with  those  of  GAAP  in  India  are  detailed  in  NHAI\u2019s  notes  to  the \nfinancial statements.  \n \n49. \nThus,  while  in  accordance  with  government  reporting  requirements,  NHAI  financial \nstatements  do  not  provide  sufficient  information  to  appropriately  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of \n\n12 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n          13 \n\nNHAI\u2019s financial structure or financial performance. The lack of integrated physical and financial \nplanning  systems  and  integrated  accounting  and  financial  reporting  systems  does  not  support \nprovision  of  timely  information  to  management,  or  effective  cash-flow  management.  NHAI \nrecognizes  that  if  it  is  to  become  more  efficient  and  autonomous,  it  needs  to  strengthen  its \nfinancial  management  capacity  and  ability  to  mobilize  financing  in  domestic  as  well  as \ninternational financial markets. The envisaged TA18 will help NHAI address these issues.  \n \n \n50. \nNHAI  will  maintain  separate  project  (including  subproject)  accounts.  An  independent \nauditor acceptable and satisfactory to ADB will annually audit the project accounts and financial \nstatements  of  NHAI.  It  will  submit  unaudited  project  accounts  to  ADB  not  later  than  6  months \nfrom  the  close  of  each  fiscal  year,  and  the  audited  financial  statements  including  project \naccounts  not  later  than  9  months.  The  annual  audit  of  the  project  account  should  separately \ncover  the  imprest  account  and  SOE  procedure.  The  auditor\u2019s  opinion  on  the  imprest  account \nand SOE should be separately set out in the auditor\u2019s report. NHAI was made aware of ADB\u2019s \npolicy on delayed submission and also of the importance of satisfactory and acceptable quality \nof audited reports.  \n \n\n7. \n\nProject Supervision and Review and Reporting \n\n  \n51. \nA  project  inception  mission  will  be  fielded  soon  after  project  loan  approval  to  initiate \nimplementation.  The  Government  and  NHAI  will  periodically  review  the  Project  to  assess  and \nevaluate  the  scope,  implementation  arrangements  (with  due  participation  of  local  NGOs  and \ncommunity),  benefit  monitoring,  and  progress  and  achievement  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProject  Performance  Management  Systems  Handbook.  The  Borrower,  NHAI,  and  ADB  will \nundertake a midterm project review in May 2005. It will (i) review the project scope, design, and \nimplementation  arrangements;  (ii)  identify  changes  needed  since  project  appraisal;  (iii)  assess \nimplementation  performance  against  project  performance  indicators;  (iv)  review  resettlement \noperations; (v) review and establish compliance with the legal covenants; (vi) identify problems \nand constraints; and (vii) if necessary, recommend changes in project design or implementation \narrangements.  In  case  the  midterm  review  requires  changes  in  project  implementation,  NHAI \nand  ADB  will  agree  on  appropriate  measures, \nimplementation \narrangements, to ensure that project objectives are met. \n \n52. \nmonths after project completion, NHAI will provide ADB with a project completion report. \n\nNHAI will provide quarterly and semi-annual reports to ADB on project execution. Three \n\nincluding  changes \n\nin \n\n \n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation   \n\n \n53.  With  help  from  construction  supervision  consultants,  NHAI  will  monitor  and  evaluate \nproject  performance  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Project  Performance  Management  System \nHandbook.  NHAI  will  set  up  the  project  performance  management  system  within  3  months  of \nloan effectiveness. Primary monitoring indicators to be used by NHAI and reported to ADB will \nbe (i) percentage of roads without discernable congestion, to measure capacity expansion; (ii) \ninternational  roughness  index,  to  measure  the  riding  quality  of  project  roads;  (iii)  travel/transit \ntime,  to  measure  increased  efficiency  for  passenger/goods  transport;  (iv)  freight  for  trucking \nservice  and  intercity  fare  for  bus  services,  to  measure  reduction  in  transport  costs;  (v)  traffic \nfatalities, to measure increased road safety; and (vi) length of highway sections to be developed \nby the private sector for the entire E-W Corridor, to measure the extent of PSP.

The Project is classified as economic growth but not as a poverty intervention. A \nparticipatory  approach  was  taken  in  designing  the  Project,  including  consultation  with  local \ngovernments  and  communities.  NHAI  has  instituted  a  system  to  obtain  feedback  from  road \nusers  and  other  relevant  parties.  An  advisory  group  of  key  stakeholders  was  established  in \nOctober  2000  with  participation  of  representatives  from  trucking  industries,  the  public, \nautomobile  manufacturers\u2019  associations,  financial  institutions,  chambers  of  commerce,  state \ngovernments,  NGOs,  and  construction  and  consultancy  industries.  The  Advisory  Group  meets \nat  least  twice  a  year  to  deliberate  on  all  aspects  of  highway  operations  and  improvements  on \nhighway use. The Advisory Group expressed the need to (i) strengthen road safety measures, \n(ii) control overloading, (iii) prevent encroachment, and (iv) maintain highways.  \n  \n\n1.  \n\nResettlement and Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Issues \n\nfor \n\nfrom \n\nresettlement  plan \n\nthe  core  subproject \n\nCore  subproject.  A \n\n \n55. \nthe \nRajasthan/Madhya  Pradesh  border  to  Jhansi  (package  C),  covering  a  stretch  of  131  km,  has \nbeen prepared. The plan is based on an enumeration of all structures within the existing ROW \nwidth and on the land to be acquired for road widening, including the proposed 24 km Shivpuri \nbypass. The survey data indicates that the impact will be largely on roadside shops/businesses. \nA  total  of  859  structures  (residential/commercial)  will  require  demolition.  In  addition,  the  road \nwidening  and  improvements  will  affect  45  religious/community  structures.  Land  acquisition \nsurvey data have been collected to assess subproject impact on agricultural households. Over \n1,400  households  will  be  affected  by  loss  of  agricultural  land:  of  these,  123  families  will \nexperience loss of over 10% of their holdings while 14 will lose 75%.  \n \n56. \nAccording  to  the  revised  resettlement  plan,  construction  of  the  core  subproject  will \nrequire acquisition of an estimated 332 hectares (ha) (212 ha private, 84 ha forest, and 34 ha \nrevenue/government land). The bulk of land acquisition will be from the two ends of the Shivpuri \nbypass.  A  considerable  length  of  the  bypass  (about  12  km)  will  cut  through  protected  forest \nareas. Efforts have been made to minimize land acquisition and reduce resettlement impacts as \nmuch as possible by (i) keeping ROW to 45 meters (m) wide in built-up areas and reserve forest \nareas,  (ii)  adopting  concentric  symmetrical  widening,  (iii)  raising  carriageway  over  congested \nsegments,  and  (iv)  using  bypasses  to  avoid  congested  urban  settlements.  The  ROW  in  the \nbypass through the reserve forest will use the existing \u201cfire lane\u201d corridor to minimize the impact \non the forest. Statutory approval will be obtained for change in land use.  \n \nAs  per  the  resettlement  plan,  people  will  lose  residential,  commercial,  and  community \n57. \nstructures;  business  and  employment;  homestead  and  agricultural  land;  crops;  and  livelihood \nsources.  Nearly  70%  of  the  structures  are  pucca  (brick  and  cement)  and  the  rest  are  semi-\npucca  or  temporary  houses.  Over  40%  of  users  of  the  structures  (particularly  shops)  are \ntenants. Based on estimated incomes from all sources, about 15% of the households are below \nthe poverty line.  \n \n\n14 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n          15 \n\nThe summary resettlement plan (Appendix 10) provides further details about subproject \n58. \nimpact  and  measures  proposed  for  mitigation.

In addition to payments by the \ncompetent authority, affected people will receive additional grants to match replacement costs \nof  lost  assets  (land  and  houses),  transaction  costs  such  as  stamps  and  registration  costs  (in \ncase of purchase of replacement land), and other cash grants and resettlement assistance such \nas  shifting  allowance,  and  compensation  for  loss  of  workdays/income  due  to  dislocation. \nFemale-headed  households  and  other  vulnerable  households  will  be  eligible  for  further \nassistance in accordance with entitlement as detailed in the RP. \n \n59. \nTwo  resettlement  sites  have  been  identified  in  consultation  with  affected  people  and \nlocal administrations. The sites are close to existing settlements to minimize disruption. Affected \npeople will be given several options for relocation, including additional assistance. The sites for \nresidential  dwellers  will  be  developed  with  basic  amenities  (e.g.,  internal  roads,  sanitary/water \nsupply, community infrastructures, etc.). Displaced households have expressed their desire for \nself-relocation.  Besides  compensation  for  lost  assets,  families  requiring  relocation  will  receive \nshifting allowances for resettlement. NHAI disclosed the draft resettlement plan to the affected \npeople/local officials on 27 June 2003. The comments have been used to improve resettlement \nplan  entitlements.  The  project  director  (NHAI-Kota)  conducted  an  information  seminar  in \nSeptember  2003  to  disseminate  information  among  various  stakeholders,  particularly  district-\nlevel government officials in Shivpuri.  \n \n60. \nA  detailed  field  survey  was  undertaken  to  assess  the  socioeconomic  status  of \nindigenous  people  and  their  livelihood  sources.  The  most  important  scheduled  tribes  of  the \nproject area are the Bhil, Mina, and Saharia in Shivpuri, while a small number of Bhotiya inhabit \nJhansi district of Uttar Pradesh. The core subproject will directly affect only 13 households and \nshops  over  the  131  km  stretch.  Socioeconomic  and  occupational/income  data  suggest  that \naffected  scheduled  tribes  are  similar  to  the  overall  affected  population  and  largely  assimilated \ninto local mainstream communities. The scheduled and non-scheduled tribe population view the \nhighway  project  as  beneficial  as  it  will  likely  generate  more  business  and  economic \nopportunities. Improved transportation and connectivity will increase jobs. \n \nAs indicated earlier, scheduled tribes directly affected by the subproject are shop owners \n61. \nand  businesspeople.  Their  economic  activities  are  strongly  tied  to  mainstream  economic \nactivities, and unlikely to be affected any differently than non-tribals. As such, a separate IPDP \nfor  scheduled  tribes  is  not  needed.  The  resettlement  plan  paid  special  attention  to  scheduled \ntribes and other vulnerable groups within the resettlement processes, particularly livelihood and \nincome restoration, including a separate income restoration program for them. \n \n62. \nTo effectively manage resettlement and further strengthen ESDU, NHAI has engaged a \nmanager  for  resettlement.  NHAI  has  indicated  that  the  ESDU  will  also  engage  two  long-term \nstaff consultants from its own funds\u2014one for resettlement and one for environment from its own \nfunds\u2014to enhance its capacity for management and operations, and thus more closely involve \nESDU  staff  in  resettlement  management  and  supervision  of  NGOs/consultants in  resettlement \nplan implementation. A local resettlement specialist and ESDU will undertake training program \nunder the Project for NGOs and NHAI officials. \n \n63. \nNon-core  subprojects.  A  resettlement  framework  (Appendix  C-6)  and  an  indigenous \npeoples\u2019  development  framework  (Appendix  C-7)  will  serve  as  a  basis  to  prepare  subsequent \nresettlement  plans  for  non-core  subprojects  and  IPDPs  as  required.  The  frameworks  were \ndisclosed  in  the  project areas  in June  2003.  All  plans  will  be  prepared  in  full consultation  with \n\n \n\n\f \n2. \n\naffected  persons  and  disclosed  in  draft  form  to  them.  The  resettlement  and  IPDP  frameworks \nwill be placed on the ADB web site before submission of the Project for board approval.  \n \n64. \nBased  on  the  initial  checklist  and  social  assessment,  NHAI  will  determine  if  IPDPs  are \nrequired  for  non-core  subprojects.  NHAI  will  ensure  that  social  assessments  are  incorporated \ninto  the  subproject  design,  including  measures  to  minimize  or  avoid  resettlement  impacts  and \nimpacts on indigenous people who are dependent on land for their livelihoods. NHAI will screen \nand review resettlement plans/IPDPs for subprojects before submitting them to ADB. A qualified \nresettlement  specialist  has  been  included  in  the  technical  group  within  the  project  team  for \nsubproject evaluation and screening. \n \n\nHIV/AIDS and Trafficking in Women and Children  \n\nOver \n\nthe  past  decade,  HIV/AIDS  and  human \n\n \n65. \ntrafficking  have  become  major \ndevelopment  concerns  in  India.  The  Government  estimates  that  about  4  million  people  are \ninfected with HIV, including 500,000 with AIDS cases in 2002; 85% of transmission is through \nheterosexual sex, and condom use is still not a norm. This makes commercial sex workers and \ntheir clients such as truck drivers and helpers along national highway corridors among the most \nvulnerable  high-risk  groups.  The  increase  in  traffic  volume  may  mean  more  unsafe  sexual \nactivity unless strengthened and targeted interventions are in place. \n \n66. \nThe  centuries-old  phenomenon  of  trafficking  in  women  and  children  has  reportedly \nintensified  with  growing  economic  disparities,  increasing  number  of  migrants,  and  improved \ntransport and communication. Of human trafficking, 90% occurs within the country, with major \ncities  such  as  Delhi,  Kolkata,  Mumbai,  and  Ahmedabad  as  destinations  or  transit  points  to \nabroad.  Traffickers  target  the  most  desperate  and  vulnerable\u2014women  and  children  from \ncommunities  stricken  by  chronic  poverty  and  debt  and  by  natural  calamities  such  as  droughts \nand  floods;  and  from  scheduled  tribes  and  castes,  who  are  illiterate  and  have  few  life  skills \noutside  their  communities.  Deception  through  false  promises  of  better  jobs  or  false  marriage \nproposals  is  the  common  modus  operandi.  The  combination  of  the  economically  and  socially \nlow status of women and widespread poverty is at the core of the flesh trade. The known points \nfor  trafficking  include  local  roadside  teashops,  brothels,  construction  sites  and  quarries, \nfactories, bus terminals and railway stations, and urban streets.  \n \n67. \nThe  feasibility  study  projected  an  extremely  high  risk  of  an  AIDS  epidemic  and  human \ntrafficking.  The  project  areas  have  been  severely  affected  by  recent  droughts  and  have \ncommunities of economically and socially vulnerable scheduled castes and tribal groups (e.g., \nMeena,  Bedia,  Saharia,  Bhil).  Commercial  sex  areas  are  developing  along  the  corridors.  The \nimproved  connection  from  these  vulnerable  roadside  communities  to  major  cities,  and  the \nanticipated  increase  in  roadside  commercial  sex  activity  will  significantly  increase  the  risk  of \nHIV/AIDS and human trafficking. The influx of outside laborers (mainly male) during construction \nand  their  interaction  with  vulnerable  local  communities  and  access  to  roadside  teashops  will \nneed special attention. \n \nTruck  drivers  are  not  only  clients  of  sex  workers  but  also  reportedly  help  in  trafficking \n68. \nwomen  and  children.  Young  girls  are  brought  from  one  place  to  another  and  subsequently \nhanded  over  to  waiting  agents.  Meanwhile,  the  truck  drivers  themselves  drivers  shut  off  a \npossible avenue for these girls to return to normal life. In project areas, major traffic runs from \nnorth to south or vice versa, passing through Shivpuri along NH3 and also through Jhansi along \nNH26. East-west movement is much less frequent due to poor road conditions. However, once \n\n16 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n          17 \n\nthe E-W Corridor is completed, such movement will significantly increase, with the likely result \nthat HIV/AIDS and human trafficking will become more prevalent.  \n \n69. \nAs  HIV/AIDS  and  other  emerging  social  problems  such  as  poverty  and  indigenous \npeoples\u2019  lack  of  development  become  more  serious,  NHAI  has  strengthened  ESDU\u2019s \norganizational  structure by  engaging  a  general  manager  in  charge  of  these  issues. NHAI  also \nplans to engage a manager to handle emerging social problems and establish an ESDU cell to \ndeal with HIV/AIDS and human trafficking (para. 32).  \n\n \n3. \n\nRoad Safety \n\n \n70.  While contributing to economic growth, an improved road network can also lead to more \nroad accidents. National road safety statistics show a 5% annual increase of road accidents in \nthe past 2 years, with around 70,000 fatalities in 2001.19 The fatality rate per 10,000 vehicles is \n21,  which  is  twice  higher  than  in  some  other  Asian  countries  (for  instance,  10  in  Thailand). \nAbout  65%  of  all  road  accidents  occur  on  NHs;  83%  of  all  nationwide  road  accidents  are  the \nfault of drivers. About 50\u201360% of road traffic accidents involve heavy commercial vehicles such \nas trucks and buses.  \n \n71. \nThe  project  states  have  fewer  traffic  accidents  due  to  low  traffic  density.  Madhya \nPradesh had 58 fatalities per 1 million people in 2000, and Uttar Pradesh, 50\u2014lower than the \nnational  average  of  78.  However,  as  traffic  increases,  these  numbers  are  likely  to  increase \nsubstantially.  \n \nThe institutional set-up for road safety faces a number of problems. Coordination among \n72. \nvarious agencies is weak. While the National Road Safety Council was established in the late \n1990s,  it  does  not  function  effectively.  The  lack  of  effective  traffic  regulation  enforcement  is \nanother  problem.  Institutional  arrangements  for  enforcement  need  to  be  reexamined.  ADB \nintends to undertake soon TA20 on emerging social issues, a component of which will address \nenforcement and compare the current state police-based system and a possible network-based \nhighway police system.  \n \nThe establishment of an effective vehicle inspection system is another challenge. Based \n73. \non  the  Motor  Vehicle  Act  and  its  state  implementation  regulations,  vehicle  inspection  systems \nare already in place but ineffective. The Government (MORTH and other relevant agencies) and \nthe  private  sector  (automotive  industry  associations  and  other  parties)  have  jointly  taken  a \nsector initiative, in which ADB will actively participate.  \n \n74. \nFacilities  along  highways  such  as  rest  areas  should  be  improved.  The  Government  is \nexperimenting with several types of wayside amenities on a pilot basis (for instance, in Haryana \nand Tamil Nadu states), but the facilities appear not to cover a wide range of needs (including of \ntruck drivers, who need special small-scale rest areas).  \n \n75. \nRoad safety audits have been an integral part of ADB highway projects. Consultants will \nsoon be engaged to carry out safety audits on roads included in the Surat-Manor Tollway, West \n\n                                                 \n19 Government of India. 2003.

The scope of the consultants\u2019 work will be \nexpanded to include the Project.21  \n \n76. \nImplementation  of  the  above  actions  requires  a  comprehensive,  targeted  road  safety \npolicy.  A  policy  and  institutional  matrix  on  road  safety  (Supplementary  Appendix  A-3)  was \nprepared  and  discussed  with  the  Government  and  World  Bank  to  support  the  Government\u2019s \neffort to develop comprehensive action plans on road safety.  \n \n\n4. \n\nPoverty Impact \n\n \n77. \nThe overall objective of the Project is to connect the eastern and western ends of India \nvia  better  road  networks.  Although  not  designed  as  a  poverty  intervention  project,  the  Project \nwill,  by  virtue  of  passing  through  the  countryside  where  a  large  percentage  of  the  population \nlives  below  the  poverty  line,  help  reduce  poverty  by  encouraging  human  development  and \neconomic  growth.  Better  connectivity  with  mainstream  economic  regions  will  also  help  reduce \nregional disparities among fast-growing and backward states such as those in the northeast.  \n \n78. \n Project  roads  mostly  have  two  lanes;  some  have  only  one.  Poverty  levels  in  Madhya \nPradesh  are  37%,  and  in  Uttar  Pradesh  31%,  significantly  higher  than  for  India  as  a  whole  at \n26.1%. The project region is part of the Bundelkhand plateau, which has little or no productive \nland  and  low  rainfall.  Recent  persistent  drought  has  forced  migration  of  productive  labor  and \nencouraged  human  trafficking  and  the  commercial  sex  trade  in  vulnerable  sections  along  the \ncorridor.  A  separate  HIV/AIDS  prevention  and  anti-trafficking  program  will  be  implemented \nunder the Project. Scheduled tribes in the interior have taken to a nomadic lifestyle, moving and \nsettling along the road, seeking jobs.  \n \n79. \n Rural  inaccessibility  is  one  of  several  key  reasons  for  poverty  and  deprivation  in \nRajasthan,  Madhya  Pradesh  and  Uttar  Pradesh.  Their  rural  populations  are  widely  dispersed, \nmaking  road  connectivity  a  particularly  critical  factor  for  those  seeking  economic  opportunities \nand social services. However, past neglect of the road network overall has contributed to lack of \nrural mobility in the states. \n \n The Government\u2019s road sector policy is to establish an integrated road network linking \n80. \nlower  levels  of  road  systems  (rural  and  major  district  roads)  to  higher  levels  (state  roads  and \nnational highways) to connect rural communities to urban centers (vertical connectivity), which \nare,  in  turn,  connected  to  other  urban  centers  (horizontal  connectivity).  ADB  will  thus  provide \nloans for rural roads, major district/state roads, and NHs. While it will deal with the NH segment, \nthe  Project  will  also  improve  rural  accessibility  by  establishing  a  well-integrated  road  network, \nand thus help reduce poverty in project areas. \n \nImproved  road  networks  will  increase  long-term  economic  opportunities  of  rural \n81. \ncommunities  by  (i)  enabling  villagers  to  shift  from  subsistence  farming  to  market-oriented \nagricultural surplus production; and (ii) helping local people, particularly the youth, move out of \ntheir  communities  to  work  at  better-paid  jobs  in  manufacturing  or  commerce.  The  Project  will \nalso provide social benefits such as improved access to health, education, and social services. \nThe  Project  will  have  a  short-term  poverty  reduction  impact  as  the  rural  poor  are  hired  for \nconstruction,  tree  planting,  and  ensuing  maintenance  works.  These  opportunities  will  directly \nincrease  earnings  for  the  poor,  who  are  largely  dependent  on  occasional  and  temporary \nemployment. \n                                                 \n21 The need for an expeditious road safety audit was discussed during project appraisal.

With  this  modification  in \nalignment,  the  Project  was  reclassified  as  a  category  B  sensitive.  The  summary  IEE  was \nprepared for the core subproject and circulated to the Board on 4 August 2003. \n\n \n\n83. \nThe  park  bypass  goes  through  Chironji  Reserve  Forest,  where  diversification  of \nforestland  to  other  use  is  permitted  with  clearance  from  the  Ministry  of  Environment  and \nForests.  NHAI  prepared  the  IEE  report,  which  assessed  environmental  impacts  of  the  core \nsubproject  and  prescribed  environmental  mitigation  measures  as  part  of  the  environmental \nmanagement and monitoring plan. The subproject will have major environmental impacts during \nconstruction. The contractor will implement all required mitigating measures during construction. \nNHAI  will  ensure  that  the  measures  are  stated  clearly  in  contract  documents.  It  will  be \nresponsible  for  overall  implementation  of  the  environmental  management  plan  and,  therefore, \nthrough  its  construction  supervision  consultant,  will  supervise  and  monitor  implementation  of \nmitigation measures. ADB will also be given all access to undertake environmental monitoring. \nThe  total  cost  of  environmental  mitigation  measures,  including  the  tree  planting  program  and \nenvironmental monitoring, is about Rs70 million.  \n  \n84. \nNHAI  will  also  prepare  the  environmental  assessment  for  non-core  subprojects.  The \nprocedure  for  reviewing  the  IEE  report  has  been  established.  The  key  requirements  for  the \nenvironmental assessment for non-core subprojects are as follows:  \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nNo subprojects will pass through a designated national park or sanctuaries.  \nThe  IEE,  including  the  environmental  management  and  monitoring  plan,  will  be \nprepared for each subproject.  \nIf a subproject is less than 500 m from the border of a national park or sanctuary, \nthe  subproject  will  be  classified  as  B  sensitive,  and  the  summary  IEE  must  be \nmade public 120 days before awarding of construction works.  \nOnly subprojects that meet the Government\u2019s environmental requirements will be \nfunded by the Project.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n(v) \n\nAll environmental assessment documents should be properly kept as part of the \nproject document and made available to the public if required. \n\nEconomic Assessment \n\n \nC.  \n \n85. \nAn economic evaluation of the core section has been undertaken to compare the with- \nand without-project scenarios. In the with-project scenario, the upgraded four-lane highway will \nallow improved traffic flow, higher vehicle speeds, and shorter travel time, all resulting in lower \nvehicle operating costs (VOCs). Economic benefits estimated include VOC savings (as a result \nof better road conditions and increased vehicle operating speeds) for normal traffic,22 and time \nsavings for cargo transport. Economic benefits anticipated from savings in passenger travel time \nand reduced traffic accidents have not been included as they are difficult to estimate.  \n \n86. \nEconomic costs of implementing the Project are based on financial cost estimates, and \ninclude  civil  works;  environmental  improvement  works;  land  acquisition,  relocation  of  utilities, \nand resettlement costs; and construction supervision. Costs related to the HIV/AIDS prevention \nand  anti-trafficking,  and  road  safety  components;  taxes  and  duties;23  and  financing  charges, \nincluding  interest  during  construction,  have  been  excluded.  Nontradables  have  been  adjusted \nusing a conversion factor of 0.9. \n \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the core section is calculated at 22.9%. A \n87. \nsensitivity  analysis  of  the  EIRR  has  been  undertaken  for  changes  in  the  underlying  cost-and-\nbenefit  parameters.  Based  on  the  sensitivity  analysis,  the  Project  is  determined  to  be  most \nsensitive  to  a  decrease  in  estimated  project  benefits.  In  the  most  adverse  situation\u2014a \nsimultaneous increase of 20% in project costs (capital and O&M), a reduction of 20% in project \nbenefits, and a 2-year delay in project completion\u2014the combined EIRR is estimated at 16.2% \nper cent (Appendix 8).  \n \nD.  \n \n88. \nThe  core  section  was  also  financially  evaluated  to  assess  the  projected  toll  revenues \nagainst capital costs to improve and widen the road, and recurring costs for road operations and \nroutine and periodic maintenance over 30 years. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) for \nthe  core  section  is  calculated  at  6.8%,  above  NHAI\u2019s  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  in  real \nterms at 4.2%, and is most sensitive to reductions in tariff level and traffic assumptions, and less \nsensitive  to  changes  in  O&M  costs  and  delays  in  project  completion.  Verification  and \nappropriate  modeling  of  traffic  assumptions,  and  development  and  implementation  of  an \nappropriate  toll  strategy  will  be  critical  to  ensure  the  Project\u2019s  financial  viability  and \nsustainability. \n \nE.  \n \n89. \nA potential risk is the existing possible delay in project implementation due to prolonged \nland acquisition. The need for it is relatively limited. Most existing ROWs are broad enough to \naccommodate service roads and drainage lines. Land acquisition procedures were streamlined \nby the recent amendment of the National Highway Act, which will enable NHAI, to acquire land \nmore  expeditiously  and  predictably.  As  indicated  by  NHAI,  the  competent  authority  under  the \nNational  Highways  Act  of  1956  was  notified  in  September  2003,  notification  to  acquire  land  is \nexpected by February 2004, and detailed declaration of land acquisition by May 2004.  \n                                                 \n22 Normal traffic refers to projected traffic in the road corridor that will occur without and with the Project.  \n23 Value-added tax, customs, and duties are roughly estimated to equal 10% of the base cost. \n\nFinancial Assessment \n\nPotential Risk  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n          21 \n\n \n90. \nAnother  potential  risk  associated  with  project  implementation  is  possible  delay  in \nprocessing non-core subprojects due to the unfamiliarity of NHAI with procedural requirements \nof  ADB\u2019s  sector  loan.  Detailed  forms  of  summary  subproject  appraisal  report,  checklists,  and \nother  reporting  formats  have  been  provided  to  NHAI  to  facilitate  its  processing  of subprojects. \nTo strengthen its technical capability, NHAI has established a technical group of experts within \nthe  project  team,  covering  highway  design,  bridge  construction,  pavement  and  material, \neconomic  and  financial  analysis,  environmental  assessment,  resettlement,  and  PSP.  Project \npreparatory  TA  consultants  will  train  staff  of  the  project  team,  including  those  of  the  technical \ngroup  of  experts.  Such  action  and  support  will  minimize  the  chance  of  delay  due  to  a  new \nlending modality.  \n \n\n \n91. \nthe standard and usual assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents:  \n\nThe Government and NHAI have given the following specific assurances, in addition to \n\nV.  \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \nProject Implementation  \n\nA. \n \n\n(a)  Within 2 months of loan effectiveness, and in any case before the award of civil \nworks contracts under the subprojects, whichever is earlier, NHAI will ensure that the two PIUs \n(in  Kota  and  Jhansi)  and  the  project  team  are  adequately  staffed  by  experienced  managerial \nand  professional  personnel,  including  accounting,  financial  management,  and  resettlement \nexperts, during the entire period of project implementation.  \n\n(b) \n\nThe  PIUs  will  be  headed  by  project  directors  (at  the  level  of  general  or  deputy \ngeneral  manager)  assisted  by  deputy  general  managers/managers,  each  responsible  for  one \ncontract package or PSP component. An additional deputy general manager/manager of NHAI \nwill  be  assigned  to  each  PIU  and  be  responsible  for  overseeing  resettlement,  HIV/AIDS \nprevention,  and  anti-trafficking  activities;  and  for  handling  grievances  filed  by  the  public, \nincluding project-affected people and NGOs.  \n\n(c) \n\nNHAI  will  make  within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  adequate  arrangements \nfor coordination with MORTH and relevant state authorities for implementation of Road Safety \nComponent.  \n \nB. \n \n\nExecution of Civil Works \n\n(d) \n\nThat  NHAI  will,  subject  to  the  provisions  of  clauses  (u)  and  (aa):  (1)  acquire  or \nmake available on time (i.e., strictly in accordance with the schedule in the civil works contract) \nthe land and rights in land, free from any encumbrances; and (2) clear utilities, trees, and any \nother obstruction from such land on time as required for construction relating to each section of \nthe civil works contract under a subproject. \n\n(e) \n\nNHAI will ensure that subsequent to award of the civil works contract under any \nsubproject, no section or part thereof under the civil works contract will be handed over to the \ncontractor unless the provisions of clauses (d), (u), and (aa) have been complied with. \n \nC. \n \n\nRoad Safety  \n\n(f) \n\nNHAI  will  carry  out  road  safety  audit  for  the  subproject  highways  during \nconstruction  and  operation,  and  by  31  May  2006  develop  recommendations  for  other  parts  of \nthe NH system.  NHAI will also monitor incidence of traffic accidents on subproject highways to \nADB as agreed, during implementation and 2 years after the Project completion. \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\nD. \n \n\nOperation and Maintenance \n\n(g) \n\nNHAI  will  ensure  that  upon  completion  of  each  subproject  highway,  its  O&M \ncontracts  are  awarded  to  the  third  parties  under  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ensure \nsustainability  of  the  subproject  highways.  NHAI  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  the  terms  and \nconditions of the O&M arrangements. \n\n(h) \n\nThe Government will ensure that NHAI starts tolling the subproject highways as \nsoon as possible, and in any event within six months of construction completion. To achieve this \nthe Government will help NHAI in obtaining the statutory approvals and public notification of the \ntolling.  \n \nE. \n \n\nToll \n\n(i) \n\nNHAI will initiate a study on the toll system (as financed under a loan Loan No. \n1747-IND: Surat-Manor Tollway Project) by December 2003 at the latest, for implementation not \nlater than December 2004. \n\n(j) \n\nThe Government and NHAI will finalize arrangements so that NHAI will be able to \n\nretain tolls collected, as its own revenue from not later than 31 December 2004.  \n \nF. \n \n\nPrivate Sector Participation  \n\n(k) \n\nNHAI  will  ensure  that  at  least  10%  of  the  length  of  the  E-W  Corridor  to  be \n\ndeveloped under the Project will be under the PSP component.  \n\n(l) \n\nNHAI  will  identify  and  recommend  subprojects  for  inclusion  under  PSP  within \n\nthree months of loan effectiveness. \n\n(m) \n\nThe  Government  and  NHAI  will  ensure  that  the  subproject sponsors/bidders  for \nthe  PSP  Component  are  selected  in  a  transparent  manner  through  competitive  bidding \nprocedures under intimation to ADB. \n\n(n) \n\nNHAI  will  finance  and  take  necessary  steps  to  ensure  that  the  bidding  process \nand  award  of  contract  are  carried  out  on  time  so  that  the  PSP  part  is  completed  and \noperationalized along with the rest of the subproject highways. \n\n(o) \n\nNHAI  will  ensure  that  the  results  of  the  bidding  process,  negotiations,  and \nfinancial  closure  with  the  private  sector  are  reported  to  ADB  on  time  so  that  the  Government \nand ADB can take necessary and prompt action to complete the part(s) in case PSP does not \nfinalize. \n\n(p) \n\nNHAI  will  engage,  not  later  than  six  months  from  identification  of  the  PSP \n\nsubprojects, a financial adviser to help package PSP. \n\n(q) \n\nThe  Government  and  NHAI  will  ensure  that  in  the  selection,  construction,  and \n\nO&M of the PSP, all criteria and requirements are followed as required for subprojects. \n \nG. \n \n\nEnvironment \n\n(r) \n\nNHAI  will  implement  the  Project  in  accordance  with  ADB's  2003  Environmental \n\nAssessment Guidelines, as amended from time to time.  \n\n(s) \n\nNHAI will ensure that all subproject environmental mitigation measures identified \nin the IEE and summary IEE are incorporated into the detailed subproject designs and followed \nduring  construction  and  O&M  of  the  subproject  highways.  NHAI  will  also  ensure  that  the \nsubprojects  are  designed  and  constructed  according  to  the  environmental  management  and \nmonitoring plan agreed upon with ADB in accordance with its 2003 Environmental Assessment \nGuidelines, as amended from time to time. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n          23 \n\n(t) \n\nAny  subproject  classified  as  category  A  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  2003 \nEnvironmental  Assessment  Guidelines,  as  amended  from  time  to  time,  will  not  be  eligible  for \nfinancing under the Project. \n\n(u) \n\nNHAI will ensure that any subproject that involves acquisition of a section or part \nthereof  under  a  civil  works  contract  and  that  passes  through  forestland  and/or  needs \ndiversification  of  forestland  to  other  use,  statutory  clearances  under  the  1980  Forest \nConservation  Act,  and  environmental  clearances  under  the  1994  Indian  Environmental  Impact \nAssessment Notification shall be obtained before civil works start in that section.  \n \nH. \n \n\nLand Acquisition, Resettlement, and Indigenous Peoples \n\n(v) \n\nFor  the  core  subproject  the  Government  and  NHAI  will  implement  the \nresettlement  plan  agreed  upon  with  ADB,  in  consultation  with  the  concerned  state  and  district \nauthorities  and  with  people  affected  by  the  subproject,  in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s \napplicable  laws,  ADB\u2019s  1995  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement,  ADB\u2019s  1998  Handbook  on \nResettlement, and ADB\u2019s 1998 Policy on Indigenous Peoples all as amended from time to time. \nSimilarly for the non-core subprojects, NHAI will prepare and implement resettlement plans and \nIPDP as required, in accordance with the principles and procedures laid out in the resettlement \nframework  and  IPDF,  respectively,  to  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  approval  before  award  of  the \nrelated civil works contracts. Any changes required in the resettlement plan or IPDP based on \ndetailed subproject designs will be subject to ADB\u2019s approval before the award of any civil works \ncontracts.  \n(w) \n\nNHAI  will  ensure  that  people  affected  by  the  Project  are  consulted  and  fairly \ncompensated on replacement values such that their living standards are not adversely affected, \nin accordance with the resettlement plan. \n\n(x) \n\nNHAI  will  submit  the  progress  and  completion  reports  on  land  acquisition  and \n\nresettlement that will be included under the financial audit statements for each subproject.  \n\n(y) \n\nNHAI  will  disclose  the  resettlement  plans  for  the  subprojects  and  make  the \ninformation available to all affected people before land acquisition and resettlement, and confirm \nthat such information is posted on ADB\u2019s web site. NHAI will also ensure that essential public \ninfrastructure  that  may  be  affected  under  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  is  replaced \nappropriately and expeditiously in accordance with the resettlement plan. \n\n(z) \n\nTo  ensure  timely  monitoring  of  resettlement  plan  implementation,  NHAI  will \nappoint an independent monitoring expert within three months of loan effectiveness. The expert \nwill provide monitoring reports to ADB through NHAI once every six months. \n\n(aa)  Under  each  subproject  as  applicable,  NHAI  will  settle  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement compensation issues through (i) payment of full compensation/replacement value \nfor  land/structure  (residential/  commercial)  to  legal  titleholders  (ii)  payment  of  full  replacement \nvalue  of  structure  (residential/commercial)  to  affected  informal  settlers/roadside  squatters  (iiii) \npayment  of  full  compensation  for  acquired  land  to  titled  owners  and  (iv)  payment  of  all  other \nadditional benefits and provision of assistance in accordance with resettlement plan provisions, \nincluding income restoration grants and skill training during subproject implementation. \n \nI. \n \n\nSocial Measures \n\n(bb)  NHAI  will  ensure  public  awareness  and  acceptance  of  the  Project  and \nsubprojects through participation of NGOs and local community. To avoid the influx of informal \ndwellers and fraudulent claims during implementation, upon approval of each subproject, NHAI \nwill immediately (within not more than 2 months) commence issuing photo identity cards to all \neligible,  including  non-titled,  affected  persons. To  facilitate  timely  and  effective  implementation  \n \n\n \n\n\fand  monitoring  of  the  resettlement  plan,  NHAI  will  hire  NGOs  and  depute  resettlement-\nmonitoring officers in the PIUs.  \n\n(cc)  NHAI will set up grievance-handling units in ESDU and in each PIU, to address \nenvironmental,  resettlement,  and  other  social  issues  promptly.  Grievance  redress  committees \nwill  be  formed  in  accordance  with  the  resettlement  plan  and  resettlement  framework  in  each \ndistrict to resolve land acquisition and resettlement disputes.  \n\n(dd)  NHAI  will  ensure  that  civil  works  contracts  under  the  subprojects  incorporate \nprovisions  requiring  contractors  to  (i)  carry  out  HIV/AIDS  awareness  and  prevention  programs \nfor  labor;  (ii)  not  employ  or  use  children  as  labor;  (iii)  disseminate  information  at  worksites  on \nrisks of sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS as part of health and safety measures for \nthose employed during construction; and (iv) follow and implement legally mandated provisions \non labor (including equal pay for equal work), health, safety, sanitation, and working conditions. \nThe  contracts  will  also  provide  for  termination  of  the  contract  by  NHAI  in  case  of  breach  by \ncontractors of any of the provisions. \n\n(ee)  NHAI will set up within ESDU an HIV/AIDS prevention and anti-trafficking cell and \nengage qualified locally based NGOs to carry  out the HIV/AIDS prevention and anti-trafficking \ncomponent as agreed on with ADB. ESDU will supervise the NGOs and work closely with state \nagencies  such  as  AIDS  control  societies,  departments  of  women  and  child  development  and \nsocial welfare, and other networks dedicated to preventing HIV/AIDS, human trafficking and to \nempowerment of women and children. \n \nJ. \n \n\nSubproject Selection Criteria and Procedures \n\n(ff) \n\nNHAI  will  ensure  that  for  being  selected,  the  subprojects  follow  the  eligibility \n\ncriteria and procedures as agreed on with ADB as given in detail in Appendix 11. \n \nK. \n \n\nCondition for Award of Civil Works Contract \n\n(gg)  NHAI  will  not  award  any  civil  works  contract  under  a  subproject  unless  it  has, \nsubject  to  provisions  of  clauses  (d),  (u),  and  (aa),  (1)  acquired  or  made  available  the  land  and \nrights in land, free from any encumbrances; and (2) cleared the utilities, trees, and any obstruction \nfrom  such  land  relating  to  the  first  section  required  to  be  handed  over  for  commencement  of \nconstruction in accordance with the schedule as agreed under the related civil works contract.  \n \nL. \n \n\nCondition for Loan Disbursement  \n\n(hh)  The Government will have paid the front-end fee on the loan to ADB. \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \n92. \nADB  and  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the  provisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the \nArticles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board approve the loan of $400,000,000 to \nIndia for the National Highway Corridor (Sector) I Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources \nwith interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility;

63,140 km of rail; 12 major and 182 minor and intermediate ports; 4 major international \nairports; 86 domestic airports; and about 14,500 km of navigable inland waterway. The ratio of \nroad to rail transport has been continuously shifting as demand for transport services changes. \nRoad transport now accounts for over 60% of freight movement and  80% of passenger traffic, \nwith  rail  transport  accounting  for  much  of  the  remainder.  A  profile  of  transport  in  India  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix A-1. \n \nA. \n \n \n \n2. \nTransport planning, coordination, and policy setting at the central government level are \nhandled  by  several  line  ministries,  with  overall  coordination  by  several  agencies  such  as  the \nPrime  Minister\u2019s  Office,  Ministry  of  Finance,  Planning  Commission,  and  Public  Investment \nBoard. The Ministry of Surface Transport was reorganized in November 2000 into the Ministry of \nRoad  Transport  and  Highways  (MORTH)  and  Ministry  of  Shipping.  MORTH\u2019s  duties  are  to \ndevelop and maintain national highways (NHs), and formulate road transport policies. MORTH \ncoordinates  state  roads  and  issues  guidelines  on  highway  planning,  design,  and  construction. \nThe Ministry of Shipping is responsible for major ports, inland waterway transport, and shipping. \nAll  railway  planning  and  operations  are  under  the  Ministry  of  Railways.  The  Ministry  of  Rural \nDevelopment is responsible for policy development, monitoring, and coordination of rural roads \nbeing  funded  by  the  Central  Road  Fund  (CRF).  Airports  and  civil  aviation  are  under  the \nresponsibility of the Ministry of Civil Aviation. \n \n3. \nThe  responsibility  for  developing  and  maintaining  the  NH  system  rests  with  the  central \nGovernment,  while  state  and  district  roads  are  the  responsibility  of  the  state  governments.  To \nseparate  its  NH  planning  and  operation  functions,  the  Government  established  the  National \nHighways  Authority  of  India  (NHAI)  in  1988.  However,  it  was  activated  only  in  1995.  Its \nresponsibilities  include  the  Golden  Quadrilateral,  North-South  and  East-West  Corridors,  and \nseveral links to major ports and industrial centers. NHAI covers one fourth of the NH network, \nand  MORTH  is  responsible  for  the  rest,  with  state  public  works  departments  as  its executing \nagencies. \n \n \n \n4. \nThe road network is divided into NHs, state highways and major district roads, and rural \nroads  comprising  other  district  roads  and  village  roads.  The  national  and  state  highways \nfacilitate  mobility  between  states  and  also  between  districts,  while  district  and  rural  roads \nprovide the means to meet social needs and to transport agricultural produce to markets. The \nroad  network  grew  7.5  times,  from  400,000  km  in  1951  to  3.4  million  km  in  2001  (including \n230,000 km of urban roads and 1 million km of earth tracks to villages). Road density is now 1 \nkm/km2,  which  is  higher  than  in  other  developing  countries,  but  road  network  quality  and \ncapacity are grossly inadequate to meet present and future demand for freight and passenger \ntraffic and to connect all villages. \n \nThe NH network of 58,112 km carries about  40% of total road traffic. However, 33% of \n5. \nthis  network  is  still  single  lane,  65%  two  lane,  and  only  2%  four  lane.  Under  the  National \nHighway Development Program (NHDP) 1,400 km are planned to be upgraded to four lanes. \n\nRoad Network and Traffic \n\n2. \n\n\f \n28\n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\nFrom 1990 to 2000, annual passenger road transport grew at 7.8%, and freight transport \n\n \n6. \nby 7.6%, which was higher than the growth rate of the gross domestic product (GDP) of 6%.  \n \n\n3.  \n\nSector Investment Plan \n\n \n7. \nCapacity shortage of the NH systems has been a major problem. Out of a total network \nof  58,112  km,  39%  is  still  single  lane,  59%  two  lane,  while  four-lane  highways,  a  desirable \nstandard for arterial national corridors, account for only 2%. Faced with this capacity shortage, \nthe  Government  set  forth  a  major  investment  plan  to  improve  the  NH  systems.  Key  areas  of \ninvestment in the 10th Five-Year Plan (FYP, 2003\u20132007) are (i) widening of 22,000 km of two-\nlane roads to four-lane standard; (ii) construction of 2,000 km of expressways; (iii) widening of \n22,500  km  of  single-lane  roads  to  two-lane  standard;  (iv)  improvement  of  19,300  km  of \npavement; (v) construction of 1,200 km of access-controlled bypasses; and (vi) construction and \nrehabilitation of bridges. Total investment required to implement these programs is estimated at \n$37 billion. The program-by-program details are as follows: \n \n\nTable A2.1: Program Details \n\n \n\nCategory \n\nWidening from single lane to 2 lanes \nPavement strengthening of 2-lane roads \nWidening from 2 lanes to 4 lane or 6 lanes \nConstruction of expressways \nConstruction of access-controlled bypasses \n(average 20 km of bypass at $5 million per km) \nConstruction of bridges \nRehabilitation of bridges \nMiscellaneous (missing links, road safety, etc.) \n \n\nTotal \nkm = kilometers. \nSource:  Asian Development Bank staff. \n \n\nLength \n\n 22,522 km \n 22,000 km \n 19,250 km \n  2,000 km \n60 bypasses \n\n210 bridges \n425 bridges \n Lump sum \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\nEstimated Amount \n($ million) \n6,256 \n19,556 \n3,211 \n3,211 \n2,000 \n\n94 \n71 \n1,778 \n36,521 \n\nThe 10th FYP represents a major uplift of NH development programs compared with those of \nthe 9th FYP (1997\u20132002), which had aimed to (i) widen 944 km of roads to four lanes; (ii) widen \n1,791 km of single-lane roads to two lanes; and (iii) improve 3,042 km of pavement.  \n \n8. \nBecause of the magnitude of investments required, the Government has placed highest \npriority on the  National  Highway  Development  Program  (NHDP)  to  upgrade  three  key  arterial \ncorridors  in  10  years  (1998-2007):  (i)  Golden  Quadrilateral\u20146,000  km;  (ii)  North-South  (N-S) \nCorridor\u20144,000  km;  and  (iii)  East-West  (E-W)  Corridor\u20143,300  km.  Total  program  cost  is \nestimated at $13 billion, on which the Government decides to allocate the central road funds on \na priority basis. NHDP is expected to connect the entire country. \n \nIn  March  2003,  the  Government  announced  another  program,  comparable  to  NHDP  in \n9. \nterms  of  the  scale  of  investments  ($8  billion)  and  length  of  corridors  (10,000  km).  The  High-\nDensity  Corridor  Program  aims  to  rehabilitate  and  widen  2.0-  and  1.5-lane  corridors  with \naverage  daily  traffic  of  more  than  30,000  private  car  equivalent  units.  MORTH  identified  38 \nHDCs  qualified  for  the  Program.  It  was  intended  to  alleviate  traffic  congestion  along  these \ncorridors, which often have higher traffic density than those of NHDP. MORTH was designated \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 2        29   \n\nto  be  an  executing  agency.  The  Program  will  start  this  year  and  will  be  completed  in  7  years \n(including 2 years of construction).  \n \n10. \nAs  public  sector  funds  are  limited  (i.e.,  central  road  funds  will  not  be  available  for  the \nProgram  even  after  the  NHDP  completion  in  2007  since  the  funds  are  already  tied  up  for  the \nnext 10 years in debt service on market borrowings for NHDP), the Government will resort to the \nprivate sector by adopting build-operate-transfer (BOT) schemes for HDC development. Given \nthe  nature  of  HDCs  (which  have  been  used  for  decades  as  non-toll  roads),  tolls  cannot  be \ncharged on a full cost recovery basis. For this reason, the Government provides a grant to cover \npart  of  construction  costs  to  keep  tolls  at  a  level  affordable  for  various  groups,  including  local \ncommunities  (the  public-private  partnership  scheme).  Under \nthe  scheme,  prospective \ncontractors compete for toll concessions.  \n \n\n4. \n\nVehicle Fleet and Automobile Manufacturing \n\n \n11. \nIndia  had  300,000  vehicles  in  1950/51,  and  around  53  million  in  2000/01.  Buses \naccounted  for  1%;  trucks,  5%;  cars  and  jeeps,  13%;  and  motorcycles  and  scooters  (two-\nwheelers), 71%. The rest were mostly auto-rickshaws (three-wheelers) and agricultural tractors. \nThe  number  of  automobiles  has  been  growing  at  approximately  9%  a  year,  and  heavy \ncommercial vehicles, at 7.5% over the last 10 years. \n \n12. \nThe  automobile  manufacturing  industry  has  been  regulated  since  independence.  In \n1947, the Government declared that only indigenous firms operating according to an approved \nplan could manufacture motor vehicles. A vehicle-manufacturing industry was established using \ndomestic capital and little foreign technology transfer. Deregulation started with two-wheelers in \nthe  mid-1980s,  then  passenger  cars  and  commercial  vehicles  in  the  1990s  to  encourage \nproduction  of  more  fuel-efficient,  safer,  and  better-quality  vehicles  at  reasonable  prices.  In \n2000/01, 4.75 million motor vehicles were manufactured, 155% over the 1992/93 level, due to \nthe  unprecedented  increase  in  manufacturing  of  two-  and  three-wheeler  vehicles  from  1.50 \nmillion to 3.96 million. \n \n \n \n\nRoad Transport Services \n\n5. \n\na. \n\nRoad Freight Services \n\n \n13. \nThe private sector almost wholly operates road freight. The road freight service industry \nhas four tiers truck operators, brokers, truck owners, and truck drivers. Shippers usually contact \ntruck  operators  that  provide  trucking  services  themselves  or  use  trucks  provided  by  brokers. \nSince  they  have  limited  trucking  fleets,  these  truck  operators  usually  contact  cargo  brokers \nbased in  the  regions  from  which  cargoes  originate.  These  brokers  (usually  individuals)  then \ncontact truck owners (again,  individuals) or truck drivers, who  wait for cargoes at truck yards or \nalong  highways.  Truck  yards  are  on  city  outskirts,  and  most are informal and  surrounded by \nsmall buildings housing cargo brokers and small shops. \n \nTrucking operations are small: 77% of truck operators have fleets of five trucks or less. \n14. \nMost  are  family  businesses.  Truck  operators  with  fleets  of more than 20 account for only 6%, \nand many use trucks owned by other people, partly to avoid coming under the Motor Transport \nWorkers Act, which allows truck drivers to work 8 hours per day at most. Large fleet operators \nhave a network of branches and a  large market share: 12\u201315% of their business is handled by \ntheir own trucks, and the rest is provided by smaller truck operators or brokers.  \n \n\n\f \n30\n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\nThe  fragmented  structure  of  the  trucking  industry  is  a  major  impediment  to  its \n15. \nmodernization. Since they often have limited capital resources, individual truck owners are not \nwilling to invest in high-performance trucks such as multi-axel trucks, but use poorly performing \nlow-priced  trucks.  Larger  truck  operators  take  advantage  of  these  low-cost trucking  services. \nAlthough  still  limited,  changes  have  begun  to  take  place  in  container-haulage  operations  in \nwhich multi-axel vehicles are becoming the norm.  \n \n16.  Market  entry  is  not  restricted.  While  the  Motor  Vehicle  Act  requires  prospective  truck \noperators  to  obtain  a  permit,  the  regional  transport  authorities  usually  grant  permits  to  all \napplicants. The real function of the permit system is to facilitate collection of state motor vehicle \ntaxes  rather  than  to  control  trucking  operations.  Motor  vehicle  taxes  reportedly  account  for \nnearly 10% of state tax revenue. Freight rates are not regulated. Although the Motor Vehicle Act \ngrants  the  state  government  authority  to  set  freight  rates,  it  rarely  does  so  as  it  believes  that \nrates should be determined by the market.  \n \n17. \nsavings resulting from improved road conditions will mostly likely be passed on to the public. \n \n\nCompetition  among  trucking  operators  is  intense  and  any  vehicle\u2019s  operating  cost \n\nb. \n\nRoad Passenger Services \n\n \n18.  Main  operators  of  road  passenger  services  are  state  road  transport  undertakings \n(SRTUs), which serve villages, towns, and cities. Until the 1980s, SRTUs dominated passenger \ntransport service. However, their dominance has been declining due to the gradual introduction \nof competition policies announced by the Planning Commission. SRTUs owned 118,000 buses \nas of 31 March 2000, while private sector operators own 440,000 (based on vehicle registration \ndata). Active  in  urban  areas,  these  private  sector  operators  own  smaller  vehicles,  including \ntricycles. \n \nSRTUs\u2019  financial  performance  is  deteriorating,  with  large  deficits  being  registered \n19. \n(operating ratio is 77% for urban services, and 89% for rural and intercity services). Yet,  central \nand  local  governments  are  increasingly  reluctant  to  provide  subsidies,  which  has  led  to  fleet \ndeterioration.  \n \n20. \nPassenger  services  are  under  economic  regulation  and  safety  and  environmental \nregulation.  The  former  is  implemented  by  state  transport  authorities,  which  regulate  market \nentry  by  issuing  operation  licenses.  Service  requirements  (e.g.,  scope  of  business  operations) \nare stated in the operating permits. The authorities also regulate passenger service fares, which \ntend to be kept low due to political pressure.  \n \n21. \nRegional transport authorities are responsible for safety and environmental regulations, \nand safety inspections for passenger transport vehicles, their registration, issuance of licenses \nto professional drivers and conductors, and inspection of emission gas. \n \n22. \nCompetition  in  the  passenger  transport  service  industry  exists  but  is  regulated. Since \nfares  are  regulated  and  most  SRTUs  are  in  the  red,  the  benefits  of  vehicle  operating  cost \nsavings are less likely to be passed on to the public  \n \n\n                                                 \n1 D.P.

Transport  investments  have  accounted  for  about  13%  of  total  public  sector  spending \nunder the Government\u2019s 5-year plans.  \n\n \nTable A2.2: Five-Year Plan Expenditure in the Transport Sector \n(Rs billion) \n\n \nSubsector \nRailways  \nRoads  \nRoad Transport \nPorts \nShipping \nInland Water Transport \nCivil Aviation \nOther Transport \nTotal Transport \nTotal Public Sector  \nTotal Transport as age to Pubic Sector  \n\nVI Plan \n(1980-85) \n65.85 \n38.87 \n12.76 \n7.25 \n4.68 \n0.63 \n9.57 \n\u2014 \n139.61 \n1,092.91 \n12.80 \n\n\u2014 = not available. \nSource: Planning Commission, Government of India. \n\nVII Plan \n(1985-90) \n165.49 \n63.35 \n21.51 \n15.13 \n7.20 \n1.88 \n19.48 \n0.72 \n294.76 \n2,187.29 \n13.00 \n\nVIII Plan \n(1992-97) \n321.39 \n161.33 \n36.34 \n24.91 \n47.26 \n1.54 \n75.04 \n2.44 \n670.25 \n5,332.52 \n12.60 \n\nIX Plan \n(1997-2002)\n464.05 \n475.10 \n59.33 \n53.31 \n29.67 \n2.80 \n69.58 \n18.51 \n1,172.35 \n\n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n24. \nRoad expenditure increased 11 times, from Rs39 billion in the Sixth FYP (1980\u20131985) to \nRs475 billion in the Ninth FYP (1997\u20132002). The transport budget allocation increased about 7 \ntimes in the same period. The road sector\u2019s share of total transport investment also increased \nfrom  about  28%  in  the  Sixth  FYP  to  about  40%  in  the  Ninth  FYP,  reflecting  government \ncommitment  to  improve  highway  infrastructure  to  meet  the  demands  of  the  growing  economy \nand help reduce poverty. \n \n25. \nA central road fund had existed for years. The central Government revamped it through \ncess  (excise  duties)  of  Rs1  per  liter  of  petrol  (1998)  and  diesel  (1999,  through  the  CRF \nOrdinance). To institutionalize the revamped CRF, Parliament passed the CRF Act in November \n2000.  Another  increase  of  Rs0.50  per  liter  of  petrol  and  diesel  (50%  increase  in  cess)  was \neffected on 28 February 2003. These cess are expected to raise Rs90 billion ($1.8 billion) per \nannum.  According  to  the  allocation  formula,  and  assuming  Rs15.0  billion  is  raised  from  petrol \nand  Rs75.0  billion  from  diesel,  approximately  Rs37.5  billion  will  be  allocated  for  rural  roads, \nRs30.0  billion  for  NHs,  Rs16.0  billion  for  state  highways  and  major  district  roads,  and  Rs6.5 \nbillion  for  railway  crossings  and  other  purposes.  Unlike  a  typical  road  fund,  which  is  primarily \nused for maintenance, CRF will be used mainly to develop the road network. In the case of state \nhighways and major district roads, however, a portion may be spent on removing maintenance \nbacklog and rehabilitating badly deteriorated roads. \n \n\n \n7.  \n\nMaintenance \n\n \nNH  network  maintenance  has  been  neglected  due  to  inadequate  fund  allocation.  The \n26. \nNinth  FYP  doubled  the  allocation  for  maintenance,  but  the  maintenance  shortfall  in  FY2000 \nremained  at  practically  the  same  level  (50%)  in  FY2002.  MORTH  dealt  with  this  shortfall  by \nimproving riding quality. \n \n27. \nNHAI  maintains  its  NHs  primarily  through  a  private  contractor  (and  occasionally  by \nitself). Maintenance cost has been covered by budgetary support from the central Government. \n\n\f \n32\n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\nFaced  with  rapid  expansion  of  its  road  network,  NHAI  decided  to  explore  the  possibility  of \nintroducing asset management to maintain and manage its road network more systematically. \nNHAI  commissioned  a  study  under  World  Bank  funding  to  develop  the  concept  of  the  corridor \nmanagement units (CMUs). A key element of the CMU concept is to operate and maintain the \nroad network by contracting out to private contractors. A CMU also ensures the integrity of the \nright  of  way  by  maintaining  fences  and  markers,  controlling  overloading  of  trucks,  taking \naccident-prevention measures, removing obstacles on roads, controlling emission, and keeping \nnoise  within  acceptable  limits.  With  the  recent  completion  of  the  study,  two  pilot  CMUs  will  be \nestablished under the Third National Highway Project financed by the World Bank. \n \n28. \nNHAI\u2019s policy is to contract out operation and maintenance (O&M) as much as possible \nto the private sector. Under the Surat-Manor and Western Transport projects, advisory services \nwill be provided to develop performance-based O&M agreements with the private sector. \n \n\n8. \n\nEnvironmental Issues \n\n \nSince  1991,  the  Government  has  gradually  intensified  its  control  over  vehicle  gas \n29. \nemission. First-stage control was introduced for petrol-powered vehicles in 1991, and for diesel-\npowered  vehicles  in  1992.  The  Bharat  stage-1  emission  standards,  which  are  akin  to  Euro-1 \nstandards,  have  been  effective  throughout  the  country  since  2000.  The Government plans to \nintroduce  tougher  standards,  corresponding  to  Euro-2  requirements,  for  passenger  cars  and \ncommercial vehicles. Bharat stage-2 standards, which are close to Euro-2 standards, have been \nin force in the National Capital Region and are intended to be enforced shortly throughout the \ncountry. Leaded fuel has been gradually phased out from metropolitan cities since 1998 with the \nintroduction of unleaded fuel. Now petrol fuel is fully unleaded all over the country. Benzene in \npetrol  has  also  been  reduced  to  3%  all  over  the  country  and  to  1%  in  Delhi.  Since  December \n1998 commercial vehicles over 15 years old have been banned from Delhi\u2019s center. \n \nThe  ADB  has  been  working  with  the  Government  to  solve  road  sector-related \n30. \nenvironmental  problems  by  preventing  environmental  degradation  during  construction  and \noperation  of  highways,  for  example,  and  controlling  urban  traffic  pollution.  An  ADB  technical \nassistance2 on environmental management prepared highway project guidelines. They are now \nused  on  all  highway  improvement  and  reconstruction  projects  in  India.  ADB\u2019s  Second  Road \nProject3  studied  measures  to  control  traffic  pollution  in  urban  areas.  The  Central  Pollution \nControl Board then updated its mass emission regulations and enforced them more stringently.  \n\n                                                 \n2  ADB. 1993.

The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  the  core  section  was \ncalculated on the basis of incremental economic costs and benefits resulting from the Project \nover an assumed period of 30 years and a residual value proportional to the estimated remaining \neconomic life. Economic costs and benefits are expressed in 2003 constant prices. \n \n\n1. \n\nCosts \n\n \n5. \nThe  economic  costs  of  implementing  the  Project  are  based  on  the  financial  cost \nestimates,  and  include  civil  works;  environmental  improvement  works;  land  acquisition, \nrelocation of utilities, and resettlement costs; and construction supervision. Costs related to the \nprevention  of  HIV/AIDS1 and human trafficking, and road safety components; taxes and duties;2 \nand financing charges, including interest during construction, have been excluded. Nontradables. \nprimarily unskilled labor costs and domestically produced materials, have been adjusted to use a \nconversion factor of 0.90. \n \n6. \nThe  incremental  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  were  calculated  as  the \ndifference between maintenance requirements for the proposed new four-lane highway and the \nexisting  two-lane  highway.  In  the  with-project  scenario,  the  new  road  will  require  routine \nmaintenance  as  well  as  periodical  surface  renewal  (every  5  years) and a periodical structural \noverlay  (every  20  years).  In  the  without-project  scenario,  the  existing  road  will  require  routine \nmaintenance and periodical surface renewal only. \n \n\n2. \n\nBenefits \n\n \nIn  the  with-project  scenario,  the  upgraded  four-lane  highway  will  allow  improved  traffic \n7. \nflow, higher vehicle speeds, and shorter travel time, all resulting in lower vehicle operating costs \n(VOCs).  Economic  benefits  estimated  include:  VOC  savings  (as  a  result  of  better  roads  and \nincreased  vehicle  operating  speeds)  for  normal  traffic,3  and  time  savings  for  cargo  transport. \nEconomic  benefits  anticipated  from  savings  in  passenger  travel  time,  and  reduced  traffic \naccidents, have not been included as such savings are difficult to estimate.  \n \n8. \nUtilizing  the  highway  design  and  maintenance  4  (HDM4)  model,  version  1.3,  VOC  and \ntime  savings  for  cargo  transport  were  calculated  for  a  range  of  vehicle  types  and  road \ncharacteristics. Vehicle types include motorized vehicles (two wheeler, small car, medium-sized \ncar,  minibus,  bus,  light  truck,  medium-sized  truck,  heavy  truck,  and  articulated  truck)  and \nnonmotorized  vehicles  (cycle,  rickshaw,  and  animal  cart).  Operating  cost  estimates  assume \nlocal  driving  habits,  and  local  vehicle  and  road  conditions.

Major  assumptions  adopted  for  the  economic  assessment  were  summarized  in \nSupplemental Appendix E-3.  \n \nD. \n \n12. \nThe financial internal rate of return (FIRR) of the core section was calculated on the basis \nof incremental financial costs and benefits resulting from the Project over an assumed period of \n30  years  with  a  residual value proportional to the estimated remaining economic life. Financial \ncosts and benefits are presented in 2003 constant prices.  \n \n\n \n\n1. \n\nCosts \n\nimprovement  works; \n\n \nProject costs are comprised of capital costs and O&M costs. Capital costs include: civil \n13. \nworks;  environmental \nland  acquisition,  relocation  of  utilities  and \nresettlement  costs;  construction  supervision;  and  taxes  and  duties.  Capital  costs  are  to  be \nincurred over 36 months starting in 2004 and ending in 2007. O&M costs include annual routine \nmaintenance (estimated at Rs150,000 per km and periodic maintenance undertaken every five \nyears  (estimated  at  Rs5  million  per  km)  and  20  years  (estimated  at  Rs20  million  per  km  and \nimplemented over 2 years).4  \n \n\n2. \n\nBenefits \n\n \n14. \nToll revenues are based on the traffic levels and traffic growth rates presented in Tables \nA8.2  and  A8.3  and  have  been  projected  at  2003  constant  prices5\u2014Rs0.55  per  km  for  cars, \nRs0.96 for LCVs and minibuses, and Rs1.92 for trucks and large buses,6 assuming a capture \nratio of 75%. \n\n                                                                 \n4   Total O&M costs are roughly equal to 2.2% of capital cost per kilometer. \n5   Toll rates are assumed to be relatively inelastic given the general absence of easily accessible alternative roads \n\nand the small proportional cost of the toll compared to the total cost of vehicle O&M. \n\n6   2004 toll rates will be based on 1997 approved toll levels, annually indexed for inflation (by an inflation rate that \n\nis estimated at 4.65%).  \n\n\f  \n\n \n\n3. \n\nFIRR \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n          Appendix 8           \n\n43\n\nPoverty Impact Assessment \n\n \n15. \nBased  on  the  above  assumptions, the  FIRR for the core section is calculated at 6.8%, \ngreater than NHAI\u2019s marginal weighted average cost of capital (WACC) in real terms estimated \nat  4.2%.  NHAI\u2019s  marginal  WACC  was  estimated  on  the basis of the following assumptions: (i) \n88% government funding (of which 40% is from cess and 48% grants) at 7%;7(ii) 12% long-term \ndebt  at  11%;8  (iii)  domestic  inflation  of  5%,  and  NHAI\u2019s  application  for  tax-exempt  status  is \napproved. \n \n16. \nSeveral tests were undertaken to determine the sensitivity of the FIRR to changes in toll \nlevels, traffic capture ratio, traffic volume and traffic volume growth rate, O&M costs, and delayed \nproject completion. A sensitivity analysis was conducted for the case of 20% less traffic due to \ntoll introduction. FIRR is 5.2%, greater than NHAI\u2019s marginal WACC in real terms estimated at \n4.2%. The FIRR is most sensitive to reductions in tariff level and traffic assumptions and less \nsensitive to changes in O&M costs and delays in project completion. Verification and appropriate \nmodeling  of  traffic  assumptions,  and  development  and  implementation  of  an  appropriate  toll \nstrategy will be critical to ensure the Project\u2019s financial viability and sustainability. \n \n17.  Major assumptions adopted for the financial assessment are in Supplementary Appendix \nE-3. \n \nE. \n \nThe core project area has an estimated population of 605,792, with 200,737 living below \n18. \nthe  poverty  line.  The  potential  poverty  penetration  ratio  is,  therefore,  above  33%.9 With project \nroad improvements, anticipated VOC savings in passenger (bus) and freight (truck) transport in \na competitive environment will translate to decreased transport costs for the poor. \n \n19. \nThe  poor  account  for  about  80%  of  passenger  traffic  but  only  about  40%  of  freight \ntraffic.10 Along the core road bus traffic makes up about 20% of traffic volume, and truck traffic, \n70%. The estimated poverty economic impact ratio is 1.95, indicating that the total net economic \nbenefits reaching the poor as a result of the project are likely to be substantial.  \n \n20. \nExtending  the  poverty  impact  analysis  to  the  entire  East-West Corridor increases the \npopulation  living  in  project  area  to  3  million,  of  whom  approximately  876,000  live  below  the \npoverty line.

The  absence  of  adequate  road  infrastructure, \nincluding  connectivity  between  states,  has  long  been  considered  an  impediment  to  development, \nparticularly  for  transport  of  goods  between  states.  Road,  rail,  and  inland  waterway  development  are  all \nconsidered  to  be  integral  to  inter-  and  intrastate  development.  Infrastructure  development  encourages \nother development initiatives, which together considerably stimulate economic growth. \n \nB. \n \nThe  sector  loan  covers  a  total  distance  of  662  kilometers  (km),  rehabilitating  and  widening  an  east-west \nlinkage  from  Rajasthan  to  Uttar  Pradesh.  The  core  project  covers  a  distance  of  131  km  from  the \nRajasthan-Madhya Pradesh border to Uttar Pradesh. \n \nThe  main  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  connect  the  eastern  and  western  ends  of  India  via  better  road \nnetworks.  Although  not  designed  as  a  poverty  intervention  project,  the  Project  will,  by  virtue  of  passing \nthrough  the  countryside  where  a  large  percentage  of  the  population  lives  below  the  poverty  line,  help \nreduce  poverty  by  encouraging  human  development  and  economic  growth.  Better  connectivity  with \nmainstream economic regions will also help reduce regional disparities among  fast-growing and backward \nstates such as those in the northeast.  \n \nProject  roads  are  mostly  two  lanes  and,  in  some  parts,  single  lane.  Due  to  disrepair,  a  road  may  remain \nflooded  during  the  monsoon  season  for  up  to  4  months  which  increases  people\u2019s  hardship  and  loss  of \nworkdays  by  the  poorest.  Poverty  levels  in  Madhya  Pradesh  and  Uttar  Pradesh  are  37%  and  31%  \nrespectively,  significantly  higher  than  for  India\u2019s  average  of  26.1%.  The  project  region  is  on  the \nBundelkhand plateau, which has little or no productive land and low rainfall. More than three fourths of the \nProject  is  in  Madhya  Pradesh,  with  only  20  km  in  Jhansi  district  in  Uttar  Pradesh.  The  proposed  road \nimprovement passes through 51 rural settlements and 3 urban areas. In Madhya Pradesh, life expectancy \nis 44 years at birth as opposed to the national average of 61, infant mortality rate is 125 compared to 68, \nand less than 10% of houses have access to safe drinking water compared to 62%. \n \nRecent persistent drought has forced migration of productive labor and encouraged human trafficking and \nthe  commercial  sex  trade  in  vulnerable  sections along the corridor. A separate HIV/AIDS prevention and \nanti-trafficking program will be implemented under the Project. Scheduled tribes in the interior have taken \nto  a  nomadic  lifestyle,  moving  and  settling  along  the  road,  seeking  jobs.  Average  landholding  is  2.5 \nhectares, most of it unirrigated, and landless families predominate.  \n \nAn estimated 600,000 people reside within the corridor of influence, of whom about 200,000 are below the \npoverty line.  The  estimated  annual  per  capita  income  of  those  living below the poverty line is less than \n$100,  in  each  of  the  three  states,  reflecting  an  average  daily  income  of  about  $0.30.

Their rural populations are widely dispersed, making road connectivity a particularly critical factor \nfor  those  seeking  economic  opportunities  and  social  services. 1  However,  neglect  of  the  road  network \noverall has also hampered rural mobility in all three states. \n \nStudies  conducted  during  preparation  of  the  recently  approved  Madhya  Pradesh  State  Road  Sector \nDevelopment Project of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for example, found that outdated institutional \narrangements  had  led  to  most  of  the  state  road  sector  budget  being  spent  on  personnel  instead  of \nmaintaining  and  developing  the  roads.  Road  connectivity  is  very  poor,  estimated  at  22%  in  Madhya \nPradesh\u2014one  of  the  lowest  of  all  the  states.  The  ADB-financed  Madhya  Pradesh  road  project  will \nrehabilitate  about  1,750  km  of  state  highways  and  rural  connector  roads  identified  as  significant  road \ncorridors.  The  focus  on  rural  and  state  roads  to  develop  internal  and  interstate  connectivity,  and \nimprovement  of  national  highways  to  enhance  interstate  connectivity  will  contribute  to  the  overall  well \nbeing of the local population. The proposed India rural road sector project, through provision of all-weather \nroad  connectivity,  is  expected  to  directly  benefit  some  71,127  rural  villages  in  Madhya  Pradesh  and \nChhattisgarh.  Finally,  the  cost  of  travel  is  also  considered  high,  especially  for  those  living  below  the \npoverty  line.  The  minimum  fare  of  Rs10,  by  local  bus,  is  close  to  a  full  day\u2019s  income  for  persons  in  this \ngroup, with the freight rate at 90 rupees/quintal, equivalent to 3 days' work. Nonetheless, about 80% of the \npassenger and about 50% of freight traffic come from this group. Table A9.2 indicates rural access roads \nwithin the project corridor.  \n \n\nTable A9.2: Rural Access Roads \n\nProject Corridor \n\nNo. of Roads \n\nNH-25 \nNH-3 \nNH-76 \nTotal \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n Left \n11 \n  8 \n14 \n33 \n\n  Right \n33 \n10 \n18 \n61 \n\n \n \n \n \n\n            NH = national highway. \n\n \nRoad  development  offers  opportunities  for  development  to  be  brought  to  the  region  and  for  local \ncommunities to move in and out of the region, fostering the pull and push of economic development. In the \nimmediate  project  influence  areas,  development  opportunities  are  supported  by  providing  people  with \naccess  to  economic  opportunities,  links  to  better-priced  markets,  jobs,  and  better-quality social and other \npublic  services,  as  well  as  short-term  project-related  employment.  Equally  important  is  the  fact  that  the \nProject will have indirect impacts on poverty reduction by improving transport efficiency and outreach, thus \nincreasing  incomes  and  jobs;  and  also  generating  higher  tax  revenues  to  support  the  state  governments\u2019 \nprograms  for  economic  growth,  poverty  reduction,  and  human  development.  Some  of  the  mechanisms \nthrough  which  the  Project  may  be  expected  to  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  include  (i)  growth  in \n                                                 \n1   In 2001, the population density of Rajasthan was 165/square kilometer (km 2) and that of Madhya Pradesh 195/km 2, \n\ncompared with 324/km 2 nationally.  \n\n\f \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n  \n\nAppendix 9\n\n47\n\nagricultural  incomes  due  to  access  to  higher-priced  markets,  ability  for  the  first  time  to  transport \nhorticultural  and  other  high-value  produce  to  market,  and  reduced  spoilage;  (ii)  growth  of  the  local \neconomy,  leading to increased incomes and jobs;  (iii) ability to travel to work outside the community; (iv) \nreduction  in  prices  of  consumer  goods  and  services  due  to  lower  transport  cost;  (v)  improved  health  and \nlongevity  due  to  improved  access  to  hospitals  and  health  services  (particularly  for  births);  (vi)  improved \neducation  due  to  improved  access  to  schools  (including  post-primary  schooling),  improved  capacity  to \nattract qualified school teachers, and more frequent supervision visits by school inspectors; (vii) improved \naccess  to  agricultural,  veterinary,  and  other  extension  services;  and  (viii)  improved  opportunities  for \nparticipation in the wider society outside the villages. \n \nConsiderable  potential  for  tourism  also  exists  in  Madhav  National  Park,  King  George  Castle,  Survaya \nFortress  (with  its  palace  and  temples),  Jhansi  Fort  and  Museum,  and  Rocha  Fort  complex  (with  its  three \npalaces and sacred pilgrim sites).  \n \nImproving  roads;  rationalizing  congested  areas  with  junctions,  truck  stops,  and  lay -bys,  improving  traffic \nflow;  and  providing  service  roads  in  congested  locations  will  bring  immediate  benefits  to  roadside \ncommunities and non-motorized road users. \n \nThe  project  beneficiaries  will  include  the  rural  population  of  the  two  states:  (i)  direct  users  of  road \ntransport,  including  owners  and  operators  of  buses  and  trucks,  passengers  of  the  various  vehicle \ncategories, labor, and the Government; (ii) those benefiting indirectly because they live in the roads\u2019 area \nof  influence;  and  (iii)  those  benefiting  indirectly  through  the  wider  impacts  of  higher  economic  growth  in \ntheir districts and in the states as a whole. Some expected positive impacts include the following: \n \n(i)  Agricultural  diversification  often  rapidly  follows  provision  of  all-weather  road  access  to  district \nmarkets, potentially increasing incomes of farmers. Milk and vegetable production can potentially increase \nannual incomes of marginal farmers by Rs4,000\u2013Rs8,000 a year or more, of small farmers by Rs20,000 or \nmore,  and  farmers  with  medium-sized or large holdings by Rs50,000 or more.  Increased  nonagricultural \ninvestment  mainly  by  the  nonpoor  is  also  likely  in  enterprises  ranging  from  small  shops  and  service \nbusinesses to transport enterprises. \n\n(ii)  Social  service  delivery,  access,  and  improved  social  status  of  the  villages  is  another  positive \nimpact resulting from road connectivity with increased attendance by teachers, health personnel, and more \nfrequent  supplies  for  various  government  poverty  relief  programs.  Access  to  social  services  beyond  the \nvillage  tends  to  improve  as  well  because  better  transportation  services  make  distant  services  accessible \ndaily  the  whole  year  round.  Attendance  at  middle  and  high  schools  outside  the  village  also  increases. \nSurveys  of  all  groups,  including  the  poorest,  indicate  significant  benefits  resulting  from  road  upgrading,  in \nparticular by increasing the social status of the village and the families living there. \n\n(iii)  Gender  impacts  are  positive,  with  improved  connectivity  and  transportation,  which  enhances \nconditions  and  opportunities  to  raise  the  social,  educational,  and  health  status  of  girls  and  women,  and \nimprove  conditions  for  safe  motherhood.  More  girls  are  likely  to  be  sent  to  high  school  outside  the  village \nwhen  transport  services  are  improved,  and  generally  women  have  been  found  to  benefit  from  more \nfrequent contact with their families in distant locations. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(iv) Poverty reduction results from provision of upgraded all-weather roads in recent years, (specifically in \nMadhya  Pradesh.  Control  studies  confirmed  that  such  projects  decrease  poverty  by  removing  economic \nand  social  development  barriers  created  by  isolation.  Some  landless  households  benefited  from \nopportunities to invest in raising cows and operate roadside stalls. Lower  passenger fares and freight rates \nimproved  social  and  economic  prospects,  and  increased  economic  opportunities  to  participate  in  civil \nworks during construction. \n \n \n \n \n\n\f48\n\n \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nC. \n\nParticipation Process \n\n \nThe project technical design is continually influenced by community discussions and consultations. Service \nroads,  severance  impacts,  safety  considerations,  and  designing  rest  and  truck  stops  are  based  on \ntechnical and social considerations.

Package  C  (Rajasthan/Madhya  Pradesh  border  to  Jhansi\u2014132 km) \nhas been selected as the core subproject for loan processing.  \n \nNHAI is the Executing Agency of the Project. NHAI prepared a draft resettlement plan for \n3. \nthe  core  subproject  (i.e.,  package  C)  in  June  2003.  The  resettlement  plan  has  been  revised \nbased on new data on land acquisition and structure surveys, with particular attention to impacts \non farm families and tenant households caused by the Shivpuri bypass. For non-core projects, a \nresettlement  framework,  based  on  ADB  policy  guidelines,  has  been  approved  by  NHAI  for \nresettlement plan preparation.  \n \nB. \n\nPackage C\u2014Project Impacts \n\n4. \nPackage C consists of three sections and will improve and upgrade 131 km of highways \n(National  Highway  (NH)  76,  and  NH25)  from  Shivpuri  to  Jhansi  (Table  A10.2).  Improvement \nactivities include widening the  3 stretch to four lanes, and improving junctions, underpasses, a \nfly-over,  and  a  major  bypass  to  avoid  urban  settlements  and  congestion.  The  four-lane \ncarriageway is designed for an average of 100 km/hour.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n50\n\nAppendix 10 \n\nRoad \nSection \nSection 1 \nSection 2 \nSection 3 \n\nTable A10.2: Package-C Roads \n  \nRoads \n\nLength \n(km) \n55  \n26  \n52  \n\nNH 76, km 579\u2013km 609 MP Border (includes Shivpuri bypass) \nkm 15\u2013km 40 (includes Sind River Bridge \u2013 new approach)  \nkm 40\u2013km 92 (includes River Mahuar Bridge  \u2013 new approach) \n\nkm = kilometers, MP = Madhya Pradesh, NH = national highway. \nSource: Asian Development Bank staff. \n\n \n \n \n5. \nThe existing right of way (ROW) of the NHs varies from 30 to 50 meters (m). Widening to \nfour  lanes  will  require  additional  land  in  several  sections  beyond  the  existing  ROW. \nImprovements will be confined to 45 m in built-up areas and 60 m in case of the new bypass. \nThe Project area traverses 25 villages and settlements, including the Shivpuri bypass. A major \npart  of  the Project  is  within  Shivpuri,  Madhya  Pradesh,  while  few  settlements  along  NH25  are \nwithin Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh, bordering the Jhansi Development Authority Area.  \n \nThe construction of the project highway sections will require acquisition of an estimated \n6. \n332 hectares (Table A10.3). The bulk of land acquisition will be for section 1, particularly for the \nShivpuri bypass, involving forest, revenue/government, and privately owned agricultural land at \nthe  two  approach  ends.  Efforts  have  been  made  to  minimize  land  acquisition  and  reduce \nresettlement  impacts  as  much  as  possible  by  (i)  keeping  ROW  to  45  m  in  built-up areas; (ii) \nadopting  concentric  symmetrical  widening;  (iii)  raising  carriageway  over  congested segments, \nand  (iv)  building  bypasses  to  avoid  congested  urban  settlements.  Further  efforts  to  minimize \nproject impacts will be made during final design and project implementation.  \n \n\nTable A10.3: Land Acquisition by Road Sections \n \n\nRoad \n\nArea in ha \n\nRoad \nSection \nSection 1 \nSection 2 \nSection 3 \n\nNH76\u2013Km 579 to 609 and Shivpuri bypass \nNH 25\u2013Km 14 to 40 (includes Sind Bridge) \nNH 25\u2013Km 40 to 92 (includes Mahuar) \nrealignment)  \n \nha = hectares, NH = national highway. \nSource:  As ian Development Bank staff. \n\nTotal \n\n194.84 \n45.71 \n90.91 \n\n331.46  \n\n \n \n \nA  complete  enumeration  of  all  structures  within  the  45  m  ROW  was  conducted  in  two \n7. \nphases  in  April-May  and  early  June  2003,  to  assess  the  loss  of  assets  and  the  number  of \naffected farm families/households and shops/businesses.

Nearly  70%  of  the  structures  are  pucca  (brick  and  cement)  and  the  rest  are  semi-\npucca and kuccha. About 40% of the structure users (particularly of shops) are tenants. Based \non the estimated incomes from all sources, about 15% of the households are below the poverty \nline.  \n \nA  detailed  field  survey  assessed  the  socioeconomic  status  of  indigenous  people  and \n9. \ntheir  livelihood  sources.  The  most  numerous  scheduled  tribes  of  the  project  area  are  the  Bhil \nand Saharia in Shivpuri district, while a small number of Bhotiya inhabit Jhansi. Other important \ntribes in the region include the Agariya, Korku, Sonar, and Gond. Among the indigenous/tribal \ngroups,  the  Saharia  are  more  visible.  Socioeconomic  and  occupational/income  data  clearly \nsuggest  that  the  project-affected.  Scheduled  tribes  (STs)  are  similar  to  the  overall  affected \npopulation and are largely assimilated into the local mainstream communities.  \n \nOnly 13 tribal households/shop owners are likely to be affected over the 132 km stretch \n10. \nof  the  highway.  Survey  data  confirmed  that  they  have  the  same  general  pattern  of  activity  as \nnon-tribals. For example, 58% of tribals are involved in agriculture as cultivators and laborers. \nSome  combine  agriculture  with  small  business  while  about  15%  derive  their  livelihood  solely \nfrom trade and non-farm activities. Few depend on forest products. ST and non-ST populations \nboth  view  the  highway  project  as  beneficial  as  it  will  likely  generate  more  business  and \neconomic opportunities. The improved transportation and connectivity will increase jobs.  \n \nAffected  ST  populations  engage  in  economic  activities  that  are  strongly  tied  to \n11. \nmainstream ones and will unlikely be affected differently than non-tribals. A separate Indigenous \nPeople  Development  Plan  (IPDP)  for  the  STs,  therefore,  is  not  needed.  However,  given  their \nhigher incidence of poverty (about 40%), scheduled tribes and other vulnerable groups will need \nadditional  assistance.  The  revised  resettlement  plan  emphasized  ST  issues,  with  special \nattention  to  livelihood  and  income  restoration,  including  a  separate  program,  for  STs  and \nvulnerable groups. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n52\n\nAppendix 10 \n\nResettlement Principles and Entitlement Matrix \n\nC. \n \n12. \nThe resettlement principles and entitlements are derived from the National Highways Act \n(1956) and ADB\u2019s policy on  Involuntary Resettlement (1995) and other safeguard policies. The \nprinciples establish eligibility and provisions for all types of losses (land, crops/trees, structures, \nbusiness/employment,  and  workdays/wages).  For  example,  affected  people  will  be \ncompensated  fully  to  replace  all  lost  assets.  Besides payments by district collectors, affected \npersons (APs) will receive additional grants to match replacement costs for lost assets (land and \nhouses),  transaction  costs  such  as  stamps/registration  costs  (in  case  of  purchase  of \nreplacement  land),  and  other  cash  grants  and  resettlement  assistance  such  as  shifting \nallowance  and  compensation  for  loss  of  workdays/income  due  to  dislocation.  Female-headed \nhouseholds  and  other  vulnerable  households  will  be  eligible  for  further  cash  assistance  for \nrelocation  and  house  reconstruction.  Table  A10.5  outlines  the  entitlement  in  the  form  of  a \nmatrix.  It  incorporates  some  lessons  from  ongoing  NHAI  projects,  particularly  in  income \nrestoration and other livelihood/training programs for economic rehabilitation of affected  people, \nparticularly those below the poverty line. \n \n13. \nResettlement sites for relocation of shops/business and affected households have been \nidentified  in  consultation  with  APs  and  local  administration.  The  sites  are  close  to  the  existing \nsettlements, which will minimize disruption during relocation. APs will be given several options \nfor  relocation,  including  additional  assistance.  The  sites  for  residential  dwellers  will  be \ndeveloped  with  basic  amenities  (e.g.,  internal  roads,  sanitary/water  supply,  community \ninfrastructures,  etc.).  Households  affected  by  land  acquisition  have  expressed  their  desire  for \nself-relocation.  In  addition  to  compensation  for  lost  assets,  families  requiring  relocation  will \nreceive shifting allowances for resettlement and income restoration support. \n \nD. \n \nAt various stages of project planning, affected people have been informed and consulted \n14. \nabout \n(i)  heads  of \nthe \nhouseholds/businesses  to  be  affected;  (ii)  affected  people  in  small  groups;  (iii)  village \npanchayat,  sarpanch,  and  members;  (iv)  local  voluntary  organizations  and  nongovernment \norganizations; (v) government agencies and departments; and (vi) women and other vulnerable \ngroups.  A  consultation  plan  to  disseminate  information  and  involve  APs  and  host  populations \nhas been adopted.  \n \nThe  draft  resettlement  plan  was  disclosed  among  APs  and  other  stakeholders  at  the \n15. \nproject site in June 2003. The adequacy of the entitlement and mitigation policies were reviewed \nand  discussed  by  project  officials.  Stakeholders\u2019  comments  have  been  used  to  minimize \nimpacts  through  alternative  options/road  realignments  and  improvements  in  the  policy  and \nentitlement  matrix.  The  project  director  (NHAI-Kota)  responsible  for  project  preparation  at  the \nfield  level  will  conduct  an  IEC  in  mid-September  in  Shivpuri  to  further  disseminate  information \non the project.  \n \nAPs  will  be  involved  in  resolving  any  dispute  or  grievance  with  regard  to  resettlement \n16. \nplan implementation and benefits.  The grievance resolution committee will comprise the project \ndirector  (NHAI);  district  commissioner  or  his  or  her  representative;  representatives  of  affected \npeople (male and females); local government/panchayat representative; resettlement officer for \nthe project section (NHAI); local land acquisition officer; and NGO representative implementing \nthe resettlement plan. GRC claims will be reviewed and resolved within 3 weeks from the date \nof submission to the local committee. \n\nStakeholder Participation, Disclosure of Resettlement Plan, and Grievances \n\nimpacts.

NHAI  will  engage  qualified  and  experienced  NGOs  to \nimplement the resettlement plan. They will play an important role in the information campaign on \nresettlement plan policies/entitlements, disbursement of compensation packages as described \nin  the  matrix,  ensure  redressal  of  legitimate  grievances  by  APs,  and  pay  special  attention  to \nvulnerable groups. \n \n18. \nFor  effective  management  of  resettlement  and  to  further  strengthen  ESDU,  NHAI  will \nsoon engage a manager for resettlement. In addition, as indicated by NHAI ESDU will engage \ntwo  long-term  staff  consultants  form  its  own  funds\u2014one  for  resettlement  and  one  for \nenvironment\u2014to  enhance  its  capacity  for  management  and  operations.  For  future  projects, \nNHAI  has  agreed  to  engage  consultants  for  resettlement  planning  separately  from  detailed \nproject report/engineering consultants. This will more closely involve ESDU staff in planning of \nresettlement and supervision of consultants in resettlement plan development.  \n \n19. \n A  resettlement  unit  will  be  established  within  the  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  for \nproject-level  resettlement  plan  implementation.  The  project  director  of  the  PIU  will  head  the \nresettlement  unit.  A  full-time  NHAI  officer  will  be  in  charge  of  resettlement  and  rehabilitation \n(R&R),  including  supervision  of  the  NGO  work  in  the  field.  The  resettlement  consultant  of  the \nproject technical team will provide technical support to the PIU and the R&R officer in terms of \ncoordination  and  supervision  of  NGO  work  in  the  field  as  well  as  help  all  committees  at  the \ndistrict  level  resolve  resettlement  issues.  NHAI  will  conduct  a  short  training  program  for  R&R \nofficers before project implementation.  \n \n20. \nThe  total  budget  for  R&R  is  Rs379.65  million,  including  cost  for  land  acquisition, \nresettlement/income  restoration,  and  other  administrative/logistic  costs,  including  monitoring \nand evaluation. Resettlement, including land acquisition, will take 36 months. Compensation for \nacquired  assets  will  be  paid  before  construction.  The  resettlement  site  will  be  provided  before \nrelocation. Social development and income restoration will be based on needs assessment and \nconsultation  with  beneficiary  groups.  The  budget  provides  for  separate  provisions  for  income \nrestoration activities and assistance to vulnerable groups.  \n \nF.  \n \nThe resettlement plan will have internal and external monitoring. Methods are specified \n21. \nin  the  resettlement  plan.  Internal  monitoring  will  be  done  by  the  PIU-ESDU.  It  will  monitor \ncompliance  with  the  principles  and  matrix  set  out  in  the  resettlement  plan,  payment  of \ncompensation,  compensation  record,  completion  of  compensation  before  construction,  job \ncreation, information dissemination, and settling of GRC grievances.  \n \n22. \nIndependent  monitoring,  including  a  major  midterm  review,  will  be  carried  out  annually \nby a suitably qualified external expert/agency to be hired by NHAI with ADB concurrence. The \nexternal monitor will be selected within  3 months of loan approval. The monitoring findings will \nbe shared in the form of reports to NHAI and ADB. NHAI will follow up on the monitoring reports \nby the external monitoring experts. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n\n\f \n\n54\n \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n \nS.No \n\n1A \n\nCategory \n\nPrivate \nProperty \n\nType of \nLoss \nAgricultural \nland and \nassets \n\nUnit of \n Entitlement \nTitleholder \n\nTable A10.5: Detailed Entitlement Matrix \n\nEntitlement \n\nDetails \n\nCompensation at \n\u201creplacement \ncost\u201d or \u201cactual \nmarket value\u201d \n\n1.

The National Highways \nAuthority  of  India  (NHAI)  will  ensure  that  the  detailed  subproject  report  will  be \nprepared within not more than 5 months of subproject approval. \n\nThe  Subprojects  will  be  economically  viable  and  their  estimated  economic \ninternal rate of return equal to or higher than 12%. The economic analysis of the \nSubproject  will  be  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the \nEconomic Analysis of Projects, as amended from time to time.  \n\nAn  environmental  screening  will  have  been  conducted  for  the  Subproject.  Any \nSubprojects  classified  as  category  A \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  2003 \nEnvironmental  Assessment  Guidelines,  as  amended  from  time,  will  not  be \neligible  under  the  Project.  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  report  for \nthe Subproject will have been prepared in accordance with the said Guidelines. \n\nThe  Subprojects  will  be  socially  sound  and  include  measures  to  mitigate  any \nsocial impacts that it may cause if any. The initial poverty and social assessment \n(IPSA)  for  the  Subproject  will  have  been  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on Initial Poverty and Social Assessment, as amended from time.  \n\nThe resettlement plans for the Subproject will have been prepared in accordance \nwith the resettlement framework and ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement, as \namended from time to time. \n\nIf  any  indigenous  peoples/scheduled  tribes  are  likely  to  be  affected  significantly \nby a Subproject, an indigenous people\u2019s development plan (IPDP) will have been \nprepared, following the measures set forth in the IPD framework.  \n\n(viii)  Sufficient  government  counterpart  funding  will  be  allocated  to  implement  the \n\nSubprojects as scheduled. \n\n(ix) \n\nAll necessary central and state government approvals will have been obtained for \nthe Subproject. \n\nEach Subproject will be prepared and processed in accordance with the procedures set \n\nB. \n\nProcedures \n\n2. \nout below.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n58\n\nAppendix 11 \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\nFeasibility study for the selected Subprojects will be conducted by consultants to \nbe engaged by the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI). \n\nUpon  completion  of  the  feasibility  study  for  Subprojects,  NHAI  will  fill  out \nchecklists  for  IPSA  (Supplementary  Appendix  C-6),  involuntary  resettlement \n(Supplementary Appendix C-2), indigenous people (Supplementary Appendix C-\n2),  and  environmental  screening  (Supplementary  Appendix  C-3).  These \ndocuments should be sent to ADB for review, and  revisions as may be required \nby ADB. \n\nUpon  completion  of  preliminary  design,  resettlement  plans,  initial environmental \nexamination (IEE), and IPDP (if required), NHAI will appraise the Subprojects in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  policies  as  well  as  procedures  under  the  Loan \nAgreement for the Project. Based on this, NHAI will prepare and submit to ADB \nfor  its  review,  a  summary  appraisal  report  for  each  Subproject  together  with \nrequired attachments to demonstrate compliance with ADB policies: resettlement \nplan,  IEE,  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategies  (Appendix  9),  and \nIPDP (if required).  \n\nNHAI  will  disclose  each  subproject  resettlement  plan  to  the  affected  people \nbefore  submitting  it  to  ADB,  and  will  revise  it  if  required,  based  on  comments \nfrom affected people and ADB.  \n\nNHAI  will  disclose  the  summary  IEE  for  each  Subproject  to  the  public  before \nsubmitting the summary appraisal report to ADB. If the Subproject is classified as \ncategory  B  sensitive  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment \nGuidelines,  such disclosure  will  be  made  120  days  before  ADB  approval  of  the \nSubproject. \n\nADB  will  review  the  summary  appraisal  reports,  together  with  required \nattachments.  If  ADB  finds  that  the  proposed  subproject  does  not  satisfy  the \neligibility  criteria  and  procedures,  or  does  not  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  applicable \npolicies,  ADB  may  advise  NHAI  on  modification  and remedial  measures to be \ntaken  for  the  proposed  Subprojects  for  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  policies  and \nprocedures. \n\n \n\nFor  procurement  of  works  and  engagement  of  consultants,  the  usual  procedures  for \n\n \n3. \ninvestment projects, whether core or non-core, will be applied. \n \n4. \nBased on ADB\u2019s approval and subject to modification and remedial measures if any, as \nrequired  by  ADB  to  its  satisfaction,  NHAI  will  proceed  with  implementation of the subproject. \nNHAI  should  ensure  that  ADB  has  access  to  all  documents  on  which  NHAI\u2019s  subproject \nscreening  and  processing  are  based.  These  documents  should  be  kept  for  five  years  for \npossible ADB review if required.  \n \n5. \nSupplementary Appendix C-8. \n \n\nFor  detailed  instructions  for  environment  and  resettlement  procedures  and  criteria  see \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n59\n\nC. \n\nOrganizational Arrangements \n\nNHAI  will  appraise  the  subprojects,  while  ADB  will  advise  NHAI  as  indicated  in  above \n\n6. \nprocedures, to ensure that its compliance and other relevant policies are adequately followed. \n \n7. \nThe project team headed by the chief general manager in charge of E-W Corridor will be \nresponsible  for  processing  subprojects.  The  project  team  will  be  assisted  by  its  group  of \ntechnical experts, established on 15 August 2003, who will consist of several staff and/or staff \nconsultants  engaged  by  NHAI.  They  will  be  in  charge  of  (i)  engineering;  (ii)  economic  and \nfinancial  analyses;  (iii)  environment  protection; (iv) social development, including resettlement, \nindigenous peoples, and poverty; and (v) the private sector participation. Project team activities, \nincluding those of the technical experts, will be overseen by the NHAI chair.  \n\n \n\n8. \nThe  technical  experts  will  review  and  examine  all  technical  reports,  including  feasibility \nstudies,  preliminary  design  reports,  IEE,  resettlement  plans,  and  detailed  design  reports  to \nensure that ADB and NHAI requirements are fully met. \n \n9. \nThe  technical  experts  will  evaluate  the  overall  viability  of  individual  Subprojects  and \nprepare a summary appraisal report to be submitted to ADB for approval.
