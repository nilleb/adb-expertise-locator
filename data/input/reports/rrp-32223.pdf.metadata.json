The Project will also improve \nperiodic  and  routine  road  maintenance  by  securing \nappropriate  Government  budget  for  maintenance  and  by \npromoting private sector participation in road maintenance.  \n \nRationale  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has assisted with road \nsector  development  in  Bangladesh,  focusing  largely  on \ncompletion  of  five  strategic  road  transport  corridors.  Other \nmajor  financiers,  including  the  World  Bank  and  bilateral \nsources,  have  also  focused  on  strengthening  strategic \ncorridors. These coordinated efforts contributed considerably \nto meeting the growing demand for roads by linking strategic \nareas  in  Bangladesh  through  strategic  corridors.  With  the \ncompletion of key strategic road connections, more emphasis \nshould now be given to development of an integrated road \nnetwork  to  link  the  rural  poor  to  economic  opportunities. \nCompared with national and regional roads, type A feeder \nroads,  which  are  mostly  used  by  rural  farmers  to  access \nmarkets or social facilities, have only 60-65 percent pavement \nratio. Because of the poor condition of feeder roads,  rural \nfarmers\u2019  connection  to  national  roads  is  constrained,  and \nconsequently their access to markets or education or health \nfacilities, which are located in commercial centers connected \nby national roads, is limited. There is need for complementary \nimprovement  of  national,  regional,  and  feeder  roads  to \ndevelop an integrated road network to link the rural poor to \neconomic opportunities.  \n \nObjectives  The  Project  will  help  the  Government  achieve  poverty \nreduction  through  economic  growth  by  improving  transport \nefficiency  and  strengthening  integrated  road  networks  that \neffectively  link  national,  regional,  and  feeder  roads.  The \nProject  will  (i)  improve  subnational  roads  to  provide  rural \nfarmers with better access to markets, social services, and \nemployment opportunities; (ii) secure Government resources ", "iv     \nfor  periodic  road  maintenance;  (iii)  promote  private  sector \nparticipation  in  road  maintenance;  and  (iv)  improve  road \nsafety.    \n \n  The Project will (i) reconstruct 47 kilometers (km) of regional \nroads and 127 km of type A feeder roads; (ii) support periodic \nmaintenance of 400 km of roads; (iii) support routine road \nmaintenance  through  performance-based  contracts;  (iv) \nimprove  black  spots  and  conduct  education  and  public \ncampaigns for road safety; and (v) provide consulting services \nfor project management, construction supervision, preparing \nand  supervising  performance-based  road  maintenance \ncontracts; and conduct a feasibility study for privatizing the \nRoads  and  Highways  Department\u2019s  (RHD\u2019s)  maintenance \nequipment  and  workshops,  road  safety  improvement,  and \ndetailed  designing  for  Road  Network  Improvement \nMaintenance Project II. \n \nCost Estimates  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $122.9 million \nequivalent comprising foreign exchange of $49.4 million and \nlocal currency of $73.5 million equivalent.  \n \nFinancing Plan \n      ($ million) \nForeign  Local  Total \nSource  Percent \nExchange Currency  Cost \nADB-ADF   43.7  21.3  65.0  52.9 \nGovernment  0.0  47.9  47.9  39.0 \nOPEC Fund  5.7  4.3  10.0  8.1 \n  Total  49.4  73.5  122.9  100.0 \n        ADB = Asian Development Bank, ADF = Asian Development Fund, OPEC = \nOrganization of Petroleum-Exporting Countries. \n \n     \nLoan Amount and Terms  The proposed ADB loan from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources \nis equivalent in various currencies to SDR 48,964,000 [$65.0 \nmillion]. It will have a term of 32 years, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years, with an interest charge of 1% per annum \nduring the grace period, and 1.5% per annum thereafter.  \n \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 September 2007 \n \nEstimated Project  \nCompletion Date  31 March 2007 \n \nExecuting Agency  Roads and Highways Department  \n \nImplementation \nArrangements  The Project will be implemented by a project management unit \nheaded by an additional chief engineer/project director. The \nproject director will report to the chief engineer of RHD and will ", "    v \n     \n       \nbe supported by two executive engineers as project managers \nresponsible for day-to-day implementation of the Project. The \nproject director will have overall responsibility for the periodic \nroad  maintenance  component,  including  overseeing \nsubproject selection under the annual road maintenance plan \nusing the Highway Design and Maintenance Standards Model \n(HDM), procurement, monitoring and reporting, and acting as \nproject  coordinator  for  performance-based  maintenance \ncontracts.   \n \nProcurement  All  civil  works  contract  packages  will  be  procured  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement following \ninternational competitive bidding procedures, except for civil \nworks  contracts  for  the  ADB-financed  road  maintenance \ncomponent,  which  will  follow  local  competitive  bidding \nprocedures. \n \nConsulting Services  Consulting services will be required for supervising civil works \nfor the road improvement and the periodic road maintenance \ncomponents.  An  international  consulting  firm  will  undertake \nsupervision  in  association  with  domestic  consultants.  In \naddition to contract supervision, the consultants will (i) design \nperformance-based  road  maintenance  and  implement \nsupervision maintenance; (ii) assess safety for existing roads, \ndevelop  a  black  spot  improvement  plan,  and  procure  and \nsupervise  civil  works;  and  (iii)  make  a  feasibility  study  for \nprivatizing of RHD\u2019s maintenance equipment and workshops. \nConsulting  services  will  also  be  required  for  preparing  a \ndetailed design for the proposed Road Network Improvement \nand Maintenance Project II. The consultants will be recruited \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for \nengaging domestic consultants. \n \nProject Benefits  \nand Beneficiaries  The direct and quantifiable benefits of the project consist of \nsavings  in  vehicle  operating  costs  (VOCs)  to  normal  and \ndiverted  traffic,  where  applicable,  and  savings  in  time. \nNonquantifiable  benefits  include  greater  comfort  for \npassengers and reduced damage to cargo. Indirect benefits \nare those arising from the secondary effects of the reduction in \nVOCs  and  time  costs,  which  lead  to  increased  economic \nactivities. These benefits have been estimated in the form of \ngenerated passenger and cargo traffic.   \n \n  The beneficiaries are the various categories of road users:  \nowners/operators  of  buses  and  trucks,  passengers,  cargo \nowners, and the population in the area of influence in general.  \nBenefits  in  the  form  of  lower  VOCs  enjoyed  by  vehicle \nowners/operators are expected to be distributed widely among ", "vi     \nthe various stakeholders, as the conditions in the transport \nindustry are competitive. \n \n  Analysis  of  the  project  effects  on  road  users,  construction \nworkers, the Government, and lenders shows the distribution \nof benefits among road users and incorporates the negative or \npositive effects on (i) the Government and the economy in \ngeneral  (a  negative  effect)  by  way  of  the  subsidy  the \ngovernment  provides  to  road  users  by  funding  part  of  the \nconstruction cost and the loss of tax revenue it incurs as a \nresult of savings in VOCs; (ii) lenders who also provide a \nsubsidy to road users as a result of the concessional loan \nterms; and (iii) construction workers who gain because the \nsalaries earned are higher than the opportunity cost of their \nlabor.  When gains and losses of all parties are netted, the \nanalysis reveals that Tk3.74 billion of the total gains of Tk7.02 \nbillion accrues to the poor, with the poverty impact ratio of \n0.53. \n \nRisks and Assumptions  The  main  risk  in  the  road  improvement  component  is  the \nnonsustainable benefit streams from the investment due to \ninadequate  maintenance  and  truck  overloading.  This  risks \nfactor will be addressed by incorporating a project component \nthat will secure a Government budget for road maintenance \nand undertaking policy dialogue to improve axle-load control.   \n \n  The notable project risk concerns contracting out of routine \nroad maintenance based on the performance-based contract. \nLocal  private  contractors  may  be  unfamiliar  with  the  new \nperformance-based maintenance contract. The contract may \nbe poorly designed and thus fail to provide the right incentives \nor penalties to the contractors. This risk will be addressed by \nproviding consulting services for designing the performance-\nbased  contract  and  monitoring  the  performance  of  the \ncontractors.  ", " \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  Road  Network  Improvement  and \nMaintenance Project; and (ii) proposed administration of a loan for the Project to be provided by \nthe OPEC Fund for International Development (OPEC Fund). \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  The  transport  system  in  Bangladesh  is  extensive  and  diversified,  comprising  about \n140,000 kilometers (km) of roads, 2,700 km of railroads, 5,970 km of perennial and seasonal \nwaterways, two major seaports, and seven airports. The primary road network connecting \nnational  and  regional  roads  and  type  A  feeder  roads  comprises  20,800  km,1  while  the \nsecondary roads including rural and type B feeder roads total 115,000 km. National and regional \nroads and type A feeder roads are administered by the Roads and Highways Department (RHD) \nwithin the Ministry of Communication (MOC). Rural and type B feeder roads are administered by \nthe Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) within the Local Government Division. \n \n3.   The performance of the road sector has consistently improved in the past decades \naided by extension of the road network and a rapid increase in demand for road transport. The \ndemand increased at an average annual rate of 8.4% for passengers and 8.2% for freight during \nthe 1990s, increases that were almost double the average gross domestic product (GDP) \ngrowth of 4.7% for the same period. The modal share of transport has gradually shifted in favor \nof roads. Between 1975 and 1997, the modal share of road transport rose from 54% to 73% for \npassenger traffic, and from 35% to 63% for freight. The road has become the principal mode of \ntransport in Bangladesh.  \n \n4.  The condition of roads, as well as the capacity and reach of the road network, has also \nsubstantially improved. Over the past 5 years, the primary roads classified as good or fair have \nincreased from 73% to 96%. \n \n5.  The sustainability of these achievements could, however, be jeopardized by insufficient \nresources allocated to road maintenance. Over the last 5 years, the allocation for routine and \nperiodic road maintenance per kilometer of RHD roads decreased by 3% per annum. The \nHighway  Design  and  Maintenance  Standards  Model  (HDM)  estimates  that  the  long-term \nspending on preserving the road network should be Tk5 billion ($85.5 million) per annum. The \nactual  spending  is,  however,  no  more  than  Tk3.1  billion  ($53  million),  about  62%  of  the \nrequirement. Furthermore, the accumulated backlog of deferred maintenance, estimated at \nTk24 billion ($410 million), will require an additional Tk2.5 billion ($42.7 million) per annum for \nthe next 10 years. \n \n6.  Recognizing this problem, RHD is shifting its focus from road development to road \nmaintenance. Under the institutional development components funded by the Department for \nInternational Development of the United Kingdom and included in the World Bank\u2019s Second and \nThird  Road  Rehabilitation  and  Maintenance  Projects,  RHD  developed  an  annual  road \nmaintenance plan (ARMP). The first ARMP covered 1999-2000. The ARMP uses the HDM to \n                                                           \n1 The primary road network comprises 3,086 km of national roads, 1,751 km of regional roads, and 15,962 km of type \nA feeder roads. ", "2   \ndetermine which roads should be maintained for the year in question and what the level of \nmaintenance should be.  \n \n7.  Apart from strengthening institutional focus on road maintenance, there is also a need to \nestablish additional sources of road maintenance financing so that the ARMP can eventually be \nfinanced  from  domestic  sources  on  a  sustainable  basis.  A  loan  covenant  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) previous project2 required that by 2003, the Government would \nhave carried out a national review of mechanisms for funding the requirements of the ARMP \nfrom domestic sources, including the option of establishing a road maintenance fund; and that \nby  2005,  it  would  implement  a  time-bound  action  plan  for  meeting  the  annual  costs  of \nmaintaining all roads under RHD\u2019s jurisdiction. The national review is supported jointly by ADB, \nthe World Bank, Department for International Development (DFID) of the United Kingdom, and \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), building on previous work by the World Bank \nto examine the requirements for introducing a road maintenance fund. DFID provided consulting \nservices for these activities.  \n \n8.  Road transport operations are largely in the hands of the private sector, with the sole \npublic  sector  Bangladesh  Road  Transport  Corporation  (BRTC)  controlling  about  2%  of \npassenger operations and 1% of the freight market. BRTC has introduced the first compressed \nnatural gas (CNG)-powered bus in its fleet on a pilot basis. It expects to increase CNG use as \nthe option provides for about 50% savings in fuel costs and significant environmental benefits in \nreducing  air  pollution.  Under  the  Road  Overlay  and  Improvement  Project,3  ADB  provided \ntechnical advice and financing for five vehicle inspection centers (located in Dhaka, Chittagong, \nRajshahi, and Khulna) that will be responsible for issuing fitness and nonpollution certificates.4 \nUnder the Southwest Road Network Development Project,5 ADB provided technical assistance \n(TA) to formulate a strategy to improve air quality in Dhaka and other major cities, particularly in \nrelation  to  vehicular  emission.  The  study  identified  opportunities  to  introduce  technological \nchanges to the use of CNG in trucks and buses.6 These efforts have begun to produce the \nvisible output of BRTC\u2019s introducing CNG-powered buses.     \n \n9.  In the case of freight operation, almost 90% of the private trucking fleet is owned by \nindividuals, and the industry is highly competitive. Greater efficiency in operations would be \nachieved by having larger fleets, and depots and maintenance workshops so that the operators \ncould function as regular transport companies.  \n                                                           \n2  ADB. 2000.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Road Overlay and Improvement Project. Manila. \n4  Five vehicle inspection centers were built and sophisticated equipment installed. The equipment, however, has not \nbeen fully utilized because of lack of expertise in the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA). Recognizing \nthis problem, the Southwest Road Network Development Project required, as one of its loan covenants, BRTA to \nlease to the private sector the operation and management of vehicle inspection centers by June 2001. This \nrequirement has not been complied with because of poor institutional capacity and lack of the right expertise in \nBRTA. The project completion report, prepared in August 2002, recommended ADB\u2019s further assistance for \nstrengthening  BRTA\u2019s  capacity  as  a  way  of  normalizing  and  ultimately  privatizing  the  operation  of  vehicle \ninspection centers. BRTA will submit a time-bound action plan to privatize the operation of vehicle inspection \ncenters, together with an assessment of their capacity, and identified the areas for ADB assistance to implement \nthe action plan. ADB will consider further assistance as part of Road Network Improvement and Maintenance \nProject II programmed for 2003. \n5  ADB. 1999.

", "  3 \n10.  Road safety is a continuing major issue as the fatality rate on the country\u2019s roads \nnetwork remains the highest in South Asia. The number of persons reported killed increased \nfrom 955 in 1983 to 3,162 in 1997, corresponding to an annual fatality rate of 73 per 10,000 \nmotor vehicles. The current rate is more than double that in other South Asian countries, and \nseveral times higher than that in Europe. The causes of the significantly increased accident rate \nare  mainly  overspeeding,  overloading,  and  overtaking  by  motor  vehicles.  Unregulated \nmovement of nonmotorized vehicles along with motorized vehicles on the same route is also \none major cause of road accidents and traffic congestion.  \n \n11.  Recent research carried out by ADB7 and the World Bank has established that drivers\u2019 \nignorance  of  traffic  regulations  and  inefficient  enforcement  are  the  major  causes  of  road \naccidents, followed by poor road and vehicle conditions and overloading. Under the Jamuna \nBridge Access Roads Project,8 ADB financed a weighbridge to monitor axle load and provided \nconsulting services to (i) identify accident-prone locations, or black spots; (ii) recommend safety \nmeasures  in  road  design;  (iii)  supervise  construction  of  civil  works  for  low-cost  accident \nprevention measures; (iv) conduct training in road safety enforcement and education; and (v) \nmonitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the various accident-prevention measures. \n \n12.  Under the Southwest Road Network Development Project (footnote 5), RHD established \nan independent Road Design and Safety Circle (RDSC), which monitors road safety aspects \nthroughout RHD and prepares manuals for road safety and road design. RDSC also introduced \na road safety audit program for RHD roads, and prepared a road safety manual that provides for \nan institutionalized systematic method of checking the safety aspects of new and existing roads \nto identify hazards. The project also provided consulting services, partly financed by Nordic \nDevelopment Fund (NDF), to assist the National Road Safety Council (NRSC) in setting up \ndistrict and municipal committees and funding the initial public campaigns, bus driver training \nprograms,  truck  driver  training,  and  overloading  awareness  campaigns,  and  in  involving \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs) in road safety programs.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n1.  Road Improvement \n \n13.  The Partnership Agreement on Poverty Reduction concluded in April 2000 identified \nroads as one of the leading agents for poverty reduction. In line with the agreement, the road \nsubsector strategy in Bangladesh focuses on (i) accelerating pro-poor economic growth, e.g., by \nproviding farmers with access to markets and inputs; (ii) reducing the obstacles to social service \ndelivery and providing access to vulnerable groups; (iii) facilitating popular participation by \nfacilitating travel; and (iv) conducting road sector operations with greater public scrutiny and \nintroducing more objective and transparent approaches to resource allocation, especially for \nroad maintenance.   \n \n14.  Since 1977, ADB has provided 12 loans totaling $931 million to the road sector in \nBangladesh, focusing largely on the completion of five strategic road transport corridors. Other \nmajor financiers, including the World Bank and bilaterals, have invested $1.8 billion in the road \nsector, also focusing on strengthening the strategic corridors. External assistance to the roads \nsector from aid agencies are in Appendix 2. These coordinated efforts contributed considerably \n                                                           \n7  ADB. 1995 and 1997. Regional Initiatives in Road Safety. Manila. \n8  ADB. 1996. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Jamuna Bridge Access Roads. Manila. ", "4   \nto meeting the growing demand for roads by linking strategic areas in Bangladesh through \nstrategic corridors. About 96% of national and regional roads are paved.   \n \n15.  With the completion of key strategic road connections, more emphasis should now be \ngiven to developing an integrated road network to link the rural poor to economic opportunities. \nCompared with national and regional roads, type A feeder road, which is mostly used by rural \nfarmers to access markets or social facilities, has only 60-65% pavement ratio. Because of this \npoor condition of feeder roads, the connection of rural farmers to national roads is constrained; \nconsequently, their access to markets or education or health facilities, which are located in \ncommercial centers connected by national roads, is limited. The Project is designed to focus on \nimprovement of regional and feeder roads to strengthen integrated road networks, especially in \nthe northwest and the central north regions in Bangladesh where the level of poverty incidence \nis known to be highest.9 The project areas also have significant potential development impact \nfor not only nationwide but also subregional economic development in the medium term.10 \n \n16.  The districts of the project areas measure about 35,000 km2 accommodating more than \n31 million people and about 4,500 km of national, regional, and type A feeder roads. Type A \nfeeder roads comprise more than 76% of the total length of roads. Industrial activities in the \nproject areas are low compared with those in other regions of the country, particularly Dhaka, \nChittagong, Jessore, and Khulna. Each project district has an industrial estate of Bangladesh \nSmall and Cottage Industries Corporation, where small and medium-size industrial enterprises \nare set up. Total employment in the industrial activities in the project district was estimated at \n100,000 in 1996/1997. Outside the estates, small and cottage industries such as rice milling, \ntimber processing, furniture making, food processing, and hand loom weaving are popular.  \n \n2.  Road Maintenance \n \n17.  While a mechanism for sustainable domestic financing for road maintenance is expected \nby 2005 (para. 7), there is a need to separately address the present shortfall of Government \nresources for periodic road maintenance and the increasing backlog of deferred maintenance. \nThe World Bank provided $70 million for periodic maintenance over the period 2000-2004 \nthrough its Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project 3. ADB\u2019s Road Maintenance and \nImprovement Project (footnote 2) attempted to reduce the increasing backlog by encouraging \nthe Government to commit more of its annual budget to periodic road maintenance. ADB \nallocated $10.8 million for periodic road maintenance and required the Government to shoulder \n70% of the cost of periodic maintenance while the Project pays 30%. This arrangement will \nenable the Government to source $36 million in total that can finance 300 km of periodic \nmaintenance for 3 years. The Project will extend this program by 2 years and finance 200 km of \nperiodic maintenance for 2 years with the same scheme of leveraging Government financing. \n \n3.  Private Sector Development \n \n18.  Under the same ADB project (footnote 2), a policy and guidelines for private investment \nin highway projects are being prepared with the aim of enacting them by September 2004. The \npolicy and guidelines are concerned with establishing a legal and regulatory framework for \n                                                           \n9  Sen, Binayak. 2000. Bangladesh Poverty Analysis: Trends, Policies and Institutions. The poverty survey identified \nGaibandha, Kurigram, Lalmonirhat, Nilphamari, Panchagarh, Rangpur in the northwest, and Jamalpur and Sherpur \nin the center-north as the poorest districts in Bangladesh with higher than 50% poverty incidence. \n10 The northwest will be a major route of cross-border traffic from Nepal and Bhutan to Mongla and Chittagong port \nwhen regional economic cooperation becomes active through the South Asian Growth Quadrangle initiative. The \ncenter-north will be an important route connecting Sylhet in the northeast to the Jamuna Bridge in the future, which \nwill replace the current long route through Dhaka. ", "  5 \nprivate sector investment in highway projects including build-operate-transfer (BOT)-type of \nroad  development  contracts.  This  legal  and  regulatory  framework  will  foster  an  enabling \nenvironment  for  private  sector  participation  in  developing  the  road  sector.  Until  such  a \nframework is put in place, efforts can be made to attempt a less sophisticated mode of private \nsector participation in the road sector.  \n \n19.  Traditionally, road maintenance is contracted out based on a schedule of unit prices and \nestimates of quantities. The works to be performed are specified in the contract and payments \nare based on executed measured works. In contrast, a performance-based road maintenance \ncontract defines the minimum road conditions that the contractor has to provide. Payments are \nbased on how well the contractor complies with the performance standards defined in the \ncontract, not on the amount of works executed.11 The performance-based maintenance contract \ntransfers  the  risks  of  work  selection,  technology,  process,  design  or  management  to  the \ncontractors, and thereby encourages them to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their \nmaintenance works for their own benefit. This efficiency gain will be translated into low-cost \nroad maintenance through competitive bidding. Without the legal and regulatory framework for \nprivate sector participation in place, performance-based road maintenance can be introduced as \na  way  of  improving  the  efficiency  of  road  maintenance  and  relieving  RHD  of  excessive \nworkloads for monitoring input quantities under the traditional maintenance contract. As private \nsector participation in road maintenance grows, and the participants\u2019 capacity improves, RHD\u2019s \nrole in road maintenance will be reduced. Then, RHD\u2019s maintenance equipment and workshops, \npresently used by RHD for its own maintenance work and rented as necessary to private \ncontractors who can\u2019t afford to keep such equipment and workshops, can be privatized. \n \n4.  Road Safety  \n \n20.  While RHD addresses road safety through engineering solutions such as a road safety \naudit, NRSC leads the national-level activities to improve road safety. The secretariat of NRSC \nwas established in the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA) in 1998 and was involved \nin monitoring the implementation of the national road safety strategic action plan. In January \n2001, the BRTA Road Safety Cell was formed as a successor to the NRSC secretariat under \nthe  World  Bank\u2019s  Road  Rehabilitation  and  Maintenance  Project  3.  The  Road  Safety  Cell \nprovides secretariat services to NRSC and coordinates all road safety activities as defined in the \nnational road safety action plan. \n \n21.  In November 2001, NRSC issued the National Road Safety Strategic Action Plan 2002-\n2004 which prescribes the direction for nationwide road safety activities for the next three years. \nIt identified problems, goals, and required actions for nine key road safety issues: (i) planning, \nmanagement,  and  coordination  of  road  safety  activities;  (ii)  establishing  an  accident  data \nsystem;  (iii)  preventing  road  accidents  through  more  safety-conscious  planning,  design, \nconstruction, and maintenance of roads; (iv) revising traffic legislation promoting road user \ncompliance; (v) developing a more effective and efficient traffic police; (vi) ensuring minimum \nstandards for driver competence through improved driver training and testing procedures; (vii) \nimproving the roadworthiness of vehicles; (viii) introducing road safety education and publicity \nprograms;  and  (ix)  improving  the  emergency  assistance,  hospital  care,  and  rehabilitation \navailable for victims of road traffic accidents. The Road Safety Cell has developed various \nactivities for implementing the action plan, and coordinates with aid agencies such as the World \nBank, DFID, and ADB in implementing them. \n \n                                                           \n11 Zietlow, J. Gunter, and Alberto Bull. 1999. Performance Specified Road Maintenance Contracts-The Road to the \nFuture.  ", "6   \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Objectives \n \n22.  The objective is to help the Government achieve poverty reduction through economic \ngrowth by improving transport efficiency and strengthening integrated road networks effectively \nlinking national, regional, and feeder roads. The Project will (i) improve subnational roads to \nprovide  rural  farmers  with  better  access  to  markets,  social  services,  and  employment \nopportunities; (ii) secure Government resources for periodic road maintenance; (iii) promote \nprivate sector participation in road maintenance; and (iv) improve road safety.   \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n \n23.  The Project will (i) reconstruct 47 km of regional roads and 127 km of type A feeder \nroads; (ii) support periodic road maintenance of 400 km of roads; (iii) support routine road \nmaintenance through performance-based contracts; (iv) improve accident-prone areas or black \nspots and undertake education and public campaigns for road safety; and (v) provide consulting \nservices  for  project  management,  construction  supervision,  preparing  and  supervising  a \nperformance-based road maintenance contract, conducting a feasibility study for privatizing \nRHD\u2019s  maintenance  equipment  and  workshops,  road  safety  improvement,  and  detailed \ndesigning for Road Network Improvement Maintenance Project II. \n \n1.  Roads Improvement Component \n \n24.  The Project will reconstruct a 47 km regional road in Mymensingh-Nandail and five type \nA feeder roads in (i) Muktagacha-Chechua, 10.0 km; (ii) Jamalpur-Dewanganj, 41.0 km; (iii) \nMithapukur-Madhyapara,  24.0  km;  (iv)  Thakurgaon-Ranisankail,  37.0  km;  and  (v)  Saidpur-\nParbatipur,  15.0  km.  A  summary  for  the  design  approach  and  technical  standards  for \nreconstruction is attached as Appendix 3.  \n \n25.  The feasibility study for the Project assessed 27 roads selected from the northwest \nregion  covering  Dinajpur,  Gaibandha,  Kurigram,  Lalmonirhat,  Nilphamari,  Panchagarh, \nRangpur,  and  Thakurgaon;  and  the  central  north  region  covering  Jamalpur,  Kishoreganj, \nMymensingh, Netrokona, and Sherpur. The 27 candidate roads were identified by a set of \nselection  criteria12  established  through  extensive  consultative  meetings  with  various \nstakeholders including Government officials, road engineers, NGOs, transport operators, public \nrepresentatives, and common road users in the project areas. Of the 27 candidate roads, 17  \nwere identified as technically and economically viable.  \n \n26.  Of the 17 roads, 6 were selected as the project roads based on their economic rate of \nreturn  as  main  criterion,  and  some  other  aspects  such  as  likely  poverty  impact,  adverse \nenvironmental impact, or social and resettlement implications. The six project roads entail the \nrepair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction of nine bridges. \n \n                                                           \n12 The criteria included (i) social aspects such as population density, roof material of houses, and literacy level; (ii) \neconomic aspects such as unemployment level, nonagricultural employment, and nonfarm income sources; (iii) \nroad condition and traffic such as road roughness level, general road conditions, traffic level, and nonmotorized \nvehicles; (iv) level of completion of road network loop; and (v) stakeholders\u2019 recommendation. ", "  7 \n2.  Periodic Road Maintenance Component \n \n27.  The periodic road maintenance component will finance a two-year time slice of priority \nroad maintenance activities under the ARMP. For each of the two years, this component will \ncover periodic maintenance of an estimated 200 km, to be carried out through civil works \ncontracts worth $8 million equivalent. The roads to be maintained will be selected annually \nusing the HDM ranking as part of the ARMP. Support will be restricted to periodic maintenance \nworks and will comprise mainly sealing and overlay. Road widening and improvement are \nexcluded except in specific locations approved by ADB such as market places and bus bays. \nThe support will target the districts selected as project areas (para. 25). The criteria for selecting \nroad  maintenance  subprojects  are  in  Appendix  4.  Consulting  services  will  be  provided  to \nsupervise the civil works under the ADB-assisted time slice.   \n \n28.  Since this component is included to encourage the Government to commit more of its \nannual budget to periodic road maintenance, the costs to be met under the ADB loan will be \nlower  than  those  to  be  met  through  Government  counterpart  funding.  This  element  will \ncontribute significantly to securing Government resources for periodic road maintenance and \naddressing the critical backlog of periodic maintenance. \n \n3.  Routine Road Maintenance Component \n \n29.  Routine and recurrent maintenance for about 50 km of regional or type A feeder roads \nwill be contracted out to domestic contractors based on a performance-based contract for the \nperiod of 3-5 years. The roads for routine maintenance will be selected from regional or type A \nfeeder roads in the project areas, the periodic maintenance of which has been completed within \na year at the time of selection.  \n \n30.  The  performance-based  contract  consists  of  three  major  maintenance  components: \npreventive  work,  catch-up  routine  work,  and  performance  (routine  and  recurrent)  work. \nPreventive maintenance is designed to improve the road\u2019s structural condition. Catch-up routine \nmaintenance is designed to reduce the present maintenance backlog, particularly for shoulders \nand drainage. It may include some minor improvements such as drainage structures, slope \nprotection,  guardrails,  road  signs,  and  markings.  After  preventive  and  catch-up  routine \nmaintenance are completed, performance-based maintenance will begin. The preventive and \ncatch-up routine maintenance works will be executed and paid for based on the quantity of work \ncompleted. Performance-based maintenance, however, will be executed according to minimum \nstandards set in the contract. If contractors fail to maintain the standards, the monthly lump sum \npayment  will  be  reduced  according  to  the  penalties  for  noncompliance  delineated  in  the \ncontract. The concept of performance-based maintenance and its implementation are outlined in \nAppendix 5. \n \n31.  Consulting services will be provided to develop the contract scheme, train RHD officials \nand local contractors, assist with contract award, and supervise the works in the first year of \nimplementation. During the remaining years of implementation, RHD will supervise and monitor \nthe works. During the first year, the consultant will monitor and evaluate implementation, and \nprepare a final report giving the findings, lessons learned, and recommendations for replication.  \n \n4.  Road Safety Component \n \n32.  The Project will undertake civil works at selected accident-prone areas or black spots \nalong the project roads and other selected roads. For the purpose, a safety audit will be ", "8   \nconducted for project roads along with detailed designing to comply with safety requirements. \nSafety will also be assessed for about 200 km of existing roads with the highest accident rate,  \nand the findings will be implemented by the Project. Road safety will be improved in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Road Safety Guidelines for the Asian and Pacific Region. \n   \n33.  Road designs will be improved by (i) improving delineation and edge marking on roads \nand installing reflecting market posts; (ii) installing deviation boards in critical locations; (iii) \nwidening  the  pavement  sections  of  main  roads  that  carry  high  volumes  of  pedestrians, \nrickshaws,  and  animal-driven  vehicles;  (iv)  providing  off-road  facilities  for  pedestrians  in \nsettlements, including facilities for buses and bus passengers; and (v) providing adequate \nreflective warning signs, setting realistic speed limits, and building speed bumps on roads \nthrough settlements.  \n \n34.  The Project will assist the BRTA Road Safety Cell to implement its strategic action plan, \nparticularly for developing a more comprehensive highway code that will set out rules for road \nusers and provide guidelines for safe driving, and to prepare illustrated guides for road safety \neducation. \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n35.  Nonmotorized traffic comprises a significant share of present-day traffic on most roads in \nBangladesh. For the project roads, the proportion of nonmotorized to motorized traffic ranges \nfrom 2.2 to 9.1. Nonmotorized traffic comprises slow-moving traffic such as bicycles, cycle \nrickshaws, handcarts, and animal-drawn carts. Cycle rickshaws operating in villages, towns, and \ncities haved even become an icon of Bangladesh. They are widely used for passengers as well \nas for small size freight traffic in rural areas. Rickshaws are the most common mode of transport \namong  small  farmers  transporting  their  products  in  small  quantities  to  nearby  markets. \nEspecially for perishable commodities such as fruits, vegetables, milk, and dairy products, \nrickshaws are taken as a more relevant mode of transport mainly due to lack of storage and \nother facilities required for those commodities. In 1998, it was estimated that 554,000 rickshaws \nwere operating in Bangladesh, almost the same size as the total motorized vehicles.  \n \n36.  Nonmotorized traffic uses the outer part of the carriageway as most roads rarely have a \nsufficient width of hard shoulder. Thus, nonmotorized traffic poses a significant hindrance to \nmotorized traffic. It also poses a significant accident risk, in particular as drivers of larger \nvehicles take little note of these slow-moving vehicles. An analysis of speed regression shows \nthat nonmotorized traffic reduces the achievable speed on a road more rapidly than motorized \ntraffic does, i.e., nonmotorized traffic takes 7 years to reduce the achievable speed to 20 km per \nhour, while the same number of motorized traffic takes 19 years. It proves that slow-moving \nnonmotorized traffic has a significant adverse impact on the speed of motorized traffic.  \n \n37.  Under the present economic situation and continued pressure on the labor market, it is \nnot foreseeable that the demand for and use of nonmotorized means of transport will be \nreduced in favor of motorized traffic in the near future. The adverse impact of nonmotorized \ntraffic might then be addressed by improving road design in such a way as to accommodate \nsuch  traffic  while  maintaining  the  desired  speed.  The  feasibility  study  for  the  Project \nrecommended two options: (i) provide separate surfaced lanes for nonmotorized traffic; and (ii) \nprovide hard shoulders wider than the current standard. One of the project roads, Muktagacha-\nChechua, 26.0 km, will be designed adopting the latter option. It will have a 2.0-meter-wide hard \nshoulder that is 33% wider than the current standard of 1.5 meters. If this option proves \nsuccessful in accommodating nonmotorized traffic, it will be replicated in other road designs.   ", "  9 \nD.  Cost Estimates \n \n38.  The  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $122.9  million  equivalent,  inclusive  of \nphysical and price contingencies, taxes and duties, and interest charges during construction \n(Table 1). The foreign exchange cost is estimated at $49.4 million, representing about 40% of \ntotal cost. The local currency cost is estimated at $73.5 million equivalent, or about 60% of total \ncost. The local currency costs include $18.6 million equivalent for taxes and duties, and about \n$3.6 million equivalent for land acquisition and resettlement.  \n \nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n \n  Foreign  Local  Total \nItem  Exchange  Currency  Cost \nA.

Financing Plan \n \n39.  The  proposed  ADB  loan  is  $65  million  equivalent  from  the  Special  Funds  (ADF) \nresources. The ADF loan will be denominated in special drawing rights, and will have a term of \n32 years including a grace period of 8 years with an interest rate of 1% per year during the ", "10   \ngrace period and 1.5% thereafter. The ADB loan will finance 88% of the foreign exchange cost \nof the Project and 29% of the local currency cost. Total ADB financing accounts for 53% of all \nproject  costs,  and  Government  financing  will  be  39%.  The  Borrower  will  be  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of Bangladesh. The Borrower will make the loan available to the Project\u2019s Executing \nAgency through appropriate budgetary allocation. The project financing plan is presented in \nTable 2.  The detailed financing plan is in Appendix 6. \n \n40.  The  Organization  of  Petroleum-Exporting  Countries  (OPEC)  Fund  will  provide  joint \ncofinancing of $10 million equivalent for the Project. The amount will be used to finance a \nportion  of  civil  works  construction  (contract  3,  Jamalpur-Dewanganj  road;  and  contract  4, \nSaidpur-Parbatipur road). ADB will administer the OPEC Fund loan and for this purpose will \nenter into an agreement with the OPEC Fund. The loan will have a maturity of 20 years with an \ninterest rate of 1%, service charge of 1% per annum, and a grace period of 5 years. In the event \nthat the OPEC Fund loan does not become effective, or becomes effective in an amount that \ncreates a shortfall in financing, the Government will meet the shortfall from its own resources. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \n  Foreign  Local  Total Cost   \nSource  Exchange  Currency  Percent \nADB    43.7    21.3    65.0    52.9 \nGovernment    0.0    47.9    47.9    39.0 \nOPEC Fund    5.7    4.3    10.0    8.1 \n  Total    49.4    73.5    122.9     100.0 \n       ADB = Asian Development Bank, OPEC = Organization of Petroleum-Exporting Countries. \n \n41.  Providing financing for local currency costs is considered justified under ADB\u2019s local \ncurrency financing policy.13 Because a low level of per capita income imposes constraints on \nnational  savings,  assistance  is  required  to  support  the  local  currency  costs  of  some \ndevelopment projects. The domestic savings and investment rate of Bangladesh is one of the \nlowest  among  developing  member  countries  (DMCs).  Public  finances  remain  severely \nconstrained.  The  banking  system  also  faces  serious  financial  problems,  including  a  high \nproportion of nonperforming loans. The Government is taking steps to strengthen the financial \nsector and generate increased national savings by introducing financial sector reforms and \nimproving budgetary revenue collection. Given all those factors, the current social and economic \ndevelopment circumstances warrant continued ADB financing of local costs. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n42.  The Executing Agency will be RHD within MOC, except for the road safety component \nfor education and public campaign. RHD has substantial experience in implementing ADB-\nfinanced road projects. In accordance with the loan covenants for the ADB-financed Southwest \nRoad Network Development Project (footnote 5), the office of additional chief engineer (ADB \nprojects) RHD implements all ADB projects. The additional chief engineer (ADB projects) is \ncurrently responsible for all ADB-assisted projects.  \n \n                                                           \n13  ADB. 1995. Review of Lending Foreign Exchange for Local Currency Expenditure on Projects.  Manila. ", "  11 \n43.  Recognizing that the additional chief engineer is fully loaded with current ADB projects, \nRHD will appoint a separate full-time additional chief engineer as project director for the Project \nbefore loan negotiation. The project director will report to the chief engineer of RHD and be \nsupported  by  two  executive  engineers  as  project  managers  responsible  for  day-to-day \nimplementation of the Project. The project director will also be responsible for implementing the \nland acquisition and resettlement plan. Details of the proposed project management for the road \nimprovement component are in Appendix 7.  \n \n44.  The project director will have overall responsibility for the periodic road maintenance \ncomponent,  including  overseeing  subproject  selection  under  the  ARMP  using  HDM, \nprocurement, monitoring and reporting, and acting as project coordinator for the performance-\nbased  maintenance  contract.  Administering  contracts  and  other  aspects  of  day-to-day \nimplementation for periodic road maintenance and routine maintenance by the performance-\nbased contract will be delegated to RHD\u2019s zonal offices, through the project director.  \n \n45.  BRTA will be the Executing Agency for the road safety component for education and \npublic campaign. The director technical in BRTA will be the project director, and will report to the \nchairman of BRTA, and be supported by the manager of BRTA Road Safety Cell, as project \nmanager responsible for day-to-day implementation of the Project. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n46.  The Project will be implemented over 4 years, inclusive of preconstruction activities. \nDetailed designing for the project roads will start in March 2003 and civil works should start by \nJuly 2004. The Government will not award any ADB-financed civil works construction contracts \nuntil after the construction supervision consultants have been appointed, and until the land and \nrights to land, free of encumbrances, required for the execution of such contracts have been \nacquired or made available. The Project is expected to be completed by 30 June 2007. Details \nof the implementation schedule are in Appendix 8. \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n47.  Civil works for the road improvement component will be procured through international \ncompetitive bidding (ICB) procedures among prequalified bidders in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. Contract packages for the road improvement components are \nlisted in Appendix 9. Civil works for the periodic road maintenance component will be packaged \nin contracts with an estimated value of $1.0 million-$3.0 million, and procured in accordance \nwith local competitive bidding (LCB) procedures acceptable to ADB. Local contractors have \nproved technically and financially qualified to carry out this size of periodic maintenance works, \nand  few  international  contractors  will  be  interested  because  of  the  logistical  difficulties  of \nmanaging maintenance works. For these contracts a separate prequalification exercise will not \nbe necessary. Instead, bidders will be required to submit the information pertaining to their \nqualification together with their bids following single-stage, two-envelope bidding procedures. \nCivil works for the periodic maintenance packages with an estimated value of more than $3.0 \nmillion  will  be  procured  through  ICB  procedures  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement.  \n \n48.  Civil works for the routine road maintenance with performance-based contract will be \nprocured in accordance with LCB procedures acceptable to ADB, and its program design and \nimplementation plan that will be developed by consultants. Black spot improvement for the \nproject  roads  will  be  implemented  as  part  of  the  related  road  contract  packages.  For ", "12   \nimprovement of black spots on existing roads, local contractors will be selected in accordance \nwith LCB procedures acceptable to ADB.  \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n49.  Consulting services will be required for supervising civil works for the road improvement \nand the periodic road maintenance components. An international consulting firm will undertake \nsupervision in association with domestic consultants. The ADB has approved the Government \nrequest that the internationally recruited consultants be required to collaborate with domestic \nconsultants.  In  addition  to  contract  supervision,  the  consultants  will  (i)  undertake  program \ndesign and implementation supervision for performance-based road maintenance; (ii) assess \nthe safety of existing roads, develop a black spot improvement plan, and procure and supervise \ncivil works; and (iii) conduct a feasibility study for privatizing of RHD\u2019s maintenance equipment \nand workshops. The consultant will also be responsible for ensuring community participation, \nidentifying community needs, and monitoring gender and child labor issues. About 163 person-\nmonths of international and 745 person-months of domestic consulting services will be required. \nThe consultants will be selected and appointed by the quality-and-cost-based selection method \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and arrangements satisfactory \nto ADB for engaging domestic consultants. Outline terms of reference for these services are in \nAppendix 10. \n \n50.  Consulting services (about 20 person-months international and 140 domestic) will be \nrequired for preparing a detailed design for the proposed Road Network Improvement and \nMaintenance Project II.  The consultants will be selected and appointed by the quality-and-cost-\nbased selection method in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. Outline terms of reference \nfor these services are in Appendix 11. \n \n51.  RHD will appoint full-time domestic consultants or NGOs to support implementation and \nindependent monitoring of the land acquisition and resettlement plan. The consultants will be \nrecruited according to arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants.  \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n52.  For consulting services, procurement of equipment, and civil works contracts, loan funds \nwill be disbursed using direct payment and reimbursement procedures in accordance with  \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \na.  Accounts and Audit \n \n53.  RHD will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify the goods and \nservices financed from the loan proceeds, the financing resources received, the expenditures \nincurred for the Project, and use of local funds. The accounts will be set up in accordance with \nsound accounting principles. External accounting experts will be engaged to design the project \naccounts to be used by RHD. Consolidated project accounts and related financial statements \nwill be audited annually by private sector auditors acceptable to ADB. The audited reports and \nrelated financial statements will be submitted to ADB not later than 6 months after the end of the \nfiscal year to which they relate. The Office of the Director of Accounts in RHD will coordinate all ", "  13 \naccounts  activities  and  ensure  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  audit  and  accounting  requirements, \nwhich will be followed up in regular reviews by ADB. \n \n54.  All procurement activities will be subject to an independent performance audit to ensure \ntransparency and objective and independent assessment of such activities. The performance \naudit will be conducted twice during implementation in conjunction with the annual audit of \nproject accounts and related financial statements, and will be carried out by the same private \nsector auditors. In addition, ADB will conduct project procurement audits during implementation \nas part of its regular review process. \n \nb.  Reports \n \n55.  The supervision consultant will submit monthly progress reports to RHD, MOC, and \nADB. RHD will ensure that the consultant includes in the reports the status of land acquisition \nand resettlement and other activities that are critical to project implementation, but are not \ndirectly included in the scope of the engineering services. This will continue until the Project has \nbeen completed. Within three months of physical completion, the consultant will prepare a \ncompletion report in a format acceptable to RHD and ADB. \n \n56.  RHD  will  monitor  project  preparation  and  implementation  in  accordance  with  the \nimplementation schedule, and will keep ADB informed of any significant deviations that could \nresult in the schedule not being met.  \n \n6.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n57.  RHD, assisted by the supervision consultant, will establish a capability for systematic \nproject performance monitoring and analysis throughout the life of the Project, integrated with its \nmanagement  information  system.  Before  construction,  project  performance  monitoring  will \ndevelop and conduct a \u201cquick and easy\u201d sample survey to establish a baseline for subsequent \nperformance monitoring. After construction is completed, surveys will be conducted annually. \nThe scope of the survey, quantity and quality of data, and frequency of collection will be guided \nprimarily  by  the  project  management\u2019s  need  for  progressive  and  rapid  feedback  on \nimplementation  status,  as  well  as  early  warning  on  situations  that  might  jeopardize  the \nattainment of the development objectives. The key indicators and assumptions outlined at the \ndevelopment objective (i.e., goal and purpose) levels in the project framework (Appendix 1) will \nform the core of the data required for assessment. Project performance monitoring will be \nstrengthened by supplementary systematic analysis of sample data from similar nonproject \nareas. \n \n7.  Project Review \n \n58.  ADB staff will review the implementation of the Project through regular or special review \nmissions. The Loan Agreement will also require a detailed midterm review. Based on the project \nschedule, the review will be carried out around July/August 2005. The midterm review will \ndiscuss with the Government the approach to contracting out routine maintenance through a \nperformance-based maintenance contract. Terms of reference for the midterm review will be \nincluded in the project administration memorandum to be prepared by ADB\u2019s Inception Mission \nfor the Project. \n ", "14   \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Economic Impacts \n \n59.  The benefits of the Project are wide-ranging and include direct and quantifiable benefits \nas well as indirect and nonquantifiable benefits. The direct and quantifiable benefits consist of \nsavings  in  vehicle  operating  costs  (VOCs)  to  normal  traffic  (and  diverted  traffic  where \napplicable) and savings in time costs. Nonquantifiable benefits include greater comfort and \nsafety for road users, and reduced damage to cargo. Indirect benefits are those arising from \nsecondary effects brought about by the reduction in VOCs and time costs, which in turn lead to \nincreased economic activities. Indirect benefits have been estimated in the form of generated \npassenger and cargo traffic.  \n \n60.  The beneficiaries include (i) those benefiting directly from the investments, i.e., the \nvarious categories of road users such as owners/operators of buses and trucks, passengers of \nthe various vehicle categories, cyclists and pedestrians, and cargo owners and those involved in \nthe production of cargo; and (ii) those benefiting indirectly because they live and work in the \narea of influence of the roads. The latter is estimated at some 2.75 million people when the \nzone of influence is taken as a band of 15 km (7.5 km on either side of the road).  It is also \nestimated that about 50% of this population live below the (upper) poverty line.14 This population \nis expected to benefit because the road investments will mitigate the underlying causes of \npoverty in the area by facilitating economic integration and economic development on which the \nrealization of the area\u2019s broader needs \uf8e7 medical facilities, schools and livelihood opportunities \n\uf8e7 ultimately depends.  \n \n61.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the project roads ranges from 17.7% to \n30.8%, or a combined EIRR of 24.5%. A review of the various factors affecting the EIRR \nindicates that the main threat to the viability of the investment is premature road failure due to \ninadequate maintenance and overloading. The Project includes measures to address these \nrisks  by  helping  the  Government  to  establish  and  implement  appropriate  policies.  Various \nsensitivity tests indicate that the EIRR is robust in relation to a construction cost increase of \n15%, reduction of benefits by 20%, and reduction by 30% of benefits derived from nonmotorized \ntraffic.  The  switching  values  of  those  sensitivity  tests  range  from  34%  to  314%.  Detailed \neconomic analysis for the road improvement components is in Appendix 12. \n \nB.  Poverty Reduction Impacts \n \n62.  The Project proceeded through different stages with a strong poverty focus at every \nstage.  First, the target area in which the project roads were selected comprises some of the \npoorest  districts  in  the  country.  Second,  following  the  establishment  of  a  comprehensive \ndatabase of all roads in this target area, roads were screened based on a number of criteria, \nincluding the socioeconomic profile of the districts and of its population, expected poverty \nreduction  impacts,  road  conditions,  traffic,  road  network  requirements,  and  input  from \nstakeholders through an extensive process of consultations.  In the final stage, a selection was \nmade from among the roads screened in the second stage, taking into account the funding \nconstraint.   \n                                                           \n14 Upper poverty line:  the level of per capita income or consumption at which the members of a household can be \nexpected to meet their basic food consumption needs \u2013 i.e., to meet their calorie intake requirements \u2013 as well as \nsome essential nonfood need.  These estimates are based on Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BSS). 2000. \nHousehold Expenditure and Income Survey (HEIS). ", "  15 \n63.  The  technical  features  and  implementation  arrangements  were  designed  so  as  to \naddress the key needs and concerns of the poor. The road designs provide for wider shoulders \nthan has been the standard so far; in addition, the shoulders will be surfaced. These features \nwill ensure much improved road space and riding conditions for nonmotorized traffic, which is \nthe mode used overwhelmingly by the poorer sections of the population. In addition, targeted \ninterventions during the construction phase are designed to benefit the poor. They include (i) \nrecruiting labor from the project area. It is estimated that funds directly injected in the local \neconomy from employment of locally recruited labor will amount to some Tk355 million; (ii) \nprocuring goods and services from within the project area; and (iii) providing for gender equity in \nthe construction contracts to ensure that women employed in road construction activities will \nreceive comparable pay for comparable work. \n \n64.  A distribution analysis assessed the extent to which the direct and quantifiable benefits \nflowing from the Project during the operational phase accrue to poor people and hence to \ncalculate the poverty impact ratio of the project investments. The benefits considered include \nthe savings in VOCs and time costs of motorized and nonmotorized traffic. The approach to \ndetermining the poverty impact of the Project proceeded in two steps. First, an estimate was \nmade of the distribution of the directly quantifiable benefits to the various categories of road \nusers, i.e., bus and truck operators/owners; bus and motor rickshaw passengers; car, utility, \nand motorcycle owners, drivers and passengers; rickshaw passengers and cyclists. The \nestimates were based on the analysis of the competitive conditions in the transport and \nproduct markets. Second, the poverty status of these road users was determined based on \n(i) a poverty line for the area of the project roads, and (ii) a survey of road users to establish \nwhether their income is below or above this poverty line.   \n \n65.  The  analysis  of  the  distribution  of  project  effects  among  road  users,  construction \nworkers, the Government, and lenders took as starting point the outcome of the distribution of \nbenefits  among  road  users  and  incorporated  the  negative  or  positive  effects  on  (i)  the \nGovernment  and  the  economy  in  general  (a  negative  effect)  by  way  of  the  subsidy  the \nGovernment provides to road users in funding part of the construction cost and the loss of tax \nrevenue it incurs as a result of savings in VOCs; (ii) lenders who also provide a subsidy to road \nusers  as  a  result  of  the  concessional  loan  terms;  and  (iii)  construction  workers  who  gain \nbecause the salaries earned are higher than the opportunity cost of their labor.  When gains and \nlosses of all parties were netted, the analysis reveals that Tk3.71 billion of the total gains of \nTk7.01 billion accrues to the poor, with the poverty impact ratio of 0.53. The distribution analysis \nis summarized in Appendix 13. A detailed distribution analysis is available as Supplementary \nAppendix B. \n \nC.  Social Impacts \n \n66.  Currently more than 50% of the population in the project areas live below ADB\u2019s poverty \nline in Bangladesh. The net benefit of the project will be distributed among the following groups: \n(i) users of freight transport, (ii) users of passengers transport, (iii) vehicle owners, (iv) labor, (v) \nthe Government, and (vi) the economy in general. The Project will benefit the entire population \nresiding  in  the  project  areas  through  improved  access  to  resources  and  markets  and  the \ngenerated  income-earning  opportunities.  By  facilitating  economic  growth,  the  Project  will \ncontribute to poverty reduction. The Project will create construction job opportunities of about \n133,000 person-months for both skilled and unskilled workers during project implementation.  \nMen and women will be provided equal opportunity for employment. The summary poverty \nreduction and social strategy is in Appendix 14. \n ", "16   \n67.  The  Project  is  also  expected  to  produce  the  following  nonquantifiable  benefits:  (i) \nimproved  physical  access  to  basic  social  services  such  as  health  clinics  and  schools,  (ii) \nimproved infrastructure safety and efficient enforcement of traffic safety rules, and (iii) inceased \npublic awareness on safety.   \n \n68.  The Project will affect approximately 2,108 structures and required acquisition of 60 \nhectares for right-of-way.  The affected people are approximately 8,204. The total cost for both \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement  is  estimated  to  be  $3.6  million  equivalent.  An  initial \nresettlement plan has been prepared, addressing the scope of resettlement, socioeconomic \ninformation  on  the  affected  people,  policy  framework  and  entitlement  matrix,  resettlement \nobjective  and  strategy,  participation  and  grievance  redress,  institutional  arrangements, \nmonitoring, cost estimates, and implementation schedule. The summary resettlement plan is in \nAppendix 15. A small number of tribal people living in one of the project areas are not directly \naffected by the Project. Therefore, the Project will not involve the ADB policy on indigenous \npeoples. The Government will prepare a full resettlement plan, based on 100% census and \nasset inventory, and submit it to ADB for approval. Civil works contracts will be awarded only \nwhen ADB approves the resettlement plan. \n \nD.  Environmental Impacts \n \n69.  The Project will improve roads that are currently in place. The overall finding of the initial \nenvironmental examination (IEE) is that the Project will not cause significant environmental \nproblems and the potential adverse impacts are manageable. In addition, the Project will not \ndisturb any environmentally sensitive areas. Therefore, a full environment impact assessment \n(EIA) to determine further impacts of the roads involved is not required. However, one of the \nproject roads, the Mymensingh-Nandail road, falls under the red category in Bangladesh\u2019s \nEnvironmental Preservation Rules 1997, which requires a full EIA.15 Civil works for this project \nroad can be started only after the Department of Environment (DOE) issues an environmental \nclearance based on the full EIA. The EIA for the subject road will be prepared as part of the \ndetailed engineering design of the road, and will be submitted to ADB with DOE\u2019s environmental \nclearance before civil works contracts are awarded.  \n \n70.     Implementation  of  mitigation  measures  during  the  construction  stage  will  be  the \nresponsibility  of  the  contractor.  An  environmental  engineer,  who  will  be  hired  as  part  of \nconsulting services for supervision, will assist the Social and Environmental Circle (SEC) of \nRHD in preparing contractual documentation so that the bidding documents, bills of quantity, \nand other contractual obligations of the contractor clearly identify environmental responsibilities \nand describe penalties for noncompliance. RHD together with SEC will be responsible for \nimplementing  overall  environmental  monitoring  and  management  plan.  The  summary \nenvironmental analysis is in Appendix 16. \n \nE.  Risks \n \n71.  The proposed road improvement component does not present exceptional or unusual \nrisks that would require specially designed mitigation measures. RHD, the contractors, and the \nsupervision consultants are all familiar with the kind of works to be financed and have performed \nsatisfactorily in implementing similar works. If the implementation arrangements are properly \nstructured, the risks of failure of the construction works will be minimal. The main risk for the \n                                                           \n15 According to Bangladesh\u2019s Environmental Preservation Rules 1997, any improvement works for national and \nregional roads require a full environmental impact assessment regardless of the types of, and the expected \nenvironmental impact from, improvement works.  ", "  17 \nroad  improvement  component  is  that  inadequate  maintenance  and  truck  overloading  may \nprevent the expected benefit streams from being achieved or, if they are achieved, from being \nsustained. This risk factor will be addressed by incorporating a project component to secure a \nGovernment budget for road maintenance and undertaking policy dialogue to improve axle-load \ncontrol. The economic returns for periodic maintenance are typically high, and the Project will \nfocus on priority maintenance based on the economic ranking of the ARMP. \n \n72.  The notable project risk concerns contracting out of routine maintenance based on a \nperformance-based maintenance contract. Local private contractors may be unfamiliar with this \nnew contract. The performance-based maintenance contract may be poorly designed and thus \nfail to provide the right incentives or penalties to the contractors. This risk will be addressed by \nproviding consulting services for designing the performance-based maintenance contract and \nmonitoring the performance of the contractors.  \n \n73.  The risk in project implementation will be addressed by (i) approving advance action for \nprocurement, (ii) preparing the land acquisition and resettlement plan and EIA by consulting with \nstakeholders, (iii) obtaining the Government\u2019s commitment for counterpart funding, and (iv) \nproviding sufficient resources for supervision consulting services.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \n74.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents:  \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n(i)  The Government will ensure that all counterpart funding required for the \nProject in accordance with the financing plan \uf8e7 including the cost of land \nacquisition,  other  resettlement  compensation,  and  implementation  and \nmonitoring  under  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan,  utility \nrelocation, and general project management expenses \uf8e7 will be fully \nprovided in a timely manner through approved annual development plan \nallocations. \n \n(ii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nactivities are implemented in accordance with all applicable laws and \nregulation, and ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement, as set out in the \nagreed upon resettlement plan, including \n \n(a) land and rights-of-way acquired in a proper and timely manner; \n(b) compensation and entitlements as stipulated in the resettlement plan; \n(c) timely provision of counterpart funds and disbursements to affected \npeoples; \n(d) guarantee  to  meet  unforeseen  obligations  in  excess  of  budget \nestimate; \n(e) adequate  supervision,  monitoring,  and  reporting  by  the  Executing \nAgency; \n(f)  external  monitoring  and  evaluation  by  a  competent  independent \nagency (consultant or NGO); \n(g) annual audit of resettlement fund disbursements and expenditures; ", "18   \n(h) adequate  information  dissemination  and  consultation  with  affected \npeoples; \n(i)  documentation of consultation and grievances;  \n(j)  updated resettlement plan if the scope of the Project is changed; and \n(k) regular reporting of progress to ADB.  \n \n(iii)  The Government will ensure that all environmental mitigation measures \nidentified in the IEE and to be identified in the EIA are incorporated into \nthe project design and followed during project construction, operation and \nmaintenance in consultation with, DOE, and in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nEIA requirements.  \n \n(iv)  The Government will ensure that civil work contractors comply with all \napplicable labor laws, do not employ child labor for construction and \nmaintenance activities, and provide appropriate facilities for children in \nconstruction campsites. The Government will set employment targets for \nwomen for road construction activities, and will require contractors not to \ndifferentiate wages between men and women for work of equal value. A \nspecific clause will be included in bidding documents, and compliance will \nbe strictly monitored during project implementation. \n \n(v)  The Government will ensure that an adequate number of information and \neducation campaigns on sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS16 \nfor construction workers will be conducted at worksites as part of the \nhealth and safety program. \n \n(vi)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  loan  proceeds  for  routine  road \nmaintenance  will  be  used  for  contracting  out  routine  maintenance  of \nabout 50 km of regional or type A feeder roads through a performance-\nbased maintenance contract for 3-5 years.  \n \n(vii)  The Government will ensure that within 18 months of loan effectiveness, \nsupervision consultants will carry out a feasibility study for privatizing \nRHD\u2019s road maintenance equipment and workshops, and develop a time-\nbound action plan for implementing its recommendations. \n \n(viii)  Within 1 year of loan effectiveness, the Government will submit to the \nParliament a draft Road Transport and Traffic Act that will replace the \nMotor Vehicles Ordinance.  \n \n(ix)  The Government will absorb the current staff resources in BRTA Road \nSafety Cell financed under the World Bank\u2019s Road Rehabilitation and \nMaintenance Project 3, and provide sufficient budget for the Road Safety \nCell to carry out its tasks as secretariat to NRSC. \n \n                                                           \n16  HIV/AIDS = Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. ", "  19 \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n \n(i)  The Government will approve a project proforma for the Project.  \n \n(ii)  The terms for the administration of the OPEC loan as set forth in a draft of \nthe  OPEC  Administration  Agreement  will  have  been  agreed  upon \nbetween ADB and OPEC Fund. \n \nC.  Conditions for Contract Award for Civil Works \n \n(i)  The Government will ensure that, after detailed design and before award \nof civil works contracts, a full land acquisition survey, 100 per cent census \nof people affected, and 100% asset inventory, are required to finalize the \nresettlement  plan.  This  would  provide  a  final  head  count  of  affected \npeople, and final measurement of losses in terms of numbers of assets \nlost, broken down by category of loss and category of entitled person, and \napplicable rates per category. Affected people include both those affected \nthrough loss of assets and those affected through loss of livelihood. The \nresettlement budget should be revised based on the new data collected, \nand any additional land acquisition and resettlement cost will be borne by \nthe Government. This full resettlement plan will be submitted to ADB for \nreview and approval before award of civil works contracts. \n \n(ii)  The Government will prepare a full EIA for Mymensingh-Nandail road as \npart  of  detailed  designing  and  submit  it  with  DOE\u2019s  environmental \nclearance to ADB before award of civil works contract. \n \n(iii)  RHD will (i) appoint the supervision consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants; and (b) acquire or make available \nthe land and the rights to land, free from any encumbrances, required for \nthe execution of the Project before award of civil works contract. \n  \nD.  Condition of Disbursement for Civil Works for the Jamalpur-Dewanganj \nRoad (contract No. 3) and Saidpur-Parbatipur Road (contract No. 4) \n \n(i)  The OPEC Fund Loan Agreement will have been duly executed and \ndelivered, and all conditions precedent to its effectiveness will have been \nfulfilled. \n \n(ii)  The Government will have submitted to ADB a legal opinion stating that \nthe OPEC Fund Loan Agreement has been duly authorized or ratified by, \nand executed and delivered on behalf of, the Government and OPEC \nFund, and is legally binding upon OPEC Fund and the Government in \naccordance  with  its  terms,  subject  to  the  fulfillment  of  the  conditions \nprecedent to its effectiveness. \n ", "20   \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n75.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB and recommend that the Board approve (i) the loan in various currencies equivalent to \nSpecial  Drawing

The Project involves improving 47 kilometers (km) of regional roads and 127 km of type \nA feeder roads in Mymensingh region and in Rangpur region. \n \n2.   The  roads  or  road  sections  to  be  improved  under  the  Project  were  traditionally \nconstructed with sand seal surfacing or thin bituminous carpeting over brick macadam base, \nwhich have deteriorated and do not satisfy international standards in alignment, cross section, \nand pavement structure. The suggested improvements are full reconstruction following the \ncurrent alignment, but including widening and correcting substandard curves.  \n \n3.   As required by the terms of reference for the project preparatory technical assistance \n(TA 3508-BAN: Road Network Improvement and Maintenance I), the consultant conducted the \nfeasibility study for the project roads and prepared preliminary designs. The TA consultant  \ndesigned the project roads in accordance with current international standards and procedures \nbut largely followed Geometric Design Standards of RHD (unpublished), and Guidelines for \nBridge Design by RHD, respectively, for cross section parameters of roads and structural \nconfigurations. The principal international standards that were adopted follow: \n \n(i)  For  the  highway  alignment  design:  TRRL.  UK.  1998.  Recommendations  of \nTransport and Road Research Laboratory, Overseas Road Note 6; and American \nAssociation of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO). 1994. A \nPolicy on Geometric Design of Highway and Streets.  \n(ii)  TRRL. UK, and AASHTO.  Method for Design of Pavements. Oversedas Road \nNote 31.  \n(iii)  For  bridges  and  other  drainage  structures:  AASHTO.  1996.  Standard \nSpecifications for Highway Bridges. \n(iv)  For materials, AASHTO and American Society for Testing and Materials methods \nwere used. \n \n2.   Horizontal and Vertical Geometry and Cross Sections \n \n4.   Traffic counts were taken during the feasibility study, and projections were developed for \nthe 20-year project evaluation period. The projections were used to determine physical capacity \nrequirements in terms of number and width of lanes for motorized and nonmotorized traffic, and \nintersection layouts. A design speed of 85 km per hour for national and regional roads and 65 \nkm for feeder roads was adopted and the horizontal and vertical alignments were designed \naccordingly. \n \n5.   Cross sections were developed from traffic projections for motorized and nonmotorized \ntraffic, and the terrain. The cross section consists of motorized traffic lanes of 7.3 m, 5.5 m, and \n3.65  m,  respectively,  for  national,  regional,  and  type  A  feeder  roads,  with  two  surfaced \nshoulders of 1.5 m for all types of road except for the pilot feeder road, which will have 2.0 m \nhard shoulders. A feature that adds to the overall cost but is considered necessary for reasons \nof safety and traffic flow efficiency is surfaced shoulders along the length of each project road. \nThe shoulders will provide space for nonmotorized and slow motorized traffic as well as space ", "      Appendix 3  25   \nfor vehicle repairs, tire replacement, or mechanical breakdown, without disturbing traffic flow or \nposing high traffic safety risks. \n \n3.  Pavements \n \n6.   The pavements were designed in accordance with accepted international standards and \nprocedures for a 20-year life, with provision for overlays during or at the end of 10 years to \ncover the serviceability loss and extend the life to 20 years while maintaining international \nroughness index at recommended level. The designs will be based on traffic counts and traffic \nprojections (for capacity), and axle-load surveys and projections (for structural capacity). The \npavement structure will consist typically of an improved subgrade, a granular subbase of brick \naggregate, a base of stone aggregate, asphaltic concrete surfacing (base course and wearing \ncourse),  or  double  bituminous  surface  dressing.  Roughness  values  for  the  completed \npavements, expressed in international roughness index terms, should be 2.0-2.5. \n \n4.   Bridges and Drainage Structures \n \n7.   The structures were designed in accordance with AASHTO standards. AASHTO HS20 \nlive  loading  was  adopted  and  the  return  period  of  20  years  was  considered  for  drainage \nstructures.  Improvement  of  structures  includes  (i)  rehabilitating  bridges/culvert  decks,  and \nwidening structures according to road section and RHD guidelines; (ii) reconstructing  structures \nthat must be replaced because of structural and hydrological inadequacy; and (iii) constructing \nnew structures on realigned sections.  \n \n B.

The work will be divided into two annual tranches and will be \nimplemented over two years. Each tranche will cover civil works valued at about $8 million \nequivalent, providing for periodic maintenance of about 200 kilometers (km) of roads. \n \n2.  Roads to be included will need Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) approval. The will be \nselected annually in order of estimated economic returns, based on the rankings produced each \nyear by the ARMP, and subject to the criteria listed below. Among roads satisfying the listed \ncriteria, preference will be given to roads that were previously improved with ADB assistance. \nThe criteria for selecting subprojects for the periodic maintenance program are as follows: \n \n(i)  The roads are included in RHD\u2019s ARMP and have been given priority in periodic \nmaintenance tasks, using the Highway Design and Maintenance Standards Model. \n \n(ii)  The  roads  are  located  within  the  districts  of  Dinajpur,  Gaibandha,  Kurigram, \nLalmonirhat, Nilphamari, Panchagarh, Rangpur, and Thakurgaon in the northwest \nregion, and Jamalpur, Kishoreganj, Mymensingh, Netrokona, and Sherpur in the \ncentral north region. \n \n(iii)  The proposed civil works will be limited to periodic maintenance consisting of \noverlay  and  sealing  works,  but  excluding  road  development,  upgrading,  and \nwidening. \n \n(iv)  Based on a minimum 10-year evaluation period using full life cycle costs and \nbenefits, the estimated economic internal rate of return for the road maintenance \nworks will be at least 20%. \n \n(v)  The proposed works will not adversely affect the environment and will include \nmitigation measures when environment impacts are anticipated. \n \n(vi)  Sufficient Government counterpart funding from the RHD budget will be allocated \nto implement the works as scheduled. \n \n(vii)  To facilitate efficient subproject implementation and to encourage participation by \nqualified contractors, the civil works will be arranged in packages each with an \nestimated value of at least $1.0 million. ", "28  Appendix 5 \nPERFORMANCE-BASED MAINTENANCE CONTRACT \n \nA.  Concept \n \n1.  A performance-based maintenance contract is an agreement between a government \ndepartment or state enterprise and a private contractor whereby the private contractor maintains \nthe road to achieve specified condition standards for a certain period of time (usually long-term, \nranging from 3 to 10 years) in return for a fixed payment stream. \n \n2.  The concept of a performance-based contract originated from a consideration of (i) the \nincreasing lack of personnel within the government department to measure the vast quantity of \nactivities involved in the more traditional maintenance contracts, and to monitor performance \nstandards using input indicators; (ii) the frequency of claims resulting from the need to increase \nthe quantity of activities in the original contracts; (iii) the need to focus more on customer \nsatisfaction; and (iv) the need to shift greater responsibility to contractors throughout the entire \ncontract period, as well as to stimulate and profit from their innovative capabilities.1 \n \n3.  The performance-based contract is different from a traditional quantity- and unit-price-\nbased, short-term maintenance contract. In the traditional maintenance contract, the private \nsector maintains an existing road based on input indicators, such as materials, equipment, and \nlabor, and more frequently, tons of pothole patch material used, number of linear meters of pipe \nculverts replaced, and number of square meters of crack sealed. In the performance-based \ncontract,  the  private  sector  maintains  an  existing  road  on  the  basis  of  customer-based \nperformance indicators, such as riding and strength quality (smoothness), safety features, and \naesthetic and attractiveness of the roadside. \n \n4.  The  performance-based  contract  is  also  different  from  a  road  operation  and \nmaintenance  concession.  Under  the  performance-based  contract,  performance  risks  are \nallocated between the government/client and the contractor. However, the traffic risk remains \nwith  the  government.  Under  the  road  operation  and  maintenance  concession,  the \nconcessionaire  assumes  the  traffic  and,  ultimately,  the  revenue  risks.  The  concessionaire \ncollects toll, maintains the road, and pays an agreed-upon amount to the government. Since the \nrisk  from  uncertain  traffic  is  to  be  borne  by  the  private  sector,  the  road  operation  and \nmaintenance concession is suitable only for roads with sufficient traffic volume. For low-volume \nroads, the performance-based contract may prove a promising alternative modality for private \nsector participation in road maintenance. \n \n5.  Performance-based maintenance is especially suitable for low-volume roads with gravel \nsurface or thin bituminous surface treatments, as the continued serviceability of such roads \ndepends on the quality and reliability of future maintenance. It offers an effective means to \nimprove the efficiency and public accountability of road maintenance operations. Other benefits \ninclude improved service to road users and reduced size of the government establishment (staff, \nequipment, and workshops) needed for road maintenance operations. In the long run, this \napproach will significantly reduce the unit cost of maintenance operations while improving the \nquality and cost-effectiveness of maintenance works. \n \nB.  Monitoring of Maintenance Performance \n \n6.  The contractor is responsible for maintaining the road at performance standards agreed \nupon in the contract. These standards should be defined with the aim of minimizing the long-\n                                                           \n1 Cabana, G, G Liautaud, and A Faiz. 1999.

Performance Specified Road Maintenance Contracts-The Road to the Future: The Latin \nAmerican Perspective. The 21st World Road Congress, Kuala Lumpur, 3-9 October. \n \n7.  Vital to the success of the performance-based contract are appropriate and well-defined \nmonitoring procedures, combined with penalties for noncompliance. Inspectors may be hired to \ninspect the road and make random checks regularly to verify compliance. Road users may also \nbe  encouraged  to  take  an  important  role  in  monitoring  performance  by  reporting  road \ndeficiencies to the road agency. A percentage of noncompliance may be calculated based on a \nformula incorporated in the contract, by which penalties are applied. \n \nC.  Bidding Processes \n \n8.  The guiding principle for the bidding processes should be to maximize competition and \nclarity of the process. The major aspects that should be considered to ensure competitive and \ntransparent bidding processes are as follows: \n \n(i)  Detailed development of the contract should be set out clearly in the bidding \ndocuments, specifying the responsibilities of the contractor and the government. \n \n(ii)  A draft contract agreement should be prepared by the government and included \nin the bidding documents to ensure that all bidders make similar assumptions. \n \n(iii)  The evaluation criteria should be clearly set out in the bidding documents. The \nmost transparent approach is to select a single criterion, perhaps the lowest level \nof bid price for a given performance specification. The decision should be made \nonly after prequalification procedures where potential bidders are evaluated in \nterms of their technical, operational, and financial capacity. \n ", "  30         Appendix 6\nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN\n($ million)\nProject Cost Financing Source\nForeign Local Total OPEC\nItem Exchange Currency Cost ADB Government Fund\nA.

General \n \n1.  The principal project component comprises improvement of six roads in poor condition.  \nThree roads \uf8e7 a regional road and two type A feeder roads \uf8e7 are located in the north-central \nregion and three type A feeder roads are in the north-west region. The main quantifiable \nbenefits from these investments are savings in road user costs (vehicle operating costs [VOCs] \nand time costs) for traffic using the roads.   \n \nB.  Traffic Analysis and Projections \n \n1.  Base Year Traffic \n \n2.  For purposes of traffic analyses, representative vehicles (Table A12.1, column 1) were \nselected based on traffic surveys.  The 2001 base year traffic was estimated on the basis of \nhistorical trends, classified traffic counts, an origin-destination (O-D) survey carried out in the \nproject areas, and a seasonal adjustment factor. \n \nTable A12.1:  Base Year Traffic, by Project Road, 2001 \n(No.) \nRepresentative  Muktagacha-  Mymensingh-  Jamalpur-  Mithapukur-  Thakurgaon-  Saidpur- \nVehicle  Chechua  Nandail   Dewanganj  Madhyaparaa  Ranisankail  Parbatipur \nMotorized \nHeavy Truck  0  0  0  20  0  0 \nMedium Truck  224  228  29  193  69  162 \nSmall Truck  37  88  63  73  21  37 \nLarge Bus  60  251  11  30  11  4 \nMedium Bus  69  51  8  82  67  91 \nMicro Bus  52  104  10  38  28  63 \nCar  55  65  8  64  4  19 \nUtility  92  65  21  107  40  112 \nAuto-Rickshaw  197  91  111  110  196  10 \nMotorcycle  258  306  326  639  803  454 \nTotal Motorized  1,044  1,249  587  1,356  1,239  952 \nNonmotorized \nBicycle  927  1,134  2,071  3,660  1,706  3,907 \nRickshaw  1,831  1,478  3,098  1,229  1,268  2,754 \nCart  0  8  229  6  0  0 \nTotal Nonmotorized 2,758  2,620  5,398  4,895  2,974  6,661 \na\n  Year 2006 traffic. There is no year 2001 traffic as one section of this road is currently not open to traffic, Year 2006 \ntraffic was estimated taking into account traffic diversion from two other roads. \n \n2.   Traffic Projections \n \n3.  Traffic projections were developed from an analysis of historical traffic growth patterns in \nrelation to growth in gross domestic product (GDP), population, vehicle fleet, and industrial \nproduction; and where applicable, such as for the road, taking into account estimates of traffic \ndiversion based on O-D analyses.  The key factors in the traffic projection are growth in GDP \nand the elasticity of traffic to GDP growth.  Over the analysis period \uf8e7 2002-2026 \uf8e7 GDP is \nprojected to grow in a range of 5.0% - 5.5% and the elasticity of transport demand is projected \nin a range of 1.20-1.35.  The resultant traffic growth factors are shown in Table A12.2. \n \n   ", "       Appendix 12  43 \n \nTable A12.2: Traffic Growth, by Vehicle Category \n(%) \nPeriod  Motorized  Nonmotorized \nPassenger  Freight   \n2002 \u2013 2007  7.4  7.2  6 \n2007 \u2013 2012  6.9  6.6  5 \n2012 \u2013 2026  6.3  6.0  5 \n \n4.  The road improvements will also give rise to generated traffic, i.e., traffic that did not \nexist before the investment.  Additional traffic will be generated as a result of the increased \nattractiveness of the project area for agricultural production and business activities following \nreduced VOCs.  Generated traffic was estimated conservatively at 10% of normal traffic. \n \nC.  Economic Evaluation \n \n1.  Benefits and Beneficiaries \n \n5.  The direct and quantifiable benefits of the project consist of savings in VOCs to normal \ntraffic (and diverted traffic where applicable), and savings in time costs. Nonquantifiable benefits \ninclude greater comfort for passengers and reduced damage to cargo. Indirect benefits are \nthose arising from secondary effects brought about by the reduction in VOCs and time costs, \nwhich brings about increased economic activities. These benefits have been estimated in the \nform of generated passenger and cargo traffic.   \n \n6.  The beneficiaries include (i) those benefiting directly from the investments, i.e., the \nvarious categories of road users such as owners of buses and trucks, passengers of the \nvarious vehicle categories, cyclists and pedestrians, cargo owners, and those involved in \nthe production of the cargo; and (ii) those benefiting indirectly because they live and work in \nthe area of influence of the roads. The latter population is estimated at some 2.75 million \npeople when the zone of influence is taken as a band of 15 km (7.5 km on either side of the \nroad). It is also estimated that about 50% of this population is living below the (upper) \npoverty line.1 This population is expected to benefit because the road investments will \nalleviate the underlying causes of poverty in the area by facilitating economic integration \nand economic development on which the realization of the area\u2019s broader needs\u2013medical \nfacilities, schools, and livelihood opportunities\u2013ultimately depends. \n \n2.  Evaluation Approach \n \n7.  The evaluation examines investment and maintenance costs, traffic, road condition and \nVOCs and time costs with and without the project over a period of 20 years following completion \nof the road, and identifies and estimates the differences in cost between the two cases. All costs \nelements are valued at border prices, using a world price numeraire, with all taxes and duties \nexcluded. A standard conversion factor of 0.8 was applied to nontraded items and labor. This \nevaluation was carried out using the Highway Design and Maintenance Model 4 (HDM 4), which \nhas been calibrated for conditions in Bangladesh under the Institutional Development Project \nsponsored by the main funding agencies to the road sector. Under the without-project case, only \nmaintenance and minimum spot improvements would be carried out, while the with-the-project \n                                                 \n1  Upper poverty line:  the level of per capita income or consumption at which the members of a household can be \nexpected to meet their basic food consumption needs \u2013 i.e., to meet their calorie intake requirements \u2013 as well as \nsome essential nonfood consumption.   \n ", "44  Appendix 12 \ncase provides for major improvement.  For generated traffic, half of the VOC savings of normal \ntraffic was adopted. \n \n3.  Technical Options \n \n8.  The engineering evaluations examined the feasibility of rehabilitating only the pavement \nthrough an overlay. This was not found viable due to the poor quality of the pavement layers \nand of the subgrade and embankment. Full reconstruction was found to be the only viable \nalternative as the existing structure would not be able to withstand expected pavement loadings. \nUnder the reconstruction alternative, two options were evaluated: \n \nOption 1: full reconstruction of the existing pavement, with repair and maintenance of \nexisting structures but without widening or hard shoulders. \n \nOption 2: full reconstruction of the existing pavement with widening of embankments, \nconstruction of new structures and rehabilitation of existing structures, and including \nhard shoulders and widening where justified.  \n \n9.  Option  2  was  selected  because  all  the  roads  carry  a  substantial  amount  of  non-\nmotorized traffic and the wider pavement and hard shoulders provide additional benefits mainly \nthrough higher speeds, which are not fully reflected in the quantification of road user savings. In \naddition, the hard shoulders provide significant qualitative benefits \uf8e7 comfort and safety \uf8e7 to \nnonmotorized traffic, a large portion of whom are the poor. One of the roads was therefore \nselected as a pilot case for provision of wider, hard shoulders for nonmotorized traffic.   \n \n4.  Construction Costs \n \n10.  The economic costs of road construction and maintenance are expressed in early 2002 \nprices (Table A12.3) and were derived from the financial costs by deducting taxes and duties \nfrom the costs of imported equipment and materials and applying a standard conversion factor \nof 0.8 for nontraded items and labor. The costs cover physical contingencies, land acquisition, \nenvironmental mitigation, and resettlement as well as construction supervision. \n \nTable A12.3: Construction Costs \n(Tk million) \nRoad  Per km  Total \nMuktagacha-Chechua  27.1    271.2 \nMymensingh-Nandail  30.3    1,424.6 \nJamalpur-Dewanganj  20.8    850.9 \nMithapukur-Madhyapara  24.8       595.2 \nThakurgaon-Ranisankail  18.5    684.4 \nSaidpur-Parbatipur  31.1    466.8 \n \n5.  Vehicle Operating Cost and Time Costs \n \n11.  VOCs for the representative motorized vehicles are those prepared by RHD under the \ninstitutional development component (IDC). They were derived from financial costs by excluding \nfrom  various  cost  components  all  applicable  duties  and  taxes  such  as  customs  duty, \ndevelopment surcharge, supplementary duty, value added tax, advance income tax, and landing \npermit fee. For fuels, the economic costs of petrol, diesel, and lubricants were calculated by \n   ", "       Appendix 12  45 \n \nexcluding the tariff and other implicit taxes and including the economic cost of distribution \nexpenses. For conversion of financial costs to economic ones, a standard conversion factor of \n0.8 was used. For nonmotorized vehicles, the cost and operating parameters developed by \nRHD under the IDC were also used.

The economic costs of passenger time are based on the findings of several studies \ncarried out in Bangladesh and estimates developed by RHD based, among others, on primary \nsurveys carried out in different parts of the country. For freight, the time cost estimate was \nbased on the cost of working capital tied up in representative trucks in the area of influence \nusing cargo flows obtained in the O-D surveys.

Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) and Net Present Value (NPV) \n \n13.  The EIRR for each road was estimated for both improvement options 1 and 2 using the \nHDM-4 evaluation model, which compares the streams of costs and benefits under the with- \nand without-the-project scenarios. It was assumed that construction would be spread over 3 \nyears with about 20% of the works being completed in the first year, 40% in the second year, \nand 40% in the third. It was assumed that periodic maintenance or overlays or both are applied \nevery 6-8 years depending on traffic loading. The salvage value of the road at the end of the 20-\nyear evaluation period is estimated at 20% under improvement option 2.   \n \n ", "46  Appendix 12 \n14.  At 12% discount, NPV calculated for each project road ranges from Tk390 million to \nTk2.2 billion. The consolidated NPV for six roads amounts to Tk5.4 billion.

Risk and Sensitivity Analysis \n \n15.  A review of the various factors affecting on the EIRR indicates that the main risk in the \nviability  of  the  investment  is  premature  road  failure  due  to  inadequate  maintenance  and \noverloading. The Project includes measures to address these risks by helping the government \nto establish and implement appropriate policies. \n \n16.  Various sensitivity tests indicate that the EIRR is robust in relation to construction cost \nincreases on the order of 15-20 %.  The EIRR, however, is sensitive to benefits derived from \nnonmotorized traffic. Accordingly, the EIRR was tested for a 30% reduction in benefits from \nnonmotorized traffic.

Introduction \n \n1.  The poverty impacts of the Project are reviewed and analyzed from three perspectives: \n(i) how the approach to developing the Project and its design features contributed to enhancing \nits poverty reduction impacts; (ii) how the Project benefits are distributed among the various \ncategories of road users and who among those road users are poor people; and (iii) how the \neffects of the Project are allocated among a broader group of project participants including \u2013 in \naddition to road users \u2013 lenders, construction labor, and the government (also representing the \nrest of the economy). \n \nB.  Project Development and Design Features  \n \n2.  Selection  of  Project  Area  and  of  Project  Roads.  To  ensure  that  the  project \nbeneficiaries include a high proportion of the poor, the project regions and project roads were \ncarefully selected at different stages, with a strong poverty focus present at every stage. First, \nthe target area where the project roads were selected comprises some of the poorest districts in \nthe country. Second, roads in the area were screened based on criteria including the socio-\neconomic profile of the districts and of their population, expected poverty reduction impacts, \nroad conditions, traffic, road network requirements, and input from stakeholders through an \nextensive process of consultations. In the third and final stage, a selection was made from \namong the roads screened, taking into account the funding constraint.   \n \n3.  Technical Design. The technical features were designed so as to address the key \nneeds and concerns of poor people among the beneficiaries. The road designs not only provide \nfor wider shoulders than the standard so far, in addition, the shoulders will be surfaced. These \nfeatures will ensure much improved road space and riding conditions for nonmotorized vehicles, \nthe mode used overwhelmingly by the poorer sections of the population.   \n \n4.  Targeted Implementation Arrangements. In addition, targeted arrangements during \nthe construction phase are designed to benefit the poor. A first implementation feature is labor \nrecruitment from the project area. The Project will disburse sizable expenditures for skilled, \nsemi-skilled,  and  unskilled  labor.  Unskilled  labor  and  half  of  the  semiskilled  labor  can  be \nrecruited from the project area by incorporating labor recruitment requirements in the contracts. \nThe funds that will be directly injected in the local economy from employment of locally recruited \nlabor would amount to some Tk355 million based on estimates of the number of labor-days of \nskilled, semiskilled, and unskilled labor for road construction and using local labor rates.   \n \n5.  A second feature is procurement of goods and services from the project area. During the \nconstruction phase, the Project will generate a considerable demand for goods and services \nthat can be purchased in the project area, thereby benefiting the local population. The contract \ndocuments will include provisions to ensure that goods and services are procured in a manner \nthat will benefit local suppliers.   \n \n6.  A third feature relates to gender equity. Women are expected to participate in the \nemployment generated by the works. The construction contracts will include provisions ensuring \nthat women employed in road construction activities will receive comparable pay for comparable \nwork. \n ", "48  Appendix 13 \nC.  Distribution of Project Benefits Among Road Users \n \n7.  The aim of distribution analysis is to estimate (i) the proportion of the project benefits \nthat accrues to each category of road users, i.e., vehicle owners or operators, passengers, \ncargo owners, farmers and laborers involved in producing the cargo; and (ii) the proportion that  \naccrues to poor people. More specifically, estimation of the distribution of the net benefits \ninvolves five steps. \n \n8.  Identifying Beneficiaries and the Non-Poor by Vehicle Type. Vehicles are classified \ninto six categories for the analysis: (i) buses; (ii) trucks; (iii) cars, utility vehicles, motorcycles; \n(iv)  tempos  (auto  rickshaw);  (v)  rickshaws;  (vi)  bicycles.  For  each  category,  potential \nbeneficiaries  can  be  identified,  such  as  bus  owners  and  bus  passengers;  truck  owners, \nbusinessmen, farmers, and laborers; owners of cars, utility vehicles, motorcycles, passengers, \nand drivers; tempo owners, drivers, and passengers; rickshaw owners and passengers; and \ncyclists. Several of these beneficiaries \uf8e7 bus owners; truck owners; owners, passengers and \ndrivers of cars, utility vehicles, and motorcycles; and tempo owners \uf8e7 can safely be classified \nas non-poor without risk of error.  However, the benefits that accrue to them need to be \nestimated and separated out from the total benefits generated by the Project.   \n \n9.  Distributing Benefits Between Vehicle Owners and Clients.  How the benefits will \naccrue to the vehicle owners on the one hand and to the clients \uf8e7 i.e., passengers, cargo \nowners, and those involved in producing the cargo \uf8e7 on the other depends on the organization, \nstructure, and competitiveness of the local transport and product markets. For buses (large, \nmicro and mini), tempo vehicles, and rickshaws, it is necessary to examine these markets to \ndetermine how the benefits are distributed between owners and passengers. For cargo, it is \nalso  necessary  to  examine  the  trucking  markets  to  determine  the  distribution  of  benefits \nbetween the parties concerned. For the category of cars, utility vehicles, and motorcycles, 100%  \nof the savings accrue to the non-poor and further investigation is not required. In the case of \nbicycles, the owner and the user are the same and, hence, it is necessary to examine only the \npoverty status of the rider. \n \n10.  For buses, there are essentially two segments in the market: (i) the low-cost, regulated \nsegment; and (ii) the luxury bus segment, which is unregulated. The former represents a major \ntraffic category on the project roads, while the latter does not. Bangladesh Road Transport \nAuthority  (BRTA)  sets  fares  at  the  national  level,  and  there  are  strong  pressures  from \ngovernment  to  keep  fares  low.  The  standard  bus  fare  had  remained  constant  at \nTk0.32/kilometer (km) from the 1980s to the 1990s and increased to Tk0.47/km in 2001. The \nstandard fare at the national level implies cross subsidization between roads featuring low VOC \nand roads with high VOC. The effect of the regime is that it will not be possible to witness fare \nreductions on particular roads as a result of VOC  savings arising from improvements on these \nroads.   \n \n11.  However, this regime does not preclude passing on the bus passengers part of the \nbenefits of nationwide programs of road improvement. This is possible through a lagging of fare \nincreases in response to continuing increases in input costs (depreciation, parts, fuel, labor, \netc). The impact of delayed fare increases on the real cost of bus transport was examined by \nmodeling the situation that prevailed in Bangladesh during the 1980s and 1990s. The finding is \nthat the lagging effectively provides bus passengers with part of the benefits of nationwide road \nimprovements, i.e., 60-70% of the savings are passed on. Thus, all bus passengers in the \nnation benefit from improvements on the project roads while the bus passengers on the project \n ", "      Appendix 13  49 \nroads benefit from all other road improvements in the nation. Based on these findings it was \nassumed that bus passengers will be the beneficiary of 55% of the savings resulting from road \nimprovements. \n \n12.  For tempo vehicles, the market is essentially unregulated. At the local level, entry is \norganized through the owners associations. Businessmen typically own 3-5 vehicles that are \nrented out on a daily basis to drivers. Rates charged by the drivers vary according to market \nand road conditions. Thus, owners will gain from road improvements through reduced wear and \ntear and reduced maintenance costs. Drivers will gain on account of a potentially higher volume \nof activity as a result of faster speeds and lower fuel consumption. Passengers will gain in \nparticular because the local markets on the project roads are competitive. Therefore, it is \nestimated that 80 percent of the savings to tempo vehicles from improvements on the project \nroads will accrue to tempo passengers. \n \n13.  For rickshaws, the market situation is comparable to that for tempo vehicles.  A rickshaw \nis either owned by a small businessman and rented out on a daily basis to pullers or, to a lesser \nextent, owned by the puller or his family. For most typical runs, there are standard fares that \ntake road conditions into account. Owners will gain from road improvements through reduced \nwear and tear on vehicles and reduced maintenance costs.  Pullers will gain on account of lower \neffort and faster speeds.  Passengers will gain on account of lower fares and faster speeds. It is \nestimated that 80% of the savings will accrue to passengers. \n \n14.  As regards cargo, trucking markets are very competitive with rates being negotiated \nbetween truckers and cargo owners or merchants and the outcome being related to various \nfactors,  the  principal  ones  being  supply  and  demand  and  road  conditions.  However,  the \ndistribution  of  the  benefits  of  road  improvements  between  truck  owners  and \nbusinessmen/merchants on the one hand and farmers and laborers on the other depends \nlargely on the competitive conditions in the product markets. Thus, knowledge of the nature of \nthe cargo movements and of the product markets is essential. Detailed information on the \ncommodities  being  transported  in  the  project  regions  was  obtained  through  the  origin-\ndestination survey of a sample of 2,770 trucks. Cargo movements were consolidated in broad \ncategories: food grains, building materials, fruits and vegetables, cement, fertilizer, coal, iron \nand steel, sand, jute, edible oil, and general cargo.  \n \n15.  In general, product markets for the commodities concerned are relatively competitive.  \nPrices for agricultural produce are determined mainly by the forces of supply and demand, and \na reduction in VOC will be passed on largely to farmers. This is because at the margin, following \ntransport cost reductions, additional production will become viable and bring about an increase \nin farmgate prices.  Prices for agricultural inputs (e.g., fertilizer) are competitive at the retail level \nwith the result that a large proportion of VOC will also be passed on to farmers. For building \nmaterials a distinction needs to be made between materials sourced within the region (sand, \nbricks, rock) and materials imported into the region. For the former, supply is from a large \nnumber of small producers and demand also comes from a relatively large number of buyers; \nthis allows cost savings to be shared between the two groups. For building materials imported \nwithin the region, there are alternative sources of supply and the retail markets are competitive \nso that a good proportion of the savings will be passed on to the final buyers. For general cargo \n(mainly consumer products of various kinds) retail markets are competitive and a fair proportion \nof the savings will be passed on to consumers. \n \n16.  Insight into these market conditions allows apportioning the benefits by commodity group \nto the various parties concerned: truck owners, merchants, and businessmen (who are non-\n ", "50  Appendix 13 \npoor) on the one hand, and farmers, laborers, and consumers (among whom there are both \npoor and non-poor) on the other.  When the estimates of the percentages of benefits accruing to \nthe different parties are weighted by the cargo volumes for each commodity group, it is found \nthat on average 46% of the benefits will accrue to truck owners, merchants, and businessmen, \nand 54% to farmers, laborers, and consumers. \n \n17.  Classification of Passengers, Farmers, Laborers and Consumers According to \nPoverty  Status.  Determining  the  poverty  status  of  passengers  involves  two  steps:  (i) \nestablishing a poverty line1 for the area of the project roads; (ii) assessing the proportion whose \nincome is below the poverty line.  Poverty lines in taka per person per month were established \nfor two regions based on the findings of the Household Expenditure and Income Survey (HEIS) \n\u2013 2000 by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS).  \n \n18.  To determine the proportion for each of the five categories of passengers whose income \nis below or above the poverty line, an extensive program of surveys of randomly selected \npassengers was undertaken on three of the six roads. The average percentage of passengers \nbelow the lower poverty line, below the upper poverty line, and of the nonpoor is shown in Table \nA13.1. \n \nTable A13.1: Poverty Status of Road Users,  Average for 3 Roads \nRoad User Category  % Below the Lower  % Below the Upper  % Non-Poor\nPoverty Line  Poverty Line \nBus rider  40.0  46.9  53.1 \nTempo rider  30.3  42.6  57.4 \nRickshaw rider  49.5  57.9  42.1 \nCyclist  55.9  59.6  40.4 \nPedestrian  60.4  67.3  32.7 \n \n19.  For  cargo,  the  estimate  of  the  poverty  status  of  farmers/laborers  involved  in  the \nproduction of the various commodities being transported and of consumers of the general cargo \nwas based on a review of the socioeconomic profile of the two regions and their population, \nincluding  such  factors  as  the  incidence  of  landless  laborers  and  literacy  rates.  For \nfarmers/laborers in both regions, the proportion below the upper poverty line was estimated at \n65%, which is somewhat above the proportion for the population in the region in general.  It was \nestimated that the same proportion is valid for consumers in the project area.   \n \n20.  Distribution of Benefits to Poor and Non-Poor. This step of the analysis involves \ndistributing the project benefits to non-poor and poor beneficiaries.  For each of the passenger \nvehicle categories, this is done by combining the percentages of the first-level distribution of \nbenefits (between owners and passengers) with the percentages of the second-level distribution \n(between poor and non-poor). For cargo this is done by combining the proportion of savings \naccruing to farmers/laborers and consumers on the one hand, and the proportion of the poor \namong  them  on  the  other.  When  these  proportions  are  weighted  by  the  volumes  of  the \ncommodities being transported, an estimate is obtained of the proportion of the total savings \nthat accrues to people under the poverty line. \n                                                 \n1  Poverty line:  the level of per capita income or consumption at which the members of a household can be expected \nto meet their basic food consumption needs i.e., to meet their calorie intake requirements as well as some essential \nnonfood needs. The difference between the lower and upper poverty lines resides in the difference in the allowance \nfor nonfood consumption as the estimates of the cost of basic food needs are the same for both. The lower poverty \nline incorporates a very minimal allowance for nonfood goods while the upper poverty line includes the typical \nnonfood spending of those who just attained the food requirement. \n ", "      Appendix 13  51 \n21.  When six roads are combined, the proportion of poor is 0% for vehicle owner. For \npassengers,  the  average  percentage  of  the  poor  (among  those  traveling  by  bus,  tempo, \nrickshaw, and bicycle) is 64%; and for those involved in the production (and consumption) of \ncargo (farmers, laborers), the proportion of the poor is 64%.  \n \n22.  Calculating the Poverty Impact Ratio (PIR). Using the percentage of the poor (para. \n22), the net present value of the Project is allocated to road users, and then to the poor and \nnon-poor within each road user group. The results are in Table A13.2 and the key entries are \nelaborated. All amounts are in net present value using a discount rate of 12%.   \n \n23.  The amount of Tk7.2 billion in the column Economic Minus Financial are the savings that \naccrue  to  the  different  categories  of  road  users.  In  the  table,  however,  the  savings  are \ndistributed between vehicle owners on one hand and passengers and cargo on the other.    \n \n(i)  Government of Bangladesh.  The amount of Tk1.73 billion is the present value \nof Government funding to the Project. \n(ii)  Loans, interest, and principal.  The amount of Tk2.71 billion is the present \nvalue  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  and  the  Organization  of  Petroleum-\nExporting Countries Fund financing for the Project, while Tk1.18 billion (interest \nTk0.42 billion and principal Tk0.76 billion) represents the debt service.  The \ndifference  between  the  funding  and  the  debt  service  (Tk1.53  billion)  is  the \nsubsidy implicit in the concessional loan terms.   \n(iii)  Investment and operations & maintenance. The amount of Tk4.44 billion is the \nconstruction cost, which is matched by funding from the Government and the \nlenders during the construction period. \n(iv)  Labor. The amount of Tk437 million is the total amount of (domestic) labor \nexpenditures. The opportunity cost of this labor is estimated at Tk349 million and \nthe difference is a gain for laborers among whom 59% are estimated to be poor \n(all the unskilled and part of the semiskilled). \n(v)  Gains and losses and poverty impact ratio (PIR). The balance of gains and \nlosses of the various parties is Tk7.01 billion.  Out of this total, Tk3.71 billion \naccrues to the poor; hence, the PIR is calculated as 0.53. \n(vi)  Sensitivity test. A sensitivity test that was conducted by lowering the proportion \nof the poor among vehicle passengers from 64% to 50%. The PIR is lowered \nfrom 53% to 43% with a switching value of 86%.  \n ", "5\n2\n       A\np\np\nTable A13.2: Distribution of Net Benefits and Poverty Impact Ratio of Road Improvement Investment e\nn\n(Present Value at 12% Discount Rate) dix\n(Tk Million)  1\n3\nInflows and Outflows Financial  Economic  Economic  Car, Utility Veh.,  Other  Vehicle  Cargo Labor Government Lenders Total\nPresent  Present  Minus-  MC Owners and  Vehicle  Passen \nValue Value Financial Passengers Owners gers\nInflow\nRoad User Benefits         9,332         9,332            903         2,575        5 ,083        771\nGovernment (39% cost sharing)         1,733                 -        (1,733)              ( 1,733)\nLoans (ADB and  OPEC)         2,711                 -        (2,711)        (2,711)\nOutflow\nInvestment and O&M        (4,443)        (3,584)            859                   859\nLabor           (437)           (349)              88            88\nInterest (ADB and OPEC)           (424)                 -            424            424\nPrincipal (ADB & OPEC)           (755)                 -            755            755\nNet Present Value        (1,615)         5,399         7,014            903         2,575        5 ,083        771            88                 ( 874)        (1,532)\nGains and Losses            903         2,575        5 ,083        771            88                 ( 874)        (1,532)     7 ,014\nProportion of Poor (%) 0% 0% 64% 64% 59% 10%\nNet Benefits for the Poor                 -                 -        3 ,253        493            52                   ( 87)     3 ,711\n0.53\nPoverty Impact Ratio Sensitivity Test Ratio of Poor in GOB Net Loss: 50% Total Net Benefit         3 ,361 0.48\nRatio of Poor among Vehicle Passengers: 50Total Net Benefit          2,999 0.43\nADB = Asian Development Bank, O&M = operations and maintenance, OPEC = Organization of Petroleum-Exporting Countries.", "    Appendix 14  53 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nA.

Priority in Country Poverty \n  Partnership Agreement?   \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Bangladesh: \n \nBangladesh made notable progress in income poverty reduction since the last few years \u2013 from \n43% in 1991/92 to 36% in 1995/96. However, this trend masks the fact that poverty at 40% \nremains much higher in the rural areas than in the urban areas at 15%.  There is considerable \nincome disparity across the country.  Per capita income is highest in the urban centers of \neconomic activity. In contrast, people living in the project area have per capita income lower than \nthe  national  average.  More  than  50%  of  the  people  in  project  area  \u2013  Rangpur,  Jamalpur, \nNilphamari, Kishoregonj, Mymensingh, Dinajpur, and Thakurgaon \u2013 live below the poverty line. \nThis Project will be a poverty intervention project, since the proportion of the poor among the \nproject beneficiaries is larger than their proportion in the overall population of the country.  \nPoverty criteria, i.e., districts with a high incidence of poverty, were considered in selecting the \nroad corridors. \n \nThe Project will contribute to poverty reduction in two major ways: by generating income-earning \nopportunities for the poor and improving their physical access to resources and markets. The \nProject is expected to have a positive impact on the socioeconomic development of the region, \nand to provide immediate economic benefits to farmers, merchants, and passengers through \nbetter access to goods and services. The improvement of 174 kilometers of roads will improve \naccess to markets and social facilities. \n \nThrough civil works contracts, the Project will directly generate income-earning opportunities of \n133,000 person-months for the poor in the rural areas, the majority of whom fall below the \npoverty line.  \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Proposed Classification: Poverty Intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nPoverty impact analysis was prepared to estimate both the percentage of the net benefits that  \nwill reach the poor and extremely poor, as well as the number of poor who will receive those \nbenefits. Poverty impact analysis (i) assessed the extent to which transport cost reductions will \nbe passed on to passengers and owners of freight, (ii) assessed the distribution of the benefits \nbetween  them  and  other  group,  and  (iii)  identified  the  proportion  of  poor  and  very  poor \nbeneficiaries and the net benefits they will receive. \n \nPoverty impact indicators to measure the consequences of the Project for the beneficiary will be \ndeveloped. These indicators will be part of the system developed to measure and monitor project \nperformance. In general, the indicators will provide information relating to travel time and cost for \ndifferent purposes by different modes of transport, cash crop produced, rural and urban income, \nlabor participation, school attendance, and use of health clinics. \n ", "5  4  Appendix 14 \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nA participatory approach was adopted in conducting the Technical Assistance. The participatory \nprocess will be implemented by consulting local communities in the project area.  Details of the \nprocess will be based on the final road design and consultations will be conducted throughout \nthe project cycle to ensure that local concerns and suggestions are taken fully into account. \nLocal  community-based  organizations  will  assist  the  contractors  in  identifying  potential \nrecruitment areas. \n \nThe Project will ensure that the affected people and other stakeholders are informed, consulted, \nand encouraged to participate actively during the implementation of the resettlement plan (RP). \nA nongovernment organization will be responsible for carrying out public consultation on a \ncontinuing basis during the implementation of the RP. The coordinator of resettlement and \nrehabilitation activities in the Environment and Resettlement Circle of the Roads and Highways \nDepartment will be responsible for monitoring this activity. A grievance redress committee (GRC) \nwill be established at each project road link when RP implementation starts. The GRC will \ncomprise key stakeholders, including representatives of the affected people and will be chaired \nby the union parishad/ward committee member. \n \n \nD.

Introduction \n \n1.  The summary of the resettlement plan (RP) is based on the resettlement action plan \nprepared  for  affected  persons  (AP)  living  within  the  right-of-way  of  the  Road  Network \nImprovement and Maintenance Project (RNIMP). The RP was prepared by Bangladesh Roads \nand  Highways  Department  (RHD)  through  a  consultative  process  with  key  stakeholders, \nparticularly the AP and host communities. \n \nB.  Scope of Resettlement \n \n2.   In 2001, RHD conducted a socioeconomic survey in Rangpur and Dinajpur areas.  The \nsurvey  identified  the  potentially  affected  properties  and  categorized  them  as  residential, \ncommercial, residential-cum-commercial mixed, and agricultural. Each property category was \nfurther divided into owner, tenant, encroacher, and squatters. The survey found that the Project \nwould affect 2,018 structures and would need for an additional 60 hectares in improving 174 \nkilometers of roads. In this sample, 76% of the structures are in commercial use and 24% in \nresidential use. Commercial structures are mostly small shops used by approximately 60%  \ntenants. In the growth center areas, more than 50% of the structures in commercial use are \npucca,1 overall, only 5% of the structures are pucca and the rest combine tin wall and roof or \nbamboo-thatched wall and roof. \n \nC.  Socioeconomic Information \n \n3.   In 2001, a socioeconomic survey was carried out through interviews of 1,943 (40%) \nsample households. The total population of the surveyed households was about 10,129, an \naverage of 5.5 persons per household. The survey found that 89.5% of the households are \nshopkeepers.  The  literacy  rate  of  the  people  in  the  project  area  was  around  39%.  The \nhousehold expenditure and income data indicates that 12% of the sample households earning \nup to Tk3,000/per month spend up to 102% of their income, indicating their indebtedness. \nHouseholds in the income group Tk3,001 and above have considerable savings, indicating their \nrelative prosperity. Considering all income groups, an average household saves up to 29.8% of \nits  income.  Landholding  is  an  indicator  of  relative  poverty  or  prosperity.  In  Bangladesh  a \nminimum landholding of 0.2 hectare indicates a state of absolute poverty. The limitations of the \nRP  could  record  only  marginal  and  upward  landholding  and  no  landless  household  was \nidentified. In the sample areas overall, approximately 40% of the landholdings are small \u2013 0.4-\n1.2 hectares of agricultural land \u2013 followed by marginal landholdings, 31.4%.   \n \nD.  Policy Framework and Entitlement Matrix \n \n4.  The current legislation governing land acquisition for public purposes in Bangladesh is \nthe Acquisition and Requisition of Immovable Property Ordinance (Ordinance 11 of 1982) and \nits subsequent amendments in 1993 and 1994. The legal process is initiated by an application \nby the requiring agency or department to the deputy commissioner (DC) of the District.  In \ndetermining the amount of compensation for affected owners, the DC considers a number of \nfactors, e.g., present market rate to determine the value of the land. As there is no national \npolicy for resettlement of project-affected people in Bangladesh, the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) policy on involuntary resettlement will be the guideline in this resettlement plan. \n \n                                                 \n1  Pucca means permanent structure: floor, wall, and roof made of concrete.  ", "  Appendix 15  57\n5.  The  project  compensation  policy  and  entitlement  matrix  was  designed  to  cover \ncompensation for lost assets, and restore or enhance the livelihoods of all categories (direct, \nindirect, titleholders and non-titleholders) of AP. The AP will not only receive replacement land \nor cash for land and other assets at market price; many additional measures will be adopted, \nsuch as moving allowance, assistance to households headed by females and other vulnerable \ngroups, to help the AP to regain or improve their lives in the postresettlement period.

Shifting allowance as \nappropriate.  \n \n \nE.  Resettlement Objective and Strategy \n \n5.  The principal objective of the RP is to ensure that AP should be at least as well-off as, if \nnot better-off than, they would have been without the Project. AP should be able to maintain \nand, preferably improve their standard of living and quality of life. AP are defined as those who \nstand to lose, as a consequence of the Project, all or part of physical and nonphysical assets, \nincluding homes, homesteads, productive land, commercial properties, tenancy, income-earning \nopportunities, social and cultural activities and relationships, and other losses that may be \nidentified during the process of resettlement planning. \n \n6.  To achieve the objective, a full range of mitigation measures is available to help AP to \novercome the potentially adverse effects of moving from the current location. Of the 2,108 \nhouseholds potentially affected, approximately 10% may have houses and shops displaced for \nall rights-of-way in six corridors. All households prefer to make their own arrangements for \nresettlement  and  will  be  assisted  during  the  transition  period.  Landless  households, \nnontitleholders,  and  the  ultrapoor  will  be  entitled  to  resettlement  and  income  restoration \nassistance if they have been occupying the affected land for at least 3 years before the census \ncutoff date and do not have title to any other land. It is mandatory that all relocation efforts be \ncompleted 1 month before construction of the main investment project starts. The Project will \nprovide  resettlement  and  rehabilitation  (R&R)  allowance.  After  all  compensation  and  other \nentitlements have been delivered, land titles will be transferred from AP to RHD. \n \nF.  Consultation, Participation, and Grievance Mechanism \n \n7.  The  Project  proposes  to  continue  stakeholder  consultation  throughout  project \nimplementation. It will ensure that the affected population and other stakeholders are informed, \nconsulted,  and  allowed  to  participate  actively  during  implementation.  The  nongovernment \norganization (NGO) project manager at the road link level will be responsible for carrying out \npublic consultations on a continuing basis during implementation, and the R&R coordinator in \nthe Environment and Resettlement Circle (ERC) of RHD will be responsible for monitoring this \nactivity. The summary of the RP was posted on ADB\u2019s web site. Before implementation of the \nRP, a brochure containing the summary of the RP will be disseminated to the APs. \n \n8.  A grievance redress committee (GRC) at each project road link will be set up in sufficient \ntime for AP to lodge complaints during the initial determination of compensation. The GRC will \ncomprise  the  road  link  level  project  manager  (NGO  contractor),  a  project  affected  people \nrepresentative, a union parishad member (in rural areas) or ward committee member (in urban \nareas),  and  the  subdivisional  engineer  of  RHD  for  that  project  road  link.  The  union \nparishad/ward  committee  member  will  chair  this  committee.  The  procedures  of  grievance \nredress were developed to determine the qualified beneficiaries living in the project area.   \n ", "60   Appendix 15 \nG.  Institutional Arrangements \n \n9.  ERC in RHD, headed by an executive engineer, was established under previous ADB \nloan to monitor the R&R activities of the road improvement projects. The main tasks of RHD for \nthe  R&R  activities  involve  resettling  and  rehabilitating  the  affected  persons,  or  otherwise \nmitigating any negative social impacts related to land acquisition for the road improvements. \nWhile the Government acquires land for RHD through the deputy commissioner of an affected \ndistrict, RHD is directly responsible for implementing the R&R activities.   \n \nH.  Monitoring \n \n10.  Internally, ERC will conduct monthly internal monitoring of the progress of the planned \nland acquisition and resettlement activities. The land acquisition officer in the office of the \ndeputy  commissioner  will  assist  RRC  in  monitoring  the  progress  of  land  acquisition.  The \nexternal monitoring and evaluation agency will be commissioned for annual, midterm, and end-\nterm monitoring and evaluation of these activities. \n \nI.  Cost Estimates \n \n11.  Adequate budgetary support is fully committed and will be made available to cover the \ncosts of land acquisition within the agreed upon implementation period. The estimated costs for \nRP  implementation  and  management  amount  to  Tk210  million  (approximately  $3.6  million \nequivalent).  This  is  an  indicative  budget,  which  includes  compensation  for  compensation, \nincome  rehabilitation  and  assistance  to  vulnerable  groups,  and  support  for  project \nimplementation. The revised RP, based on a detailed census, will prepare a detailed annual \nbudget specifying timing for the release of funds and will meet resettlement costs in full. \n \nJ.  Implementation Schedule \n \n12.  Construction activities will not start until the required lands have been acquired and the \npopulations appropriately relocated in accordance with the objective. All resettlement activities \nwill be coordinated with the civil works and will be completed satisfactorily before awarding the \ncivil works contracts for the pipeline.  At this point in time, it is anticipated that the construction \nworks  will  start  early  in  2004.  Therefore,  the  land  acquisition  activity  is  expected  to  be \ncompleted by the end of 2003. \n \n \n ", "      Appendix 16  61  \nSUMMARY ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS \n \nA.    Introduction \n \n1.  The proposed Road Network Improvement and Maintenance Project is categorized as a \nB project in the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Environmental Assessment Requirements. \nAn  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was  prepared.  This  appendix  is  based  on  the \ninformation in the IEE and the summary IEE reports that were undertaken under the project \npreparatory technical assistance.1 \n \nB.  Description of the Project \n \n2.  The proposed Project will involve reconstructing existing roads to higher standards by \nwidening, adjusting the alignment, and other improvements (e.g., lane marking, cross walk, \nsigns and safety features). The six project roads are located in the northern central and north \nwestern part of Bangladesh. The summary of the project description for the six project roads is \nin Table A16. \n \nTable A16:  Summary of the Project Description \nDivision  From  To  Total Length  Proposed Action Under the \n(km)  Project a \nRangpur  Saidpur  Parbatipur  15  Widening from 7.5 to 10.4 meters \n(m) \nRangpur  Mithapukur  Madhyapara  24  Widening from 8.5 to 10.4 m \nThakurgaon  Thakurgaon  Ranisankail  37  Widening from 7.1 to 8.6 m \nMymensingh/  Mymensingh  Nandail  47  Widening from 9.1 to 12.2 m \n     Kishoreganj \nMymensingh  Muktagacha  Chechua  10  Widening from 7.9 to 11.4 m \nJamalpur  Jamalpur  Dewanganj  41  Widening from 6.2 to 8.6 m \n     a  All project roads involve increasing embankment height, improving drainage structures, and planting trees on              \nthe roadsides \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n \n3.  The six projects are administratively located within Rangpur and Thakurgaon districts of \nRangpur  Division;  and  Jamalpur,  Kishoreganj,  and  Mymensingh  districts  of  Mymensingh \nDivision. The environmental condition of the project area is summarized as follows: \n   \n(i)  Saidpur-Parbatipur road. This project road is in Rangpur District. The area \nis topographically flat. The soil is predominantly floodplain soil. The Tista \nRiver  skirts  the  northeast  boundary  of  Rangpur  District  in  northwest-\nsoutheast direction. The district is subject to periodic rainwater flood and \nabove average floods. The road passes mainly agricultural land. This area is \nnot rich in flora or fauna. Homestead trees are scattered on both sides of the \nroad along 15 kilometers (km). About 2,850 trees are located 15 meters (m) \nfrom the centerline of the road. No wildlife is found in the project area. \n \n(ii)  Mithapukur-Madhyapara road. This project road, also located in Rangpur \nDistrict, has a flat area. The soil is dominantly sandy and clay loams.

Teachnical Assistance to Bangladesh for the Road Network Improvement and Maintenance Project. \nManila. \n \n ", "62   Appendix 16 \narea  is  also  subject  of  rainwater  floods.  The  road  crosses  the \nJamuneshawari, Akhiri, Katgori and Girnai rivers and low-lying agricultural \nfields. Homestead trees are found along the 24 km road. However, only about \n950 trees are within 15 m from the centerline. The last 0.5 km of the road \ncrosses a forest area.  \n \n(iii)  Thakurgaon-Ranisankail road. This project road in Thakurgaon District has \na flat area. The soil is predominantly non-calcareous. The road crosses two \nrivers (Tangon and Vakti) and there are some small streams in the area. The \n37  km  road  crosses  mainly  agricultural  fields.  A  considerable  number  of \nhomestead trees are along the road. About 5,060 trees are within 15 m from \nthe centerline of the road. \n \n(iv)  Mymensingh-Nandail  road.  This  road  is  located  in  Kishoreganj  and \nMymensingh  districts.  The  project  area  is  flat.  Both  Kishoreganj  and \nMymensingh  lands  are  classified  as  lowland  part  of  the  Meghna  River \nfloodplain. The project area is not flood-prone, but sometimes experiences \nmoderate  flooding  due  to  high  intensity  of  rainfall.  The  road  crosses \nagricultural lands, ponds, and homestead trees. About 8,500 trees are within \n15 m from the centerline of the road. During the flood season, a wide variety \nof birds and aquatic fauna are found in the project area. Fish production is \nalso high. \n \n(v)  Muktagacha-Chechua road. This project road is Mymensingh District. The  \narea is flat. The soil characteristic is predominantly old alluvium. The old \nBrahmapuna  River  dominates  the  hydrology  of  Mymensingh  District. \nHowever, the road area is flood free. Considerable numbers of homestead \nand roadside trees are on both sides of the road. About 1,690 different \nspecies of trees are found within 15 m from the centerline of the road. The \nfauna species are limited.   \n \n(vi)  Jamalpur-Dewanganj road. This project road is in Jamalpur District. The \narea is flat and is also classified as lowland. River erosion and flooding are \nsignificant concerns in this area. The road passes agricultural fields, and \nhomesteads are on the sides of the road. About 11,580 trees are within 15 m \nfrom the road centerline. Wildlife such as dolphins, snakes, and aquatic birds \nare often found during floods.   \n \nD.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n4.  The six roads will have no significant environmental impact because the Project will be \nexecuted only on the existing roads, none of which are in environmentally sensitive areas. The \nenvironmental impacts associated with the construction stage will include (i) disruption of traffic \nin the construction area; (ii) increased air pollution due to increasing dust and other volatile \nchemical substance from asphalt plants; (iii) noise and vibration; (iv) disruption of the water \nsystem due to cut-and-fill and other earthworks; and (v) potential landslides associated with \nelevating some part of the road. All these impacts will occur only during the construction period. \nMitigation measures will be adopted to minimize the impacts: (i) reroute the traffic with clear \nsigns; (ii) maintain optimum moisture content during handling of soil, spray water to minimize \ndust, and maintain a safe distance between the asphalt plant and public facilities including \neducation facilities; (iii) strictly control the construction works that create noise and vibration by ", "      Appendix 16  63  \nprohibiting night work in the residential areas; (iv) provide for pumping of stagnant water and an \nadequate drainage system; and (v) stabilize road embankment side slopes,  restrict construction \nin flood areas to only the dry season, and avoid road widening at pond sites. All these mitigation \nrequirements will be included in the contract documents for the contractor. Clearly, all the \nimpacts  are  temporary  and  manageable.  The  environmental  impact  associated  with  the \noperation of the Project is mainly on traffic safety; therefore, adequate traffic signs and physical \nbarriers to reduce motorist speed will be installed. The other important environmental impact \nthat will not concentrate in the road areas is borrow pits excavation. In this context, strictly \nborrow pits operation will be adopted (e.g. restrict borrow pits in the fertile agriculture lands and \nareas prone to erosion and landslide, restore and rehabilitate  former borrow pit areas). \n \nE.  Institutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program \n \n5.  Institutional Framework and Responsibility. The contractor will be responsible for \nimplementing mitigation measures during the construction stage. An environmental engineer, \nwho will be hired as part of the consulting team for implementing the Project, will assist the \nSocial and Environmental Circle (SEC) of RHD in preparing contractual documentation so that \nthe bidding documents, bills of quantity, and other contractual obligations of the contractor \nclearly identify environmental responsibilities and describe penalties for noncompliance. RHD \nand  its  SEC  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  overall  environmental  monitoring  and \nmanagement. \n \n6.  Environmental Monitoring and Management Plan. The IEE has identified the generic \nmonitoring and management program, that will be part of the mitigation of adverse impacts.  \nDetailed  monitoring  and  management  for  each  road  will  be  prepared  during  the  detailed \nengineering work being carried out under an ongoing project. \n  \nF.  Findings and Recommendations \n \n7.  The IEE shows that environmental impacts associated with the proposed Project are \nmanageable and can be mitigated. In addition, the Project will not disturb any environmentally \nsensitive  areas.  Therefore,  a  full  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  is  not  required. \nHowever, one of the project roads, Mymensingh-Nandail road, falls under the red category  \naccording to Bangladesh\u2019s Environmental Preservation Rules 1997. Civil works for this project \nroad  can  be  started  only  after  the  Department  of  Environment  issues  an  environmental \nclearance based on a full EIA. Conducting the full EIA requires detailed information about \nengineering design. In view of this, the EIA for the Mymensingh-Nandail road will be prepared \nas part of detailed engineering design.       \n \nG.  Conclusion \n \n8.  The Project will improve roads that are currently in place. The overall IEE finding is that \nthe Project will not cause any significant environmental problem and any potential adverse \nimpacts are manageable.  However, continued monitoring will be carried out. "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20020919165256Z", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 4.0 for Windows", "ModDate": "D:20021012124122+08'00'"}}
