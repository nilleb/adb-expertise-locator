The Project will also improve \nperiodic  and \nroad  maintenance  by  securing \nappropriate  Government  budget  for  maintenance  and  by \npromoting private sector participation in road maintenance.  \n\nroutine \n\nfocusing \n\nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  assisted  with  road \nsector  development \nlargely  on \nin  Bangladesh, \ncompletion  of  five  strategic  road  transport  corridors.  Other \nmajor  financiers,  including  the  World  Bank  and  bilateral \nsources,  have  also \nfocused  on  strengthening  strategic \ncorridors.  These  coordinated  efforts  contributed  considerably \nto  meeting  the  growing  demand  for  roads  by  linking  strategic \nareas  in  Bangladesh  through  strategic  corridors.  With  the \ncompletion of key strategic road connections, more emphasis \nshould  now  be  given  to  development  of  an  integrated  road \nnetwork  to  link  the  rural  poor  to  economic  opportunities. \nCompared  with  national  and  regional  roads,  type  A  feeder \nroads,  which  are  mostly  used  by  rural  farmers  to  access \nmarkets or social facilities, have only 60-65 percent pavement \nratio.  Because  of  the  poor  condition  of  feeder  roads,    rural \nfarmers\u2019  connection  to  national  roads  is  constrained,  and \nconsequently  their  access  to  markets  or  education  or  health \nfacilities,  which  are  located  in  commercial  centers  connected \nby national roads, is limited. There is need for complementary \nimprovement  of  national,  regional,  and  feeder  roads  to \ndevelop  an  integrated  road  network  to  link  the  rural  poor  to \neconomic opportunities.  \n\nThe  Project  will  help \nthe  Government  achieve  poverty \nreduction  through  economic  growth  by  improving  transport \nefficiency  and  strengthening  integrated  road  networks  that \neffectively  link  national,  regional,  and  feeder  roads.  The \nProject  will  (i)  improve  subnational  roads  to  provide  rural \nfarmers  with  better  access  to  markets,  social  services,  and \nemployment  opportunities;  (ii)  secure  Government  resources \n\n\fiv \n\n \n \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\n \n \nLoan Amount and Terms \n\n \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project  \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\n \n\nfor  periodic  road  maintenance;  (iii)  promote  private  sector \nparticipation  in  road  maintenance;  and  (iv)  improve  road \nsafety.    \n\nthrough  performance-based  contracts; \n\nThe  Project  will  (i)  reconstruct  47  kilometers  (km)  of  regional \nroads and 127 km of type A feeder roads; (ii) support periodic \nmaintenance  of  400  km  of  roads;  (iii)  support  routine  road \nmaintenance \n(iv) \nimprove  black  spots  and  conduct  education  and  public \ncampaigns for road safety; and (v) provide consulting services \nfor  project  management,  construction  supervision,  preparing \nand  supervising  performance-based \nroad  maintenance \ncontracts;  and  conduct  a  feasibility  study  for  privatizing  the \nRoads  and  Highways  Department\u2019s  (RHD\u2019s)  maintenance \nequipment  and  workshops,  road  safety  improvement,  and \ndetailed  designing \nImprovement \nMaintenance Project II. \n\nfor  Road  Network \n\nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $122.9  million \nequivalent  comprising  foreign  exchange  of  $49.4  million  and \nlocal currency of $73.5 million equivalent.  \n\nSource \n\nADB-ADF  \nGovernment \nOPEC Fund \nTotal \n \n\nForeign \nExchange\n43.7 \n0.0 \n5.7 \n49.4 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n21.3 \n47.9 \n4.3 \n73.5 \n\nTotal \nCost \n65.0 \n47.9 \n10.0 \n122.9 \n\n52.9 \n39.0 \n8.1 \n100.0 \n\n      ($ million) \n\nPercent \n\n      ADB = Asian Development Bank, ADF = Asian Development Fund, OPEC = \n\nOrganization of Petroleum-Exporting Countries. \n\n \nThe proposed ADB loan from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources \nis  equivalent  in  various  currencies  to  SDR  48,964,000  [$65.0 \nmillion].

An  international  consulting  firm  will  undertake \nsupervision  in  association  with  domestic  consultants.  In \naddition to contract supervision, the consultants will (i) design \nperformance-based \nimplement \nsupervision maintenance; (ii) assess safety for existing roads, \ndevelop  a  black  spot  improvement  plan,  and  procure  and \nsupervise  civil  works;  and  (iii)  make  a  feasibility  study  for \nprivatizing  of  RHD\u2019s  maintenance  equipment  and  workshops. \nConsulting  services  will  also  be  required  for  preparing  a \ndetailed  design  for  the  proposed  Road  Network  Improvement \nand  Maintenance  Project  II.

Indirect  benefits \nare those arising from the secondary effects of the reduction in \nVOCs  and  time  costs,  which  lead  to  increased  economic \nactivities.  These  benefits  have  been  estimated  in  the  form  of \ngenerated passenger and cargo traffic.   \n\ninclude  greater \n\ncomfort \n\nin \n\nThe  beneficiaries  are  the  various  categories  of  road  users:  \nowners/operators  of  buses  and  trucks,  passengers,  cargo \nowners, and the population in the area of influence in general.  \nBenefits  in  the  form  of  lower  VOCs  enjoyed  by  vehicle \nowners/operators are expected to be distributed widely among \n\n\fvi \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\n \n\nthe  various  stakeholders,  as  the  conditions  in  the  transport \nindustry are competitive. \n\nAnalysis  of  the  project  effects  on  road  users,  construction \nworkers,  the  Government,  and  lenders  shows  the  distribution \nof benefits among road users and incorporates the negative or \npositive  effects  on  (i)  the  Government  and  the  economy  in \ngeneral  (a  negative  effect)  by  way  of  the  subsidy  the \ngovernment  provides  to  road  users  by  funding  part  of  the \nconstruction  cost  and  the  loss  of  tax  revenue  it  incurs  as  a \nresult  of  savings  in  VOCs;  (ii)  lenders  who  also  provide  a \nsubsidy  to  road  users  as  a  result  of  the  concessional  loan \nterms;  and  (iii)  construction  workers  who  gain  because  the \nsalaries  earned  are  higher  than  the  opportunity  cost  of  their \nlabor.    When  gains  and  losses  of  all  parties  are  netted,  the \nanalysis reveals that Tk3.74 billion of the total gains of Tk7.02 \nbillion  accrues  to  the  poor,  with  the  poverty  impact  ratio  of \n0.53. \n\nThe  main  risk  in  the  road  improvement  component  is  the \nnonsustainable  benefit  streams  from  the  investment  due  to \ninadequate  maintenance  and  truck  overloading.  This  risks \nfactor will be addressed by incorporating a project component \nthat  will  secure  a  Government  budget  for  road  maintenance \nand undertaking policy dialogue to improve axle-load control.   \n\nThe  notable  project  risk  concerns  contracting  out  of  routine \nroad maintenance based on the performance-based contract. \nLocal  private  contractors  may  be  unfamiliar  with  the  new \nperformance-based  maintenance  contract.  The  contract  may \nbe poorly designed and thus fail to provide the right incentives \nor penalties to the contractors. This risk will be addressed by \nproviding  consulting  services  for  designing  the  performance-\nbased  contract  and  monitoring \nthe \ncontractors.  \n\nthe  performance  of \n\n\f \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nloan  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  Road  Network  Improvement  and \nMaintenance Project; and (ii) proposed administration of a loan for the Project to be provided by \nthe OPEC Fund for International Development (OPEC Fund). \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe  transport  system  in  Bangladesh  is  extensive  and  diversified,  comprising  about \n140,000  kilometers  (km)  of  roads,  2,700  km  of  railroads,  5,970  km  of  perennial  and  seasonal \nwaterways,  two  major  seaports,  and  seven  airports.  The  primary  road  network  connecting \nnational  and  regional  roads  and  type  A  feeder  roads  comprises  20,800  km,1  while  the \nsecondary roads including rural and type B feeder roads total 115,000 km. National and regional \nroads and type A feeder roads are administered by the Roads and Highways Department (RHD) \nwithin the Ministry of Communication (MOC). Rural and type B feeder roads are administered by \nthe Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) within the Local Government Division. \n \n The  performance  of  the  road  sector  has  consistently  improved  in  the  past  decades \n3. \naided by extension of the road network and a rapid increase in demand for road transport. The \ndemand increased at an average annual rate of 8.4% for passengers and 8.2% for freight during \nthe  1990s,  increases  that  were  almost  double  the  average  gross  domestic  product  (GDP) \ngrowth of 4.7% for the same period. The modal share of transport has gradually shifted in favor \nof roads. Between 1975 and 1997, the modal share of road transport rose from 54% to 73% for \npassenger traffic, and from 35% to 63% for freight. The road has become the principal mode of \ntransport in Bangladesh.  \n \n4. \nThe condition of roads, as well as the capacity and reach of the road network, has also \nsubstantially improved. Over the past 5 years, the primary roads classified as good or fair have \nincreased from 73% to 96%. \n \n5. \nThe sustainability of these achievements could, however, be jeopardized by insufficient \nresources  allocated  to  road  maintenance.  Over  the  last  5  years,  the  allocation  for  routine  and \nperiodic  road  maintenance  per  kilometer  of  RHD  roads  decreased  by  3%  per  annum.  The \nHighway  Design  and  Maintenance  Standards  Model  (HDM)  estimates  that  the  long-term \nspending on preserving the road network should be Tk5 billion ($85.5 million) per annum. The \nactual  spending  is,  however,  no  more  than  Tk3.1  billion  ($53  million),  about  62%  of  the \nrequirement.  Furthermore,  the  accumulated  backlog  of  deferred  maintenance,  estimated  at \nTk24 billion ($410 million), will require an additional Tk2.5 billion ($42.7 million) per annum for \nthe next 10 years. \n \n6. \nRecognizing  this  problem,  RHD  is  shifting  its  focus  from  road  development  to  road \nmaintenance.  Under  the  institutional  development  components  funded  by  the  Department  for \nInternational Development of the United Kingdom and included in the World Bank\u2019s Second and \nThird  Road  Rehabilitation  and  Maintenance  Projects,  RHD  developed  an  annual  road \nmaintenance  plan  (ARMP).  The  first  ARMP  covered  1999-2000.  The  ARMP  uses  the  HDM  to \n\n                                                           \n1 The primary road network comprises 3,086 km of national roads, 1,751 km of regional roads, and 15,962 km of type \n\nA feeder roads. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\ndetermine  which  roads  should  be  maintained  for  the  year  in  question  and  what  the  level  of \nmaintenance should be.  \n \n7. \nApart from strengthening institutional focus on road maintenance, there is also a need to \nestablish additional sources of road maintenance financing so that the ARMP can eventually be \nfinanced  from  domestic  sources  on  a  sustainable  basis.  A  loan  covenant  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  previous  project2  required  that  by  2003,  the  Government  would \nhave  carried  out  a  national  review  of  mechanisms  for  funding  the  requirements  of  the  ARMP \nfrom domestic sources, including the option of establishing a road maintenance fund; and that \nby  2005,  it  would  implement  a  time-bound  action  plan  for  meeting  the  annual  costs  of \nmaintaining all roads under RHD\u2019s jurisdiction. The national review is supported jointly by ADB, \nthe World Bank, Department for International Development (DFID) of the United Kingdom, and \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), building on previous work by the World Bank \nto examine the requirements for introducing a road maintenance fund. DFID provided consulting \nservices for these activities.  \n \nRoad  transport  operations  are  largely  in  the  hands  of  the  private  sector,  with  the  sole \n8. \npublic  sector  Bangladesh  Road  Transport  Corporation  (BRTC)  controlling  about  2%  of \npassenger operations and 1% of the freight market. BRTC has introduced the first compressed \nnatural gas (CNG)-powered bus in its fleet on a pilot basis. It expects to increase CNG use as \nthe option provides for about 50% savings in fuel costs and significant environmental benefits in \nreducing  air  pollution.  Under  the  Road  Overlay  and  Improvement  Project,3  ADB  provided \ntechnical advice and financing for five vehicle inspection centers (located in Dhaka, Chittagong, \nRajshahi, and Khulna) that will be responsible for issuing fitness and nonpollution certificates.4 \nUnder the Southwest Road Network Development Project,5 ADB provided technical assistance \n(TA) to formulate a strategy to improve air quality in Dhaka and other major cities, particularly in \nrelation  to  vehicular  emission.  The  study  identified  opportunities  to  introduce  technological \nchanges  to  the  use  of  CNG  in  trucks  and  buses.6  These  efforts  have  begun  to  produce  the \nvisible output of BRTC\u2019s introducing CNG-powered buses.     \n \n9. \nIn  the  case  of  freight  operation,  almost  90%  of  the  private  trucking  fleet  is  owned  by \nindividuals,  and  the  industry  is  highly  competitive.  Greater  efficiency  in  operations  would  be \nachieved by having larger fleets, and depots and maintenance workshops so that the operators \ncould function as regular transport companies.  \n\n                                                           \n2   ADB.  2000.

Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Road Overlay and Improvement Project. Manila. \n\n4  Five vehicle inspection centers were built and sophisticated equipment installed. The equipment, however, has not \nbeen fully utilized because of lack of expertise in the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA). Recognizing \nthis problem, the Southwest Road Network Development Project required, as one of its loan covenants, BRTA to \nlease  to  the  private  sector  the  operation  and  management  of  vehicle  inspection  centers  by  June  2001.  This \nrequirement  has  not  been  complied  with  because  of  poor  institutional  capacity  and  lack  of  the  right  expertise  in \nBRTA.  The  project  completion  report,  prepared  in  August  2002,  recommended  ADB\u2019s  further  assistance  for \nstrengthening  BRTA\u2019s  capacity  as  a  way  of  normalizing  and  ultimately  privatizing  the  operation  of  vehicle \ninspection  centers.  BRTA  will  submit  a  time-bound  action  plan  to  privatize  the  operation  of  vehicle  inspection \ncenters, together with an assessment of their capacity, and identified the areas for ADB assistance to implement \nthe  action  plan.  ADB  will  consider  further  assistance  as  part  of  Road  Network  Improvement  and  Maintenance \nProject II programmed for 2003. \n\n5    ADB.  1999.

Manila. \n\n6  The Dhaka Clean Fuel Project programmed for 2002 with $72 million will complement the effort to introduce CNG-\n\npowered vehicles by improving the availability of and access to CNG.   \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nRoad  safety  is  a  continuing  major  issue  as  the  fatality  rate  on  the  country\u2019s  roads \n10. \nnetwork  remains  the  highest  in  South  Asia.  The  number  of  persons  reported  killed  increased \nfrom  955  in  1983  to  3,162  in  1997,  corresponding  to  an  annual  fatality  rate  of  73  per  10,000 \nmotor  vehicles.  The  current  rate  is  more  than  double  that  in  other  South  Asian  countries,  and \nseveral times higher than that in Europe. The causes of the significantly increased accident rate \nare  mainly  overspeeding,  overloading,  and  overtaking  by  motor  vehicles.  Unregulated \nmovement  of  nonmotorized  vehicles  along  with  motorized  vehicles  on  the  same  route  is  also \none major cause of road accidents and traffic congestion.  \n \nRecent research carried out by ADB7 and the World Bank has established that drivers\u2019 \n11. \nignorance  of  traffic  regulations  and  inefficient  enforcement  are  the  major  causes  of  road \naccidents,  followed  by  poor  road  and  vehicle  conditions  and  overloading.  Under  the  Jamuna \nBridge Access Roads Project,8 ADB financed a weighbridge to monitor axle load and provided \nconsulting services to (i) identify accident-prone locations, or black spots; (ii) recommend safety \nmeasures  in  road  design;  (iii)  supervise  construction  of  civil  works  for  low-cost  accident \nprevention  measures;  (iv)  conduct  training  in  road  safety  enforcement  and  education;  and  (v) \nmonitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the various accident-prevention measures. \n \n12. \nUnder the Southwest Road Network Development Project (footnote 5), RHD established \nan  independent  Road  Design  and  Safety  Circle  (RDSC),  which  monitors  road  safety  aspects \nthroughout RHD and prepares manuals for road safety and road design. RDSC also introduced \na road safety audit program for RHD roads, and prepared a road safety manual that provides for \nan institutionalized systematic method of checking the safety aspects of new and existing roads \nto  identify  hazards.  The  project  also  provided  consulting  services,  partly  financed  by  Nordic \nDevelopment  Fund  (NDF),  to  assist  the  National  Road  Safety  Council  (NRSC)  in  setting  up \ndistrict  and  municipal  committees  and  funding  the  initial  public  campaigns,  bus  driver  training \nprograms,  truck  driver  training,  and  overloading  awareness  campaigns,  and  in  involving \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs) in road safety programs.  \n \nB. \n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nRoad Improvement \n\n \n13. \nThe  Partnership  Agreement  on  Poverty  Reduction  concluded  in  April  2000  identified \nroads as one of the leading agents for poverty reduction. In line with the agreement, the road \nsubsector strategy in Bangladesh focuses on (i) accelerating pro-poor economic growth, e.g., by \nproviding farmers with access to markets and inputs; (ii) reducing the obstacles to social service \ndelivery  and  providing  access  to  vulnerable  groups;  (iii)  facilitating  popular  participation  by \nfacilitating  travel;  and  (iv)  conducting  road  sector  operations  with  greater  public  scrutiny  and \nintroducing  more  objective  and  transparent  approaches  to  resource  allocation,  especially  for \nroad maintenance.   \n \n14. \nSince  1977,  ADB  has  provided  12  loans  totaling  $931  million  to  the  road  sector  in \nBangladesh, focusing largely on the completion of five strategic road transport corridors. Other \nmajor financiers, including the World Bank and bilaterals, have invested $1.8 billion in the road \nsector, also focusing on strengthening the strategic corridors. External assistance to the roads \nsector from aid agencies are in Appendix 2. These coordinated efforts contributed considerably \n\n                                                           \n7  ADB. 1995 and 1997. Regional Initiatives in Road Safety. Manila. \n8  ADB. 1996.

Manila. \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nto  meeting  the  growing  demand  for  roads  by  linking  strategic  areas  in  Bangladesh  through \nstrategic corridors. About 96% of national and regional roads are paved.   \n \n15.  With  the  completion  of  key  strategic  road  connections,  more  emphasis  should  now  be \ngiven to developing an integrated road network to link the rural poor to economic opportunities. \nCompared with national and regional roads, type A feeder road, which is mostly used by rural \nfarmers to access markets or social facilities, has only 60-65% pavement ratio. Because of this \npoor condition of feeder roads, the connection of rural farmers to national roads is constrained; \nconsequently,  their  access  to  markets  or  education  or  health  facilities,  which  are  located  in \ncommercial centers connected by national roads, is limited. The Project is designed to focus on \nimprovement of regional and feeder roads to strengthen integrated road networks, especially in \nthe northwest and the central north regions in Bangladesh where the level of poverty incidence \nis  known  to  be  highest.9  The  project  areas  also  have  significant  potential  development  impact \nfor not only nationwide but also subregional economic development in the medium term.10 \n \nThe districts of the project areas measure about 35,000 km2 accommodating more than \n16. \n31  million  people  and  about  4,500  km  of  national,  regional,  and  type  A  feeder  roads.  Type  A \nfeeder  roads  comprise  more  than  76%  of  the  total  length  of  roads.  Industrial  activities  in  the \nproject  areas  are  low  compared  with  those  in  other  regions  of  the  country,  particularly  Dhaka, \nChittagong,  Jessore,  and  Khulna.  Each  project  district  has  an  industrial  estate  of  Bangladesh \nSmall and Cottage Industries Corporation, where small and medium-size industrial enterprises \nare  set  up.  Total  employment  in  the  industrial  activities  in  the  project  district  was  estimated  at \n100,000  in  1996/1997.  Outside  the  estates,  small  and  cottage  industries  such  as  rice  milling, \ntimber processing, furniture making, food processing, and hand loom weaving are popular.  \n \n\n2. \n\nRoad Maintenance \n\n \n17.  While a mechanism for sustainable domestic financing for road maintenance is expected \nby  2005  (para.  7),  there  is  a  need  to  separately  address  the  present  shortfall  of  Government \nresources for periodic road maintenance and the increasing backlog of deferred maintenance. \nThe  World  Bank  provided  $70  million  for  periodic  maintenance  over  the  period  2000-2004 \nthrough  its  Road  Rehabilitation  and  Maintenance  Project  3.  ADB\u2019s  Road  Maintenance  and \nImprovement  Project  (footnote  2)  attempted  to  reduce  the  increasing  backlog  by  encouraging \nthe  Government  to  commit  more  of  its  annual  budget  to  periodic  road  maintenance.  ADB \nallocated $10.8 million for periodic road maintenance and required the Government to shoulder \n70%  of  the  cost  of  periodic  maintenance  while  the  Project  pays  30%.  This  arrangement  will \nenable  the  Government  to  source  $36  million  in  total  that  can  finance  300  km  of  periodic \nmaintenance for 3 years. The Project will extend this program by 2 years and finance 200 km of \nperiodic maintenance for 2 years with the same scheme of leveraging Government financing. \n \n\n3. \n\nPrivate Sector Development \n\n \n18. \nUnder the same ADB project (footnote 2), a policy and guidelines for private investment \nin highway projects are being prepared with the aim of enacting them by September 2004. The \npolicy  and  guidelines  are  concerned  with  establishing  a  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for \n                                                           \n9  Sen, Binayak. 2000. Bangladesh Poverty Analysis: Trends, Policies and Institutions. The poverty survey identified \nGaibandha, Kurigram, Lalmonirhat, Nilphamari, Panchagarh, Rangpur in the northwest, and Jamalpur and Sherpur \nin the center-north as the poorest districts in Bangladesh with higher than 50% poverty incidence. \n\n10 The northwest will be a major route of cross-border traffic from Nepal and Bhutan to Mongla and Chittagong port \nwhen regional economic cooperation becomes active through the South Asian Growth Quadrangle initiative. The \ncenter-north will be an important route connecting Sylhet in the northeast to the Jamuna Bridge in the future, which \nwill replace the current long route through Dhaka. \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\nprivate  sector  investment  in  highway  projects  including  build-operate-transfer  (BOT)-type  of \nroad  development  contracts.  This  legal  and  regulatory  framework  will  foster  an  enabling \nenvironment  for  private  sector  participation  in  developing  the  road  sector.  Until  such  a \nframework is put in place, efforts can be made to attempt a less sophisticated mode of private \nsector participation in the road sector.  \n \n19. \nTraditionally, road maintenance is contracted out based on a schedule of unit prices and \nestimates of quantities. The works to be performed are specified in the contract and payments \nare  based  on  executed  measured  works.  In  contrast,  a  performance-based  road  maintenance \ncontract defines the minimum road conditions that the contractor has to provide. Payments are \nbased  on  how  well  the  contractor  complies  with  the  performance  standards  defined  in  the \ncontract, not on the amount of works executed.11 The performance-based maintenance contract \ntransfers  the  risks  of  work  selection,  technology,  process,  design  or  management  to  the \ncontractors,  and  thereby  encourages  them  to  improve  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  their \nmaintenance  works  for  their  own  benefit.  This  efficiency  gain  will  be  translated  into  low-cost \nroad maintenance through competitive bidding. Without the legal and regulatory framework for \nprivate sector participation in place, performance-based road maintenance can be introduced as \na  way  of  improving  the  efficiency  of  road  maintenance  and  relieving  RHD  of  excessive \nworkloads for monitoring input quantities under the traditional maintenance contract. As private \nsector participation in road maintenance grows, and the participants\u2019 capacity improves, RHD\u2019s \nrole in road maintenance will be reduced. Then, RHD\u2019s maintenance equipment and workshops, \npresently  used  by  RHD  for  its  own  maintenance  work  and  rented  as  necessary  to  private \ncontractors who can\u2019t afford to keep such equipment and workshops, can be privatized. \n \n\n4. \n\nRoad Safety  \n\n \n20.  While RHD addresses road safety through engineering solutions such as a road safety \naudit, NRSC leads the national-level activities to improve road safety. The secretariat of NRSC \nwas established in the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA) in 1998 and was involved \nin  monitoring  the  implementation  of  the  national  road  safety  strategic  action  plan.  In  January \n2001,  the  BRTA  Road  Safety  Cell  was  formed  as  a  successor  to  the  NRSC  secretariat  under \nthe  World  Bank\u2019s  Road  Rehabilitation  and  Maintenance  Project  3.  The  Road  Safety  Cell \nprovides secretariat services to NRSC and coordinates all road safety activities as defined in the \nnational road safety action plan. \n \n21. \nIn November 2001, NRSC issued the National Road Safety Strategic Action Plan 2002-\n2004 which prescribes the direction for nationwide road safety activities for the next three years. \nIt identified problems, goals, and required actions for nine key road safety issues: (i) planning, \nmanagement,  and  coordination  of  road  safety  activities;  (ii)  establishing  an  accident  data \nsystem;  (iii)  preventing  road  accidents  through  more  safety-conscious  planning,  design, \nconstruction,  and  maintenance  of  roads;  (iv)  revising  traffic  legislation  promoting  road  user \ncompliance;  (v)  developing  a  more  effective  and  efficient  traffic  police;  (vi)  ensuring  minimum \nstandards  for  driver  competence  through  improved  driver  training  and  testing  procedures;  (vii) \nimproving  the  roadworthiness  of  vehicles;  (viii)  introducing  road  safety  education  and  publicity \nprograms;  and  (ix)  improving  the  emergency  assistance,  hospital  care,  and  rehabilitation \navailable  for  victims  of  road  traffic  accidents.  The  Road  Safety  Cell  has  developed  various \nactivities for implementing the action plan, and coordinates with aid agencies such as the World \nBank, DFID, and ADB in implementing them. \n \n                                                           \n11 Zietlow, J.

Performance Specified Road Maintenance Contracts-The Road to the \n\nFuture.  \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nObjectives \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  objective  is  to  help  the  Government  achieve  poverty  reduction  through  economic \n22. \ngrowth by improving transport efficiency and strengthening integrated road networks effectively \nlinking  national,  regional,  and  feeder  roads.  The  Project  will  (i)  improve  subnational  roads  to \nprovide  rural  farmers  with  better  access  to  markets,  social  services,  and  employment \nopportunities;  (ii)  secure  Government  resources  for  periodic  road  maintenance;  (iii)  promote \nprivate sector participation in road maintenance; and (iv) improve road safety.   \n \nB. \n \n23. \nThe  Project  will  (i)  reconstruct  47  km  of  regional  roads  and  127  km  of  type  A  feeder \nroads;  (ii)  support  periodic  road  maintenance  of  400  km  of  roads;  (iii)  support  routine  road \nmaintenance through performance-based contracts; (iv) improve accident-prone areas or black \nspots and undertake education and public campaigns for road safety; and (v) provide consulting \nservices  for  project  management,  construction  supervision,  preparing  and  supervising  a \nperformance-based  road  maintenance  contract,  conducting  a  feasibility  study  for  privatizing \nRHD\u2019s  maintenance  equipment  and  workshops,  road  safety  improvement,  and  detailed \ndesigning for Road Network Improvement Maintenance Project II. \n \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n1. \n\nRoads Improvement Component \n\n \nThe Project will reconstruct a 47 km regional road in Mymensingh-Nandail and five type \n24. \nA  feeder  roads  in  (i)  Muktagacha-Chechua,  10.0  km;  (ii)  Jamalpur-Dewanganj,  41.0  km;  (iii) \nMithapukur-Madhyapara,  24.0  km;  (iv)  Thakurgaon-Ranisankail,  37.0  km;  and  (v)  Saidpur-\nParbatipur,  15.0  km.  A  summary  for  the  design  approach  and  technical  standards  for \nreconstruction is attached as Appendix 3.  \n \n25. \nThe  feasibility  study  for  the  Project  assessed  27  roads  selected  from  the  northwest \nregion  covering  Dinajpur,  Gaibandha,  Kurigram,  Lalmonirhat,  Nilphamari,  Panchagarh, \nRangpur,  and  Thakurgaon;  and  the  central  north  region  covering  Jamalpur,  Kishoreganj, \nMymensingh,  Netrokona,  and  Sherpur.  The  27  candidate  roads  were  identified  by  a  set  of \nselection  criteria12  established \nthrough  extensive  consultative  meetings  with  various \nstakeholders including Government officials, road engineers, NGOs, transport operators, public \nrepresentatives,  and  common  road  users  in  the  project  areas.  Of  the  27  candidate  roads,  17  \nwere identified as technically and economically viable.  \n \n26. \nOf the 17 roads, 6 were selected as the project roads based on their economic rate of \nreturn  as  main  criterion,  and  some  other  aspects  such  as  likely  poverty  impact,  adverse \nenvironmental  impact,  or  social  and  resettlement  implications.  The  six  project  roads  entail  the \nrepair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction of nine bridges. \n\n \n\n                                                           \n12 The criteria included (i) social aspects such as population density, roof material of houses, and literacy level; (ii) \neconomic  aspects  such  as  unemployment  level,  nonagricultural  employment,  and  nonfarm  income  sources;  (iii) \nroad  condition  and  traffic  such  as  road  roughness  level,  general  road  conditions,  traffic  level,  and  nonmotorized \nvehicles; (iv) level of completion of road network loop; and (v) stakeholders\u2019 recommendation. \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\n2. \n\nPeriodic Road Maintenance Component \n\n \n27. \nThe  periodic  road  maintenance  component  will  finance  a  two-year  time  slice  of  priority \nroad  maintenance  activities  under  the  ARMP.  For  each  of  the  two  years,  this  component  will \ncover  periodic  maintenance  of  an  estimated  200  km,  to  be  carried  out  through  civil  works \ncontracts  worth  $8  million  equivalent.  The  roads  to  be  maintained  will  be  selected  annually \nusing the HDM ranking as part of the ARMP. Support will be restricted to periodic maintenance \nworks  and  will  comprise  mainly  sealing  and  overlay.  Road  widening  and  improvement  are \nexcluded  except  in  specific  locations  approved  by  ADB  such  as  market  places  and  bus  bays. \nThe support will target the districts selected as project areas (para. 25). The criteria for selecting \nroad  maintenance  subprojects  are  in  Appendix  4.  Consulting  services  will  be  provided  to \nsupervise the civil works under the ADB-assisted time slice.   \n \n28. \nSince  this  component  is  included  to  encourage  the  Government  to  commit  more  of  its \nannual  budget  to  periodic  road  maintenance,  the  costs  to  be  met  under  the  ADB  loan  will  be \nlower  than  those  to  be  met  through  Government  counterpart  funding.  This  element  will \ncontribute  significantly  to  securing  Government  resources  for  periodic  road  maintenance  and \naddressing the critical backlog of periodic maintenance. \n \n\n3. \n\nRoutine Road Maintenance Component \n\n \n29. \nRoutine and recurrent maintenance for about 50 km of regional or type A feeder roads \nwill  be  contracted  out  to  domestic  contractors  based  on  a  performance-based  contract  for  the \nperiod of 3-5 years. The roads for routine maintenance will be selected from regional or type A \nfeeder roads in the project areas, the periodic maintenance of which has been completed within \na year at the time of selection.  \n \n30. \nThe  performance-based  contract  consists  of  three  major  maintenance  components: \npreventive  work,  catch-up  routine  work,  and  performance  (routine  and  recurrent)  work. \nPreventive maintenance is designed to improve the road\u2019s structural condition. Catch-up routine \nmaintenance is designed to reduce the present maintenance backlog, particularly for shoulders \nand  drainage.  It  may  include  some  minor  improvements  such  as  drainage  structures,  slope \nprotection,  guardrails,  road  signs,  and  markings.  After  preventive  and  catch-up  routine \nmaintenance  are  completed,  performance-based  maintenance  will  begin.  The  preventive  and \ncatch-up routine maintenance works will be executed and paid for based on the quantity of work \ncompleted. Performance-based maintenance, however, will be executed according to minimum \nstandards set in the contract. If contractors fail to maintain the standards, the monthly lump sum \npayment  will  be  reduced  according  to  the  penalties  for  noncompliance  delineated  in  the \ncontract. The concept of performance-based maintenance and its implementation are outlined in \nAppendix 5. \n \n31. \nConsulting services will be provided to develop the contract scheme, train RHD officials \nand  local  contractors,  assist  with  contract  award,  and  supervise  the  works  in  the  first  year  of \nimplementation. During the remaining years of implementation, RHD will supervise and monitor \nthe  works.  During  the  first  year,  the  consultant  will  monitor  and  evaluate  implementation,  and \nprepare a final report giving the findings, lessons learned, and recommendations for replication.  \n \n\n4. \n\nRoad Safety Component \n\n \n32. \nThe  Project  will  undertake  civil  works  at  selected  accident-prone  areas  or  black  spots \nalong  the  project  roads  and  other  selected  roads.  For  the  purpose,  a  safety  audit  will  be \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nSpecial Features \n\nconducted  for  project  roads  along  with  detailed  designing  to  comply  with  safety  requirements. \nSafety will also be assessed for about 200 km of existing roads with the highest accident rate,  \nand the findings will be implemented by the Project. Road safety will be improved in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Road Safety Guidelines for the Asian and Pacific Region. \n   \n33. \nRoad designs will be improved by (i) improving delineation and edge marking on roads \nand  installing  reflecting  market  posts;  (ii)  installing  deviation  boards  in  critical  locations;  (iii) \nwidening  the  pavement  sections  of  main  roads  that  carry  high  volumes  of  pedestrians, \nrickshaws,  and  animal-driven  vehicles;  (iv)  providing  off-road  facilities  for  pedestrians  in \nsettlements,  including  facilities  for  buses  and  bus  passengers;  and  (v)  providing  adequate \nreflective  warning  signs,  setting  realistic  speed  limits,  and  building  speed  bumps  on  roads \nthrough settlements.  \n \n34. \nThe Project will assist the BRTA Road Safety Cell to implement its strategic action plan, \nparticularly for developing a more comprehensive highway code that will set out rules for road \nusers  and  provide  guidelines  for  safe  driving,  and  to  prepare  illustrated  guides  for  road  safety \neducation. \n \nC. \n \nNonmotorized traffic comprises a significant share of present-day traffic on most roads in \n35. \nBangladesh.  For  the  project  roads,  the  proportion  of  nonmotorized  to  motorized  traffic  ranges \nfrom  2.2  to  9.1.  Nonmotorized  traffic  comprises  slow-moving  traffic  such  as  bicycles,  cycle \nrickshaws, handcarts, and animal-drawn carts. Cycle rickshaws operating in villages, towns, and \ncities haved even become an icon of Bangladesh. They are widely used for passengers as well \nas for small size freight traffic in rural areas. Rickshaws are the most common mode of transport \namong  small  farmers  transporting  their  products  in  small  quantities  to  nearby  markets. \nEspecially  for  perishable  commodities  such  as  fruits,  vegetables,  milk,  and  dairy  products, \nrickshaws  are  taken  as  a  more  relevant  mode  of  transport  mainly  due  to  lack  of  storage  and \nother facilities required for those commodities. In 1998, it was estimated that 554,000 rickshaws \nwere operating in Bangladesh, almost the same size as the total motorized vehicles.  \n \nNonmotorized traffic uses the outer part of the carriageway as most roads rarely have a \n36. \nsufficient  width  of  hard  shoulder.  Thus,  nonmotorized  traffic  poses  a  significant  hindrance  to \nmotorized  traffic.  It  also  poses  a  significant  accident  risk,  in  particular  as  drivers  of  larger \nvehicles take little note of these slow-moving vehicles. An analysis of speed regression shows \nthat nonmotorized traffic reduces the achievable speed on a road more rapidly than motorized \ntraffic does, i.e., nonmotorized traffic takes 7 years to reduce the achievable speed to 20 km per \nhour,  while  the  same  number  of  motorized  traffic  takes  19  years.  It  proves  that  slow-moving \nnonmotorized traffic has a significant adverse impact on the speed of motorized traffic.  \n \n37. \nUnder the present economic situation and continued pressure on the labor market, it is \nnot  foreseeable  that  the  demand  for  and  use  of  nonmotorized  means  of  transport  will  be \nreduced  in  favor  of  motorized  traffic  in  the  near  future.  The  adverse  impact  of  nonmotorized \ntraffic  might  then  be  addressed  by  improving  road  design  in  such  a  way  as  to  accommodate \nsuch  traffic  while  maintaining  the  desired  speed.  The  feasibility  study  for  the  Project \nrecommended two options: (i) provide separate surfaced lanes for nonmotorized traffic; and (ii) \nprovide hard shoulders wider than the current standard. One of the project roads, Muktagacha-\nChechua, 26.0 km, will be designed adopting the latter option. It will have a 2.0-meter-wide hard \nshoulder  that  is  33%  wider  than  the  current  standard  of  1.5  meters.  If  this  option  proves \nsuccessful in accommodating nonmotorized traffic, it will be replicated in other road designs.   \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\nCost Estimates \n\nD. \n \n38. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $122.9  million  equivalent,  inclusive  of \nphysical  and  price  contingencies,  taxes  and  duties,  and  interest  charges  during  construction \n(Table 1). The foreign exchange cost is estimated at $49.4 million, representing about 40% of \ntotal cost. The local currency cost is estimated at $73.5 million equivalent, or about 60% of total \ncost. The local currency costs include $18.6 million equivalent for taxes and duties, and about \n$3.6 million equivalent for land acquisition and resettlement.  \n \n\nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\n \nItem \nA.

The ADF loan will be denominated in special drawing rights, and will have a term of \n32  years  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years  with  an  interest  rate  of  1%  per  year  during  the \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\ngrace period and 1.5% thereafter. The ADB loan will finance 88% of the foreign exchange cost \nof the Project and 29% of the local currency cost. Total ADB financing accounts for 53% of all \nproject  costs,  and  Government  financing  will  be  39%.  The  Borrower  will  be  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  Bangladesh.  The  Borrower  will  make  the  loan  available  to  the  Project\u2019s  Executing \nAgency  through  appropriate  budgetary  allocation.  The  project  financing  plan  is  presented  in \nTable 2.  The detailed financing plan is in Appendix 6. \n \n40. \nThe  Organization  of  Petroleum-Exporting  Countries  (OPEC)  Fund  will  provide  joint \ncofinancing  of  $10  million  equivalent  for  the  Project.  The  amount  will  be  used  to  finance  a \nportion  of  civil  works  construction  (contract  3,  Jamalpur-Dewanganj  road;  and  contract  4, \nSaidpur-Parbatipur  road).  ADB  will  administer  the  OPEC  Fund  loan  and  for  this  purpose  will \nenter into an agreement with the OPEC Fund. The loan will have a maturity of 20 years with an \ninterest rate of 1%, service charge of 1% per annum, and a grace period of 5 years. In the event \nthat  the  OPEC  Fund  loan  does  not  become  effective,  or  becomes  effective  in  an  amount  that \ncreates a shortfall in financing, the Government will meet the shortfall from its own resources. \n\n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \n\n \nSource \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\nTotal Cost \n\n \nPercent \n\nADB \nGovernment \nOPEC Fund \n \n\n52.9 \n \n39.0 \n \n \n8.1 \n  100.0 \n     ADB = Asian Development Bank, OPEC = Organization of Petroleum-Exporting Countries. \n\n65.0 \n \n47.9 \n \n \n10.0 \n  122.9   \n\n21.3 \n47.9 \n4.3 \n73.5 \n\n43.7 \n0.0 \n5.7 \n49.4 \n\nTotal \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n41. \nProviding  financing  for  local  currency  costs  is  considered  justified  under  ADB\u2019s  local \ncurrency  financing  policy.13  Because  a  low  level  of  per  capita  income  imposes  constraints  on \nnational  savings,  assistance  is  required  to  support  the  local  currency  costs  of  some \ndevelopment  projects.  The  domestic  savings  and  investment  rate  of  Bangladesh  is  one  of  the \nlowest  among  developing  member  countries  (DMCs).  Public  finances  remain  severely \nconstrained.  The  banking  system  also  faces  serious  financial  problems,  including  a  high \nproportion of nonperforming loans. The Government is taking steps to strengthen the financial \nsector  and  generate  increased  national  savings  by  introducing  financial  sector  reforms  and \nimproving budgetary revenue collection. Given all those factors, the current social and economic \ndevelopment circumstances warrant continued ADB financing of local costs. \n \nF. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n \n42. \nThe Executing Agency will be RHD within MOC, except for the road safety component \nfor  education  and  public  campaign.  RHD  has  substantial  experience  in  implementing  ADB-\nfinanced road projects. In accordance with the loan covenants for the ADB-financed Southwest \nRoad  Network  Development  Project  (footnote  5),  the  office  of  additional  chief  engineer  (ADB \nprojects)  RHD  implements  all  ADB  projects.  The  additional  chief  engineer  (ADB  projects)  is \ncurrently responsible for all ADB-assisted projects.  \n \n\n                                                           \n13  ADB. 1995. Review of Lending Foreign Exchange for Local Currency Expenditure on Projects.  Manila. \n\n\f \n\n11 \n\nRecognizing that the additional chief engineer is fully loaded with current ADB projects, \n43. \nRHD will appoint a separate full-time additional chief engineer as project director for the Project \nbefore  loan  negotiation.  The  project  director  will  report  to  the  chief  engineer  of  RHD  and  be \nsupported  by  two  executive  engineers  as  project  managers  responsible  for  day-to-day \nimplementation of the Project. The project director will also be responsible for implementing the \nland acquisition and resettlement plan. Details of the proposed project management for the road \nimprovement component are in Appendix 7.  \n \nThe  project  director  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  the  periodic  road  maintenance \n44. \ncomponent, \nthe  ARMP  using  HDM, \nprocurement,  monitoring  and  reporting,  and  acting  as  project  coordinator  for  the  performance-\nbased  maintenance  contract.  Administering  contracts  and  other  aspects  of  day-to-day \nimplementation  for  periodic  road  maintenance  and  routine  maintenance  by  the  performance-\nbased contract will be delegated to RHD\u2019s zonal offices, through the project director.  \n \n45. \nBRTA  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  road  safety  component  for  education  and \npublic campaign. The director technical in BRTA will be the project director, and will report to the \nchairman  of  BRTA,  and  be  supported  by  the  manager  of  BRTA  Road  Safety  Cell,  as  project \nmanager responsible for day-to-day implementation of the Project. \n \n\nincluding  overseeing  subproject  selection  under \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n46. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  4  years,  inclusive  of  preconstruction  activities. \nDetailed designing for the project roads will start in March 2003 and civil works should start by \nJuly 2004. The Government will not award any ADB-financed civil works construction contracts \nuntil after the construction supervision consultants have been appointed, and until the land and \nrights  to  land,  free  of  encumbrances,  required  for  the  execution  of  such  contracts  have  been \nacquired or made available. The Project is expected to be completed by 30 June 2007. Details \nof the implementation schedule are in Appendix 8. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \nCivil  works  for  the  road  improvement  component  will  be  procured  through  international \n47. \ncompetitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedures  among  prequalified  bidders  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  Procurement.  Contract  packages  for  the  road  improvement  components  are \nlisted in Appendix 9. Civil works for the periodic road maintenance component will be packaged \nin  contracts  with  an  estimated  value  of  $1.0  million-$3.0  million,  and  procured  in  accordance \nwith  local  competitive  bidding  (LCB)  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Local  contractors  have \nproved technically and financially qualified to carry out this size of periodic maintenance works, \nand  few  international  contractors  will  be  interested  because  of  the  logistical  difficulties  of \nmanaging maintenance works. For these contracts a separate prequalification exercise will not \nbe  necessary.  Instead,  bidders  will  be  required  to  submit  the  information  pertaining  to  their \nqualification  together  with  their  bids  following  single-stage,  two-envelope  bidding  procedures. \nCivil  works  for  the  periodic  maintenance  packages  with  an  estimated  value  of  more  than  $3.0 \nmillion  will  be  procured  through  ICB  procedures  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement.  \n \n48. \nCivil  works  for  the  routine  road  maintenance  with  performance-based  contract  will  be \nprocured  in  accordance  with  LCB  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB,  and  its  program  design  and \nimplementation  plan  that  will  be  developed  by  consultants.  Black  spot  improvement  for  the \nproject  roads  will  be  implemented  as  part  of  the  related  road  contract  packages.  For \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nimprovement of black spots on existing roads, local contractors will be selected in accordance \nwith LCB procedures acceptable to ADB.  \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n49. \nConsulting services will be required for supervising civil works for the road improvement \nand the periodic road maintenance components. An international consulting firm will undertake \nsupervision in association with domestic consultants. The ADB has approved the Government \nrequest  that  the  internationally  recruited  consultants  be  required  to  collaborate  with  domestic \nconsultants.  In  addition  to  contract  supervision,  the  consultants  will  (i)  undertake  program \ndesign  and  implementation  supervision  for  performance-based  road  maintenance;  (ii)  assess \nthe safety of existing roads, develop a black spot improvement plan, and procure and supervise \ncivil works; and (iii) conduct a feasibility study for privatizing of RHD\u2019s maintenance equipment \nand  workshops.  The  consultant  will  also  be  responsible  for  ensuring  community  participation, \nidentifying community needs, and monitoring gender and child labor issues. About 163 person-\nmonths of international and 745 person-months of domestic consulting services will be required. \nThe consultants will be selected and appointed by the quality-and-cost-based selection method \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and arrangements satisfactory \nto ADB for engaging domestic consultants. Outline terms of reference for these services are in \nAppendix 10. \n \n50. \nConsulting  services  (about  20  person-months  international  and  140  domestic)  will  be \nrequired  for  preparing  a  detailed  design  for  the  proposed  Road  Network  Improvement  and \nMaintenance Project II.  The consultants will be selected and appointed by the quality-and-cost-\nbased  selection  method  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. Outline terms of reference \nfor these services are in Appendix 11. \n \nRHD will appoint full-time domestic consultants or NGOs to support implementation and \n51. \nindependent  monitoring  of  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan.  The  consultants  will  be \nrecruited according to arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants.  \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n52. \nFor consulting services, procurement of equipment, and civil works contracts, loan funds \nwill  be  disbursed  using  direct  payment  and  reimbursement  procedures  in  accordance  with  \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n\na. \n\nAccounts and Audit \n\n \n53. \nRHD  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  adequate  to  identify  the  goods  and \nservices  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds,  the  financing  resources  received,  the  expenditures \nincurred for the Project, and use of local funds. The accounts will be set up in accordance with \nsound accounting principles. External accounting experts will be engaged to design the project \naccounts  to  be  used  by  RHD.  Consolidated  project  accounts  and  related  financial  statements \nwill be audited annually by private sector auditors acceptable to ADB. The audited reports and \nrelated financial statements will be submitted to ADB not later than 6 months after the end of the \nfiscal year to which they relate. The Office of the Director of Accounts in RHD will coordinate all \n\n\f \n\n13 \n\naccounts  activities  and  ensure  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  audit  and  accounting  requirements, \nwhich will be followed up in regular reviews by ADB. \n \n54. \nAll procurement activities will be subject to an independent performance audit to ensure \ntransparency  and  objective  and  independent  assessment  of  such  activities.  The  performance \naudit  will  be  conducted  twice  during  implementation  in  conjunction  with  the  annual  audit  of \nproject  accounts  and  related  financial  statements,  and  will  be  carried  out  by  the  same  private \nsector auditors. In addition, ADB will conduct project procurement audits during implementation \nas part of its regular review process. \n\n \nb. \n\nReports \n\n \nThe  supervision  consultant  will  submit  monthly  progress  reports  to  RHD,  MOC,  and \n55. \nADB. RHD will ensure that the consultant includes in the reports the status of land acquisition \nand  resettlement  and  other  activities  that  are  critical  to  project  implementation,  but  are  not \ndirectly included in the scope of the engineering services. This will continue until the Project has \nbeen  completed.  Within  three  months  of  physical  completion,  the  consultant  will  prepare  a \ncompletion report in a format acceptable to RHD and ADB. \n \n56. \nRHD  will  monitor  project  preparation  and  implementation  in  accordance  with  the \nimplementation  schedule,  and  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  any  significant  deviations  that  could \nresult in the schedule not being met.  \n \n\n6. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n57. \nRHD,  assisted  by  the  supervision  consultant,  will  establish  a  capability  for  systematic \nproject performance monitoring and analysis throughout the life of the Project, integrated with its \nmanagement  information  system.  Before  construction,  project  performance  monitoring  will \ndevelop and conduct a \u201cquick and easy\u201d sample survey to establish a baseline for subsequent \nperformance  monitoring.  After  construction  is  completed,  surveys  will  be  conducted  annually. \nThe scope of the survey, quantity and quality of data, and frequency of collection will be guided \nprimarily  by  the  project  management\u2019s  need  for  progressive  and  rapid  feedback  on \nimplementation  status,  as  well  as  early  warning  on  situations  that  might  jeopardize  the \nattainment  of  the  development  objectives.  The  key  indicators  and  assumptions  outlined  at  the \ndevelopment objective (i.e., goal and purpose) levels in the project framework (Appendix 1) will \nform  the  core  of  the  data  required  for  assessment.  Project  performance  monitoring  will  be \nstrengthened  by  supplementary  systematic  analysis  of  sample  data  from  similar  nonproject \nareas. \n \n\n7. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n58. \nADB staff will review the implementation of the Project through regular or special review \nmissions. The Loan Agreement will also require a detailed midterm review. Based on the project \nschedule,  the  review  will  be  carried  out  around  July/August  2005.  The  midterm  review  will \ndiscuss  with  the  Government  the  approach  to  contracting  out  routine  maintenance  through  a \nperformance-based  maintenance  contract.  Terms  of  reference  for  the  midterm  review  will  be \nincluded in the project administration memorandum to be prepared by ADB\u2019s Inception Mission \nfor the Project. \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \nA. \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nEconomic Impacts \n\n \nThe benefits of the Project are wide-ranging and include direct and quantifiable benefits \n59. \nas well as indirect and nonquantifiable benefits. The direct and quantifiable benefits consist of \nsavings  in  vehicle  operating  costs  (VOCs)  to  normal  traffic  (and  diverted  traffic  where \napplicable)  and  savings  in  time  costs.  Nonquantifiable  benefits  include  greater  comfort  and \nsafety  for  road  users,  and  reduced  damage  to  cargo.  Indirect  benefits  are  those  arising  from \nsecondary effects brought about by the reduction in VOCs and time costs, which in turn lead to \nincreased  economic  activities.  Indirect  benefits  have  been  estimated  in  the  form  of  generated \npassenger and cargo traffic.  \n \n60. \nThe  beneficiaries  include  (i)  those  benefiting  directly  from  the  investments,  i.e.,  the \nvarious categories of road users such as owners/operators of buses and trucks, passengers of \nthe various vehicle categories, cyclists and pedestrians, and cargo owners and those involved in \nthe  production  of  cargo;  and  (ii)  those  benefiting  indirectly  because  they  live  and  work  in  the \narea  of  influence  of  the  roads.  The  latter  is  estimated  at  some  2.75  million  people  when  the \nzone  of  influence  is  taken  as  a  band  of  15  km  (7.5  km  on  either  side  of  the  road).    It  is  also \nestimated that about 50% of this population live below the (upper) poverty line.14 This population \nis  expected  to  benefit  because  the  road  investments  will  mitigate  the  underlying  causes  of \npoverty in the area by facilitating economic integration and economic development on which the \nrealization of the area\u2019s broader needs \uf8e7 medical facilities, schools and livelihood opportunities \n\uf8e7 ultimately depends.  \n \n61. \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the project roads ranges from 17.7% to \n30.8%,  or  a  combined  EIRR  of  24.5%.  A  review  of  the  various  factors  affecting  the  EIRR \nindicates that the main threat to the viability of the investment is premature road failure due to \ninadequate  maintenance  and  overloading.  The  Project  includes  measures  to  address  these \nrisks  by  helping  the  Government  to  establish  and  implement  appropriate  policies.  Various \nsensitivity  tests  indicate  that  the  EIRR  is  robust  in  relation  to  a  construction  cost  increase  of \n15%, reduction of benefits by 20%, and reduction by 30% of benefits derived from nonmotorized \ntraffic.  The  switching  values  of  those  sensitivity  tests  range  from  34%  to  314%.  Detailed \neconomic analysis for the road improvement components is in Appendix 12. \n \nB. \n \n62. \nThe  Project  proceeded  through  different  stages  with  a  strong  poverty  focus  at  every \nstage.    First,  the  target  area  in  which  the  project  roads  were  selected  comprises  some  of  the \npoorest  districts  in  the  country.  Second,  following  the  establishment  of  a  comprehensive \ndatabase  of  all  roads  in  this  target  area,  roads  were  screened  based  on  a  number  of  criteria, \nincluding  the  socioeconomic  profile  of  the  districts  and  of  its  population,  expected  poverty \nreduction  impacts,  road  conditions,  traffic,  road  network  requirements,  and  input  from \nstakeholders through an extensive process of consultations.  In the final stage, a selection was \nmade  from  among  the  roads  screened  in  the  second  stage,  taking  into  account  the  funding \nconstraint.   \n\nPoverty Reduction Impacts \n\n                                                           \n14 Upper poverty line:  the level of per capita income or consumption at which the members of a household can be \nexpected to meet their basic food consumption needs \u2013 i.e., to meet their calorie intake requirements \u2013 as well as \nsome  essential  nonfood  need.    These  estimates  are  based  on  Bangladesh  Bureau  of  Statistics  (BSS).  2000. \nHousehold Expenditure and Income Survey (HEIS). \n\n\f \n\n15 \n\nThe  technical  features  and  implementation  arrangements  were  designed  so  as  to \n63. \naddress the key needs and concerns of the poor. The road designs provide for wider shoulders \nthan  has  been  the  standard  so  far;  in  addition,  the  shoulders  will  be  surfaced.  These  features \nwill  ensure  much  improved  road  space  and  riding  conditions  for  nonmotorized  traffic,  which  is \nthe  mode  used  overwhelmingly  by  the  poorer  sections  of  the  population.  In  addition,  targeted \ninterventions  during  the  construction  phase  are  designed  to  benefit  the  poor.  They  include  (i) \nrecruiting  labor  from  the  project  area.  It  is  estimated  that  funds  directly  injected  in  the  local \neconomy  from  employment  of  locally  recruited  labor  will  amount  to  some  Tk355  million;  (ii) \nprocuring goods and services from within the project area; and (iii) providing for gender equity in \nthe  construction  contracts  to  ensure  that  women  employed  in  road  construction  activities  will \nreceive comparable pay for comparable work. \n \nA distribution analysis assessed the extent to which the direct and quantifiable benefits \n64. \nflowing  from  the  Project  during  the  operational  phase  accrue  to  poor  people  and  hence  to \ncalculate  the  poverty  impact  ratio  of  the  project  investments.  The  benefits  considered  include \nthe  savings  in  VOCs  and  time  costs  of  motorized  and  nonmotorized  traffic.  The  approach  to \ndetermining  the  poverty  impact  of  the  Project  proceeded  in  two  steps.  First, an estimate was \nmade of the distribution of the directly quantifiable benefits to the various categories of road \nusers, i.e., bus and truck operators/owners; bus and motor rickshaw passengers; car, utility, \nand  motorcycle  owners,  drivers  and  passengers;  rickshaw  passengers  and  cyclists.  The \nestimates  were  based  on  the  analysis  of  the  competitive  conditions  in  the  transport  and \nproduct markets. Second, the poverty status of these road users was determined based on \n(i) a poverty line for the area of the project roads, and (ii) a survey of road users to establish \nwhether their income is below or above this poverty line.   \n \n65. \nThe  analysis  of  the  distribution  of  project  effects  among  road  users,  construction \nworkers, the Government, and lenders took as starting point the outcome of the distribution of \nbenefits  among  road  users  and  incorporated  the  negative  or  positive  effects  on  (i)  the \nGovernment  and  the  economy  in  general  (a  negative  effect)  by  way  of  the  subsidy  the \nGovernment provides to road users in funding part of the construction cost and the loss of tax \nrevenue it incurs as a result of savings in VOCs; (ii) lenders who also provide a subsidy to road \nusers  as  a  result  of  the  concessional  loan  terms;  and  (iii)  construction  workers  who  gain \nbecause the salaries earned are higher than the opportunity cost of their labor.  When gains and \nlosses  of  all  parties  were  netted,  the  analysis  reveals  that  Tk3.71  billion  of  the  total  gains  of \nTk7.01 billion accrues to the poor, with the poverty impact ratio of 0.53. The distribution analysis \nis  summarized  in  Appendix  13.  A  detailed  distribution  analysis  is  available  as  Supplementary \nAppendix B. \n \nC. \n \n66. \nCurrently more than 50% of the population in the project areas live below ADB\u2019s poverty \nline in Bangladesh. The net benefit of the project will be distributed among the following groups: \n(i) users of freight transport, (ii) users of passengers transport, (iii) vehicle owners, (iv) labor, (v) \nthe Government, and (vi) the economy in general. The Project will benefit the entire population \nresiding  in  the  project  areas  through  improved  access  to  resources  and  markets  and  the \ngenerated  income-earning  opportunities.  By  facilitating  economic  growth,  the  Project  will \ncontribute  to  poverty  reduction.  The  Project  will  create  construction  job  opportunities  of  about \n133,000  person-months  for  both  skilled  and  unskilled  workers  during  project  implementation.  \nMen  and  women  will  be  provided  equal  opportunity  for  employment.  The  summary  poverty \nreduction and social strategy is in Appendix 14. \n \n\nSocial Impacts \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\nThe  Project  is  also  expected  to  produce  the  following  nonquantifiable  benefits:  (i) \n67. \nimproved  physical  access  to  basic  social  services  such  as  health  clinics  and  schools,  (ii) \nimproved infrastructure safety and efficient enforcement of traffic safety rules, and (iii) inceased \npublic awareness on safety.   \n \n68. \nThe  Project  will  affect  approximately  2,108  structures  and  required  acquisition  of  60 \nhectares for right-of-way.  The affected people are approximately 8,204. The total cost for both \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement  is  estimated  to  be  $3.6  million  equivalent.  An  initial \nresettlement  plan  has  been  prepared,  addressing  the  scope  of  resettlement,  socioeconomic \ninformation  on  the  affected  people,  policy  framework  and  entitlement  matrix,  resettlement \nobjective  and  strategy,  participation  and  grievance  redress,  institutional  arrangements, \nmonitoring, cost estimates, and implementation schedule. The summary resettlement plan is in \nAppendix 15. A small number of tribal people living in one of the project areas are not directly \naffected  by  the  Project.  Therefore,  the  Project  will  not  involve  the  ADB  policy  on  indigenous \npeoples.  The  Government  will  prepare  a  full  resettlement  plan,  based  on  100%  census  and \nasset  inventory,  and  submit  it  to  ADB  for  approval.  Civil  works  contracts  will  be  awarded  only \nwhen ADB approves the resettlement plan. \n \nD. \n \nThe Project will improve roads that are currently in place. The overall finding of the initial \n69. \nenvironmental  examination  (IEE)  is  that  the  Project  will  not  cause  significant  environmental \nproblems  and  the  potential  adverse  impacts  are  manageable.  In  addition,  the  Project  will  not \ndisturb  any  environmentally  sensitive  areas.  Therefore,  a  full  environment  impact  assessment \n(EIA)  to  determine  further  impacts  of  the  roads  involved  is  not  required.  However,  one  of  the \nproject  roads,  the  Mymensingh-Nandail  road,  falls  under  the  red  category  in  Bangladesh\u2019s \nEnvironmental Preservation Rules 1997, which requires a full EIA.15 Civil works for this project \nroad can be started only after the Department of Environment (DOE) issues an environmental \nclearance  based  on  the  full  EIA.  The  EIA  for  the  subject  road  will  be  prepared  as  part  of  the \ndetailed engineering design of the road, and will be submitted to ADB with DOE\u2019s environmental \nclearance before civil works contracts are awarded.  \n \n   Implementation  of  mitigation  measures  during  the  construction  stage  will  be  the \n70. \nresponsibility  of  the  contractor.  An  environmental  engineer,  who  will  be  hired  as  part  of \nconsulting  services  for  supervision,  will  assist  the  Social  and  Environmental  Circle  (SEC)  of \nRHD  in  preparing  contractual  documentation  so  that  the  bidding  documents,  bills  of  quantity, \nand other contractual obligations of the contractor clearly identify environmental responsibilities \nand  describe  penalties  for  noncompliance.  RHD  together  with  SEC  will  be  responsible  for \nimplementing  overall  environmental  monitoring  and  management  plan.  The  summary \nenvironmental analysis is in Appendix 16. \n \nE. \n \n71. \nThe  proposed  road  improvement  component  does  not  present  exceptional  or  unusual \nrisks that would require specially designed mitigation measures. RHD, the contractors, and the \nsupervision consultants are all familiar with the kind of works to be financed and have performed \nsatisfactorily  in  implementing  similar  works.  If  the  implementation  arrangements  are  properly \nstructured,  the  risks  of  failure  of  the  construction  works  will  be  minimal.  The  main  risk  for  the \n\nRisks \n\n                                                           \n15  According  to  Bangladesh\u2019s  Environmental  Preservation  Rules  1997,  any  improvement  works  for  national  and \nregional  roads  require  a  full  environmental  impact  assessment  regardless  of  the  types  of,  and  the  expected \nenvironmental impact from, improvement works.  \n\n\f \n\n17 \n\nroad  improvement  component  is  that  inadequate  maintenance  and  truck  overloading  may \nprevent the expected benefit streams from being achieved or, if they are achieved, from being \nsustained. This risk factor will be addressed by incorporating a project component to secure a \nGovernment budget for road maintenance and undertaking policy dialogue to improve axle-load \ncontrol.  The  economic  returns  for  periodic  maintenance  are  typically  high,  and  the  Project  will \nfocus on priority maintenance based on the economic ranking of the ARMP. \n \n72. \nThe  notable  project  risk  concerns  contracting  out  of  routine  maintenance  based  on  a \nperformance-based maintenance contract. Local private contractors may be unfamiliar with this \nnew contract. The performance-based maintenance contract may be poorly designed and thus \nfail to provide the right incentives or penalties to the contractors. This risk will be addressed by \nproviding  consulting  services  for  designing  the  performance-based  maintenance  contract  and \nmonitoring the performance of the contractors.  \n \n73. \nThe risk in project implementation will be addressed by (i) approving advance action for \nprocurement, (ii) preparing the land acquisition and resettlement plan and EIA by consulting with \nstakeholders,  (iii)  obtaining  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  for  counterpart  funding,  and  (iv) \nproviding sufficient resources for supervision consulting services.  \n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n74. \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents:  \n \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nA. \n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  all  counterpart  funding  required  for  the \nProject in accordance with the financing plan \uf8e7 including the cost of land \nacquisition,  other  resettlement  compensation,  and  implementation  and \nmonitoring  under  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan,  utility \nrelocation,  and  general  project  management  expenses  \uf8e7  will  be  fully \nprovided in a timely manner through approved annual development plan \nallocations. \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nactivities  are  implemented  in  accordance  with  all  applicable  laws  and \nregulation, and ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement, as set out in the \nagreed upon resettlement plan, including \n\n(a)  land and rights-of-way acquired in a proper and timely manner; \n(b)  compensation and entitlements as stipulated in the resettlement plan; \n(c)  timely  provision  of  counterpart  funds  and  disbursements  to  affected \n\n(d)  guarantee  to  meet  unforeseen  obligations  in  excess  of  budget \n\n(e)  adequate  supervision,  monitoring,  and  reporting  by  the  Executing \n\npeoples; \n\nestimate; \n\nAgency; \n\n(f)  external  monitoring  and  evaluation  by  a  competent  independent \n\nagency (consultant or NGO); \n\n(g)  annual audit of resettlement fund disbursements and expenditures; \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n(h)  adequate  information  dissemination  and  consultation  with  affected \n\npeoples; \n\n(i)  documentation of consultation and grievances;  \n(j)  updated resettlement plan if the scope of the Project is changed; and \n(k)  regular reporting of progress to ADB.  \n \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  all  environmental  mitigation  measures \nidentified  in  the  IEE  and  to  be  identified  in  the  EIA  are  incorporated  into \nthe project design and followed during project construction, operation and \nmaintenance  in  consultation  with,  DOE,  and  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nEIA requirements.  \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  civil  work  contractors  comply  with  all \napplicable  labor  laws,  do  not  employ  child  labor  for  construction  and \nmaintenance  activities,  and  provide  appropriate  facilities  for  children  in \nconstruction campsites. The Government will set employment targets for \nwomen for road construction activities, and will require contractors not to \ndifferentiate wages between men and women for work of equal value. A \nspecific clause will be included in bidding documents, and compliance will \nbe strictly monitored during project implementation. \n\nThe Government will ensure that an adequate number of information and \neducation  campaigns  on  sexually  transmitted  diseases  and  HIV/AIDS16 \nfor  construction  workers  will  be  conducted  at  worksites  as  part  of  the \nhealth and safety program. \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  loan  proceeds  for  routine  road \nmaintenance  will  be  used  for  contracting  out  routine  maintenance  of \nabout  50  km  of  regional  or  type  A  feeder  roads  through  a  performance-\nbased maintenance contract for 3-5 years.  \n\nThe Government will ensure that within 18 months of loan effectiveness, \nsupervision  consultants  will  carry  out  a  feasibility  study  for  privatizing \nRHD\u2019s road maintenance equipment and workshops, and develop a time-\nbound action plan for implementing its recommendations. \n\n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii)  Within  1  year  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  submit  to  the \nParliament  a  draft  Road  Transport  and  Traffic  Act  that  will  replace  the \nMotor Vehicles Ordinance.  \n\n(ix) \n\nThe  Government  will  absorb  the  current  staff  resources  in  BRTA  Road \nSafety  Cell  financed  under  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Road  Rehabilitation  and \nMaintenance Project 3, and provide sufficient budget for the Road Safety \nCell to carry out its tasks as secretariat to NRSC. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                           \n16  HIV/AIDS = Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n\n\f \n\n19 \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\nB. \n \n\nThe Government will approve a project proforma for the Project.  \n\nThe terms for the administration of the OPEC loan as set forth in a draft of \nthe  OPEC  Administration  Agreement  will  have  been  agreed  upon \nbetween ADB and OPEC Fund. \n\nC. \n\nConditions for Contract Award for Civil Works \n\nThe Government will ensure that, after detailed design and before award \nof civil works contracts, a full land acquisition survey, 100 per cent census \nof people affected, and 100% asset inventory, are required to finalize the \nresettlement  plan.  This  would  provide  a  final  head  count  of  affected \npeople,  and  final  measurement  of  losses  in  terms  of  numbers  of  assets \nlost, broken down by category of loss and category of entitled person, and \napplicable rates per category. Affected people include both those affected \nthrough loss of assets and those affected through loss of livelihood. The \nresettlement budget should be revised based on the new data collected, \nand any additional land acquisition and resettlement cost will be borne by \nthe Government. This full resettlement plan will be submitted to ADB for \nreview and approval before award of civil works contracts. \n\nThe Government will prepare a full EIA for Mymensingh-Nandail road as \npart  of  detailed  designing  and  submit  it  with  DOE\u2019s  environmental \nclearance to ADB before award of civil works contract. \n\nRHD will (i) appoint the supervision consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants; and (b) acquire or make available \nthe land and the rights to land, free from any encumbrances, required for \nthe execution of the Project before award of civil works contract. \n\nCondition  of  Disbursement  for  Civil  Works  for  the  Jamalpur-Dewanganj \nRoad (contract No. 3) and Saidpur-Parbatipur Road (contract No. 4) \n\nD. \n\n \n\nThe  OPEC  Fund  Loan  Agreement  will  have  been  duly  executed  and \ndelivered, and all conditions precedent to its effectiveness will have been \nfulfilled. \n\nThe  Government  will  have  submitted  to  ADB  a  legal  opinion  stating  that \nthe OPEC Fund Loan Agreement has been duly authorized or ratified by, \nand  executed  and  delivered  on  behalf  of,  the  Government  and  OPEC \nFund,  and  is  legally  binding  upon  OPEC  Fund  and  the  Government  in \naccordance  with  its  terms,  subject  to  the  fulfillment  of  the  conditions \nprecedent to its

\n\n1. \n\nIntroduction \n\nThe Project involves improving 47 kilometers (km) of regional roads and 127 km of type \n\n \n1. \nA feeder roads in Mymensingh region and in Rangpur region. \n \n2.  \nThe  roads  or  road  sections  to  be  improved  under  the  Project  were  traditionally \nconstructed  with  sand  seal  surfacing  or  thin  bituminous  carpeting  over  brick  macadam  base, \nwhich have deteriorated and do not satisfy international standards in alignment, cross section, \nand  pavement  structure.  The  suggested  improvements  are  full  reconstruction  following  the \ncurrent alignment, but including widening and correcting substandard curves.  \n \n3.  \nAs  required  by  the  terms  of  reference  for  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance \n(TA 3508-BAN: Road Network Improvement and Maintenance I), the consultant conducted the \nfeasibility  study  for  the  project  roads  and  prepared  preliminary  designs.  The  TA  consultant  \ndesigned  the  project  roads  in  accordance  with  current  international  standards  and  procedures \nbut  largely  followed  Geometric  Design  Standards  of  RHD  (unpublished),  and  Guidelines  for \nBridge  Design  by  RHD,  respectively,  for  cross  section  parameters  of  roads  and  structural \nconfigurations. The principal international standards that were adopted follow: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nFor  the  highway  alignment  design:  TRRL.  UK.  1998.  Recommendations  of \nTransport and Road Research Laboratory, Overseas Road Note 6; and American \nAssociation  of  State  Highway  and  Transportation  Officials  (AASHTO).  1994.  A \nPolicy on Geometric Design of Highway and Streets.  \nTRRL.  UK,  and  AASHTO.    Method  for  Design  of  Pavements.  Oversedas  Road \nNote 31.  \nFor  bridges  and  other  drainage  structures:  AASHTO.  1996.  Standard \nSpecifications for Highway Bridges. \nFor materials, AASHTO and American Society for Testing and Materials methods \nwere used. \n\n2.  \n\nHorizontal and Vertical Geometry and Cross Sections \n\nTraffic counts were taken during the feasibility study, and projections were developed for \n4.  \nthe 20-year project evaluation period. The projections were used to determine physical capacity \nrequirements in terms of number and width of lanes for motorized and nonmotorized traffic, and \nintersection layouts. A design speed of 85 km per hour for national and regional roads and 65 \nkm  for  feeder  roads  was  adopted  and  the  horizontal  and  vertical  alignments  were  designed \naccordingly. \n \n5.  \nCross sections were developed from traffic projections for motorized and nonmotorized \ntraffic, and the terrain. The cross section consists of motorized traffic lanes of 7.3 m, 5.5 m, and \n3.65  m,  respectively,  for  national,  regional,  and  type  A  feeder  roads,  with  two  surfaced \nshoulders of 1.5 m for all types of road except for the pilot feeder road, which will have 2.0 m \nhard shoulders. A feature that adds to the overall cost but is considered necessary for reasons \nof safety and traffic flow efficiency is surfaced shoulders along the length of each project road. \nThe shoulders will provide space for nonmotorized and slow motorized traffic as well as space \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n25 \n\n \n\nfor vehicle repairs, tire replacement, or mechanical breakdown, without disturbing traffic flow or \nposing high traffic safety risks. \n \n\nPavements \n\n3. \n \n6.  \nThe pavements were designed in accordance with accepted international standards and \nprocedures  for  a  20-year  life,  with  provision  for  overlays  during  or  at  the  end  of  10  years  to \ncover  the  serviceability  loss  and  extend  the  life  to  20  years  while  maintaining  international \nroughness index at recommended level. The designs will be based on traffic counts and traffic \nprojections  (for  capacity),  and  axle-load  surveys  and  projections  (for  structural  capacity).  The \npavement structure will consist typically of an improved subgrade, a granular subbase of brick \naggregate, a base of stone aggregate, asphaltic concrete surfacing (base course and wearing \ncourse),  or  double  bituminous  surface  dressing.  Roughness  values  for  the  completed \npavements, expressed in international roughness index terms, should be 2.0-2.5. \n\n4.  \n\nBridges and Drainage Structures \n\n \n7.  \nThe  structures  were  designed  in  accordance  with  AASHTO  standards.  AASHTO  HS20 \nlive  loading  was  adopted  and  the  return  period  of  20  years  was  considered  for  drainage \nstructures.  Improvement  of  structures  includes  (i)  rehabilitating  bridges/culvert  decks,  and \nwidening structures according to road section and RHD guidelines; (ii) reconstructing  structures \nthat must be replaced because of structural and hydrological inadequacy; and (iii) constructing \nnew structures on realigned sections.  \n \n B. \n \n8.  \n \n\nDetails of the roads for improvement are in Table A3.  \n\nRoads for Improvement \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable A3: Details of Preliminary Design of Roads  \n\nMymensingh-\nNandail \n\n47.0 \n2 lanes \n\nMymensingh Region \nMuktagacha-\nChechua \n10.0 \n2 lanes \n\nJamalpur-\nDewanganj \n\n41.0 \n2 lanes \n\nMithapukur-\nMadhyapara \n24.0 \n2 lanes \n\nRangpur Region \nThakurgaon-\nRanisankail \n\n37.0 \n2 lanes \n\nSaidpur-\nParbatipur \n15.0 \n2 lanes \n\n \n \n \n \n5.5 m traffic  \nlane \n \n5.5 m traffic  \nlane \n \n \n \n1.81 m each,  \nno pavement \n \n3.35 m each,  \n1.5 m paved \nReconstruction  Reconstruction  Reconstruction  Reconstruction  Reconstruction  Reconstruction \n\n \n \n \n3.65 m traffic \nlane \n \n3.65 m traffic  \nlane \n \n \n \n1.28  m  each, \nno pavement \n \n2.45  m  each, \n1.5 m paved \n\n \n \n \n5.5 m traffic  \nlane \n \n5.5  m \nlane \n \n \n \n1.22  m  each, \nno pavement \n \n2.95  m  each, \n2.0 m paved \n\n \n \n \n3.6 5 m traffic \nlane \n \n3.65 m traffic \n lane \n \n \n \n1.72  m  each, \nno pavement \n \n2.45  m  each, \n1.5 m paved \n\n \n \n \n5.5 m traffic  \nlane \n \n5.5 m traffic \n lane \n \n \n \n1.48  m  each, \nno pavement \n \n2.45  m  each, \n1.5 m paved \n\n \n \n \n1.9  m  each,  no \npavement \n \n2.45 m each, \n 1.5 m paved \n\n \n \n \n3.65-5.5 m traffic \nlane \n \n5.5 m traffic lane \n\ntraffic \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n125 \n \n275 \n \n \n275 \n \n \n \n300 \n\n \n31.9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n100 \n \n250 \n \n \n250 \n \n \n \n300 \n\n \n4.0 \n\n \n \n \n15-20 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n225 \n \n \n250 \n \n \n \n300 \n\n \n13.5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n125 \n \n250 \n \n \n250 \n \n \n \n200 \n\n \n11.0 \n\n \n \n \n15-20 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n225 \n \n \n250 \n \n \n \n250 \n\n \n11.1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n125 \n \n250 \n \n \n200 \n \n \n \n200 \n\n \n8.1 \n\n \n\nItem \n\nLength (km) \nNumber of \nLanes \nPavement \nWidth \n \n  Current \n \n \n  Design \n\nShoulder \nWidth \n \n  Current \n \n \n  Design \n\nImprovement \nType \nPavement \n(Typical) \n \nBituminous \nSurface \nDressing \n(mm) \n \nAsphalt \nConcrete(mm) \nAggregate \nBase (mm) \n \nAggregate \nSubbase \n(mm) \n \nImproved \nSubgrade \n(mm) \n \nConstruction \nCost \n ($ million)  \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n 27\n\nCRITERIA FOR SELECTING \nPERIODIC ROAD MAINTENANCE SUBPROJECTS \n\n \n1. \nThe  periodic  road  maintenance  component  will  finance  a  time  slice  of  maintenance  of \nroads  under  the  Roads  and  Highways  Department\u2019s  (RHD\u2019s)  responsibility  from  RHD\u2019s  annual \nroad  maintenance  plan  (ARMP).  The  work  will  be  divided  into  two  annual  tranches  and  will  be \nimplemented  over  two  years.  Each  tranche  will  cover  civil  works  valued  at  about  $8  million \nequivalent, providing for periodic maintenance of about 200 kilometers (km) of roads. \n \n2. \nRoads to be included will need Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) approval. The will be \nselected annually in order of estimated economic returns, based on the rankings produced each \nyear  by  the  ARMP,  and  subject  to  the  criteria  listed  below.  Among  roads  satisfying  the  listed \ncriteria,  preference  will  be  given  to  roads  that  were  previously  improved  with  ADB  assistance. \nThe criteria for selecting subprojects for the periodic maintenance program are as follows: \n \n\nThe roads are included in RHD\u2019s ARMP and have been given priority in periodic \nmaintenance tasks, using the Highway Design and Maintenance Standards Model. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe  roads  are  located  within  the  districts  of  Dinajpur,  Gaibandha,  Kurigram, \nLalmonirhat, Nilphamari, Panchagarh, Rangpur, and Thakurgaon in the northwest \nregion,  and  Jamalpur,  Kishoreganj,  Mymensingh,  Netrokona,  and  Sherpur  in  the \ncentral north region. \n\nThe  proposed  civil  works  will  be  limited  to  periodic  maintenance  consisting  of \noverlay  and  sealing  works,  but  excluding  road  development,  upgrading,  and \nwidening. \n\nBased  on  a  minimum  10-year  evaluation  period  using  full  life  cycle  costs  and \nbenefits, the estimated economic internal rate of return for the road maintenance \nworks will be at least 20%. \n\nThe  proposed  works  will  not  adversely  affect  the  environment  and  will  include \nmitigation measures when environment impacts are anticipated. \n\nSufficient Government counterpart funding from the RHD budget will be allocated \nto implement the works as scheduled. \n\nTo facilitate efficient subproject implementation and to encourage participation by \nqualified  contractors,  the  civil  works  will  be  arranged  in  packages  each  with  an \nestimated value of at least $1.0 million. \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nPERFORMANCE-BASED MAINTENANCE CONTRACT \n\nConcept \n\nThe  performance-based  contract \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nA  performance-based  maintenance  contract  is  an  agreement  between  a  government \ndepartment or state enterprise and a private contractor whereby the private contractor maintains \nthe road to achieve specified condition standards for a certain period of time (usually long-term, \nranging from 3 to 10 years) in return for a fixed payment stream. \n \nThe concept of a performance-based contract originated from a consideration of (i) the \n2. \nincreasing lack of personnel within the government department to measure the vast quantity of \nactivities  involved  in  the  more  traditional  maintenance  contracts,  and  to  monitor  performance \nstandards using input indicators; (ii) the frequency of claims resulting from the need to increase \nthe  quantity  of  activities  in  the  original  contracts;  (iii)  the  need  to  focus  more  on  customer \nsatisfaction; and (iv) the need to shift greater responsibility to contractors throughout the entire \ncontract period, as well as to stimulate and profit from their innovative capabilities.1 \n \n3. \nThe  performance-based  contract  is  different  from  a  traditional  quantity-  and  unit-price-\nbased,  short-term  maintenance  contract.  In  the  traditional  maintenance  contract,  the  private \nsector maintains an existing road based on input indicators, such as materials, equipment, and \nlabor, and more frequently, tons of pothole patch material used, number of linear meters of pipe \nculverts  replaced,  and  number  of  square  meters  of  crack  sealed.  In  the  performance-based \ncontract,  the  private  sector  maintains  an  existing  road  on  the  basis  of  customer-based \nperformance indicators, such as riding and strength quality (smoothness), safety features, and \naesthetic and attractiveness of the roadside. \n \n4. \nfrom  a  road  operation  and \nmaintenance  concession.  Under  the  performance-based  contract,  performance  risks  are \nallocated  between  the  government/client  and  the  contractor.  However,  the  traffic  risk  remains \nwith \nthe \nconcessionaire  assumes  the  traffic  and,  ultimately,  the  revenue  risks.  The  concessionaire \ncollects toll, maintains the road, and pays an agreed-upon amount to the government. Since the \nrisk  from  uncertain  traffic  is  to  be  borne  by  the  private  sector,  the  road  operation  and \nmaintenance concession is suitable only for roads with sufficient traffic volume. For low-volume \nroads,  the  performance-based  contract  may  prove  a  promising  alternative  modality  for  private \nsector participation in road maintenance. \n \n5. \nPerformance-based maintenance is especially suitable for low-volume roads with gravel \nsurface  or  thin  bituminous  surface  treatments,  as  the  continued  serviceability  of  such  roads \ndepends  on  the  quality  and  reliability  of  future  maintenance.  It  offers  an  effective  means  to \nimprove the efficiency and public accountability of road maintenance operations. Other benefits \ninclude improved service to road users and reduced size of the government establishment (staff, \nequipment,  and  workshops)  needed  for  road  maintenance  operations.  In  the  long  run,  this \napproach  will  significantly  reduce  the  unit  cost  of  maintenance  operations  while  improving  the \nquality and cost-effectiveness of maintenance works. \n \nB. \n \nThe contractor is responsible for maintaining the road at performance standards agreed \n6. \nupon  in  the  contract.  These  standards  should  be  defined  with  the  aim  of  minimizing  the  long-\n                                                           \n1 Cabana, G, G Liautaud, and A Faiz. 1999.

Inspectors may be hired to \ninspect the road and make random checks regularly to verify compliance. Road users may also \nbe  encouraged  to  take  an  important  role  in  monitoring  performance  by  reporting  road \ndeficiencies to the road agency. A percentage of noncompliance may be calculated based on a \nformula incorporated in the contract, by which penalties are applied. \n \nC. \n \nThe guiding principle for the bidding processes should be to maximize competition and \n8. \nclarity of the process. The major aspects that should be considered to ensure competitive and \ntransparent bidding processes are as follows: \n \n\nBidding Processes \n\nDetailed  development  of  the  contract  should  be  set  out  clearly  in  the  bidding \ndocuments, specifying the responsibilities of the contractor and the government. \n\nA draft contract agreement should be prepared by the government and included \nin the bidding documents to ensure that all bidders make similar assumptions. \n\nThe  evaluation  criteria  should  be  clearly  set  out  in  the  bidding  documents.  The \nmost transparent approach is to select a single criterion, perhaps the lowest level \nof bid price for a given performance specification. The decision should be made \nonly  after  prequalification  procedures  where  potential  bidders  are  evaluated  in \nterms of their technical, operational, and financial capacity. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f  30         Appendix 6\n\nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN\n($ million)\n\nProject Cost\n\nFinancing Source\n\nForeign\n\nLocal\n\nExchange Currency\n\nTotal\nCost\n\nOPEC\nADB Government Fund\n\nItem\n\nA.

The  Project,  which  will  be  the \nresponsibility of the Roads and Highways Department (RHD) in coordination with the Ministry of \nCommunication, will involve improvement of 174 kilometers (km) of regional and type-A feeder \nroads  in  Mymensingh  region  and  Rangpur  region.  The  civil  works  for  the  road  improvement \ncomponent will be executed through five contracts, ranging in value from $11.1 million to $19.1 \nmillion: \n \n\n \n \n\n  Muktagacha- Chechua (type A feeder road, 10 km) \n  Reconstruction  \n\nContract No. 1: Mymensingh \u2013 Nandail, Section 1 (regional road, 20 km)  \n \n \nContract No. 2: Mymensingh-Nandail, Section 2 (regional road, 27 km) \n \nContract No. 3: Jamalpur-Dewanganj (type A feeder road, 41 km) \n \nContract No. 4: Mithapukur-Madhyapara (type A feeder road, 24 km) \n\n  Reconstruction \n\n  Reconstrcution \n\n \n\n \n\n  Saidpur-Parbatipur (type A feeder road, 15 km) \n  Reconstruction \n\n \n\n  Reconstruction \n\nContract No. 5: Thakurgaon-Ranisankail (type A feeder road, 37 km) \n \n \n2.  \nThe contracts for the road improvement component will be procured under international \ncompetitive bidding (ICB) procedures. Before the consultant to which these terms of reference \napply is appointed, the design consultants will have brought procurement to the stage of award \nof contract. The terms of reference were prepared on that basis. Assuming the procurement and \nconsultant appointment schedules proceed as planned, the consultant will take over the process \nimmediately  before  notices  to  proceed  with  the  civil  works  are  issued,  and  will  manage  the \nprocess from that time onward. \n \n3.  \nThe works will be executed under ADB\u2019s standard bidding documents (Procurement of \nCivil  Works,  August  1997),  based  on  the  Federation  Internationale  des  Ingenieurs-Conseils \n(FIDIC) Conditions of Contract, Fourth Edition. As defined in these conditions, the employer will \nbe RHD, the engineer will be the employer's representative, and the engineer's representative \nwill be the consultant, selected and engaged by RHD in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants. The consultant will nominate a team leader to act as the representative \non site. The construction periods for the individual contracts will be around 36 months. \n \n4.  \nThe  consultant  will  prepare  the  civil  works  contract  packages  for  the  periodic  road \nmaintenance component. The works will be packaged in contracts with an estimated value of at \nleast $1 million each. Civil works packages with an estimated value of $1 million-$3 million will \nbe procured in accordance with local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB, using \nthe  single-stage,  two-envelope  procedure.  Civil  works  packages  with  an  estimated  value  of \nmore  than  $3  million  will  be  procured  through  ICB  procedures  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nGuidelines for Procurement.

The  main  quantifiable \nbenefits from these investments are savings in road user costs (vehicle operating costs [VOCs] \nand time costs) for traffic using the roads.   \n \nB. \n \n\nTraffic Analysis and Projections \n\n1. \n\nBase Year Traffic \n\n \n2. \nFor  purposes  of  traffic  analyses,  representative  vehicles  (Table  A12.1,  column  1)  were \nselected  based  on  traffic  surveys.    The  2001  base  year  traffic  was  estimated  on  the  basis  of \nhistorical  trends,  classified  traffic  counts,  an  origin-destination  (O-D)  survey  carried  out  in  the \nproject areas, and a seasonal adjustment factor. \n \n\nTable A12.1:  Base Year Traffic, by Project Road, 2001 \n(No.) \n\nRepresentative \nVehicle \n\nMuktagacha- \nChechua \n\nMymensingh- \nNandail  \n\nJamalpur- \nDewanganj \n\nMithapukur- \nMadhyaparaa \n\nThakurgaon- \nRanisankail \n\nSaidpur- \nParbatipur \n\nHeavy Truck \nMedium Truck \nSmall Truck \nLarge Bus \nMedium Bus \nMicro Bus \nCar \nUtility \nAuto-Rickshaw \nMotorcycle \nTotal Motorized \n\n0 \n224 \n37 \n60 \n69 \n52 \n55 \n92 \n197 \n258 \n1,044 \n\nMotorized \n0 \n228 \n88 \n251 \n51 \n104 \n65 \n65 \n91 \n306 \n1,249 \n\nNonmotorized \n\n0 \n29 \n63 \n11 \n8 \n10 \n8 \n21 \n111 \n326 \n587 \n\n20 \n193 \n73 \n30 \n82 \n38 \n64 \n107 \n110 \n639 \n1,356 \n\n0 \n69 \n21 \n11 \n67 \n28 \n4 \n40 \n196 \n803 \n1,239 \n\n0 \n162 \n37 \n4 \n91 \n63 \n19 \n112 \n10 \n454 \n952 \n\nBicycle \nRickshaw \nCart \nTotal Nonmotorized\na  Year 2006 traffic.

The key factors in the traffic projection are growth in GDP \nand  the  elasticity  of  traffic  to  GDP  growth.    Over  the  analysis  period  \uf8e7  2002-2026  \uf8e7  GDP  is \nprojected to grow in a range of 5.0% - 5.5% and the elasticity of transport demand is projected \nin a range of 1.20-1.35.  The resultant traffic growth factors are shown in Table A12.2. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n Appendix 12 \n\n43 \n \n\nTable A12.2: Traffic Growth, by Vehicle Category \n(%) \nMotorized \n\nNonmotorized \n\nPassenger \n7.4 \n6.9 \n6.3 \n\n \n\nFreight \n7.2 \n6.6 \n6.0 \n\n6 \n5 \n5 \n\nPeriod \n\n2002 \u2013 2007 \n2007 \u2013 2012 \n2012 \u2013 2026 \n\n \nThe  road  improvements  will  also  give  rise  to  generated  traffic,  i.e.,  traffic  that  did  not \n4. \nexist  before  the  investment.    Additional  traffic  will  be  generated  as  a  result  of  the  increased \nattractiveness  of  the  project  area  for  agricultural  production  and  business  activities  following \nreduced VOCs.  Generated traffic was estimated conservatively at 10% of normal traffic. \n \nC. \n \n\nEconomic Evaluation \n\n1. \n\nBenefits and Beneficiaries \n\n \n5. \nThe direct and quantifiable benefits of the project consist of savings in VOCs to normal \ntraffic (and diverted traffic where applicable), and savings in time costs. Nonquantifiable benefits \ninclude  greater  comfort  for  passengers  and  reduced  damage  to  cargo.  Indirect  benefits  are \nthose  arising  from  secondary  effects  brought  about  by  the  reduction  in  VOCs  and  time  costs, \nwhich  brings  about  increased  economic  activities.  These  benefits  have  been  estimated  in  the \nform of generated passenger and cargo traffic.   \n \nThe  beneficiaries  include  (i)  those  benefiting  directly  from  the  investments,  i.e.,  the \n6. \nvarious  categories  of  road  users  such  as  owners  of  buses  and  trucks,  passengers  of  the \nvarious  vehicle  categories,  cyclists  and  pedestrians,  cargo  owners,  and  those  involved  in \nthe production of the cargo; and (ii) those benefiting indirectly because they live and work in \nthe  area  of  influence  of  the  roads.  The  latter  population  is  estimated  at  some  2.75  million \npeople when the zone of influence is taken as a band of 15 km (7.5 km on either side of the \nroad).  It  is  also  estimated  that  about  50%  of  this  population  is  living  below  the  (upper) \npoverty  line.1  This  population  is  expected  to  benefit  because  the  road  investments  will \nalleviate  the  underlying  causes  of  poverty  in  the  area  by  facilitating  economic  integration \nand  economic  development  on  which  the  realization  of  the  area\u2019s  broader  needs\u2013medical \nfacilities, schools, and livelihood opportunities\u2013ultimately depends. \n \n\n2. \n\nEvaluation Approach \n\n \n7. \nThe evaluation examines investment and maintenance costs, traffic, road condition and \nVOCs and time costs with and without the project over a period of 20 years following completion \nof the road, and identifies and estimates the differences in cost between the two cases. All costs \nelements are valued at border prices, using a world price numeraire, with all taxes and duties \nexcluded.  A  standard  conversion  factor  of  0.8  was  applied  to  nontraded  items  and  labor.  This \nevaluation was carried out using the Highway Design and Maintenance Model 4 (HDM 4), which \nhas  been  calibrated  for  conditions  in  Bangladesh  under  the  Institutional  Development  Project \nsponsored by the main funding agencies to the road sector. Under the without-project case, only \nmaintenance and minimum spot improvements would be carried out, while the with-the-project \n\n                                                 \n1  Upper poverty line:  the level of per capita income or consumption at which the members of a household can be \nexpected to meet their basic food consumption needs \u2013 i.e., to meet their calorie intake requirements \u2013 as well as \nsome essential nonfood consumption.   \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\ncase provides for major improvement.  For generated traffic, half of the VOC savings of normal \ntraffic was adopted. \n \n\n3. \n\nTechnical Options \n\n \n8. \nThe engineering evaluations examined the feasibility of rehabilitating only the pavement \nthrough  an  overlay.  This  was  not  found  viable  due  to  the  poor  quality  of  the  pavement  layers \nand  of  the  subgrade  and  embankment.  Full  reconstruction  was  found  to  be  the  only  viable \nalternative as the existing structure would not be able to withstand expected pavement loadings. \nUnder the reconstruction alternative, two options were evaluated: \n \n\nOption  1:  full  reconstruction  of  the  existing  pavement,  with  repair  and  maintenance  of \nexisting structures but without widening or hard shoulders. \n \nOption  2:  full  reconstruction  of  the  existing  pavement  with  widening  of  embankments, \nconstruction  of  new  structures  and  rehabilitation  of  existing  structures,  and  including \nhard shoulders and widening where justified.  \n\n \n9. \nOption  2  was  selected  because  all  the  roads  carry  a  substantial  amount  of  non-\nmotorized traffic and the wider pavement and hard shoulders provide additional benefits mainly \nthrough higher speeds, which are not fully reflected in the quantification of road user savings. In \naddition, the hard shoulders provide significant qualitative benefits \uf8e7 comfort and safety \uf8e7 to \nnonmotorized  traffic,  a  large  portion  of  whom  are  the  poor.  One  of  the  roads  was  therefore \nselected as a pilot case for provision of wider, hard shoulders for nonmotorized traffic.   \n \n\n4. \n\nConstruction Costs \n\n \n10. \nThe economic costs of road construction and maintenance are expressed in early 2002 \nprices  (Table  A12.3)  and  were  derived  from  the  financial  costs  by  deducting  taxes  and  duties \nfrom the costs of imported equipment and materials and applying a standard conversion factor \nof 0.8 for nontraded items and labor. The costs cover physical contingencies, land acquisition, \nenvironmental mitigation, and resettlement as well as construction supervision. \n \n\nTable A12.3: Construction Costs \n(Tk million) \nPer km \n\nTotal \n\nRoad \n\nMuktagacha-Chechua \nMymensingh-Nandail \nJamalpur-Dewanganj \nMithapukur-Madhyapara \nThakurgaon-Ranisankail \nSaidpur-Parbatipur \n\n27.1 \n30.3 \n20.8 \n24.8 \n18.5 \n31.1 \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n271.2 \n1,424.6 \n850.9 \n     595.2 \n684.4 \n466.8 \n\n \n\n \n\n5. \n\nVehicle Operating Cost and Time Costs \n\n \n11. \nVOCs  for  the  representative  motorized  vehicles  are  those  prepared  by  RHD  under  the \ninstitutional development component (IDC). They were derived from financial costs by excluding \nfrom  various  cost  components  all  applicable  duties  and  taxes  such  as  customs  duty, \ndevelopment surcharge, supplementary duty, value added tax, advance income tax, and landing \npermit  fee.  For  fuels,  the  economic  costs  of  petrol,  diesel,  and  lubricants  were  calculated  by \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n45 \n \nexcluding  the  tariff  and  other  implicit  taxes  and  including  the  economic  cost  of  distribution \nexpenses. For conversion of financial costs to economic ones, a standard conversion factor of \n0.8  was  used.  For  nonmotorized  vehicles,  the  cost  and  operating  parameters  developed  by \nRHD under the IDC were also used.  VOCs for the representative vehicles at free flow speeds \nare shown in Table A12.4. \n \n\n Appendix 12 \n\nTable A12.4: VOC for Representative Vehicles  \n(Tk/km at IRIa of 2 and 6) \n\nVehicle Category \n\nIRI of 2 \n\nIRI of 6 \n\nMedium Truck \nSmall Truck \nLarge Bus \nMedium Bus \nMicrobus \nCar \nUtility \nAuto Rickshaw \nMotorcycle \n \nBicycle \nRickshaw \nAnimal Cart \n\n8.58 \n5.02 \n9.13 \n5.42 \n4.52 \n7.50 \n6.08 \n0.83 \n0.80 \n \n0.37 \n0.78 \n3.44 \n\n9.62 \n5.87 \n11.14 \n6.24 \n5.20 \n8.41 \n7.71 \n0.95 \n0.85 \n \n0.53 \n1.27 \n4.89 \n\n \n\n    a  IRI = international roughness index. \n\n \n \nThe  economic  costs  of  passenger  time  are  based  on  the  findings  of  several  studies \n12. \ncarried out in Bangladesh and estimates developed by RHD based, among others, on primary \nsurveys  carried  out  in  different  parts  of  the  country.  For  freight,  the  time  cost  estimate  was \nbased  on  the  cost  of  working  capital  tied  up  in  representative  trucks  in  the  area  of  influence \nusing cargo flows obtained in the O-D surveys.

It  was  assumed  that  construction  would  be  spread  over  3 \nyears with about 20% of the works being completed in the first year, 40% in the second year, \nand 40% in the third. It was assumed that periodic maintenance or overlays or both are applied \nevery 6-8 years depending on traffic loading. The salvage value of the road at the end of the 20-\nyear evaluation period is estimated at 20% under improvement option 2.   \n \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nAt  12%  discount,  NPV  calculated  for  each  project  road  ranges  from  Tk390  million  to \n14. \nTk2.2 billion. The consolidated NPV for six roads amounts to Tk5.4 billion.

The Project includes measures to address these risks by helping the government \nto establish and implement appropriate policies. \n \n16. \nVarious  sensitivity  tests  indicate  that  the  EIRR  is  robust  in  relation  to  construction  cost \nincreases  on  the  order  of  15-20  %.    The  EIRR,  however,  is  sensitive  to  benefits  derived  from \nnonmotorized  traffic.  Accordingly,  the  EIRR  was  tested  for  a  30%  reduction  in  benefits  from \nnonmotorized  traffic.

To  ensure  that  the  project \nbeneficiaries  include  a  high  proportion  of  the  poor,  the  project  regions  and  project  roads  were \ncarefully selected at different stages, with a strong poverty focus present at every stage. First, \nthe target area where the project roads were selected comprises some of the poorest districts in \nthe  country.  Second,  roads  in  the  area  were  screened  based  on  criteria  including  the  socio-\neconomic  profile  of  the  districts  and  of  their  population,  expected  poverty  reduction  impacts, \nroad  conditions,  traffic,  road  network  requirements,  and  input  from  stakeholders  through  an \nextensive  process  of  consultations.  In  the  third  and  final  stage,  a  selection  was  made  from \namong the roads screened, taking into account the funding constraint.   \n \nTechnical  Design.  The  technical  features  were  designed  so  as  to  address  the  key \n3. \nneeds and concerns of poor people among the beneficiaries. The road designs not only provide \nfor wider shoulders than the standard so far, in addition, the shoulders will be surfaced. These \nfeatures will ensure much improved road space and riding conditions for nonmotorized vehicles, \nthe mode used overwhelmingly by the poorer sections of the population.   \n \n4. \nTargeted  Implementation  Arrangements.  In  addition,  targeted  arrangements  during \nthe construction phase are designed to benefit the poor. A first implementation feature is labor \nrecruitment  from  the  project  area.  The  Project  will  disburse  sizable  expenditures  for  skilled, \nsemi-skilled,  and  unskilled  labor.  Unskilled  labor  and  half  of  the  semiskilled  labor  can  be \nrecruited from the project area by incorporating labor recruitment requirements in the contracts. \nThe funds that will be directly injected in the local economy from employment of locally recruited \nlabor would amount to some Tk355 million based on estimates of the number of labor-days of \nskilled, semiskilled, and unskilled labor for road construction and using local labor rates.   \n \n5. \nA second feature is procurement of goods and services from the project area. During the \nconstruction  phase,  the  Project  will  generate  a  considerable  demand  for  goods  and  services \nthat can be purchased in the project area, thereby benefiting the local population. The contract \ndocuments will include provisions to ensure that goods and services are procured in a manner \nthat will benefit local suppliers.   \n \n6. \nA  third  feature  relates  to  gender  equity.  Women  are  expected  to  participate  in  the \nemployment generated by the works. The construction contracts will include provisions ensuring \nthat women employed in road construction activities will receive comparable pay for comparable \nwork. \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nDistribution of Project Benefits Among Road Users \n\nC. \n \n7. \nThe  aim  of  distribution  analysis  is  to  estimate  (i)  the  proportion  of  the  project  benefits \nthat  accrues  to  each  category  of  road  users,  i.e.,  vehicle  owners  or  operators,  passengers, \ncargo owners, farmers and laborers involved in producing the cargo; and (ii) the proportion that  \naccrues  to  poor  people.  More  specifically,  estimation  of  the  distribution  of  the  net  benefits \ninvolves five steps. \n \nIdentifying Beneficiaries and the Non-Poor by Vehicle Type. Vehicles are classified \n8. \ninto  six  categories  for  the  analysis:  (i)  buses;  (ii)  trucks;  (iii)  cars,  utility  vehicles,  motorcycles; \n(iv)  tempos  (auto  rickshaw);  (v)  rickshaws;  (vi)  bicycles.  For  each  category,  potential \nbeneficiaries  can  be  identified,  such  as  bus  owners  and  bus  passengers;  truck  owners, \nbusinessmen, farmers, and laborers; owners of cars, utility vehicles, motorcycles, passengers, \nand  drivers;  tempo  owners,  drivers,  and  passengers;  rickshaw  owners  and  passengers;  and \ncyclists.  Several  of  these  beneficiaries  \uf8e7  bus  owners;  truck  owners;  owners,  passengers  and \ndrivers of cars, utility vehicles, and motorcycles; and tempo owners \uf8e7 can safely be classified \nas  non-poor  without  risk  of  error.    However,  the  benefits  that  accrue  to  them  need  to  be \nestimated and separated out from the total benefits generated by the Project.   \n \n9. \nDistributing  Benefits  Between  Vehicle  Owners  and  Clients.    How  the  benefits  will \naccrue  to  the  vehicle  owners  on  the  one  hand  and  to  the  clients  \uf8e7  i.e.,  passengers,  cargo \nowners, and those involved in producing the cargo \uf8e7 on the other depends on the organization, \nstructure,  and  competitiveness  of  the  local  transport  and  product  markets.  For  buses  (large, \nmicro  and  mini),  tempo  vehicles,  and  rickshaws,  it  is  necessary  to  examine  these  markets  to \ndetermine  how  the  benefits  are  distributed  between  owners  and  passengers.  For  cargo,  it  is \nalso  necessary  to  examine  the  trucking  markets  to  determine  the  distribution  of  benefits \nbetween the parties concerned. For the category of cars, utility vehicles, and motorcycles, 100%  \nof  the  savings  accrue  to  the  non-poor  and  further  investigation  is  not  required.  In  the  case  of \nbicycles, the owner and the user are the same and, hence, it is necessary to examine only the \npoverty status of the rider. \n \nFor buses, there are essentially two segments in the market: (i) the low-cost, regulated \n10. \nsegment; and (ii) the luxury bus segment, which is unregulated. The former represents a major \ntraffic  category  on  the  project  roads,  while  the  latter  does  not.  Bangladesh  Road  Transport \nAuthority  (BRTA)  sets  fares  at  the  national  level,  and  there  are  strong  pressures  from \nfare  had  remained  constant  at \ngovernment \nTk0.32/kilometer  (km)  from  the  1980s  to  the  1990s  and  increased  to  Tk0.47/km  in  2001.  The \nstandard fare at the national level implies cross subsidization between roads featuring low VOC \nand roads with high VOC. The effect of the regime is that it will not be possible to witness fare \nreductions on particular roads as a result of VOC  savings arising from improvements on these \nroads.   \n \n11. \nHowever,  this  regime  does  not  preclude  passing  on  the  bus  passengers  part  of  the \nbenefits of nationwide programs of road improvement. This is possible through a lagging of fare \nincreases  in  response  to  continuing  increases  in  input  costs  (depreciation,  parts,  fuel,  labor, \netc). The impact of delayed fare increases on the real cost of bus transport was examined by \nmodeling the situation that prevailed in Bangladesh during the 1980s and 1990s. The finding is \nthat the lagging effectively provides bus passengers with part of the benefits of nationwide road \nimprovements,  i.e.,  60-70%  of  the  savings  are  passed  on.  Thus,  all  bus  passengers  in  the \nnation benefit from improvements on the project roads while the bus passengers on the project \n\nlow.  The  standard  bus \n\nto  keep \n\nfares \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n49 \n\nroads  benefit  from  all  other  road  improvements  in  the  nation.  Based  on  these  findings  it  was \nassumed that bus passengers will be the beneficiary of 55% of the savings resulting from road \nimprovements. \n \nFor  tempo  vehicles,  the  market  is  essentially  unregulated.  At  the  local  level,  entry  is \n12. \norganized  through  the  owners  associations.  Businessmen  typically  own  3-5  vehicles  that  are \nrented  out  on  a  daily  basis  to  drivers.  Rates  charged  by  the  drivers  vary  according  to  market \nand road conditions. Thus, owners will gain from road improvements through reduced wear and \ntear and reduced maintenance costs. Drivers will gain on account of a potentially higher volume \nof  activity  as  a  result  of  faster  speeds  and  lower  fuel  consumption.  Passengers  will  gain  in \nparticular  because  the  local  markets  on  the  project  roads  are  competitive.  Therefore,  it  is \nestimated  that  80  percent  of  the  savings  to  tempo  vehicles  from  improvements  on  the  project \nroads will accrue to tempo passengers. \n \n13. \nFor rickshaws, the market situation is comparable to that for tempo vehicles.  A rickshaw \nis either owned by a small businessman and rented out on a daily basis to pullers or, to a lesser \nextent,  owned  by  the  puller  or  his  family.  For  most  typical  runs,  there  are  standard  fares  that \ntake  road  conditions  into  account.  Owners  will  gain  from  road  improvements  through  reduced \nwear and tear on vehicles and reduced maintenance costs.  Pullers will gain on account of lower \neffort and faster speeds.  Passengers will gain on account of lower fares and faster speeds. It is \nestimated that 80% of the savings will accrue to passengers. \n \n14. \nAs  regards  cargo,  trucking  markets  are  very  competitive  with  rates  being  negotiated \nbetween  truckers  and  cargo  owners  or  merchants  and  the  outcome  being  related  to  various \nfactors,  the  principal  ones  being  supply  and  demand  and  road  conditions.  However,  the \ndistribution  of \ntruck  owners  and \nbusinessmen/merchants  on  the  one  hand  and  farmers  and  laborers  on  the  other  depends \nlargely on the competitive conditions in the product markets. Thus, knowledge of the nature of \nthe  cargo  movements  and  of  the  product  markets  is  essential.  Detailed  information  on  the \ncommodities  being  transported  in  the  project  regions  was  obtained  through  the  origin-\ndestination survey of a sample of 2,770 trucks. Cargo movements were consolidated in broad \ncategories:  food  grains,  building  materials,  fruits  and  vegetables,  cement,  fertilizer,  coal,  iron \nand steel, sand, jute, edible oil, and general cargo.  \n \n15. \nIn  general,  product  markets  for  the  commodities  concerned  are  relatively  competitive.  \nPrices for agricultural produce are determined mainly by the forces of supply and demand, and \na reduction in VOC will be passed on largely to farmers. This is because at the margin, following \ntransport cost reductions, additional production will become viable and bring about an increase \nin farmgate prices.  Prices for agricultural inputs (e.g., fertilizer) are competitive at the retail level \nwith  the  result  that  a  large  proportion  of  VOC  will  also  be  passed  on  to  farmers.  For  building \nmaterials  a  distinction  needs  to  be  made  between  materials  sourced  within  the  region  (sand, \nbricks,  rock)  and  materials  imported  into  the  region.  For  the  former,  supply  is  from  a  large \nnumber of small producers and demand also comes from a relatively large number of buyers; \nthis allows cost savings to be shared between the two groups. For building materials imported \nwithin the region, there are alternative sources of supply and the retail markets are competitive \nso that a good proportion of the savings will be passed on to the final buyers. For general cargo \n(mainly consumer products of various kinds) retail markets are competitive and a fair proportion \nof the savings will be passed on to consumers. \n \n16. \nInsight into these market conditions allows apportioning the benefits by commodity group \nto  the  various  parties  concerned:  truck  owners,  merchants,  and  businessmen  (who  are  non-\n\nimprovements  between \n\nthe  benefits  of \n\nroad \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\npoor)  on  the  one  hand,  and  farmers,  laborers,  and  consumers  (among  whom  there  are  both \npoor and non-poor) on the other.  When the estimates of the percentages of benefits accruing to \nthe  different  parties  are  weighted  by  the  cargo  volumes  for  each  commodity  group,  it  is  found \nthat on average 46% of the benefits will accrue to truck owners, merchants, and businessmen, \nand 54% to farmers, laborers, and consumers. \n \n17. \nClassification  of  Passengers,  Farmers,  Laborers  and  Consumers  According  to \nPoverty  Status.  Determining  the  poverty  status  of  passengers  involves  two  steps:  (i) \nestablishing a poverty line1 for the area of the project roads; (ii) assessing the proportion whose \nincome is below the poverty line.  Poverty lines in taka per person per month were established \nfor two regions based on the findings of the Household Expenditure and Income Survey (HEIS) \n\u2013 2000 by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS).  \n \n18. \nTo determine the proportion for each of the five categories of passengers whose income \nis  below  or  above  the  poverty  line,  an  extensive  program  of  surveys  of  randomly  selected \npassengers was undertaken on three of the six roads. The average percentage of passengers \nbelow the lower poverty line, below the upper poverty line, and of the nonpoor is shown in Table \nA13.1. \n \n\nTable A13.1: Poverty Status of Road Users,  Average for 3 Roads \n\nRoad User Category \n\n% Non-Poor\n\nBus rider \nTempo rider \nRickshaw rider \nCyclist \nPedestrian \n\n% Below the Lower \nPoverty Line \n40.0 \n30.3 \n49.5 \n55.9 \n60.4 \n\n% Below the Upper \nPoverty Line \n46.9 \n42.6 \n57.9 \n59.6 \n67.3 \n\n53.1 \n57.4 \n42.1 \n40.4 \n32.7 \n\n \nFor  cargo,  the  estimate  of  the  poverty  status  of  farmers/laborers  involved  in  the \n19. \nproduction of the various commodities being transported and of consumers of the general cargo \nwas  based  on  a  review  of  the  socioeconomic  profile  of  the  two  regions  and  their  population, \nincluding  such  factors  as  the  incidence  of  landless  laborers  and  literacy  rates.  For \nfarmers/laborers in both regions, the proportion below the upper poverty line was estimated at \n65%, which is somewhat above the proportion for the population in the region in general.  It was \nestimated that the same proportion is valid for consumers in the project area.   \n \nDistribution  of  Benefits  to  Poor  and  Non-Poor.  This  step  of  the  analysis  involves \n20. \ndistributing the project benefits to non-poor and poor beneficiaries.  For each of the passenger \nvehicle  categories,  this  is  done  by  combining  the  percentages  of  the  first-level  distribution  of \nbenefits (between owners and passengers) with the percentages of the second-level distribution \n(between  poor  and  non-poor).  For  cargo  this  is  done  by  combining  the  proportion  of  savings \naccruing  to  farmers/laborers  and  consumers  on  the  one  hand,  and  the  proportion  of  the  poor \namong  them  on  the  other.  When  these  proportions  are  weighted  by  the  volumes  of  the \ncommodities  being  transported,  an  estimate  is  obtained  of  the  proportion  of  the  total  savings \nthat accrues to people under the poverty line. \n\n                                                 \n1  Poverty line:  the level of per capita income or consumption at which the members of a household can be expected \nto meet their basic food consumption needs i.e., to meet their calorie intake requirements as well as some essential \nnonfood needs. The difference between the lower and upper poverty lines resides in the difference in the allowance \nfor nonfood consumption as the estimates of the cost of basic food needs are the same for both. The lower poverty \nline  incorporates  a  very  minimal  allowance  for  nonfood  goods  while  the  upper  poverty  line  includes  the  typical \nnonfood spending of those who just attained the food requirement. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n51 \n\n21.  When  six  roads  are  combined,  the  proportion  of  poor  is  0%  for  vehicle  owner.  For \npassengers,  the  average  percentage  of  the  poor  (among  those  traveling  by  bus,  tempo, \nrickshaw,  and  bicycle)  is  64%;  and  for  those  involved  in  the  production  (and  consumption)  of \ncargo (farmers, laborers), the proportion of the poor is 64%.  \n \n22. \nCalculating  the  Poverty  Impact  Ratio  (PIR).  Using  the  percentage  of  the  poor  (para. \n22),  the  net  present  value  of  the  Project  is  allocated  to  road  users,  and  then  to  the  poor  and \nnon-poor within each road user group. The results are in Table A13.2 and the key entries are \nelaborated. All amounts are in net present value using a discount rate of 12%.   \n \n23. \nThe amount of Tk7.2 billion in the column Economic Minus Financial are the savings that \naccrue  to  the  different  categories  of  road  users.  In  the  table,  however,  the  savings  are \ndistributed between vehicle owners on one hand and passengers and cargo on the other.    \n \n\nGovernment of Bangladesh.

The \ndifference  between  the  funding  and  the  debt  service  (Tk1.53  billion)  is  the \nsubsidy implicit in the concessional loan terms.   \n\nInvestment and operations & maintenance. The amount of Tk4.44 billion is the \nconstruction  cost,  which  is  matched  by  funding  from  the  Government  and  the \nlenders during the construction period. \n\nLabor.  The  amount  of  Tk437  million  is  the  total  amount  of  (domestic)  labor \nexpenditures. The opportunity cost of this labor is estimated at Tk349 million and \nthe difference is a gain for laborers among whom 59% are estimated to be poor \n(all the unskilled and part of the semiskilled). \n\nGains  and  losses  and  poverty  impact  ratio  (PIR).  The  balance  of  gains  and \nlosses  of  the  various  parties  is  Tk7.01  billion.    Out  of  this  total,  Tk3.71  billion \naccrues to the poor; hence, the PIR is calculated as 0.53. \n\nSensitivity test. A sensitivity test that was conducted by lowering the proportion \nof  the  poor  among  vehicle  passengers  from  64%  to  50%.

However,  this  trend  masks  the  fact  that  poverty  at  40% \nremains much higher in the rural areas than in the urban areas at 15%.  There is considerable \nincome  disparity  across  the  country.    Per  capita  income  is  highest  in  the  urban  centers  of \neconomic activity. In contrast, people living in the project area have per capita income lower than \nthe  national  average.  More  than  50%  of  the  people  in  project  area  \u2013  Rangpur,  Jamalpur, \nNilphamari, Kishoregonj, Mymensingh, Dinajpur, and Thakurgaon \u2013 live below the poverty line. \nThis  Project  will  be  a  poverty  intervention  project,  since  the  proportion  of  the  poor  among  the \nproject  beneficiaries  is  larger  than  their  proportion  in  the  overall  population  of  the  country.  \nPoverty criteria, i.e., districts with a high incidence of poverty, were considered in selecting the \nroad corridors. \n \nThe Project will contribute to poverty reduction in two major ways: by generating income-earning \nopportunities  for  the  poor  and  improving  their  physical  access  to  resources  and  markets.  The \nProject is expected to have a positive impact on the socioeconomic development of the region, \nand  to  provide  immediate  economic  benefits  to  farmers,  merchants,  and  passengers  through \nbetter access to goods and services. The improvement of 174 kilometers of roads will improve \naccess to markets and social facilities. \n \nThrough civil works contracts, the Project will directly generate income-earning opportunities of \n133,000  person-months  for  the  poor  in  the  rural  areas,  the  majority  of  whom  fall  below  the \npoverty line.  \n \n \nB. \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nPoverty  impact  analysis  was  prepared  to  estimate  both  the  percentage  of  the  net  benefits  that  \nwill  reach  the  poor  and  extremely  poor,  as  well  as  the  number  of  poor  who  will  receive  those \nbenefits. Poverty impact analysis (i) assessed the extent to which transport cost reductions will \nbe passed on to passengers and owners of freight, (ii) assessed the distribution of the benefits \nbetween  them  and  other  group,  and  (iii)  identified  the  proportion  of  poor  and  very  poor \nbeneficiaries and the net benefits they will receive. \n \nPoverty impact indicators to measure the consequences of the Project for the beneficiary will be \ndeveloped. These indicators will be part of the system developed to measure and monitor project \nperformance. In general, the indicators will provide information relating to travel time and cost for \ndifferent purposes by different modes of transport, cash crop produced, rural and urban income, \nlabor participation, school attendance, and use of health clinics. \n \n\nProposed Classification: Poverty Intervention \n\nPoverty Analysis  \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n54 \n \n\n \nC. \n\nParticipation Process \n\n \nA participatory approach was adopted in conducting the Technical Assistance. The participatory \nprocess will be implemented by consulting local communities in the project area.  Details of the \nprocess  will  be  based  on  the  final  road  design  and  consultations  will  be  conducted  throughout \nthe  project  cycle  to  ensure  that  local  concerns  and  suggestions  are  taken  fully  into  account. \nLocal  community-based  organizations  will  assist  the  contractors  in  identifying  potential \nrecruitment areas. \n \nThe Project will ensure that the affected people and other stakeholders are informed, consulted, \nand encouraged to participate actively during the implementation of the resettlement plan (RP). \nA  nongovernment  organization  will  be  responsible  for  carrying  out  public  consultation  on  a \ncontinuing  basis  during  the  implementation  of  the  RP.  The  coordinator  of  resettlement  and \nrehabilitation activities in the Environment and Resettlement Circle of the Roads and Highways \nDepartment will be responsible for monitoring this activity. A grievance redress committee (GRC) \nwill  be  established  at  each  project  road  link  when  RP  implementation  starts.  The  GRC  will \ncomprise key stakeholders, including representatives of the affected people and will be chaired \nby the union parishad/ward committee member. \n \n \nD. \n  \n\nSocial Issuesa \n\nSignificant/ \nNon significant/ \nUncertain/ \nNone \nSignificant \n\nResettlementc  \n \n  \n\nGender  \n \n \n\nNot \nSignificant \n\n \nOutput \nPreparedb \n\nFull \n\nNo \n\n \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n \nThe socioeconomic survey showed that the Project \nwill  affect  4,708  structures  and  there  is  a  need  for \nadditional  60  hectares  for  widening  174  km  of \nroads.  Based  on \nthe  40%  sample  survey, \napproximately  10,646  people  will  be  affected.  The \nRoads and Highways Department (RHD) submitted \nan RP to the Asian Development Bank for approval \n(Appendix  15).  The  RP  will  be  updated  before \naward  of  civil  work  contracts  to  inventory  100% \naffected people. \n Gender  concerns  will  be  addressed  by  setting  up \nemployment \nfor  women\u2019s  construction \nactivities.  The  contractors  will  be  required  not  to \ndifferentiate  wages  between  men  and  women  for \nwork  of  equal  value,  not  to  hire  children  as \nconstruction  workers,  and  to  provide  appropriate \nfacilities  for  children  in  construction  campsites.  A \nspecific clause will be included in the bid documents \nand  compliance  strictly  monitored  during  project \nimplementation. \n \nInvolving  women  of  the  community  in  different \nproject activities will ensure women\u2019s participation in \nthe project area.

It  is  expected  that,  with  the \ndevelopment of the roads, the number of passenger \nbuses will increase because of good road condition, \nwhich will facilitate greater mobility of the rural poor \nin the project areas. \nThe  Project  will  have  a  positive  impact  through \nmore employment opportunities in road construction \nfor  skilled  and  unskilled  laborers.  Recruitment  of \nunskilled \nto  provide \nmaximum  benefit  to  the  poor,  particularly  the  most \nrecruitment \ndisadvantaged  group;  and \nthe  bidding \nrequirements  will  be \nspecifications. \nThe  social  assessment  report  indicates  that  tribal \npeople  live  in  one  project  area;  however,  the \nnumber  is  negligible  and  they  are  not  directly \naffected  by  the  Project.  Therefore,  an  indigenous \npeople development plan is not warranted. A follow-\nup  fact-finding  mission  conducted  by  a  social \ndevelopment  specialist  before  the  Management \nReview  Meeting  confirmed  that  the  Project  had  no \nnegative impact on indigenous people, \nThe capacity of RHD to implement and monitor the \nRP  and  incorporate  cross-cutting  social  issues  is \ncritical.

The RP was prepared by Bangladesh Roads \nand  Highways  Department  (RHD)  through  a  consultative  process  with  key  stakeholders, \nparticularly the AP and host communities. \n \nB. \n \nIn 2001, RHD conducted a socioeconomic survey in Rangpur and Dinajpur areas.  The \n2.  \nsurvey  identified  the  potentially  affected  properties  and  categorized  them  as  residential, \ncommercial,  residential-cum-commercial  mixed,  and  agricultural.  Each  property  category  was \nfurther divided into owner, tenant, encroacher, and squatters. The survey found that the Project \nwould  affect  2,018  structures  and  would  need  for  an  additional  60  hectares  in  improving  174 \nkilometers  of  roads.  In  this  sample,  76%  of  the  structures  are  in  commercial  use  and  24%  in \nresidential  use.  Commercial  structures  are  mostly  small  shops  used  by  approximately  60%  \ntenants.  In  the  growth  center  areas,  more  than  50%  of  the  structures  in  commercial  use  are \npucca,1  overall,  only  5%  of  the  structures  are  pucca  and  the  rest  combine  tin  wall  and  roof  or \nbamboo-thatched wall and roof. \n \nC. \n \n3.  \nIn  2001,  a  socioeconomic  survey  was  carried  out  through  interviews  of  1,943  (40%) \nsample  households.  The  total  population  of  the  surveyed  households  was  about  10,129,  an \naverage  of  5.5  persons  per  household.  The  survey  found  that  89.5%  of  the  households  are \nshopkeepers.  The  literacy  rate  of  the  people  in  the  project  area  was  around  39%.  The \nhousehold expenditure and income data indicates that 12% of the sample households earning \nup  to  Tk3,000/per  month  spend  up  to  102%  of  their  income,  indicating  their  indebtedness. \nHouseholds in the income group Tk3,001 and above have considerable savings, indicating their \nrelative prosperity. Considering all income groups, an average household saves up to 29.8% of \nits  income.  Landholding  is  an  indicator  of  relative  poverty  or  prosperity.  In  Bangladesh  a \nminimum landholding of 0.2 hectare indicates a state of absolute poverty. The limitations of the \nRP  could  record  only  marginal  and  upward  landholding  and  no  landless  household  was \nidentified. In the sample areas overall, approximately 40% of the landholdings are small \u2013 0.4-\n1.2 hectares of agricultural land \u2013 followed by marginal landholdings, 31.4%.   \n \nD. \n \n4. \nThe  current  legislation  governing  land  acquisition  for  public  purposes  in  Bangladesh  is \nthe Acquisition and Requisition of Immovable Property Ordinance (Ordinance 11 of 1982) and \nits subsequent amendments in 1993 and 1994. The legal process is initiated by an application \nby  the  requiring  agency  or  department  to  the  deputy  commissioner  (DC)  of  the  District.    In \ndetermining  the  amount  of  compensation  for  affected  owners,  the  DC  considers  a  number  of \nfactors,  e.g.,  present  market  rate  to  determine  the  value  of  the  land.  As  there  is  no  national \npolicy  for  resettlement  of  project-affected  people  in  Bangladesh,  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) policy on involuntary resettlement will be the guideline in this resettlement plan. \n \n\nPolicy Framework and Entitlement Matrix \n\n                                                 \n1  Pucca means permanent structure: floor, wall, and roof made of concrete.  \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n57\n\nThe  project  compensation  policy  and  entitlement  matrix  was  designed  to  cover \n5. \ncompensation  for  lost  assets,  and  restore  or  enhance  the  livelihoods  of  all  categories  (direct, \nindirect, titleholders and non-titleholders) of AP. The AP will not only receive replacement land \nor  cash  for  land  and  other  assets  at  market  price;  many  additional  measures  will  be  adopted, \nsuch as moving allowance, assistance to households headed by females and other vulnerable \ngroups, to help the AP to regain or improve their lives in the postresettlement period.

AP  should  be  able  to  maintain \nand, preferably improve their standard of living and quality of life. AP are defined as those who \nstand to lose, as a consequence of the Project, all or part of physical and nonphysical assets, \nincluding homes, homesteads, productive land, commercial properties, tenancy, income-earning \nopportunities,  social  and  cultural  activities  and  relationships,  and  other  losses  that  may  be \nidentified during the process of resettlement planning. \n \nTo achieve the objective, a full range of mitigation measures is available to help AP to \n6. \novercome  the  potentially  adverse  effects  of  moving  from  the  current  location.  Of  the  2,108 \nhouseholds potentially affected, approximately 10% may have houses and shops displaced for \nall  rights-of-way  in  six  corridors.  All  households  prefer  to  make  their  own  arrangements  for \ntransition  period.  Landless  households, \nresettlement  and  will  be  assisted  during \nnontitleholders,  and  the  ultrapoor  will  be  entitled  to  resettlement  and  income  restoration \nassistance if they have been occupying the affected land for at least 3 years before the census \ncutoff date and do not have title to any other land. It is mandatory that all relocation efforts be \ncompleted  1  month  before  construction  of  the  main  investment  project  starts.  The  Project  will \nprovide  resettlement  and  rehabilitation  (R&R)  allowance.  After  all  compensation  and  other \nentitlements have been delivered, land titles will be transferred from AP to RHD. \n \nF. \n \n7. \nthroughout  project \nimplementation. It will ensure that the affected population and other stakeholders are informed, \nconsulted,  and  allowed  to  participate  actively  during  implementation.  The  nongovernment \norganization  (NGO)  project  manager  at  the  road  link  level  will  be  responsible  for  carrying  out \npublic  consultations  on  a  continuing  basis  during  implementation,  and  the  R&R  coordinator  in \nthe Environment and Resettlement Circle (ERC) of RHD will be responsible for monitoring this \nactivity. The summary of the RP was posted on ADB\u2019s web site. Before implementation of the \nRP, a brochure containing the summary of the RP will be disseminated to the APs. \n \n8. \nA grievance redress committee (GRC) at each project road link will be set up in sufficient \ntime for AP to lodge complaints during the initial determination of compensation. The GRC will \ncomprise  the  road  link  level  project  manager  (NGO  contractor),  a  project  affected  people \nrepresentative, a union parishad member (in rural areas) or ward committee member (in urban \nareas),  and  the  subdivisional  engineer  of  RHD  for  that  project  road  link.  The  union \nparishad/ward  committee  member  will  chair  this  committee.  The  procedures  of  grievance \nredress were developed to determine the qualified beneficiaries living in the project area.   \n \n\nConsultation, Participation, and Grievance Mechanism \n\nto  continue  stakeholder  consultation \n\nThe  Project  proposes \n\n\f60 \n\n \n\nAppendix 15 \n\nMonitoring \n\nCost Estimates \n\nInstitutional Arrangements \n\nG. \n \n9. \nERC  in  RHD,  headed  by  an  executive  engineer,  was  established  under  previous  ADB \nloan to monitor the R&R activities of the road improvement projects. The main tasks of RHD for \nthe  R&R  activities  involve  resettling  and  rehabilitating  the  affected  persons,  or  otherwise \nmitigating  any  negative  social  impacts  related  to  land  acquisition  for  the  road  improvements. \nWhile the Government acquires land for RHD through the deputy commissioner of an affected \ndistrict, RHD is directly responsible for implementing the R&R activities.   \n \nH. \n \n10. \nInternally,  ERC  will  conduct  monthly  internal  monitoring  of  the  progress  of  the  planned \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities.  The  land  acquisition  officer  in  the  office  of  the \ndeputy  commissioner  will  assist  RRC  in  monitoring  the  progress  of  land  acquisition.  The \nexternal monitoring and evaluation agency will be commissioned for annual, midterm, and end-\nterm monitoring and evaluation of these activities. \n \nI. \n \n11. \nAdequate budgetary support is fully committed and will be made available to cover the \ncosts of land acquisition within the agreed upon implementation period. The estimated costs for \nRP  implementation  and  management  amount  to  Tk210  million  (approximately  $3.6  million \nequivalent).  This  is  an  indicative  budget,  which  includes  compensation  for  compensation, \nincome  rehabilitation  and  assistance \nfor  project \nimplementation.  The  revised  RP,  based  on  a  detailed  census,  will  prepare  a  detailed  annual \nbudget specifying timing for the release of funds and will meet resettlement costs in full. \n \nJ. \n \n12. \nConstruction activities will not start until the required lands have been acquired and the \npopulations appropriately relocated in accordance with the objective. All resettlement activities \nwill be coordinated with the civil works and will be completed satisfactorily before awarding the \ncivil works contracts for the pipeline.  At this point in time, it is anticipated that the construction \nworks  will  start  early  in  2004.  Therefore,  the  land  acquisition  activity  is  expected  to  be \ncompleted by the end of 2003. \n \n \n \n\nto  vulnerable  groups,  and  support \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 16 \n\n  61\n\nSUMMARY ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS \n\n  Introduction \n\nA. \n \nThe proposed Road Network Improvement and Maintenance Project is categorized as a \n1. \nB project in the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Environmental Assessment Requirements. \nAn  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was  prepared.  This  appendix  is  based  on  the \ninformation  in  the  IEE  and  the  summary  IEE  reports  that  were  undertaken  under  the  project \npreparatory technical assistance.1 \n \nB. \n \nThe  proposed  Project  will  involve  reconstructing  existing  roads  to  higher  standards  by \n2. \nwidening,  adjusting  the  alignment,  and  other  improvements  (e.g.,  lane  marking,  cross  walk, \nsigns  and  safety  features).  The  six  project  roads  are  located  in  the  northern  central  and  north \nwestern part of Bangladesh. The summary of the project description for the six project roads is \nin Table A16. \n \n\nDescription of the Project \n\nTable A16:  Summary of the Project Description \n\nDivision \n\nFrom \n\nTo \n\nRangpur \n\nSaidpur \n\nParbatipur \n\nTotal Length \n(km) \n15 \n\nRangpur \nThakurgaon \nMymensingh/ \n     Kishoreganj \nMymensingh \nJamalpur \n\nthe roadsides \n\nMithapukur \nThakurgaon \nMymensingh \n\nMadhyapara \nRanisankail \nNandail \n\nMuktagacha \nJamalpur \n\nChechua \nDewanganj \n\n24 \n37 \n47 \n\n10 \n41 \n\nProposed Action Under the \nProject a \nWidening from 7.5 to 10.4 meters \n(m) \nWidening from 8.5 to 10.4 m \nWidening from 7.1 to 8.6 m \nWidening from 9.1 to 12.2 m \n\nWidening from 7.9 to 11.4 m \nWidening from 6.2 to 8.6 m \n\n     a    All  project  roads  involve  increasing  embankment  height,  improving  drainage  structures,  and  planting  trees  on              \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\n \nC. \n \nThe six projects are administratively located within Rangpur and Thakurgaon districts of \n3. \nRangpur  Division;  and  Jamalpur,  Kishoreganj,  and  Mymensingh  districts  of  Mymensingh \nDivision. The environmental condition of the project area is summarized as follows: \n   \n\nSaidpur-Parbatipur road. This project road is in Rangpur District. The area \nis  topographically  flat.  The  soil  is  predominantly  floodplain  soil.  The  Tista \nRiver  skirts  the  northeast  boundary  of  Rangpur  District  in  northwest-\nsoutheast  direction.  The  district  is  subject  to  periodic  rainwater  flood  and \nabove average floods. The road passes mainly agricultural land. This area is \nnot rich in flora or fauna. Homestead trees are scattered on both sides of the \nroad along 15 kilometers (km). About 2,850 trees are located 15 meters (m) \nfrom the centerline of the road. No wildlife is found in the project area. \n\nMithapukur-Madhyapara  road.  This  project  road,  also  located  in  Rangpur \nDistrict,  has  a  flat  area.  The  soil  is  dominantly  sandy  and  clay  loams.  This \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2000.

Homestead trees are found along the 24 km road. However, only about \n950  trees  are  within  15  m  from  the  centerline.  The  last  0.5  km  of  the  road \ncrosses a forest area.  \n\nroad  crosses \n\nfloods.  The \n\n(iii) \n\nThakurgaon-Ranisankail road. This project road in Thakurgaon District has \na flat area. The soil is predominantly non-calcareous. The road crosses two \nrivers (Tangon and Vakti) and there are some small streams in the area. The \n37  km  road  crosses  mainly  agricultural  fields.  A  considerable  number  of \nhomestead trees are along the road. About 5,060 trees are within 15 m from \nthe centerline of the road. \n\n(iv)  Mymensingh-Nandail  road.  This  road  is  located  in  Kishoreganj  and \nMymensingh  districts.  The  project  area  is  flat.  Both  Kishoreganj  and \nMymensingh  lands  are  classified  as  lowland  part  of  the  Meghna  River \nfloodplain.  The  project  area  is  not  flood-prone,  but  sometimes  experiences \nmoderate  flooding  due  to  high  intensity  of  rainfall.  The  road  crosses \nagricultural lands, ponds, and homestead trees. About 8,500 trees are within \n15 m from the centerline of the road. During the flood season, a wide variety \nof  birds  and  aquatic  fauna  are  found  in  the  project  area.  Fish  production  is \nalso high. \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nMuktagacha-Chechua  road.  This  project  road  is  Mymensingh  District.  The  \narea  is  flat.  The  soil  characteristic  is  predominantly  old  alluvium.  The  old \nBrahmapuna  River  dominates \nthe  hydrology  of  Mymensingh  District. \nHowever,  the  road  area  is  flood  free.  Considerable  numbers  of  homestead \nand  roadside  trees  are  on  both  sides  of  the  road.  About  1,690  different \nspecies  of  trees  are  found  within  15  m  from  the  centerline  of  the  road.  The \nfauna species are limited.   \n\nJamalpur-Dewanganj  road.  This  project  road  is  in  Jamalpur  District.  The \narea  is  flat  and  is  also  classified  as  lowland.  River  erosion  and  flooding  are \nsignificant  concerns  in  this  area.  The  road  passes  agricultural  fields,  and \nhomesteads are on the sides of the road. About 11,580 trees are within 15 m \nfrom the road centerline. Wildlife such as dolphins, snakes, and aquatic birds \nare often found during floods.   \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n \nD. \n \nThe six roads will have no significant environmental impact because the Project will be \n4. \nexecuted only on the existing roads, none of which are in environmentally sensitive areas. The \nenvironmental impacts associated with the construction stage will include (i) disruption of traffic \nin  the  construction  area;  (ii)  increased  air  pollution  due  to  increasing  dust  and  other  volatile \nchemical  substance  from  asphalt  plants;  (iii)  noise  and  vibration;  (iv)  disruption  of  the  water \nsystem  due  to  cut-and-fill  and  other  earthworks;  and  (v)  potential  landslides  associated  with \nelevating some part of the road. All these impacts will occur only during the construction period. \nMitigation  measures  will  be  adopted  to  minimize  the  impacts:  (i)  reroute  the  traffic  with  clear \nsigns;  (ii)  maintain  optimum  moisture  content  during  handling  of  soil,  spray  water  to  minimize \ndust,  and  maintain  a  safe  distance  between  the  asphalt  plant  and  public  facilities  including \neducation facilities; (iii) strictly control the construction works that create noise and vibration by \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 16 \n\n  63\n\nprohibiting night work in the residential areas; (iv) provide for pumping of stagnant water and an \nadequate drainage system; and (v) stabilize road embankment side slopes,  restrict construction \nin flood areas to only the dry season, and avoid road widening at pond sites. All these mitigation \nrequirements  will  be  included  in  the  contract  documents  for  the  contractor.  Clearly,  all  the \nimpacts  are  temporary  and  manageable.  The  environmental  impact  associated  with  the \noperation of the Project is mainly on traffic safety; therefore, adequate traffic signs and physical \nbarriers  to  reduce  motorist  speed  will  be  installed.  The  other  important  environmental  impact \nthat  will  not  concentrate  in  the  road  areas  is  borrow  pits  excavation.  In  this  context,  strictly \nborrow pits operation will be adopted (e.g. restrict borrow pits in the fertile agriculture lands and \nareas prone to erosion and landslide, restore and rehabilitate  former borrow pit areas). \n\nInstitutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program \n\nE. \n \n5. \nInstitutional  Framework  and  Responsibility.  The  contractor  will  be  responsible  for \nimplementing  mitigation  measures  during  the  construction  stage.  An  environmental  engineer, \nwho  will  be  hired  as  part  of  the  consulting  team  for  implementing  the  Project,  will  assist  the \nSocial and Environmental Circle (SEC) of RHD in preparing contractual documentation so that \nthe  bidding  documents,  bills  of  quantity,  and  other  contractual  obligations  of  the  contractor \nclearly  identify  environmental  responsibilities  and  describe  penalties  for  noncompliance.  RHD \nand  its  SEC  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  overall  environmental  monitoring  and \nmanagement. \n \n6. \nEnvironmental Monitoring and Management Plan. The IEE has identified the generic \nmonitoring  and  management  program,  that  will  be  part  of  the  mitigation  of  adverse  impacts.  \nDetailed  monitoring  and  management  for  each  road  will  be  prepared  during  the  detailed \nengineering work being carried out under an ongoing project. \n  \nF. \n \n7. \nThe  IEE  shows  that  environmental  impacts  associated  with  the  proposed  Project  are \nmanageable and can be mitigated. In addition, the Project will not disturb any environmentally \nsensitive  areas.  Therefore,  a  full  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  is  not  required. \nHowever,  one  of  the  project  roads,  Mymensingh-Nandail  road,  falls  under  the  red  category  \naccording to Bangladesh\u2019s Environmental Preservation Rules 1997. Civil works for this project \nroad  can  be  started  only  after  the  Department  of  Environment  issues  an  environmental \nclearance  based  on  a  full  EIA.  Conducting  the  full  EIA  requires  detailed  information  about \nengineering design. In view of this, the EIA for the Mymensingh-Nandail road will be prepared \nas part of detailed engineering design.       \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\nG. \n\nConclusion \n\n8. \nThe Project will improve roads that are currently in place. The overall IEE finding is that \nthe  Project  will  not  cause  any  significant  environmental  problem  and  any  potential  adverse \nimpacts are manageable.  However, continued monitoring will be carried out. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 31 August 2002) \n", "Currency Unit   \nTk1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "taka (Tk) \n$0.02 \nTk57.85 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "Asian Development Bank \nAsian Development Fund \nannual road maintenance plan \nBangladesh Road Transport Authority \nBangladesh Road Transport Corporation \ncompressed natural gas \nDepartment for International Development (UK) \ndeveloping member country \nDepartment of Environment \nenvironmental impact assessment \neconomic internal rate of return \ngross domestic product \nHighway Design and Maintenance Standards Model \ninitial environmental examination \nMinistry of Communication \nnongovernment organization \nNational Road Safety Council \nOrganization of Petroleum-Exporting Countries Fund for \nInternational Development \nRoad Design and Safety Circle \nRoads and Highways Department \nSocial and Environmental Circle \ntechnical assistance \nvehicle operating cost \n", "\u2013 \n \nADB \n\u2013 \nADF \n \n\u2013 \nARMP   \n\u2013 \nBRTA   \n\u2013 \nBRTC   \n\u2013 \n \nCNG \n\u2013 \n \nDFID \n\u2013 \n \nDMC \n\u2013 \n \nDOE \n\u2013 \n \nEIA \n\u2013 \n \nEIRR \n\u2013 \n \nGDP \n\u2013 \n \nHDM \n\u2013 \n \nIEE \n\u2013 \nMOC \n \n\u2013 \n \nNGO \nNRSC   \n\u2013 \nOPEC Fund  \u2013 \n", " \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "RDSC   \nRHD \n \nSEC \nTA \nVOC \n \n", " \n", " \n(i) \n", "(ii) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government and its agencies ends on 30 \nJune.
