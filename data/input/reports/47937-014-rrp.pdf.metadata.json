A more secure and sustainable future for Indonesia is \n2. \ncontingent  on  increased  access  to  clean  energy.  The  country  demonstrated  strong  economic \nperformance  throughout  the  global  recession,  with  annual  gross  domestic  product  growth \naveraging 6% during 2009\u20132012.2 If this growth continues, demand for electricity is projected to \nrise  by  more  than  8%  per  annum  until  2029.  Since  Indonesia  currently  uses  coal  and  oil  to \nproduce  65%  of  its  electricity  and  fuel  its  economic  growth,  a  failure  to  diversify  into  cleaner \nenergy sources for power generation will magnify the country\u2019s reliance on fossil fuels, constrain \nits ability to meet rising electricity demand, increase its contribution to global greenhouse gases \n(GHGs), and heighten exposure to commodity risk. \n \n3. \nThe Government of Indonesia recognizes the economic imperative of sustainable growth \nand aims to increase the share of renewable energy in the country\u2019s primary energy supply from \n5%  in  2010  to  25%  by  2025  and  achieve  a  reduction  in  GHG  emissions  of  41%  by  2020.3 \nIndonesia  is  endowed  with  several  renewable  energy  options  that  can  help  achieve  these \ntargets,  including  wind,  solar,  geothermal,  and  biomass.  However,  geothermal  energy  is \nparticularly suited to support Indonesia\u2019s more sustainable future: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nGeothermal  power  comes  from  thermal  energy  that  is  naturally  generated  in  the  earth \nand most accessible and abundant near tectonic plate boundaries.4 Due to its location at \nthe edge of the Pacific plate, Indonesia has over 29,000 megawatts (MW) of geothermal \nresources, which is equivalent to 40% of the global geothermal resource base.5  \nGeothermal power plants are reliable and demonstrate high capacity factors. Therefore, \nthey  can  contribute  a  sizable  portion  of  base-load  power,  unlike  intermittent  renewable \nenergy sources such as wind or solar, and contribute to a more secure energy mix. \nGeothermal power plants typically emit less than 10% of the GHG emitted by fossil fuel \nthermal  plants,  and  thereby  provide  an  effective  means  for  Indonesia  to  achieve  both \ndomestic and international climate change mitigation objectives.  \nPower generation costs of large geothermal power plants in Java and Sumatra are less \nthan the country\u2019s average power generation cost. Geothermal sector development can \ntherefore  help  improve  the  long-term  financial  health  of  Perusahaan  Listrik  Negara \n(PLN), the national electricity utility, while reducing Indonesia\u2019s reliance on fossil fuels.6 \n\n                                                \n1 The ADB Clean Technology Fund is financed by the Clean Technology Fund and administered by ADB. \n2 Bank of Indonesia. 2013.

Jakarta.  \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nIndonesia has a geothermal project pipeline of 3,200 MW, which accounts for 24% of the \n4. \ncapacity  of  geothermal  projects  now  planned  globally. 7  Despite  the  compelling  opportunity \npresented by untapped geothermal resources, less than 5.0% of the country\u2019s total geothermal \npotential  has  been  developed.  Indonesian  geothermal  regulation  has  substantially  improved \nsince 2003, but translating the immense geothermal opportunity into reality is challenging due to \nthe risks of proving and managing the geothermal resource. The investment needed to develop \nthe country\u2019s full geothermal potential will only materialize when actual and perceived risks are \ndecoupled  and  reduced  through  the  successful  financing,  implementation,  and  operation  of \nprojects with the demonstrative capacity to initiate market transformation. \n \n5. \nRecent  sector  development.  The  Asian  Development  Bank (ADB)  involvement  in the \n320  MW  Sarulla  Geothermal  Power  Development  Project  has  placed  ADB  at  the  forefront  of \naccelerating  private  sector  investment  in  geothermal  development  in  Indonesia.8 The  Sarulla \nproject  is  the  first  large-scale,  private  geothermal  project  to  be  commercially  financed  in \nIndonesia in over 10 years. Nonetheless, for landmark projects like Sarulla to achieve their full \ndemonstration  impact,  more  projects  must  overcome  critical  bottlenecks  in  the  geothermal \nproject pipeline further upstream. The highest level of risk for a geothermal developer is during \nearly  project  development  and  exploration,  when  the  renewable  energy  resource  has  not  yet \nbeen  proven.  Experienced  developers  in  Indonesia  are  challenged  to  justify  their  investments \nwhen faced with full exposure to the high upfront costs of a drilling program and the inequitable \nrisk\u2013reward  framework  in  the  geothermal  sector. 9  The  lack  of  an  early-stage  risk  sharing \nmechanism remains a fundamental  obstacle  to geothermal  power  expansion  in Indonesia and \naround the world. For ADB to effectively kick-start the Indonesian geothermal sector, it must not \nonly facilitate the availability of long-term commercial financing, but also clear the way for new \nproject development by initially sharing and mitigating some development risk.  \n \n6. \nClean Technology Fund. As one of the four windows under the $8 billion global Climate \nInvestment  Funds,  the  Clean  Technology  Fund  (CTF)  is  a  major  partner  in  ADB\u2019s  efforts  to \nmitigate  GHG  emissions  and  accelerate  geothermal  development  in  Indonesia. 10  CTF  was \nestablished in 2008 and promotes financing for the deployment of low-carbon technologies with \nsignificant potential for long-term reduction of GHG emissions through projects implemented by \nthe multilateral development banks. ADB is one of five multilateral development banks endorsed \nby the bilateral financing partners that contribute funds to the CTF.  \n \n7. \n The  proposed  project  will  be  ADB\u2019s  second  loan  from  the  $150  million  ADB  Private \nSector Geothermal Energy Program, which was approved and endorsed by the CTF trust fund \ncommittee  in  2013.11 The  program  specifically  seeks  to  share  a  portion  of  the  upfront  risks  of \n\n                                                \n7  Bloomberg  New  Energy  Finance.  2013.

Sarulla  Geothermal  Power  Development \nProject in Indonesia. Manila. \n\n9  Due to drilling programs, capital costs for geothermal plants can be more than three times those for conventional \nfossil fuel plants. In addition, future development of the geothermal market is unlikely to benefit from  the dramatic, \ntechnology-driven  cost  reductions  that  have  recently  occurred  in  the  solar,  wind,  and  natural  gas  sectors.  See \nGeothermal Overview (accessible from the list of supplementary linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n10 ADB. 2009. Establishment of the ADB Clean Technology Fund and the ADB Strategic Climate Fund. Manila. \n11 The trust fund committee approved the program pursuant to the Financial Procedures Agreement entered into  by \nADB and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development  (as trustee of the trust fund for CTF) on 18 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\ngeothermal drilling and exploration faced by private developers. Under the program framework, \nADB selects a set of private sector subprojects according to CTF investment principles, program \ncriteria, and minimum loan terms and conditions approved by the trust fund committee.  \n \nThe relatively high risks of the early-stage loan product were explained to the committee \n8. \nwhen  ADB  sought  program  approval,  and  the  minimum  terms  and  conditions  of  this  loan \nproduct  have  been  endorsed. While  concessional  CTF funds have traditionally  been  deployed \nas parallel  project finance  loans, the  CTF mandates the  implementing  agencies to identify the \nmost  effective  structures  to  mitigate key  sector  risks,  pilot-test  alternative financing modalities, \nand  disseminate  project  lessons,  all  while  maximizing  the  leverage  of  other  investors  and \nlenders.  By  filling  the  financing  gap  and  galvanizing  activity  further  upstream,  the  proposed \nassistance will demonstrate the viability of geothermal resources in Indonesia and increase the \nlikelihood of attracting the commercial investment required for the geothermal sector expansion. \n\n2. \n\nProject Design  \n\nThe proposed 240 MW Rantau Dedap Geothermal Development Project (Phase 1) is an \n9. \nideal  opportunity  for  ADB  and  CTF  to  play  an  instrumental  role  in  developing  the  next \ngeneration of greenfield geothermal projects in Indonesia through pilot-testing of an innovative, \nearly-stage  financing  product.  The  project  is  located  about  225  kilometers  southwest  of \nPalembang  in South  Sumatera,  Indonesia.  Phase  1  constitutes the  initial geothermal resource \nexploration, involving the drilling of five wells to better ascertain steam reservoir characteristics \nand  capacity.  A  separate  Phase  2  project  will  follow  to  complete  drilling  of  production  and \ninjection  wells,  and  power  plant  construction.  Phase  2  will  be  financed  through  a  traditional \nlimited-recourse, long-term financing structure. \n \n10. \nThe project has been prioritized under PLN\u2019s long-term power development plan and the \nsecond  10,000  MW  accelerated  development  program  launched  by  the  Government  of \nIndonesia  in  2010  (Fast  Track  Program  2).  Phase  1  development  has  commenced  under  the \nframework of a 35-year geothermal mining license, a 30-year power purchase agreement (PPA) \nwith PLN, and an approximately 20-year guarantee from the Ministry of Finance, as stipulated \nunder a business viability guarantee letter (BVGL) signed in 2012. Overall, the project benefits \nfrom  strong  contractual  arrangements  with  creditworthy  parties  such  as  the  Government  of \nIndonesia,  rated  BB+  by  Standard  &  Poor\u2019s  and  Baa3  by  Moody\u2019s,  and  PLN,  rated  BB  by \nStandard and Poor\u2019s and Baa3 by Moody\u2019s. \n\n3. \n\nThe Borrower and Sponsors \n\n11. \nThe borrower, Supreme Energy Rantau Dedap, is a special-purpose vehicle established \nin Indonesia to explore and develop steam resources, and to construct, operate, and maintain \nthe  power  plant  and  facilities.  The  shareholders  of  the  borrower  are  GDF  Suez  Energy  Asia \nTurkey  and  Southern  Africa,  Axia  Power  Holdings,  and  Supreme  Energy  Sriwijaya.

The project is consistent with the ADB Energy \nPolicy support for renewable energy.18 Although ADB reached its internal goal of $2 billion per \nannum  in clean  energy  in  2011, the  project  helps  sustain that  level  of  investment  in 2014  and \nfurther bolsters the private sector role in catalyzing additional resources for renewable energy. \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n\nD. \n\n16. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \nTable 4 summarizes the implementation arrangements.19 \n\nAspects \nRegulatory \nframework  \nManagement  \n \n\nImplementation \nperiod \nConstruction \nand drilling \narrangements \n   \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \nThe project is to be developed under Fast Track Program 2, and the concession was awarded to \nthe sponsors through a competitive tendering process run by the national electricity utility in 2010. \nGDF Suez, Marubeni Corporation, and Supreme Energy have formed a consortium that represents \na  15-year  track  record  in  Indonesian  geothermal  power  development  and  generation,  and  broad \nexperience developing and operating over 120,000 megawatts in global power generation assets. \nThe Phase 1 exploration program consists of initial civil works and the drilling and testing of up to \nseven wells.  \nThe initial construction work (upgrade and widening of existing roads, new access road, well pads \nfor  drilling  works,  water  supply  system,  and  camp  accommodations)  will  be  managed  through  a \ncivil works contract undertaken by a wholly owned subsidiary of Leighton Holdings (Australia), one \nof  Asia\u2019s  largest  contractors  with  a  50-year  track  record  in  civil  engineering  and  construction. \nAECOM (US), another leader in design and construction, will provide the engineering services.  \nThe  main  drilling  program  will  be  managed  through  standard  drilling  and  day-rate  rig  service \ncontracts with two  experienced and  reputable drilling contractors in Indonesia.  DATI, a partner of \nParker Drilling (US), a leading provider of contract drilling and drilling-related services, will serve as \nthe drilling rig contractor. Halliburton (US), one of the world's largest oil field services companies, \nwill be the drilling service contractor implementing the cementing and directional drilling of wells.  \n\n \n\n                                                \n14  The  finance++  approach  enhances  ADB  financing  by  (i)  leveraging  resources  through  partnerships  and \n\n(ii) providing knowledge to developing member countries to maximize development effectiveness. \n\n15 ADB. 2012.

However,  the \ncurrent Phase 1 financing will not directly benefit from any project revenues. \nThe borrower will submit the following to Asian Development Bank: (i) quarterly unaudited financial \nstatements  and  annual  audited  financial  statements,  (ii)  semi-annual  environmental  and  social \nmonitoring reports, and (iii) semi-annual development effectiveness reports.  \n\nSource: Supreme Energy Rantau Dedap. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\n \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions  \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nimpacts \n\nEnvironmental  and  social  safeguards.  In  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \n18. \nStatement (2009), the project is classified category B for environmental impact, category A for \ninvoluntary resettlement, and category B for indigenous peoples. 20 The potential environmental \nand  social  impacts  of  the  project  have  been  identified  and  effective  measures  to  avoid, \nminimize,  mitigate,  and  compensate  for  the  adverse  impacts  have  been  incorporated  in  the \nsafeguard  reports  and  plans.  The  institutional  capacity  and  commitment  of  the  borrower  to \nmanage  the  project\u2019s  social  and  environmental  impacts  are  deemed  adequate.  Information \ndisclosure and consultations with stakeholders and affected communities have been conducted \nin accordance with ADB requirements. \n \n19.  While the project is located in a forest area, it is unlikely that short-term exploration will \ncause  significant  adverse  environmental \nirreversible,  diverse,  or \nunprecedented. No environmentally sensitive areas have been identified. Nonetheless, ADB is \nworking with the borrower to ensure that habitat values are protected during Phase 1 and better-\ntargeted  baseline  biodiversity  surveys  are  initiated  for  a  robust  environmental  impact \nassessment for Phase 2. Project impacts mainly arise from access roads, facilities, and well pad \nconstruction. To that end, road crossings have been constructed to ensure  that river flows are \nmaintained  and  erosion  and  sediment  impacts  are  minimized.  Plans  to  rehabilitate  and \nrevegetate disturbed areas at the completion of the exploration phase are in place. Impacts from \ndrilling operations and vehicles are insignificant. Due diligence confirmed that the borrower has \na  comprehensive  health,  safety,  and  environmental  management  system  and  plans  in  place \n(including identification of company and contractor roles and responsibilities). Furthermore, the \nborrower demonstrated active incident reporting and corrective action.  \n \nThe  land  acquisition  for  the  108.5  hectares  of  land  required  for  Phase  1  has  been \n20. \ncompleted  through  negotiated  settlements.  An  audit  of  the  land  acquisition  process  and \ncompliance  with  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  requirements  on  involuntary  resettlement  and \nimpacts on indigenous peoples was carried out. The audit confirmed that all 153 project-affected \n                                                \n20 The Initial Environmental Examination was disclosed on the ADB website in May 2014 and the Social Safeguards \n\nthat  are \n\nCompliance Audit Report and Corrective Action Plan was disclosed on the ADB website in April 2014. \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\nhouseholds  have  been  compensated  based  on  the  negotiated  compensation  rates  for  land, \ncrops,  assets,  and  structures.  About  80%  of  the  population  in  the  project  area  belongs  to  the \nSemendo  ethnic  group,  and  the  borrower  has  taken  up  the  implementation  of  an  integrated \nsocial  development  program  to  manage  the  adverse  impacts  on  Semendo  community  and  to \ncarry out developmental activities in the area. The audit confirms that the land identified for the \nproject is neither traditional land nor land with customary rights. The Semendo community fully \nsupports  the  project  and  is  anticipating  benefits  from  the  project  through  social  programs  and \nemployment. Corrective actions have been determined and agreed upon with the borrower.  \n \n21. \nOther  social  dimensions.  An  assessment  of  existing  operations,  human  resource \npolicies,  and  current  procedures  for  labor  procurement  and  management  has  confirmed  that \npolicies conform to national labor laws and regulations on the protection of rights and interest of \nwomen. The borrower requires its contractors to engage local labor, including women. ADB will \nensure  that  loan  documentation  includes  provisions  requiring  the  borrower  to  comply  with \nnational  labor  laws  and,  in  addition,  to  take  specific  measures  (including  in  relation  to \ncontractors) in line with internationally recognized core labor standards and in compliance with \nADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy.21 \n\nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy   \n\nThe sponsors  and the  borrower  were  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \n22. \namended to date), and policy relating to the Combating of Money Laundering and the Financing \nof Terrorism (2003).22 Consistent  with its  commitment to good governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency,  ADB  requires  the  borrower  to  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with  internal \nprocedures  and  controls  following  international  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of \npreventing  corruption  and  money-laundering  activities  and  the  financing  of  terrorism;  and  to \ncovenant with ADB to refrain from engaging in such activities.   \n\nC. \n\nInvestment Limitations  \n\n23. \nThe proposed loan will not count toward the medium-term, country, industry, group, and \nsingle-project  exposure  limits  for  nonsovereign  investments,  as  it  will  be  funded  by  CTF \nresources, not ADB ordinary capital resources.  \n\nD. \n\nAssurances \n\nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \n24. \nGovernment of Indonesia\u2018s no objection to the proposed assistance to Supreme Energy Rantau \nDedap  will  be  obtained.  ADB  will  enter  into  suitable  finance  documentation,  in  form  and \nsubstance  satisfactory  to  ADB,  following  approval  of  the  proposed  assistance  by  the  Board  of \nDirectors. \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n25. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the administration by \nADB  of  a  loan  up  to  $50,000,000  to  be  provided  by  the  ADB  Clean  Technology  Fund  to \n\n                                                \n21 ADB. 2003.
