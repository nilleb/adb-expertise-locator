THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Fujian Farmland Sustainable Utilization and \nDemonstration Project.1 \n \n2.  The  project  will  improve  rural  farmland  infrastructure  and  demonstrate  sustainable \nfarming practices in 13 project counties of Fujian Province to reduce land and environmental \ndegradation.2 Sustainable farming  systems  simultaneously  maintain  agricultural  productivity; \nenhance the natural environment; promote more efficient use of key inputs, including water, \ncrop nutrients, pesticides, energy, land, and labor; and contribute to better ecosystem services.3  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale  \n \n3.  Agriculture  development  has  increased  productivity  yet  caused  high  levels  of  land \ndegradation. In the PRC, 70%-80% of croplands, forestlands, and grasslands are degraded.4 \nMajor problems are water and wind erosion of soils, reduced soil fertility, over-exploited water \nresources, nonpoint source pollution, and deforestation. Driven by inefficient irrigation, overuse \nof chemical fertilizers and pesticides, improper waste treatment, and poor land use practices, \nland degradation is now the most limiting factor to agriculture production and poses a serious \nthreat  to  food  security,  rural  livelihoods,  and  rural  economic  growth.  Reduced  agriculture \nproductivity due to land degradation was $37.09 billion in the PRC or about 1% of the gross \ndomestic product in 2007 (footnote 4). Yet land degradation can be prevented and reversed with \nsoil conditions improved and productivity restored. The cost of reversing land degradation and \napplying sustainable land management practices is considerably lower than the loss caused by \nland degradation.  \n \n4.  In  line  with  this  approach,  the  National  Agricultural  Sustainable  Development  Plan, \n2015\u20132030 focuses on tackling the major causes of degradation and promoting sustainable land \nand resource use.5 Key targets are to reduce chemical fertilizer and pesticide use, improve soil \nhealth, control soil erosion, and promote ecological, featured, and high-efficiency agriculture \nbased on high-quality products and production systems. To achieve these targets, the focus is \non investment in (i) water and soil resource protection,6 (ii) agricultural and rural environmental \ncontrol,7 and (iii) ecological rehabilitation. To implement this plan, the government will pilot and \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The 13 project counties are Wuyishan, Guangze, Datian, Youxi, Ninghua, Yongding, Xinluo, Pinghe, Zhangpu \n(Hua'an),  Jiaocheng,  Zherong,  Dongqiao,  and  Fu'an.  These  counties  were  selected  based  on  demand  for \nsustainable agriculture practices and poverty alleviation priority counties. The selection criteria and process are \nsummarized in Annex 2 of the project administration manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n3  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for the Fujian Farmland \nSustainable Utilization and Demonstration Project (TA 8741-PRC). \n4  X.

Fujian Province has been designated as a priority province. \n \n5.  Fujian Province is mostly mountainous and supports an agrarian rural economy that \naccounts for 75.9% of the output of the primary sector and supports 39.2% of the total provincial \npopulation (14.81 million people living in rural areas).8 Because of the topography, agriculture \nproduces either perennial tree crops on sloping land or annual crops grown in the valley floor, \nsuch as tea, tea oil, pomelo, rice, Chinese pearl barley, and lotus.9 The difficult terrain and poor \nland  management  practices  have  caused  widespread  land  and  environmental  degradation, \nwhich is further exacerbated by  a changing climate and extreme weather conditions. This \nmakes agricultural production and rural livelihoods difficult to sustain. Per capita income in the \nrural areas of Fujian is CNY11,184, or only 36.3% of urban per capita income (CNY30,816)\u2014\nthe rural\u2013urban disparity. Farmers need additional support to have a viable livelihood option \nbased on sustainable agriculture rather than turn to urban migration for an alternative livelihood. \nAs a leading province for ecological civilization, Fujian is required to manage its environment, \nsafeguard  ecological  security,  adapt  to  climate  change,  improve  resource  conservation, \nundertake environmentally friendly development, and use and manage more sustainably land, \nwater, and other natural resources to provide sustainable livelihood opportunities.10  \n6.  Land degradation. Land resources in Fujian Province are limited, allowing an average \nof 0.058 hectares (0.88 mu) of farmland per rural person, which is only about 65% of the \nnational average.11 Moreover, the land is typically of poor quality and low crop productivity\u2014\n78.1% of the province\u2019s arable land is rated as low to medium quality because of poor soil \nhealth, high rates of soil erosion, and outdated agricultural infrastructure, all of which constrains \nproduction. The infrastructure also has low resilience to natural disasters. The narrow dirt roads \nare not suited for motorized agricultural traffic and are inaccessible during the rainy season. \nIrrigation systems are generally old, made of earthen channels and ditches that are dilapidated \nby sedimentation or otherwise in disrepair, resulting in low irrigation efficiency of about 40%, \nlower than the national average. Effective irrigation in the dry season and drainage in the wet \nseason is not possible. Efficient and productive water use would require rehabilitation and \nmodernization of irrigation and drainage infrastructure. The soils erode easily, especially when \ncoupled with poor land management practices and infrastructure as well as seasonal high-\nintensity rainfall. Loss of soil resources, reduced fertility, and poor soil condition make remedial \nactions imperative. These include proper field design with terraces, and irrigation and drainage \ncanals to minimize erosion, and the application of organic matter and fertilizers to restore soil \nhealth, which in turn will restore degraded land resources and increase productivity. \n7.  Polluting  and  unproductive  cropping  systems.  Inefficient  water  use,  overuse  of \nchemical fertilizers and pesticides, and lack of capacity among farmers are the main constraints \nto crop productivity. In 2013, total fertilizer and pesticide application per unit area in Fujian \nProvince was 4.13 million tons, 15% higher than the national average.12 Limited guidance on \n                                                \n8   National Bureau of Statistics of China. National Data. http://data.stats.gov.cn/easyquery.htm?cn=E0103 (accessed \n31 August 2016).The province\u2019s gross domestic product was CNY2,405.58 billion in 2014; the primary sector\u2019s \ncontribution was 8.38% (CNY201.48 billion), to which the agriculture sector contributed CNY152.96 billion.  \n9  Fujian Province is the biggest tea producer in the PRC, contributing 18.5% to national production. Tea production \nreached 347,000 tons in 2013, involving 10% of the provincial population. \n10 According to the PRC government, \u201cecological civilization\u201d refers to achieving harmony between growth, people, \nand nature, requiring people to respect, protect, and maintain a harmonious relationship with nature. It includes \nactivities to mitigate ecological damage, relieve pressures on natural resources, and improve the balance between \nthe environment and the economy. \n11  A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 square meters). \n12 Government of the PRC, Fujian Provincial Government. 2014.

Fuzhou.  \n ", "3 \nproper use rates caused an overuse of fertilizers and pesticides leading to nonpoint source \npollution and soil degradation, reduced profits to farmers, and increased concerns about food \nsafety. Solving this problem requires (i) precise fertilizer application through soil and water \ntesting, improved soil and crop management, and use of organic fertilizers; (ii) capacity building \nof farmers; and (iii) the promotion of organic, green, and nonpolluting products, as well as \ninstitutional  interventions.  Water  use  efficiency  will  hinge  on  adequate  operation  and \nmaintenance of irrigation systems, e.g., by setting up dedicated water user groups, water-saving \nirrigation techniques, and better agricultural water management practices. \n8.  Agriculture is highly vulnerable to climate change. Coping with the significant variability \nof future climatic impacts requires efficient water resource management, boosting the capacity \nof agricultural support institutions and related stakeholders, and improving the support services \nto farmers as well as building resilience into production systems and the ecosystem.   \n9.  Inefficient  smallholder  agriculture. Smallholder farmers struggle to earn a decent \nincome from farming, which causes rural\u2013urban income disparity and limits socioeconomic \ndevelopment. Key hurdles are the large number of smallholder farmers, skilled labor shortage, \nand the lack of adequate training to improve farmers\u2019 technical knowledge and environmental \nawareness. Moreover, farmers do not always benefit from the adoption of sustainable practices \nbecause they lack access to quality-certification schemes that would boost recognition of their \norganic or green produce. Fujian Province is promoting land consolidation13 and cooperation \nmodels14 to  establish  links  between  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs),  private  enterprises, \ncooperatives,  and  farmers  as  a  means  to  organize  farmers,  facilitate  access  to  markets, \nincrease large-scale purchasing of inputs at lower prices, and transfer knowledge and services \nto their members as a means to increase rural economic development. Cooperation models can \nprovide  training  in  modern  agricultural  practices,  including  proper  fertilizer  and  pesticide \napplications, organic and green production practices, land management, and on-farm guidance. \nThis  would  result  in  better-quality  products,  product  certification,  and  greater  market \ncompetitiveness.15 However, concerns have emerged about the development, performance, and \ngovernance of SOE, private enterprises, and farmers\u2019 cooperatives, and whether benefits are \nshared  equitably.  Additional  support  is  required  to  ensure that  technical  and  management \ncapacities  are  up  to  the  task  and  to  promote  equitable  and  inclusive  economic  and  rural \nlivelihood development opportunities.  \n10.  As the PRC strives to build an \u201cecological civilization,\u201d managing the environment is of \nparamount  concern  as  is  improving  rural  livelihoods,  and  are  the  basis  for  sustainable \nagriculture  systems.  These  multifaceted  systems  will  be  piloted  in  Fujian  Province  to \ndemonstrate (i) protection of arable land resources and optimal development; (ii) enhanced \nagricultural productivity and promotion of sustainable utilization through efficient water use and \nless environmental pollution; and (iii) cooperation models between enterprises, cooperatives, \nand farmers.   \n11.

The project supports the National Agricultural Sustainable \nDevelopment Plan, 2015\u20132030 (footnote 5) and the State Council No. 1 Document (2016) \npromoting agriculture reform and modernization. The project is in line with the priorities of the \ncountry partnership strategy, 2016\u20132020 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the PRC\u2014\ni.e., to manage climate change and the environment, support inclusive economic growth under \nthe \u201cnew normal,\u201d and achieve an \u201cecological civilization\u201d16\u2014and ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for \nAgriculture and Natural Resources, which promotes greater productivity and stronger efficiency \nin resource use, agribusiness development, and enhanced food safety and quality.17 It is also in \nline with the Sustainable Development Goals 8, 13, 15, and 17.18  \n12.  Lessons. The project design incorporates lessons from international and national best \npractices  in  agriculture,  environment,  and  ecosystem  improvement,  focusing  on  the \ndevelopment, participation, and empowerment of farmers and farmer organizations for improved \nproduction bases and equitable benefit sharing. The project will work through enterprises19 to \nhelp farmers organize themselves and apply new technologies, provide extension services, and \nopen up access to markets. Lessons from the Fujian Soil Conservation and Rural Development \nI and II projects were also incorporated,20 which focused on soil conservation and value chain \ndevelopment  resulting  in  reduced  soil  erosion  and  specialized  agriculture  products  being \npromoted.  The  proposed  project  focuses  on  rehabilitation  of  already  degraded  land  by \ndemonstrating sustainable land development and rehabilitation practices and by implementing \nsustainable, climate-resilient farming practices. The capacity and knowledge gained from these \nprojects  will  ensure  that  Fujian  Province  has  the  capacity  to  halt  degradation,  rehabilitate \ndegraded  lands,  and  promote  sustainable  agriculture  development  that  brings  benefits  to \nfarmers, stimulates the rural economy, and is climate-resilient. \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The project impact will be reduced land and environmental degradation and improved \nrural livelihoods in Fujian Province. The project outcome will be long-term farmland productivity \nand better climate resilience.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n14.  Output 1: Productive farmland established. This output will rehabilitate 63,700 mu of \nvalley-floor cropland and 200,000 mu of sloping land. Valley-floor improvements will comprise \nland leveling and development of farm infrastructure, such as roads that are suited to tractors \nand water-conserving facilities (25 kilometers of dikes and embankments for flood prevention, \ndrainage ditches, irrigation canals, and irrigation facilities), for cropping grains, vegetables, and \nlotus seeds.

Output 2: Sustainable farming technology and practices adopted. This output will \nsupport farmers and cooperatives to improve access to resources and technology through \ncooperation with SOEs and private enterprises and demonstrate improved and climate-resilient \ncropping  practices.  It  includes  the  provision  of  agricultural  equipment  and  materials  to \nimplement sustainable farming techniques such as soil conservation (e.g., applying organic \nfertilizer, implementing zero or low tillage, new crop varieties, and establishing tree plantations \nfor windbreaks and shade), integrated pest management, improved cropping practices (e.g., \nintercropping and crop rotation), and equipment to test the quality of soil and water. The output \nwill also assist the certification process for green and organic tea, and tea oil products. \n16.  Output 3: Institutional, technical, and management capacity strengthened. This \noutput  includes  (i)  training  for  farmers\u2019  cooperatives  on  cooperative  operation,  production \ntechnology, and marketing; (ii) training for project implementation units (PIUs) and farmers on \ngood agricultural practices and technology, including certification of green and organic products; \n(iii)  establishment  and  capacity  development  of  farmland  infrastructure  management  and \nmaintenance associations; and (iv) training on gender and development to ensure inclusion of \nwomen and the poor in project activities.   \n17.  Demonstration features. The project will demonstrate sustainable farming systems and \npractices that will offer a range of productivity, socioeconomic, and environmental benefits to \nfarmers and to society in general\u2014e.g., high and stable productivity and profitability, adaptation \nand  resilience  to  climate  change,  and  a  better  environment  and  less  degradation.  These \nsystems  are  replicable  throughout  the  PRC  to  combat  land  and  soil  degradation.  Key \ndemonstration features are: \n(i)  Private sector\u2013led development. Promotion of farmer\u2013cooperative\u2013enterprise \ncooperation models based on mutually beneficial mechanisms that allow farmers \naccess to new technologies and practices combined with extension services and \ntraining,  better  infrastructure  and  market  access,  guaranteed  prices  for  their \nproducts, and improved due process for land leasing to increase the scale of \nfarm systems. This approach is promoted by the government to supplement \nregular government services that cannot reach and benefit all farmers. \n(ii)  Climate-resilient  agriculture.  The  project  (a)  applies  water  management \npractices that capture and store water for irrigation, offer potential for energy, \nwater, and money savings, and boost crop yields by reducing drought impacts, \nmaintaining soil health, and reducing runoff to minimize soil erosion and transfer \nof pollutants; (b) selects crops and varieties that are well adapted, high-yielding, \nand resistant to biotic and abiotic stresses; and (c) provides good-quality seeds \nand seedlings to ensure high-quality varieties.  \n(iii)  Integrated pest management. The project applies integrated management of \npests, diseases, and weeds by using suitable physical and biological measures, \nand  selective  and  low-risk  pesticides.  This  will  reduce  the  use  of  chemical \npesticides, environmental pollution, and improve product quality and food safety.  \n(iv)  Better crop nutrition thanks to healthy soils. Healthy soils can be achieved \nthrough crop rotations and by using organic fertilizer while minimizing inorganic \nfertilizer.  The  project  will  provide  soil-testing  and  water-testing  equipment  to \nenable fertilizing recommendations based on crop and soil needs, and promote \nthe  use  of  organic  matter  to  maintain,  improve,  and  rebuild  soils.  This  will \nimprove nutrient supply, water-retention, soil structure, and erosion prevention.   \n ", "6 \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n18.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n22.  The project was prepared in accordance with PRC guidelines and regulations and took \ninto account consultants\u2019 recommendations during project preparation. The technical feasibility \nwas confirmed to be adequate after detailed examination of the project\u2019s compatibility with local \nconditions.  A  climate  risk  and  vulnerability  assessment  highlighted  the  threat  that  climate \nchange poses to project viability as high. Modeling indicates that until at least 2050, mean \nannual temperatures will rise, the risk of extreme climate events (particularly drought and flood) \nwill increase, and variability in precipitation will increase. Crops will need more water at times \nand that water availability for irrigation will be reduced at times. It also means an increase in the \nincidence of crop diseases and/or pests under the warming conditions, and flooding of valley-\nfloor land. The project will deal with these issues by improving on-farm water storage, boosting \n ", "8 \nwater  use  efficiency  with  better  irrigation,  applying  integrated  pest  control  management, \nestablishing shelterbelts, dike embankments, and providing comprehensive training on better \nfarming practices.24 Analyses confirm that even under the least favorable climate scenarios, the \nproject\u2019s water use requirements are sustainable. The project will strengthen climate resilience \nand will demonstrate the importance of adaptation measures to the project counties. \nB.  Economic and Financial \n23.  The economic analysis indicates that the project is economically viable, with an overall \neconomic internal rate of return of 15.8% and a net present value of CNY305.9 million. The \nanalysis also confirms the economic viability of all subprojects, with economic internal rates of \nreturn ranging from 12.3% to 22.5%. Sensitivity analysis showed that the project is resilient to \nnegative scenarios such as an increase in investment costs, revenue reduction, and increase in \noperation and maintenance cost. The financial analysis confirms (i) financial viability of revenue-\ngenerating subprojects, (ii) financial sustainability of nonrevenue subprojects, and (iii) financial \nmanagement  capacity  of  subprojects.  The  financial  sustainability  of  the  subprojects  was \nassessed based on the fiscal impact of counterpart funds during the project, operation and \nmaintenance costs, and the loan repayment obligation. The analysis confirmed the financial \nsustainability of the project, since the project will have substantially limited fiscal consequences \nfor the FPG and project county and city governments.25 \nC.  Governance \n \n24.  An  assessment  of  the  procurement  capacity  confirmed  that  the  executing  agency, \nimplementing agencies, and PIUs, acting through a procurement agency and with assistance \nfrom  ADB  and  loan  implementation  consultants,  have  adequate  capacity.  The  financial \nmanagement  assessment  indicated  that  the  FPG  has  sufficient  capacity,  whereas  most \nimplementing  agencies  meet  basic  requirements  but  need  further  training.  The  financial \nmanagement risk was assessed as moderate on a pre-mitigation basis and based on the FPG\u2019s \nprevious experience with ADB projects. The FPG will ensure that (i) additional training on ADB\u2019s \ndisbursement  procedures  is  provided,  (ii)  unified  financial  management  guidelines  are \nformulated with assistance from the loan implementation consultants, (iii) PIUs assign qualified \nfinance staff to manage its project account, and (iv) additional assistance and training in project \nmanagement is provided by the PPMO and municipal project management offices. Given the \nmitigating measures, these financial management arrangements are deemed adequate. \n25.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  FPG.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 21). \nD.  Poverty and Social \n26.  The project offers opportunities for local people to cooperate with agricultural enterprises \nin improving farming practices in 122 villages in 51 towns or townships in 13 counties. The \nproject will benefit 16,397 households and 62,507 people, including 26,826 women and 3,181 \nrural poor who will directly participate in project activities. The total population of 227,788 in \nproject villages is expected to benefit indirectly from better farming infrastructure and various \ntraining opportunities. Benefits include jobs created during construction and operation, access to \n                                                \n24 Detailed results and recommendations are in the Technical Report on Agriculture: Climate-Smart Agriculture, Soil \nConservation, and Irrigation Water Resources Management (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n25  Economic Analysis and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nfarm inputs and markets, and better farming skills. The project is classified as effective gender \nmainstreaming. A gender action plan and a social development action plan were prepared and \ninclude the following measures with specific targets for women: (i) training of project staff and \ntechnical  training  for  farmers  (50%  women);  (ii)  consultation  and  information  disclosure; \n(iii) avoidance of adverse impacts on farmers and ensuring of due process for land lease and \nbenefit-sharing  arrangements;  (iv)  capacity  building  for  farmers\u2019  cooperatives;  (v) local \nemployment  of  58,200  workers  during  construction  (at  least  35%  women);  (vi) community \nparticipation in design and implementation of project activities; and (vii) use of local construction \nmaterials  and  resources.26 The  PPMO  has  endorsed  the  gender  action  plan  and  social \ndevelopment action plan.  \nE.  Safeguards \n27.  Environment.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  environment.  An  initial \nenvironmental examination (IEE), including an environmental management plan (EMP), was \nprepared and is consistent with the requirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \nThe IEE was disclosed on the ADB website on 10 February 2016 and is consistent with the \ndomestic  environmental  assessments.  Consultations  involved  key  stakeholders,  including \ncommunities  and  government  agencies  in  the  13  project  counties,  and  the  outcomes  are \nintegrated in the project design. The FPG, through the PPMO, will be responsible for the \nimplementation  of  and  compliance  with  the  EMP,  which  includes  inspection,  monitoring, \nreporting, and launch of any corrective actions needed. The PPMO will implement and have \nfinal responsibility for an environmental, social, and general grievance redress mechanism to \nhandle disputes. The PIUs will be responsible for site-based implementation of the EMP and \ngrievance redress mechanism.  \n28.  The project is expected to achieve significant environmental benefits, particularly better \ncontrol of soil erosion, sustainable use of water resources, and less use of chemicals. Strong \nintegrated planning for the project design and safeguards included a comprehensive screening \nand selection process for subprojects, which resulted in significant avoided impacts, such as the \nexclusion of sites in or near natural habitats and water-source protection areas. Soil erosion \n(during  construction),  expanded  use  of  fertilizers  and  pesticides,  and  unsustainable  water \ndemand (during operation) were seen as other key environmental risks. These were mitigated \nthrough project design and safeguards, which target soil-protecting farming practices (including \nmulching and shelterbelts), conversion to organic fertilizers, integrated pest management, and \ngreater water use efficiency. The EMP contains safeguard measures to mitigate soil erosion \nduring  construction;  manage  construction  waste;  and  clarify  environmental  monitoring  and \nreporting, roles and responsibilities, and capacity building. The IEE concludes that effective \nEMP implementation, along with the prescribed training, will result in acceptable impacts. \n29.  Involuntary  resettlement.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  involuntary \nresettlement. Due diligence on the 28 contracts governing the transfer of land-use rights and of \n231  cooperation  agreements  concluded  that  legal  procedures  were  followed,  parties  were \ninformed and consulted, contracts and agreements were voluntary, and farmers will benefit from \nland rents, jobs, training and/or other benefits specified in the contracts and agreements. Due \ndiligence confirmed that there will be no involuntary resettlement impacts.27 An external monitor \nwill monitor the contracts during project implementation. The project activities will not involve \n                                                \n26  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).

The construction or rehabilitation of some infrastructure works may impact \nportions  of  farmlands  permanently  or  temporarily,  requiring  land  readjustments  and/or \ncompensation measures within the affected village. A resettlement framework was prepared to \nfurther  screen  impacts  during  detailed  design  and  to  prepare  the  resettlement  plan.  The \nresettlement framework was endorsed by the project management office and disclosed publicly.  \n \n30.  Indigenous peoples. The project is classified as category C for indigenous peoples. A \npoverty and social analysis was conducted and verified that no ethnic minority people live in the \nproject villages. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n31.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.28 The risk assessment for the overall project \nis medium, and the integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nImplementation delays  PPMO will hire a qualified tendering agent with ADB procurement experience.
