In  the  PRC,  70%-80%  of  croplands,  forestlands,  and  grasslands  are  degraded.4 \nMajor  problems  are water  and wind  erosion  of  soils,  reduced soil fertility,  over-exploited  water \nresources, nonpoint source pollution, and deforestation. Driven by inefficient irrigation, overuse \nof  chemical  fertilizers  and  pesticides,  improper  waste  treatment,  and  poor  land  use  practices, \nland  degradation  is  now  the  most  limiting  factor  to  agriculture  production  and  poses  a  serious \nthreat  to  food  security,  rural  livelihoods,  and  rural  economic  growth.  Reduced  agriculture \nproductivity  due  to  land  degradation  was  $37.09  billion  in  the  PRC  or  about  1%  of  the  gross \ndomestic product in 2007 (footnote 4). Yet land degradation can be prevented and reversed with \nsoil conditions improved and productivity restored. The cost of reversing land degradation and \napplying sustainable land management practices is considerably lower than the loss caused by \nland degradation.  \n \nIn  line  with  this  approach,  the  National  Agricultural  Sustainable  Development  Plan, \n4. \n2015\u20132030 focuses on tackling the major causes of degradation and promoting sustainable land \nand resource use.5 Key targets are to reduce chemical fertilizer and pesticide use, improve soil \nhealth,  control  soil  erosion,  and  promote  ecological,  featured,  and  high-efficiency  agriculture \nbased on high-quality products and production systems. To achieve these targets, the focus is \non investment in (i) water and soil resource protection,6 (ii) agricultural and rural environmental \ncontrol,7 and (iii) ecological rehabilitation. To implement this plan, the government will pilot and \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   The  13  project  counties  are  Wuyishan,  Guangze,  Datian,  Youxi,  Ninghua,  Yongding,  Xinluo,  Pinghe,  Zhangpu \n(Hua'an),  Jiaocheng,  Zherong,  Dongqiao,  and  Fu'an.  These  counties  were  selected  based  on  demand  for \nsustainable  agriculture  practices  and  poverty  alleviation  priority  counties.  The  selection  criteria  and  process  are \nsummarized  in  Annex  2  of  the  project  administration  manual  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \nAppendix 2). \n\n3   The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  for  the  Fujian  Farmland \n\nSustainable Utilization and Demonstration Project (TA 8741-PRC). \n\n4   X.

Springer  International \nPublishing. \n\n5    Released by the Ministry of Agriculture, National Development and Reform Commission, Ministry of Science and \nTechnology, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Land and Resources, Ministry of Environmental Protection, Ministry of \nWater Resources, and State Forestry Administration on 20 May 2015.  \n\n6  Such as high-standard farmland construction, protection and improvement of cultivated farmland, high-efficiency \nwater saving (promoting sprinkler irrigation, micro irrigation, rainfall collection and irrigation, and integral control of \nwater and fertilization), and monitoring of agricultural resources. \n\n7  Specifically, waste management, chemical fertilizer and pesticide control, recycling and reuse of agricultural film \n\nand pesticide packaging, straw utilization, and rural environmental integrated management. \n\n \n\n\fdemonstrate  sustainable  agricultural  production  practices  in  selected  provinces  based  on  the \nurgency of their rehabilitation needs. Fujian Province has been designated as a priority province. \n \n5. \nFujian  Province  is  mostly  mountainous  and  supports  an  agrarian  rural  economy  that \naccounts for 75.9% of the output of the primary sector and supports 39.2% of the total provincial \npopulation  (14.81  million  people  living  in  rural  areas).8 Because  of  the  topography,  agriculture \nproduces either perennial tree crops on sloping land or annual crops grown in the valley  floor, \nsuch as tea, tea oil, pomelo, rice, Chinese pearl barley, and lotus.9 The difficult terrain and poor \nland  management  practices  have  caused  widespread  land  and  environmental  degradation, \nwhich  is  further  exacerbated  by  a  changing  climate  and  extreme  weather  conditions.  This \nmakes agricultural production and rural livelihoods difficult to sustain. Per capita income in the \nrural  areas  of Fujian  is CNY11,184,  or  only  36.3%  of  urban  per  capita  income  (CNY30,816)\u2014\nthe  rural\u2013urban  disparity.  Farmers  need  additional  support  to  have  a  viable  livelihood  option \nbased on sustainable agriculture rather than turn to urban migration for an alternative livelihood. \nAs  a  leading  province  for  ecological  civilization,  Fujian  is  required  to  manage  its  environment, \nsafeguard  ecological  security,  adapt  to  climate  change,  improve  resource  conservation, \nundertake  environmentally  friendly  development,  and  use  and manage  more  sustainably  land, \nwater, and other natural resources to provide sustainable livelihood opportunities.10  \n\n6. \nLand  degradation.  Land resources in  Fujian Province are limited, allowing an average \nof  0.058  hectares  (0.88  mu)  of  farmland  per  rural  person,  which  is  only  about  65%  of  the \nnational  average.11 Moreover,  the  land  is  typically  of  poor  quality  and  low  crop  productivity\u2014\n78.1%  of  the  province\u2019s  arable  land  is  rated  as  low  to  medium  quality  because  of  poor  soil \nhealth, high rates of soil erosion, and outdated agricultural infrastructure, all of which constrains \nproduction. The infrastructure also has low resilience to natural disasters. The narrow dirt roads \nare  not  suited  for  motorized  agricultural  traffic  and  are  inaccessible  during  the  rainy  season. \nIrrigation systems are generally old, made of earthen channels and ditches that are dilapidated \nby  sedimentation  or  otherwise  in  disrepair,  resulting  in  low  irrigation  efficiency  of  about  40%, \nlower  than the  national average.  Effective irrigation  in  the  dry  season  and  drainage  in  the  wet \nseason  is  not  possible.  Efficient  and  productive  water  use  would  require  rehabilitation  and \nmodernization of irrigation and drainage infrastructure. The soils erode easily, especially  when \ncoupled  with  poor  land  management  practices  and  infrastructure  as  well  as  seasonal  high-\nintensity rainfall. Loss of soil resources, reduced fertility, and poor soil condition make remedial \nactions imperative. These include proper field design with terraces, and irrigation and drainage \ncanals  to  minimize  erosion,  and  the  application of  organic  matter  and fertilizers  to restore  soil \nhealth, which in turn will restore degraded land resources and increase productivity. \n\n7. \nPolluting  and  unproductive  cropping  systems.  Inefficient  water  use,  overuse  of \nchemical fertilizers and pesticides, and lack of capacity among farmers are the main constraints \nto  crop  productivity.  In  2013,  total  fertilizer  and  pesticide  application  per  unit  area  in  Fujian \nProvince  was  4.13  million  tons,  15%  higher  than  the  national  average.12 Limited  guidance  on \n\n                                                \n8   National Bureau of Statistics of China. National Data. http://data.stats.gov.cn/easyquery.htm?cn=E0103 (accessed \n31  August  2016).The  province\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  was  CNY2,405.58  billion  in  2014;  the  primary  sector\u2019s \ncontribution was 8.38% (CNY201.48 billion), to which the agriculture sector contributed CNY152.96 billion.  \n\n9   Fujian Province is the biggest tea producer in the PRC, contributing 18.5% to national production.  Tea production \n\nreached 347,000 tons in 2013, involving 10% of the provincial population. \n\n10 According  to  the  PRC  government,  \u201cecological  civilization\u201d  refers  to  achieving  harmony  between  growth,  people, \nand  nature,  requiring  people  to  respect,  protect,  and  maintain  a  harmonious  relationship  with  nature.  It  includes \nactivities to mitigate ecological damage, relieve pressures on natural resources, and improve the balance between \nthe environment and the economy. \n\n11  A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 square meters). \n12 Government of the PRC, Fujian Provincial Government. 2014.

Fuzhou.  \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fproper  use  rates  caused  an  overuse  of  fertilizers  and  pesticides  leading  to  nonpoint  source \npollution  and  soil  degradation,  reduced  profits  to  farmers,  and  increased  concerns  about  food \nsafety.  Solving  this  problem  requires  (i)  precise  fertilizer  application  through  soil  and  water \ntesting, improved soil and crop management, and use of organic fertilizers; (ii) capacity building \nof  farmers;  and  (iii)  the  promotion  of  organic,  green,  and  nonpolluting  products,  as  well  as \ninstitutional  interventions.  Water  use  efficiency  will  hinge  on  adequate  operation  and \nmaintenance of irrigation systems, e.g., by setting up dedicated water user groups, water-saving \nirrigation techniques, and better agricultural water management practices. \n\n8. \nAgriculture is highly vulnerable to climate change. Coping with the significant variability \nof future climatic impacts  requires efficient water resource management, boosting the capacity \nof agricultural support institutions and related stakeholders, and improving the support services \nto farmers as well as building resilience into production systems and the ecosystem.   \n\n9. \nInefficient  smallholder  agriculture.  Smallholder  farmers  struggle  to  earn  a  decent \nincome  from  farming,  which  causes  rural\u2013urban  income  disparity  and  limits  socioeconomic \ndevelopment. Key hurdles are the large number of smallholder farmers, skilled labor shortage, \nand  the  lack  of  adequate  training  to  improve  farmers\u2019  technical  knowledge  and  environmental \nawareness. Moreover, farmers do not always benefit from the adoption of sustainable practices \nbecause they  lack  access to quality-certification  schemes  that  would boost  recognition  of their \norganic  or  green  produce. Fujian  Province  is  promoting  land  consolidation13 and  cooperation \nmodels 14  to  establish  links  between  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs),  private  enterprises, \ncooperatives,  and  farmers  as  a  means  to  organize  farmers,  facilitate  access  to  markets, \nincrease large-scale purchasing of inputs at lower prices, and transfer knowledge and services \nto their members as a means to increase rural economic development. Cooperation models can \nprovide  training  in  modern  agricultural  practices,  including  proper  fertilizer  and  pesticide \napplications, organic and green production practices, land management, and on-farm guidance. \nThis  would  result \nin  better-quality  products,  product  certification,  and  greater  market \ncompetitiveness.15 However, concerns have emerged about the development, performance, and \ngovernance  of  SOE,  private  enterprises,  and  farmers\u2019  cooperatives,  and  whether  benefits  are \nshared  equitably.  Additional  support  is  required  to  ensure  that  technical  and  management \ncapacities  are  up  to  the  task  and  to  promote  equitable  and  inclusive  economic  and  rural \nlivelihood development opportunities.  \n\n10. \nAs  the  PRC  strives to  build an  \u201cecological  civilization,\u201d managing  the  environment  is of \nparamount  concern  as  is  improving  rural  livelihoods,  and  are  the  basis  for  sustainable \nagriculture  systems.  These  multifaceted  systems  will  be  piloted  in  Fujian  Province  to \ndemonstrate  (i)  protection  of  arable  land  resources  and  optimal  development;  (ii)  enhanced \nagricultural productivity and promotion of sustainable utilization through efficient water use and \nless  environmental  pollution;  and  (iii)  cooperation  models  between  enterprises,  cooperatives, \nand farmers.   \n\n11. \nStrategic  fit.  The  project  supports  the  government\u2019s  overarching  strategic  goal  of \nbuilding  a  harmonious  and  prosperous  society  through  regionally  balanced,  inclusive,  and \n\n                                                \n13  Government  of  the  PRC,  State  Council.  2014.

The  project  is  in  line  with  the  priorities  of  the \ncountry partnership strategy, 2016\u20132020 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the PRC\u2014\ni.e., to manage climate change and the environment, support inclusive economic growth under \nthe  \u201cnew  normal,\u201d  and  achieve  an  \u201cecological  civilization\u201d16\u2014and  ADB\u2019s  Operational  Plan  for \nAgriculture and Natural Resources, which promotes greater productivity and stronger efficiency \nin resource use, agribusiness development, and enhanced food safety and quality.17 It is also in \nline with the Sustainable Development Goals 8, 13, 15, and 17.18  \n\nfocusing  on \n\nimprovement, \n\nin  agriculture,  environment,  and  ecosystem \n\nLessons.  The  project  design  incorporates  lessons from  international  and  national  best \n12. \npractices \nthe \ndevelopment, participation, and empowerment of farmers and farmer organizations for improved \nproduction  bases  and  equitable  benefit  sharing.  The  project  will  work  through  enterprises19 to \nhelp farmers organize themselves and apply new technologies, provide extension services, and \nopen up access to markets. Lessons from the Fujian Soil Conservation and Rural Development \nI  and II  projects  were  also incorporated,20 which  focused  on  soil  conservation  and value  chain \ndevelopment  resulting  in  reduced  soil  erosion  and  specialized  agriculture  products  being \npromoted.  The  proposed  project  focuses  on  rehabilitation  of  already  degraded  land  by \ndemonstrating  sustainable  land  development  and  rehabilitation  practices  and  by  implementing \nsustainable, climate-resilient farming practices. The capacity and knowledge gained from these \nprojects  will  ensure  that  Fujian  Province  has  the  capacity  to  halt  degradation,  rehabilitate \ndegraded  lands,  and  promote  sustainable  agriculture  development  that  brings  benefits  to \nfarmers, stimulates the rural economy, and is climate-resilient. \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n13. \nThe  project  impact  will  be  reduced  land  and  environmental  degradation  and  improved \nrural livelihoods in Fujian Province. The project outcome will be long-term farmland productivity \nand better climate resilience.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n14. \nOutput 1: Productive farmland established. This output will rehabilitate 63,700 mu of \nvalley-floor  cropland  and  200,000  mu  of  sloping  land.

The project will demonstrate sustainable farming systems and \npractices  that  will  offer  a  range  of  productivity,  socioeconomic,  and  environmental  benefits  to \nfarmers and to society in general\u2014e.g., high and stable productivity and profitability, adaptation \nand  resilience  to  climate  change,  and  a  better  environment  and  less  degradation.  These \nsystems  are  replicable  throughout  the  PRC  to  combat  land  and  soil  degradation.  Key \ndemonstration features are: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nPrivate  sector\u2013led  development.  Promotion  of  farmer\u2013cooperative\u2013enterprise \ncooperation models based on mutually beneficial mechanisms that allow farmers \naccess to new technologies and practices combined with extension services and \ntraining,  better  infrastructure  and  market  access,  guaranteed  prices  for  their \nproducts,  and  improved  due  process  for  land  leasing  to  increase  the  scale  of \nfarm  systems.  This  approach  is  promoted  by  the  government  to  supplement \nregular government services that cannot reach and benefit all farmers. \nClimate-resilient  agriculture.  The  project  (a)  applies  water  management \npractices  that  capture  and  store  water  for  irrigation,  offer  potential  for  energy, \nwater,  and  money  savings,  and  boost  crop  yields  by  reducing  drought  impacts, \nmaintaining soil health, and reducing runoff to minimize soil erosion and transfer \nof pollutants; (b) selects crops and varieties that are well adapted, high-yielding, \nand resistant to  biotic  and  abiotic  stresses;  and (c)  provides  good-quality  seeds \nand seedlings to ensure high-quality varieties.  \nIntegrated  pest  management.  The  project  applies  integrated  management  of \npests, diseases, and weeds by using suitable physical and biological measures, \nand  selective  and  low-risk  pesticides.  This  will  reduce  the  use  of  chemical \npesticides, environmental pollution, and improve product quality and food safety.  \nBetter  crop  nutrition  thanks  to  healthy  soils.  Healthy  soils  can  be  achieved \nthrough  crop  rotations  and  by  using  organic  fertilizer  while  minimizing  inorganic \nfertilizer.  The  project  will  provide  soil-testing  and  water-testing  equipment  to \nenable  fertilizing  recommendations  based  on crop  and soil  needs,  and promote \nthe  use  of  organic  matter  to  maintain,  improve,  and  rebuild  soils.  This  will \nimprove nutrient supply, water-retention, soil structure, and erosion prevention.   \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $191.42  million  (Table  1).

The technical feasibility \nwas confirmed to be adequate after detailed examination of the project\u2019s compatibility with local \nconditions.  A  climate  risk  and  vulnerability  assessment  highlighted  the  threat  that  climate \nchange  poses  to  project  viability  as  high.  Modeling  indicates  that  until  at  least  2050,  mean \nannual temperatures will rise, the risk of extreme climate events (particularly drought and flood) \nwill  increase,  and  variability  in  precipitation  will  increase.  Crops  will  need  more  water  at  times \nand that water availability for irrigation will be reduced at times. It also means an increase in the \nincidence  of  crop  diseases  and/or  pests  under  the  warming  conditions,  and flooding  of  valley-\nfloor land. The project will deal with these issues by improving on-farm water storage, boosting \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nwater  use  efficiency  with  better  irrigation,  applying  integrated  pest  control  management, \nestablishing  shelterbelts,  dike  embankments,  and  providing  comprehensive  training  on  better \nfarming practices.24 Analyses confirm that even under the least favorable climate scenarios, the \nproject\u2019s water use requirements are sustainable. The project will strengthen climate resilience \nand will demonstrate the importance of adaptation measures to the project counties. \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nThe economic analysis indicates that the project is economically viable, with an overall \n23. \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  of  15.8%  and  a  net  present  value  of  CNY305.9  million.  The \nanalysis also confirms the economic viability of all subprojects, with economic internal rates of \nreturn  ranging from  12.3% to  22.5%.  Sensitivity  analysis  showed  that  the project  is  resilient  to \nnegative scenarios such as an increase in investment costs, revenue reduction, and increase in \noperation and maintenance cost. The financial analysis confirms (i) financial viability of revenue-\ngenerating subprojects, (ii) financial  sustainability  of  nonrevenue  subprojects,  and  (iii) financial \nmanagement  capacity  of  subprojects.  The  financial  sustainability  of  the  subprojects  was \nassessed  based  on  the  fiscal  impact  of  counterpart  funds  during  the  project,  operation  and \nmaintenance  costs,  and  the  loan  repayment  obligation.  The  analysis  confirmed  the  financial \nsustainability of the project, since the project will have substantially limited fiscal consequences \nfor the FPG and project county and city governments.25 \n\nGovernance \n\nC. \n \n24. \nAn  assessment  of  the  procurement  capacity  confirmed  that  the  executing  agency, \nimplementing  agencies,  and  PIUs,  acting  through  a  procurement  agency  and  with  assistance \nfrom  ADB  and  loan  implementation  consultants,  have  adequate  capacity.  The  financial \nmanagement  assessment  indicated  that  the  FPG  has  sufficient  capacity,  whereas  most \nimplementing  agencies  meet  basic  requirements  but  need  further  training.  The  financial \nmanagement risk was assessed as moderate on a pre-mitigation basis and based on the FPG\u2019s \nprevious experience with ADB projects. The FPG will ensure that (i) additional training on ADB\u2019s \ndisbursement  procedures  is  provided,  (ii)  unified  financial  management  guidelines  are \nformulated with assistance from the loan implementation consultants, (iii) PIUs assign qualified \nfinance staff to manage its project account, and (iv) additional assistance and training in project \nmanagement  is  provided  by  the  PPMO  and  municipal  project  management  offices.  Given  the \nmitigating measures, these financial management arrangements are deemed adequate. \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n25. \nwith  the  government  and  the  FPG.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 21). \n\nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n26. \nThe project offers opportunities for local people to cooperate with agricultural enterprises \nin  improving  farming  practices  in  122  villages  in  51  towns  or  townships  in  13  counties.  The \nproject  will  benefit  16,397  households and 62,507  people,  including  26,826  women  and  3,181 \nrural  poor  who  will  directly  participate  in  project  activities.  The  total  population  of  227,788  in \nproject  villages  is  expected  to  benefit  indirectly  from  better  farming  infrastructure  and  various \ntraining opportunities. Benefits include jobs created during construction and operation, access to \n                                                \n24 Detailed results and recommendations are in the Technical Report on Agriculture:  Climate-Smart Agriculture, Soil \nConservation,  and  Irrigation  Water  Resources  Management  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \nAppendix 2). \n\n25  Economic Analysis and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\ffarm inputs and markets, and better farming skills. The project is classified as effective gender \nmainstreaming. A gender action plan and a social development action plan were prepared and \ninclude the following  measures with specific  targets for  women:  (i) training  of  project  staff  and \ntechnical  training  for  farmers  (50%  women);  (ii)  consultation  and  information  disclosure; \n(iii) avoidance  of  adverse  impacts  on  farmers  and  ensuring  of  due  process  for  land  lease  and \nbenefit-sharing  arrangements;  (iv)  capacity  building \nfarmers\u2019  cooperatives;  (v) local \nemployment  of  58,200  workers  during  construction  (at  least  35%  women);  (vi) community \nparticipation in design and implementation of project activities; and (vii) use of local construction \nmaterials  and  resources. 26  The  PPMO  has  endorsed  the  gender  action  plan  and  social \ndevelopment action plan.  \n\nfor \n\nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n27. \nEnvironment.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  environment.  An  initial \nenvironmental  examination  (IEE),  including  an  environmental  management  plan  (EMP),  was \nprepared and is consistent with the requirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \nThe  IEE  was  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website  on  10  February  2016  and  is  consistent  with  the \ndomestic  environmental  assessments.  Consultations  involved  key  stakeholders,  including \ncommunities  and  government  agencies  in  the  13  project  counties,  and  the  outcomes  are \nintegrated  in  the  project  design.  The  FPG,  through  the  PPMO,  will  be  responsible  for  the \nimplementation  of  and  compliance  with  the  EMP,  which  includes  inspection,  monitoring, \nreporting,  and  launch  of  any  corrective  actions  needed.  The  PPMO  will  implement  and  have \nfinal  responsibility  for  an  environmental,  social,  and  general  grievance  redress  mechanism  to \nhandle  disputes.  The  PIUs  will  be  responsible  for  site-based  implementation  of  the  EMP  and \ngrievance redress mechanism.  \n\n28. \nThe project is expected to achieve significant environmental benefits, particularly  better \ncontrol  of  soil  erosion,  sustainable  use  of  water  resources,  and  less  use  of  chemicals.  Strong \nintegrated planning for the project design and safeguards included a comprehensive screening \nand selection process for subprojects, which resulted in significant avoided impacts, such as the \nexclusion  of  sites  in  or  near  natural  habitats  and  water-source  protection  areas.  Soil  erosion \n(during  construction),  expanded  use  of  fertilizers  and  pesticides,  and  unsustainable  water \ndemand  (during  operation)  were  seen  as  other key  environmental risks. These  were mitigated \nthrough project design and safeguards, which target soil-protecting farming practices (including \nmulching  and shelterbelts),  conversion to organic fertilizers,  integrated pest  management,  and \ngreater  water  use  efficiency.  The  EMP  contains  safeguard  measures  to  mitigate  soil  erosion \nduring  construction;  manage  construction  waste;  and  clarify  environmental  monitoring  and \nreporting,  roles  and  responsibilities,  and  capacity  building.  The  IEE  concludes  that  effective \nEMP implementation, along with the prescribed training, will result in acceptable impacts. \n\nInvoluntary  resettlement.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  involuntary \n29. \nresettlement. Due diligence on the 28 contracts governing the transfer of land-use rights and of \n231  cooperation  agreements  concluded  that  legal  procedures  were  followed,  parties  were \ninformed and consulted, contracts and agreements were voluntary, and farmers will benefit from \nland rents, jobs,  training  and/or  other  benefits  specified  in the contracts  and  agreements.  Due \ndiligence confirmed that there will be no involuntary resettlement impacts.27 An external monitor \nwill  monitor  the  contracts  during  project  implementation.  The  project  activities  will  not  involve \n\n                                                \n26  Gender Action Plan (accessible  from the list of linked documents in Appendix  2).

The  construction  or  rehabilitation  of  some  infrastructure  works  may  impact \nportions  of  farmlands  permanently  or  temporarily,  requiring  land  readjustments  and/or \ncompensation measures within the affected village. A resettlement framework was prepared to \nfurther  screen  impacts  during  detailed  design  and  to  prepare  the  resettlement  plan.  The \nresettlement framework was endorsed by the project management office and disclosed publicly.  \n \n30. \nIndigenous  peoples.  The project is classified as category C for indigenous peoples. A \npoverty and social analysis was conducted and verified that no ethnic minority people live in the \nproject villages. \n \nF. \n \n31.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.28 The risk assessment for the overall project \nis medium, and the integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nImplementation delays \ndue to limited experience \nof county project \nmanagement offices and \nimplementing agencies. \n\nMitigating Measures \nPPMO  will  hire  a  qualified  tendering  agent  with  ADB  procurement  experience.  The \nproject will provide consulting services for technical support and on-the-job training on \nprocurement,  disbursement,  and  financial  management.  The  PPMO  has  experience \nfrom two previous ADB-funded loan projects and will provide additional coaching to the \nimplementing agencies for smooth project implementation. \n\nFarmers are reluctant to \nadopt sustainable farming \ntechnology and practices. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, PPMO = provincial project management office. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nTraining  will  be  provided  to  all  project  farmers  during  implementation.  Participating \nprivate enterprises will further support the adoption of sustainable farming technologies \nand practices where weaknesses are identified. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n \nThe government and the FPG have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \n32. \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin  the  PAM  and  loan  documents.  The  government  and  the  FPG  have  agreed  with  ADB  on \ncertain  covenants  for  the  project,  which  are  set  forth  in  the  loan  agreement  and  project \nagreement.
