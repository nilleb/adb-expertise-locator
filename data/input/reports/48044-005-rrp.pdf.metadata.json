As  a  result  of  a  23%  drop  in  exports  and  a  concurrent  10%  drop  in \nimports,  as  well  as  revaluation  effects  related  to  currency  depreciation,  the  current  account \ndeficit  widened  to  11.8%  of  GDP.  Inflation  increased  to  4%  in  2015,  gaining  pace  during  the \nsecond half of the year, from 3.1% in 2014. Lower global hydrocarbon prices had only a limited \npositive impact on inflation because the depreciation of the lari and low competition led only to a \nmodest  decline  of  domestic  fuel  prices.  Any  boost  to  consumption  was  partially  offset  by \ndeclining  remittances  from  the  Russian  Federation,  which  fell  by  25%  in  2015.  The  budget \ndeficit increased to 3.8% of GDP in 2015, up from 2.9% in 2014. Total public debt rose to 41.5% \nof GDP in 2015 from 35.6% in 2014, partly reflecting 28.5% depreciation of the lari vis-\u00e0-vis the \ndollar.  However,  rising  global  oil  prices,  a  weaker  dollar,  and  increasing  foreign  exchange \nreceipts  from  tourism  and  exports  so  far  in  2016  contributed  to  an  appreciation  of  the  lari  by \n15.0%  from  March  to  early  June  2016.  The  government  expects  to  incur  fiscal  deficits  that \nrequire consolidation  over  the  next  3-5  years.4 With  deteriorating  fiscal  and  external  balances, \ndomestic borrowing costs increased by about 200 basis points to 9.7%, as the treasury bill yield \ncurve steepened. \n \nFinance  sector  risks  have  moderately  increased:  the  banks\u2019  nonperforming  loan  ratio \n4. \nrose  from  7.8%  in  March  2015  to  8.6%  in  March  2016  since  the  debt  service  capacity  of \nborrowers  suffers  in  the  context  of  slower  growth  and  significant  exposure  to  credit-induced \nforeign exchange risk for those who borrow in US dollars. Strengthening macroeconomic policy \nframeworks and the finance sector is essential to improve stability in this volatile environment. \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The proposed program is included in ADB. 2014. Country Operations Business Plan: Georgia, 2015\u20132017. Manila. \n3  National Bank of Georgia. 2016. Monetary Policy Report. Tbilisi. \n4  The  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  projects  a  fiscal  deficit  of  4.2%  for  2016  compared  with  3.8%  for  2015.  IMF  has \nexpressed concern at the widening deficit over the medium term and government is committed to take measures to \nkeep the deficit at around 3-4%. \n\n\f2 \n\nFiscal  policy  needs  to  strike  a  balance  between  managing  the  fiscal  deficit  and  stimulating \neconomic activity,  as  well  as protecting social  expenditures  over the  medium term.  Continuing \nstructural  reforms  are  needed  to  facilitate  adjustment  by  boosting  medium-term  economic \nprospects,  improving  competitiveness,  and creating  jobs.  From  a  macroeconomic  perspective, \nreform  of  contractual  savings  arrangements  and  provision  of  long-term  finance  are  critical  to \nexpand the fiscal space available to the government. \n \n5. \nPensions  and  contractual  savings.  The  state-funded  universal  pension  is  the  main \npillar  of  Georgia\u2019s  pension  system,  accounting  for  almost  82%  of  total  public  pension \nexpenditures. It provides all citizens with a flat-rate pension from the age of 60 for women and \n65 for men, favoring women because of its flat-rate nature. While the pension amount paid has \ndoubled from 2010 to 2015, it remains modest by international standards, providing a monthly \npension  equal  to  18%  of  the  average  wage,  marginally  above  the  subsistence  level.  The \nuniversal pension is the main mechanism to keep a large part of the population out of poverty. \nFinancing  the  universal  pension  constitutes  the  largest  social  spending  item,  accounting  for \n16.0%  of  public  expenditure  in  2015  and  4.1%  of  GDP.  This  expenditure  item  is  expected  to \ngrow  as  the  number  of  pensioners  grows.  Even  if  the  current  universal  pension  amount \nremained unchanged, the required budget could exceed 10% of GDP by 2050 because of the \nchanging demographic circumstances. This will strain Georgia\u2019s long-term fiscal sustainability.5 \nAdditional  mechanisms  to  encourage  private  savings  are  needed  to  allow  the  working \npopulation  to  build  pension  assets  that  will  provide  an  adequate  pension  income.  Such  an \nadditional  pillar  would  supplement the  universal  pension  and relieve  the  pressure on  the state \nbudget. \n \nFor this reason, the government is introducing a supplementary private pension savings \n6. \nscheme  with  defined  contributions  from  beneficiaries  and  employers,  thereby  increasing \nretirement  income  with  very  limited  contributions  from  the  state  budget.6 This  mostly  privately \nfunded  pension  will  generate  additional  benefits  by  improving  the  mobilization  of  long-term \nsavings  that  can  be  invested  in  long-term  investments  through  the  finance  sector.  Domestic \nlong-term funding capacity for investments is limited in Georgia, which results in overreliance on \nforeign  funding  and  contributes  to  significant  volatility  in  the  finance  sector  as  well  as \ndollarization.  Pension  funds  follow  long-term  investment  strategies,  with  a  primary  focus  on \nmaintaining real asset values and providing stable pension income. The private pension funds \nare  useful  in  providing  stable  funding  for  the  country\u2019s  infrastructure  needs  and  help  develop \ndomestic currency bond markets and security exchanges. \n \nLocal bond markets and financing. The Government of Georgia views limited access \n7. \nto  domestic  long-term  financial  resources  as  a  critical  obstacle  to  the  country\u2019s  economic \ndevelopment, since it constrains savings and limits long-term funding for investments. 7 Georgia \nhas a highly concentrated banking industry characterized by banks\u2019 dominance as investors in \nthe domestic securities market. Widening the range to other institutional and retail investors will \npromote  competition  and  financial  innovation.  The  structural  reforms  of  the  pension  system, \nincluding  the  development  of  private  pension  funds,  will  support  their  investment  in  domestic \n\n                                                \n5  Government  of  Georgia,  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Sustainable  Development.  2016.  Reform  of  the  Universal \n\nPension Benefit and Introduction of a Supplementary Pension Scheme. Tbilisi (final report). \n\n6  Georgia\u2019s pension system will have three pillars. A zero pillar provides a noncontributory universal pension, funded \nby  the  budget.  Pillar  II  will  be  a  quasi-mandatory  private  pension  with  an  opt-out  option,  where  employees  will \ncontribute 2% of their gross salary, and the same amount is provided by both the employer and the government. \nPillar III is a private pension savings scheme voluntarily funded by the beneficiaries.  \n\n7  The  World  Economic  Forum\u2019s  Global  Competitiveness  Report  2015\u20132016  ranked  Georgia  109th  out  of  140 \n\ncountries for ease of access to loans from the banking system, and 74th for affordability of financial services.  \n\n\fdebt and help develop secondary markets for fixed-income securities. The government aims to \ndeepen local bond markets to create a more inclusive financial system  and channel resources \nto support investment and business growth. \n \nLocal currency bond markets are important to increase access to finance for businesses, \n8. \nreduce  dollarization  of  debt,  and  limit  risk  exposures  of  business  borrowers  by  matching  the \ncurrency of their revenue, the lari, with that of their debt service, and provide an opportunity for \ndiversifying  the  portfolios  of  pension  funds  away  from  sovereign  debt.  Local  currency  bonds \nissued by international financial institutions (IFIs) can support the development of the domestic \nbond market and enable Georgian banks to expand their local currency lending to micro, small, \nand  medium-sized  enterprises  (MSMEs).  The  impact  will  reduce  MSMEs\u2019  currency  risk \nexposure,  support  their  access  to  the  European  Union  markets,  and  help  improve  gender-\nspecific gaps in access to finance. \n \n9. \nGovernment  efforts  and  development  coordination.  The  government  has  initiated \npension  reforms  to  improve  the  adequacy,  fairness,  and  sustainability  of  the  pension  system. \nThe Pension Reform Unit established in the Ministry of Economy and Sustainable Development \n(MOESD) in 2014 was further strengthened to prepare the legal and operational framework for \nthe private pension savings scheme. Under the capital market development strategy approved \nby  the  cabinet  in  May  2016,  the  government  is  developing  the  domestic  debt  market  by \nencouraging  greater  market  participation  and  availability  of  investment  resources.  The \ngovernment  is  also  boosting  the  availability  of  finance  to  MSMEs  with  increased  budget \nallocations to the Entrepreneurship Development Agency (EDA) and the Georgia Innovation and \nTechnology Agency (GITA), which in turn provide matching grants to MSMEs and financing for \ninnovation and technology development. \n \n10. \nBilateral  and  multilateral  development  agencies  are  supporting  the  country\u2019s  economic \ndevelopment. The World Bank supports strengthening the fiscal oversight of public institutions, \nupgrading the quality and coverage of social services, and deepening the finance sector through \npolicy-based \nInternational \nDevelopment  is  supporting  pension  reform  and  capital  market  development.  In  2014,  the \nEuropean  Parliament  ratified  the  European  Union\u2019s  Association  Agreement  with  Georgia, \nincluding  an  agreement  on  a  deep  and  comprehensive  free  trade  area  spanning  2014\u20132017, \nwhich,  together  with  political  association  and  market  opening,  aims  for  the  approximation  of \nGeorgian systems and norms with those of the European Union. In 2014, Georgia entered into a \n3-year standby arrangement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that provides a cushion \nagainst external balance-of-payment shocks, and supports a framework for discipline in macro-\nfiscal policies. \n \n11. \nADB\u2019s value additions and lessons. The support provided under subprograms 1 and 2 \nled to cabinet approval of the pension reform strategy in March 2016. The Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  was  instrumental  in  the  preparation  of  the  strategy  and  continues  to  provide \ntechnical support for the development of the new private pension savings scheme, including the \npreparation  of  relevant  legislation  and  its  operations.  Given  Georgia\u2019s  limited  private  pension \nexperience, continued technical support is critical. \n \n12. \nADB  is  working  closely  with  the  government  to  update  capital  market  legislation  and \nregulations that will improve the transparency of price discovery of issuers and traders, deepen \ninvestor  protection,  and  increase  public  awareness.  The  policy  actions  completed  by  the \ngovernment  under  this  ADB  program  since  2014  induced  IFIs  to  issue  local  currency  bonds \n(and attract local investors) by articulating and communicating the government\u2019s strategy to the \n\nlending  during  2015\u20132017.  The  United  States  Agency \n\nfor \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nmarket  and  providing  a  more  robust  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  local  corporate  bond \nissues.  The  Law  on  Registration  Fees,  amended  and  approved  by  Parliament,  facilitates  the \nissuance  of  lari-denominated  bonds.8   In  fact,  ADB,  the  Black  Sea  Trade  and  Development \nBank (BSTDB) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development issued $99 million \nequivalent  in  lari-denominated  bonds  in  2016,  and  since  financial  inclusion  of  MSMEs  is  an \nimportant  objective  of  the  program,  the  borrowing  financial  institutions  are  onlending  the \nproceeds of the ADB bonds mostly to farmers and MSMEs.9 \n \nRelevant  lessons  on  the  need  for  policy  reforms,  a  stronger  focus  on  inclusive  growth, \n13. \nand  longer-term  engagement  in  public  sector  reforms  were  incorporated  from  the  evaluation \nfindings  of  Georgia\u2019s  country  program  portfolio  into  the  program  design,  and  continue  to  be \napplied  throughout  the  program  cluster.  The  need  to  provide  longer-term  technical  assistance \nduring the implementation of the program and beyond was also factored in. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  impact  will  be  citizens,  particularly  women,  benefiting  from  higher  living  standards \n14. \nand more employment opportunities. The outcome will be the effective mobilization of domestic \nresources for increased public and private investment. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n15. \nThe  program  has  three  subprograms  that  all  support  the  government\u2019s  reforms  in  four \nareas: (i) improving treasury management of debt, cash, and fiscal risk; (ii) strengthening public \nrevenue  and  expenditure  management;  (iii)  enhancing  generation  of  domestic  savings;  and \n(iv) increasing  mobilization  of  private  resources  for  investment.  Subprogram  3  has  25  policy \nactions, all of which have been completed. Subprogram 3 includes the following three additional \npolicy actions that were completed in 2016: (i) issuance of lari bonds by IFIs equivalent to $99 \nmillion  to  facilitate  the  financing  of  MSMEs,  (ii)  passage  of  the  Law  on  Registration  Fees  to \nfacilitate  these  issuances,  and  (iii)  establishment  of  accounting  standards  aligned  with  EU \nnorms to facilitate the issuance of corporate securities. \n \nOutput 1: Improved management of debt, cash, and fiscal risk. The objective of this \n16. \noutput  is  to  strengthen  public  debt,  cash,  and  fiscal  risk  management  for  better  fiscal \nconsolidation. Subprogram 1 strengthened government debt management processes, increased \ntransparency,  and  developed  analytical  and  forecasting  capabilities.  Fiscal  risk  management \nwas  improved  through  a  strategy  that  entails  managing  different  fiscal  risks  and  identifying \nbudgetary  and  contingent \nlarge  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs). \nSubprogram 2 further strengthened public debt and cash management through the preparation \nof a medium-term debt management strategy covering debt portfolio management and policies \nfor issuing new debt, and a plan to strengthen the analytical and advisory capability through the \nnew Middle Office of the Public Debt and External Financing Department. Under subprogram 2, \nthe  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  established  a  fiscal  risk  management  function  in  charge  of \nmanaging  contingent  liabilities  of  SOEs  and  fiscal  risks  related  to  public\u2013private  partnership \n\nliabilities  related \n\nto \n\n                                                \n8  The  Law  on  Registration  Fees  supports  an  investment  environment  that  is  conducive  to  capital  market \ndevelopment  and  securities  issuance  by  IFIs,  in  particular  public  tender  of  a  particularly  large  issuance  of \nsecurities.  The  National  Bank  of  Georgia  used  to  charge  a  registration  fee  of  0.1%,  which  for  large  issuances \namounts  to  a  sizable  sum.  The  new  law  imposes  a  cap  of  GEL5,000  per  issuance  and  further  exempts  market \nparticipants from the registration fee until 2020. \n\n9   ADB. 2015. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to Georgia for \n\nthe Financial Inclusion for Micro and Small Business Growth. Manila. \n\n\fin \n\nthe  government\u2019s \n\n(PPP)  projects.  MOF  carried  out  the  first  assessment  of  macro  risk,  public  debt  sustainability, \nand review of risk associated with loan guarantees and other similar contingent liabilities. \n \n17. \nUnder  subprogram  3,  debt  and  cash  management  was  strengthened  further  through \n(i) legal  amendments  underpinning  the  government\u2019s  debt  strategy  submitted  to  Parliament, \n(ii) an upgraded debt management and risk analysis system in the Middle Office integrated with \ne-budget  and  e-treasury  systems,  and  (iii)  reporting  of  the  value  of  guarantees  issued  by  the \ngovernment \nfinancial  statements.  Fiscal  risk  management  was \nstrengthened further by (i) covering information on the debt of SOEs and contingent liabilities of \nSOEs and PPPs as a supplement to the state budget documents, and (ii) carrying out the first \ncomplete assessment of finance sector risk and SOE fiscal risks. \n \nOutput 2: Strengthened revenue and expenditure management. The objective of this \n18. \noutput  is  to  increase  the  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  revenue  collection,  improve  public \nexpenditure management, and strengthen local government transfers. To achieve this objective, \nactions  under  subprogram  1  established  an  administrative  department  under  the  Georgia \nRevenue Service, devised an action plan to replace external auditors with in-house tax auditors, \nand integrated budgeting and budget execution functions of government entities into the public \nfinancial management system and the treasury single account. Under subprogram 2, tax arrears \nwere  recovered  from  active  taxpayers  amounting  to  GEL80  million,  and  the  statutory  time \nlimitation on tax notices and taxpayer notices was reduced from 6 to 5 years. The number of in-\nhouse  tax  auditors  was  increased  to  286,  of  which  147  are  women,  and  legal  and  regulatory \ngaps  relating  to  the  preparation,  due  diligence,  and  implementation  of  PPP  projects  were \nidentified.  To  strengthen  local  government  finances,  proposals  for  amendments  to  the \nBudgetary Code defining the separation of revenues between the budgets of state, autonomous \nregions, and municipalities were submitted to Parliament. \n \n19. \nSubprogram  3  built  on  the  accomplishments  made  under  subprograms  1  and  2.  The \neffectiveness  and  efficiency  of  revenue  collection  was  further  increased  by  (i)  writing  off  tax \narrears  of  defunct  businesses  on  the  basis  of  legally  approved  categories;  (ii)  reducing  the \nstatutory  time  limitation  of  tax  notices  and  taxpayer  notices  from  5  to  3  years  (instead  of  the \ntargeted 4 years), shortening the tax liability imposition period and providing relief to taxpayers; \nand (iii) phasing out external tax auditors completely and increasing the number of in-house tax \nauditors to 330, of whom 175 are women (a significant  increase over the original target of 150). \nUnder subprogram 3, public expenditure management was further improved by the preparation \nof  draft  regulations  to  address  legal  and  regulatory  gaps  for  PPP  projects.  Local  government \nfinancing was also strengthened by increasing of intergovernmental transfers by GEL65 million \nin the 2016 budget. \n \n20. \nOutput  3:  Enhanced generation  of  domestic savings. The objective of this output is \nto reform the existing pension system to help prevent old-age poverty and provide an adequate \nreplacement  income.  Affordability  for  the  fund  contributors  and  sustainability  are  essential. \nMeasures  include  streamlining  the  universal  pension,  and  creating  a  supplementary  private \npension  savings  scheme.  Subprogram  1  established  the  Pension  Reform  Unit  to  prepare  a \npension  reform  policy.  Under  subprogram  2,  the  unit  completed  a  diagnostic  of  the  pension \nsystem,  issued  a  consensual  paper  setting  out  the  supplementary  private  pension  savings \nscheme, and prepared a public awareness campaign on pension reforms. \n \nPolicy  actions  under  subprogram  3  were  consolidated  and  regrouped  to  represent \n21. \nuniversal pension; administration of the new, privately funded pension system; legislation for the \nprivate pension system; and a related public communication campaign, but covering the same \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\noutputs  as  envisaged  under  the  overall  program.  On  the  universal  pension,  the  cabinet \napproved  revisions  in  lieu  of  the  overall  policy,  including  indexation  of  the  pension  to  improve \nincome security of pensioners, while maintaining equitable treatment of men and women. As for \nthe  supplementary  private  pension  savings  scheme,  the  cabinet  approved  its  outline,  while \nMOESD  set  out  the  structure  and  the  sequence  of  steps  for  its  implementation,  and  provided \nadditional  staff  in  the  Pension  Reform  Unit  to  prepare  the  launch  of  the  scheme.  The \ngovernment  undertook  the  legal  drafting  and  its  submission  for  approval  to  the  Economic \nCouncil under a single legislation covering the supplementary private pension savings scheme \n(pillar II) and the voluntary private pension savings scheme (pillar III). Submission to Parliament, \nas  originally  envisaged,  will  be  done  later  in  2016.  MOESD  launched  a  nationwide  public \nawareness campaign on the benefits of the pension savings schemes, including gender aspects.  \n \nOutput 4: Increased mobilization of private resources for investment. The objective \n22. \nof  this  output  is  to  mobilize  long-term  finance  and  enhance  access  to  finance  for  MSME \nfinancing,  including gender  targeting.  Under  subprogram  1,  an  interagency  working group  was \nestablished to initiate capital market development, and EDA and GITA were created to provide \nmatching grants  to  MSMEs  and  support  private  innovation  and  technology  development.  EDA \nlaunched the Produce in Georgia program with a component focusing on MSME development in \nrural  areas.  GITA  created  Geolab,  a  mobile  training  and  knowledge-exchange  platform;  and \nfablab,  which  will  assist  research  and  development  to  disseminate  knowledge  through  mobile \ntechnology.  Under  subprogram  2,  the  government  prepared  and  submitted  a  capital  market \nreform  strategy  and action  plan  for  cabinet  approval,  and  allocated  budgets to  EDA  and GITA \nfor financing to MSMEs, of which 30% were earmarked for businesses owned by women. \n \nUnder  subprogram  3,  capital  market  development  was  supported  by  (i)  a  public \n23. \nawareness  campaign  on  the  benefits  of  capital  market  reforms,  including  investor  protection, \nfinancial  instruments  for  investment,  long-term  savings,  and  the  links  with  pension  reform,  as \nwell  as  gender  aspects;  (ii)  a  review  of  laws,  bylaws,  and  regulations  essential  for  managing \ninvestments  and  private  pension  funds,  and  for  governance,  risk  management,  and  fund \nmanagers; and (iii) enhancing money market development regulations by approving accounting \nand  prudential  regulations  for  repurchase  orders  and  securities  lending.  Access  to  finance  for \nMSMEs  was  broadened  by  (i)  providing  GEL25  million  from  the  state  budget  to  EDA, \n(ii) expanding  matching  grants  to  MSMEs  by  GEL5  million,  with  40%  financing  earmarked  for \nwomen-led  businesses;  (iii)  providing  GEL8  million  to  GITA;  and  (iv)  expanding  private \ninnovation  and  technology  development  by  GEL4.5  million,  of  which  40%  is  earmarked  for \nwomen-led  businesses.  Under  subprogram  3,  gender  targeting  is  being  enhanced  as \nsummarized  in  a  government  gender  action  plan  and  public  disclosure  of  measures  that \npromote gender equity, including MSME training and financing. \n \n24. \nUnder  subprogram  3,  the  following  additional  actions  were  implemented.  ADB,  the \nBSTDB, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development issued lari bonds of $99 \nmillion  equivalent  to  improve  the  availability  of  local  currency  credit  for  MSMEs.  The  Law  on \nRegistration  Fees  approved  by  Parliament  waived  bond  issuance  fees  to  IFIs  to  stimulate  the \ndevelopment of the local currency capital market. In addition, the Law on Accounting, Reporting, \nand  Auditing  was  drafted  to  set  standards  for  corporate  securities  and  align  the  legal  acts  to \ncomply  with  the  European  Union  directives.  The  lari  bond  issuances  are  the  result  of \nimprovements to the market infrastructure, and of related laws and regulations instituted under \nthe program. \n \n \n\n\fDevelopment Financing Needs \n\nD. \n \nThe  total  program  funding  is  estimated  at  $250  million  equivalent  for  2014\u20132016. 10 \n25. \nSubprogram  3  amounts  to  $100  million  equivalent.  Subprograms  1  and  2  each  amounted  to \n$75 million  equivalent,  disbursed  in  2014  and  2015.  To  help  finance  subprogram  3,  the \ngovernment  has  requested  (i)  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR35,818,000  ($50 \nmillion  equivalent)  from  ADB's  Special  Funds  resources,  and  (ii)  a  loan  of  $50  million  from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. The Asian Development Fund loan will have a 25-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate of 2.0% per annum, and such other terms \nand  conditions  set  forth in  the  draft  loan  agreement.11 The  ordinary  capital  resources  loan  will \nhave a 15-year term,  including  a grace  period  of  3  years,  straight-line  amortization,  an  annual \ninterest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year,  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement.  On  this  basis,  the  average  loan  maturity  is \n9.25 years, with no maturity premium payable to ADB. \n \nThe  government\u2019s  development-related  financing  gap  is  estimated  at  GEL1,395  million \n26. \nin 2016.12 The government  intends to  borrow  both from  domestic (14.3%) and foreign (85.7%) \nsources  to  finance  the  gap.  Domestic  borrowing  will  comprise  GEL200  million  raised  through \ntreasury  securities.  Foreign  borrowing  will  be  at  long  tenor  projected  at  GEL680  million,  and \nanticipated  budget  support from  development  partners  is GEL515 million  equivalent  in 2016.13 \nADB\u2019s loan under subprogram 3 for $100 million equivalent will help to narrow the government\u2019s \ndevelopment  financing  gap  from  development  partners  by  46.6%  in  2016.  Budget  support  is \nnecessary  to  finance  part  of  the  development  financing  needs,  especially  covering  the  period \nfrom the introduction of reforms under the ADB program to the realization of fiscal benefits. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n27.  MOF is the executing agency, and MOESD and MOF are the implementing agencies for \nthe program. A program steering committee chaired by the deputy minister of finance comprises \nsenior  officials  from  the  two  ministries,  and  meets  semiannually  to  review  the  progress  in \nachieving  the  agreed  policy  actions.  The  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  disbursed  to Georgia  in \naccordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2015,  as  amended \nfrom time to time).14 The implementation period for the overall program is from January 2014 to \nSeptember  2016,  while  the  implementation  period  for  subprogram  3  is  from  October  2015  to \nSeptember 2016. \n \n \n \n\n                                                \n10  The  initial  funding  amount  was  $200  million.  The  increased  amount  is  justified  by  government\u2019s  increase  of  the \n\nuniversal pension rate in 2016 costing $75 million and additional actions as outlined in para 15. \n\n11  Georgia will graduate from access to Asian Development Fund resources on 1 January 2017. In accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Special  Operations  Loan  Regulations  (2006),  Georgia\u2019s  graduation  will  require  modification  to  each \noutstanding ADF loan to Georgia in order to, at Georgia\u2019s election, either accelerate repayment of each ADF loan \nor  increase  the  interest  rate  applicable  to  each  ADF  loan.  Once  an  election  has  been  made,  the  required \nmodification will also apply to the ADF loan proposed for this subprogram 3. ADB. 2006. Special Operations Loan \nRegulations.

The  reforms  bear  both  the  direct  and  operating  costs  of  dedicated \nthe  program. 15  Higher  government \npublic \nexpenditures are therefore warranted over the short term to realize these savings, necessitating \nthe need for budgetary support. Over time, these reforms will generate a positive fiscal feedback \nby  creating  a  wider  and  more  diversified  economic  base  and  stronger  management  of \nmacroeconomic risks. The reform program will result in cost savings and additional gains due to \n(i) a reduced burden on public finances from the universal pension in the long term thanks to the \nintroduction  of  a  supplementary  pension  savings  scheme;  (ii)  financial  savings  from  more \nefficient  and  effective  use  of  public  resources  through  better  cash,  debt,  and  fiscal  risk \nmanagement; and (iii) financial gains from additional revenues thanks to stronger mobilization of \nprivate investment capital and finance for MSMEs, greater coverage of enterprises in the formal \neconomy, and increased collection of tax arrears. \n \n29. \nimplications.  Pension \nexpenditures have more than quadrupled since 2005, reaching GEL1.39 billion or 4.1% of GDP \nin  2015.  Given  the  regular  increases  in  the  universal  pension  rate  and  number  of  pensioners, \nthe government will incur GEL7.37 billion in universal pension payments for 2016\u20132020.16 The \nindexation cost related to the increase of the universal pension rate from GEL150 to GEL160 in \n2015  is  costing  the  state  budget  an  additional  GEL180  million  in  2016.  The  supplementary \npension  savings  scheme  cost  to  the  government  will  include  matching  contributions  from  the \ngovernment,  employer  contributions  where  the  government  is  the  employer,  and  forgone  tax \nrevenue  on  contributions  to  and  withdrawals  from  the  pension  fund.  As  a  result,  the \nsupplementary pension savings scheme will cost the government a projected GEL360 million in \nthe first 3 years, and GEL726 million in the first 5 years of implementation.17 \n \n30. \nDevelopment  of  the  medium-term  debt  strategy  under  the  program  aims  to  meet  the \ngovernment\u2019s public financing needs and payment obligations while minimizing long-term costs. \nThe reforms will lead to additional benefits and savings associated with fiscal discipline and with \nimprovements in core budgetary and fiscal risk management within MOF. Additional revenues of \nGEL100  million  were  realized  in  2016  from  the  recovery  of  tax  arrears,  and  increased \nintergovernmental  transfers  of  GEL65  million  were  made.  Developing  capital  markets  to \nmobilize  long-term  finance  will  spur  growth  and  increase  the  efficiency  of  MSMEs  through \ngreater  access  to  finance,  better  gender  targeting,  and  a  stronger  regulatory  framework. \nMobilizing  private  resources  for  investment  is  important  given  the  low  national  savings  rate, \nwhich  compounds  the  twin  deficit  of  fiscal  and  external  imbalances  with  a  low  reliance  on \ninternal sources of financing. Implementation of the supplementary pension savings scheme is \nestimated to accumulate savings of GEL316 million in the pension fund after the first year, and \nis  forecast  to  reach  GEL16.7 billion  by  2030.  Such  increased  savings  in national  currency  will \nsupport de-dollarization and stimulate investment for further development of capital markets. \n\n                                                \n15 The  costs  incurred  to  public  agencies  are  in  terms  of  monitoring,  implementation,  and  enforcement,  including \nexpenses  associated  with  establishing  statutory  agencies,  budget  increases,  expenditure  programs,  and  forgone \nrevenue. Indirect fiscal costs include staff time and other expenses. \n16 MOF estimates (assuming pension rate growth indexed to inflation) \n17 Detailed  analyses  and  cost  calculations  of  the  pension  reforms  are  provided  in  the  Economic  and  Financial \n\nAnalysis (accessible from the list of linked of documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fB. \n\nGovernance \n\n31. \nSignificant reforms have taken place to strengthen public financial management. These \ninclude  the  introduction  of  a  medium-term  budget  framework,  program-based  budgeting,  a \nbudget classification system based on the IMF's Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001,18 \nand a rules-based system for fiscal transfers from the central government to local governments. \nIn  addition,  state  financial  transactions  were  unified  under  a  treasury  single  account,  and  an \nelectronic  budget  management  system  was  established.  Problems  remain,  however,  such  as \npoor monitoring and analysis of government contingent liabilities, non-inclusion of revenues and \nexpenditure  of  some  legal  entities  of  public  law  in  budget  execution  reports,  inadequate \npredictability  and  transparency  of  intergovernmental  transfers,  limited  internal  audit  capacity, \nand  weak  legislative  scrutiny  of  external  audit  reports. 19  The  State  Procurement  Agency \ncontinues  to  improve  transparency  in  public  procurement  processes  by  adopting  international \nstandards.  A  new  module  was  recently  integrated  into  the  e-procurement  system,  which  now \nprovides for the procurement needs of multilateral development banks. The government made \nfighting high-level corruption a priority. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nwas explained to and discussed with MOF and MOESD. \n \nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nThe universal pension plays an important role in poverty reduction and is a valuable tool \n32. \nfor welfare distribution. Without the universal pension, the poverty rate would increase from 24% \nto 33%, and inequality would increase the Gini coefficient from 37.7 to 40.9.20 Subprogram 3 is \ncategorized effective gender mainstreaming since it takes measures against unequal access to \nassets  and  resources,  and  against  insufficient  attention  to  gender  in  economic  development \npolicy.  Pension  reforms  will  ensure  equitable  treatment  for  men  and  women,  allowing  both  to \naccumulate  sufficient  pension  assets  to  have  an  adequate  retirement  income,  while  mitigating \nthe  risk  of  old-age  poverty  through  the  universal  pension.  The  Georgia  Revenue  Service  is \nhiring  an  equal  number  of  men  and  women  as  in-house  tax  auditors.  Nationwide  public \nawareness  campaigns  conducted  on  pension  reforms  and  on  capital  market  development \nincluded gender aspects. EDA has allocated 40% of matching grants to women entrepreneurs \nfor  business  development.  GITA  has  allocated  funds  to  support  private  sector  innovation  and \ntechnology  development,  of  which  40%  are  earmarked  for  women  entrepreneurs.  The \ngovernment will implement its gender action plan, with actions to boost women\u2019s participation in \neconomic and business development.21 \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\n33. \nProgram activities are limited to policy and institutional reforms. None of the activities will \nlead  to  involuntary  resettlement,  or  affect  indigenous  peoples.  No  adverse  environmental \nimpacts  were  identified. The  policy-based  loan  will  not  involve any  construction works  or  have \nan  impact  on  the  environment.  The  safeguard  categories  for  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples are all C. \n \n\n                                                \n18 IMF. 2001.

These  will  be  mitigated  through \nefficient public financial management, while maintaining capital expenditures and diversification \nof  trade  partners,  including  the  European  Union.  Pressure  on  the  widening  fiscal  deficit  from \nincreased  social  expenditures  and  lower  revenues  will  be  reduced  through  the  introduction  of \nthe  supplementary  pension  savings  scheme.  Broader  access  to  finance  for  businesses  and \nexport  promotion  is  being  facilitated  through  EDA  and  GITA.  Public  financial  management \nrelated risks are identified as weakness in monitoring of continent liabilities, unpredictable local \ngovernment  finances,  and  incomplete  coverage  of  public  finances  channeled  through  the \ntreasury  single  account.  The  risks  are  being  mitigated  with  support  from  the  program  by \nimproving MOF\u2019s reporting on contingent liabilities and its assessment of SOE fiscal risks. The \ncoverage of public finances channeled through the treasury single account has been enhanced, \nintegrating all levels of budgets and revenue generated from all public entities through user fees \nand charges  into  the  public financial  management  information  system.  The integrated  benefits \nof  the  program  are  expected  to  outweigh  the  costs.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are \ndescribed in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.22 \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n35. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of subprogram 3 shall conform to \nall  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender,  procurement,  consulting services,  and  disbursement as described in detail  in the loan \ndocuments.
