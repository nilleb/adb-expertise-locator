THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed policy-\nbased loans to Georgia for subprogram 3 of the Improving Domestic Resource Mobilization for \nInclusive Growth Program.1 \n \n2.  The proposed program aims to improve domestic resource mobilization to achieve more \ninclusive growth in Georgia through better debt and fiscal risk management, more efficient \nrevenue and public expenditure management, generation of domestic savings, and mobilization \nof private resources for investment. 2 Inequality of income and opportunity is addressed by \nimproving  access  to  markets  and  making  the  regulatory  environment  more  conducive  for \nbusinesses and individuals, and through redistributive fiscal policy, specifically in tax and social \nexpenditure. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  With real gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 2.8% in 2015, down from 4.6% in \n2014, Georgia\u2019s economy was clearly affected by the recession in the Russian Federation and \nweak economic performance in Azerbaijan, Turkey, Ukraine, and other trading partners, which \nreduced investment growth, exports, and the inflow of remittances.3 Despite the expansion of \ndomestic demand and fiscal stimulus, GDP growth declined to 2.6% during the first quarter of \n2016 compared with the same period in 2015, and the government expects modest annual GDP \ngrowth of 3% for 2016. As a result of a 23% drop in exports and a concurrent 10% drop in \nimports, as well as revaluation effects related to currency depreciation, the current account \ndeficit widened to 11.8% of GDP. Inflation increased to 4% in 2015, gaining pace during the \nsecond half of the year, from 3.1% in 2014. Lower global hydrocarbon prices had only a limited \npositive impact on inflation because the depreciation of the lari and low competition led only to a \nmodest  decline  of  domestic  fuel  prices.  Any  boost  to  consumption  was  partially  offset  by \ndeclining remittances from the Russian Federation, which fell by 25% in 2015. The budget \ndeficit increased to 3.8% of GDP in 2015, up from 2.9% in 2014. Total public debt rose to 41.5% \nof GDP in 2015 from 35.6% in 2014, partly reflecting 28.5% depreciation of the lari vis-\u00e0-vis the \ndollar. However, rising global oil prices, a weaker dollar, and increasing foreign exchange \nreceipts from tourism and exports so far in 2016 contributed to an appreciation of the lari by \n15.0% from March to early June 2016. The government expects to incur fiscal deficits that \nrequire consolidation over the next 3-5 years.4 With deteriorating fiscal and external balances, \ndomestic borrowing costs increased by about 200 basis points to 9.7%, as the treasury bill yield \ncurve steepened. \n \n4.  Finance sector risks have moderately increased: the banks\u2019 nonperforming loan ratio \nrose from 7.8% in March 2015 to 8.6% in March 2016 since the debt service capacity of \nborrowers suffers in the context of slower growth and significant exposure to credit-induced \nforeign exchange risk for those who borrow in US dollars. Strengthening macroeconomic policy \nframeworks and the finance sector is essential to improve stability in this volatile environment. \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The proposed program is included in ADB. 2014. Country Operations Business Plan: Georgia, 2015\u20132017. Manila. \n3  National Bank of Georgia. 2016. Monetary Policy Report. Tbilisi. \n4  The Ministry of Finance (MOF) projects a fiscal deficit of 4.2% for 2016 compared with 3.8% for 2015. IMF has \nexpressed concern at the widening deficit over the medium term and government is committed to take measures to \nkeep the deficit at around 3-4%. ", "2 \nFiscal policy needs to strike a balance between managing the fiscal deficit and stimulating \neconomic activity, as well as protecting social expenditures over the medium term. Continuing \nstructural  reforms  are  needed  to  facilitate  adjustment  by  boosting  medium-term  economic \nprospects, improving competitiveness, and creating jobs. From a macroeconomic perspective, \nreform of contractual savings arrangements and provision of long-term finance are critical to \nexpand the fiscal space available to the government. \n \n5.  Pensions and contractual savings. The state-funded universal pension is the main \npillar  of  Georgia\u2019s  pension  system,  accounting  for  almost  82%  of  total  public  pension \nexpenditures. It provides all citizens with a flat-rate pension from the age of 60 for women and \n65 for men, favoring women because of its flat-rate nature. While the pension amount paid has \ndoubled from 2010 to 2015, it remains modest by international standards, providing a monthly \npension  equal  to  18%  of  the  average  wage,  marginally  above  the  subsistence  level.  The \nuniversal pension is the main mechanism to keep a large part of the population out of poverty. \nFinancing the universal pension constitutes the largest social spending item, accounting for \n16.0% of public expenditure in 2015 and 4.1% of GDP. This expenditure item is expected to \ngrow  as  the  number  of  pensioners  grows.  Even  if  the  current  universal  pension  amount \nremained unchanged, the required budget could exceed 10% of GDP by 2050 because of the \nchanging demographic circumstances. This will strain Georgia\u2019s long-term fiscal sustainability.5 \nAdditional  mechanisms  to  encourage  private  savings  are  needed  to  allow  the  working \npopulation to build pension assets that will provide an adequate pension income. Such an \nadditional pillar would supplement the universal pension and relieve the pressure on the state \nbudget. \n \n6.  For this reason, the government is introducing a supplementary private pension savings \nscheme  with  defined  contributions  from  beneficiaries  and  employers,  thereby  increasing \nretirement income with very limited contributions from the state budget.6 This mostly privately \nfunded pension will generate additional benefits by improving the mobilization of long-term \nsavings that can be invested in long-term investments through the finance sector. Domestic \nlong-term funding capacity for investments is limited in Georgia, which results in overreliance on \nforeign  funding  and  contributes  to  significant  volatility  in  the  finance  sector  as  well  as \ndollarization. Pension funds follow long-term investment strategies, with a primary focus on \nmaintaining real asset values and providing stable pension income. The private pension funds \nare useful in providing stable funding for the country\u2019s infrastructure needs and help develop \ndomestic currency bond markets and security exchanges. \n \n7.  Local bond markets and financing. The Government of Georgia views limited access \nto  domestic  long-term  financial  resources  as  a  critical  obstacle  to  the  country\u2019s  economic \ndevelopment, since it constrains savings and limits long-term funding for investments. 7 Georgia \nhas a highly concentrated banking industry characterized by banks\u2019 dominance as investors in \nthe domestic securities market. Widening the range to other institutional and retail investors will \npromote competition and financial innovation. The structural reforms of the pension system, \nincluding the development of private pension funds, will support their investment in domestic \n                                                \n5  Government of Georgia, Ministry of Economy and Sustainable Development. 2016. Reform of the Universal \nPension Benefit and Introduction of a Supplementary Pension Scheme. Tbilisi (final report). \n6  Georgia\u2019s pension system will have three pillars. A zero pillar provides a noncontributory universal pension, funded \nby the budget. Pillar II will be a quasi-mandatory private pension with an opt-out option, where employees will \ncontribute 2% of their gross salary, and the same amount is provided by both the employer and the government. \nPillar III is a private pension savings scheme voluntarily funded by the beneficiaries.  \n7  The World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Competitiveness Report 2015\u20132016 ranked Georgia 109th out of 140 \ncountries for ease of access to loans from the banking system, and 74th for affordability of financial services.  ", "3 \ndebt and help develop secondary markets for fixed-income securities. The government aims to \ndeepen local bond markets to create a more inclusive financial system and channel resources \nto support investment and business growth. \n \n8.  Local currency bond markets are important to increase access to finance for businesses, \nreduce dollarization of debt, and limit risk exposures of business borrowers by matching the \ncurrency of their revenue, the lari, with that of their debt service, and provide an opportunity for \ndiversifying the portfolios of pension funds away from sovereign debt. Local currency bonds \nissued by international financial institutions (IFIs) can support the development of the domestic \nbond market and enable Georgian banks to expand their local currency lending to micro, small, \nand  medium-sized  enterprises  (MSMEs).  The  impact  will  reduce  MSMEs\u2019  currency  risk \nexposure, support their access to the European Union markets, and help improve gender-\nspecific gaps in access to finance. \n \n9.  Government efforts and development coordination. The government has initiated \npension reforms to improve the adequacy, fairness, and sustainability of the pension system. \nThe Pension Reform Unit established in the Ministry of Economy and Sustainable Development \n(MOESD) in 2014 was further strengthened to prepare the legal and operational framework for \nthe private pension savings scheme. Under the capital market development strategy approved \nby  the  cabinet  in  May  2016,  the  government  is  developing  the  domestic  debt  market  by \nencouraging  greater  market  participation  and  availability  of  investment  resources.  The \ngovernment  is  also  boosting  the  availability  of  finance  to  MSMEs  with  increased  budget \nallocations to the Entrepreneurship Development Agency (EDA) and the Georgia Innovation and \nTechnology Agency (GITA), which in turn provide matching grants to MSMEs and financing for \ninnovation and technology development. \n \n10.  Bilateral and multilateral development agencies are supporting the country\u2019s economic \ndevelopment. The World Bank supports strengthening the fiscal oversight of public institutions, \nupgrading the quality and coverage of social services, and deepening the finance sector through \npolicy-based  lending  during  2015\u20132017.  The  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment  is  supporting  pension  reform  and  capital  market  development.  In  2014,  the \nEuropean  Parliament  ratified  the  European  Union\u2019s  Association  Agreement  with  Georgia, \nincluding an agreement on a deep and comprehensive free trade area spanning 2014\u20132017, \nwhich, together with political association and market opening, aims for the approximation of \nGeorgian systems and norms with those of the European Union. In 2014, Georgia entered into a \n3-year standby arrangement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that provides a cushion \nagainst external balance-of-payment shocks, and supports a framework for discipline in macro-\nfiscal policies. \n \n11.  ADB\u2019s value additions and lessons. The support provided under subprograms 1 and 2 \nled to cabinet approval of the pension reform strategy in March 2016. The Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  was  instrumental  in  the  preparation  of  the  strategy  and  continues  to  provide \ntechnical support for the development of the new private pension savings scheme, including the \npreparation of relevant legislation and its operations. Given Georgia\u2019s limited private pension \nexperience, continued technical support is critical. \n \n12.  ADB is working closely with the government to update capital market legislation and \nregulations that will improve the transparency of price discovery of issuers and traders, deepen \ninvestor  protection,  and  increase  public  awareness.  The  policy  actions  completed  by  the \ngovernment under this ADB program since 2014 induced IFIs to issue local currency bonds \n(and attract local investors) by articulating and communicating the government\u2019s strategy to the \n ", "4 \nmarket and providing a more robust legal and regulatory framework for local corporate bond \nissues. The Law on Registration Fees, amended and approved by Parliament, facilitates the \nissuance of lari-denominated bonds.8  In fact, ADB, the Black Sea Trade and Development \nBank (BSTDB) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development issued $99 million \nequivalent in lari-denominated bonds in 2016, and since financial inclusion of MSMEs is an \nimportant  objective  of  the  program,  the  borrowing  financial  institutions  are  onlending  the \nproceeds of the ADB bonds mostly to farmers and MSMEs.9 \n \n13.  Relevant lessons on the need for policy reforms, a stronger focus on inclusive growth, \nand longer-term engagement in public sector reforms were incorporated from the evaluation \nfindings of Georgia\u2019s country program portfolio into the program design, and continue to be \napplied throughout the program cluster. The need to provide longer-term technical assistance \nduring the implementation of the program and beyond was also factored in. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The impact will be citizens, particularly women, benefiting from higher living standards \nand more employment opportunities. The outcome will be the effective mobilization of domestic \nresources for increased public and private investment. \n \nC.  Outputs \n15.  The program has three subprograms that all support the government\u2019s reforms in four \nareas: (i) improving treasury management of debt, cash, and fiscal risk; (ii) strengthening public \nrevenue and expenditure management; (iii) enhancing generation of domestic savings; and \n(iv) increasing mobilization of private resources for investment. Subprogram 3 has 25 policy \nactions, all of which have been completed. Subprogram 3 includes the following three additional \npolicy actions that were completed in 2016: (i) issuance of lari bonds by IFIs equivalent to $99 \nmillion to facilitate the financing of MSMEs, (ii) passage of the Law on Registration Fees to \nfacilitate these  issuances,  and (iii)  establishment  of  accounting  standards  aligned  with  EU \nnorms to facilitate the issuance of corporate securities. \n \n16.  Output 1: Improved management of debt, cash, and fiscal risk. The objective of this \noutput  is  to  strengthen  public  debt,  cash,  and  fiscal  risk  management  for  better  fiscal \nconsolidation. Subprogram 1 strengthened government debt management processes, increased \ntransparency, and developed analytical and forecasting capabilities. Fiscal risk management \nwas improved through a strategy that entails managing different fiscal risks and identifying \nbudgetary  and  contingent  liabilities  related  to  large  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs). \nSubprogram 2 further strengthened public debt and cash management through the preparation \nof a medium-term debt management strategy covering debt portfolio management and policies \nfor issuing new debt, and a plan to strengthen the analytical and advisory capability through the \nnew Middle Office of the Public Debt and External Financing Department. Under subprogram 2, \nthe Ministry of Finance (MOF) established a fiscal risk management function in charge of \nmanaging contingent liabilities of SOEs and fiscal risks related to public\u2013private partnership \n                                                \n8  The  Law  on  Registration  Fees  supports  an  investment  environment  that  is  conducive  to  capital  market \ndevelopment and securities issuance by IFIs, in particular public tender of a particularly large issuance of \nsecurities. The National Bank of Georgia used to charge a registration fee of 0.1%, which for large issuances \namounts to a sizable sum. The new law imposes a cap of GEL5,000 per issuance and further exempts market \nparticipants from the registration fee until 2020. \n9  ADB. 2015. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to Georgia for \nthe Financial Inclusion for Micro and Small Business Growth. Manila. ", "5 \n(PPP) projects. MOF carried out the first assessment of macro risk, public debt sustainability, \nand review of risk associated with loan guarantees and other similar contingent liabilities. \n \n17.  Under subprogram 3, debt and cash management was strengthened further through \n(i) legal amendments underpinning the government\u2019s debt strategy submitted to Parliament, \n(ii) an upgraded debt management and risk analysis system in the Middle Office integrated with \ne-budget and e-treasury systems, and (iii) reporting of the value of guarantees issued by the \ngovernment  in  the  government\u2019s  financial  statements.  Fiscal  risk  management  was \nstrengthened further by (i) covering information on the debt of SOEs and contingent liabilities of \nSOEs and PPPs as a supplement to the state budget documents, and (ii) carrying out the first \ncomplete assessment of finance sector risk and SOE fiscal risks. \n \n18.  Output 2: Strengthened revenue and expenditure management. The objective of this \noutput is to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of revenue collection, improve public \nexpenditure management, and strengthen local government transfers. To achieve this objective, \nactions  under  subprogram  1  established  an  administrative  department  under  the  Georgia \nRevenue Service, devised an action plan to replace external auditors with in-house tax auditors, \nand integrated budgeting and budget execution functions of government entities into the public \nfinancial management system and the treasury single account. Under subprogram 2, tax arrears \nwere recovered from active taxpayers amounting to GEL80  million, and the statutory time \nlimitation on tax notices and taxpayer notices was reduced from 6 to 5 years. The number of in-\nhouse tax auditors was increased to 286, of which 147 are women, and legal and regulatory \ngaps  relating  to  the  preparation,  due  diligence,  and  implementation  of  PPP  projects  were \nidentified.  To  strengthen  local  government  finances,  proposals  for  amendments  to  the \nBudgetary Code defining the separation of revenues between the budgets of state, autonomous \nregions, and municipalities were submitted to Parliament. \n \n19.  Subprogram 3 built on the accomplishments made under subprograms 1 and 2. The \neffectiveness and efficiency of revenue collection was further increased by (i) writing off tax \narrears of defunct businesses on the basis of legally approved categories; (ii) reducing the \nstatutory time limitation of tax notices and taxpayer notices from 5 to 3 years (instead of the \ntargeted 4 years), shortening the tax liability imposition period and providing relief to taxpayers; \nand (iii) phasing out external tax auditors completely and increasing the number of in-house tax \nauditors to 330, of whom 175 are women (a significant  increase over the original target of 150). \nUnder subprogram 3, public expenditure management was further improved by the preparation \nof draft regulations to address legal and regulatory gaps for PPP projects. Local government \nfinancing was also strengthened by increasing of intergovernmental transfers by GEL65 million \nin the 2016 budget. \n \n20.  Output 3: Enhanced generation of domestic savings. The objective of this output is \nto reform the existing pension system to help prevent old-age poverty and provide an adequate \nreplacement  income.  Affordability for the fund contributors  and  sustainability  are  essential. \nMeasures include streamlining the universal pension, and creating a supplementary private \npension savings scheme. Subprogram 1 established the Pension Reform Unit to prepare a \npension reform policy. Under subprogram 2, the unit completed a diagnostic of the pension \nsystem, issued a consensual paper setting out the supplementary private pension savings \nscheme, and prepared a public awareness campaign on pension reforms. \n \n21.  Policy  actions  under  subprogram  3  were  consolidated  and  regrouped  to  represent \nuniversal pension; administration of the new, privately funded pension system; legislation for the \nprivate pension system; and a related public communication campaign, but covering the same \n ", "6 \noutputs  as  envisaged  under  the  overall  program.  On  the  universal  pension,  the  cabinet \napproved revisions in lieu of the overall policy, including indexation of the pension to improve \nincome security of pensioners, while maintaining equitable treatment of men and women. As for \nthe supplementary private pension savings scheme, the cabinet approved its outline, while \nMOESD set out the structure and the sequence of steps for its implementation, and provided \nadditional  staff  in  the  Pension  Reform  Unit  to  prepare  the  launch  of  the  scheme.  The \ngovernment  undertook  the  legal  drafting  and  its  submission  for  approval  to  the  Economic \nCouncil under a single legislation covering the supplementary private pension savings scheme \n(pillar II) and the voluntary private pension savings scheme (pillar III). Submission to Parliament, \nas originally envisaged, will be done later in 2016. MOESD launched a nationwide public \nawareness campaign on the benefits of the pension savings schemes, including gender aspects.  \n \n22.  Output 4: Increased mobilization of private resources for investment. The objective \nof  this  output  is  to  mobilize  long-term  finance  and  enhance  access  to  finance  for  MSME \nfinancing, including gender targeting. Under subprogram 1, an interagency working group was \nestablished to initiate capital market development, and EDA and GITA were created to provide \nmatching grants to MSMEs and support private innovation and technology development. EDA \nlaunched the Produce in Georgia program with a component focusing on MSME development in \nrural areas. GITA created Geolab, a mobile training and knowledge-exchange platform; and \nfablab, which will assist research and development to disseminate knowledge through mobile \ntechnology. Under subprogram 2, the government prepared and submitted a capital market \nreform strategy and action plan for cabinet approval, and allocated budgets to EDA and GITA \nfor financing to MSMEs, of which 30% were earmarked for businesses owned by women. \n \n23.  Under  subprogram  3,  capital  market  development  was  supported  by  (i)  a  public \nawareness campaign on the benefits of capital market reforms, including investor protection, \nfinancial instruments for investment, long-term savings, and the links with pension reform, as \nwell as gender aspects; (ii) a review of laws, bylaws, and regulations essential for managing \ninvestments  and  private  pension  funds,  and  for  governance,  risk  management,  and  fund \nmanagers; and (iii) enhancing money market development regulations by approving accounting \nand prudential regulations for repurchase orders and securities lending. Access to finance for \nMSMEs  was  broadened  by  (i)  providing  GEL25  million  from  the  state  budget  to  EDA, \n(ii) expanding matching grants to MSMEs by GEL5 million, with 40% financing earmarked for \nwomen-led  businesses;  (iii)  providing  GEL8  million  to  GITA;  and  (iv)  expanding  private \ninnovation and technology development by GEL4.5 million, of which 40% is earmarked for \nwomen-led  businesses.  Under  subprogram  3,  gender  targeting  is  being  enhanced  as \nsummarized  in  a  government  gender  action  plan  and  public  disclosure  of  measures  that \npromote gender equity, including MSME training and financing. \n \n24.  Under  subprogram  3,  the  following  additional  actions  were  implemented.  ADB,  the \nBSTDB, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development issued lari bonds of $99 \nmillion equivalent to improve the availability of local currency credit for MSMEs. The Law on \nRegistration Fees approved by Parliament waived bond issuance fees to IFIs to stimulate the \ndevelopment of the local currency capital market. In addition, the Law on Accounting, Reporting, \nand Auditing was drafted to set standards for corporate securities and align the legal acts to \ncomply  with  the  European  Union  directives.  The  lari  bond  issuances  are  the  result  of \nimprovements to the market infrastructure, and of related laws and regulations instituted under \nthe program. \n \n ", "7 \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n25.  The total program funding is estimated at $250 million equivalent for 2014\u20132016.10 \nSubprogram 3 amounts to $100 million equivalent. Subprograms 1 and 2 each amounted to \n$75 million  equivalent,  disbursed  in  2014  and  2015.  To  help  finance  subprogram  3,  the \ngovernment has requested (i) a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR35,818,000 ($50 \nmillion equivalent) from ADB's Special Funds resources, and (ii) a loan of $50 million from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. The Asian Development Fund loan will have a 25-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate of 2.0% per annum, and such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement.11 The ordinary capital resources loan will \nhave a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, straight-line amortization, an annual \ninterest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. On this basis, the average loan maturity is \n9.25 years, with no maturity premium payable to ADB. \n \n26.  The government\u2019s development-related financing gap is estimated at GEL1,395 million \nin 2016.12 The government intends to borrow both from domestic (14.3%) and foreign (85.7%) \nsources to finance the gap. Domestic borrowing will comprise GEL200 million raised through \ntreasury securities. Foreign borrowing will be at long tenor projected at GEL680 million, and \nanticipated budget support from development partners is GEL515 million equivalent in 2016.13 \nADB\u2019s loan under subprogram 3 for $100 million equivalent will help to narrow the government\u2019s \ndevelopment financing gap from development partners by 46.6% in 2016. Budget support is \nnecessary to finance part of the development financing needs, especially covering the period \nfrom the introduction of reforms under the ADB program to the realization of fiscal benefits. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n27.  MOF is the executing agency, and MOESD and MOF are the implementing agencies for \nthe program. A program steering committee chaired by the deputy minister of finance comprises \nsenior officials from the two ministries, and meets semiannually to review  the progress in \nachieving the agreed policy actions. The proceeds of the loan will be disbursed to Georgia in \naccordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2015, as amended \nfrom time to time).14 The implementation period for the overall program is from January 2014 to \nSeptember 2016, while the implementation period for subprogram 3 is from October 2015 to \nSeptember 2016. \n \n \n \n                                                \n10  The initial funding amount was $200 million. The increased amount is justified by government\u2019s increase of the \nuniversal pension rate in 2016 costing $75 million and additional actions as outlined in para 15. \n11  Georgia will graduate from access to Asian Development Fund resources on 1 January 2017. In accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Special  Operations  Loan  Regulations  (2006),  Georgia\u2019s  graduation  will  require  modification  to  each \noutstanding ADF loan to Georgia in order to, at Georgia\u2019s election, either accelerate repayment of each ADF loan \nor increase the interest rate applicable to each ADF loan. Once an election has been made, the required \nmodification will also apply to the ADF loan proposed for this subprogram 3. ADB. 2006. Special Operations Loan \nRegulations.

The reforms supported by the program entail direct and indirect fiscal costs to the \ngovernment\u2014the cost of implementing and monitoring the reforms\u2014along with fiscal savings in \nthe medium to long term. The reforms bear both the direct and operating costs of dedicated \npublic  functions  and  agencies  established  under  the  program. 15  Higher  government \nexpenditures are therefore warranted over the short term to realize these savings, necessitating \nthe need for budgetary support. Over time, these reforms will generate a positive fiscal feedback \nby  creating  a  wider  and  more  diversified  economic  base  and  stronger  management  of \nmacroeconomic risks. The reform program will result in cost savings and additional gains due to \n(i) a reduced burden on public finances from the universal pension in the long term thanks to the \nintroduction  of  a  supplementary  pension  savings  scheme;  (ii)  financial  savings  from  more \nefficient  and  effective  use  of  public  resources  through  better  cash,  debt,  and  fiscal  risk \nmanagement; and (iii) financial gains from additional revenues thanks to stronger mobilization of \nprivate investment capital and finance for MSMEs, greater coverage of enterprises in the formal \neconomy, and increased collection of tax arrears. \n \n29.  Pension  reforms  alone  will  have  major  budgetary  cost  implications.  Pension \nexpenditures have more than quadrupled since 2005, reaching GEL1.39 billion or 4.1% of GDP \nin 2015. Given the regular increases in the universal pension rate and number of pensioners, \nthe government will incur GEL7.37 billion in universal pension payments for 2016\u20132020.16 The \nindexation cost related to the increase of the universal pension rate from GEL150 to GEL160 in \n2015 is costing the state budget an additional GEL180 million in 2016. The supplementary \npension savings scheme cost to the government will include matching contributions from the \ngovernment, employer contributions where the government is the employer, and forgone tax \nrevenue  on  contributions  to  and  withdrawals  from  the  pension  fund.  As  a  result,  the \nsupplementary pension savings scheme will cost the government a projected GEL360 million in \nthe first 3 years, and GEL726 million in the first 5 years of implementation.17 \n \n30.  Development of the medium-term debt strategy under the program aims to meet the \ngovernment\u2019s public financing needs and payment obligations while minimizing long-term costs. \nThe reforms will lead to additional benefits and savings associated with fiscal discipline and with \nimprovements in core budgetary and fiscal risk management within MOF. Additional revenues of \nGEL100  million  were  realized  in  2016  from  the  recovery  of  tax  arrears,  and  increased \nintergovernmental  transfers  of  GEL65  million  were  made.  Developing  capital  markets  to \nmobilize long-term finance will spur growth and increase the efficiency of  MSMEs through \ngreater  access  to  finance,  better  gender  targeting,  and  a  stronger  regulatory  framework. \nMobilizing private resources for investment is important given the low national savings rate, \nwhich compounds the twin deficit of fiscal and external imbalances with a low reliance on \ninternal sources of financing. Implementation of the supplementary pension savings scheme is \nestimated to accumulate savings of GEL316 million in the pension fund after the first year, and \nis forecast to reach GEL16.7 billion by 2030. Such increased savings in national currency will \nsupport de-dollarization and stimulate investment for further development of capital markets. \n                                                \n15 The costs incurred to public agencies are in terms of monitoring, implementation, and enforcement, including \nexpenses associated with establishing statutory agencies, budget increases, expenditure programs, and forgone \nrevenue. Indirect fiscal costs include staff time and other expenses. \n16 MOF estimates (assuming pension rate growth indexed to inflation) \n17 Detailed analyses and cost calculations of the pension reforms are provided in the Economic and Financial \nAnalysis (accessible from the list of linked of documents in Appendix 2). ", "9 \nB.  Governance \n31.  Significant reforms have taken place to strengthen public financial management. These \ninclude  the  introduction  of  a  medium-term  budget framework,  program-based  budgeting,  a \nbudget classification system based on the IMF's Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001,18 \nand a rules-based system for fiscal transfers from the central government to local governments. \nIn addition, state financial transactions were unified under a treasury single account, and an \nelectronic budget management system was established. Problems remain, however, such as \npoor monitoring and analysis of government contingent liabilities, non-inclusion of revenues and \nexpenditure  of  some  legal  entities  of  public  law  in  budget  execution  reports,  inadequate \npredictability and transparency of intergovernmental transfers, limited internal audit capacity, \nand  weak  legislative  scrutiny  of  external  audit  reports.19 The  State  Procurement  Agency \ncontinues to improve transparency in public procurement processes by adopting international \nstandards. A new module was recently integrated into the e-procurement system, which now \nprovides for the procurement needs of multilateral development banks. The government made \nfighting high-level corruption a priority. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nwas explained to and discussed with MOF and MOESD. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n32.  The universal pension plays an important role in poverty reduction and is a valuable tool \nfor welfare distribution. Without the universal pension, the poverty rate would increase from 24% \nto 33%, and inequality would increase the Gini coefficient from 37.7 to 40.9.20 Subprogram 3 is \ncategorized effective gender mainstreaming since it takes measures against unequal access to \nassets and resources, and against insufficient attention to gender in economic development \npolicy. Pension reforms will ensure equitable treatment for men and women, allowing both to \naccumulate sufficient pension assets to have an adequate retirement income, while mitigating \nthe risk of old-age poverty through the universal pension. The Georgia Revenue Service is \nhiring  an  equal  number  of  men  and  women  as  in-house  tax  auditors.  Nationwide  public \nawareness  campaigns  conducted  on  pension  reforms  and  on  capital  market  development \nincluded gender aspects. EDA has allocated 40% of matching grants to women entrepreneurs \nfor business development. GITA has allocated funds to support private sector innovation and \ntechnology  development,  of  which  40%  are  earmarked  for  women  entrepreneurs.  The \ngovernment will implement its gender action plan, with actions to boost women\u2019s participation in \neconomic and business development.21 \n \nD.  Safeguards \n33.  Program activities are limited to policy and institutional reforms. None of the activities will \nlead  to  involuntary  resettlement,  or  affect  indigenous  peoples.  No  adverse  environmental \nimpacts were identified. The policy-based loan will not involve any construction works or have \nan  impact  on  the  environment.  The  safeguard  categories  for  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples are all C. \n \n                                                \n18 IMF. 2001.

External economic shocks experienced since early 2015\u2014from the deepening recession \nin the Russian Federation to currency devaluations in trading partner countries\u2014have created \ntrading  partner  macroeconomic  stability  risks  for  Georgia.  These  will  be  mitigated  through \nefficient public financial management, while maintaining capital expenditures and diversification \nof trade partners, including the European Union. Pressure on the widening fiscal deficit from \nincreased social expenditures and lower revenues will be reduced through the introduction of \nthe supplementary pension savings scheme. Broader access to finance for businesses and \nexport promotion is being facilitated through  EDA and GITA. Public financial management \nrelated risks are identified as weakness in monitoring of continent liabilities, unpredictable local \ngovernment  finances,  and  incomplete  coverage  of  public  finances  channeled  through  the \ntreasury  single  account.  The  risks  are  being  mitigated  with  support  from  the  program  by \nimproving MOF\u2019s reporting on contingent liabilities and its assessment of SOE fiscal risks. The \ncoverage of public finances channeled through the treasury single account has been enhanced, \nintegrating all levels of budgets and revenue generated from all public entities through user fees \nand charges into the public financial management information system. The integrated benefits \nof the program are expected to outweigh the costs. Major risks and mitigating measures are \ndescribed in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.22 \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n35.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of subprogram 3 shall conform to \nall applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the loan \ndocuments. The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for subprogram 3, \nwhich are set forth in the loan agreements. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n36.
