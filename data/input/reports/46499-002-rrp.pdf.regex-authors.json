THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nresults-based loan to Solomon Islands for the Sustainable Transport Infrastructure Improvement \nProgram. The report also describes the proposed administration of technical assistance (TA) \ngrant to be provided by the Government of Australia for Strengthening the Capacity of the \nMinistry of Infrastructure Development (MID), and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, \nacting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA.1 \n \n2.  The proposed Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance will support the Government \nof  Solomon  Islands\u2019  National  Transport  Plan  (NTP)  2010\u20132030  to  improve  access  to \nsocioeconomic  opportunities  and  promote  inclusive  growth.  The  program  is  a  nationwide \ninitiative that supports the NTP priorities from 2016 to 2020, financed through the National \nTransport Fund (NTF). The program, cofinanced by the Government of Australia, will bolster the \nefficiency and effectiveness of the multimodal transport system by improving nearly half of the \nland and maritime transport network.2 The results-based modality will align government and \ndevelopment partner support for the NTP through the NTF; incentivize increased government \ncontribution  to  the  NTF  to  mark  a  significant  shift  from  external  financing  of  transport \ninfrastructure maintenance to major rehabilitation; and improve sector performance through a \ncommon results and expenditure framework to meet longer-term development goals.  \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Strategic Context \n \n3.  Solomon Islands is a South Pacific archipelagic nation with a population of 549,600 and \na land area of about 28,000 square kilometers, comprising six large islands and dozens of \nsmaller islands, and hundreds of islets and atolls. It is categorized as a lower middle-income \ncountry with a per capita income of almost $2,000 in 2013.  \n \n4.  Economic growth and income. Economic growth was between 8% and 10% in 2010 \nand 2011, largely based on resource extraction such as forestry and mining, but decreased to \n2.8% in 2013 as these sectors declined.3 New drivers of growth are needed for the country to \nbecome more self-reliant as development assistance is also declining.4 Solomon Islands\u2019 best \ngrowth prospects lie in realizing opportunities and improving flows of people and resources in \ngeographical areas and sectors where it has a distinct advantage. Most Solomon Islanders will \ncontinue  to  rely  on  smallholder  agriculture,  so  improving  productivity  of  agriculture  and \nconnectivity is vital for incomes, food security, and livelihoods. Potential for growth also lies with \nSolomon Islands\u2019 abundant natural resources, tourism and fisheries.  \n \n5.  Status of transport infrastructure. Solomon Islands has a 1,500-kilometer (km) road \nnetwork comprising about 150 km of sealed and 1,350 km of unsealed roads, which gives 77% \nof the rural population access to an all-weather road within a 2 km radius. This suggests that the \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB provided program preparatory technical assistance.

", "2 \n \nsize of the road network, relative to both the population and national revenue, is moderately \nadequate if the network is properly maintained and is serviceable. However, at the end of \nDecember 2014, only 62% of the network was in fair to very good condition, and therefore in \nmaintainable condition.5 Road safety is also a significant issue. Of 81 wharves nationwide, 33 \nare in maintainable condition, although some require substantial repairs, and 48 are structurally \ndeficient. Roads and wharves deemed in fair or better condition can be maintained, with some \nlocalized  rehabilitation  and  major  repairs  included.  But  those  in  poor  condition  require \ncomprehensive rehabilitation to be maintainable.6 \n \n6.  Institutional capacity and financing. In addition to a deteriorating transport system, \nMID\u2019s capacity to manage and maintain infrastructure is weak and limited. Contributing factors \ninclude  high  dependency  on  external  assistance,  low  government  contributions  to  asset \nmaintenance,  high  costs  of  rehabilitation  and  maintenance  because  of  inefficiencies  and \ndiseconomies of scale, and poor cost effectiveness due to shifting priorities and timing of \ninvestments.  Poor  inter-  and  intra-island  transport  infrastructure  constrains  the  efficient \nmovement  of  goods,  capital,  and  labor,  and  affects  the  quality  and  scope  of  essential \ngovernment services. \n \n7.  Disaster and climate change vulnerabilities. Solomon Islands is ranked 6th in the \nworld in being at risk of disasters caused by extreme natural events such as cyclones, floods, \nlandslides, storm surges, earthquakes, tsunamis, and droughts.7 The country is experiencing \nhigher temperatures, changing rainfall patterns, varying frequencies of natural hazard events, \nand sea level rise. Transport infrastructure is highly vulnerable to these hazards. \n \nB.  Program Rationale \n \n8.  Solomon Islands relies on its multimodal transport system for passenger travel for social, \neducational, health, and business purposes; for transfer of goods from the outer islands to the \ncapital, Honiara, for domestic trade and export; and for interisland movement of consumer \ngoods, building material, and fuel. A good transport network generates multiple benefits of \nbetter human development outcomes and increased domestic and international trade; it also \noffers cheaper, more efficient, and more reliable access to social services, prospects of lower \nfood  costs,  and  diversification  of  agricultural  products.  Providing  safe,  resilient  transport \ninfrastructure is key to development and sustained and inclusive economic growth in Solomon \nIslands.  \n \n9.  Transport sector development is a national priority in the Solomon Islands National \nDevelopment Strategy, 2011\u20132020.8 It is also a strategic priority in ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy, 2012\u20132016 for Solomon Islands.9 The proposed program is included in ADB\u2019s country \noperations business plan, 2016\u20132018 for Solomon Islands.10  \n \n10.  Results-based lending and ADB support. The results-based lending (RBL) modality is \nproposed because (i) it aligns the support of ADB and the Government of Australia with the \nGovernment of Solomon Islands\u2019 NTP infrastructure and capacity targets to meet longer-term \ndevelopment goals; (ii) it provides a strong incentive and greater accountability to development \n                                                \n5  Road conditions are based on a scale of 1\u20135: (1) very good, (2) good, (3) fair, (4) poor, and (5) very poor; roads in \nconditions 1\u20133 are considered maintainable. \n6  Summary Sector Assessment: Transport (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n7  Alliance of Development Works. 2014.

The value added by \nADB  through  this  proposed  program  stems  from  technical  expertise,  in-country  sector \nexperience,  and  ability  to  encourage  larger  government  contributions  to  finance  asset \nmaintenance. ADB\u2019s RBL pilot and the World Bank\u2019s P4R experience highlight the importance \nof a well-focused program and strong field presence at the operational level.11 The proposed \nprogram is well defined and meets the RBL policy guidelines.12 \n \nC.  Program Scope \n \n11.  The NTP sets out the strategic objective of developing effective transport infrastructure \nand transport services, and improving the capacity of government agencies and the private \nsector for sustained economic growth and social development in Solomon Islands.13 The NTF is \ndesigned to be a sustainable mechanism to fund the development and maintenance of transport \ninfrastructure and services. Of the 1,500 km of roads, 377 bridges, and 81 wharves, NTP \ntargets rehabilitation and restoration of all infrastructure assets to maintainable conditions, and \nalso targets the proportion of regularly maintained assets in good condition to reach 100% by \n2030. \n \n12.  The proposed program will improve the transport system by using government and \ndevelopment  partner  resources,  improved  country  systems,  and  strengthened  government \nagencies to deliver transport infrastructure. It will finance, through the NTF, activities prioritized \nin the NTP\u2019s 3-year action plan (3-YAP); however, activities that would be classified as category \nA under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) or involve the procurement of goods and \nservices exceeding the monetary limits for high-value contracts, will be excluded. The scope of \nboth the NTP and the program is in Table 1.14 \n \nTable 1: Program Scope \nItem  National Transport Plan  Proposed RBL Program \nOutcome  Effective transport infrastructure and  Multimodal transport system efficiency and \nservices established.  sustainability improved. \nKey outputs  (i) Transport sector physical  (i) Transport infrastructure rehabilitated and \ninfrastructure developed and  maintained for all users, with safety, \nmaintained.  gender-responsiveness, and climate and \n  disaster resilience improved. \n(ii) Competency and capacity of  (ii) Country systems to finance and implement \ngovernment agencies improved.  the NTP strengthened. \n(iii) MID\u2019s management and supervision \ncapacity improved. \nActivity types  Develop, rehabilitate, and maintain  Rehabilitate and maintain roads, bridges, and \nroads, bridges, wharves, airfields.  wharves. \nExpenditure size  $151 million (2011\u20132030)   $79 million (2016\u20132020) \nMain financiers  Government, Asian Development  Government, Asian Development Bank, \nBank, Government of Australia  Government of Australia \nGeographic coverage  Nationwide  Nationwide \nImplementing agency  MID  MID \nImplementation period  2011\u20132030  2016\u20132020 \nMID = Ministry of Infrastructure Development, NTP = National Transport Plan, RBL = results-based lending.  \nSources: Ministry of Infrastructure Development and  Asian Development Bank. \n                                                \n11 P4R stands for \u201cprogram for results.\u201d World Bank. 2015.

The program\u2019s impact will be sustainable access to socioeconomic opportunities and \ninclusive growth. The program will cover almost 40% of the total maritime transport network and \n50% of the land transport network. The outcome will be improved multimodal transport system \nefficiency and sustainability. Details of the performance indicators and targets are included in \nthe design and monitoring framework (DMF). Selected output performance indicators are further \ndeveloped into annual disbursement-linked indicators (DLIs), to progressively achieve program \nresults. Some output indicators, which are also important for outcome achievement but difficult \nto link to disbursement, are included in the program action plan (PAP). Program outputs are: \n(i)  Output 1: Transport infrastructure rehabilitated and maintained for all users, \nwith  safety,  gender-responsiveness,  and  climate  and  disaster  resilience \nimproved. This output will (a) climate-screen, rehabilitate, and upgrade sealed \nand unsealed road networks, bridges, and wharves to maintainable condition; \n(b) ensure that transport infrastructure is designed to include safety features for \nall users, i.e., women and men and people with disabilities,  and public and \nprivate vehicles; and (c) regularly maintain transport infrastructure assets. The \noutput will upgrade and increase the proportion of roads regularly maintained \nfrom  41%  to  85%;  and  rehabilitate  and  increase  the  proportion  of  wharves \nregularly maintained from 9% to 100%.15  \n(ii)  Output  2:  Country  systems  strengthened  to  finance  and implement the \nNational Transport Plan. Gaps and weaknesses in country systems will be filled \nand strengthened. The output will (a) increase annual government contributions \nto the NTF by more than 60%; (b) update annually the NTP\u2019s 3-YAP based on \nmultiple sustainability criteria such as inclusiveness, economic effectiveness, and \naccessibility to basic services and economic opportunities; (c) improve fiduciary \ncontrols, procurement, and safeguard systems, including development, approval \nand application of the finance operating manual, and safeguards procedures \nmanual  (SPM);  (d)  improve  the  road  classification  system;  and  (e)  establish \nsystems  for  independent  safety  and  technical  audits  for  technical  quality \nassurance and cost effectiveness.  \n(iii)  Output  3:  Ministry  of  Infrastructure  Development\u2019s  management  and \nsupervision capacity strengthened. To deliver the NTP more efficiently and \neffectively, this output will support MID in (a) improving its capacity to implement \nthe NTP work program with a reduced level of TA and increased use of output-\nbased consulting services; (b) increasing staffing in core areas of procurement, \nsafeguards, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E); (c) improving efficiency and \neffectiveness  in  contracting  and  contract  management  for  maintenance  and \nrehabilitation;  and  (d)  improving  operational  and  administrative  capacity  in \nbusiness processes, including  procurement and disbursement processes and \nsafeguards, climate and disaster resilience, and safety. \n \n14.  The allocation of ADB finance and the DLIs are summarized in Table 2. Higher amounts \nare allocated to critical reform areas of quality, relevance, sector management capacity, and \nadequate financing. The Government of Australia will also use DLI 3 for its parallel cofinancing \ndisbursements. \n \n                                                \n15 The program\u2019s maintenance indicator for unsealed roads is based on the financing envelope, MID\u2019s financial \nexecution rate, and the low volume of traffic on some unsealed roads. \n ", "5 \nTable 2: Disbursement-Linked Indicators \nDisbursement  Share of Total \nAllocated   ADB Financing \nIndicator  ($ million)  (%) \nOutputs     \nOutput 1  DLI 1: Length of sealed and major unsealed roads  3.6  17.1 \n    maintained annually     \n  DLI 2: Gender-responsive design features built  1.5  7.1 \nOutput 2  DLI 3: Government contribution to the program funded  4.2  20.0 \n                             adequately     \n  DLI 4: SPM adopted and implemented, and the NTP  \n    3-YAP updated annually  3.6  17.1 \nOutput 3  DLI 5: Road network inventoried and condition surveyed  3.0  14.3 \n  DLI 6: Increased annual disbursements of the work program  3.6  17.1 \n  DLI 7: MID staff increased in key functions  1.5  7.2 \nTotal  21.0  100.0 \n3-YAP = 3-year action plan, ADB = Asian Development Bank, DLI = disbursement-linked indicator, MID = Ministry of \nInfrastructure Development, NTF = National Transport Fund, NTP = National Transport Plan, SPM = safeguards \nprocedures manual. \nNote: Numbers may not sum precisely because of rounding. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n15.

Disbursement arrangements. The loan will be disbursed over 5 years (2016-2020), \nsubject to the achievement and verification of the DLIs.17 ADB will field periodic review missions, \nincluding  validating  DLI  achievements  as  per  the  DLI  verification  protocol,  preceding  the \nsubmission  of  a  withdrawal  application  for  a  given  year.  Once  the  DLI  achievements  are \nvalidated, MID will submit withdrawal applications by January of the following year, together with \nthe DLI achievement report, to ADB through the Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MOFT). Any \nundisbursed  amount  for  unmet  DLIs  will  be  disbursed  once  the  DLIs  are  achieved.  Loan \nproceeds will be disbursed to the government\u2019s NTF, and details are outlined in the program \nfiduciary systems assessment.18 \n \n20.  The program will be leveraging the Government of Australia\u2019s planned contribution over \n5 years, and disbursement is expected to start in 2016. Of this amount, $17.7 million (A$25 \nmillion) as base contribution will be linked to the government\u2019s contribution to the NTF of SI$200 \nmillion in equal disbursements over 5 years. The remaining contribution from the Government of \nAustralia will be linked to the government increasing its contribution to the NTF to SI$280 million \nover 5 years, as outlined in the program DMF. The Government of Australia will be using the \nprogram\u2019s DMF and DLI 3 to disburse its contribution. \n \nF.  Capacity Development and Program Action Plan \n \n21.  The program will finance capacity building and system monitoring, and implementation \nsupport as well as other consulting services considered necessary to assist MID in (i) delivering \nits work program; (ii) continuing the professional development of MID staff, (iii) strengthening the \ncountry systems; and (iv) improving the skills of national consultants and the road construction \nindustry.19 MID will benefit from existing implementation arrangements, but aspects will be \nstrengthened to ensure effective delivery of the NTP targets, and disaster and climate resilience. \n                                                \n17 Disbursement-Linked Indicators, Verification Protocols, and Disbursement Schedule (accessible in Appendix 3).   \n18 Program Fiduciary Systems Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 Attached Technical Assistance and Institutional Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n ", "7 \nThe  PAP  complements  the  DLIs  and  includes  specific  technical  areas  such  as  fiduciary, \nprocurement, safeguards, and staffing and capacity development. \n \nG.  Technical Assistance \n \n22.  The TA is estimated to cost $4.5 million, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nGovernment of Australia and administered by ADB to support outputs 2 and 3 from 2016-2020. \nThis will provide targeted support for strengthening MID\u2019s capacity to deliver the NTP efficiently \nand effectively.20 This will allow continued tapering of TA support, while improving financial \nsustainability. The TA will strengthen (i) the capacity of MID\u2019s management team to manage its \nwork program, and (ii) country systems to implement the NTP work program. Emphasis is \nplaced on the quality and cost effectiveness, and value for money, of targets achieved, with \nfocus on safe, gender-responsive designs, and climate- and disaster-resilient infrastructure. The \ngovernment will support the TA with counterpart staff and office space. \n \nH.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n23.  The executing agency for the program will be MOFT. The implementing agency will be \nMID, which has extensive experience in implementing ADB and other externally funded projects. \nMID will use its existing Central Project Implementation Unit, which has expanded and has \napplied a sector approach to implement all government and externally funded projects since \n2010. The NTF board, chaired by Permanent Secretary, MOFT, will provide policy guidance and \napproval of the work plan and budgets. An existing steering committee will advise the NTF \nboard,  and  oversee  and  monitor  program  implementation,  including  technical  and  quality \nmanagement, and progress reports. For the government\u2019s Public Financial Management Act \n(PFMA) promulgated in 2013, the NTF Fund Management Regulations 2010 will apply. The \nprogram will be implemented over 51 months from June 2016 to September 2020. \n \nIII.  SUMMARY OF ASSESSMENTS \n \nA.  Program Technical Assessments \n \n24.  The sector assessment highlights the need to (i)  prioritize, rehabilitate, and restore \ndeteriorated transport infrastructure to maintainable conditions and avoid costly reconstruction; \n(ii) regularly  maintain  existing  infrastructure;  (iii)  reduce  vulnerabilities  by  improving \ninfrastructure to be safe, gender-responsive, and climate- and disaster-resilient for all users; \n(iv) increase  cost  effectiveness,  i.e.,  reduce  costs  and  improve  value  for  money;  and \n(v) strengthen systems and institutions to deliver the NTP outcomes.  \n \n25.  The program scope addresses these needs by building on previous implementation. The \nprogram will improve the multimodal transport system\u2019s performance by increasing nationwide \naccess to services, livelihood opportunities and trade measured by improvements in the time, \ncost,  and  reliability  of  travel;  increasing  the  safety,  and  climate  and  disaster  resilience  of \ninfrastructure; and strengthening institutions to provide cost-effective infrastructure. It leverages \nexisting structures and methods to implement the NTP and incentivizes government to increase \nits contribution to NTF for asset maintenance, which marks a significant shift away from external \nfinancing for transport asset maintenance. The program\u2019s implementation arrangements are \n                                                \n20 The Government of Australia\u2019s TA contribution, subject to its approval processes, is A$5.7 million (to be given in \nA$). \n ", "8 \n \nsound, the results frameworks are well designed, the DLIs are reliable indicators for program \nresults, and the expenditure framework and financing plan are robust. \n \n26.  An  economic  analysis  was  prepared  by  examining  the  benefits  and  costs  of \nrepresentative projects. The economic benefits for road projects include (i) lower operating \ncosts, (ii) shorter travel time, and (iii) reduced safety costs. For wharves they include (i) time \nsaved loading and servicing vessels, (ii) fare savings, and (iii) lower vessel operating costs. The \nanalysis  found  a  representative  road  rehabilitation  project to  be  economically  viable  at  an \neconomic internal rate of return above the opportunity cost of capital of 12% and robust to \ncondition changes.  \n \n27.  Poverty  and  gender.  The  proposed  program  will  promote  poverty  alleviation  by \nimproving access to basic social services and economic opportunities, especially in rural areas. \nThe program\u2019s emphasis on road safety, universal access, and resilience measures will also \nenhance transport access for women, children, and other disadvantaged groups. Contracts for \nlabor-based road maintenance works, which will be implemented by local community groups \nand  overseen  by  community  advisory  committees,  will  generate  significant  employment \nopportunities and increase ownership of project activities. \n \n28.  The program is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming and includes a gender \naction plan. One of the DLIs will incorporate gender-responsive features in rehabilitated roads \nand other transport subprojects, such as resting and waiting areas, safe access to water, and \nlaundry facilities. Key measures in the gender action plan also include setting up market areas \nalong selected roads for women-run businesses, employment of women contractors for labor-\nbased road maintenance, awareness-raising and training on sexual harassment for local police \nand transport operators, and collection of sex-disaggregated data for all project activities.      \n \nB.  Program Systems Assessments \n29.  Monitoring and evaluation system. The country system for M&E is centered in the \nMinistry of Development Planning and Aid Coordination, and line ministries carry out an M&E \nprocess in line with government priorities. The M&E system is mostly effective in meeting DMF \nreporting requirements. It will require strengthening in some areas under the program, mainly \nthrough managerial capacity building and in design, analysis, and reporting. \n \n30.  Fiduciary systems. The program will use the government\u2019s systems. Their strength has \nbeen assessed, including in a review of the government\u2019s public financial management systems, \nand capacity within MOFT and MID. These systems were strengthened through the new PFMA \nin 2013. The fiduciary assessment revealed pre-mitigation risks as substantial, including risks of \nvarying degrees in accounting, financial reporting, and internal control risks to the program.21 To \nmanage these risks, the PAP includes (i) annual internal audits of the NTF by MOFT\u2019s Internal \nAudit  Division,  (ii)  development  of  a  financial  management  manual,  (iii)  periodic  fiduciary \nreviews, (iv) completed recruitment for the NTF secretariat, (v) resolution of all outstanding \nexternal audit observations, (vi) training on financial management and accounting procedures, \n(vii) development of an NTF annual plan with requisite financial data in accordance with the NTF \nFund  Management  Regulations  2010,  and  (viii)  ongoing  compliance  review  of  financial \ntransactions.  \n                                                \n21 Program Fiduciary Systems Assessment, and  Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \n \n31.  Safeguard  systems.  The  program  is  category  B  for  environment  and  involuntary \nresettlement, and category C for indigenous peoples. Any activities that would be deemed \ncategory A according to the Safeguard Policy Statement are excluded from the program. The \nmajority of the program will focus on maintenance using the labor-based, equipment-supported \n(LBES) approach and machine-based maintenance works, and the remaining program will be \nrehabilitation and/or new works.  \n \n32.  A program safeguard systems assessment (PSSA) found that most program activities \nwill be small-scale works within a discreet footprint on existing rights of way, which can be \nmanaged through existing MID safeguard procedures with additional strengthening measures. \nMID includes a safeguards unit with a full-time MID staff member, an international specialist \nengaged intermittently, and four full-time national consultants. MID has adopted the SPM to \nstrengthen screening, assessment, and management of program activities based on the PSSA. \nThe PSSA has been discussed in a stakeholders\u2019 workshop and was posted on ADB\u2019s website. \n \n33.  Environment. For the program, 9 of the 11 policy principles of environment safeguards \nwill  apply,  according  to  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  For  LBES  and  machine-based \nmaintenance works, safeguard risks are considered low and can be managed with fairly simple \ntools  that  have  been  developed,  and  refined  through  use,  under  the  Transport  Sector \nDevelopment Project.22 Some rehabilitation and new works (e.g., roads and wharves) may, as a \nresult of larger scope and footprint, have impacts that will require environmental assessment. \nThe impacts of these activities, which are expected to remain category B, are also generally well \nunderstood and will be subject to environmental assessment and environmental management \nplan in compliance with the Environment Act 1998 and the Safeguard Policy Statement. The \nenvironmental management system implemented by MID has gradually improved safeguard \npractices within MID and among contractors, but some weaknesses in institutional capacity and \nthe application of procedures persist. The implementation of MID\u2019s environmental management \nsystem\u2014strengthened  further  and  updated  to  fill  the  gaps  identified  in  the  SPM\u2014will  be \nsufficient and adequate to satisfy the screening, assessment, and management of safeguards \nfor the program.  \n \n34.  Involuntary resettlement. The program comprises mostly works that will be undertaken \nwithin existing rights of way. While not expected to involve physical displacement of people, \nsome activities may require use of land outside the existing corridor (for temporary access or for \nwidening of infrastructure) resulting in minor socioeconomic impacts. The PSSA has assessed \nthat the current practice of voluntary agreements with landowners for temporary land access is \nreasonable, and recommended to strengthen the process as well as the institutional capacity.  \n \n35.  Indigenous peoples. The due diligence under the project preparatory TA has assessed \nthat while tribes and clans reside in the program areas, their institutions are not distinct from \nmainstream Melanesian society, and these groups are not vulnerable. As sociocultural groups \nneed to be both distinct and vulnerable for the Safeguard Policy Statement requirements to \napply, the program is proposed as category C. The program will ensure that local communities \nactively participate in program activities and receive culturally appropriate benefits. \n \n                                                \n22 For LBES works, these include environmental health and safety guidelines, and checklists included in the contract, \ncontractor awareness training, and compliance monitoring with guidelines. For machine-based maintenance works, \nthe contractor is required to prepare and implement a site-specific construction environmental management plan. \n ", "10 \n \nC.
