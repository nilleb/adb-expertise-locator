As  legislative  and  regulatory  reforms  are being made  to  enable \nErdenes Mongol to manage the state-owned assets more effectively to benefit the welfare of all \nMongolian people, the project provides essential capacity development support to help Erdenes \nMongol  fulfill  its  evolving  mandate  of  managing  various  state-owned  assets  and  investing  in \ninfrastructure to support Mongolia\u2019s economic diversification.   \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \n3. \nMongolia\u2019s economy relies heavily on the mining sector, which accounts for 20% of the \ngross  domestic  product. 2  This  heavy  dependence  has  made  the  country  economically \nvulnerable  to  volatility  in  the  international  commodity  market.  At  the  same  time,  strategic \ninvestment  in  important  economic  infrastructure  is  necessary  if  Mongolia  is  to  succeed  in  its \neffort  to  diversify  its  economy.  Given  a  large  land  area  with  small  and  dispersed  population, \ninadequate transport infrastructure is a critical obstacle to national unity and export growth. Yet, \nMongolia  does  not  have  an  effective  mechanism  to  channel  funds  raised  from  its  natural \nresources  to  strategic  investments  necessary  for  the  development  and  diversification  of  the \neconomy.  The  national  development  strategy  for  2008\u20132021  identified  this  as  a  crucial \neconomic  challenge  and  since \nthen  efforts  have  been  continued  under  successive \ngovernments.3  \n \n4. \nIn Mongolia, the government plays an important role in investing in key economic areas. \nThe government  needs to  ensure that the  economic  benefits  derived from the  development  of \nthe  country\u2019s  mineral  resources  are  effectively  invested  to  generate  sustainable  returns,  while \nsupporting  national  unity  and  economic  diversification.  Good  governance  is  required  for  the \nstate\u2019s  investment  and  management  of  assets  to  be  effective.  Good  governance  demands \nefficiency,  accountability,  and  transparency.  Information  on  the  processes  and  results  of  state \ninvestment  decision-making  needs  to  be  made  public.  Moreover,  if  the  state  engages  in \ninvestment  activities,  its  role  as  a  regulator  needs  to  be  clearly  separated  from  its  role  as  an \ninvestor to avoid conflicts of interest and ensure fairness and equality in the market.  \n \n5. \nThe  government  created  the  100%  state-owned  Erdenes  Mongol  in  2007  to  manage \nstate-owned  assets  and  make  state  investments  more  strategic  and  effective. 4  Erdenes \nMongol\u2019s  portfolio  has  grown  from  holding  shares  of  one  mining  company  in  2010  to  four \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  second-largest  component  is  wholesale and  retail,  which accounts  for  17%.  Government  of  Mongolia.  2013. \n\nAchieving Millennium Development Goal: Fifth Progress Report. Ulaanbaatar. \n\n3  Government of Mongolia. 2008. Comprehensive National Development Strategy of Mongolia. Ulaanbaatar. \n4   The  company  had  a  staff  of  68  as  of  2015.  It  comprised  a  chief  executive  office,  with  responsibilities  for  human \nresource  management  and  legal  matters;  an  infrastructure  management  department;  a  project  management \ndepartment; and a finance and accounting department that handles financial analysis and financial management. \nErdenes Mongol held about MNT 2.4 trillion ($1.2 billion) in assets, as of 2015, including non-mining and mining \nassets. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n2 \n \n\ncompanies by 2015.5 While government line ministries focus on policies and regulations in the \nsectors  in  which  the  state  invests,  Erdenes  Mongol  aims  to  manage  state-owned  assets  and \nraise  funds  to  invest  in  economic  infrastructure  for  the  benefit  of  the  general  public.  Its \nestablishment aimed at the bifurcation of the state\u2019s dual roles of regulator and investor, which \nis  a  prerequisite  to  achieving  good  governance.  Erdenes  Mongol  is  evolving  into  managing \nvarious  state-owned  assets  in  both mining  and  non-mining  sectors,  and  investing  in  economic \ninfrastructure to enhance economic diversification.6  \n \nHowever, Erdenes Mongol has not fully realized its potential in generating revenues and \n6. \neffectively  leveraging  funds  for  further  investments.  Its  functionality,  efficiency,  and  profitability \nhave been limited by various constraints. Under the legal framework which originally established \nErdenes Mongol, the company was treated as a public agency even though it is an investment \ncompany with its own budget, which is independent from the state budget. In addition, Erdenes \nMongol did not have the authority to retain dividends from its investee companies; until recent \namendment, the Human Development Fund, created in 2009, was the recipient of the dividends. \nIts status as a public agency also left it with limited managerial flexibility, and its compensation \nstructure  could  not  attract  or  retain  competent  professionals.  The  public  sector  requirements \nimposed on it also meant that it would take longer to process procurement or investments than it \nwould as a commercial entity.  \n \nIn February 2016, the Parliament approved the amendments to the Human Development \n7. \nFund  Law,  authorizing  Erdenes  Mongol  to  retain  dividends  from  its  investee  companies. \nFurthermore,  under  the  amended  law,  the  Charter  of  Erdenes  Mongol,  which  was  originally \nbased  on  the  State  and  Local  Property  Law,  is  being  revised  based  on  the  Company  Law.7 \nThese developments in the legal framework will strengthen Erdenes Mongol\u2019s financial position, \nand allow it to operate its business as a commercial entity. Based on the Company Law and its \nrevised Charter, Erdenes Mongol\u2019s governance structure will also be reformed. It will have three \nindependent directors in its nine-member board of directors. The board of directors will have the \nauthority  to  appoint  the  executive  director  (i.e.,  the  chief  executive  officer),  in  contrast  to  the \nearlier  arrangement  that  the  chief  executive  officer  of  Erdenes  Mongol  was  appointed  by  the \ngovernment. This reform will improve transparency in management and allow Erdenes Mongol \nto be managed commercially with little political interference in future. \n \n8. \nThe  approval  of  the  amendments  to  the  Human  Development  Fund  Law  also  calls  for \nurgent  and  substantial  improvement  of  Erdenes  Mongol\u2019s  institutional  and  management \ncapacities  to  fulfill  its  evolving  mandate.  Currently,  Erdenes  Mongol  does  not  have  a  clear \ncorporate strategy with medium and long-term targets. It also does not have sufficient capacity \nto  identify  investment  opportunities  that  are  appropriate  to  support  the  country\u2019s  economic \ndiversification with adequate attention to environmental management.  \n \n9. \n\nThe  company\u2019s  corporate  structure  must  be  reformed  to  ensure  sound  governance, \n\n                                                 \n5  In 2010, Erdenes Mongol was made responsible for 100% of shares of Erdenes Tavan Tolgoi, which operates a \nstrategic  mineral  asset  in  Mongolia.  As  of  January  2016,  in  addition  to  Erdenes  Tavan  Tolgoi,  Erdenes  Mongol \nholds  shares  in  the  following  three  mining  companies  as  the  majority  shareholder:  Shivee  Ovoo  (90%  of  the \nshares),  Banganuur  (75%  of  the  shares),  and  Erdenes  Mining  Corporation  (51%  of  the  shares).  As  a  minor \nshareholder,  Erdenes  Mongol  also  holds  34%  shares  of  Oyu  Tolgoi  that  operates  a  strategic  mineral  asset  of \nMongolia.    \n\n6  Khazanah of Malaysia is a similar strategic company owned by the government. \n7  The amendments to Human Development Fund Law have been approved, and the amended Human Development \nFund Law will be renamed as the Future Heritage Fund Law. The revised Charter of Erdenes Mongol will become \neffective in 2016, and it will be authorized to retain dividends from investee companies from 2017. \n\n\f        3 \n \n\nthe \n\nfor  2014\u20132016 \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nprudent  risk  management,  and  efficient  administration. 8 It  needs  to  adopt  the  management \nstructure  in  line  with  its  business  functions  to  analyze  business  risks  and  opportunities,  and \nmake  strategic  investment  decisions.  It  also  needs  to  develop  corporate  functions  to  provide \nlegal,  economic,  and  market  analyses  and  information  to  support  the  efficient  and  effective \nfunctioning of the management. While currently Erdenes Mongol\u2019s financial investment and risk \ndivision  in  its  finance  and  accounting  department  can  only  carry  limited  financial  analysis,  the \ncompany  must  develop  its  asset  and  liability  management  capacity  to  ensure  prudent  risk \nmanagement.  Strengthening \nfinancial  management  and  social  and  environment \nmanagement  capacity  is  also  essential  for  sound  corporate  governance  and  compliance \nmanagement.  For  efficient  administration,  functions  such  as  human  resources  management \nneed  to  be  improved.  It  is  also  necessary  to  establish  clear  business  processes  to  promote \nefficient use of financial and human resources.  \n \nThe  interim  country  partnership  strategy  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for \n10. \nMongolia \nidentified  economic  diversification  as  a  major  medium-term \ndevelopment  challenge  facing  the  country.  It  also  stressed  the  importance  of  efficient  public \nsector management and the establishment of a sovereign wealth fund.9 Strengthening Erdenes \nMongol\u2019s  institutional  framework  and  management  capacity  will  significantly  contribute  to  the \neffective management of Mongolia\u2019s state-owned assets and making sound investments for the \ndiversification of the national economy.  \n \nB. \n \n11. \nThe impact of the project will be the effective management and use of Mongolia\u2019s state-\nowned  assets  for  the  benefit  of  the  country\u2019s  people.  The  expected  outcome  is  Erdenes \nMongol\u2019s capacity developed for its envisaged development. \n \nC. \n \n12. \nThe project will provide for capacity development and advisory services to deliver three \nintended  outputs.  It  will  not  prepare  feasibility  studies  or  a  detailed  engineering  design  of  an \ninvestment project. \n \n13. \nOutput  1:  Corporate  strategy  developed.  The project  will  analyze  the new  legal  and \nbusiness  framework  to  assess  the  changing  business  environment  and  determine  the  best \nstrategy  for  Erdenes  Mongol  to  adopt  for  its  operations.  This  will  include  examination  of  the \npotential for  new  fund-raising  schemes  and  possibilities  for  holding state-owned  enterprises  in \nthe  non-mining  sector.  The  project  will  also  conduct  a  detailed  institutional  analysis  of  the \ncompany and will help develop a corporate strategy to identify its midterm and long-term targets \nand milestones.   \n \n14. \nOutput  2:  Functional  capability  strengthened.  To  strengthen  Erdenes  Mongol\u2019s \nmanagement  capacity,  the  project  will  help  establish  three  management  groups  within  the \ncompany  and  hire  high-level  management  consultants  to  engage  in  these  groups  for  a \ntransitional period of about 2 years. An advisory experts group, a strategy and risk management \ngroup,  and  an  executive  management  recruitment  group  will  strengthen  the  management \nsystem and will play critical roles in helping managers make investment decisions and ensuring \n\nOutputs \n\n                                                 \n8  The  functional  capacity  of  Erdenes  Mongol  was  assessed  based  on  its  financial  management,  procurement, \n\nbusiness practices, organizational structure and close consultation with its management.  \n\n9 ADB. 2014.

The \nproject will also help Erdenes Mongol strengthen its existing functions: (i) financial management; \n(ii)  human  resources  management;  (iii)  public  relations;  and  establish  new  functions;  (iv) \nenvironment and social management; (v) supply chain management; and (vi) asset and liability \nmanagement.  It  will  assist  Erdenes  Mongol  in  the  hiring  and  retention  of  middle-level \nmanagement  consultants  for  these  operations  for  the  transitional  period.  Improvements  in \nfinancial  management  will  cover  reporting,  accounting,  auditing,  internal  control,  and  the \nfacilitation of external auditing by an audit firm.  \n \n15. \nThe project will also help Erdenes Mongol review and reform its business processes to \nmake  them  more  efficient  and  enable  the  company  to  expand  its  businesses.  The  project  will \nsupport  its  capacity  development  during  the  transitional  period  by  providing  Erdenes  Mongol \nwith the necessary training at various stages of reform for (i) senior management, (ii) unit heads, \nand  (iii)  general  staff.  The  project  will  assess  and  strengthen  the  existing  management \ninformation system (MIS) as it relates to supply chain management, project management, and \nfinancial management.  \n \n16. \nOutput  3:  Investment  capability  strengthened. The project will help Erdenes Mongol \ndevelop  its  ability  to  diversify  its  asset  base  to  increase  investments  in  infrastructure  that \nMongolia  needs  to  support  overall  economic  diversification.  This  will  include  the  capacity  to \nidentify  sound,  appropriate  investment  opportunities  and  conduct  due  diligence.  These  will  be \nachieved  by  providing  the  company  with  advisory  and  capacity  development  consulting \nservices.  The  project  will  also  help  to  identify  state-owned  assets  for  potential  acquisition  and \nconduct an institutional and legal assessment of the possibility of Erdenes Mongol holding non-\nmining assets. \n \nD. \n \n17. \n \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $41.2 million (Table 1). \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan ($ million) \n\nItem \nA.  \n\nBase Costb \n1.

It  also  explores  opportunities  for  strengthening  its  financial \ncapacity and expanding its investments in the non-mining sector and other assets.  \n \n23. \nThe  project  will  strengthen  Erdenes  Mongol\u2019s  institutional  framework  and  management \ncapacity,  which  will  make  it  better  able  to  manage state-owned  assets  and  invest  strategically \nand  effectively.  This  is  necessary  to  help  Mongolia  enhance  its  investment  in  economic \ninfrastructure  and  diversify  the  economy.  The  project  will  support  Erdenes  Mongol  to  play  an \nimportant  role  in  leveraging  additional  funds  for  these  types  of  investment.  As  an  investment \ncompany  with  a  strong financial  base  and  greater  expertise,  it  will  be  in  a  better  position than \nthe government to make investments on behalf of the state and to manage state-owned assets \nefficiently. As a state-owned enterprise, Erdenes Mongol can also take a longer-term view than \na  private  company  may  possibly  have,  and  this  is  particularly  important  to  ensure  that  the \ncountry\u2019s natural resources are managed with long-term strategic objectives in mind.  \n\n\f        7 \n \n\n \n24. \nThe  project\u2019s  improvement  of  Erdenes  Mongol  capacity  will  yield  direct  economic \nbenefits. The company will be able to manage its existing assets better at a reduced cost. In the \nshort-term, Erdenes Mongol is expected to make investments financed by the below mentioned \ntoll  road  revenues,  and  a  management  fee  and  dividends  from  its  investee  companies.  The \nimproved  management  of  Erdenes  Mongol  would  boost  the  performance  of  its  investee \ncompanies,  which  will  improve  its  own  financial  position.  The  improved  financial  position  with \nstrengthened  financial  strategies  will  help  Erdenes  Mongol  leverage  more  funds  to  further \nexpand  its  investment  in  the  medium  and  long  term.  This  will  enable  the  company  to  make \neffective  new  investments  in  areas  such  as  basic  infrastructure  and  transport  that  are  key  to \nMongolia\u2019s efforts to diversify the economy. Strengthening transport, especially by rail, is crucial \nto  meet  the  landlocked  country\u2019s  need  to  expand  its  exports.  Better  internal  and  external \ntransport  connectivity  will  also  spur  economic  growth  in  cities  and  regions  beyond  the  major \nurban center and capital, Ulaanbaatar. Economic growth and diversification supported by future \nErdenes Mongol investment will help raise the living standards of Mongolia\u2019s people. \n \n An ADB financial analysis of Erdenes Mongol reviewed its past and projected financials. \n25. \nThe  company\u2019s  audited  financials  for  the  years  of  2012,  2013,  and  2014  show  annual \noperations losses. The losses grew in 2014 due to the addition of a toll road asset that was only \ngradually  increasing  its  revenue  base  while  incurring  full  operational  costs.  Erdenes  Mongol\u2019s \ncharter  allows  it  to  charge  a  management  fee  of  3%  of  operating  costs  to  its  investee \ncompanies, but it has not been charged yet. Erdenes Mongol plans to charge the management \nfee from 2016. \n \nThe  legislation  has  been  finalized  for  the  proposed  legal  change  to  provide  Erdenes \n26. \nMongol  with  a  new  source  of  revenues  that  it  has  so  far  been  denied\u2014dividends  from  the \ncompanies  in  which  it  holds  investments  (para.  7).  Because  revenues  from  dividends  will \ndepend  on  the  performance  of  the  investee  companies,  the  conservative  scenario  in  ADB\u2019s \nfinancial  analysis  removed  these  sources  from  cash  flows.  In  addition,  ADB  analysis \nconservatively  adjusted  projected  toll  road  revenues  downward  by  50%  to  reflect  current \nvolatility  in  the  commodities  cycles.  Nonetheless,  the  resulting  projected  cash  flows  remained \nadequate  to  meet  Erdenes  Mongol\u2019s  debt  servicing  requirements,  including  those  for  the  ADB \nproject  loan.  To  ensure  financial  sustainability,  ADB  has  proposed  loan  covenants  to  require \nspecific  debt  service  coverage,  debt-to-equity,  and  operating  ratios.  The  sovereign  guarantee \nalso provides overall assurance that the loan will be repaid.  \n \nB. \n \n27. \nErdenes Mongol has a finance and accounting department and a separate internal audit \nunit with adequately qualified staff members who are either accountants or investment officers. \nThey  have  appropriate  experience  of  about  3  years  on  average  in  accounting  and/or \ncommercial  investment  firms.  The  company  prepares  its  accounts  in  accordance  with \nMongolia\u2019s national accounting laws and rules, established by the Ministry of Finance. Based on \nthe  ministry\u2019s  guidance  for  state-owned  enterprises,  Erdenes  Mongol  developed  its  own \naccounting policies and procedures. It has its annual financial statements prepared and audited \nin  accordance  with  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards.  The  finance  and  accounting \ndepartment has a staff of 13, which is generally adequate for dealing with the company\u2019s current \nbusinesses,  but  would  be  too  small  for  additional  externally  funded  projects.  The  staff  has  no \nexperience in implementing ADB-funded projects.  \n \n28. \n\nADB\u2019s financial management assessment showed that Erdenes Mongol will need help to \n\nGovernance \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n8 \n \n\nimplement  the  project.  This  support  will  include  a  financial  management  specialist  to  be \nengaged in the PIU staff and an audit specialist for external auditing of the project. The project \nwill also provide guidance and training for Erdenes Mongol and PIU staff on ADB guidelines and \nprocedures for (i) financial management and reporting; (ii) budget preparation and oversight; (iii) \ndisbursement;  (iv)  the  financial  audit  process  and  requirements;  and  (v)  proper  use  of,  and \naccounting for, the imprest accounts and the statement of expenditure.  \n \n29. \nThe  strengthening  of  Erdenes  Mongol\u2019s  overall  financial  management  systems  is  a \nmajor  project  component  and  is  needed  to  position  the  company  to  expand  its  activities.  This \nfinancial  management  component  will  focus  on  (i)  accounting  policies  and  procedures  for \nInternational Financial Reporting Standards; (ii) institutional arrangements for good governance; \n(iii) internal oversight and governance capacity, including stronger internal auditing; (iv) external \noversight  capacity  for  external  audit  and  full  compliance  with  the  International  Standards  of \nAuditing;  and  (v)  upgraded  MIS  and  information  and  communication  technology  systems  to \naccommodate the reformed financial management processes. ADB\u2019s assessment found that the \nproject\u2019s  pre-mitigation  financial  management  risk  was  moderate  and  would  be  adequately \nmitigated through the measures planned under this project component. \n \n30. \nPublic  procurement  in  Mongolia  is  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  country\u2019s  public \nprocurement  law,  which  requires  the  use  of  open  competitive  tendering  and  conflicts  in  no \nfundamental way with ADB\u2019s consultants\u2019 and procurement guidelines. The basic principles and \nrequirements  are  largely  the  same.  Mongolia  has  promulgated  the  Anticorruption  Law,  related \nregulations,  and  anti-fraud  measures  in  public  procurement.  Erdenes  Mongol  has  a  full-time \nprocurement specialist and about 10 related technical staff, as well as experience in managing \nprojects  supported  by  multilateral  and  bilateral  development  partners.  The  project  will \nstrengthen Erdenes Mongol\u2019s capacity in procurement in terms of efficiency and governance. It \nwill  also  support  the  engagement  by  the  PIU  specialists  to  support  the  recruitment  and \nprocurement activities and ensure smooth implementation. Because these mitigating actions will \nreduce the potential risk for project procurement issues, this risk is considered to be low. \n \n31. \nThe  government  recognizes  the  risk  of  corruption  in  the  public  sector  and  established \nthe  Mongolian  Anticorruption  Agency  in  2004  specifically  to  fight  corruption  at  all  levels  of \ngovernment. The agency\u2019s work includes oversight of the management of public expenditures, \nincluding those for procurement. Members of the selection committee for procurement sign the \nnotice of the procurement for conflict of interest. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended \nto  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  Erdenes  Mongol  during  the  project  preparation. \nThe  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  PAM \n(footnote 10).  \n \nC. \n \n32. \nThe  project  will  provide  the  capacity  development  and  advisory  services  for  Erdenes \nMongol. It is not expected to have a direct impact on poverty and social issues, but would have \nan  indirect  impact  on  poverty.  Improving  the  management  of  state-owned  assets  and  state \ninvestment  will  help  diversify  Mongolia\u2019s  economy,  which,  in  turn,  would  improve  the  overall \nwelfare  of  the  poor.  The  project  will  also  strengthen  the  company\u2019s  public  relations,  which  will \nimprove  its  communications  with  stakeholders,  communities,  and  such  groups  as  nonprofit \norganizations.  \n \n33. \nADB  has  classified  the  project  as  some  gender  elements.  It  will  provide  capacity \ndevelopment support for female and male Erdenes Mongol staff and ensure that the women on \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n\f        9 \n \n\n \n\nSafeguards \n\nthe  staff  benefit  from  this  support  equally  with  the  men.  It  will  provide  a  session  targeted  at \nfemale staff to enhance career development. The project will also develop a module on how to \nintegrate  the  gender  perspective  into  investment  decision  making  processes  including  simple \ngender analysis tools.  \n \nD. \n \n34. \nEnvironment. The project is classified as category C for environment, since no adverse \nenvironmental  impacts  are  expected  from  the  project,  which  will  not  result  in  an  investment \nproject.  The  project  will  have  positive  environmental  benefits.  It  will  establish  a  social  and \nenvironment  management  unit  in  Erdenes  Mongol  to  ensure  that  the  company  complies  with \nrelated laws and regulations. It will further help Erdenes Mongol develop its internal guidelines \non  environmental  and  social  safeguards  by  establishing  an  environment  and  social \nmanagement  system  meant  to  ensure  continued  compliance  with  Mongolia\u2019s  environmental \nstandards  and  to  make  the  company\u2019s  future  investments  environmentally  and  socially \nsustainable. In addition, the project will develop and implement a capacity development plan for \nErdenes  Mongol\u2019s  staff  to  strengthen  the  company\u2019s  environmentally  and  socially  sustainable \ndevelopment knowledge. \n \n35. \nland acquisition nor resettlement. \n \n36. \nIndigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  C  for  indigenous  peoples. \nThe assessment determined that the project will not affect ethnic minority communities directly \nor indirectly. \n \nE. \n\nResettlement. The project\u2019s involuntary resettlement category is C. It will require neither \n\nRisk and Mitigating Measures \n\nUnder  the  amended  Human  Development  Fund  Law,  approved  in  February  2016,  the \n37. \nCharter  of  Erdenes  Mongol  is  being  revised  based  on  the  Company  Law.  The  approved  legal \nreform  strengthens  Erdenes  Mongol\u2019s  legal  status,  and  reduces  political  influence  on  its \noperations and associated risks. The integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh \nthe  costs.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.11  \n \n\nTable 4. Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \n\nPolitical uncertainty in \nMongolia could affect the \nproject. \n\nMitigating Measures \nErdenes Mongol was established in 2007 for strategic management \nof state-owned assets for the benefit of all people in the country. \nGiven that it has been supported by successive governments since \nthen, its sustainability is not considered to be an issue as to which \npolitical party will be in power. In addition, under the revised HDFL, \nthe Charter of Erdenes Mongol is being revised based on the \nCompany Law, which will change the authority of appointment of the \nexecutive director from the government to the board of directors of \nErdenes Mongol. The board of directors will also include three \nindependent directors in its nine members. These reforms further \nreduce political influence on Erdenes Mongol\u2019s operations.  \nThe project will train the executing and implementing agencies and \nPIU staff who will assume day-to-day management of the project in \n\nLack of familiarity with ADB \nprocedures could delay project \n\n                                                 \n11 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n10 \n \n\nimplementation. \n\nLimited staffing in the \nimplementing agencies may \ndelay loan disbursement. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, HDFL = Human Development Fund law, PIU = project implementation unit. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nthe procurement, disbursement, and financial management \nrequirements of applicable ADB guidelines, policies, and regulations.  \nA  PIU  will  be  established  to  carry  out  day-to-day  project  activities, \nincluding  financial  management  and  procurement.
