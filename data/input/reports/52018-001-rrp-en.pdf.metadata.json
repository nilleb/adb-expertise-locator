It is taking important steps to improve disaster \nand climate risk management\u2014to reduce risks from, better plan for, respond to, and recover from \ndisasters.  The  proposed  program  will  provide  the  Government  of  Palau  with  rapid  access  to \nfinancing  if  a  significant  disaster  caused  by  any  type  of  natural  hazard  affects  the  country.2 A \nsingle-tranche, stand-alone, policy-based loan (PBL) from the regular ordinary capital resources \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is proposed to provide Palau with a source of contingent \nfinancing  for  immediate  disaster  response,  early  recovery,  and  reconstruction. 3 To  establish \neligibility to access the contingent financing, the government has undertaken policy actions that \n(i) strengthen policies and institutions for disaster and climate resilience, (ii) improve capacity and \nplanning  for  disaster  and  climate  risk  management,  and  (iii)  expand  financing  for  disaster  and \nclimate risk management. The actual withdrawal of funds will be deferred until the President of \nPalau declares a state of emergency because a disaster caused by a natural hazard has occurred. \nProgram monitoring will ensure continued progress toward the overall goals. \n \n\n \nA. \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\n3. \nDevelopment  context.  Palau  consists  of  about  370  islands  covering  466  square \nkilometers and has a population of around 21,500 (2016). Palau\u2019s free association with the United \nStates has contributed to its relative affluence\u2014its per capita gross domestic product (GDP) of \n$17,096 (FY2017) is one of the highest in the Pacific. However, Palau depends heavily on grants, \nwhich accounted for  18.5%  of GDP  and 43.7% of  total  revenue  during FY2011\u2013FY2017.4 The \neconomy is narrowly based, and tourism receipts generally contribute 45%\u201355% of annual GDP. \n \n4. \nPalau experiences frequent natural hazards (mainly typhoons, droughts, and tidal surges), \nwhich can result in human casualties, disrupt economic activity, lead to loss of livelihoods, divert \nfiscal resources, and undermine development priorities. Although not all disasters are caused by \nclimate change, the country\u2019s vulnerability to climate change will heighten disaster risks because \nextreme weather events are likely to increase in the future.5 Analysis undertaken under the Pacific \nCatastrophe  Risk  Assessment  and  Financing  Initiative  indicates  that  Palau  faces  an  average \nannual loss of $2.7 million from typhoons, earthquakes, and tsunamis, with probable maximum \nlosses of $16.8 million from a 1-in-50-year event, $46.7 million from a 1-in-100-year event, and \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.

Palau has suffered three major disasters caused by natural hazards \nsince  2012,  leading  to  significant  financial  stress.  In  2012,  Typhoon  Bopha  caused  about \n$5.9 million  in  initial  damages  (2.7%  of  GDP),  but  the  final  damage  estimate  was  raised  to \n$15 million\u2013$20 million (7.0%\u20139.3% of GDP).7 In 2013, initial damage from Typhoon Haiyan was \nassessed to be $6.3 million (2.8% of GDP), with the final damage estimated at $9.7 million (4.3% \nof  GDP). 8 In  2016,  severe  drought  associated  with  El  Ni\u00f1o  weather  conditions  led  to  water \nshortages  across  Palau,  and  generated  significant  sanitation  and  hygiene  risks.  Government \nestimates  placed  financing  needs  at  $3.2  million  (1.1%  of  GDP)  in  FY2016,  mainly  for  water \nacquisition and distribution. Drought conditions persisted into 2017, leading to continued water \nrationing.  The  drought  also  led  to  the  closure  of  Jellyfish  Lake,  a  major  tourist  attraction. \nConsequently, real GDP growth is estimated to have fallen to \u20133.7% in FY2017 as tourist arrivals \ndeclined. Tourism receipts fell from a peak of $138.9 million in FY2015 to $115.7 million in FY2017. \n \nKey  constraints.  Insufficient  fiscal  resources  constrained  disaster  response,  recovery, \n6. \nand reconstruction.9 In the absence of dedicated resources to finance post-disaster needs, the \ngovernment relied largely on budget reallocations, which redirected funds away from development \npriorities and fell short of the initially assessed damages. Short-term post-typhoon needs were \nfinanced  by  emergency  appropriations  from  internal  revenue,  authorized  through  legislation \napproved by the President. The government authorized $10 million but appropriated $5 million \nunder  the  Super  Typhoon  Bopha  Emergency  Funding  Act  in  2012,  financed  from  internal \nrevenue.10 Almost  $1.5 million  was appropriated  under the  Super Typhoon Haiyan  Emergency \nFunding  Act  in  2013,  also  financed  from  internal  revenue.11 The  government  appropriated  $2 \nmillion  in  emergency  funding  for  severe  drought  relief  under  the  Extreme  Drought  Emergency \nFunding Act in 2016, of which about $1.65 million was drawn from the General Fund Reserve \n(GFR) (para. 15).12 Palau received support from development partners following the typhoons,13 \nand longer-term reconstruction activities were also funded under the government budget. \n \n7. \nInadequate community-based planning and preparedness (including coping mechanisms, \npublic awareness, and emergency response capacity) affected disaster response and recovery \n(footnotes  7  and  8).  Weaknesses  in  institutional  arrangements  and  donor  coordination14 also \nexacerbated the indirect economic and social costs of disasters. \n \n8. \nFiscal  situation.  Despite  these  development  challenges,  Palau  has  largely  maintained \nmacroeconomic  stability.  External  public  debt,  estimated  at  34.2%  of  GDP  in  FY2017,  is \nsustainable  over  the  medium  term  as  the  government  pursues  fiscal  consolidation  measures \n\n                                                \n6  Pacific  Catastrophe  Risk  Assessment  and  Financing \n\nInitiative.  2011.

However,  the  debt  situation  remains  highly  sensitive  to  real  GDP  growth  shocks, \nsuch  as  those  that  Palau  could  experience  if  affected  by  a  major  disaster.  The  International \nMonetary Fund recommends that Palau boost its resilience to disasters and climate change.15 \n \nB. \n\nPolicy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n\n9. \nGovernment vision. The Government of Palau is committed to managing disaster risks. \nThe National Disaster and Risk Management Framework 2010 (NDRMF)16 sets out a vision of \n\u201csafe,  resilient  and  prepared  communities  in  Palau.\u201d  The  key  objectives  of  the  NDRMF  are  to \n(i) establish  organizational  arrangements  that  maximize  the  use  of  available  resources  to \nstrengthen  mitigation,  preparedness,  response,  and  relief  and  recovery  planning  for  natural \nhazards; (ii) promote integrated planning and collaboration for disaster risk management (DRM) \nacross all levels of government, departments, sectors, and communities; and (iii) integrate climate \nchange adaptation and disaster management  into national and sectoral planning and strategy. \nThe NDRMF draws special attention to women in livelihood recovery and to strengthening DRM \nfor local communities. \n \n10. \nThe  NDRMF  outlines  the  institutional  arrangements for  its  implementation. The  highest \nauthority is the Disaster Executive Council, which is convened and chaired by the President of \nPalau,  with  all  ministers  as  members.  The  second  tier  is  the  National  Emergency  Committee \n(NEC), convened by the vice president, comprising 28 members from various ministries, bureaus, \ndivisions,  and  agencies.  The  NEC  provides  oversight,  coordination,  and  guidance  on  DRM \nactivities. The National Emergency Management Office (NEMO) acts as the secretariat for the \nNEC, and is involved in all aspects of NDRMF implementation. \n \n11. \nIn  2015,  the  government  adopted  the  Palau  Climate  Change  Policy  for  Climate  and \nDisaster Resilient Low Emissions Development 2015 (PCCP) to lay out its overarching vision.17 \nThe PCCP objectives reiterate and expand on those in the NDRMF. Its main objective is to build \nthe resilience of Palau to climate change and disasters. Additional objectives are to (i) enhance \nadaptation  and  resilience  to  the  expected  impacts  of  global  climate  change  across  sectors; \n(ii) improve  Palau\u2019s  ability  to  manage  unexpected  disasters  and  minimize  disaster  risk;  and \n(iii) mitigate  global  climate  change  by  working  toward  low-carbon  emission  development, \nmaximizing energy efficiency, protecting carbon sinks, and minimizing greenhouse gas emissions. \nThe  PCCP  advocates  a  proactive  approach to  community-level  DRM,  to  build  knowledge  and \nunderstanding of the hazards and risks to which communities may be exposed. \n \nThe  PCCP  sets  out  an  ambitious  5-year  action  plan  for  implementation.  It  covers \n12. \ninterventions across four strategic priorities: (i) climate change adaptation, (ii) DRM, (iii) mitigation \nand \ninstitutional  strengthening  for  effective  policy \nimplementation.  It  also  outlines  individual  reform  actions  to  be  undertaken  under  the  broader \ninterventions. The Office of Climate Change in the Ministry of Finance (MOF) coordinates PCCP \nimplementation and monitoring. \n \nDeclaration of emergency. The President of Palau may declare a state of emergency in \n13. \nthe event of war, external aggression, civil rebellion, or natural catastrophe threatening the lives \nor property of a significant number of people in Palau, in accordance with Article VIII, Section 14 \n                                                \n15 International Monetary Fund. 2016.

Koror. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nof  the  Palau  Constitution.18 The  NDRMF  clarifies  the  declaration  procedure  in  the  event  of  a \ndisaster triggered by a natural catastrophe. The NEC can recommend to the President, through \nthe Disaster Executive Council, to declare a state of emergency in all or part of the affected or \npotentially affected areas. The recommendation is based on reliable information received from a \nverifiable  source  such  as  the  weather  service,  an  aerial  reconnaissance,  and/or  significant \nemergency impact reports. The declaration has to be confirmed by the Palau National Congress \nwithin 10 days if it is to continue beyond the initial 10-day period.19 In the event of an emergency, \nNEMO coordinates disaster response and recovery, acting under the oversight of the NEC, in all \nor part of the affected or potentially affected areas of Palau. Also, state governors can declare a \nstate of emergency covering only their state. \n \n14. \nThe President of Palau has declared three states of emergency due to natural hazards \nsince 2012\u2014after Typhoon Bopha in 2012, Typhoon Haiyan  in 2013, and the drought in 2016 \n(para. 5). In addition, the governor of Koror has twice declared a state of emergency in Koror.20 \n \n15. \nDisaster  risk  financing.  Palau  has  no  dedicated  financing  available  for  immediate \ndisaster response, early recovery, and reconstruction, relying instead on reallocation of internal \nrevenues  and  drawdown  from  the  permanent  GFR.  The  permanent  GFR  was  established  in \nFY2014 following the experience of the two typhoons (para. 5).21 The minimum annual allocation \nfor the GFR is set at 2% of unrestricted local revenue collections from the preceding fiscal year.22 \nUnspent  amounts  from  previous  fiscal  years  accumulate  in  the  GFR,  and  the  Palau  National \nCongress can also allocate additional amounts towards it. The available balance in the GFR as \nof  June  2018  is  $14.4  million.    The  GFR  may  be  tapped  after  a  disaster  in  the  absence  of \nalternative  financing,  but  is  not  exclusive  for  post-disaster  financing  needs,  and  may  also  be \naccessed for other purposes.23  Budget realignment to finance all types of post-disaster needs is \ngenerally undertaken in practice, but is not well-documented in budget laws and papers.  \n \n16. \nThe government sees a further need to build resources for immediate disaster response, \nearly  recovery,  and  reconstruction  instead  of  relying  on  (i)  budget  reallocations  from  internal \nrevenue which can take time to secure (partly due to government approval procedures), fall short \nof  requirements,  and  redirect  funds  away  from  development  priorities,  and  (ii)  GFR  reserves, \nwhich are  not  intended exclusively  for financing post-disaster  needs. The  PCCP  envisions  the \nestablishment of a $25 million disaster contingency fund to respond in times of emergency and \nan $11 million National Disaster Recovery Fund and Insurance Program, neither of which is in \nplace. The government is considering typhoon insurance cover through the Pacific Catastrophe \nRisk Insurance Company for the 2018\u201319 typhoon season, for low-frequency high-impact events.  \n                                                \n18 Government of Palau. 1979. Constitution of the Republic of Palau. Koror. \n19 Streamlined procurement procedures can be applied following a declaration of a state of emergency. At this time, \nthe government (through its authorized officials) can engage directly in negotiations with potential companies without \ngoing through regular tendering procedures. All procurement decisions are recorded for review and scrutiny.  \n\n20 The first state of emergency declared by the Governor of Koror for Koror was in response to Typhoon Bopha in 2012 \nseveral hours before the national state of emergency was declared, and the second followed the end of the national \nstate of emergency in response to the 2016 drought. \n\n21 As part of the FY2014 budget, the government approved the establishment of a permanent GFR, to create a buffer \nreserve  fund  to  support  government  operations  through  periods  of  shortfall  of  resources,  and  thus  avoid  deficit \nfunding through running up short-term debt as happened subsequent to the 2008\u20132009 financial crisis.   \n\n22 Appropriations during FY2014\u2013FY2016 fell short of 2% of unrestricted local revenue collections from the preceding \nyear by 15%\u201320% each year, but the FY2017 appropriation was 18% more than 2% of unrestricted local revenue \ncollections from the preceding year. \n\n23 Until 2024, when US Compact funds are due to expire, the GFR may be drawn down when any state of emergency \nis declared, if other funds are unavailable. The GFR can also be accessed if local revenues drop by more than 5% \nof projected  revenues of the previous year. After the expiration of the Compact funding period, the  GFR may be \nutilized to fund any lawful purpose. \n\n4 \n \n\n \n\n\f5    \n \n\nOngoing  reforms.  The  government  is  implementing  several  reforms  across  the  four \n\n \n17. \nPCCP priorities (para. 12).

Policy actions  included in the proposed program (para. 21) are part of  broader \ninterventions presented in the shaded boxes. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nSeveral reform actions (contributing to the broader PCCP interventions presented in the \n18. \nfigure) are underway, although the pace of progress varies depending on implementation agency \ncapacity and available funding (footnote 9). In 2016, the President endorsed a policy framework \nfor responsible tourism  that  integrates  climate  resilience  into  tourism  development  and  adds a \nfocus on eco-tourism in outer islands to ease the pressure of tourism in Koror.24 Proposals are \nunder consideration to provide tax relief to hotels that invest in water catchment plants (to help \nensure water supply for tourists during droughts) and install solar panels to promote renewable \nenergy for tourism. To enhance mitigation, funding to improve the energy efficiency of housing \nand  transport  is  being  sought,  and  energy-efficient  building  codes  are  under  development. \nSupport  in  the  amount  of  $1.2  million  was  allocated  to  integrate  climate  change  actions  into \nexisting Protected Areas Network (PAN) frameworks and management plans.25 \n                                                \n24 Government  of  Palau,  Ministry  of  Natural  Resources,  Environment  and  Tourism,  Bureau  of  Tourism.  2016. \n\nResponsible Tourism Policy Framework.

All sites that join the PAN are eligible \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nPalau has made good progress on reform actions to strengthen community-level planning, \n19. \ncapacity,  and  response,  as  envisaged  in  the  PCCP  (para.  11).  NEMO  has  developed  a \ncommunity-based disaster risk reduction toolkit  in 2016 to guide communities in responding to \ndisasters. NEMO has also conducted climate change vulnerability assessments in eight states. \nMeasures  to  improve  food  security  in  the  face  of  frequent  droughts  include  support  for  a \nsustainable piggery and rehabilitation of taro patches (which were damaged during the typhoons). \nEvacuation shelters have been identified in each of Palau\u2019s 16 states to accommodate community \nmembers in times of disasters, and are being disaster-proofed. The government is developing a \ncomprehensive  geographic  information  system  database,  which  will  help  identify  structures \nimpacted  by  wave  inundation  and  sea-level  rise,  and  vulnerable to  typhoons  and  tsunamis,  to \nimprove community-level planning and response. Work is underway to identify vulnerable areas, \nso  that  communities  can  be  relocated  to  safer  locations  as  needed.26 The  government  is  also \ndeveloping a work program to strengthen equipment and capacity for the rapid and fully functional \ndissemination of early disaster warnings to all affected communities.27 \n \n20. \nProposed program. The PBL is aligned with the following development objective: safety, \nresilience,  and  preparedness  of  communities  in  Palau  enhanced  (footnote  16).  It  will  provide \nPalau with a source of contingent financing for immediate disaster response, early recovery, and \nreconstruction.  To  establish  eligibility  to  access  the  contingent  financing,  the  government  has \ncompleted nine policy actions to strengthen disaster and climate risk management. \n \n21. \nReform areas. The nine policy actions are based on the government\u2019s ongoing reforms \nto achieve the PCCP objectives, and were completed between July 2017 to June 2018. 28 They \nwere  prioritized  in  consultation  with  the  government,  help  advance  broader  interventions  to \nstrengthen climate and disaster-resilient development (as presented in the figure), and indicate \ngovernment  commitment  to  PCCP  implementation.  The  policy  actions  serve  to  (i)  strengthen \npolicies and institutions for disaster and climate resilience, (ii) improve capacity and planning for \ndisaster  and  climate  risk  management,  and  (iii)  expand  financing  for  disaster  and  climate  risk \nmanagement. The actions are outlined below.  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nStrengthening  policies  and institutions for  disaster  and climate resilience. \nThe MOF has approved a midterm review of the PCCP, prepared by the Office of \nClimate  Change  (para.  12),  which  includes  an  update  on  the  implementation  of \nadaptation, mitigation, DRM, and institutional strengthening measures since 2015. \nNEMO  has  finalized  a Mass  Rescue  Operations  Contingency  Plan  that  clarifies \ninstitutional  roles  and  responsibilities  of  government  agencies  for  a  coordinated \noperational  response  in  the  event  of  large-scale  disasters,  which  the  NEC  has \napproved. \nImproving capacity and planning for disaster and climate risk management. \nIn order to strengthen community planning and capacity as envisioned in the PCCP, \nNEMO has finalized a community disaster plan template for hamlets that details a \ncommunity\u2019s  emergency  response organizations  and assigns responsibilities for \nvarious  tasks  in  the  event  of  a  disaster.  NEMO  has  also  completed  training \nworkshops on developing the community disaster plan based on the disaster risk \nreduction  toolkit  (para.  19)  in  12  (of  16)  states.  The  Ministry  of  Education  has \n\n                                                \n\nto apply for designated PAN funds, which will be used by each PAN site to manage its own resources in accordance \nwith system-wide goals and objectives for conservation and sustainable development. \n\n26 Melekeok State has developed a plan to relocate its coastal community, which is at risk of floods, to higher ground. \n27 A radio tower that could broadcast in amplitude modulation was destroyed during Typhoon Bopha in 2012 and is still \nawaiting  reconstruction.  Therefore,  for  early  warning,  the  government  has  to  rely  on  frequency  modulation \nbroadcasting systems with a more limited range. \n\n28 The Policy Matrix is in Appendix 4, and details the nine completed policy actions. \n\n6 \n \n\n \n\n\f7    \n \n\napproved  updated  school  emergency  management  plans  for  15  (of  18)  public \nschools as guides for the principal, staff, and teachers, who will be responsible for \nensuring the safety of students during emergencies.29 The Ministry of Education \nhas  also  incorporated  climate  change  and  DRM  into  the  public  school  science \ncurriculum  for  grades  7\u20138,  and  provided  support  to  teachers  through  climate \nscience  training  based  on  the  new  science  curriculum  framework.  In  view  of \nfrequent  droughts  and  the  destruction  of  crops  during  the  recent  typhoons,  the \nMinistry of Agriculture has finalized training manuals for horticulture and livestock \nproducers that include climate resilience measures, and approved their rollout for \ntraining.  The  MOF,  through  the  Office  of  Palau  Automated  Land  and  Resource \nInformation  System,  has  completed  geographic  information  system  layers  for \nhouseholds, businesses, farms, roads, utilities, and major infrastructure, including \ninformation on construction materials and storey height, which are key in assessing \ndisaster risks and losses (para. 19). \nExpanding  financing  for  disaster  and  climate  risk  management.  The \ngovernment has continued efforts to enhance funding from its own resources. For \nFY2018, it has appropriated $1.265 million for the GFR (para. 15), which can be \ntapped in the event of a disaster caused by natural hazards. The government has \nstarted implementing a $100 per person Pristine Paradise Environmental Fee for \ntourists,  replacing  the  $50  per  person  green  fee.  This  fee  will  help  finance \nbiodiversity conservation efforts in marine protected areas and the PAN, including \ncommunity adaptation and DRM priorities in PAN sites (para. 18). \n\n(iii) \n\n \n22. \nProgram monitoring framework. In addition, a program monitoring framework (footnote \n28) identifies how the government plans to broadly continue reforms in the three program reform \nareas through 2021. The PCCP will be updated based on its midterm review, to rationalize reform \nactions.  NEMO  will  secure  community  endorsement  and  approval  of  at  least  16  community \ndisaster plans at the hamlet-level based on the new template (para. 21), as well as approval for \n16 state-level Disaster Risk Reduction Action and Evacuation Plans. Suitable school buildings will \nbe identified, and climate/disaster proofed adequately to serve as evacuation shelters. Training \non climate- and disaster-resilient horticulture and livestock farming will be rolled out, based on the \nnew training manuals (para. 21). Palau\u2019s equipment for the rapid, fully functional dissemination of \ndisaster early warnings to all affected communities and the capacity of communities to respond \nappropriately  will  be  strengthened,  based  on  a  proposal  to  improve the  typhoon early  warning \nsystem that is under preparation. High resolution topographical maps for the main inhabited areas \nof Babeldaob and Koror (covering more than 90% of the population of Palau) will be prepared to \nimprove local planning and response efforts. The government will continue to annually appropriate \nat  least  2%  of  local  revenue  collections  from  the  preceding  fiscal  year  for  the  GFR.  Disaster \nrecovery planning and post-disaster budget execution capabilities will be further strengthened. \n \n23. \nADB\u2019s  value  addition.  The  most  cost-effective  way  of  financing  disaster  response  is \nthrough various tools in a common framework to minimize different layers of risk, as no single \ninstrument is optimal for responding to all disaster events, which range from frequent, small-scale \nevents to rare catastrophic events.30 The government recognizes that contingent financing can \nbe  effective  in  minimizing  risks  from  disaster  events  that  would  exhaust  funds  available  for \n\n                                                \n29 The remaining three schools are in the outer islands, and have fewer than 30 students each, and will update their \n\nplans later in 2018. \n\n30 Disaster Risk Financing Tools and Approaches (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) presents \ndetails on existing ADB instruments and different options available to Palau to address different layers of risks arising \nfrom disasters caused by natural hazards.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nimmediate response, early recovery, and reconstruction under the GFR, but are too frequent to \nbe covered cost-effectively through insurance. The PBL will address this critical financing gap. \nAmong  ADB\u2019s  existing  instruments  to  respond  to  post-disaster  financing  needs,  emergency \nassistance  loans  can  take  more  than  3  months  to  process,  while  reconstruction  loans  under \nnormal lending modalities can take even longer.31 The PBL will enable financing to be in place \nbefore  a  disaster,  and  provide  Palau  with  immediate  access  to  resources  for  timely  response, \nearly recovery, and reconstruction in the event of a qualifying disaster. ADB will also add value \nthrough technical assistance (TA) under the program monitoring framework. \n \n24. \nProposed technical assistance. The PBL marks ADB\u2019s initial engagement on DRM and \nclimate change reforms in Palau, and will pave the way for more systematic interventions. The \nprogram monitoring framework (para. 22) will serve as the basis for ADB\u2019s continued engagement \nwith  Palau  to  support  longer-term  reforms.32 Based  on  the  availability  of  resources,  ADB\u2014in \nconsultation  with  the  government  and  other  partners\u2014will  explore  the  provision  of  TA  to \n(i) strengthen  disaster  recovery  planning  and  post-disaster  budget  execution  capabilities, \nensuring that available post-disaster financing can be used quickly and effectively; (ii) undertake \ndisaster and climate vulnerability and risk assessments of priority critical infrastructure (potentially, \nBelau  National  Hospital,  Meyungs  Causeway,  and  Minato-bashi  Bridge);33 and  (iii) continue  to \nprepare and implement community disaster plans. \n \nADB  experience.  ADB has  provided  significant loans, grants,  and TA for  post-disaster \n25. \nresponse,  early  recovery,  and  reconstruction  in  the  Pacific  (footnote  30). 34 It  piloted  similar \ncontingent financing in the Cook Islands in 2016 through a stand-alone, single-tranche PBL from \nordinary  capital  resources  to  support  timely  disaster  response  (footnote  2).35 This  approach  is \nalso  reflected  in  the  2017  regional  program  for  Samoa,  Tonga,  and  Tuvalu,  from  ADB\u2019s \nconcessional resources (footnote 2). Following extensive damage from Cyclone Gita in Tonga in \nFebruary 2018, ADB released $6 million from the regional program within 24 hours of receiving \nthe Government of Tonga\u2019s request, demonstrating the benefits of this approach. The regional \nprogram provides $2 million in TA to further expand ADB engagement in DRM reforms. \n \n26. \nLessons  learned.  Several  lessons  from  ADB\u2019s  support  for  DRM  in  the  Pacific  were \nincorporated  in  the  program:  (i)  as  evidenced  in  the  case  of  Tonga,  the  primary  benefit  of  a \ndeferred  drawdown  is  that  it  is  quick  disbursing,  providing  the  government  with  an  immediate \nsource of bridge financing after a disaster; (ii) for the government to fully benefit from the quick-\ndisbursing nature of contingent financing, it has been ensured that institutional arrangements are \nin place in Palau to enable the post-disaster submission of a withdrawal request for funds to ADB; \n(iii) since the policy matrix includes reforms across different sectors, dialogue with the various line \nagencies  was  initiated  early  during  program  preparation,  and  continued  through  ADB\u2019s \n\n                                                \n31 ADB provides dedicated funding to its concessional assistance-only countries through the Asian Development Fund \n12 Disaster Response Facility. Palau is not eligible since it has access to ordinary capital resources. Also, grants of \nup to $3 million per event may be provided for humanitarian relief under the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund. \n32 Under the program monitoring framework, ADB expects to provide targeted support from regional TA funds. ADB. \n2015. Technical Assistance for Strengthening Climate and Disaster Resilience of Investments in the Pacific. Manila \n(TA 8961-REG). \n\n33 Meyungs Causeway links the country\u2019s only public hospital, Belau National Hospital on Southwest Islanders Village, \nto Koror Island. The Minato-bashi Bridge carries the main sewage trunk line from Koror to the sanitation plant, and \nalso  links  several  major  hotels  to  Koror  and  the  airport,  and  is  thus  particularly  important  for  tourism.  All  three \nstructures face high disaster risk, according to the Ministry of Public Infrastructure, Industries and Commerce. \n34 In 2013, ADB provided Palau with $200,000 from the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund after Typhoon Haiyan. \n35 The Government of the Cook Islands undertook reforms to strengthen DRM policies and institutions, improve the \ndisaster  resilience of  physical  assets,  and  expand  disaster risk  financing.  The  program includes  provision  of  TA, \ndepending on government demand. DRM issues are regularly discussed during country consultation missions. \n\n8 \n \n\n \n\n\f9    \n \n\n \nDevelopment  Coordination  Office  in Koror  to ensure timely  completion of  actions; (iv)  the  PBL \nprovides  the  opportunity  to  elevate  DRM  issues  to  the  MOF  level,  and  the  provision  of  TA  to \nsupport the reform areas in the program monitoring framework (para. 24) is expected to facilitate \nsubstantive policy dialogue and effective implementation even if the loan is fully disbursed. \n \nC. \n\nImpacts of the Reform \n\n27. \nIt will only be possible to quantify the full economic impact of the program after a disaster, \nas the benefits (or costs avoided) will be determined by the scale and nature of the specific event. \nThe PBL will allow the government to finance post-disaster needs in a timely manner, and avoid \nopportunity  costs  associated  with  budget  or  aid  reallocations,  and/or  any  financial  costs \nassociated  with  additional  commercial  or  concessional  borrowing  that  may  be  needed  for \nimmediate response, early recovery, and reconstruction. Direct economic benefits include faster \nrestoration of  essential  services, facilitation of medical  support that  can minimize loss of  lives, \ncontainment of the emergency situation, and less risk of negative post-disaster health impacts. \n \nIn addition, the policy actions to establish eligibility to access the contingent financing will \n28. \nimprove Palau\u2019s ability to withstand and cope with the short- and longer-term impacts of disasters \nand  climate  change.  They  will  encourage  reforms  that  ultimately  result  in  beneficial  economic \nimpacts,  such  as  (i)  reduced  loss  of  lives  and  property  reflecting  improved  disaster  planning, \nresponse, preparation, and public training; (ii) less destruction of property resulting from better \nmapping and location of critical public infrastructure and assets; and (iii) lower damage to crops \nthrough the adoption of better and more climate-resilient cropping techniques. \n \nD. \n \n29. \nThe  government  has  requested  a  single-tranche,  stand-alone  loan  of  $15  million  from \nADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  to  help  finance  immediate  disaster  response,  early  recovery, \nand reconstruction. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, with \nrepayments calculated based on a disbursement-linked amortization schedule, an annual interest \nrate determined in accordance with ADB's London interbank offered rate-based lending facility, a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan agreement. There is no maturity premium payable to ADB. \n \n30. \nPost-disaster financing needs are determined based on the likely fiscal impact of medium- \nto  high-impact  disasters,  taking  into  account  the  resources  likely  available  from  domestic  and \ninternational sources, and the need to ensure that Palau maintains a sustainable level of debt \n(footnote 4). As the proposed loan funds are for contingent financing to support additional public \nspending associated with immediate disaster response, early recovery, and reconstruction, the \nloan amount is not directly correlated with the cost of policy reforms. \n \nE. \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs and Budget Support \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n31. \nThe  MOF  will  be  the  executing  agency,  responsible  for  coordinating  and  monitoring \nprogram implementation. The implementing agencies will include the Ministry of Education; the \nMinistry of Natural Resources, Environment, and Tourism; the Ministry of Public Infrastructure, \nIndustries, and Commerce; and NEMO\u2014which are responsible for reforms presented in the policy \nmatrix, together with MOF. The program period will be from approval to 31 December 2021.  \n \n32. \nEligibility to withdraw from the loan is based on the achievement of the nine policy actions \n(para.  21).  Actual  withdrawal  will  be  deferred  until  the  occurrence  of  a  disaster  triggered  by  a \n\n \n\n\f10 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nnatural hazard that results in the official declaration of a state of emergency by the President of \nPalau in accordance with Article VIII, Section 14 the 1979 Constitution (para. 13), covering all or \npart  of  Palau,  within  the  program  period.36 The  government  can  withdraw  the  loan  proceeds \npartially or entirely, depending on its assessment of the disaster\u2019s severity and resultant need, \nand after the government and ADB have agreed on the withdrawal amount. Loan proceeds will \nbe withdrawn in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from \ntime to time). \n \nA  specific  repayment  schedule  based  on  the  size  of  the  drawdown  and  the  remaining \n33. \nunutilized funds will be calculated. Funds will be spent through national budget processes. During \nloan  effectiveness,  ADB  will  monitor  the  implementation  of  reforms  according  to  the  program \nmonitoring framework (para. 22). If no state of emergency is declared within the program period, \nloan proceeds will not be withdrawn. If a new disaster resilience program is processed after 2021, \nprogress will be reviewed against the program monitoring framework. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \n34. \nGovernance.  Palau  has  limited  financial  arrangements  in  place  for  disaster  events \n(para. 15). Moreover, coordinating disaster response, including the support offered by donors and \ncivil  society  organizations  with  competing  requirements  and  procedures,  can  pose  significant \nadministrative  challenges,  and  government  absorption  capacities  are  often  stretched  in  the \naftermath of disaster events. TA will prioritize capacity development focusing on financing and \nbudgetary issues, including post-disaster budget allocation and execution, to ensure that Palau \nhas  adequate  systems  in  place  to  use  program  resources  in  an  effective,  accountable,  and \ntransparent manner (para. 24). \n \n35. \nPoverty  and  social.  The  program  will  allow  the  government  to  maintain  greater  fiscal \nstability in the event of a disaster, and enable it to initiate relief and recovery efforts with minimum \ndelay, mitigating the immediate adverse impacts. Implementation of the policy actions will further \nensure that communities, including vulnerable households, are able to better plan and prepare \nfor disasters. Training for households on the community-based disaster risk reduction toolkit (para. \n21) involves community consultations and outreach. \n \n36. \nThe program is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. The midterm review of the \nPCCP  includes  an  update  on  reforms  benefiting  women.  The  Mass  Rescue  Operations \nContingency  Plan  includes  sex-disaggregated  tracking  of  evacuees  and  identification  of  their \nspecial needs. In 2016, NEMO finalized a community-based disaster risk reduction toolkit (para. \n19),  which  (i)  prioritizes  women  and  other  vulnerable  groups  for  community-level  DRM,  (ii) \nrecognizes  the  importance  of  partnerships  with  women\u2019s  groups  for  effective  DRM,  and  (iii) \nrecommends the inclusion of the leader of the traditional women\u2019s group in the hamlet emergency \ncommittee. The community disaster plan template is based on this toolkit, and training workshops \non the toolkit were completed by NEMO in 12 (of 16 states). Of the 182 community members who \nwere trained, 79 were women (against a target of 40%). The horticulture and livestock training \nmanuals  and  the training to  be  rolled  out  will  benefit  women,  who  make up more than  75%  of \nfarmers in Palau.37 The school emergency management plans include guidance on how students \n(disaggregated  by  gender)  will  be  accounted  for,  through  student  emergency  cards  that  also \ninclude  consideration  for  special  needs.  The  revised  science  curriculum  for  grades  7\u20138 \nincorporates the special role of women in times of disaster response. \n\n                                                \n36 States of emergency declared by governors in their particular states will not qualify for withdrawal of loan proceeds.  \n37 Government of Palau. 2015. 2015 Census of Population, Housing and Agriculture of the Republic of Palau.

In accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the PBL has \n37. \nbeen  screened  and  is  classified  category  C  for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and \nindigenous peoples. Environmental and social impacts of policy actions were evaluated. Program \nactivities are confined to policy and institutional reforms, and no policy action will result in or lead \nto involuntary resettlement or have adverse impacts on indigenous peoples or the environment. \n \n38. \n Risks and mitigation. Key risks to program implementation relate to possible external \nshocks  and  capacity  constraints  of  the  government  agencies,  including  constraints  in  public \nfinancial  management  systems.  MOF  has  experience  in  executing  donor-financed  (including \nADB-financed) projects (footnote 14), and financial management systems for externally financed \nprojects  are  considered  adequate  (footnote  9).  The  remaining  fiduciary  risks  will  be  managed \nthrough TA support for capacity development of government counterparts (para. 24). Major risks \nand mitigating measures are summarized in  the table below and described in detail in the risk \nassessment  and  risk  management  plan.38 ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to \ndate) was explained to and discussed with the government and MOF. \n \n\nSummary of Risks and Mitigating Measures Risks Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nRepeated or major external shocks \n(e.g., disasters or economic downturns) \nhurt the economy. \nStaff constraints or shifting priorities \ndelay the strategic planning and/or \nimplementation of reforms. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nMitigation Measures \n\nDevelopment partners help the government build buffers to improve \nresilience, and provide assistance in case of economic shocks. \nProgram policy actions also help improve resilience. \nThe Asian Development Bank and the executing/implementing \nagencies monitor reform progress regularly, and technical assistance \nfrom development partners supports selected actions. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n39. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \nall  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender,  procurement,  consulting services,  and  disbursement as described in detail  in the  loan \ndocuments. The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the program, which \nare set forth in the loan agreement.
