An initial environmental examination for the project loan \nand  an  environment  assessment  of  the  policy  actions  under  the \nprogram loan were undertaken.  \n \nRapidly  urbanizing  Bangladesh  has  one  of  the  highest  population \ndensities  in  the  world.  Crowded  and  poor  hygienic  living  conditions \nhave  increased  the  vulnerability  of  urban  poor  people  to  economic \nshocks  from  ill-health.  A  burgeoning  urban  population  is  only  going \nto  make  the  situation  for  public  and  environmental  health  more \nchallenging. Urban local bodies that are mandated to provide public \nand  environmental  health-related  services  have  limited  institutional \nand  financial  capacities.  Nationally,  the  Local  Government  Division \n(LGD) of the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and \nCooperatives  (MOLGRDC)  needs  to  take  a  stronger  stewardship \nin  urban  public  and  environmental  health  (UPEH).  The \nrole \nto  make  use  of  various \nGovernment  of  Bangladesh  needs \ninstruments  at \ntaxation, \ninformation, and investments\u2014to address the growing challenges of \nUPEH with the help of the private sector and civil society. \n \nA sector development program (SDP) is proposed to address a wide \nrange  of  complex  but  interlinked  UPEH  challenges.  The  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  in  many  ways  is  uniquely  placed  to  help \nthese  daunting  multidimensional \nthe  Government  address \nchallenges. The SDP builds on more than a decade of ADB's strong \nengagement  in  urban  development  in  Bangladesh,  and  makes  a \nconcerted  effort  to  mainstream  valuable  lessons  learned  and  good \npractices which have evolved from ADB-supported projects, such as \nurban  governance  and  infrastructure  improvement  projects  and \nurban primary health care projects. \n \nThe  overall  impact  of  the  Urban  Public  and  Environmental  Health \nSector  Development  Program  (UPEHSDP)  is  to  improve  the  public \nthe  urban  areas  of \nand  environmental  health  conditions \n\nits  disposal\u2014such  as \n\nregulations, \n\nin \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nThe Program Loan \n \nOutcomes \n\n \nLoan Amount and \nTerms \n\n \nEstimated Program \nCompletion Date \n \nTranches \n\nin \n\nthe  program \n\nloan  will  help  achieve \n\nthe  six  city  corporations  (Barisal, \nBangladesh,  particularly \nChittagong,  Dhaka,  Khulna,  Rajshahi,  and  Sylhet).  The  successful \nimplementation of the UPEHSDP will help reduce child mortality and \nmorbidity by reducing the prevalence of waterborne and food-related \ndiseases,  increase  productivity  by  reducing  overall  morbidity,  and \nimprove  the  quality  of  life  of  urban  inhabitants.  UPEHSDP  will \nimprove  the  health  status  of  the  poor  in  urban  areas  and  assist \nBangladesh  to  make  progress  on  the  Millennium  Development \nGoals  (MDGs)  relating  to  child  and  maternal  health  care  and \ncommunicable  diseases  (MDGs  4,  5,  and  6),  and  improve  urban \nsanitation  (MDG  7).  The  program  and  project  loans  under  the \nUPEHSDP  are  designed  to  complement  each  other  in  achieving \nprogress towards these key goals. \n \n \n \nthe \nThe  reforms  under \nsustainable  provision  and  operation  of \nimproved  public  and \nenvironmental  health  services  in  urban  areas,  including  the  six  city \ncorporations  and  the  pourashavas  (towns  other  than  six  city \ncorporations).  The  reforms  include  (i)  strengthening  institutional \narrangements,  (ii)  improving  financial  sustainability,  (iii)  improving \npublic  and  environmental  health  service  delivery,  and \n(iv) \nstrengthening governance and management. \n \nThe  Government  has  requested  a \nto  SDR \n44,895,000  ($70  million  equivalent)  from  ADB's  Special  Funds \nresources  (Asian  Development  Fund)  to  help  finance  the  program. \nThe loan will have a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 \nyears, with an annual interest charge of 1.0% per annum during the \ngrace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. \n \nPolicy  measures  are  expected  to  generate  cost  savings  of  $326 \nmillion,  which  is  much  higher  than  the  estimated  program  budget \nadjustment costs and compensatory measures of about $70 million.  \n \nThe  program  implementation  period  is  from  December  2009  to \nDecember 2016. \n \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  available  for  withdrawal  in  three \ntranches\u2014$30 million, $20 million, and $20 million equivalent\u2014upon \ncompliance  with  the  agreed  conditions  for  first,  second,  and  third \ntranches  respectively.  The  first  tranche  will  be  released  upon  loan \neffectiveness or shortly thereafter, subject to compliance with all first \ntranche  conditions  (expected  before  31  December  2009);  the \nsecond  tranche  will  be  released  upon  compliance  with  the  second \ntranche  release  conditions  (expected  before  31  December  2011); \nand the third tranche upon compliance with the third tranche release \nconditions  (expected  before  31  December  2013).  The  tranche \nrelease conditions are set out in the policy matrix (Appendix 4). \n \n\nloan  equivalent \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nThe  executing  agencies  will  be  the  Finance  Division  of  the Ministry \nof Finance and the LGD of the MOLGRDC. The city corporations of \nBarisal, Chittagong, Dhaka, Khulna, Rajshahi, and Sylhet will be the \nimplementing agencies for certain activities as specified in the policy \nmatrix. \n \nThe  national  urban  public  and  environmental  health  committee \nchaired  by  the  minister  of  the  MOLGRDC  will  meet  at  least  once  a \nyear  to  provide  overall  stewardship,  enable  strong  interministerial \ncoordination,  and  ensure  greater  involvement  in  and  ownership  of \nthe  UPEHSDP  by  mayors  of  the  six  city  corporations.  The  national \nprogram  steering  committee  to  be  chaired  by  the  secretary  of  the \nLGD  will  ensure  that  policies  and  programs  concerning  UPEH  are \ncoordinated  and  program  impediments  resolved.  The  urban  public \nand environmental health unit (UPEHU), to be established under the \nLGD,  will  be  the  secretariat  to  the  national  program  steering \ncommittee. The program director of at least joint secretary rank will \nhead  the  UPEHU  and  will  be  assisted  by  three  deputy  program \ndirectors of deputy secretary level for (i) program implementation (on \ndeputation,  preferably  from  the  Bangladesh  Civil  Services  [BCS] \nadministration  cadre),  (ii)  financial  management  and  municipal \nfinance  (on  deputation,  preferably  from  BCS  audit  and  accounts \ncadre),  and  (iii)  policy  reform  and  capacity  development  (on \ndeputation, preferably from the BCS economic cadre). The UPEHU \nimplementation. \nwill  be  responsible \nAdditional \nfrom \nministries,  including  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  Family  Welfare, \nMinistry of Environment and Forests, Ministry of Food and Disaster \nManagement,  as  appropriate,  or  hired  from  the  market.  The  city \ncorporation  UPEH  coordination  committees  will  be  chaired  by  the \ncity corporation mayors.  \n \nThe  chief  executive  officers  of  the  city  corporations  will  be  the \nprogram  managers.  Ward  UPEH  coordination  committees  will  be \nchaired  by  local  commissioners/councilors  and  co-chaired  by  zonal \nhealth  and/or  conservancy  officers  (where  available)  and  female \ncommissioners/councilors,  with  a  membership  that  represents  all \nlocal  stakeholders,  including  informal  settlers.  City  corporation \nprogram  implementation  units  (CCPIUs)  will  be  established  in  each \nof  the  six  city  corporations.  The  CCPIUs  will  consist  of  city \ncorporation  staff  concerned  with  public  and  environmental  health, \nincluding  the  conservancy  officer  and  the  health  officer,  and \npersonnel  recruited  by  the  UPEHU  and  assigned  to  the  CCPIU, \nincluding  a  procurement  specialist,  an  accountant,  and  a  civil \nengineer. Technical personnel from the consultant teams will also be \nassigned to work with the CCPIU staff to help implement subprojects \nand to transfer implementation capabilities to the CCPIU team. \n \nThe loan proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange cost \n(excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and procured \nin  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports \n\nfor  day-to-day  UPEHSDP \ntechnical  policy  personnel  will  be  seconded \n\nExecuting Agencies \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \nCounterpart Funds \n\n \nThe Project Loan \n \nOutcomes \n\n \nOutputs \n\nfinanced by other bilateral and multilateral sources. \n \nThe  Government  will  use  the  counterpart  funds  generated  by  the \nprogram  loan,  under  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB,  to  support \nsector reforms and meet the adjustment costs associated with the \nloan.  \n \n \n \nThe project will improve access to and use of effective, efficient, and \nsustainable  quality  UPEH  systems  and  practices  in  the  six  city \ncorporations  of  Barisal,  Chittagong,  Dhaka,  Khulna,  Rajshahi,  and \nSylhet.  It  will  strengthen  sustainable  UPEH  systems  with  improved \nmunicipal solid waste and medical waste management, food safety, \nand  capacity  of  the  LGD  and  city  corporations  for  public  and \nenvironment health. \n \nThe project will cover the six city corporations, which cover 34% of \nall urban areas in Bangladesh as per the 2001 census (10.3 million \npopulation  in  the  six  city  corporations  out  of  the  total  urban \npopulation of 31.0 million). \n \nComponent  A:  Solid  Waste  Management.  The  solid  waste \nmanagement component will have two subcomponents: (i) municipal \nsolid waste management, and (ii) medical waste management. The \nmunicipal  solid  waste  management  component  complements  the \nestablishment  of  a  national  strategy  and  planning  framework  under \nthe  program  loan,  with  infrastructure  investments  to  improve  the \nefficiency  of  municipal  solid  waste  management  services  including \nfor  urban  poor,  secondary  collection  and \nprimary  collection \ntransportation,  and \nfacilities.  The \ncomponent  also  includes,  among  others,  educational  campaigns  to \nencourage  the  3Rs  (reduce,  reuse,  and  recycle)  and  source \nsegregation of waste. \n \nComponent B: Food Safety. Under the food safety component, two \nsubcomponents will be supported by the project: (i) food laboratories \nand  a  training  center,  and  (ii)  modern  slaughterhouses.  Two  food \nlaboratories will be constructed, one each in Dhaka and Chittagong. \nThe  Dhaka  laboratory  will  have  an  additional  training  center \ncomponent.  Modern  slaughterhouses  will  be  established  in  each  of \nthe six city corporations for preparation and processing of standard \nquality meat and meat products and other economic by-products. \n \nComponent C: Program Management, Institutional Support, and \nCapacity  Development.  This  component  will  consist  of  three \nimplementation \nsubcomponents:  (i)  program  management  and \nsupport, \nfinances \nstrengthening,  and  (iii)  policy  reform  and  capacity  development \nsupport.  Subcomponent  (i)  will  assist  the  UPEHU  in  implementing, \nmonitoring,  and  supervising  the  program.

The  investment  projects \nunder  the  SDP  and  the  required  technical  and  management \nassistance  for  these  projects  will  continue  to  be  supported  through \nproject funding.  \n \nProcurement of all goods and services to be financed under the \nProject will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  All  civil  works \ncontracts estimated to cost the equivalent of $1 million or more will be \nprocured  through  international  competitive  bidding.  Civil  works \ncontracts estimated to cost less than $1 million will be procured using \nnational competitive bidding (NCB). To the extent practicable, goods \nwill be grouped into procurement packages larger than $500,000 to \nbe  suitable  for  international  competitive  bidding  procedures.  Goods \nthat  cannot  be  grouped  into  larger  contracts  and  are  estimated  to \ncost less than $500,000 per contract will be procured through NCB. \nA  third-party,  pre-shipment  inspection  provision  will  be  adopted  to \nensure quality of goods and equipment. NCB procedures applicable \nto the Project are specified in the Government\u2019s Public Procurement \nRules  2008,  (once  the  Public  Procurement  Rules  2008  in  English \nare  formally  adopted)  and  the  procurement  plan.  Miscellaneous \nminor  goods  expected  to  cost  less  than  the  equivalent  of \n$100,000  will  be  purchased  using  shopping  procedures.  NCB \npackages  valued  at  more  than  $100,000  each  will  be  subject  to \nprior review by ADB. \n \nConsultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  under  the  Project  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, \nas amended from time to time). Three international consultant firms \nwill  be  engaged  following  ADB's  quality-  and  cost-based  selection \nprocedures.  An  international  consulting  firm  will  be  engaged  as  the \ndesign supervision and construction consultants (52 person-months \nof  international  and  308  person-months  of  national  experts).  One \ninternational  consulting \nfinancial \nmanagement  and  municipal  finance  consultants  (15  person-months \nof  international  and  178  person-months  of  national  experts).  For \npolicy  and  miscellaneous  capacity  development  support,  one \ninternational  consultant  firm  will  be  engaged  as  program  support \nconsultants  (12  person-months  of  international  and  114  person-\nmonths of national experts).  \n \nThe  UPEHSDP  will  contribute  to  human  development  through \nimprovements  in  the  living  conditions  of  residents  in  the  project \ncities.  This  will  be  through  investments  and  policy  reforms  to \nimprove  public  and  environmental  health,  citizen  participation,  and \npro-poor targeting. The program component introduces specific pro-\npoor  strategies  including  the  issuance  of  entitlement  cards.  The \nproject  component  will  improve  municipal  solid  waste  and  medical \nwaste  management  and  food  safety  in  the  project  cities,  benefiting \nboth  poor  and  non-poor.  Solid  waste  management  investments \n\nfirm  will  be  engaged  as \n\n\f \n\nvii\n\nthe  outputs  relating \n\ninclude  community-based  primary  collection  services  in  urban  poor \nareas.  A  community  participation  plan  aims  to  enhance  citizen \ninvolvement in project activities through service delivery alliance\u2014a \nmultistakeholder  group  consisting  of  civil  society  representatives, \nresource  organizations,  nongovernment  organizations,  community-\nbased  organizations,  and  private  sector  providers.  The  community \nparticipation plan will create local awareness campaigns to educate \nand inform the poor on health and hygiene, and proactively include \nwaste  pickers  into  project  activities  as  part  of  the  waste  pickers \ntraining  program.  A  gender  action  plan  will  mainstream  gender \nthroughout  the  program  and  project  investments  and  enhance \nparticipation and capacity of women in UPEH initiatives. The project \ncomponent  supports  MDGs,  specifically  reduction  of  child  mortality \n(MDG  4),  improving  maternal  health  (MDG  5),  combating  malaria \nand  other  diseases \n(MDG  6),  and  ensuring  environmental \nsustainability (MDG 7).  \n \nPublic  and  environmental  health  challenges  are  complex  and \ndaunting  arising  from  rapid  urbanization  in  a  country  where  urban \ndensity  is  one  of  the  highest  in  the  world  and  where  urban  basic \nservices need much improvement. The scale of challenges and the \nresources that are required to deal with them are immense. Political \nsupport  might  waver,  as \nto  public  and \nenvironmental health are less tangible than when building roads and \ndrains.  These  risks  will  be  addressed  through  institutional  reforms, \nparticipatory  approaches  and  behavior  change  communication \ninterventions.  \n \nThe purpose of better interministerial coordination by the LGD is to \naccess the core skills, knowledge, and professional staff of other line \nministries so as to support and enable city corporations to effectively \nimplement  their  mandates  relating  to  public  and  environmental \nhealth.  This  is  also  to  assist  the  LGD  fulfill  its  role  of  providing \nnational  stewardship  to  city  corporations  and  pourashavas  (town \nother  than  the  six  city  corporations).  However,  the  interministerial \ncoordination  issues  are  always  very  sensitive  and  lead  to  territorial \nand jurisdictional tensions. This could lead to unwarranted tensions \nand  distraction  from  the  primary  purpose  of  these  coordination \ncommittees,  i.e.,  improving  the  quality  of  life  of  urban  inhabitants. \nThis  risk  will  have  to  be  proactively  addressed  by  the  LGD  by \nensuring  that  (i)  any  apprehensions  of  the  line  ministries  are \naddressed\u2014the  ministry  that  has  a  lead  role  continues  to  provide \nthe  lead  on  the  issue\u2014and,  (ii)  through  regular  interaction  and \ncoordination, no duplication takes place. \n \nThe  other  significant  risk  of  the  UPEHSDP  is  that,  being  a  new \nprogram,  the  initial  set-up  required  for  establishing  the  UPEHU \nfollowed  by  hiring  of  various  consultant  firms  normally  take  a  long \ntime. This would not only delay program implementation but also has \nthe  potential  to  delay  the  Program  due  to  weak  procurement  and \nfinancial  management  systems.  This  will  be  addressed  through \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \n\n\fviii \n\n \nTechnical Assistance \n\n \n\nthe \n\nis  required; \n\nbridging technical assistance support explained further below. \n \nThe UPEHSDP by nature has greater challenges than either a pure \nprogram or a pure project, as it has both a policy reforms component \n(program)  and  an  investment  component  (project).  These  two \ncomponents  require  a  diverse  skills  base.  For  the  policy  reforms \ncomponent,  expertise  in  policy,  law,  regulation,  and  municipal \nfinances \ninvestment  component  will  require \nengineering,  procurement,  financial  management  and  audit,  project \nperformance  monitoring,  and  information  management  skills.  Both \npolicy reforms and investment components will require specialists in \nsolid  waste,  medical  waste, \nfood  and  water  safety,  and \nslaughterhouses. The technical assistance is an effort to mitigate the \nstart-up  delay  risks,  and  enable  the  Project  to  start  on  a  sound \nfoundation. \n \nThe technical assistance will provide (i) expert procurement support \nto help the LGD and UPEHU hire the three consultant packages in a \ntimely  manner;  (ii)  expert  institutional  and  financial  management \nsupport to set up procedures and processes to strengthen financial \nmanagement  systems  of  the  UPEHU  and  CCPIUs,  and  mitigate \nfinancial risks; (iii) expert support in municipal financing, institutional \ndevelopment, financial management, solid and medical waste, clean \ndevelopment  mechanism,  food  and  water  safety,  private  sector \nparticipation,  pro-poor  targeting,  citizens'  participation,  and  gender \nmainstreaming  for  policy  reform  support;  (iv)  engineering  design \nsupport  in  waste  management  and  food  safety  to  support  the \nimplementation of the investment component; and (v) limited support \nfor training and local study tours. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nprogram  loan;  and  (ii)  proposed  project  loan,  both  to  Bangladesh,  for  the  Urban  Public  and \nEnvironmental  Health  Sector  Development  Program.

With a density of 2,756 people per square kilometer \n2. \n2\n(kmP\nPoverall, Bangladesh is the most densely populated \nP) in urban areas and 843 people per kmP\n1\ncountry in the world (excluding a few city-states),PF\nFP and also has the seventh-largest population. \nBangladesh  is  urbanizing  at  a  rapid  pace  and  the  country\u2019s  urban  population  is  expected  to \n2\nreach 89.5 million (from 39.5 million in 2005) by 2030.PF\nFP The number of urban poor people has \n3\nincreased from 7 million in 1985 to 12 million in 1999,PF\nFP and, according to one estimate, by 2020 \n4\nthe urban poor figure could be as high as 40%\u201360% of the urban population.PF\nFP Recent surveys \nhave found much higher infant and under-5 child mortality in the urban slums than in the urban \n5\nnon-slums.PF\nFP The child illness and mortality indicators in urban areas are almost the same as in \n6\nrural  areasPF\nFP  and  are  much  worse  among  the  urban  poor  than  among  the  rural  poor.  For \nexample, the infant mortality rate in the poorest quintile in rural areas was 87.5 per 1,000 births, \nwhile  in  the  poorest  quintile  of  urban  areas  it  was  111.9  per  1,000  live  births;  prevalence  of \nacute  respiratory  infection  is  higher  among  the  urban  poor  than  the  rural  poor;  and  severe \nstunting  among  urban  poor  children  is  higher  than  among  the  rural  poor  children  (Appendix  2 \nand Supplementary Appendix A).PF\n \n3. \nLiving Conditions and Ill-Health. The reasons for the poor health of the urban poor are \nweak  public  and  environmental  health  services,  poor  sanitation,  poor  nutrition,  overcrowding \nand  unhygienic  living  conditions,  poverty,  and  lack  of  affordable  primary  health  care  (PHC) \nservices, among others. About one-fifth of the disease burden in Bangladesh is associated with \nenvironmental factors. Two of the top three causes of death and sickness are respiratory illness \nand  diarrheal  diseases.  Both  of  these  are  strongly  associated  with  environmental  factors  and \nhave significant impacts on the health of children. The urban populations in Bangladesh live in \ncrowded and highly polluted environments resulting in high prevalence of bronchial asthma and \nother  respiratory  diseases.  Poor  sanitation,  water  pollution,  and  inadequate  supply  of  drinking \nwater have resulted in the persistence of communicable diseases, including diarrhea (dysentery, \n\n7\nFP  \n\n                                                 \n1\nP   National Institute of Population Research and Training. 2009.

The \nlocal  government  ordinances  entrust  the  urban  local  bodies  (ULBs)  with  massive  public  and \nenvironmental  health  mandates,  which  include,  among  other  things,  waste  management, \nsanitation, drinking water, food safety, and PHC delivery (Supplementary Appendix B). However, \nthere is limited institutional and technical support at the national level for city corporations and \npourashavas (towns other than the city corporations) to implement the public and environmental \nhealth mandates effectively. Likewise, the institutional capabilities within city corporation health \nand  conservancy  departments  are  weak.  As  the  urban  areas  in  Bangladesh  continue  to  grow \nrapidly,  urban  public  and  environmental  health  (UPEH)  issues  are  becoming  bigger  and  more \ncomplex. Appropriate national institutional arrangements are necessary to provide stewardship \nto  (i)  ensure  adequate  attention  is  given  to  public  and  environmental  health  issues,  (ii)  set \nstandards,  and  (iii)  provide  technical  and  financial  support  to  the  city  corporations  and \npourashavas.  Similarly,  the  institutional  capabilities  of  city  corporations  to  manage  these \ncomplex public and environmental health challenges also need to be strengthened. \n   \n5. \nMunicipal  Finances. The resources allocated within the city corporations to public and \nenvironmental  health  aspects  are  inadequate.  Most  of  the  city  corporations  and  pourashavas \ndepend heavily on central grants to meet their local financial needs, as municipal finances are \nweak.  Municipal  financing  is  dominated  by  one  tax  source\u2014property  or  holding  tax\u2014which \ncontributes  nearly  two-thirds  of  total  municipal  revenue  receipts.  Even  the  full  potential  of \nproperty  or  holding  tax  collection  is  not  fully  realized  as  regular  assessment  is  not  done. \nUncollected  tax  arrears,  both  from  private  and  public  taxpayers,  are  significant.  As  a  result,  it \nbecomes difficult for city corporations and pourashavas to provide essential services and even \npay  staff  salaries.  Potential  sources  of  revenue  within  the  city  corporations  and  pourashavas \nneed  to  be  realized  so  that  the  ULBs  have  additional  revenue  to  meet  growing  urban  and \nenvironmental  health  challenges.  Financial  management  and  budgeting  in  city  corporations  is \nalso  weak,  and  there  is  very  little  consistency  in  accounting  practices.  For  sustainable  public \nand  environmental  health  initiatives,  it  is  necessary  to  strengthen  municipal  finances  and \nmunicipal financial management systems (Supplementary Appendix C).  \n \n6. \nLegal  Framework  to  Enable  Public  and  Environmental  Health  and  Need  for \nCoordinated  Effort. The local government ordinances require the framing of rules and bylaws \nto make, among other things, public and environmental health provisions effective. As there is \nno  national  statute  with  regard  to  solid  waste  management  (collection,  disposal,  and \nmanagement),  making  rules  under  the  provisions  of  the  city  corporations  and  pourashava \nordinances  may,  for  the  time  being,  fill  the  gap  which  exists.  There  are  innumerable  laws \ngoverned  by  various  national  ministries  that  deal  with  public  and  environmental  health,  the \nimplementation  of  which  directly  or  indirectly  falls  under  the  purview  of  city  corporations  and \npourashavas.  To  make  these  laws  more  effective,  coordinated  efforts  are  required  among  the \ndifferent ministries at both national and ULB level (Supplementary Appendix D).  \n \nSolid waste Management. According to the National Policy for Safe Water Supply and \n7. \nSanitation  1998,  city  corporations  and  pourashavas  are  responsible  for  solid  waste  collection, \ndisposal,  and  management,  and  they  are  to  set  tariffs,  enforce  bylaws,  and  appoint  staff.  The \n8\namount  of  solid  waste  generated  by  the  urban  areas  has  expanded  rapidly  in  recent  years.PF\nFP \nAlthough more than two-thirds of urban non-slum households dispose of their garbage through \n                                                 \n8\nP The challenge of solid waste management will become enormous by 2020, when the demand for removal of solid \n\nwaste will rise to about 50,000 tons (t)/day from the present figure of about 15,000 t/day. \n\nP\n\f \n\n3\n\n9\n\n11\n\n10\n\ntransportation  remain  major  weaknesses \n\ndoor-to-door collection (41%) or in a bin outside their house (27%), secondary waste collection \nand \nin  municipal  solid  waste  management \n(Supplementary Appendix E). However, most slum households (58%) dispose of solid waste in \nopen spaces, where primary collection also poses a major challenge. Few city corporations and \npourashavas have solid waste sanitary landfills and only about half of the solid waste generated \nin  urban  areas  is  collected.PF\nFP  Unsanitary  landfills  contribute  significantly  to  greenhouse  gas \nemissions. In addition to direct adverse impacts on public and environmental health, the growing \nand uncontrolled disposal of solid waste contributes to increasing contamination of surface and \ngroundwater.  There  is  no  national  policy,  strategy,  or  guideline  for  domestic,  commercial,  and \nindustrial  solid  waste  disposal.  With  respect  to  policy  and  regulatory  actions,  the  city \ncorporations and pourashavas need to adopt bylaws and improve capacity to plan and monitor \nthe performance of solid waste services.  \n \n8. \nMedical  Waste  Management. About 36,000 tons of medical waste is generated every \nyear  in  Bangladesh.  Out  of  this,  approximately  7,200  tons  is  hazardous  (Supplementary \nAppendix  F).PF\nFP  Various  studies  documented  that  medical  waste  management  in  government \nand  nongovernment  hospitals,  clinics,  and  diagnostic  laboratories  is  very  poor.PF\nFP  There  is  no \n12\nprovision for proper segregation and collection of waste in the health care facilities,PF\nFP and there \nis  a  shortage  of  equipment  and  materials  required  for  the  disposal  of  medical  wastes.  The \nwastes  are  frequently  dumped  in  the  dustbin,  inside  and  outside  hospital  premises,  or  on  the \nground within the hospital premises, and they then become public waste. The Government has \nrecently  promulgated  the  Medical  Waste  (Management  and  Processing)  Rules  under  the \nBangladesh  Environment  Conservation  Act,  1995.  Under  these  rules,  city  corporations  and \npourashavas  are  responsible  for  the  external  transportation  of  general  waste,  treatment  of \nhazardous waste, and provision of land for the proper and final disposal of medical waste. City \ncorporations and pourashavas are to make provisions for collection, transportation, and proper \ndisposal of medical waste, set tariffs, and adopt supporting bylaws to enforce the Medical Waste \n(Management  and  Processing)  Rules.  City  corporations  urgently  need  support  to  improve \nmedical waste management systems to fulfill the mandates prescribed under the rules. \n \n9. \nFood  and  Water  Safety.  Food  contamination  and  adulteration  with  dangerous \nsubstances, colors, and chemicals are widespread in Bangladesh (Supplementary Appendix G). \nThere  are  limited  laboratories  with  the  proper  equipment,  chemicals,  and  trained  analysts  or \ntechnicians  to  support  detection  of  contamination  and  adulteration.  City  corporations  and \npourashavas  are  responsible  for  controlling  food  contamination  and  adulteration  in  their \nrespective  jurisdictions.  Sanitary  inspectors  are  employed  to  inspect  food  manufacturing, \nprocessing, and selling premises, as well as to collect food samples. There are too few sanitary \ninspectors\u2014the  foundation  of  the  food  safety  system\u2014(only  68  nationally  to  cover  6  city \ncorporations and 309 pourashavas) and they are too poorly trained (there is no formal sanitary \ninspector  training  program  or  certificate  of  competency).  There  is  only  one  food  laboratory  at \nDhaka City Corporation, and it has inadequate equipment and chemicals, and is understaffed.  \n \n10. \nUnhygienic animal slaughter, handling, and transportation are significant problems in all \ncity  corporations  and  pourashavas.  Animals  are  slaughtered  in  open  places  adjacent  to  wet \n                                                 \n9\n\nP  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2009.

Meat \nproduction and marketing is not organized and is conducted in various places in the city without \nmunicipal  control,  supervision,  or  veterinary  inspection  of  live  animals  or  carcasses.  All  city \ncorporations need to organize, supervise, and control the slaughtering of animals, production of \nmeat and meat products, and the utilization and processing of by-products.  \n \n11.  Water safety is another important issue. Although access to piped water has increased, \nthe  quality  and  safety  of  water  supplied  at  the  end-user  point  needs  significant  improvement \nthrough  regular  water  testing  and  feedback  to  providers.  The  Department  of  Public  Health \nEngineering is responsible for providing safe water to the population and having laboratories for \ntesting  water  and  testing  the  levels  of  arsenic  and  other  hazardous  substances  in  water. \nHowever, more samples need to be collected and checked at regular intervals.  \n \n12. \nUrban  Primary  Health  Care.  Bangladesh  is  one  of  the  few  countries  in  Asia  that  has \nsignificant  public  investments  in  urban  PHC  (through  the  Urban  Primary  Health  Care  Project \n[UPHCP]).PF\nFP  However,  public  investments  need  to  be  increased  to  match  the  rising  demand. \nMoreover, the current project modes of investments need to be converted slowly into programs. \nThe  national  project  management  unit  and  the  city  corporation  project  implementing  units \nconstituted under the Project need to be institutionalized. Part of the municipal revenue budget \nalso needs to be allocated to the provision of essential PHC to the very poor urban residents.  \n \n13. \nGender and Development. Despite recent gains in the role of women in economic and \nsocial  development  in  Bangladesh,  women  still  remain  particularly  vulnerable  to  poverty.  In \nrelation to solid waste, it is women who are mostly responsible for managing household waste, \nand  who  are  mostly  engaged  in  informal  waste  picking  and  recycling  activities  for  livelihood \ndependence.  Few  women  are  involved  in  key  decision-making  efforts  locally  and  within  city \ncorporations. Opportunities exist to equip women with proper training and equipment to become \nemployed  in  the  formal  waste  collection  and  recycling  process  and  in  other  sectors  in  food \nsafety and hospital waste management. This would ensure more stable employment as well as \nsafer and healthier work conditions. More efforts are also needed to improve the role of women \nin local project planning and decision making. \n  \nB. \n\nKey Issues and Opportunities \n\n14. \nKey  Issues.  UPEH  encompasses  multisector  and  multidimensional  interventions \n(Appendix  2).  To  maximize  the  development  impact  of  health  outcomes  in  urban  areas,  a \ncomprehensive  and  concerted  effort  is  required  to  (i)  strengthen  municipal  public  and \nenvironmental health governance (including institutions, policy, legal and regulatory framework, \nand financial capacity); (ii) strengthen food and water safety, and improve solid waste (including \nmedical waste) management; and (iii) expand access to urban public, environmental, and PHC \nservices,  especially  for  the  poor.  Key  crosscutting  themes  would  be  (i)  mainstreaming  private \nsector participation (PSP) to improve effectiveness and efficiencies and ensure value for money \nof public and environmental health interventions; (ii) ensuring that public expenditures address \nthe public and environmental health priority needs of the urban poor; and (iii) that the proposed \ninterventions  are  gender  sensitive.  The  key  issues  are  (i)  the  multisector  nature  of  public  and \nenvironmental  health  in  the  increasingly  complex  urban  physical  space;  (ii)  prioritizing \ninvestments  that  balance  preventive,  promotive,  and  public  and  environmental  health  care \nneeds  of  the  urban  poor;  (iii)  ensuring  the  existence  of  strong  institutional,  policy,  legal,  and \n\n                                                 \n13\n\nP ADB. 2005.

Manila. \n\nP\n\f \n\n5\n\nregulatory environments for enforcing good public and environmental health practices; and (iv) \nbuilding on the strengths of the private sector.  \n \n15.  Multidimensional  Approach.  Governments  have  various  instruments  to  enforce  the \n\u201cpublic  and  environmental  health  good,\u201d  which  include  taxation,  regulation,  investments,  and \nuse of information. The traditional pure investment approach to UPEH challenges is costly and \nless effective in the absence of strong institutions and effective regulation and taxation regimes. \nStrong  taxation  can  have  multiple  benefits:  it  can  be  a  deterrent  to  unwanted  behavior  (for \nexample, dumping waste in public space), encourage better practices (recycling of waste), and \nimprove municipal finances. Laws and regulations can prohibit practices that are detrimental to \nthe public good, such as dumping hazardous wastes (medical wastes) by largely profit-making \nenterprises  (e.g.,  private  hospitals).  With  the  availability  of  modern  technology  at  affordable \nprices  (cell  phones,  the  internet,  television,  radio,  and  news  media),  the  power  of  information \nhas increased dramatically. However, the public sector has been slow in harnessing this power \nto fulfill its mandates. Well designed and targeted information campaigns have high potential to \ngalvanize public opinion, and enable citizens' cooperation for issues that are considered to be \npublic goods.  \n \n16. \nTaxation,  laws,  regulation,  and  information  campaigns  can  prevent  practices  that \notherwise impose heavy burdens on the public sector. Raising tax revenues, using information \ncampaigns,  and  enforcing  laws  and  regulations  require  a  very  efficient  public  sector,  both  at \nnational  and  local  levels.  Nationally,  the  Government  of  Bangladesh  needs  to  provide \nstewardship;  locally,  the  ULBs  need  to  assert  their  authority  to  discharge  the  responsibilities \nenshrined  in  the  laws.  The  UPEH  challenges  that  Bangladesh  faces  are  massive.  To  address \nthese  challenges  effectively,  there  is  clearly  need  for  significant  enhancement  of  sustainable \ninstitutional  strengthening  both  nationally  and  at  the  ULB  level.  UPEH  also  needs  significantly \nincreased  financing  of  the  critical  subsectors,  which  needs  to  be  addressed  through  a \nsustainable municipal  financial  framework.  The  approach  should  be  to assess  various  gaps  in \nregulation (legal) and enforcement, use taxation and other incentives (policy gaps) to promote \nbetter  public  and  environmental  health,  and  assess  the  effectiveness  of  various  information \ndissemination  mechanisms  to  promote  public  and  environmental  health  in  urban  areas.  Given \nthe multidimensional nature of the issue, an SDP approach has been proposed.  \n \n17. \nFocusing  on  Key  Gaps.  Prevention  and  promotion  are  more  cost-effective  than \ntreatment after onset of disease in ensuring desired health outcomes. However, prevention and \npromotion  of  health  involves  multisector  approaches,  including  provision  of  sanitation  and \ndrinking water; ensuring environmental health, food safety, and hygiene (including safe disposal \nof solid and health care wastes); and health education. A number of development partners are \nproviding support for different aspects, but the greater focus is on providing drinking water and \nsanitation (toilets and sewerage) (Appendix 3). The investments under this project will focus on \ncritical  investment  gaps  and  hence  limits  to  solid  waste  management  and  food  safety.  The \nProgram, however, focuses on more significant gaps relating to institutions, municipal finances, \npolicy,  laws,  regulations,  and  information  dissemination.  To  bring  all  these  interlinked \ninterventions synergistically together, the national stewardship of the Local Government Division \n(LGD)  for  UPEH  needs  to  be  strengthened.  This  is  one  of  the  most  important  gaps  that  the \nUrban Public and Environment Health Sector Development Program (UPEHSDP) will address, \nand it will support this by creating an urban public and environmental health unit (UPEHU) under \nthe LGD. \n \n18. \nLearning  from  Past  Experiences  and  Scaling-Up  Good  Practices.  The  innovative \nPSP developed under the UPHCP can be further scaled up and utilized in the efficient delivery \n\n \n\n\f 6 \n\n14\n\nof  other  UPEH  services.  Similarly,  pro-poor  targeting  through  a  PSP  framework  implemented \nunder  the  UPHCP  can  also  be  further  scaled  up.  Under  the  Urban  Governance  and \nFP  the  Government  has  introduced  performance-\nInfrastructure  Improvement  Project  (UGIIP),PF\nbased  intergovernmental  grant  transfers  in  selected  pourashavas,  and  these  have  proved \neffective  in  creating  incentives  for  the  pourashavas  to  improve  their  revenue  generation  and \ngovernance.  Similarly,  the  practices  to  increase  citizens'  involvement  in  UGIIPs  have  also \nproved to be successful (Supplementary Appendix H). The SDP endeavors to mainstream these \npractices  nationally  through  systematic  programmatic  interventions.  The  observations,  lessons \nlearned,  and  recommendations  from  the  sector  assistance  program  evaluation  have  also \nassisted in the design of the Program (footnote 9). \n \n19.  Mainstreaming  Private  Sector  Participation.  Various  organizational  and  fiscal \nconstraints have made ULBs ill-equipped to effectively manage municipal solid waste. A well-\nstructured PSP for  municipal solid waste management (MSWM) can bring private finances for \nmodernizing MSWM, increase efficiencies of MSWM, enable cost saving and raise productivity, \nand  improve  the  quality  of  services.  However,  ULBs  need  to  change  their  role  from  that  of  a \nservice provider to that of a services facilitator, simplify bureaucratic processes within traditional \nMSWM, and enable performance-based PSP (Supplementary Appendix I).   \n \n20.  Making  Public  Expenditure  Work  for  the  Poor.  A  concentrated  effort  is  needed  to \nincrease  access  to  public  and  environmental  health  services  by  the  poor  and  marginalized \nsectors of the urban population. The major challenge in reaching the urban poor is that there is \nno systematic identification of these people. Hence, the main challenge is to develop policies to \nsystematically  identify  the  urban  poor,  with  the  next  challenge  being  to  provide  the  identified \nurban  poor  with  entitlement  cards  so  that  they  can  access  targeted  public  services  and \nsubsidies.  Under  the  UPHCP,  various  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  engaged  to \nprovide  PHC  services  conduct  household  surveys  to  identify  and  provide  entitlement  cards  to \nthe urban poor.PF\n \nAlignment  with  Strategy  2020.  The  long-term  strategic  framework  2008\u20132020 \n21. \n(Strategy  2020)PF\nFP  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  highlights  the  years  of  neglect  and \ninsufficient investment in infrastructure that has led to overcrowded, unsanitary, unhealthy living \nconditions in the region's large cities. Strategy 2020 states that ADB will be investing in water, \nsanitation, and waste-management systems to improve public health. In addition, Strategy 2020 \ncommits to reducing the carbon footprint of Asia's cities, among others, by supporting municipal \nplanning  and  addressing  a  range  of  environmental  problems  resulting  from  rapid  urbanization \nincluding water pollution, improving systems for solid waste management, and reducing urban \nwaste.  The  proposed  SDP  is  fully  aligned  with  Strategy  2020  by  improving  UPEH  through \nstrengthening  the  national  stewardship  role;  developing  capacities  and  institutional  framework; \nand supporting right policies, regulations, and effective investments in waste management and \nfood safety.  \n \nCountry  Operations  Business  Plan.

The  UPEHSDP  will  contribute  to  human \ndevelopment through improvements in the living conditions of residents in the project cities. This \nwill be through investments and policy reforms to improve public and environmental health. The \nproject  loan  will  improve  solid  waste  management  and  food  safety  in  the  project  cities, \nbenefiting  both  poor  and  non-poor.  Solid  waste  management  investments  include  integrated \nwaste management for the urban poor. Improving pro-poor targeting is one of the policy reform \nareas under the program loan. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  overall  impact  of  the  SDP  is  to  improve  the  public  and  environmental  health \n23. \nconditions  in  the  urban  areas  in  six  city  corporations  (Barisal,  Chittagong,  Dhaka,  Khulna, \nRajshahi,  and  Sylhet)  and  in  pourashavas.  The  successful  implementation  of  the  SDP  will  (i) \nhelp  reduce  child  mortality  and  morbidity  by  reducing  the  prevalence  of  waterborne  and  food-\nrelated  diseases,  (ii)  increase  productivity  by  reducing  overall  morbidity,  and  (iii)  improve  the \nquality of life of urban citizens. The ensuing program will improve the health status of the poor in \nurban  areas  and  assist  Bangladesh  make  progress  on  the  Millennium  Development  Goals \n(MDGs) relating to child and maternal health care and communicable diseases (MDGs 4, 5, and \n6), and improve urban sanitation (MDG 7). The program and project loans under the SDP are \ndesigned to complement each other in achieving progress towards these key goals.  \n \nB. \n\nThe Program Loan \n\n1. \n\nOutcomes \n\n24. \nThe  reforms  under  the  program  loan  will  help  achieve  the  sustainable  provision  and \noperation of improved public and environmental health services in the urban areas, including the \nsix  city  corporations  and  the  pourashavas.  The  reforms  include  (i)  strengthening  institutional \narrangements,  (ii)  improving  financial  sustainability,  (iii)  improving  public  and  environmental \nhealth  service  delivery,  and  (iv)  strengthening  governance  and  management.  Appendix  4 \npresents  the  policy  matrix  of  the  Program  along  with  the  strategic  goals,  key  targets,  and \nprocess for each output.  \n \n\na. \n\nStrengthening Institutional Arrangements \n\n25. \nPolicy Reform Area 1.1: Establishing the Urban Public and Environmental Health \nUnit.  A  unit  for  UPEH  will  be  established  under  the  LGD  to  provide  national  stewardship  and \ncoordination  to  (i)  ensure  that  adequate  attention  is  given  to  public  and  environmental  health \nissues; (ii) improve coordination among the different ministries, departments, and divisions that \nhave  activities  relating  to  UPEH  in  the  city  corporations  and  pourashavas;  (iii)  mobilize  and \ndirect resources to city corporations and pourashavas for public and environmental health; and \n(iv) ensure enabling policy, legal, fiscal, and institutional mechanisms exist to strengthen public \nand environmental health in urban areas. \n \n26. \nPolicy  Reform  Area  1.2:  Establishing  a  National  Urban  Public  and  Environmental \nHealth  Committee.  Prevention  and  promotion  of  health  involves  multisector  approaches, \nincluding provision of sanitation and drinking water, ensuring environmental health, food safety, \nand  hygiene,  safe  disposal  of  solid  and  health  care  wastes,  and  health  education.  The \nmandates for these essential health functions are fragmented between various departments of \nthe  Government  and  between  the  public  and  private  sectors.  A  more  coherent  approach  is \n\n \n\n\f 8 \n\nrequired to ensure that the various entities involved in providing public and environmental health \ncoordinate  their  activities.  To  avoid  duplication  of  committees  and  achieve  desired  outcomes, \nthe existing National Urban Primary Health Care Coordination Committee will become broadly \nbased  under  the  national  urban  public  and  environmental  health  committee  (NUPEHC).  It  will \ncover  public  and  environmental  issues  by  inducting  additional  members  from  the  Ministry  of \nEnvironment  and  Forests  (MOEF),  Ministry  of  Establishment,  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF), \nMinistry  of  Industry  (MOI),  Ministry  of  Women  and  Children  Affairs,  and  Ministry  of  Food  and \nDisaster Management (MOFDM) and their departments that are responsible for taking action to \nsupport good health and regulate and control unhealthy conditions. The NUPEHC will meet at \nleast annually.PF\n \n27. \nPolicy  Reform  Area  1.3:  Strengthening  Health  and  Conservancy  Departments  of \nCity  Corporations. The program  will support review, reorganization, and strengthening of the \ncity  corporation  health  and  conservancy  departments  to  better  match  the  institutional \ncapabilities to deal with complex and challenging mandates given to the city corporations. The \nrestructuring  will  take  into  consideration  the  need  for  capacities  and  skills  for  contracting  and \nmanaging PSPs for public and environmental health services specific to these departments.  \n \n\nFP  \n\n18\n\nb. \n\nImproving Financial Sustainability \n\nthen \n\nto  account \n\ntax  collection \n\ntax  assessments,  and \n\nPolicy  Reform  Area  2.1:  Improving  Municipal  Finances.  Municipal  finance  reforms \n28. \nwill be undertaken to ensure that scaling-up of public and environmental health interventions by \ncity  corporations  is  done  sustainable  way.  This  will  be  achieved  by  introducing  measures  to \nimprove  the  financial  management  of  ULBs,  improve  their  tax  revenues,  and  diversify  the \nrevenue  sources.  The  first  step  will  be  to  improve  the  collection  of  outstanding  holding  tax \n(holding tax includes property, electricity, water, and conservancy taxes), followed by updating \nholding \nthe \nrationalizing \ncommercialization and industrialization of urban areas. The LGD will issue guidelines to the city \ncorporations to accelerate collection of outstanding holding taxes, update assessment of holding \ntaxes,  and  introduce  an  industry,  commercial,  and  institutional  tariff  based  on  earnings  and \nmunicipal  services  provided.  The  LGD  will  also  provide  guidelines  for  city  corporations  to \nmodernize and computerize financial management systems.  \n \n29. \nIntroducing  Performance-Based  Targeted  Grant \nMechanisms. Performance-based transfers to pourashavas under the UGIIP have succeeded \nin  improving  governance  and  management  of  pourashavas,  including  increased  tax  collection \nand improved citizen participation. The program will support the augmentation of block grants to \nthe  city  corporations  and  pourashavas  through  performance-based  grant  mechanisms,  among \nother things, to link increased UPEH block grants to increased city corporation and pourashava \nholding tax collection and to increased allocation of city corporation and pourashava resources \nto  public  and  environmental  health  in  their  respective  areas.  The  LGD  will  prepare  revised \nprocedures  for  block  grant  allocations  to  city  corporations  and  pourashavas  to  provide \n19\nallocations for public and environmental health.PF\n \n\nPolicy  Reform  Area  2.2: \n\nfor \n\nFP \n\n                                                 \n18\n\n19\n\nP Under the ongoing UPHCP, a national urban primary health care coordination committee was established, chaired \nby the minister of the MOLGRDC. \nP The Government mechanism for the central support to city corporations and pourashavas is through block grants \nand  grants-in-aid from the  LGD. The grants-in-aid are for specific  activities under the  development budget; block \ngrants are for general budgetary support. \n\nP\nP\n\f \n\n9\n\nc. \n\nImproving Public and Environmental Health Service Delivery \n\n30. \nPolicy Reform Area 3.1: Strengthening Solid waste Management. The program will \nsupport  the  preparation  of  a  strategy  which  (i)  establishes  objectives,  goals,  and  targets;  (ii) \ndrives up standards evenly across the whole country; and (iii) establishes planning guidelines to \ninstruct  and  guide  implementation  of  solid  waste  management.  The  LGD  will  establish  a \ntechnical committee with representation from other ministerial bodies responsible for aspects of \nwaste  management,  such  as  the  Department  of  Environment  of  the  MOEF,  the  Ministry  of \nHealth  and  Family  Welfare  (MOHFW),  MOFDM,  and  MOI,  to  oversee  the  preparation  of  the \nNational  Waste  Reduce,  Reuse  and  Recycle  (3R)  Strategy  and  to  put  forward  the  final \ndocument  for  subsequent  adoption.  It  will  then  issue  planning  guidelines  which  provide  a \ncomprehensive framework under which city corporations and pourashavas are to improve waste \nmanagement  and  implement  the  National  Waste  Reduce,  Reuse  and  Recycle  (3R)  Strategy. \nThe  program  will  also  support  setting  apart  land  for  sanitary  landfill  sites,  and  construct  the \nfacilities. \n \nPolicy  Reform  Area  3.2:  Strengthening  Medical  Waste  Management.  The \n31. \nGovernment  adopted  the  Medical  Waste  (Management  and  Processing)  Rules  under  the \nBangladesh  Environment  Conservation  Act,  1995.  The  LGD  will  issue  guidelines  to  city \ncorporations and pourashavas for the implementation of the Medical Waste (Management and \nProcessing)  Rules,  which  mandate  city  corporations  and  pourashavas  for  medical  waste \ncollection,  transportation,  and  safe  disposal.  City  corporations  and  pourashavas  will  prepare \nmedical  waste  management  action  plans  in  accordance  with  the  LGD  instructions.  All  city \ncorporations  will  set  apart  land  for  medical  waste  treatment  and  disposal,  and  construct  the \nfacilities.  \n \n32. \nPolicy  Outcome  3.3:  Strengthening  Food  and  Water  Safety.  The  National  Food \nSafety Advisory Council, chaired by the minister of Local Government, Rural Development and \nCooperatives  (MOLGRDC)  as  provided  in  the  Pure  Foods  Rules,  1967,  as  amended  in  2005, \nwill  convey  and  meet  at  least  once  a  year  and  take  actions  as  per  National  Food  Safety \nAdvisory Council mandates. The LGD will constitute a technical committee with representatives \nfrom the MOFDM, Department of Environment of MOEF, and MOHFW to prepare guidelines for \nthe  sanitary  slaughter  of  animals  at  the  city  corporation  and  pourashava  level  in  accordance \nwith the provisions of Animal Slaughter (Restriction) and Meat Control Act, 1957. The LGD will \nissue  these  guidelines  and  advise  city  corporations  on  the  requirements  to  modernize  the \nslaughter of animals and the handling of meat products. The LGD will advise city corporations to \ndevelop  a  water  safety  plan  to  be  verified  annually  by  the  Department  of  Public  Health \nEngineering. It will issue an order specifying the number of drinking water samples to be tested \nby the Department of Public Health Engineering by unit population and the testing parameters \nand standards. \n \n33. \nPolicy  Reform  Area  3.4:  Strengthening  Primary  Health  Care  Financing.  The \nprogram  will  support  effective  implementation  of  the  urban  PHC  sustainability  fund.  The \nsustainability fund provides for funds which are raised through user fees at contracted-out PHC \nfacilities and through PSP to be deposited into designated accounts. The funds are to be used \nby city corporations to enhance the long-term sustainability of health care provision. In addition, \na one-time deposit equivalent to 1% of the annual revenue budget of the city corporation will be \ndeposited towards the sustainability fund by city corporations.  \n \n34. \nprogram  will  support  enactment  of  bylaws \n\nPolicy  Reform  Area  3.5:  Strengthening  the  Legal  Framework  for  UPEH.  The \ntowards \n\nthat  will  change  public  behavior \n\n \n\n\f 10 \n\nenvironmental  public  goods  and  encourage  more  appropriate  attitudes.  This  will  include \npreparing  model  bylaws  and  enacting  rules  that  can  change  public  behavior  towards \nenvironmental  public  goods  and  encourage  3Rs  (reduce,  reuse  and  recycle).  Rules,  bylaws, \nregulations,  and  other  legal  measures  will  be  supported  by  the  Program  to  make  national \nordinances  and  laws  relating  to  public  and  environmental  health  more  effective  locally  and  to \nenable  city  corporations  and  pourashavas  to  implement  their  public  and  environmental  health \nmandates  more  effectively.  The  LGD,  in  cooperation  with  the  MOFDM,  MOEF,  MOHFW,  and \nMOI,  will  prepare  and  provide  sample  bylaws,  rules,  and  guidelines  (as  appropriate)  on  food \nsafety,  solid  waste  and  medical  waste  disposal,  and  environmental  health  to  city  corporations \nand  pourashavas  to  enable  them  to  effectively  deliver  their  public  and  environmental  health \nmandates. \n \n\nd. \n\nStrengthening Governance and Management \n\n35. \nPolicy  Reform  Area  4.1:  Enabling  Private  Sector  Participation  in  UPEH.  The \nprogram will enable PSP by supporting development of appropriate guidelines for PSP in UPEH \nby  tapping  into  related  PSP  experiences  of  the  LGD  in  the  delivery  of  PHC  services  and  city \ncorporation experiences elsewhere. City corporations have an adequate enabling framework for \nprivate  sector  engagement  in  infrastructure  and  service  delivery.  However,  this  has  not  been \nproperly  accessed  to  improve  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  service  delivery.  Clear \nguidelines  will  enable  city  corporations  and  pourashavas  to  expand  the  use  of  PSP  for \nimproving  UPEH  service  delivery.  The  investment  projects  have  been  prepared  within  a  PSP \nframework and designed to produce revenue for the city corporations or to reduce expenditure \nto the minimum necessary, while expanding services.  \n \n36. \nPolicy Reform Area 4.2: Improving Citizens' Participation in the Delivery of UPEH \nServices.  A  variety  of  successful  innovations  enabling  citizens'  participation  in  the  delivery  of \nurban services have been introduced through the UGIIP in selected pourashavas. The Program \nwill support review of these successful innovations to develop appropriate guidelines for greater \nparticipation of citizens in the delivery of UPEH services by city corporations.  \n \n37. \nPolicy Reform Area 4.3: Improving Pro-Poor Targeting. Poverty reduction has been \nthe  focus  of  development  programs  in  Bangladesh  and  measures  need  to  be  established  to \nenable  the  poor  to  receive  services  targeted  to  support  them.  In  the  rural  areas,  this  is \naccomplished  with  vulnerable  group  development  cards  distributed  by  the  union  council  chair, \nand  similar  systems  need  to  be  in  place  in  the  urban  areas.  The  program  will  support \nidentification  of  the  poor  and  very  poor  in  the  six  city  corporations.  The  LGD  will  constitute  a \ntechnical  working  group  to  develop  procedures  and  guidelines  for  city  corporations  to  identify \nthe poor in their locality and for pro-poor targeting. The experiences gained in pro-poor targeting \nunder the UPHCP will be reviewed by the working group. The LGD will provide guidelines to the \ncity corporations for the issuance of entitlement cards to the identified very poor, and introduce \nmaternal and health care for the very poor in the six city corporations. \n \n\n2. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n38. \nThe Government has requested a loan of SDR 44,895,000 ($70 million equivalent) from \nADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  (Asian  Development  Fund)  to  help  finance  the  program.  The \nloan will have an amortization period of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an \nannual  interest  charge  of  1%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter. The loan proceeds will be available for withdrawal in three tranches ($30 million, $20 \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nmillion, and $20 million) equivalent upon compliance with the agreed tranche conditions as set \nout in the policy matrix (Appendix 4).  \n \n39. \nIn determining the amount of the program loan, the following factors were considered: (i) \nthe relative importance of UPEH in terms of public spending, (ii) the scope and strength of the \nreform  package  in  UPEH,  and  (iii)  the  short-  and  medium-term  costs  of  the  reforms  and  the \nbenefits and cost savings that would result from implementing the reform package (Appendix 4). \nThe  loan  amount  covers  part  of  the  adjustment  costs  for  the  measures  included  in  the  policy \nmatrix of the UPEHSDP (Supplementary Appendix J).PF\n \n\nFP  \n\n20\n\n3. \n\nProgram Management \n\n21\n\nProgram  Implementation  Arrangements. The executing agencies will be the Finance \n40. \nDivision  of  the  MOF  and  the  LGD  of  the  MOLGRDC.  The  six  city  corporations  will  be  the \nimplementing  agencies.  The  organizational  chart  indicating  the  program  management  and \nimplementing structure is set out in Appendix 5 and Supplementary Appendix K. The NUPEHC \nchaired by the minister of the MOLGRDC will have representatives from the MOF; the Ministry \nof  Establishment;  MOHFW;  MOEF;  MOFDM;  Ministry  of  Fisheries  and  Livestock;  Ministry  of \nLaw,  Justice  and  Parliamentary  Affairs;  mayors  of  city  corporations;  representatives  of  NGOs; \nand private sector representatives involved in public and environmental health.PF\nFP The NUPEHC \nwill  meet  at  least  once  a  year  to  provide  overall  stewardship,  enable  strong  interministerial \ncoordination, and ensure greater involvement in and ownership of the UPEHSDP by mayors of \nthe  six  city  corporations.  For  UPEHSDP  implementation,  the  apex  body  will  be  the  national \nprogram steering committee (NPSC) to be chaired by the secretary of the LGD. The NPSC will \nmeet three times in the first 2 years of the UPEHSDP implementation, and twice a year in the \nremaining  years,  to  review  and  approve  budgets  and  guide  the  implementation  of  the \nUPEHSDP.  The  NPSC  will  ensure  that  policies  and  programs  concerning  UPEH  are \ncoordinated  and  program  impediments  resolved.  The  NPSC  will  have  representation  from  the \nministries and ULBs represented in the NPSC. The UPEHU will be the secretariat to the NPSC.  \n \n41. \nAn UPEHU will be established under the LGD to provide program support. The program \ndirector of at least joint secretary rank will head the UPEHU and will be assisted by three deputy \nprogram  directors  of  deputy  secretary  rank  for  (i)  program  implementation  (on  deputation, \npreferably  from  the  Bangladesh  Civil  Services  [BCS]  administration  cadre),  (ii)  financial \nmanagement and municipal finance (on deputation, preferably from the BCS audit and accounts \ncadre), and (iii) policy reform and capacity development (on deputation, preferably from the BCS \neconomic cadre). UPEHU will employ women to the extent possible, as per the gender action \nplan (Supplementary Appendix L). Additional technical policy personnel will be seconded from \nministries, including the MOHFW, MOEF, MOFDM, and other ministries, as appropriate, or hired \nfrom the market. A representative from Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division will \nbe  involved  in  the  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  UPEHU  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day \nUPEHSDP implementation involving (i) detailed program planning and scheduling; (ii) support of \ncity corporation program implementing units in procurement of goods and works; (iii) recruitment \nand  supervision  of  international  and  national  consultants,  other  technical  assistance  (including \nnecessary assistance for potential clean development mechanism [CDM] activities), and training; \nprogram  accounting,  including  arranging  for  necessary  audits;  (iv)  disbursement  of  funds, \n\n                                                 \n20\n\nP Policy measures are expected to generate cost savings of $326.1 million, which is much higher than the estimated \nprogram  budget  adjustment  costs  and  compensatory  measures  of  about  $70.0  million.  In  annual  terms,  a  net \nsavings  of  about  $85.1  million  will  be  realized,  compared  with  the  LGD  total  recurrent  budget  of  $89.3  million  in \nFY2008. \nP Representatives of development partners supporting UPEH may be invited as observers. \n\n21\n\n \n\nP\nP\n\f 12 \n\n(where  available)  and \n\nincluding timely submission of withdrawal applications; (v) management of the imprest account; \nand  (vi)  reporting  to  ADB  on  program  progress.  The  UPEHU  will  be  supported  under  the \ndevelopment  budget  during  its  initial  years  of  operation  under  the  UPEHSDP.  However,  from \nFY2017 the expenditure on core civil servant positions to the UPEHU will be financed from the \nGovernment's recurrent budget.  \n \n42. \nThe  city  corporation  UPEH  coordination  committees  will  be  chaired  by  the  mayor.  A \nward UPEH coordination committee will be chaired by local commissioners/councilors and co-\nfemale \nchaired  by  zonal  health  and/or  conservancy  officers \ncommissioners/councilors,  with  a  membership  that  represents  all  local  stakeholders,  including \ninformal  settlers.  The  chief  executive  officer  will  be  the  program  manager  assisted  by  the  city \ncorporation  health  officer  (deputy  program  manager)  and  the  city  corporation  conservancy \nofficer (deputy program manager). City corporation program implementation units (CCPIUs) will \nbe  established  in  each  of  the  six  city  corporations.  Each  CCPIU  will  comprise  personnel \nrecruited  by  the  UPEHU,  and  will  include  the  following:  program  officer,  conservancy  officer, \nfood  safety  officer,  procurement  specialist,  accountant,  safeguard  and  community  mobilization \nofficer,  information  technology  officer,  and  assistant  civil  engineer.  Each  city  corporation  will \nalso  assign  technical  personnel  from  the  consultant  teams  to  work  with  CCPIU  staff  to  help \nimplement subprojects and to transfer implementation capabilities to the CCPIU.   \n \nConsultants  from  three  firms  (program  support  consultancy,  design  supervision  and \n43. \nconstruction consultancy, and financial management and municipal finance consultancy) to be \nhired under the UPEHSDP will provide policy and program support on aspects relating to solid \nwaste  management,  medical  waste,  food  and  water  safety,  institutional  reforms,  municipal \nfinance reforms, strengthening pro-poor targeting and citizens' participation, among other things. \nThe  UPEHU  will  also  anchor  potential  technical  assistance  support  from  bilateral  and \nmultilateral  development  partners  including  the  World  Health  Organization,  the  Food  and \nAgriculture Organization, and the Japan International Cooperation Agency in the areas of water \nsafety and solid waste management. All technical working groups constituted by the LGD as per \nthe policy matrix will have female representation to the extent possible. \n \n44. \nImplementation  Period.  The  program  implementation  period  is  from  December  2009  to \nDecember  2016.  The  Government  will  have  to  complete  all  conditions  for  the  first  tranche \nbefore  its  release,  which  is  expected  by  December  2009.  The  second  tranche  release  is \nexpected  before  December  2011,  and  the  third  tranche  is  expected  to  be  released  before \nDecember 2013. Details of the tranche release conditions are in Appendix 4.PF\n\n22\n\nFP \n\n45. \nProcurement  and  Disbursement.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  foreign \nexchange  cost  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB \nmember  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  (Appendix  6)  and  imports  financed  by  other \nbilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  In  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of \nDisbursement  Procedures  and  Related  Requirement  for  Program  Loans,PF\nFP  the  reimbursement \nprocedure  will  be  used  to  disburse  the  loan  proceeds  based  on  certification  by  the  Government. \nSupporting  import  documentation  will  not  be  required  if,  during  each  year  that  loan  proceeds  are \nexpected  to  be  disbursed,  the  total  value  of  the  imports  minus  imports  from  nonmember \ncountries, ineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development assistance, \nis equal to or greater than the amount of the loan expected to be disbursed during that year. \nWith  each  withdrawal  request,  the  Government  will  certify  its  compliance  with  this  formula. \n\n23\n\n                                                 \n22\n\nP  The third tranche disbursement is projected to be at the end of 2013, but the program loan duration is until the end \nof 2016 to monitor the reforms progress. \nP  ADB. 1998.

ADB reserves the \nright to audit the use of the loan proceeds. \n\n46. \nCounterpart  Funds.  The Government will use the counterpart funds generated by the \nprogram loan, under arrangements satisfactory to ADB, to support sector reform and meet the \nadjustment costs associated with the loan. Further, the counterpart funds will be transferred \nfrom the MOF to the LGD to meet the costs and counterpart funding requirements for implementing \nthe sector reform. \n\n47. \nProgram  Performance  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  The LGD will continually monitor \nthe implementation of the program and its impact, in line with the program framework and outcome \nindicators agreed upon by ADB and the Government (Appendix 1). Further, the LGD will submit \nto ADB quarterly reports until the program is completed. Data from the program implementation \nplan, annual report, audit reports, and auditor\u2019s opinion will be used to monitor the progress of \nthe Program. \n \nC. \n\nThe Project Loan \n\n1. \n\nOutcomes \n\nThe Project will enable the urban population, primarily in the six city corporations, to use \n48. \nimproved  public  and  environmental  health  services.  It  is  expected  to  result  in  a  strengthened \nand  sustainable  urban  public  and  environment  health  system  with  improved  solid  waste  and \nmedical  waste  management,  food  safety,  and  capacity  of  the  LGD  and  city  corporations  for \npublic and environment health. The project will cover the six city corporations covering 34% of \nall urban areas in Bangladesh as per the 2001 census.PF\n \n\n24\n\nFP \n\n2. \n\nOutputs \n\n49. \nThe  project  loan  will  focus  on  improving  the  efficiency  and  quality  of  public  and \nenvironmental  health  in  several  areas  where  additional  resources  are  required  to  accelerate \naccess and program efficiency and support the overall development of the sector. The project \nconsists  of  three  components:  (i)  solid  waste  management;  (ii)  food  safety;  and  (iii)  program \nmanagement, institutional support, and capacity development.  \n\na. \n\nComponent A: Solid Waste Management \n\nThe  solid  waste  management  component  will  have  two  subcomponents:  (i)  municipal \n\n50. \nsolid waste management, and (ii) medical waste management (Supplementary Appendix M). \n \n\ni. \n\nMunicipal Solid Waste Management \n\n51. \nThe municipal solid waste management component complements the establishment of a \nnational  strategy  and  planning  framework  under  the  program  loan,  with  infrastructure \ninvestments to improve the efficiency of municipal solid waste management services.  \n \n52. \nPrimary  Collection  for  Urban  Poor.  This  subcomponent  will  focus  on  improving  the \nservice coverage and quality of primary collection in the urban, underserved poor communities \nto be piloted (at least one in each of the six city corporations). A community-based initiative will \n\n                                                 \n24\n\nP  10.3  million  population  in  the  six  city  corporations  out  of  a  total  urban  population  of  31.0  million  as  per  the  2001 \ncensus; according to recent estimates this figure is now close to 40%. \n\n \n\nP\n\f 14 \n\nbe utilized, incorporating a partnership approach in municipal service delivery. City corporations \nwill  contract  community-based  organizations  and  NGOs  to  undertake  service  delivery \nimprovements with institutional, technical, and financial dimensions. Improved service coverage \nand quality is expected through door-to-door collection, which aims to supplement solid waste \nmanagement  services  provided  by  the  formal  system.  The  subcomponent  also  includes \neducational  campaigns  to  encourage  the  3Rs  (reduce,  reuse,  and  recycle)  and  source \nsegregation of waste in line with guidelines developed by the Department of Environment of the \nMOEF. \n \n53. \nSecondary  Collection  and  Transportation.  The  interface  between  the  private  sector \nprimary collection and the municipal-run secondary collection system is the critical factor driving \nthe  performance  of  the  waste-management  system.  Through  mechanization,  improved \nefficiency of the transfer of waste from primary collection tricycles to waste transport vehicles is \nneeded. Secondary or small transfer stations (STSs) serve this purpose. These transfer stations \nare designed specifically for the purpose of improving the efficiency of waste transfer between \nprimary and secondary collection vehicles, and increasing the quantity of waste material hauled \non  each  long-distance  vehicle  trip.  By  designing  STSs  so  that  waste  can  be  transferred  onto \nstandard  freight  transport  vehicles,  more  highly  capitalized  companies  can  be  attracted  to  the \nwaste business. PSP will increase competition and, as long as standards are ensured, service \nquality  and  efficiency  will  also  improve.  Capacity  development  of  the  city  corporations  is  an \nessential part of improving waste-management standards.  \n \n54. \nIntegrated Waste Treatment Facilities. Investments will be made to develop integrated \nwaste treatment facilities, combining composting, landfill, and other treatment technologies. Five \nlandfill  sites  are  proposed  to  be  constructed  in  the  five  city  corporations  (Barisal,  Chittagong, \nKhulna, Rajshahi, and Sylhet). Each location has been chosen strategically to attain maximum \neconomies  of  scale  by  being  located  near  both  the  city  corporation  area  and  nearby \npourashavas.  The  high  proportion  of  biodegradable  material  in  the  waste  stream  means  that \ncomposting is an important treatment option. For the purposes of utilizing the CDM, the option \nof landfill gas extraction or composting will be considered. By virtue of their nature, landfills are \nlarge  investment  projects  with  minimum  or  no  return  on  the  investment  and  are  therefore \nfinancially unviable. Consequently, they are not operated by private service providers. However, \nan  element  of  cost  recovery  is  possible,  based  on  the  assumption  that  compost  generation  is \nundertaken  from  the  solid  waste  or  CDM  schemes  (including  landfill  gas  extraction),  and  is \nutilized as a revenue source. Ensuring that municipal finances are strong is important for long-\nterm  sustainability  of  municipal  solid  waste  management  services,  which  the  Project  will  also \nsupport. \n \n\nii. \n\nMedical Waste Management \n\nThe  project  will  support  establishment  of  sound  and  effective  medical  waste \n55. \nmanagement under PSP in all of the six city corporations; six medical waste management units \nwill be implemented in the six city corporations. Income for medical waste management facilities \nare  the  tariffs  obtained  from  the  different  medical  diagnostic  centers  and  health  care  units \n(hospitals and clinics) based on size and capacity. \n \n\nb. \n\nComponent B: Food Safety \n\nUnder the food safety component, two subcomponents will be supported by the Project: \n\n56. \nfood laboratories and a training center, and modern slaughterhouses. \n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\ni. \n\nFood Laboratories and Training Center \n\n57. \nTwo  food  laboratories  will  be  constructed,  one  each  in  Dhaka  and  Chittagong.  The \nDhaka laboratory will have an additional training center component. The existing Dhaka facility \nwill be renovated and supplied with modern equipment; the Chittagong laboratory will be a new \nconstruction.  Revenue  for  the  food  laboratories  will  be  in  the  form  of  analysis  tests  for  both \nDhaka and Chittagong. The Dhaka unit will also provide training courses on food safety to the \nvarious food safety inspectors in both public and private organizations. \n \n\nii. \n\nModern Slaughterhouses \n\n \n58.  Modern slaughterhouses will be established for preparation and processing of standard \nquality of meat and meat products and other economic by-products. Establishment of a central \nhigh-capacity  slaughterhouse  can  achieve  this.  Central  production  will  enable  easier  quality \ncontrol and will require less labor for production and supervision. A slaughterhouse will be built \nin  each  of  the  six  city  corporation  areas.  Dhaka  and  Chittagong  will  feature  large  (type  1) \nslaughterhouses while the others in Khulna, Rajshahi, Barisal and Sylhet, will be smaller units \n(type 2).PF\n \n\nFP  \n\n25\n\nc. \n\nComponent C: Program Management, Institutional Support, and \nCapacity Development \n\n59. \nComponent  C  consists  of  three  subcomponents:  (i)  program  management  and \nimplementation support, (ii) financial management and strengthening municipal finances, and (iii) \npolicy reform and capacity development support. \n \n\ni. \n\nProgram Management and Implementation Support \n\n60. \nConsultants  will  be  engaged  to  assist  the  UPEHU  in  implementing,  monitoring,  and \nsupervising  the  Program.  Consulting  support  will  include  (i)  program  management  and \nmonitoring;  (ii)  detailed  planning  and  design  activities;  (iii)  contract  structuring,  tendering, \nexecution,  and  management;  and  (iv)  construction  supervision.  Consulting  services  will  also \ninclude engagement of NGOs to manage some program activities.  \n \n\nii. \n\nFinancial Management and Strengthening Municipal Finances \n\n61. \nThe  subcomponent  will  assist  the  UPEHSDP  in  substantially  reforming  and  improving \nfinancial  management  of  city  corporations  and  the  UPEHSDP,  introducing  modernized  and \ncomputerized  accounting  systems,  and  performance-based  budgeting.  It  will  use  information \ntechnology to enhance financial management, improve tax collection, and expand the tax base \nto  strengthen  municipal  finances.  Regular  concurrent  audits  of  the  UPEHSDP  will  also  be \nconducted  under  the  subcomponent  to  ensure  a  high  degree  of  adherence  to  various \nprocurement and financial management guidelines.  \n \n\n \n\niii. \n\nPolicy Reform and Capacity Development Support \n\n62. \nthe \nThe  policy  reform  and  capacity  development  subcomponent  will  support \nimplementation  of  the  policy  reform  program  of  the  UPEHSDP  and  assist  in  capacity \n\n                                                 \n25\n\nP  Type  1  units  will  have  a  maximum  capacity  of  around  3,000  animals  slaughtered  per  day  while  type  2  units  will \nhave a maximum capacity of around 2,000 animals slaughtered per day.  \n\n \n\n \n\nP\n\f 16 \n\ndevelopment.  This  will  include  (i)  supporting  the  technical  working  groups  constituted  for  the \nreforms; (ii) conducting pro-poor targeting surveys; (iii) monitoring and evaluation; (iv) mitigating \nrisks  for  the  poor  and  women  resulting  from  any  project  or  program  interventions;  (v) \nstrengthening legal aspects; (vi) public awareness campaigns (including educational campaigns \nto  encourage  the  3Rs  [reduce,  reuse,  and  recycle]  and  source  segregation  of  waste);  (vii) \nidentifying  and  developing \ntraining  modules,  and \nguidelines and manuals; and (viii) providing for training. The capacity development will include \nassistance to accelerate the reform program and ensuring sustainability of project investments. \n \n\ninstitutional  strengthening  measures, \n\n3. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n \n63. \nOpportunities  to  utilize  the  CDM  for  emission  reductions  and  revenue  streams  exist  at \nthe  five  proposed  landfill  sites.  Emission  reductions  from  landfill  gas  extraction  or  composting \nactivities at the future landfills can be feasible over time. The feasibility of the Project depends \non competent and professional landfill management. In view of the transaction costs, developing \nCDM for a composting project is feasible with larger quantities or bundling of projects. Another \nspecial  feature  of  the  Program  is  to  mainstream  lessons  learned  from  successful  prior  and \nongoing  projects  supported  by  ADB  in  the  LGD.  This  will  help  to  (i)  mainstream  interventions \nfrom  project  set-up  to  a  program  set-up,  (ii)  scale-up  successful  interventions,  and  (iii)  ensure \nsustainability  of  such  good  practices.  The  UGIIP  successfully  introduced  performance-based \ngrants  and  intergovernmental  fiscal  transfers  to  selected  pourashavas.  The  pourashavas \nresponded  by  improving  their  tax  collection  and  increasing  the  revenue  base,  among  other \nthings. The Program will support mainstreaming of this successful effort by allocating funds for \nUPEH that will be accessed by city corporations and pourashavas against certain performance \nbenchmarks. \n \n64. \nUGIIP also demonstrated that, by providing appropriate forums for citizens' participation \nin municipal affairs, the overall effectiveness of municipal governance and urban basic services \ndo  improve.  The  Program  will  support  the  mainstreaming  and  implementations  of  UGIIP's \nsuccessful initiatives relating to citizen's participation in the six city corporations. Urban poor do \nnot  have  any  identification  or  entitlement  cards,  unlike  rural  poor  people.  The  ADB-supported \nsecond  UPHCP  (footnote  13)  introduced  performance-based  pro-poor  targeting  through  PSP. \nThe  experiences  in  this  project  have  demonstrated  that  identifying  the  poor  and  providing \nentitlement  cards  is  critical  to  developing  effective  accountability  of  service  providers  so  that \npublic  expenditures  reach  the  poor  for  targeted  interventions.  The  Program  will  support \nmainstreaming of the identification of the poor in the six city corporations, and institutionalizing \npro-poor  targeting  in  the  city  corporation  areas.  The  UPHCP  has  demonstrated  that  even \ncomplex  PHC  services  can  be  contracted-out  through  well-structured  PSP  for  delivery  of \neffective  package  of  basic  health  services.  The  LGD  and  city  corporations  have  broad \nexperience of implementing this PSP approach for around a decade. The Program will support \nexpanding this successful approach to other aspects of UPEH service delivery. \n \n\n4. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\nThe Project is estimated to cost $80.0 million, including taxes and duties of $1.7 million \n65. \n(Table  1).  The  cost  estimates  are  based  on  the  three  components  at  2009  prices.  The  cost \nestimates are presented in more detail in Appendix 7 (detailed estimates are in Supplementary \nAppendix N). \n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\n5. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n66. \nThe Government has requested a loan of SDR38,482,000 ($60 million equivalent) from \nADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  (Asian  Development  Fund),  representing  75%  of  the  total \nproject cost. ADB will finance the costs of civil works, safeguard compliance, consulting services, \ntraining and capacity development, project operations and maintenance, and financial charges \nduring implementation. The  loan  will  have  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8 \nyears and an interest charge of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter. The Government will contribute the equivalent of $20 million as counterpart funds for \nland acquisition and resettlement, taxes and duties, part of civil works, and recurrent costs.

The implementation schedule of the Program is in Appendix 8. \n \n\n8. \n\nProcurement \n\n69. \nProcurement  of  all  goods  and  services  to  be  financed  under  the  Project  will  be \ncarried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from \ntime to time). All civil works contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of $1 million or more will \nbe  procured  through  international  competitive  bidding.  Civil  works  contracts  estimated  to  cost \nless  than  $1  million  will  be  procured  using  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB).  To  the  extent \npracticable,  goods  will  be  grouped  into  procurement  packages  larger  than  $500,000  to  be \nsuitable  for  international  competitive  bidding  procedures.  Goods  that  cannot  be  grouped  into \nlarger  contracts  and  are  estimated  to  cost  less  than  $500,000  per  contract  will  be  procured \nthrough NCB. A third-party, pre-shipment inspection provision will be adopted to ensure quality \nof  goods  and  equipment.  NCB  procedures  applicable  to  the  Project  are  specified  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s  Public  Procurement  Rules  2008 PF\nFP  and  the  procurement  plan  (Appendix  9). \nMiscellaneous  minor  goods  expected  to  cost  less  than  the  equivalent  of  $100,000  will  be \npurchased  using  shopping  procedures.  Any  necessary  modifications  or  clarifications  to  the \nGovernment\u2019s procedures will be recorded in the procurement plan. NCB packages valued \nat  more  than  $100,000  each  will  be  subject  to  prior  review  by  ADB.  The  UPEHU  will ensure \nthat  procurement  complies  with  the  applicable  procedures.  Specifically,  the  UPEHU  will  (i) \ndetermine  bid  packages  and  propose  procurement  methods,  as  approved  by  ADB;  (ii) \nprepare detailed material lists and specifications; and (iii) evaluate bids and award contracts. The \nUPEHU  will  annually  update  the  procurement  plan,  which  details  indicative  packages  to \nbe funded under the Project, and submit it to ADB for approval.  \n \n\n26\n\n9. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n70. \nConsultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  under  the  Project  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Supplementary \nAppendix O provides the outline terms of reference of the three international consultant firms to \nbe  hired.  An  international  consulting  firm  will  be  engaged  as  the  design  supervision  and \nconstruction  consultant  (52  person-months  of  international  and  308  person-months  of  national \nexperts) following ADB's quality- and cost-based selection procedures with a quality\u2013cost ratio \nof 80:20. The consultants will be based in the UPEHU (Dhaka) and the six city corporations, and \nwill assist the UPEHU and CCPIUs in managing the investment projects, preparing the detailed \n                                                 \n26\n\nP Once the Public Procurement Regulations 2008 in English are formally adopted. \n\nP\n\f \n\n19\n\ndesign,  supervising  the  works,  ensuring  the  technical  quality  of  design  and  construction, \nensuring social safeguard standards are met, and procurement including enabling private sector \nparticipation.  The  design  supervision  and  construction  consultant  will  include  specialists  in \nprocurement  and  resettlement  and  social  safeguards,  engineers  (waste  management,  foods \nsafety, electrical, mechanical, and structural), and architects. \n \n71. \nSimilarly, one international consulting firm will be engaged as financial management and \nmunicipal  finance  consultant  (15  person-months  of  international  and  178  person-months  of \nnational  experts)  following  ADB's  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  procedures.  The  financial \nmanagement and municipal finance consultant will assist the UPEHU and CCPIUs (i) improve \nthe financial management processes and systems of the project; (ii) conduct concurrent audits \nto  make  sure  that  financial  management  and  procurement  procedures  and  anticorruption \nmeasures are strictly adhered to; (iii) conduct analysis of municipal finance and provide support \non  the  implementation  of  the  policy  reforms  relating  to  municipal  finance  including  developing \nperformance-based grant mechanisms, assessing and monitoring progress on collection of tax \ndues,  and  assisting  in  expanding  the  scope  of  municipal  taxes;  (iv)  computerize  the  financial \nmanagement  systems  of  the  six  city  corporations  and  develop  web-based  applications  to \nenhance transparency in municipal finance functions; and (v) provide training for the staff of the \nUPEHU, CCPIU, and city corporations in modern financial management systems and computer \nskills relating to financial management. \n \n72. \nFor policy and miscellaneous capacity development support, one international consultant \nfirm will be engaged as program support consultant (12 person-months of international and 114 \nperson-months of national experts). The program support consultant will assist in program and \nproject monitoring and evaluation, policy reform support, pro-poor surveys, training and capacity \ndevelopment,  behavior  change  communication,  legal  support,  human  resource  development, \ngender mainstreaming, citizens' participation, and resettlement and rehabilitation, among other \nthings (see Supplementary Appendix O for the composition and outline terms of reference of the \nthree  consultant  firms).  In  addition,  the  UPEHU  will  hire  individual  national  consultants  (30 \nperson-months) on an as-needs basis. \n \n\n10. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\n73. \nTo expedite implementation, the Government requested advance actions for recruitment \nof  consultants  and  procurement  of  goods  and  civil  works.  Management  approved  advance \ncontracting, and retroactive financing of eligible expenditures of up to 20% of the project loan, \nprovided that expenditures were incurred (i) in accordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines, \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants,  and  safeguard  policies;  and  (ii)  during  the  12  months \npreceding  the  date  of  signing  of  the  loan  agreements.  The  Government  was  informed  that \napproval  of  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  did  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  the \nProject.  \n \n\n11. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n74.  Disbursements  of  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  An  imprest  account  will  be \nopened at the Bangladesh Bank in the name of the UPEHSDP. The account will be established, \nmanaged, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. The imprest \naccount  ceiling  will  be  10%  of  the  loan  or  the  forecast  expenditure  for  the  next  6  months, \nwhichever  is  lower.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditures  procedures  will  be  used  to  reimburse, \n\n \n\n\f 20 \n\nreplenish, and liquidate the imprest account for eligible expenditures not exceeding $100,000 \nper payment by the UPEHU (CCPIUs will submit full supporting documents to the UPEHU). \n\n75. \nFunds Flow. The advance from the imprest account will be deposited in a bank account \nto be maintained in a reputable commercial bank and used for ADB's portion of eligible costs of \nthe  Project.  The  Government  counterpart  contribution  will  be  deposited  in  a  separate  bank \naccount. The UPEHU will disburse most project expenditures from these accounts. In addition, \n6 second generation imprest accounts (operating accounts) for the ADB loan account only will \nbe opened, one in each CCPIU of the six city corporations, for disbursement of funds to pay for \nADB\u2019s  portion  of  the  eligible  project  costs.  Disbursement  will  be  delegated  to  the  CCPIUs  for \nADB\u2019s  share  of  civil  works  expenditures.  The  CCPIUs  will  effect  Government  counterpart \ndisbursements through a separate bank account (Supplementary Appendix P).  \n \n\n12. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n76. \nThe Government will maintain records and accounts to identify all goods and services \nfinanced by the loan proceeds. The UPEHU will be responsible for maintaining the records, and \nwill submit annual accounts and financial statements to the MOF and ADB. The Government will \nensure that accounts and financial statements are audited annually, in accordance with auditing \nstandards  acceptable  to  ADB,  by  independent  external  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  Not  later \nthan 6 months after the close of each fiscal year, the UPEHU will provide ADB with certified \ncopies of audited accounts and financial statements, as well as the report of the auditor. The \nimprest accounts and statement of expenditure records will be audited annually and a separate \naudit opinion will be provided. The UPEHU will prepare quarterly progress reports and submit \nthem to ADB and the LGD within 20 days of the end of the applicable period. The reports will \nbe  prepared  in  a  format  acceptable  to  ADB  and  will  include  (i)  project  progress  in  city \ncorporations  and  components,  (ii)  status  of  institutional  development  activities,  (iii)  delays  and \nproblems encountered and actions taken to resolve them, (iv) compliance with loan covenants, \nand (v) expected progress during the next 6 months. Within 3 months of the project\u2019s physical \ncompletion,  the  UPEHU  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  through  the  Government  a  project \ncompletion report, including costs and compliance with loan covenants. \n \n\n13. \n\nAnticorruption Policy and Governance Measures \n\n77. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  the  executing  agencies.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nSDP. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in \nthe loan regulations and the bidding documents for the SDP. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the SDP shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand examine the records and accounts of the executing agencies and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the SDP. \n\nThe  Project  incorporates  several  other  measures,  in  addition  to  the  standard  ADB \n78. \nrequirements,  to  deter  corruption  and  increase  transparency.  The  project  will  (i)  build  the \ncapacity of executing agencies to comply with ADB and Government procedures, to be outlined \nin  the  Project  Administration  Manual  during  the  early  stage  of  the  implementation;  (ii) \nestablish  a  project  website  to  disclose  information  about  project  implementation;  and  (iii) \nestablish a grievance redress mechanism to ensure greater accountability. The project website \nwill  provide  updated  detailed  information  on  project  implementation.  For  example,  the \n\n\f \n\n21\n\nwebsite  will  include  procurement-related information, such as the list of participating bidders, \nname  of  the  winning  bidder,  basic  details  on  bidding  procedures  adopted,  amount  of  contract \nawarded, and the list of goods and/or services procured. The grievance redress mechanism will be \nset  up  to  receive  and  resolve  complaints,  as  well  as  to  act  upon  stakeholders\u2019  reports  of \nirregularities  on  project-related  matters,  including  grievances  concerning  resettlement.  The \nexecuting  agency  will  widely  publicize  the  existence  of  this  mechanism  to  ensure  that \nstakeholders are aware that a venue is available to address concerns or grievances relating to \nfraud,  corruption,  abuse,  and  any  other  aspects  of  project  implementation.  In  addition,  the \nfinancial  management  and  municipal  finance  consultant  support  has  provision  for  continuous \nconcurrent audit to identify and stop deviations from set procedures.  \n \n\n14. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n79. \nThe  UPEHU  will  ensure  that  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation \nacceptable to ADB is carried out to (i) examine the project\u2019s technical performance, (ii) evaluate \nthe delivery of planned facilities, (iii) assess the achievement of the project objectives, and (iv) \nmeasure  the  Project\u2019s  social  and  economic  benefits.  The  UPEHU  and  program  support \nconsultant, in consultation with stakeholders and ADB, will develop a set of project performance \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  indicators  at  the  start  of  the  Program.  Indicators  might  include \nindicators  relating  to  status  of  solid  waste  management,  medical  waste,  and  food  safety;  the \nnumber of participants in awareness campaigns  and community participation; the incidence of \nwaterborne  diseases;  improvements  in  municipal  finance;  the  effectiveness  of  policy  reforms; \nand the impact on poor people and women, among other things. \n\nThe UPEHU will conduct baseline physical and socioeconomic surveys. It will submit \n80. \na  detailed  implementation  plan  for  monitoring  performance  and  for  preparing  benchmark \ninformation for ADB\u2019s review and concurrence within 1 year of loan effectiveness. The UPEHU \nwill  prepare  annual  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  reports,  which  will  be \nsubmitted to ADB throughout project implementation. Monitoring of implementation performance \nwill  integrate  physical  and  financial  aspects.  During  and  after  project  implementation,  the \nprogram support consultant will assist the UPEHU in measuring the beneficial impacts, and in \nassessing  whether  the  project  facilities  are  managed  efficiently  and  the  benefits  reach  the \ntargeted  groups.  Biannual  joint  review  of  the  UPEHSDP  will  be  held  by  the  Government  and \nADB. A comprehensive midterm review of the UPEHSDP will be held in 2013 before the release \nof the third tranche.  \n \n\n15. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n81. \nIndividual  investment  projects  will  also  be  under  the  review  of  the  Program  Inception \nMission  comprising  ADB  and  UPEHU  staff  who  will  be  fielded  shortly  after  the  project  loan \nbecomes  effective.  For  the  individual  investment  projects  it  will  also  be  relevant  for  the  yearly \nproject  review  missions  to  (i)  monitor  progress  of  project  implementation,  (ii)  identify  areas  of \nconcern,  and  (iii)  suggest  remedial  actions.  Similarly,  the  comprehensive  midterm  review  of \nprogram performance will be conducted to identify problems and constraints encountered during \nthe  first  half  of  the  program  and  project  components  and  to  adjust  the  design  and  the  project \nframework or take remedial actions as required. Technical or budgetary changes to the Program \nbased on the results of the program performance monitoring system will be considered, as will \nadditional activities, or expansion of activities and sites for the remaining program period. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f 22 \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  \n\n \n82. \nOne  of  the  most  significant  risks  of  the  UPEHSDP  is  that,  being  a  new  program,  the \ninitial set-up required for establishing the UPEHU followed by hiring of various consultant firms \nwould take a long time. This would not only delay the program implementation, but also has the \npotential  to  delay  the  Program  due  to  weak  procurement  and  financial  management  systems. \nThe UPEHSDP by nature has greater challenges than either a pure program or a pure project \nwould,  as  it  has  both  a  policy  reforms  component  (program)  and  an  investment  component \n(project). These two components require a diverse skills base. For the policy reform component, \nexpertise  in  policy,  law,  regulation,  and  municipal  finances  are  required;  the  investment \ncomponent  will  require  procurement,  financial  management  and  audit,  project  performance \nmonitoring, and information management skills. Both policy reform and investment components \nfood  and  water  safety,  and \nwill  require  specialists \nslaughterhouses.  The  capacity  development  technical  assistance  is  an  effort  to  mitigate  the \nstart-up delay risks, and enable the project to start on a sound foundation.  \n \nA. \n\nin  solid  waste,  medical  waste, \n\nObjectives and Purpose \n\n83. \nThe  objective  of  the  technical  assistance  is  to  (i)  help  overcome  the  start-up  delays \ninherent  in  a  new  program  by  providing  high-quality  consultant  support  to  undertake  critical \nadvance  activities  and  set  up  systems  and  procedures  in  the  newly  created  UPEHU  and \nCCPIUs;  and  (ii)  provide  advisory  capacity  development  assistance  to  the  Government  for \nUPEH at both the national and city corporation level. This will include assistance at the LGD and \nUPEHU  in  preparing  and  implementing  key  policy  reforms  (Appendix  10).  The  technical \nassistance  outcomes  will  be  to  provide  (i)  expert  procurement  support  to  help  the  LGD  and \nUPEHU in hiring the three consultant packages in a timely manner; (ii) expert institutional and \nfinancial management support to set up procedures and processes for smooth functioning of the \nUPEHU  and  CCPIUs,  especially  with  regard  to  anticorruption;  (iii)  expert  support  in  municipal \nfinancing, institutional development, financial management, solid and medical waste, CDM, food \nand water safety, PSP, pro-poor targeting, citizens participation, and gender mainstreaming for \npolicy  reform  support  (Supplementary  Appendix  O  has  detailed  terms  of  reference  of \nconsultants); (iv) engineering design support in waste management and food safety to support \nthe implementation of the investment component; and (v) limited support for training and local \nstudy tours.  \n \nB. \n \n84. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  capacity  development  technical  assistance  is  estimated  at \n$625,000  equivalent. The  Government has requested  ADB  to finance $500,000 equivalent, \ncovering all the foreign exchange costs and part of the local costs. ADB will finance $500,000 \nequivalent,  on  a  grant  basis,  from  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund-IV  funding \nprogram. The proposed Government in-kind contribution of $125,000 equivalent will cover office \ncosts, conference venues, and counterpart staff remuneration. \n \nC. \n \n85.  \nThe LGD will be the executing agency for the technical assistance (TA) and the UPEHU \nwill be the implementing agency. The program director of the UPEHSDP will be the TA project \ndirector,  and  the  NPSC  of  the  UPEHSDP  will  provide  overall  guidance  to  TA  implementation. \nThe  TA  is  expected  to  commence  as  soon  as  the  Project  is  approved  by  ADB\u2019s  Board  by  1 \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n\f \n\n23\n\nDecember 2009 and will be completed by 31 December 2011. Disbursements under the TA will \nbe made in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.PF\n \n\n27\n\nFP \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS  \n\nPoverty Reduction and Social Development \n\n \nA. \n \n86. \nThe  SDP  will  contribute  to  human  development  through  improvements  in  the  living \nconditions of residents in the project cities. This will be achieved through investments and policy \nreform to improve public and environmental health, citizen participation, and pro-poor targeting. \nThe Program component introduces specific pro-poor and gender-sensitive strategies, including \nthe issuance of entitlement cards coupled with free maternal and child health care services. The \nProject  component  will  improve  municipal  solid  waste  and  medical  waste  management,  and \nfood  safety  in  the  project  cities  benefiting  both  poor  and  non-poor.  Solid  waste  management \ninvestments  include  community-based  primary  collection  services  in  urban  poor  areas.  A \ncommunity participation plan (Supplementary Appendix Q) aims to enhance citizen involvement \nin project activities through service delivery alliance\u2014a multistakeholder group consisting of civil \nrepresentatives,  resource  organizations,  NGOs  and  community-based  organizations,  and \nprivate  sector  providers.  The  community  participation  plan  will  create  local  awareness \ncampaigns to educate and inform the poor on health and hygiene, and proactively include waste \npickers into project activities as part of the waste pickers' training program. A gender action plan \n(Supplementary  Appendix  L)  will  mainstream  gender  throughout  the  program  and  project \ninvestments and enhance participation and capacity of women in UPEH initiatives. The Project \ncomponent  supports  MDGs,  specifically  reducing  child  mortality  (MDG  4),  improving  maternal \nhealth  (MDG  5),  combating  malaria  and  other  diseases  (MDG  6),  and  ensuring environmental \nsustainability  (MDG  7).  The  Project  components  will  cover  six  city  populations  (estimated  at \nabout  one-third  of  the  total  population)  and  specifically  target  the  urban  poor.  The  summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 11.    \n\nB. \n \n\n \nSocial and Environmental Safeguards \n\n1. \n\nInvoluntary Resettlement \n\n \n87. \nThe  subprojects  are  expected  to  have  limited  involuntary  resettlement  impacts.  Since \nsubprojects  will  be  undertaken  in  several  locations,  and  the  resettlement  impacts  of  each \nsubproject  at  present  are  not  known,  a  resettlement  framework  with  a  detailed  entitlement \nmatrix has been formulated. It is based on ADB's Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995), and \nthe  Government's  Acquisition  and  Requisition  of  Immovable  Property  Ordinance  of  1982  (as \namended  in  1993  and  1994).  The  resettlement  framework  will  guide  the  LGD  in  formulating \nappropriate  resettlement  plans  for  subprojects  with  resettlement  impacts.  The  resettlement \nframework is in Supplementary Appendix R.PF\nFP The subprojects are designed to avoid, or at least \nminimize, land acquisition and other resettlement impacts. In this regard, city corporations will, \nto  the  extent  possible,  use  vacant  government  land  and  vacant  lands available  at  the  existing \nintegrated waste treatment, medical waste management, food laboratory, and training centers; \nslaughterhouses; and secondary transfer stations. Moreover, the city corporations will conduct \nextensive  consultations  with  affected  communities  to  obtain  their  broad  consent  for  selected \nsubproject  sites.  The  subproject  activities  will  be  planned  in  such  a  manner  that  they  will  not \naffect  houses  or  other  private  structures.  During  the  detailed  design  and  subproject \nimplementation phases, further actions will be taken by the LGD to reduce the requirement for \n                                                 \n27\n\nP ADB. 2008.

Of the sample subprojects, only the integrated \nwaste  management  treatment  facility  in  Khulna  has  resettlement  impacts.  The  resettlement \nimpacts  of  the  subproject  are  limited  to  24  affected  people  consisting of  informal settlers  (four \nhouseholds)  and  temporary  farm  laborers,  each  considered  to  be  vulnerable  due  to  their \nnontitled or poverty status. The short resettlement plan is in Supplementary Appendix S. PF\n \n\n29\n\nFP \n\n2. \n\nEnvironmental Safeguards \n\n \nSubprojects  are  designed  to  avoid,  minimize,  and/or  mitigate  adverse  environmental \n88. \nimpacts. Potential impacts are mostly localized and temporary, and related to dust, noise, and \naccess disruptions due to construction activities and construction-related waste disposal. These \nimpacts can largely be avoided through good engineering design and practices, or be reduced \nthrough  proper  mitigation  measures  and  environmental  management.  An  environmental \nassessment and review framework was developed to ensure compliance with national law and \nADB  policies,  guidelines,  and  requirements,  and  to  guide  the  implementation  of  future \nsubprojects (Supplementary Appendix T). Environmental subproject selection guidelines are to \nfurther  ensure  that  impacts  that  are  potentially  significant  and  permanent  are  identified  and \nprevented. Preparation of the environmental assessment reports was done with extensive public \nconsultation  in  each  of  the  sample  subproject  locations  and  included  primary  and  secondary \nstakeholders.  \n \n89. \nProgram and project investments in waste management and food safety are designed to \nimprove  environmental  quality,  living  conditions,  and  public  and  environmental  health  in  city \ncorporations. Environmental assessment of the policy matrix indicates that the program's policy \nreforms  are  directly  or  indirectly  aimed  at  promoting  environmentally  sound  development  by \ncontributing  to  improvements  in  waste  management  and  food  safety.  The  potential  impacts  of \neach policy are presented in the environmental assessment of the policy matrix (Supplementary \nAppendix  U).  Three  initial  environmental  examinations  and  two  environmental  reviews \n(Supplementary Appendix V) were conducted for sample subprojects and these show that net \nenvironmental  benefits  are  extensive.  These  include  (i)  reduced  solid  waste  pollution  and \ncleaner waterways due to investments in primary and secondary waste collection, (ii) reduced \ngreenhouse  gas  emissions  due  to  composting  and  potential  CDM  activities;  (iii)  reduced \nenvironmental  contamination  due  to  integrated  waste  treatment  facilities  investments;  (iv) \nreduced  environmental  risk  due  to  proper  disposal  of  hazardous  medical  waste;  and  (v) \nimproved  handling  and  disposal  of  environmentally  polluting  slaughterhouse  waste.  A  draft \nsummary environmental assessment is provided in Appendix 12. \n \nC. \n\nEconomic and Financial Analyses \n\n1. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n90. \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated for the project loan and some \ncost  implications  of  the  policy  actions.  The  overall  EIRR  is  18.2%,  which  exceeds  the \nopportunity cost of capital of 12% per year. The EIRRs were subjected to sensitivity analysis \non  the  basis  of  (i)  increase  in  investment  cost  by  20%,  (ii)  decrease  in  economic  benefits  by \n20%,  and  (iii)  delay  in  the  period  of  construction  and/or  implementation  causing  delay  in \nrevenue generation by 1 year. The findings of the sensitivity analysis indicate that the economic \nviability is still favorable despite adverse conditions, as the EIRR ranges from 13.6% to 16.8%. \nThe analyses indicate that changing the benefits has greater impact on the Project with regard \nto other variants. With a 20% decrease in the economic benefit, the sensitivity indicator is 2.23, \n                                                 \n29\n\nP A copy is posted at http://www.adb.org/Documents/Resettlement_Plans/BAN/39305/39305-02-BAN-RP.pdf \n\nP\n\f \n\n25\n\nwhich  indicates  that  an  assumed  change  of  20%  in  project  benefit  results  in  a  corresponding \n45% change in the economic benefits. Thus, economic benefits are relatively more sensitive to \nadverse  project  risks.  Sensitivity  analysis  indicates  that  the  EIRR  for  the  project  loan  is \nrobust  under  most  conditions.  The  detailed  economic  evaluation  and  sensitivity  analysis  are \navailable (Supplementary Appendix W). \n \n\n2. \n\nFinancial Management \n\nUsing  financial  management  assessment  questionnaires,  interviews  and  financial \n91. \nmanagement assessments were undertaken during the project preparatory TA to evaluate the \nexecuting  agency's  ability  to  undertake  and  fulfill  ADB\u2019s  fiduciary  requirements  for  the  project \ncomponents. The Executing Agency's financial management needs to be strengthened, and will be \nacceptable  with  financial  management  and  concurrent  audit  support.  Project  implementation \ndelays  will  be  minimized  through  extensive  support  from  project  management  and  design  and \nsupervision  consultants,  who  will  be  familiar  with  ADB  procedures  and  requirements \n(Supplementary Appendixes X and Y). \n \n\n3. \n\nFinancial Sustainability \n\n92. \nFinancial variability of the project loan was assessed in real terms using constant 2008 \nprices. The project cost estimates and financial projections in nominal terms were converted to \nreal  terms  by  adjusting  the  projected  effects  of  foreign  and  domestic  inflation  and  currency \nfluctuations. Incremental costs and benefits were derived by evaluating the financial position of \nthe  executing  agencies  under  with-project  and  without-project  scenarios.  The  financial  internal \nrate  of  return,  computed  on  an  after-tax  basis,  was  13.2%.  This  compares  favorably  with  the \nweighted average cost of capital, also computed on an after-tax basis, of 2.3% on an aggregate \nbasis. All parts of the project loan are considered financially viable and sustainable. Sensitivity \nand risk analysis indicates that the financial internal rate of return is sensitive to delays in each \nitem  of  the  implementation  of  financial  improvement  action  plan.  Detailed  financial  analysis  is \navailable (Supplementary Appendix Z). \n \nD. \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\n93. \nPublic and environmental health challenges, arising from rapid urbanization in a country \nwhere  urban  density  is  one  of  the  highest  in  the  world  and  where  urban  basic  services  need \nmuch improvement, are complex and daunting. The sheer scale of challenge and the resources \nthat are required to deal with them are immense. Political support might waver, as the outputs \nrelating to public and environmental health are less tangible than those related to building roads \nand drains. These risks will be addressed through participatory approach and behavior change \ncommunication interventions.  \n \n94. \nThe  purpose  of  greater  interministerial  coordination  by  the  LGD  is  to  access  the  core \nskills, knowledge, and professional staff of other line ministries so as to support and enable city \ncorporations to effectively implement their mandates relating to public and environmental health. \nThis is also to assist the LGD fulfill its role of providing national stewardship to city corporations \nand  pourashavas.  However,  the  interministerial  coordination  issues  are  always  very  sensitive \nand  lead  to  territorial  and  jurisdictional  tensions.  This  could  lead  to  unwanted  tensions  and \ndistraction  from  the  primary  purpose  of  these  coordination  committees,  i.e.,  to  improve  the \nquality of life of urban inhabitants. This risk will have to be proactively addressed by the LGD by \nensuring that (i) apprehensions of the line ministries are addressed, (ii) the ministry with a lead \n\n \n\n\f 26 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nrole  continues  to  provide  the  lead  on  the  issue,  and  (iii)  regular  interaction  and  coordination \noccurs, and no duplication takes place. \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government and the city corporations have \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nA. \n \n95. \ngiven the following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n96. \n \n\nFor the program: \n\nThe  Government  will  promptly  adopt  the  policies  and  take  the  actions  as \nspecified in the development policy letter and the policy matrix, and ensure that \nsuch  policies  and  actions  continue  in  effect  during  and  after  the  period  of  the \nprogram. \nThe  Government  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  policy  discussions  with  other \nmultilateral  and  bilateral  aid  agencies  that  may  have  implications  for  the \nimplementation  of  the  Program,  and  will  provide  ADB  with  an  opportunity  to \ncomment on any resulting policy proposals. \nThe Government will use local currency funds generated by the program loan to \nmeet the program expenditures and associated costs of reforms. \n\n \n97. \n \n\nFor the project: \n\nThe Government will make timely submission of annual budgetary appropriation \nrequests  and  ensure  prompt  disbursement  of  appropriated  funds  during  each \nyear of project implementation. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  all  of  its  ministries,  agencies,  and  divisions \ninvolved  in  the  implementation  of  the  project,  including  the  local  government \nauthorities,  give  their  full  cooperation  to  ensure  smooth  implementation  of  the \nproject,  including  but  not  limited  to  the  assignment  of  qualified  staff  and  the \nprovision of the necessary financial, technical, and other resources. \n\n(iii)  Within  9  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  UPEHU  will  create  a  website  to \ndisclose information about the UPEHSDP, including procurement information such \nas  list  of  participating  bidders,  name  of  the  winning  bidder,  basic  details  on \nbidding  procedures  adopted,  amount  of  contract  awarded,  and  the  list  of  goods \nand/or services procured. \n\n(iv)  Within 1 year of loan effectiveness, the UPEHU will establish a grievance redress \nmechanism,  acceptable  to  ADB,  and  appoint  a  nodal  officer  (deputy  program \ndirector, project implementation) at the UPEHU to receive and resolve complaints \nand  grievances  or  act  upon  reports  from  stakeholders  on  misuse  of  funds  and \nother irregularities, including grievances due to resettlement.

Bangladesh is urbanizing at a rapid pace. Since independence in \n1. \n1971,  the  urban  population  has  grown  at  an  average  annual  rate  of  6%  against  the  overall \nnational  growth  of  2.2%.  From  a  total  of  20.8  million  people  in  1991,  the  country\u2019s  urban \npopulation  increased  to  28.6  million  in  2001.PF\nFP  Further  projections  estimate  that  the  country\u2019s \n2\nurban  population  will  reach  116.2  million  (about  half  of  the  country\u2019s  population)  by  2040.PF\nFP \nApproximately  28.4%  of  the  total  population  living  in  urban  areas  is  poor.PF\nFP  By  2020,  it  is \nestimated that the poor will comprise 40%\u201360% of the urban population, most of those will live \n4\nin slum communities.PF\nFP The latest census identified 9,448 slums in the six cities, with the highest \nconcentration in Dhaka (54.9%), followed by Chittagong (20%), Sylhet (8.3%), Rajshahi (7.1%), \nKhulna  (5.7%),  and  Barisal  (3.9%).PF\nFP  These  demographic  changes  have  increased  the  public \nand environmental health challenges in urban areas.  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe summary of the problems in the form of problem tree analysis is given in Figure A2. \nA brief description of these problems is given below. High urban density in Bangladesh results \nin  unhealthy  living  conditions  for  the  poor,  who  live  in  crowded,  damp,  and  unsanitary \nenvironments. It is estimated that about one-fifth of the country's total burden of disease may be \nassociated  with  environmental  factors.  Two  of  the  top  three  causes  of  death  and  sickness, \nparticularly  among  poor  children,  are  respiratory  illnesses,  including  respiratory  tract  infection \nfrom  adverse \n(pneumonia)  and  bronchial  asthma,  and  diarrheal  diseases  all  arising \nenvironmental  conditions.  The  findings  of  the  qualitative  surveys  in  four  slums  of  Dhaka \nreinforce  the  findings  of  the  quantitative  surveys  regarding  public  and  environmental  health \nchallenges  among  the  urban  poor  (Supplementary  Appendix  AB).  Table  A2  shows  the \nestimated share of the top five causes of death, disease, and cancer as measured in disability \nadjusted life years.PF\n \n3. \nMillennium  Development  Goals  on  Health.  Bangladesh  has  made  impressive \nprogress  relating  to  Millennium  Development  Goals  on  health  but  there  are  inequalities  in  the \nhealth conditions between the urban rich and the urban poor (Supplementary Appendix A). The \ninfant  mortality  rate  in  urban  slum  areas  (63  per  1,000  live  births)  is  more  than  the  national \nestimate, and the under-5 mortality rate is much higher in urban slum areas (81 per 1000 live \nbirths)  than  in  urban  non-slum  areas  (31  per  1000  live  births).  The  nutritional  status  of  urban \npoor children is as bad as their rural counterparts (Supplementary Appendix AA). The Second \nUrban  Primary  Health  Care  Project  developed  an  effective  project-specific  methodology \ntargeting  the  urban  poor  for  delivering  primary  health  care  services.  This  practice,  although \nsuccessful, needs  to  be  expanded  to  ensure  that  poor  people  have  access to  the full  array  of \ngovernment programs. \n \n\n6\nFP  \n\n2\n\n                                                 \n1\nP   Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. 2001.

Bangladesh County Environmental Analysis. Bangladesh Development Series Paper 12. \nWashington, DC. \n \nC. \n \nCity corporations and pourashavas (towns other than city corporations) have major role \n4. \nto  play  in  strengthening  urban  public  and  environmental  health  service  delivery.  The  City \nCorporation  Ordinance  and  Pourashava  Ordinance  require  city  corporations  and  pourashavas \nto effectively deliver solid waste management, sanitation, infectious diseases control, and food \nand water safety services. There are currently no national rules or bylaws related to solid waste \nmanagement  and  bylaws  relating  to  food  safety  to  guide  local  bodies.  National  policies  are \ntherefore  needed  to  help  local  governments  meet  their  urban  public  and  environmental  health \nmandates.  \n  \nD. \n \n5. \nMunicipal solid waste management is not keeping pace with demand. Limited number of \n7\nhouseholds in urban areas in Bangladesh have access to a solid waste collection systemPF\nFP with \nmost slum households disposing of garbage in open spaces. With the exception of Dhaka, no \ncity  corporations  or  pourashavas  have  sanitary  landfill  services  (Supplementary  Appendix  E). \nWhile  house-to-house  collection  by  nongovernment  organizations  and  community-based \norganizations  is  widespread,  there  is  insufficient  public  or  private  investment  in  secondary \ncollection and disposal. Due to low tariffs, the sector as a whole does not attract private sector \ninvestments,  and  municipal  finances  are  insufficient  to  afford  sustainable  private  sector \nparticipation. The level of cost recovery through user charges is very low, and in particular there \nis  no  separate  tariff  schedule  for  institutional,  commercial,  and  industrial  wastes.  Moreover, \nthere  are  no  national  solid  waste  management  guidelines  to  assist  local  governments  to \novercome these challenges. Focus should be on establishing national policy, strategy, planning \nprocedures, and guidelines, followed by specific investments to support municipalities in planning, \npreparing,  and  implementing  municipal  solid  waste  improvements  in  line  with  the  established \nnational  priorities.  Without  national  and  local  initiatives  to  improve  municipal  solid  waste \nmanagement,  the  growing  and  uncontrolled  disposal  of  solid  waste  will  continue  to  create \nsevere public and environmental health challenges. Moreover, for the purposes of utilizing the \n\nMunicipal Solid Waste Management \n\n                                                 \n7\nP ADB. 2005. Bangladesh: Country Strategy and Program: 2006\u20132010. Manila, Philippines. \n\n \n\nP\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n36 \n\n \n\nMedical Waste Management \n\nclean  development  mechanisms,  the  option  of  landfill  gas  extraction  or  composting  will  be \nconsidered (Supplementary Appendix AF). \n \nE. \n \n6. \nAbout  36,000  tons  (t)  of  health  care  waste  is  generated  every  year  in  Bangladesh,  of \nwhich approximately 7,200 t is hazardous. Medical waste needs to be properly managed so that \nthe health and safety of the health care providers, waste handlers, and community is ensured. \nIn  most  of  Bangladesh,  traditional  and  outdated  systems  of  waste  management  in  health \nfacilities  are  used,  causing  ineffective  and  improper  waste  disposal  leading  to  pollution  of  the \nenvironment  and  health  hazards  to  the  people.  An  acceptable,  economical,  and  sustainable \nmedical waste management system is imperative to establish environmentally friendly hospitals. \nVarious  studies  document  the  poor  quality  of  medical  waste  management  in  government  and \nnongovernment  hospitals,  clinics,  and  diagnostic  laboratories.  There  is  no  proper  segregation \nand  collection  of  waste  in  the  health  care  facilities  as  well  as  a  shortage  of  equipment  and \nmaterials required for the disposal of medical wastes. The wastes are frequently dumped in the \ndustbins inside and/or outside hospital premises, or on the ground within the hospital premises, \nand then these become public waste.  \n \n7. \nMedical Waste Management Regulation. Recognizing the need to improve health care \nwaste  practices  through  national  legislation,  the  Government  adopted  the  Medical  Waste \n(Management  and  Processing)  Rules  under  the  Bangladesh  Environment  Conservation  Act, \n1995. These regulations define the role and responsibilities of the local government institutions \n(city corporations, municipalities, and union parishads (councils)) for the external transportation \nof general waste, treatment of hazardous waste, and provision of land for the proper and final \ndisposal  of  waste.  An  authorized  person  or  organization  will  be  responsible  for  untreated \nhazardous waste transportation and final disposal. The regulations establish a licensing regime \nunder  the  control  of  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  Family  Welfare,  and  when  implemented  will \nprovide  a  mechanism  through  which  operators  will  compete  with  clients  in  an  open  market  or \nunder  franchised  service  zones.    For  scaling  up  of  programs  in  medical  waste  management, \nthere  is  scope  in  both  the  City  Corporation  Ordinance  and  Pourashava  Ordinance  to \nimmediately  adopt  bylaws  to  undertake  any  mandate  to  implement  necessary  tasks.  As  such \nthere is the authority to either dispose of medical and solid waste or contract this work out to a \ncompetent private entity.  \n\nFood Safety \n\n \nF. \n \n8. \nFood contamination and adulteration with dangerous substances, colors, and chemicals \nare potential sources of unsafe food. There are limited sophisticated analytical laboratories with \nthe necessary equipment, chemicals, and well-trained analysts or technicians. Food laws, rules, \nand regulations in Bangladesh are not up to date. The Bangladesh National Plan of Action on \nNutritionPF\nFP  made  suggestions  on  food  quality  and  safety  issues,  such  as  updating  legislation, \ndesignation  of  a  competent  authority,  infrastructure,  and  laboratory  development  for  providing \nessential  services.  A  number  of  ministries,  departments,  and  agencies  are  involved  in  food \nsafety.  The  national  food  policy  of  the  Ministry  of  Food  and  Disaster  Management  offers  few \nstrategic  guidelines  to  ensure  safe  and  quality  foods.  Bangladesh  is  yet  to  develop  a  unified \nfood safety administration system or formulate a national food safety policy. \n \n\n8\n\n                                                 \n8\nP Government of Bangladesh. 1997.

Meat production and marketing is not \norganized  and  is  conducted  in  various  places  in  the  city  without  much  of  municipal  control, \nsupervision, or veterinary inspection of live animals or carcasses. All city corporations need to \norganize, supervise, and control the slaughtering of animals, the production of meat and meat \nproducts, and the utilization and processing of by-products.  \n \nG. \n \n10. \nInsufficient  resources  are  allocated  within  the  city  corporation  towards  public  and \nenvironmental  health.  Even  though  public  health  and  primary  health  care  are  priority  areas \nunder  the  Medium  Term  Budget  Framework  of  the  Local  Government  Division  (LGD)  of  the \nMinistry of Local Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives, the majority of funds are \nspent on infrastructure and maintenance of roads. Dedicated funds for public health and urban \nprimary health care need to be specific in the government orders that accompany funds release \nto  the  city  corporations.  However,  a  steady  and  growing  source  of  local  funding  is needed  for \nurban  local  bodies.  Municipal  financing  is  dominated  by  one  tax  source\u2014the  property  tax.  It \ncontributes  nearly  two-thirds  of  total  revenue  receipts,  however  it  is  not  fully  exploited.  Proper \nand regular assessment is not done, and most local governments are not properly equipped to \ndo  this.  The  betterment  tax,  higher  property  taxes,  urban  development  bond,  commercial \ndevelopment  projects,  attracting  private  capital,  and  untapped  resources  (e.g.,  introduction  of \nparking rentals), are some of the potential revenue sources available to municipalities.  \n \n11.  Municipal  financial  reforms,  including  a  set  of  standard  procedures  on  accepted \naccounting  standards,  are  needed  to  enhance  financial  management  aspects  in  an  integrated \nand  cohesive  manner.  Computerization  of  the  accounting  systems  would  be  of  benefit  in \nachieving  fiscal  discipline  by  virtue  of  its  implementation.  In  support  of  municipal  financial \nreforms,  some  functional  responsibilities,  such  as  solid  waste  management,  can  be  enhanced \nthrough private sector participation, and performance-based allocation should be considered to \navoid block grant allocations.  \n \n12. \nTariffs, Cost Recovery, and Sustainability. Cost recovery is a key issue for successful \nimplementation  of  the  Project.  An  effective  tariff  mechanism  is  needed  to  ensure  sufficient \ncontributions  from  beneficiaries  to  support  operation  and  maintenance  and  finance  overhead \ncosts  including  debt  servicing.  It  is  necessary  to  ensure  adequate  and  timely  provision  of \ncounterpart  funds  during  project  implementation.  Inadequate  tariff  levels  will  lead  to  lack  of \nfunds for capital investment and for operations and maintenance for built assets. Effectiveness \nand  sustainability  of  all  future  urban  wastewater  management  and  solid  waste  management \nfacilities depend upon tariff reforms and innovative financing mechanisms. The Government of \nBangladesh has recognized the importance of tariff reforms to raise funds for both construction \nand operation and maintenance of urban water supply, wastewater treatment, and solid waste \nmanagement.  As  suggested  in  the  National  Sanitation  Strategy  2005PF\nFP,  multiple  choices  of \ntechnologies are necessary, depending on local conditions and people\u2019s willingness to pay. The \ninstitutional, commercial, and industrial waste tariff analysis, however, showed very low levels of \ntariff  structures,  and  high  potential  for  improving  revenues  from  the  tariffs  (Supplementary \nAppendix AD).  \n \n \n\n9\n\n                                                 \n9\nP Government of Bangladesh. 2005. National Sanitation Strategy. Dhaka. \n\n \n\nP\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n38 \n\n \n\nInstitutional Strengthening \n\nH. \n \n13. \nSurveys indicate that a large number of positions\u2014including senior positions\u2014relating to \nhealth  and  conservancy  are  vacant  in  urban  local  bodies.  In  addition,  survey  results  reinforce \nthe  view  that  municipalities  do  not  dedicate  much  budget  to  critical  public  and  environmental \nhealth functions (Supplementary Appendix AE). UPEH requires a well-coordinated approach by \nseveral  departments  of  different  ministries,  the  private  sector,  nongovernment  organizations, \nand  others.  However,  an  effective  steward  to  promote  and  harness  the  coordination, \ncollaboration,  and  partnership  is  absent.  As  the  support  wing  of  the  ministry  for  all  local \ngovernment  institutions,  including  the  city  corporations  and  the  pourashavas,  the  LGD  is \nentrusted with a wide range of tasks including (i) development of local government; (ii) financing, \nregulation,  and  inspection  of  all  authorities  established  for  local  government;  (iii)  public  health \nengineering;  and  (iv)  rural  water  supply  and  water  and  sewerage  development.  The  LGD  has \nfew human resources to achieve all these tasks and has no permanent arrangement to provide \nstewardship for urban public and environmental health development. The institutionalization of \nan urban public and environmental health program is therefore essential.  \n \n14. \nDue  to  the complex  nature  of  urban  health  problems  there  is  also need  for  joint  action \nand consolidated efforts of different ministries, such as the Ministry of Local Government, Rural \nDevelopment  and  Cooperatives,  MOHFW,  the  Ministry  of  Environment  and  Forestry,  the \nMinistry of Industry, the Ministry of Food and Disaster Management, the Ministry of Commerce, \nand their departments that are responsible for taking action to support good health and regulate \nand  control  unhealthy  conditions.  Thus  the  main  issue  is  for  a  sustainable  urban  public  and \nenvironmental  health  initiative  within  the  LGD  to  make  an  institutional  arrangement  to  fill  the \nhuman  resource  and  financial  gap,  which  is  needed  to  create  a  sustainable  UPEH  system  in \nBangladesh. \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n \n\n39\n\nDEVELOPMENT COORDINATION MATRIX \n\n \n1. \nThe  external  assistance  to  urban  public  and  environmental  health  and  urban  primary \nhealth  care  is  summarized  in  the  table  below.

This  would  not  only  delay  the  program \nimplementation,  but  has  the  potential  to  derail  the  Program  due  to  weak  procurement  and \nfinancial management systems. The UPEHSDP by nature has greater challenges than either a \npure  program  or  a  pure  project,  as  it  has  both  a  policy  reforms  component  (program)  and  an \ninvestment  component  (project).  These  two  components  require  a  diverse  skills  base.  For  the \npolicy  reforms  component,  expertise  in  policy,  law,  regulation,  and  municipal  finances  are \nrequired;  the  investment  component  requires  procurement,  financial  management  and  audit, \nproject  performance  monitoring,  and  information  management  skills.  Both  policy  reforms  and \ninvestment  components  will  require  specialists  in  solid  waste,  medical  waste,  food  and  water \nsafety, and slaughterhouses. The technical assistance (TA) is an effort to mitigate the start-up \ndelay risks, enable the project to start on a sound foundation, and strengthen the capacities of \nthe Local Government Division (LGD) of the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development \nand Cooperatives to implement the reform program.  \n \nB. \n \nThe objectives of the TA are to (i) help in overcoming the start-up delays inherent in a \n2. \nnew program by providing high-quality consultant support to undertake critical advance activities \nand set up systems and procedures in the newly created UPEHU and city corporation program \nimplementation units; and (ii) provide advisory capacity building assistance to the Government \nfor urban public and environmental health, both at the national and city corporation level. This \nwill  include assistance  for  the  LGD  and  the  UPEHU  in  preparing  and  implementing  key  policy \nreforms.  \n \nThe TA outcome will be to provide (i) expert procurement support to help the LGD and \n3. \nUPEHU in hiring the three consultant packages in a timely manner; (ii) expert institutional and \nfinancial management support to set up procedures and processes for smooth functioning of the \nUPEHU  and  city  corporation  program  implementation  units,  especially  with  regard  to \nanticorruption;  (iii)  expert  support  in  municipal  financing,  institutional  development,  financial \nmanagement,  solid  and  medical  waste,  food  and  water  safety,  private  sector  participation \n(public\u2013private  partnership),  pro-poor \ntargeting,  citizens  participation,  and  gender \nmainstreaming for policy reform support; (iv) engineering design support in waste management \nand  food  safety  to  support  the  implementation  of  the  investment  component;  and  (v)  limited \nsupport for training and local study tours.  \n \nC. \n \n4. \nThe  LGD  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  TA  and  the  UPEHU  will  be  the \nimplementing agency. The project director of the UPEHSDP will also be the project director of \nthe TA. The national program steering committee of the UPEHSDP will provide overall guidance \nto  the  TA's  implementation.  The  TA  is  expected  to  commence  as  soon  as  the  Project  is \napproved by the Board of Directors of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and to be completed \nin  2  years.  Consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  under  the  Project  in  accordance  with \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  All  the \nconsultants will be hired on an individual basis, directly or through an organization.  \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Arrangements \n\n \n\n5. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $625,000  equivalent.  The  Government  has \nrequested ADB to finance $500,000 equivalent, covering all the foreign exchange costs and \npart  of  the  local  costs.  ADB  will  finance  $500,000  equivalent,  on  a  grant  basis,  from  ADB\u2019s \nTechnical  Assistance  Special  Fund-IV  funding  program.  The  proposed  Government  in-kind \ncontribution of $125,000 equivalent will cover office costs, conference venues, and counterpart \nstaff  remuneration.

Poverty Analysis                                             Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention-MDGs \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nThe  sector  development  program  supports  Bangladesh\u2019s  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  Paper  II  (PRSP  2009\u2013\n2011)  which  identifies  five  strategies  for  poverty  reduction  (including  ensuring  human  development),  and  five \nsupporting  strategies  (including  providing  service  delivery  efficiently  and  effectively  to  the  poor,  and  tackling \nenvironmental  issues  for  sustainable  development).  While  poverty  incidence  in  Bangladesh  is  decreasing  in \nabsolute terms, the number of urban poor grows with the rapidly increasing population. Of the urban population, \n45%  live  in  poverty  with  25%  classified  as  extremely  poor  (consumption  less  than  1,805  kilocalories  per  day). \nThe majority of the urban poor live in slums. Slum dwellers face poverty due to their low level of earnings and \nthe fact that the majority live below the poverty line in terms of both calorie intake and cost of basic needs. They \nare mostly involved in low-paid jobs in the informal sectors. Poor urban infrastructure in slums exposes the slum \npopulation to public and environmental health hazards. \n \nThrough  support  to  pro-poor  and  gender-inclusive  public  and  environmental  health  sector  in  public  and \nenvironmental health in general, and a focus on the poor through integrated waste management for the urban \npoor  and  policy  and  institutional  reforms,  the  sector  development  program  will  support  the  Government  of \nBangladesh  in  achieving  relevant  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs).  The  project  loan  will  cover  city \npopulations (estimated at about one-third of the total population) and specifically target poor and disadvantaged \nwomen in terms of integrated solid waste management.  \n \n2. Design Features  \n \nThe project component will contribute to achieving MDGs: \n \n(i) MDGs  4  and  5:  Reduction  of  Child  Mortality  and  Improving  Maternal  Health. In addition to  public and \nenvironmental  health  benefits  from  which  poor  women  and  children  will  benefit  more  due  to  their  greater \nvulnerability, the Program's policy reform of improving pro-poor and gender-responsive targeting will contribute \nto expand maternal health care for the very poor and the poor in all of the six city corporations.  \n \n(ii) MDG  6:  Combating  Malaria  and  Other  Diseases. Unmanaged nonbiodegradable wastes serve as actual \nbreeding  grounds  for  mosquitoes.  In  addition,  unmanaged  solid  waste  is  often  washed  by  rain,  blown  by  the \nwind, or deliberately placed in drainage channels, creating stagnant pools which also serve as breeding grounds \nfor  mosquitoes.  The  Project's  investments  in  solid  waste  management  will  thus  contribute  to  reducing  the \nincidence of malaria. \n \n(iii)  MDG7:  Ensuring  Environmental  Sustainability.  Investments  in  solid  waste  management\u2014including \nintegrated  waste management for the urban poor, medical  waste management, food laboratories, and modern \nslaughterhouses\u2014will  lead  to  environmental  improvements  in  urban  areas  that  reduce  the  vulnerability  of  the \npoor  to  pollution  and  diseases  related  to  inadequate  urban  infrastructure  and  services.  Specific  environmental \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nbenefits  include  (i)  reduced  solid  waste  pollution  and  cleaner  waterways  due  to  investments  in  primary  and \nsecondary  waste  collection,  (ii)  reduced  greenhouse  gas  emissions  due  to  composting  and  potential  clean \ndevelopment mechanism activities, (iii) reduced environmental contamination due to integrated waste treatment \ninvestments,  (iv)  reduced  environmental  risk  due  to  proper  disposal  of  hazardous  medical  waste,  and  (v) \nimproved disposal of environmentally polluting slaughterhouse waste. \n \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending \n \nThe  program  loan  will  support  the  implementation  of  pro-poor  and  gender-responsive  policy  reforms  to  (i) \nstrengthen institutional arrangements, (ii) improve financial sustainability, (iii) improve public and environmental \nhealth  service  delivery,  and  (iv)  strengthen  pro-poor  and  gender-responsive  targeting  through  citizens' \nparticipation and the role of the private sector. These will have positive impacts on the country\u2019s population as \nthe policy reforms will improve public and environmental health conditions, with the poor benefiting more as they \ntypically  suffer  more  from  unsanitary  waste  and  food  management  practices.  One  of  the  policy  reform  areas \ndirectly  targets  the  poor  as  the  focus  for  urban  public  and  environmental  health  programs.  The  Local \nGovernment  Division  (LGD)  will  establish  a  technical  working  group  to  develop  procedures  and  guidelines  for \nlocal bodies to identify the poor in their locality and for pro-poor targeting. This is expected to result in actions in \neach city corporation to identify the poor. The LGD will provide guidelines to the local bodies for the issuance of \nentitlement cards to the poor and to the identification of programs and services which can be accessed with the \ncard.  \n \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nWhile it is documented that Bangladesh has made progress in achieving MDG goals, in the urban areas, there \ncontinues to be public and environmental health hazards, particularly for the urban poor and among the urban \npoor and disadvantaged women. This was confirmed in the findings of the poverty and social/gender analyses \ncarried  out by  the Asian Development Bank (ADB) during the preparation of the  sector development program. \nOnly  60%  of  respondents  had  access  to  sanitary  latrines  while  the  rest  use  unhygienic  hanging  latrines.  One \nlatrine is typically shared by a large number of households (ranging from 8 to 66). Illegal settlements, the inability \nto  afford  sewage  connection,  and  the  lack  of  other  options  commensurate  with  their  ability  to  pay  are  critical \nimpediments to the access of poor and disadvantaged women to sanitation. Access to water is also limited; one \nsource of water is usually shared between 76 and 110 households. Moreover, the distance of water sources and \nlatrines serve as additional barriers for accessing these services.  \n \nSolid waste is mostly thrown into waterways (through gaps in the macha [raised platforms] of wooden houses) or \nnearby open spaces. Utilization of fixed locations and/or transfer stations for garbage disposal in urban slums is \nonly 25%. Exposure to improperly disposed of waste worsens the living conditions and health status of the urban \npoor. \n \nWhile food safety is not seen as a priority among the poor, slum dwellers frequently consume unsafe food from \nstreet vendors and suffer from food-related diseases. In addition to unsafe food, malnutrition and food insecurity \nare  crucial  issues  in  urban  poverty.  The  unsanitary  practice  of  open  slaughtering  of  animals  creates  an \nunhygienic environment with the poor often involved in, and exposed to, these conditions. \n \nAccess  of  the  urban  poor  to  primary  health  care  services  is  limited.  Analysis  shows  that,  as  the  first  point  of \ncontact,  they  prefer  chemist  shops  and/or  dispensaries  and  traditional  healers,  mainly  due  to  affordability  and \navailability.  Women  and  children  are  the  most  vulnerable  among  the  urban  poor.  The  analysis  shows  that,  in \nselected slums, the institutional childbirth delivery rate was only 17% against the rate of antenatal care at 55 %. \nCost was the main factor for not opting for institutional delivery. The majority of respondents (83%) indicated that \nthey had their last child delivery at home because it was cheaper.  \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n \n\n61\n\n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nExtensive consultations were conducted during sector development program preparation. Four workshops were held in \nDhaka (July and August 2008) to discuss the proposed program\u2019s objectives, components, and projected impacts, and \nobtain stakeholders opinions. The workshops were attended by 115 participants including community male and female \nrepresentatives,  community-based  organizations  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  local  government \nofficials, line agency representatives, and other stakeholders. Five other similar workshops were conducted in Bogra, \nComilla,  Khulna,  Satkhira,  and  Tongi.  Further  consultations  at  subproject  sites  included  meetings  with  local \ngovernment officials, NGOs, and surrounding communities.  \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n Consultation      Collaborative decision making     \n\n  Information sharing      \n\n Empowerment \n\nc\n\n No  \n\n Yes    \n\n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \nIf a C&P plan  was prepared,  describe key features  and resources  provided to implement the plan (including  budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \n \nA  major  feature  of  the  capacity  development  subcomponent  of  the  sector  development  program  is  enabling  the \nmunicipal  bodies  to  take  a  more  participatory  approach  to  urban  development.  The  consultation  and  participation \nstrategy is embodied in the community participation plan which complements policy actions (Policy Action 4.2: Enable \ncitizen participation in delivery of urban public and environmental health [UPEH]). It centers on the formation of two \ncommunity-based programs: (i) formation of service delivery  alliances at the facility  and ward level (the alliances are \nmultistakeholder  groups  consisting  of  civil  society  representatives,  resource  organizations,  NGOs,  community-based \norganizations,  and  private  sector  providers);  and  (ii)  the  Waste  Picker  Livelihood  Training  Program.  Service  delivery \nalliances will facilitate dissemination of accurate information regarding urban services issues, assist the city corporation \nin  preparing  community-based  programs  and  partnering  with  NGOs,  and  promote  community  mobilization  and \nP  This  will  be  further  enhanced  by  educational  campaigns  to  encourage  the  3Rs  (reduce,  reuse,  and \nawareness.P\nrecycle)  and  source  segregation  of  waste.  Implementation  support  for  the  community  participation  plan  includes  the \nprovision  of  a  community  participation  and  gender  action  plan  specialist  within  the  Urban  Public  and  Environmental \nHealth Unit (UPEHU).  \nC.   Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues.  \nDespite  recent  gains  in  the  role  of  women  in  economic  and  social  development  in  Bangladesh,  women  still  remain \nparticularly vulnerable to poverty. In relation to solid waste, it is women who are mostly responsible for managing waste \nat  the  household  level,  and  who  are  mostly  engaged  in  informal  waste  picking  and  recycling  activities  for  livelihood \ndependence. Few women are involved in key decision-making efforts at the local, city corporation, and national levels, \nparticularly related to issues of public and environmental health. Participation of  women in stable, skilled jobs is also \nlow. Opportunities exist to equip women with proper training and equipment, to become absorbed into the formal waste \ncollection process, as  well as other  sectors in food safety  and hospital  waste management. This  would ensure more \nstable employment as well as safer and healthier work conditions. More efforts are also needed to improve the role of \nwomen in local project planning and decision making. \n \n2.  Key Actions. Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access to \nand use of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n \n\n Gender plan       \n\n  Other actions/measures      \n\n  No action/measure \n\n \nSummarize  key  design  features  of  the  gender  plan  or  other  gender-related  actions/measures,  including  performance \ntargets, monitorable indicators, resource allocation, and implementation arrangements. \n \n \nTo  promote  the  effective  incorporation  of  pro-poor  and  gender-inclusive  design  features,  the  sector  development \nprogram  and  the  related  project  will  adopt  a  set  of  activities\u2014defined  in  the  project-specific  gender  action  plan,  as \nfollows: \n(i) \n(ii) \n\nensuring the recruitment of a poverty and gender specialist at the UPEHU;

Poverty  and  discrimination  of  this  kind  undercut  the \nability of disadvantaged groups to access basic social services (including public and environmental health services). \n\nP   Project costs cover training programs for local government officials, information, education and communication campaigns, and \ninvolving  media.  Logistical  support  is  to  be  provided  by  the  city  corporations.  The  waste  picker's  training  program  will  provide \ntraining and income-generation opportunities for  waste pickers impacted by project investments, particularly  at  waste collection \nsites and waste treatment facilities. The goal is to involve waste pickers in program activities and to provide needed skills training \nand  job  placement  services.  Costs  include  surveys,  training,  and  daily  allowance  to  compensate  waste  pickers  during  training \nactivities. \n\nd\nP   At  a  minimum,  the  training  program  for  target  groups  (i),  (ii),  and  (iii)  should  include  a  combination  of  the  following  modules:  (a) \nsocial/gender analysis in urban settings, (b) consultation and participation mechanisms, (c) implementation of pro-poor and gender \naction  plan  design  features  (through  the  gender  action  plan),  and  (d)  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  poverty  reduction  and  gender \nequality results of the sector development program.

The  Program  will  consist  of  two  investment  types\u2014a  program  loan \nand  a  project  loan\u2014and  will  include  interventions  at  the  policy  level  and  focus  on  targeted \ninvestments  in  six  city  corporations.  The  program  loan  includes  a  policy  matrix  with  four  key \npolicy  proposals.  It  aims  to  (i)  strengthen  institutional  arrangements,  (ii)  improve  financial \nsustainability,  (iii)  improve  urban  public  and  environmental  health  service  delivery,  and  (iv) \nstrengthen  citizen  participation  and  private  sector  role  and  pro-poor  targeting.  Environmental \nassessment  of  the  policy  matrix  indicates  that  these  policies  are  directly  or  indirectly  aimed  at \npromoting  environmentally  sound  development  by  contributing  to  improvements  in  waste \nmanagement and food safety; conversely, the status quo of negative environmental and social \nimpacts would continue to occur if the policies fail. The main potential impacts of each policy are \nsummarized in the full environmental assessment of the policy matrix (Supplementary Appendix \nU).  \n \n2. \nThe  project  loan  will  target  investments  in  two  areas:  waste  management  and  food \nsafety.  Subprojects  aim  to  improve  environmental  quality,  public  health,  and  overall  living \nconditions  in  city  corporations.  Five  environmental  assessments  were  conducted.  Three  of \nthese  were  initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)\u2014Khulna  Solid  Waste  Management, \nChittagong  Hospital  Waste  Management,  and  Dhaka  Slaughter  House\u2014and  two  were \nenvironmental reviews\u2014Chittagong Food Testing Laboratory and Dhaka Solid Waste Transfer \nStations.  IEEs  were  based  on  feasibility  studies,  field  visits,  secondary  data,  and  extensive \ndiscussions with stakeholders.  \n \nB. \n \n3. \nEnvironmental  assessments  conducted  for  waste  management  and  food  safety \nsubprojects under the UPEHSDP show that net environmental benefits are positive and large, \nand  include  (i)  reduced  solid  waste  pollution  and  cleaner  waterways  due  to  investments  in \nprimary  and  secondary  waste  collection,  (ii)  reduced  greenhouse  gas  emissions  due  to \ncomposting and  potential  clean  development  mechanism  activities,  (iii)  reduced  environmental \ncontamination due to sanitary landfill investments, (iv) reduced environmental risk due to proper \ndisposal  of  hazardous  medical  waste,  and  (v)  improved  disposal  of  environmentally  polluting \nslaughterhouse waste.  \n \n4. \nAll identified adverse impacts can be mitigated and include properly locating, planning, \nand designing proposed subprojects; controlling construction activity; and properly maintaining \nsystems  following  commissioning.  Impacts  that  are  potentially  significant  and  permanent  are \nidentified,  and  environmental  subproject  selection  guidelines,  part  of  the  environmental \nassessment and review framework (Supplementary Appendix T), will not allow subprojects with \nsuch  impacts.  The  potential  for  adverse  environmental  impacts  are  primarily  associated  with \nunrealized benefits, which may occur due to failures in implementing subprojects in accordance \nwith  good  engineering  practice  and  sustained  operation  and  maintenance  procedures.

The \n6. \nLocal Government Division (LGD) of the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and \nCooperatives  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  UPEHSDP  providing  overall  guidance  for \nprogram implementation. The LGD will have the overall responsibility to plan, organize, manage, \nsupervise,  coordinate,  and  monitor  the  progress  achieved.  The  LGD  will  establish  a  support \nunit  called  the  environmental  health  unit  (UPEHU)  that  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day \nprogram  implementation  and  will  be  headed  by  a  full-time  program  director.  A  safeguards \nofficer to coordinate resettlement and environmental safeguards for the UPEHSDP will be part \nof the policy and program wing of the UPEHU. Through the safeguards officer, the UPEHU will \nensure environmental compliance with Asian Development Bank (ADB) policy and national law \nacross the entire program. This includes (i) pre-approving final IEEs prior to submission to ADB \nfor review and approval, and (ii) assisting in resolution of complaints and grievances related to \nIEE implementation not resolved in the city corporation program implementation units (CCPIUs). \n\n \n7. \nCity  Corporations  Program  Implementation  Units.  Program  implementation  units \nwill  be  established  in  each  city  corporation.  The  CCPIUs  will  include  a  safeguards  and \ncommunity  mobilization  officer  who  will  receive  training  from  the  international  environment \nspecialist  and  national  environment  specialist,  and  will  be  assigned  to  work  with  the  CCPIU \nstaff to help monitor subprojects and to transfer implementation capability to the CCPIU team. \nThe  community  mobilization  officer  will  work  closely  with  the  environment  specialists  in \nplanning,  implementing,  and  monitoring  all  project  activities.  The  CCPIUs  will  (i)  screen  and \ncategorize subprojects, (ii)  assist  in  public  meetings  and  other  consultation  with  stakeholders, \nand  (iii)  facilitate  activities  of  the  environment  specialists  in  applying  for  location  and \nenvironmental clearances.  \n \n8. \nEnvironmental Specialists. A design, supervision, and construction consultant (DSCC) \nteam will be contracted to assist the UPEHU and CCPIUs in implementing and managing the \ninvestment  subprojects  including  environmental  planning.  Towards  this,  international  and \nnational  environment  specialists  within  the  DSCC  team  will  prepare  IEEs  in  accordance  with \nboth  ADB  and  Government  policies  during  the  feasibility  and  detailed  design  stage,  and \nsupervise  contractors,  with  support  from  CCPIUs,  during  the  construction  process.  The \nenvironment  specialists  will  work  in  close  coordination  with  UPEHU  and  CCPIUs.  They  will \ncoordinate with the safeguards officer in the UPEHU to ensure all IEEs comply with ADB and \nGovernment of Bangladesh rules and guidelines. The environment specialists will also provide \ntraining  to  CCPIUs  to  facilitate  their  monitoring  of  environmental  impacts  during  construction \nand  operation  and  will  provide  support  ensuring  that  all  tasks  of  the  CCPIU  with  regard  to \nenvironmental implementation and monitoring are achieved. \n \n9. \nGrievance  Redress  Committees.  Public  grievances  regarding  technical,  social,  and \nenvironmental aspects will be brought to the grievance redress committee constituted for each \ncity  corporation.  The  committee  will  comprise  representatives  from  the  office  of  the  program \nimplementation unit and the office of the city corporation chief executive officer, affected people, \na  female  elected  member  of  the  city  corporation  and  the  safeguards  and  community \nmobilization  officer.  The  grievance  redress  process  is  designed  to  be  transparent,  gender \nresponsive, culturally appropriate, and commensurate to the risks and adverse impacts of the \nproject, as well as readily accessible to all segments of the affected people. Affected people are \nto  be  appropriately  informed  about  the  mechanism  through  media  and  public  outlets.  This \n\n \n\n\f70 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nparticipatory  process  shall  ensure  that  all  views  of  the  people  are  adequately  reviewed  and \nsuitably  incorporated  in  the  design  and  implementation  process.  The  grievance  redress \ncommittee will meet every month and will determine the merit of each grievance and resolve all \ngrievances within 15 days of receiving the complaint. The grievance redress procedure includes \nan  appeals  procedure  for  the  affected  person  who  can,  if  not  satisfied  with  the  committee \ndecision, attend the next case and present any additional information for reconsideration of the \ncase. Grievances not redressed by the grievance redress committee to the satisfaction of the \naffected  person  will  be  considered  by  the  program  steering  committee  or  the  Office  of  the \nDistrict  Commissioner  (for  grievances  related  to  land  acquisition).  Any  remaining  grievances \nmay be referred by affected people to the appropriate courts of law. Records will be kept of all \ngrievances received, including contact details of complainant, date the complaint was received, \nnature  and  details  of  grievance,  agreed  corrective  actions  and  date  these  were  effected,  and \nthe final outcome.  \n \n10. \nAsian  Development  Bank.  The responsibilities of ADB in the review and clearance of \nenvironmental  assessment  reports  include  (i)  review  the  changes  and  the  suggested \nclassification, if required; (ii) revise environmental assessment report based on detailed design \nchanges,  as  warranted;  (iii)  reserving  the  right  to  review  the  project  document  and \nenvironmental assessment reports, as necessary; (iv) review subprojects confirmed by ADB as \nenvironmentally sensitive (the proposal and the IEE or environmental impact assessment of the \nsubproject  must  be  forwarded  by  EA  to  ADB  for  review);  and  (v)  ensure  that  all  safeguards \ndocuments are endorsed by the executing agency.  \n \n\nEnvironmental Monitoring and Reporting \n\n2. \n \n\n11.  Monitoring  during  construction  will  be  assisted  by  the  CCPIU,  whose  staff  will  receive \ntraining  on  environmental  monitoring  of  construction  from  the  national  environment  specialist. \nThe  CCPIU  will  report  the  results  and  conclusions  to  the  UPEHU  every  quarter,  or  more \nfrequently if remedial action is required. Mitigation required when the system is operating will be \nthe responsibility of the city corporation monitored by the UPEHU. \n \n\nPublic Consultation and Information Disclosure  \n\n3. \n \n12. \nThe  Project  takes  a  participatory  approach  and  engages  both  primary  and  secondary \nstakeholders.  Public  consultation  was  used  extensively  during  preparation  of  the  IEEs.  This \nincluded  public  meetings,  workshops  to  which  multiple  stakeholders  were  invited,  and  ad  hoc \ninterviews  at  sites.  The  consultant  team  conducted  these  public  consultations  in  Chittagong, \nDhaka,  and  Khulna  to  receive  local  input  on  the  solid  waste  components,  the  hospital  waste \nfacility, food testing laboratory, and slaughterhouse. Attendees were informed about the aim of \nthe relevant subprojects and the benefits they would bring, together with their likely impacts and \nthe ways in which they would be mitigated. Participants were invited to discuss their views and \nconcerns,  which  were  then  incorporated  into  the  IEEs.  Ad  hoc  discussions  were  also  held  on \nsite with people and communities who could be affected by the subprojects, so that views could \nbe expressed in a less formal setting. CCPIUs will disclose the IEEs to the public by providing \ncopies in the local language in the city corporation office in each town. Environmental concerns \nof  the  affected  people  raised  during  public  consultations  are  summarized  in  the  individual \nenvironmental reports; however, common concerns were primarily related to resettlement and \ncompensation issues (which are addressed in separate resettlement plans or mitigated through \ndesign), concerns about how the projects will improve the current waste situation (subprojects \nwere  explained  during  consultations  with \nthe  summary \nenvironmental  examinations  and  project  descriptions  distributed  and  made  available  at \n\nlanguage  versions  of \n\nlocal \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n       \n71\n\nthe  requirements  under \n\nmunicipal  offices),  and  questions  regarding  the  roles  of  government  and  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) (which were explained during consultations and clarified in the IEEs). In \naccordance  with \nthe  environment  policy  and  ADB\u2019s  Public \nCommunications Policy (2005), ADB shall make the initial environmental examination available \nto interested parties on request. \n \n13. \nFuture  consultation  during  detailed  design  will  include  (i)  focus-group  discussions  with \naffected  persons  and  other  stakeholders  (including  women\u2019s  groups,  NGOs,  and  community-\nbased  organizations)  to  hear  their  views  and  concerns,  so  that  these  can  be  addressed  in \nproject design where necessary; and (ii) structured consultation meetings with the institutional \nstakeholders  (government  bodies  and  NGOs)  to  discuss  and  approve  key  aspects  of  the \nProject. Consultation during construction will include (i) public meetings with major stakeholders \nto  discuss  and  plan  work  programs  and  allow  issues  to  be  raised  and  addressed  once \nconstruction has started; and (ii) smaller-scale meetings to discuss and plan construction work \nwith primary stakeholders to reduce disturbance and other impacts, and provide a mechanism \nthrough  which  affected  people  can  participate  in  project  monitoring  and  evaluation.  Project \ndisclosure will include public information campaigns (via newspaper, TV, and radio) to explain \nthe project to the urban populations and prepare them for any disruption they may experience \nonce the construction program is under way. Also, public disclosure meetings at key stages to \ninform the public of progress and future plans will occur, and copies of summary documents in \nthe  Bangla  language  will  be  provided.  Formal  disclosure  of  completed  project  reports  will  be \nmade  available  at  convenient  locations  in  each  target  town,  informing  the  public  of  their \navailability, and providing a mechanism through which comments can be made. \n \n \n \n14. \nTo  ensure  compliance  with  Government  and  ADB  policies,  environmental  subproject \nselection criteria were prepared to guide the implementation of future subprojects. A summary \nof  the  environmental  subproject  selection  criteria  is  provided  in  Table  A12.2.  The  full \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  framework,  based  on  provisions  of  the  Government\u2019s \nenvironmental  policies  and  the  environmental  assessment  criteria  of  ADB,  is  provided  in \nSupplementary Appendix V. The environment assessment and review procedure also details (i) \nthe  Government\u2019s  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedures,  (ii)  responsibilities  and \nauthorities involved in environmental assessment and review, and (iii) staffing requirements and \nbudgets. \n \n\nEnvironmental Selection Criteria for Subprojects \n\n4. \n\nTable A12.2: Environmental Criteria for the Selection and Development of Subprojects \n\nEnvironmental Selection Criteria \n\n1.
