Category of subprojects financed through the financial \nintermediary will be limited to B or C.  \n \nTo  help  achieve  health-related  MDGs  of  the  Philippines,  the  Project \nwill  address  low  and  inefficient  public  expenditures  in  health  care  by \nmobilizing additional off-budget credit for pro-poor investment through \na  government  financial  intermediary,  leveraging  private  participation, \nand improving allocation toward investment priorities. These priorities \ninclude  (i)  maternal  and  child  health  services,  (ii)  control  of \ncommunicable  diseases,  (iii) services  to  improve  access  to  basic \nhealth  care,  and  (iv) referral  services  including  laboratory  and  other \ndiagnostic services.   \n \nThe  Project  will  support  DBP\u2019s  Sustainable  Health  Care  Investment \nProgram,  a  credit  facility  established  in  2007  to  support  the  health \nsector  reform  agenda  and  implementation  framework\u2014Fourmula \nOne for Health (F1)\u2014of the Department of Health (DOH). The credit \nfacility is available to local government units (LGUs), and the private \nsector  through  two  windows  (i)  direct  retail  lending  for  LGUs  and \nlarger  private  sector  subborrowers,  and  (ii)  wholesale  lending  to \naccredited financial intermediaries (microfinance intermediaries, rural \nand  thrift  banks)  for  small  private  subborrowers.  The  Investment \nProgram  is  financed  from  DBP\u2019s  own  resources  and  supplementary \nfunds  of  development  partners,  and  supports  both  capital \ninvestments and working capital. \n \nThe Project\u2019s outputs are (i) upgraded LGU health services, (ii) more \nefficient  health  delivery  systems  through  public\u2013private  partnership \n(PPP)  and  innovative  strategies,  (iii)  improved  access  to  small-scale \nprivate  providers,  and  (iv)  enhanced  institutional  capacity  for  health \nsector lending. \n \nThe Government of the Philippines (the Government) is committed to \nmeeting the country's MDGs. The Philippines MDG Report for 2007 \nhighlights the mixed achievements, and especially the slow progress \nin  reducing  maternal  mortality,  and  the  need  for  better  health \nservices.   \n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nAllocation and  \nRelending Terms \n\nfor  mobilizing  off-budget  resources \n\nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  supports  the  Government\u2019s \nplans \nthrough  government \nfinancial institutions, the private sector, nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs), and civil society.  \n \nADB\u2019s  Health  Sector  Development  Program  (2004\u20132010)  supported \nkey  policy  reforms  and  implementation  of  DOH\u2019s  F1  for  health.  The \nProject  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020  (involving  MDGs,  PPP, \npublic  expenditure  management)  and  will  enable  ADB  to  continue \npolicy dialogue on health sector development. \n \nThe  Project  will  address  a  key  bottleneck  in  the  implementation  of \nDOH\u2019s F1 by providing credit to upgrade health facilities. This will not \nonly improve health services, but will trigger higher reimbursement of \nthe  Philippine  Health  Insurance  Corporation  (PHIC)  and  thereby \nreduce  the  cost  of  health  care  for  the  poor,  which  in  turn  will \ncontribute to achieving MDGs.  \n \nThe impact of the Project is improved overall health status, especially \nin relation to MDGs by (i) reduced under-five child mortality rate and \nreduced  infant  mortality  rate  (MDG  4),  and  (ii) reduced  maternal \nmortality  ratio  (MDG  5).  The  Project\u2019s  outcome  is  increased  use  of \nbasic health care and referral services by the poor in general, and by \nwomen and children in particular, in the subproject sites. The Project \nwill be nationwide, with the exception of the National Capital Region. \n \nThe project investment cost is estimated at $63.36 million equivalent, \nincluding taxes and duties of $5.50 million equivalent. \n \nADB\u2019s lending procedures for financial intermediaries will apply. \n \n\nFinancing Plan \n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGender and Development Cooperation Funda \nDevelopment Bank of the Philippines \nEquity (public and private sectors) \n\n \n\nTotal \n\n \n\nTotal \n50.00 \n0.40 \n1.94 \n11.02 \n63.36 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n% \n78.91 \n0.63 \n3.06 \n17.40 \n100.00 \n\na  Contributors: the governments of Canada, Denmark, Ireland, and Norway. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \nDBP  has  requested  a  loan  of  \u00a54,520,780,200  (equivalent  to  $50 \nmillion)  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  to  help  finance  the \nProject. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of \n6 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment \ncharge of 0.15% per annum, and such other terms and conditions as \nset  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement.  The  Gender  and  Development \nCooperation  Fund  will  provide  a  grant  up  to  $400,000  to  be \nadministered by ADB. \n \nDBP  is  the  borrower.  The  Republic  of  the  Philippines,  under  the \nterms  of  a  guarantee  agreement,  will  guarantee  the  loan.  For \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nrelending  to  its  subborrowers,  DBP  uses  (i)  retail  lending  and \n(ii) wholesale lending.  \n \nRetail  lending  is  for  collateralized  subprojects  from  $100,000  to  $5 \nmillion  equivalent.  DBP\u2019s  lending  terms  are  at  market  interest  rates \nand  the  repayments  are  based  on  subprojects\u2019  projected  cash  flows, \nwith  repayment  periods  of  up  to  15  years  for  civil  works,  up  to  10 \nyears  for  equipment,  up  to  5  years  for  working  capital,  and  grace \nperiods of up to 3 years. Amortization of principal and interest is on a \nquarterly basis.  \n \nWholesale  lending  is  for  accredited  financial  intermediaries  (including \nmicrofinance institutions, rural and thrift banks, and cooperatives) who \nborrow  amounts  ranging  from  $100,000  to  $500,000  equivalent  for \nonlending  under  DBP  lending  terms.  The  terms  of  onlending  by \nfinancial intermediaries depend on the amounts borrowed and whether \nor  not the subloans are  collateralized.  Expected repayment  periods is \nup to 10 years, with grace periods ranging from 6 months to 2 years.  \n \nThe  first  three  subloans  financed  under  the  loan  and  any  subloans \ncosting more than $2 million equivalent will be submitted to ADB for \nreview and approval before DBP approves the subloan. For subloans \nbelow  or  equal  to  $2  million  equivalent,  DBP  will  submit  to  ADB  a \nstatement  of  subloans  describing  the  subproject,  amount  applied, \npurpose  of  the  subloan,  eligibility  criteria,  including  terms  and \ncondition.  Loan  review  missions  will  review  selected  subprojects \nduring implementation. \n \nUntil 31 December 2015  \n \n30 June 2015 \n\nsenior \n\nthe  Health  Sector \n\nthe  Department  of \n\nchaired  by  DBP\u2019s \n\n \nDBP \n \nInvestment  Advisory \nDBP  has  established \nCommittee \nvice-president,  with \nrepresentatives  of  DBP,  DOH,  PHIC,  the  Municipal  Development \nFund  Office  (MDFO), \nInterior  and  Local \nGovernment (DILG), and the private sector. DBP has entered into an \nagreement  with  DILG,  DOH,  PHIC,  and  MDFO  that  outlines  the \nobjectives,  procedures  and  areas  for  cooperation,  eligibility  criteria \nfor  borrowers,  eligible \ninvestment  costs,  DOH  preparation  of \nfeasibility  and  capacity  development,  flow  of  funds,  and  monitoring \nand evaluation. \n \nDBP  has  set  up  a  project  management  office  (PMO)  under  its \nSustainable  Health  Care  Investment  Program  in  the  Program \nDevelopment  Department.  It  includes  a  project  director,  a  project \nmanager, an assistant project manager, and two project associates as \nDBP staff. The project director will be the officer responsible for overall \nproject execution, finance, monitoring, and reporting to the committee \nand  ADB.

The assistant project manager, assisted by the project \nassociates  will  run  day-to-day  PMO  operations.  The  PMO  will  also \nrecruit  experts  in  health  systems,  hospital  civil  works,  hospital \nenvironment  and  waste  management,  monitoring  and  evaluation, \nfinancial  management,  and  legal  matters.  Other  DBP  divisions  at  the \ncentral  and  regional  levels  will  provide  necessary  support  for  the \neffective implementation of the Project. \n \nProcurement of goods and services financed under the loan will be in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended \nfrom time to time). Except where stated otherwise in the procurement \nplan,  procurement  undertaken  by  beneficiaries  under  the  loan  will  be \nin  accordance  with  the  procedure  set  out  in  procurement  of  loans  to \nfinancial intermediaries that allows for procurement in accordance with \nestablished  private  sector  or  commercial  practices.  For  other  cases \nidentified  in  the  procurement  plan,  however,  national  or  international \ncompetitive  bidding  may  be  the  specified  form  of  procurement.  The \nprocedures followed for national competitive bidding will be those set \nforth  in  the  Government  Procurement  Reform  Act  (Republic  Act  No. \n9184)  with  clarifications  and  modifications  in  the  national  competitive \nbidding  annex  of  the  Procurement  Plan.  Civil  works  in  excess  of \n$5,000,000  equivalent  and  contracts  for  goods  estimated  to  cost  in \nexcess  of  $1,000,000  equivalent  will  be  procured  based  on \ninternational competitive bidding.  \n \nDBP  will  engage,  administer,  and  finance  84  person-months  of \nnational  consulting  services  in  the  areas  of  health  systems,  social \nmarketing,  and  hospital  environmental  and  medical  waste \nmanagement.  The  assignment  will  be  implemented  over  24  months. \nDBP  will  also  engage  and  administer  90  person-months  of  national \nconsulting  services  financed  under  the  Gender  and  Development \nCooperation  Fund.  These  services  are  to  be  sourced  through  a \nnational  health  NGO  in  the  areas  of  community  health,  training,  and \nlegal matters. The NGO will be selected using quality- and cost-based \nselection  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n \nHealth  Benefits.  The  Project  is  designed  to  address  MDGs  by \ntargeting the poor, in particular women and children with poor health \nindicators.  It  specifically  addresses  gaps  in  basic  health  care, \nincluding  maternal  and  child  health  care,  communicable  disease \ncontrol,  diagnostic  services,  and  referral  services.  The  Project \npromotes  the  use  of  PHIC-accredited  health  facilities,  thereby \npromoting  quality  standards  of  services,  and  supports  partnership \nbetween  the  public  and the  private  sectors  to  address  such  gaps  in \nhealth care as staff shortages for maternal care.  \n \nSocial,  Gender  and  Poverty  Benefits.  The  Project  is  designed  to \nresult  in  major  social,  gender,  and  poverty  benefits  with  multiple \nimpacts.  A  larger  proportion  of  the  beneficiaries  will  be  the  poor, \nwomen,  and  children.  They  will  benefit  from  upgrading  LGU  health \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nimproved  access \n\nthe  Project  provides \n\nfor  small  providers  close \n\nfacilities,  and  from  filling  gaps  in  service  delivery  through  PPP  and \nsupport \nto  communities.  Oversight \narrangements,  capacity  building,  provincial  plans,  eligibility  criteria, \nand targeted funding for assisting small providers will help to ensure \nsuitable  subprojects  are  selected  that  yield  maximum  benefit  for \nthese  vulnerable  groups.  The  Project  also  supports  PHIC \naccreditation of health providers close to the underserved population. \nFinally, \nto  credit  and \nopportunities for improved earnings for small-scale health providers, \nwho are often female (midwives, drug store owners).  \n \nFinancial  Protection  of  the  Poor.  The  poor  will  benefit  through \n(i) reduced  costs  of  care  and  transport;  (ii)  increased  subsidy  from \nPHIC-accredited  health  facilities,  including  generic  drug  outlets \noffering  lower  priced  drugs,  and  indirectly,  (iii) through  better  health \nresulting in less income erosion and increased productivity.  \n \nEconomic  Benefits  and  Financial  Sustainability.  The  Project  will \nimprove  technical  and  allocative  efficiencies.  The  economic  analysis \nshows  the  Project  will  have  substantial  economic  benefits  from \naverting maternal and child mortality even without including morbidity \nand disability in the analysis. The subprojects are generally considered \nfinancially sustainable, provided revenues are not delayed. \n \nimplementation  are \nfor  successful  project \nKey  assumptions \n(i) adequate  recurrent  and  capital  budgets  by  national  government \nand  LGUs    for  health-related  programs,  (ii)  enrollment  of  indigents \nand  the  poor  into  PHIC,  (iii)  provider  access  to  a  comprehensive \nPHIC  benefits  and  reimbursements  package,  and  (iv)  LGUs\u2019  and \nprivate  health  entrepreneurs\u2019  willingness  and  ability  to  borrow  at \nDBP\u2019s (or financial intermediaries\u2019) terms.  \n \nDelayed  Mobilization  of  LGUs.  DBP,  through  its  partnership  with \nDOH and the Department of Interior and Local Government, will need \nto ensure the timely mobilization of LGUs under F1 and the ensuing \npreparation of the subproject feasibility studies.   \n \nLimited  Experience  in  the  Health  Sector.  DBP  has  limited \nexperience  in  the  health  sector.  To  mitigate  this  risk,  DBP  will \nstrengthen its capacity and partner with other agencies.  \n \nA  technical  assistance  grant  of  $1,000,000  will  be  financed  by  the \nJapan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan for public\u2013\nprivate  partnership  in  health  to  support  LGUs  and  private  providers \nby  (i)  introducing   innovative  public\u2013private  partnership  strategies  to \nimprove  efficiency,  access,  and  quality  of  services;  (ii)  assisting \nsmall-scale  health  providers  to  improve  their  access  to  credit  to \nsupport  progress  towards  health-related  MDGs;  and  (iii)  mobilizing \nprivate resources for achieving MDGs.  \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\nTechnical Assistance \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\n\f\f \n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed loan; \nand  (ii)  a  proposed  administration  of  a  grant  to  be  provided  by  the  Gender  and  Development \nCooperation Fund,1 both to the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) for the Credit for Better \nHealth  Care  Project.  The  report  also  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Public\u2013\nPrivate Partnership in Health, and if the Board approves the loan and the grant, I, acting under the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. The design and monitoring framework \nis in Appendix 1.   \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe  Government  of  the  Philippines,  with  its  partners,  wants  to  improve  health  care  for  its \npopulation of about 90 million to achieve the Millennium Development  Goals (MDGs)  and ensure \ntimely and adequate response to the changing morbidity patterns in the Philippines. The country\u2019s \nMDG performance is mixed: the infant mortality rate was reportedly reduced to 24 deaths per 1,000 \nlive births in 2006 and is on track. The malnutrition rate (weight by age) shows little improvement at \n26% but is above the regional average. The maternal mortality ratio has declined to 162 deaths per \n100,000 live births in 2006, and it may not reach MDG targets. Tuberculosis and other communicable \ndiseases  remain  common,  and  HIV/AIDS  is  emerging.2 Health  indicators  in  the  Eastern  Visayas, \nBicol,  and  most  of  Mindanao  are  particularly  lagging.  The  country\u2019s  relatively  slow  progress  in \nhealth is linked to poverty, rapid population growth, and low investment in health. Health services \nfall short in terms of access and affordability for the poor, quality and efficiency of service delivery, \nand financing of services and investment.  \n \n3. \nThe  Philippines  has  an  average  per  capita  income  of  $1,351,  albeit  with  considerable \ninequity. Economic growth was 7% in 2007 but slowed to 4.6% annually in the first half of 2008. It \nis predicted to slow further to 3%\u20134% in 2009. Reflecting the global slowdown, exports have fallen \nand  so  has  foreign  direct  investment.  Public  sector  consumption  and  investment  spending  have \ncontracted  in  real  terms,  and  private  sector  consumption  growth  is  at  its  lowest  since  2001. \nInflation  was  a  high  7%  in  2008  and  is  rising.  It  particularly  affects  the  poor,  given  the  high  food \nprice  inflation.  The  Government  has  responded  by  postponing  its  goal  of  a  balanced  budget  to \nallow for increased spending in 2008 in infrastructure, social protection, and subsidies.  \n \n4. \nThe  robust  economic  growth  in  recent  years  has  apparently  had  little  impact  on  poverty. \nThe 2006 poverty level of 33%, or 27.6 million, is similar to the 2000 level. Income inflation is not \nkeeping pace with price inflation, especially in recent times. Social safety net programs are limited, \ngiving  the  poor  and  near  poor  little  protection.  Catastrophic  events  such  as  the  loss  of  a  job  or \nhospitalization  result  in  food  shortages  among  the  poor,  and  cause  the  near  poor  to  slip  into \npoverty.  In  1997,  a  sponsored  program  for  the  poor  was  introduced  under  the  Philippine  Health \nInsurance Corporation (PHIC) to offset some health care costs, and in 2007, the Ahon Pamilyang \nPilipino  (conditional  cash  transfer  program)  was  piloted.  To  improve  social  protection,  the  PHIC \naims  to  achieve  universal  enrollment  of  the  poor,  with  budgetary  support  from  central  and  local \ngovernments, and to provide a comprehensive benefits package for the poor.  \n \n5. \nHealth sector spending remains low. In 2005, it was 3.3% of gross domestic product or $40 \nper capita. While public expenditures for health have grown in absolute terms, they have not kept \npace  with  population  and  inflationary  pressures.  Health  care  is  financed  from  multiple  sources, \n\n                                                 \n1  Contributors: the governments of Canada, Denmark, Ireland, and Norway. \n2  Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n\n\f2 \n \n\n1. \n\nPhilippine Health System and Strategy \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nincluding  the  national  budget  (16.7%),  local  government  (17.5%),  PHIC  (9.5%),  private  insurers, \nand out of pocket (48%). Public health spending as a percentage of total health spending declined \nfrom 41% in 2000 to 29% in 2005, due in particular to declining local government expenditures.  \n \n6. \nTo  help  improve  health  services,  the  Government  is  encouraging  local  government  units \n(LGUs)  to  mobilize  off-budget  support  through  government  financial  intermediaries  (GFIs),  the \nprivate  sector,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and  civil  society,  with  special  schemes  for \npoorer  LGUs  and  those  unable  to  access  funds  from  the  private  capital  markets.  The \nGovernment\u2019s LGU financing framework (1996) is helping create a credit culture among LGUs to \nimprove their creditworthiness. Its LGU credit policy framework (1996) promotes the involvement of \nGFIs in LGU financing, and it guides GFIs and the Municipal Development Fund Office (MDFO) to \nact as catalysts to bring LGUs into the mainstream of private capital markets. This will open up off-\nbudget financing channels for health investment.  \n \n7. \nThe Project will support DBP to offer LGUs and the private sector better access to credit to \nhelp  achieve  MDGs,  improve  public  sector  management,  stimulate  public\u2013private  partnership \n(PPP), and improve rural access to health care. The Project is included in the country operations \nbusiness plan for 2009\u201320103 and is in line with the Asian Development Bank's (ADB\u2019s) long-term \nstrategic framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020).4   \n \nB. \n \n \n \n8. \nThe Philippines has a dual health care system of largely tax-financed public health services \nat  national and  local levels  plus  an  extensive  for-profit  and  nonprofit  private  sector  that  is  largely \nfinanced from user fees. Public health services in the Philippines are provided by the Department \nof  Health  (DOH),  LGUs,  and  other  agencies.  LGUs  finance  and  operate  provincial  and  district \nhospitals,  and  municipal  governments  run  rural  health  units  and  barangay  health  stations.5 The \nprivate health sector includes clinics, hospitals, insurance companies, manufacturers of drugs and \nequipment,  and  training  institutes. 6  PHIC  is  a  government-owned  and  controlled  corporation \nattached  to  DOH,  mandated  to  administer  the  PHIC  program  and  ensure  that  Filipinos  have \nfinancial access to health services. \n \n9. \nThe  Philippines  health  system  has  gone  through  several  reforms,  including  devolution  of \nhealth services to local government units in 1991 and the national health insurance act in 1995 that \nincluded the nonformal sector. In 1999, DOH launched the health sector reform agenda to improve \nthe sector\u2019s delivery, regulation, and financing. In 2005, DOH launched Fourmula One for Health \n(F1)\u2014the  reform\u2019s  implementation  framework  for  2005\u20132010.  F1  is  directed  toward  achieving \nbetter  health  outcomes,  a  more  responsive  health  system,  and  more  equitable  health  care \nfinancing (especially for the poor). Its four objectives are to (i) secure more, better, and sustained \nfinancing for health care; (ii) assure the quality and affordability of health goods and services; (iii) \nensure  access  to  and  availability  of  essential  and  basic  health  care  packages;  and  (iv)  improve \nperformance  of  the  health  system.  F1  is  designed  to  implement  critical  health  interventions  as  a \nsingle  package,  backed  by  effective  management  infrastructure  and  financing  arrangements.  It \nengages the entire health sector, including public and private services, development partners, and \ncivil  society,  and  it  is  the  basis  for  DOH\u2019s  medium-term  expenditure  framework  (2007\u20132010).

Manila.    \n5  Rural  health  units  serve  a  catchment  population  of  about  40,000  people,  and  barangay  health  stations  about  5,000 \n\npeople. A barangay is the country\u2019s smallest administrative division and corresponds to the village level. \n6  The number of LGU hospitals has increased to about 700, compared to about 1,100 private hospitals.     \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\ncoordinates  all  sector  activities,  including  aid  harmonization  through  the  sector  development \napproach  for  health  (SDAH).7 ADB  supports  F1  through  SDAH  and  participates  in  DOH\u2019s  joint \nassessment and planning initiative with other development partners.   \n \n10. \nA key feature of F1 is to engage PHIC as the main lever to effect each of the four reform \nareas under a single national implementation plan and under single local health investment plans \nin  the  first  batch  of  16  provinces.  DOH  wants  to  scale  up  the  reforms  and  build  ownership  in  all \nprovinces by 2010. The sector needs, however, to address multiple challenges, including (i) limited \naccess to and affordability of health care for the poor, (ii) inadequate quality and inefficiency of service \ndelivery, (iii) lack of delivery standards and accountability mechanisms, and (iv) limited financing and \naccess to credit for operating services properly and investing in buildings and equipment. All of these \nneed to be addressed under F1 to achieve the MDGs and adjust to the changing demographic and \nepidemiological situation.  \n \n11. \nThe Project will help address these challenges in implementing F1 and SDAH by providing \ncredit  to  both  LGUs  and  private  providers  to  upgrade  health  facilities  in  order  to  obtain \naccreditation and provide better health services. In addition to the direct benefits of better services, \naccreditation will trigger PHIC reimbursement. That will reduce the cost of health care for the poor, \nwhich in turn will contribute to achieving MDGs. Government oversight, provincial plans, eligibility \ncriteria  for  providers  and  subprojects,  marketing,  and  monitoring  will  assist  in  targeting  maternal \nand child health and the poor in general. The introduction of new packages for maternal and child \nhealth  and  outpatient  care  currently  under  preparation  by  PHIC  will  further  trigger  access  and \nquality enhancement while increasing affordability. The health sector analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n\n2. \n\nAccess and Affordability  \n\n \nDemand for health services remains low among the poor and vulnerable groups.8 This may be \n12. \ndue to a variety of reasons, including (i) the relatively high cost of medical care, drugs and transport; \n(ii) social  and  cultural  biases  of  both  patients  and  providers;  (iii)  lack  of  understanding  of  modern \nmedical care; and (iv) limited geographical access to services. Households have limited information on \nhealth benefits and costs, and they may be reluctant to use services due to the perceived poor quality \nor high cost of care. Only 37% of users of public hospitals were satisfied with public health services \n(footnote 8). Facility-based childbirth remains low among the poor (11% among the poor, versus 38% \noverall in 2003). Child immunization coverage is also lower (55% among the poor, versus 70% overall \nin  2003).  The  poor  primarily  use  the  barangay  health  stations  or  rural  health  units  for  health  care \nbecause of access and affordability considerations (79%). When possible, however, lower level care \nis bypassed for higher-level care even when not needed, contributing to low occupancy rates (20%\u2013\n40%)  in  district  hospitals  and  overuse  of  provincial  hospitals.  System  reforms  and  investments  for \nupgrading are required that will redistribute demand by appropriate levels of care.  \n \n13. \nThe cost of health care, including for drugs, is a key reason for the low utilization by the poor. \nEstimates suggest that about 30%\u201340% of the population finds it difficult to pay for drugs.9 Financial \nprotection  against  illness  costs  has  been  one  of  the  Government\u2019s  top  priorities.  A  social  health \ninsurance  program\u2014PHIC\u2014was  established  in  1995  with  the  mandate  to  provide  financial \nprotection against illness costs. A decade later, coverage is still not universal and is extremely low \namong the informal sectors and the poor (50% among the poor, versus 73% overall in 2007).10 The \n                                                 \n7  SDAH is not yet a full sector-wide approach, as, for example, projects are administered and financed separately.      \n8  National Statistics Office. 2006. Philippine National Demographic Health Survey. Manila. \n9  Retail drug prices are estimated to be six times the international reference pricing at public facilities, and 15 times the \ninternational reference pricing at private facilities. The poor often rely on private retailers, as public sector drug stores \nand health facilities where drugs are subsidized often lack supplies.  \n\n10 On  average,  only  66%  of  indigents  and  the  poor  are  covered  under  the  PHIC-sponsored  program.  The  poverty \nidentification  methodology  is  unreliable,  and  estimates  suggest  that  at  least  one-third  of  those  under  the  sponsored \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n \n\nlack of mandatory financial contribution from central or local governments limits enrollment of the \npoor in PHIC.  \n \n14. \nF1  promotes  enrollment  of  the  poor  in  PHIC  through  cost-sharing  of  the  premium.  The \nbiggest drawback of the current PHIC contribution, however, is that it only reimburses a small part \nof the expenses. Household out-of-pocket spending for health had increased to 48% of total health \nspending  in  2005,  often  with  serious  consequences  on  household  assets  and  livelihoods.  PHIC \ncould  increase  its  share,  as  it  has  high  financial  reserves  unnecessary  for  assuring  its  solvency. \nThese could be wisely spent in the sector.  \n  \n15. \nThe  original  PHIC  benefits  package  was  for  hospital  services  (catastrophic  illnesses),  not \nfor  outpatient  services  and  medicines.  Basic  treatments  for  common  conditions  of  the  poor  were \nnot reimbursed. This perpetuated hospitalization and unnecessary expenses. PHIC will launch new \nbenefits packages to help address the health care needs of the poor, women, and children. These \ninclude (i) the new patient prepaid service package where all insured poor receive a basic package \nof  service  at  no  cost;11 (ii)  the  maternity  care  package  (for  prenatal,  delivery,  and  postnatal  care) \nthat  reimburses  expenses  to  public  and  private  health  providers;  (iii)  the  newborn  care  package, \nwhich  reimburses  for  childcare,  including  immunization  against  childhood  diseases;  and  (iv)  the \npackage  to  support  strengthening  of  referral  networks,  such  as  district  hospitals.  The  benefits \npackages  are  still  not  comprehensive  and  fragmented,  but  in  the  interim  should  provide  the  poor \nbetter financial protection against illness costs. It will also improve access and equity by engaging \nthe private sector and small-scale health providers who operate closer to communities, and it will \nprovide  an  incentive  for  LGUs  to  accredit  public  clinics  closer  to  the  communities.  The  service \npackages  will  be  promoted  among  health  providers  and  PHIC  beneficiaries.  The  Project  will \nprovide credit for providers seeking PHIC accreditation to support these PHIC benefits packages. \n \n\n3. \n\nQuality and Efficiency \n\n \n16. \nThe public sector has an expanded network of services reaching down to the village level. \nSince  devolution,  however,  the  health  delivery  system  faces  fragmented  organization  and \nmanagement,  delivery,  and  financing,  which  appear  to  favor  investments  in  urban  hospitals. 12 \nSupply and distribution of public goods and services, such as vaccinations against communicable \ndiseases,  essential  drugs,  and  family  planning  commodities,  remain  insufficient. 13 Basic  health \nservices, with limited LGU commitment, often have inadequate personnel, equipment, or supplies, \nresulting  in  patients\u2019  inability  to  use  services  or  self-referring  to  hospitals  unnecessarily.  The \nPhilippines produces a large number of doctors and nurses, but the increasing export of medical \npersonnel for overseas employment has resulted in staff shortages and quality constraints. Further, \nbasic health services are not linked to appropriate referral services, making it difficult, for example, \nto address childbirth complications.  \n \n17.  While a substantial share of public finance is allocated to tertiary hospitals (45% in 2005), the \nreform  agenda  for  hospital  autonomy  has  moved  little.  Many  local  public  hospitals  run  inefficiently, \nhaving low  quality  of  medical and ancillary services, over- or underutilization  of beds, unnecessary \nuse of hospitals for basic health services, long waiting lines, high-costs incurred by patients due to \nlimited diagnostic services and unnecessary use of drugs, and lack of management systems. Most \nhospitals lack trained hospital managers and are not financially sustainable. Further, public hospitals \n\n                                                                                                                                                               \nprogram  are  not  poor.  The  Department  of  Social  Welfare  and  Development  is  refining  the  methodology,  with  PHIC \nadoption expected in 2009.  \n\n11 PHIC capitation is too low at P300 (or $6) per family per year, leading to a concern that LGUs may have insufficient \n\nincentive to accredit public clinics. \n\n12 For example, PHIC reimbursement for the same services is higher at tertiary versus secondary hospitals. \n13 The World Bank has responded to some of this underfunding in public health commodities by providing lending for the \n\nNational Sector Support for Health Reform Project in 2006. Assistance is also provided by Global Health Fund. \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\nface competition from private hospitals in the same area attracting the nonpoor by offering qualified \nstaff and modern medical equipment and diagnostic services. Hospitals are often competing rather \nthan seeking partnership arrangements.  \n \n18. \nThe large private hospitals are typically located in urban areas and provide curative services. \nSmaller private clinics also operate in rural areas. The private sector is largely unregulated, and its \nperformance is not easy to monitor. Service delivery standards and user fees are understood to vary \nconsiderably  in  response  to  earnings  and  other  financial  incentives.14 The  past  incentive  structures \n(such  as  reimbursements  under  PHIC)  were  targeted  to  curative  health  care  and  tertiary  inpatient \nservices.  This  triggered  more  investment  in  curative  health  care,  especially  hospitals,  and  to  a \nskewed distribution in favor of urban areas.  \n \n19. \nUnder  F1,  LGUs  are  encouraged  to  seek  partnership  with  the  private  sector.  Recent  DOH \nmandates  and  development  of  the  PHIC  benefit  packages  for  basic  health  care  should  provide \nincentives for LGUs and the private sector to improve services. DOH has taken some steps to build \ncapacity  for  public\u2013private  collaborations.15 The  tuberculosis  program  provides  a  good  example  of \nsuch  partnership. 16  The  generic  drugs  retail  program  (botika  ng  bayan)  was  initiated  through \npartnership with nonprofit community outlets. The private providers (clinics and hospitals) are being \nbrought  into  the  network  of  providers  in  the  provinces  under  PHIC  accreditation. 17  The  private \nsector\u2019s response could address shortages of (i) medical personnel in underserved areas, (ii) public \nhealth care for the poor, and (iii) complementary services to the public sector where there are market \nfailures. The revised PHIC MDG care package creates an incentive for small-scale health providers \nto  be  accredited  and  reimbursed  for  services  provided  to  PHIC  beneficiaries.  Likewise,  the  private \nretail  drug  outlets  could  improve  their  inventories  and  expand  access  to  affordable  generic  drugs. \nThe Project has an opportunity to provide access to credit for LGUs and private small-scale providers \nin order to accredit their facilities and strengthen basic health services. \n \n20. \nFurther, LGU hospitals are undertaking several local initiatives: Some have taken steps to \nbecome  economic  enterprises  although  their  financial  sustainability  still  depends  on  salaries \ncovered  by  government  budgets.  Others  have  moved  to  improve  effectiveness  and  efficiencies \nthrough  outsourcing  diagnostic  and  laboratory  services  or  contracting  in  clinical  care  from  the \nprivate sector. Some forms of efficiencies could be attained by public hospitals through improved \nmanagement  systems,  inventory  systems,  telemedicine,  and  information  technology.  Improved \npartnerships between the private sector and public hospitals could result in minimizing costs and \nmaximizing services for beneficiaries. PPP could help increase access, lower costs, and improve \nquality  of  facilities  and  services.  The  Project  has  an  opportunity  to  promote  access  to  credit  by \nLGUs and the private sector for innovative strategies and efficiency gains. \n \n\n4. \n\nQuality Assurance and Accountability Mechanisms \n\n \n21. \n\nThe  quality  assurance  mechanisms  in  place,  such  as  DOH\u2019s  licensing  and  PHIC\u2019s \n\n                                                 \n14 Many  private  medical  personnel  are  unwilling  to  go  to  rural  and  remote  areas,  as  the  poor  are  unable  to  pay  for \nservices  and  LGUs  have  not  insured  the  poor  under  PHIC.  Costs  of  relocation  and  accreditation  are  high,  and \nparticularly small and medium-sized health providers do not have financial resources or access to credit by  which to \nsurvive in rural and remote areas. Midwives often live in close proximity to the population, including in the rural areas, \nand they could also benefit from credit to set up clinics.  \n\n15 DOH  promotes  public\u2013private  collaborations  and  coordination.  Such  initiatives  are  underway,  although  no \n\ncomprehensive policy or guidelines exist to form PPPs. DOH is taking steps in this direction.  \n\n16 This  involves  a  coalition  between  DOH,  thoracic  physicians,  infectious  disease  control  specialists,  and  the \n\npharmaceutical industry. \n\n17 Among solutions for LGUs are (i) contracting between public and private sectors to ensure the availability of staffing in \npublic facilities, (ii) contracting with private hospitals or specialists for emergency referrals, (iii) increasing development \nand  operations  budgets  (or  access  to  affordable  credit  financing)  for  public  facility  accreditation,  and  (iv)  improving \nPHIC and other incentives for an appropriate market supply and demand response. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n \n\nincentives \n\ninadequate \n\nfor  some  providers \n\naccreditation of public and private health facilities, ensure that at least minimum quality standards \nare  maintained.18 Although  licensing  of  health  providers  is  mandatory,  accreditation  is  voluntary. \nHealth  providers  seek  accreditation  to  become  eligible  for  PHIC  reimbursements  for  operating \nexpenditures and reduce the cost of care for PHIC beneficiaries. In the public sector, limited capital \nspending  and  reduced  operating  expenses  have  resulted  in  acute  needs  for  building  rehabilitation \nand  modern  equipment.  Additionally,  the  public  sector  faces  shortages  and  skewed  distribution  of \nhealth  personnel.  PHIC  provides \nto  maintain \naccreditation standards, and several health facilities do not meet minimum standards. Only 40% of \npublic clinics are accredited. Although 90% of public hospitals are accredited, many are just partially \nor under-accredited. In the private sector, small-scale health providers may also lack capital to meet \nthe  accreditation  standards  and  therefore  are  unable  to  offer  PHIC  benefits.  Limited  accreditation \nalso hinders access to information, thereby influencing health providers\u2019 quality and performance.  \n \nPHIC is currently upgrading its accreditation standards to be more performance-based and \n22. \nmeet  international  best  practices,  and  it  is  creating  incentives  for  health  facilities  to  seek \naccreditation.  Several  public  and  private  health  care  facilities  anticipated  making  capital \ninvestments  to  meet  the  new  accreditation  standards.  The  Project  provides  an  opportunity  to \naccess credit for such investments.  \n \n23.  \nAlthough  all  accredited  health  facilities  have  access  to  PHIC  reimbursement,  PHIC  has \nlimited influence on health providers\u2019 coverage of beneficiaries or on the price and quality of services \nprovided. To strengthen accountability mechanisms, PHIC is exploring how to introduce contracting \nwith health providers with regard to service type and package, quality, price, and location. A contract \nwould give PHIC better leverage with the providers, as well as opportunity to establish standards for \nservice  performance  and  to  assess  beneficiaries\u2019  satisfaction  with  the  services.  Contracting  could \nreduce balance billing and contain health care cost inflation while improving financial protection for \nPHIC beneficiaries. PHIC is now outlining legal agreements, and it plans to negotiate contract terms \nwith  selected  accredited  health  providers  who  are  willing  and  have  the  capacity  to  fulfill  the \ncontractual  terms.  PHIC  is  building  its  capacity  for  performance  monitoring,  and  there  is  an \nopportunity for the Project to support the development of a results-focused system of accountability.  \n \n\n5. \n\nFinancing and Access to Credit \n\n \nUnder the Local Government Code (LGC) of 1991, health service delivery was devolved to \n24. \nLGUs,  and  provinces  and  municipalities  are  required  to  cover  capital  and  recurrent  expenditures \nfor services under their responsibility, including those for health care. An LGU\u2019s budget is sourced \nthrough  (i) national  government  internal  revenue  allotment  (IRA),19 and  (ii)  local  government  tax-\nbased revenues and income-generation programs. Revenues of provinces and municipalities vary \nwidely, however, and several LGUs greatly depend on national government financial support. \n \n25. \nThe  budget  allocation  for  health  is  at  LGUs\u2019  discretion,  since  no  specific  formula  is \nmandated in the LGC and no formula is used for its allocation. LGUs have often not kept to LGC \nrecommendations. For example, personnel expenses have increased significantly (to represent on \naverage 69% of the LGU budget), thereby reducing operating expenses to almost half (averaging \n30%  of  the  LGU  budget).  LGU  recurrent  spending  on  health  care  is  insufficient  for  drugs  and \nsupplies  and  for  communicable  disease  control  programs.  Capital  outlays  for  health  care  have \nbeen  very  low  (on  average  at  2%  of  LGU  health  spending).  Bottlenecks  that  constrain \n\n                                                 \n18 PHIC\u2019s  accreditation  system  checks  for  availability  of  minimum  inputs  (e.g.,  water,  sanitation,  human  resources, \nequipment)  needed  for  a  functioning  health  facility.  Accreditation  at  least  ensures  availability  of  key  inputs  and  safety \nstandards. PHIC new accreditation standards (the Benchbook) will move to that of performance benchmarks.  \n\n19 The formula for IRA to LGUs is not pro-poor. Allocation is determined 50% by population size, 25% by land size, and \n25% by equal sharing. IRA is divided among provinces (23%), cities (23%), municipalities (34%) and barangays (20%). \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\nimprovements in local health service delivery and governance can be attributed to (i) fragmentation \nand  unclear  functional  and  expenditure  assignments  between  administrative  levels  (central, \nprovincial, and municipality), (ii) lack of mandates on health spending, (iii) resource constraints, (iv) \nweak fiscal and expenditure management, and (v) limited performance monitoring.  \n \nThrough  F1,  DOH  has  taken  some  steps  to  improve  resources  and  their  efficient  use  by \n26. \n(i) bringing LGUs into public partnerships to improve access to quality health services and ensure \nbetter  budget  allocation;  (ii)  offering  support  to  LGUs  on  performance-based  ongranting;  (iii) \npromoting  the  pooling  of  budgets  from  various  municipalities  to  rationalize  and  to  provide \nappropriate  allocations  for  effective  health  service  delivery;  (iv)  partnering  with  nonpublic-sector \nentities and thereby rationalizing healthcare  investments; and (v) ensuring cost-effective and cost-\nefficient  modalities,  including  PPPs,  in  health  care  financing  and  delivery.  Further  efforts  are \nrequired to strengthen and operationalize these initiatives.   \n \nResource-constrained  LGUs  are  permitted  under  the  LGC  to  seek  credit20 financing  for \n27. \ninfrastructure development, capital investment, and, in some cases, operating expenses, but they \nface  limited  access  to  credit  for  the  health  sector.  The  1996  LGU  financing  framework  promotes \ngraduating  LGUs  to  creditworthy  status  in  order  to  access  private  sources  of  capital.  LGUs  are \nconstrained in borrowing from the private capital markets, however, due to (i) a limited number of \nprivate  banks  accredited  as  LGU  IRA  depositories  or  with  access  to  IRA  intercept;  (ii)  limited \ncollateral,  thus  preventing  normal  creditor-borrower  relationships  from  being  established;  and  (iii) \nLGUs\u2019  lack  of  credit  history,  meaning  they  cannot  demonstrate  creditworthiness.  Further,  LGU \nhealth projects are (i) nonrevenue generating and less attractive for private capital markets, and (ii) \nlonger term for reasons of financial sustainability while private markets lend for shorter terms.  \n \nThe Government is improving systems to allow LGU access to private capital markets. The \n28.  \nADB-supported  Local  Government  Financing  and  Budget  Reform  Program  Cluster 21 enhances \nLGUs\u2019  financial  self-sufficiency,  and  during  2008\u20132010  it  will  (i)  simplify  debt  service  capacity \ncertification  of  LGUs,  and  (ii)  prepare  guidelines  and  test  its  functionality  for  LGUs  to  set  up  IRA \ndepository accounts in private banks. As borrowing from private capital markets is more typical for \nrevenue-generating projects, alternatives must be considered for LGUs to access credit for projects \nin the health sector. \n \nThe  1996  LGU  credit  policy  framework  promotes  optimizing  involvement  of  GFIs22 in  LGU \n29.  \nfinancing,  and  directs  GFIs  and  MDFO23 to  act  as  catalysts  to  bring  LGUs  into  the  mainstream  of \nprivate capital markets. Of 1,800 LGUs, only 14 are fully creditworthy, 945 (52%) are creditworthy but \nunable to tap private capital markets, and 726 (40%) are marginally creditworthy. Creditworthy LGUs \nunable to tap private capital markets can access GFI credit. MDFO lends to LGUs that are marginally \nor not creditworthy. For example, ADB\u2019s Health Sector Development Program (HSDP),24 uses MDFO \nas the conduit for relending to LGUs. \n \n\n                                                 \n20 The  public  sector  traditionally  relied  on  subsidized  credit,  but  this  constrained  growth  of  private  credit  financing.  The \nGovernment  introduced  a  policy  discouraging  subsidized  directed  credit  programs,  and  it  mandated  moving  all  such \nprograms  under  financial  institutions,  where  commercially  managed  programs  follow  market-based  interest  rates \n(Executive Order No. 138, 1999). \n\n21 ADB.  2007.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \n\nRepublic of the Philippines for the Local Government Financing and Budget Report Program Cluster. Manila.  \n\n22 GFIs\u2019 risk of relending to LGUs is minimized, as they can hold IRA depositories or require advanced depositories to be \n\nset up in their branch banks. \n\ninfrastructure.  \n\n23 MDFO  was  established  under  the  Department  of  Finance  in  1998  as  a  revolving  fund  to  support  LGU  borrowing  for \n\n24 ADB.  2004.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \n\nRepublic of the Philippines for the Health Sector Development Program. Manila.   \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n \n\n30.  \nIn 2007, DBP, one of the GFIs, approved a credit facility for lending at market-based interest \nrates under the umbrella of DBP\u2019s Sustainable Health Care Investment Program.25 This opens up an \navenue for GFI lending to creditworthy LGUs unable to tap private capital markets for health projects. \nLGUs  in  fiscal  capacity  income  class  levels  1  and  2,  as  well  as  others  that  are  creditworthy,  are \nexpected  to  gravitate  toward  GFIs.  LGU  consultation  highlighted  a  need  for  access  to  credit  for \nhealth  development  projects  (infrastructure,  equipment,  supplies,  and  consulting  services)  and \npotential interest in borrowing from GFIs (but at viable terms). The Philippines credit policy framework \nfor LGUs is described in Appendix 3. \n \nThe  Government  supports  enhancing  access  to  credit  for  small  and  medium  enterprises \n31.  \n(SMEs), and GFIs (such as DBP) use microfinance institutions (MFIs)26 for this purpose. SMEs face \nconstraints  in  accessing  credit  financing,  particularly  given  limited  collateral  and  skills  to  prepare \nbusiness  proposals  and  credit  applications.  The  nongovernment  small-scale  health  care  providers \ninclude such home-based small businesses as midwives, physician-run small clinics, and drug stores \nin  rural  municipalities.  These  providers\u2019  credit  needs  are  small,  but  the  benefits  are  substantial. \nAccess  to  credit  improves  the  sustainability  of  these  small-scale  health  care  providers  (particularly \ngiven the opportunity for PHIC accreditation and reimbursement to cover operating expenses) and it \nprovides financial protection to PHIC beneficiaries, especially the poor.  \n \n\nExternal Assistance and Aid Harmonization \n\n6. \n \nDOH introduced the SDAH in 2005 and asked development partners to align their programs \n32. \nto  support DOH\u2019s  F1  through  the Joint  Assessment  and  Planning  Initiative.27 DOH  has  prioritized \nmaternal  health  care  and  prepared  the  medium-term  health  sector  expenditure  framework.  DOH \nand partners are currently working on the health care financing strategy, a performance-monitoring \ntool,  private  sector  engagement,  rationalizing  investment  in  the  provinces  and  LGUs,  and  the \nanalysis of training programs.  \n \n33. \nThe  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  supports  F1  and  the  medium-term  expenditure \nframework,  and  it  promotes  integrated  programs  and  a  public\u2013private  mix  on  maternal  and  child \nhealth  and  disease  control.  The  European  Commission  committed  grant  support  to  16  F1 \nconvergence  sites  for  primary  health  care,  strengthening  financial  and  procurement  management \nsystems, and refining PHIC\u2019s benefits package and provider payment mechanisms. The World Bank \nis  providing  national-level  budget  support  for  essential  public  health  commodities,  as  well  as \nresources  to  enroll  the  poor  within  PHIC\u2019s  sponsored  program.  German  development  cooperation \nthrough  GTZ  is  assisting  PHIC  to  refine  accreditation  standards  and  increase  coverage  of  the \ninformal  sector  beneficiaries.  The  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development,  among \nothers, is supporting PPP in public health care delivery. Collectively, the development partners are \noverseeing the refinement and implementation of F1 and an improved PHIC.  \n \n34. \nThe  proposed  Project  is  in  line  with  F1,  and  it  will  support  DBP\u2019s  program.  German \ndevelopment  cooperation  through  KfW  will  provide  parallel  support  on  commercial  lending  terms  for \ninvestments in private secondary and tertiary hospitals. A list of external assistance is in Appendix 4. \n \n\n                                                 \n25 The DBP accumulated a pipeline for health sector borrowing in the amount of P7 billion. Of these, proposals for P3.5 \nbillion have been received, 10% of which are from government and the balance from the private sector. DBP used its \nown resources to lend about P1.9 billion in the health sector, with P1.7 billion (87%) going to private hospitals and the \nbalance of P0.2 billion going to the public sector and cooperatives. \n\n26 The Government mandates the growth of MFIs to provide access to credit financing for small businesses and families. \n\nMFI's include rural banks, cooperatives, and NGOs.  \n\n27 ADB,  European  Commission,  German  development  cooperation  through  GTZ  and  KfW,  Japan  International \nCooperation  Agency,  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund,  United  Nations  Population  Fund,  United  States  Agency  for \nInternational Development, World Bank, and WHO. \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\nExperience of ADB and Lessons  \n\n7. \n \nADB  has  been  engaged  in  the  health  sector  since  1994. 28  Of  the  five  health  projects \n35. \nsupported by ADB, three closed with a satisfactory rating. The other two projects are ongoing. ADB\u2019s \ninitial  projects  were  investment  projects  focusing  on  delivery  of  community  health  care  services, \nparticularly  to  women  and  children.  In  2004,  ADB  shifted  its  assistance  toward  policy  reforms  and \nhealth care system strengthening.  \n \n36. \nThe  HSDP  was  a  sector  development  project  that  supported  DOH\u2019s  Health  Sector  Reform \nAgenda through a policy reform and an investment loan (footnote 24). The policy actions included, \namong  others,  (i)  budgetary  support  of  the  Government  for  enrolling  the  poor  into  PHIC; \n(ii) refinement  of  the  PHIC  benefits  package  to  include  cost-effective  interventions,  MDG  care,  and \nsupport  for  the  poor  through  the  outpatient  care  package;  (iii)  refinement  of  guidelines  and \ngovernment  orders  to  build  partnerships  with  the  private  sector  for  priority  public  health  programs; \n(iv) promotion  of  contraceptives  financing  and  refining  the  essential  drugs  list  and  delivery;  and \n(v) rationalizing and integrating LGU health service delivery,  including to  promote quality standards \nthrough PHIC accreditation. The investment component focused on strengthening health services in \nthree of the 16 F1 convergence sites, in coordination with the European Commission. \n \n37. \nADB continues policy dialogue on many of these HSDP policy areas to address issues of \naccess, quality, and efficiency of health services delivery. Recent key policy areas of engagement \ninclude (i) introduction by DOH of a comprehensive policy on PPP in health, and (ii) introduction of \na  contracting  instrument  by  PHIC  that  would  allow  arrangements  between  PHIC  and  the  health \ncare  providers  to  ensure  good  quality  and  affordable  goods  and  services  for  PHIC  beneficiaries. \nADB continues to support the F1 for health and to work alongside the other development partners.  \n \n38. \nFurther, ADB\u2019s Local Government Financing and Budget Reform Program Cluster supports \nlocal  government  reforms  in  enhancing  effectiveness  and  transparency  in  the  delivery  of  critical \npublic services (footnote 21). The program cluster will boost real expenditures for service delivery \n(including  for  health,  education,  and  the  environment)  by  at  least  2%  annually  from  2008.  Of  the \n1,800 LGUs, 131 received financing by 2007 and an additional 250 are expected to receive it by \n2010 for improving service delivery through investment in environmental and health projects. The \nproposed  Project  follows  the  principles  of  the  LGU  financing  and  credit  policy  framework  for \nonlending to LGUs, and it complements the program cluster by supporting LGUs, in the interim, to \naccess credit from GFIs for health development projects.  \n \n39. \nDBP has set up a separate credit facility for the health sector. ADB's lending to DBP since \n1975  is  significant  and  has  been  in  various  social  sectors,  although  its  involvement  in  the  health \nsector  is  recent.  Among  the  seven  completed  ADB-financed  projects  with  DBP,  two  were  rated \nsatisfactory,  and  three  partly  satisfactory.  Among  the  reasons  cited  for  concerns  were  (i)  lack  of \ncompetitive  interest  rates  offered  by  DBP  as  compared  to  the  market,  presenting  a  constraint  for \nsmall-scale  subborrowers;  and  (ii)  limits  on  the  subborrower  profile  where  onlending  could  be \npursued  by  financial  intermediaries.  DBP  has  addressed  these  concerns  by  (i)  accepting  the \n\n                                                 \n28 Three of ADB\u2019s past health projects were cofinanced: (i) ADB. 1998. Report and Recommendation of the President to \nthe  Board  of  Directors  on  Proposed  Loans  to  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines  for  the  Early  Childhood  Development \nProject. Manila (Loans 1606/1607-PHI, cofinanced by the World Bank); (ii) ADB. 1994.

The  ongoing  HSDP \n(footnote 24) works in coordination with other development partners under the sector-wide approach for health.   \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n \n\nDepartment of Finance proposal to reduce its spread, and (ii) adding a wholesale relending window \nfor  small-scale  subborrowers.  During  preparation  of  the  proposed  Project,  LGUs  and  small-scale \nhealth providers were consulted as to their potential to borrow from DBP. During the first year of its \nimplementation, the Project will market to potential subborrowers and conduct further consultations. \n \nImplementation has generally been slow under externally financed DOH and DBP projects, \n40. \nand this will be a concern for the proposed Project. Steps are being taken to mitigate this risk by \nsupporting  partnership  between  DBP  and  other  technical  agencies,  as  well  as  by  recommending \nthat  DBP  recruit  a  team  of  experts,  including  a  full-time  health  specialist,  for  providing  technical \nsupport  to  the  subborrowers  to  enhance  their  implementation  and  monitoring  capacity  for  the \nProject.  For  sustainability  of  the  credit  facility,  the  proposed  Project  will  work  toward  building  the \ncapacity of DBP staff on health sector appraisal and monitoring, social marketing, and safeguards. \nTo  strengthen  the  capacity  and  access  to  credit  for  the  subborrowers,  partnership  will  be  sought \nwith  other  government  and  nongovernment  technical  agencies.  PHIC  will  form  close  partnership \nunder DBP in marketing benefit packages and through its contracting modality. \n \n41. \nDOH  and  DBP  have  not  conducted  before  and  after  surveys  for  some  projects,  making  it \ndifficult to assess project performance. The proposed Project recommends DBP provide resources \nand  mechanisms  to  conduct  studies  before  and  after  subproject  investment,  as  well  as  to \nindependently  monitor  overall  project  performance  through  its  Evaluation  Department  to  ensure \ndevelopment objectives are met and that the poor and underserved are benefiting from the Project.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nOutputs \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \n42. \nThe impact of the Project is improved overall health status, especially in relation to MDG 4 \n(reduce child mortality), and MDG 5 (improve maternal health) by 2015. The Project\u2019s outcome is \nincreased use of basic health care and referral services by the poor in general, and by women and \nchildren in particular, in the subproject sites. The Project will be nationwide,29 with the exception of \nthe National Capital Region.  \n \nB. \n \n43. \nThe  project  outputs  are  (i)  upgraded  LGU  health  services,  (ii)  more  efficient  health  care \ndelivery systems through PPP and innovative strategies, (iii) improved access to small-scale private \nproviders, and (iv) enhanced institutional capacity for health sector lending. \n \n44. \nThe  Project  supports  DBP\u2019s  recently  established  credit  program  for  the  health  sector. \nProject funds will be relent to public and private health services providers for capital investments \nand working capital. The funds will be used for (i) retail or direct lending to larger subprojects in the \npublic and private sectors, and (ii) wholesale relending through accredited financial intermediaries \nto  private  sector  smaller-scale  subprojects.  The  Project  will  use  ADB\u2019s  development  financial \nintermediary lending modality. \n \nSpecifically, the DBP credit will be used for subprojects that aim to (i) improve quality of health \n45. \ncare  services  to  attain  health  care  facility  accreditation  (under  the  PHIC);  (ii)  address  the  gaps  in \naccess  to  basic  health  services  (for  communicable  disease  control,  women  and  child  health  care, \n                                                 \n29 The Project relies on subborrowers\u2019 willingness and ability to apply for loans from DBP. The Project follows the LGU \ncredit policy framework, whereby MDFO, GFIs, and private capital markets each have a role (Appendix 3). The Project \nwill  support  retail  relending  to  those  areas  where  LGUs  already  have  memorandums  of  agreement  with  DOH  on \nsupporting F1. It also will support wholesale relending starting with those areas that are supported under the Gender  \nand Development Cooperation Fund.  \n\n\f \n\n11 \n\n \n\nclinical  care,  ancillary  services,  and  generic  drugs);  and  (iii)  improve  efficiency  and  effectiveness  in \nhealth  service  delivery  through  outsourcing,  improvement  in  management  systems,  and  other \ninnovative strategies. In addition to direct benefits resulting from this investment, it is anticipated that \nLGU\u2019s  total  recurrent  budgets  could  increase,  as  LGUs  will  be  expected  to  commit  to  increased \nallocation of recurrent budgets for health. Further, PHIC accreditation can provide an added stream of \nresources through PHIC reimbursements for operating expenses\u2014including personnel per diems and \ndrugs\u2014and  can  offer  some  financial  protection  to  the  population.  Partnerships  can  help  address \nshortages in financial and human resources without relying entirely on government budgets. Service \nperformance  outputs  can  be  stimulated  through  contracts  between  PHIC  and  health  care  providers \nthat stipulate beneficiaries, service packages, and prices charged.  \n \n46. \nEligible subborrowers will be LGUs and private sector health providers who support \nF1 and are committed to meeting MDGs. Eligible LGUs are those that (i) are responsible for public \nclinics and public hospitals in the municipalities and the provinces; (ii) have inadequate resources \nand cannot easily attain central government grant support; (iii) are creditworthy but unable to tap \nprivate  capital  markets;  and  (iv)  are  seeking  access  to  credit  to  attain  PHIC  accreditation  or \nupgrades,  PPP,  and/or  health  system  efficiencies.  Eligible  private  subborrowers \ninclude \nfoundations,  health  maintenance  organizations,  and  small-scale  health  care  providers  who  lack \naccess to credit, and/or do not have appropriate collateral. Service providers include laboratories \nand  other  diagnostic  services,  referral  networks,  midwifery  and  physician  care  needing  to  attain \nPHIC  accreditation  or  upgrades;  generic  drug  retailers  who  need  Philippine  International  Trading \nCorporation  accreditation;  and  rural  drug  distributors  willing  to  expand  their  networks  in \nmunicipalities.  Eligible  subprojects  are  those  who  meet  the  following  (i)  inclusion  in  the  province-\nwide investment plan for health or DOH's certificate of needs for new health facilities and permit to \nconstruct;  (ii)  for  hospitals,  a  hospital  diagnostic  center  or  hospital  development  plan,  including \nfeasibility,  financial  sustainability,  and  utilization  forecasts;  (iii)  location  in  an  underserved  area;  (iv) \nare licensed or accredited by DOH and/or Bureau of Food and Drugs and/or Philippine International \nTrading  Corporation  and/or  PHIC;  (v)  for  LGUs,  have  the  commitment  of  the  LGU  for  funding \noperations  and  maintenance  cost;  and  (iv)  comply  with  the  Government\u2019s  and  the  ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental and social safeguard policies. The eligible organizations (public or private) will have to \ndemonstrate  that  the  investments  will  result  in  better  health  services  and  benefit  targeted \nbeneficiaries. The eligibility criteria for subborrowers and subprojects are in Appendix 5. \n \n\n1. \n\nUpgraded LGU Health Services  \n\n \n47. \nThis  output  will  support  LGUs  to  upgrade  health  services,  develop  referral  networks  to \nstrengthen maternal and child health services, and improve standards and efficiencies of hospitals \nas  per  their  commitment  under  F1.  An  eligible  LGU  will  be  required  to  have  a  DOH-approved \nprovince-wide  investment  plan  for  health  and  a  certificate  of  needs  for  constructing  new  facilities \nand  purchasing  high-end  equipment.  Eligible  LGUs  will  have  to  demonstrate  that  they  have  the \nfiscal capacity to borrow (certificate required from Department of Finance) and provide assurances \nas to the availability of recurrent budgets, especially for drugs and operations. It is anticipated that \nunder this output, DBP will relend to about 77 LGUs30 (or about 5% of LGUs in the country), and \nthat each LGU will require an average of $500,000 equivalent (ranging from $100,000 to $2 million \nequivalent).  \n \n48. \nConstruction  and  Rehabilitation.  LGUs  will  obtain  credit  to  upgrade  health  facilities  to \nmeet  or  improve  PHIC  accreditation  standards.  Eligible  investments  will  include  civil  works \n(construction and rehabilitation according to government standards) for hospitals, rural health units, \nand  barangay  health  stations,  including  clean  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  appropriate  waste \n\n                                                 \n30 An LGU is defined as a municipality or a city. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f12 \n \n\nmanagement.  Credit  support  may  be  provided  to  LGUs  for  preparing  feasibility  studies, \narchitectural and engineering design, civil works supervision, and environmental risk mitigation. \n \n49. \nProcurement  of  Equipment.  LGUs  will  obtain  credit  to  procure  appropriate  medical  and \nnonmedical  equipment  for  health  care  facilities  to  meet  PHIC  accreditation.  The  list  of  eligible \nequipment for each level of health facility follows PHIC accreditation and DOH licensing standards. \nIn addition, credit may be provided for working capital to pay for a stock of supplies for the first half-\nyear,  procuring  medical  and  information  and  communication  technology  equipment,  and  for  an \ninitial stock of drugs and reagents to be used in an upgraded or newly built facility. Mobile clinics \nand  mobile  diagnostics  may  be  supported  with  adequate  justification.  Procurements  will  include \nstaff training in the maintenance and operation of procured equipment, its cost implications, and its \nappropriate use. \n \nDevelop  Integrated  Health  Care  Delivery  System.  Close  collaboration  and  partnership \n50. \nwill  be  required  between  DBP  and  DOH  to  assist  LGUs  to  develop  an  integrated  health  care \ndelivery  network.  Health  human  resource  development  may  include  training  and  career \ndevelopment  for  personnel  to  enhance  capacity.  In  addition,  DOH  will  provide  opportunities  for \ncapacity development to LGUs.  \n \n\n2. \n\nMore  Efficient  Health  Care  Delivery  Systems \nPartnership and Innovative Strategies \n\nthrough  Public\u2013Private \n\n \n51. \nThis output will support PPP and innovative strategies that aim to build an integrated health \ncare  delivery  system,  as  well  as  to  improve  efficiency,  quality,  and  cost-risk  sharing.  Both  public \nand  private  providers  will  be  given  access  to  credit  for  capital  investment  and/or  working  capital. \nPPP  options  may  include  health  care  facility  construction,  financing,  management,  and  services \ndelivery. Types of eligible subprojects are (i) outsourcing technical, medical (e.g., to cooperatives), \nand  ancillary  services;  (ii)  outsourcing  support  services  such  as  security,  housekeeping,  food \nservices, and laundry; (iii) contracting in the management of a public facility; (iv) contracting private \nproviders  to  deliver  health  services;  and  (v)  contracting  private  insurance  schemes  for  specific \npopulations.  Innovative  strategies  could  include  generic  drug  bulk  procurement  or  consignment, \nestablishment  of  telemedicine,  and  strengthening  management  systems.  The  Project  will  help \nLGUs conduct feasibility studies to examine potentially cost-effective options for consideration by \nthe  Health  Sector  Investment  Advisory  Committee  (see  para.  68).  The  Project  will  lend  to  about \nthree to four PPP subprojects. \n \n\nImproved Access to Small-Scale Private Providers \n\n3. \n \n52. \nThis  output  will  support  the  private  sector  to  help  address  such  public  health  priorities  as \naccess to quality maternal and child health services, as well as to complement the public system \nwhere  such  shortages  exist  as  for  medical  personnel  in  some  rural  areas.  DBP\u2019s  accredited \nfinancial  intermediaries  (MFIs,  cooperatives,  and  rural  and  thrift  banks)  will  access  credit  from \nDBP\u2019s  program  for  onlending  to  locations  underperforming  in  public  health  priorities.  DBP  will  be \nrelending project funds to about 20 of DBP\u2019s accredited financial intermediaries, which in turn will \nonlend  to  about  2,100  end  subprojects.  The  potential  subborrowers  are  about  1,800  midwifery \nclinics, 200 clinical and diagnostic facilities, 100 community drug stores (botika ng bayan), and 10 \ndrug distribution companies catering to rural municipalities. \n \n53. \nUpgrading  Private  Services.  Financial  intermediaries  will  access  credit  for  onlending  to \nprivate, small-scale health services providers for civil works to meet or improve PHIC accreditation \nstandards. Eligible  investments  will  include  civil  works  (construction  and  rehabilitation)  for  clinics, \ndrug stores, and diagnostic centers. Drug distribution companies catering to rural municipalities will \nbe eligible for investment in drug warehouses. Private sector, small-scale health services providers \n\n\f \n\n13 \n\nfor  product  development, \n\nwill have access to credit for procuring appropriate medical and nonmedical equipment for health \nfacilities to meet or improve PHIC  accreditation. The equipment list for each facility follows PHIC \naccreditation  and  DOH  licensing  standards  or  those  of  other  government  accreditation  agencies. \nCredit support will also be provided for working capital (including for procuring a stock of supplies \nfor the first half-year, medical and information and communication technology, and the initial stock \nof  drugs  and  reagents  to  be  used  in  the  upgraded  or  newly  built  facility).  Mobile  clinics,  mobile \ndiagnostics,  and  cold-chain  and  drug  distribution  vehicles  will  require  justification  under  the \nprovince-wide investment plans for health. The Project will ensure training of subborrowers for the \nprocured equipment\u2019s maintenance and operation, cost implications, and appropriate use.  \n \n54. \nSupporting  Financial  Intermediaries  to  Build  the  Health  Onlending  Product.  The \nProject will build capacity of DBP\u2019s accredited financial intermediaries for onlending to small-scale \nhealth  providers.  A  training  curriculum  will  be  developed  and  training  delivered  to  financial \nfinancial  sustainability  analysis,  and  subproject \nintermediaries \nappraisal. 31  The  financial  intermediaries,  in  turn,  will  train  potential  end-borrowers  in  financial \nliteracy, sustainable health care enterprise development (particularly in making their services more \naccessible  and  affordable  to  these  potential  end-borrowers),  and  compliance  with  environmental \nrisk  mitigation  (standards  set  and  recommended  by  DOH).  The  training  program  is  expected  to \ncover about 20 of DBP\u2019s accredited financial intermediaries.  \n \n55. \nEnhancing Midwives\u2019 Entrepreneurial and Financial Literacy. This important activity and \nsubcomponent  aims  to  address  structural  barriers  inhibiting  midwives  from  accessing  credit  to \nexpand  their  facilities  and  services.  The  subcomponent  will  support  midwives  to  be  accredited  by \nPHIC through (i) a review of PHIC standards, processes, and benefits packages for private midwives \naccreditation;  (ii)  health  literacy  training;  and  (iii)  business  development  and  banking  literacy.  The \nactivity  also  includes  legal  empowerment  on  women\u2019s  health  rights,  entitlements,  and  services. \nProposed activities will be implemented in three provinces and nine municipalities or cities and will be \nsupported  by  grant  assistance  not  exceeding  $400,000  equivalent  to  DBP  for  enhanced  midwives\u2019 \nentrepreneurial  and  financial  literacy  to  be  provided  by  the  Gender  and  Development  Cooperation \nFund.32 The subcomponent is summarized in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n\nEnhanced Institutional Capacity for Health Sector Lending \n\n4. \n \nThis  output  will  strengthen  the  capacity  of  DBP  in  dealing  with  health  sector  support  at \n56. \nnational and branch office levels. Given DBP\u2019s recent engagement in the health sector, its lending \npolicy framework for the health sector needs to be refined to support F1. Additionally, there is a need \nto develop implementation and operational guidelines for DBP\u2019s credit to the health sector. Since a \nnew  product  is  being  created  for  lending  to  MFIs  through  the  wholesale  window,  refinements  are \nneeded for appraising and monitoring performance of health sector lending. Engagement with LGUs \nand MFIs for health subprojects requires a long-term social marketing strategy. DBP has limited in-\nhouse  sectoral  capacity,  and,  although  steps  are  being  taken  to  train  staff  in  sector  knowledge, \ncontinuous  in-service  training  is  required  for  account  officers  who  market  the  product,  appraise \nsubprojects, and monitor implementation. Such capacity development is also needed among relevant \nMFIs. Since DBP has a complementary role under the LGU credit policy framework, the Project will \nwork closely with the various stakeholders (e.g., DOH and MDFO) to develop a strong capacity for \nrelending to LGUs for the health sector. The Project will strengthen the capacity of DBP\u2019s program \ndevelopment,  program  evaluation,  and  marketing  group  to  manage  and  monitor  health  sector \nprojects, including to form close collaboration with PHIC for setting up contracts with subborrowers. \n \n                                                 \n31 DBP\u2019s  ongoing  system  provides  technical  assistance  and  ensures  DBP  requirements  are  complied  with  by  potential \n\nsubborrowers through 13 business assistance centers located in state colleges and universities.  \n32 Contributors: the governments of Canada, Denmark, Ireland, and Norway. Administered by ADB. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n \n\n57. \nStrengthening  Capacity  for  Health  Sector  Lending.  The  Project,  in  close  coordination \nwith the Health Sector Investment Advisory Committee, will provide technical sector support to DBP \nto  (i)  refine  DBP\u2019s  program  sector  lending  framework,  (ii)  enhance  the  lending  strategy,  (iii) \nupgrade  the  appraisal  procedures  (incorporating  financial,  nonfinancial,  and  health  performance \nindicators), (iv) streamline assessment of sector needs given the development objectives, and (v) \nform  partnerships  with  the  government  as  well  as  with  private  agencies  and  associations.  The \nProject,  through  DBP\u2019s  budget,  will  provide  technical  support  to  ensure  that  an  appropriate \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  system  is  in  place  that  includes  financial  and  health  performance \nindicators. \n \n58. \nStrengthening Lending Product Performance. The Project will provide technical support \nto DBP\u2019s wholesale unit (central and branch offices) to design the health lending product offered to \nfinancial intermediaries. The Project will help strengthen the unit\u2019s capacity and knowledge base in \nthe health sector, in adapting microfinance technologies, and in setting performance benchmarks \nfor the financial intermediaries. Specifically, the technical support will assist the wholesale unit of \nDBP to (i) identify the loan products to be developed and promoted to the financial intermediaries, \nincluding  lending  parameters  and  promotion  strategy;  (ii)  identify  its  wholesale  financing  modality \nthrough mapping out geographic coverage of the financial intermediaries and its client orientation; \n(iii)  identify  appropriate  microfinance  technologies  (center  versus  individual  onlending)  to  support \naffordable  interest  rates  and  a  guarantee  system;  and  (iv) refine  performance  benchmarks  by \nincluding within them indicators related to health sector lending. \n \n59. \nStrengthening  Social  Marketing.  The  Project  will  provide  technical  support  to  DBP  in \ndeveloping  and  marketing  the  health  lending  product  to  decision  makers  and  subborrowers\u2014\nLGUs,  the  eligible  private  sector,  associations,  and  other  relevant  organizations.33 The  Project, \nunder the Program Development Department of DBP (and in close collaboration with other units at \nDBP  engaged  in  marketing),  will  develop  and  implement  an  active  5-year  social  marketing \nstrategy,  including  a  public  information  component  with  appropriate  information  on  the  health \nlending product and the project development objectives. The Project will strengthen capacity of the \nDBP\u2019s  wholesale  unit  and  the  regional  marketing  centers  in  preparing  curriculum,  training,  and \nmarketing  for  the  health  lending  product.  DBP\u2019s  central  and  regional  units  will  train  the  financial \nintermediaries in marketing the Project, in helping subborrowers prepare business proposals, and \nin assessing the health sector market for lending. The units will also monitor health and financial \nperformance  of  the  subborrowers.  DBP\u2019s  account  officers  in  the  branch  offices  will  be  trained  to \nmarket the health lending product to LGUs and private hospitals. The financial intermediaries (with \nDBP\u2019s  oversight)  will  market  the  product  to  private,  small-scale  health  providers  and  monitor  the \nonlending to them.  \n \n60. \nSupporting  PHIC  Contractual  Arrangements  with  Subborrowers.  The  project \nsubborrowers  will  each  develop  a  contractual  service  relationship  with  PHIC.  Marketing  of  the \nPHIC benefit packages and accreditation standards will be the responsibility of PHIC. The Project \nwill  coordinate  closely  with  PHIC  and  provide  support  to  the  contractual  agreement  developed \nbetween PHIC and the subborrowers at the time of the lending agreement between DBP and the \nsubborrower. The PHIC legal agreement will stipulate the service package (including beneficiaries, \nservices,  price,  and  reporting)  agreed  between  PHIC  and  the  subborrowers.  The  service \nperformance  will  be  monitored  and  reported  by  PHIC  to  DBP,  and  there  will  be  discussions  on \nactions to be taken in case of noncompliance with the contractual agreement. \n \n\n                                                 \n33 Two  other  mechanisms  have  been  identified  by  which  information  is  and  will  be  disseminated  to  the  potential \nsubborrowers: (i) DOH is already marketing F1 to the LGUs and providing them information on the various windows of \nfinancing; and (ii) PHIC is to market its benefit packages, which is already partially underway.   \n\n\f \n\n15 \n\nProject Investment and Financing Plan \n\nC. \n \n61. \nThe  project investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $63.36  million equivalent,  including  taxes  and \nduties of $5.50 million equivalent.

The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period \nof  6  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such other terms \nand  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement.  DBP  is  the  borrower.  The  loan  is  to  be \nguaranteed by the Republic of the Philippines under the terms of a guarantee agreement. DBP has \nprovided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending \nfacility under these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB.  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f16 \n \n\n63. \nThe  Gender  and  Development  Cooperation  Fund  will  provide  grant  cofinancing  up  to \n$400,000,  to  be  administered  by  ADB.  The  grant  will  finance  activities  for  enhancing  midwives\u2019 \nentrepreneurial and financial literacy (under output 3) during the first 2 project years. \n \n64. \nDBP is expected to allocate $1.94  million equivalent  and  will contribute  in cash and in kind \ntoward  (i) project  implementation  unit  staffing  and  operations,  including  computers  and  office \nequipment; (ii) monitoring and evaluation; (iii) experts recruited for output 4 or capacity development; \nand (iv) supporting the operations budget for the Health Sector Investment Advisory Committee.  \n \nEquity  is  expected  to  be  $11.02  million  equivalent  and  will  come  from  the  sub-  or  end-\n65. \nborrowers. For the private sector, at least 20% of subproject cost will be allocated as equity. For \nLGUs,  at  least  10%  of  subproject  cost  will  be  allocated  as  equity.  Equity  will  be  in  the  form  of \nworking  capital  (cash,  inventories,  and  receivables)  and  in  kind  (land,  buildings,  and  equipment \nexisting or to be acquired). \n \n66. \nDBP proposes to relend 100% of the loan proceeds to its potential subborrowers at market \ninterest  rates.  DBP  will  relend  to  final  borrowers  for  the  purposes  of  civil  works,  equipment,  and \nworking capital. DBP estimates its relending interest rates based on (i) ADB\u2019s lending rate and other \ncharges  to  DBP,  including  its  lending  spread;  (ii)  the  government  guarantee  fee  (quoted  as  1%); \n(iii) government foreign exchange risk cover (quoted as 3% as of November 2007); and (iv) DBP\u2019s \nspread, depending on credit rating or social pricing (1.0%\u20132.5%). DBP takes the risk of relending to \nsubborrowers  through  its  retail  relending  window  while  it  shares  the  risk  of  relending  to  final \nborrowers  with  financial  intermediaries  through  its  wholesale  relending  window.  Applications  and \ninformation for relending will be submitted to ADB no later than 5 years after the effective date. The \nfinancing arrangements and fund flow charts are in Appendix 7. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nRetail  lending  terms.  Retail  lending  for  collateralized  subprojects  from  $100,000  to \n$5 million equivalent is for LGUs and larger private ventures, including health providers, \nfoundations  and  health  maintenance  organizations,  although  some  small-scale \nsubborrowers may also qualify under this relending modality. DBP\u2019s lending terms are at \nmarket interest rates and the repayment is based on a subproject\u2019s projected cash flows, \nwith a repayment period of up to 15 years for civil works, up to 10 years for equipment, \nup to 5 years for working capital, and a grace period of up to 3 years. Amortization of \nprincipal and interest is on a quarterly basis. \nWholesale  lending  terms.  Wholesale  lending  is  for  accredited  financial  intermediaries \n(including MFIs, rural and thrift banks, cooperatives, and NGOs) who borrow for amounts \nranging from $100,000 to $500,000 equivalent on DBP\u2019s lending terms. Onlending rates \nof \nloan \nadministration  cost,  and  the  credit  risk.  This  also  guides  the  onlending  rate  for  the \nfinancial  intermediaries  to  the  subborrowers.  The  subborrowers  are  small-scale  health \nservices  providers,  such  as  midwives,  physicians,  municipal  drug  stores,  and  municipal \ndrug distribution companies, each borrowing in amounts ranging from $1,000 to less than \n$100,000 equivalent. The terms of onlending by financial intermediaries will also depend \non  the  amount  and  whether  or  not  end-borrowers  are  collateralized.  The  expected \nrepayment period is up to 10 years, with a grace period of 6 months to 2 years.  \n\nintermediaries  are  determined  considering  cost  of \n\nfinancial \n\nfunds, \n\nthe \n\n \nFree  Limit. The first three subloans financed under the loan and any subloans amounting \n67. \nto  more  than  $2  million  equivalent  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  review  and  approval  before  DBP \napproves the subloan. Subsequent subloans will not require ADB review and approval unless the \nsubloan  is  for  more  than  $2  million  equivalent.  For  subloans  below  or  equal  to  $2  million \nequivalent,  DBP  will  submit  to  ADB  a  statement  of  subloans  describing  the  subproject,  amount \napplied,  purpose  of  the  subloan,  eligibility  criteria,  plus  the  terms  and  condition.  Loan  review \nmissions will review selected subprojects during implementation. \n\n\f \n\n17 \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nD. \n \n68. \nProject  Organization  and  Management. DBP is the Executing Agency. It has established \nthe Health Sector Investment Advisory Committee, chaired by the senior vice president of DBP and \nwith  representatives  of  DBP,  DOH,  PHIC,  MDFO,  the  Department  of  Interior  and  Local \nGovernment  (DILG),  and  the  private  sector.  The  committee  will  (i)  ensure  compliance  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s and ADB\u2019s policies and regulations, (ii) provide project oversight and guidance, (iii) \noversee completion of DBP\u2019s health investment policy framework for lending in health, (iv) review \nand  decide  upon  lending  to  subprojects  that  deviate  from  meeting  subproject  eligibility,  (v) \ncoordinate  intersectorally  and  interdepartmentally,  (vi)  respond  to  challenges  faced  in  project \nimplementation,  and  (vii)  monitor  and  report  project  performance.  DBP  has  entered  into  an \nagreement with DILG, DOH, PHIC, and MDFO that outlines the objectives, procedures and areas \nfor cooperation, eligibility criteria for borrowers, eligible investment costs, preparation of feasibility \nand capacity development by DOH, flow of funds, and monitoring and evaluation. \n  \n69. \nDBP  has  set  up  a  project  management  office  (PMO)  under  its  Sustainable  Health  Care \nInvestment  Program  in  the  Program  Development  Department.  The  PMO  will  function  as  the \nplanning, coordinating, administering, and monitoring unit for project implementation. The PMO will \nalso  review  subproject  proposals,  monitor  their  progress,  and  provide  recommendations  and \nprogress updates. It includes a project director, a project manager, an assistant project manager and \ntwo  project  associates.  The  project  director  will  be  the  officer  responsible  for  overall  project \nexecution, finance, monitoring, and reporting to the committee and ADB. The project manager will be \nresponsible  for  project  implementation.  The  assistant  project  manager,  assisted  by  the  project \nassociates will run day-to-day PMO operations. The PMO will also recruit experts in health systems, \nhospital  civil  works,  hospital  environmental  and  waste  management,  monitoring  and  evaluation, \nfinancial management, and legal matters. Other DBP divisions at the central and regional levels will \nprovide necessary support for the effective implementation of the project. The project organizational \nstructure is in Appendix 8. \n \n70. \n2009 to 30 June 2015. The project implementation schedule is in Appendix 9. \n \n71. \nProcurement.  Procurement  of  goods  and  services  financed  under  the  loan  will  be  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Except \nwhere  stated  otherwise  in  the  procurement  plan,  procurement  undertaken  by  beneficiaries  under \nthe loan will be in accordance with the procedures for loans to financial intermediaries that allows \nfor procurement in accordance with established private sector or commercial practices. For other \ncases  identified  in  the  procurement  plan,  however,  national  competitive  bidding  or  international \ncompetitive  bidding  may  be  the  specified  form  of  procurement.  The  procedures  followed  for \nnational  competitive  bidding  will  be  those  set  forth  in  the  Government  Procurement  Reform  Act \n(Republic  Act  No.  9184)  with  clarifications  and  modifications  as  described  in  Appendix  10.  Civil \nWorks in excess of $5,000,000 equivalent and contracts for goods (in particular large single items \nor where large quantities of like goods can be grouped together and procured centrally) estimated \nto  cost  in  excess  of  $1,000,000  equivalent  will  be  procured  based  on  international  competitive \nbidding. The procurement plan is in Appendix 10. \n \n72. \nConsulting  Services. Consulting services financed by DBP will be engaged to implement \noutput 4. Consulting services will require 84 person-months of national consultants in the areas of \nhealth  systems,  social  marketing,  and  hospital  environmental  and  medical  waste  management. \nThe  terms  of  reference  for  project  management  and  monitoring  and  output  4  are  outlined  in \nSupplementary  Appendix  B.  ADB  will  assist  in  selecting  the  consultants.  Under  the  Gender  and \nDevelopment  Cooperation  Fund,  additional  consulting  services  will  be  engaged  to  support \nimplementing gender-relevant activities of output 3. This component will require 90 person-months \n\nImplementation  Period. The Project will be implemented over a 6-year period, from 1 July \n\n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n \n\nof  consulting  services,  to  be  sourced  through  a  national  health  NGO  in  the  areas  of  community \nhealth, training, and legal matters. The NGO will be chosen using quality- and cost-based selection \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). DBP will engage and administer the consultants.  \n \nAnticorruption Policy. DBP was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended \n73. \nto date) and policy relating to the  Combating of Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism \n(2003). Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB \nwill  require  DBP  to  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with  internal  procedures  and  controls  following \ninternational  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  corruption  or  money  laundering \nactivities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism  and  to  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from  engaging  in  such \nactivities. The investment documentation between ADB and DBP will further allow ADB to investigate \nany violation or potential violation of these undertakings.  \n \n74. \nIn addition to standard ADB requirements, the Project incorporates several other measures to \ndeter  corruption  and  increase  transparency.  The  Project,  through  DBP  resources,  will  (i)  build \ncapacity  within  DBP  to  understand  and  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  procedures  as  outlined  in  the  project \nadministration  manual;  and  (ii)  in  the  project  communities,  widely  publicize  the  existence  of  the \nintegrity  division  within  ADB\u2019s  Office  of  the  Auditor  General  as  a  point  of  contact  for  allegations  of \nfraud, corruption, and abuse in ADB-financed projects through, among others, DBP's project website \nand DBP's marketing and promotional materials. A project website will be developed, to the extent \npermitted  under  the  prevailing  regulations  relating  to  bank  confidentiality  in  the  Philippines,  to \ndisclose information about project matters, including procurement. The consultants will assist DBP in \nestablishing \nthe  website.  To  encourage  stakeholder  vigilance  as  well  as  ensure  greater \naccountability, a task force established within the PMO shall receive and resolve grievances or act \nupon stakeholders\u2019 reports of irregularities. The task force will (i) review and address grievances of \nproject stakeholders, service providers, or any  person responsible  for carrying out the Project;  and \n(ii) set threshold criteria and procedures for handling such grievances, for proactively responding to \nthem, and for informing stakeholders about the complaint mechanism. \n \n75. \nDisbursement Arrangements. The proceeds of the ADB loan and grant will be disbursed \naccording to  ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). For civil \nworks  using  international  competitive  bidding  procedures,  loan  funds  will  be  disbursed  through \nto  expedite  project \ndirect  payment.  To \nimplementation,  DBP  will  open  within  1  month  of  loan  effectiveness,  maintain,  and  manage  a \nproject  imprest  account.  The  maximum  amount  to  be  advanced  to  the  imprest  account  will  not \nexceed 6 months of estimated expenditures to be funded from the imprest account, or 10% of the \nloan amount, whichever is less. ADB's Statement of Expenditure (SOE) procedures will be used to \nreimburse,  liquidate,  and  replenish  the  imprest  account  for  eligible  expenditures  up  to  $100,000 \nequivalent per individual payment for the loan and $50,000 equivalent for the grant. \n \nfinancial \n76. \nmanagement systems and capacity were assessed. DBP exhibits strong financial performance and \nadheres  to  prudential  financial  management  practices:  (i)  DBP  has  a  risk-based  credit  pricing \npolicy that covers market risks, including those for interest rates and foreign exchange. DBP pricing \npolicy  for  the  Project  will  be  guided  by  the  Central  Bank  of  the  Philippines  (Bangko  Sentral  ng \nPilipinas [BSP]) internal credit risk rating system standards (adopted in 2004),34 and the individual \nsubborrower\u2019s  rating  will  determine  its  capacity  to  meet  debt  service  requirements.  (ii)  DBP \nadheres  to  BSP  stipulations  for  a  risk-based  operational  framework  on  capital  adequacy.  DBP's \nGovernance  Committee  ensures  adherence  to  its  policies  on  good  governance,  reviews \n                                                 \n34 With  BSP  Circular  439,  banks  are  required  to  rate  all  borrowers  with  assets  of  higher  than  the  P1.5  million  with  an \n\nFinancial  Management  Assessment.  As  part  of  due  diligence,  DBP\u2019s \n\nloan  proceeds  and \n\ntimely  release  of \n\nfacilitate \n\ninternal credit risk rating system duly approved.   \n\n\f \n\n19 \n\nincreased  deposit  mobilization,  and  adherence \n\ntransactions on credit and investment, and conducts periodic performance evaluation of the board \nand  its  committees.  (iii)  DBP\u2019s  growth  in  assets,  liabilities,  and  equity  reflect  its  focus  on  viable \ninvestments, \nto  BSP\u2019s  capital  adequacy \nrequirements,  while  its  performance  indicators  are  evident  of  its  above-industry  performance  on \ncapital  adequacy,  return  on  assets,  ratio  of  liquid  assets  to  deposits,  and  past-due  ratio.  DBP \nexpects  to  operate  viably  and  profitably  in  the  next  5  years  by  (i)  generating  more  low-cost  and \nloan-based  funding  sources  as  a  primary  source  of  funds  for  onlending  and  investments;  (ii) \nmaintaining  sufficient  liquid  assets  to  meet  withdrawals;  (iii)  preserving  the  balance  between  its \noperating  expenses,  gross  income,  and  total  assets;  and  (iv)  ensuring  that  its  capital  adequacy \nindicator meets the BSP requirement. A summary financial management assessment of DBP is in \nAppendix 11, and the due diligence on DBP is detailed in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n77. \nAccounting,  Auditing,  and  Reporting.  DBP  will  ensure  that  records,  accounts,  and \nrelated  financial  statements  are  adequately  maintained  according  to  accounting  standards  in \naccordance with BSP and likewise acceptable to ADB (Philippine Financial Accounting Standards, \nwhich  are  based  on  International  Financial  Accounting  Standards  and  benchmarks).  The  reports \nshould  identify  goods  and  services  financed  from  loan  proceeds.  DBP  will  maintain  separate \nproject  accounts  and  will  prepare  related  financial  statements,  including  records  for  the  imprest \naccount and SOE. The Commission on Audit will audit these, and certified copies of such audited \naccounts and financial statements will be submitted to ADB in English not later than 6 months after \nthe fiscal year to which the report relates. A separate audit opinion on use of the imprest account \nand SOE procedures should be included in the audit report. Delay in submitting audited financial \nstatements of acceptable quality may result in ADB\u2019s suspending loan disbursements. \n \n78. \nDBP  will  provide  ADB  with  (i)  a  quarterly  report  on  the  operational  and  financial \nperformance  of  project  implementation  within  2  months  after  the  end  of  each  quarter;  (ii)  a \nprojected  annual  disbursement  schedule,  broken  down  quarterly  by  15  December  each  year;  (iii) \nan  updated  3-year  financial  projection  for  DBP  by  31  March  each  year;  and  (iv)  a  project \ncompletion  report  within  3  months  of  project  completion  detailing  implementation,  costs,  loan \nrecoveries, financial conditions of MFIs, an evaluation of the Project\u2019s impact on the beneficiaries, \nand other details that ADB may consider necessary. \n \n79. \nDBP  will  submit  reports  on  the  implementation  of  project-funded  activities  within  30  days \nafter the end of each quarter. The quarterly reports will include progress made against established \ntargets  on  the  lending  portfolio;  achievement  of  milestones;  inputs  and  outputs  under  the  design \nand monitoring framework, with data, graphs and interpretations; problems encountered during the \nquarter;  steps  taken  and  proposed  to  resolve  problems;  compliance  with  loan  covenants;  and \nproject activities to be undertaken during the next quarter. All reports will be submitted in English.  \n \n80. \nEnvironment.  An  environmental  management  assessment  was  carried  out  on  DBP\u2019s \nenvironmental  management  system  (EMS)  and  on  the  environmental  assessment  procedures  and \nguidelines as applied to the Project. DBP has a satisfactory EMS with appropriate staff capacity, and \nits  environmental  policy  and  environmental  assessment  procedures  are  of  the  same  standard  as \nADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). No additional measures are necessary to ensure compliance. As \nDBP\u2019s account officers\u2019 experience with environmental assessment is uneven, DBP will prepare an \nupgraded  training  program  to  ensure  performance  of  uniform  quality.  ADB  will  validate  DBP\u2019s \ncapacity  to  ensure  full  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  by  reviewing  the  initial \nenvironmental  examination  for  the  first  two  category  B  subprojects  prior  to  DBP  approval.  Eligible \ninvestments under the Project will be category B or C. No category A subproject is anticipated, and \ncategory  A  proposals  will be screened out. Impacts of category  B subprojects can  be  mitigated by \nproperly  implementing  the  EMS  of  the  financial  intermediary  and  the  government,  and  additional \nprocedures  developed  for  the  specific  subproject,  and  agreed  with  ADB  to  ensure  environmental \n\n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n \n\nresettlement \n\nInvoluntary  Resettlement.  An \n\nassessments  are  equivalent  to  ADB  requirements.  DBP  will  submit  a  report  on  the  environmental \nstatus  of  the  subprojects  every  6  months  with  information  about  environmental  categories,  details, \nand  potential  or  resolved  issues  for  subprojects  under  assessment,  approved,  and  under \nimplementation.  The  environmental  assessment  of  financial  intermediation  loans  and  equity \ninvestments is in Supplementary Appendix D.  \n \n81. \nframework  with  detailed \ninvoluntary \nprocedures and involuntary resettlement checklist has been prepared by DBP to screen proposed \nsubprojects for involuntary resettlement impact (Supplementary Appendix E). Every LGU and retail \nunit  subloan  proposal  will  be  screened  to  ensure  all  subloan  proposals  in  project  sites  with  titles \ninvolving  liens  and  encumbrances  and  informal  settlement  issues,  including  loss  of  shelter, \nlivelihood,  or  access  to  resources,  are  identified  and  denied.  A  subloan  proposal  screening \nchecklist  for  all  public  and  private  subloan  proposals  has  been  established  based  on  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  to  flag  potential  involuntary  resettlement  impacts.  In \naddition to the screening checklist, DBP will physically verify that all subproject sites involved in the \npublic  and  private  subloan  proposals  submitted  for  credit  approval  are  free  from  liens  and \nencumbrances, that they have no informal settler impacts, and that no eviction of informal dwellers \nhas been undertaken during the past 12 months prior to loan application. \n \n82. \nIndigenous Population. An indigenous peoples development framework (IPDF) has been \nprepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998)  and  the  Philippine \nRepublic  Indigenous  Peoples  Rights  Act  of  1997.  It  states  how  compliance  will  be  achieved, \nincluding  the  participation  strategy,  grievance  procedures,  and  institutional  implementation \narrangements. For each type of eligible investment, the IPDF describes the DBP subloan approval \nprocess,  how  the  proposals  will  be  screened,  persons  responsible,  documentation  required, \nimplementation  monitoring  arrangements,  and  reporting  to  ADB.  The  National  Commission  on \nIndigenous  Peoples  (NCIP)  regional  offices  will  provide  DBP  the  locations  of  ancestral  domains \nand ancestral lands that have been approved or are under consideration. For project sites that are \nin  approved  ancestral  areas  or  those  under  consideration,  the  IPDF  identifies  the  types  of \ninvestments  that  may  require  free,  prior,  and  informed  consent  (FPIC)  or  an  indigenous  people \ncommunity  action,  as  well  as  the  actions  to  be  undertaken  by  the  proponent  prior  to  DBP \nconsideration  for  credit  approval.  Few  subloans  requiring  FPIC  or  community  action  are \nanticipated,  as  most  public  investments  are  expected  to  restore  or  achieve  the  service  levels \nexpected  for  existing  facilities.  Most  proponents  of  private  sector  investments  are  likely  to  be \nindigenous  peoples  or  non-indigenous  people  residents  rather  than  non-indigenous  people \nmigrants. The IPDF is in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \nProject  Performance  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  The  Project\u2019s  design  and  monitoring \n83. \nframework  provides  the  needed  indicators.  DBP  will  oversee  project  performance  and  submit \nquarterly reports to the Health Sector Investment Advisory Committee and ADB. To assess impact \nand outcome, DBP will collect information on the use of health facilities including indigent, women, \nand  children.  All  subprojects  will  require  baseline  and  end-of-project  health  services  surveys  to \nassess services improvement in terms of use, quality, affordability, and patient satisfaction. Surveys \nwill  be  conducted  jointly  with  subproject  feasibility  studies  prior  to  investment.  In  addition,  DBP,  as \nguided  by  the  committee  and  ADB,  will  conduct  selective  qualitative  studies  to  obtain  the  views  of \nstakeholders  on  the  services  and  related  matters.  DBP  will  be  responsible  for  conducting  the \nsurveys, but it may contract this out to a suitable firm or NGO. \n \nProject Review. DBP and ADB will jointly review project progress at least twice a year. They \n84. \nwill undertake a midterm review during the third year of implementation. The midterm review will (i) \nreview the scope, design, implementation arrangements, and other relevant issues in light of F1 and \ndevelopment objectives, as well as the Project\u2019s health policy framework; (ii) identify changes since \n\n\f \n\n \n\n21 \n\ntheir \n\nimpacts  on \n\nthe  time  of  appraisal  relating  to  sector  issues  and  resource  management  and  allocation,  then \nimplementation  and  sustainability;  (iii) review \nreassess \nimplementation performance of all outputs; (iv) review progress in achieving the Project\u2019s measurable \nobjectives; (v) identify problems and constraints; and (vi) formulate appropriate recommendations for \ncorrective  action.  The  midterm  review  will  also  assess  the  status  of  procurement,  construction  or \nrenovation, and equipment under each category of the eligible subprojects.  \n \n\nfuture  subproject \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \nADB will provide DBP a TA grant for public\u2013private partnership in health services to support \n85. \nthe  subborrowers,  including  LGUs  and  private  providers,  in  enhancing  modalities  for  PPP, \nincluding (i) innovative strategies to improve efficiency, access, and quality of services; (ii) assisting \nsmall-scale health  providers\u2019  access  to  credit  to  support  health-related  MDGs;  and  (iii)  mobilizing \nprivate resources for achieving MDGs (Appendix 12). \n \n86. \nImpact  and  Outcome.  The  TA\u2019s  impact  is  to  help  improve  the  maternal  and  child  health \nstatus by 2015 in the subproject sites using PPP. The outcome of the Project will be tested PPP \nmodalities  that  will  have  demonstrated  potential  to  increase  the  use  of  maternal  and  child  health \ncare and referral services in the subproject sites with PPP.  \n   \n87.  Methodology and Key Activities. The TA will have three outputs.  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nOutput  1. Develop and promote PPP modalities in the health sector by conducting \nan  assessment;  assisting  to  prepare  PPP  policy,  regulations,  guidelines,  and  a \nhandbook; and identifying preliminary PPP health subprojects for potential support.  \nOutput  2.  Develop  incentives  and  operational  strategies  to  encourage  small-scale \nhealth  providers  in  attaining  PHIC  and/or  other  accreditation  for  health  services  in \nrural  and  underserved  areas  that  address  health-related  MDGs  by  identifying  and \nproviding  incentives  for  them  to  work  in  such  areas,  and  develop  partnerships  to \nscale up initiatives with project support.  \nOutput  3.  Develop  and  initiate  the  contracting  modality  for  health  services  to \nimprove quality and efficiency of health services. This initiative has already started \nunder ADB-supported TA.35  \n\n \nCost and Financing. The TA is estimated to cost $1,100,000, of which $1,000,000 will be \n88. \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. DBP \nwill  finance  the  remaining  $100,000  equivalent  in  kind,  including  office  accommodation  costs; \ntransport;  utilities;  seminar  room  space;  remuneration  of  counterpart  staff;  plus  provision  of  data, \nreports, and other relevant documents.    \n \n89. \nImplementation  Arrangements.  The  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA  is  DBP  (Program \nDevelopment  Department),  and  the  implementing  agencies  are  DOH  (Bureau  of  International \nHealth Cooperation) and PHIC (Health Finance Policy and Service Sector). The TA will be guided \nand monitored by the Health Sector Investment Advisory Committee.    \n \n90. \nADB  will  recruit  a  team  of  international  and  national  consultants  to  provide  specialized \nservices totaling 80 person-months (30 international and 50 national) in the areas of public\u2013private \npartnership  in  health;  finance;  legal  matters;  health  systems;  procurement;  and  training.  ADB  will \nengage the consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants using quality- \nand cost-based selection, with quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20 and simplified technical proposals.  \n \n\n                                                 \n35 ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the Republic of the Philippines for the Support for Health Sector Reform. Manila \n\n(TA 4647-PHI). \n\n \n\n\f22 \n \n\n91. \nThe  TA  will  be  implemented  over  18  months,  commencing  in  July  2009  and  ending  by \nDecember 2010. The TA consultants will submit (i) an inception report within 1 month of TA start-\nup;  (ii)  an  interim  report  within  9  months  of  TA  implementation;  and  (iii)  a  final  report  within \n24 months  of  TA  implementation.  DBP,  DOH,  PHIC,  ADB,  and  the  consultants\u2019  team  will  hold \ntripartite  meetings  during  inception,  midterm,  and  on  completion  of  the  TA.  Key  findings  and \noutputs of the TA will be disseminated through workshops.  \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nExpected Benefits and Impacts \n\n \nA.  \n \n92. \nHealth  Benefits.  The  Project  is  designed  to  address  MDGs  by  targeting  the  poor,  in \nparticular  women  and  children  with  poor  health  indicators.  It  specifically  addresses  gaps  in  basic \nhealth  care,  including  maternal  and  child  health  care,  communicable  disease  control,  diagnostic \nservices, and referral services. The Project promotes the use of PHIC-accredited health facilities, \nthereby  promoting  quality  standards  of  services,  and  it  supports  partnership  between  the  public \nand private sectors to address gaps in health care, such as staff shortages for maternal care.  \n \n93. \nSocial,  Gender,  and  Poverty  Benefits. The Project is designed to result in major social, \ngender, and poverty benefits with multiple impacts. A larger proportion of the beneficiaries will be \nthe poor, women, and children. They will benefit from upgrading LGU health facilities and also from \nfilling gaps in service delivery through PPP and support for small providers close to communities. \nOversight  arrangements,  capacity  development,  provincial  plans,  eligibility  criteria,  and  targeted \nfunding for assisting small providers will help to ensure that suitable subprojects are selected that \nyield maximum benefit for these vulnerable groups. The Project also supports PHIC accreditation \nof  health  providers  close  to  the  underserved  population.  Finally,  the  Project  provides  improved \naccess to credit and opportunities for improved earnings for small-scale health providers, who are \noften female (midwives, drug store owners). The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is \nin Appendix 13, and the gender and development action plan is in Appendix 14. \n \n94. \nFinancial Protection of the Poor. The poor will benefit (i) through reduced costs for care \nand  transport,  plus  greater  opportunity  to  receive  care,  as  facilities  become  more  accessible;  (ii) \nfrom increased subsidy from PHIC-accredited health facilities, including generic drug outlets, and \n(iii) indirectly, through better health resulting in less income erosion and increased productivity. \n \n95. \nEconomic Benefits. The subprojects will address (i) externalities, such as through primary \nhealth care; (ii) merit goods, such as through direct impact on woman and child health, reduction in \nunnecessary use of hospitals, and better information to consumers; (iii) uncertainty, such as due to \ncomplications during childbirth; and (iv) inequity in access. The Project will promote both technical \n(e.g.,  access  to  affordable  generic  drugs)  and  allocative  (e.g.,  access  to  cost-effective \ninterventions) efficiencies. It is expected to have a significant impact on the poor, particularly women \nand  children.  A  cost-effectiveness  analysis  was  undertaken  on  two  subgroups  (i)  infants  and \nparticularly neonates; and (ii) women of childbearing age, particularly those who are pregnant. The \nassumption  is  that  as  access  to  credit  increases,  and  health  care  providers  are  accredited,  more \nwomen  will  deliver  under  health  care  providers.  This  will  result  in  healthier  women  and  newborns. \nThe  Project  could  therefore  essentially bring  down  maternal and neonatal deaths in the subproject \nsites. While the analysis focuses on infant and maternal deaths, many of these interventions should \nalso  reduce  infant  and  maternal  distress  and  morbidity.  Consequently,  total  health  benefits,  as \nmeasured  by  a  composite  measure  such  as  disability-adjusted  life  years,  would  be  significantly \ngreater.  In  the  15th  year  from  the  start  of  the  investment,  the  Project  will  maximize  net  benefits \naccruing  to  the  country  (positive  net  present  value)  and  the  internal  rate  of  return  will  surpass  the \ndiscount rate. An economic and financial sustainability analysis is in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n\n\f \n\n23 \n\nAssumptions, Risks, and Mitigating Measures \n\n96. \nFinancial  Sustainability. Analyses were undertaken to assess the financial sustainability of \nsubprojects, and these were broken down to (i) retail lending subprojects, and (ii) wholesale lending \nsubprojects.  An  actual  case  of  a  LGU  provincial  hospital  expansion  was  taken  from  one  province. \nAdditionally,  for  wholesale  lending,  actual  costs  and  estimated  incomes  were  considered  for  small-\nscale health providers, such as midwives, obstetricians, and drug stores. The financial sustainability \nanalysis was determined by using weighted average cost of capital and financial internal rate of return \nestimates  for  each  subproject,  and  composite  financial  internal  rate  of  return  for  the  Project.  The \nanalysis suggests that the Project is generally financially sustainable. However, LGU hospitals, which \nare not income-generating entities and generally rely on LGUs cross-subsidization, under the current \nbudget scenario are dependent on PHIC reimbursements for sustained operation expenditures. There \nis risk of increase in balance billing, as hospitals may try to increase user fees (charged to patients) in \nresponse  to  their  increased  capital  investment.  The  subprojects  will  mitigate  this  risk  by  contracting \nwith PHIC, which stipulates hospital charges for its beneficiaries. Most small-scale subprojects were \nfinancially  sustainable,  although  the  sensitivity  analysis  suggests  that  they  could  be  vulnerable  if \nrevenue generation is delayed.  \n \nB.  \n \n97. \nKey  assumptions  for  successful  implementation  are  (i)  adequate  recurrent  and  capital \nbudgets by Government and LGUs for health-related programs, (ii) enrollment of indigents and the \npoor  into  PHIC,  (iii)  provider  access  to  a  comprehensive  PHIC  benefits  and  reimbursements \npackage, and (iv) LGUs and private health entrepreneurs are willing and able to borrow at DBP\u2019s \n(or financial intermediaries\u2019) terms. Some risks and mitigating measures are given below. \n \n98. \nDelayed Implementation of F1. To date, DOH has mobilized 37 out of the 78 provinces to \nachieve F1 and it plans to cover all by 2010. If the mobilization of LGUs or the preparation of LGU \ninvestments  is  delayed,  project  disbursement  will  be  delayed.  To  mitigate  this  risk,  DBP,  in \npartnership  with  DOH  and  DILG,  will  need  to  ensure  the  timely  mobilization  of  LGUs  and \npreparation of the subproject feasibility studies.   \n \n99. \nLimited Experience in the Health Sector. While DBP has established a new credit facility \nfor health development projects, it has limited experience in the health sector. Its experience has \nprimarily been in large-scale private projects, where it was not necessary to provide TA or whose \nperformance  could  easily  be  monitored.  DBP  is  well-versed  with  financial  management  and \nassessing  creditworthiness.  DBP  will  also  need  to  market  its  new  lending  product  to  generate \ndemand among LGU and small-scale subborrowers. DBP will obtain expertise in the health sector \nand  form  partnerships  with  other  key  agencies\u2014DOH  and  MDFO  in  particular.  Under  the  LGU \ncredit policy framework, DBP and MDFO form an alliance in lending to LGUs.  \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n100. \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. The DBP will ensure that:  \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  the  DBP  have  given  the \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nDBP will provide counterpart funds for project implementation on time and will prepare \nannual plans for subproject investment and for loan disbursement. Every year, DBP \nwill submit the annual plan to ADB for endorsement not later than the first quarter of \nthe year; \nDBP will ensure that it maintains (a) a capital adequacy ratio of 10% or above, (b) a \nminimum  return  on  average  total  assets  of  0.5%,  and  (c)  a  minimum  liquid  assets \n\n \n\n \n\n\f24 \n \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nratio36 of 25%;  \nDBP  will  conduct  financial  due  diligence  on  the  subborrowers  prior  to  subloan \napproval,  monitoring  during  subproject  implementation  and  evaluation  after  the \nsubproject is completed;  \nDBP  will  ensure  a  baseline  study  as  part  of  the  feasibility  study  of  each  subproject. \nThe  indicators  will  include  those  from  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  and \naddress issues of equity. The study will be conducted during and no later than the first \n3  months  of  subproject  approval.  DBP  will  also  conduct  an  exit  study  for  each \nsubproject  and  report  the  same  to  ADB  within  6  months  of  the  subproject\u2019s \ncompletion.  DBP's  Program  Evaluation  Department  will  conduct  a  beneficiaries\u2019 \nimpact  assessment  study.  In  furtherance  to  these,  DBP  will  ensure  that  (a)  the \nappropriate  budget  will  be  allocated  by  DBP  and/or  its  subborrowers  to  support  the \nstudies; (b)  the studies  will be conducted in accordance  with the  terms  of  reference \ndeveloped  for  such  purpose;  and  (c)  the  results  and  findings  of  the  studies  will  be \nshared with ADB;  \nDBP  will  ensure  that  subloan  proposals  requiring  an  FPIC  are  monitored  to  ensure \ncompliance  with  the  project  IPDF,  Republic  Act  No.  8371  on  Indigenous  Peoples \nRights (1997), and the NCIP Administrative Order 1/2006 on the FPIC guidelines of \n2006. When an FPIC is required, DBP will not approve any subloan or subproject until \nthe  NCIP  issues  a  Certificate  of  Precondition  attesting  that  all  FPIC  guideline \nrequirements  have  been  met.  Information  on  geographic  location  of  existing  and \nproposed  Indigenous  People's  Ancestral  Domains  and  Lands  used  for  FPIC \ncompliance requirements will be updated regularly, and periodic monitoring of subloan \nimplementation will be undertaken to ensure FPIC agreements are met; \n\n(vi)  Within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  DBP  will  establish  a  website  to  disclose \nproject-related information. To the extent permitted under the Government\u2019s banking \nregulation  relevant  to  confidentiality,  DBP  will  disclose  all  relevant  information  with \nregard to the project activities, including the subprojects and the stakeholders; \n(vii)  Within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  DBP  will  design  and  approve  a  grievance \nredress  mechanism,  acceptable  to  ADB,  and  establish  a  task  force  at  the  PMO. \nThe  task  force  shall  receive  and  resolve  complaints  and  grievances  or  act  upon \nreports  from  stakeholders  on  misuse  of  funds  and  other  irregularities,  including \ngrievances  caused  by  resettlement  and  environmental  issues.  The  task  force  will \n(a) make public the existence of this grievance redress mechanism through a public \nawareness  campaign  in  every  area  where  there  is  a  subproject;  (b)  review  and \naddress  grievances  of  stakeholders  in  relation  to  the  Project,  any  of  the  service \nproviders, or any person responsible for carrying out any aspect of the Project; and \n(c) proactively and constructively respond to them;  \n\n(viii)  DBP  will  ensure  that  subborrowers  and  subprojects  will  be  selected  in  accordance \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\nwith the agreed eligibility criteria, as set out in Appendix 5; \nDBP  will  ensure  that  the  activities  included  in  the  Gender  and  Development \nCooperation Fund-financed component for enhancing midwives\u2019 entrepreneurial and \nfinancial  literacy  are  carried  out  during  the  first  2  years  of  project  implementation. \nDBP will closely monitor, and the progress will be reported in the quarterly reports to \nADB;  \nDBP  will  (a)  ensure  that  it  will  not  approve  any  subloan  proposal  that  involves \ninvoluntary  resettlement  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy \n(1995);  (b)  ensure  and  certify  compliance  with  the  involuntary  resettlement \n\n                                                 \n36 Cash on hand; checks and other cash items due from the central bank and other banks; marketable securities, trading \naccount securities, government securities with maturities of less than 1 year or more than 1 year, which can be traded \nin the secondary market; interbank loans receivable with a maturity of less than 1 year to total deposits. \n\n\f \n\n25 \n\nframework  before  a  subloan  credit  application  will  be  approved;  (c)  carry  out  due \ndiligence on each public sector subloan proposal so approval will only be granted to \nthose  with  clear  property  titles,  without  encumbrances  and  free  of  informal  settler \nissues; and \nDBP will comply with its EMS, the Government\u2019s environmental laws and regulations \nand  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002).  If  there  is  any  discrepancy  between  DBP\u2019s \nEMS, the Government\u2019s laws and regulations and ADB's Environment Policy, ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy requirements will apply. Construction and operation of all health \nfacilities  to  be  financed  under  the  subloans  will  comply  with  DBP\u2019s  EMS,  the \nGovernment\u2019s  environmental  laws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy. \nDBP will ensure that only category B and C subprojects will be eligible for financing. \nDBP  will  not  finance  category  A  subprojects.

This  appendix  summarizes  the  sector,  what  can  be  done  to \nclose the gap, and the role of the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP).  \n \n2. \nFilipinos\u2019  life  expectancy  at  birth  is  71  years  (2005)  on  average,  but  remote  provinces \nhave  much  lower  life  expectancies. 1 The  country  has  a  mixed  status  on  the  health-related \nMDGs. The Philippines National Statistics Office reports that the infant mortality rate (IMR) had \nsteadily  declined  to  31  infant  deaths  per  1,000  live  births  by  2004,  and  the  maternal  mortality \nratio (MMR) was at 200 per 100,000 live births in 2000 and 108 in 2003. Both IMR and MMR \nare higher in the Visayas and Mindanao compared to Luzon. The MMR is much higher in Bicol, \nLeyte,  and  Samar.  Maternal  and  child  deaths  in  remote  areas  are  likely  to  be  underreported. \nThe  IMR  for  children  whose  mothers  have  no  education  is  65  deaths  per  1,000  live  births \ncompared  with  15  deaths  per  1,000  live  births  for  children  whose  mothers  have  college  or \nhigher education. Although the MMR also shows major disparities by income status, it remains \nrelatively high, too, among the more affluent, thus demonstrating that this is not just a matter of \naccess and affordability but also one of quality of care.   \n \n3. \nNoncommunicable  diseases  (like  asthma,  heart  diseases,  hypertension,  and  cancers) \nhave  been  increasing,  causing  early  morbidity,  disability,  and  mortality  as  well  as  a  drain  on \nhealth  care  resources.  Long  existent  and  treatable  infectious  diseases  are  reemerging  and \nbecoming  more  difficult  to  treat  because  of  increased  vulnerability  and  drug  resistance.  New \ninfectious  diseases  are  emerging  (human  immunodeficiency  virus  [HIV],  severe  acute \nrespiratory  syndrome,  avian  influenza).  HIV  prevalence  has  increased  slowly,  although  it \nremains concentrated in high risk groups. \n \n4. \nImmediate attention is required to the slow progress in attaining the health-related MDGs \nand  to  improve  prevention  and  early  curing  of  incapacitating  diseases.  The  large  regional \ndisparities point to the need for giving specific attention to deprived regions and to the deprived \nand vulnerable categories of the population (in rural areas and urban slums).  \n \nThe Philippines has a dual health system of largely tax-financed public health services at \n5. \nnational and local levels plus an extensive for-profit and nonprofit private sector that is largely \nfinanced  from  user  fees.  Social  health  insurance  has  been  introduced  and  is  being  expanded \ngradually as a way of pooling risk, establishing  accreditation, and contracting services. This is \nexpected  to  improve  access  for  the  poor  and  vulnerable,  although  the  range  of  reimbursable \nservices and access to quality services remain limited.       \n \n6. \nPublic  health  services  are  provided  by  the  Department  of  Health  (DOH),  local \ngovernment units (LGUs), and other agencies (e.g., the military). DOH provides national health \npolicies, plans, standards, and guidelines. DOH at central level comprises the Secretary\u2019s office \nand five clusters for sector management, internal management, regulation, external affairs, and \nlocal  health  programs.  DOH  has  three  zonal  health  offices  headed  by  undersecretaries  and \nmandated  to  implement  the  national  health  objectives,  the  Local  Government  Code,  and  the \nhealth  sector  reform  agenda.  It  operates  16  centers  for  health  development\u2014one  in  each \n                                                 \n1 Department of Health. 2005. National Objectives of Health. Manila.  \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n31 \n\nregion\u2014and  supports  provincial  health  offices  through  provincial  health  teams.  DOH  also \noperates about 70 national, regional, and specialty hospitals.  \n \n7. \nThe  Philippines  Health  Insurance  Corporation  (PHIC)  is  a  government-owned  and \ncontrolled  corporation  attached  to  DOH.  It  is  mandated  to  administer  the  national  health \ninsurance  program  and  ensure  that  Filipinos  have  affordable  access  to  health  services.  The \nprivate  health  sector  includes  clinics,  hospitals,  insurance  companies,  manufacturers  of  drugs \nand equipment, training institutes, and other entities.  \n \n8. \nLGUs finance and operate provincial and district hospitals, while municipal governments \nrun  rural  health  units  (RHUs)  and  barangay  health  stations  (BHSs).  Every  LGU  has  a  health \nboard  to  advise  the  executive  on  health  care  system  development.  In  2002,  there  were  about \n661 government hospitals (up from 413 in 1980) and 1,077 private hospitals (down from 1,194 \nin 1980). The bed capacity declined in this period from 18.2 to 10.7 beds per 10,000 people. As \nwould be expected, most hospital beds are in the National Capital Region and the least in the \nAutonomous  Region  in  Muslim  Mindanao.  An  RHU  serves  about  40,000  people  and  a  BHS \nabout  5,000.  The  number  of  RHUs  declined  from  1,962  in  1986  to  1,879  in  2001,  and  the \nnumber of BHSs increased from 9,184 in 1988 to 15,343 in 2002.                   \n \n9. \nIn 2002, LGUs employed 3,021 doctors, 1,871 dentists, 4,720 nurses, 16,534 midwives, \n3,271  engineers,  1,505  medical  technologists,  and  other  staff.  There  were  also  195,928 \nbarangay health volunteers and 54,557 birth attendants (footnote 1). The Philippines is among \nthe biggest exporters of nurses and doctors, leading to staff shortages and quality constraints. \nFilipinos  have  high  per  capita  spending  on  medicines,  totaling  about  half  of  total  spending  on \nhealth care. The market is dominated by expensive branded medicines.  \n \n10.  While  the  Philippines  health  care  system  is  generally  extensive,  access  to  health \nservices\u2014particularly  by  the  poor\u2014is  hampered  by  high  costs  plus  physical  and  sociocultural \nbarriers.  The  health  care  system  has  gone  through  several  reforms,  including  the  adoption  of \nprimary health care approach in 1979, integration of public health and hospital services in 1983, \ndevolution of health services to LGUs in 1991, and enactment of the National Health Insurance \nAct in 1995 that included the nonformal sector. In 1999, DOH launched the health sector reform \nagenda to improve the delivery, regulation, and financing of the sector.  \n \n11. \nFourmula  One  for  Health  (F1)  is  DOH\u2019s  implementation  framework  for  health  sector \nreforms  for  the  medium  term  covering  2005\u20132010.  It  is  directed  to  achieving  better  health \noutcomes, a more responsive health care system, and more equitable health care financing in a \nmanner that is felt and appreciated by Filipinos, especially the poor. This is consistent with the \nhealth  system  goals  identified  by  the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO),  the  MDGs,  and  the \nmedium-term Philippine development plan. FI has four specific medium-term objectives:  \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nsecure more, better, and sustained financing for health;  \nassure the quality and affordability of health goods and services;  \nensure access to and availability of essential and basic health packages; and \nimprove performance of the health system.  \n\n \n12. \nF1 is designed to implement critical health interventions as a single package, backed by \neffective  management  infrastructure  and  financing  arrangements.  It  engages  the  entire  health \nsector,  including  the  public  and  private  sectors,  national  agencies  and  LGUs,  external \ndevelopment agencies, and civil society to get involved in the implementation of health reforms.  \n \n \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\nMain Issues \n\nB. \n \n13. \nThe  current  system  is  fragmented  in  its  organization  and  management,  in  its  services, \nand in financing. In effect, a two-tier system exists: the private sector for the rich (mainly located \nin the cities) and the public system for the poor. Health system funding shows a problematic mix \nthat  is  part  national  health  system,  part  social  health  insurance  system,  and  combined  with  a \nhalfway  devolved  system  providing  mandates  for  regulating  and  financing  the  sector  to  DOH, \nLGUs,  and  PHIC  (all  of  which  deal  with  the  same  health  service  providers,  both  publicly  and \nprivately owned). The public system lacks funding, instruments for stewardship and regulatory \ncapacity,  enforcement  and  effective  use  of  existing  regulation,  and  incentives  for  health  care \nproviders.  There  are  major  challenges\u2014but  also  opportunities\u2014in \nimproving  access, \naffordability, quality, management, and financing of health services.  \n \n\n1. \n\nAccess  \n\n14. \nA 2003 survey identified problems of financial, geographic, and cultural access to health \ncare.2 Better  health  services  were  characterized  as  follows  (i)  health  professional  are  reliable, \n(ii) drugs and diagnostic equipment are available, and (iii) the building is clean and people are \ntreated with dignity. People equate good staff attitude and cleanliness with quality care, which is \noften seen as lacking in public health services. Availability of free or inexpensive (generic) drugs \nis  appreciated  but  patients  have  more  confidence  in  branded  drugs. Demand  for  preventive \nhealth  care  is  low. Use  of  traditional  healers  is still  widely  practiced  before  and  after  visiting  a \nmodern clinic.  \n \nAccording to the same survey (footnote 2), facility-based deliveries increased from 34% \n15. \nin the 5 years preceding 1998 to 38% in the 5 years preceding the 2003 survey. Sixty percent of \nbirths  in  the  5  years  before  the  2003  survey  were  assisted by  health  professionals (34%  by  a \ndoctor and 26% by a midwife or a nurse) compared with 56% in the 5 years preceding the 1998 \nsurvey (footnote 2). WHO recommends that every delivery should take place in a well-equipped \nhealth  facility,  and  be  led  by  a  health  professional.  Regional  variation  ranges  from  fewer  than \n40%  of  births  assisted  by  health  professionals  in  Bicol,  Caraga,  and  Autonomous  Region  in \nMuslim Mindanao to over 80% in Central Luzon and the National Capital Region. Importantly, in \n38% of cases of maternal death there was no medical attendance.  \n \n16. \nThe use of services is slightly higher for public health services and quite evenly spread \nacross the country, although slightly higher in urban areas. A major problem is the bypassing of \npublic facilities or going straight to tertiary care facilities when primary or secondary care would \nhave  been  sufficient.  This  is  due  to  the  perceived  low  quality  of  care  and  unavailability  of \nmedicines.  Many  government  hospitals  have  inadequate  budgetary  support  and  managerial \nautonomy  after  devolution.  Private  services  are  perceived  to  offer  better  quality  care,  to  be \nsimilar in terms of access, but to be more costly. Public health services are more often used by \nthe poor who cannot afford private services. \n \n17. \nDistrict  hospitals,  although  classified  as  secondary  hospitals,  are  often  structured  as \nprimary care hospitals (under 50 beds), and they offer limited specialist and diagnostic services. \nProvincial hospitals are structured as secondary care hospitals, have specialist and diagnostic \nservices  with  limited  capacity,  but  are  located  in  larger  towns  and  cities.  Nongovernment \nsecondary  care  hospitals  are  mostly  located  in  urban  areas.  Most  hospital  beds  are  in  urban \ntertiary  hospitals.  The  current  PHIC-operated  accreditation  system  creates  an  incentive  for \n\n                                                 \n2 National Statistics Office. 2003. National Demographic and Household Survey. Manila \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n33 \n\ndeveloping tertiary hospitals. Nongovernment-owned hospitals, therefore, prefer to identify their \nstatus as \u201ctertiary,\u201d because they are then automatically accredited (while other hospital levels \nneed to be operational for at least 3 years) and receive higher reimbursement for inpatient care \nfrom PHIC compared to other hospital levels. The upgrading to tertiary hospitals is not needs-\nbased.  The  health  care  delivery  system  should  be  refined  with  appropriate  incentives  to \nencourage secondary care services in rural areas with referral links and to prevent unnecessary \nupgrading  of  secondary  to  tertiary  hospitals.  Appropriate  incentives,  such  as  through  a \ngatekeeping program combined with higher copayments for non-referred patients, could prevent \npatients from bypassing primary care clinics and reduce unnecessary hospital care and costs. \nThis  cannot  happen,  however,  without  upgrading  lower  level  health  services  providers,  like \nRHUs, to support necessary changes in behavior and preferences of patients and providers. \n \n\n2. \n\nAffordability \n\n18. \nSome 33% of Filipinos are classified as poor, while 20% of the urban population and 47% \nof the rural people are poor. Almost half of health care costs are paid out-of-pocket, while PHIC \ncontributes only 10% of these costs.3 Fees for services may deter the poor from seeking health \nservices at all or may cause greater poverty, indebtedness, and loss of land. The poor will often \nnot  be  able  to  afford  basic  health  care  (and  therefore  often  delay  care  until  it  is  too  late,  which \nparticularly  affects  children).  Also,  the  nonpoor  may  find  it  difficult  to  pay  for  catastrophic  and \nchronic  care.  If  not  deferring  treatment,  families  use  other  strategies  to  meet  their  health  care \nneeds,  including  self-medication,  sharing  medicine,  and  going  into  debt  for  severe  illnesses \n(including for terminal illnesses of the elderly). Given high levels of unemployment and prevailing \nsocial structures, income generators may also end up in poverty while caring for dependents.  \n \n19. \nDrugs constitute half of health expenditures. Except for the indigent, PHIC does not yet \noffer  reimbursement  for  outpatient  drugs.  The  absence  of  such  reimbursement  may  be  cause \nfor  unnecessary  hospital  admission,  not  only  because  of  forgone  prevention  opportunities  but \nalso simply to obtain medicines inside a hospital that are unaffordable to patients in outpatient \ncare. DOH is addressing this issue by gradually expanding access to simple drugstores via its \nsystem of botika ng barangay (community-managed drug outlets), which offer a limited variety \nof  essential  drugs  at  low  prices  procured  via  international  competitive  bidding  by  Philippine \nInternational Trading Corporation.  \n \n\n3. \n\nQuality of Care \n\nThere  is  no  accountability  for  quality  of  services  provided  at  health  facilities.  The \n20. \nPhilippines  has  licensing  (through  DOH)  and  an  accreditation  program  (through  PHIC)  for \nhospitals and other health care facilities, and the  PHIC reports that about 90% of all hospitals \nand  40%  of  all  rural  health  clinics  are  accredited.  However,  the  PHIC  accreditation  program \ncurrently does not meet international standards. PHIC accreditation standards are more or less \nlike the licensing program of DOH\u2014aiming for the facility to have the minimum inputs needed to \nfunction (human resources and equipment) but not looking at hospitals  more comprehensively \n(in terms of organization and systems). Further, many hospitals that should qualify for a higher \nlevel of care are unable to meet the standards and are therefore accredited for a lower level of \ncare  (e.g.,  secondary  rather  than  tertiary).  This  is  due  to  requirements  for  infrastructure, \nequipment, or human resource not being met. \n \n21. \n\nAccreditation  standards  complying  with  international  requirements  will  be  introduced  in \n\n                                                 \n3 National Statistics Office. 2005. Philippines National Health Accounts. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\n2009. These will be accompanied by a set of quality indicators that can be used for monitoring \nperformance  and  eventually  to  be  combined  for  selecting  providers  as  preferred  providers  to \nenter into favorable contracts with PHIC. To meet the new accreditation and quality standards, \nhospitals  will  need  to  invest  into  the  necessary  equipment  and  infrastructure,  as  well  as  to \ncomply with a host of other measures that include improving human resources, plus developing \nand  implementing  more  clinical  practice  guidelines  and  clinical  pathways.  Licensing  of  health \ncare professionals in essence grants a lifelong pass to deliver health services, because merely \nattending mandatory postgraduate training courses is sufficient for being relicensed. \n \n22. \nThe Philippines has to face a national shortage of physicians and nurses, as many leave \nthe  country  to  work  elsewhere.  There  is  an  apparent  lack  of  coordinated  incentives  to  keep \nessential health staff in the country, and especially in rural areas. The DOH-supported \u201cDoctors \nto  the  Barrios\u201d  program  is  a  good  initiative.  Medical  students  have  their  studies  subsidized  by \nDOH on condition that they work for 2 years in the barrios. It is a successful program, but it is \nsmall scale and most doctors leave the barrios after their mandatory 2 years of service.  \n \nDoctors  and  pharmacists  seem  to  have  an  interest  in  prescribing  and  dispensing \n23. \nbranded drugs instead of generics. PHIC has no instruments\u2014such as contracting\u2014to exercise \ncontrol  over  prescribing  and  dispensing  drugs.  While  markets  are  not  working  and  third  party \nhealth care payers are not effective, a more active market regulatory policy by the Government \ncould bring more balance to the market while stimulating real competition on price and quality.  \n \n24. \nPharmacies  are  regulated  to  assure  the  delivery  of  safe  drugs  to  the  patient,  but  the \ndistribution  of  pharmacies  across  the  country  is  not  regulated.  This  may  cause  access \nproblems.  In  addition,  antitrust  regulation  is  absent  or  insufficiently  used,  leaving  the  drugs \ndistribution to a few wholesalers and with consequences for the distribution of low-cost drugs. \nDOH  is  trying  to  solve  this  problem  by  stimulating  the  establishment  of  20,000  botika  ng \nbarangay by 2015 that would offer generic essential drugs.  \n \n\n4. \n\nManagement \n\n25. \nOn the national and LGU levels, the country lacks adequate instruments for stewardship \nand insufficient regulatory and enforcement capacity for planning and distribution of health care \nresources,  for  provider  performance  review,  and  for  quality  assurance.  As  a  consequence, \nmany small (less than 50 beds) hospitals (most of these doctor- or family-owned) have difficulty \ncoping  with  requirements  for  quality  and  continuity  of  care.  While  some  hospitals  have  high \noccupancy rates, are overcrowded, and need to place beds in corridors, others have very low \noccupancy  rates  and  very  short  length  of  stay.  This  points  to  an  ill-conceived  and  ill-planned \nsystem.  DOH  is  working  in  its  health  reform  program,  together  with  selected  provinces,  to \ndevelop  provincial  investment  plans  for  health.  These  plans  (for  which  financing  is  essential) \nshould facilitate targeted investments and better access to upgraded health care facilities.  \n \n26. \nPublic and private hospitals and clinics often lack managerial capacity, primarily because \nthe  facilities  are  run  not  by  trained  management  specialists  but  by  clinical  staff.  In  addition, \nappropriate  hardware  and  software  are  not  installed  for  information  management,  financial \nmanagement, claims processing, patient management, and patient record keeping. That means \nfinancial  and  quality  auditing  are  more  difficult  and  costly.  The  lack  of  inventory  systems  also \nresults  in  poor  drug  management  and  dangerous  stock-outs.  The  system  inefficiencies  have \nbeen costly. Alternative options need to be explored, including to strengthen in-house capacity \nfor  management  or  outsourcing  to  third  parties.  A  DOH  initiative  to  train  health  managers \ncontributes to solving the problems, but it is on a too-small scale. \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n35 \n\nSome  nongovernment  hospitals  are  outsourcing  medical  waste  management, \n27. \nhousekeeping,  security,  payment  claims  processing,  and  medical  and  office  equipment \nmaintenance. The company Philam, for example, provides claims processing services to health \nmaintenance  organizations.  The  Philippine  training  institutions  produce  adequate  skills  in  the \nareas  of  management,  information  technology,  and  accounting,  but  such  skills  have  not  been \nsufficiently  tapped  for  outsourcing  public  sector  institutional  or  health  facility  management. \nBenefits from economies of scale may be realized by outsourcing support and ancillary services \nfrom government and nongovernment health facilities.  \n \n28. \nAlthough  the  devolution  of  power  and  stewardship  functions  in  the  health  sector  to  the \nLGUs  has  its  good  aspects  (such  as  better  involvement  and  catering  to  local  health  needs), \ndevolution  has  made  it  difficult  to  implement  national  policies  and  health  objectives.  DOH  has \nonly  advisory  power  vis-\u00e0-vis  the  LGUs  on  some  of  the  issues  critical  for  the  proposed  DBP \nhealth  care  investment  program.  The  LGUs  have  limited  capacity  and  means  for  adequately \ndirecting the health sector in their areas and for managing the health care facilities under their \nresponsibility. Implementing rationalization of health services in the provinces has proven to be \ndifficult, despite the support of DOH. LGUs do not always take into account the capacity of the \nprivate  sector  and  sometimes  do  not  have  data  on  its  distribution,  function,  and  capacity. \nExclusion of the private sector from the planning exercise may, in the absence of planning data \nfrom the private sector, lead to distorted provincial investment plans for health.  \n \n\n \n5. \n\n \nFinancing  \n\n29. \nAbout  3.4%  of  gross  domestic  product  is  spent  on  health  (footnote  3).  That  is  low \ncompared with the WHO-advised level of 5% for middle-income countries. The larger part of this \nis  spent  on  tertiary  hospital  services.  The  public  tends  to  bypass  lower  facilities  and  access \ntertiary hospitals even for relatively minor problems. The funding arrangements make it difficult \nto regulate the sector by financial means.  \n \n30. \nThe country has not made a clear choice for either a budget-funded system, eventually \nto be combined with devolution to LGUs, or an insurance-funded system. Mandated pooling of \nfunding  and,  subsequently,  a  single-payer  system  do  not  exist.  This  leads  to  fragmentation  of \nboth funding and of care, with subsequent administrative and health care inefficiencies. In such \na fragmented system, none of the government bodies has sufficient regulatory enforcement or \nfinancial clout to effectively and efficiently govern the system of public and private providers.  \n \nHealth care is financed by multiple payers and from at least four different main sources: \n31. \nthe  national  budget  (16.7%),  the  LGU  budget  (17.5%),  PHIC  (9.5%),  private  insurers,  and \nprivate out-of-pocket spending at the point of service (48%).  \n \nPHIC  funding  is  also  out  of  balance.  While  the  national  health  insurance  system  is \n32. \ncompulsory, it effectively coverings only 75% of the population. It has difficulty enrolling the rich, \nsuch as the self-employed like lawyers and doctors. PHIC tries to expand the enrollment of the \npoor  via  an  LGU-sponsored  program  for  the  indigent.  Formal  employers  and  employees  pay \nincome-dependent  contributions,  while  the  informal  sector  pays  a  flat  and  comparably  low \npremium of P1,200 per year to allow the poor to become members of PHIC. Overseas foreign \nworkers and their dependents in the Philippines pay an even lower premium of P900 per year. \n \nAs  there  is  little  or  no  coordination  between  these  various  sources  of  funding,  there \n33. \nexists  none  of  the  potential  leverage  that  a  single-payer  system  could  have  vis-\u00e0-vis  the \nproviders.  Assessing  the  performance  of  health  care  providers  is  difficult\u2014and  scarcely \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\nattempted\u2014as  they  are  paid  from  many  different  sources  and  patients  are  free  to  choose \nproviders (not being bound to use the nearest providers).  \n \n34.  Moreover, current payment systems are not well tuned to act as incentives for providing \ncare  efficiently  and  at  the  right level  of  care.  The  current fee-for-service  system  for specialists \nencourages specialists to eagerly accept and keep patients and then to do as much as possible \nfor  each.  Meanwhile,  the  existing  financing  for  public  primary  health  care  is  no  incentive  for \ndoing as much as possible at the primary care level. The absence of a referral system further \ncontributes to the inappropriate use of care at an unnecessarily high level. Not all LGUs appear \nto transfer their agreed health budgets in full, or they pass the PHIC-received payments to the \nproviders, thus sometimes prompting the staff (like midwives) to leave the public sector and go \ninto private practice. PHIC has no insight into the funds flows of LGUs, and there is no external \naudit or accountability of the LGUs (e.g., as regards their fully transferring 70% of the capitation \nfor enrolling indigent people in PHIC). \n \n35. \nThe  current  reimbursement  in  PHIC\u2019s  fee-for-service  system  leaves  little  possibility  for \ncontrolling the volume of services and leads to over-servicing by the health care providers. This \nmay eventually be to the detriment of patients\u2019 health, and it will certainly lead to draining away \nscarce  resources.  Legally  and  practically,  therefore,  PHIC  has  no  effective  relationship  with \n(especially)  the  private  providers  other  than  through  the  accreditation  system  to  influence  the \nquality  of  care.  It  is  considering,  however,  to  introduce  a  contracting  system  together  with  a \ncase-based payment system, but only for inpatient care. If properly monitored and if the case-\nbased payment system is capped by a maximum budget per hospital, this may alleviate some of \nthe counterproductive incentives and supply-induced demand.  \n \n36.  While  funding  constraints  result  in  the  health  system\u2019s  insufficiently  responding  to  the \npopulation\u2019s preventive and curative health needs, PHIC nevertheless has rather high financial \nreserves  that  are  unnecessary  for  assuring  its  solvency  and  which  could  be  easily  and  wisely \nspent in the sector.  \n \nC. \n \n37. \nfollowing: \n(i) \n\nTo close the gap in access to health care, several measures are needed, including the \n\nConclusions and Recommendations \n\nInvesting in civil works and medical equipment, which should be accompanied by \nadequate  marketing  of  the  upgraded  services  to  the  population  that  could  profit \nfrom  these  services.  Such  investments  would  further  need  to  be  supported  by \nhuman  resources  management  and  incentives  for  health  staff  to  work,  or  to \ncontinue working, in the newly built or equipped health care facilities. \nReforming  the  health  care  financing  system  by  making  a  choice  for  a  budget-\nfunded  system  or  a  health  insurance-funded  system,  thereby  creating  a  single-\npayer  system,  together  with  giving  autonomy  to  public  hospitals  that  can  enter \ninto contracts with either PHIC or regional health authorities.  \nCreating  a  regulatory  environment  conducive  to  transparency  in  both  financing \nand  health  care  performance  while  providing  performance  monitoring  for \nproviders to ensure access to care, quality of care, and value for money.  \nIntroducing  an  effective  referral  system  via  PHIC  staff  acting  as  gatekeepers, \naccompanied by higher copayments when seeking higher levels of care without \nreferral  (except  in  accidents  and  specific  emergencies)  to  ensure  that  patients \nmake effective use of existing and upgraded facilities,  \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n37 \n\n(v) \n\nSupporting  this  referral  system  by  creating  vertical  networks  of  health  service \nproviders  that  also  foster  and  promote  cooperation  and  adequate  information \nexchange by professionals as to the various levels of care. There should also be \nmarketing  targeted  to  families  and  patients  to  inform  them  about  the  newly \navailable services, the kinds of services on offer, and their benefits for a person\u2019s \nhealth. \n\n  \n38. \nCreating  Investment  Opportunities.  Unfortunately,  DOH\u2019s  funds  for  investment  are \nrather limited, and there is no possibility for further borrowing. Going to commercial banks is not \nan  option  for  most  health  care  providers,  due  to  high  interest  rates  and  the  lack  of  collateral. \nDBP  has  a  legal  mandate  and,  in  principle,  the  capacity  to  provide  relatively  easy  access  to \ninvestment  funds  for  the  health  sector,  and  particularly  for  those  segments  where  access  to \ncredit is a concern. DBP is well positioned to reach its clients, given that (i) it has development \nknowledge in general and the potential to increase its understanding of the health sector; (ii) it \nhas  in-house  general  expertise  in  marketing,  albeit  insufficient  knowledge  of  social  marketing \ndirected to the health sector; and (iii) it has access to potential borrowers in cities and towns but \nwill  need  to  make  an  effort  to  reach  out  to  the  rural  areas  or  areas  outside  of  the  main  urban \ncenters. \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n\nPHILIPPINES CREDIT POLICY FRAMEWORK OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT UNITS \n \n\n1. \nThe  credit  policy  framework  of  local  government  units  (LGUs)  guides  government \nfinancial  institutions  (GFIs)  and  the  Municipal  Development  Fund  Office  (MDFO)  on  how  to \nprovide  their  financial  and  technical  assistance  to  LGUs.  It  comprises  four  clusters  based  on \nLGU creditworthiness and the types of projects to be undertaken.  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nCreditworthy LGUs with revenue-generating projects can be funded mostly from \nprivate sources of capital or GFIs (own funds).  \nMarginally  or  non-creditworthy  LGUs  with  revenue-generating  projects  can  be \nfunded from GFI loans and limited MDFO loans.  \nCreditworthy LGUs undertaking social and environmental projects whose returns \nare low or long in coming could be allowed to tap longer-term, lower-cost official \ndevelopment assistance funds through loans from GFIs or MDFO.  \nMarginally  or  non-creditworthy  LGUs  with  social  and  environmental  projects \ncould  be  assisted  by  loans  and  grants  from  MDFO  in  accordance  with  the \napproved policy of the National Economic and Development Authority Investment \nCoordination Committee.  \n\nIn  short,  for  health  projects,  LGUs  have  a  choice  of  seeking  credit  from  GFIs  or  MDFO,  and \nthose LGUs that are creditworthy are expected to gravitate toward GFIs.  \n \nWhere credit is not easily accessible for long-term investments from the private financial \n2. \nmarkets,  the  Government  offers  LGUs  alternate  public  sourced  of  credit  through  MDFO,1 the \nGFIs, 2  and  the  multilateral-  or  bilateral-financed  projects  of  the  central  Government.  The \nGovernment  has  a  comprehensive  credit  policy  framework  for  LGUs  under  which  the  lower \nfiscal  capacity  LGUs  rely  on  national  government  support  through  ongranting;  the  lower-to-\nmedium fiscal capacity LGUs (at all levels, but especially LGU levels 3\u20136) are eligible to borrow \nfrom MDFO, which provides a combination of loans and grants, as MDFO policies are pro-poor \nand  it  is  willing  to  offer  credit  even  without  LGUs  showing  their  creditworthiness;  and  the \nmedium-to-higher  fiscal  capacity  LGUs  (levels  1\u20132)  and  city-based  projects,  along  with  those \nthat can show their creditworthiness, rely on GFIs or, in a few cases, are able to access private \ncapital through municipal bond flotation.3  \n\n                                                 \n1  The ADB loan for the Health Sector Development Program is one such loan that finances LGUs through MDFO for \nhealth  care  investment,  but  the  second-generation  funds  are  limited  to  about  P6  billion  and  are  available  for  all \nsectors and for all LGUs.

Manila  (Loan \n2137-PHI). \n\n2  GFIs (75%) and MDFO (7%) were the dominant sources of LGU financing in 2006. GFIs have an advantage in the \nLGU  credit  market  because  of  their  role  as  LGU  depository  banks,  while  MDFO  has  access  to  internal  revenue \nallotment  intercept  mechanism  in  the  event  of  a  loan  default.

It had an initial capitalization of P5.0 billion. \n \n2. \nIn 1995, the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of the Philippines (Bangko Sentral ng \nPilipinas  [BSP])  granted  DBP  an  expanded  banking  license,  to  that  of  a  universal  bank, 1 \nauthorizing a broad range of wholesale and retail credit facilities. DBP serves as a conduit for \ninternational  funds  from  multilateral  sources  and  bilateral  institutions  for  official  development \nassistance programs and grants. \n \n3. \nRepublic Act No. 8523 of February 1998 aimed to promote the bank\u2019s growth, stability, \nand  long-term  viability  by  (i)  increasing  DBP\u2019s  authorized  capital  stock  from  P5 billion  to  P35 \nbillion,  (ii)  creating  the  position  of  president  and  chief  executive  officer  who  will  also  serve  as \nvice chairperson of the DBP board of directors, and (iii) exempting DBP from coverage by the \nSalary Standardization Law, 2008. \n \nB.  \n \n4. \nthe following:2 \n\nThe DBP is subject to the regulations of the BSP. The bank\u2019s corporate powers include \n\nCorporate Powers of DBP \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nto  grant  loans  to  local  governments  and  private  sector  entities  for  purposes  of \nrehabilitation, establishment, or development of any agricultural and/or industrial \nenterprise,  including  public  utilities,  infrastructure  projects,  mining,  livestock \nindustry, and fishing, whether offshore or inland; \nto  grant  loans  to  cooperative  associations,  individual  employees  of  public  and \nprivate  corporations  to  facilitate  agricultural  and  other  industrial  production,  \nmarketing,  and the acquisition of essential commodities; \nto  underwrite,  purchase,  own,  sell,  mortgage,  or  otherwise  dispose  of  stocks, \nbonds, debentures, securities, and other evidences of indebtedness issued for or \nin connection with any project or enterprise for self-liquidating purposes and carry \non the business of a trust corporation; and \nto organize, establish, and operate subsidiary corporations whenever necessary \nto better achieve DBP\u2019s objectives. \n\n \nOrganization Structure \n\nC. \n \n5. \nDBP is governed by a board of directors consisting of nine members, with at least four \nmembers from the private sector, all subject to appointment by the President of the Philippines. \nA president and chief executive officer serves as vice chairperson of the bank\u2019s board. For the \nbank\u2019s day-to-day operations, a senior executive vice president is appointed as chief operating \nofficer.  The  bank\u2019s  major  departments  include  the  following:  Trust  Services,  Program  Lending \n\n                                                 \n1  Bangko  Sentral  ng  Pilipinas:  Universal  and  commercial  banks  represent  the  largest  single  group,  with  regard  to \nresources,  among  the  country\u2019s  financial  institutions.  Among  financial  institutions,  they  offer  the  widest  variety  of \nbanking  services.  In  addition  to  the  function  of  an  ordinary  commercial  bank,  a  universal  bank  is  authorized  to \nengage  in  underwriting  and  other  investment  banking  functions,  as  well  as  to  invest  in  equities  of  non-allied \nundertakings. \n\n2  The Revised Charter of the Development Bank of the Philippines, Executive Order No. 81, s. 1986, as amended by \n\nRepublic Act No. 8523. \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \n\nSector,  Financial  Resource  Sector, Operations Sector,  Corporate  Banking  Sector, and  Branch \nBanking  Sector.  DBP  has  a  network  of  15  regional  marketing  offices  and  77  branches \nthroughout the country. \n \nDBP has strictly adhered to BSP stipulations for a risk-based operational framework and \n6. \ncapital  adequacy.  It  has  created  eight  board  committees  to  ensure  that  good  practices  in \ncorporate governance exist in the bank and also to implement proper risk management. These \nare (i) the Executive Committee, (ii) the Governance Committee, (iii) the Audit and Compliance \nCommittee,  (iv)  the  Committee  on  Risk  Management,  (v)  the  Human  Resource  Committee, \n(vi) the Management Committee, (vii) the Executive Credit Committee, and (viii) the Assets and \nLiabilities Committee. \n \nD. \n\nProducts and Services \n\n7. \nDBP finances industrial, environmental management, public utilities, new and renewable \nenergy,  social  development,  and  agro-industrial  projects.  It  funds  community  development \nendeavors,  including  socialized  housing  assistance  to  property  developers  and  homebuyers, \nmicroenterprise loans, and loans for hospitals serving both public and private sector clientele. \n \nE. \n\nProject Management Structure and Funds Flow Arrangements \n\n \n\n \n\nStaffing \n\n8. \nDBP  has  experienced  no  major  problems  in  the  receipt  of  funds  through  the  imprest \naccount. The credit policies ensure that risks are mitigated and priced accurately for sound and \nprudent banking operations. The credit policies are strengthened further by the establishment of \ndelegated  and  authorized  credit  limits  for  the  bank\u2019s  senior  officers  and  credit  committee \nmembers.  The  15  regional  marketing  offices  and  77  branches  will  participate  in  the  project \nimplementation.  The  organization  structure  at  the  branch  level  includes  the  following: \nTransaction  Processing  Unit,  Accounting  Unit,  Cash  Management  Unit,  Appraisal  Unit,  and \nProgram  Lending  Unit.  The  Credit  Policy  Review  and  Supervision  Department  performs  credit \nmonitoring,  portfolio  analysis,  and  credit  risk  and  asset  management.  It  monitors  gains  and \nlosses in the bank\u2019s externally funded onlending projects. The Risk Management Unit provides \nmanagement  and  operating  units  the  credit  risk  rating  system  and  structure  for  loan-loss \nprovisioning. \n \nF.   \n \n9. \nThe  Accounting  Department  consolidates  accounts  emanating  from  the  operating  units \nand maintains general ledgers. The Transaction Processing Department handles the subsidiary \nledgers for all accounts. The minimum qualification standards prescribed by the BSP for various \npermanent  officer-level  positions  and  the  Civil  Service  Commission  qualification  standards  for \npositions of the finance and accounts staff are upheld by the bank at all times. Regular training \nand seminars are conducted for both the head office and branch personnel to ensure efficient \ndelivery  of  services  and  maintenance  of  the  bank\u2019s  integrity.  DBP  account  officers  have \nattended  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  and  World  Bank-sponsored  seminars  on \nprocurement, resettlement planning, gender and development planning, and loan disbursement \nprocedures. \n \nG. \n \n10. \nAccounting  is  based  on  the  accrual  method.  As  mandated  by  the  BSP,  effective  from \n2005, DBP adopted the Philippine Financial Reporting Standards and the Philippine Accounting \nStandards,  which  correspond  to  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  and  International \nAccounting Standards. The Philippine Financial Reporting Standards and Philippine Accounting \nStandards were issued by the Philippine Financial Reporting Standards Council. DBP is audited \n\nAccounting Policies and Procedures, Audit, and Budgeting \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n55 \n\nFinancial Performance3 \n\nannually  by  the  BSP  and  Philippine  Deposit  Insurance  Corporation  for  compliance  with \nregulatory requirements. The Commission on Audit is DBP\u2019s external independent auditor.  \n \nH. \n \nDBP\u2019s  selected  balance  sheet  accounts  are  shown  in  Table  A11.1.  DBP\u2019s  total \n11. \nresources grew at an average annual rate of 8.4% during 2004\u20132006. Its assets base reached \nP241.6 billion ($5.14 billion) in 2006, higher by 13.0% from the previous year\u2019s reported assets \nlevel  of  P213.8  billion  ($4.55  billion).  DBP\u2019s  loans  portfolio  increased  at  an  average  annual \ngrowth  rate  of  29.9%,  reflecting  the  bank\u2019s  lending  performance.  The  bank\u2019s  loan  portfolio  of \nP137.83  billion  in  2006  comprised  20.9%  of  loans  extended  by  the  wholesale  banking  sector \nand were made to 41 accredited financial institutions for their various developmental projects. A \nlarge portion of the increase in DBP\u2019s total assets can be traced to an unprecedented rise in its \nsecurities  purchased  under  agreement  to  resell,  which  more  than  tripled  from  the  level  of \nP10.97 billion in 2005 to P42.68 billion in 2006. To increase its capital base, DBP issued tier 2 \ncapital securities in January 2006 and hybrid tier 1 capital securities in September 2006.  \n \nThe bank\u2019s total liabilities also exhibited an upward trend over the same period, growing \n12. \nat  an  annual  average  rate  of  6.02%.  The  bank\u2019s  deposit  mobilization  activities  demonstrated \npositive results, as deposits reached P71.1 billion ($1.51 billion) in 2006 and the average growth \nrate for 2004\u20132006 was 39.68%. DBP\u2019s borrowing activities reflected a slight decrease over the \nperiod, growing at an annual average rate of 9%, as its efforts were focused on efficient lending \npractices  and  managing  its  asset-liability  gap.  DBP\u2019s  equity  position  increased  at  an  annual \naverage rate of 26.1%. The marked decrease in real and other properties owned or acquired by \nan average of 48% is evidence of the bank\u2019s improved credit supervision system.  \n \n\n \nTable A11.1: Selected Balance Sheet Accounts  \n (P billion) \n \n\n \nAccount \nA.

An average 6.7% increase in total resources is assumed \ngenerated  from  average  loan  portfolio  growth  of  13.6%  and  11.25%  upward  movement  in \ninvestments.  A  9%  rise  in  borrowings  is  projected  for  2007,  followed  by  steady  growth  at  an \naverage rate of 6% for the next 3 years. For deposits, an average cost of 11.8% was applied for \nthe same period while the cost of borrowings was assumed to average 3.85%. \n \n14. \nCloser  examination  of  the  bank\u2019s  nonperforming  loans  for  2004  and  2005  showed  a \ndecreasing trend, which reflects improvement in the quality of loans extended by the bank and \nits enhanced management of credit risks. \n \n \n \n15. \nDBP\u2019s gross interest income grew steadily at an average annual rate of 13% from 2004 \nto  2006,  while  interest  expenses  increased  at  an  average  annual  rate  of  16%  and  there  was \nadditional  income  from  securities,  investments,  and  placements.  By  implementing  cost-cutting \nmeasures (such as an early retirement program), the bank kept administrative expenses within \nmanageable  levels  ranging  from  P4.38  billion  in  2004  to  P5.31  billion  in  2006),  yielding  an \naverage annual growth rate of 10%.

The \nloan funds will be provided for public and private health subprojects and can be used for both \ncapital  investments  and  working  capital.  The  funds  will  be  relent  through  (i)  retail  or  direct \nrelending to larger subprojects in the public and private sectors, and (ii) wholesale or relending \nthrough financial intermediaries to private sector smaller-scale subprojects.  \n \n2. \nDBP will relend to subprojects for (i) improving quality of health services to attain health \nfacility accreditation by the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PHIC); (ii) addressing the \ngaps  in  access  to  basic  health  services  (for  communicable  disease  control,  woman  and  child \nhealth care, clinical care, ancillary services, and generic drugs); and (iii) improving efficiency in \nhealth service financing and delivery through outsourcing, improving management systems, and \nother  innovative  strategies.  PHIC  accreditation  can  provide  an  added  stream  of  resources. \nPartnerships can provide an opportunity for the public sector to address shortages in financial \nand human resources.   \n \n3. \nThe  attached  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Public\u2013Private  Partnership  in  Health  will \nprovide  support  to  the  subborrowers,  including  local  government  units  (LGUs)  and  private \nproviders, in enhancing modalities for public\u2013private partnership (PPP), including (i) innovative \nstrategies to improve efficiency, access, and quality of services; (ii) to assist small-scale health \ncare  providers\u2019  obtain  access  to  credit  to  support  health-related  MDGs;  and  (iii)  to  mobilize \nprivate resources for achieving MDGs. \n \nB. \n \n4. \nThe TA\u2019s impact is to help improve the maternal and child health status by 2015 in the \nsubproject sites with PPP. The outcome of the TA will be tested PPP modalities that will have \ndemonstrated  potential  to  increase  the  use  of  maternal  and  child  health  care  and  referral \nservices in the subproject sites with PPP.  \n   \nC. \n \n5. \n\nMethodology and Key Activities  \n\nThe TA will have three outputs: \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n6. \nOutput 1. The TA will develop and promote PPP modalities in the health sector. For this, \nthe  TA  will  (i)  conduct  an  assessment  (of  policies,  regulations,  systems  such  as  procurement \nand budgets, and readiness of civil society institutions), produce public service comparators on \nPPP,  and  prepare  a  report;  (ii)  assist  in  preparing  documents  (policy,  regulations,  guidelines \nincluding a handbook for PPP in the health sector) based on the recommendations of the report \nand the results of stakeholder consultations; and (iii) identify preliminary PPP health subprojects \nin parallel that could be supported under Credit for Better Health Care Project (the \u201cProject\u201d).    \n\n \n\n \n\n7. \nOutput  2.  The  TA  will  develop  incentives  and  operational  strategies  to  encourage  the \nparticipation  of  private  small-scale  health  providers  in  attaining  PHIC  accreditation  for  health \nservices (particularly in rural and underserved areas) in order to address health-related MDGs. \nThe  TA  will  investigate  and  document  case  studies  where  providers  are  working  in  rural  and \nunderserved  areas  in  order  to  understand  the  incentives  for  them  to  locate  to  and  remain  in \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n59 \n\nsuch  areas  (a  report  will  be  produced).  The  TA  will  work  in  close  collaboration  with  private \nassociations,  nongovernment  organization  microfinance  institutions,  and  the  LGUs  to  develop \nownership and commitment for, to operationalize, and to scale up these initiatives. LGUs under \nF1  are  mapping  health  services  and  identifying  gaps  in  services.  Private  small-scale  health \nproviders  will  be  provided  access  to  credit  under  the  Project,  and  the  TA  will  work  with  the \npotential  subborrowers  to  create  demand  among  providers  to  locate  and  enhance  PHIC-\naccredited service provision in rural and underserved areas.  \n\n \n\nOutput 3. The TA will aim to initiate the contracting modality under PHIC. This initiative \n8. \nhas  already  started  under  TA  supported  by  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  whereby  PHIC\u2019s \ninstitutional capacity is being built for contracting between PHIC and health services providers.1 \nThe  contract  would  give  PHIC  better  leverage  with  the  providers,  an  opportunity  to  establish \nstandards  for  PHIC-provider  service  performance,  and  the  possibility  to  assess  PHIC \nbeneficiaries\u2019 satisfaction with the services. Contracting could aim to reduce balance billing and \ncontain health care cost inflation while improving financial protection for PHIC beneficiaries. The \nTA will continue to support this modality by helping progress this agenda under the Project, and \nthe  TA  will  design  mechanisms  and  tools\u2014then  test  them  among  project  sites\u2014to  test  the \ncontracting  modality,  refine  the  contractual  terms,  monitor  the  contractual  agreements,  and \nassess  the  impact  of  the  contracted  services  on  the  use  and  satisfaction  of  health  services \nconsumers and providers. The tools will be used under the Project. Contracting should ensure \nimproved consumer satisfaction with the contracted health provider. \n \nD. \n \n9. \nThe TA is estimated to cost $1,100,000. ADB will provide $1,000,000 on a grant basis. \nDBP will finance the remaining $100,000 equivalent in kind, which will cover the costs of office \naccommodation; transport; utilities; seminar room space; remuneration of counterpart staff; and \nprovision of data, reports, and other relevant documents.    \n \n\nCost and Financing \n\nTable A12: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan ($) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1. \n \n \n \n \n \n2. \n3. \n4. \n5. \n6. \n \n\nConsultants Remuneration and Per Diem \nRemuneration and Per Diem \na. \ni.

The  overall  work  of  the  TA  will  be  monitored  and  reported  to  the  advisory  committee \nunder  the  Project.  The  TA  management  unit  will  be  established  under  the  Program \nDevelopment  Department  of  the  DBP.  TA  implementation  units  will  be  established  under  the \nBureau  of  International  Health  Cooperation  in  DOH  and  under  the  Health  Finance  Policy  and \nService Sector of the PHIC.   \n \nADB  will  recruit  a  team  of  international  and  national  consultants  to  provide  specialized \n11. \nservices  totaling  80  person-months  (30  international  and  50  national)  in  the  areas  of  public\u2013\nprivate partnership in health; finance; legal matters; health systems; procurement; and training.  \nADB  will  engage  the  consultants  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  using  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  (with  a \nquality:cost ratio of 80:20) and simplified technical proposals. The outline terms of reference will \nbe provided at a later stage. Within the Executing Agency, the consultants will report to the head \nof DBP\u2019s Program Development Department. For output 1, the consultants will work closely with \nthe Bureau of Health Policy and Development of DOH. For output 2, the consultants will work \nclosely  with  DOH  and  PHIC.  For  output  3,  the  consultants  will  work  closely  with  the  Health \nFinance Policy and Service Sector of the PHIC.  \n \nThe  TA  will  be  implemented  over  18  months,  commencing  July  2009  and  ending  by \n12. \nDecember 2010. The TA consultants will submit (i) within 1 month of TA start-up, an inception \nreport that will propose the methodology for carrying out activities for the duration of the TA; (ii) \nan interim report within 9 months of TA implementation; and (iii) a final report within 17 months \nof  implementation.  DBP,  DOH,  PHIC,  ADB,  and  the  team  of  consultants  will  hold  tripartite \nmeetings during inception, at midterm, and upon completion of the TA. Key findings and outputs \nof the TA will be disseminated through workshops and stakeholders discussions. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n61 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \n\nCountry/Project Title: Philippines: Credit for Better Health Care Project  \n\n \nLending/Financing \nModality: \n\n \n\n \n\nFinancial Intermediary \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n \n\nSoutheast Asia Department \nSocial Sectors Division \n\n \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  poverty  reduction  strategy  states  \"Poverty  is  a  deprivation  of  essential  assets  and \nopportunities to which every human is entitled. Everyone should have access to basic education and primary health services.\" \nThe Philippine country poverty assessment  states \"Health status affects a person\u2019s ability to go to school, to obtain  work and \ngenerate income, and to generally participate in society.\" The poverty assessment notes that access to quality health care is a \npressing poverty issue, particularly for maternal and child health care and treatment of communicable disease, although health \nspending is well below international standards and on a downward trend. The Philippines country strategy and program update \n2005\u20132007 calls for a refined focus to achieve more rapid poverty reduction and progress toward the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs). While fiscal constraints persist, it adds direct support for the MDGs will be coursed through off-budget financing. \nThe Philippines\u2019 progress toward achieving the MDGs has been uneven. While the country appears to be on track for achieving \nmost  MDG  goals,  the  goals  are  not  yet  met.  The  most  recent  MDG  progress  reporta  calls  for  accelerating  implementation  of \nbasic education and health care reforms, strengthening the capacity of local government units (LGUs) to provide basic services, \nand    generating  and  mobilizing  resources  for  MDG-related  programs.  The  proposed  loan  has  been  designed  to  support \nachievement  of  the  health-related  MDGs  without  burdening  fiscal  capacity  and  while  mobilizing  additional  resources  by \nleveraging private participation. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification:  TI-M  \n1. Key Issues  \nPhilippine  progress  in  reducing  poverty  has  been  uneven,  and  the  2007  MDG  report  on  the  probability  of  achieving  the \n47 indicators  associated  with  the  eight  MDG  goals  cautions  that  a  high  probability  is  not  a  guarantee  of  achievement.  The \nProject focuses on health MDGs: Goal 4 to reduce under-five and infant mortality; Goal 5 to improve maternal health; and Goal \n6 to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases. The Philippines\u2019 performance has been mixed. The probability is high for \nachieving  indicators  4.1  on  under-five  mortality,  4.2  on  infant  mortality,  and  6.6  on  malaria.  The  probability  is  medium  for \nachieving indicator 6.9 on the prevalence of tuberculosis. The probability is low for achieving indicator 4.3 on child immunization, \nindicator 5.1 on maternal mortality, indicator 5.2 on the proportion of births attended by a skilled birth attendant, indicator 5.3 on \nthe use of contraceptives, and indicator 6.9 on deaths from tuberculosis.b \n \nThe Project was designed to support implementation of the Government\u2019s agenda in health sector reform toward achieving the \nMDGs.  The  Department  of  Health  (DOH)  Fourmula  One  for  Health  (F1)  reforms  enhance  access  to  primary  medical  care \nservices,  strengthen  effective  access  to  secondary  referral  care  services,  promote  partnership  between  the  public  and \nnongovernment sectors to address gaps in the public system, and promote innovative strategies for health system performance \nand efficiency gain. \n \nThe  Kapit  Bisig  Laban  sa  Kahirapan  (KALAHI),  which  means  linking  arms  against  poverty,  was  launched  in  2001  as  the \nGovernment\u2019s strategic framework for poverty reduction The framework has five components: (i) accelerated asset reform, (ii) \nimproved  access  to  human  development  services,  (iii)  provision  of  employment  and  livelihood  opportunities,  (iv)  security  from \nviolence and social protection, and (v) institutionalized and strengthened participation. The KALAHI approach bringing together \nall levels of government, the private sector, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and the target groups (farmers and landless \nrural  workers,  fisherfolk,  informal  sector  workers,  indigenous  peoples,  women,  children,  youth,  the  elderly,  and  victims  of \ncalamities). KALAHI-CIDSS (Comprehensive and Integrated Delivery of Social Services) is the Government\u2019s flagship program \nfor improving access to human development services using a community-driven development approach and providing funding \nfor microfinance for livelihood development and basic infrastructure investment, including in barangay health stations. \n \nThe  Project  links  to  the  KALAHI  strategy  in  several  ways.  The  aim  is  to  reduce  poverty  through  achieving  the  health-related \nMDGs  by  improving  access  to  basic  health  services  (component  i)  while  creating  employment  and  livelihood  opportunities \n(component iii) with the participation of government, the private sector, and NGOs. The Project provides an innovative package \nof  health  industry  financial  services  enabling  health  service  sector  professionals  to  establish  or  expand  their  services.  A \nsignificant portion of the investment will be for such micro-health enterprises as birthing homes and distributors and retailers of \ngeneric drugs, as well as for such small health enterprises as rural health units, primary care hospitals, or upgrading secondary \ncare  hospitals.  Local  governments  with  limited  fiscal  capacity  will  gain  access  to  off-budget  means  (through  a  development \nfinancial  intermediary)  to  borrow  for  their  health  investment  needs.  The  Project  encourages  public\u2013private  partnerships  by \nenabling the public sector to guarantee a minimum level of income to private investors, thus resulting in increased provision of \nhealth care services at a lower cost to the government. DOH and the Philippines Health Insurance Company (PHIC) are also \npartners  in  the  Project  by  facilitating  accreditation  and  expansion  plus  timely  reimbursements  of  health  care  delivery  costs. \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nAccreditation  and  PHIC  reimbursements  enable  health  care  providers  to  deliver  services  at  a  lower  cost,  resulting  in  reduced \nout-of-pocket expenses for patients and enabling local governments to expand their indigent health care.  \n \nAchieving  goals  4,  5,  and  6  targets  for  reducing  child  and  infant  mortality,  maternal  mortality,  and  deaths  from  tuberculosis \nrequires  improved  access  to  front-line  health  personnel,  to  midwives  and  nurses,  to  basic  drugs  backed  up  by  doctors  for \ncomplications, and to a referral service for life-saving hospital care. The single best strategy for reducing maternal and neonatal \nmortality  is  for  women  to  deliver  in  a  medical  facility  with  midwives  and  a  medical  team  available.  Death  from  tuberculosis \naccounts  for  10%  of  all  deaths  in  the  Philippines  and  is  preventable  through  public  health  care  implemented  at  the  primary \nhealth care (PHC) level. The leading causes of death for children under 5 years old are neonatal deaths followed by diarrhea \nand upper respiratory diseases. \n \nThe loan products will be marketed by the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) through its regional centers. DBP\u2019s 17 \nregional centers are positioned to reach out to underserved areas. DBP has already initiated this outreach effort  working  with \nthe  League  of  Provinces  and  professional  health  service  provider  organizations.  The  impact  on  poor  and  low-income \nhouseholds  will  be  achieved  through  the  choice  of  eligible  investments.  Expanding  PHIC  accreditation  of  public  and  private \nhealth service providers reduces health service costs. Expanding private birthing centers, small doctor practices, basic generic \ndrugs,  and  simple  diagnostic  facilities  outside  of  a  hospital  setting  brings  basic  health  care  to  relatively  underserved  areas, \nthereby enabling timely access  while reducing transportation costs. Subloans to provincial governments for rehabilitating rural \nhealth units, upgrading the capacity of hospitals, and improving referral networks enable delivery of public health programs and \ntimely access to basic lifesaving care.  \n \n2.  Design  Features.  Special  features  of  the  Project  enhance  its  MDG-targeting  impact.  The  list  of  eligible  and  ineligible \ninvestments focuses on essential investments for achieving MDGs 4, 5, and 6. Allowable investments by type and level of health \nservices provider were screened to ensure the greatest gain in public health and focus on the key elements required for PHIC \naccreditation,  thus  enabling  service  delivery  at  lower  cost.  The  social  marketing  components  provide  outreach  to  types  of \ninvestors,  such  as  midwives,  who  are  generally  outside  the  scope  of  formal  financial  services  and  provide  access  to \nentrepreneurial training to support the business aspects of their investments. Local government is expected to take up the bulk \nof  the  investment  in  rural  health  units,  either  directly  or  through  partnerships.  Local  government  eligibility  criteria  include  prior \npreparation of a health investment plan and a commitment to increase support for indigent health care.  \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending \nNot applicable \n\nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \nThe Project\u2019s ultimate beneficiaries are women, children, indigents and the ill, and families.  \n \nWomen bear multiple costs of inadequate access to health care in their reproductive and child-rearing roles. Maternal mortality \nis intractably high. Fifty-five percent of all Filipino women deliver at home. Yet one of the major interventions to reduce maternal \nmortality  and  improve  neonatal  survival  is  for  a  woman  to  deliver  at  a  properly  equipped  health  facility  attended  by  a \nprofessional. Location plays a large role in determining place of delivery. In rural areas, 43% of women in the highest income \nquintile deliver at home, while among their better-served urban counterparts only 17% of women in the highest income quintile \ndeliver at home.c The most frequently cited reason for women delivering at home is cost. Hospital delivery is expensive. Public \nprograms  provide  free  antenatal  care  for  poor  women  but  not  the  cost  of  delivery.  Facilitating  PHIC  accreditation  of  service \nproviders,  including  midwives,  reduces  patient  out-of-pocket  costs  and  brings  quality  obstetric  care  closer  to  home  at  a \nsignificantly lower cost. \n \nThe  leading  causes  of  death  among  children  under  5  years  old  are  largely  preventable:  pneumonia,  diarrhea,  and  measles. \nPoor  access  to  PHC  results  in  underutilization,  thus  transforming  manageable  illnesses  into  catastrophic  events.  The  rural \nhealth  units  (RHUs)  are  often  understaffed  and  essential  drugs  stocked-out,  thus  constraining  their  support  to  the  barangay \nhealth station (BHS) front-line care and public outreach programs. RHUs and BHSs jointly provide 50% of all outpatient care. \nUpgrading  rural  health  units  performance  is  key  to  effectively  delivering  PHC  and  reducing  the  leading  causes  of  under-5 \nmortality. \n \nThe  same  proportion  of  poor  and  nonpoor\u2014many  of  whom  are  near-poor\u2014self-medicate  when  ill.  The  most  significant \ndifference between poor and nonpoor is in the choice of service provider; the public sector provides more than half of all care for \nthe  poor  and  nonpoor.d  The  private  sector  also  serves  a  surprisingly  large  proportion  of  the  poor.  In  Metro  Manila,  the  poor \nalmost exclusively use the public  health  system for outpatient care, and 60% make use of city  and barangay health services. \nThe public sector serves about 60% of the nonpoor. Outside of Metro Manila, 75% of the poor utilize the public health system for \noutpatient  services  compared  to  about  60%  of  the  non-poor.  The  private  sector  provides  the  balance.  While  private  sector \nmedical care is sometimes viewed as beyond the reach of the poor, it is in fact an important partner to government in providing \nhealth care services to the poor.  \n \n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n63 \n\nDrug costs are high, and outside the major cities distribution is uneven and unreliable. The Government has initiated a program \nto ensure the availability of essential generic medicines at the municipal level by promoting private sector investment in generic \ndrug  distribution  and  stocking.  The  Project  targets  expansion  of  provincial  or  regionally  based  distribution  networks  and \nupgrading of small retail or cooperative pharmacies as generic drug outlets.  \n \nFamilies  are  aware  of  local  health  care  conditions,  including  staffing,  quality  of  services,  and  availability  of  medication.  As  a \nresult, even the poor will go into debt and leapfrog PHC facilities to reach higher quality health care at a public or private hospital \nwith  a  good  reputation.  As  a  result,  hospitals  are  overburdened  by  the  demand  for  outpatient  PHC  services  that  should  have \nbeen provided at lower-level facilities and their capacity to deliver appropriate hospital services is diminished. In addition, when \nPHC  services  are  provided  in  a  hospital  setting,  they  are  delivered  at  high  cost  that  unnecessarily  burdens  either  local \ngovernment coffers or private patients\u2019 pocketbooks. \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nExtensive consultations were carried out during the design phase of the Project to determine (i) health investments that will help \nin  achieving  MDGs,  (ii)  potential  health  care  services  investors  and  the  loan  conditions  they  prefer,  and  (iii)  the  factors  that \nwould  facilitate  these  investments.  Consultative  methods  included  presentations  to  associations,  key  person  interviews,  plus \nfocus  group  discussions  and  small  group  workshops  for  consensus  development.  Consultations  covered  national  government \nagencies,  such  as  the  DOH,  Philippine  Council  for  Accreditation  of  Health  Organizations,  PHIC,  and  Philippine  International \nTrading Corporation. International organizations active in the health sector were included, such as World Health Organization, \nGerman  Agency  for  Technical  Cooperation,  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development,  and  the  World  Bank.  The  \nmain  focus  was  on  representatives  of  targeted  subloan  investors:  provincial  government  health  officials,  the  University  of  the \nPhilippines,  Doctors  to  the  Barrio  program  managers,  Philippines  Doctors  Association,  Private  Hospitals  Association,  Drug \nAssociation,  Midwives  Association,  owners  of  primary  and  secondary  hospitals,  and  owners  of  tertiary  hospitals  regarding \nconstruction  of  outpatient  satellite  clinics,  cooperatives,  not-for-profit  franchises  providing  maternal  and  child  health  services, \nfamily  doctors,  midwives,  and  providers  of  support  services  such  as  for  physical  rehabilitation  providers,  clinical  laboratories, \nand pharmacists. Although the Project is national in scope, the consultations focused on Davao City in region XI; Sta. Maria and \nSan Miguel municipalities in Bulacan, region III; Iloilo City in region VI; Cebu City in region VII; and Cagayan de Oro City and \nMisamis Oriental in region X in Mindanao. These areas were selected because of their limited health services and low-income \nrural areas. \n \n2.

Was a C&P plan prepared? \nC. Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues: Low access to affordable quality basic care is reflected in the health status of the family, increases the burden \non  women  as  caretakers,  and  raises  the  risks  associated  with  pregnancy  and  delivery.  The  Project  encourages  investments \naddressing  women\u2019s  reproductive  health  needs,  including  for  safe  maternal  and  neonatal  care  through  the  development  of \nmidwives- and obstetrician-owned birthing facilities. Professional midwives are female micro-entrepreneurs outside the scope of \ntraditional  microfinance  development  schemes  that  face  difficulties  upgrading  and  expanding  their  businesses  because  of \ninexperience  with  banking  and  with  health  facility  financial  management.  They  have  difficulty  in  achieving  PHIC  accreditation, \nalthough that would help offset their clients\u2019 low ability to pay. Obstetricians seeking to open facilities in rural areas are generally \nexperienced with banks and banking but are otherwise subject to the same constraints as midwives. \n2.  Key Actions.

To reduce credit risk, DBP  will assess all private investments \nand  will  not  finance  subloan  proposals  that  would  cause  any  involuntary \nresettlement  impacts.  DBP  will  carry  out  due  diligence  on  all  investments \nand only finance those that are wholly owned with clear title and free of any \ninformal settler issues. DBP has sufficient experienced property appraisers \nto  execute  the  due  diligence  required.  DBP\u2019s  operating  guidelines  on  the \nuse  of  the  project  funds  will  include  involuntary  resettlement  safeguard \ninvoluntary \nprocedures \n\nflag  all  subloan  proposals  with  potential \n\nto \n\nPlan or Other \ndesign \nMeasures  \n \n\nResettlement  \nFramework \n \n\nIssue \n\nInvoluntary \nResettlement \n\n \n\n\f64 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nIndigenous \nPeoples  \n \n\nLimited \n\n   \n\nIndigenous \n Peoples \n Framework \n \n\ninformal  dwellers,  as  well  as  whether \n\nresettlement impacts. In their due diligence report, account officers and the \nproperty appraiser will indicate whether a proposed subproject would cause \nany  involuntary  resettlement  impacts,  and,  if  not,  whether  there  had  been \nany  eviction  of \ninvoluntary \nresettlement  guidelines  had  been  followed  and  all  requirements  had  been \nmet.  DBP\u2019s  programs  unit  will  ensure  and  certify  compliance,  that  no \nsubloan  credit  application  was  approved  that  would  cause  any  involuntary \nresettlement  impacts,  and  that  no  eviction  of  informal  dwellers  had  been \nundertaken.  A  resettlement  framework  has  been  prepared  detailing  the \nprocedures  to  be  followed  by  DBP  to  ensure  there  are  no  involuntary \nresettlement impacts associated with the Project. \nAs  the  proposed  Project  is  a  financial  intermediary  loan,  the  subloan  site \nlocations are not known. While the Project is national in scope, the activities \nwill  be  location-specific.  The  impact  of  the  proposed  loan  on  indigenous \npeoples  will  depend  on  the  nature  and  location  of  eligible  investments \nproposed  by  subloan  borrowers  interested  in  accessing  the  credit  facility. \nThe  location  may  include  indigenous  people  locations,  such  as  tribal \nbarangays,  indigenous  people  ancestral  domains,  or  proposed  ancestral \ndomains. Subloan proponents may be indigenous peoples, non-indigenous \npeoples, or other organizations. Eligible public sector subloans will not have \nan indigenous people impact, as they are required to maintain or restore a \nlevel  and  type  of  service  already  provided.  Private  commercial  sector \nsubloans  are  not  expected  in  most  indigenous  people  areas,  because \nremote  and  low  population  density  areas  generate  little  demand.  Private \ncharitable organizations with outreach to indigenous people areas generally \nmeet  their  capital  requirements  from  their  memberships.  Credit  demand \nmay exist in the population centers of special areas where large parts or an \nentire province has been designated as an indigenous people\u2019s area. Free \nand prior informed consent is only required, however, if the proponent is a \nmigrant.  As  loan  operational  guidelines  require  the  proponents  to  hold  title \nto their proposed project sites, subloan proposals from migrants are unlikely \nto  qualify.  Few  and  possibly  no  subloans  with  indigenous  people  impacts \nare  expected.  An  indigenous  people  framework  has  been  prepared  that \ndetails  the  procedures  to  be  followed  to  screen  and  identify  subloan \nproposals for potential indigenous people impacts as part of the initial credit \nassessment, specifies the actions required, and monitors compliance.  \nThe Project\u2019s subloans create employment in the health care sector through \ninvestments  in  such  health  care  microenterprises  as  birthing  clinics  and \npharmacies. \n\nLabor \n\n Employment \n\nopportunities \nAffordability \n\nLimited \nImpact \n\n/ \nOther  Risks \nVulnerabilities  \n\nSignificant  The Project increases heath care affordability by improving access to PHC at \nthe local level, where it can be delivered at lower cost and closer to home. \nThe  Project  facilitates  enrollment  in  the  PHIC  outpatient  care  benefit \npackage  that  reduces  out-of-pocket  costs  for  private  patients  and  enables \nlocal governments to cover more indigents from the same budget. \n \n\nNo impact \n\n \n\n   No Action \n\n   No Action \n\nIV.
