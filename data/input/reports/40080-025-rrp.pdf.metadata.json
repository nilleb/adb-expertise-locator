The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nThe project will develop a 12.5 kilometer (km) dual-track rail line between the suburb of \n2. \nNhon and the main railway station of Viet Nam\u2019s capital city, Ha Noi\u20143.5 km underground, 8.5 \nkm elevated, and 0.5 km on a transition ramp. The project works include a depot with ancillary \nbuildings at Nhon, elevated viaducts, a transition tunnel portal, bored tunnels, and 12 stations. \nThe  project  will  provide  electrical  and  mechanical  systems,  including  all  railway  systems \nrequired to operate a modern metro line. The project also includes support for detailed design, \nprocurement,  construction  supervision,  design  verification,  project  management,  and  capacity \ndevelopment.  The  additional  loans  will  finance  an  expected  increase  in  the  cost  of  the  civil \nworks  contract,  as  well  as  consulting  services  for  a  second  phase  of  project  management \nsupport (PMS).  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \n3. \nLine  3  of  the  Ha  Noi  metro  system  is  one  of  four  priority  rail  lines  planned  under  the \ngovernment\u2019s urban transport master plan for Ha Noi that was approved by the Prime Minister in \n2008.1 The project will enhance access to transport in six districts of Ha Noi and form an integral \npart of a better public transport system that aims to improve connectivity and raise the share of \npublic  rail  and  bus  transport  to  40%  of  passenger  demand.  This  will  shift  travelers  from \ncomparatively  high-carbon  urban  travel  modes  such  as  private  motorcycles  and  cars  and \nreduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  The  executing  agency  is  the  Ha  Noi  People\u2019s  Committee \n(HPC),  which  is  the  city  government.  The  implementing  agency  is  the  Ha  Noi  Metropolitan \nRailway Management Board (MRB), which was established in 2003 by HPC with responsibility \nto  carry  out  implementation  of  those  portions  of  the  Ha  Noi  Metro  Rapid  Transit  network  not \ndirectly operated by Viet Nam Railways.  \n \n4. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided technical assistance in 2006 for an initial \nfeasibility  study  of  the  metro  line  3  project.2 ADB  approved  a  $293  million  loan  from  ordinary \ncapital resources (OCR) for the current project on 29 March 2011, and it became effective on 13 \nMarch  2012.  Nine  civil  works  and  equipment  contracts  and  four  consulting  services  contracts \nhave been financed with cofinancing of \u20ac110 million from Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement \n(AFD),  \u20ac250  million from  Direction  G\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Tr\u00e9sor (DGT)  of  France,  and \u20ac73 million from \nthe  European  Investment  Bank  (EIB).  ADB  is  financing  the  civil  works  contract  for  the  tunnel \nsection of line 3 and four underground stations through contract package 3.3 \n\n \n\n                                                \n1  JICA. 2007. The Comprehensive Urban Development Programme in Hanoi Capital City. Ha Noi. \n2   ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Preparing the Ha Noi Metro Rail System \nProject.  Manila  (TA  4900-VIE).  The  feasibility  study  was  subsequently  updated  and  completed  by  DGT-funded \nconsultants.  \n\n3   ADB originally had two contracts to finance, one of them jointly with AFD. After restructuring, ADB is fully financing \n\none contract.   \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nThe  ADB-financed feasibility  study  in 2009  estimated the  overall  project cost  at  \u20ac895.4 \n5. \nmillion,  then  equivalent  to  $990.5  million.4 Detailed  design  and  updated  cost  estimates  were \ncompleted  by  the  project  implementation  consultant  in  March  2012  with  DGT  financing. \nHowever, delays and cost increases caused by design changes, audits, contractual issues, the \nremoval  of  existing  utility  lines,  preparation  and  implementation  of  resettlement  plans,  and \ncontinued price escalation have raised the project cost in US dollars to the current estimate of \n$1,375.7 million.5 The Government of Viet Nam approved the revised project outlines on 5 and \n23 December 2014 and authorized the needed increases in official development aid financing. \nThis approval and the additional financing will ensure that the project will be completed in 2019 \nand help the government achieve economic development objectives laid out in the Ha Noi urban \ntransport master plan (footnote 1). \n \nAdditional loans for the project were approved in December 2014 by AFD (\u20ac69.0 million) \n6. \nand DGT (\u20ac85.0 million). EIB expects to approve its proposed additional loan of \u20ac70.0 million by \nthe end of 2015. The government has asked ADB to provide additional financing of $59.0 million \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  OCR  and  $50.0  million  from  the  CTF6 to  finance  potential  future  increases  in  the \ncost of the project\u2019s civil works, as well as $5.8 million from the Asian Development Fund (ADF) \nto finance additional PMS consulting services. The government\u2019s application for CTF financing \nwas approved by the CTF Trust Fund Committee on 28 October 2014. The additional financing \nfrom ADB and the cofinanciers is likely to be enough to complete the project. The government \nhas  committed  to  providing  additional  counterpart  funds  to  finance  taxes  and  duties,  utility \nremovals, and land acquisition and resettlement (LAR).  \n \n7. \nFour  out  of  the  nine  contract  packages  for  civil  works  and  equipment  have  been \nawarded.  Current  rates  of  progress  are  about  14%  for  contract  package  1,  21%  for  contract \npackage  2,  90%  for  contract  package  4,  and  23%  for  contract  package  5.  The  depot  and  the \n8.5-km  elevated  section  of  line  3  are  expected  to  be  completed  in  late  2016.  Procurement  is \nongoing  for  four  contracts,  and  awards  are  expected  by  the  end  of  2015.  The  ADB-financed \ncontract  package  3  was awarded on  22  October  2015. The  civil  works  under this  contract  are \nexpected to be completed by mid-2019, and all the line 3 works should be finished by the end of \n2019. \n \nThe  project  includes  the  first  railway  tunnel  ever  constructed  in  Ha  Noi,  and  this  work \n8. \nrequires strong international technical and project management expertise. Because the project \nis highly complex, MRB staff requires continuous support in managing daily activities to ensure \nthat  implementation  meets  the  cofinanciers\u2019  requirements  and  high  international  quality \nstandards. The consulting services for phase 1 of PMS under the current project were financed \nby AFD, but the contract for this phase expired on 30 September 2015. ADB will finance phase \n2 of PMS consulting services from its proposed additional financing. The PMS consultant is to \nbe  mobilized  immediately  after  loan  effectivity,  which  is  currently  scheduled  for  April  or  May \n2016. ADB will assign individual staff consultants to ensure that the PMS services continue until \n\n                                                \n4   This proposed additional financing project uses an August 2015 exchange rate of \u20ac1.0 = $1.1 to convert financial \nfigures,  including  the  financing  to  be  provided  by  the  cofinanciers  in  euros.  The  current  project  used  a  February \n2011 exchange rate of \u20ac1.0 = $1.3 to estimate the overall project cost, including the financing by the cofinanciers in \neuros, which was equivalent at that rate to $1,077.2 million.     \n\n5   The civil works costs may rise because houses and buildings above the tunnel section may prove to be obstacles \nto  construction.  Before  tunnel  boring  starts,  the  contractor  for  the  ADB-financed  contract  package  3  will  identify \nobstacles through a preliminary assessment and develop a detailed work plan that will include actions, a schedule, \nand costs for land acquisition and resettlement.  \n\n6   The CTF is part of the multidonor global Climate Investment Fund, which supports low-carbon transport to promote \n\ngreenhouse gas emission reduction. \n\n\fthe  phase  2  consulting firm  has  been mobilized.  The terms  of reference for the  PMS  phase  2 \nconsulting services are in the project administration manual (PAM).7  \n \nBased  on  the  criteria  of  ADB  Operations  Manual,  the  current  project  is  not  performing \n9. \nwell because (i) expected outputs are being delivered 4 years behind schedule; and (ii) contract \nawards  and  disbursements  are  significantly  behind  schedule.8 9 Therefore,  ADB  has  applied  a \nstrict  business  process  to  improve  the  performance  of  the  project.  A  concept  review  for  the \nadditional  financing  for  the  project  was  conducted  in  line  with  the  requirements  of  ADB \nOperations Manual.10 The review examined options for restructuring the project. It found that the \nneed to connect the  maintenance  depot  in  Nhon  to  a major  central  interchange through  line 3 \nmade  it  impractical  to  reduce  the  project  to  a  scale  that  could  be  covered  by  the  original \nfinancing.  Doing  so  would  result  in  a  significant  loss  of  benefits.  The  due  diligence  for  the \nadditional  financing  demonstrated  that  the  project  remains  technically  feasible.  It  remains \neconomically viable, with an economic internal rate of return of more than 12%. It has a financial \ninternal  rate  of  return  of  \u20131.22%,  below  the  weighted  cost  of  capital  of  0.70%.  HPC  has \ncommitted  to  maintaining  the  subsidy  necessary  to  make  the  project  financially  sustainable \nthroughout the metro system\u2019s life. Such a subsidy is the norm for most metro systems around \nthe world. \n \n \n10. \nCompliance with the loan\u2019s social covenants has been satisfactory, and compliance with \nthe  environmental  covenants  has  been  generally  satisfactory.  HPC  has  not  complied  with  the \nfinancial  covenants,  because  it  has  not  produced  audited  financial  statements  for  the \ncofinanciers\u2019  project  accounts  for  FY2012,  FY2013,  and  FY2014.  Initial  delays  in  LAR  have \nbeen  mitigated.  Resettlement  related  to  the  project\u2019s  depot  and  access  road  components  is \nnearing  completion,  and  resettlement  plans  for  the  underground  section  are  being  finalized. \nADB-cleared  environmental  monitoring  plans  have  been  incorporated  into  all  works  contracts, \nand  monitoring  reports  are  being  provided  and  disclosed.  Submission  of  the  audited  financial \nstatements for the original project for FY2012, FY2013, and FY2014 will be a condition for HPC \nto be able to withdraw from the ADF loan account, to ensure that the loan\u2019s financial covenants \nare  complied  with.  With  the  award  of  the  tunneling  contract,  the  overall  project  performance \nfrom  now  to  completion  is  expected  to  be  satisfactory  with  the  additional  financing.  The \nproposed loan for the additional financing is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan \nfor Viet Nam for 2015\u20132017.11  \n \nB. \n \nThe  aggregate  impact  and  outcome  of  the  project  will  not  change  with  the  additional \n11. \nfinancing.  The  impact  will  be  the  establishment  of  an  integrated,  sustainable  public  transport \nsystem in six districts of Ha Noi.12 The outcome will be the establishment of competitive metro \nrail services along the project line 3 corridor.  \n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n                                                \n7   Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n8   Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n9   ADB. 2011.

The  additional  financing  will  cover  the  additional  costs  of  developing  line  3  and  the \nconsulting  services  for  phase  2  PMS  to  further  improve  the  MRB\u2019s  implementation  and \noperations abilities. \n \nD. \n \n13. \nBased on the current euro\u2013US dollar exchange rate in August 2015, the original overall \nproject cost estimate was equivalent to $990.5 million. Due to expected increases in the costs of \nthe civil works and potential LAR, the project cost is now estimated to be equivalent to $1,375.7 \nmillion (Table 1).  \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan ($ million) \n\nCurrent \nAmounta \n\nAdditional \nFinancingb \n\nItem \nA.  \n \n\nBase Costc \n1.  \n\nMetro Line 3 construction \n\na.

Other  changes  from  the  original  financing  arrangements  have  been  recorded  in  the \nPAM  (footnote  7), for  which the  project  administration manual  has  been updated.  HPC  will  be \nthe  executing  agency  and  MRB  the  implementing  agency.  HPC  has  established  a  major \nprojects  steering  committee  for  metro  system  development.  It  is  chaired  by  the  HPC  vice-\nchairman,  who  is  responsible  for  project  oversight  and  coordination.  MRB  is  overseeing  the \nplanning, design, and implementation of the metro system.  \n \n20. \nTo  address  issues  hindering  project  performance,  ADB  and  the  PMS  consultants  have \nconducted  project  implementation  training  for  MRB  staff  on  project  management,  social  and \nenvironmental  safeguards,  and  financial  management.  MRB  has  also  gained  improved  skills \nand  knowledge  during \nthe  procurement  of  major  project  contract  packages.  Project \nperformance,  costs,  and  compliance  with  agreed  schedules  are  monitored  by  MRB  and  the \ncofinanciers in monthly project progress meetings and during project review missions. All project \ndocuments  are  disclosed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications  Policy  2011.  The \ncentral  government  has  also  agreed  to  provide  stronger  coordination  and  support  for  the \ndevelopment of the Ha Noi metro system through regular national steering committee meetings \nthat  are also attended  by  the  development  partners.  The  project  is  scheduled  to  be  physically \ncompleted by 30 June 2019, and the targeted additional loan closing date is 31 December 2019. \n \n21. \nADB,  AFD,  DGT,  and  the  EIB  will  inform  one  another  in  advance  of  any  missions, \nexplore  joint  participation  in  such  missions,  and  report  to  one  another  on  the  findings  of  the \nmissions and the progress of their respective project components. The cofinanciers agree that a \nsingle  process \nfor  social  and  environmental  assessment  and  planning,  safeguard \ndocumentation,  consultation,  and  disclosure  be  conducted  that  satisfies  both  their  own \nrequirements and those of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). ADB will be responsible \nfor  conducting  due  diligence,  reviewing  documents,  and  monitoring  project  activities  in \naccordance  with  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  will  share  all  documents  related  to  this \nprocess  with  the  cofinanciers.  AFD,  DGT,  and  EIB  will  conduct  the  due  diligence,  monitoring \nand document reviews, and supervision of activities that are not required by ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy Statement but may be required by the other cofinanciers. \n \n22. \nADB,  AFD,  DGT,  and  EIB  will  administer  their  respective  contracts  in  accordance  with \ntheir  own  policies  and  procedures.  The  cofinanciers  will  inform  one  another  promptly  of  any \nevent  that  interferes  or  threatens  to  interfere  with  the  processing  and  implementation  of  their \nrespective  loans.

After  the  award  of  remaining  major \n23. \ncontracts,  scheduled  by  the  end  of  2015,  the  project  is  expected  to  perform  satisfactorily  until \ncompletion. \n \nB. \n \n24. \nEconomic  analysis.  The  project  remains  economically  viable  despite  cost  increases \nand delays. The 2010 economic analysis was updated taking into account the actual (i) capital \ncosts,  (ii)  construction  schedule,  (iii)  changes  in  the  income  per  capita  in  Ha  Noi,  and  (iv) \ndifference between the 2009 and 2014 real dong\u2013US dollar exchange rates. The original traffic \nforecasts  were  assumed  to  have  been  achieved  5  years  later  than  anticipated  by  the  original \nanalysis.  The  revised  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  the  project  is  12.9%,  slightly  higher \nthan the original 12.7% estimate. \n \n25. \nFinancial  analysis.  The  project\u2019s  financial  internal  rate  of  return  is  \u20131.22%,  with  a \nweighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  0.70%.  Therefore,  the  project  is  not  considered  financially \nviable. Based on projected fare revenues, the project is expected to require a total subsidy over \nits life of $709 million, which subjects the project to a high financial sustainability risk. The large \namount of subsidy the government must provide over the long term as well as uncertainty over \nwhether  sufficient  expertise  will  be  available  to  properly  operate  and  maintain  the  rail  system \nafter construction puts a heavy burden on the government agencies.  \n \n26. \nTo  address  these  issues,  the  loan  agreements  include  covenants  requiring  the \npreparation  of  a  financial  management  and  sustainability  action  plan  (FMSAP).  The  plan  will \nseek  to  develop  alternative  models  for  revenue  generation  that  have  been  used  successfully \nelsewhere in the world to help finance public transit systems, including for example the sale of \nadvertising space in the metro stations, government surcharges on the price of fuel, as well as \ncredit  enhancement  mechanisms  (including  of  escrow  mechanisms  for  government  subsidies) \nand  give firm  recommendations  for  implementation  of  the  action  plan  by  the  government.  The \nplan will also examine how international private sector metro rail operators can be brought in to \nstrengthen the operations and maintenance functions once the project line goes into operation. \nThe government is determined to making all efforts to make the project sustainable. \n \nC. \n \n27. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government,  HPC,  and  MRB.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 7). A project integrity risk assessment determined \nthat  the  poor  project  performance  and  cost  increases  so  far  could  not  be  attributed  to  poor \n\nGovernance \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fPoverty and Social \n\ngovernance  or  corruption.  Project-related  governance  has  improved  at  both  the  national  and \nlocal  government  levels.  Financial  probity  has  increased,  and  national  legislation  covering \nfinancial  reporting  and  accounting  standards  has  improved.  However,  the  management  and \ninstitutional capacity of the MRB remains a concern.  \n \nD. \n \n28. \nThe better public transit system to be provided under the project will benefit all people in \nthe  areas  served  by  line  3,  especially  those  whose  mobility  is  restricted.  Among  the  prime \nbeneficiaries  will  be  workers  from  the  rural  and  suburban  areas,  women,  elderly  people,  and \nstudents,  all  of  whom  use  public  transport  more  than  other  groups.  The  gender  category  for \ncurrent  project  and  the  additional  project  financing  is  effective  gender  mainstreaming. \nImplementation  of  the  project\u2019s gender  action  plan  has  been  delayed  but  has  slowly  improved \nsince the MRB mobilized a full-time gender specialist in July 2015 to monitor it.  \n\n \nSafeguards \n\nE. \n \n29. \nNo  additional  environmental,  resettlement,  or  indigenous  peoples\u2019  impacts  will  result \nfrom  the  additional  financing.  The  project\u2019s  physical  scope  remains  the  same,  and  all \nsafeguards documents prepared for the current project will remain in effect. The project with the \nadditional financing will continue to be considered category C for all safeguards. \n \n\n1. \n\nInvoluntary Resettlement \n\n \nA draft resettlement plan for the line 3 works was prepared in 2011. ADB approved an \n30. \nupdated  resettlement  plan  for  the  depot  and  the  access  line  in  February  2014.  Compensation \npayments  were  completed  in  January  2015.  ADB  conducted  a  due  diligence  review  of  the \nresettlement activities during February\u2013April 2015. The review concluded that the compensation \nand  assistance  provided  to  affected  households,  the  consultations  with  affected  persons,  and \nthe  grievance  redress  procedures  generally  followed  the  provisions  in  the  resettlement  plan. \nThe  decision  for  forced  land  recovery  followed  the  procedures  provided  by  the  government\u2019s \nexisting  regulations.  An  updated  resettlement  plan  was  approved  by  ADB  in  August  2015  to \ncover  the  impacts  of  development  of  line  3\u2019s  underground  section.  This  followed  an  updating \nand  improvement  of  entitlements  for  the  affected  households,  as  well  as  consultations  and \nsurveys. The payment of compensation and provision of assistance to affected households is a \nprecondition  for  the  start  of  the  underground  section  civil  works.  An  addendum  to  the \nresettlement  plan  will  be  needed  once  the  impacts  of  work  on  the  tunnel  section  have  been \nverified  by the  civil  works  contractor.  Internal  and  external  monitoring  of resettlement  activities \nfor the entire alignment on line 3 is being conducted. \n \n\n2. \n\nEnvironment \n\n \n31. \nADB conducted an environmental due diligence review of ongoing works in March 2015. \nIt  found  the  construction  sites  to  be  generally  tidy  and  organized.  Security  personnel  were \nassigned  at  the  construction  site,  and  the  public  was  denied  access  to  the  area.  The  workers \nwere using proper protective equipment and were provided with satisfactory facilities. Disposal \nsites  for  hazardous  materials  had  been  allocated  and  approved  by  the  relevant  authorities. \nDespite  some  noise  generated  by  project  vehicles  on  some  nights,  no  major  environmental \nissues  were  observed.  In  May  2015,  however,  two  accidents  occurred  at  the  construction  site \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\finvolving the operation of heavy equipment.14 These incidents resulted from noncompliance with \nthe  project\u2019s  safety  requirements \nthe  site-specific  environmental \nmanagement  plans.  MRB  has  addressed  the  issues  by  instructing  the  contractors  to  prepare \nand implement preventive and corrective action plans. The construction supervision consultant \nis  carefully  monitoring  the  implementation  of  the  contractor\u2019s  method  statements  as  well  as \nconducting regular safety training sessions and supervising the corrective actions.  \n\nthat  are \n\nincluded \n\nin \n\n \nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nF. \n\nThe  risk  category  for  the  additional  loan  is  complex  because  ADB\u2019s  overall  financing \n32. \nexceeds $200 million and project progress has been slow. The individual risks were assessed, \nand  the  overall  project  risk  was  rated  medium.    The  assessment  found  the  limited  financial \nmanagement  capacity  of  MRB  and  the  uncertainty  over  the  project\u2019s  financial  sustainability  to \npose  the  highest  risks.  The  major  project  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in \nTable 4 and detailed in the risk assessment and risk management plan.15 Overall, benefits and \npositive impacts are expected to outweigh any mitigation costs. \n\n \nTable 4: Summary of Major Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nLack of government policy support \nfor modal shift from use of private \nvehicles to use of public transport. \n\nCosts increase more than expected \nand the project is delayed.  \n\nLocal government approvals of LAR \nactivities are delayed.  \n\nThe  government,  HPC,  and  MRB  will  (i)  prepare \nfuture \nprojections for use of public transport and approve implementing \nrules for the modal shift, and (ii) the cofinanciers will support the \nimplementation  of  policy  measures  with  adequate  refinancing \nand improvement of HPC\u2019s and MRB\u2019s capacity through training. \nto  support  project \nInternational  experts  will  be  engaged \nmanagement.
