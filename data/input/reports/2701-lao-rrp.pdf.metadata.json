INTRODUCTION\n2. Laos is one of the least economically developed\nmember countries of the Bank. As a landlocked country\nwith a lack of both basic infrastructure and sufficient\nresources, the development efforts of Laos face significant\nconstraints. Traditional agriculture based on family\ncultivation of small farms provides subsistence living for\nclose to 80 per cent of the total population which is\nestimated at 2.8 million.\n3. Agricultural productivity is very low with paddy\nyields averaging only about one ton per hectare. The\ncurrent arable area of the country (7 per cent of the total\narea) consists mostly of river valleys, which are cultivated\nonly during the rainy season, remaining unused for lack of\nirrigation water during the dry season. Laos imports a\nconsiderable part of her food requirements as well as most\nmanufactured and industrial goods. Annual imports of rice\nare estimated to be close to 50,000 tons. The foreign\ntrade position of the country has shown a persistent defi-\ncit on the current account over the last ten years.\n4. Long-term economic planning and coordinated deve-\nlopment is of recent origin in the country. A royal ordi-\nnance of March 1969 promulgated the 5-year development\nplan for 1969-1974. The plan attaches high priority to the\ndevelopment of the social, infrastructure and productive\nsectors. In the field of agriculture, the development of\nintensive irrigation projects with double cropping and the\napplication of better farming techniques has been emphasized,", "-2-\nthe aim being to make the country self-sufficient in rice\nand other food and vegetable crops. Emphasis is also placed\non the production of cash crops for export, such as coffee\nand tobacco.\n5. The Government in 1965, established the Agricul.\ntural Development Organization (ADO) as a joint Lao-USAID\norganization to assist in supplying farm inputs and to\nprovide marketing facilities and short-term credit to the\nfarmers. Distribution of better seeds, fertilizer, trac-\ntors and water pumps has been undertaken by this organiza-\ntion with the result that, in certain localized parts of\nthe Vientiane Plain, paddy yields have increased from the\ncurrent average of one ton to three and more per hectare.\n6. The Government of Laos has already been the re\"L-\npient of a technical assistance program from the Bank. An\nagreement approved by the Board on October 15, 1968 resul-\nted in the identification of eight irrigation projects with\na total net irrigable area of close to 34,000 hectares in\nthe Vientiane Plain. These projects, of which Tha Ngon is\none, will use the water of the Nam Ngum and the Mekong\nRivers by pump irrigation. Electric power for these pumps\nis to be provided by the Nam Ngum Dam which is scheduled\nfor completion by early 1972. Among the agricultural\nprojects identified for development, the Tha Ngon Project\nhas been accorded the highest priority both by the Govern-\nment and by the technical assistance mission of the Bank\nwhich submitted its study on the \"Integrated Agricultural\nDevelopment Programme for the Vientiane Plain\" in January\n1970. Copies of this Report have been circulated to\nmembers for information.\n7. The Vientiane Plain is the most populated and\nsocially and politically important area of Laos. The Tha\nNgon Project as appraised by the Bank will provide a unique\nopportunity to demonstrate to a large number of farmers the\nmodern farming techniques that may be employed in other\nirrigation projects in the Vientiane Plain as well as in\nother parts of the country.\n8. In response to the Government request, the\nproject was studied in the Bank and appraised in the field", "-3-.\non the basis of a revised feasibility report prepared by\nthe Overseas Technical Cooperation Agency (OTCA) of Japan\nin March 1969. In addition, the Bank's consultants'\nreport on the Vientiane Plain was also taken into conside-\nration. Subsequent to the appraisal of the project, it was\nfound that, in order to improve the technical soundness\nof the project, certain adjustments in the costs envisaged\nwould be essential and the Government of Laos has requested\nfrom the Bank a loan in an amount of US$973,000.\n9. In view of  the shortage of engineers and other\ntrained personnel in the country, the Government has also\nrequested the Bank for a technical assistance grant up to\nan amount not exceeding US$275,000 to provide for engi-\nneering, supervisory and training services for the execution\nof the project during the three-year construction period..\n10. Formal negotiations for the proposed loan and\ntechnical assistance grant were held in Vientiane from 28\nJanuary to 5 February 1970. The Government of Laos was\nrepresented by Messrs. Pane Rassavong, Commissioner\nGeneral of Plan (as chief of team), Bouaphat Chanthapanya,\nDirecteur General de l'Economie Nationale, Souvanthong\nPhenglamphanh, Directeur du Budget et du Controle, Tiao\nSomsavath Vongkoth, Directeur de 1 'Agriculture, Bounphet\nThavonekham, Directeur des Etudes de la Banque de\nDevelopment du Laos, Tougeu Lyfoung, Directeur General\nde la Justice.\nII.

The cost of this\ntechnical assistance is estimated at up to US$275,000\nand can be accommodated within the current Technical\nAssistance Budget of the Bank.", "-5-\nIII. THE PROJECT\n13. A report entitled \"Arpraisal of the Tha Ngon\nAgricultural Project in Laos\" is attached (Report No.\nLao-AP-l).\n14. The Project involves joint financing and technical\nassistance programs by the Government of Japan and the Asian\nDevelopment Bank to the Royal Government of Laos. Tha\nNgon is also the first integrated agricultural project in\nLaos and as such represents a pioneering effort.\n15. The objective of the Project is to develop for\nyear-round irrigated farming an area of about 1,000 has.\nThe construction of flood protection and drainage systems,\nirrigation networks, roads, power distribution and trans-\nmission lines and the settlement of about 400 farm families\nare included in the Project. Total construction costs are\nestimated at US$1,957,000 of which US$1,503,000 represents\nforeign exchange and US$454,000 equivalent local currency.\nIn addition to the financial assistance requested from the\nBank (a loan of US$973,000 and technical assistance of\nUS$275,000), the Government of Laos is expected to receive\non a grant basis US$255,000 of foreign exchange cost and\nUS$373,000 local currency equivalent contributions from the\nGovernment of Japan. The Laotian Government will contribute\nUS$60,000 equivalent in local currency toward the construc-\ntion cost and up to US$50,000 equivalent in counterpart\ncontribution for the local cost of the Bank consultants\nduring the three-year construction period. Assurances of\nthese contributions have been obtained from the Government.\n16. Execution of the Project will be the responsibility\nof the Development Agency for the Vientiane Plain and\ninterministerial coordination will be effected through\nthe Technical Committee for Regional Development of the\nNational Planning Council. The Development Agency will\nhave its own budget and staff and draft proposals for its\nestablishment have been submitted to the Cabinet. The\nengineering consultants to be provided under the technical\nassistance program will be attached to this Agency. All\nGovernment departments and agencies concerned with agri-\ncultural development will be represented on the Technical", "\u20221\nCommittee and in the Agency itself. A Project Director\ndelegated by the Development Agency will be immediately\nresponsible for the executinn of construction works and\nthe implementation of the development programme in the\nProject area. The Government has made commitments to\nprovide the Project Director with the required number of\nfield staff and necessary funds.\n17. The Project, as planned, should enable the farmers\nto achieve substantial increases in the production of paddy\nand other crops. It will assist farmers in adopting im-\nproved farming practices, double cropping and the applica-\ntion of modern and scientific farm inputs. A pilot demons-\ntration farm of about 100 hectares will be established\nwithin the Project area. An implementation program for\nthe pilot farm has been prepared by OTCA in December 1969\nunder which the on-farm investment needs of the pilot farm\nand the cost of maintaining the required technical personnel\nfor an initial period of 5 years will be met by the Govern-\nment of Japan. Six technical experts and 12 volunteers\nwill be provided for agricultural advisory and extension\nservices for the pilot farm and the Project area. The\nentire foreign exchange cost of US$860,000 and the major\npart of the local currency cost (US$208,000) of the pilot\nfarm and initial farm investment will be financed on a grant\nbasis by the Government of Japan.\n18. A multi-purpose agricultural cooperative (involving\ncompulsory membership for all the farmers in the area) will\nbe established to assist in marketing, the provision of\ncredit facilities and the collection of water charges for\nthe Project. This will be the first attempt by the Govern-\nment to set up such a farmers association and to collect\nwater charges. The Government has decided that water\ncharges, without impairing the incentive of the farmers,\nwill be collected for all operation and maintenance costs of\nthe Project. Part of the investment cost will also be\ncollected after farmers' incomes have risen sufficiently\nto justify such collections.\n19. After full settlement, the project will benefit\nover 2,000 people (some 400 families). On a farm size of\n2 hectares, gross farmers income should amount to approxi-", "-7-\nmately US$860 after the fifth year of project implementa-\ntion. After full payment for operation and maintenance and\na significant contribution towards anortization, farmers'\nincome should still be twice the current average income\nrealized by farmers on traditional 3-hectare farms in the\nVientiane Plain. Training for irrigation construction,\nwater management and extension will also be provided for\na large number of natinnal counterparts.\n20. The Project is expected to yield annually after\nthe fifth year of operation 8,300 tons of paddy and close\nto 2,000 tons of vegetables, which would currently be\nvalued at US$560,000. Since the Vientiane Plain is a food\ndeficit area and is largely supplied by imports, the\nProject will result in considerable foreign exchange savings.\n21. For the economic evaluation, all construction and\noperating costs and the value added on the agricultural side\nwere considered. Inspite of the heavy initial investment\ncosts, the benefit-cost ratio of the project is 1.25 and\n0.96 at rates of discount of 8 and 10 per cent, respectively,\nwith the economic rate of return approximately 9.75 per\ncent. In view of the particularly difficult situation of\nthe country and its urgent need for productive development\nthese evaluation results although low adequately justify\nthe Project on economic grounds. The training and demons-\ntration aspects of the project which will generate subs-\ntantial indirect social and economic benefits in the future\nare an additional, and may be even greater, justification.\n22. Laos is in early stage of economic development.\nWith heavy balance of payments pressures, a weak economic\nbasis and the fact that its per capita income is one of\nthe lowest of the ADB member countries and taking also\ninto consideration the gestation period of the project, the\nproposed financial assistance on the softest possible terms\nis, in my opinion, fully justified.\n23. Procurement will be undertaken in accordance with\nthe arrangements to be made by the Bank regarding eligible\ncountries for procurement, the advertising procedures in\nsuch countries and the appropriate certification of origin\nin accordance with available special funds resources. The\nconsultants provided under the Technical Assistance Agree-\nment will assist the government in procurement matters.", "-8-\nIV. LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY\n24. The draft Technical Assistance and Loan Agreements\nbetween the Borrower and the Bank and the related Side\nLetters are circulated herewith. By provision of Section\n1.01 of the draft Loan Agreement, the Bank ? s Special\nOperations Loan Regulation dated 6 May 1969 is made part of\nthe Loan Agreement. Apart from the usual conditions of the\nI effectiveness of the Loan Agreement provided in Section\n8.01 of the said Regulations, the execution and delivery\nof the Agreement between the Government of Japan and Laos\nconcerning the pilot farm is an additional requirement\nbefore the loan becomes effective.\n25. A general \"Ordonnance-loi\" authorizing the government\nto borrow from the Bank for the implementation of the\nprojects included in its \"Plan Cadre\" will be submitted to\nthe approval of the \"Bureau Permanent de l'Assemblee Natio-\nnale\" while the National Assembly is not in session and\nprior to the signing of the Loan. The aforementioned\n\"Ordonnance-loi\" and the duly completed loan documents will\nbe submitted for approval and ratification by the National\nAssembly prior to the effective date of the loan.\nV. THE ECONOMY\n26. A report entitled \"The Economic Report on the\nKingdom of Laos, (Report No. LAO:EC-1) has been circulated\nseparately.\n27. The Laotian economy continues to comprise a large\nnon-monetized sector (about 85 per cent) with recent trends\nindicating a relatively rapid growth rate of the monetized\npart of the economy. The export earnings position of the\ncountry has improved substantially over the past two years,\nalthough the trade deficit remains high. In spite of heavy\nbalance of payment pressures and persistent budget deficits,\nthe national currency, mainly through the effort of aid-\ngiving countries, has maintained a fairly stable value.\nThe Government is attempting to increase its revenue from\ndomestic sources and new tax proposals and reforms are\nunder consideration.", "28. Agriculture will remain the mainstay of the economy\nfor a long time to come. Within the frame work of the\nnational planning efforts and under bilateral aid, serious\nattempts are being made to improve farming techniques and\nto settle large numbers of refugees in newly-developed\nareas. The higher yields recently achieved through the\nintroduction of better inputs are encouraging. Certain\nindications of accelerated development are apparent, but\nthe continued internal civil strife exerts a heavy pressure\non the limited resources of the country and a threat to\ncoordinated development activities. In the determined\nefforts of the Government to initiate and execute specific\nprojects, the assistance of the Bank for Tha Ngon will\nrepresent a significant contribution to the development\nof the country.\nVI. COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT\n29. I am satisfied that the proposed assistance would\ncomply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank.\nVII. RECO1MENDAT IONS\n30. I recommend that the Board approve the proposed\nfinancial assistance in the terms of the following\nresolution:\n\"Approval of financial assistance to the\nKingdom of Laos for the Tha Ngon Agricul-\ntural Development Project in an aggregate\namount equivalent to One Million Two\nHundred Forty Eight Thousand United States\nDollars (US$1,248,000) .\"\nRESOLVED:\nThat the Bank shall grant:\n(i) a loan from its Special Fund\nresources to the Kingdom of Laos in an amount\nin various currencies equivalent to Nine", "-10\u2022-\nHundred Seventy Three Thousand United\nStates Dollars (US$973,000) to mature on\nNovember 1, 2009 and to bear interest\n(including service fee at the rate of 314\nof 1 per cent) at the rate of one and one-\nhalf per cent per annum and to be upon such\nother terms and conditions as shall be subs-\ntantially in accordance with the terms and\nconditions set forth in the form of Special\nOperations Loan Agreement between the Kingdom\nof Laos and the Bank which has been presented\nto this meeting;\n(ii) a technical assistance grant to\nLaos in an amount not exceeding the equivalent\nof Two Hundred Seventy Five Thousand United\nStates Dollars (US$275,000) and to be upon such\nterms and conditions as shall be substantially\nin accordance with the terms and conditions\nset forth in the form of Technical Assistance\nAgreement between the Royal Government of Laos\nand the Bank which has been presented to this\nmeeting.\nTAKESHI WATANABE\nPresident", "ciiY1\nMAST[R \nRESTR ICTED\nRRP-27 : LAO\n'This Report has been prepared\n'for the exclusive_use of the Bank'\nAS IAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS\nOF THE\nPRESIDENT TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\nONA\nPROPOSED LOAN AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THE\nKINGDOM OF LAOS\n10 February 1970", "REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE\nBOARD OF DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN AND\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THE KINGDOM\nOF lAOS\n1.

The\nconsultants provided under the Technical Assistance Agree-\nment will assist the government in procurement matters.", "-8-\nIV. LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY\n24. The draft Technical Assistance and Loan Agreements\nbetween the Borrower and the Bank and the related Side\nLetters are circulated herewith. By provision of Section\n1.01 of the draft Loan Agreement, the Bank ? s Special\nOperations Loan Regulation dated 6 May 1969 is made part of\nthe Loan Agreement. Apart from the usual conditions of the\nI effectiveness of the Loan Agreement provided in Section\n8.01 of the said Regulations, the execution and delivery\nof the Agreement between the Government of Japan and Laos\nconcerning the pilot farm is an additional requirement\nbefore the loan becomes effective.\n25. A general \"Ordonnance-loi\" authorizing the government\nto borrow from the Bank for the implementation of the\nprojects included in its \"Plan Cadre\" will be submitted to\nthe approval of the \"Bureau Permanent de l'Assemblee Natio-\nnale\" while the National Assembly is not in session and\nprior to the signing of the Loan. The aforementioned\n\"Ordonnance-loi\" and the duly completed loan documents will\nbe submitted for approval and ratification by the National\nAssembly prior to the effective date of the loan.\nV. THE ECONOMY\n26. A report entitled \"The Economic Report on the\nKingdom of Laos, (Report No. LAO:EC-1) has been circulated\nseparately.\n27. The Laotian economy continues to comprise a large\nnon-monetized sector (about 85 per cent) with recent trends\nindicating a relatively rapid growth rate of the monetized\npart of the economy. The export earnings position of the\ncountry has improved substantially over the past two years,\nalthough the trade deficit remains high. In spite of heavy\nbalance of payment pressures and persistent budget deficits,\nthe national currency, mainly through the effort of aid-\ngiving countries, has maintained a fairly stable value.\nThe Government is attempting to increase its revenue from\ndomestic sources and new tax proposals and reforms are\nunder consideration.", "28. Agriculture will remain the mainstay of the economy\nfor a long time to come. Within the frame work of the\nnational planning efforts and under bilateral aid, serious\nattempts are being made to improve farming techniques and\nto settle large numbers of refugees in newly-developed\nareas. The higher yields recently achieved through the\nintroduction of better inputs are encouraging. Certain\nindications of accelerated development are apparent, but\nthe continued internal civil strife exerts a heavy pressure\non the limited resources of the country and a threat to\ncoordinated development activities. In the determined\nefforts of the Government to initiate and execute specific\nprojects, the assistance of the Bank for Tha Ngon will\nrepresent a significant contribution to the development\nof the country.\nVI. COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT\n29. I am satisfied that the proposed assistance would\ncomply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank.\nVII. RECO1MENDAT IONS\n30.
