An initial environmental examination was undertaken. (A \nsummary is in Appendix 10.) \n \n\n \nEnvironmental \nAssessment \n \nProject Description  With the Project, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will  continue its \nsupport  of  and  commitment  to  regional  cooperation,  particularly  in \ninformation  and  communication \nthe \nSubregional  Economic  Cooperation  (SASEC)  Program,  which  covers \nBangladesh,  Bhutan,  India,  and  Nepal.  The  SASEC  ICT  Working \nGroup  (ICTWG)  established  in  2003,  has  identified  three  most  urgent \nareas  for  improvements  in  ICT  in  the  subregion:  (i)  cross-border \nconnectivity,  (ii) rural  access  to  information,  and  (iii)  human  resource \ncapacity. To meet these needs, the SASEC countries have developed \nthe concept of the SASEC information highway, to deliver and facilitate \nmodern  broadband \ninformation,  communication,  and  knowledge \nservices  within  and  across  borders  to  governments,  businesses, \nresearch institutes, and rural and remote communities. \n \nTo  support  the  SASEC  information  highway  initiative,  the  Project  has \nthree  components:  (i)  a  SASEC  regional  network  with  fiber-optic  and \ndata \nfour  SASEC \ncountries;  (ii)  a  SASEC  village  network  expanding  broadband  ICT \naccess  to  110  rural  communities  in  the  SASEC  countries  and  directly \nconnecting  the  communities  for  local  networking  and  information \nsourcing;  and  (iii)  a  SASEC  research  and  training  network  building \ntechnical  and  business  skills  in  ICT,  particularly  in  developing  local \ncontent  and  e-applications \n(such  as  e-government,  e-learning, \ntele-medicine, e-remittance, e-commerce) for the needs of the poor. \n \nThere is great diversity among the SASEC countries, with each country \nat  a  quite  different  stage  of  ICT  development  and  with  different \nobjectives and circumstances. Bhutan has less than one million people \nand little ICT experience, while India has more than one billion people \nand substantial ICT achievements. This diversity presents considerable \nopportunities for cooperation.  \n \nCross-border  connectivity  is  recognized  as  a  critical  area  in  need  of \nregional  cooperation,  as  ICT  infrastructure  across  borders  has  been \n\ninterchange  capacity,  directly  connecting \n\n \nRationale \n\nthe \n\n \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \n\nthis  reason, \n\ntransmission.  For \n\nInternet  connections \n\nfragmentally  developed  and  is  often  outdated.  For  example,  Internet \ntraffic in the subregion often goes via third parties, and overly relies on \nsatellite \nin \nlandlocked countries like Bhutan and Nepal are much more costly and \nlower  in  quality.  On  the  other  hand,  Bangladesh  and  India,  despite \nbeing connected to major submarine cables, do not yet fully capitalize \non  the  business  potential  to  provide  high-quality,  affordable,  and \nreliable  broadband  capacity  to  neighboring  countries.  Regionally \nintegrated  and  high-quality  broadband  capacity  would  not  only  keep \nlocal  traffic  local  and  optimize  the  cost  of  interconnection  within  the \nregion but also contribute to reducing the prices of ICT services to end \nusers and boosting ICT use across borders. \n \nBridging  the  rural-urban  divide  in  ICT  is  another  area  for  regional \ncooperation.  Commercially  driven  ICT  development  has  left  rural \npeople  behind  and  widened  the  disparity  between  rural  and  urban \nareas. Rural community e-centers (CECs) have been tested and have \nproved effective in addressing this issue. India\u2019s rural CEC models and \nBangladesh\u2019s  Grameen  village  phone  are  pioneering  and  innovative \nexamples of the use of ICT in reducing poverty in the countryside. The \nCEC movement in India has evolved into a national initiative, with the \nprospect of Internet connectivity in every village. Grameen Telecom in \nBangladesh  is  now  a  major  mobile  operator  and  has  extended  the \napplication  of  its  microfinance  model  to  Internet  village  kiosks  in  rural \nareas.  CECs  have  been  tried  out  for  some  years  in  Nepal  and  more \nrecently in Bhutan, but these experiments have yet to reach nationwide \nscale,  under  government  or  private  leadership.  A  regional  approach \nwould enhance the efforts of the SASEC countries to bridge the digital \ndivide  by  sharing  their  experiences  and  connecting  rural  communities \nwith one another and with the rest of the world, and ultimately with the \nvast source of information, content, and services that is the Internet. \n \nThe  need  for  more  and  higher-quality  training  in  ICT  and  for \nheightened ICT literacy and awareness has been expressed by all the \nSASEC countries including India, where ICT development has created \nmillions  of  jobs  over  the  past  few  decades.  All  these  countries \nrecognize  the  relationship  between  good-quality  tertiary  training  and \nresearch,  on  the  one  hand,  and  staff  retention  and  ultimate  industry \ndevelopment,  on  the  other.  At  present,  except  in  certain  public  and \nprivate  institutions  of  excellence,  many  ICT  training  initiatives  do  not \nmeet  international  quality  standards.  India  may  have  trained  a  large \npool of skilled human resources in the ICT sector, but it still needs to \nmaintain and upgrade the quality of its human resources to sustain its \ncompetitive  edge  in  ICT  in  the  global  market.  The  other  SASEC \ncountries  are  more  seriously  constrained  when  it  comes  to  mobilizing \nqualified  human  resources  for  ICT.  A  regional  approach  to  building \nhuman  capacity  through  shared  resources  would  enable  the  SASEC \ncountries to capitalize on the digital opportunities as a group. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\niii\n\n \nProject Investment \nPlan  \n \nFinancing Plan \n\nImpact and Outcome  The Project will enhance the benefits of ICT and regional cooperation \nfor inclusive growth and poverty reduction by increasing the supply of \naffordable  broadband,  skilled  ICT  manpower,  and  local  content  and \ne-applications particularly for the needs of the poor. It is also expected \nto  help  the  SASEC  countries  improve  their  productivity  and  efficiency \nand participate fully in the global information economy.  \n \nThe  project  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $24.0  million,  including \ntaxes and duties of $2.7 million.  \n \nADB grants of $4.7 million to Bhutan and $9.0 million to Nepal, and a \nloan  of  $3.1  million  to  Bangladesh  from  Special  Funds  resources  will \nfinance  70%  of  the  project  cost.  The  governments  of  the  SASEC \ncountries  will  finance  $7.2  million,  or  30%.  The  Asian  Development \nFund (ADF) loan to Bangladesh will be denominated in special drawing \nrights,  and  will  have  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of \n8 years,  and  an  interest  rate  of  1%  per  year  during  the  grace  period \nand 1.5% after that.  \n \n31 December 2009 \n \n \n1 April 2008\u250030 June 2010 \n\n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nPeriod of Grant and \nLoan Utilization \n \nExecuting Agencies  Ministry of Science and Information and Communication Technology of \nBangladesh;  Ministry  of  Information  and  Communication  of  Bhutan; \nDepartment  of  Information  Technology,  Ministry  of  Communications \nand  Information  Technology,  of  India;  and  Ministry  of  Information  and \nCommunications of Nepal. \n \nThe  three  networks  under  the  Project\u2014a  regional  network,  a  village \nnetwork, and a research and training network\u2014will be built and run by \nprivate  sector  service  agencies  to be  selected  from  eligible  providers, \nthrough public-private partnerships (PPPs) developed and modified on \nthe basis of PPP practices in India and elsewhere.  \n \nFor the regional network, each country will select a service agency with \na  national  fiber-optic  network  and  an  international  long-distance \nlicense,  to  build,  keep,  manage,  and  operate  the  network  and \nequipment  as  designed,  built,  and  installed.  The  operation  of  the \nvillage  network  (including  CECs)  and  the  provision  of  minimum \nservices to the poor will be franchised through auction, lease, or other \nappropriate  means  to  private  entrepreneurs  among  rural  Internet \nservice  providers  (ISPs)  or  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs), \nwhich will be provided with financial support to ensure the sustainability \nof  the  village  network.  For  the  research  and  training  network,  service \nagencies  in  each  country  will  be  selected  from  capable  ICT  research\n \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\n \nProcurement \n\ninstitutes  including  universities,  to  design  and  conduct  research  and \ntraining for ICT professional development. Several agreements will be \ndrawn  up  and  signed:  (i)  a  multilateral  cooperation  agreement,  to  be \nsigned  by  the  executing  agencies  (EAs)  for  all  the  SASEC  countries; \n(ii) six bilateral interconnection agreements, each one to be signed by \nthe regional network service agencies of the two countries concerned; \nand  (iii) 12  in-country  service  agency  agreements,  each  one  to  be \nsigned by the EA and the service agency for each of the three project \nnetworks. \n \nA  steering  committee,  consisting  of  the  secretaries  of  the  EAs  for  the \nfour  countries,  will  be  formed  to  jointly  supervise  and  monitor  overall \nproject implementation. It will also guide the project management units \n(PMUs)  in  coordinating  joint  activities,  and  will  clear  the  draft \nagreements for signing. Each PMU, to be established under each EA, \nwill  be  headed  by  a  project  director  (joint  secretary)  and  will  have  as \nmembers a technical expert (project manager), an administrative staff, \nand a representative of the service agency. It will be responsible for the \nday-to-day  implementation  of  the  Project  in  coordination  with  project \nmanagement  consultants.  The  PMU  will  (i)  recruit  the  country  project \nmanagement  consultants  in  consultation  with  ADB;  (ii)  supervise  and \nmonitor  the  work  of  these  consultants;  (iii)  maintain  project  accounts \n(including the imprest account), endorse the invoices presented by the \nproject management consultants, and prepare withdrawal requests for \npayments  to  contractors;  (iv)  prepare  the  statement  of  expenditure  in \nsupport of requests for imprest account replenishment, and prepare the \nyearly  financial  statement  for  the  Project  and  have  it  audited  by  an \nexternal  auditor;  and  (v) report  each  month  on  the  progress  of  the \nimplementation to the steering committee and ADB. \n \nThe  goods,  services,  and  civil  works  to  be  financed  under  the  ADB \ngrants  and  loan  will  be  procured  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Civil  works  and \nsystem  development  and  installation  contracts  will  be  procured \naccording to the procurement plan (see Appendix 6).  \n \nAny  necessary  modifications  or  clarifications  of  recipient  procurement \nprocedures will be documented in the procurement plan. \n \nProject  management  equipment  for  the  PMU  will  be  procured  by  the \nproject  management  consultants  according  to  the  procurement  plan \n(see Appendix 6).  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nthe  advance \n\nConsulting Services  Project  management  consultants  will  be  hired  to  assist  the  EA  in \nimplementing  the  Project.  There  will  be  an  international  team  (team \nleader, design engineer, and procurement specialist) and four country \nteams. Each country team will have three subteams: a SASEC regional \nnetwork  team,  a  village  network/research  and  training  network  team, \nand  a  joint  team.  The  first  two  subteams  will  each  comprise  a  team \nleader,  a  design  engineer,  a  procurement  specialist,  and  a  network \nengineer. The joint team will consist of a social development specialist, \nan  environment  specialist,  and  a  quality  assurance  specialist.  An \ninternational  consulting  firm  will  be  hired  for  36  person-months,  and \nnational  consulting  firms,  for  100  person-months  each  in  Bangladesh, \nBhutan,  and  Nepal,  and  63  person-months  in  India.  The  project \nmanagement  consultants  will  (i)  design  all  networks  to  be  procured \nunder  the  Project;  (ii)  prepare  bid  documents;  (iii)  assist  the  PMU  in \ntendering \n(prequalification,  evaluation  of  proposals,  etc.);  and \n(iv) supervise contractors. \n \nThe  project  management  consultants  will  be  selected  and  hired \naccording  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as \namended  from  time  to  time)  and  through  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection  (80:20)  and  simplified  technical  proposal.  ADB  will  consider \napproving \nthe \nunderstanding  that  such  action  will  not  necessarily  commit  ADB  to \nfinancing the Project.  \n \nThe  Project  is  expected  to  have  an  overall  economic  internal  rate  of \nreturn of 34.3%. The direct tangible benefits will come from (i) savings \naccruing  to  Nepal  and  Bhutan  on  the  cost  of  connecting  to  Internet \nservice  as  a  result  of  the  shift  from  expensive  satellite  links  to  cable \nlanding  stations  (CLSs)  made  possible  by  the  SASEC  regional \nnetwork,  and  (ii) incremental  revenues  to  be  earned  by  India  and \nBangladesh  from  payments  by  Nepal  and  Bhutan  for  the  CLS \nconnection.  Improved  and  more  affordable  broadband  access  to  the \nInternet resulting from the Project will also boost the development and \nconsumption  of  ICT  and  thereby  increase  economic  productivity  and \nefficiency.  \n \nPoverty is often found to be significantly related to a lack of knowledge \nand information; ICT can make such knowledge and information more \naccessible.  Rural  poverty  rates  in  the  SASEC  countries  range  from \n20% (India) to 42% (Bhutan), and amount to 40% in Bangladesh and \n35%  in  Nepal.  More  than  two  thirds  of  the  rural  population  in  these \ncountries  subsists  on  agriculture  (including  livestock)  and  forestry. \nRural  farming  relies  on  rudimentary  and  outdated  information  and \noffers  limited  opportunities  to  market  agricultural  products.  Rural \nchildren  attend  school  with  greater  difficulty \ntheir  urban \ncounterparts,  stay  for  shorter  periods,  leave  with  fewer  qualifications, \nand are less likely to proceed to further education, whether technical or \nhigher  education.  Public  services,  including  health  care  and  finance, \nare usually centered in urban areas. \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\nrecruitment  of  consultants  on \n\nthan \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \nTechnical \nAssistance \n\nisolated  by  physical  distance  and  poor \nUnderserved  and \ntransportation,  rural  people  are  even  more  marginalized.  The  Project \nwill  help  address  such  challenges  by  improving  rural  ICT  connectivity \nand  human  capacity  to  use  the  vast  information  and  knowledge \nresources and e-services in agriculture, marketing, employment, health \ncare,  education,  and  government  that  are  available  on  the  Internet. \nThe  Project  will  also  enable  the  integration  of  rural  communities  for \nlocal  networking  and  local  information  sourcing,  giving  them  better \nopportunities  to  create  and  use  knowledge  for  greater  empowerment \nand improved livelihood. \n \nThe  successful  implementation  and  operation  of  the  project  facilities \nwill depend largely on multilateral and bilateral agreements among the \nSASEC  countries.  Any  difficulty  or  procrastination  in  signing  those \nagreements  will  delay  or  otherwise  hamper  the  implementation  and \noperation  of  the  facilities.  ADB\u2019s  continued  support  for  the  SASEC \nICTWG will facilitate the signing of the agreements. \n \nTaking  on  the  social  responsibility  of  serving  the  rural  communities \ncould render the operation of the SASEC village network and research \nand  training  network  financially  unviable,  at  least  in  part.  To  mitigate \nthis  financial  risk,  franchises  will  be  granted  to  private  entrepreneurs \nsuch as rural ISPs and ICT research institutes to run the networks as \ncommercial  and  social  operations.  A  financial  resource  pool  with \ncontributions from the service agencies in the SASEC regional network \nwill  provide  needed  financial  support  for  the  social  responsibility \nfunctions  of  these  agencies.  ADB  will  ensure  effective  franchising  of \nthe  operations  of  the  village  and  research  and  training  networks,  to \nmaximize the benefits of public-private partnership.  \n \nThe price for connecting to CLSs in India is competitively determined in \nthe market. But a market price for the service is yet to be established \nfor  Bangladesh.  ADB  will  collaborate  closely  with  the  EA  and  the \ntelecommunications regulator in Bangladesh in setting an optimal rate \nfor the operation of the SASEC regional network.  \n \nThe Project will be complemented by an attached TA, which will build \nup  technical  and  business  skills  in  developing  local  ICT  content  and \ne-applications  (such  as  e-government,  e-learning, \ntele-medicine, \ne-remittance, e-commerce) particularly for the poor. The research and \ntraining  network  will  therefore  serve  as  a  SASEC  regional  ICT \nresearch,  professional \nknowledge  network,  providing \ndevelopment,  and \ninnovation  and \nlocal \nentrepreneurship  in  the  creation  of  local  content  for  the  regional \ne-businesses and e-services to be delivered over the SASEC regional \nnetwork  and  the  SASEC  village  network.  To  this  end,  the  Project  will \nset up a research and training center in the four selected ICT research \ninstitutes  in  the  SASEC  countries  by  providing  (i)  connectivity  to  the \nSASEC regional network, (ii) support for faculty mobilization and space \nrental,  and  (iii)  ICT  development  support.  The  research  and  training\n \n\nteaching, \nfor \n\nrelated  support \n\n \n\n\fvii\n\ncenters will (i) design and conduct research and training in e-business \ndevelopment  and  ICT  professional  development,  for  the  delivery  of \nservices to rural communities through the SASEC village network and \nCECs;  and  (ii)  develop  open  content  and  training  programs  in  ICT \nprofessional development.  \n \nThe  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $4.4  million,  which  will  be \nfinanced with a grant from ADB\u2019s Regional Cooperation and Integration \nFund.  ADB  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA,  and  the  EAs \nchosen  to  implement  the  Project  will  be  the  Implementing  Agencies \n(IAs).

The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n1. \n\nICT and the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Program \n\n2. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  had  a  major  role  in  supporting  regional \ncooperation  among  Bangladesh,  Bhutan,  India,  and  Nepal  through  the  SASEC  Program  since \n2001. 1 With its growing importance in development, information and communication technology \n(ICT) was made a priority sector of phase II of the SASEC Program, which started in 2003. In \n2005,  the  SASEC  ICT  Working  Group  (ICTWG)  established  under  the  SASEC  Program \n2 a  SASEC  ICT  development  master  plan  laying  down  the \ndeveloped  with  ADB\u2019s  assistance(cid:31)F\nstrategy,  framework,  and  priorities  for  regional  cooperation  in  ICT.  The  SASEC  regional  ICT \nstrategy  was  intended  to  coordinate  and  consolidate  the  national  leadership,  vision,  and \nstrategies of the four countries for ICT. It proposed three most urgent areas for improvement in \nICT:  (i)  cross-border  connectivity,  (ii)  rural  access  to  information,  and  (iii)  human  resource \ncapacity. To address these needs, the SASEC countries agreed, at the third ICTWG meeting in \nDhaka  in  September  2006,  to  develop  the  concept  of  the  SASEC  information  highway,  which \nwould  deliver  and  facilitate  modern  broadband  information,  communication,  and  knowledge \nservices  within  and  across  borders  to  governments,  businesses,  research  institutes,  and  rural \nand remote communities. ADB approved project preparatory technical assistance in November \n3 As  designed,  the  Project  will  continue \n2006  to  give  definite  form  to  the  project  components.(cid:31)F\nADB\u2019s support for and commitment to regional cooperation in ICT. \n\n2. \n\nCross-Border ICT Connectivity in the Subregion \n\n3. \nThe  cross-border  ICT  network  in  the  subregion  is  fragmented  and  outdated.  In  many \ncommunities, affordable modern broadband services are not available although latent demand \nis  high.  All  four  SASEC  countries  are  technically  interconnected  through  fiber  optics  or \nmicrowave,  but  data  communications  are  not  direct  and  often  go  via  third  parties.  This  is \nbecause  direct  fiber-optic  connections  have  insufficient  capacity  and  regional  exchange  points \n4 are  nonexistent.  The  result  is  massive  deployment  of  expensive \nand  \u201cpeering\u201d  arrangements(cid:31)F\n\n                                                 \n1  The Program has been supported through ADB. 2000.

Before \ncountry  exchange  points  were  established,  even  traffic  within  a  country  was  exchanged \noverseas,  generally  through  Hong  Kong,  China,  and  sometimes  also  through  the  United \n5 This  network  fragmentation  has  led  to  heavy  overhead  transit  costs  and  ultimately  to \nStates.(cid:31)F\nhigh  user  cost,  and  limited  the  full  use  and  expansion  of  ICT-enabled  services  in  the  SASEC \nsubregion.  Because  Internet  traffic  often  goes  via  third  parties,  and  overly  relies  on  satellite \ntransmission, connections in landlocked countries like Bhutan and Nepal cost much higher and \nare  of  lower  quality.  On  the  other  hand,  Bangladesh,  recently  connected  to  major  submarine \ncables, cannot yet use the full capacity available to it and can therefore provide extra capacity to \nits neighbors. India, experiencing rapid growth in ICT penetration driven by private operators, is \nalso increasingly supplying bandwidths to neighboring countries, but still does not fully meet the \nsubregion\u2019s  needs  for  high-quality,  affordable,  and  reliable  broadband.  Regionally  integrated \nand  high-quality  broadband  capacity  would  keep  local  traffic  local  and  optimize  the  cost  of \ninterconnection within the region, besides helping reduce the prices of ICT services to end users \nand boosting the growth in the use of ICT across borders.  \n\n3. \n\nRural ICT Development  \n\n4. \nCommercially  driven  ICT  development  has  left  rural  people  behind  and  widened  the \ndisparity  between  the  rural  and  urban  areas.  Rural  community  e-centers  (CECs)\u2014known \nvariously as information kiosks, e-kiosks, village knowledge centers, or tele-centers\u2014have been \ntested and have proved effective in addressing this issue. India\u2019s various rural CEC models and \nBangladesh\u2019s Grameen village phone are pioneering and innovative examples of the use of ICT \nfor  rural  poverty  reduction.  The  CEC  movement  in  India  is  now  a  national  initiative,  with  the \nprospect of Internet connectivity in every village. Grameen Telecom in Bangladesh has become \na major mobile operator and has extended the application of its microfinance model to Internet \nvillage  kiosks  in  rural  areas.  CECs  have  been  tried  out  for  some  years  in  Nepal  and  more \nrecently  in  Bhutan,  but  these  experiments  have  yet  to  achieve  nationwide  scale,  under \ngovernment  or  private  leadership.  Several  hundred  CECs  are  operated  in  Bangladesh  and \nNepal  mostly  by  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  and  the  private  sector,  and  a  much \nsmaller  number  in  Bhutan,  mainly  by  government  and  development  agencies.  In  India,  CECs \nexist in the tens of thousands, driven by a mix of large enterprises, entrepreneurs, universities, \ngovernment, and NGOs.  \n\n5. \nSince  computers  and  Internet  connectivity  are  still  too  expensive  for  private  ownership \namong  the  poor  unlike  mobile  phones,  which  are  becoming  more  affordable,  CECs\u2014shared \nfacilities\u2014are  most  useful  in  expanding  rural  ICT  development.  However,  before  CECs  can \nbecome a mainstream means of communication, some challenges must first be dealt with: rural \nbroadband  connectivity,  local  content,  and  community  capacity,  as  well  as  consolidated \nassistance for all three. Efforts to engage rural communities at the core of CEC programs have \nalso  been  limited;  the  communities  are  considered  unilateral  beneficiaries  of  information \nservices, instead of interactive local knowledge producers. To overcome these challenges and \nachieve the proven potential of CECs, rural CEC programs should evolve into village networks, \nwherein connected groups of villages generate, accumulate, and exchange information through \nvillage hubs. The regional approach will enable the SASEC countries to enhance their efforts to \nbridge the digital divide by sharing their experiences and connecting rural communities with one \n\n                                                 \n5  Global exchange points and bandwidth markets are located in the East Coast of the United States (New York and \nWashington,  DC);  the  West  Coast  of  the  United  States  (San  Francisco  Bay  Area  and  Los  Angeles);  Europe \n(London and Amsterdam); and Asia (Hong Kong, China and Singapore). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nanother and with the rest of the world, and ultimately accessing the vast source of information, \ncontent, and services. \n\n4. \n\nHuman Resources Development in ICT \n\n6. \nThe  need  for  more  and  higher-quality  training  in  ICT  has  been  expressed  by  all  the \nSASEC countries including India, where ICT industry development has created millions of jobs \nover the past decades. They recognize the relationship between good-quality tertiary teaching \nand  research,  on  the  one  hand,  and  staff  retention,  the  brain  drain,  and  ultimate  industry \ndevelopment,  on  the  other.  The  ICT  education  provided  at  present  at  most  institutions  in  the \nsubregion is mediocre. Except in certain public and private institutions of excellence, many ICT \ntraining  initiatives  do  not  meet  international  quality  standards.  While  India  has  trained  a  large \npool of skilled human resources in the ICT sector in the past few decades, it must upgrade their \nquality.  Other  SASEC  countries  are  seriously  constrained  in  mobilizing  qualified  human \nresources \nICT \nteaching/learning, Nepal has more than 30, and Bangladesh has more than 100, compared with \nIndia\u2019s thousands. The number of ICT professionals including the unqualified ranges from less \nthan 400 (0.05% of the population) in Bhutan to more than 1 million in India (0.09%); Nepal has \n6,000  (0.02%)  and  Bangladesh,  20,000  (0.01%).  A  regional  approach  to  building  human \ncapacity  through  shared  resources  and  improved  national  training  and  development  support \nwould enable the SASEC countries to capitalize on the opportunities in ICT. \n\nICT.  Bhutan,  for  example,  has  only \n\ntwo  higher \n\ninstitutions \n\nfor \n\nfor \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nICT and Economic Growth \n\n7. \nGlobal  communities  and  their  economic  activities,  including  regional  and  international \ntrade,  are  increasingly  being  integrated  through  electronic  means  and  technologies.  ICT  is \nfundamentally transforming the way we live, learn, and work, and it is crucial for inclusive growth \nthat the benefits of ICT be shared by all. International experience reveals that ICT can be a key \nenabler  for  improving  efficiency  and  productivity,  creating  new  business  opportunities,  and \nenhancing  competitiveness.  ICT  is  thus  as  essential  for  economic  growth  as  road  and  rail \n6 The quality and usefulness of ICT infrastructure \nnetworks, and telephone and power systems.(cid:31)F\ntherefore determines the efficiency of the economy and the potential for economic growth of the \nSASEC countries individually and as a group. \n\nThe SASEC countries acknowledge ICT to be a significant means for economic growth \n8. \nand  have  developed  significant  strategic  policies  consistent  with  established  planning  for  ICT \nespecially  in  relation  to  infrastructure,  e-government,  e-education,  e-commerce,  training  and \nskills development, and ICT industry development. However, according to the ICT index (2004) \n7 measured by levels \nof the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD),(cid:31)F\nof ICT access, connectivity, and uptake, the overall ICT performance of the SASEC countries is \nlow,  although  the  dynamics  of  ICT  development  in  each  country  are  different.  India  led  the \nSASEC countries, ranking 142nd, Bangladesh ranked 171st; Bhutan, 156th; and Nepal, 167th. \nThese  standings  are  partially  attributable  to  the  limited  connectivity  nationwide,  although  the \neffect of privatization and competition in mobile telephony in all SASEC countries has recently \ngrown rapidly in tele-density. A detailed sector analysis is in Appendix 2. \n\n                                                 \n6  ADB\u2019s  independent  Eminent  Persons  Group  report  (2007)  urges  ADB  to  add  ICT-related  infrastructure  (such  as \n\nfiber-optic cable networks and data banks) to its current definition of infrastructure. \n\n7 United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. 2005. Information Economy Report 2005. New York. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\n2. \n\nICT and Poverty Reduction  \n\nThe \n\nICT  significantly  contributes \n\nto  poverty  reduction.  Chronic \n\n9. \nimpoverishment \nparticularly  in  rural  areas,  is  often  related  to  limited  access  to  markets,  employment \nopportunities, information, and access to public services as well as learning opportunities. Not \nonly do farmers lack information but the limited information that\u2019s available is often rudimentary \nand  outdated.  For  example,  most  farmers  in  South  Asia  still  rely  on  information  reflecting \nfarming practices which are decades-old. More recent advances in farming, livestock, fisheries, \nand  forestry  technologies  are  not  readily  available  to  them  even  if  they  are  available  at  the \nnational  level  for  lack  of  efficient  information  technology-based  delivery  systems.  Rural \ncommunities remain substantially outside the reach of the enormous potential of ICT to improve \nthe rural economy and well-being. Information is a powerful tool for strengthening social capital, \nmost importantly, empowerment and participation, which are well recognized as a critical \u201csoft\u201d \ndriver of socio-economic development and cultural change. Rural children have greater difficulty \nattending  school,  and  when  they  do,  they  stay  for  shorter  periods  and  leave  with  fewer \nqualifications,  thus  restricting  their  ability  to  further  their  skills,  productivity,  and  income.  The \nreach  of  public  services,  both  health  and  education,  is  severely  restricted  due  to  limited  ICT \ninfrastructure, innovative program designs, and delivery systems. \n\nimprove \n\nthe  wellbeing  of  poor  people  by  enabling \n\n10. \nThe  absence  of  services,  remote  physical  conditions,  and  poor  transport  system  leave \nrural  people  more  marginalized.  ICT  holds  great  potential  to  address  these  challenges \neffectively  and \nto  access  \n(i) information about markets; prices and business opportunities, (ii) employment; information on \nemployment and enterprise development, (iii) skills and education; delivery of both formal and \ninformal  e-learning,  (iv)  health  care;  innovative  mechanisms  for  delivering  health  care  and \ninformation, (v) government services; e-government for increased efficiency and transparency of \npublic services, and (vi) empowerment; improved communications and channels for grievances. \nA  number  of  new  and  innovative  projects  applying  ICT  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  poor  have \nshown significant impacts on poverty reduction as shown in the box, which can be both direct \nand indirect.  \n\nthem \n\n11. \nSince  1990,  the  SASEC  subregion  has  experienced  rapid  GDP  growth,  averaging  5.3 \npercent a year, contributing to significant poverty reduction. Most SASEC countries are on track \nto achieve the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target for poverty reduction. However, they \nare off-track on the MDG targets for social development. Overall social development in SASEC \ncountries is still marked by social inequalities and income disparities mapped on caste, religion, \ntribal  and  ethnicity  dimensions.  Therefore,  providing  equal  and  better  opportunities  to  achieve \nmore inclusive growth is essential to achieve progress in all the MDGs in the SASEC countries. \nICT is recognized as a strategic means by all SASEC countries to promote not only faster but \nmore  extensive  inclusive  growth  in  a  region  which  remains  one  of  the  least  developed  in  the \nworld. \n\nExamples of ICT for Poverty Reduction \n\nGrameen Village Phones, Bangladesh. The village phone program was initiated in 1997 by Grameen \nTelecom in cooperation with Grameen Bank. It works as an owner-operated pay phone supported by \nloans from Grameen Bank. The revenue growth has been very rapid \u2013from Tk 0.53 million in 1997 to \nTk2,070 million in 2003. The village phones now provide access to more than 60 million rural people. \nThis has not only provided the rural poor with new exciting income-generating opportunities, but also \ngiven them unprecedented access to critical economic and other information and helped enhance the \nsocial status and empowerment of women from poor rural households. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nWireless Networking Project, Nepal. The project connected 14 villages in remote mountainous areas \nwith  Pokhara  through  wireless  network  since  2003  and  expanded  services  including  telemedicine, \ndistance  education,  and  telephone  service,  which  enabled  the  rural  communities  to  access  public \nservices at large cost savings and in a timely manner. Mahabir Pun, the team leader of the project has \nbeen  awarded  the  Ramon  Magsaysay  Award  2007  for  Community  Leadership  by  the  Ramon \nMagsaysay Foundation in Manila for this innovative \u201chome-grown\u201d project based on the needs of the \nrural communities. \n\nAkshaya and Mallappuram Districts (Kerala), India. It is a joint project between local bodies (gram \npanchayats) in rural areas and municipalities in urban areas and private entrepreneurs in Mallappuram \ndistrict of Kerala initiated in 2001. The objective is to \u201cbridge the digital divide\u201d by providing community \naccess to computers and the Internet. About 565 community technology centers have been established \nin the district. Akshaya operates public-private partnerships in establishing the community technology \ncenter in remote villages. \n\nBhoomi  Project,  Bangalore  (Karnataka),  India.  The  Department  of  Revenue  of  Karnataka  has \ncomputerized  20  million  land  ownership  records  of  6.7  million  farmers  in  the  state.  Each  record  is \navailable  online  from  177  taluka  kiosks  at  a  cost  of  Rs15  per  record.  The  project  has  been  widely \nacclaimed as possibly the most successful ICT project for land records in the country. \n\nE-Choupal, Ujjain (Madhya Pradesh), India. This web-based initiative of Indian Tobacco Company\u2019s \ninternational Business Division in Central India provides soya growers with information, products, and \nservices  they  need  in  soya  farming.  The  kiosks  facilitate  the  supply  of  high-quality  farm  inputs  and \npurchases of soya at the doorsteps of the villagers. This project started in 42 villages of Ujjain district, \nwith around 1,800 kiosks in Madhya Pradesh, and now has around 3,300 kiosks in Central India. The \nkiosks also handle dealerships for various commodities such as cycles and tractors. This feature has \nalso minimized the travel expenses of the villagers. \n\nTarahaat.com,  Jhansi  (Uttar  Pradesh),  India. Development Alternatives (with the help of 12 project \npartners) started the project in four districts of North India as a business model to cater to the unserved \nrural  markets.  The  project  provides  services  like  Tarabazaar  (e-bazaar),  Taravan  (mobile  kiosks), \nTaraguru  (e-education),  Taradhaba  (cyber  caf\u00e9),  Tarareporter  (news),  Taradak  (e-mail),  Taravendor \n(e-commerce),  and  Taracard  (e-greetings).  Franchisee  kiosks  are  provided  with  connectivity  through \nC-band satellite, VSAT, or dial-up modem, according to the infrastructure available.  \n\nMobile  Remittance  Service,  Philippines.  The  mobile  remittance  services  introduced  by  Philippine \noperators  in  recent  years  have  proven  highly  successful  for  all  parties  concerned:  the  operators  are \ntaking  commissions  on  cash  transfers  upwards  of  $100  million  per  day,  while  expatriate  Filipino \nworkers  are  sending  money  home  to  their  families  faster,  more  cheaply,  and  more  securely  than \npreviously  possible.  This  is  known  as  a  good  business  development  case  for  other  mobile  operators \nand development agencies to benchmark.  \n\nICT = information communication technology, Rs = rupees, Tk = taka, VSAT = very small aperture terminal. \nSources: United Nations Development Programme. 2006.

The  idea  behind  building  such  a  regional  network  is  to  keep  local \ntraffic  local,  and  thus  optimize  the  cost  of  interconnection  within  the  region.  It  is  economically \ncritical that the region have sufficient and efficient connectivity to allow for growth in the use of \nICT. In this regard, the SASEC regional network would contribute to reducing user costs across \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nreal-time \n\nborders,  facilitate  ICT-enabled  business  development,  and  increase  the  quality  of  service  by \neffectively  managing \ninteroperability,  peering,  and \ntraffic  data,  congestion, \nredundancy, while facilitating data traffic trades across borders. The plan of action developed by \nthe  World  Summit  on  the  Information  Society  (WSIS)  recommends  that  efforts  be  made  to \nreduce  the  international  Internet  costs  charged  by  backbone  providers  by  developing  regional \nICT  backbones  and  Internet  exchange  points,  thereby  reducing  interconnection  cost  and \nextending network access. \n\nSuch  a  SASEC  regional  network  would  enable  SASEC  countries  to  take  a  SASEC \n13. \nregional  approach  to  the  communities  and  establish  regional  connections  between  the  village \nnetworks of the individual countries, thereby delivering local solutions not only within connected \ncommunities  in  one  country  but  also  in  communities  in  other  SASEC  countries  that  are \nconnected to the regional network. Local networking and local information sourcing from within \nrural  communities  would  be  a  powerful  driver  for  ICT  use  in  the  rural  context.  For  example, \ninformation  sought  by  one  village  contact  would  be  provided  to  every  relevant  village  in  the \nblock, district, state, country, or region. Through this network, every village would be a \u201cpeer\u201d to \nother  villages  and  could  learn  what  all  other  rural  communities  are  learning  and  experiencing \ndaily.  The  principal  sources  of  information,  news,  opinion,  and  discussion  within  the  network \nshould be the villages themselves, through the experiences of their own peers.  \n\n4. \n\nADB Regional Cooperation Strategy  \n\n14. \nADB\u2019s South Asia Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program (RCSP) for 2006\u20132008 \nsets  out  five  key  operational  objectives:  to  improve  connectivity,  to  facilitate  trade  and \ninvestment,  to  develop  regional  tourism,  to  facilitate  cooperation  in  energy,  and  to  promote \nprivate sector cooperation. Improving transport and communications connectivity is expected to \nreduce  transportation  and  communication  costs,  increase  South  Asia\u2019s  competitiveness,  and \nfacilitate  the  movement  of  goods  and  people,  thereby  promoting  economic  and  social \ndevelopment.  To  this  end,  the  RCSP  strongly  supports  the  connectivity  enhancement  of  key \nmodes of transport and communications. Also according to the RCSP, ADB experience shows \nthat  improvements  in  connectivity  are  critical  to  progress  in  other  areas,  such  as  trade  and \ninvestment, and tourism. ICT being basic infrastructure for electronic services and transactions, \nthe Project can be expected to contribute to promoting synergies with other regional cooperation \nactivities in trade and tourism development. \n\n5. \n\nLessons Learned  \n\nA  key  challenge  for  the  Project  is  scaling  up  and  replicating  successful  ICT \ninnovative  and \nfor \n\n15. \nmethodologies  and  mechanisms  developed \nentrepreneurship.  The \ncommunity-driven networks have been identified and incorporated into the project design:  \n\nfollowing  essentials  of  creating  an  enabling  environment \n\nlocally, \n\nfoster \n\nlocal \n\nto \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\na  national  policy  that  acknowledges  community  ownership  and  supports  the \ncreation of an environment toward that end;  \n\na regulatory environment that allows the deployment of the most appropriate and \ncost-effective \nthat  governs \ntechnologies  with  minimum  hindrance,  and \ninteractions  with  others  (e.g.,  for  interconnection)  in  a  manner  that  promotes \nnetwork growth in poor rural communities and recognizes their value;  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\ninnovative measures to support financing and investment, both local and external, \nin  cooperatives  and  community-driven  networks,  recognizing  the  social  and \ndevelopment value of these ventures to the communities, as well as their lack of \nappeal to private investors; and  \n\npositive actions to build the capacity of communities to initiate their own network \nand service enterprises and to maintain and expand them, and to encourage and \nenable  strong  pro-poor  community-driven  governance  of  other  networks  and \nservices provided in their areas. \n\n6. \n\nPolicy Dialogue \n\nPolicy  dialogue  will  be  continued  under  the  SASEC  ICTWG  platform,  focused  on \n16. \nensuring the sustainability of the Project and keeping a primary focus on ICT in the context of \nthe MDG achievements in the following areas:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nTechnology  neutrality  in  service  provision  and  regulation  framework.  The \ndistinction  between  voice  and  data,  while  disappearing  in  technology,  retains  a \nstrong  policy  influence  in  the  region  and  separates  what  is  technically  possible \nfrom what is accepted in practice. Therefore, policy dialogue will be continued, to \nincrease technology neutrality for the maximum use of the regional network and \navailable technologies. \n\nICT-enabled  regional  applications  and  services.  Enhanced  connectivity \nbetween  the  SASEC  countries  should  strengthen  regional  cooperation  and \nintegration \nthrough  public  and  economic  service  applications,  village \ndevelopment, and ICT commerce and industry. Policy dialogue will be carried out \non  the  use  of  the  regional  network  to  serve  the  needs  of  rural  communities, \nbusiness, and research and training institutes across borders. \n\n(iii)  Human  resource  development  in  ICT.  Various  levels  of  human  resource  are \nrequired  to  engage  in  ICT  research  and  development,  to  manage  regulatory \nregimes  that  maximize  the  community  and  economic  benefits  of  ICT,  and  to \ndesign  new  service  applications  to  engage  with  rural  communities.  Policy \ndialogue  will  pursue  regional  cooperation  in  human  resource  development  and \nexpanded local innovations throughout the region. \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n17. \nThe  Project  is  aimed  at  enhancing  the  benefits  of  ICT  and  regional  cooperation  for \ninclusive growth and poverty reduction by increasing the supply of affordable broadband, skilled \nICT manpower, and local content and e-applications, with a special focus on the needs of the \npoor. It is also expected to help SASEC countries improve their productivity and efficiency and \nparticipate more fully in the global information economy. To this end, the Project will establish \n(i) a SASEC regional network with fiber-optic and data interchange capacity, directly connecting \nthe  four  SASEC  countries;  (ii)  a  SASEC  village  network  expanding  broadband  ICT  access  to \n110  rural  communities  in  the  SASEC  countries  and  providing  direct  connections  among  the \ncommunities for local networking and local information sourcing; and (iii) a SASEC research and \ntraining  network  to  build  technical  and  business  skills  in  developing  local  ICT  content  and \n\n7\n\n \n\n\fe-applications  (e-government,  e-learning,  tele-medicine,  e-remittance,  e-commerce,  etc.)  that \nserve the needs of the poor in particular. \n\n8 \n\n \n\nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n1. \n\nSASEC Regional Network  \n\n18. \nThe SASEC regional network will consist of (i) the extensive existing broadband network \nowned  by  telecom  service  providers  in  each  country,  to  be  interconnected  under  the  Project; \n(ii) a new fiber-optic network to be built in Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal; and (iii) four access \ngateways at specific sites in each country, linked to the border township within each country for \nconnectivity to the other countries. The SASAEC regional network will be designed to (i) provide \na scalable data-peering network among SASEC member countries, (ii) provide SASEC member \ncountries  with  access  to  good-quality  landed-port  Internet  access  from  both  India  and \nBangladesh,  (iii)  provide  cross-border  data-peering  access  to  reduce  expensive  international \ntransit peering, (iv) help generate traffic flows and applications throughout the region as well as \nin-country, (v) make broadband services more accessible to rural and remote communities via \nwireless  connectivity  to  CECs,  and  (vi)  maximize  the  use  of  existing  infrastructure  in  each \ncountry to minimize investment costs.  \n\na. \n\nFiber-Optic Network \n\n19. \nIn  Bangladesh,  the  Bangladesh  Telegraph  and  Telephone  Board  and  the  Power  Grid \nCompany of Bangladesh Ltd.\u2014both has fiber-optic cables to the northern town of Panchagarh. \nBut  no  fiber-optic  cables  are  available  from  Panchagarh  to  the  border  point  of  Banglabandha, \nthrough which the SASAEC regional network will be connected to the identified Indian location \nof  Fulbari.  A  new  fiber-optic  cable  of  about  55  kilometers  (km)  will  therefore  be  laid  from \nPanchagarh to Banglabandha in Bangladesh. In Bhutan, Bhutan Telecom Ltd. has a fiber-optic \nlink  from  Thimpu  to  Phuentsholing  via  the  transmission  network  grid  of  Bhutan  Power \nCorporation  Ltd.  A  140  km  alternative  fiber-optic  route  from  Thimpu  to  Phuentsholing  via  a \nsecond power transmission route of the Bhutan Power Corporation Ltd. will provide a redundant \n(self-healing ring) national network from Thimphu to Phuentsholing.  \n\n20. \nIn India, two carriers\u2014Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited and Reliance Communications\u2014\nhave international long-distance licenses to permit cross-border access. Bharat Sanchar Nigam \nLimited is the incumbent carrier and has most of the required links to the SASEC neighbors. No \nnew  investment  in  a  fiber-optic  network  is  required  in  India.  In  Nepal,  Nepal  Telecom  has  a \nfiber-optic link from Hetauda to Biratnagar via underground ducts (pipes) and manholes. A 433 \nkm  alternative  fiber-optic  route  from  Hetauda  to  Biratnagar  via  the  Nepal  Electrical  Authority \ntransmission  power  grid  network  will  be  laid  under  the  Project  to  provide  a  redundant \n(self-healing ring) national network from Hetauda to the town of Biratnagar. \n\nb. \n\nAccess Gateways and Border-Connectivity Townships \n\nDhaka  in  Bangladesh,  Thimpu  in  Bhutan,  Shiliguri  in  India,  and  Kathmandu  in  Nepal \n21. \nhave been selected as country access gateways under criteria specifically drawn up to optimize \nthe  functionality,  cost,  security,  and  marketability  of  the  SASEC  regional  network.  The  criteria \nare  (i) existing  co-locations;  (ii)  potential  for  building  access  to  other  operators;  (iii)  security  of \naccess; (iv) availability of power and backup, air conditioning, rack space, and sufficient space \nfor future expansion; and (iv) resilience to flooding and earthquake. A gateway core router and \nmanagement devices and software will be installed in each access gateway. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nThe  border-connectivity  townships  are  effective  strategic  cable  landing  points  in  each \n22. \nSASEC  country.  The  border  town  or  junction  location  becomes  a  focus  for  improving \nconnectivity  and  developing  further  capacity  that  can  (i)  be  carried  to  the  in-country  access \ngateway, (ii) provide further benefits to the cross-border town, and (iii) provide strategic national \ncable  routes  and  valuable  rural  connection  drop-off  points  along  the  link  between  the  border \ntown  and  the  access  gateway.  These  seven  border-connectivity  townships  were  selected: \n(i) Pancharghar in Bangladesh; (ii) Phuentsholing in Bhutan; (iii) Shiliguri, Jogbani, Fulbari, and \nJaigaon  in  India;  and  (iv)  Biratnagar  in  Nepal.  Border  core  routers  and  equipment  will  be \ninstalled in the three landing stations of Pancharghar, Phuentsholing, and Biratnagar. \n\n2. \n\nSASEC Village Network  \n\nThe  village  network  requires  a  central  hub  supported  by  an  information  exchange  that \n23. \nconstantly  collects,  standardizes,  and  redistributes  traffic  generating  community  information \nfrom  all  participating  villages  across  the  country  through  a  village  intranet.  A  SASEC  village \nnetwork will be established under the Project. Five to six hub CECs will be built in each SASEC \ncountry,  and  five  spoke  CECs  branching  from  each  hub  will  be  connected  to  the  SASEC \nregional  network.  This  will  enable  local  networking  and  local  information  sourcing  from  within \nrural communities across borders and thereby drive rapid ICT uptake by the rural communities. \nAlso, the exact local needs and opportunities for ICT use in various information services can be \nidentified  and  fed  to  the  management  of  the  SASEC  regional  network.  The  component  will \nsupport  (i)  the  establishment  of  a  rural  wireless  broadband  network;  (ii)  the  development  of  a \nportal  service  (voice,  chatting,  video  conferencing,  e-mail,  community  bulletin,  etc.)  and  a \nknowledge database management system; and (iii) the establishment of 110 CECs in the four \nSASEC countries, linked to the SASEC regional network. \n\n24. \nThe SASEC village network will enable CECs in the villages to become access points for \ninteraction  with  the  SASEC  regional  network,  and  thereby  enable  the  CECs  themselves  to \noperate  as  hubs  for  other  CECs  in  the  local  area.  Villages,  once  connected  to  the  SASEC \nvillage  network,  will  be  able  to  generate  and  maintain  information  that  SASEC  rural \ncommunities, via CECs, can interact with and add to, using the SASEC regional network as the \ndelivery  mechanism.  The  SASEC  portal  will  improve  access  to  local  content  and  information \nthrough  the  use  of  multimedia,  and  facilitate  indigenous  knowledge  management  within  and \namong the communities.  \n\n3. \n\nSASEC Research and Training Network \n\n25. \nThe SASEC research and training network will promote regional knowledge sharing and \ninnovation  by  building  human  resource  capacity  and  supporting  local  ICT  start-ups.  The \nresearch and training network will therefore serve as a SASEC regional ICT knowledge network \nproviding  teaching,  research,  and  professional  development  support  for  local  innovation  and \nentrepreneurship. Local entrepreneurs, aided by the research training network, will create local \ncontent  for  regional  e-business  and  e-services  (for  example,  tele-medicine,  e-learning, \ne-remittance,  e-commerce)  to  be  delivered  over  the  SASEC  regional  network  and  the  SASEC \nvillage  network.  To  this  end,  the  Project  will  establish  a  research  and  training  center  in  a \nselected ICT research institute in each of the SASEC countries by providing (i) connectivity to \nthe SASEC regional network, (ii) support for faculty mobilization and space rental, and (iii) ICT \ndevelopment support. The research and training centers will (i) develop and conduct research \nand training in e-business development and ICT professional development, for service delivery \nto the rural communities through the SASEC village network and CECs; and (ii) develop open \n\n \n\n\fcontent  and  training  programs  in  ICT  professional  development.  This  research  and  training \nnetwork will be financed separately by the TA attached to the Project (see paras. 49\u201352). \n\nC. \n\nADF IX Grant Component \n\nBhutan  and  Nepal  were  among  the  poorest  countries  identified  as  eligible  for  Asian \n26. \n8 In  view  of  the  considerable  social \nDevelopment  Fund  (ADF)  grants  in  the  ADF  IX  resolution.(cid:31)F\ndevelopment  impact  of  the  Project  and  the  tight  fiscal  situation  of  the  governments  of  the  two \ncountries,  the  project  components  for  Bhutan  and  Nepal  should  be  eligible  for  100%  grant \nfinancing as prescribed in the draft Board policy paper titled \u201cRevising the Framework for Asian \nDevelopment Fund Grants.\u201d  \n\nD. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n27. \nThe  Project  is  designed  to  encourage  the  maximum  participation  of  the  private  sector \nand  to  promote  public-private  partnership  in  the  operation  of  the  SASEC  networks  (regional \nnetwork, village network, and research and training network) to achieve social, economic, and \nfinancial sustainability. For this purpose, various agreements setting the terms and conditions of \nthe  network  operations  will  be  designed  to  ensure  (i)  the  use  of  the  existing  cross-border \ninfrastructure,  and  (ii)  the  establishment  of  a  framework  and  cash  flows  between  network \noperations and social programs. \n\n28. \nThe  Project  is  also  designed  to  maximize  synergy  and  complementarities  among  the \nthree  components\u2014regional  network,  village  network,  and  research  and  training  network\u2014by \ninterconnecting  the  functions  and  requirements  of  these  network  operations.  The  SASEC \nregional network will provide direct connectivity within SASEC rural communities and between \nthese  communities  and  SASEC  research  and  training  centers.  The  SASEC  research  and \ntraining  network  will  provide  training  programs  and  development  support  on  the  basis  of  the \nneeds  of  rural  communities  and  entrepreneurs  identified  through  the  SASEC  village  network. \nThis arrangement enables direct communications between end users and service providers and \nthereby  encourages  community-based  or  community-driven  innovations,  leading  to  the \ndevelopment of local content and e-applications that are more relevant to the needs of the poor \nin rural areas.  \n\nE. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\nThe project investment cost is estimated at $24.0 million, including taxes and duties of \n\n29. \n$2.7 million, as shown in Table 1.

All SASEC countries will select a \nservice agency from eligible telecom service providers in each country to provide the necessary \nfiber-optic network and be responsible for operating the SASEC regional network jointly with the \nservice agencies in the other SASEC countries. India will select its service agency on the basis \nof  the  availability  of  (i)  an  international  long-distance  license  to  carry  traffic  to  and  from  other \ncountries  (carriers  with  national  long-distance  licenses  and  adequate  infrastructure  for  cross-\nborder  traffic  could  form  a  consortium  with  the  international  long-distance  license  holder  to \nqualify),  (ii)  a  fiber-optic  network  that  satisfies  SASEC  regional  network  design  specifications \nand that can be upgraded with the least amount of capital expenditure, (iii) reliable access and \nexpandable  capacity  to  the  SASEC  border  locations  from  Shiliguri,  (iv)  reliable  access  and \nhaulage to Internet capacity at landing stations from Mumbai and Chennai, (v) right-of-way, and \n(vi) support for next-generation network technology.  \n\nThe three other SASEC countries will select their own service agencies on the basis of \n32. \nthe  availability  of  (i)  a  national  fiber-optic  network  with  reliable  and  expandable  capacity, \n(ii) right-of-way, (iii) a fiber-optic route that favors the location of wireless sites to link rural CEC \nnetworks,  and  (iv)  support  for  next-generation  network  technology.  Service  agencies  will  be \nselected  through  open  tender  (for  countries  with  more  than  two  eligible  candidates)  or  closed \ntender (for countries with no more than two eligible candidates). Each tender will be based on \ntechnical  and  financial  capability  to  deliver  the  desired  solution  within  a  country\u2019s  borders  and \nacross the borders of other countries.  \n\n33. \nThe  organizational  operational  structure  of  the  SASEC  regional  network  will  be \nestablished by three layers of multilateral and bilateral agreements among and between SASEC \ncountries.  The  multilateral  cooperation  network  agreement,  which  will  be  signed  by  the \nexecuting agencies (EAs) in all SASEC countries, will set the overall framework and guidelines \nfor the operation of the SASEC regional network. The service agency agreement will be made \nbetween  the  EA  and  the  service  agency  in  each  country,  and  will  set  out  the  details  of  the \npublic-private  partnership  arrangements  by  setting  the  terms  and  conditions  for  the  service \nagency to build, keep, manage, and operate the network and equipment as designed, built, and \n9   The \ninstalled  under  the  Project  and  serve  the  requirements  of  the  SASEC  regional  network.(cid:31)F\nrole of the EA, i.e., the public sector, will be limited to supervising the service agencies, which \nwill  have  a  key  role  in  jointly  operating  and  maintaining  the  regional  network  through  bilateral \ninterconnection  agreements.  The  bilateral  interconnection  agreement,  which  will  be  made \nbetween  service  agencies  of  two  countries,  will  set  the  terms  and  conditions  for  the \ninterconnection  of,  and  the  exchange  of  digital  traffic  between,  the  countries\u2019  in-country \nnetworks  including  technical  specifications  of  networks  and  maintenance,  and  spell  out  the \nmechanism  for  revenue  and  cost  sharing.  Six  bilateral  network  agreements  will  be  signed \namong the four SASEC countries. \n\n                                                 \n9  The agreement will include a clause that requires the selected service agencies to contribute a certain portion of \ntheir revenue accrued from the SASEC regional network to support the financial sustainability of the SASEC village \nnetwork and the SASEC research and training network. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nb. \n\nSASEC Village Network \n\n34. \nThe  operation  of  the  SASEC  village  network  and  CECs  will  be  franchised  to  private \nentrepreneurs  such  as  rural  Internet  service  providers  (ISPs)  or  NGOs  that  were  involved  in \nsimilar CEC operations. The village network and operation might be franchised through auction, \nlease,  or  other  appropriate  means;  auction  is  the  widely  adopted  means,  to  ensure  both  the \nfinancial sustainability of the village network and the CECs and the social responsibility of the \nfranchisees. The potential service agencies, in the course of bidding, might indicate the need for \nfinancial support in case the CECs they bid for are assessed to be financially unviable. The EA \nwill select a service agency that has offered the highest price or the lowest financial support for \nthe operation of a package of CECs and the village network. If the EA should pay for financial \nsupport as a result of a bid, it would be financed by the resource pool that would be established \nfrom the contributions of the service agencies of the SASEC regional network. The agreement \nfor village network operation between the EA and a selected service agency will prescribe the \nsocial responsibility of the franchisees by specifying the minimum services to be provided to the \ncommunities,  particularly  the  poor  and  the  women,  and  the  need  for  financial  assistance  from \nthe  EA  to  ensure  the  financial  sustainability  of  the  CEC  operation.  This  social  responsibility \nmodel is based on best practices tested and now being used more widely in India. \n\nc. \n\nSASEC Research and Training Network \n\n35. \nThe  service  agencies  in  the  four  countries  will  be  selected  from  capable  potential  ICT \nresearch  institutes  including  universities  and  will  act  as  focal  implementing  agencies  of  the \nnetwork. The selected service agencies will be provided with connectivity to the SASEC regional \nnetwork  and  the  necessary  equipment,  and  will  be  required  to  provide  regional  research  and \ntraining  services  as  prescribed  in  the  service  agency  agreement,  making  use  of  their  own \nexpertise  and  human  resources,  and  assistance  provided  to  them  for  additional  faculty \ncompensation, space rental, content development training courses, and ICT development. The \nservice agencies will operate the research and training network by developing and conducting \nresearch and training programs in e-business development and ICT professional development, \nand  by  providing  development  support  to  small  and  medium  ICT  start-ups,  through  which  the \nservice  agencies  will  accrue  financial  revenues  to  ensure  the  financial  sustainability  of  their \nnetwork operation.  \n\n2. \n\nProject Management \n\nThe Ministry of Science and Information and Communication Technology of Bangladesh, \n36. \nthe  Ministry  of  Information  and  Communication  of  Bhutan,  the  Department  of  Information \nTechnology  of  the  Ministry  of  Communications  and  Information  Technology  of  India,  and  the \nMinistry  of  Information  and  Communication  of  Nepal  will  be  responsible  for  implementation  of \nthe Project as its EAs. A steering committee, consisting of the secretaries of the EAs, will jointly \nsupervise and monitor overall project implementation. It will also provide overall guidance to the \nproject  management  units  to  be  established  under  the  EAs  in  coordinating  joint  activities,  and \nclear  the  draft  multilateral  cooperation  agreement,  bilateral  interconnection  agreements,  and \nservice  agency  agreement  for  the  transfer  of  network  and  equipment  and  their  operation,  for \nsigning.  \n\n37. \nA project management unit (PMU), headed by a project director (joint secretary) and with \na  technical  expert  (project  manager),  an  administrative  staff,  and  a  representative  of  each \nservice  agency  as  members  will  be  established  under  each  EA.  It  will  be  responsible  for  the \nday-to-day  implementation  of  the  Project  in  coordination  with  the  project  management \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nconsultants. The PMU will (i) recruit the country project management consultants in consultation \nwith ADB; (ii) supervise and monitor the work of the country project management consultants; \n(iii) maintain the project accounts, endorse the invoices of the project management consultants, \nand  prepare  withdrawal  requests  for  payment  to  contractors;  (iv)  prepare  the  statement  of \nexpenditure  for  the  replenishment  of  the  imprest  account,  and  prepare  the  yearly  financial \nstatement  for  the  project  account  and  have  it  audited  by  an  external  auditor;  and  (v)  report \nmonthly  on  the  progress  of  the  implementation  to  the  steering  committee  and  ADB.  The \nimplementation arrangement is in Appendix 4.  \n\nThe Project will be implemented for 21 months, from April 2008 to December 2009. The \n\n38. \nproject implementation schedule is in Appendix 5.  \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n4. \n\nProcurement \n\nGoods,  services,  and  civil  works  to  be  financed  under  the  ADB  grant  or  loan  will  be \n39. \nprocured  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nNetwork  design  and  installation  contracts  will  be  procured  according  to  the  procurement  plan \n(see Appendix 6).  \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n40. \nProject  management  consultants  will  be  hired  to  assist  the  EA  in  implementing  the \nProject.  The  project  management  consultant  team  will  consist  of  (i)  an  international  team \ncomprising a team leader, a design engineer, and a procurement specialist; and (ii) four country \nteams. Each country team will have three subteams: a SASEC regional network team, a village \nnetwork/research  and  training  network  team,  and  a  joint  team.  Each  of  the  first  two  subteams \nwill  comprise  a  team  leader,  a  design  engineer,  a  procurement  specialist,  and  a  network \nengineer.  The  joint  team  will  consist  of  a  social  development  specialist,  an  environment \nspecialist, and a quality assurance specialist. A firm of international consultants will be hired for \n36  person-months,  and  a  firm  of  national  consultants,  for  100  person-months  in  Bangladesh, \nBhutan, and Nepal, and for 63 person-months in India. The project management consultants will \n(i) design all networks to be procured under the Project; (ii) prepare bid documents; (iii) assist \nthe  PMU  in  tendering  (prequalification,  evaluation  of  proposals,  etc);  and  (iv)  supervise \ncontractors.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  the  project  management  consultants  are  in \nAppendix 7.  \n\n41. \nThe  project  management  consultants  will  be  selected  and  hired  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  through \nquality- and  cost-based  selection  (80:20)  and  simplified  technical  proposal.  ADB  will  consider \napproving  advance  recruitment  of  consultants  on  the  understanding  that  such  action  will  not \nnecessarily commit ADB to financing the Project.  \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n42. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  has  been  explained  to  and \ndiscussed  with  the  governments  of  the  SASEC  countries.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to \ngood  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate, \ndirectly  or  through  its  agents,  any  allegations  of  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive \npractices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nAnticorruption Policy will be included in the grant regulations and the bidding documents for the \nProject.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  for  the  Project  will  include  provisions \nspecifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the EAs and all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. The \nGovernment will also allow ADB\u2019s representatives to carry out random spot checks on the work \nin progress and the use of funds for the Project, and assist them in doing so. \n\n43. \nThe SASEC ICTWG, a continuous ICT coordinating body composed of the secretaries of \nthe  ICT  ministries  in  the  SASEC  countries,  will  oversee  and  monitor  the  procurement  of \ncontractors and the selection of service agencies to ensure transparency and good governance. \nThe  country  representatives  will  be  required  to  present  at  a  SASEC  ICTWG  meeting  their \ntendering  processes  for  the  procurement  of  contractors  and  the  selection  of  service  agencies \nincluding  the  criteria  for  prequalification  and  tender  evaluation.  While  examining  the  tender \nprocesses  of  each  country, \nICTWG  may  propose  supplementary  and \ncomplementary measures to enhance transparency and good governance.  \n\nthe  SASEC \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n44. \nGrant  and  loan  funds  will  be  disbursed  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook  (2007).  Statement-of-expenditure  procedures  will  be  used  in  reimbursing  eligible \nexpenditures.   \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nEach EA will maintain separate accounts and records for the Project according to sound \n45. \naccounting  principles,  adequate  to  identify  the  goods  and  services  financed  from  the  grant \nproceeds,  the  financing  resources,  the  expenditures  incurred  for  the  Project,  and  the  use  of \nlocal  funds.  These  project  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  will  be  audited  annually \naccording to sound auditing standards by independent auditors acceptable to ADB. The EAs will \nsubmit  to  ADB  the  audited  project  accounts  no  later  than  6  months  after  the  end  of  the  fiscal \nyear.  The  annual  audits  will  include  an  audit  of  the  statement-of-expenditure  records,  and  a \nseparate  opinion  on  the  audit.  The  Government  has  been  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  requirement  of \ntimely submission of audited project accounts and financial statements, and the suspension of \ndisbursements of the proposed ADB grant or loan if the requirement is not complied with. \n\n46. \nEach  EA  will  submit  quarterly  progress  reports  to  allow  performance  to  be  monitored, \nissues to be resolved, and periodic action plans to be prepared. The quarterly reports will serve \nas  feedback  for  updating  and  improving  procedures  and  project  implementation.  Within \n3 months  of  the  physical  completion  of  the  Project,  each  EA  will  submit  a  project  completion \nreport on the overall impact of the Project. \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n47. \nThe  EAs  will  be  responsible  for  overall  project  monitoring.  The  PMUs  will  establish  a \nsystem for preparing monthly progress reports for performance monitoring and issue resolution, \nplus periodic action planning. The EAs will monitor the quantitative and qualitative performance \nof  each  project  component  and  evaluate  the  delivery  of  the  planned  facilities  and  the  project \nbenefits accrued. With the help of the project management consultants, each EA will develop, \nno  later  than  3  months  after  the  loan  or  grant  takes  effect,  a  comprehensive  system  for \nmonitoring  the  Project\u2019s  performance.  ADB  will  review  and  approve  this  system.  ADB  and  the \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nEAs will agree on the performance parameters to be monitored during the implementation of the \nProject and for 3 months after project completion. \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n48. \nADB staff will review project implementation through regular or special review missions. \nAccording  to  the  project  schedule, a  midterm  review  will  be  carried  out  about  12 months  after \nthe  start  of  the  Project,  around  April  2009.  Before  the  midterm  review  each  of  the  four \ngovernments will submit to ADB a detailed progress report on the Project\u2019s implementation and \nachievements.  The  terms  of  reference  for  the  midterm  review  will  be  included  in  the  project \nadministration memorandum to be prepared by ADB\u2019s Inception Mission for the Project.  \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n49. \nInfrastructure  provision  alone  will  not  serve  the  purpose  of  the  Project.  Without \nfacilitation  of  content,  services,  and  capacity,  such  infrastructure  will  quickly  become \nunsustainable. Therefore, the piggybacked TA is aimed at strengthening the functioning of the \ninfrastructure by building the related human capacity, not only in hard engineering technologies \nbut  also  in  soft  business  management  and  development  technologies  required  to  operate, \nmanage, and use the SASEC regional network and the SASEC village network. The TA will also \ncontribute  to  reshaping  the  role  of  the  ICT  research  institutes  in  knowledge  development  and \nICT-related capacity building for community and business development. It will generate regional \nand  national  e-businesses  and  services  (public  and  private),  in  the  course  of  the  sustainable \nprovision  of  the  SASEC  information  highway  infrastructure.  It  will  also  support  local \nentrepreneurs  and  ICT  start-ups  in  facilitating  better  public  and  private  services  to  rural \ncommunities.  In  the  long  term,  the  TA,  together  with  the  improved  connectivity  through  the \nmother  project,  will  contribute  to  inclusive  growth  by  empowering  those  who  have  been \nexcluded from the economic and social development activities of the countries. The design and \nmonitoring framework of the TA is in Appendix 8. \n\n50. \nThe  proposed  TA  will  develop  these  four  dimensions  of  the  SASEC  research  and \ntraining  network:  (i)  incorporating  regional  and  community  priorities  on,  and  need  for,  ICT  skill \nand  business  development  into  the  core  activities  of  the  ICT  institutes;  (ii)  establishing \npartnerships, linkages, and interactions with the regional communities and businesses through \nthe  research  and  training  network;  (iii)  enhancing  the  subregional  knowledge  pool  and \nresources  for  the  capacity  development  of  ICT  professionals  and  entrepreneurs  for  long-term \nsustainable  operation;  and  (iv)  promoting  research  and  development  on  e-business, \ne-applications,  and  e-services  to  be  delivered  through  the  SASEC  regional  network  and  the \nSASEC village network, for the greater benefit of the community and business creation.  \n\nThe  TA  will  assist  four  SASEC  research  and  training   centers  in  carrying  out  the \n51. \nfollowing  activities  for  ICT  skill  and  business  development:  (i)  providing  research  and  training \nprograms  for  in-country  and  regional  needs,  wherever  possible;  (ii)  allocating  an  appropriate \nproportion  of  the  institutes\u2019  research  to  ICT-related  subjects  that  are  relevant  to  regional \npriorities and address contemporary issues with a direct impact on the communities they serve; \n(iii)  taking  leadership  in  a  range  of  interactions  with  the  communities  through  ICT-related \nconsulting and professional services; (iv) maintaining connections with other bodies throughout \nthe  SASEC  region  that  are  relevant  to  the  centers\u2019  vision  and  mission  in  regional  and \ncommunity  ICT  research  and  training  interaction;  (v)  promoting  the  use  of  institute  facilities \namong the general community and businesses; (vi) using a distinctly capable ICT infrastructure \nthe \nand  associated  environment \n\nfor  promoting  knowledge-based  development  via \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\ninterconnection with the SASEC regional network and back-to-back interconnection with CECs; \n(vii) collaborating with other ICT research institutes and training providers in the region that are \ninterested  in  ICT-related  services,  to  accrue  mutual  benefits;  (viii)  creating  a  centralized \ninformation  and  database  that  integrates  all  CECs  under  the  Project  as  a  focal  point  for \ninformation dissemination throughout the region; and (ix) using the SASEC regional network as \na primary connectivity gateway for delivering services to the wider community and industry. \n\n52. \nThe total cost of the TA is estimated at $4.4 million, to be financed on a grant basis from \nADB\u2019s  Regional  Cooperation  and  Integration  Fund.  The  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan  for \nthe TA are in Appendix 9. The project management consultants to be hired for the Project will \ndesign  the  research  and  training  network  for  connectivity  to  the  SASEC  regional  network  and \nselected  ICT  research  institute  in  each  country;  procurement  will  be  according  to  the \nprocurement  plan  (see  Appendix  6).  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  45  months,  from \nApril 2008 to December 2011. \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACT, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nPoverty and Social Development Impact \n\n53. \nPoverty is often found significantly related to a lack of knowledge and information; ICT \ncan  improve  effective  access  to  such  knowledge  and  information.  Rural  poverty  rates  in  the \nSASEC countries range from 20% to 42%: 20% in India; 35%, Nepal; 40%, Bangladesh; 42%, \nBhutan.  More  than  two  thirds  of  the  rural  population  in  the  countries  subsists  on  agriculture \n(including  livestock)  and  forestry.  Rural  farmers  rely  on  rudimentary  and  outdated  information \nabout farming practices and have limited opportunities to market their agricultural products. The \nProject  will  contribute  to  addressing  such  challenges  by  improving  rural  ICT  connectivity  and \nhuman capacity to use the vast information and knowledge resources and e-services related to \nagriculture,  market,  employment,  health  care,  education,  and  government  services  that  are \navailable  on  the  Internet.  The  Project  will  also  enable  the  integration  of  rural  communities  for \nlocal networking and local information sourcing. Rural people will thus have better opportunities \nto  create  and  use  local  knowledge  for  improved  empowerment  and  livelihood.  A  summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 10. \n\nB. \n\nEnvironment and Social Safeguards \n\nrequisite  connectivity  between \n\n54. \nThe  Project  involves  the  identification  of  co-location  facilities,  in-country  and  cross-\nborder  links,  and  village  network  locations.  Its  design  is  based  on  the  use  of  the  existing \ntelecommunication  infrastructure  in  each  country.  The  co-location  sites  (network  access \ngateways),  one  in  each  country,  will  be  identified  on  the  basis  of  the  availability  of  requisite \nspace,  facilities,  and  connectivity  to  in-country  links.  The  in-country  and  cross-border  links \nthe \nidentified  will  have \nborder-connectivity  townships,  right-of-way,  and  access  to  the  links.  The  border-connectivity \ntownships  will  also  have  connectivity  to  India\u2019s  border  township,  either  through  existing \ninfrastructure or a new facility established without causing significant environmental impact. The \nidentification  of  the  CECs  will  consider  the  availability  of  space  and  the  requisite  facilities. \nPhysical interventions for the project components will therefore be limited. As such, the Project \nis classified as category C according to ADB\u2019s environmental impact assessment requirements \n(2003).  Environmental \nthe  environmental \nassessment  approach  to  ensure  that  the  Project  will  have  no  significant  environmental  impact \n(the summary report on this assessment is in Appendix 11).  \n\nimpact  was  nonetheless  assessed \n\nthe  access  gateway  and \n\nthrough \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nThe development of CECs and cross-border links between India and Bangladesh is the \n55. \nonly  project  activity  that  is  likely  to  generate  (very  minor)  disturbance.  However,  some  impact \nduring  operation,  especially  associated  with  the  disposal  of  office  and  e-waste,  which  is \nrecyclable,  and  domestic  sewage,  which  can  be  fully  treated,  is  also  foreseen.  The \nimplementation  of  the  mitigation  measures  provided  in  the  environment  management  plan  will \nminimize  the  predicted  disturbance  during  design  and  development  and  during  operation. \nDeveloping the CECs, setting up wireless connectivity poles, and developing cross-border links \nbetween Bangladesh and India may require cutting a few trees, obtaining access, or acquiring \nas  well  as  clearing  additional  land  along  the  road.  Although  the  development  of  CECs  and \nwireless connectivity was not found to involve any forest areas or protected forest, any required \nfelling  of  trees  or  diversion  of  forestland  will  be  carried  out  only  with  and  in  line  with  the \nenvironmental protection laws of the country concerned. \n\n56. \nBy using the existing infrastructure the Project will avoid any private land acquisition and \nresettlement. CECs will be established in existing village administration buildings. Similarly, the \nstructure  for  the  data  center  will  be  built  on  government  land  within  the  premises  of  the  ISPs; \nand the fiber-optic cables will be laid along existing power transmission lines or telecom lines or \non  government  land.  No  adverse  impact  on  private  properties  or  communities  in  the  region, \nincluding indigenous peoples, is envisaged.  \n\nC. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n57. \nThe economic analysis of the Project conformed to ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic \nAnalysis of Projects. To estimate the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the Project, the \nproject  case  was  compared  with  a  base  case  involving  the  continued  use  of  satellite \n10  in \ntransmission.  The  regional  network  will  connect  the  cable  landing  stations  (CLSs)(cid:31)F\nBangladesh and India to an access gateway, and then distribute Internet capacity to Nepal and \nBhutan  via  terrestrial  links.  The  economic  benefits  include:  (i)  savings  accruing  to  Nepal  and \nBhutan on the cost of connecting to Internet service as a result of the installation of the SASEC \nregional  network,  and  (ii)  incremental  revenues  to  be  earned  by  India  and  Bangladesh  from \npayments by Nepal and Bhutan for the CLS connection. Other economic indirect benefits over \ntime  include  increased  incomes  and  economic  activities  resulting  from  improved  access  to \ninformation and markets. For example, improved and more affordable broadband access to the \nInternet resulting from the Project will also boost the development and consumption of ICT and \nthereby increase economic productivity and efficiency. But these benefits are hardly quantifiable \nand were not included in the analysis. \n\n58.  Without the Project, Nepal and Bhutan, which are currently not connected to any CLS, \nhave to depend on satellite transmission, in particular very small aperture terminals (VSATs), to \ngain  access  to  the  Internet.  VSAT  access  is  generally  twice  as  expensive  as  access  through \nCLS  terrestrial  links.  At  present,  VSAT  access  costs  about  $1,500  per  megabyte  (MB)  per \nmonth. Nepal is allocated a maximum of 200 MB of VSAT access capacity and Bhutan, 40 MB. \nWith  the  Project,  Nepal  and  Bhutan  will  have  a  better  option:  instead  of  relying  on  expensive \nsatellite  access  to  the  Internet,  they  will  attain  bigger  Internet  access  capacity  through  CLSs, \nwith negotiated payment of operation fees to India and Bangladesh of about $850 per megabyte \nper  month.  The  Internet  access  capacity  that  Nepal  and  Bhutan  can  purchase  will  be  at  least \nabout three times as large, amounting to a total of 775 MB per month\u2014620 MB for Nepal and \n155 MB for Bhutan.  \n\n                                                 \n10 The location where a submarine or other underwater cable makes landfall. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19\n\nThe economic life of the SASEC regional network and the SASEC village network was \n59. \nassumed to be 15 years, and the residual value to be 10% of the acquisition cost. The operation \nand  maintenance  costs  for  the  fiber-optic  cables  were  assessed  at  2%  of  the  installation  cost \nper year, and for computer equipment at 3% for the first 3 years, increasing by 100 basis points \nevery 3 years as the equipment ages. All cost elements were valued at border prices, using a \nworld price numeraire,  with all taxes and duties excluded. A standard  conversion  factor  of  0.9 \nwas applied to non-tradable items and labor. \n\nThe overall EIRR of the Project is estimated at 34.3%. The sensitivity of the EIRR was \n60. \ntested for cases when (i) no indirect benefits are included; (ii) the project benefits are reduced \nby 20%; (iii) the project cost increases by 20%; and (iv) cases ii and iii combined. In each case, \nthe EIRR remains robust at the level of 31.9%, 27.6%, 28.7%, and 22.7%, respectively. Details \nof the economic analysis are in Appendix 12. \n\nD. \n\nRisks \n\nThe successful implementation and operation of the project facilities will depend largely \n61. \non  multilateral  and  bilateral  agreements  among  the  SASEC  countries.  Any  difficulty  or \nprocrastination in signing those agreements will delay or otherwise hamper the implementation \nand  operation  of  the  facilities.  ADB  will  facilitate  the  signing  of  the  agreements  through \ncontinued monitoring and support for the SASEC ICTWG. \n\n62. \nAs the SASEC village network and the research and training network will be required to \ntake on the social responsibility of serving the rural societies, their operation could be financially \nunviable,  at  least  in  part.  To  mitigate  this  financial  risk,  the  operation  of  the  networks  will  be \nfranchised  to  private  entrepreneurs  such  as  rural  ISPs  and  ICT  research  institutes,  which  will \nrun the networks as commercial and social operations. A financial resource pool will be created \nfrom the contributions of the service agencies in the SASEC regional network to provide needed \nfinancial support to the agencies in fulfilling their social responsibility. ADB will ensure that the \noperations  of  the  village  and  research  and  training  networks  are  effectively  franchised,  to \nmaximize the benefits of public-private partnership.  \n\nThe price for connecting to the CLSs in India is competitively determined in the market. \n63. \nHowever, no market price for interconnection has been determined as yet in Bangladesh. As a \nresult,  Bangladesh  may  set  a  price  that  is  not  at  the  optimum  level  for  the  operation  of  the \nSASEC regional network. ADB will collaborate closely with the EA and the telecommunications \nregulator to reduce such an operational risk in Bangladesh. \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  four  governments  have  given  the  following \n\n64. \nspecific assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nSigning  of  multilateral  cooperation  agreement.  The  governments  of  the  SASEC \ncountries will sign the multilateral cooperation network agreement before the grant or \nloan for the Project takes effect. \n\nSigning  of  bilateral  interconnection  agreement.  The governments of the SASEC \ncountries  will  select  the  service  agencies  in  their  respective  countries  and  sign  the \nbilateral interconnection agreement  with  other  SASEC  countries  before  the  contract \nfor network design and installation is awarded. \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\nLand  acquisition  and  resettlement. The governments will ensure that the network \nand  equipment  will  be  colocated  with  existing  facilities  whenever  required.  In  the \nevent of (a) any unanticipated or unforeseen involuntary resettlement, (b) private land \nacquisition,  or  (c)  resettlement  activities  during  project \nthe \ngovernments of the SASEC countries will ensure that the Project is implemented in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995) and all applicable \nlaws and regulations in the SASEC countries. \n\nimplementation, \n\n(iv)  Environmental  protection.  The  governments  will  ensure  that  any  unexpected \nenvironmental impact will be addressed by consulting ADB. The construction of the \ndata  centers  will \ninitial \nenvironmental  examination  and  will  strictly  follow  the  conditions  attached  in  the \ninto  consideration  ADB\u2019s \nbuilding  permit.  Project \nEnvironment Policy (2002), and the Government Protection Act, 1997.  \n\nthe  recommendations \n\nimplementation  will \n\ninto  account \n\nfrom \n\ntake \n\ntake \n\nthe \n\n(v) \n\nLabor  laws.  The  governments  will  ensure  that  all  civil  works,  system  development, \nand  installation  contractors  (a)  comply  with  all  applicable  labor  laws;  (b)  do  not \nemploy child labor for construction and maintenance activities; (c) do not differentiate \nwages between men and women, particularly for work of equal value; (d) encourage \nthe  employment  of  the  local  poor  who  meet  the  job  and  efficiency  requirements, \nparticularly  women;  and  (e)  provide  timely  payment  of  wages  at  least  monthly  and \nsafe  working  conditions  to  all  workers.  All  civil  works  contracts  will  include  specific \nclauses on these undertakings, and compliance will be strictly monitored by the PMU \nunder the EA during project implementation. \n\n(vi)  Good governance and anticorruption. Consistent with ADB\u2019s and the governments\u2019 \ncommitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, the governments \nwill ensure that the project funds are used effectively and efficiently to implement the \nProject and to achieve the project objectives. The governments will (a) undertake the \nnecessary measures to create and sustain a corruption-free environment; (b) ensure \nthat the governments\u2019 anticorruption laws, if there are any, and ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy, are strictly enforced and are complied with during project implementation, and \nthat  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  all  bidding \ndocuments  for  the  Project;  (c)  facilitate  ADB\u2019s  exercise  of  its  right  to  investigate, \ndirectly  or  through  its  agents,  any  allegations  of  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or \ncoercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project;  (d)  conduct  periodic  inspections  of  the \nproject  contractors\u2019  activities  related  to  fund  withdrawals  and  settlements;  and \n(e) ensure that all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project include \nprovisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts \nof the EAs and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as \nthey  relate  to  the  Project.

The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  been \nsupporting regional cooperation among Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal through the South \n1  Information  and \nAsia  Subregional  Economic  Cooperation  (SASEC)  Program  since  2001.(cid:31)(cid:31)F\ncommunication  technology  (ICT)  was  added  as  one  of  the  priority  sectors  to  the  program  in \nphase II and the first ICT Working Group (ICTWG) meeting was held in India in March 2004. All \nSASEC  countries  have  acknowledged  the  significance  of  ICT  in  poverty  alleviation  and \neconomic advancement in their ICT strategic plans. They have undertaken significant strategic \npolicy development consistent with established planning process for ICT, especially in relation \nto infrastructure, e-government, e-education, e-commerce, training and skills development, and \nICT industry development.  \n\n2. \nAt  present,  the  overall  ICT  performance  of  the  SASEC  countries  is  low,  although  the \ndynamics of ICT development in each country are different. This poor performance is partially \ncaused by the limited nationwide connectivity despite the effects of rapid growth in privatization \nand  competition  in  mobile  telephony.  In  2005,  fixed  tele-density  ranged  from  0.75  for \nBangladesh  to  4.55  for  India;  mobile  tele-density,  from  0.83  for  Nepal  to  8.17  for  India;  and \nInternet  user  penetration,  from  0.26  for  Bangladesh  to  5.44  for  India.  PC  penetration  in  2004 \nranged from 0.47 for Nepal to 1.41 for Bhutan. As shown in Figure A2.1, in recent years, there \nhas  been  remarkable  growth  in  Internet  user  penetration  in  India  and  Bhutan,  and  in  PC \npenetration  in  most  of  the  SASEC  countries.  Individual  country  statistics  are  summarized  in \nFigure A2.1. \n\nFigure A2.1: Growth in Internet User Penetration \n\nInternet Users per 100 Inhabitants\n\nPC per 100 Inhabitants \n\n6 \n5 \n4 \n3 \n2 \n1 \n0 \n\nBangladesh\nBhutan\nIndia\nNepal\n\n1.6\n1.4\n1.2\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n \n\n1999  2000  2001\n\n2002  2003  2004\n\n2005 \n\n1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004\n\nindices, \n\n3. \nVarious  international  organizations  have  developed  indices  for  measuring  readiness  to \nparticipate in the information society, using a series of standardized indicators representing the \nlevel of ICT connectivity, use, and uptake, as well as school enrolment and literacy. Among the \nInternational \nIndex \nmajor \n(DOI),  published  by \n2 was  endorsed  by  the  World  Summit  on  the  Information \nTelecommunications  Union  (ITU),(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nSociety (WSIS) as part of the evaluation methodology and benchmarking system for statistical \nindicators in ICT. The index was designed to assess progress in creating digital opportunity and \nbridging the digital divide.

With  ADB  assistance,(cid:31)(cid:31)F\ndrafted  a  SASEC  ICT  development  master  plan  laying  down  the  strategy,  framework,  and \npriorities for SASEC regional cooperation in ICT to harness the full potential of ICT for poverty \nreduction and inclusive growth. The second SASEC ICTWG meeting in Bhutan held in February, \n2006, accepted the master plan, which, among other things, identified three most urgent areas \nfor improvement in ICT: fragmented cross-border connectivity, poor access to information in the \nrural areas, and insufficient human resource capacity. At the third ICTWG meeting in Dhaka in \nSeptember 2006, the SASEC countries developed the concept of SASEC information highway \nto  address  such  needs  by  delivering  modern  affordable  and  reliable  broadband  information, \ncommunication, and knowledge services within and across borders to universities, businesses, \nand rural and remote communities.  \n\n5. \nSASEC  ICT  Strategy.  The  SASEC  regional  ICT  strategy  in  the  master  plan  was \nformulated  to  coordinate  and  consolidate  the  national  leadership,  vision,  and  strategies  of  the \nindividual  countries.  It  identified  the  following  common  areas:  (i)  the  central  role  of  low-cost \ninterconnected  infrastructure;  (ii)  the  priority  need  for  ICT  skills  development;  (iii)  ICT  industry \ndevelopment; (iv) e-applications development (e-community, e-commerce, e-government); and \n(v) regulation,  legislation,  and  governance.

Also, the need to open up the \ninfrastructure  to  investors,  to  achieve  national  objectives  within  a  defined  period,  is  explicitly \nacknowledged.  Local  ICT  industry  development  is  a  common  agenda.  There  are  other \nconsiderations as well, including, for example, the structure and governance of the Internet and \nthe global positioning of the region. There is also common recognition of skills development as a \nrequirement at all levels, including community e-literacy and accredited graduate qualifications. \nFurther,  all  SASEC  members  have  identified  extensive  requirements  for  service  applications, \nincluding  government  services  such  as  e-education,  e-health,  and  e-culture,  as  well  as  the \npotential for new governance structures to improve community participation. All members have \nalso recognized the need for new institutions or for the enhancement of the capacity and course \nofferings  of  existing  training  institutions.  These  common  interests  and  policies  define  a  broad \nscope  for  priority  areas  of  collaboration  and  regional  ICT  development  strategy  in  the  master \nplan. The results of the review of individual country policies are summarized in Table A2.3. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n29\n\ntechnically \n\ninterconnected \n\nSASEC  Cross-Border  Connectivity. Despite the proximity of the SASEC countries to \n7. \none  another,  the  existing  cross-border  network  in  the  subregion  is  fragmented  and  outdated.  \nReasonable broadband or even more basic ICT data applications cannot be supported in many \ncommunities, although voice communications, often of low quality, are available. All four SASEC \nfiber  optics  or  microwave,  but  data \ncountries  are \ncommunications among the countries are not direct and often go via third parties. Bhutan and \nNepal are landlocked, with the Himalayas and the People\u2019s Republic of China to the north, and \nthe  border  with  India  surrounding  the  rest  of  the  territory.  Both  countries  aspire  to  competitive \naccess  with  redundancy  to  international  networks,  particularly  to  submarine  cables.  India  and \nBangladesh,  on  the  other  hand,  have  access  to  international  fiber-optic  cables  via  submarine \n4 Unlike  Bhutan  and  Nepal,  therefore,  India \ncable  landings,  including  the  link  to  Sea-Me-We  4.

However, the terrestrial cross-border links \nin the region either lack capacity or redundancy, or are sometimes missing.  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nIn  India,  BSNL  and  Reliance  have  international  long-distance  licenses  to  allow \ncross-border access. BSNL is the incumbent carrier and has most of the required \nlinks to the SASEC neighbors. \n\nBangladesh-India border link: No fiber-optic cable is available from the northern \ntown  of  Panchagarh  in  Bangladesh  to  the  border  point  of  Banglabandha, \nBangladesh, and its links to the nearest Indian location of Fulbari. From Dhaka to \nPanchagarh, BTTB has a minimum of 12 core fiber, and PGCB, 16 core fiber. \n\nBhutan-India border link: There is a cross-border fiber-optic cable, 12 core-fiber \nsynchronous  transport  module  1  (STM  1)  (155  megabytes  [MB]),  carried  by \nBSNL and Bhutan Telecom (with 4 MB of Internet access capacity), connecting \nPhuensholing in Bhutan to Jaigaon in India. Bhutan Telecom has a fiber-optic link \nfrom  Thimpu  to  Phuentsholing  via  Bhutan  Power  Corporation\u2019s  transmission \nnetwork grid.  \n\nNepal-India  border  link:  There  is  a  cross-border  fiber-optic  cable,  12  core-fiber \nSTM  1  (155  MB),  carried  by  BSNL  and  Nepal  Telecom  (with  16  MB  of  Internet \naccess  capacity),  connecting  Biratnagar  in  Nepal  to  Jogbani  in  India.  Reliance \nalso has a fiber-optic cable connecting Biratnagar and Jogbani. Within Nepal, the \nNEA has a fiber-optic link between Kathmandu and Hetauda, and Nepal Telecom \nhas fiber-optic capacity between Hetauda and Biratnagar.  \n\n                                                 \n4  The  submarine  telecommunications  cable  linking  Southeast  Asia  to  Europe  via  the  Indian  subcontinent  and  the \n\nMiddle East. \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\nFigure A2.3: SASEC Cross-Border Connectivity \n\n \n\n \n\nEven though fiber-optic links have been established, they cannot be used for data traffic \n9. \n5 The largest domestic market in \nwithout Internet exchange points and a peering arrangement.(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nIndia is Mumbai, which is a fair distance from the other three countries. The nearest domestic \nmarket  is  in  Calcutta,  which  has  yet  to  be  fully  developed  to  attract  Internet  service  providers \n(ISPs)  from  the  neighboring  countries.  As  a  result,  there  has  been  massive  deployment  of \nexpensive satellite connections for Internet access in the last decade in the landlocked countries \nof Bhutan and Nepal. Before the establishment of local exchange points, even traffic within the \ncountries was exchanged overseas, generally in Hong Kong, China but sometimes also in the \n6 There is a vast difference in cost between Internet traffic routed internationally \nUnited States.(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nand locally routed traffic. The fragmentation in the regional network has led to heavy overhead \ntransit  costs  and  ultimately  high  user  cost,  and  limited  the  full  use  and  uptake  of  ICT-enabled \nservices in the subregion. \n\n10. \nInternet. Internet access in the South Asia region was first introduced in the early 1990s \nby  ERNET  in  India.  ERNET  also  extended  dial-up  e-mail  service  to  its  partner  in  Nepal  soon \nafterward.  But  the  real  impetus  came  with  the  commercial  launching  of  Internet  services \nthroughout  the  region.  Commercial  Internet  service  was  launched  in  India  in  1995,  by  the \nstate-owned  VSNL.  Other  countries  in  the  region  were  quick  to  follow,  with  Bhutan  being  the \nonly  exception  until  2000.  While  the  state-owned  VSNL  and  Bhutan  Telecom  took  the  lead  in \nIndia and Bhutan, respectively, private players took the lead in Bangladesh and Nepal. Except \nfor one single ISP in Nepal connecting through VSNL in those early days, there was no regional \nInternet connectivity. Until recently, even providers within countries were not connected to each \nother. Except for India, the primary mode of connection to the upstream providers is still through \n\n                                                 \n5  Peering  is  the  arrangement  of  traffic  exchange  between  Internet  service  providers  (ISPs).  Larger  ISPs  with  their \nown  backbone  networks  agree  to  allow  traffic  from  other  large  ISPs  in  exchange  for  traffic  on  their  backbones. \nThey also exchange traffic with smaller ISPs to reach regional end points. \n\n6  The global exchange points and bandwidth markets are located on the East Coast of the United States (New York \nand  Washington,  DC),  the  West  Coast  of  the  United  States  (San  Francisco  Bay  Area  and  Los  Angeles),  Europe \n(London and Amsterdam), and Asia (Hong Kong, China and Singapore). \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n31\n\nsatellite  connections,  given  the  lack  of  subsea  cable  landing  in  the  other  countries.  Recent \ninvestments  in  infrastructure  inside  India,  coupled  with  the  liberalization  of  the  telecom  sector, \ncan have a positive effect in providing faster connectivity to the other countries in the region.  \n\nRural ICT Program. Other than in India, there is as yet little prospect and practicality for \n11. \nthe  use  of  ICT  for  poverty  reduction  and  rural  development  in  the  SASEC  countries.  Rural \ncommunity  e-centers  (CECs)  have  been  continuing  for  some  years  in  Bangladesh  and  Nepal, \nand more recently in Bhutan. However, these experiments have not yet reached national scale. \nIn  India,  the  CEC  movement  is  now  a  national  initiative,  with  the  prospect  of  connectivity  in \nevery village within the next few years. Several hundreds of CECs operate in Bangladesh and \nNepal, mostly driven by NGOs and private sector, and tens of CECs operate in Bhutan, mainly \ndriven  by  the  government  and  development  agencies.  In  India,  CECs  exist  in  the  tens  of \nthousands,  driven  by  a  mix  of  large  enterprises,  entrepreneurs,  universities,  government,  and \nNGOs. However, owing to the huge size of the poor population, there are tremendous problems \nof scale in India. Such problems are less severe in the other SASEC countries.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f3\n2\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n2\n \n\ni\n\nLow-\nIncome \nGroup \n2005 \n\nSouth \nAsia \nRegion

Agriculture is the backbone of their economy, but India is \nveering  to  trade  at  a  moderate  pace.  Poverty  incidence  remains  high:  Bangladesh  has  the  highest,  at \n49.8%, while Bhutan has 25.3% and Nepal, 30.9%. In India, people living below the poverty line compose \n26.1% of the total population but the proportion is declining, though slowly, as poverty remains widespread \nin the country. \nThe main causes of poverty differ from country to country, but the common factors are observed to be as \nfollows:  (i)  low  literacy  rates,  (ii)  high  population  growth,  (iii)  periodic  natural  disasters,  (iv)  lack  of \nemployment  and  economic  opportunities,  and  (v)  lack  of  access  to  public  information  as  well  as  poor \ngovernment schemes and programs for the poor.  \nThe transport and communications sector in the four SASEC countries has been consistently growing over \nthe last 5 years (2001\u20132005), with Bhutan and India achieving double-digit growth rates in 2004 and 2005 \nthat averaged 14% and 11%, respectively. At constant prices, the share of the sector in the gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) of these countries is modest: 9% for Bangladesh, 10% for Bhutan, and 8% for Nepal. India \nmay  be  considered  an  exception,  as  its  transport  and  communications  sector  accounts  for  25%  of  GDP. \nThe year-to-year expansion of this sector has contributed to poverty reduction in the four countries. \nWith  information  and  communication  technology  (ICT)  becoming  important  to  communications,  the  four \nnational  governments  have  emphasized  their  need  in  various  social  services  like  education,  health, \nagriculture, tourism, and trade. ICT will hasten the delivery of information to people, particularly in remote \nareas.  As  the  Project  is  designed  for  intercountry  connectivity  between  Bangladesh,  Bhutan,  India,  and \nNepal, more information will be accessible to the people. Cheap data transfer, research and development, \nand retooling of skills will be facilitated. Overall, the Project will open up more entrepreneurial, economic, \nand educational opportunities which are essential to poverty reduction in the four countries.  \n \nB. \n \nThe  Project  will  bring  about  tangible  economic  growth  and  social  benefits  to  the  people  in  the  four \ncountries.  The  common  causes  of  poverty  having  been  identified,  the  information  highway  will  be \ninstrumental  in  providing  these  people  with  educational  information  or  access  to  innovative  technology, \nespecially in agriculture, trade, and education.   \nPreliminary  discussions  with  the  people  in  Bangladesh  and  Nepal  indicate  that  information  related  to \nagriculture and health will have a direct impact on their quality of life. The information is also important in \nresolving  petty  health  cases  through  local-language  interactive  programs  with  international  and  domestic \ndoctors  providing  consultancy  through  community  e-centers  (CECs).  In  addition,  the  Project  will  be  an \nimportant tool for gaining access to distance learning. India is an ideal partner under the Project, being the \nmost  developed  among  the  four  countries.  It  has  great  experience  in  research  and  development  training \n(RDT)  systems  and  in  the  operation  of  village  e-kiosks;  this  experience  can  be  transferred  to  the  three \nother countries. \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention \n\nPoverty Analysis:  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n55\n\n   No  \n   No \n\n  Yes \n   Yes         \n\n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nConsultations  were  conducted  with  government  officials,  key  functionaries,  and  selected  communities  in \nthree  countries,  except  in  India,  where  CECs  will  not  be  established.  The  consultations  were  aimed  at \nacquiring a better understanding of the socioeconomic conditions of the people and gauging their views on \nproject development. \nGroup  discussions  among  women  and  the  communities  were  held  to  capture  social  and  economic \nstandards  and  also  to  assess  the  impact  that  the  Project  will  have  on  their  lives.  These  discussions  and \nconsultations  confirmed  the  need  for  this  Project  and  drew  a  positive  response  of  the  communities  and \ndifferent stakeholders, particularly those in the rural areas. The participants acknowledged the fact that lack \nof appropriate and timely information has affected their exposure to development and their progress. \nParticipation  and  ownership  among  the  communities  has  to  be  encouraged  for  the  sustainability  of  this \nproject.  Further  awareness  programs  should  be  carried  out  to  provide  the  right  feedback  to  the \ncommunities on the implementation of the Project and its utility. \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impact on women: \nGender participation was ensured during the field visits through focus group discussions with local women \nbelonging to different socioeconomic groups.  \nThe discussions brought out information about the benefits that the Project will have for women: access of \ngirls  to  higher  education;  access  to  information  on  prenatal  and  postnatal  care;  better  awareness  of \nnutrition  during  pregnancy;  information  about  immunization;  feminine  hygiene  practices;  etc.  The  women \nalso said that issues that cannot be discussed with men or in the general public can be dealt with through \nthe  interactive  programs  with  reputed  doctors  in  a  closed  room  and  their  problems  can  be  shared  and \nsolutions received through this mode. \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \nE. \n\nSocial Safeguards and Other Social Risks \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\n  \nItem \n \nResettlement \n\nSignificant/ \nNot Significant/ \nNone \n \n\n Significant \n Not significant \n None \n\n \n\n \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n\n \nThe  Project  has  been  developed  in  such  a  manner \nthat  there  will  be  no  need  for  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement.  By  developing  the  information  highway \ndata  transfer  facility  and  by  housing  the  CECs  within \nexisting buildings in rural areas, the need for land has \nbeen  avoided.  Similarly,  the  building  for  the  data \ncenter will be built on government land within the ISP \npremises. \n \nTherefore,  the  Project  will  require  no  land  acquisition \nor resettlement, and hence no resettlement plan. \n\n \nPlan \nRequired \n\n \n\n \n\n Full \n Short \n RF \n None \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n  \nItem \n \nAffordability \n\n \nLabor \n\n \nIndigenous \nPeoples \n\n \nOther Risks \nor Vulnera-\nbilities \n \n\nSignificant/ \nNot Significant/ \nNone \n \n\n Significant \n Not significant \n None \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Significant \n Not significant \n None \n\n Significant \n Not significant \n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n\n \nPlan \nRequired \n\n \nUser charges will be nominal and, as evident from the \nsocioeconomic  survey,  users  are  willing  to  pay  the \ncharges. \n\n \nThe  Project  has  no  negative  impact  on  the  labor \nmarket  or  retrenchment.

The  initial  environmental  examination  was  prepared  for  the \ninvestment  project,  which  will  (i)  establish  robust  data  interchange  capacity  between  all  four \nSASEC member countries (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal) with reduced costs and an \nincrease in reliability and competition, providing efficient access with redundancy to submarine \ncables  for  Nepal  and  Bhutan,  and  also  reduce  dependency  on  satellite  links,  enhance  local \npeering,  and  reduce  latency;  (ii)  develop  village  networks  for  SASEC  regional  village \ncommunities to enable rural information and communication technology (ICT) development; and \n(iii) develop ICT training and research centers as part of the piggybacked technical assistance \n(TA). \n\nThe  Project  is  in  category  C,  according  to  the  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines \n\n2. \n(2003) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).  \n\n3. \nThe environmental assessment was carried out between July and August 2007, on the \nbasis of secondary data and field visits. The initial environmental examination report conformed \nto  the  relevant  laws  and  regulations  of  the  governments  of  Bangladesh,  Bhutan,  India,  and \nNepal,  and  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental  Assessment  Requirements \n(2003).  \n\nB. \n\nDescription of the Project \n\n1. \n\nProject Components and Locations \n\n4. \nThe SASEC regional network (SASECRN) proposed under TA 6358-REG will comprise \nfour  network  access  gateways  (co-location  facilities),  one  in  each  country,  linked  to  a  border \ntownship  within  the  country  for  connectivity  to  other  countries.  The  border-connectivity \ntownships are effectively strategic cable landing points in the SASEC countries. In-country and \ncross-border links are the carrier links for the SASECRN.  \n\n5. \nThe SASECRN is aimed at expanding ICT facilities in rural areas and setting up village \nnetworks  and  community  electronic  centers  (CECs).  At  the  village  level,  the  CECs  become \nconnection points for interaction with the SASECRN. Also, CECs can operate as hubs for other \nCECs in the local area, thus enlarging the network coverage.  \n\n6. \n\nA regional ICT training and research center will be set up in each SASEC country.  \n\n2. \n\nProposed Project Activities: Country-Specific \n\nThe SASECRN will maximize the use of existing infrastructure throughout each country. \n7. \nThe  project  activities  in  each  country  will  be  planned  so  as  to  establish  in-country  and \ncross-border  links  using  the  existing  or  upgraded  fiber-optic  cable  network  or  a  new  network \ndeveloped  along  existing  power \nto  overhead \nenvironment (optical power ground wire [OPGW]), which is safe from flooding, land subsidence, \nand  vandalism.  Co-location  sites  with  existing  requisite  facilities  like  air-conditioning,  backup \npower, space, and building security will also be selected. The border-connectivity townships will \nhave  access  to  existing  telecommunication  and  power  transmission  infrastructure, and  can  be \n\nlines.  Preference \n\ntransmission \n\nis  given \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nreached through good roads. \n\nC. \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\nThe project area is spread all over the country in Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal. India \n8. \nhas minimal interface with the environment since most of the required infrastructure is available \nfor the Project. The project activities in the four countries have environmental interface primarily \nwith respect to topographical, soil, and biological/valuable ecological component (VEC). \n\n9. \nThe  Project  requires  the  identification  of  co-location  facilities,  in-country  and  cross-\nborder  links,  and  village  network  locations.  The project  design  is  based  on  the  use  of  existing \ninfrastructure  in  each  country.  The  co-location  sites  (network  access  gateways),  one  in  each \ncountry, will be identified on the basis of availability of requisite space, facilities, and connectivity \nto  in-country  links.  The  in-country  and  cross-border  links  will  have  the  requisite  connectivity \nbetween  the  access  gateway  and  border-connectivity  townships,  right-of-way  (ROW),  and \naccess to the links. The border-connectivity townships will be those where connectivity to India\u2019s \nborder-connectivity  township  already  exists  or  can  be  easily  established  without  causing \nsignificant  environmental  impact.  CECs  will  be  identified  with  the  availability  of  space  and  the \nrequisite facilities in mind. The project components and activities will therefore have very limited \nenvironmental interface. For this reason, the Project is classified as category C. An alternative \nanalysis  is  usually  carried  out  to  enable  the  project  proponent  to  adopt  environmentally \nacceptable options. But since the Project has limited environmental interface, and project design \nhas adopted the best feasible options, no alternative analysis was carried out.  \n\nD. \n\nAnticipated Environmental Impact and Mitigation Measures \n\n10. \nThe  project  impact  is  categorized  into  two  phases:  (i)  impact  during  design  and \ndevelopment, and (ii) impact during operation. The impact on identified VECs in each country is \ndescribed here, along with the mitigation measures required at different phases of the Project.  \n\n11. \nThe  potential  impact  of  the  Project  is  directly  linked  to  the  likely  interface  of  project \nactivities with the environment, as detailed above in the Description of the Project section. The \nproposed  activities  in  the  four  countries  are  not  likely  to  have  any  significant  impact  on  air \nquality,  noise  levels,  and  water  resources.  The  impact  is  likely  to  be  confined  to  loss  of \nvegetation  and  trees,  and  soil  contamination.  On  the  other  hand,  the  Project  will  facilitate  the \nflow  of  updated  information  about  better  agricultural  practices  and  employment  opportunities, \nwhich will catalyze the overall socioeconomic development of the area. The identified potential \nimpact due to the proposed SASEC Information Highway Project is summarized in the following \nsections.  \n\n1. \n\nNepal \n\na. \n\nDesign and Development  \n\nThe  environmental  impact  was  assessed  on  the  basis  of  the  proposed  design  of  the \n12. \nnetwork access gateways (co-location facilities), in-country link access, and border connectivity. \nSince most of the above facilities already have the requisite infrastructure, the required ROW, \nand  access  to  the  site,  no  direct  significant  impact  is  anticipated  from  the  proposed \ndevelopment.  The  development  of  CECs  may  have  associated  impact  if  these  are  set  up  on \nnew sites and in remote areas. All the five CEC locations already selected under this TA 6358 \nare  well  connected  and  are  proposed  to  be  set  up  in  existing  buildings.  The  wireless \nconnectivity poles, which are proposed to be set up in consideration of line of sight, may involve \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n59\n\nsite-clearing activity in small areas as well as creation of access to the proposed pole locations. \nThese activities may have direct impact in terms of cutting of trees and compaction of soil (from \nvehicular movement), though the impact will be smaller in magnitude.  \n\nTo avoid any environmental impact due to CECs and wireless connectivity development, \n13. \nefforts will be made to select the pole locations such that no loss of trees is involved. Wherever \ntree  cutting  is  unavoidable,  provision  will  be  made  for  compensatory  afforestation  (25  trees \nplanted  for  every  tree  cut,  according  to  the  practice  in  Nepal).  Nepal  has  several  protected \n1 (eight national parks, three conservation areas, three wildlife reserves). Efforts are to be \nareas(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nmade  to  avoid  routing  any  fiber-optic  link  or  setting  up  wireless  connectivity  pole  for  CEC \ndevelopment  in  the  protected  areas.  The  CECs  or  co-location  sites  should  not  be  located  in \nflood-prone areas. Nepal is in an earthquake-prone area. This fact should be considered in the \nstructural design of the CECs or co-location site building.   \n\nb. \n\nOperation \n\nThe  operational  activity  of  the  SASECRN  (in-country  network  and  cross-border  links) \n14. \nmay  require  some  maintenance  activity.  However,  because  of  the  availability  of  access  and \nunlikely generation of any waste, no environmental impact is anticipated from these networks. \nThe  co-location  site  may  generate  e-waste  and  used  uninterruptible  power  supply  batteries, \nthough  in  very  small  quantities  and  over  a  long  period  of  time.  The  uncontrolled  disposal  of \nthese wastes can have a harmful impact on the environment (like soil contamination). If power \nbackup is also provided through a diesel generating set, there may be noise and air pollution. \nSimilarly, the operation of the CECs may generate office consumable waste and e-waste. Since \nCECs  are  located  in  remote  areas  where  sanitation  facilities  may  not  be  adequate,  the \nuncontrolled  discharge  of  domestic  sewage  may  create  sanitation  problems  and  unhygienic \nconditions.  \n\nTo  mitigate  the  likely  environmental  impact,  the  recycling  of  e-waste  and  used  UPS \n15. \nbatteries  through  the  supplier  of  these  items  is  proposed.  The  network  access  gateways  and \nCECs are to be equipped with requisite firefighting facilities. A septic tank for treating domestic \nsewage  at  the  CECs  is  also  to  be  provided.  If  backup  power  is  provided  through  a  diesel \ngenerating  set,  then  provision  will  be  made  to  ensure  adequate  stack  height  with  muffler  and \nacoustic enclosure to prevent air and noise pollution.  \n\n2. \n\nBhutan \n\na. \n\nDesign and Development  \n\n16. \nThe impact identified for the network access gateways (co-location facilities), in-country \nlink  access,  border  connectivity,  and  CECs  is  the  same  as  that  assessed  for  Nepal  since  the \nactivities involved are similar except for the laying of alternate fiber-optic links along the Bhutan \nPower  Transmission  route.  The  Bhutan  Power  Transmission  link  already  exists  and  has  the \nrequisite  ROW  and  access  to  the  tower  sites.  Different  techniques  may  be  adopted  for  laying \nthe OPGW link. However, all the techniques involve, primarily, manual work. As such, they will \nnot  cause  any  significant  environmental  impact.  Clearing  the  constrained  access  may  cause \nsome loss of vegetation.  \n\n                                                 \n1 Department  of  Forest  Research  and  Survey.  1999.

Bhutan  has  several  protected  areas (cid:31)(cid:31)F\nnational  parks,  three  sanctuaries).  Efforts  are  to  be  made  to  avoid  routing  any  fiber-optic  or \nwireless  connectivity  (pole  fixation)  for  CEC  development  in  protected  areas.  No  protected \nareas are located close to the border-connectivity town or the western part of Bhutan.  \n\nThe  impact  identified  and  mitigation  measures  suggested  are  the  same  as  those \n\nb. \n\nOperation  \n\n18. \nindicated for Nepal.  \n\n3. \n\nBangladesh \n\na. \n\nDesign and Development  \n\n19. \nThe  impact  identified  for  the  network  access  gateways  (co-location  facilities)  and  in-\ncountry link access are the same as those identified for Nepal. The cross-border links between \nPanchargarh  and  Phulbari  are  yet  to  be  developed.  The  fiber-optic  link  is  proposed  to  be  laid \nwithin  the  ROW  of  the  existing  highway.  This  activity  may  lead  to  loss  of  tree  cover,  soil \ncompaction or erosion, and siltation of water bodies.  The construction of the CEC building may \ncreate localized air and noise pollution during construction. \n\nThe mitigation measures proposed for Bangladesh will be the same as those for Nepal. \n20. \nAdditionally, precaution has to be taken when aligning the cross-border links to minimize loss of \nvegetation or trees, and to make sure that no construction waste finds its way to water bodies. \nWater should be sprayed on loose material to prevent dust generation during the construction of \nthe building. An external covering curtain is to be used. Construction wastes should be disposed \nof  in  low-lying  areas  as  filling  material.  Personal  protective  equipment  should  be  provided  to \nconstruction workers. CECs should not be located in flood-prone areas. Septic tanks for treating \ndomestic sewage should be provided. \n\nThe  impact  identified  and  mitigation  measures  suggested  are  the  same  as  those  for \n\nb. \n\nOperation  \n\n21. \nNepal.  \n\n4. \n\nIndia \n\nDesign, Development, and Operation. The impact identified will be limited in the case of \n22. \nthe provision of links between Panchgarg and Phulbari. The mitigation measures with respect to \nthe laying of the links will be same as those indicated for Bangladesh above. The construction of \nthe  CEC  building  may  create  localized  air  and  noise  pollution  during  construction.  The  impact \nidentified  for  the  construction  of  the  regional  research  and  training  center  building  will  be  the \nsame  as  that  for  similar  construction  in  Bangladesh.  The  mitigation  measures  will  also  be  the \nsame.  \n\n                                                 \n2 Department of Forest, Ministry of Agriculture, Government of Bhutan.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n61\n\nE. \n\nEnvironmental Management Plan \n\n1. \n\nKey Mitigation and Monitoring Actions \n\nThe  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  is  aimed  at  ensuring  that  the  adverse \n23. \nimpact associated with the Project is properly mitigated to an acceptable level through the most \ntechnically and economically feasible option, if not prevented outright. The EMP will also ensure \nthat  the  positive  impact  is  sustained  and  enhanced.  The  EMP  consists  of  a  set  of  mitigation, \nmonitoring,  and  institutional  measures  to  be  taken  in  a  time-bound  manner  during  the  design, \nconstruction, and operation stages of the Project. The EMP also includes the actions needed for \nthe  implementation  of  these  measures.  The  EMP  has  been  developed,  but  no  detailed \nenvironmental monitoring plan has been prepared at this stage because the residual impact is \nassumed  to  be  insignificant.  The  monitoring  proposed  is  to  be  limited  to  ensuring  compliance \nwith EMP commitments.  \n\na. \n\nImplementation Period for Mitigation Measures \n\n24. \nThe  mitigation  measures  to  be  implemented  will  depend  on  the  nature  of  the  impact \nassociated  with  the  various  project  activities.  The  implementation  period  will  coincide  with  the \nfinal project implementation schedule.  \n\nb. \n\nContingency Response Plan \n\n25. \nThe Project may have one primary environmental emergency\u2014fire at access gateways, \nCECs,  and  border-connectivity  townships\u2014plus  pollution  and  waste  discharge.  The  requisite \nfire protection infrastructure should be provided at these locations. A communication system for \nexclusively this purpose should also be established with fire departments. \n\nc. \n\nAuthorities and Implementation Responsibility \n\n26. \nThe authorities and responsibilities for the implementation of the EMP should reside with \nthe  country  executing  agencies  (EAs).  All  policy  decisions,  including  the  incorporation  of  the \nEMP requirements, will be the responsibility of the EAs, which will ensure, through responsible \ndepartments, that the environmental mitigation measures are implemented effectively. For this \npurpose, the EAs will designate officials to coordinate activities related to EMP implementation. \nThose officials may hire external consultants for any additional environmental assessment.   \n\n2. \n\nInstitutional Capacity to Implement and Sustain Mitigation and Monitoring \n\n27. \nThe  SASEC  countries  do  not  have  environment  departments  or  officials.  For  the \neffective  implementation  of  the  EMP,  at  least  one  officer  will  be  designated  to  coordinate \nenvironmental  activities.  This  official  will  be  trained  to  manage  environmental  aspects  and \nundertake  environmental  assessment  for  the  development  of  new  CECs  as  well  as  the \ndevelopment and upgrading of in-country and cross-border links.  \n\nF. \n\nPublic Consultation \n\n28. \nGovernment  and  public perceptions of  the  Project  were  elicited  in  informal  and  ad  hoc \npublic consultations from 31 July to 3 August 2007 in Bhutan and Nepal, which were attended \nby  about  15  persons.  The  discussion  focused  mainly  on  the  development  of  CECs,  their \nfacilities,  and  the  setting  up  of  wireless  networks,  which  may  require  limited  site  clearing.  The \noutcome of the public consultations was very positive and the villagers were supportive of the \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nProject.  The  consultations  indicated  that  environmental  awareness  among  the  public  may  be \nenhanced with the help of e-centers.  \n\n29. \nFormal  consultations  and  meetings  were  held  with  government  officials  from  the \nenvironmental,  forest,  and  biodiversity  departments  in  the  four  countries.  The  officials  were \napprised of the project components and the likely regulatory interfaces. From the discussions, it \nwas learned that no legislative clearance may be required if existing infrastructure is to be used. \nHowever,  for  newer  developments  or  site  clearance,  prior  approval  must  be  obtained  under \napplicable  environmental  laws.  The  applicable  requirements  have  been  assessed  and  have \nalready been incorporated into the EMP.   \n\n30. \nE-waste  is  not  yet  a  priority  concern  in  any  of  the  countries.  No  legislation  governing \ne-waste  is  in  place.  At  any  rate,  e-waste  from  the  Project  is  likely  to  be  very  small  in  quantity \nand generated over a long span of time. Recycling or reuse of e-waste is considered to be the \nbest management option. \n\nG. \n\nConclusions and Recommendation \n\n31. \nThe proposed project components will cause insignificant adverse environmental impact. \nEnvironmental impact is likely to be caused by the development of CECs and cross-border links \nbetween Bangladesh and India. Some impact is also likely to be caused during the operation of \nnetwork access gateways, border township facilities, and CECs. The impact is associated with \nthe disposal of office and e-waste, which is recyclable, and domestic sewage, which can be fully \ntreated.  The  implementation  of  prescribed  mitigation  measures  will  minimize  the  predicted \nimpact during project design and development as well as operation. \n\n32. \nThe  development  of  CECs,  the  setting  up  of  wireless  connectivity  poles,  and  the \ndevelopment  of  cross-border  links  between  Bangladesh  and  India  may  require  the  cutting  of \ntrees,  the  development  of  access,  or  the  acquisition  and  clearing  of  additional  land.  If  so,  the \nprovisions  of  the  following  country-specific  environmental  laws  with  respect  to  obtaining \npermission for the felling of trees, the diversion of forestland, and environment protection are to \nbe followed:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nBhutan:  Forests  and  Nature  Conservation  Act  of  Bhutan  (1995),  Rules  (2006), \nand Environment Assessment Act (2000)/Rules (2002).  \nNepal:  Environment  Protection  Act  (1997)/Rules  (1997)  and  National  Park  and \nWild Life Conservation Act (1973)/Rules (1974) (amended 1985). \nBangladesh:  Environment  Conservation  Act  (1995),  The  Forest  Act  (1927) \n(amended 2000). \nIndia:  Environment  (Protection)  Act,  1986  (amended  2006)  and  Forests \nConservation Act. 1980 (amended 1988). \n\n33. \nThe  environmental  assessment  was  carried  out  at  the  project  preparatory  stage.  The \nalignment for connectivity between Bangladesh and India is yet to be firmed up, and so is the \nadditional  CECs  or  wireless  connectivity  routing.  These  activities  and  any  change  in  the \nactivities defined under Section II above may require the preparation of additional environmental \nassessment, which must be submitted to ADB for approval. The EMP also needs to be revised \naccordingly.  The  necessary  environmental  clearances  in  the  various  countries  must  also  be \nobtained before the start of the activity. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n63\n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\nIntroduction \n\nA. \n \nThe  proposed  Project  comprises  SASEC  regional  network  (SASECRN),  which  is  to \n1. \nestablish  robust  data  interchange  capacity  among  the  four  SASEC  member  countries,  and \nSASEC  village  network  (SASECVN).  SASECRN  will  replace  microwave  facilities,  providing \nefficient  access,  with  redundancy,  to  submarine  cables  for  Bhutan  and  Nepal.  It  will  lower \ninternet connecting costs and increase service reliability and competition, thereby promoting an \nefficient  use  of  network  services  (e.g.,  reducing  latency  and  enhancing  local  peering). \n1  in  remote  rural  areas \nSASECVN  is  to  expand  ICT-accessibility  and  ICT-enabled  service(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nthrough the establishment of networks serving village communities in the countries. SASECVN \nhas  been  integrated  into  the  Project  to  spread  the  benefits  of  SASECRN  over  a  wider  cross-\nsection  of  rural  poor  communities  in  the  countries.  The  integrated  approach  will  ensure  to \nimprove  the  rural  communities\u2019  accessibility  to  information  and  economic  opportunities,  and \nthereby maximize the Project\u2019s benefits.  \n \n2. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  2  years.  The  economic  analysis  covers  the \nfollowing  15  years  of  full  operation.  Economic  evaluation  was  undertaken  using  2007  prices. \nThe residual values of SASECRN and SASECVN were assumed to be 10% of their acquisition \ncost. The operation and maintenance costs for optical fiber were assessed at 2% of its annual \ninstallation  cost,  and  operation  and  maintenance  costs  for  computer  equipment  at  3%  for  the \nfirst three years then increasing by 100 basis points each for three years as the equipment ages. \nAll cost elements were valued at border prices, using a world price numeraire, with all taxes and \nduties  excluded.  A  standard  conversion  factor  of  0.9  was  applied  to  non-tradable  items  and \nlabors. \n \nB. \n \n\nProject Benefits \n\n1. \n\nSASEC-Regional Network \n\n \n3. \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the Project was estimated by comparing \nthe project case with a base case involving the continued use of the satellite. The installation of \n2 in Bangladesh and \nthe regional network will enable to connect the cable landing stations (CLS)(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nIndia  to  an  access  gateway,  and  then  distribute  internet  capacity  to  Nepal  and  Bhutan  via \nterrestrial links. \n \n4. \nThe economic benefits include: (i) savings in the cost connecting the internet service as \na result of SASECRN (accrued to Nepal and Bhutan), and (ii) incremental revenues which will \nbe paid by Nepal and Bhutan for the connection with CLS (accrued to India and Bangladesh). \nOther  economic  indirect  benefits  over  time  include  increased  incomes  and  economic  activities \nresulting from improved access to information and markets. But, these are, hardly quantifiable, \nnot included. \n \n5. \nWithout the Project, Nepal and Bhutan, which are currently not connected with any CLS, \nhave to depend on satellite to access internet, in particular very small aperture terminals (VSAT). \nVSAT  are  twice  expensive  in  general  than  terrestrial  links  through  CLS.  At  present,  a  per-\nmegabyte  per-month  cost  for  VSAT  is  about  $1,500.  At  present,  the  maximum  capacity  of \n\n                                                 \n1 ICT-enabled services include voice, chatting, video conference, education, health, and governance. \n2 It refers to the location where a submarine or other underwater cable makes landfall \n\n \n\n\f64 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\ninternet access from VSAT allocated to Nepal and Bhutan is 200 megabytes and 40 megabytes, \nrespectively. \n \n6. \nWith  the  Project,  Nepal  and  Bhutan  will  have  a  better  option:  instead  of  relying  on \nexpensive satellite to access internet, they will attain bigger internet access capacity from CLS, \nwith  the  negotiated  payment  of  operation  fees  to  India  and  Bangladesh.  The  internet  access \ncapacity  that  Nepal  and  Bhutan  can  purchase  will  be  at  minimum  about  three  times  bigger, \namounting  to  a  total  of  775  megabytes  per  month:  620  megabytes  and  155  megabytes  for \nNepal and Bhutan, respectively. \n \n7. \nWith the implementation of SASECRN, the costs that Nepal and Bhutan need to pay to \nconnect CLS through Bangladesh or India consist of land costs of internet capacity, in-country \nhaulage cost to the access gateway, and cross-border haulage to the access gateway. Details \nare as follow: \n \n\nLanded cost of internet capacity. India has two CLS and Bangladesh one and \nthe  comparable  cost  is  about  $500  per  month  per  megabyte  regardless  of  the \nlanding.  \n\nIn-country  haulage  cost  to  the  access  gateway.  India\u2019s  cost  for  in-country \nhaulage  is  based  on  prevailing  prices  offered  by  three  carriers:  RailTel,  PGCI, \nand BSNL. The cost is a regulated price and is based on distance, however, all \ncarriers  can  discount  this  cost  to  suit  the  market.  In  case  of  Bangladesh,  no \nmarket price is available. It is assumed that the price, once set in the market, will \nbe in the level that may be comparable to India. \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\nCross-border  haulage  to  the  access  gateway  \u2013  Both  Nepal  and  Bhutan  will \nneed to haul the internet capacity to their respective Access Gateways. The cost \nused for this analysis was confirmed by the individual in-country carriers through \nthe consultation process. \n\n \n8. \nTable  A12.1  shows  the  comparable  cost  for  internet  capacity.  Incremental  revenues \nincurred  to  India  and  Bangladesh  as  a  result  of  the  Project  was  computed  by  summing  total \nrevenues collecting from Nepal and Bhutan for their access to CLS. The increased capacity for \nBhutan and Nepal was assumed to be absorbed for a period of 5 years after completion of the \nSASECRN. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n65\n\nTable A12.1: Comparable Cost for Internet Capacity \n\nItem \nInternational internet cost \nIn-country internet haulage cost \nIn-country haulage costs \n   Bhutan terrestrial network \n   Nepal terrestrial network \n\nRail Tel \n\n $ 500.00 \n $ 149.69 \n\nPGCI \n $ 500.00  \n $ 104.61  \n\nBSNL \n $ 500.00 \n $ 146.13 \n\n $ 73.03 \n $ 55.35 \n\n $ 73.03  \n $ 55.35  \n\n $ 73.03 \n $ 55.35 \n\nPer megabyte per month cost for \nBhutan \nPer megabyte per month cost for Nepal \n\n$ 722.72\n\n$ 677.64\n\n$ 719.16\n\n$705.04\n\n$ 659.96\n\n$701.48\n\n$ 822.36\n\n$ 777.28\n\nVSAT cost per megabyte per month  \ncurrently paid by Bhutan and Nepal: \n$1,500 \n \nPotential per megabyte per month cost \nsavings for Bhutan  \nPotential per megabyte per month cost \nsavings for Nepal  \n \nCurrent capacity (megabytes per \nmonth) of Bhutan through VSAT \nCurrent capacity (megabytes per \nmonth) of Nepal through VSAT \n \n$ 31,233.60\nCost saving per month for Bhutan \nCost saving per month for Nepal \n$159,792.00\nBSNL  =  bharat  sanchar  nigam  ltd.,  PGCI  =  power  grid  corporation  of  India,  VSAT  =  very  small \naperture terminals, \nSource: Consultant\u2019s report. \n\n$32,894.40\n$168,008.00\n\n$ 31,091.20\n$158,992.00\n\n$ 780.84\n\n$ 794.96\n\n$ 798.96\n\n$ 840.04\n\n200\n\n200\n\n200\n\n40\n\n40\n\n40\n\n2. \n\nSASEC Village Network  \n\n \nAgriculture  Productivity  Increase.  Research  suggests  that  increasing  agricultural \n9. \nproductivity  benefits  the  poor  and  landless  through  increased  employment  opportunities. \nConsidering  the  vast  majority  of  poor  people  live  in  rural  areas  and  derive  their  livelihoods \ndirectly or indirectly from agriculture, support for farming is a high priority for rural development. \nICT can deliver useful information/data to farmers in the form of crop care, animal husbandry, \nfertilizer  and  feedstock  inputs,  drought  mitigation,  pest  control,  irrigation,  weather  forecasting, \nseed  sourcing  and  market  demand  and  prices.  Again  India  has  shown  the  way  forward  in  the \ndelivery of economic benefits through ICT deployment in agriculture. An illustration is the use of \na network of tele-centers to coordinate the planting of tomatoes in order to achieve a constant \nsupply to the markets at a more regulated and regular price. Previously the farmers unknowingly \nharvested  their  produce  at  the  same  time  creating  an  oversupply  at  one  given  time  thus \nreducing price and conversely when there was a high demand, the produce was not available. \n \n10. \nIt  is  through  this  illustration  that  ICT  agricultural  enabled  applications  can  deliver \nsignificant economic benefit and the timely delivery of seasonal weather information will improve \nthe yield of certain crops, particularly rice. Current crop production of rice yields approximately \n20 quintals per acre at an average price of around $ 30 per quintal. The average crop yield is \nabout one per annum for a farmer with little forecasting information available. Given the correct \nweather  information  a  farmer  can  triple  his  yield  over  one  year  by  implementing  preventive \n\n \n\n\f66 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\ndrought measures, re-directing water supplies and preventive care measures for the farm.  As \nper  the  aforementioned  illustration,  this  is  achieved  through  the  network  delivering  timely  and \naccurate  information  to  the  farmers.  The  project  will  deliver  connectivity  to  110  rural \ncommunities where rice production is predominant. The mean acreage per community has been \nassessed at 5 acres and the additional yield per annum is assumed to be one fold of the current \nyields  being  experienced  as  an  average  throughout  the  member  countries.  This  agricultural \nproductivity improvement is considered in the EIRR calculation.  \n \nCeCs Employment Creation. There are 3 areas of employment opportunity that arises \n11. \nfrom the implementation of the Project, namely (i) unemployed people can use the network to \ndiscover job opportunities; (ii) they can become employed in new jobs that are created through \nthe deployment of ICTs; and (iii) they are up-skilled via specific education programs that support \nthe SASEC regional network and CEC deployment. Based on the India experience, the new job \ncreation  delivered  from  the  opening  of  telecenters  is  about  2  new  jobs  per  centre.  The  up-\nskilling of employed people is about the same per telecenter location once delivery either from \ndistance  learning  programs  or  the  use  of  appropriate  training  institutes.  For  this  analysis  the \nnew job creation has been assessed at the lowest possible earning capacity and being a mean \nacross the member countries of $ 50 per month and an up-skilled worker (being employed on \nthe lowest possible earning capacity) incremental change being an additional $ 30 per month. \nThis improvement is considered in the EIRR calculation.  \n \nC. \n \n12. \nThe  EIRR  of  the  Project  was  estimated  at  34.3%.  The  economic  cost  and  benefit \nstreams  are  in  Table  A12.2.  The  sensitivity  of  the  EIRR  was  tested  for  the  cases  (i)  when  no \nindirect benefits  are  included;  (ii)  when  the  project  benefits  are  reduced  by  20%;  (ii)  when  the \nproject cost increases by 20%; and (iv) when case (ii) and case (iii) are combined. The results of \nthe sensitivity analysis are shown in Table A12.3. \n \n\nEIRR and Sensitivity Analysis \n\nTable A12.2: Project Cost and Benefits Stream \n\nYear \n\nInitial \nInvestment \n\nProject Cost \nOperation \nand \nMaintenance \n\n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \n2018 \n2019 \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \n( ) = negative. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n969 \n12,230 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(2,020) \n\n \n \n245 \n245 \n245 \n327 \n327 \n327 \n408 \n408 \n408 \n490 \n490 \n490 \n572 \n572 \n572 \n\nTotal \n\n969 \n12,230 \n245 \n245 \n245 \n327 \n327 \n327 \n408 \n408 \n408 \n490 \n490 \n490 \n572 \n572 \n(1,448) \n\n \n\nProject Benefits \n\nDirect \nBenefits \n\nIndirect \nBenefits \n\nTotal \n\n0 \n0 \n5,719 \n6,571 \n7,424 \n8,276 \n9,128 \n9,128 \n9,128 \n9,128 \n9,128 \n9,128 \n9,128 \n9,128 \n9,128 \n9,128 \n9,128 \n\nNet Total \n\n       (969) \n  (19,230) \n5,474 \n6,326 \n7,179 \n7,949 \n8,802 \n8,802 \n8,720 \n8,720 \n8,720 \n8,638 \n8,638 \n8,638 \n8,557 \n8,557 \n10,576 \n\n \n \n547 \n547 \n547 \n547 \n547 \n547 \n547 \n547 \n547 \n547 \n547 \n547 \n547 \n547 \n547 \n\n \n \n5,172 \n6,025 \n6,877 \n7,729 \n8,581 \n8,581 \n8,581 \n8,581 \n8,581 \n8,581 \n8,581 \n8,581 \n8,581 \n8,581 \n8,581 \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n67\n\nTable A12.3: Sensitivity Analysis \n\nCase \nNo indirect benefits included \nProject benefits reduced by 20% \nProject cost increased by 20% \nProject  benefits  reduced  by  20%  and  project \ncost increased by 20% \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nEIRR (%) \n31.9 \n27.6 \n28.7 \n\n22.7 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 20 November 2007) \n", "Currency Unit of Bangladesh\nTk1.00\n$1.00\n", "Currency Unit of Bhutan\nNu1.00\n$1.00\n", "Currency Unit of India\nRe1.00\n$1.00\n", "Currency Unit of Nepal\nNRe1.00\n$1.00\n", " \n", "taka (Tk)  \n", "\u2013 \n=  $0.0146 \n=  Tk68.59 \n \n\u2013  ngultrum (Nu) \n=  $0.0254 \n=  Nu39.34 \n \n\u2013 \n=  $0.0254 \n=  Rs39.34 \n \n\u2013  Nepalese rupee/s (NRe/NRs) \n=  $0.0159 \n=  NRs62.944 \n", " \nIndian rupee/s (Re/Rs) \n", " \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nADF \nCEC \nCLS \nEA \nEIRR \nEMP \nGDP \nICT \nICTWG \nISP \nIT \nMDG \nNGO \nPMU \nROW \nSASEC \nSASECRN \nTA \nVSAT \n", "\u2013  Asian Development Bank \n\u2013  Asian Development Fund \n\u2013  community e-center   \n\u2013  cable landing station  \n\u2013  executing agency \n\u2013  economic internal rate of return  \n\u2013  environmental management plan \n\u2013  gross domestic product  \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Millennium Development Goal \n\u2013  nongovernment organization  \n\u2013  project management unit  \n\u2013 \n\u2013  South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation  \n\u2013  SASEC regional network \ntechnical assistance  \n\u2013 \n\u2013  very small aperture terminal  \n", "right-of-way \n", "information and communication technology \nInformation and Communication Technology Working Group \nInternet service provider \ninformation technology  \n", "WEIGHTS AND MEASURES \n", "km \nMB \n", "\u2013 \nkilometer \n\u2013  megabyte \n", " \nNOTE \n", "In this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to US dollars. \n", " \n", " \n", "Vice President \nDirector General \nDirector \n \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n \n", "L.
