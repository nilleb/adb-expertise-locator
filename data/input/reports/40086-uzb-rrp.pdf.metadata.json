The summary initial environmental  examinations are \nin Supplementary Appendix H. \n \nThe Project continues the support of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  for  the  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  irrigation  and \ndrainage  infrastructure  and  capacity  development  for  water \nmanagement. The Project is structured as a sector loan project. It \nwill involve two areas of the country: (i) the Zarafshan River Basin, \nand  (ii)  the  Fergana  Valley.  The  Project  will  (i)  rehabilitate  and \nupgrade pumping stations, (ii) rehabilitate and upgrade inter-farm \nirrigation  and  drainage  canals  and  structures,  and  (iii)  improve \ninter-farm  water  management  through  state  water  agencies  and \non-farm  management  through  water  users\u2019  associations  (WUAs). \nThe  primary  aim \nincreased  agriculture \nproductivity. \n \nAgriculture  remains  a  key  sector  of  the  economy  and  the  main \nsource  of  livelihood  for  the  rural  population.  Irrigation  and \ndrainage are key factors in agriculture, and critical to productivity, \ncompetitiveness,  and  environmental  management.  However,  the \ninfrastructure  is  deteriorating  rapidly.  Pump  stations  are  losing \ncapacity and the inter-farm facilities are contributing to substantial \nwater  losses.  Rehabilitation  of  pump  stations  and  inter-farm \ncanals  is  essential  to  avoid  the  partial  or  complete  collapse  of \nirrigation  systems,  with  consequent \nin  agricultural \nproduction  and  farm  incomes.  To  realize  the  full  benefit  of  the \ninfrastructure \nfor  more  effective \noperation and maintenance in the future, it is essential to improve \nwater  management  at  the  basin,  inter-farm  canal,  and  on-farm \nlevels.  \n \nThe  rehabilitation  needs  are  substantial,  but  the  level  of  funding \navailable  from  the  Government  and  development  partners  is \nlimited. This means prioritizing investments. The Government has \nrequested  the  focus  to  be  on  rehabilitation  of  pump  stations  and \nimproved  water \nrelated \nmanagement from the river basin to the WUA level. \n \n\nrehabilitation  and  provide \n\ninter-farm  canals, \n\ntogether  with \n\nlosses \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nProject Description \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n \n \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \n\nThe  Project\u2019s  expected  impact  is  sustained  and  increased \nagriculture  production  and  productivity.  The  expected  outcome  is \nirrigation  systems  fully  functional  and  operated  in  an  efficient \nmanner. \n \nThe investment cost of the Project is estimated at $148.0 million, \nincluding  taxes  and  duties,  physical  and  price  contingencies, \ninterest charges during implementation, and commitment charges. \n \nADB will provide a blend of two loans totaling $100 million: (i) $85 \nmillion  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  (OCR),  and  (ii)  an \nAsian  Development  Fund  (ADF)  loan  in  various  currencies \nequivalent to Special Drawing Rights 10.042 million (estimated at \n$15 million). The OCR loan will have a 26-year term, including a \ngrace period of 6 years, an interest rate determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  annum,  and  such \nother  terms  and  conditions  to  be  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan \nAgreement.  The  ADF  loan  will  have  a  32-year  term,  including  a \ngrace  period  of  8  years,  an  interest  rate  of  1%  yearly  during  the \ngrace period and 1.5% yearly after that, and such other terms and \nconditions as are set forth in the draft Loan Agreement. \n \nUntil 30 June 2015 \n \n31 December 2014 \n\n \nMinistry of Agriculture and Water Resources (MAWR) \n \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  6  years  starting  in  early \n2009. A project steering committee will guide policy and strategic \ndirection. A project director will be appointed by MAWR. A project \nmanagement office will be established within MAWR in Tashkent \nto  manage  day-to-day \nimplementation  activities.  Project \nimplementation units will be established in Samarkand city in the \nZarafshan River Basin and Fergana city in the Fergana Valley. A \nfull-time  project  manager,  who  will  be  acceptable  to  ADB,  will \nmanage  the  project  management  office,  while  deputy  managers \nwill oversee each project implementation units. \n \nThe Project will finance the procurement of equipment, civil works, \nand  consulting  services.  All  procurement  will  be  in  accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time \nto time). \n \n\n\fConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\niii\n\nThe  Project  will  provide  154  person-months  of  international \nconsulting services and 490 person-months of national consulting \nservices.  A  service  contract  for  WUA  training  will  be  executed. \nThe  consultants  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from \ntime to time), using the quality- and cost-based selection method \nfor a firm in addition to individual consultant engagements. \n \nlosses, \nProject  benefits \n(ii) increased energy efficiency, (iii) improved water management, \n(iv)  decreased  land  degradation  caused  by  soil  salinity  and \nwaterlogging,  (v)  increased  irrigation  efficiency,  (vi)  enhanced \nfarm productivity through increased yields and cropping intensity, \nand (vii) increased rural livelihoods. \n \nThe  Project  has  an  overall  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of \n15.5%.  Two  core  subprojects  analyzed  during  preparation  of  the \nProject had economic internal rate of return of 15.4% and 13.4%. \n \n\nreduced  production \n\ninclude \n\n(i) \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions  Major  risks  include  ineffective  project  management,  inadequate \nsystem  operation  and  maintenance  and  management,  and \nimplementation  delays  caused  by  cumbersome \ninternal \nGovernment  procedures.

A  problem  tree  analysis  is  in  Appendix  1  and  a  project  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 2. \n \nA. \n \nUzbekistan  recorded  per  capita  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  of  $814  in  2007.  GDP \n3. \ngrowth  rates  increased  from  3.8%  in  2000  to  4.4%  in  2003,  to  an  annual  average  of  over  7% \nduring  2004\u20132006 2  and  9.5%  in  2007. 3  Agriculture  growth  fluctuated  from  3.2%  in  2000,  to \n10.1% in 2004 to 6.1% in 2007. The share of agriculture in GDP declined from 30.1% in 2000 to \n24.1%  in  2006.  Despite  this  decline,  agriculture  remains  an  important  sector,  accounting  for \n70%  of  domestic  trade,  35%\u201340%  of  industrial  output  (about  7.8%  of  GDP),  25%  of  export \nearnings,  and  33%  of  employment.  While  poverty  declined  from  27.5%  in  2001  to  25.8%  in \n2005,  poverty  in  rural  areas  remains  high.  About  64%  of  the  population  lives  in  rural  areas. \nDetailed analysis of the sector is provided in Appendix 3.  \n \n4. \nUzbekistan is an arid country. It relies on the Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers and their \ntributaries to support irrigated agriculture. Water supply varies on a seasonal basis, with many \nareas  not  having  enough.  Irrigated  agriculture  accounts  for  over  90%  of  all  agricultural \nproduction  and  consumes  88%  of  all  water  resources\u201457  cubic  kilometers  annually.  The \ndevelopment  and  management  of  irrigation  and  drainage  infrastructure  and  improved  water \nmanagement are fundamental actions to ensure that agriculture continues to develop over the \nmedium term.  \n \n5. \nUzbekistan  has  about  4.3  million  hectares  (ha)  under  irrigation.  The  irrigation  network \nincludes  inter-farm  and  on-farm  systems.4  Irrigation  primarily  relies  on  surface  water,  which  is \ndistributed by gravity and pumps. The network includes (i) 30,000 kilometers (km) of main and \ninter-farm canals, with over 33,000 hydraulic structures; (ii) 1,500 pumping facilities, with almost \n5,000  pumps  that  supply  water  to  2  million  ha;  (iii)  175,000  km  of  on-farm  canals  and \nconveyance structures; (iv) 40,000 km of on-farm horizontal drains and 4,300 vertical drains; (v) \n120,000 km of drainage ditches; and (vi) 15,000 km of large drainage collectors. \n \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n4   The inter-farm systems comprise the intake structures for water irrigation supply, the main and distributary canals \nthat convey water to the farm level outlets, and the large collectors drains that move drainage water from irrigated \nareas. The on-farm system includes the smaller field channels and associated structures that distribute water to the \nfarmers\u2019 fields, and the smaller drainage systems that take water from the field and lower the water table to prevent \nsalinization and waterlogging. \n\n\f2 \n\nThe farming structure has evolved since independence. Shirkat farms were created from \n6. \nSoviet  collective  farms,  but  all  were  transformed  into  private  farms  by  the  end  of  2007.  There \nare now about 190,000 private farms with an average area of 26 ha. Shirkat farm operations are \nstill  controlled  by  the  Government  through  the  quota  and  state  order  system,  especially  in  the \ncase  of  the  strategic  commodities  of  cotton  and  wheat.  These  also  receive  credit  and  inputs \nfrom  the  Government.  Almost  1.8  million  people  are  employed  on  private  farms.  These  farms \nproduce  32%  of  agricultural  output,  including  86%  of  raw  cotton  and  73%  of  grain  crops.  The \nstate  order  system  has  been  relaxed  over  the  decade,  and  farms  can  now  sell  50%  of  their \nwheat and cotton production to the open market. This is having a good impact on productivity \nand  the  system  will  continue  to  be made  more  flexible.  Cotton  comprises  41%  of  the  irrigated \narea and wheat comprises 42%. The production system remains inefficient, and excess water \nuse  contributes  to  salinity  and  land  degradation.  The  cropping  pattern  does  not  allow  for \nperiodic  fallowing  of  land  or  rotation  with  fodder  or  other  crops  to  replenish  soil  nutrients  and \nabsorb salts. Dekhan farms are small inheritable household plot (0.15\u20130.35 hectares) free from \nGovernment  quotas  for  crop  selection  and  marketing.  Their  land  use  rights  have  been \ntransferred  to  private  individuals.  This  allows  for  secure  possession,  inheritance,  and  free \ncropping patterns. There are 4 million\u20135 million small dekhan farms. They produce nearly one \nfifth of the country\u2019s grains and almost all of the horticulture output. They also provide important \ncash flow to farmers. \n \nCotton  remains  the  priority  crop,  and  Uzbekistan  is  the  world\u2019s  sixth  largest  producer. \n7. \nThe  Government  plans  to  increase  the  domestic  use  of  cotton  fibers  and  raise  value  added \nthrough the development of a better textile industry. Wheat is the other priority crop, with self-\nsufficiency achieved in 1997. Because of fluctuations in food prices and the current world food \nsecurity situation, the Government intends to maintain its policy of wheat self-sufficiency.  \n \nB. \n \nIrrigation  and  Drainage  Needs.  Although  the  infrastructure  was  well  built,  its  current \n8. \ncondition  is  poor,  primarily  because  of  lack  of  investment  and  inadequate  maintenance. \nGovernment investment in agriculture as a whole has declined from 27% of all investments in \n1991  to  8%  in  2001.  From  1995  to  2002,  government  funding  for  the  water  network  dropped \nfrom 3% to under 2% of GDP. Expenditure in operation and maintenance (O&M) has slowed by \none third. It is estimated that deferred capital and O&M expenditures amounts to 40% of asset \nvalue. \n \nThe irrigation and drainage system needs substantial rehabilitation and upgrading (R&U) \n9. \nand  water  losses  are  high.  Some  structures  are  at  risk  of  total  failure,  which  would  cause \nagricultural  production  and  farm  incomes  to  decline  dramatically.  Investment  is  needed  in \nseveral areas: (i) total reconstruction of 32% of the main and inter-farm canals; (ii) repair of 24% \nof the main and inter-farm canal network; (iii) rebuilding of 42% of the on-farm irrigation network, \nand  repair  of  17%;  (iv)  replacement  and  modernization  of  mechanical  equipment  of  18  of  the \n42 large  intake  structures,  and  reconstruction  of  5;  (v)  16  of  the  27  inspected  reservoirs  are \nnonfunctional  or  threatened  with  sedimentation;  (vi)  19,000  km  of  on-farm  drainage  need  de-\nsilting,  and  11,500  km  of  open  and  subsurface  drains  need  reconstruction  or  repair;  and \n(vii) only 50% of the subsurface horizontal drainage systems are operational. The limited use of \nwater-efficient irrigation technologies means an unneeded 10%\u201315% of water supply is required \nfor irrigation. The high water table and use of drainage water for irrigation increases salinity and \nrequires  substantial  water  for  leaching.  Sustained  investment  in  R&U  and  better  O&M  will \nprevent further deterioration and ensure stability in the farming system. \n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n\f \n \n\nPumped irrigation and drainage is ubiquitous and poses special challenges. It includes \n10. \nthe  three  massive  irrigation  pump  cascade  systems  from  the  Amu  Darya  (which  includes  the \nAmu  Bukhara,  Karshi,  and  Amu  Zhang  systems).  Together,  these  systems  irrigate  over \n800,000 ha of land. Amu Zhang is currently being rehabilitated under a project financed by ADB. \nThe  other  two  large  cascades  also  need  urgent  rehabilitation.5  Smaller  pump-based  irrigation \nfacilities  are  located  throughout  the  gravity  irrigation  networks,  with  schemes  of  10,000  ha  of \nfarmland commonly reliant on pumps. Almost all pumps are operating beyond their design life, \nand their maintenance and repair has been poor. Pumps are starting to fail or threatening to do \nso.  Of  the  76  very  large  pumping  facilities  with  capacities  greater  than  100  cubic  meters  per \nsecond  (m3/sec),  60  require  immediate  rehabilitation.  In  addition,  400  of  the  1,000  smaller \npumped  systems,  with  capacities  less  than  10  m3/sec,  need  immediate  rehabilitation  or \nreplacement.  Pumped  irrigation  absorbs  70%  of  the  annual  O&M  budget  of  the  Ministry  of \nAgriculture and Water Resources (MAWR). It consumes 20% of Uzbekistan\u2019s electricity, and the \noutdated equipment consumes 20%\u201325% more electricity than modern equipment. Substantial \ninvestment is needed to convert the pumped system into efficient and cost-effective operations. \nThe  efficiency  of  smaller  pumped  systems  can  be  improved  through  new  technology,  more \ndemand-responsive operating regimes, and improved irrigation techniques. \n \n11. \nThe  total  land  area  of  the  country  is  18  million  ha,  of  which  25%  is  arable  land  and \nlargely  irrigated.  The  degraded  state  of  irrigation  and  drainage  infrastructure,  combined  with \npoor water management, result in low water use efficiency and agricultural productivity. Average \nwater withdrawal for irrigation is 14,000 cubic meters (m3) per ha, compared with 9,000 m3 per \nha to 10,000 m3 per ha in countries with similar climates. Irrigation efficiency nationwide is only \nabout 40% resulting in wasted water, overloaded drainage systems, environmental degradation, \nand worsening land salinization. MAWR estimates that more than 20,000 ha of land goes out of \nproduction each year because of salinity. The salinity affects cotton yields, which decline 20%\u2013\n30%  on  slightly  salinized  land,  but  up  to  80%  on  highly  salinized  land.  Some  degree  of \nsalinization and waterlogging affects 47% of all irrigated land. Productivity in irrigated agriculture \ndropped by 15% in the immediate post-Soviet era. Although recovering slowly, much more work \nis  required  to  improve  agricultural  productivity.  Yields  are  low  at  2.25  tons  per  ha  (t/ha)  in  the \ncase of cotton and 4.2 t/ha for wheat.  \n \nInstitutional Framework and Management of Irrigation and Drainage. The legal and \n12. \nregulatory  framework  for  irrigation  and  drainage  is  derived  from  the  Law  on  Water  and  Water \nUse, 1993. This addresses water rights and allocation, O&M of irrigation and drainage systems, \nand  resolution  of  water  disputes.  Other  decrees  and  laws  support  the  establishment  of  the \ninstitutions  responsible  for  water  resources  and  irrigation  and  drainage.  A  generally  sound \nframework for water management and irrigation is in place, but additional supporting legislation \nand  revisions  to  existing  laws  are  under  preparation  to  define  more  clearly  and  establish  the \nrights and roles of water users\u2019 associations (WUAs) within the irrigation sector.6 \n \nThe total runoff for water resources generated in Uzbekistan is about 11.5 m3 per year \n13. \nwhile  the  total  demand  for  irrigation  is  about  57  m3,  with  the  balance  coming  from  upstream \ncountries  via  the  Syr  Darya  and  Amu  Darya  rivers.  In  1992,  the  Central  Asian  republics 7  \n\n                                                 \n5   ADB.  2003.

In the current absence of permanent water-sharing agreements, allocation is decided \ntwice  a  year  on  an  ad  hoc  basis  under  ICWC  and  managed  by  the  basin  water  management \norganizations under ICWC. ADB has just launched a new technical assistance to reestablish a \nlong-term water allocation system among the countries in the region.8 \n \n14.  MAWR has overall responsibility for water resources. Within MAWR, the Directorate for \nWater Management (DWM) is the primary organization responsible for the development, O&M, \nand management of irrigation and drainage infrastructure. DWM was reorganized in 2003 from \na  provincial  and  district  administrative  basis  to  a  water  basin  set-up  in  which  irrigation  and \ndrainage  are  managed  by  basin  irrigation  system  administrations  (BISAs)  under  DWM.9  The \nterritory of each BISA is organized into main canal administrations (MCAs) and irrigation system \nadministrations  (ISAs).  Although  the  reorganization  into  BISAs  was  an  improvement  for \nmanagement  of  water  resources  and  irrigation,  BISAs  need  improved  irrigation  and  water \nmanagement  procedures  and  practices \nImproved \ncoordination  and  clarification  of  responsibilities  among  BISAs,  MCAs,  ISAs,  and  WUAs  would \nalso improve water management efficiency. Capacity building to improve the technical skills of \nthe BISAs, MCAs, and ISAs for irrigation, drainage, and water management must complement \nany inter-farm investment in infrastructure to help realize its full potential. \n \n15.  Water  Users\u2019  Associations.  With  the  conversion  of  the  shirkats  to  private  farms,  the \nformer  state-supported  O&M  and  management  of  the  on-farm  irrigation  and  drainage \ninfrastructure  is  no  longer  available.  By  law,  WUAs  have  the  responsibility  to  operate  the  on-\nfarm system and allocate water to farmers, yet the experience with WUAs in Uzbekistan is still \ndeveloping. Although WUAs have been established, no institutionalized program within MAWR \nexists  to  provide  training,  equipment,  or  other  resources  to  support  their  development.  Their \nsizes  and  responsibilities  also  vary,  depending  on  the  type  and  complexity  of  the  system. \nFinancial  sustainability  is  difficult  since  membership  fees  are  low,  as  is  the  rate  of  collection \nfrom farmers. The WUAs also have limited options in their ability to extract payment. The Swiss \nAgency  for  Development  and  Cooperation  (SDC)  has  the  most  experience  in  supporting \nprograms that provide training for WUAs and has ongoing programs for WUA training and water \nmanagement in Fergana Valley.10 This program has been implemented through a joint venture \nof  the  International  Water  Management  Institute  (IWMI)  and  the  Interstate  Commission  for \nWater  Coordination,  Scientific  Information  Center  (ICWC  SIC).  The  approach  importantly \nincludes  organizing  the  WUAs  based  on  hydrologic  boundaries  consistent  with  best  practice. \nThe program has significantly improved WUA performance for water management and system \nO&M, and provides experience from which to scale up a broader training effort. \n \n16. \nOn-farm  water  management  is  under  the  supervision  of  the  WUAs  where  additional \ntraining is needed. Efficiency improvements can be achieved through better coordination of ISA \nstaff  operating  the  inter-farm  systems  and  WUA  staff  operating  on-farm  systems  to  optimize \nwater  deliveries.  In  pump  systems,  which  have  greater  flexibility  and  can  be  more  demand-\nresponsive,  better  communication  and  coordination  between  WUAs  and  ISA  staff  could  yield \n\n                                                 \n8   ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance for the Improved Management of Water Resources in Central Asia. Manila. \n9  Ten  basin  irrigation  system  administrations  (BISA)  were  formed.  BISAs  are  organized  more  on  the  existing \nirrigation and drainage system infrastructure rather than the country\u2019s natural watersheds or catchments. However, \nthe organization is based on hydrologic boundaries, and is a more logical way to manage irrigation and drainage \nthan the previous system. \n\n10  In the Kyrgyz Republic, where SDC initiated WUA development before Uzbekistan, early results indicate a savings \n\nin water use from 6,000 m3/ha to 4,900 m3/ha in some areas. \n\n\f \n \n\nsubstantial benefits. WUAs play a vital role in improving the productivity of irrigated agriculture \nand water management, yet require greater support to fulfill this mandate more effectively. \n \n17. \nStrategic Sector Work. During preparation of the Project, a draft Medium-Term Sector \nStrategy  and  Investment  Plan  was  prepared  for  irrigation,  drainage,  and  water  resources  in \ndiscussion with the Government (Supplementary Appendix A). The strategy is derived primarily \nfrom  the  substantial  policy  work  that  has  already  been  conducted  in  Uzbekistan  for  irrigation, \ndrainage and water resources. The strategy focuses on maximizing returns and increasing the \nproductivity  of  water  use.  Essential  to  this  strategy  is  improved  water  use  efficiency  to  be \nachieved  in  part  through  targeted  R&U  investment  of  the  inter-farm  irrigation  system.  Many \npump  schemes  are  currently  operating  very  inefficiently  and  have  effectively  exceeded  their \ndesign  life.  The  failure  of  the  pumps  will  result  in  catastrophic  agricultural  productivity  losses, \nwith subsequent income and social implications, so selective R&U of pump schemes is a vital \ncomponent of the strategy and investment plan. In addition to infrastructure R&U, the strategy \ncalls  for  improved  water  management  at  both  the  on-farm  and  inter-farm  levels  through \nstrengthened institutions and capacity development. ADB and the Government will continue to \ndiscuss and refine the strategy, particularly in view of the additional studies being undertaken by \nthe World Bank and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).  \n \n18. \nIn  2000,  MAWR  and  the  World  Bank  published  the  Irrigation  and  Drainage  Sector \nStrategy and Study,11 which still provides relevant guidance to sector development. According \nto  the  strategy,  about  $23  billion  is  required  to  completely  rehabilitate  and  modernize  water \nresources  management,  irrigation  and  drainage  infrastructure.  The  World  Bank  is  currently \nfinalizing  an  updated  study,  the  Water  Sector  Investment  Plan:  Prioritization  of  Irrigation \nRehabilitation  and  Management,  which  includes  criteria  and  a  methodology  for  prioritizing \nirrigation infrastructure and a strategy for investment. 12 In 2007, the UNDP, in cooperation with \nMAWR,  prepared  a  comprehensive  overview  of  the  water  sector  in  Uzbekistan.  UNDP  has \nprepared  a  follow-on  proposal  for  an  integrated  water  resources  management  strategy  for \nUzbekistan, initially to be pilot tested in Zarafshan River Basin. \n \n19. \nThe  Government\u2019s  recent  Welfare  Improvement  Strategy  (2008\u20132010)  aims  to  reduce \npoverty to 20% in 2010 without increasing inequality of income. The strategy relies on irrigated \nagriculture  as  an  engine  for  growth  and  stresses  the  importance  of  investment  in  water \nresources  management,  irrigation,  and  drainage.  Restructuring  irrigated  agriculture  for  higher \nproductivity is essential to the strategy, which not only requires capital investment rehabilitation \nin  water  resources,  irrigation,  and  drainage,  but  also  includes  modernization  and  upgrading  of \nwater  management  systems,  expanded  use  of  water  efficient  technologies,  rehabilitation  and \nmodernization of pumping systems, and better water resources management at all levels. Other \nmeasures in the strategy include (i) development and implementation of a national program for \nimproved measurement of irrigation water, (ii) implementation of appropriate water user fees to \nencourage  the  efficient  use  of  water  and  cash  for  maintenance,  (iii)  programs  to  improve  the \nsustainability  of  irrigation  water  supply  to  water-stressed  regions,  and  (iv)  improving  the \nperformance of WUAs. According to the Welfare Improvement Strategy, the resources required \nfor land improvement and increasing water supply in irrigated lands for 2007\u20132011 is $2 billion, \nof which $900 million is expected to be financed by borrowings from development partners. In \n2007,  the  Government  established  the  Amelioration  Fund  to  address  its  strategic  drainage \npriorities,  with  a  budget  of  $65  million  equivalent.  It  has  identified  about  23,000  km  of  critical \n\n                                                 \n11 World Bank. 2000. Irrigation and Drainage Sector Strategy and Study.

ADB  continues  to  provide  support  to  the  R&U  of \nirrigation  and  drainage  infrastructure,  capacity  development,  and  policy  reforms  and  has  four \nongoing  projects.  The  Ak  Altin  Agricultural  Development  Project 13   is  strengthening  rural \ninstitutions (e.g., rural business advisory centers), rehabilitating on-farm and inter-farm drainage \nand  irrigation  systems,  and  establishing  farm  machinery  services.  The  Grain  Productivity \nImprovement Project14 is promoting wheat production in an economical and sustainable manner \nthrough  varietal  testing  and  development,  enhanced  farm  management  including  agricultural \nextension, technology development and irrigation repairs, and enterprise development for input \nsupply  and  processing.  The  Amu  Zhang  Irrigation  Rehabilitation  Project  is  increasing  the \nreliability, efficiency, and sustainability of water supply together with accelerating ongoing sector \nreforms  through  R&U  of  irrigation  systems;  improved  irrigation  management;  access  to  inputs \nand  technology;  and  reforms  in  production  quotas,  cost  recovery,  and  O&M  policy;  and  water \ndelivery  fees.  The  Land  Improvement  Project 15   is  improving  land  quality  and  productivity \nthrough  policy  reforms  (reduced  quotas,  deregulated  markets,  and  improved  land  tenure); \nrehabilitation  of  drainage  and  irrigation  infrastructure;  improved  management  practices;  and \ncapacity development for government and nongovernment water management organizations.  \n \nThere  is  diverse  ongoing  assistance  from  other  multilateral  and  bilateral  development \n21. \npartners  in  both  agriculture  and  water  resources.  The  World  Bank  is  financing  physical \ninvestment, capacity development, and policy reforms. Its engagement in the sector is similar to \nADB. In addition to its ongoing sector strategy development, the World Bank recently approved \nthe Rural Enterprise Support Project II to provide rural finance and business planning; on-farm \nand  inter-farm  irrigation  and  drainage  rehabilitation,  including  capacity  development  for  WUAs \nand  demonstrations;  and  rural  training  and  advisory  services  for  farmers  in  seven  districts  in \nseven  regions.  The  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  has  completed \nassistance  in  water  management  and  farmers\u2019  business  training.  SDC,  in  addition  to  WUA \nsupport, has programs for integrated water resources management, canal automation, and on-\nfarm water  management, and will continue to expand water management activities throughout \nthe Fergana Valley. A list of external assistance is in Appendix 4. \n \n22. \nFrom the substantial number of ADB and other development partners\u2019 projects that it has \nimplemented,  MAWR  has  received  significant  capacity  development  in  all  aspects  of  project \nmanagement.  Therefore,  MAWR  has  substantial  experience,  well  developed  capacity,  and  is \nextremely well acquainted with ADB procedures to manage ADB projects very effectively. \n \nLessons.  The  country  assistance  program  evaluation16  identified  key  lessons,  and  the \n23. \nfindings suggest problems with counterpart financing, O&M, and weakness of the public sector \ninstitutions  and  governance\u2014particularly  at  subnational  levels.  With  respect  to  irrigated \nagriculture,  the  evaluation  report  stated  that  pilot  reductions  in  production  quotas  have  been \nsuccessful but that their ultimate success would depend on the extent to which they are scaled \nup  across  the  sector.  Investment  has  arrested  the  collapse  of  irrigation  systems  and  a \n\n                                                \n \n13  ADB.  2002.

Irrigation  investments  need  improved  on-farm \nwater management practices to arrest salinization, waterlogging, and reductions in soil fertility. \nWater  management  at  all  levels  requires  critical  and  long-term  attention  to  ensure  improved \nwater  use  efficiency  and  sector  sustainability.  The  complexities  involved  in  introducing  water \ntariffs  and  charges  for  service  cannot  be  underestimated,  and  a  broad-based  program  that \naddresses  constraints  and  prepares  market  participants \nthe  development  and \nimplementation  of  a  tariff  regime  is  required.  The  country  assistance  program  evaluation \nmentions the need for a stronger geographic focus to increase synergies between projects. In \nterms of project implementation, the key lessons from experience in Uzbekistan are to (i) ensure \nstrong  government  ownership;  (ii)  reduce  start-up  delays  caused  by  the  requirements  for \nfeasibility studies to be approved by the Government prior to loan signing; (iii) reduce delays in \nprocurement; and (iv) closely monitor implementation, especially key results. The above lessons \nhave been incorporated into the design of the Project. \n \n24. \nRationale.  Agriculture  remains  a  key  sector  of  the  economy  and  the  main  source  of \nlivelihood for the rural population. Irrigation and drainage are essential for agriculture; and need \nsubstantial  financial  support  in  terms  of  investment,  capacity  development,  and  improved \nmanagement. The Government has given priority to  the rehabilitation of pump facilities. Given \ntheir  large  number,  the  alternatives  are  either  to  focus  on  single  larger  schemes,  as  was  the \ncase  with  Amu  Zhang  Irrigation  Rehabilitation  Project,  or  to  select  smaller  higher  priority \nschemes.  The  Government  has  opted  to  rehabilitate  and  upgrade  several  smaller  schemes \n(less than 15 m3/sec) together with related inter-farm irrigation and drainage canals that could \nexperience partial or complete collapse in the next few years. Because of the rapidly declining \ncapacity of some pump stations where individual pumps have ceased operation and cannot be \nrepaired, the Government has requested a strong geographic focus in terms of projects coupled \nwith improved water management from the BISA to the WUA level. ADB endorses this.  \n \n25. \nADB\u2019s  Strategy.  The  Project  is  in  full  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  long-term  strategic \nframework  2008\u20132020  (Strategy  2020). 17   Specifically,  irrigation  and  water  management  are \ncore  areas  for  infrastructure  investment  in  Strategy  2020.  The  Project  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s \ncountry strategy and program (2006\u20132010) for Uzbekistan that highlights the need to maintain \nthe water infrastructure and to strengthen water institutions as key development obje\n \n\nctives.\n\n18\n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nSector Investment Approach \n\n \nA. \n \n26. \nThe  Project  will  finance  investments  in  the  irrigation  and  drainage  sector,  especially \npumped  irrigation  systems.  As  a  part  of  its  sector  investment  plan,  the  Government  has \nidentified a list of priority projects throughout the country and has requested ADB to work in the \nFergana Valley and Zarafshan River Basin.19 The Fergana Valley is a strategic priority as it is \ndensely  populated  and  contributes  significantly  to  GDP.  It  is  a  highly  productive  region, \ncontaining  21%  of  the  irrigated  area  (910,000  ha)  but  providing  35%  of  all  agricultural \nproduction. About 45% of the irrigated area is served by pump irrigation. The Zarafshan River \nflows in from Tajikistan, and the associated irrigation system (575,000 ha) supports the second \nmost  important  agricultural  center  in  the  country.  About  30%  of  the  area  is  served  by  pump \n \n                                                \n17 ADB.  2008.  Strategy  2020:  The  Long-Term  Strategic  Framework  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  2008\u20132020. \n\nManila. \n\n18 ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program (2006\u20132010): Uzbekistan. Manila. \n19 For the purposes of the Project, the Fergana Valley comprises the Syrdarya-Sokh BISA, Naryn-Syrdarya BISA, and \n\nNaryn-Karadarya BISA, and the Zarafshan River Basin comprises the Zarafshan BISA. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nirrigation.  The  irrigation  and  drainage  infrastructure  in  these  two  strategic  regions  is  in  urgent \nneed of extensive R&U, including many pumped systems. Both areas also need improved water \nmanagement, especially in the Fergana Valley, which is covered by three separate BISAs and \nassociated institutions and has serious salinity problems in some areas. To support the sector \napproach,  two  core  subprojects  were  prepared  to  assess  the  technical,  social,  financial, \neconomic, and environmental feasibility of subsequent subprojects and the Project as a whole. \nThe  subprojects  are  representative  of  the  proposed  project  investments.  The  Narpay  and \nBesharyk core subproject feasibility studies are in Supplementary Appendixes B and C. \n \n27. \nNarpay  Core  Subproject.  The  Narpay  pump  system  is  located  in  Narpay  District  in \nnorthwest  Samarkand  Province.  The  area  has  a  continental  climate  with  an  average  annual \ntemperature  of  15\u00b0  centigrade  and  low  rainfall  (271  millimeters  [mm]),  most  of  which  occurs \nduring winter. The command area (8,206 ha) has sierozems (gray desert soils) characterized by \nlow organic content with moderate productivity potential. The average farm size is about 27 ha; \ncotton (57%) and wheat (30%) are the main crops and fodder vegetables, melons, and orchard \nand  vineyards  are  grown  on  a  smaller  scale.  The  pumping  plant  and irrigation system  receive \nwater from the Narpay primary canal, fed by the Zarafshan River. They were established in the \nearly 1970s and have undergone subsequent modification, including the addition of secondary \npumps  with  new  irrigated  area.  The  primary  pumping  plant  has  only  six  of  eight  pumps \noperational and their capacity is only about 75% of their design. This situation\u2014coupled with the \nunreliability  of  the  six  remaining  pumps\u2014results  in  frequent  partial  shutdowns  and  seriously \nlimits the water available for irrigation, particularly during peak demand for the cotton crop. The \ninter-farm canal system, which distributes water from the pumps, is in fair condition, yet portions \nexist  where  repair  and/or  replacement  of  the  concrete  lining  is  required;  existing  control \nstructures  need  repair  and/or  replacement;  and  a  number  of  additional  control  and \nmeasurement structures are required. The reduced and unreliable pumping plant output, along \nwith efficiency constraints of the distribution network, result in cotton yields considerably below \nthe average for the whole of Narpay District. In the absence of urgent R&U, the productivity of \nthe Narpay system will continue to decline and is in danger of partial or total collapse. \n \n28. \nBesharyk  Core  Subproject.  The  Besharyk  pump  irrigation  scheme  is  located  in \nBesharyk District of Fergana Province between the Syr Darya River to the north and Besharyk \ntown to the south. The semiarid area has an average annual air temperature of 15\u00b0 centigrade \nand very low rainfall (128 mm), with most during the winter months. The command area is about \n8,400  ha  and  has  typical  (34%)  and  light  (36%)  sierozem  soils  with  low  organic  content  and \nmoderate  production  potential.  Average  farm  size  is  about  32  ha  in  size;  cotton  (48%)  and \nwheat  (36%)  are  the  main  crops,  with  lesser  amounts  of  maize,  vegetables,  orchard,  and \nperennial  fodder  crops.  The  pumping  plant  takes  water  directly  from  the  Syr  Darya  River  and \nwas established in 1978. Both the capacity and the level of reliability have declined significantly. \nThe plant was designed with 10 pumps, eight for irrigation and two to supply water to extensive \nfishponds  in  the  area.  During  the  past  seven  seasons,  only  four  pumps  have  been  operating \nreliably,  seriously  limiting  irrigation  supplies.  Crop  production  in  the  subproject  area  is  also \nlimited  by  dysfunctional  inter-farm  and  on-farm  drains,  the  resultant  high  water  tables,  and \nassociated  increases  in  soil  salinity.  The  pumping  plant,  associated  inter-farm  distribution \nsystem, and the drainage network all require considerable R&U to prevent the possible partial or \ntotal collapse of the system. The inter-farm distribution network also needs to be expanded and \nrationalized to capture the full benefits associated with the production potential of the area. \n \n \n \n \n\n\f \n \n\n1. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\nRehabilitation and Upgrading of Irrigation and Drainage Infrastructure \n\nThe  Project  will  finance  investments  in  three  areas:  (i)  R&U  of  irrigation  and  drainage \n\nB. \n \n29. \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  is  sustained  and  increased  agriculture  production  and \nproductivity.  The  Project\u2019s  outcome  is  irrigation  and  drainage  systems  that  are  fully  functional \nand operated efficiently. \n \nC. \n \n30. \ninfrastructure, (ii) improved water resources management, and (iii) project management. \n \n \n \n31. \nProject  investments  will  focus  on  pumping  facilities;  gravity  head-works;  inter-farm \ndistribution canals and structures; and inter-farm and on-farm drainage to increase the reliability \nof  irrigation  supplies,  improve  water  distribution,  and  reduce  soil  degradation.  The  R&U  of \npumping facilities and replacement of pumps with more efficient equipment will result in energy \nsavings.  Indicative  types  of  R&U  include  (i)  pumping  stations  comprising  replacement  and/or \nrepair  of  intake  works,  including  bulkhead  gates  and  trash  racks;  replacement  of  pumps  and \nmotors;  upgrading  electrical  control  works;  replacement  of  problematic  and/or  unreliable \nreaches  of  the  rising  mains;  replacement  of  control  valves;  provision  of  appropriate  surge \nprotection systems; and repair or replacement of auxiliary works such as floor drains, overhead \ncranes,  and  ventilation  systems;  (ii)  improving  either  major  or  minor  surface  water  intakes  for \nboth pump and gravity systems to provide greater capture efficiencies and improved control; (iii) \nimproving control structures and gauging stations on inter-farm canals consistent with enhanced \nwater  management  targets;  (iv)  upgrading  and/or  replacing  gated  outlets  to  on-farm  canal \noutlets  from  the  inter-farm  canal  and  providing  a  means  for  measuring  the  discharge  at  each \noutlet point; (v) providing necessary rationalization of both alignment and grade of the inter-farm \ncanals; (vi) providing adequate cross drainage treatment for the inter-farm canals; (vii) providing \nauxiliary facilities associated with the inter-farm canals such as vehicle and pedestrian bridges \nand canal access for non-irrigation purposes; and (viii) agricultural drainage facilities, especially \nin subproject areas affected by high water table and/or levels of soil salinity.20  \n \n \n \n32. \nThe Project will support improved irrigation, drainage, and water resources management \nfrom  the  basin  to  the  on-farm  level.  The  Project  will  also  support  a  basin  and  irrigation  and \ndrainage  management  institutional  optimization  and  coordination  study  to  prepare  a  plan  and \ncapacity  development  program  to  improve  water  use  efficiency  and  productivity  for  inter-farm \nirrigation and drainage in the Fergana Valley. The study will (i) analyze existing institutional and \norganization structures of BISAs, ISA, MCA, Department of Pump Station Operations (DPSO), \nWUAs, \ntheir  existing \nmanagement  rules,  regulations,  procedures,  and  systems \nidentify  bottlenecks  and \ninefficiencies for irrigation, drainage, and water management; (iii) analyze coordination between \nwater management stakeholders; (iv) develop options and a plan to improve (a) the institutional \nand  organization  structures,  (b)  management  and  operational  procedures  and  systems,21  and \n\nlocal  government,  and  other  relevant  stakeholders;  (ii)  analyze \n\nImproved Water Resources Management \n\nto \n\n2. \n\n                                                 \n20 Drainage  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  will  be  directed  to  all  levels  of  the  drainage  system  including  on-farm, \n\n21 This  will  include  use  of  improved  computing,  communications  and  networks,  management  information  systems, \n\ncollector, and transport drains. \n\nand other advanced technical options. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n(c) coordination between stakeholders; and (v) develop and implement a capacity development \nprogram to support the recommendations. \n \n33. \nAt  the  on-farm  level,  the  Project  will  strengthen  WUAs  and  improve  on-farm  water \nmanagement  through  a  training  program  based  on  the  successful  experience  of  the  SDC \nprogram  implemented  by  IWMI  and  ICWC  SIC.  WUA  officials  and  staff  will  be  trained  and \nprovided  materials  in  (i)  O&M  and  repairs,  (ii)  water  distribution  and  management,  (iii)  basic \nirrigation  system  design,  (iv)  crop  and  irrigation  scheduling,  (v)  system  monitoring  and \nevaluation  (M&E),  (vi)  management  and  collection  of  irrigation  service  fees,  (vii)  financial \nmanagement  and  auditing,  and  (viii)  dispute  resolution  mechanisms.  WUAs  will  review  the \ndesigns for the inter-farm R&U in their subproject area, and measurement capacity within the on-\nfarm distribution system will be improved for better water management. \n \n34. \nThe  Project  will  work  with  BISA,  ISA,  MCA,  DPSO,  and  WUA  staff  to  develop  water \nmanagement  and  O&M  plans  for  each  subproject.  WUAs,  in  cooperation  with  BISA,  ISA,  and \nDPSO, will develop specific management plans to optimize on-farm water delivery for efficiency \nand  productivity  that  will  be  supported  through  improved  coordination  and  more  efficient  inter-\nfarm  distribution  and  pump  operation.  To  support  creation  and  implementation  of  the \nmanagement and O&M plans, training will be provided to relevant staff in subproject areas. \n \n\n3. \n\nProject Management \n\nSpecial Features \n\n \n35. \nThe  Project  will  provide  implementation  support  to  the  project  management  office \n(PMO),  which  will  be  established  in  Tashkent.  This  will  be  supported  by  two  project \nimplementation  units  (PIUs)\u2014one  in  Fergana  city  and  one  in  Samarkand  city.  The  PMO  will \ndeal with technical issues, procurement, accounting, M&E, water resources management, and \nsafeguards. The PMO and PIUs will have national staff supported by national and international \nspecialists. Comprehensive results-based monitoring will be a critical function of the PMO. \n \nD. \n \n36. \nThe Project represents a shift from previous assistance to Uzbekistan in that its focus is \non the R&U of pumps and inter-farm canals and structures and associated water management. \nThe  R&U  of  irrigation  infrastructure  will  introduce  more  efficient  pumps  to  improve  both  water \nuse and energy efficiency. The Project explicitly recognizes Uzbekistan\u2019s need to improve water \nuse  efficiency  and  productivity,  and  uses  a  comprehensive  approach  to  implement  improved \nwater  management  measures  at  the  (i)  overall  basin  level  with  BISAs;  (ii)  inter-farm  level \nthrough improved water management and operations of the canal commands and pumps of the \nsubprojects; and (iii) on-farm level through the training of WUAs to manage the on-farm systems \nmore effectively. It will strengthen integration of operations between inter- and on-farm systems. \n \nE. \n \n37. \nThe  investment  plan  is  estimated  at  $148  million,  including  taxes  and  duties,  physical \nand  price  contingencies,  interest  charges  during  implementation,  and  commitment  charges. \nCost estimates by project component are summarized in Table 1.

MAWR will be the Executing Agency and have overall responsibility for the Project. An \nMAWR  staff  member  will  be  appointed  project  director  and  oversee  project  implementation. \nMAWR will establish, prior to disbursement of loan proceeds, the PMO in Tashkent to manage \nproject  implementation.  The  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  financial  management;  (ii) \nprocurement  and  recruitment  of  consultants;  (iii)  preparing  the  periodic  reports;  (iv)  screening, \npreparation,  and  implementation  of  subprojects;  (v)  ensuring  compliance  with  ADB  and  the \nGovernment\u2019s  environment  and  social  safeguards\u2019  requirements;  (vi)  M&E;  and  (vii) \ncoordinating with relevant agencies. To support PMO activities in the field and coordinate local \nactivities for implementation of subprojects, prior to disbursement of loan proceeds, PIUs will be \nestablished in the Syrdarya-Sokh BISA in Fergana city and in the Zarafshan BISA in Samarkand \ncity. The Project\u2019s organizational structure is in Appendix 6. \n \nThe PMO will be headed by a project manager appointed by MAWR and acceptable to \n41. \nADB.  The  project  manager  will  report  to  the  project  director.  The  project  manager  will  be \nsupported  by  teams  of  specialists  for  technical,  contracts  and  procurement,  accounting,  M&E, \nwater resources management, and safeguards along with administrative staff. Each PIU will be \nheaded by a deputy project manager to be appointed by MAWR, and supported by accounting \nand  administrative  staff.  The  deputy  project  manager  will  report  to  the  project  manager.  Each \nsubproject  will  have  a  subproject  coordinator  located  in  the  relevant  PIU  to  facilitate \n\n\f \n \n\nimplementation of the subproject, and will report to the deputy project manager. PMO and PIU \nstaff will be recruited by the  Executing Agency using procedures acceptable to ADB. The PMO \nand PIUs will be supported by international and national consultants recruited by the Project. \n \n42.  Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, the Government will establish a project steering \ncommittee  (PSC)  to  be  chaired  by  a  deputy  prime  minister.  The  PSC  will  comprise \nrepresentatives from the cabinet of ministers; MAWR; Ministry of Finance; Ministry of Economy; \nState  Committee  for  Nature  Protection  (SCNP);  and  Ministry  for  Foreign  Economic  Relations, \nInvestments  and  Trade.  The  PSC  will  (i)  guide  policy  and  strategic  direction,  (ii)  review  and \nevaluate project performance, (iii) review audited accounts, (iv) resolve issues affecting project \nimplementation  as  needed,  and  (v)  facilitate  inter-agency  coordination.  The  PSC  will  meet  at \nleast semiannually. \n \n43. \nA financial management assessment was undertaken during the PPTA. It indicated that \nthe  MAWR  has  satisfactory  management  capability  and  systems  for  financial  and  accounting \nmanagement, reporting, auditing, and internal controls (Supplementary Appendix D). \n \n \n \n44. \nSubprojects  financed  subsequent  to  the  Narpay  and  Besharyk  core  subprojects will  be \nscreened  by  the  PMO  and  selected  based  on  agreed  technical,  economic,  social,  and \nenvironmental  criteria.  Subproject  screening  will  (i)  ensure  compliance  with  safeguards,  and \n(ii) provide necessary reconnaissance level studies to confirm remaining criteria. The PMO will \nsubmit  its  subproject  recommendation(s)  to  the  project  director  and  ADB  for  approval  before \nconducting  a  full  feasibility  study.  Final  approval  of  subprojects  for  financing  will  be  from  both \nthe  Government  and  ADB  and  will  be  based  on  the  results  of  the  feasibility  study  and \ncompliance with the selection criteria. Selection criteria and the subproject approval process are \nin Appendix 7. \n \n\nSubproject Selection and Preparation \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Plan \n\n \n45. \nTo  expedite  project  implementation,  the  preparation  works  for  all  subprojects  will  be \nconducted  during  the  initial  2  years  of  project  implementation.  There  will  be  three  batches  of \nsubprojects,  including  the  first  batch  comprising  two  PPTA  core  subprojects\u2014the  Narpay  and \nBesharyk  subprojects.  Subprojects  for  inclusion  in  batches  2  and  3  will  be  identified  by  the \nPMO, and approved by ADB and the PSC during the Project\u2019s initial year. The feasibility studies \nfor  subprojects  in  subsequent  batches  will  be  prepared  by  the  project  consultants  under  the \nPMO\u2019s supervision and will be completed by the end of the third quarter of the second year of \nimplementation. Detailed design work on the two core subprojects will commence immediately \nupon  fielding  of  the  individual  consultants  during  the  second  quarter  of  the  first  year.  Detailed \ndesign  and  preparation  of  tender  documents  for  the  subsequent  batches  will  be  completed  in \nthe first half of the third year. Equipment supply and install contracts and civil works contracts \nfor both Narpay and Besharyk will be awarded near the end of the first year. Works for batch 2 \nsubprojects will be under contract by the end of year 2, and for batch 3 by the middle of year 3. \nSupervision  of  all  construction  contracts  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the  project  consultants \nunder the PMO\u2019s supervision. The detailed implementation schedule is in Appendix 8. \n \nH. \n \n46. \nproject completion date is 31 December 2014 and the loan closing date is 30 June 2015.  \n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  6  years,  starting  in  early  2009.  The  estimated \n\nImplementation Period \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \nI. \n \n47. \nAll ADB-financed procurement of goods, works, and consulting services will follow ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Major contracts will include (i) \nsupply  and  installation  of  pump  and  motors,  and  rehabilitation  of  the  pumping  stations  and \nassociated  infrastructure;  (ii)  civil  works  for  rehabilitation  of  the  inter-farm  canals,  agricultural \ndrains,  and  associated  infrastructure;  and  (iii)  project  management  and  training  support.  Civil \nworks  contracts  costing  more  than  $1  million  and  contracts  for  supply  (and  installation)  of \nequipment  and  materials  valued  at  more  than  $1  million,  will  be  awarded  under  international \ncompetitive  bidding  while  those  valued  at  $1  million  or  less  will  be  awarded  following  national \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB. 22   Equipment  and  materials  packages \nvalued  at  less  than  $100,000  will  be  procured  through  the  shopping  mode.  The  procurement \nplan is in Appendix 9 and will be updated annually to cover the next  18 months. The relevant \nsections  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  will  be  included  in  all  bid \ndocuments issued during implementation of the Project.  \n \nJ. \n \n48. \nThe Project will provide 154 person-months of international consultants and 490 person-\nmonths  of  national  consultants.  Consulting  services  will  include  project  implementation  for \ncomponents  1  and  2  and  support  to  the  PMO  and  PIUs,  including  planning,  design,  and \nconstruction supervision of rehabilitation and upgrading works as well as project management, \nprocurement,  financial  management,  institutional  analysis,  and  M&E\u2014most  of  which  will  be \nprovided  under  a  single  contract  package.23  The  international  and  national  consultants  will  be \nrecruited  in accordance with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended \nfrom  time  to  time)  using  consulting  firms,  full  technical  proposals,  and  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection  with  80:20  weighting.  Supplementary  Appendix  E  provides  the  detailed  terms  of \nreference. \n \n49. \nThe joint venture of IWMI and ICWC SIC will be recruited for WUA training and support \nservices  using  the  single  source  selection  method.  The  joint  venture  has  been  involved  in \nproviding such services to WUAs for the past 5 years under programs financed by SDC. Based \non this continuing experience, IWMI and ICWC SIC have developed an in-depth understanding \nof Uzbekistan\u2019s WUAs and the challenges they face that uniquely qualifies IWMI and ICWC SIC \nto  provide  training  tailored  to  their  specific  requirements.  IWMI  and  SIC  are  currently  carrying \nout  WUA  training  and  other  water  management  activities  in  the  Fergana  Valley  for  SDC,  and \nextending these to the subproject areas to be rehabilitated under the proposed loan is a natural \nextension  of  their  ongoing  activities.  Using  IWMI  and  ICWC  SIC  for  WUA  training  will  help  to \nmake  uniform  and  promote  stronger  institutionalization  of  these  efforts  throughout  the  country \nrather  than  having  a  piecemeal  approach  with  different  contractors.  SDC  initially  contracted \nIWMI  and  ICWC  SIC  through  single  source  selection  because  of  concern  over  the  lack  of \ncapacity  in  the  country  to  perform  these  services.  Since  then,  SDC  has  evaluated  and  found \ntheir  performance  satisfactory  and  engaged  them  for  further  services.  The  estimated  value  of \n\n                                                \n \n22  Local civil works contractors in Uzbekistan have the capacity to carry out such work. \n23 To  expedite  final  design  and  ensure  timely  procurement  associated  with  the  works  for  both  the  Narpay  and \nBesharyk subprojects during the initial 5 months of project implementation, the PMO will recruit about 14 person-\nmonths  of  international  and  14  person-months  of  national  individual  consulting  services,  so  that  this  work  may \nproceed  prior  to  recruitment  and  fielding  of  the  balance  of  the  required  consultants  under  the  main  consulting \ncontract. The  individual  consultants  required  for  this  initial  effort  will  be  recruited  by  the  PMO  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n\n\f \n \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nthe  current  SDC  contract  is  $4  million  and  the  proposed  ADB  contracting  would  be  far  less\u2014\nabout 40% of this amount.24 \n \nK. \n \n50. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  MAWR.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to \naudit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  all  contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project.  \n \n51. \nIn relation to the Project, the Government will ensure the disclosure of all project-related \nprocurement  actions,  including  consulting  services  contracts  and  the  procurement  of  major \nequipment and civil works, in local newspapers and on the internet. Such disclosed information \nwill  include,  among  other  matters,  the  list  of  participating  bidders;  the  winning  bidder;  a \nsummary  of  the  tender  procedures;  the  value  of  the  contract  awarded;  and  the  general  terms \nand  specifications  of  the  goods,  works,  or  services  procured.  The  financial  management \ncapacity  of  the  Executing  Agency  has  been  assessed  as  satisfactory.  The  project  civil  works \nand  equipment  procurement  have  been  packaged  into  a  large  contract  to  attract  reputable \ncontractors and will require ADB\u2019s approval before being awarded. \n \nL. \n \n52.  \nThe proceeds of the ADB loan will be disbursed according to ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  For  consulting  services  and  equipment \nfollowing  international  competitive  bidding  procedures,  loan  funds  will  be  disbursed  through \ndirect  payment.  For  civil  works  following  national  competitive  bidding  procedures  and  small \nexpenditures related to the PMO, reimbursement and imprest fund procedures will be applied. \nAfter  loan  effectiveness,  MAWR  will  open  two  imprest  accounts,  one  for  each  loan  at  a \ncommercial bank in Uzbekistan acceptable to ADB. These imprest accounts will be established \nand  managed  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.  Total  outstanding  advances \nare not to exceed the estimated share of eligible project expenditures to be financed through the \nimprest  account  for  the  next  6  months  or  10%  of  the  loan  amount,  whichever  is  lower.  ADB\u2019s \nstatement  of  expenditures  procedure  will  be  applied  when  reimbursing  eligible  project  outlays \nand  liquidating  and  replenishing  the  imprest  accounts  for  individual  payments  not  exceeding \n$100,000. \n \nM. \n \n53. \nTo  expedite  project  implementation,  advance  action  is  required  for  recruitment  of  both \nthe  individual  consultants  who  will  initiate  the  design  work  and  the  preparation  of  tender \ndocuments  as  well  as  the  main  package  of  consulting  services.

Once cofinancing is confirmed, Asian Development Bank  funds for WUA training will be reallocated to civil \nworks,  and  SDC  will  undertake  recruitment  and  management  of  International  Water  Management  Institute  and \nInterstate Commission for Water Coordination, Scientific Information Center to execute the WUA training portion of \nthe Project. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nAdvance Action \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\ninformed that (i) advance action will cover actions up to, but not including, contract signing; and \n(ii) approval of advance action does not commit ADB to finance the Project. Advance action will \nenable  early  preparation  of  draft  documents  for  contracting  works  and  services  under  the \nNarpay and Besharyk subprojects and accelerate project implementation. \n \nN. \n \n54.  MAWR, through the PMO, will establish financial management and accounting systems \nfor  the  Project  in  accordance  with  the  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Governance  and \nManagement of Investment Projects Financed by the ADB (2002). The PMO will also maintain \nseparate  records  and  accounts  for  goods,  works,  and  services  to  be  financed  out  of  the  loan \nproceeds  following  sound  accounting  principles.  Independent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB  will \naudit  these  accounts  and  records  yearly.  Within  6  months  of  the  close  of  the  financial  year, \ncertified  copies  of  the  audit  report,  together  with  the  auditor\u2019s  opinion,  will  be  submitted  to  the \nGovernment  and  ADB  in  English.  The  audit  reports  will  include  a  management  letter  and  a \nseparate opinion on the use of the imprest accounts and statement of expenditures procedure. \nFor  the  external  audit  of  accounts,  the  loan  proceeds  may  finance  the  services  of  private \nauditors  and  the  translation  of  their  reports  into  English.  The  auditors  are  to  be  recruited  in  a \nmanner acceptable to ADB. \n \n55.  MAWR, through the PMO, will submit quarterly and annual reports to ADB. The reports \nwill indicate progress made, problems encountered, steps taken to remedy the problems, and a \nprogram of activities\u2014along with expected progress during the remainder of the implementation \nperiod.  The  reports  will  incorporate  project  performance  monitoring  data  and  all  relevant \nfinancial data. The reporting system will focus on outcomes, efficiency, and quality; and will be \nconsistent  with  international  and  local  reporting  standards,  as  well  as  with  the  design  and \nmonitoring  framework  (Appendix  2).  MAWR  will  also  provide  other  reports  and  information \nrelating to the Project as ADB may reasonably request. Within 6 months of project completion, \nMAWR  will  submit  a  project  completion  report  to  ADB  that  includes  information  on  project \nimplementation, use of both the ADF and OCR loan proceeds, and accomplishments in relation \nto the Project\u2019s outcome and impact. \n \nO. \n \n56. \nThe  PMO  will  establish  a  project  performance  and  monitoring  system  to  monitor  the \nProject\u2019s  progress  in  achieving  the  planned  outputs,  outcome,  and  impact  within  6  months  of \nloan effectiveness. An M&E unit will be established in the PMO to measure results and report \nfindings  of  the  project  progress  to  the  Government  and  ADB.  A  matrix  of  indicators  will  be \nestablished and baseline data for the agreed indicators will be gathered within 6 months of loan \neffectiveness. The indicator data will be updated every 6 months and reported to stakeholders \nand  the  public.  During  loan  review  missions,  the  indicators  will  be  validated  and  may  be \nmodified to reflect project performance and results more accurately. \n \nP. \n \n57.  MAWR and ADB will jointly conduct periodic reviews to assess (i) physical, institutional, \nand  capacity  development  progress;  (ii)  financial  progress;  (iii)  implementation  arrangements; \nand  (iv)  identify  and  resolve  problems.  The  periodic  reviews  will  initially  be  conducted  on  a \nsemiannual basis. Starting from the second year of the Project\u2019s implementation and if deemed \nappropriate  by  ADB,  the  periodic  review  may  be  conducted  on  an  annual  basis.  A \ncomprehensive midterm review of the Project will be carried out immediately following physical \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nProject Reviews \n\n\f \n \n\ncompletion of the R&U of the Narpay and Besharyk core subprojects and completion of the final \ndesign  for  the  batch  3  subprojects  (expected  to  be  toward  the  end  of  year  3  according  to  the \nimplementation  schedule).  The  midterm  review  will  evaluate  (i)  project  scope,  design,  and \nimplementation arrangements; (ii) progress against agreed indicators, including the design and \nmonitoring  framework;  (iii)  procurement  performance;  (iv)  performance  of  the  consultants;  and \n(v) any other parameter agreed by MAWR and ADB. At the conclusion of the midterm review, \nADB  and  MAWR  may  agree  on  changes  in  both  project  scope  and  implementation \narrangements, as deemed necessary. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nProject Benefits \n\n \nA. \n \n58. \nProject  benefits  include  (i)  reduced  production  losses,  (ii)  increased  energy  efficiency, \n(iii)  improved  water  management,  (iv)  decreased  land  degradation  caused  by  soil  salinity  and \nwaterlogging,  (v)  increased  irrigation  efficiency,  (vi)  enhanced  farm  productivity  through \nincreased yields and cropping intensity, and (vii) increased rural livelihoods. \n \nB. \n \n\nEconomic and Financial Analysis \n\n1. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\nfactor  of  0.85 \n\nis  used  because  of \n\n \n59. \nA  financial  and  economic  analysis  was  carried  out  for  the  two  subprojects  and  an \neconomic analysis was carried for the Project as a whole. For the economic analyses, a shadow \nexchange rate of SUM1,320 to $1.00 was used. Costs are expressed in constant 2008 prices. \nEconomic  values  for  cotton,  wheat,  maize,  and  fertilizer  were  calculated  using  border  parity \nprices.  A  shadow  wage  rate  conversion \nlocal \nunderemployment.  Appendix  10  provides  a  Summary  Financial  and  Economic  Analysis  while \nthe detailed economic and financial information is presented in Supplementary Appendix F, and \nSupplementary Appendix G provides the detailed cost tables. \n \n60. \nEconomic  Benefits.  The  total  R&U  costs  of  the  Narpay  subproject  are  estimated  at \n$13.05  million,  including  contingencies.  The  R&U  of  the  eight  pumps  and  motors  contributes \n78% to the cost while R&U of the irrigation network is estimated to cost only 10% of total cost. \nThe  R&U  costs  for  the  Besharyk  subproject  are  higher,  at  a  cost  of  $24.233  million  with \ncontingencies. Replacement of the pumps, repair of the rising main, and widening of the intake \nchannel  contribute  57%  of  costs  while  expansion  of  the  delivery  system  contributes  20%. \nDrainage needs are much greater in Besharyk and comprise nearly 5% of the R&U costs. \n \nThe  main  project  benefit  is  sustained  and  improved  agricultural  productivity. 25   The \n61. \nbenefits  include  an  increase  in  crop  yield  of  5%,  a  20%  efficiency  improvement  in  pump \noperation,  and  a  10%  improvement  in  water  use  efficiency.  The  Narpay  subproject  economic \ninternal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  is  15.4%.  The  Besharyk  subproject  has  an  EIRR  of  13.4%. \nBesharyk is more sensitive than Narpay, and both are most robust with regard to increases in \nelectricity, O&M, or initial capital costs. Both have some sensitivity to changes in net benefits or \nwheat  and  cotton  prices.  The  analysis  is  based  on  state-mandated  cropping  patterns,  and \nreturns will improve as policies liberalize and farmers can grow more wheat or other crops with \n\n                                                 \n25  Benefits  are  conservative  since  the  without-project  scenario  does  not  assume  complete  failure  of  all  pumps,  and \ntherefore, the analysis does not assess the social costs that would result from complete pump failure and total loss \nof production. \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n2. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\nhigher returns.26 Analysis of the core subprojects has been extended to the Project as a whole, \nincluding improved water management at the basin level, and yields an EIRR of 15.5%. \n \n \n \n62. \nA farm budget analysis was conducted for an average farm of 30 ha. The results indicate \nthat  the  Project  would  increase  incomes  up  to  127%  versus  the  without-project  scenario.  The \nSummary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy is in Appendix 11. \n \nC. \n \n\nEnvironmental and Social Safeguards \n\n1. \n\nEnvironment \n\n \n63. \nThe  Project  falls  under  category  B  for  environment.  Initial  environmental  examinations \n(IEE)  were  prepared  for  each  subproject.  The  Project  is  unlikely  to  cause  any  significant \nenvironmental  impacts  and  will  be  beneficial  because  of  drainage  improvements.  Potential \nimpacts,  mitigation  measures,  and  reporting  requirements  are  presented  in  the  environmental \nmitigation  and  monitoring  plan  (EMP)  prepared  for  each  subproject.  The  EMP  defines \ninstitutional  responsibilities  and  provides  cost  estimates.  The  monitoring  program  under  the \nEMP  of  the  subprojects  includes  provisions  for  regular  sampling  of  the  water  quality  from  the \nirrigation  pump  intakes  and  the  drainage  outlet  from  each  WUA  area.  Individual  designs  for \ninfrastructure R&U are to be submitted to the SCNP for review. These designs should include a \nsite-specific  environmental  mitigation  plan  that  is  based  on  generic  guidelines  provided  in  the \nIEE,  which  sets  out  environmental  safeguards  and  mitigation  measures  to  be  incorporated  in \ntender documentation for design and works contracts. The project site supervisors and the PMO \nwill monitor compliance with these safeguards and mitigation measures, which will be subject to \ninspection  by  the  SCNP.  An  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedure  (EARP)  was \nprepared to provide guidance for preparation of IEEs and EMPs to ensure compliance with ADB \npolicies and Uzbek law. The IEEs, EARP, and summary IEEs are in Supplementary Appendix \nH.  \n \n \n \n64. \nThe Project will involve R&U of existing pump stations, inter-farm irrigation canals, and \ndrainage  systems.  It  is  anticipated  that  all  R&U  works  will  be  within  the  boundaries  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s  right-of-way  for  existing  structures,  canals,  and  drains.  Rehabilitation  activities, \nsuch as replacement of pumps and rehabilitation of canals, will be phased to ensure there is no \ndisruption  to  the  on-farm  irrigation  water  supply.  Civil  works  implementation  will  be  scheduled \nduring the non-vegetation season to minimize the risk of disruption. It is not anticipated that any \nland  acquisition  or  permanent  displacement  will  take  place.  Any  impact  would  be  associated \nwith construction and should be limited in its scope and duration. A resettlement framework with \ncompensation  matrix  has  been  prepared  and  agreed  with  the  Government,  consistent  with \nADB\u2019s policy for sector projects, to address any impact, should it occur. Appendix 12 provides a \nsummary and Supplementary Appendix I provides more detailed resettlement information. \n \n\nInvoluntary Resettlement \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\nIndigenous Peoples \n\n \n65. \nthe project area and no indigenous peoples safeguard issues exist. \n\nBased  on  the  poverty  and  social  assessment,  no  ethnic  minority  issues  are  present  in \n\n                                                 \n26 Crop prices are based on World Bank long-term projections for cotton, wheat, and other commodities. \n\n\f \n \n\n \n\n2. \n\n1. \n\nGender \n\nParticipation \n\nCommunity Participation and Gender \n\n \nD. \n \n \n \n66. \nThe Project has been prepared in consultation with stakeholders including MAWR staff, \ndistrict  agricultural  departments,  WUAs,  pump  operators,  private  farmers,  dekhan  farmers, \nhousehold plots owners, and members of the community within the Narpay and Besharyk core \nsubproject  areas.  Socioeconomic  surveys  were  undertaken  to  inform  potential  beneficiaries \nabout  the  Project,  obtain  baseline  socioeconomic  data,  seek  perceptions  on  project  activities, \nand  identify  indicators  for  M&E.  The  consultation  process  will  continue  with  all  stakeholders \nduring  the  course  of  project  implementation  to  ensure  involvement  of  WUA  members  and \nfarmers in the planning of the R&U works, especially for inter-farm canals and drains. \n \n \n \n67.  More  than  50%  of  the  population  in  Uzbekistan  is  women,  and  64%  of  the  population \nlives  in  rural  areas.  Women\u2019s  share  in  the  economically  active  population  is  48%.  The  Project \nwill not have an adverse impact on women and girls and will be gender-neutral. (Appendix 13 \nand  Supplementary  Appendix  J).  The  project  design  was  developed  to  (i)  include  a  gender \nspecialist  in  the  PMO;  (ii)  set  out  an  information  campaign  that  clearly  identifies  the  role  of \nwomen in the Project; (iii) establish and train monitoring groups; and (iv) disaggregate key input, \noutput, and outcome indicators by gender. \n \nE. \n \n68. \nrisks and assumptions for the Project. \n \n69. \nSustaining  O&M  of  the  R&U  of  irrigation  and  drainage  systems  is  a  key  risk  to \nachievement of the outcome and impact. Government budget allocations will be monitored to \nassure adequate and timely provision of budgetary funds.  \n \n70. \nDelays in the implementation of civil works, caused by slow procurement procedures at \nthe government level, is another risk. To avoid serious delays, especially at the start-up stage, \nadvance action will be undertaken on staff recruitment.  \n \n71. \n \n\nThe  design  and  monitoring  framework  (Appendix  2)  sets  out  a  comprehensive  list  of \n\nOther risks include macroeconomic shocks and commodity price instability. \n\nProject Risks and Sustainability \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances  regarding,  among  others,  accounting,  auditing \n\n72. \nand anticorruption, the Government and MAWR have agreed to the following assurances:  \n\n(i) \n\nThe Government will ensure that throughout the implementation of the Project, \nadequate  budgetary  allocation  of  the  required  counterpart  funds  are  approved \nand released in a timely manner to ensure proper implementation of the Project. \n\n19 \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\nThe Government through MAWR will ensure that timely and adequate funds will \nbe made available for the O&M of all subprojects selected for rehabilitation and \nupgrading based on the O&M plans developed under the Project. \n\nThe Government will ensure that MAWR operates and maintains the subprojects \nselected  for  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  based  on  the  O&M  plans  developed \nunder the Project. \n\nThe  Government  through  MAWR  will  make  all  reports,  drawings,  maps,  and \nhistorical data on soil, water and land use characteristics, and other information \nrelevant  to  project  implementation  available  to  the  PMO  and  PIU  in  a  timely \nmanner. \n\nThe Government through MAWR will ensure that all subprojects will be selected \nand approved based on the subproject selection criteria and approval procedures \nas detailed in Appendix 7 of the RRP and the draft Loan Agreement. \n\nThe  Government  through  MAWR  will  ensure  that  the  contractors  employed \nunder  the  Project  will  (a)  fully  comply  with  applicable  labor  laws,  (b)  provide \nprompt and equal pay to men and women for work of equivalent value, and (c) \nprovide  adequate  safety  and  health  protection  for  both  male  and  female \nworkers.  The  Government  will  further  ensure  no  minors  will  be  employed  in \nproject-related activities. \n\nThe Government will ensure that all project-related activities will be carried out in \naccordance  with  (a)  the  applicable  environmental  laws  and  regulations  of  the \nGovernment,  (b)  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002),  and  (c)  the  IEE.  For  each \nsubproject, the Government will ensure that the IEE, which will include the EMP, \nwill  be  prepared  following  the  EARP.  The  Government  will  further  ensure  that \nadequate  budgetary  provisions  will  be  made \nIEEs, \n(b) implementation  of  mitigation  measures,  (c)  environmental  monitoring  in  the \nEMPs,  and  (d)  institutional  arrangements  for  coordination  and  supervision  as \nidentified in the IEE and the EARP. \n\nfor  (a)  conducting \n\n(viii)  The Government will ensure that prior to the issuance of the bidding documents \nfor  particular  subproject,  ADB  will  have  (a)  reviewed  and  approved  the  initial \nenvironmental  examinations  of  the  subproject  including  the  environmental \nmanagement plan or their revised versions; and (b) received the Government\u2019s \nclearances, approvals or permits for such documents. \n\nThe Government will ensure that all land acquisition and resettlement activities \nunder  the  subprojects  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  (a)  the  land  acquisition \nand  resettlement  framework  agreed  by  the  Government  and  ADB;  (b)  the \nrelevant  laws,  regulations,  and  procedures  of  the  Government;  and  (c)  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995). The Government will make its best effort \nto  ensure  that  the  civil  works  under  the  Project  will  (a)  be  undertaken  on \ngovernment  rights-of-way  so  that  no  persons  will  be  affected  by  involuntary \nresettlement, and (b) not disrupt any agricultural activities. In the event that any \ncivil  works  activities  will  be  conducted  beyond  the  government  rights-of-way, \nwhich \nthe \nGovernment  will  promptly  prepare  a  resettlement  plan  (based  on  the  detailed \ndesigns and) in accordance with (a) ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy, and \n(b) the land acquisition and resettlement framework. \n\nland  acquisition  and/or \n\nresettlement, \n\ninvoluntary \n\nresults \n\nin \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(ix) \n\n \n\n\f \n \n\n \n\n \nB. \n \n73. \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\n(xii) \n\nPrior  to  the  award  of  a  civil  works  contract  that  involves  land  acquisition  or \ninvoluntary resettlement, the Government will have submitted and ADB will have \nreviewed and approved the resettlement plan for the subproject associated with \nthe works contract. \n\nPrior to the issuance of the notice to proceed for any civil works that involve land \nacquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement,  the  Government  will  have  adequately \ncompensated the affected people in accordance with the resettlement plan. \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  gender  action  plan  is  implemented  in  a \ntimely manner over the project period, and that adequate resources are allocated \nfor  this  purpose.

Uzbekistan  had  an  estimated  per  capita  gross  domestic \n1. \nproduct  (GDP)  of  about  $650  in  2006.  GDP  growth  rates  have  increased  from  3.8%\u20134.0% \nduring 2000\u20132003 to an annual average of over 7.0% during 2004\u201320061 and 9.5% in 2007.2 \nAgriculture  growth  has  fluctuated  from  3.1%  in  2000,  to  10.1%  in  2004  to  5.6%  in  2007.  It  is \nexpected to decline to 4%\u20135% over the next 3 years. The share of agriculture in GDP has also \ndeclined  from  30.1%  in  2000  to  24.1%  in  2006  (footnote  1).  Despite  this  relative  decline  in \ngrowth, agriculture remains an important sector in the economy, accounting for 70% of domestic \ntrade, 35%\u201340% of industrial output (about 7.8% of GDP), about 25% of export earnings, and \n33% of national employment. However, while poverty declined from 27.5% in 2001 to 25.8% in \n2005,  poverty  reduction  in  rural  areas  declined  less  than  in  urban  areas.  About  64%  of  the \npopulation lives in rural areas, which are either directly or indirectly reliant on agriculture. Rural \ncommunities  account  for  more  than  70%  of  the  poor  in  Uzbekistan.  This  underscores  the \nimportance of improving rural livelihoods through increased agricultural productivity. \n \n2. \nWater  Resources,  Irrigation,  and  Drainage.  Uzbekistan  is  an  arid  country  and  has \naverage rainfall of 264 millimeters (mm), from a low 97 mm in the northwest to 425 mm in the \nmountainous areas. The country lies fully within the Amu Darya river basin that covers 86.5% of \nthe  land,  and  the  Syr  Darya  river  basin  that  covers  13.5%  of  the  land.  These  rivers  and  their \ntributaries  provide  all  the  water  resources  to  support  irrigated  agriculture.  However,  the  water \nthey  supply  varies  considerably  on  a  seasonal  basis  and  with  regard  to  the  location  in  the \ncountry, with many areas suffering extreme water scarcity. Because of Uzbekistan\u2019s arid climate \nand  the  variability  in  availability  of  water  resources,  almost  all  agriculture  has  always  been \ndependent  on  irrigation.  Irrigation  takes  place  on  90%  of  the  farmed  arable  land  and  is \nresponsible  for  nearly  all  agricultural  production.  It  consumes  85%  of  all  water  resources  and \nrequires about 57 cubic kilometers (km3) annually. Accordingly, development and management \nof irrigation and drainage infrastructure and  improved water management are key government \npriorities. \n \n Uzbekistan  has  4.3  million  hectares  (ha)  of  irrigated  land  (2.35  million  ha  in  the  Amu \n3. \nDarya  river  basin  and  1.95  million  ha  in  the  Syr  Darya  river  basin).  This  is  over  40%  of  all \nirrigation  in  Central  Asia,  and  nearly  double  that  of  Kazakhstan,  which  ranks  next  in  terms  of \nirrigated area. In 1960, Uzbekistan had less than 2.6 million ha, yet by 1990, the Soviet Union \nhad expanded irrigation to its current area. This was mainly for intensive cotton production. The \nrapid development of intensive irrigated agriculture throughout Central Asia during this period is \nlargely responsible for desiccation of the Aral Sea and the associated environmental, social, and \neconomic disaster. However, the massive investment economically transformed many areas in \nUzbekistan  and  improved  the  livelihoods  of  rural  communities  who  are  now  completely \ndependent on the flow of irrigation water. \n \n4. \nTo support this vast irrigated area, Uzbekistan has an extensive network of irrigation and \ndrainage infrastructure divided into two types: (i) inter-farm, and (ii) and on-farm systems. The \ninter-farm system comprises the large intake structures for water irrigation supply, and the main \nand distributary canals that convey water to the farm level outlets as well as the large collector \n\n                                                 \n1   Government  of  Uzbekistan.  2007.  Welfare  Improvement  Strategy  of  Uzbekistan:  Full  Strategy  Paper  for  2008\u2013\n\n2010. Tashkent.  \n\n2   ADB. Forthcoming. Country Operations Business Plan (2009\u20132011): Uzbekistan. Manila. \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n27 \n\ndrains  that  move  drainage  water  from  irrigated  areas.  The  on-farm  system  comprises  the \nsmaller  field  channels  and  associated  structures  that  distribute  the  water  to  farmers\u2019  fields  as \nwell as the smaller drainage systems that take water from the field and lower the water table to \nprevent  the  problems  of  salinization  and  waterlogging  that  occur  in  many  areas.  Irrigation  in \nUzbekistan primarily relies on surface water that is distributed both by gravity and a widespread \nnetwork  of  pumps  of  various  sizes.  In  some  areas,  such  as  the  Fergana  Valley,  all  these \nirrigation  and  drainage  facilities  are  intertwined  in  a  complex  and  interlinked  system. \nUzbekistan\u2019s  irrigation  and  drainage  infrastructure  includes  (i)  30,000  kilometers  (km)  of  main \nand  inter-farm  canals  with  over  33,000  hydraulic  structures;  (ii)  more  than  1,500  pumping \nfacilities,  with  almost  5,000  pumps  that  supply  irrigation  water  to  over  2  million  ha; \n(iii) 175,000 km  of  on-farm  canals  and  conveyance  structures;  (iv)  40,000  km  of  on-farm \nhorizontal  drains  and  4,300  vertical  drains;  (v)  120,000  km  of  drainage  ditches;  and \n(vi) 15,000 km of large drainage collectors. \n \n5. \nAgriculture and Farming Systems. Cotton is the priority crop grown, and Uzbekistan is \nthe world\u2019s sixth largest producer. Cotton received extensive and intensive development under \nthe Soviet Union. Since Uzbekistan\u2019s independence in 1992, wheat self-sufficiency also became \na  strategic  priority  of  the  Government,  and  it  was  first  achieved  in  1997.  Wheat  and  cotton \ncomprise  the  vast  majority  of  agricultural  production,  with  cotton  grown  on  about  41%  of  the \nirrigated area and wheat on 42% of the irrigated area. \n \n6. \nIrrigated farm production is based on three types of farms: (i) shirkat farms, which were \ncreated  from  Soviet  collective  farms;  (ii)  private  farms;  and  (iii)  dekhan  (small  inheritable \nhousehold  plot  [0.15\u20130.35  hectares]  free  from  Government  quotas  for  crop  selection  and \nmarketing)  farms.  The  shirkats  were  formed  during  the  1990s  as  a  reform  of  the  former  state \nfarms, but their operation was still based on collective ownership of the farm assets, and their \nperformance  was  poor.  As  a  remedy,  the  Government  increased  efforts  to  \u201cprivatize\u201d  the \nshirkats by breaking them into smaller parcels and selling them for management and operation \nby individuals. By 2004, 125,000 private farms had been established on over 2.3 million ha, and \ntoday all of the shirkats have been eliminated and converted to private farms.  \n \n7. \nWhile many of the shirkats have been privatized to individuals, is the private farms are \nstill  controlled  by  the  Government,  which  dictates  the  production  and  marketing  of  cotton  and \nwheat. Farmers are subject to quotas to grow large areas of cotton and wheat with subsidized \ncredits  and  inputs.  They  are  also  required  to  sell  50%  of  the  wheat  and  cotton  harvest  to  the \nGovernment  below  world  market  prices.  The  Government  controls  a  significant  portion  of  the \nvalue  chain  for  these  crops.  The  production  quotas  tied  to  cotton  and  wheat  also  require \nintensive  water  use  and  contribute  to  salinization  and  land  degradation.  In  addition,  land  use \ncontracts are often not registered or recognized, so local authorities can evict farmers who do \nnot  meet  production  quotas,  and  the  title  of  the  land  is  not  transferable  to  another  user.  This \nsituation limits  incentives  for  private  productivity  investments  and  limits  credit  availability  since \nfarms  are  not  viable  collateral.  The  wheat  and  cotton  cropping  rotation  does  not  allow  for \nperiodic  fallowing  of  land  or  rotation  with  fodder  or  other  crops  to  replenish  soil  nutrients  and \nabsorb salts. Dekhan farms are generally quite small fringe holdings, and  their  land  rights  are \nclearly  established  to  private  individuals,  which  allow  secure  long-term  possession  and  free \ncropping  patterns.  There  are  about  4  million\u20135  million  of  these  small  dekhan  farms,  and  they \nproduce  nearly  one-fifth  of  the  country\u2019s  grains,  nearly  all  of  the  horticulture,  and  provide \nimportant cash income for farmers. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems, Opportunities, and Lessons \n\nB. \n \n8. \nIrrigation  and  Drainage  Needs.  During  the  time  of  the  former  Soviet  Union,  new \ninfrastructure  was  constructed  and  existing  infrastructure  improved,  but  its  condition  has \ndeteriorated since independence. The state\u2019s share in agricultural investment has declined, from \n27%  in  1991  to  8%  in  2001.  From  1995  to  2002,  government  funding  for  the  water  sector \ndropped from 2.9% to 1.8% of GDP\u2014a 60% decrease. At the same time, resources for capital \ninvestment in the water sector declined from 0.9% to 0.6% of GDP, reducing funds for operation \nand  maintenance  (O&M)  by  a  third.  Currently,  it  is  estimated  that  deferred  capital  and  O&M \nexpenditures are about 40% of the irrigation and drainage asset value. \n \n9. \nThe  irrigation  and  drainage  system  needs  substantial  rehabilitation  and  upgrading \n(R&U), and major irrigation structures are at risk of failure that would cause significant losses in \nagricultural production. The following R&U needs have been identified throughout the country (i) \ntotal  reconstruction  of  32%  of  the  main  and  inter-farm  canals,  and  repair  of  24%  of  them;  (ii) \nrebuilding  of  42%  of  the  on-farm  irrigation  network,  and  repairs  for  17%;  (iii)  replacement  and \nmodernization of the mechanical equipment of 18 of the 42 large-intake structures (about 10\u2013\n300  cubic  meters  per  second  [m3/sec])  and  reconstruction  of  5;  (iv)  16  of  the  27  inspected \nreservoirs are nonfunctional or threatened with sedimentation; (v) 19,000 km of on-farm drains \nneed  de-silting,  and  11,500  km  of  open  and  subsurface  drains  need  reconstruction  or  repair; \nand  (vi)  only  about  50%  of  the  subsurface  horizontal  drainage  systems  are  operational.  To \nrectify this situation will require sustained R&U investment into the system, and new modalities \nfor O&M are required to prevent further deterioration and to ensure that investment returns are \nsustainable following system R&U. \n \n10. \nPumped  irrigation  provides  water  to  about  half  the  irrigated  area  in  Uzbekistan  and \nposes unique challenges. It includes the three massive irrigation pump cascades systems from \nthe Amu Darya River that include the Amu Bukhara, Karshi, and Amu Zhang systems. Together, \nthe  systems  irrigate  over  800,000  ha  of  land,  and  entire  regions  with  numerous  towns  and \nvillages  and  millions  of  people  are  dependent  on  their  continued  operation.  Amu  Zhang  is \ncurrently  being  rehabilitated  through  ADB  support  although  the  other  two  large  cascades  also \nneed  urgent  rehabilitation. 3  Other  smaller  yet  still  substantial  pumped  irrigation  facilities  are \nlocated throughout all the gravity irrigation networks, with schemes in the range of 5,000\u201310,000 \nha  reliant  on  pumps  being  quite  common.  Almost  all  irrigation  and  drainage  pumps  in \nUzbekistan are operating beyond their design life and adequate resources have been lacking for \ntheir  maintenance  since  independence.  Many  pumps  are  starting  to  fail,  and  without \nintervention,  many  more  are  likely  to  fail  soon.  Of  the  76  very  large  pumping  facilities  with \ncapacities greater than 100 m3/sec, 60 require immediate rehabilitation. In addition, 400 of the \n1,000  smaller  pumped  systems,  with  capacities  of  10  m3/sec  or  less  need  immediate \nrehabilitation or replacement. Energy for pumped irrigation accounts for 70% of the annual O&M \nbudget  of  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Water  Resources  (MAWR),  and  consumes  20%  of \nUzbekistan\u2019s electricity. Substantial investment is needed for R&U of the pumped systems since \ntheir failure would eliminate a significant portion of irrigated areas and substantially reduce the \nlivelihoods of rural communities farming in these systems. Opportunities also exist to increase \nthe  efficiency  of  smaller  pumped  extension  systems  through  new  pump  technology,  more \ndemand-responsive operating regimes, and improved irrigation techniques. \n \n\n                                                 \n3   ADB.  2003.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  and \nTechnical  Assistance  Grant  to  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan  for  the  Amu  Zhang  Irrigation  Rehabilitation  Project. \nManila. \n\n\fis  14,000  cubic  meters  (m3)  per  ha,  compared  with               \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n29 \n\nfor \n\nirrigation \n\nThe  state  of  irrigation  and  drainage  infrastructure,  combined  with  current  irrigation  and \n11. \nwater resources management practices, result in generally low agricultural productivity. Average \nwater  withdrawal \n9,000\u201310,000 m3 in countries with similar climates. Irrigation efficiency nationwide is only about \n40%. The result is wasted water, overloaded drainage systems, and worsening land salinization. \nMAWR estimates that more than 20,000 ha of land goes out of production each year because of \nsalinity caused by poor water management and inadequate drainage. The salinity affects cotton \nyields, which decline by 20%\u201330% on slightly salinized land, and up to 80% on highly salinized \nland.  Some  degree  of  salinization  and  waterlogging  affects  47%  of  all  irrigated  land. 4  \nProductivity  in  irrigated  agriculture  dropped  by  15%  in  the  immediate  post-Soviet  era  but  has \nnow recovered slightly. However, yields are still lower than they should be, with an average of \n2.25 tons per ha for cotton and 4.2 tons per ha for wheat. \n \n12. \nTransboundary  Water  Resources  Management.  The total runoff for water resources \ngenerated in Uzbekistan is about 11.5 km3 per year while the total demand for irrigation is about \n57 km3. The rest of the required flow comes from upstream counties in the Amu Darya and Syr \nDarya  rivers.  During  the  time  of  the  former  Soviet  Union,  interstate  allocations  were  centrally \nmanaged to support irrigation in the summer, and upstream countries were supplied with energy \nduring the winter months. In 1992, following the collapse of the Soviet Union and in response to \nthe  Aral  Sea  crisis,  the  Central  Asian  republics 5   established  the  Interstate  Commission  for \nWater  Coordination  (ICWC)  to  oversee  water  allocation.  Although  there  are  no  permanent \nwater-sharing  agreements,  water  allocation  is  decided  twice  a  year  under  the  ICWC  and \nmanaged  by  the  basin  water  management  organizations  for  the  Syr  Darya  and  Amu  Darya \n6\nunder the ICWC.  \n \n13. \nInstitutional  Framework  for  Irrigation  and  Drainage.  The  legal  and  regulatory \nframework for the irrigation and drainage in Uzbekistan is mainly derived from the Law on Water \nand  Water  Use,  1993,  that  addresses  water  rights  and  allocation,  O&M  of  irrigation  and \ndrainage systems, and resolution of water disputes. The Law on Water and Water Use, 1993, \nalso gives MAWR overall responsibility for water resources. Within MAWR, the Directorate for \nWater Management (DWM) is the primary organization responsible\n for the development, O&M, \na\n \n14. \nThe responsibilities of DWM include the following: (i) measure and report water use on \nthe irrigation and drainage system; (ii) analyze forecasts of water supply and demand, work out \nwater balances, and determine water withdrawal limits for river basins and water use within the \nbasin;  (iii)  provide  permits  for  water  use  and  establish  water  allocations;  (iv)  annually  monitor \nthe  ameliorative  condition  of  irrigated  land  and  register  the  ameliorative  categories  of  land \n(degrees  of  salinization);  (v)  propose  measures  to  improve  the  condition  and  operation  of \nirrigation  and  drainage  systems  and  prevent  land  degradation;  (vi)  introduce  innovative \ntechnologies  and  create  long-term  plans  for  increasing  water  productivity;  (vii)  conduct \ninvestment policy; (viii) assess feasibility of developing new irrigation areas and reconstruction \nof existing irrigation systems; (ix) oversee project design, and research and manage civil works \nfor  irrigation  and  drainage  systems;  and\n  (x)  approve  projects  related  to  developing  and \nm\nanaging irrigation and drainage systems. \n \n \n                                                \n4   ADB  is  helping  to  address  this  situation  through  ADB.  2006.

The  territory  of  each  BISA  is  organized  into  main  canal \nadministrations  (MCAs)  and  irrigation  system  administrations  (ISAs).  MCAs  and  ISAs  are \nstructured  according  to  sections  of  the  canal  system  and  the  main  diversion  structures. \nAccording to the charters of BISAs, MCAs, and ISAs, their roles and responsibilities in O&M are \nsimilar, applied at their respective levels of the irrigation and drainage system and include the \nfollowing: (i) compile and implement plans for preventive maintenance and capital development; \n(ii) MCAs reach agreements with ISAs and pump stations for water delivery within the allocation \nlimits set by the BISA; (iii) ISAs conclude and execute agreements for water delivery from MCAs \nand pump stations and to water users\u2019 associations (WUAs); (iv) provide timely water supply to \nfarmers;  (v)  equip  infrastructure  with  water-measuring  devices  and  measure  and  report  water \ndeliveries  and  withdrawals  on  the  system;  (vi)  enforce  the  observance  of  water-related \nlegislation and water withdrawal limits; (vii) enforce water distribution; and (viii) aid in conducting \nthe state water cadastre and making annual estimates of the availability of irrigated land within \nthe  service  area.  Although  the  creation  of  BISAs  was  a  substantial  improvement  for \nmanagement of water resources and irrigation and drainage management practice, and BISAs \nhave a legacy of Soviet engineering expertise, BISAs would benefit from exposure to advanced \nirrigation and water management methods to help them manage water more effectively. \n \n16. \nis \nresponsible  for  the  main  and  inter-farm  pump  stations  but  was  not  a  part  of  the  MAWR \nreorganization to the BISA framework in 2003. At the national level, DPSEC is under MAWR but \nDPSEC has branch offices in each province, directly financed from MAWR\u2014not through BISAs. \nDPSEC  has  its  own  administrative  structure  and  management,  and  in  addition  to  pumps,  it  is \nresponsible  for  providing  communications  to  all  water  management  organizations,  including \nBISAs.  DPSEC  is  also  responsible  for  O&M  of  some  on-farm  pump  stations  because  new \nWUAs cannot afford to keep the pumps running and local authorities often force DPSEC take on \nthe responsibility. \n \n17. \nIn  addition  to  management  of  the  surface  and  pump  irrigation  systems,  MAWR  is \nresponsible  for  O&M  for  drainage.  At  the  province  level,  MAWR  has  a  branch  office  of  the \nDepartment of Land Reclamation, the Hydrogeological Ameliorative Expedition (HAE), which is \ndirectly financed from central Government. HAE is supposed to fall within the BISA framework, \naccording to establishing legislation. However, the BISA has no direct mandate that specifically \nrelates to the responsibilities for groundwater, drainage, and reclamation, so the relationship is \none more of close cooperation than direct control. HAE has its own administrative structure and \nmanagement and is responsible for (i) maintenance and rehabilitation of the main and inter-farm \ndrainage  system  (including  drainage  pumping  stations)  in  each  BISA,  (ii)  assessment  of  the \ncondition of drainage systems, and (iii) monitoring water table levels as well as soil and water \nsalinity levels. Normally, if a WUA wants help from HAE for cleaning or repair of any part of the \non-farm  drainage  network,  the  cost  is  paid  by  the  WUA  to  HAE.  In  2008,  the  Government \napproved $75 million for an amelioration fund from the land tax to improve drainage. Under this \nfund, both the inter-farm and on-farm drainage networks will be rehabilitated using government \nfunds. \n\n                                                 \n7   Decree No. 320, dated 21 June 2003. \n8  BISAs are organized based more on the existing irrigation and drainage system infrastructure rather than strictly on \nthe  natural  watersheds  or  catchments  of  the  country.  However,  this  is  based  on  hydrological  boundaries  and \nrepresents a more logical way to manage irrigation and drainage than the previous system. \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n31 \n\n \n18.  Water  Users\u2019  Associations.  With  the  conversion  of  the  shirkats  to  private  farms,  the \nformer  state-supported  O&M  and  management  of  the  on-farm  irrigation  and  drainage \ninfrastructure  has  been  eliminated,  and  WUAs  have  been  established  in  their  place.  By  law, \nWUAs have responsibility for the on-farm system and are obligated to observe water allocation \nlimits,  maintain  infrastructure,  take  measures  to  reduce  land  salinization,  observe  sustainable \ncrop  rotations,  adopt  water-saving  technologies,  and  endeavor  to  increase  water  productivity. \nWUAs  are  forbidden  to  operate  inter-farm  infrastructure  for  the  purpose  of  increasing  or \ndecreasing  water  supply.  The  experience  with  WUAs  in  Uzbekistan  is  limited  and  variable. \nAlthough they have been established in most cases, there is no institutionalized program within \nMAWR that provides for their training or resources to support their establishment, and they have \ndeveloped under various models. They also lack equipment since much of the equipment that \nwas supposed to be transferred to them from the shirkats was sold off prior to transfer or is not \nfunctional. WUA sizes vary, with some entire districts put under one WUA. Responsibilities also \nvary  depending  on  the  type  and  complexity  of  system  that  has  been  transferred.  Financial \nsustainability is also difficult since WUA membership fees, along with the rate of collection from \nfarmers.  The  WUAs  also  have  limited  options  in  their  ability  to  collect  payment.  The  Swiss \nAgency  for  Development  and  Cooperation  (SDC)  has  provided  training  and  support  for  some \nWUAs. This has significantly improved their performance with regard to water management and \nsystem O&M, and provides experience from which to scale up a broader training effort. WUAs \nplay a vital role in improving the productivity of irrigated agriculture and water management, yet \nthey require greater support to fulfill this mandate more effectively. \n \n19.  Water  Management. Given the importance of irrigation and the reliance of Uzbekistan \non water coming across its borders, effective water management is essential within the country. \nImproving  the  technical  competence  of  the  BISAs,  MCAs,  and  ISAs  can  improve  water  use \nefficiency  and  productivity.  Capacity  building  for  water  management  should  complement  any \ninter-farm  investment  in  infrastructure  to  help  realize  its  full  potential.  The  inter-farm  irrigation \nsystem  would  also  benefit  from  improved  water  monitoring,  measurement,  and  more  effective \nmanagement. Potential exists to improve water use efficiency by upgrading existing structures \nand controls through new operational procedures, automation, and supervisory control and data \nacquisition  systems.  MAWR  has  already  seen  positive  benefits  from  limited  use  of  these \nmeasures in the Fergana Valley and in the Zarafshan river basin under programs by the United \nStates  Agency  for  International  Development  and  SDC.  More  comprehensive  application  of \nthese  technologies,  with  associated  training  for  BISAs,  can  further  improve  water  use \nefficiencies.  \n \n20. \nEfficiency  gains  can  be  achieved  through  better  planning  and  integration  of  ISA  staff \noperating  the  inter-farm  canals  and  structures,  and  WUA  staff  operating  on-farm  canals,  to \noptimize water deliveries. Especially in the pump systems, which have greater flexibility and can \nbe  more  demand-responsive,  better  communication  and coordination  between  WUAs  and  ISA \nstaff  could  yield  substantial  benefits.  As  noted,  on-farm  water  management  is  under  the \nsupervision of the WUAs, which need capacity development for improved water management. \nIn  cases  where  training  has  been  provided  combined  with  measurement  structures  in  the  on-\nfarm canals, savings of 10%\u201320% have been realized along with productivity improvements. All \nlevels of irrigation in Uzbekistan can be made more efficient with improved water management.  \n \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n\nMAJOR EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE AGRICULTURE AND WATER SECTORS \n \nFunding \nSource \nWorld Bank\n\nAmount \n($ million) \n66.0 \n\nProject \nCotton Subsector Improvement \n\nYear \n1995\u20132005 \n\nLocation \nNational \n\nRural Enterprise Support Project (Appraisal) World Bank\n\n36.0 \n\n2001\u20132006 \n\nFive districts \n\nDrainage, Irrigation, and Wetlands \n\nWorld Bank\n\n60.0 \n\n2003\u20132010 \n\nImprovement \n\nThree districts in \nSouth \nKarakalpakstan \n\nIrrigation and Drainage Sector Strategy \n\nWorld Bank\n\n\u2014 \n\n2007\u20132008 \n\nFergana \n\nRural Enterprise Support Project II \n\nWorld Bank\n\n68.0 \n\n2008\u20132020 \n\nNational \n\nAk Altin Agricultural Development \n\n36.0 \n\n2000\u20132006 \n\nAk Altin \n\nThe Grain Productivity Improvement \n\n26.0 \n\n2004\u20132009 \n\nTashkent, \nSamarkand, Jizzak \n\nAmu Zhang Irrigation Rehabilitation \n\n73.0 \n\n2004\u20132009 \n\nSukhandarya \n\nLand Improvement Project \n\n76.18 \n\n2006\u20132012 \n\nThree districts \n\nIrrigated Agriculture and Food Industry \n\n1.6 \n\n1997\u20132001 \n\nNational \n\nDevelopment \n\n \nRegional Agricultural Development \n\nEU \n\n2.4 \n\n1997\u20132001   \n\nSupply of O&M Equipment to the MAWR \n\nPRC \n\n5.1 \n\n2005\u20132006 \n\nADB \n\nADB \n\nADB \n\nADB \n\nEU \n\nIntegrated Water Management \n\nSDC/IWMI \n\n4.8 \n\n2001\u20132008 \n\nRegional Special Initiative Water Program \n\nUSAID \n\n10.0 \n\n2002\u20132005   \n\nNatural Resources Management \n\nUSAID \n\n25.0 \n\n2000\u20132005 \n\nNavoi, Bukhara, \nKashkadarya, and \nother provinces \n\nKyrgyz Republic, \nTajikistan, and \nUzbekistan \n\nKyrgyz Republic, \nTajikistan, and \nUzbekistan (various \nprovinces) \n\nKyrgyz Republic, \nTajikistan, and \nUzbekistan \n\nWater User\u2019s Associations Support \n\nUSAID \n\n25.0 \n\n2004\u20132009 \n\nTotal \n\u2014 = under preparation, No data available. \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank;  EU  =  European  Union;  IWMI  =  International  Water  Management  Institute;  MAWR  = \nMinistry  of  Agriculture  and  Water  Resources;  O&M  =  operation  and  maintenance;  PRC  =  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China; \nSDC = Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation; USAID = United States Agency for International Development. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n515.08 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fDETAILED COST ESTIMATES \nTable A5.1: Detailed Cost Estimates by Expenditure Category \n\n \n\nSubtotal (A) \n\nItem \nInvestment Costsa \n1.

For  pump  schemes,  an \ninvestment level of generally less than $3,000 per hectare (ha) should be considered while the \nper  ha  cost  indicators  for  gravity-fed  schemes  should  be  much  lower,  perhaps  half  of  that  for \npump  schemes. 1   These  financial  criteria  would  be  applied  at  the  time  of  initial  subproject \nscreening.  However,  a  12%  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  is  the  defining  economic \ncriterion that will be confirmed at feasibility level preparation. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nSubprojects  financed  subsequent  to  the  Narpay  and  Besharyk  core  subprojects  under \nthe  Project  will  be  screened  by  the  project  management  office  (PMO)  and  selected  based  on \nagreed  technical,  economic,  social,  agricultural,  and  environmental  criteria  listed  below. \nSubproject screening will (i) ensure compliance with social and environmental safeguards of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  the  Government,  and  (ii)  provide  adequate  necessary \nreconnaissance  level  studies  to  confirm  the  remaining  criteria.  The  PMO  will  submit  its \nsubproject recommendation to the project director and ADB for approval before conducting a full \nfeasibility study. Final approval of subprojects for financing will come from both the Government \nand  ADB,  and  will  be  based  on  the  results  of  the  feasibility  study  and  compliance  with  the \nselection criteria.  \n \nC. \n \nBased on the experience gained in the identification and preparation of the Narpay and \n3. \nBesharyk subprojects, exclusionary selection criteria have been adopted. These can be refined \nas  the  Project  progresses  subject  to  the  agreement  of  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Water \nResources  (MAWR),  Ministry  of  Finance,  and  ADB.  Given  the  uncertain  quality  of  project-\nrelated data available and the difficulties associated with both locating definitive information and \ndefining  precise  development  targets,  the  exclusionary  approach  is  preferable  to  selection \ncriteria  employing  a  ranking  or  weighting  system.  The  subproject  selection  criteria  are  listed \nbelow.  The  first  set  of  criteria  applies  to  all  possible  subprojects,  both  gravity  and  pumped \nsystems.  An  additional  set  of  technical  criteria  specific  to  pump  schemes  was  also  developed \nand follows the first set of criteria. \n \n\nCriteria for Selecting Subprojects \n\n1. \n\nTechnical \n\n4. \nThe subproject must exhibit a current irrigation command area significantly less than that \nenvisaged  at  design  stage  or  a  continuous  decline  in  the  size  of  the  irrigated  area  within  the \ncommand area.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1  The substantial benefits associated  with the pump schemes from avoided future production losses resulting from \npump failure render total benefits associated with rehabilitating and upgrading pump schemes higher than those for \ngravity-supplied schemes. This is commensurate with the greater investment cost. \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n37 \n\nThe subproject with sanctioned supplemental inflows to the irrigation distribution system \n5. \nfrom  the  drains  must  be  projected  to  exhibit  a  neutral  or  better  salt  balance  following  its \nrehabilitation and upgrading. \n \n6. \nincreased agricultural productivity. \n \n\nThe  subproject  must  exhibit  scope  for  improved  overall  irrigation  efficiency  and \n\n2. \n\nAgricultural \n\n7. \nThe  subproject  must  have  bonitet  values  (classification  system  for  land  productivity \npotential)  for  its  entire  command  area  with  an  average  value  above  50,  and  none  of  the  sub-\nareas within the command area will have a value less than 40. \n \n8. \ndiversification to higher-value crops. \n \n\nThe  subproject  must  have  a  command  area  that  exhibits  characteristics  conducive  to \n\n3. \n\nEnvironmental and Social \n\nThe  subproject  must  not  have  a  significant  negative  impact  on  or  cause  irreconcilable \n\n9. \nconflict with established land or water users. \n \n10. \nmitigation treatment cannot be incorporated into the subproject design. \n \n11. \n \n\n4. \n\nFinancial and Economic  \n\nThe subproject must not result in a category A environmental or resettlement category.  \n\nThe  subproject  must  not  have  any  negative  environmental  impact  for  which  affordable \n\nThe subproject must have an EIRR of 12% or more. \n\n12. \n \n13. \nThe subproject must have projected incremental increase in farm income exceeding the \nprojected incremental increase in annual production cost such as, but not limited to, agricultural \ninputs, and irrigation operation and maintenance.  \n \n\n5. \n\nSpecific Technical Criteria for Pump Irrigation Schemes \n\nThe  subproject  must  have  adequate  water  available  at  the  pumping  plant  to  meet  the \n14. \nsubproject\u2019s irrigation water requirements (with the exception of acceptable crop-water deficits) \nat least 4 out of 5 years. \n \nThe  subproject  receiving  supplemental  freshwater  inflow  from  gravity  canals  will  be \n15. \ngiven preference, provided that the monthly volumes of water transferred and an assessment of \nthe reliability of the supply are available. \n \n16. \nhave a total installed capacity of 15 cubic meters per second (m3/sec) or less. \n \n17. \nless than 80% of the design capacity. \n\nThe  subproject  that  requires  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  the  pumping  plants  must \n\nThe  subproject  must  have  its  pumping  plant  discharges  (per  pumping  unit  or  in  total) \n\n \n\n18. \n\nThe subproject must have (static plus dynamic) pumping heads of less than 75 meters.  \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n \n\nIndicative Investment Program \n\n \nD. \n \n19. \nThe  project  investment  approach  endorsed  by  the  Government  and  ADB  is  that \napproximately  75%  of  the  investment  is  to  take  place  in  the  Fergana  Valley  and  25%  in  the \nZarafshan  river  basin.  It  is  anticipated  that  this  will  result  in  one  additional  subproject  being \nimplemented  in  the  Zarafshan  river  basin  and  all  additional  subprojects  (about  3\u20135)  being \nimplemented  in  the  Fergana  Valley.  The  Government  has  provided  an  initial  list  of  priority \nirrigation systems as candidate subprojects to be taken up through the Project. Initial screening \nof  these  projects  will  be  undertaken  as  soon  as  the  PMO  is  established  and  implementation \nconsultants  fielded.  Additional  schemes  for  possible  inclusion  are  being  identified  by  the \nGovernment,  and  it  is  anticipated  that  more  than  an  adequate  number  of  irrigation  schemes \nexhibiting a critical need for rehabilitation and upgrading will meet the criteria. \n \n20. \n \n\nThe initial list of priority irrigation systems identified by the Government is as follows: \n\nRehabilitation of the \u201cKenimex-1\u201d pumping station  \nRehabilitation of the \u201cKasaba\u201d pumping station \nRehabilitation of the \u201cGaloba-1\u201d pumping station \nRehabilitation of the \u201cBulokboshi\u201d pumping station \nRehabilitation of the \u201cAbdusamat-1\u201d pumping station \n\nZarafshan river basin \nZarafshan river basin \nFergana Valley \nFergana Valley \nFergana Valley \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n \n\n \n \n \n\n\fIMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE\n\nTASKS\n\n1st Year\nIII\n\nII\n\nI\n\n2nd Year\n\nIV\n\nI\n\nII\n\nIII\n\nIV\n\nI\n\n3rd Year\nIII\n\nII\n\nIV\n\nI\n\n4th Year\nIII\n\nII\n\nIV\n\nI\n\n5th Year\nIII\n\nII\n\nIV\n\nI\n\n6th Year\nIII\n\nII\n\nIV\n\nI.

This is mainly achieved through the avoidance of a reduction in the area irrigated \nby the subprojects, either through failure of pump station, irrigation and drainage infrastructure, \nor  waterlogging  and  salinization,  and  the  resultant  loss  of  agricultural  production.  The  with-\nproject  situation  also  assumes  savings  in  energy  through  the  installation  of  more  efficient \nelectric motors and pumps, and increased water efficiency through better water management. A \nmodest increase in yield and cropping intensity is also applied. A full description of the financial \nand economic analyses of the Project is in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nMid-2008  prices  were  used  in  the  analysis.  For  traded  commodities  (cotton,  wheat, \nmaize,  and  fertilizer),  economic  prices  were  prepared  based  on  border  parity  using  the  World \nBank\u2019s commodity price forecasts. For cotton and wheat, given the current peak in prices, the \naverage of forecast prices for 2010, 2015, and 2020 has been used. This is more realistic of the \nlong-run  average  price,  and  discounts  the  effect  of  the  current  abnormally  high  price  from  the \neconomic  analysis. 1  Prices  of  non-traded  goods  and  services  (including  fodder,  vegetables, \nfruit,  and  agricultural  inputs)  are  in  mid-2008  prices  based  on  prices  in  the  subproject  areas \ncollected  during  the  feasibility  study  preparation.  Agricultural  labor  is  given  a  shadow  value  of \n0.85 in recognition of the high rates of unemployment and underemployment in Uzbekistan. The \neconomic  cost  of  electricity  is  assumed  to  be  $0.05  per  kWh  (SUM66  per  kWh).  The  current \nfinancial price of electricity is SUM52.5/kWh For the derivation of the economic costs of capital \ninvestment  in  rehabilitation  works  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M),  a  standard \nconversion  factor  of  0.85  was  applied  to  reflect  the  removal  of  taxes  and  duties  and \ninefficiencies  in  the  economy.  No  charge  is  included  for  water,  as  it  is  currently  provided  free \nand farmers are not required to contribute to water costs, except for a very low nominal charge \nto  water  users\u2019  associations  (WUAs). 2   Maintenance  of  on-farm  irrigation  infrastructure  is \ncovered by the WUA charge per hectare (ha), which is assumed to increase by 4 times in the \nfuture. \n \nC. \n \n3. \nThe project benefits will emanate from the three main interventions: (i) the rehabilitation \nand upgrading (R&U) of pump stations to serve their command areas properly; (ii) R&U of the \ninter-farm  irrigation  system  and  associated  rehabilitation  of  drainage;  and  (iii)  improved  water \n                                                \n \n1   Cotton prices are at a 10-year historical high in current prices, with prices in the first 4 months of 2008 over 30% \nhigher than the 2007 average, although they have weakened slightly. The World Bank price commodity predictions \nof  May  2008  show  cotton  prices  in  real  or  constant  prices  over  a  2000  base  year  to  be  at  a  high  of  $1.32  per \nkilogram (kg) for 2008, having increased from $1.20 in 2007, but they are projected to decline to the long run price \nof $1.01 per kg by 2020. International wheat stocks are close to the lowest level relative to consumption since the \n1960s.  A  combination  of  factors  (drought,  increased  demand  on  cropland  to  produce  biofuel  feedstock)  have \ncontributed to wheat prices more than doubling from 2007 rates by early 2008. The World Bank commodity price \nprojections predicted a price of $306 per ton of wheat in 2008 (in constant 2000 prices), to decline progressively to \n$179.9 per ton by 2020. In constant price terms, this is still above the historical prices during the 1980s and 1990s. \n2  Some WUAs charge SUM0.23/m3 for water, which is equivalent to SUM4,600 per ha for a typical consumption of \n\nProject Benefits \n\n20 km3 per ha, or $3.49. This may be included in the WUA fee. \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n \n\nmanagement from the support to the basin irrigation system administrations (BISAs) and WUAs. \nThe  Project  does  not  include  support  for  the  physical  development  of  the  on-farm  irrigation \nsystem, except that provision is made for rehabilitation of the inter-farm and on-farm drainage \nthrough  sediment  removal.  However,  the  benefit  from  the  support  to  the  BISAs  and  WUAs \nprovided by the Project will have a direct impact on water management, irrigation efficiency, and \nfarm  productivity.  Enhanced  on-farm  water  management  is  expected  to  result  from  the \nrehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure as well as better irrigation scheduling and on-farm water \nmanagement.  \n \n4. \nFuture  Without  Project. In the without-project situation, it is assumed that the existing \npump  stations  and  their  irrigation  and  drainage  systems  will  continue  to  deteriorate  with  a \ndecline  in  the  volume  of  water  delivered  to  the  command  area,  especially  during  the  peak \ndemand  period  from  June  to  September.  (The  two  core  subprojects  are  both  pump  irrigation \nschemes, and the majority of the other subprojects is likely to be pump schemes.) The Ministry \nof Agriculture and Water Resources (MAWR) staff indicated the remaining life of the pumps for \nthe Narpay and Besharyk schemes is no more than 5 years. A reduced water supply will lead to \na  reduced  area  planted  and  declining  agricultural  productivity,  with  reduced  yields  and  less \nintensive  cropping.  As  irrigation  becomes  more  unreliable  because  of  more  frequent  pump \nbreakdown,  famers  will  lose  confidence  in  the  system,  reduce  their  investment  in  agricultural \ninputs, pay less attention to good cropping practices, and eventually abandon their land.  \n \n5. \nFuture  With  Project. For pump irrigation schemes, the impact of the Project will be to \nrestore  the  pumps  to  a  capacity  to  satisfy  water  demand  in  the  command  area  fully  and  to \nimprove  energy  efficiency  (around  20%).  Some  savings  in  the  O&M  costs  of  the  pumps  and \nmotors will also occur in the initial years, as the new equipment will not require the same level of \nO&M as is the case now. However, adequate levels of O&M must be provided to ensure that the \nequipment is kept fully functional throughout its design life, and to avoid the situation of deferred \nmaintenance. Agricultural productivity will be restored to the full command area, combined with \nan increase in yields and a modest increase in cropping intensity because of the gains in water \nuse efficiency brought about by the support to water management and the WUAs. The R&U of \nthe irrigation infrastructure will reduce water losses and allow better water management.  \n \nFor  gravity  irrigation  schemes,  the  gains  will  be  from  more  effective  irrigation  and \n6. \ndrainage infrastructure and the associated support to water management and WUAs, as is the \ncase with the pump schemes. \n \nD. \n \n7. \nCrop  Models.  Crop  budgets  for  the  range  of crops  found  in  the  Narpay  and  Besharyk \nsubprojects  were  prepared\u2014including  cotton,  wheat,  maize  silage  and/or  fodder,  vegetables, \nannual forage, and fruit trees representing the current situation; and with the inclusion of some \nmelons and potato for the with-project situation. The predominant crop is cotton, which is grown \non around 50% of the area, followed by wheat at around 30%. Maize, lucerne, vegetables, and \nfruit  are  produced  from  the  remaining  area  to  give  a  current  average  cropping  intensity  of \naround  100%  for  the  irrigated  land.  Private  farms  are  compelled  to  produce  a  quota  of  cotton \nand wheat under the state order system, while dekhan (small inheritable household plot [0.15\u2013\n0.35 hectares] free from Government quotas for crop selection and marketing) farms are free to \nchoose  what  they  grow.  In  the  with-project  situation,  the  cropping  pattern  for  Narpay  and \nBesharyk is not expected to change markedly except for a small increase in the area of lucerne, \nin  recognition  of  its  benefit  as  a  restorative  crop  in  the  cotton\u2013wheat  rotation,  and  increased \nproduction  of  high  value  crops\u2014vegetables,  potatoes,  and  melons.  The  average  cropping \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n49\n\n        \n\n \n \nintensity  is expected  to  increase  to  about  115%  with  an  increase  in  the  second crop  of  maize \nand fodder grown after the winter wheat is harvested. This situation is expected to apply to all \nfuture subprojects. \n \nFarm  Budget  Analysis.  The  objective  of  the  financial  analysis  of  a  typical  farm  is  to \n8. \nshow  the  effect  of  the  Project  on  the  farm  household\u2019s  net  income  and  returns  to  labor  as  an \nindication of financial viability, and to indicate the famer\u2019s incentives to participate in the Project. \nIn  this  respect,  the  farm  budget  financial  analysis  is  not  as  meaningful  as  for  more  typical \nirrigation  R&U  since  the  collapse  of  the  pump  stations  will  lead  to  a  major  reduction  of  the \nirrigated  area,  resulting  in  a  drastic  reduction  in  farm  income  per  farm,  and  inevitably  the \nfinancial  ruin  of  many  farmers.  Moreover,  the  farmers  are  not  currently  required  to  make  any \ncontribution  to  the  Project,  and  as  a  result  of  the  R&U,  they  will  receive  the  benefits  with  no \ncosts. Currently, farmers are not required to contribute to the pumping costs of water or to repay \nany of the investment costs except through the WUA fee.  \n \n9. \nAn  analysis  of  a  typical  farm  budget  for  the  Narpay  subproject,  based  on  an  average \nfarm of 30 ha, has been undertaken to indicate the impact of the Project. Private farms do not \nhave  much  variation  in  their  cropping  patterns  as  they  are  required  by  Government  to  grow  a \ncertain proportion cotton and wheat on their land, typically around 50% cotton and 30% wheat. \nThe model is indicative of the overall Project. Currently, it is estimated that an average size farm \nof 30 ha generates an annual net income of around SUM8 million ($6,060), or around $200 per \nha. In the future without-project situation, this would deteriorate to a net return of only $54 per \nha across the command area. In the with-project situation, the average farm would generate a \nnet  income  of  SUM12.3  million  ($9,300),  a  50%  increase  from  the  current  situation.  The \nincremental  income  per  ha  per  year  as  a  result  of  the  Project  (i.e.,  average  returns  per  ha \nbetween the with- and without-project situations) is estimated at SUM338,000 per ha ($256.02). \nFor the average-sized farm of 30 ha, this represents an increase of over SUM10.00 million, or \n$7,685 per farm\u2014a 127% increase in net farm income.  \n \n10. \nAffordability of O&M. An important element of the financial analysis is the Government \naffordability  in  terms  of  meeting  O&M  costs  of  the  irrigation  and  drainage  infrastructure. \nAlthough  the  Government  has  the  right  to  levy  water  charges  as  a  means  of  generating \nrevenue,  the  only  charge  currently  applied  is  an  all-inclusive  land  tax  that  covers  land  and \nincludes a nominal charge for water use. This tax is related to the bonitet (classification system \nfor  land  productivity  potential)  land  productivity  value,  and  currently  ranges  from  SUM500  to \nSUM70,00 depending on the bonitet value with an average of about SUM55,000 per ha ($40). \nThe land tax has more than doubled in recent years. In 2008, the tax revenue may be as much \nas  $250  million.  It  is  not  clear  how  the  Ministry  of  Finance  utilizes  this  revenue,  however.  In \n2005, the World Bank estimated that MAWR requires about $550 million per year to meet O&M \nrequirements, so even if all the land tax revenue was allocated for MAWR\u2019s O&M needs, there \nwould still be a significant shortfall. For the immediate future, the bulk of funding for O&M and \ncapital investment will be from the state budget, as determined by the requests from the BISAs \nand their subdivisions to MAWR. \n \nIn recent years, budgetary allocations for irrigation and drainage O&M have fallen short \n11. \nof  the  requirements  to  operate,  maintain,  and  develop  irrigation  and  drainage  systems \nsustainably.  For  the  last  3  years,  the  state  budget  allocations  to  MAWR  for  irrigation  and \ndrainage were equivalent to $310 million (2006), $350 million (2007), and $423 million (2008)\u2014\na  shortfall  of  about  30%\u201345%  of  the  estimated  O&M  needs.  About  70%  of  MAWR\u2019s  O&M \nbudget  is  accounted  for  by  electricity  costs  for  pumping,  with  the  allocated  portion  for \nmaintenance  at  around  23%  of  the  budget.  This  large  state  subsidy  to  the  irrigation  and \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n \n\ndrainage  sector  can  be  recognized  as  compensation  for  the  indirect  taxes  applied  to  the \nagricultural  producers  through  the  Government\u2019s  price  and  marketing  policy  for  cotton  and \nwheat. Although the system works, it is inefficient, distorting the efficient allocation of resources, \nand constraining economic incentives in irrigation production. \n \n12. \nThe  Government  needs  to  find  a  more  sustainable  mechanism  for  funding  O&M  and \ncapital  investment.  One  means  to  increase  direct  revenue  to  pay  for  inter-farm  O&M  that  has \nbeen  suggested  would  be  for  the  BISA  subdivisions\u2014the  main  canal  administrations  (MCAs) \nand the irrigation system administrations (ISAs)\u2014to levy service charges on the WUAs for water \ndelivery,  which  in  turn  would  recoup  the  costs  from  their  members.  Reorganization  and \nestablishment of service fees will require a concerted approach to overcoming constraints at all \nlevels  of  the  system  and  the  agricultural  economy,  in  combination  with  capacity  building  and \ntraining. The Government is currently considering imposing water fees to help address required \nO&M resources. \n \nE. \n \n13. \nThe  main  project  benefit  is  sustained  and  increased  agriculture  production  and \nproductivity,  which  would  not  happen  in  the  absence  of  the  subproject  R&U.  Other  benefits \ninclude  a  modest  increase  in  crop  yield  of  5%,  efficiency  gain  of  20%  in  the  operation  of  the \npumps,  and  a  gain  of  10%  in  the  efficiency  of  water  use,  which  results  in  a  lower  volume  of \nwater having to be pumped to satisfy crop water requirements. The most important benefits are \nthose  generated  by  the  Project  through  the  prevention  of  the  reduction  in  irrigation  through \npump failure, and to a lesser extent the saving in electricity consumption through more efficient \npumps and the improvement in water use efficiency through support for water management and \ntraining WUAs. For the Narpay subproject, the volume of water saved through improved water \nuse efficiency is assumed to become available for irrigation elsewhere at an average economic \nreturn  of  SUM300,000  per  ha  ($226),  while  for  Besharyk  the  additional  water  is  assumed  to \nallow an expansion of the irrigated area surrounding the scheme. \n \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n1. \n\nResults of the Economic Assessment and Sensitivity Analysis \n\nNarpay. The subproject is found to be economically viable; the economic internal rate of \n14. \nreturn  (EIRR)  is  15.4%.  At  a  12%  discount  rate,  the  net  present  value  is  SUM3,040  million \n($2.3 million)  and  the  benefit\u2013cost  ratio  is  1.14.  The  EIRR  calculation  was  subjected  to \nsensitivity analysis to test the effects of negative changes in the key parameters that determine \nthe benefits and costs. The sensitivity analysis found that the subproject remains economically \nviable  in  the  face  of  a  20%  increase  in  costs  but  the  EIRR  would  fall  below  12%  with  a  20% \ndecrease  in  net  benefits.  The  switching  value  for  the  subproject  for  increased  R&U  costs  was \ndetermined to be 21.5%, and the switching value for decreased benefits was determined to be \u2013\n12.5%. The subproject is not sensitive to the economic price of electricity, with a switching value \nof  37%  indicating  that  the  price  of  electricity  could  increase  from  $0.05/kWh  to  almost \n$0.07/kWh. The  EIRR  is  not significantly  affected  by  either  a  reduction  in  the  irrigated  area  to \nzero in the without-project situation after 10 years or a 20% increase in the net irrigated area in \nthe future without-project situation. Overall, the subproject is most sensitive to a reduction in the \neconomic price of wheat and cotton. \n\n15. \nBesharyk. The subproject is found to be economically viable; the EIRR is 13.4%. At a \n12% discount rate, the net present value is SUM2,168 million ($1.5 million) and the benefit\u2013cost \nratio is 1.06. The sensitivity analysis found that the Besharyk subproject is sensitive to changes \nin the main parameters. In the face of a 20% increase in costs, the EIRR would fall below 12%. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n51\n\n        \n\n \n \nWith  a  20%  increase  in  O&M  costs,  the  EIRR  reduces  to  12%.  The  switching  value  for  R&U \ncosts  was  determined  to  be  a  10%  increase  in  R&U  costs.  The  switching  value  for  the \ndecreased price of wheat and cotton was determined to be a decrease of 4.5%. The analysis is \nnot sensitive to the economic price of electricity, with a switching value of 27.5% indicating that \nthe  price  of  electricity  could  increase  from  $0.05/kWh  to  $0.064/kWh.  Similarly,  a  reduction  in \nthe  irrigated  area  in  the  three  zones  to  zero  from  the  current  situation  in  the  without-project \nsituation after 10 years did not affect the EIRR significantly.  \n\nOverall  Project  Economic  Analysis.  An  indicative  economic  analysis  for  the  overall \n16. \nProject  has  been  prepared  using  the  Narpay  and  Besharyk  subprojects  as  examples  of  the \nlikely costs and benefits for the three components: R&U of irrigation drainage, water resources \nmanagement,  and  project  management.  The  EIRR  is  15.5%  which  indicates  that  the  overall \nProject is economically viable as it exceeds the opportunity cost of capital of 12%. The results of \na sensitivity analysis show that the Project is robust to a 20% increase in capital costs and O&M \ncosts, and is most sensitive to the level of benefits. A combination of a 20% increase in costs \nand  a  20% reduction  in  net  benefits  reduces  the  EIRR  to  6.1%.  The estimates  of  the  benefits \nmade  possible  by  the  Project  are  considered  to  be  conservative  because  the  economic \nevaluation  not  does  consider  that  the  pump  stations  will  stop  operating  completely  in  the \nwithout-project  situation.  They  are  assumed  to  continue  to  operate  at  about  one  third  of  their \ncurrent  capacity,  supplying  water  for  a  much  reduced  area  but  continuing  to  provide  water  for \ndomestic  use,  to  maintain  livestock  and  water  household  gardens,  which  are  vital  to  the  rural \neconomy. Even with this situation, there is likely to be major social dislocation in the project area \nbecause  of  the  reduction  in  the  irrigated  area  and  loss  of  employment  in  agriculture,  which \nwould  require  some  families  to  relocate  to  other  areas,  with  the  assistance  of  government. \nThese costs have not been quantified in the analysis. \n \n\n2. \n\nBenefit Distribution and Poverty Analysis \n\n \nThe population in the project area has a high dependency on agriculture for employment \n17. \nand sustenance, with little alternative employment. There would be a sharp increase in poverty \nif  agriculture  production  were  to  decline  through  failure  of  the  pump  schemes.  For  most  poor \nhouseholds,  production  from  dekhan  farms  and  households  and  livestock  is  important  for \nsubsistence,  which  would  be  seriously  affected  if  water  supplies  were  to  be  limited.  Poor \nhouseholds  would  benefit \nfrom \nrehabilitation,  and  the  attention  given  to  improved  water  management.  For  the  Narpay \nsubproject,  it  is  estimated  that  the  Project  would  generate  an  additional  142,000  person-days \n(600  person-years)  of  employment  as  a  result  of  the  Project  (mostly  for  harvesting  activities), \nand avoid the without-project loss of a similar number of person-days. Using the Narpay labor \ninvolvement of an additional 16 person-days per ha as a gauge for the whole project, the overall \nProject  is  estimated  to  generate  over  2,500  additional  person-years  of  employment  after \nrehabilitation.  Most  of  the  additional  employment  is  expected  to  accrue  to  rural  agriculture \nworkers and poor households. Therefore, the Project\u2019s impact is likely to be pro-poor.  \n\nincreased  agricultural  productivity  resulting \n\nfrom \n\nthe \n\n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nCountry/Project Title: Uzbekistan: Water Resources Management Sector Project \n\n \nLending/Financing \nModality: \n\nSector Loan  \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n\nCentral and West Asia Department \nAgriculture, Environment and Natural Resources Division  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nLinkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n\nA. \n \nThe Water Resources Management Sector Project will provide funding for the rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage \nschemes  in  the  Fergana  Valley  and  the  Zarafshan  River  Basin.  Six  to  eight  schemes  will  be  rehabilitated  under  the \nProject.  Two  subprojects,  Narpay  in  the  Zarafshan  River  Basin  and  Besharyk  in  the  Fergana  Valley,  have  been \nidentified  and  full  feasibility  studies  completed  under  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA).a  The \nremaining  subprojects  are  to  be  identified  and  analyzed  during  project  implementation.  The  total  area  to  be \nrehabilitated by the Project will be about 60,000 ha and the Project will be implemented over 6 years (2009\u20132015). The \nProject  has  three  components:  (i)  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  irrigation  and  drainage  infrastructure,  (ii)  improved \nwater resources management, and (iii) project management.  \n \nThe  Government  of  Uzbekistan\u2019s  Welfare  Improvement  Strategy  2008\u20132010  commits  to  pursuing  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals relevant to the country. It identifies four pillars for reducing poverty in Uzbekistan: (i) high growth \nrates  by  maintaining  macroeconomic  stability  and  accelerating  structural  reforms,  (ii)  human  development  and  social \nprotection,  (iii)  reduced  interregional  inequalities  in  living  standards,  and  (iv)  improved  environmental  protection.  The \nstrategy emphasizes that further reforms in agriculture and implementation of an agricultural development program are \nthe long-term strategic priorities since they will lead to improvement in incomes for a significant part of the population \nwho live in rural areas and have low-income employment.b   \n\nUnder  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  for  2006\u20132010  in  Uzbekistan,  strategic  priority  1  is  accelerated \nenvironmentally  sustainable  rural  development  with  the  following  long-term  country  outcomes:  (i)  agricultural \nproductivity  and  farm  profitability  improved  in  a  sustainable  manner,  (ii)  rural  non-farm  employment  productivity \nincreased,  and  (iii)  access  to  and  efficiency  of  rural  infrastructure  increased.  The  Project  is  included  under  strategic \npriority 1 of the country strategy and program.c  \n\nIn 2007, 25.8% of the people in Uzbekistan were living below the poverty line with one third of the poor or 2.3 million \npeople classified extremely poor. About 70% of the poor live in rural areas. In 2001, the poverty rate in rural areas was \n30.5%, compared to 22.5% in urban areas. It declined in 2002 to 27.8%, but rose slightly in 2003 to 29%. The overall \npoverty rate dropped to 26.1% in 2004, and 25.8% in 2007.  \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification:   Geographic \n \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nUzbekistan recorded per capita GDP of $814 in 2007. GDP growth rates increased from 3.8% to 4.4% between 2000 \nand  2003,  to  an  annual  average  of  over  7%  during  2004\u20132006  (footnote  b)  and  9.5%  in  2007.d  The  impressive \neconomic growth over the last 5 years has significantly contributed to poverty reduction in Uzbekistan. From 27.5% in \n2001, the poverty incidence fell to 25.8% in 2005. Agriculture growth fluctuated from 3.2% in 2000, to 10.1% in 2004 to \n6.1% in 2007. Agriculture provides one third of national employment. About 64% of the population lives in rural areas \nwhere livelihoods largely depend on this sector. All of the country\u2019s shirkat (collective farm) farms have been parceled \nout  and  leased  on  a  long-term  basis  to  private  farmers,  many  of  whom  have  limited  agricultural  experience.  This \nintroduced  a  fundamental  production  change  from  large  collectively  managed  landholdings  to  much  smaller  plots. \nThese reforms have made significant progress in the agricultural sector but help is needed to improve the tenure status \nof  farmers,  thus  spurring  investment.  Improving  water  management  and  increasing  the  efficiency  and  productivity  of \nwater use are national objectives of Uzbekistan. \n \nThe low living standard of the population in the project area is directly linked to the low level of participation in domestic \nagricultural production and low incomes. The Project is of utmost importance to address the continuously deteriorating \nwater  supply  in  the  project  area,  which  is  the  main  reason  for  the  decreasing  productivity  of  land  and  diminishing \nincomes  of  households.  The  Project  will  have  the  most  significant  positive  impact  on  private  farms,  but  owners  of \ndekhan  (small  inheritable  household  plot  [0.15\u20130.35  hectares]  free  from  Government  quotas  for  crop  selection  and \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n53\n\n        \n\n \n \nmarketing) farms and garden plots will also benefit from the improved supply and management of irrigation water under \nthe  Project,  which  will  prevent  further  loss  of  irrigated  farmland,  allow  potential  increases  in  yields  and  cropping \nintensity, and lead to increased employment and increased farm and nonfarm incomes.  \n\nMost of the surveyed households (both poor and nonpoor) are concentrated near the poverty line. The Project will have \na positive effect on the productivity of farm households, both poor and nonpoor, because of the more reliable supply of \nwater  and  improved  water  management,  both  inter-farm  and  on-farm,  particularly  through  improved  WUAs.  While \nfarmers will still primarily grow wheat and cotton, there will be opportunities for other second crops to be grown, thus \nincreasing overall cropping intensity. In addition, some  households may increase productivity on household plots and \nimprove in-kind consumption and increase opportunities for increased marketing of agricultural products, including fruit, \ngrapes, and vegetables. While there is currently limited marketing of crops other than wheat and cotton, there is scope \nfor increased marketing of other crops  over and above domestic household consumption needs. This applies to both \npoor  and  nonpoor  households.  There  is  also  scope  for  some  increased  employment  for  nonfarm  households  as  the \nirrigation areas are restored to full utilization.  \n\nAdditionally,  potable  water  supply  in  many  areas  depends  substantially  on  irrigation  water,  as  many  households  use \nwater from the irrigation canals for drinking and household needs. However, if the Project is not implemented, access \nof  the  population  to  water  for  domestic  needs,  even  though  not  potable,  will  become  even  more  limited.  Currently, \nsubstantial drainage water is pumped back into canals for further irrigation use. The Project will allow stabilizing water \ndelivery to households; and provide continuous supply for household needs, even at the current relatively low level. To \nthe extent that pumping of drainage water back into the irrigation canals can be reduced, the quality of the water will \nnot continue to deteriorate. \n \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nA  socioeconomic  survey  was  undertaken  in  both  the  Narpay  and  Besharyk  subproject  areas  under  the  PPTA.  The \npopulation in the settlements within the Narpay subproject in Narpay district, Samarkand Province is 13,663 persons or \n2,973  families.  In  the  Besharyk  subproject,  located  in  Fergana  province,  the  population  is  32,333  persons  or  8,673 \nfamilies.  The  average  household  size  for  the  surveyed  households  is  5.32  people  in  Narpay  and  6.0  people  in \nBesharyk. \nAccording  to  the  World  Bank  study,e  based  on  the  household  budget  survey  data  in  the  Northern  Economic  Region, \nwhich includes Samarkand Province, 28.3% of the population was living below the poverty line; in Fergana Province, \nthe figure was 31.8%. In 2005, based on the household budget survey conducted by the State Committee on Statistics \nof the Republic of Uzbekistan, the World Bank identified that the poverty rate was 23.9% in Samarkand Province and \n15.8% in Fergana. At the same time, the average poverty rate for the whole country was 25.8% (footnote b). \nThe  socioeconomic  survey  showed  a  household  poverty  rate  of  30.5%  in  Narpay  subproject  area  and  19.5%  in  the \nBesharyk  subproject  area,  equivalent  to  a  total  of  46,000  people  in  the  two  subproject  areas.  The  poverty  line  in \nmonetary terms is $26.7 per month in the Narpay subproject district and $25.0 per month in the Besharyk subproject \ndistrict. The average monthly household income is $126 for Narpay and $254 in Besharyk. Average family per capita \nincome of the poor is nearly 2 times lower than the income of the nonpoor. \nIncome from hired employment in the nonagricultural sector is the most significant for poor families. The second most \nimportant income sources are social transfers and marketing of own agricultural products. The contribution of pensions \nand social transfers to total income among poor families (including social benefits for low-income households) is 21% in \nNarpay district and 16.3% in Besharyk district.   \n\nThe  share  of  the  unemployed  is  higher  in  poor  families  (37%  more  in  poor  families)  and  more  than  67%  of  the \nunemployed  are  women.  Most  of  the  poor  are  hired  workers,  employed  in  the  agricultural  or  state-budget-funded \nsectors, or self-employed people who cultivate their own small household plots (up to 0.1 ha). \n\n \nThe general level of education of the population in the project area is high (similar to the country in general), but the \nshare  of  adults  in  the  employable  age  and  above,  who  have  vocational  education  (particularly  higher  education)  is \ncomparatively  small,  which  is  typical  for  rural  areas.  Education  indicators  are  a  little  lower  in  poor  families  than  in \nnonpoor families.  \n\nMore than 2.5% of the population has become private farmers, and primarily employs only family members as private \nfarm workers. Self-employment opportunities are limited because of the shortage of resources, underdeveloped market \ninstitutions,  legislative  limitations,  and  lack  of  information  about  ways  and  opportunities  of  increasing  income  in  new \nmarket-oriented conditions.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \n\nBoth  poor  and  nonpoor  families  have  limited  access  to  public  utilities\u2014natural  gas,  electricity,  and  potable  water. \nElectricity  supply  is  relatively  good,  compared  to  other  rural  areas  of  the  country:  98%  of  households  in  Narpay  and \n73%  in  Besharyk  have  electricity,  and  power  cuts  are  rare.  Populated  localities  covered  by  the  survey  do  not  have \ncentralized  hot  water  and  heat  supply  systems.  Poor  gas  supply,  with  frequent  interruptions  and  low  pressure,  is  a \nserious  problem  for  Narpay\u2019s  population;  20%  of  households  do  not  have  access  to  a  centralized  gas  supply,  and \nanother 23% receive natural gas irregularly. \n\nPotable  water  supply  is  a  particularly  serious  problem  for  the  project  areas.  Only  3.2%  of  surveyed  households  in \nNarpay and 6.5% in Besharyk have water piped into the house or in the courtyard. The situation in Besharyk is better \nthan in Narpay, where water is available for only 1\u20132 hours 3 times a week, and the quality of water is unsatisfactory. \n\nOpen reservoirs (mainly the Narpay machine canal) represent the main source of potable water\u2014about 75% of survey \nrespondents  use  this  water,  at  least  from  time  to  time.  Thirty-two  percent  of  the  population  get  water  from  water \nvendors,  13%  use  a  public  water  pipeline,  and  7.5%  use  water  delivered  from  a  water  pumping  station.  Generally, \npeople in the project areas drink and cook with water that falls short of current sanitary standards. Children, who drink \nwater from various sources without any treatment, are particularly vulnerable. \n\nPoor living standards of households within the subproject areas are also due to low productivity in household plots and \nlow incomes from agriculture. The average per capita income of poor households is 1.4 times less than the nonpoor \nhouseholds  and  1.3  times  lower  than  that  of  the  average  households.  The  same  rates  were  observed  in  terms  of \nexpenses. It was also observed that monthly household expenditures are more than the monthly incomes. \n\nConsultation and Participation \n\nB. \n \nThe  consultation  and  participation  process  during  project  preparation  included  key  stakeholders:  MAWR,  district \nagricultural  staff,  WUA  staff,  pump  operators,  private  farmers,  dekhan  farmers,  and  members  of  the  community  who \nlive  and  work  within  the  subproject  areas.  During  implementation  and  monitoring,  consultation  and  participation  will \ninclude information sharing and stakeholder consultation, especially through the developed water WUAs.  \n\nA participation plan was not prepared as there are no significant social safeguard issues.  \n\nJoint  project  disclosure  and  public  consultations  were  carried  out  in  Narpay  and  Besharyk  districts.  A  total  of \n98 stakeholders  attended  the  public  consultations\u201445  in  Narpay  and  53  in  Besharyk\u2014where  women  were  also \nrepresented.  In  both  consultations,  the  participants  were  given  a  project  information  booklet  that  defines  the  Project \nand its likely impacts. Following the presentation, the participants were given the opportunity to provide comments and \nquestions, which were answered and clarified by the PPTA consultants. The participants did not raise any opposition \nagainst  the  subproject  implementation  in  their  districts.  The  proceedings  were  summarized  in  the  minutes  of \nconsultations, with supporting photographs of the proceedings.  \n\nIn  addition,  the  socioeconomic  survey  allowed  a  better  understanding  of  the  preferences  of  residents  of  rural \nsettlements, but also informed them about the project objectives and scope. In addition to surveying, interviews were \nconducted with the chairpersons of all the rural assemblies of citizens and urban villages located within the subproject \nareas. \n \n2.

Key  issues \n \n\nMore  than  26  million  people  live  in  Uzbekistan,  50%  of  which  are  women,  and  64%  of  the  population  lives  in  rural \nareas. The income of women in the Narpay subproject area reflects gender inequalities indicated by the following: (i) \nthe economic activity of women is low, with 44% of women in employable age but only about 30% employed; (ii) 54% \nof  working  women  are  employed  in  the  nonagricultural  sector,  mainly  in  healthcare  and  education;  (iii)  in  the \nnonagricultural sector, women occupy lower-paid positions; (iv) the share of entrepreneurs among women is almost 3 \ntimes  smaller  than  that  of  men;  (v)  women  are  paid  50%\u201380%  of  male  wages;  (vi)  women  have  less  access  to  rural \nfinancial  services;  and  (vii)  women  are  generally  overburdened  with  domestic  work  and  household  responsibilities. \nExisting  gender  stereotypes  set  household  duties  as  a  priority  for  women,  which  do  not  let  them  achieve  full  and \neffective employment. Women\u2019s duties include cooking, laundering, house cleaning, taking care of children and elderly \nfamily members, working on the garden plot, looking after livestock and poultry, and delivering water for drinking and \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n55\n\n        \n\n \n \ndomestic needs. When access to municipal services (gas, fuel, potable water) is limited, domestic work takes up most \nof  women\u2019s  time  and  energy.  According  to  survey  results,  women  and  children  are  responsible  for  fetching  water  in \n76% of households. \n\n2.

The \nLARF  outlines  the  objectives,  policy  principles,  land  acquisition  and  processing  requirements, \ncompensation,  and  other  assistance  measures  for  affected  persons.  The  LARF  will  serve  as \nguide  to  prepare  any  required  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan  (LARP)  for  subprojects \nunder the Project. The document is based on national laws, the country\u2019s 1998 Land Code and \nrelated  resolutions  of  cabinet  ministers  as  well  as  the  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995) \nand related policies of Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n \nB. \n \n2. \nConsistent  with  ADB\u2019s  guidelines,  all  proposed  subprojects  will  be  screened  based  on \nthe  following  categories  of  impacts:  (i)  a  full  LARP  is  required  under  category  A  subproject  if \n200 or  more  people  will  be  physically  displaced  from  housing  or  lose  10%  or  more  of  their \nproductive (income-generating) assets; (ii) a short LARP will be prepared for category B if fewer \nthan  200  people  will  be  physically  displaced  from  housing  or  lose  less  than  10%  of  their \nproductive  (income-generating)  assets;  and  (iii)  no  LARP  is  required  for  category  C  if  the \nsubproject  does  not  require  temporary  or  permanent  land  acquisition  and/or  there  are  no \nresettlement  impacts.  However,  a  due  diligence  report  will  be  prepared  to  indicate  why  the \ncomponent  has  been  categorized  as  C. 1   Procedures  for  the  preparation  of  the  LARP  are \nprescribed  in  the  LARF.  However,  in  accordance  with  selection  criteria  for  the  Project  and \nconsistent with the practice of the State Committee on Land Resources, Geodesy, Cartography \nand State Cadastre (SCLRGCSC), only category B and category C subprojects will be funded \nunder the Project.  \n \nC. \n \n3. \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  Policy \nrequirements  were  compared  to  assess  their  consistency.  To  fill  their  gaps  and  satisfy  ADB\u2019s \npolicy requirements, the following core involuntary resettlement principles were adopted for the \nProject: (i) temporary and permanent acquisition of lands will be minimized to avoid significant \nlosses on farm revenues; (ii) where displacement cannot be avoided, the affected persons will \nbe  provided  assistance  to  at  least  maintain  or  improve  their  pre-subproject  living  standards, \nincome  earning  capacity,  and  production  levels;  (iii)  stakeholders  in  the  subproject  locality  will \nbe  systematically  informed  and  properly  consulted  (a)  to  identify  the  possible  alternative \nsubproject designs to avoid or minimize the adverse impacts of land acquisition; (b) to disclose \nthose  who  are  eligible  to  receive  compensation,  entitlements,  and  the  special  assistance \nmeasures; and (c) for the preparation and disclosures of LARPs to affected persons and others; \n(iv) all affected persons will be properly identified, recorded, and disaggregated by gender in a \ncensus instrument in which the cut-off date for their eligibility is the last day of the survey in the \nsubproject  area,  and  they  will  be  notified  in  advance  when  the  land  for  subprojects  will  be \nacquired;  (v)  lack  of  certificate  of  land  use  right  and/or  certificate  of  permanent  ownership  of \nland  should  not  deprive  the  affected  persons  from  receiving  compensation,  entitlement,  and \nrehabilitation  measures;  (vi)  special  assistance  measures  will  be  incorporated  in  the  LARP \n\nResettlement Framework and Policy \n\nin  Uzbekistan  and  ADB\u2019s \n\nThe  relevant \n\nlaws \n\n                                                 \n1   The  Executing  Agency  has  prepared  two  diligence  reports  that  were  included  in  the  final  report  of  the  project \npreparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  consultants  for  the  ADB.  2008.

Based  on  the  preceding  principles,  the  compensation  and  entitlements  of  affected \npersons are summarized in the entitlement matrix in Table A12.1. \n \n4. \nAll permanently affected lands of the farmers shall be provided with replacement lands. \nOther  affected  properties  will  be  compensated  based  on  replacement  cost.  Eligibility  for \ncompensation  will  be  limited  by  a  cut-off  date  to  be  established  for  each  subproject  on  the \nstarting day of the census and impact assessment. The affected persons who have established \ntheir  structures  within  the  subproject  sites  after  the  cut-off  date  are  not  eligible  for \ncompensation. However, they will be given sufficient advance notice to dismantle the structures \nand  vacate  the  affected  premises  prior  to  project  implementation.  Their  dismantled  structures \nwill not be confiscated, and they will not pay  any fine or sanction. Forced eviction will only be \nused  after  all  avenues  for  amicable  resolution  to  vacate  the  subproject  premises  have  been \nexhausted. Women and vulnerable groups will be given particular attention for assistance in the \npreparation and implementation of LARPs. \n \nD. \n \n5. \nThe  Project  is  designed  for  stakeholders\u2019  participation  during  LARP  preparation. \nProvince,  district,  and  village  officials  will  be  informed  and  their  assistance  will  be  solicited  for \nthe conduct of the inventory of affected assets and the census of affected persons. Prior to the \nfinalization of the LARP, it will be translated into the Uzbek language so that affected persons \nwill  be  thoroughly  informed  and  validate  their  preferences  for  compensation  and/or  other \nresettlement  assistance,  including  their  opinions  on  compensation  rates.  The  meeting  with \naffected persons will be recorded in the minutes of the consultation. The LARF and the LARPs \nwill  be  translated  into  the  Uzbek  language  for  disclosure  to  affected  persons,  and  copies  will \nalso  be  made  available  at  the  concerned  districts  and  villages.  The  English  versions  of  the \nLARF and LARPs will be endorsed by the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources (MAWR) \nto ADB for posting on the ADB website.  \n \n6. \nGrievances  or  complaints  from  affected  persons  will  be  solved  in  a  timely  and \nsatisfactory  manner.  The  project  management  office  (PMO)  for  the  Project  will  mobilize \ngrievance and redress committees (GRCs) whose members will comprise PMO representatives, \nprivate  farmers,  and  owners  of  dekhan  farms  (small  inheritable  household  plot  [0.15\u20130.35 \nhectares] free in crop selection and marketing)  who are not necessarily affected persons, and \nrepresentatives  from  the  group  of  affected  persons  themselves.  Women  will  be  invited  as \nmembers. Any grievance or complaint will be first brought to the attention of the GRC. The GRC \nwill meet to determine the merit of each grievance, and resolve it within 15 days upon receipt of \nthe  complaint.  If  not  satisfied  with  the  GRC  decision,  the  affected  person  can  bring  his  or  her \ncomplaint to the district department of SCLRGCSC, or to its province department, where each \ndepartment is given 15 days to resolve the case. The affected person can file the grievance or \n\nPublic Participation, Documents Disclosure, and Grievance Redress \n\n                                                 \n2  This  can  include  ethnic  minorities,  indigenous  people,  households  headed  by  women  and/or  elderly  people,  and \n\npeople living below the poverty line. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 12        59         \n\nInstitutional Arrangements \n\ncomplaint to the judicial court if he or she is still unsatisfied with the decision of the SCLRGCSC. \nThe  term  of  each  GRC  will  expire  upon  the  satisfactory  completion  of  land  acquisitions  and \npayment of compensation and entitlement to affected persons. \n \nE. \n \n7. \nMAWR  is  the  Executing  Agency.  It  will  establish  the  PMO,  which  will  oversee \nimplementation of the LARF and LARPs. The PMO will be assisted by a (i) national resettlement \nspecialist  to  assist  in  LARP  planning,  preparation  and  implementation,  internal  monitoring  and \nevaluation  (M&E);  (ii)  a  nongovernment  organization  to  provide  on-site  LARP  preparation \nassistance for surveys, information gathering, and consultations with affected persons and the \npublic in general; and (iii) an external monitoring agent to conduct periodic M&E and third-party \nvalidation of LARP implementation activities. \n \n8. \nThe PMO will also solicit the assistance from the government administration of provinces \nand districts and the SCLRGCSC subdivisions at the province and district levels as well as the \nconcerned  parties.  The  concerned  parties  will  be  composed  of  representatives  of  farmers, \nowners  of  dekhan  farms  and  the  neighboring  landowners  and  users,  including  the  affected \npersons.  They  will  serve  as  witness  to  the  marking  of  lands  and  jointly  issue  the  certificate  of \nland  markings  to  PMO.  The  certificate  will  be  included  as  part  of  the  preparation  of  the \ninstruction  on  land  allocation.  Table  A12.2  summarizes  the  phasing  of  the  involvement  of \nconcerned  project  personnel  and  institutions  in  LARP  preparation  and  implementation.  All  the \nconcerned staff of PMO, MAWR, and the local nongovernment organization  involved in LARP \nactivities will undergo an orientation and training on ADB resettlement policy and management. \nThe  orientation  and  training  will  be  conducted  by  the  resettlement  specialist  (technical \nassistance consultant). \n \nF. \n \n9. \nFunds  will  be  provided  for  all  LARPs.  Provisions  will  cover  the  compensation, \nassistance,  other  allowances  to  affected  persons,  implementing  costs,  and  contingency \nallowance  for  unforeseen  expenses  and  for  cushioning  the  effect  of  inflation.  MAWR  will \napprove the budgets and facilitate the release of funds for implementing the LARP. The LARPs \nwill describe the flow of funds including the accounting systems, as these are part of the overall \nproject  development  expenditures  for  which  ADB,  through  the  external  monitoring  agent,  will \nmonitor the disbursements for LARPs. \n \nG. \n \n10. \nInternal  and  external  monitoring  will  be  conducted  during  LARP  implementation.  The \nPMO,  assisted  by  the  local  NGO  and  resettlement  specialist,  will  be  responsible  for  internal \nmonitoring.  Internal  monitoring  will  cover  activities  related  to  (i)  information  campaigns  and \nconsultation  with  affected  persons;  (ii)  status  of  land  acquisition  and  payments  on  land \ncompensation;  (iii)  compensation  for  affected  structures  and  other  assets;  (iv)  relocation  of \naffected persons; (v) payments for loss of incomes; (vi) selection and distribution of replacement \nland areas; and (vii) income restoration activities. Related information will be collected from the \nfield  and  reported  monthly  to  the  PMO  to  assess  the  progress  and  results  of  LARP \nimplementation,  and  to  adjust  the  work  program,  if  necessary.  The  monthly  reports  will  be \nconsolidated every quarter and be a part of quarterly reporting by the PMO to ADB. \n \n11. \nExternal monitoring will be the responsibility of the external monitoring agent that will be \nhired by the PMO at the early stage of LARP implementation. The external monitoring agent will \n\nResettlement Budget and Financing \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n60 \n \n\nconduct  external  monitoring  in  two  phases:  (i)  compliance  monitoring,  and  (ii)  social  impact \nevaluation.  Compliance  monitoring  will  involve  the  assessment  LARP  implementation  that  will \nbe  the  basis  of  MAWR  to  request  a  \u201cno  objection\u201d  from  ADB  for  the  award  of  civil  works \ncontract.  The  social  impact  evaluation  will  cover  the  post-resettlement  situations  of  vulnerable \ngroups like households headed by women, disabled and/or elderly, and families living below the \npoverty  threshold.  The  evaluation  will  also  describe  the  outstanding  future  issues  that  are \nrequired  to  bring  resettlement  into  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy, \ngovernment  policies,  and  further  mitigation  measures  needed  to  meet  the  needs  of  affected \npersons or households perceiving themselves to be worse off as the result of resettlement. It will \ninclude lessons from the evaluation that may be useful in developing future MAWR policies on \nland acquisition and resettlement. The PMO and ADB will prepare the terms of reference for the \nexternal  monitoring  agent  that  will  be  chosen  among  local  consultants  or  nongovernment \norganizations, prior to LARP implementation. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 12        61         \n\nTable A12.1: Entitlement Matrix \n\nType of \nLoss \n\n \n\n1.a  Temporary \nLoss of \nLand \n\nApplication \n\nPrivate farms, \ndekhan farms \n\n1b  Permanent \nLoss of \nLand \n\nPrivate farms, \ndekhan farms \n\n2 \n\nLoss of \nStructure \n\nStructures in dekhan \nfarms or in \nagricultural land \n\nEntitled \nPersons \nOwner(s) of \nprivate farm; \nowner(s) of \ndekhan plot \nOwner(s) of \nprivate farm; \nowner(s) of \ndekhan plot \nOwner(s) of \nprivate farm; \nowner(s) of \ndekhan plots \n\nStructures \nencroaching irrigation \nfacilities \n\nNon-titled \nowners of \nstructures \n\n3 \n\nLoss of \nCrops \n\nSeasonal crops and \nperennial crops \n\n4 \n\nLoss of \nTrees \n\nTrees \n\n5 \n\nSevere \nlosses \n\nAffected persons \nlosing 10% or more \nof the income-\ngenerating assets \n\nOwner(s) of \nprivate farm; \nowner(s) of \ndekhan plots \n\nOwner(s) of \nprivate farm, \nowner(s) of \ndekhan plots, \nhouseholds \nSeverely \naffected \npersons \n\n6 \n\nVulnerable \nhouseholds  \n\nAffected persons \nbelow the poverty  \nline and identified as \nvulnerable through \nthe social impact \nassessment \n\nAll vulnerable \naffected  \nhouseholds  \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nCompensation Entitlements \n\n\u2022 Restoration of land to previous condition, or better \n\u2022 See item no. 3  \n\n\u2022 Replacement land plus cash allowance for the cost \nof clearing and development; free from all taxes, \nregistration and administrative costs \n\n\u2022 See item no. 3 \n\u2022 Compensation will be in cash or in kind with no \n\ndeduction for depreciation \n\n\u2022 Rights to salvage materials from affected structure \n\u2022 Provision of cash allowance for relocation and \n\ntransfer assistance that includes the payment for \ndismantling and reconstruction of structure, based \non the condition in the locality  \n\n\u2022 Rights to salvage materials from affected structure \n\u2022 Provision of cash allowance for relocation and \n\ntransfer assistance that includes the payment for \ndismantling and reconstruction of structure, based \non the condition in the locality \n\u2022 No compensation for structure \n\u2022 For seasonal crops, compensation will be based on \nthe highest market price during the current season \ncalculated on an annual basis \n\n\u2022 For perennial crops, compensation will be based on \nthe average prices for the last 12 months, calculated \non an annual basis \n\n\u2022 Compensation will not be subject to deduction of \n\nincome tax \n\n\u2022 Compensation will be based on the cost of planting \n\nand fertilization of a new tree, and loss of production \nduring the growth period of a new tree \n\n\u2022 Compensation will not be subject to deduction of \n\nincome tax \n\n\u2022 Provision of land to new settlement within the village \nterritory, cash support for land and crop development \n\n\u2022 Provision of cash allowance for relocation and \n\ntransfer assistance that includes the payment for \ndismantling and reconstruction of structure, based \non the condition in the locality \n\n\u2022 Employment of at least one member in the \n\nconstruction work \n\n\u2022 Additional cash or support in kind to help reestablish \n\nand improve livelihoods  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n62 \n \n\n \n\nTable A12.2: Institutional Roles in LAR Preparation and Implementation  \n\nStep \nA.
