I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nequity investment in AIF Capital Asia III, Limited Partnership (the Fund) of up to $30 million or \n15% of the Fund\u2019s total share capital, whichever is less. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nwill not be the single largest investor in the Fund. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: BACKGROUND, CHALLENGES, AND OPPORTUNITES  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \nA.  The Critical Role of Private Equity in Economic Development \n \n2.  In 2004, Asia benefited from strong global growth with gross domestic product (GDP) \nrising an estimated 7.3%. Growth is expected to slow to 6.5% in 2005.1 Over the long term, Asia \nis projected to experience high economic growth supported by favorable demographics and \nincreasing economic, trade, and political and social liberalization. The World Bank projects real \nGDP annual growth during 2006\u20132015 for East Asia and the Pacific at 6.1%, almost double that \nof global growth, which is projected at 3.1%.2\n \n3.  However,  as  Asia  develops  along  this  robust  long-term  growth  trajectory,  it  will \nexperience periods of above- and below-trend growth. During times of below-trend growth, \ntemporary economic dislocation combined with the fickleness of public equity and debt markets \ncreates  attractive  investment  opportunities  for  private  equity.  Further,  ensuring  that  private \nequity financing continues to be made available to entrepreneurial companies is important as \nthis is long-term capital that does not disappear during economic downturns, but is there to \nweather the bad times and reap the financial benefits during the good times. \n \n4.  The environment for private equity investment exits in Asia is continually improving with \nincreased mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and initial public offering (IPO) activity. For the first \nhalf of 2004, private equity divestments reached $3.1 billion, higher than the average full year \ndivestment of $2.7 billion for 2000\u20132003.3  \n \n5.  Asia\u2019s  robust  long-term  growth  prospects  and  strengthening  capital  markets  have \ncreated a positive environment for private equity investing. The supply-demand dynamics of \nAsian  private  equity  remain  favorable.  Economic  growth  and  industrial  transformation  are \ngenerating ample deal flow, yet global private equity allocations to Asia are still low compared \nwith the United States (US) and Europe. \n \n6.  Accordingly, the following features of the Asian private equity industry persist: \n \n(i)  Asian private equity as a whole is under penetrated relative to the rest of \nthe world. Asia accounted for only 18% of the $96 billion of the estimated global \nprivate equity investment in 2004, while Asia, excluding Australia and Japan, \naccounted for less than 10%. Asian private equity investment as a percentage of \n                                                 \n1  International Monetary Fund. 2004. World Economic Outlook. Washington, DC.  \n2  World Bank. 2004. Global Economic Prospects. Washington, DC. \n3  Asia Private Equity Journal. 2004. October. \n ", "2   \nGDP is only 0.2%4 compared to 0.5% in North America and 0.4% in Europe.5 If \nAsia applied the average of US and Europe of 0.45% to its GDP of $10 trillion, \nthen its implied annual private equity investment capacity would be $45 billion \nversus the current level of $17 billion.  \n \n(ii)  The capital overhang (capital remaining for investment) of universal private \nequity accumulated since 1998 is relatively low and declining. In other words, \nAsia has been investing more capital than it has been raising.  \n \n(iii)  Asian midsize deal activity is under penetrated. Much of the recent Asian \nprivate equity fundraising and investing activity has focused on larger buyouts \nand restructurings in Australia and Japan. Of the $11 billion raised for Asia in \n2004,  approximately  70%  was  for  buyout-focused  investing  in  Australia  and \nJapan. Of the $17 billion invested in Asia in 2004, 64% went into buyout deals, \nwhile only 19%, or $3 billion, went into expansion capital investments. \n \n(iv)  Companies with enterprise valuations of under $200 million tend to lack \npublic sources of financing. To achieve a successful IPO, Asian companies \ntypically need to reach an equity valuation upward of $200 million\u2013$500 million. \nDespite improvements in the banking system and debt capital markets, lending \nactivity continues to focus on larger companies. \n \n(v)  Institutionally intermediated M&A activity in Asia tends to focus on large \nsize deals. Less than 8% of the US dollar amount of M&A traced by Bloomberg \nduring 1999\u20132004 was within the deal size range of $10 million\u2013$50 million. The \ndiminished  role  of  financial  intermediaries  for  this  size  creates  a  better \nenvironment for deal sourcing, pricing, and negotiation.  \n \n(vi)  The  environment  for  exits  via  trade  sales  and  IPOs  has  improved \nconsiderably. With regional merger and acquisition IPO activities strengthening, \nprivate equity divestments increased significantly during 2004. Regardless, Asian \nM&A as a percentage of GDP is relatively low at 2% versus the US at 6% and \nEurope at 4%. Such increased activity will create more exit opportunities. \n \n7.  While Asia\u2019s economies continue to grow rapidly, certain market segments must still \nstruggle to gain access to capital. This reality creates very interesting investment opportunities \nas well as justifies a continued role for ADB as an investor in the private equity markets of its \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs). \n \n8.  Asia\u2019s continuing integration into the global supply chain is inevitable as it continues to \nproduce everything from raw materials to high value-added technological goods and services. \nIndeed Asia\u2019s share of trade increased from 14% in 1990 to 21% in 2004. This compares with \nthe  US\u2019s  constant  share  at  13%  and  Western  Europe\u2019s  share,  which  has  increased  only \nmarginally from 36% to 39% despite the formation of the European Union.6 With Asia\u2019s low-cost \nand increasing skilled labor force, its improving infrastructure, and the ongoing liberalization of \n                                                 \n4  This includes Australia and Republic of Korea, where private equity investment rates are much higher than in \nADB\u2019s developing member countries. In the People\u2019s Republic of China and India, private equity investment was \nonly 0.14% and 0.17% of GDP. \n5  PricewaterhouseCoopers. 2004. Global Private Equity 2004. London. \n6  World Trade Organization database, October 2004. \n ", "    3 \ntrade flows, Asia\u2019s continuing global integration is likely to continue to create opportunities to \ninvest in entrepreneurial companies that ultimately contribute to sustainable economic growth, \nimproved living standards, and poverty reduction. \n \nB.  Challenges and Opportunities \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n9.  Although a majority of investors anticipate increasing their exposure over the next 3 \nyears, currently only about a quarter actually invest in emerging markets private equity. The \nmain reasons cited for the current tentativeness focus on a shortage of credible fund managers, \nand lack of a proven track record for emerging markets private equity as an industry. Other key \nreasons include the perception that the risk/return trade-off is better in more developed markets, \nand that liquid quoted equities offer a better or safer exposure to emerging markets.7  \n \n10.  The current dynamics of Asia\u2019s private equity industry, particularly in the middle market \nspace, are creating unique opportunities for a fund manager with regional experience and a \nproven track record of adding value. The Fund aims to capitalize on these dynamics to make \ninvestments in high-potential companies throughout the region. Many midsize companies are \nwell-positioned  to  benefit  from  global  supply  change  integration  and  rising  domestic \nconsumption, but lack of access to equity capital to expand their operations to capitalize on \nthese trends remains a critical problem despite all the publicity being generated in the press with \nrespect to private equity activities in emerging markets. Most of the money is being invested in \nmuch larger deals, whereas the middle market remains underserved or underinvested. \n \n11.  Evaluation  studies  show  that  multilateral  development  banks  can  achieve  a  high \ndevelopment impact in the context of an underserved middle market by fostering investments in \nentrepreneurial companies and by catalyzing the growth of a nascent private equity industry. \nThe European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has played a central role in \nstimulating and catalyzing the private equity industry in Eastern Europe. EBRD, the largest \nprivate  equity  investor  in  central  and  Eastern  Europe,  has  supported  many  private  equity \ncompanies in the region where managers are now setting up their fourth and fifth funds as the \nmarket grows in maturity. Indeed, EBRD\u2019s investments in private equity funds are a successful \nexample of a multilateral development bank acting as a catalyst.8 ADB\u2019s Operations Evaluation \nDepartment did an impact evaluation study of ADB\u2019s investment funds in 2002.9 It concluded \nthat private equity funds achieved \u201cmajor development impacts\u201d in five areas: (i) mobilizing \nsignificant financial resources for infrastructure development, direct investments in industrial \nenterprises, and portfolio investments; (ii) supporting small- and medium-sized enterprises and \nnew entrepreneurs; (iii) supporting technology development; (iv) developing capital markets; \nand (v) generating employment.  \n \n12.  The proposed Fund is an excellent opportunity to institutionalize and formalize private \nequity financing in the middle market, and therefore have a positive influence on the enabling \nenvironment for private sector development. An investment in the Fund will also contribute to \nmobilizing financial resources for industrial enterprises and to developing capital markets for the \nfollowing reasons:  \n \n                                                 \n7  Coller Capital. 2005/06.

Operations Evaluation Department. Manila.  \n ", "4   \n(i)  Proactively creating  opportunities for expansion. The Fund Manager has \nused  its  networks  to  proactively  achieve  expansions  when  it  perceived  an \nentrepreneurial  opportunity.  The  Fund  Manager  is  expected  to  help \nentrepreneurial companies to grow into regional multinational corporations.  \n \n(ii)  Upgrading management practices and oversight. The Fund Manager has an \nimpressive  track  record  in  improving  oversight  and  reporting  standards,  and \ntransferring best management practices to its investee companies. It has, for \nexample,  restructured  its  investee  companies\u2019  boards  of  directors,  appointed \nprofessional  managers,  and  encouraged  sharing  of  knowledge  and  cross-\nlearning among its investee companies. The Fund Manager is expected to help \nimprove the efficiency of the region\u2019s capital markets by improving the oversight \nand transparency of its investee companies.  \n \n(iii)  Establishing  sound  financial  structures  to  support  growth.  The  Fund \nManager  has  supported  the  companies\u2019  expansion  by  introducing  additional \nadded-value  investors.  Not  only  has  the  Fund\u2019s  equity  injection  improved \ninvestee companies\u2019 financial leverage ratio and enabled them to seek additional \nfinance from commercial banks, the Fund Manager has also directly advised \ncompanies  in  risk  management  practices  and  in  ensuring  stable  cash-flow \npatterns, which make them more attractive for lenders.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED FUND \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n13.  The  Fund  will  focus  its  investment  strategy  on  maximizing  medium-term  capital \nappreciation by means of equity or quasi equity instruments invested in private companies in the \nregion. It will target companies benefiting from Asia\u2019s economic growth, with a focus on two key \ntrends: (i) the continuing integration of Asia into the global supply chain, and (ii) rising domestic \ndemand driven by the emerging Asian middle class. \n \n14.  The Fund will broadly pursue the following types of transactions: influential minority \nexpansion capital; expansion financing (to develop an attractive market niche or to strengthen \nthe existing business as a platform to consolidate a fragmented industry through acquisition); \nand acquisition financing. The Fund will make minority investments in proven business models \nwith strong growth potential provided sufficient minority rights can be negotiated. With much of \nthe recent Asian private equity activity focused on larger buyout deals, the Fund Manager \nbelieves many attractive yet overlooked opportunities for expansion capital are available in the \nFund\u2019s target size. In addition, given the Fund\u2019s investment range of $10 million\u2013$50 million, it \nwill target buyouts for companies with enterprise values between $50 million\u2013$200 million. Such \nopportunities  could  include  privately  held  companies  lacking  the  capital  and  managerial \nresources to develop their growth potential, or ignored public companies that can be taken \nprivate and reorganized to extract value or similar unrecognized divisions of larger companies. \nThere will also be special situations for opportunistic distressed investing. Such investments \ncould take many forms including distressed debt converted into equity, acquiring quality assets \nfrom distressed owners, and refinancing strong operating businesses with overleveraged capital \nstructures.  \n \n15.  The Fund aims to invest broadly across Asia with an initial focus on the PRC; Hong \nKong,  China;  India;  Indonesia;  Republic  of  Korea;  Malaysia;  Singapore;  Taipei,China;  and \nThailand given their economic growth potential. ADB\u2019s capital commitment will be invested into \n ", "    5 \nits DMCs provided that a maximum of 15% of ADB\u2019s committed capital may be invested in other \nmember  countries.  The  legal  documentation  will  include  the  necessary  opt-out  clauses  to \nensure that ADB funds are not invested in non-DMCs beyond the limit of 15%.10 The Fund will \nnot be permitted to invest in companies engaged in activities on ADB\u2019s prohibited investment \nlist.11  \n \n16.  The Fund anticipates exits from its investments through a variety of avenues including \nstrategic sale to an operator; sale to other financial investors; an IPO; or a buyback with \ncoinvestors, partners, or the promoters of such portfolio companies. The Fund may reinvest the \ncost part of the exit proceeds in new investments during the investment period in accordance \nwith its investment objectives and relevant legal provisions.  \n \n17.  The Fund will be managed by AIF Capital III GP Ltd (the General Partner), a company \nincorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands. The General Partner will in turn enter into a \nmanagement  agreement  with  AIF  Capital  Asia  Management  Ltd  (the  Manager),  also \nincorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands. The Manager, in turn, will enter into an \ninvestment advisory agreement with AIF Capital Ltd (the Advisor), a company incorporated \nunder the laws of Hong Kong, China.  \n \n18.  The Fund Manager consists of 14 investment professionals, of which 7 have been with \nthe Fund Manager since 1995, while all of the senior members have been with the Fund \nManager since 1998. The team has over 170 years of combined experience in Asian private \nequity, investment, corporate finance, and industry.  \n \n19.   The Fund Manager has consistently used a fundamental, value investing approach to \ncapitalize on opportunities arising from Asia\u2019s economic and industrial transformation in under-\npenetrated segments of the Asian private equity spectrum. The Fund Manager has invested and \nmanaged its portfolios through some of the most tumultuous times in Asia, and has achieved \nstrong returns for its investors. The performance of two other funds managed by the Fund \nManager, Russell AIF Asia II (Fund II) and Asian Infrastructure Fund (Fund I) compare favorably \nwith Asian private equity funds of similar vintages and with Asian public markets over similar \nperiods. The Fund Manager operates out of Hong Kong, China, with an office also in Delhi, \nIndia.  The  Fund  Manager  may  also  open  an  office  in  Shanghai  depending  on  deal  flow \nopportunities in the PRC. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n20.  Following the approval of the proposed investment by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors, ADB \nwill enter into suitable investment documentation for its investment of up to the lesser of $30 \nmillion or 15% of the Fund\u2019s total share capital and will ensure that such documentation and \nother principal agreements relating to the Fund will be on terms and conditions acceptable to \nADB and incorporate all relevant ADB policies. \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n10  The Fund Manager has developed a pipeline of advanced investment transactions: Of all investment transactions \nin the pipeline 50% by investment amount are in the PRC, 17% in India, 23% pan-Asian DMCs, and 11% in non-\nDMC countries. \n11  ADB. 2003.
