While the ultimate aim is to \nimprove  the  quality  of  learning  in  secondary  schools  through \nimproved  teaching  quality,  the  Project  will  pursue  comprehensive \npolicy,  institutional,  and  systemic  developments  required  for \nsustainable development of teacher training. The Project has four \ncomponents:  (i)  improving  teaching  quality  through  organizational \ndevelopment  and  capacity  building,  (ii)  improving  teacher  training \nfacilities, (iii) strengthening in-service and preservice teacher training, \nand  (iv)  increasing  equitable  access  and  improving  community \ninvolvement. The project design includes features that emphasize \ngender and social development as crosscutting dimensions in the \ncomponents, as well as support to teachers in remote areas and from \ndisadvantaged  groups,  including  ethnic  minorities.  The  Project \nincludes a policy and institutional reform framework with timebound \nmilestones and linkages to loan assurances.  \n \nRationale  Secondary education prepares pupils for employment at entry level \nand  serves  as  a  foundation  for  those  who  aspire  for  advanced \nstudies. Moreover, secondary education of good quality is of utmost \nimportance in creating a basis for competitiveness and economic \ndevelopment,  which  are  necessary  for  successfully  tackling  the \nchallenges of globalization. In Bangladesh, steady growth in primary \neducation has resulted in concomitant expansion in the number of \nsecondary  schools,  teachers  and  enrollments.  There  are  18,677 \nsecondary schools recognized by the Government. About 98% of \nthem are private schools. There are over 8.6 million students, of \nwhom about 53% are girls. The gross enrollment ratio in secondary \neducation  averages  about  30%,  marked  by  significant  losses  as \ngrades advance. The total number of teachers is about 240,000. The \ncurrent proportion of female teachers is approximately 17%, against \nthe Government\u2019s policy of having at least 30% female teachers. ", "iv \n  Notwithstanding   the   quantitative  achievements, in  the secondary \neducation system weaknesses are reflected in the declining quality of \ngraduates and teachers. About 60% of teachers are still untrained, \nwhile most schools are devoid of standard conditions essential for the \nnormal instructional process. The extent of wastage in the system is \nreflected in terms of both failure and dropout rates. \n \n  Dropout rates average 44% for secondary grades 6\u201310 and 38% for \nhigher secondary grades 11\u201312. Pass rates for the secondary school \ncertificate (SSC) have been declining in the last 5 years from 55% in \n1999 to 36% in 2003. Pass rates of higher secondary certificate \n(HSC) have been declining from 56% in 1999 to 27% in 2002, with a \nslightly improved 38% in 2003. The failure rates represent a huge \nwastage of financial resources.  Specific investment particularly for \nimproving teaching quality in secondary education is necessary and \njustified to support the Government in achieving the Education-for-All-\nGoals and Millennium Development Goals. \n \nThe decline in the quality of secondary education can largely be \nattributed to poor teaching. Poor and disadvantaged students are \nmost affected since they rarely have other educational options and \ncannot afford the fees charged for additional tuition. While there is \nsignificant improvement in girls' enrollment in secondary education, \ntheir performance and retention are undermined by several factors, \nincluding lack of female teachers in the schools. The standard of \neducation  being  provided  is  inadequate  and  there  is  a  need  to \napproach the problem in a multifaceted manner. The Project seeks to \nimprove teacher training, its planning, management, and quality of \ndelivery through organizational development and capacity building, \nhuman  resources  development,  and  revitalizing  the  existing, \nunderutilized network of teacher training colleges and institutions. The \nProject  will  support  training  of  female  teachers  and  teachers  in \nremote  areas  and  from  disadvantaged  groups,  including  ethnic \nminorities. \n   \nObjectives  The Project aims to  enhance the quality of secondary education in \nBangladesh secondary schools by improving the quality of teaching.  \nThe  purpose  is  to  provide  quality  initial  and  in-service  teacher \ntraining, including continuing professional development, to all eligible \nteachers  of  grades  6\u201310  in  government  and  private  secondary \nschools. \n   \nCost Estimates  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $108.7 million equivalent. \nOf this amount, $37.2 million equivalent, or  34% of the total cost,  \nis the foreign exchange cost, and $71.5 million equivalent, or 66% of \nthe total, is the local currency cost. \n   ", "v \nFinancing Plan  It is proposed that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provides a \nloan of $68.9 million from its Special Funds resources to finance 63% \nof the project costs. The amount covers $29.9 million of the foreign \nexchange cost and $39.1 million equivalent of the local currency cost. \nThe Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) is planning \nto provide joint grant co-financing of $18.0 million, which is 17% of the \ntotal cost. The grant will be administered by ADB and subject to ADB \nguidelines and procedures for procurement of goods and services \nand consultant selection.  \n   ($ million) \nForeign  Local  Total \nSource  Percent \nExchange  Currency  Cost \n         \nAsian Development Bank  29.9  39.1  68.9  63 \nCanadian International         \nDevelopment Agency a  7.3  10.7  18.0         17 \nGovernment of Bangladesh  0  21.7  21.7  20 \nTotal  37.2  71.5  108.7  100 \na Joint grant co-financing is subject to final confirmation from Canadian International     \n  Development Agency. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \nLoan Amount and  It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $68.9 million in various \nTerms  currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights (SDR) 47,000,000 \nfrom its Special Funds resources to finance 63% of the project costs. \nThe term of the proposed loan will be 32 years, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years, with an interest charge of 1% per annum during the \ngrace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 September 2011 \n   \nEstimated Project   \nCompletion Date  31 March 2011 \n   \nExecuting Agency  The Directorate of Secondary and Higher Education (DSHE), under \nthe overall guidance of the Ministry of Education (MOE).  \n   \nImplementation  MOE will establish a project steering committee (PSC) to oversee \nArrangements  project implementation. A project implementation committee (PIC) will \n  be established with representatives from all stakeholder institutions \n  involved  in  implementing  the  Project.  As  and  when  necessary, \ntechnical committees may also be formed. A project management unit \n(PMU) to be established at DSHE will be responsible for the day-to-\nday operational management of project implementation, monitoring \nand evaluation of progress, and liaison with ADB. To ensure close \ncoordination  of  the  project  activities  and  training  programs, \noperational branches of the PMU will be established at the major \nstakeholder institutions of the Project. \n ", "vi \nProcurement  Local procurement through local competitive bidding (LCB) will follow \nthe Government\u2019s new  Public Procurement Regulations 2003,  and \nacceptable to ADB. Vehicles and equipment will be procured through \ninternational competitive bidding (ICB) for packages above $500,000 \nand  international  shopping  (IS)  for  packages  below  $500,000,  \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.  \n   \nConsulting Services  All international and associated domestic consultants will be financed \nfrom the ADB loan and CIDA cofinanced grant funds administered by \nADB, and will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants,  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants.  \n \nProject Benefits and  The Project focuses on systemic improvement in delivery of teacher \nBeneficiaries  training, and its planning, management, and monitoring in secondary \neducation, and thus improvement in teaching quality. The long-term \nbenefits  of  the  investment  will  be  improved  organizational  and \ninstitutional  development,  and  human  resource  development \nstrategies in the teacher training system; and provision of additional \nfinancial  and  other  resources  that  will  ensure  greater  long-term \nsustainability of teacher training, both technically and financially.  \n \nImproved initial and in-service training programs for teachers and \nhead teachers together with improved training materials and facilities \nwill  contribute  to  the  sustainable  development  of  better  quality \nsecondary education. The training programs will ensure greater use \nof classroom practices that are appropriate for teaching and learning \nin secondary education.  The efficiency and benefits of the investment \nare further achieved by prioritizing for training under the Project for \nteachers under the age of 40. Access of female candidates, and \ncandidates from remote areas and disadvantaged groups to teacher \ntraining will be supported. Appropriate gender dimensions, gender \nequality  training,  and  social  development  dimensions  will  be \nincorporated and mainstreamed in the teacher training programs and \nmaterials. The role of women as members of school management \ncommittees (SMCs) as well as the role of SMCs in improving teaching \nquality at grassroots level will be supported.  \n \n  The Project will contribute to poverty reduction indirectly. The indirect \nbeneficiaries are pupils in secondary schools who will benefit from the \nimproved teaching skills of teachers. Improvement in teaching quality \nwill further improve learning by pupils, who will show better education \noutcomes and better performance in the labor market. Overall, the \nestimated immediate beneficiaries of the Project are (i) about 100,000 \nserving untrained teachers who will be trained as teachers, (ii) all \n50,000 new teachers who will benefit from training at teacher training \ncolleges and institutions that use new training methods and delivery \nmodes,  (iii)  all  17,000  head  teachers  who  will  benefit  from  the \nupgraded  head  teacher  training,  (iv)  all\u2014over  200,000\u2014serving \nteachers who will benefit from professional development  programs \nintroduced  by  the  Project,  and  (v)  all\u2014over 700\u2014 teacher trainers  ", "vii \n  who will benefit from professional development designed for them, \nand from upgraded facilities and equipment. Ultimate beneficiaries \nwill be the pupils in grades 6\u201310, estimated at 9.5 million by the end \nof the Project.  \n \nRisks and  The design of the Project draws heavily from lessons from previous \nAssumptions  interventions, and is supported through a comprehensive policy and \ninstitutional reform framework. While the Government is committed to \nthese reforms, there is a risk that a future Government could reverse \nthis commitment. The factor mitigating this risk is the fact that the \nreforms  are  very  much  linked  with  wider  long-term development \nframeworks of Bangladesh in the education sector, and beyond, with \nlinkages to the national poverty reduction strategy and the medium-\nterm macroeconomic framework. \n \nAs a result of administrative changes, operating costs of upgraded \nand rehabilitated training institutions, and a series of education grants \nintroduced by the proposed Project, there are direct cost implications \nfor  teacher  training  in  the  recurrent  budget  after  the  project \ninvestment period. These costs can be sufficiently financed through \nthe proposed increase in the teacher training budget. There are also \nindirect cost implications. Changes in the teacher qualification policy \nduring the project period lead to salary increase from untrained to \ntrained teacher pay scale levels. These increases can be absorbed \nby increments in the secondary education budget between 2005 and \n2011 under the base case scenario, based on ADB and International \nMonetary Fund (IMF) analysis of the economy.  \n   \n By loan effectiveness, the Government  will have approved a policy \nrequiring all new secondary teachers to be trained to a minimum  \n1 year Bachelor of Education (BEd) level and no untrained teachers \nwill be appointed to teacher posts in secondary schools after 2007. \nThe policy will increase demand and motivation of untrained teachers \nfor  training.  However,  other  factors  may  reduce  the  motivation.  \nParticularly opportunity costs of female teachers and teachers from \nremote  areas  or  other  disadvantaged  groups  may  be  too  high.  \nThis risk is mitigated by providing training grants for participants from \nthese groups. Additional support will be provided for female teacher \ntrainees.  \n \nEstablishing  and  building  the  capacity  of  the  Nongovernment \nTeachers  Registration  and  Certification  Agency  (NTRCA),  and \ndeveloping  appropriate  transparent  procedures  in  this  area  are \nexpected to significantly mitigate the risk of abuse and rent-seeking in \nhiring practices in private secondary schools. Recruitment of trained, \nqualified,  and  registered  head  teachers  and  teachers  by  private \nsecondary schools will be linked with the subvention provided by the \nGovernment for these schools. This will further significantly mitigate \nthe risk of abuse and rent-seeking. \n  \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People's Republic of Bangladesh for the Teaching Quality Improvement in Secondary \nEducation Project. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES1 \nA.   Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Secondary education prepares pupils for employment at entry level and serves as a \nfoundation for those who aspire for advanced studies. In Bangladesh, steady growth in primary \neducation over the last three decades has resulted in a concomitant expansion in the number of \nschools,  teachers,  and  enrollments.  Currently  Bangladesh  has  18,677  secondary  schools \nrecognized by the Government. The schools have over 8.6 million students, of whom about \n53% are girls. The gross enrollment ratio in secondary education averages about 30%, marked \nby significant losses as grades advance: i.e., 38% in junior secondary, 25% in secondary, and \n19% in higher secondary education. The total number of teachers in the secondary schools is \nabout 240,000, of whom about 150,000 are untrained. The proportion of female teachers is \napproximately  17%  and  has  been  slowly  increasing  since  the  early  1990s.  The  current \ngovernment policy is that women teachers should eventually make up 30% of all teachers. \n3.  The Ministry of Education (MOE) is responsible for policy and planning for secondary, \nvocational, technical, and higher education in Bangladesh. The Directorate of Secondary and \nHigher  Education  (DSHE)  is  responsible  for  overseeing  the  administration  of  the  18,677 \nsecondary  schools,  2,293  colleges,  and  7,279  postprimary  madrasahs  (religious  schools).  \nFor administrative purposes DSHE has divided the country into nine zones. Districts are headed \nby  district  education  officers.  Given  the  enormous  growth  in  the  number  of  secondary \ninstitutions  in  recent  years,  the  Government\u2019s  administrative  and  supervisory  capacity  is \ninadequate to fulfill its responsibilities.  For quality assurance, DSHE has no effective inspection \nand supervision system and no inspection staff at Upazila (subdistrict) level. Inspection and \nsupervision of teacher training institutions are unsatisfactory and irregular at best.  \n4.  About 98% of secondary schools are private. Each private secondary school is overseen \nby its own school management committee (SMC). However, despite the massive government \nfinancial subvention program that provides 90% of teacher salaries in the private secondary \nschools, performance or accountability requirements are few. Indiscriminate establishment of \nschools and colleges that fail to meet minimum standards contribute to the deterioration of the \nquality of education. ADB\u2019s current loan project2 has assisted the Government in developing \nreform measures to improve the quality, efficiency, and accountability of SMCs.3   \n5.  Notwithstanding the quantitative achievements, weaknesses in the secondary system \nare reflected in the declining quality of graduates and teachers. Challenges have remained. \nAbout 60% of teachers are still untrained, while most schools are devoid of standard conditions \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003.

", "2  \nessential  for  the  normal  instructional  process.  Standard  cohort  analysis  over  the  entire \nsecondary cycle reveals the extent of wastage in the secondary education system in terms of \nboth failure and dropout rates.  Dropout rates average 44% for secondary grades 6\u201310 (49% for \ngirls), and 38% for higher secondary grades 11\u201312 (36% for girls). Pass rates for the secondary \nschool certificate (SSC) have been declining in the last 5 years from 55% in 1999 to 36% in \n2003. Pass rates for the higher secondary certificate (HSC) declined from 56% in 1999 to 27% \nin 2002, but slightly improved to 38% in 2003. These failure rates represent a huge wastage of \nfinancial resources.  \n \n6.  The decline in quality of secondary education can mainly be attributed to poor teaching. \nPoor and disadvantaged students are most affected since they rarely have other educational \noptions and cannot afford the fees charged for additional tuition. While girls' enrollment has \nsignificantly improved, their performance and retention in secondary education are undermined \nby several factors, including lack of female teachers in the schools. The implications are that the \nsecondary education being provided is inadequate and that there is a need to approach the \nproblem in a multifaceted manner. The Project seeks to improve teacher training in secondary \neducation,  its  planning,  management,  and  quality  of  delivery  through  organizational \ndevelopment, capacity building, human resources development, and revitalizing the existing, \nunderutilized network of teacher training colleges and institutions. In addition, the Project will \nsupport the training of female teachers and teachers from remote areas and disadvantaged \ngroups, including ethnic minorities. The project framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n7.  While Bangladesh has  made significant progress in providing access to secondary \neducation to increasing numbers of students, including girls, the quality of teaching, and hence \nstudent learning, continue to be a major concern. As a result, dropout rates are high. Students \nwho manage to complete secondary education are unprepared  to enter the workforce or to \ncontinue  with  their  education.  Assistance  focusing  particularly  on  improving  the  teacher \neducation system and the quality of teaching is necessary. Subsector analysis is in Appendix 2. \nA summary is provided in paras. 8\u201310. Problem and constraints analysis, and government \nactions to overcome them, are in Supplementary Appendix B.  \n \n1.  Quality \n8.  The main constraint to provision of quality secondary education in Bangladesh is the \nacute shortage of trained secondary school teachers; fewer than half of the teachers have had \nany  teacher  training,  and  the  rest  are  poorly  trained.  The  teacher  recruitment  system  is \ninadequate, lacks transparency and has many unfair practices. Teaching as a career is not \nvalued and there are no incentives for rewarding teaching effort and excellence. Consequently, \nteacher  inertia  and  absenteeism  are  widespread.  The  problem  is  exacerbated  by  lack  of \nteaching standards on which to build a quality teacher training system. The curriculum and \ntextbooks are outdated, and the prevailing learning culture and examination system emphasize \nlearning by rote rather than creative thinking and practical work skills. This situation, together \nwith  a  shortage  of  teaching  and  learning  resources,  results  in  poor  teaching  quality  and \nclassroom performance. Students who leave the system are generally unprepared to face \ncompetition in a modern economy and in the global community. \n \n2.  Systemic Problems \n9.  The absence of strategic planning and coordination for teacher training in secondary \neducation in Bangladesh, largely owing to the absence of a functioning authority to discharge ", "    3\nthis important responsibility, has contributed to the unsatisfactory situation. The uncoordinated \noperations of multiple teacher training institutions, with a variety of teacher training programs \nand undefined training standards and competencies for teachers, make it difficult to identify and \nmeasure the quality of teachers during their initial training. The secondary education system has \nweak  organizational  and  supervisory  competence  and  lacks  the  capacity  to  monitor  and \nevaluate performance at all important levels, i.e., administrative, teaching, and student levels. \nDifficulties in evaluating and upgrading teacher performance in schools as a basis for in-service \nand further training arise from a lack of competencies on which to base assessment and \ninspection results. Efforts to improve teaching quality are also hindered by the insufficient \nfunding and budgets of the secondary education system. Unfilled vacancies at all levels of the \nsecondary education system are a major problem. \n \n3.  Access and Equity \n10.  A major issue particularly affecting rural areas and children in other disadvantaged \npopulations is inequitable access and opportunity.  Development partners have been  working \nwith the Government on a number of projects to alleviate the problems of access, particularly for \ngirls, through stipend programs. More  equitable access to teacher training should also be \nsupported  for  female  students  and  students  from  rural  areas  and  disadvantaged  groups, \nincluding ethnic minorities. Gender and social development policies  need strengthening to \ntackle the inequitable gender balance in hiring and assigning female teachers. Little attention \nhas been paid to strengthening gender and social development dimensions and embedding \nthem in teacher training programs and materials. \n \n4.  External Assistance and Lessons Learned  \n11.  One of the main objectives of the operational strategy of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) in education in Bangladesh is to improve educational quality and system efficiency, \nparticularly in teacher training. In the past, ADB assisted the Government to lay the foundations \nfor teacher education in secondary education through several projects, including establishing \nhigher  secondary  teacher  training  institutes  (HSTTIs),4  constructing  secondary  education \nscience  development  centers  (SESDCs),5  and  providing  facilities  and  equipment.6  ADB\u2019s \nsupport  to  Bangladesh  Open  University  (BOU)  has  on  its  part  also  improved  teachers' \nopportunities to further their studies in education.7 Over the years, the focus of ADB loan \nprojects has shifted toward sector policy development and reforms, and systemic improvement \nto  support  the  Government\u2019s  broader  education  reform  agenda.  Accordingly,  the  ongoing \nSecondary  Education  Sector  Improvement  Project  (SESIP)  (footnote  2)  aims  to  improve \nsecondary education through sector reforms, including the development of policies for teacher \neducation, standards, and curriculum.  In addition, specific investment for improving teaching \nquality  in  secondary  education  is  necessary  and  justified  to  support  the  Government  in \nachieving the Education-for-All Goals and Millennium Development Goals. The design of the \nproposed Project builds strongly on lessons from previous ADB-funded projects and other \nexternally  funded  projects.  The  Project  seeks  to  improve  teacher  training,  its  planning, \nmanagement, and quality of delivery through policy and organizational development, capacity \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 1991.

To assist efficiently in \nproviding access to female teachers,  and improve their employment,  useful and successful \ndesign features have been adopted  particularly from the Program to Motivate, Train, and \nEmploy Female Teachers in Rural Secondary Schools (PROMOTE), funded by the European \nCommission.  A  summary  of  external  assistance  and  lessons  learned  is  in  Appendix  3.  \nThe policy and institutional reform matrix for the proposed Project is in Appendix 4.   \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objectives \n12.  The goal of the Project is to enhance the quality of secondary education in Bangladesh \nsecondary schools by improving the quality of teaching.  The purpose is to provide quality initial \nand in-service teacher training, including continuing professional development, to all eligible \nteachers of grades 6\u201310 in Government and private secondary schools. \n  \nB.  Components and Outputs \n13.  The Project has four components: (i) improving teaching quality through organizational \ndevelopment and capacity building, (ii) improving teacher training facilities, (iii) strengthening  \nin-service and preservice teacher training, and (iv) increasing equitable access and improving \ncommunity  involvement.  Implementation  will  encompass  development  activities  at  central \nGovernment level, at all teacher training colleges and institutes, and on pilot basis at community \nlevel.  \n \n1.  Improving  Teaching  Quality  Through  Organizational  Development  and \nCapacity Building \n14.  Establishing  an  Integrated  Secondary  Teacher  Training  System.  A  number  of \norganizations, including teacher training colleges (TTCs), Madrasah Teacher Training Institute \n(MTTI), HSTTIs, SESDC, as well as National Academy of Educational Management (NAEM), \nNational University (NU), and BOU, are currently involved in providing different aspects of \nteacher training in secondary education. However, there is a clear lack of coordination and \ninstitutional linkage between them. To overcome this, the education reform recommendations \ninclude transformation and restructuring NAEM to become the institutional home of excellence \nfor  secondary  education  teacher  training.  NAEM  will  be  responsible  for  managing  and \ncoordinating secondary education teacher training nationwide. In addition, a Nongovernment \nTeachers Registration and Certification Agency (NTRCA) will be established. NTRCA will be  \nresponsible for certifying, registering, and deploying all qualified teachers and head teachers \nworking in secondary education, and accrediting teacher training programs. Under the NAEM, a \nnational integrated secondary teacher training system will be established to link all levels of the \ntraining network from the central administration to the schools, to coordinate and manage \nteacher qualification and training. It will be important to link the process also with monitoring and \nevaluation data and analysis provided by the  Bangladesh Bureau of Educational Information \nand Statistics (BANBEIS) and with functions of DSHE. The Project will assist with reorganizing \nthe structure and functions of the various institutions involved in this proposed training network. \n \n15.  Building the Capacity of National Academy of Educational Management. NAEM will \nbe transformed and restructured to become the institutional home of excellence for secondary \neducation teacher training. NAEM\u2019s role will be broadened to include all aspects of delivery of ", "    5\nsecondary  education  teacher  and  head  teacher  training,  rather  than  just  education \nmanagement. The role of NAEM will be to set and maintain standards for teacher education and \ntraining nationwide. The Project will assist the Government with building the capacity of NAEM \nand implementing its transformation.  \n \n16.  Building the Capacity of Nongovernment Teachers Registration and Certification \nAgency. The Project will support the establishment of NTRCA for secondary education. After \nundertaking an accredited training program and examination, and obtaining an approved initial \nteacher training qualification, a teacher may be registered as qualified after carrying out a \nsuccessful first year of probationary teaching. The performance would be certified by the head \nteacher, and confirmed by other local level education officials. A policy will be approved prior to \nloan  effectiveness  and  implemented  during  the  Project  that  only  trained  and  registered \nsecondary schools teachers will be allowed to teach in secondary schools. All head teachers will \nbe registered on successful completion of their initial head teacher training course and only \nregistered head teachers, with teaching experience, will be appointed as head teachers in \nsecondary schools.  \n \n17.  Strengthening the Capacity of  Directorate of Secondary and Higher Education. \nPart of the Project focus will be on building and strengthening the capacity of DSHE to carry out \nits mandated functions. In coordination with the NTRCA, the Division of Training of DSHE will be \nresponsible for overseeing secondary school teacher education, both pre-service and in-service. \nThe Project will provide the Division with specific support and capacity building to undertake \nthese functions efficiently, as well as support to the Policy and Strategy Planning Unit (PSPU) at \nDSHE, which was established under SESIP initiative.  \n \n18.  Strengthening the Capacity of Bangladesh Bureau of Educational Information and \nStatistics (BANBEIS). The capacity of BANBEIS will be strengthened to ensure improved data \ncollection for teacher training, certification, and registration, and for continuous monitoring and \nevaluation of teacher training, including the development of a geographic information system to \nmap all postprimary institutions. The Project will support BANBEIS to carry out its expanded role \nthrough improved equipment and capacity building, including the capacity to provide data for \nresearch studies focusing on teaching quality and other factors affecting the performance of \nsecondary  schools.  The  capacity  of  BANBEIS  to  assist  MOE  and  other  stakeholders  in \ninterpreting data for policy formulation will be strengthened. \n \n19.  Training Head Teachers and Administrators. The Project will build the capacity for \nand enhance the continuing training and support, provided through NAEM, for head teachers \nand administrators. They will play a key role in improving and maintaining of teaching quality, to \nbe reflected in upgrading the existing courses to include aspects of  innovative teaching and \ngood education practices, and specifically the role of head teachers and administrators in \nencouraging  and  maintaining  good  teaching  practice  through  monitoring  and  professional \nsupport. This role will help institutionalize quality control and assurance. \n \n20.  A policy to be introduced will ensure all new head teachers undergo compulsory initial \ntraining through NAEM, on appointment. On completion of the training they will be registered as \nqualified head teachers. All serving untrained head teachers will undergo the compulsory initial \ntraining at NAEM during the project period and, on completion of the training, will be registered \nas qualified head teachers. All serving head teachers, trained and untrained, will annually \nundergo compulsory in-service professional development training, developed through NAEM, \nand carried out through the proposed network of training institutes.  ", "6  \n2.  Improving Teacher Training Facilities \n21.  Secondary Teacher Training Colleges. Support for upgrading the physical facilities \nand equipment of NAEM, and government secondary TTCs, including MTTI, will be provided. \nSupport will include renovation of classrooms, libraries, laboratories, storage, and provision of \nfurniture and teaching aids, where necessary. Each government TTC, and MTTI will be provided \nwith an audiovisual laboratory and computer laboratory with Internet connection and adequate \nworkstations to meet the needs of staff and students. Facilities of existing teaching resource \ncenters, established in the TTCs with funding from PROMOTE, will be further utilized and \ndeveloped, as necessary, for the professional teacher development.   \n \n22.  In-Service  Teacher  Training  Network.  The  delivery  of  in-service teacher training \nthrough the development of a network of training institutes will be strengthened, based on the \nexisting eleven TTCs, and three additional TTCs being established by the government, MTTI, \nnine  SESDCs  and  five  HSTTIs,  together  with  selected  and  approved  private  TTCs.  \nThe SESDCs and the HSTTIs have remained dormant and underutilized for a number of years. \nThey will be rejuvenated and upgraded as key institutions for the proposed in-service education \nand  training  network,  for  institutionalizing  in-service  training  and  continuous  professional \ndevelopment of teachers. In addition, new resource centers will be constructed and equipped at \nthe three new TTCs, which currently are being built by the Government, as part of the in-service \neducation  and  training  network  to  ensure  full  coverage,  particularly  in  the  remote  and \nunderserved areas. The network of training institutions with upgraded facilities will play a key \nrole in delivering training, both to train untrained teachers and to continue the professional \ndevelopment of teachers and head teachers.  \n \n3.  Strengthening In-Service and Preservice Teacher Training \n23.  Teacher Training Accreditation. Accreditation is a crucial element for controlling the \nquality of the system of teacher training. Building on the current work of SESIP, the Project will \nenhance the quality of teacher education by improving the accreditation criteria and processes, \nenforcing standards, and improving the design of the teacher training syllabus to ensure a \nnationally standardized and accredited Bachelor of Education (BEd) in modular form, as the \nbasic  requisite  qualification  for  teaching  in  a  secondary  school.  The  current  accreditation \nprocedures and monitoring will be reviewed and will be improved, including those for private \nTTCs.  \n \n24.  A modular 1-year BEd syllabus, currently being developed with support from SESIP,  \nwill be further developed  and introduced by the Project as the basic initial qualification for \nuntrained  teachers.  The  modular  BEd  will  be  accredited  by  the  NTRCA,  and  candidates \nsuccessfully passing an examination will be granted the BEd. Delivery of courses for each \nmodule can be carried out by any government or private institution, or by distance mode, but \nwith national public examinations supervised and accredited by the NTRCA, thus allowing the \nintroduction of one national standard for the BEd, irrespective of the mode or standard of the \ndelivering institution. \n \n25.  Preservice Teacher Training for New Teachers. Under a policy to be introduced,  \nall new teachers must be trained to a minimum 1 year BEd level in Government TTCs, MTTI, \nand also in approved private TTCs. MTTI will receive assistance to develop a specialized \nmodule covering religious studies for the standardized BEd course. The annual total target is \nestimated to average 8,300 teacher trainees. The capacity for training new teachers will be \nsufficient  when  the  three  new  TTCs,  which  are  currently  being  built  by  the  Government,  ", "    7\nhave been established. In addition, it is expected that an additional number of newly qualified \nBEd teachers graduating from private TTCs will meet the proposed standards of the NTRCA. \n \n26.  In-Service Initial Teacher Training\u2014Teacher Training Certificate. A major initiative \nwill be to develop and implement a new in-service teacher training program to train untrained \nteachers currently serving in schools. Training will be carried out in a phased manner in a two-\nstage  system.  A  basic  in-service  training  course  at  certificate  level  will  be  designed  and \nprovided for all untrained teachers as a component of the proposed modular 1-year BEd course.  \nThe certificate course will concentrate on the practical aspects of classroom teaching and will \nprovide exemption from the specified parts of the BEd contained in the module. The activities at \nthe colleges and training institutions will be supported through provision of training coordinators \nat the resource centers of the institutions. The coordinators may be engaged from the critical \nmass of teacher educators that have been trained with funding from SESIP and resource center \ncoordinators who have been trained under PROMOTE. The coordinators will work under the \noverall coordination of NAEM. The teacher training certificate module will be delivered through \nthe proposed network of training institutes. A  percentage (35%) of the existing BEd increment \n(i.e., enhancement of salary subvention) will be awarded on completion of the training and \nsuccessful teachers will be registered as \u201cqualified.\u201d \n \n27.  Currently there are an estimated 150,000 untrained teachers in secondary schools and \nthe  limited  time  and  resources  available  make  it  impossible  to  train  all  of  them  within  a \nreasonable time scale. Therefore, all serving untrained teachers under the age of 40 years will \nundergo compulsory certificate training, giving an estimated overall target of about 100,000 \nserving certificate trained teachers, including madrasah teachers, during the project period. \nDuring this period, or soon after, many of the older untrained teachers will retire, and with \ncompulsory training on entry it is anticipated that the entire secondary teacher workforce will \ngradually move toward qualification to a minimum level over a period approximately 10 years, \nand eventually to an entirely BEd standard secondary teacher workforce. \n \n28.  The certificate trained teachers will be encouraged to voluntarily enroll and complete the \nremaining modules of the 1 year BEd training, either by distance mode through BOU, or in face-\nto-face mode through the government TTCs, MMTI, or accredited private TTCs. The full BEd \nincrement will be awarded to all trained teachers on completion of the accredited BEd.  \n \n29.  All serving untrained teachers over the age of 40 years will be encouraged to enroll \nvoluntarily for the 3-month in-service training certificate, either through the training institute \ncourses, if space is available, or through distance mode. In the same way as for the younger \nteachers, a percentage (35%) of the existing BEd increment will be awarded on completion of \nthe training and successful teachers will be registered as qualified. Those qualifying through this \nmethod will be encouraged to complete the BEd voluntarily through distance mode, and the full \nBEd increment will be awarded on completion. \n \n30.  Teacher In-Service Professional Development. All serving teachers, both trained and \nuntrained, will undergo compulsory in-service professional development training at least once \nduring the project period, carried out through the upgraded network of training institutes and \nselected private TTCs. A system of selective need-based specialist in-service training will be \ndeveloped to upgrade teachers in areas of identified weakness and will be provided through \nspecialist  courses.  Distance  education  delivery  mode  will  be  developed,  as  appropriate,  \nfor selected aspects of in-service continuing professional development. \n \n31.  Training  for  Teacher  Trainers.  Increasing  the  number  of  teacher  trainers  and \nimproving their quality, in both subject matter and pedagogy, will improve the quality of teaching ", "8  \nand learning. With the assistance of the Project, the quality of the teacher trainers working in the \nTTCs  and  in  other  teacher  training  network  institutions  will  be  upgraded  and  enhanced. \nCapacity building will be provided through a combination of international and local training, \nleading to Master of Education (MEd), postgraduate diploma, and other relevant postgraduate \nstudies for potential teacher trainers in education service, coordinated through NAEM with the \nassistance of the Project. The newly developed program of initial teacher education, prepared \nwith assistance from SESIP, will be the basis for this training. Staff development inputs under \nSESIP's teacher education component will create a key initial critical mass of teacher trainers, \nthat will be a valuable resource for the Project when expanding staff development activities in \nthe colleges and training institutions. \n \n32.  Teacher Training Materials. The training required for a quality teaching force will \nnecessitate  improved  teaching  and  training  materials  for  certificate  and  BEd  training\u2013  \ne.g.,  trainers\u2019  guides,  textbooks,  and  manuals  for  the  revised  in-service  and  preservice \nsyllabus\u2013and support for teachers in schools. The materials will be prepared in formats suitable \nfor  use  through  both  the  standard  face-to-face  training  and  distance  education  modes  of \ndelivery. BOU has the facilities for producing and distributing the required teacher training \nmaterials and will be commissioned to carry out this work, supported with enhanced facilities, \nmaterials, and assistance from the Project. Ownership and copyright of training materials will lie \nwith  NAEM.  All  materials  produced  under  the  Project  will  be  audited  to  ensure  gender \nsensitivity.   \n \n33.  Innovation  and  Development  Fund.  An  innovation  and  development  fund  will  be \nestablished and made available to teacher education institutions to support and implement \nreforms and innovative schemes for improving quality of teaching, particularly those initiated at \nthe local level through schools, TTCs, MMTI, SESDCs, HSTTIs, and resource centers in \npartnership with other organizations. Innovative schemes may include, where possible, learning \nfrom and working with nongovernment organizations (NGOs), which have experience in teacher \ntraining  in  secondary  education.  The  fund's  operation  manual  will  be  finalized  at  project \ninception, detailing the application procedures, selection criteria, regulations and guidelines for \nfunding,  and  reporting  and  monitoring  requirements.  An  innovation  and  development  fund \ncommittee, whose composition will be subject to the prior approval of ADB and CIDA, will \nassess the proposals according to a set criteria agreed upon by the Project, ADB and CIDA.     \nA description of the fund, including draft criteria, is in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n4.  Increasing Equitable Access and Improving Community Involvement \n34.  Increased Access. The importance of improving teaching quality in the remote and \nunderserved areas will be emphasized by giving priority for both initial and in-service training to \nteachers from those areas, including ethnic minorities, in line with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous \nPeoples. The supply of good quality teachers will be ensured by a policy providing for additional, \nor enhanced, training grants for teachers from those areas. The training grants are described in \nSupplementary Appendix D.  \n \n35.  With assistance from the Project, three outreach stations or mobile satellite teacher \nresource  centers  will  be  established  to  improve  access  to  teacher  education  in  areas  of \nRangamati  in  Chittagong  Hill  Tracts  (CHT),  Patuakhali,  and  Thakurgaon,  with  appropriate \nprofessional linkages with the nearest training institutes. These underserved and remote areas \ndo not have a teacher training institute. A network of outlying or mobile facilities will be piloted \nand developed, based on the resource centers. The pilots will include school cluster-based \ndistance education for teachers and professional development in remote and underserved \nareas. In addition, teacher resource centers will be established at the three new TTCs currently ", "    9\nbeing constructed by the Government in Sylhet, Faridpur, and Pubna. To encourage teachers to \nwork in the underserved areas, a teacher deployment policy will be developed. The Government \nwill extend the current incentive package\u2014provided to government employees in CHT, remote \nand underserved areas\u2014to secondary school teachers who serve in those areas or represent \nethnic minorities.  \n \n36.  Improved Teaching and Learning for Disadvantaged Children. With support from the \nProject, special teaching and learning materials will be prepared for teachers working with \nchildren  from  various  disadvantaged  groups  such  as  the  disabled,  ethnic  minorities,  and \nrefugees.  Assistance  will  be  provided  in  preparing  and  training  for  the  delivery  of  these \nmaterials, which will be prepared at selected institutions that have expertise in these areas. \nGroups of teachers and teacher trainers will be sent for overseas study in these specialist areas \nand topics. In the initial and in-service training for all head teachers and for district and other \ngovernment officials, a training component will be developed on ways of enhancing the teaching \nand learning of children from disadvantaged groups.  \n \n37.  Female  Teachers  and  Teacher  Educators.  Government  policy  allocates  30% of \nteacher postings to female teachers. The Project will build on successful interventions made by \nvarious development partners to further develop measures to encourage  the participation of \nwomen teachers in secondary education. The Project will continue and expand the tested \nstrategies for training and efficient employment of female  teachers, including those for female \nteaching fellows, developed by PROMOTE. This strategy is important for increasing motivation \nof SMCs in sending female teachers for training, since the strategy not only supports female \nteachers\u2019 participation, but also provides for a substitute teacher for the school while the female \nteacher is undergoing training. In addition, the MEd training approach for teacher educators \nincludes  flexible  arrangements  to  allow  better  access  also  for  female  teacher  educators.  \nThe MEd training approach is described in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n38.  Social Awareness and School Management Committees. Community and parent \nparticipation, together with general public awareness of educational change, will be promoted \nthrough a social awareness and information program disseminated in meetings, newspaper \narticles, letters to parents, and television and radio media campaigns. The program will seek to \npromote  a  genuine  dialogue  and  build  support  for  proposed  changes,  and  to  encourage \ncommunity and parent participation, particularly in support of teachers attempting to improve \nteaching quality. An awareness training program will be developed for use with SMCs, and other \nparent and support groups, including NGOs, to promote understanding and support for change \nand improvement in teaching quality. SMC training courses and materials designed by SESIP \nand PROMOTE will be utilized where appropriate. The awareness program will include a flexible \nrange of topics. In addition to the paradigm shift in education, for example, topics such as the \nmerits  of  employing  head  teacher  or  teachers  with  adequate  qualification  and  teaching \nexperience, use of learning materials, issues of private tuition, commercial purpose in building \nschools, issues of teachers working with children from disadvantaged groups etc., may be \nincluded. Also, the merits of including in SMCs retired head teachers and teachers, and other \nqualified and experienced members will be addressed. Inclusion in SMCs of female community \nleaders, elected women local government representatives, and mothers of secondary school \npupils will be supported. \n \nC.  Special Features \n39.  The Project provides for comprehensive development of teacher training in secondary \neducation,  and  is  the  first  such  project  in  Bangladesh.  The  Project  will  pursue  policy, \ninstitutional, and systemic developments required for sustainable improvement of quality of ", "10  \nteacher training. The design features emphasize gender and social development as crosscutting \ndimensions in its components. The Project's national vision is to create the environment for \nnationwide improvement in education of teachers for secondary schools. This is important given \nthat the Government, together with ADB and a large group of other development partners, \nrecently embarked on improving primary education and its quality on a large scale. The demand \nfor better teaching quality, particularly in grades 6\u201310 in secondary education will increase \nsubstantially due to the increase in the number of primary school graduates, and the improved \nlevel of learning in primary schools.  \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n40.  The total cost of the Project, including physical and price contingencies, and taxes and \nduties, is estimated at $108.7 million equivalent. Of this amount, $37.2 million equivalent  \n(34% of the total cost) is the foreign exchange cost, and $71.5 million equivalent (66%) is the \nlocal currency cost. The cost estimates are summarized in Table 1.

Financing Plan \n41.  The Project will have a total cost of $108.7 million equivalent. It is proposed that ADB \nprovide a loan of $68.9 million in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights (SDR) \n47,000,000 from its Special Funds resources to finance 63% of the project costs. The amount \ncovers $29.9 million equivalent of the foreign exchange cost and $39.1 million equivalent of the ", "    11\nlocal currency cost. The term of the proposed loan will be 32 years, including a grace period of 8 \nyears, with an interest charge of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter. The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) is planning to provide joint \ngrant cofinancing of $18.0 million (17% of total costs), to be administered by ADB and subject to \nADB  guidelines  and  procedures  for  procurement  of  goods  and  services  and  consultant \nselection. The external financing will be used to finance a portion of the costs relating to civil \nworks, procurement of vehicles, equipment, learning resources,  training, consulting services, \nresearch, and interest charge during construction, but will exclude salaries of regular project \nstaff, rental of office space, and taxes and duties. The financing plan is in Table 2 and the \ndetailed financing plan is in Appendix 5. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nForeign  Local  Total \nSource  Percent \nExchange  Currency  Cost \n         \nAsian Development Bank  29.9  39.1  68.9      63a \nCanadian International Development Agencyb    7.3  10.7  18.0           17a \nGovernment of Bangladesh  0.0  21.7  21.7          20 \nTotal  37.2  71.5  108.7       100 \na  Operation Manual, section H3/BP, para. 10, states that, in justifiable cases in poorer Developing Member \n  Countries (DMCs), the combined  financing by ADB and cofinanciers may exceed the cost-sharing limit. \nb    Joint grant co-financing is subject to final confirmation from Canadian International Development Agency. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Management and Coordination \n42.  DSHE, acting under the overall guidance of MOE, will be the Executing Agency (EA) for \nthe Project. DSHE will be accountable for making project implementation adhere to Government \nand ADB procedures and guidelines, as well as for overall transparency and accountability in \nusing project funds. DSHE has satisfactorily executed ADB\u2019s Higher Secondary Education \nProject (footnote 4), and the Secondary Education Development Project (footnote 6) and is the \nEA for the ongoing SESIP (footnote 2). DSHE\u2019s performance and capability for implementing \nthe Project are considered adequate. \n \n43.  MOE will establish a project steering committee (PSC) to oversee the work of DSHE and \nthe  project  management  unit  (PMU);  and  to  provide  policy  and  strategic  guidance,  and  \ninter-ministerial and interinstitutional coordination of training programs and project interventions. \nThe secretary of MOE will chair the PSC, and the project director will act as member secretary. \nThe PSC will consist of senior-level representatives from Ministry of Establishment, Economic \nRelations Division, Planning Commission, Finance Division, Implementation Monitoring and \nEvaluation Division, Ministry of Primary and Mass Education, Ministry of Women and Children's \nAffairs,  Ministry  of  Chittagong  Hill  Tracts  Affairs,  Ministry  of  Food,  Relief  and  Disaster \nManagement, Ministry of Labor and Employment, as well as representation from NAEM and \nBOU.  The  PSC  may  co-opt  other  members  as  necessary.  The  PSC  will  meet  whenever \nnecessary but, in any case, not less than once every quarter.  It will (i) approve annual project \nprogress reports, annual operation plans, as well as the supporting budgets; (ii) provide overall \npolicy and operational guidance in implementing the Project, and decide on corrective action if \nneeded; (iii) undertake interministerial coordination essential to achieve the reforms agreed \nupon for teacher training in support of the Project; and (iv) resolve issues and conflicts that may \nemerge  during  project  implementation.  In  addition  to  the  PSC,  a  project  implementation  ", "12  \ncommittee to be established will meet at least every second month. It will have representation \nfrom all institutions involved in implementing the Project, and be chaired by the DSHE director \ngeneral. The project director will be a member secretary of the implementation committee. As \nand when necessary, technical committees may also be formed. \n \n44.  A PMU headed by a project director with professional background in education, and \nsupported by international and domestic consultants will be established within DSHE. It will be \nresponsible for the day-to-day management of project implementation, and monitoring and \nevaluation (M & E) of progress. More specifically, the PMU will help DSHE to (i) prepare the \nannual  operational  plans;  (ii)  undertake  procurement  activities;  (iii)  prepare  and  maintain \nfinancial records, accounts, and statements; (iv) prepare all consolidated progress reports, \nincluding  the  midterm  review  (MTR)  report,  as  well  as  the  project  completion  report;                  \n(v) organize project M & E activities; (vi) coordinate the work of the consultants; and (vii) liaise \non project implementation matters with ADB. The PMU will also have a deputy project director \nwith professional background in financial management of projects, as well as officers in charge \nof training, procurement, and M & E. The PMU will have an adequate number of support staff. \nTo  ensure  close  coordination  of  the  project  activities  and  training  programs,  operational \nbranches of the PMU will be established at the major stakeholder institutions of the Project. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n45.  The Project will be implemented for 6 years. Estimated effectiveness date is April 2005, \nand end date is March 2011. An indicative implementation plan is shown in Appendix 6. \n \n3.  Procurement \n46.  All local procurement through local competitive bidding (LCB) will take into account the \nrecommendations of the current Government procurement reform, and follow the new Public \nProcurement Regulations 2003, acceptable to ADB. Before any procurement starts, the EA will \nsubmit for ADB's approval a list or lists of the goods to be procured, grouping of the goods, and \nthe proposed number and scope of civil works to be awarded. Indicative procurement packages \nare in Appendix 7. \n \na.  Civil Works \n47.  Civil works will focus on upgrading the facilities of secondary education teacher training \ninstitutions for effective use of these facilities in implementing the improved teacher education \nprograms. With support from the Project, facilities for resource centers will be constructed at the \nthree  new  TTCs,  which  are  being  built  by  the  Government.  The  Project  will  support  the \nconstruction of outreach stations or resource centers to improve access to teacher education in \nthe remote and underserved areas. Civil works contracts not exceeding $500,000 are unlikely to \nattract the interest of international contractors and will therefore be awarded by LCB procedures \nas described in Public Procurement Regulations 2003, acceptable to ADB. Civil works contracts \nbelow the statement of expenditure limit of $100,000 will be permitted only on a case-by-case \nbasis. Through the PMU, the Government will submit details on the number and scope of civil \nworks for ADB approval, before withdrawing for any expenditure for civil works. Efforts will be \nmade to limit the number of contracts, engage larger professional contractors, and award \ncontracts to prequalified contractors to be managed by the Engineering Department of MOE in \naccordance with Public Procurement Regulations 2003. The Government has assured that no \nresettlement of people will be involved, other resettlement issues as defined in ADB\u2019s Policy on \nInvoluntary Settlement will not occur, and all contractors will comply with applicable labor \nlegislation, including that on child labor.  ", "    13\nb.  Equipment and Materials \n48.  The Project will provide equipment and materials to the training institutions and resource \ncenters. Vehicles and equipment will be procured through international competitive bidding \n(ICB)  for  packages  above  $500,000  and  international  shopping  (IS)  for  packages  below \n$500,000, financed from the ADB loan and CIDA cofinanced grant funds administered by ADB,  \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Computers, accessories, furniture for \noffices and training institutions, and miscellaneous office equipment will be procured through \nLCB procedures for packages between $100,000 and $500,000 in accordance with Public \nProcurement Regulations 2003. To ensure economy and efficiency, goods of similar nature will \nbe grouped into packages under one or more bids. Contracts will be awarded on the basis of a \nleast-cost combination of packages.  \n \n4.  Consulting Services  \n49.  All international and associated domestic consultants will be financed from the ADB loan \nand CIDA cofinanced grant funds administered by ADB, and will be selected and engaged as \none consultancy package through an international consultancy firm in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants, and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging \ndomestic consultants. Given the extensive development needs of the teacher education sector \nin secondary education and the challenge to improve its quality significantly, the Project will \nhave a strong focus on capacity building, including intensive training in support of faculty \ndevelopment. Adequate inputs through consultancy support will be necessary. It is estimated \nthat  at  least  433  person-months  of  international  and  735  person-months  of  domestic \nconsultants\u2019 inputs will be necessary to support the organizational development and capacity \nbuilding of NAEM and NTRCA, build faculty capacity across the network of teacher training \ninstitutions, and implement other activities of the Project. Given the strong focus of the Project \non quality improvement, it is of utmost importance that the best consultants available will be \nselected.  Therefore,  quality-based  selection  (QBS)  method  will  be  used  for  recruitment.            \nIn addition, the Project includes a flexible provision for  a pool of international and domestic \nconsultancies  for  the  EA  to  meet  additional  needs  possibly  arising  during  project \nimplementation, including small consulting services contracts for supervision of civil works for \nwhich domestic consultants will be selected by the EA in accordance with Public Procurement \nRegulations  2003.  The  indicative  schedule  of  consultancy  inputs  is  in  Supplementary     \nAppendix F. Outline terms of reference for consultants are in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n5.  Advance Action \n50.  Given the need to have the Project operating immediately after loan effectiveness, ADB \nhas approved advance action for procuring  office equipment and vehicles for the PMU. The \nGovernment has been advised that advance action does not commit ADB to finance the Project. \nADB will, as requested by the Government and on behalf of the EA, shortlist consultancy firms, \ninvite proposals, and evaluate and rank them. ADB will start shortlisting consulting firms before \nloan approval. The EA will negotiate the contract with the first ranked firm.  \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n51.  ADB  loan  proceeds  and  ADB-administered  CIDA  cofinanced  grant  funds  will  be \nadvanced to the Borrower and deposited in dollar imprest accounts held in a commercial bank \nnominated by the Finance Division of the Ministry of Finance, and acceptable to ADB. The initial \namount advanced to the imprest accounts will not exceed the estimated expenditures for the \nfirst 6 months of project implementation or 10% of the total loan amount, whichever is less.   ", "14  \nThe imprest accounts will be established, managed, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook, and detailed arrangements agreed to by the Government and \nADB. The Borrower can then transfer funds from the imprest accounts into the taka account as \nneeded. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditure (SOE) procedure may be used to reimburse eligible \nexpenditures and to liquidate advances made into the imprest accounts in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Guidelines. SOE procedures will apply to individual payments of less \nthan $100,000. On a quarterly basis or earlier, the EA can apply to ADB for liquidation or \nreplenishment of the imprest accounts. The withdrawal application must include an SOE. ADB \nwill review the withdrawal applications and will approve eligible expenditures to replenish the \nimprest accounts.  \n \n7.  Accounting, Financial Auditing, and Reporting \n52.  The PMU will maintain consistent records, accounts, and related financial statements \nadequate to identify goods and services financed under the Project. The PMU will submit \nquarterly  financial  reports  to  ADB  according  to  ADB\u2019s  rules  and  regulations. Independent \nauditors acceptable to ADB will audit the project accounts and related financial statements each \nyear  in  accordance  with  sound  auditing  standards.  The  audited  accounts  and  financial \nstatements and the auditor\u2019s report will be submitted to ADB within 9 months after the close of \neach fiscal year. The audit report will include the audit of the imprest accounts and SOE, and a \nseparate audit opinion on their use. Additional financial audits and financial management and \nsystems reviews may be undertaken through ADB in accordance with agreed-upon rules and \nregulations. \n \n8.  Project Performance, Monitoring, and Evaluation \na.  Baseline Survey \n53.  Baseline indicators will be finalized at project inception. The baseline will consist of two \nlevels of  data:  improvement  in  training  in  teacher  training  colleges  and  institutions,  and \nimprovement in teaching and learning in secondary schools. For this purpose, a cohort of \nteachers  trained  under  the  Project  will  be  followed  up.  Baseline  data  and  indicators  on \nperformance required from teacher training colleges and institutions as well as on teaching \ncompetencies  and  classroom  management  skills  required  from  teachers  will  be  used.  \nWhen finalizing the indicators, the indicators developed with the assistance of SESIP will be \nincorporated where applicable. In addition, the database and expertise of BANBEIS will be \nutilized for the baseline design and data collection. Project support will strengthen the capacity \nof DSHE, NAEM, and BANBEIS to plan, analyze, and use baseline data for policy and planning. \nThe outline of the baseline indicators is in Supplementary Appendix H.  \n \nb.  Project Performance Management System \n54.  A comprehensive performance management system will be established for the Project. \nThe project framework, the set of verifiable indicators, and the M & E procedures and systems \nto be established at the EA will ensure comprehensive and timely progress reporting. The EA \nwill, with support from the PMU, prepare and submit to ADB quarterly progress  reports on \nproject implementation, within 3 weeks after the end of each quarter. The progress reports will \nindicate,  among  other  things,  (i)  progress  made  against  established  targets;  (ii)  problems \nencountered during the period and remedial actions taken or proposed to resolve the problems; \n(iii)  compliance  with  loan  covenants;  and  (iv) proposed  implementation  activities  to  be \nundertaken  and  physical  and  financial  progress  expected  during  the  succeeding  quarter, \nincluding detailed contract awards and disbursement projections. The EA will prepare a project ", "    15\ncompletion report and submit it to ADB not later than 3 months after physical completion of the \nProject. The report will analyze overall progress, achievement of outputs and compliance with \nthe loan covenants, and will include costs. \n \n55.  The  performance  management  system  will  determine  whether  the  inputs  for \nimplementing project activities have yielded the expected outputs and benefits to the intended \nbeneficiaries. The data will be disaggregated according to gender, and will also indicate project \nprogress in improving the access of disadvantaged groups as well as participants from remote \nareas to teacher training. The system will seek to detect any deficiency in and discrepancy \nbetween the operational plan and execution in using the resources efficiently, so that timely \ncorrections can be made to update the plans to improve benefits, outcomes, and impact. \nInformation from progress reports, annual reviews, the MTR, and from external M & E will be \nalso utilized.  \n \n9.  Project Review \na.  Annual Reviews  \n56.  The  Government,  ADB,  and  CIDA  will  jointly  review  project  progress  annually  to \ndetermine compliance with specific loan covenants and whether all required inputs and support \nfunctions on the Government side are in place. The review will also evaluate the effectiveness \nof implementation mechanisms. Reviews will specifically (i) analyze the results of the previous \nyear, (ii) identify adjustments needed, (iii) assess the impact of the Project on poverty reduction, \n(iv) assess project contributions to improving the quality of teacher education in secondary \neducation, (v) assess implementation performance against agreed-upon indicators and adjust \nindicators as needed, (vi) identify policy issues in teacher education in secondary education, \nand  (vii)  identify  constraints  to  project  implementation.  Special  attention  will  be  given  to  \n(i) the effectiveness of project strategies for promoting greater participation of female students \nand  students  from  disadvantaged  groups  and  remote  areas,  (ii)  progress  on  key  project \ninnovations, and (iii) coordination of project interventions. \n \nb.  Midterm Review  \n57.  The Government, ADB, and CIDA will jointly undertake an MTR during year 3 of project \nimplementation to assess progress in meeting the long-term vision for  teacher education in \nsecondary  education  in  Bangladesh.  The  MTR  will  evaluate  (i)  project  scope,  design, \nimplementation arrangements, and institutional changes; (ii) implementation progress against \nagreed-upon indicators; (iii) procurement performance; (iv) PMU effectiveness; (v) performance \nof consultants; (vi) fund flows and arrangements;  (vii) progress in implementing the gender \nstrategy; (viii) lessons learned; and (ix) other issues agreed upon by the Government, ADB, and \nCIDA. One month before the MTR, the EA will submit to ADB a comprehensive report covering \nthe above issues. Feedback on project implementation will be sought from civil society during \nthe  MTR.  The  MTR  will  recommend  changes  in  project  design  and  implementation,  \nas necessary.  \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Expected Benefits \n58.  The  Project  focuses  on  systemic  improvement  in  delivery  of  teacher  training  in \nsecondary education, and its planning, management, and monitoring. The improvements will \nestablish  the  necessary  foundation  for  more  efficient  and  effective  teacher  training  and ", "16  \nimprovement in quality of teaching and learning in secondary schools. Key improvements that \nwill contribute to the sustainable development of better quality secondary education include the \ndevelopment of high quality initial and in-service training programs for teachers and head \nteachers. Quality improvements will include also improved training materials and facilities.  \nThe training programs will ensure greater use of classroom practices that are appropriate for \nteaching  and  learning  in  secondary  education.  In  support  of  project  implementation,  \nthe Government will introduce compulsory teacher qualification requirements in secondary \neducation. This is likely to create more demand for better organized teacher training, particularly \namong the vast numbers of untrained teachers in secondary education. As 30% of the teachers \nwill reach retirement age at project completion or soon after, the efficiency and benefits of the \ninvestment will further be achieved by prioritizing teachers under 40 years of age for training \nunder the Project. Ensuring that these improvements reach beyond the urban areas to the \nfurthest  regions  will  help  overcome  the  barriers  caused  by  remoteness  and  geography.  \nAccess of candidates from remote areas and disadvantaged groups to teacher training will be \nsupported.  However,  none  of  these  improvements  will  be  sustainable  without  enhanced \ncapacity and efficiency of the teacher training system. The long-term benefits will be improved \norganizational  and  institutional  development,  human  resource  development  strategies  for \nteacher training, and the provision of additional financial and other resources that will ensure \ngreater long-term sustainability of secondary teacher training, both technically and financially.  \n \n59.  The Project  will further improve access by female candidates, and the proportion of \nfemale teachers is planned to reach 30% during the Project from the current proportion 17%. \nAppropriate  gender  dimensions,  and  gender  equality  training  and  social  development \ndimensions  will  be  incorporated  and  mainstreamed  in  the  teacher  training  programs  and \nmaterials. The role of women as members of SMCs will be supported. The role of SMCs in \nsupporting improvement of teaching quality will be part of the project efforts at grassroots level. \nThe summary poverty reduction and social strategy form is in Appendix 8. \n \n60.  The Project will contribute to poverty reduction indirectly. The indirect beneficiaries are \npupils in secondary schools who will benefit from the improved teaching skills of teachers. \nImprovement in teaching quality will further improve learning by pupils, resulting in better \neducation outcomes and better performance in the labor market. Details of the poverty impact \nassessment are in Supplementary Appendix I.  \n  \n61.  Overall,  the  estimated  immediate  beneficiaries  in  secondary  education  are  the  \n(i) 100,000 serving untrained teachers (below 40 years of age) who will be trained as teachers, \n(ii) all 50,000 new teachers who will benefit from training at TTCs and institutions using new \ntraining methods and delivery modes, (iii) all 17,000 head teachers who will benefit from the \nupgraded  head  teacher  training,  (iv)  over  200,000  serving  teachers  who  will  benefit  from \nprofessional development programs introduced by the Project, and (v) over 700 teacher trainers \nwho will benefit from professional development they receive. The ultimate beneficiaries will be \nthe pupils in grades 6\u201310, estimated at 9.5 million by the end of the project period. \n  \nB.  Risk Analysis \n62.  The  design  of  the  Project  draws  heavily  from  the  lessons  learned  from  previous \ninterventions.  Implementation  will  be  supported  through  the  comprehensive  policy  and \ninstitutional reform matrix with linkages to the loan assurances. While the Government is \ncommitted  to  these  reforms,  there  is  a  risk  that  a  future  Government  could  reverse  this \ncommitment. This risk is mitigated by the fact that the reforms are linked with wider long-term \ndevelopment frameworks in the sector and beyond, with the national poverty reduction strategy, \nand the medium-term macroeconomic framework (MTMF).  ", "    17\n63.  There is also a risk that the Government may not be able to allocate adequate financial \ncounterpart resources for the Project. Therefore, as part of the risk mitigation analysis and \npreparation of the financial plan, financial affordability and sustainability of the proposed Project \nwas  analyzed  based  on  the  MTMF  in  National  Strategy  for  Economic  Growth,  Poverty \nReduction  and  Social  Development,  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  Staff  Report, and \nBangladesh Public Expenditure Review. As a result of the administrative changes, upgraded \ntraining facilities, and training grants introduced by the proposed Project, there is a direct cost \nimplication in the recurrent budget for teacher training after the project period. Approximately an \nadditional Tk17 million will be required. In addition, it is estimated that another Tk28 million will \nbe necessary every 5 years after the project period to cover the cost of major maintenance of \nbuildings and furniture. These amounts can be sufficiently financed through the proposed 10% \nannual increase in real terms in the teacher training budget. A corresponding assurance has \nbeen included in the loan agreement. Given the relatively small size of the teacher training \nbudget, the required increase would be only about Tk30 million by the end of the Project.  \nSuch an increase can be absorbed by the increase in the overall secondary education budget. \nIn terms of indirect cost implications, changes in the teacher qualification policy during the \nproject period will lead to salary increase from untrained to trained teacher pay scale levels. \nThere will be approximately 133,000  more trained teachers by 2011 (including training both \nserving untrained teachers and new teachers). It is estimated that the increase in number of \ntrained teachers will require approximately an additional Tk503 million to Tk1,436 million by the \nend of the Project, depending on how many teachers who receive initial training will continue to \nBEd level training.  In addition,  depending on the salary level of teachers working in remote \nareas, indirect costs in the range of Tk285 million\u2013Tk327 million will be incurred in providing the \nproposed incentives for secondary school teachers in remote areas. The total additional budget \nrequirement as a result of indirect costs will be in range of Tk788 million\u2013Tk1,763 million.  \nSuch increase can be absorbed by increments in the secondary education budget between \n2005 and 2011 under the base case scenario, based on ADB and IMF analysis of the economy. \nThe summary of the economic and financial analyses is in Supplementary Appendix I.  \n \n64.  There is a risk that no sufficient demand for teacher training may materialize. By project \neffectiveness, the Government  will have approved a policy requiring that all new secondary \nteachers must be trained to a minimum 1 year BEd level and no untrained teachers will be \nappointed to teacher posts in secondary schools after 2007. The policy will increase the \ndemand and motivation of untrained teachers for training. However, the opportunity costs of \nfemale teachers and teachers from remote areas or other disadvantaged groups may be too \nhigh. This risk is mitigated by providing training grants for participants from these groups, and a \nsalary incentive for teachers in remote areas. The strategy tested by PROMOTE, which will be \ncontinued by the proposed Project, is important for motivating SMCs to send female teachers \nfor training, since the strategy supports not only female teachers\u2019 participation, but also the \nprovision of a substitute teacher for the school while the female teacher is in training.  \n \n65.  Establishing  and  building  capacity  of  the  NTRCA,  and  developing  of  appropriate \ntransparent procedures in this area are expected to significantly mitigate the risk of abuse and \nrent-seeking in the hiring practices in private secondary schools.  Currently the Government \nprovides  90%  salary  subvention  to  teachers  in  private  secondary  schools.  Currently  the \nsubvention system is not effectively linked with quality assurance indicators at school level and \nso result in wastage of resources and poor governance. Recruitment of trained, qualified, and \nregistered head teachers and teachers by the private secondary schools will be linked with the \nsubvention provided by the Government for these schools. This will further significantly mitigate \nthe risk of abuse and rent-seeking. As part of development of teacher training programs, and \ntheir  accreditation,  the  end  objective  of  the  training,  i.e.,  \"better\"  teachers  with  improved \nteaching competencies and classroom management skills, will be defined in detail. Similarly, the ", "18  \nobjectives of head teacher training will be further improved. These objectives will provide \nindicators for monitoring the efficiency and outcome of training, and also for quality control of \nteaching in schools after the training. Further professional development events and programs \nwill be provided to support trained teachers and head teachers in improving their performance \n \n66.  The Project\u2019s environmental impacts were reviewed, and no significant adverse impacts \nwere identified. However, if science laboratories in the teacher training colleges and institutions \nunder the Project will involve the handling and disposal of toxic and hazardous substances, \nmitigating measures, that may include the development of environmental and safety manuals on \nthe use, handling, and disposal of these substances will be implemented.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n67.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents:  \n \n(i)  Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, the Government will have (a) standardized \nthe syllabus prepared with SESIP support, for a 1-year modular BEd course for \nuse in government and private TTCs and training institutions, including BOU; and  \n(b) adopted a basic  3-month in-service training course leading to a certificate \n(Teacher Training Certificate Module) as one of the modules of the 1-year BEd \ncourse for training untrained secondary school teachers. The Teacher Training \nCertificate Module will be compulsory for all untrained secondary school teachers \nunder the age of 40. \n \n(ii)  Within 3 months of loan effectiveness, the Government will have developed a \ntime-bound  action  plan  on  approving  and  implementing  a  written  policy  on \nawarding  35%  of  the  existing  BEd  increment  (i.e.  enhancement  in  salary \nsubvention)  to  the  secondary  school  teachers  who  complete  the  Teacher \nTraining  Certificate  Module  and  are  registered  as  qualified  teachers. \nImplementation of the policy will begin by the end of the first year of loan \neffectiveness. \n \n(iii)  Within 3 months of loan effectiveness, the Government will have (a) made a \nwritten policy decision on transforming and restructuring NAEM to become the \ninstitutional home of excellence for teacher training in secondary education with \nstaffing and budget acceptable to ADB; and (b) developed a time-bound action \nplan for institutional and organizational analysis, to be completed within 1 year of \nloan effectiveness, focusing on transforming and restructuring NAEM.  \n \n(iv)  Within 3 months of loan effectiveness, the Government will have: (a) made a \nwritten policy decision to form the NTRCA with staffing and budget acceptable to \nADB;  and  (b)  developed  a  time-bound  action  plan  for  institutional  and \norganizational analysis, to be completed within 1 year of loan effectiveness, \nfocusing on the establishment of the NTRCA.  \n \n(v)  Within 1 year of loan effectiveness, the Government will have (a) extended a \ncurrent incentive package, provided to government employees in CHT, remote \nand underserved areas, to trained secondary teachers who serve in these areas ", "    19\nor represent ethnic minorities; and (b) made a written policy decision providing \nadditional  or  enhanced  training  grants  for  secondary  school  teachers  from \nremote and underserved areas or representing ethnic minorities.  \n \n(vi)  Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, the Government will have approved a \nwritten  policy  requiring  that  all  untrained  head  teachers  must  undergo \ncompulsory initial training designed for head teachers.   \n \n(vii)  Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, the Government will have prepared a \ntime-bound action plan for (a) filling at least 75% of vacant posts of lecturers, \nassistant professors, and associate professors in TTCs, and equivalent positions \nin HSTTIs, and SESDCs, by the end of year 2 of loan effectiveness, and 100% \nby MTR; (b) creating senior positions in teacher training institutions by upgrading \na proportion of existing junior positions by MTR; and (c) establishing functional \nteacher specialization within the education cadre by the end of the year 2 of loan \neffectiveness. \n \n(viii)  Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, the Government will have established a \nseparate  budget  line  for  teacher  education  and  training  in  the  secondary \neducation budget, and increased its recurrent budget for teacher education and \ntraining in secondary education, including costs and expenses associated with \nthe establishment, staffing and operations of the NTRCA, in real value by at least \n10% per annum for each year of the project period. \n \n(ix)  Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, the Government will  have approved a \nwritten policy that after 2007, only trained, registered secondary school teachers \nwill be eligible for salary subvention; and that only secondary schools that employ \nqualified, experienced, and trained head teachers/assistant head teachers will be \neligible for school registration and subvention.  \n \n(x)  Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, the Government will have prepared a \ntime-bound  action  plan  for  provision  of  compulsory  in-service  professional \ndevelopment  training  for  all  secondary  school  teachers,  both  trained  and \nuntrained, through the network of public training institutes, and selected private \nTTCs starting from 2006. \n \n(xi)  By the end of year 1 of loan effectiveness, the Government will have developed a \ntime-bound action plan for providing special training for teachers who will serve in \nsecondary schools for children from various disadvantaged groups such as the \ndisabled, ethnic minorities, and refugees.   \n \n(xii)  By the end of the Project, at least 30% of teaching positions will be filled by \nwomen. The Government will ensure participation of women in accordance with \nthe gender strategy in Appendix 8. The Government will ensure that restructured \nSMCs will have 40% women members.  \n \n(xiii)  Within 18 months of loan effectiveness, the Government will have established \none outreach station or satellite teacher resource center in Rangamati in CHT, \nand in Patuakhali and Thakurgaon, to increase access of male and female \nteacher in those areas to quality training. \n ", "20  \n(xiv)  Within 24 months of loan effectiveness, the Government will have established an \ninnovation  and  development  fund  and  made  available  to  teacher  education \ninstitutions  to  support  and  implement  reforms  and  innovative  schemes  for \nimproving quality of teaching, particularly those initiated at the local level through \nschools, TTCs, MMTI, SESDCs, HSTTIs, and resource centers in partnership \nwith other organizations. \n \n(xv)  The Government will ensure that ADB\u2019s  Environment Policy (2002),  Policy on \nInvoluntary Resettlement (1995), Policy on Gender and Development (1998), and \nPolicy on Indigenous Peoples (1999) will be followed in all Project activities. \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n68.

Secondary  education  in  Bangladesh  is  divided  into  two  major  levels:  secondary \neducation  (grades  6\u201310,  including  junior  secondary  grades  6\u20138)  and  higher  secondary \neducation (grades 11\u201312). Over 8.6 million students are enrolled in over 18,000 secondary \neducation schools, including madrasah (religious) schools, recognized by the Government. \nEnrollments at the secondary education level have more than tripled since 1980. The growth in \ngirls' enrollment is commendable\u2014from about 600,000 in 1980 to over 4 million by 2000. Girls \nnow constitute about 55% of enrollment at the secondary level. Over the same period, the \nnumber of secondary education institutions also doubled. \n \n2.  Notwithstanding the quantitative achievements, weaknesses in the secondary system \nare reflected in the declining quality of graduates and teachers. About 60% of teachers are still \nuntrained,  while  most  schools  are  devoid  of  standard  conditions  essential  for  the  normal \ninstructional  process.  Standard  cohort  analysis  over  the  entire  secondary  education  cycle \nreveals the extent of wastage in the system in the form of failure and dropout rates.  Dropout \nrates average 44% for secondary grades 6\u201310 (49% for girls) and 38% for higher secondary \ngrades 11\u201312 (36% for girls). Pass rates for the secondary school certificate (SSC) declined \nfrom 55% in 1999 to 36% in 2003. Pass rates for the higher secondary certificate (HSC) \ndeclined from 56% in 1999 to 27% in 2002, with a slightly improved result 38% in 2003. Such \nfailure rates represent a huge wastage of financial resources. Poor and disadvantaged students \nare most affected since they rarely have other educational options and cannot afford the fees \ncharged for private additional tuition.  \n \nB.  Secondary Education System Management \n3.  School Establishment and Registration Criteria. About 98% of secondary schools are \nnongovernment  schools,  with  a  school  management  committee  (SMC)  overseeing  their \nadministration. Although private, these schools, including private madrasah schools, receive \nsubstantial  government  subsidies:  90%  of  salaries  for  teachers,  and  block  grants  for \nconstruction and maintenance. Since 2003, the authority approving applications has been the \nboards of intermediate and secondary education (BISEs). The criteria for granting approval \nrelate to several indicators: distance from nearest school, physical state of the classrooms and \nlibrary, laboratory equipment, teacher qualifications, etc. Once a school has existed for 3 years,  \nit  becomes  eligible  for  recognition,  i.e.,  receiving  government  subvention.  Recognition  is \ngoverned by the criteria mentioned above, along with performance in the standardized grade 10 \nSSC examinations.  At least 50% of students should have passed the SSC examination. \n \n4.  Due to the sharp increase in the number of secondary schools and the limited capacity \nto effectively monitor the establishment and registration of private secondary schools, the \ncriteria are not well enforced. As part of the planned education sector reform,1 Ministry of \nEducation (MOE) aims to implement an approach where competitively selected private sector \nservice providers will be entrusted with the responsibility of evaluating the readiness of schools \nand  colleges  for  establishment  or  recognition,  based  on  criteria  established  by  MOE.  \nWhile  the  Directorate  of  Secondary  and  Higher  Education  (DSHE)  and  BISE  will  remain \n                                                 \n1 The International Development Association (IDA) will support the reform through a programmatic sector adjustment \ncredit, approved by IDA in 2004. The subsector analysis presents those reform dimensions particularly, which have \nlinkages to the teacher education sector in secondary education.  \n ", "  Appendix 2  27 \nresponsible for overseeing the process and conducting random inspection, reports from the \nservice providers will become the primary basis for establishing and registering schools. \n \n5.  Government  Subvention  of  Private  Secondary  Schools.  Once  a  school  is \nrecognized, it receives monthly government subventions. This system, which is known as the \nMonthly Pay Order system  prescribes a fixed and uniform proportion of salary grants to be \nextended  to  all  nongovernment  teachers  and  employees  of  all  recognized  educational \ninstitutions.  The  subvention  currently  covers  90%  of  the  salaries  of  teaching  staff  in \nnongovernment schools. To ensure that schools have an incentive to maintain a high level of \nperformance, the subventions are meant to be linked to performance criteria and are supposed \nto be discontinued should a school not meet minimum performance criteria for a period of 5 \nyears. As part of the education sector reform agenda, the procedure for subvention is being \nstrengthened to enhance transparency. MOE has informed poorly performing schools that their \nsubvention will be terminated if they do not improve. The subvention will be linked more clearly \nto results of standardized examinations. The examination system will be reformed to become a \nmore effective system of student assessment.2 In addition, examination results and the names \nof the schools not meeting the performance criteria will be published. \n \n6.  MOE has recognized that the subvention criterion in the current form may lead to greater \ninequity in access, with the poorer areas being most adversely affected. MOE aims to improve \nthe situation by better identifying areas that are underserved, and discourage establishment and \nsubvention of new schools in areas that may have a higher number of secondary schools than \nis necessary in the light of the size of the population of secondary school-age students. \nStrengthening the capacity of Bangladesh Bureau of Educational Information and Statistics \n(BANBEIS) in school mapping studies, tracking cohort flow, and data analysis and interpretation \nin support of MOE\u2019s and DSHE\u2019s policy formulation will be important.  \n \n7.  As part of the education sector reform,  MOE aims to shift toward a grants-based \nfinancing system, linking resource allocation more closely to student enrollment, examination \nperformance, and teacher attendance.  Instead of directly receiving salaries, schools would be \ngiven tuition grants, which can be used for salaries and other inputs, particularly those for \nimproving the quality of education. This system will improve flexibility and possibilities for \nschools in choosing the right balance between salaries and other inputs.  In this direction, under \nthe female stipend programs in Bangladesh, an approach has already been successfully piloted \nwhere girls in rural areas are given a stipend to attend a school of their choice and the school \nreceives  the  tuition  for  each  supported  student.  ADB\u2019s  current  loan  project  in  secondary \neducation3 also includes a significant stipend component for poor and female students in \nsecondary education. \n \n8.  Centralized  Authority.  The  capacity  of  MOE  to  supervise  and  monitor  secondary \nschools has not increased in line with the rapid increase in the number schools. The tendency of \ncentralized authority has further exacerbated the problem. As part of the education sector \nreform, MOE aims to move toward a devolved system of governance, where the central \nGovernment will be responsible for formulating policies, financing, setting quality standards, and \nmonitoring and evaluation, and lower levels of Government will be responsible for administering \nthe system and monitoring school performance.   \n                                                 \n2  Concurrently, the Second Primary Education Development Program, where the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is \nthe lead agency, includes initiatives for improving student assessment in primary education. \n3 ADB. 1999.  Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to \n  the People's Republic of Bangladesh for the Secondary Education Sector Improvement Project. Manila. ", "28   Appendix 2 \n \n9.  SMCs  and  college  governing  bodies  (GBs)  are  required  in  all  recognized \nnongovernment  secondary  schools  and  intermediate  colleges,  respectively.  While  it  is \nunrealistic to assume that these bodies have the expertise to monitor teaching quality, they can \nhave a critical role in hiring teachers, and monitoring school performance and the presence of \nstudents and teachers during school hours. These functions become even more crucial, given \nthe lack of government capacity below the central level.  \n \n10.  Because SMCs and GBs are often composed predominantly of male elites and can be \nsubject to political interference, there is an apparent lack of interest among community members \nand guardians to participate in SMCs/GBs. Thus, the accountability of the school toward the \ncommunity is undermined. As part of the education reform agenda, MOE aims to empower \ndistrict  and  upazila  (subdistrict)  officers  to  take  greater  responsibility  in  monitoring  school \nperformance and ensure public disclosure  of  information.  To  this  end,  the  Prime  Minister \nauthorized in 2003 the establishment of district and upazila advisory committees, with authority \nto monitor school performance and ensure public disclosure of information. ADB\u2019s current loan \nproject (footnote 3) has a strong focus on decentralized secondary education management and \nbuilding the capacity of SMCs and district\u2013and upazila level officers in carrying out their roles \nmore efficiently. \n \n11.  Information  Dissemination  and  Evaluation  of  Performance. BANBEIS produces \nvaluable  data  on  secondary  education  and  recently  completed  a  comprehensive  school \nmapping exercise, which provides information on school facilities, teachers, and results of \nstandardized examinations. However, coordination between BANBEIS and the planning unit in \nMOE needs to be strengthened to ensure more effective use of data for planning. More focus is \nalso needed on evaluating school performance and feeding the results into decision making, \nand disseminating them to stakeholders\u2014parents, students, and school management \u2014to allow \nthem  to  compare  their  schools  with  other  schools.  Further  strengthening the capacity of \nBANBEIS for school mapping studies, tracking cohort flow, and analyzing and interpreting data \nin support of DSHE\u2019s and MOE\u2019s policy formulation will be important. Similarly building the \ncapacity of MOE and DSHE staff in interpreting and using of BANBEIS data for policy and \nplanning is necessary. \n \n \n1C2.  .  Organizational  Reforms  for  Coordinated  Delivery  of  Teacher  Training,  and \nRegistration and Accreditation of Teachers Trained \n12.  Effective  preservice  and  in-service  teacher  training  are  key  to  developing  better \nteachers.  A  number  of  organizations,4  including  teacher  training  colleges  (TTCs),  higher \nsecondary  education  teacher  training  institutes  (HSTTIs),  secondary  education  science \ndevelopment  centers  (SESDCs),  Madrasah  Teacher  Training  Institute  (MMTI),  as  well  as \nNational  Academy  of  Educational  Management  (NAEM),  National  University  (NU),  and \nBangladesh Open University (BOU), are currently involved in providing different aspects of \nteacher  training  in  secondary  education.  However,  coordination  and  institutional  linkage \nbetween  them  are  clearly  lacking.  To  overcome  this  problem,  the  education  reform \nrecommendations include transformation/restructuring NAEM to become the institutional home \nof excellence for secondary education teacher training. NAEM will be responsible for managing \nand  coordination  secondary  education  teacher  training  nationwide.  In  addition,  a \nNongovernment Teachers Registration and Certification Agency (NTRCA) will be established. \n                                                 \n4 In all, there are currently about 70 institutions providing teacher training in secondary education (25 public \ninstitutions and 54 private institutions). They provide training of variable quality. ", "  Appendix 2  29 \nNTRCA will be responsible for certifying, registering, and deploying all qualified teachers and \nhead teachers in secondary education, and accrediting teacher training programs.5  \n \n13.  Under the NAEM, a national integrated teacher training system will be established for \nsecondary education to link all levels of the training network from the central administration to \nthe schools,  and to coordinate and manage teacher qualification and training. NAEM will be \nresponsible for overseeing teacher training, and will become the institutional home of excellence \nfor teacher training in secondary education subsector.  \n \n14.  Teachers in Government schools are recruited by DSHE in accordance with rules of the \nGovernment and MOE, while head teachers are recruited as civil servants through the Public \nServices Commission and deployed by the Government. Teachers for private schools are \nrecruited directly by the school. The appointments procedure is clearly laid out in Government \nrules  and  regulations  and  the  SMCs  are  responsible  for  supervising  the  appointments \nprocedure. However, corruption and nepotism have undermined the transparency of the system. \nThe objective of education sector reform is to develop a transparent and high-quality system of \nteacher recruitment and teacher training guided by agreed upon criteria and standards.  While it \nis difficult to improve the quality of all teachers in the short term, it is possible to begin to tackle \nthe problem of poorly qualified new teachers entering the system.  \n \n15.  To ensure adherence to a standardized and transparent criteria in teacher recruitment, \nMOE is in process of establishing the NTRCA. The main function of NTRCA will be to certify \nand register a pool of trained, and qualified teachers and head teachers, and accredit teacher \ntraining programs. All schools that receive subvention from the Government will have to recruit \nnew teachers/head teachers from the pool selected by NTRCA. Certification will be based on \nacademic qualifications and a standardized examination conducted on an annual basis. The list \nof certified teachers/headteachers will be published and made available to all schools. SMCs \nwill still retain the authority and flexibility to recruit teachers, but these teachers must be \nselected from the prequalified pool. The formal establishment of NTRCA will require approval by \nParliament, and the NTRCA is expected to be functional in 2005. The reform aims to ensure \nthat teachers and head teachers meet basic entry standards, and to also significantly reduce the \nscope for corruption and nepotism in selecting teachers. \n  \n16.  The Government already has a policy for providing increment in the salary of existing \nteachers who completed their Bachelor of Education (BEd) training to qualify as a teacher. In \naddition,  Parliament  passed  a  legislation  granting  pensions  to  private  secondary  school \nteachers. In parallel, MOE is developing a time-bound action plan addressing issues on the \nprovision of incentives to teachers, which it expects to implement by 2005/06. \n \n17.  As part of the reforms, teacher standards in the private and public schools will be \nharmonized. Private schools will adopt standards already in place for Government secondary \nschools.  MOE, in consultation with stakeholders, has begun the process of reforming and \nupgrading the current standards, including developing a core framework of standards specifying \nthe minimum-level competencies for all teachers. The framework is expected to be implemented \nin 2005 and will be used in teacher certification.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n5  MOE has processed legislative changes for transforming/restructuring NAEM and establishing NTRCA.

Assuming an annual growth rate of 0.25% in the secondary age group and an annual \ngross enrollment rate (GER) increase of 2% in secondary education, gives the approximate \nnumbers of new teachers required during the next 6 years (Table A2). It is assumed that \nadditional teacher requirements will also be at 2%, if the teacher-student ratio remains constant \n(1:45).  \n \nTable A2:  Annual  Teacher  Number  Requirements  for  Grades  6\u201310  in  Secondary \n  Education  Based  on  Teacher  Attrition,  GER  Increase,  and  Secondary \n  Education Age Group Growth  \n  \n  Project Years \n  2005  2006  2007  2008  2009  2010 \n             \nTotal New Teachers             \nRequired  8031  7893  7725  8624  8783  8757 \n \nGER = gross enrollment rate \nSource: BANBEIS  \n \n19.  Assuming the student-teacher ratio is constant at TTCs, the annual capacity of the \npresent Government TTCs, together with the capacity of the three new TTCs, will increase the \noverall  capacity  of  Government  TTCs  to  exceed  8000  new  trained  teachers  annually  for \nsecondary education. This capacity is sufficient to meet the demand for new B.Ed qualified \nteachers until the end of the 6-year project period. An additional number of newly qualified BEd \nteachers are expected to graduate from private TTCs that meet the proposed standards of the \nNTRCA.  \n \n20.  The aim of the Teaching Quality Improvement in Secondary Education Project is to \nimprove the quality of teaching, in particular through improved teacher training systems and by \ntraining the bulk of the present untrained teachers. Quantitative expansion of the secondary \neducation system, i.e., training an increasing number of teachers due to increased completion \nrates in primary education, should be supported through additional investments (for example, \nthrough the proposed follow-on loan of ADB\u2019s current loan project in secondary education) using \nthe improved teacher training delivery systems established with the assistance of the Teaching \nQuality Improvement in Secondary Education Project.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?      priority in country poverty partnership   \n      No  agreement?      No \n \nContribution of the sector/sub-sector to reduce poverty in Bangladesh: \n \nIn the Government\u2019s poverty reduction statement, deprivation in health, education, and nutrition are used as indicators \nof human poverty. Bangladesh has shown strong national commitment to education. In recent years, Bangladesh has \nmade major strides in the education sector.  The increased allocation to education in the development budget during \nthe last 2 years reflects the commitment of the Government and donor community to the field of education. Over the \nlast  decade,  the  total  recurrent  expenditure  for  the  secondary  education  subsector  as  a  percentage  of  total \ngovernment recurrent expenditure on education has increased. The allocation for the secondary and higher secondary \neducation subsector for 2002\u20132003 represents about 41.6% of the total education budget.  The Ministry of Education\u2019s \nPerspective Plan for 1995\u20132010 identifies the general objectives for the postprimary subsector. They include (i) \nattaining universal secondary education with emphasis on work-oriented education, (ii) improving education at all \nlevels, (iii) accelerated expansion of female education at all levels, (iv) making technical education and vocational \ntraining more job oriented, and (v) reducing the rural-urban gaps in education facilities.   \n \nGross enrollment rates at the secondary level have significantly increased, and the introduction of the female \nsecondary stipend program has virtually eliminated gender disparity, at least up to the secondary school certificate \n(SSC) course level. Currently Bangladesh has approximately 18,677 secondary schools with 9.4 million students. Out \nof the total, 4.6 million are boys and 4.7 million are girls. The gross enrollment rate in secondary education averages \nabout 30%, marked by significant losses as grades advance, i.e., 38% in junior secondary, 25% in secondary, and \n19% in higher secondary education. Teachers in the secondary schools number about 240,000.    \n \nDespite significant progress in providing more students with access to secondary education, a weakness in the \nsecondary system is reflected in the declining quality of graduates and teachers. Secondary education is generally \nintended for the 11\u201317 years old. According to the Bangladesh Bureau of Educational Information and Statistics \n(BANBEIS), dropout rates average 44% for grades 6\u201310 (49% for girls) and 38% for grades 11\u201312 (36% for girls). \nPass rates for the SSC and higher secondary certificate (HSC) have been declining since 1999. In 2001, students \npassing the grade 10 SSC and grade 12 HSC examinations were 35.22% and 28.41%, respectively.  The decline in \nthe quality of education can be partly attributed to poor teaching. In the past, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has \nassisted the Government in establishing a basis for teacher education through several projects including the \nestablishment of teacher training colleges (TTCs), secondary education science development centers (SESDCs), and \nhigher secondary teacher training institutes (HSTTIs). However, 60% of the teachers are still untrained and most \nschools lack standard conditions essential for the normal instructional process. About 98% secondary schools are \nprivate schools. Most of the private schools do not follow government procedures in recruiting teachers and \nmaintaining quality standards for teaching. Many secondary schools are in deplorable physical condition with \ninadequate facilities. The problems in secondary education are multifaceted and include inadequate teacher training, \nweak training methodology and inadequate curriculum, poor performance of teachers, high percentage of untrained \nteachers, lack of proper inspection and monitoring of teachers performance, poor teaching and learning environment, \nand overcrowded classrooms. The school curriculum, the examination system, and quality of textbooks are all related \nissues that are being addressed in depth by the on-going ADB-supported Secondary Education Sector Improvement \nProject (SESIP).   \n \nThe goal of the Teaching Quality Improvement in Secondary Education Project is to enhance the quality of education \nin Bangladesh secondary schools by improving the quality of teaching. The purpose is to provide quality initial and in-\nservice teacher training, including continuing professional development, to all eligible teachers of grades 6-10 in \ngovernment and private secondary schools. The Project will emphasize the quality of teaching methodology as well as \nthe learning environment, which influences quality, standard of teaching, and school performance. The Project will \naddress access to quality teaching by the poor, the disadvantaged, ethnic minorities, and refugee children.  \n \nThe Project will also provide training to untrained teachers in madrasah secondary schools, and this training will have \na significant effect on the madrasah school system. Better trained teachers and students from madrasah schools will \nhave a positive impact on social dynamics in the communities.  \n \nContinued on next page", "56  Appendix 8 \nQuality secondary education will improve employment opportunities for young persons, especially for girls. Education \nand employment opportunities for girls would delay marriage and lead to fewer children. Access to quality secondary \neducation by the poor, the disadvantaged, ethnic minorities, and refugee children will enhance their competencies and \nchances for higher secondary and college education and employment opportunities. \n \nB.     Poverty Analysis                                                                 Proposed Classification: Poverty Intervention1 \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nBangladesh, with a population of 132 million and per capita gross national product of $350, is one of the poorest \ncountries in the world. However, estimates based on a household expenditure survey indicate that the incidence of \nincome poverty has declined from over 70% of the population in 1973 to an estimated 36% in 2001. Progress has \nbeen made in improving Bangladesh\u2019s human poverty index. Between 1992 and 1998, the index increased by 49%, \nwith marked improvements in life expectancy, adult literacy, gross primary school enrollment ratio; and decreases in \ninfant mortality rates, total fertility rates, and dropout rates in primary schools. These results were achieved through \ncontinued efforts of the Government and nongovernment organizations (NGOs) to expand the coverage of essential \nservices to the disadvantaged sections of society. Yet, Bangladesh faces severe deficiencies in the quality of health, \nnutrition, and education. The majority of the poor (about 80%) live in rural areas and most are illiterate. Most of the \nbenefits of secondary education are enjoyed by comparatively better-off families. The vast majority of the students \nwho leave and remain outside the secondary education system belong to various disadvantaged groups, including the \npoor, and landless or marginal farmers in rural areas, urban slum dwellers, children of ethnic minorities, refugees, \ndisabled children, and girls.   \n \nThe Government has attempted to ensure adequate access to basic social services, including secondary education, \nas one of the key strategies for reducing poverty. The Project will improve secondary school teaching quality and \ncreate a teaching environment that is conducive to learning and the retention of students within the school system. \nThe knowledge and skills the students will acquire will translate into social and economic benefits.  \n \nThe project component equitable access and community involvement\u2014will include interventions to increase access \nfor underserved areas and disadvantaged groups. In both initial and in-service training to teachers, priority will be \ngiven to improving teaching quality in the remote and underserved areas. Three outreach stations or satellite teacher \nresource centers will be established to improve access to teacher education in remote districts such as Rangamati, \nPatuakhali, and Thakurgaon. To encourage teachers in remote areas, a teacher deployment policy will be developed. \nSpecial  teaching  and  learning  materials  will  be  prepared  for  teachers  working  with  children  from  various \ndisadvantaged groups such as the disabled, ethnic tribes, and refugees. An awareness program will be developed for \nthe school management committee (SMC), parent and support groups, and NGOs to promote better understanding \nand support for teachers working with the poor and disadvantaged groups. \n \nProject activities such as distance education, the school cluster system, and new in-service teacher training programs, \nenhanced preservice training, and improved incentives to teachers, especially the allowance for rural teachers, are \nexpected to primarily benefit underserved and poor areas by providing better quality of teaching in secondary schools. \nWith improved teaching quality, secondary school students from poor families will have a better chance to acquire \nknowledge and skills for direct entry into the labor market or for pursuing further education. The consequences of this \nimprovement will have an impact on poverty reduction in the country, as experience has shown that improving the \nhuman capital of the poor is highly successful in fighting poverty.   \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nThe Project was prepared in consultation with various stakeholders such as the teachers, training institutes, SMCs, \ngovernment, and development partners. To enhance community participation, SMCs require restructuring. Efforts will \nbe made to include in the SMCs local government representatives, especially female ones and representatives from \nthe parents and civil society or NGOs. Capacity building and awareness raising programs will be developed for SMCs \n                                                 \n1 Following the Board approval of the R-Paper, Review of ADB\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy, staff instructions to \nreplace the PI/CPI classification with a new tracking system are under preparation, in line with para. 83 of the             \nR-Paper. \n \nContinued on next page", "  Appendix 8  57 \nthe parents and civil society or NGOs. Capacity building and awareness raising programs will be developed for SMCs \nfor recruitment of qualified teachers, and better management and quality performance of schools. Counseling of \nstudents and counseling meetings between students and teachers will be initiated in the schools to improve the \nlearning environment and to promote parents participation in improving the performance of the students and the \nschool. Parent-teacher associations will be initiated to increase community involvement in improving and monitoring \nthe quality of teaching. \n \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nGirls' enrollment at the secondary level has significantly improved. Gross enrollment rates for girls are higher than \nthose for boys up to grade 10. Much of the improvement can be attributed to the stipend programs, which support \nfemales with monthly stipends for educational expenses. But despite the positive trend in female secondary education, \ngirls' performance at the SSC examination is inferior to that of boys. In 2002, the total pass rate was 41%, and it was \n38% for girls. The performance of girls in school and retention rate are influenced by several factors: (i) distance of \nschool and related safety and security; (ii) lack of female teachers in school; (iii) extra share of household duties for \ngirls than for boys and less time for girls to prepare for examinations; and (iv) male teachers' lack of understanding of \nadolescent girls, early marriage of girls, etc.     \n \nGovernment has a 30% quota for female teachers in secondary schools. A survey (1997), carried out by Program to \nMotivate, Train and Employ Female Teachers in Rural Secondary Schools (PROMOTE) and financed by the \nEuropean Commission, showed that women compromise only 5% of the teachers on the monthly payroll in secondary \nschools in rural areas and 20\u201330% in urban areas. In the remote rural areas, 50% of the schools have never \nemployed a woman teacher. PROMOTE identified several factors preventing women from taking up employment as \nteachers: (i) social hindrance; (ii) tradition of male employment; (iii) lack of safe and decent accommodation; and       \n(iv) lack of school facilities suitable for women, e.g. lack of separate toilet facilities, and lack of separate sitting area.  \n \nThe recruitment practices of SMCs also hinder women\u2019s employment in teaching. The SMC requires the potential \nteacher to make a donation to the school. Parents prefer to make donation for the employment of a son but not for a \ndaughter. PROMOTE addresses these issues through activities that include campaign and advocacy, provision of \nfellowship for female teachers to participate in teacher training, and refurbishment of schools and hostels for women \nteachers.  The present membership structure of SMCs in secondary schools does not include female members. The \nmale-dominated SMC often has traditional attitudes toward recruiting female teachers. Since PROMOTE will end in \n2005, the Project will adopt and continue to implement strategies tested by PROMOTE to address issues regarding \nfemale teachers. In addition, the Project will the include following measures to improve the learning environment for \ngirls and to increase the number of female teachers in schools: \n \n(i)  Further  improve  the  curriculum  developed  by  the  SESIP  by  supporting  the  development  of \ncurriculum material for teachers in counseling for adolescent girls and boys; behavioral science; \ngender sensitization; social, economic, and cultural context of the learning atmosphere.  \n(ii)  Establish a process for parent-teacher counseling for adolescent girls and boys.  \n(iii)  Restructure the SMCs with the aim of including at least 40% women members. The women \nmembers will comprise mothers, elected women representatives of the local government, women \ncommunity leaders, and women teachers. \n(iv)  Set up a gender sensitization program for SMCs as part of the campaign activities for recruitment of \nfemale teachers. \n(v)  Introduce an enrollment quota for women teachers in training programs for the Bachelor of \nEducation degree at the teacher training institutions under the Project. \n(vi)  Give head teachers gender awareness training. \n(vii)  Raise the recruitment target of female teacher by another 10% (after completion of PROMOTE; \nwhich targets to achieve 12% increase in the number of female teacher).  \n(viii)  Assist schools to attain a 1:40 teacher-student ratio, to increase the demand for female teachers. \n(ix)  Facilitate SESIP\u2019s program to appoint qualified women as head examiners; and increase women \nexaminers for the divisional board. \n(x)  Make efforts to include women in management positions in the project management unit staff. \nInclude international and domestic consultants for social development and gender among those to \nbe engaged by the Project. \n(xi)  The social development and gender consultants should develop a plan of action, and a budget, to \naddress social and gender issues in implementing the Project.  \n(xii)  Include gender disaggregated data in the project management information system for monitoring.  \nContinued on next page ", "58  Appendix 8 \n \nHas an output been prepared?
