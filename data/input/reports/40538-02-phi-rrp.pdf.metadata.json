This is the third loan of a program cluster \nand  builds  on  support  initiated  under  subprogram  2,  approved  by  the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  in  September  2008.  The  loan  is  to  be \ntranche,  based  on  completed  prior  actions \nprovided  as  a  single \ndemonstrating satisfactory progress.  \n \nTargeting Classification: General intervention \nSector (subsector): Public sector management (economic and public \naffairs management) \nThemes (subthemes): Economic growth (promoting macroeconomic \nstability), governance (public administration), private sector development \n(private sector investment) \nLocation impact: National (low impact) \nPartnership: Government of Japan \n \nCategory C       \n\nimplementation  of \n\n \nThe  Government's \nits  Medium-Term  Philippine \nDevelopment  Plan  (MTPDP)  is  stimulating  higher  and  more  sustainable \neconomic  growth  (7%  per  annum  by  2009),  creating  jobs  (1  million  jobs \ncreated by 2009), and reducing poverty. Poverty rates have declined over \nthe  past  2  decades,  but  recently  increased  (to  33%  of  the  population  in \n2006 from 30% in 2003). The critical fiscal situation that emerged in 2002 \ncompressed public investment and funding for the social sectors and hurt \nthe poor. These problems were compounded by poor governance in public \nfinancial management, corruption in procurement, and a weak investment \nclimate.  \n \nReforms  supporting  fiscal  consolidation;  strengthening  governance  in \npublic  financial  management;  reducing  corruption  in  key  government \nagencies;  and  improving  the  investment  climate,  rural  development,  and \ninfrastructure are crucially important to putting economic growth on a more \nsustainable  path,  redirecting  spending \nthe  social  sectors,  and \ncontributing  to  poverty  reduction.  The  ADB  studies,  Philippines:  Critical \nDevelopment Constraints in 2007, and Philippines: Reforming Investment \nIncentives in 2009, confirmed that these areas are critical to growth in the \nPhilippines and were used in formulating subprogram 3. \n \nUnder subprogram 1, the Government implemented a series of measures \nto  address  the  fiscal  imbalance,  resulting  in  a  swift  and  impressive \nturnaround  in  the  fiscal  situation  and  greater  macroeconomic  stability  in \n2006  and  2007.  Subprogram  2  in  2008  built  on  reforms  initiated  under \nsubprogram  1  on  fiscal  consolidation  and  governance  in  public  financial \nmanagement  and  procurement.  These  measures  have  provided  much \nneeded  fiscal  space  for  greater  spending  on  the  social  sectors  and \n\nto \n\n \nBorrower \n \nThe Proposal \n\n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nThe Program \nRationale \n\n \n\n\f \nii \n \n\n \n\nthe \n\nfirst  semester  of  2009.  The  Government  has  revised \n\ninfrastructure in 2007 and 2008. With higher spending for priority sectors, \nset  within  a  medium-term  balanced  budget  framework,  the  Philippines \nenjoyed  its  best  recent  macroeconomic  performance  in  2007  with \neconomic  growth  at  7.2%  and  investment  growth  at  11.5%.  This  growth \nmomentum continued into the first quarter of 2008.  \n \nHowever,  2008  began  with  a  surge  in  global  commodity  prices.  By  the \nthird  quarter,  domestic  food  price  inflation  had  reached  25%  in  the  third \nquarter  on  a  year-on-year  basis  and  this  contributed  to  a  slowdown  in \ndomestic  consumption  and  an  increase  in  poverty.  The  global  financial \ncrisis  intensified  in  September  2008  and  adversely  affected  Philippine \nfinancial markets in two ways: (i) balance sheet deleveraging in the United \nStates  meant  investors  unbundled  financial  portfolios  in  the  Philippines, \nleading to some capital flight in the second half of 2008; and (ii) the global \ncredit  crunch  has  made  it  more  expensive  for  the  Philippines  to  access \ninternational debt markets, in both public and private sectors.  \n \nHowever, the major impact on the Philippine economy is the second-round \neffects  of  global  demand  decline  and  the  impact  on  the  Government's \nfiscal situation. Economic growth decelerated sharply in the first quarter of \n2009  following  a  40%  plunge  in  external  demand  for  exports  from \nDecember 2008 to April 2009 and lack of growth in inflows of remittances \nin \nits \nmacroeconomic  framework  and  projects  growth  at  0.8%\u20131.8%  in  2009 \nwith  higher  unemployment.  Development  partners  project  a  lower  growth \nrate in the range of \u20131.0% to 1.0% on the back of faltering exports, stalling \nforeign  investments,  and  a  projected  drop  in  remittances.  These  growth \nforecasts would translate to a decline in per capita incomes in the range of \n\u20133.0% to \u20130.2%, thereby threatening to raise poverty further in 2009.   \n \nThe  Government  has  responded  to  the  global  crisis  in  two  ways.  First,  it \nhas introduced preemptive measures to support macroeconomic stability. \nSecond, it has provided for a modest fiscal expansion in the order of 2.3% \nof  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in  2009.  The  stimulus  will  come  from \nhigher infrastructure and social spending, and cash transfers to the poor. \nThe  sharp  cyclical  downturn  in  the  economy  has  also  affected  the  fiscal \nsituation through a decline in tax revenues of 5.2% in the first semester of \n2009.  As  a  result  of  the  increase  in  spending  and  falling  revenues,  the \nGovernment revised its estimate of the national government deficit to 3.2% \nof GDP in 2009.  \n \nSubprogram  3  builds  on  reforms  initiated  under  subprogram  2  for  fiscal \nfinancial \nconsolidation  and  strengthening  of  governance \nmanagement  and  procurement. \nfocus  on \ninstitutionalizing  governance  programs  within  agencies  to  ensure  their \nlonger-term  sustainability  and  effective  enforcement,  strengthening  the \ninvestment  climate,  and  carrying  out  social  assistance  programs. \nResponding  to  the  global  financial  crisis,  subprogram  3  also  includes  a \nseries  of  policy  measures  to  address  the  increased  vulnerabilities  and \nrisks  to  the  Philippine  economy  from  the  global  financial  crisis  and  the \nimpacts  on  poverty.  These  reforms  are  designed  to:  (i)  improve  fiscal \n\nin  public \n\nincreases \n\nIt  also \n\nthe \n\n\f \n\niii \n\nin \n\nand \n\nand \n\nrural \n\nclimate \n\nstability, \n\nits  reforms \n\ndevelopment; \n\nfiscal  policy,  public \n\nimprove \nsustainability,  maintain  macroeconomic \ncreditworthiness; (ii) enhance governance in public financial management \nand  speed  up  disbursements  of  critical  public  spending;  (iii)  improve  the \ninvestment \nand \n(iv) enhance human capital and social inclusion.  \n \nAlso in response to the global economic crisis, subprogram 3 adds a post- \nprogram monitoring framework with forward-looking policy measures. The \nGovernment of the Philippines, ADB, and the Government of Japan have \nagreed to a post-DPSP framework with policy measures in order to create \nthe  basis  for  continuous  policy  dialogue  and  engagement  during  the \ncritical period of 2009\u20132010 before the Philippine presidential elections in \nMay 2010. The monitoring framework focuses on the Government's short-\nterm  plan,  advancing \nfinancial \nmanagement,  and  selected  areas  in  investment  climate  and  poverty, \nsupported  by  ADB,  the  Government  of  Japan,  and  other  development \npartners' technical and program assistance.   \n \nThe  DPSP  is  a  joint  effort  of  ADB,  the  Government  of  Japan  (Japan \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency)  and  other  development  partners  to \nsupport  and  deepen  a  common  reform  agenda  with  the  Government.  It \nreflects  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  its  reforms  over  the  medium \nterm,  and  ADB\u2019s  commitment  over  the  medium  term  to  provide  financial \nsupport  to  program  implementation.  The  Government  of  Japan  provided \nparallel financing of subprogram 2 in March 2009 and will provide parallel \nfinancing  for  subprogram  3.  In  formulating  the  DPSP,  the  Government, \nADB,  and  the  Government  of  Japan  have  drawn  on  the  Government\u2019s \nagenda as articulated through the Philippines Development Forum and its \nsector  strategies.  ADB  and  the  Government  of  Japan  have  coordinated \nreviews of subprogram 3 policy triggers with the Government. Formulation \nof subprogram 3 has benefited from input from the Australian Agency for \nInternational  Development \nfor \nInternational Development (USAID), and the World Bank.  \n \nThe impact of subprogram 3 will be to restore the Philippines to a longer-\nterm,  sustainable,  and  higher  growth  path  and  to  lower  unemployment. \nThe outcome of the subprogram 3 will be more investment through greater \nfiscal sustainability, better public financial management, a more attractive \ninvestment climate, and enhanced human capital and social inclusion. To \nachieve these objectives, subprogram 3 will support the following strategic \nreforms:  \n \n\n(AusAID),  United  States  Agency \n\n(i) \n\nto \n\nfiscal \n\nfor  2008\u20132009 \n\nsustainability,  maintenance \n\nimprovements \nof \nmacroeconomic  stability,  and  better  creditworthiness  by \nenhancing  the  quality  of  fiscal  management  by  (a) increasing  tax \nrevenues \nreforms, \ntax  administration  and  enforcement,  and \n(b)  strengthening \nreducing \nimproved  governance, \n(c)  reducing  inefficient  spending  to  permit  increased  social  and \npoverty-related spending, (d) strengthening the debt management \nstrategy  to  manage  government  contingent  liabilities  and  risks \n\ntax  policy \n\nrevenue \n\nthrough \n\nthrough \n\nleaks \n\n \n\n \nImpact and \nOutcome \n\n\f \niv \n \n\nprudently,  and  (e)  giving  depositors'  confidence  in  the  domestic \nbanking system; \n\n(iii) \n\nreporting; \n\n(ii)  enhancements  to  public  financial  management    governance  by \n(a) improving  budget  preparation,  budget  execution,  accounting, \n(b)  strengthening  performance \nrecording,  and \nmanagement  and  improving  public  service  delivery;  (c)  reforming \nprocurement;  (d)  implementing  anticorruption  and  enforcement \nstrategies  for  revenue-collecting  agencies,  and  key  procurement \nagencies;  and  (e)  sustaining  critical  public  expenditures  while \nmaintaining  budget  discipline  to  mitigate  the  poverty  impacts  of \nthe deceleration in growth; \nimprovements  to  the  investment  climate  and  promotion  of  rural \ndevelopment  by  (a)  clarifying  and  strengthening  the  legal  and \nregulatory  framework  for  investments  and  trade,  (b)  facilitating \nthrough  greater  public\u2013private \ninfrastructure  development \nparticipation  and  better  coordination  of  public \ninfrastructure \ninvestments, and (c) improving rural\u2013urban connectivity; and  \n(iv)  enhancements to human capital and social inclusion by improving \nthe  policy \nfor  social  protection,  sustaining  real \nspending  on  health  and  education,  improving  the  targeting  of \nprograms,  piloting  the  conditional  cash  transfer  (CCT)  program \ntied  to  performance  outcomes  in  child  education  and  health, \nrefining public employment programs, and establishing a national \npoverty  monitoring  and  response  system  to  help  mitigate  the \nimpact of the economic slowdown on poverty. \n\nframework \n\nA  loan  of  $250,000,000  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  will  be \nprovided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based \nlending  facility  for  subprogram  3  of  the  Development  Policy  Support \nProgram. The loan will have a 15-year term including a grace period of 3 \nyears, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based \nlending facility, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nprogram loan agreement.  \n \nThe subprogram 3 period is from October 2008 to September 2009, with a \nsingle tranche loan of $250 million to be disbursed when the Government \nhas met the conditions for loan effectiveness.  \n \nThe  Government  will  use  the  local  currency  counterpart  funds  generated \nby the loan proceeds to meet program expenditures and associated costs \nto  help  maintain  current  social  expenditure  and \nof  reform,  and \ninfrastructure spending. \n \nDepartment of Finance (DOF)  \n\n \nThe  Department  of  Budget  and  Management  (DBM)  will  be \nthe \nImplementing  Agency  responsible  for  implementing  subprogram  3.  It  will \nbe supported by relevant government line agencies, including the Office of \nthe Ombudsman, the Department of Education, Department of Agriculture, \nDepartment  of  Health,  Department  of  Public  Works  and  Highways, \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\n \nPeriod and \nTranching \n\n \nCounterpart \nFunds \n\n \nExecuting \nAgency  \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\n\f \n\nv \n\nresponsible \n\nDepartment  of  Trade  and  Industry,  and  the  National  Economic  and \nDevelopment  Authority  (NEDA).  The  DPSP  coordinating  committee \nchaired  by  the  DOF  undersecretary  and  comprising  officials  from  DOF, \nDBM,  and  NEDA,  will  be \nfor  coordinating  program \nimplementation  and  sustaining  subprogram  3  actions  with  the  DBM  and \nrelevant  government  line  agencies  involved  in  supporting  the  DPSP.  The \ncommittee  will  meet  quarterly  to  monitor  progress,  oversee  program \nimplementation, and provide guidance and direction to DOF and DBM.  \n \nThe loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange costs \n(excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and procured in ADB \nmember  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports  financed  by \nother  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be \ndisbursed  to  the  Borrower  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nSimplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for \nProgram Loans (1998). \n \nThe DPSP will provide the following significant benefits:  \n  \n(i) \n\nprogress  toward  medium-term  fiscal  sustainability  will  promote \nmacroeconomic  stability  and  foster  broad-based  economic  growth, \njob creation, and poverty reduction, all of which are cornerstones of \nthe Government\u2019s MTPDP and the Philippines Development Forum \n(the  successful  fiscal  consolidation  programs  since  2004  have \ncreated  fiscal  space  in  2009  and  2010  that  will  enable  the \nGovernment to mitigate the poverty impact from the global financial \ncrisis); \n\n(iii) \n\n(ii)  better  governance  of  public  financial  management  will  improve \nprioritization  and  efficiency  of  spending  in  key  sectors  such  as  the \nsocial sectors; \nlower  transaction  costs  for  business,  because  of  the  reduction  in \nbureaucracy,  will  open  new  opportunities,  increase  investment  and \nproductivity, boost the economy, increase incomes, and create jobs; \n(iv)  higher  infrastructure  spending  will  generate  long-term  growth, \n\n(v) \n\nstimulate investment, create jobs, and raise incomes; \nimproved  social  sector  outcomes  will  result  from  higher  spending, \nbetter-targeted  social  assistance  programs,  and  implementation  of \nthe CCT program linked to better outcomes for child education and \nhealth; and \n\n(vi)  key  governance  programs  will  be  more  sustainable,  as  the  DPSP \nwill  help  to  institutionalize  programs,  including  the  medium-term \nexpenditure  framework  and  integrity  development  reviews,  and  the  \nDOF\u2019s  anticorruption  revenue  initiatives  in  the  Bureau  of  Internal \nRevenue  and the Bureau of Customs.   \n\nis \n\nfirmly  embedded \n\n \nThe  DPSP \nthe  Philippines \nDevelopment  Forum,  and  the  Government\u2019s  ongoing  sector  strategies \ncovering  its  fiscal  program,  tax  administration  reform,  public  financial \nmanagement,  procurement  reform,  investment  competitiveness,  rural \ndevelopment,  and  social  protection.  The  assumptions  underlying  the \nDPSP include the following:   \n\nthe  MTPDP, \n\nin \n\n \n\n \nProcurement and \nDisbursement \n\nProgram Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n\f(i) \n\nThe economy will be able to continue withstand the direct effects of \nthe global financial crisis on Philippine financial markets. \n\n(ii)  The  Government  will  maintain  fiscal  expansion  in  2009  and  2010 \n\nwithin a disciplined fiscal framework. \n\n(iii)  The  Government  will  stay  on  course  with  key  policy  reform \n\nmeasures, and continue to liaise effectively with Congress.  \n \n\nHowever, the DPSP has risks:  \n \n(i) \n\nThe global financial crisis has hurt the Philippines. The second-round \neffects  of  the  decline  in  global  demand  have  had  repercussions  on \nthe  Government's  fiscal  situation  in  an  environment  of  elevated  risk \nand  higher  cost  of  financing.  A  prolonged  global  recession  and \ndysfunctional  credit  markets  would  place  further  stress  on  the  fiscal \nsituation as about $8.0 billion of public external debt matures in 2009 \nand  2010.  The  economic  slowdown  in  the  Philippines  and  the \npossibility  that  remittances  may  decline  would  feed  into  higher \npoverty  in  2009.  However,  these  potential  effects  on  poverty  would \nbe partially offset through the scaling up of the CCT and an increase \nin infrastructure development in 2009 and 2010. \n\n(ii)  With  the  economic  stresses  in  2009  and  an  election  in  2010,  the \nGovernment may be tempted to introduce populist policies that could \nthreaten  fiscal  discipline  in  2010.  However,  the  Government  has \nannounced that its budget target for 2010 is 2.5% of GDP and since \n2006 it has demonstrated commitment to meeting its fiscal targets. In \n2009, it is operating one of the lowest deficits in the region. The post-\nprogram monitoring framework will enable ADB to continue dialogue \nwith Government on fiscal policy. \n\n(iii)  The 2010 presidential elections may slow implementation of reforms. \nHowever,  the  Government  has  full  ownership  of  the  DPSP  reform \nprogram, which is embedded in the Philippines Development Forum \nand \nthe \nPhilippines,  ADB,  and  the  Government  of  Japan  have  agreed  to  a \npost-program  monitoring \nthe \nGovernment's commitment to its reform agenda. \n\nits  sector  strategies.

The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n\nA. \n\nThe Global Crisis \n\n2. \nThe  proposed  DPSP  subprogram  3  comes  at  a  critical  time  for  the  Philippines.  It  is \ndesigned to maintain the momentum of its key development efforts at a time of global financial \nmarket failure and global recession. Like many other developing economies, the Philippines has \nhad  to  cope  with  the  first-round  effects  of  the  turmoil  and  the  crisis  of  confidence  that  has \ndisrupted  the  global  financial  system  and  limited  the  country's  access  to  commercial  debt \nmarkets  since  September  2008  (Appendix  4).  Coming  into  the  global  crisis,  the  Philippines\u2019 \nmacroeconomic  performance  was  sound.  The  economy  expanded  by  3.8%  in  2008\u2014half  the \n7.3% in 2007, but above the regional average. The primary budget has been in surplus for the \nlast 3 years and its overall deficit for 2008 was 0.9% of gross domestic product (GDP), low by \ninternational standards. The public debt\u2013GDP ratio has continuously declined from over 80% in \n2003 to 56% by the end of 2008.   \n \n3. \nThe  Philippines  is  now  experiencing  the  second-round  effects  of  the  global  recession, \nwhich may be larger than those caused by the 1997\u20131998 Asian financial crisis. The economies \nof the Philippines\u2019 major trading partners and recipients of Filipino workers have entered severe \nrecessions. Global trade contracted by about 9% in the first quarter of 2009\u2014the first time since \n1982. Consequently, Philippine exports (mainly influenced by the sharp contraction in exports of \nelectronics) contracted by about 40% from December to April 2009 on a year-on-year basis. A \nconsensus  in  the  international  community  is  that  the  global  economy  may  only  experience  a \ngradual  recovery  in  2010  and  this  turnaround  will  depend  critically  on  more  concerted  policy \nactions  to  stabilize  financial  conditions  and  bolster  demand  through  fiscal  expansion  and \nmonetary policy. The Government has learned from the 1997\u20131998 financial crisis and its 2009 \nbudget  included  greater  discretionary  spending  mainly  on  infrastructure,  social  sectors,  and \ncash  transfers  to  the  poor.  As  a  result  of  these  spending  initiatives  and  lower  projected \nrevenues, the 2009 budget deficit is projected to rise to 3.2% of GDP and the Government's net \nfinancing requirements will be about P270.6 billion. Despite policy makers' immediate focus on \nthe  current  economic  crisis,  the  Government  also  considers  the  crisis  to  be  an  opportunity  to \nachieve  consensus  among  stakeholders  on  difficult  policy  issues  and  to  advance  its  medium-\nterm  development  objectives  in  fiscal  policy,  public  financial  management,  the  investment \nclimate,  and  social  sectors,  recognizing  that  these  reforms  have  helped  the  Philippines  to \nweather this crisis and to position it for recovery.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2007.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n2 \n \n\nB. \n\nThe Government and its Development Strategy \n\nthe  reform  agenda  and  how \n\n4. \nThe  DPSP  program  cluster  supports  the  Government's  development  strategy  as \ndescribed  in  its  Medium-Term  Philippine  Development  Plan,  2004\u20132010  (MTPDP),  which  sets \nout  the  country\u2019s  development  priorities,  policy  agenda,  programs,  and  projects.  2   The  key \nobjectives of the MTPDP are to achieve higher and more sustainable economic growth, create \njobs, reduce poverty, and make progress toward the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). It \nidentifies  the  major  challenges  as  the  fiscal  imbalance,  inadequate  infrastructure,  rapid \nurbanization  and  congestion  (especially  in  Metro  Manila),  increasing  unemployment,  and \ninefficient delivery of basic services. \n \n5. \nIn 2005, the Government and its international development partners decided to convert \nannual  consultative  group  meetings  into  the  Philippines  Development  Forum  (PDF).  The  PDF \nprovides an opportunity for ongoing dialogue and for involving other stakeholders, such as civil \nsociety, the private sector, and the academic community. The Government convenes the PDF \nto  discuss \nthe  development  partners  can  assist  with \nimplementation.3 The  PDF  allows  the  development  partners  to  provide  an  impetus  to  MTPDP \nimplementation. Currently the PDF has seven working groups,4 each focusing on priority areas \nof  the  Government\u2019s  development  agenda.  In  March  2006,  the  Government  agreed  with  the \nWorld  Bank  that  the  PDF  agenda  would  be  used  as  the  basis  for  a  World  Bank  development \npolicy  loan.  Shortly  thereafter,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  was  invited  to  join  the \nprocess  and  to  prepare  the  reform  agenda  through  the  DPSP.  The  agenda  was  refined  and \nmodified  through  subsequent  PDF  workshops  in  2007  and  2008  to  reflect  the  Government\u2019s \nnew priorities, and its short- and medium-term challenges. When the DPSP was first formulated \nin 2006 (footnote 1], it was anchored on four core areas of the PDF: (i) fiscal consolidation, (ii) \ngovernance,  (iii)  the  investment  climate  and  infrastructure,  and  (iv)  social  progress.  At  the \nrequest of the Government in 2008, subprogram 3 of the DPSP added rural development to the \ninvestment  climate  component,  reflecting  the  Government\u2019s  and  ADB\u2019s  increased  focus  on \nimproving the investment climate. \n \n6. \nTo  help  implement  the  MTPDP  priorities,  the  Government  adopted  several  sector \nstrategies,  most  with  a  time-bound  implementation  plan  and  clearly  defined  ministerial \nresponsibilities;  some  are  supported  by  ADB  sector  programs  and  technical  assistance \n(Appendix 9). The fiscal consolidation strategy, which began in 2004, outlined the Government\u2019s \nfiscal  stabilization  and  consolidation  strategy  up  to  2010.  It  was  successful  in  reducing  the \nnational government budget deficit from 5.2% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2003 to 0.2% \nin  2007  and  0.9%  in  2008.  Perhaps  one  of  the  most  important  achievements  of  the  fiscal \nconsolidation  program  has  been  the  creation  of  fiscal  space  to  mitigate  some  of  the  poverty \nimpacts  from  the  global  crisis  in  2009.  In  particular,  the  program  has  resulted  in  an  increased \nshare of discretionary spending; from 26% of total budget expenditures in 2006 to 37% in 2008, \nwith  the  social  sectors  and  infrastructure  the  main  beneficiaries  (Appendix  4).  As  a \nconsequence  of  the  global  crisis  and  its  adverse  impact  on  the  Philippine  economy,  the \nGovernment relaxed its medium-term fiscal target for 2009 from a national government budget \ndeficit  of  0.5%  of  GDP  to  3.2%  of  GDP  and  has  delayed  balancing  its  budget  until  2013.  The \nGovernment\u2019s  budget  and  procurement  reform  agenda,  under  the  Department  of  Budget  and \nManagement  (DBM),  is  focused  on  implementing  the  medium-term  expenditure  framework \n                                                 \n2   Government of the Philippines. 2004.

The Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) under \nthe  DBM  has  set  out  a  3-year  action  plan  for  2007\u20132010  to  implement  the  Government \nProcurement Reform Act, 2003. ADB is actively working with GPPB to harmonize Government \nand  ADB  procurement  procedures,  and  to  strengthen  the  operations  of  the  Philippine \ngovernment  electronic  procurement  system  (PhilGEPS),  which  is  mandated  under  the \nprocurement law as the portal for posting procurement agencies\u2019 bid notices and awards. The \nGovernment and stakeholders of the PDF working group on sustainable rural development held \na  strategic  agribusiness  planning  workshop  in  March  2009  toward  formulation  of  the  Strategic \nAgribusiness Development Plan with assistance from the Government of Japan. \n \nC. \n\nThe Government and Its Development Partners \n\n7. \nADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program, 2005\u20132007 for the Philippines identified three key \npriorities  for  ADB  assistance:  reducing  macroeconomic  instability  (through  fiscal  consolidation \nand  better  public  financial  management),  improving  the  investment  climate,  and  meeting  the \nneeds  of  the  social  sectors. 5  The  DPSP  puts  this  strategy  into  operation  by  providing  an \numbrella operation that complements and reinforces ADB\u2019s sector program loans and projects. \nThe DPSP, structured as a program cluster, aims to help the Government achieve its medium- \nto long-term goals of sustained economic growth of 6%\u20137% per annum, lower unemployment, \nand a reduction in poverty, as highlighted in the development policy letter addressed to the ADB \nPresident (Appendix 2). For effective development results, the DPSP focuses on a broad policy \nagenda  that  addresses  thematic  and  crosscutting  issues  in  four  core  areas:  (i)  fiscal \nsustainability; (ii) governance in public financial management and anticorruption initiatives in the \nkey  revenue-raising  agencies,  (iii) the  investment  climate,  and  rural  development,  and  (iv) \nhuman capital and social inclusion. These are all key outcomes and outputs of the ADB Country \nStrategy and Program.  \n \n8. \nThe  DPSP  emphasizes  the  achievement  of  measurable  policy  results,  while  leaving \ndetailed  policy  prescriptions  to  programs,  projects  and  TA  in  individual  sectors.  In  this  way,  it \ncomplements and reinforces ADB\u2019s sector loan programs and projects, which are aligned with \nthe  Government\u2019s  strategies  (para.  6).  For  example,  under  the  first  pillar,  macroeconomic \nstability, the Local Government Financing and Budget Reform Program finances budget reforms \nand financing for local government units (LGUs) supported by TA.6 This complements the DPSP, \nwhich focuses on the national government budget. Similarly, the Governance in Justice Reform \nProgram  is  supporting  better  public  financial  management  systems  to  the  justice  sector.7 TA \nprojects on national tax administration and public financial management are building capacity in \nthese areas, including (i) capacity development support for the restructured Bureau of Internal \nRevenue  (BIR)  Enforcement  and  Advisory  Service  (EAS)  for  tax  prosecutions,  and  (ii)  piloting \ninternal control systems within national government agencies, LGUs, and the Supreme Court.8 \nUnder the second pillar, the investment climate, ADB\u2019s strategic focus has been on the energy \n\n                                                 \n5   ADB. 2005.

The Power Sector Development Program loan has deepened the market for energy, \nwith the establishment of a wholesale energy market and led to the privatization of 70% of the \nNational  Power  Corporation\u2019s  energy  assets  by  the  end  of  2008. 9 The  Infrastructure  for  Rural \nProductivity  Enhancement  Sector  Project  supports  infrastructure  development  in  the  southern \nPhilippines and is expected to construct 800\u20131,000 km of rural feeder roads, 5,000 hectares of \ncommon  irrigation,  and  about  100  portable  water  systems.10   In  addition,  ADB  has  continuing \noperations  in  the  urban,  rural,  and  water  sectors  such  as  coastal  fisheries  and  resource \nmanagement, agrarian reform, and infrastructure; these have had a positive affect on the rural \ninvestment climate and poverty reduction.11 Under the third pillar of the social sectors, ADB has \nadopted  innovative  approaches  to  assistance  in  the  health 12  and  education 13  sectors  with \nobjectives that are consistent with the Government\u2019s MDGs and targets.  \n \n9. \nMedium-Term  Programmatic  Approach.  The  key  features  of  the  DPSP  include:  \n(i) three single-tranche operations, with a well-defined, medium-term framework specified at the \noutset and including completed high-impact reforms; (ii) triggers for subsequent subprograms to \nthe  Government,  development  partners,  and \nensure  a  continuous  dialogue  between \nstakeholders; and (iii) a small number of well-targeted policy actions designed to achieve high-\nimpact  outcomes  in  priority  sectors.  In  this  way,  the  DPSP  provides  a  coherent  medium-term \nreform  strategy  with  three  discrete  but  linked  subprograms  and  a  strong  emphasis  on \nperformance, as the decision on whether to proceed with the next subprogram is contingent on \ntriggers that reflect overall satisfactory performance. It recognizes the necessity for flexibility in \nthe  reform  measures,  with  provisions  for  incorporating  lessons  and  responding  to  changes  in \nthe external environment in the design of downstream subprograms. \n  \n10. \n\nThe DPSP has the four phases: \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nSubprogram  1.  Financed  by  ADB  ($250  million)  in  2007,  this  supported  the \nGovernment\u2019s  fiscal  consolidation  program,  creating  the  basis  for  continuous \npolicy dialogue and engagement during 2007\u20132009 (footnote 1). \nSubprogram  2.  Financed by ADB ($250 million) with parallel financing from the \nGovernment  of  Japan  ($100  million),  this  supported  the  Government's  fiscal \nsustainability  program  and  efforts  to  strengthen  governance  in  public  financial \nmanagement  and procurement.14 \nSubprogram  3.  The  present  phase,  to  be  financed  by  ADB  ($250  million)  with \nparallel  financing  from  the  Government  of  Japan,  increases  the  focus  on \ninstitutionalizing  governance  programs,  including  the  anticorruption  revenue \nprograms  at  the  Bureau  of  Internal  Revenue  (BIR)  and  the  Bureau  of  Customs \n(BOC), the investment climate, and the social sectors.  \n\n                                                 \n9   ADB.  2006.

In  response  to  the  global  economic  crisis,  an \ninnovation  added  at  the  subprogram  3  phase  is  a  post-program  monitoring \nframework.  The  Government  of  the  Philippines,  ADB,  and  the  Government  of \nJapan  have  agreed  to  establish  a  post-DPSP  framework  for  a  period  of  12 \nmonths, creating the basis for continuous policy dialogue and engagement during \nthe critical period 2009\u20132010 before the Philippine presidential elections in May \n2010.  The  monitoring  framework  focuses  on  the  Government's  short-term  plan \nfor  advancing  its  reforms  in  fiscal  policy,  public  financial  management,  and \nselected  areas  in  investment  climate  and  poverty,  supported  by  ADB,  the \nGovernment  of  Japan,  and  other  development  partners'  technical  and  program \nassistance.   \n\n \nGovernment  and  development  partner  coordination.  The  DPSP  is  a  joint  effort  of \n11. \nADB,  the  Government  of  Japan  (Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency),  and  other \ndevelopment partners to support and deepen a common reform agenda with the Government. It \nreflects  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  its  reforms  over  the  medium  term,  and  ADB\u2019s \ncommitment to provide financial support for program implementation over the same period. The \nGovernment of Japan provided parallel cofinancing of $100 million for subprogram 2 in March \n2009  and  will  provide  parallel  cofinancing  of  $100  million\u2013$150  million  for  subprogram  3.15 In \nformulating the DPSP, the Government, ADB, and the Government of Japan have drawn on the \nGovernment\u2019s  agenda  as  articulated  through  the  PDF  and  its  sector  strategies.  ADB  and  the \nGovernment  of  Japan  have  coordinated  reviews  of  subprogram  3  policy  triggers  with  the \nGovernment. The formulation of subprogram 3 benefited from input from the Australian Agency \nfor \nInternational \nDevelopment (USAID), and the World Bank. The World Bank is at an early stage of discussion \nwith the Government on a possible development policy loan program to mitigate the impact of \nthe  crisis  and  support  the  Government's  second-round  fiscal  stimulus  program  in  2010.  The \nWB's DPL will partly draw from and build on subprogram 3 of the DPSP.   This would follow on \nfrom  the  World  Bank's  proposed  social  welfare  development  reform  project  that  provides \nearmarked budget support to the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) and \nits single-tranche food crisis response program loan approved by its Board in December 2008 \nand disbursed in 2009.16 Appendix 3 provides the development partner coordination matrix.  \n \n\nthe  United  States  Agency \n\nInternational  Development \n\n(AusAID), \n\nfor \n\nIII. \n\nTHE SECTOR  \n\nA. \n\nRecent Economic Developments and the Impacts of the Global Financial Crisis \n\nin  2008.  Until  September  2008, \n\nResilient  macroeconomic  performance \n\n12. \nthe \nPhilippines  was  able  to  withstand  the  negative  impacts  of  the  global  crisis  because  of  the \nGovernment's  sound  macroeconomic  and  fiscal  policy,  a  more  resilient  financial  sector,  and \nadequate  levels  of  foreign  reserves  (Table  1).  Economic  growth  was  3.8%  above  the  regional \naverage (Figure 1). The current balance of payments account recorded a respectable surplus of \n$4.2  billion  (2.5%  of  GDP)  for  2008,  buoyed  by  record  remittances  of  $16.4  billion.  However, \nsignificant  portfolio  capital  outflow  in  the  third  and  fourth  quarters  of  2008  reduced  the  overall \nbalance of payments position from a solid $8.5 billion surplus in 2007 to an $89 million surplus \nin 2008. Inflation has continued to fall since its peak in September 2008 and by July 2009 the \n                                                 \n15  ADB and the Government of Japan (Japan International Cooperation Agency) signed a procedural agreement on \n18  May  2009  formalizing  the  parallel  cofinancing  arrangement  for  Development  Policy  Support  Program, \nSubprogram 2. The procedural agreement was also acknowledged by the finance secretary of the Department of \nFinance.  \n\n16 World Bank. 2008. Food Crisis Response Development Policy Operation.

The Government's overall deficit was P68 billion in 2008 (0.9% of GDP), the third \nconsecutive year that the national government budget deficit was below 1% of GDP (Figure 3a). \nThe  consolidated  public  sector  budget,  which  includes  balances  of  government-owned  and \ncontrolled  corporations  (GOCCs)  and  LGUs,  remained  in  surplus  for  a  third  consecutive  year, \nsurpassing the medium-term target of a balanced consolidated public sector budget in 2010. As \na  consequence,  the  national  government  debt  to  GDP  ratio  remained  relatively  stable  at  56% \n(60% for nonfinancial sector public debt).  \n \n13. \nThe  global  crisis  and  its  impact  on  the  Philippine  economy.  Like  many  other \ndeveloping economies, the Philippines has had to cope with the first-round effects of the turmoil \nand a crisis of confidence that has disrupted the global financial system since September 2008. \nPhilippine financial markets were significantly affected by capital flight in the second half of 2008 \nand  the  global  credit  crunch  has  made  it  more  expensive  for  the  Philippine  public  and  private \nsectors  to  access  international  debt  markets  (Appendix  4).  However,  the  major  impact  on  the \nPhilippine economy is the second-round effects of the collapse in global demand and its fiscal \nrepercussions. The condition of the global economy deteriorated markedly in the fourth quarter \nof 2008 and new economic data on the global economy released in March 2009 confirm a much \ndeeper,  broader  and  protracted  recession  in  several  of  the  Philippines\u2019  major  trading  partners \nnot seen since World War II.  The Philippine economy contracted by 2.3% in the first quarter of \n2009  on  a  quarter-on-quarter  basis  (adjusted  for  seasonal  effects),  as  external  demand  for \nexports plunged (Figure 1, b\u2013d). Tourist arrivals have fallen heavily, dropping 15% at the end of \nDecember 2008 on a year-on-year basis. Remittances have held up much better than trade in \ngoods and other services, but growth has virtually stalled with 2.9% growth in the first semester \nof  2009  compared  with  15%  growth  for  the  same  period  in  2008.  ADB  staff  estimate  that \nremittances  could  fall  by  2%\u20134%  in  the  second  half  of  2009,  based  on  the  experience  of  the \n1997\u20131998  Asian  financial  crisis  when  remittances  to  the  Philippines  from  overseas  Filipino \nworkers residing in Singapore and Hong Kong declined by an average of 7% when these two \neconomies experienced recessionary conditions. \n \nAgainst  this  background,  the  Government  has  revised  its  macroeconomic  framework \n14. \nand  projects  growth  at  0.8%\u20131.8%  in  2009,  with  higher  unemployment  and  poverty.  Further \nrevisions downward are expected. Development partners project a growth rate in the range of  \n\u20131.0%  to  1.0%  in  2009  on  the  back  of  faltering  exports,  stalling  foreign  investments,  and  a \nprojected drop in remittances. These projections would translate to a per capita income decline \nin the range of \u20133.0%  to \u20131.0% and a probable increase in poverty.  \n \n15. \nRepercussions  of  the  crisis  on  fiscal  policy. The global financial crisis has affected \nfiscal policy in three ways. First, the contraction in the economy means that it is necessary for \nthe  Government  to  provide  a  modest  stimulus  in  2009,  while  maintaining  fiscal  discipline. \nSecond, the contraction in the economy in the first quarter of 2009 has resulted in a decline in \ntax  collections.  As  a  result  of  the  increased  spending  and  projected  decline  in  revenues,  the \nGovernment  projects  the  deficit  to  rise  to  3.2%  of  GDP  in  2009.  Third,  tight  liquidity  in  global \ncredit markets and elevated risks have raised the cost of financing the budget and refinancing \npublic debt. While spreads have started to fall in recent months toward pre-crisis levels, global \nmarkets remain fragile and at the end of June 2009 spreads on Philippine international bonds \nincreased again from an average spread of 270 bps in early June 2009 to 320 bps by the end of \nthe same month (Appendix 9).  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\n32.6 \n8.0 \n6.2 \n4.3 \n22.1 \n6.7 \n\n33.6 \n7.3 \n2.8 \n3.9 \n10.7 \n8.5 \n\n32.3 \n7.7 \n7.7 \n6.7 \n9.8 \n (0.3) \n\n31.6 \n     \u2014 \n6.0 \n8.6 \n10.0 \n4.9 \n\n2007 \n7.1 \n10.9 \n13.0 \n29.2 \n4.5 \n14.4 \n\n2008 \n3.8 \n2.9 \n8.2 \n(0.4) \n1.9 \n16.4 \n\n30.6 \n       \u2014 \n3.5 \n3.9 \n4.2. \n1.9 \n\n2004 \n6.4 \n1.3 \n4.8 \n   (9.3) \n3.2 \n8.6 \n\n2003 \n4.9 \n3.8 \n6.8 \n   (11.3) \n9.2 \n7.6 \n\n2006 \n5.3 \n3.9 \n (3.7) \n31.4 \n       1.3 \n12.8 \n\nTable 1: Key Macroeconomic Indicators in the Philippines   \n(% of GDP, unless otherwise indicated) \n2005 \n5.0 \n (6.6) \n (1.1) \n (18.0) \n (7.1) \n10.7 \n\nIndicator  \nReal GDP growth (%) \n   Fixed capital investment growth (% change) \n   Private construction (% change) \n   Public construction (% change) \n   Durable equipment (% change) \nWorkers\u2019 remittances ($ billion) \nTotal employment (millions of persons, average \nof period) \nUnemployment rate (%, average of period)a \nAnnual inflation (%, average of period) \nAnnual inflation (%, yearend) \nM2 growth (% growth, year end) \nCredit to the private sector (net, % change) \nInterest rate (91-day treasury bill, secondary \n8.4 \nmarket, end period in %) \n63.1 \nExternal debt \n18.6 \nDebt service ratio (% of exports) \n1.9 \nCurrent account balance  \n16.3 \nGross official reserves ($ billion) \n \n \n \nPublic finances \nConsolidated public sector budget balanceb \n     (4.8) \nNational government budget balancec \n     (3.8) \n \n \nRevenues and grantsd \n20.5 \n12.4 \n  National government tax revenues \nExpenditurese \n25.5 \n18.3 \n  National government expenditures \n2.7 \n      Capital outlays \n5.4 \n      Interest payments \n95.2 \nNonfinancial public sector debt \n78.2 \nNational government debt \nGross reserves as % of short-term liabilitiesf \n125.8 \n( ) = negative, \u2014 = no data available, GDP = gross domestic product.  \na  Open unemployment rate measures the number of people out of work and looking for work.

Until  mid-2008,  the  sustained  economic \nexpansion was beginning to improve the Philippines' stubbornly high unemployment rate for the \nfirst time in a decade. Lower long-term economic growth coupled with relatively restrictive labor \nregulations meant longer-term unemployment in the Philippines was higher than in its regional \nneighbors. In 2007, the unemployment rate fell to an average of 7.3% from 7.9% in 2006. The \nlatest data for April 2009 indicate an increase in the average unemployment rate to 7.6%. The \nGovernment is deeply concerned that the current global financial crisis will reverse its efforts to \nreduce  unemployment  and  therefore  poverty  and  that  it  will  lead  to  a  significant  reduction  in \neconomic growth, retrenchments, domestic employment opportunities, and returns of overseas \nFilipino workers made redundant in recession-hit countries. Recent retrenchment data from the \nDepartment of Labor and Employment point to tens of thousands of layoffs, particularly in export \nindustries  and  urban  centers.  An  ADB  household  survey  in  February  2009  reported  elevated \nfeelings of job insecurity among workers with 20% of employed workers feeling they may not be \nin their current job within the next 12 months, of which one-fifth of these workers (or 4% of total \nworkers surveyed) expect to lose their jobs because of the performance of the economy (Figure \n2).17 Sixty percent of employed workers expect it to be more difficult to find a new or better job in \n2009 than in 2008. The initial impact of job and income losses will probably occur in the major \nurban  industrial  centers  and  among  the  nonpoor  and  near-poor  since  wage  workers  are \nconcentrated among these groups of households. However, multiplier effects and a potential fall \nin remittances mean the impacts of the crisis will be broader and the incidence of poverty and its \nseverity will rise.  \n \nGovernment\u2019s policy response. The Government's response has been twofold. First, it \n17. \ntook  a  number  of  preemptive  measures  to  increase  liquidity  in  the  domestic  bank  system, \nproviding  depositors  with  assurance  and  strengthening  the  BSP's  lender  of  last  resort  facility. \nSecond, it provided a modest fiscal stimulus in the national government budget for 2009 (para. \n16). In the financial sector, the key measures include the following: (i) the BSP strengthened its \nlender  of  last  resort  facility  by  increasing  its  budget  for  the  peso  rediscounting  facility  from \nP20 billion to P40 billion on 14 November 2008, and opened a dollar repo facility on 20 October \n2008 to ensure dollar liquidity with the banks\u2019 dollar-denominated Philippine sovereign bonds as \nunderlying collateral; (ii) the BSP increased liquidity in the banking system by easing monetary \n\n                                                 \n17 ADB.

These measures have improved the key indicators of banking sector soundness and \nfinancial sector stability since December 2008 (Appendix 4).  \n \nB. \n\nIssues and Opportunities  \n\n1. \n\nFiscal Sustainability and Macroeconomic Stability \n\n18. \nFiscal  program.  In  mid-2008,  the  Government  decided,  and  its  development  partners \nconcurred,  that  the  balanced  budget  target  date  should  be  pushed  back  to  2010  to  provide \nflexibility  in  fiscal  policy  in  2008  and  2009  for  programs  to  mitigate  the  impact  of  increases  in \nfood prices on the poor and to maintain priority spending programs if the economy slowed down. \nThe Government targeted a deficit of no more  than 1% of GDP in 2008, 0.5% in 2009, and a \nbalanced  budget  in  2010.  However,  with  the  severe  contraction  in  global  demand  since \nSeptember  2008  and  the  recognition  by  the  Government  and  its  development  partners  that  a \nlarger fiscal expansion is needed, the Government has revised its medium-term fiscal program. \nIt  plans  an  increase  in  the  national government  budget  deficit  to  3.2% of  GDP  in  2009,  2%  in \n2010, and a balanced budget by 2013. The 2009 national government budget deficit translates \nto  an  actual  fiscal  expansion  of  up  to  2.3%  of  GDP  over  2008  levels, 18  low  by  regional \nstandards.19 It covers less than one-half of the expected negative output gap in 2009 (i.e., the \ngap between potential and actual economic growth, Figure 3). In the current global environment, \nthe Government faces challenges to its fiscal program in both the short and medium terms. In \nthe  short  term,  the  Government  needs  to  ensure  that  its  fiscal  expansion  in  2009  provides  an \neffective  stimulus  to  the  economy.  This  will  mean  ensuring  that  the  stimulus  is  timely,  well \ntargeted, temporary, and transparent. In this regard, a key challenge will be to maintain critical \npublic  spending  and  to  speed  up  disbursements  for  infrastructure  spending  in  the  key \nprocurement  agencies.  Measures  should  focus  on  lifting  the  relatively  low  absorptive  capacity \nrates  of  key  spending  agencies,  better  cash  management,  advancing  the  infrastructure \nprocurement  process,  and  scaling  up  targeted  social  assistance  and  employment  programs. \nWith tax collections falling in the first quarter of 2009, the added challenge for the Government \nwill  be  to  ensure  predictability  in  its  gross  financing  needs  for  2009.  In  the  medium  term,  the \nGovernment  needs  to  ensure  it  sustains  revenue  sustainability  to  fund  priority  programs  and \nlonger-term  debt  sustainability.  The  crisis  also  provides  an  opportunity  for  the  Government  to \nrevisit its balanced budget objective and to explore the feasibility of alternative fiscal rules that \ncould anchor fiscal policy (Appendix 4).  \n\n                                                 \n18 A fiscal expansion is defined as the change in the national government primary budget balance between 2 years.  \n19 ADB staff estimates of fiscal expansions in Southeast Asia: Cambodia (1.8% of GDP), Indonesia (2.4% of GDP); \n\nThailand (4.1% of GDP); and Viet Nam (3.8% of GDP). \n\n \n\n\f90\n\n80\n\n70\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\nP\nD\nG\n\n \n\n%\n\n \nt\n\nb\ne\nD\n\n \n\nG\nN\n\nP\nD\nG\n\n \n\n%\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-3\n\n-4\n\n-5\n\n \n\n11\n\n     (a) National Government Deficit and Debt to GDP              (b) Output Gap and Fiscal Stance \n           (1996\u20132008)                                                                         (2003\u20132010) \n\nFigure 3: Fiscal Performance \n\nFiscal expansion\n\nNG Deficit  (LHS)\n\nNG Debt (RHS)\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n \n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\nP\nD\nG\n\n \n\n%\n\n \nt\ni\n\nc\n\ni\nf\n\ne\nD\n\n1\n9\n9\n5\n\n1\n9\n9\n6\n\n1\n9\n9\n7\n\n1\n9\n9\n8\n\n1\n9\n9\n9\n\n2\n0\n0\n0\n\n2\n0\n0\n1\n\n2\n0\n0\n2\n\n2\n0\n0\n3\n\n2\n0\n0\n4\n\n2\n0\n0\n5\n\n2\n0\n0\n6\n\n2\n0\n0\n7\n\n2\n0\n0\n8\n\n-1\n\nfiscal consolidation period\n\nNG Deficit\n\nNG Debt\n\nOutput Gap\n\nFiscal Stance\n\nFiscal contraction\n\nGDP = gross domestic product, LHS = left hand side, NG = national government, RHS = right hand side. \nNote:  Fiscal  stance  calculated  as  the  percentage  point  change  in  the  primary  budget  deficit  to  GDP  between  two \nyears.

In Figure 3(b) \nit is apparent the Government has been operating a fiscal contraction during the period of consolidation from 2003 to \n2007. A small fiscal expansion occurred in 2008.

Substantial  improvements  in  collections  were  made  in  some  taxes: \ncorporate income tax collection increased by 18.3% over 2007 levels and excise tax collections \non  tobacco  products  were  also  better  by  18.8%.  Value-added  collections  under  the  BIR's \njurisdiction fell by 3.2% over 2007 levels. Poor compliance with value-added tax (VAT) appears \nto occur in the services sector, especially in retail and trade, which comprise a large number of \nsmaller taxpayers. Continued weak tax administration and inefficiencies in the tax policy indicate \nthat the BIR has been unable to lift VAT collections through improvements in tax efficiency and \nenforcement.  The  prevalence  of  VAT  exemptions  (resulting  in  breaks  in  the  VAT  chain  and \nthereby  weaker  self-compliance),  and  generous  taxable  income  deductions  in  the  growth \nsectors of the economy continue to limit growth-induced tax collection. In the first semester of \n2009, tax collection fell by 5.2% over levels in the same period in 2008, reflecting the economic \ncontraction in the Philippines. Customs collections fell 8.3% (VAT on imported goods fell 12.9%) \nand the BIR's collections fell by 5.1% on a year-on-year basis. ADB assessments indicate that \ntax  revenues  in  the  Philippines  have  historically  exhibited  a  systematic,  moderate  procyclical \npattern,  i.e.,  during  periods  of  fast  economic  growth  direct  and  indirect  taxes  grow  faster  than \nnominal GDP, and during sharp slowdowns, taxes fall faster than nominal GDP. ADB estimates \nthat,  based  on  a  low-growth  scenario  for  2009  and  2010,  the  tax  to  GDP  ratio  will  decline  for \n2009 and some of the decline will carry over into 2010 (Appendix 4).   \n\n     \n\n \n\n\f \n  \n \n     (a) Tax Collection \n           (Quarterly growth, year-on-year)                                           (% growth change in 2008 over 2007) \n\nFigure 4: Bureau of Internal Revenue Tax Collection \n \n\n(b) Tax Collection by Major BIR Tax Category \n\n                         \n\n \n\n \n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n-10\n\n \n\nQ\n\nQ\n\nQ\n\nQ\n\nQ\n\nQ\n\nQ\n\nQ\n\nQ\n\nQ\n\nQ\n\nQ\n\nQ\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n1\n\n \n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n6\n\n \n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n7\n\n \n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n8\n\n \n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n9\n\ni\n\nn\n\nC\n\nc\no\nm\ne\n\n \nt\na\n\nx\n\no\n\nr\np\n\no\n\nr\na\n\nt\ne\n\ni\n\nn\n\nc\no\nm\ne\n\n \nt\na\n\nI\n\nn\n\nd\n\ni\n\nv\n\ni\n\nd\n\nu\n\na\n\nx\n\nl\n\nD\n\ne\n\np\n\no\n\ns\n\ni\nt\ns\n\nB\na\n\nn\n\nk\n\n(\nt\n\no\n\nb\n\na\n\nc\nc\no\n\n)\n\nE\nx\nc\n\ni\n\ns\ne\n\n \nt\na\n\nx\n\n(\no\n\nt\nh\n\ne\n\nr\n)\n\nE\nx\nc\n\ni\n\ns\ne\n\n \nt\na\n\nx\n\na\n\nd\n\nd\n\ne\n\nd\n\n \nt\na\n\nx\n\nV\na\n\nl\n\nu\n\ne\n\nt\na\n\nx\n\nP\ne\n\nr\nc\ne\n\nn\n\nt\na\n\ng\n\ne\n\nO\n\nt\n\nh\n\ne\n\nr\n \nt\na\n\nx\ne\n\ns\n\nA\n\nl\n\nl\n\n \n\nBIR = Bureau of Internal Revenue. \nSources: Bureau of Treasury, Department of Finance. http://www.treasury.gov.ph. \n\n \nSustaining  priority  spending. The Government is targeting an increase in the rate of \n20. \nnoninterest expenditure to GDP from 12.2% in 2006 to 14% by 2010. Ensuring priority spending \nis  sustainable  within  the  budget  framework  over  the  medium  term  will  require  further  effort  to \nraise  tax  revenues.  This  remains  a  long-term  challenge  for  the  Government.  Its  approach  is \nthreefold: (i) to implement its tax administration reforms; (ii) to enhance and institutionalize the \nanticorruption initiatives in the BIR and the BOC; and (iii) to improve tax policies. The BIR has a \ncomprehensive  tax  administration  reform  program  up  to  2010,  but  implementation  has  been \ndelayed  and  is  proceeding  more  slowly  than  initially  expected.  This  is  partly  due  to  the \ncomplexity of the reform program and the fact that the BIR\u2019s budgetary resources for long-term \nreforms have been critically constrained. Staff resistance, vested interests, and corruption have \nalso  contributed  to  the  slow  start  to  reform  as  it  is  rolled  out  to  the  regional  tax  offices.  The \nGovernment  must  address  longer-term  resource  constraints  at  the  BIR,  including  raising  its \npersonnel  budget.  Gradual  and  incremental  reforms  have  been  made  to  tax  administration.  A \ndraft bill has been submitted to Congress to allow the BIR to set salaries for its staff closer to \nmarket  values.  Through  the  2009  national  government  budget,  the  DBM  has  allocated  an \nadditional P1.0 billion in funds to the BIR to hire up to 3,000 new technical staff nationwide. The \nBIR  has  made  it a  priority  to  institutionalize  its  anticorruption  revenue  program,  Run  After  Tax \nEvaders  (RATE),  as  lessons  from  subprogram  2  of  the  DPSP  indicate  that  it  is  necessary  to \ninstitutionalize these initiatives within the agencies to ensure they are sustainable and constitute \nan effective deterrent to tax evasion. ADB is providing TA to the BIR, the Department of Finance \n(DOF), and the Department of Justice to strengthen revenue-enhancing measures, enforcement, \nand prosecution of tax evaders. \n \n21. \nSeveral  tax  policies  have  weaknesses  in  design  and  structure  that  limit  tax  revenue \ngrowth.  Under  the  2005  amendments  to  excise  tax  legislation,  the  DOF  has  been  delegated \nauthority to raise specific taxes until 2011. It raised excise tax on tobacco and alcohol in 2007 \nand again in January 2009. However, the excise tax legislation has too many bands that allow \n\n \n\n12 \n \n\n \n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n-10\n\n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nproducers to minimize tax liabilities and it is not indexed to inflation. At the end of 2007, the DOF \nsubmitted  to  Congress  a  revised  investment  incentives  bill.  Deliberations  have  progressed  in \nCongress  but  have  recently  slowed  with  the  upcoming  presidential  elections  next  year.  The \nGovernment  will  need  to  issue  implementing  rules  and  regulations  to  rationalize  investment \nincentives  once  Congress  passes  the  bill.  However,  tax  exemption  legislation  initiated  by \nCongress has also eroded the tax base.   \n \n22. \nDebt  management.  Improvements  made  in  public  debt  management  since  2005 have \nresulted  in  significant  fiscal  savings.  Overall,  debt  interest  costs  in  the  national  government \nbudget have fallen from 36.7% of total national government revenues in 2005 to 22.6% in 2008, \nfreeing up substantial resources for priority programs. This was partly because of specific debt \nmanagement  measures,  such  as  lengthening  the  average  maturity  of  government  debt  to  7.1 \nyears  and  maintaining  a  diverse  portfolio  of  obligations  within  a  disciplined  fiscal  program. \nNevertheless, public debt at 56.0% of GDP and debt servicing costs (interest and amortization) \nat  about  8.0%  of  GDP  are  relatively  high  by  developing  country  standards.  Much  needs  to be \ndone to improve the institutional framework for debt management. Debt management systems \nat  the  DOF  are  compartmentalized  with  separate  units  in  the  Bureau  of  Treasury,  Corporate \nAffairs  (covering  contingent  liabilities  of  government-owned  and  controlled  corporations  and \nothers),  and  the  International  Finance  Group  (covering  official  development  assistance  and \ninternational  commercial  borrowings).  Monitoring  of  contingent  liabilities  under  the  Build\u2013\noperate\u2013transfer law is done through the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) \ninvestment  coordination  committee  (ICC).  Consequently,  debt  management  is  not  conducted \nwithin an integrated debt framework as suggested by best international practice. A medium-term \ndebt management and risk strategy and policies are needed.  \n \n\n2. \n\nGovernance in Public Financial Management  \n\n23. \nPublic  financial  management.  Implementing  improved  systems  for  public  financial \nmanagement,  including  the  medium-term  expenditure  framework  (MTEF),  and  aligning  the \nbudget  planning  process  with  strategic  objectives  and  priorities  is  integral  to  improving  public \nfinancial  management  efficiency,  and  therefore  sustainable  priority  spending.  Progress \ncontinues  to  be  made.  The  DBM  continues  to  increase  the  use  of  the  MTEF  in  preparing  the \n2009 and 2010 budgets, including preparing budget strategy papers and disseminating forward \nestimates  for  3  years  with  the  increasing  involvement  of  all  22  departments  in  formulating  the \nforward  estimates.  In  2007,  the  organizational  performance  indicator  framework  (OPIF)  that \nlinks  budget  allocations  to  management  performance  indicators  was  rolled  out  to  all  national \ngovernment  line  departments,  four  constitutional  offices,  and  state  colleges  and  universities. \nThe  DBM  has  started  to  pilot  internal  control  systems  in  selected  line  ministries.  The \nGovernment,  ADB,  and  other  development  partners  have  identified  several  core  areas  to  be \naddressed, beginning with budget preparation through to budget execution and reporting, which \nwill require a much longer-term, coordinated effort in capacity development (paras. 24\u201328).  \n  \n24. \nBudget  preparation  and  credibility.  A  multiyear  perspective  in  fiscal  planning  and \nbudgeting  needs  to  be  strengthened.  Key  to  this  is  completing  the  rollout  of  the  MTEF  to  line \nministries and continuing to involve them in computing the forward estimates needed to ensure \nthe  MTEF  is  institutionalized  within  the  Government.  While  much  progress  has  been  made  in \nthis area, more needs to be done. In particular, currently the DBM sets forward estimates at a \ndisaggregated level of spending, which tends to create rigidities in resource allocation within a \ndepartment. Over the longer term, the DBM should set the forward estimates for the budget of \nthe  department  and  provide  the  department  with  flexibility  to  determine  resource  allocation \nacross  priorities.  Often  in-year  reallocations  of  the  approved  budget  between  line  agencies \n\n \n\n\f \n\n14 \n \n\n \n\nundermine the credibility of the budget composition, defined as the extent to which the budget is \nrealistic and is implemented as intended. Public access to key fiscal information in the budget \ndocuments  needs  to  be  improved,  including  presentation  of  budget  documents  for  public \nconsumption.  Finally,  revenue  forecasts  for  budget  preparation  are  often  ambitious,  in  part \nbecause  of  weaknesses  in  forecasting  capabilities  at  DOF  and  its  revenue  agencies.  The \nbudget presentation is not accompanied by debt risk and sustainability assessments. \n \n25. \nBudget  execution  and  controls.  There  are  weaknesses  in  the  recording  and \nmanagement  of  cash  balances,  as  having  more  than  one  treasury  account  makes  reconciling \nbalances  difficult.  The  monthly  (and  even  daily)  cash  forecasting  capabilities  of  the  Bureau  of \nTreasury  need  to  be  strengthened  to  improve  the  predictability  of  the  availability  of  funds  for \nexpenditures  during  the  budget  cycle.  The  DBM  retains  excessive  controls  over  spending \ncommitments  and  cash  disbursements  and  the  practice  of  quarterly  cash  releases  (instead  of \nsemiannual) elevates the unpredictability of funding and leads to excessive agency \u201csavings\u201d at \nthe end of the year. The central departments have limited authority over the spending agencies \nunder them. Current reporting arrangements make it difficult to reconcile the budget allocation \nreleases  and  the  actual  expenditures  incurred  by  agencies  because  of  differences  in  the \naccounting  formats  used  by  the  DBM  and  the  chart  of  accounts  used  by  the  Commission  of \nAudit (COA). \n \n  \n  (a) Absorptive Capacity Rates \n                         \n       (ratio of total obligation to total allotment)                                  (ratio of disbursements to cash releases) \n\nFigure 5: Public Financial Performance Indicators \n\n(b) Utilization Ratio  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n100\n\n90\n\n80\n\n70\n\n60\n\n50\n\nDPWH\n\nDOTC\n\nDA\n\nDepEd\n\nAll NG\n\nDPWH\n\nDOTC\n\nDA\n\nDepEd\n\nAll NG\n\n     \n\n \nDA  =  Department  of  Agriculture,  DepEd  =  Department  of  Education,  DOTC  =  Department  of  Transportation  and \nCommunications, DPWH = Department of Public Works and Highways, All NG = average for all national government \ndepartments and agencies. \nSource: Department of Budget and Management. \n \nThese  weaknesses  in  budget  execution  are  reflected  in  the  poor  performance  of  key \n26. \npublic  financial  management  indicators,  such  as  the  low  absorptive  capacity  rates  of  key \nspending  agencies,  including  the  Department  of  Agriculture,  the  Department  of  Public  Works \nand  Highways  (DPWH),  the  Department  of  Transportation  and  Communications,  and  the \nDepartment  of  Education  (DepEd)\u2014Figure  5.  Given  the  Government  plans  to  stimulate  the \neconomy through timely, well-targeted and transparent programs, it will be important to lift these \nrates.  One  area  where  substantial  progress  has  been  made  is  procurement  reforms.  The \nGovernment  Procurement  Policy  Board  (GPPB)  continues  to  make  substantial  progress  in \nimplementing  the  Government  Procurement  Reform  Act,  2003  and  its  3-year  action  plan  to \nstrengthen \nframework,  capacity  building  of  procurement  officers,  and \nenforcement  of  the  law,  including  the  expansion  of  the  Philippine  government  electronic \n\ninstitutional \n\nthe \n\n100\n\n90\n\n80\n\n70\n\n60\n\n50\n\n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nprocurement  system  (PhilGEPS),  which  is  aimed  at  raising  transparency  and  enhancing \ncompetition in procurement.  \n \n27. \nInternal  controls  system. Internal control and audit systems in spending agencies are \nan  essential  element  of  budget  execution  and  financial  reporting.  Internal  control  provides \nreasonable  assurance  that  the  systems,  rules,  and  procedures  of  the  organization  will  help \nachieve efficiency of operations, reliability in financial reporting, and compliance with applicable \nregulations.  Internal  audit  is  an  independent,  objective  activity  designed  to  add  value  and \nimprove  an  organization\u2019s  operations.  There  are  weaknesses  in  payroll  controls,  internal \ncontrols  for  nonsalary  expenditures,  and  the  lack  of  independent  internal  audits  within  line \nministries.  Until  recently,  there  were  no  generic  guidelines  for  internal  control  systems  for  line \nagencies to follow and not all agencies have established independent internal audit units.  \n \n28. \nBudget  accounting,  recording,  and  reporting.  Accounts  reconciliation  and  in-year \nbudget reports on obligations, cash releases and allotments, obligations, and disbursements are \nnot  done  on  time,  and  thus  do  not  track  progress  against  indicators  of  budget  efficiency \neffectively.  The  key  underlying  cause  of  weaknesses  in  budget  execution,  recording,  and \nreporting is the absence of an integrated government financial management information system \n(GFMIS). The current manual recording of accounts payable results in frequent reporting delays \nfrom line ministries and regions to DBM. The Government is developing the initial components \nof  a  GFMIS,  including  the  eBudget  (electronic  releasing  and  programming  of  the  budget), \neNGAS (electronic national accounting system), and PhilGEPS (electronic procurement system), \nbut these are fragmented and, except for the PhilGEPS, coverage is low. The Government pilot-\ntested the e-Budget system in the first quarter of 2008 before the rollout to regional offices. It will \nbe  important  for  key  agencies  of  COA,  DBM,  and  DOF  to  establish  a  consensus  on  the  way \nforward  for  integrating  the  fragmented  GFMIS.  This  will  require  a  formal  coordinated  effort  by \nkey  government  agencies  with  longer-term  support  from  development  partners.  The  DBM  has \nundertaken  a  study  of  government  financial  information  systems  and  has  begun  consultations \nwith  departments  and  stakeholders  on  ways  to  integrate  them.  Completing  the  design  and \ndevelopment  of  the  GFMIS  over  the  medium  term  will  be  important  to  enhance  the  efficiency \nand effectiveness of services and to improve transparency. ADB technical assistance is being \nprovided to the DBM to support it to develop a GFMIS road map with clear targets. Monitoring \nthis reform is included in the post-program monitoring framework (para. 51). \n \n\n3. \n\nInvestment Climate \n\nInvestment  growth.  The  investment  expansion  that  began  in  2007  continued \n29. \nthroughout  the  first  half  of  2008  with  private  construction  growing  by  20%  and  durable \nequipment  and  machinery  expanding  by  6%  on  a  year-on-year  basis.  Total  fixed  investment \nslowed to 4.3% in the second half of the year. Overall, the investment\u2013GDP ratio has increased \nfrom 14.0% of GDP in 2006 to 15.0% in 2008. Private investment has stagnated in 2009. The \nGovernment  has  increased  public  spending  on  infrastructure  this  year  and  this  should  lift  the \ninvestment rate. However, ADB staff estimates suggest the Philippines is underinvesting by as \nmuch 5 percentage points of GDP and much needs to be done to put it on a sustainable growth \npath,  such  as  improving  the  business  regulatory  climate,  trade  facilitation,  and  establishing  a \ntransparent public\u2013private infrastructure investment policy framework.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n16 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n8\n\n7\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\nFigure 6: Investor Perceptions on the Philippine Investment Climate \n(average rating score) \n\n(a) Most Important Decision Factors to Investors            (b) Investors' Rating of the Philippines Compared to    \n     (1 is least important, 10 is most important)                       Neighboring Economies   (\u20135 is worst, 5 is best) \n\nAbove average\n\n1.5\n\n0.5\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-0.5\n\n-1\n\n-1.5\n\n-2\n\n-2.5\nBelow average\n\n   \n\ns\nt\n\na\nb\n\ni\nl\ni\nt\ny\n\nP\no\n\nl\ni\nt\ni\n\nc\na\n\nl\n\nS\nk\n\ni\nl\nl\n\ne\nd\n\n \nl\n\na\nb\no\nr\n\nM\na\nc\nr\no\ne\nc\no\nn\no\nm\ny\n\nI\n\nn\nc\ne\nn\n\nt\ni\n\nv\ne\ns\n\nL\na\nb\no\nr\n \nc\no\ns\nt\n\nO\np\ne\nn\nn\ne\ns\ns\n\nL\na\nw\n\n \n\na\nn\nd\n \no\nr\nd\ne\nr\n\nR\ne\nd\n\n \nt\n\na\np\ne\n\nu\n\nt\ni\nl\ni\nt\ni\n\ne\ns\n\nP\n\nr\no\nv\n\ni\n\ns\n\ni\n\no\nn\n \no\nf\n\nC\no\nr\nr\nu\np\n\nt\ni\n\no\nn\n\nL\ne\ng\na\n\nl\n \ns\ny\ns\nt\ne\nm\n\nS\nk\n\ni\nl\nl\n\ne\nd\n\n \nl\n\na\nb\no\nr\n\nt\n\nh\ne\n\n \n\ne\nc\no\nn\no\nm\ny\n \n\nO\np\ne\nn\nn\ne\ns\ns\n \n\no\n\nf\n\nL\na\nb\no\nr\n \nc\no\ns\nt\n\nI\n\nn\nc\ne\nn\n\nt\ni\n\nv\ne\ns\n\nu\n\nt\ni\nl\ni\nt\ni\n\ne\ns\n\nP\n\nr\no\nv\n\ni\n\ns\n\ni\n\no\nn\n\n \n\no\n\nf\n\nM\na\nc\nr\no\ne\nc\no\nn\no\nm\ny\n\nL\ne\ng\na\n\nl\n \ns\ny\ns\nt\n\ne\nm\n\nL\na\nw\n\n \n\na\nn\nd\n\n \n\no\nr\nd\ne\nr\n\nR\ne\nd\n\n \nt\n\na\np\ne\n\ns\nt\n\na\nb\n\ni\nl\ni\nt\ny\n\nP\no\n\nl\ni\nt\ni\n\nc\na\n\nl\n\nC\no\nr\nr\nu\np\n\nt\ni\n\no\nn\n\n                              \n\nSource: ADB Investment Incentives Survey, 2008.

A  2009  report,  Philippines:  Reforming \nInvestment  Incentives  reiterated  the  key  constraints  on  the  investment  attractiveness  of  the \nPhilippines relative to its neighbors. 20  These include excessive red tape, political instability, and \ncorruption.  On  the  other  hand,  investors  rated  the  Philippines  above  average  on  skilled  labor \nand  the  cost  of  labor,  openness  of  the  economy,  and  generosity  of  tax  incentives  (Figure  6). \nMacroeconomic  performance,  considered  by  investors  to  be  the  most  important  factor \ninfluencing their investment decisions, was rated about average with the region. A 2007 report, \nPhilippines:  Critical  Development  Constraints  highlighted  inadequate  infrastructure  as  a  major \nconstraint on private sector investment and growth. 21  The report also identified constraints that \nhave  been  a  drag  on  investment  and  poverty  reduction  in  the  rural  economy,  including  bad \nconnectivity between farmers and urban markets, poor rural road infrastructure, costly shipping, \nand inadequate logistics.  \n \nProgress on business regulations.

Recognizing this, the Doing Business 2009 report also looked at \nLGU  performance.  Metro  Manila  performed  well  by  international  standards.  Based  on  best \npractices in the Philippines, it takes 27 days to launch a business in Taguig City (ranked 76th \nout of 178 economies);  it takes 58 days in Tanauan City to obtain construction permits (ranked \n6th  globally);  and  it  takes  21  days  in  Mandaluyong  City  to  register  property  (ranked  35th \nglobally).

As  a  starting  point,  an  oversight  agency  will  need  to  be  designated  to \npromote  the  RIA  and  achieve  broad  agreement  on  the  appropriate  institutional  arrangements. \nOne option would be to establish an office on best regulatory practice on the Australian model.   \n \n32. \nInfrastructure. Trade facilitation costs (from factory to port)  in the Philippines are high \ncompared  with  those  in  neighboring  countries.  The  World  Bank\u2019s  logistics  performance  index \nranks  the  Philippines  65  out  of  150  countries. 23  A  breakdown  shows  that  costs  related  to \ninfrastructure  (road,  rail,  and  domestic  shipping)  account  for  these  higher  costs  and  the  index \nranks the Philippines 86 on infrastructure. While public spending on infrastructure has gone up \nby more than 50% in the last 3 years, it still remains a little over half of its share in GDP in the \nmid-1990s.  Much  needs  to  be  done  to  encourage  private  companies  to  participate  in \ninfrastructure, including through public\u2013private partnerships, by reducing risks and uncertainty in \nthe policy and regulatory regime. Progress is being made, albeit gradually. The Government has \nissued  guidelines  clarifying  rights  and  obligations  in  joint  ventures  between  private  and  public \npartners in infrastructure investments and is standardizing procedures. However, the agenda is \nlarge  and  much  needs  to  be  done  to  provide  a  clearer  framework  for  government  risk \nguarantees  and  the  monitoring  of  them.  Over  the  medium  term,  the  Government  needs  to \nestablish  a  public\u2013private  partnership  project  preparation  facility.  This  would  increase  the \nconfidence of private operators and financiers in government commitments. \n \n33. \nTrade  facilitation.  The  World  Bank\u2019s  logistics  performance  survey  also  highlights  that \nthe Philippines could do more to improve performance in customs facilitation and transparency \n(it  is  ranked  53  out  of  150  countries).  Customs  processes  are  lengthy  and  cumbersome  and \nbusinesses  complain  about  a  lack  of  transparency.  In  all,  about  40  different  government \nagencies issue regulations or permits on exporting and importing goods. Customs has designed \na  national  single  window  that  will  allow  exporters  and  importers  to  track  containers  and  the \npermit  approval  process,  thereby  creating  an  arms-length  and  more  transparent  process  in \nclearance. It has been piloting this national single window at the port of Batangas since March \n2009 and the single window needs to be rolled out to all major ports.  \n \n\n4. \n\nEnhance Human Capital and Social Inclusion \n\n34. \nIn  the  current  global  environment,  the  Government  faces  both  short-  and  long-term \nchallenges  to  its  poverty  reduction  efforts.  In  the  short  term,  the  Government's  priority  is  to \nmitigate the worst effects of the current global economic crisis on the poor. In the long term, it is \nto make progress on the MDGs and to expand coverage of targeted programs to the poor.  \n \n35. \nPoverty impacts in the short term. The incidence of poverty is expected to rise in 2009. \nThe  transition  will  initially  be  through  job  losses  and  reduced  incomes  in  the  industrial  urban \ncenters, and is expected to spill over to the rural areas as the slowdown becomes more broadly \nbased. The expected slowdown in overseas deployment of Filipino workers will put pressure on \nthe labor market. Remittances are expected to fall, which will have an impact on poverty.  \n\n                                                 \n23  World  Bank.  2007.  Connecting  to  Compete:  Trade  Logistics  Performance  Index  and  Its  Indicators.  Washington, \n\nDC.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n18 \n \n\n \n\nThe core purpose of the fiscal expansion is to protect jobs and mitigate the worst effects \n36. \nof  the  global  crisis  on  poverty  reduction.  The  Government  has  scaled  up  several  poverty \nalleviation  programs.  Under  the  DPSP,  the  Government  designed  and  pretested  a  conditional \ncash  transfer  program  (CCT  or  Pantawid  Pamilyang  Pilipino  Program)  covering  20,000 \nhouseholds  in  2007.  A  pilot  program  covered  337,345  households  in  2008  and  this  has \ncontinued into 2009, with the intention to scale it to 699,000. Each household receives P1,400 \nper month. However, as the conditional cash transfer (CCT) program is still in its pilot stage, it is \nunlikely to be scaled up sufficiently enough to mitigate the full poverty effects of the economic \nslowdown.  Other  programs  that  have  been  scaled  up  include  the  hunger  mitigation  program, \neducation  scholarships,  and  the  school  feeding  program.  Through  the  2009  national  budget, \nsocial  expenditure  has  substantially  increased:  the  Department  of  Social  Welfare  and \nDevelopment (DSWD) budget has doubled in real terms (i.e., inflation-adjusted) compared with \nthe  2008  budget,  education  expenditure  has  increased  by  10%  in  real  terms,  and  health \nspending  by  19%  (Figure  7).  The  Government's  Comprehensive  Livelihood  and  Emergency \nEmployment  Program  (CLEEP)  is  designed  to  create  373,117  jobs  for  workers  who  may \notherwise fall into poverty. Implementation began at the end of 2008 with a budget allocation of \nP13.6 billion. By July 2009, 238,610 jobs had been created. \n \n\nFigure 7: Real Spending in the Social Sector  \n(P billion, adjusted for annual inflation; % share of national government budget) \n\n(a) Department of Health \n                                                                                                                            Development   \n\n(b) Department of Education \n\n \n\n    (c) Department of Social Welfare and  \n\n160\n\n120\n\n40\n\n0\n\nn\n\no\n\ni\n\nl\n\nl\n\ni\n\n80\n\nb\n\nP\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\nn\n\no\n\ni\n\nl\n\nl\n\ni\n\nb\n\nP\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\n1.60%\n\n1.40%\n\n1.30%\n\n1.90%\n\n2009\n\n2.10%\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n15.5\n\n14.0%\n\n14.4%\n\n2008\n\n14.9%\n\n2009\n\n14.9%\n\n2005\n\n0.3%\n\n2006\n0.3%\n\n2007\n\n0.4%\n\n2008\n0.5%\n\n2009\n0.9%\n\n  \nSources: Department of Budget and Management; various general budget appropriations, 2005\u20132009. \n\n \n\n                            \n\n \n37. \nRapid  poverty  monitoring.  The  Government  does  not  have  a  poverty  monitoring  and \nresponse  mechanism  that  can  provide  information  about  developments  in  household  poverty \nsufficiently quickly to allow it to respond promptly with targeted poverty alleviation programs. To \nmitigate the effects of the economic slowdown, the Government will therefore need to establish \na poverty monitoring unit coordinated across relevant ministries. \n \n38.  Medium-term  social  protection.  The  Government's  medium-term  social  sector \npriorities  are  to  make  progress  on  the  MDGs  and  to  expand  coverage  of  social  protection \nprograms  to  the  poor.    Fiscal  austerity  measures  introduced  from  2001  to  2006  to  reduce  the \nGovernment deficit disproportionately hurt social policy expenditures. This is one of the reasons \nthe  Philippines  is  having  difficulty  in  meeting  some  of  its  MDG  targets,  particularly  those  in \neducation  and  health.  The  Government  is  well  aware  of  these  problems  and  is  committed  to \n\n12\n\nn\n\no\n\ni\n\nl\n\nl\n\ni\n\nb\n\nP\n\n20\n\n16\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n \n\n\f \n\n19\n\nimproving  quality  and  access  to  basic  education  and  health  care,  and  to  reversing  recent \ndeclines  in  performance.  The  Government  has  been  addressing  resource  constraints  through \nsubstantial increases in real spending in the social sectors since 2007 (Figure 7). At the same \ntime,  the  Government  has  drafted  proposals  for  a  new  needs-based  formula  for  allocating \nschool  funding  on  a  more  equitable  basis.  In  the  health  sector,  the  Government  continues  to \nmake  progress  on  its  \"Fourmula  One  for  Health\"  implementation  framework  for  health  sector \nreforms in the medium term (2005\u20132010), including implementing its MTEF for better resource \nallocation  within  the  health  sector.  The  overall  goal  is  to  improve  the  quality,  efficiency, \neffectiveness,  and  equity  of  the  health  system,  particularly  for  the  poor.  ADB's  Health  Sector \nDevelopment  Program  offers  one  example  of  how  systematic  provincial  public  expenditure \nreviews  and  the  use  of  programmatic  initiatives  can  help  effect  improvements  to  local  service \ndelivery. 24 \n \n39. \nThe  Government  has  a  wide  range  of  social  protection  programs,  including  health \ninsurance,  education  scholarships  for  the  poor,  school  feeding  programs,  subsidized  rice \nthrough  the  National  Food  Authority,  public  employment  programs  and  the  community \ndevelopment  program  known  as  the  Kalahi  program.  However,  these  are  fragmented  and  the \noverall  results  in  terms  of  net  welfare  to  recipient  groups  are  mixed.  An  ADB  study  on  social \nprotection coverage shows that such programs only cover one-third of the poor compared with \nan average of one-half of the poor in Southeast Asia and East Asia. The Government is looking \nat  ways  to  enhance  social  protection  coverage  of  the  poor.  Under  subprogram 2,  the  National \nEconomic  and  Development  Authority  (NEDA) \nissued  Social  Development  Committee \nResolution No. 1 on adopting a Philippine definition of social protection. With the aim of refining \ntargeted programs under the new definition, the DSWD is implementing the CCT program, and \nthe  Department  of  Labor  and  Employment  (DOLE)  and  relevant  agencies  are  implementing \nCLEEP.  \n \nC. \n\nLessons \n\nIn  the  process  of  assessing  implementation  progress  on  the  triggers  for  subprogram  3 \n\n40. \n(Appendix 6), several lessons were identified and used to formulate subprogram 3.  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe Government's fiscal consolidation since 2005 has given it the fiscal space it \nneeds to respond to the current crisis and to expand its deficit to 3.2% in 2009. \nThe  program  cluster  approach  with  triggers  contains  sufficient  flexibility  to \nrespond  to  lessons  identified  during  implementation  and  to  incorporate  new \ngovernment policy priorities, such as measures to mitigate the economic impact \nof the current crisis and to protect critical public expenditure (para. 56). \nSubprogram  3  is  the  final  subprogram  of  the  program  cluster,  but it  is essential \nthat  policy  dialogue  and  engagement  should  continue  during  the  period  leading \nup  to  the  formation  of  a  new  government  after  the  presidential  election  in  May \n2010.  The  program  cluster  approach  provides  a  post-program  monitoring \nframework (para. 66 and Appendix 2, Policy Matrix). Ongoing TA support on tax \nadministration,  public  financial  management,  and  the  investment  climate  will \ncontinue during the post-program monitoring period.  \n\n \n41. \nAs a result, subprogram 3 incorporates several important new policy features to support \nthe Government\u2019s efforts to mitigate the adverse impact of the global crisis on macroeconomic \nstability and poverty.  \n\n                                                 \n24  ADB.  2004.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  Proposed  Loans  to  the \n\nRepublic of the Philippines for the Health Sector Development Program. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n20 \n \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \nThe impact of the subprogram 3 will be to restore the Philippines' economic expansion to \n42. \nits  long-term  path  and  to  lower  unemployment.  The  outcome  of  subprogram  3  will  be  greater \ninvestment, achieved through a set of program outputs to improve fiscal sustainability (through \nlower budget deficits, greater tax efforts, and better public debt management); enhance public \nfinancial  management  (through  better  reporting  mechanisms,  more  efficient  and  transparent \nprocurement systems, and stronger anticorruption programs in the revenue agencies); make the \ninvestment  climate  more  attractive  (through  lower  business  transaction  costs  and  better \ncoordination of public\u2013private participation in infrastructure); and strengthen human capital and \nsocial inclusion (through better poverty targeting and monitoring of assistance).  \n \n43. \nThe DPSP cluster includes a series of policy reforms that underpin the key priorities of \nthe Government\u2019s reform agenda. Subprogram 3 also includes a series of policy measures that \naddress  the  increased  vulnerabilities  and  risks  to  the  Philippine  economy  from  the  global \nfinancial crisis and the sharp slowdown in the global economy. These reforms are designed to:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(b) \n\nreporting; \n\nrecording,  and \n\nimplementing  anticorruption  and  enforcement  strategies \n\nimprove  fiscal  sustainability,  maintain  macroeconomic  stability,  and  improve \ncreditworthiness by enhancing the quality of fiscal management by (a) increasing \ntax  revenues  for  2008\u20132009  through  tax  policy  reforms;  (b) strengthening  tax \nadministration  and  enforcement,  and  reducing  revenue  leaks  through  improved \ngovernance;  (c)  reducing  inefficient  spending  to  permit  increased  social  and \npoverty-related  spending;  (d)  strengthening  the  debt  management  strategy  to \nmanage  government  contingent  liabilities  and  risks  prudently  and  (e)  giving \ndepositors' confidence in the domestic banking system; \nenhance  public  financial  management    governance  by  (a)  improving  public \nfinancial  management    from  budget  preparation  through  to  budget  execution, \nstrengthening  performance \naccounting, \nmanagement  and  improving  public  service  delivery;  (c)  reforming  procurement; \n(d) \nfor  revenue-\ncollecting  agencies  and  key  procurement  agencies;  and  (e)  sustaining  critical \npublic  expenditures  while  maintaining  budget  discipline  to  mitigate  the  poverty \nimpacts of the deceleration in growth; \nrural  development  by  \nimprove \n(a)  clarifying  and  strengthening \nfor \ninvestments and trade, (b) facilitating infrastructure development through greater \npublic\u2013private  participation  and  greater  coordination  of  public  infrastructure \ninvestments, and (c) improving rural\u2013urban connectivity; and  \nenhance  human  capital  and  social  inclusion  by  improving  the  policy  framework \nfor social protection, sustaining real spending on health and education, improving \ntargeting of programs, improving service delivery, piloting the CCT program tied \nto  performance  outcomes  in  child  education  and  health,  refining  public \nemployment  programs,  and  establishing  a  national  poverty  monitoring  and \nresponse  system  to  help  mitigate  the  impact  of  the  economic  slowdown  on \npoverty. \n\ninvestment  climate  and  promote \n\nlegal  and  regulatory \n\nframework \n\nthe \n\nthe \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions \n\n \nB. \n \n44. \nThe  report  and  recommendation  of  the  President  for  subprogram  2  of  the  DPSP \nidentified  13  policy  triggers  for  subprogram  3  (footnote  1).  In  the  process  of  assessing \n\n \n\n\f \n\n21\n\nimplementation  progress,  the  Government  proposed  three  additional  triggers  and  measures \naimed at addressing the increased vulnerabilities and risks to the Philippine economy from the \nglobal  financial  crisis  and  the  sharp  slowdown  in  progress  on  poverty  reduction  (Appendix  6 \nprovides an assessment of subprogram 3 triggers): \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nIncrease in bank deposit insurance. The Government is making every effort to \nmaintain macroeconomic stability in the current adverse global financial turmoil. \nOne  lesson  from  the  1997\u20131998  financial  crisis  was  that  the  absence  of  a \ncredible deposit insurance scheme can exacerbate the loss of confidence in the \nbanking  sector  and  lead  to  a  run  on  the  banks.  The  Government  has  therefore \nincreased the ceiling for deposit insurance from P250,000 to P500,000. \nSpeed up budget disbursements. Based on experience, disbursement rates for \npublic  spending  are  relatively  low  in  the  first  quarter  of  each  fiscal  year  (75%\u2013\n80% at key spending agencies). The procurement process is also slow to start as \nline  agencies  do  not  begin  until  allotments  (giving  the  authority  to  obligate)  are \nreleased by the DBM. The Government has therefore proposed a new trigger on \nactions \nto  speed  up  disbursements  and  advance  procurement  without \nundermining recent gains in procurement governance. \nEstablish  poverty  monitoring  and  reporting  mechanism.  The  Government \nhas recommended adding a new trigger on establishing a poverty monitoring and \nreporting  system  mechanism.  It  is  concerned  about  the  need  for  a  prompt \nresponse  to  increased  poverty  as  a  result  of  the  crisis.    The  focus  of  this \ninitiative\u2014to  measure  poverty  impacts\u2014will  be  on  collecting  real-time  data  on \nemployment  and  dismissals,  wage  data,  farmers\u2019  incomes,  prices  of  basic \ncommodities, health, education, and social welfare.  \n\n \n45. \nIn total, the Government and ADB are focusing on 16 policy triggers (Appendix 2, policy \nmatrix). Most are supported by 17 measures to outline a blueprint for government implementing \nagencies to follow and execute, while a few measures have clear outputs (e.g., establish a unit, \nproduce an action plan, or carry out capacity building and training programs). The Government \nhas made substantial progress in completing these measures. Of the 16 triggers, it has fully or \nsubstantially accomplished 13. One has been partially accomplished, and implementation of the \nremaining  two  is  ongoing.  The  Government  is  committed  to  completing  these  two  remaining \ntriggers  during  the  post-program  monitoring  period.  All  of  the  17  other  supporting  (nontrigger) \nmeasures have been completed.  \n \n46. \nProgress toward the DPSP performance indicators and targets set out in the design and \nmonitoring framework for subprogram 1 and updated for subprogram 3 (Appendix 1, column 3) \nhas been substantial, although the global financial crisis has set back progress on some of the \ntargets.  Of  the  25  performance  indicators  and  targets,  four  have  been  achieved:  (i)  two \nsovereign  credit  upgrades  by  Standard  &  Poor\u2019s  since  2006,  (ii)  a  consolidated  public  sector \nbudget  surplus  since  2006,  (iii)  computerization  of  revenue  district  offices  under  the  BIR's  tax \nadministration program, and (iv) rollout of the OPIF to national agencies and four constitutional \nbodies.  Twelve  are  on  track  to  achieve  medium-term  targets,  four  have  slowed,  four  have \nregressed from their medium-term paths or baselines, and the remaining indictor is a new one. \nProgress  on  the  following  indicators  has  slowed  or  regressed:  economic  growth,  the \nunemployment rate, and fixed capital investment (primarily due to the global financial crisis and \nrecession), tax collections as a share of GDP, and elementary school enrollments and survival \ncohort rates. The national government balanced budget target has been delayed from 2009 to \n2013 as a consequence of the global crisis.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n22 \n \n\n \n\nIn the spirit of the DPSP cluster, which aims to support the Government\u2019s policy reform \n47. \nagenda  on  a  continuing  basis  rather  than  through  predetermined  rigid  conditions,  the \nGovernment  has  asked  ADB  to  recognize  the  substantial  progress  that  has  been  made. \nFurthermore, as individual loans under the DPSP cluster are sequenced to provide continuous \nand  predictable  support,  and  subprogram  3  is  the  final  subprogram  of  this  cluster,  the \nGovernment  has  asked  ADB  and  its  development  partners  to  remain  fully  engaged  as  part  of \nthe  ongoing  dialogue,  to  support  and  continuously  monitor  implementation  and  completion  of \nthe  remaining  policy  triggers,  to  provide  longer-term  TA  to  strengthen  public  financial \nmanagement    capacity,  and  to  support  implementation  of  the  post-DPSP  program  monitoring \nframework. ADB\u2019s program cluster approach provides for such flexibility in reform programs that \nare implemented over time, by taking emerging circumstances into account. \n \n\n1. \n\nAccomplishments under Subprogram 3 \n\n48. \nSubprogram 3 focuses on four of the seven core policy areas outlined by the Philippines \nDevelopment  Forum  (PDF):  (i) improve  fiscal  sustainability,  maintain  macroeconomic  stability, \nand  improve  creditworthiness;  (ii)  improve  governance  in  public  financial  management  and \nreduce  corruption;  (iii)  strengthen  the  investment  climate  and  rural  development;  and  (iv) \nenhance human capital and social inclusion.  \n \n\na. \n\nImprove Fiscal Sustainability, Maintain Macroeconomic Stability, \nand Improve Creditworthiness \n\n49. \nFiscal  discipline. The Government\u2019s immediate objectives are to protect critical public \nspending within a disciplined fiscal framework and to reduce nonfinancial public sector debt to \n65% of GDP by 2010. In 2008, (i) the national government deficit came in at 0.9% of GDP, the \nthird  consecutive  year  it  has  been  below  1%,  and  a  consolidated  public  sector  surplus \nsurpassed program expectations; and (ii) nonfinancial sector public debt fell from 87% of GDP \nin 2005 to 60% in 2008, and is on track to return to debt levels of the early 1990s. The national \ngovernment debt decreased from 72% in 2005 to 56% by the end of 2008. \n \n50. \nTax revenue sustainability. Tax revenues increased by 11% in 2008. Major gains were \nachieved  in corporate  income  tax  collection  (18%)  and  tobacco  excise  (19%).  VAT  collections \nfell  by  3%  in  2008  due  to  weak  compliance  in  the  services  sector.  During  subprogram  3  the \nGovernment  initiated  medium-term  actions  to  improve  revenue  sustainability,  including  \nraising  the  excise  tax  rate  in  January  2009  in  line  with  existing  legislation.  The  DOF  has \nsubmitted a bill to Congress to reform excise taxes, including indexing specific rates to inflation \nand  reducing  the  number  of  tax  bands  to  two.  While  tax  administration  reforms  were  slow  to \nbegin,  some  progress  has  been  made:  (i)  the  BIR,  with  assistance  from  USAID  and  the \nMillennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), computerized 71 revenue district offices (97% of the \nuncomputerized  offices)  so  that  tax  information  can  be  provided  online  to  the  central  office  in \nManila;  (ii)  the  backlog  of  tax  registrations  and  returns  has  been  reduced,  with  348,465  tax \nregistrations  and  1,235,889  income  tax  returns  encoded  and  filed  with  assistance  from  the \nUSAID  and  MCC  grant;  and  (iii)  some  progress  was  made  in  validating  about  47%  of  the \nunregistered corporations (about 9,429 registered at the Securities and Exchange Commission) \nand inactive taxpayers in the database (162,352 taxpayers) identified under subprogram 2. The \nrevenue district offices are continuing to validate the identified taxpayers. \n \nDebt  management.  In  June  2009,  the  DOF  issued  a  department  order  establishing  a \n51. \ndebt and risk management division (DRMD). The DRMD will oversee debt policy and strategy, \ncarry out analysis, produce debt indicators, and undertake debt sustainability assessments. The \n\n \n\n\f \n\n23\n\ndepartment  order  was  issued  subject  to  the  DBM's  approval  of  the  DOF's  rationalization  plan, \nwhich is expected later in 2009. Implementation of the order is ongoing and is included in the \npost-program  monitoring  framework  (para.  66).  ADB  technical  assistance  will  be  provided  to \nsupport capacity development of the DRMD (Appendix 8). Monitoring of contingent liabilities in \npublic\u2013private infrastructure projects will be shifted from the investment coordination committee \n(ICC)  to  the  DRMD.  With  assistance  from  AusAID,  the  DOF  updated  the  contingent  liabilities \nrelated  to  public\u2013private  partnerships  in  infrastructure  under  the  BOT  Law.  It  also  made \nrecommendations on monitoring contingent liabilities and submitted them to the ICC.  \n \n52. \nDeposit  insurance.  The  Government  introduced  preemptive  measures  to  protect  the \neconomy. A key measure under subprogram 3 was raising the deposit insurance to P500,000 to \nboost  depositors'  confidence  in  the  domestic  banking  system  and  to  bring  the  ceiling  into  line \nwith those in neighboring countries.  \n \n53. \nImpact  and  outcomes  of  subprogram  3.  By  the  end  of  2009,  it  is  expected  that \nsubprogram  3  will  have  helped  to  stabilize  macroeconomic  fundamentals  and  to  prepare  the \neconomy  for  a  return  to  growth.  The  fiscal  consolidation  from  2005  to  2008  was  a  major \nachievement  and created  fiscal space  for  the  Government  to  mitigate some  of  the impacts  on \nthe  economy  and  poverty  in  2009  and  2010  arising  from  the  global  financial  crisis.  Fiscal \nsustainability  will  be  maintained,  as  reflected  in  the  country's  sustainable  debt  levels  and  the \nGovernment's  medium-term  fiscal  program,  which  targets  lower  budget  deficits  for  2011  and \n2012.  \n \n\nb. \n\nEnhance Governance in Public Financial Management and Reduce \nCorruption \n\nto \n\nimplement \n\nthe  MTEF  and  OPIF, \n\nimmediate  objectives  are \n\n54.

The \nimprove \nGovernment\u2019s \ntransparency in budget planning and execution, and strengthen internal control systems based \non  good  international  practice.  The  DBM  continued  to  refine  and  expand  the  medium-term \nexpenditure  framework  (MTEF)  for  the  2009  budget  and  the  2010  budget  preparations.  It \nupdated and produced forward estimates for a 3-year rolling period for all 22 line ministries and \nattached  agencies  and  issued  these  as  indicative  budget  ceilings  for  the  2010  budget.  The \nGovernment also continued to strengthen public sector performance management through more \naggressive  implementation  of  the  performance-based  budgeting  process  by  the  DBM  and \ncompleting  the  adoption  of  the  OPIF.  The  DBM  completed  the  rollout  of  the  OPIF  to  four \nconstitutional  offices\u2014(i)  Civil  Service  Commission, \n(ii)  Commission  on  Elections, \n(iii) Commission  on  Audit  (COA),  and  (iv)  the  Office  of  the  Ombudsman  (OMB)\u2014and  state \nuniversities and colleges for the 2009 budget. \n \n55. \nTransparency in budget execution. The DBM has made gradual progress in improving \ntransparency in the budget through the following key measures in 2008 and 2009. First, a key \nunderlying cause of weaknesses in budget execution, recording, and reporting is the absence of \nan integrated government financial management information system (GFMIS). The Government \nhas  taken  initial  steps  toward  achieving  consensus  among  stakeholders  on  the  design  and \ndevelopment  of  an  integrated  GFMIS  and  the  DBM,  with  assistance  from  the  US  Trade  and \nDevelopment  Agency,  has  completed  a  study  of  the  scope  and  requirements  of  an  integrated \nGFMIS. Second, the Government has begun reforms to strengthen internal control and internal \naudit within government agencies. Guidelines for internal control systems have been printed for \ndissemination  to  agencies,  GOCCs,  and  LGUs.  The  DBM,  with  technical  assistance  from \n\n \n\n\f \n\n24 \n \n\n \n\nAusAID,  started  piloting  the  internal  control  systems  guidelines  in  two  key  spending  agencies \n(DPWH and DepEd) in the fourth quarter of 2008. ADB and AusAID will support the piloting of \ninternal control systems in an additional set of agencies in 2009. \n \nthe \n56.  Measures  to  sustain  critical  public  spending.  Subprogram  3  supports \nGovernment\u2019s  efforts  to  mitigate  the  impact  of  the  global  financial  crisis  on  poverty.  The  DBM \nhas  implemented  a  number  of  measures  to  expedite  budget  disbursements,  including  (i)  the \nissuance of a DBM circular letter25 shifting cash releases to a 6-month cash release basis and \nrequiring  line  ministries  to  spend  each  month\u2019s  cash  allocation  or  lose  it;  (ii)  a  Government \nProcurement Policy Board (GPPB) circular to line ministries clarified that ministries can start the \nprocurement  process  before  receiving  allotments  from  DBM  (authority  to  obligate  the  budget) \nbut the signing of contracts will require receipt of these allotments. \n \n57. \nProcurement.  The  following  measures  were  undertaken  in  2008  and  2009  to  improve \ntransparency and efficiency in public procurement. First, PhilGEPS, the electronic procurement \nsystem, completed its second year of full operation and major progress was made in increasing \ncompliance  with  the  2003  law  on  procurement.  By  the  end  of  2008,  all  12  GPPB  member \nagencies  were  posting  bid  opportunities  and  award  notices,  compared  with  nine  in  2007.  The \nGPPB made also progress in expanding outreach to non-GPPB members with the Department \nof  Agriculture,  the  DSWD,  the  DENR,  and  the  BIR  all  posting  bid  notices  and  awards  on \nPhilGEPS  in  2008.  ADB  TA  is  helping  to  enhance  PhilGEPS  outreach  to  agencies  and  civil \nsociety  organizations.26 Second,  the  Procurement  Transparency  Group,  with  the  Government \nand major civil society organizations (CSOs) as members, began operations under subprogram \n3.  The  group  began  tracking  the  procurement  of  selected  infrastructure  projects  from  the  time \nthe  bid  notice  is  posted  to  selection  of  the  winning  bid. 27 Regular  updates  on  procurement \nmonitoring  are  posted  on  the  group\u2019s  website.28 If  discrepancies  are  identified  in  the  bid  and \nawards process, the group notifies the bids and awards committee and stakeholders to resolve \nany  transparency  concerns  that  may  arise.  Third,  to  enhance  transparency,  the  group  issued \nimplementing guidelines pursuant to its authority under Presidential Executive Order 662 (which \nestablished the group under subprogram 2). The guidelines require all government agencies to \npost  annual  procurement  plans,  procurement  monitoring  reports  on  activities  specified  in  the \nannual procurement plans, and blacklisting and delisting orders on the GPPB website.   \n \n58. \nExpenditure  integrity.  Subprogram  3  supports  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  reduce \nrevenue leakage by institutionalizing its anticorruption and collusion initiatives within agencies. \nExamples include the Run After Tax Evaders (RATE) program at the BIR and the Run After the \nSmugglers (RATS) program at the BOC. In July 2009 the DBM approved BIR's rationalization \nplan  to  transform  the  Enforcement  Service  to  an  Enforcement  and  Advocacy  Service  (EAS) \nunder the Legal Division\u2014a major achievement in strengthening enforcement capabilities at the \nBIR. The EAS has four divisions, one of which, the Special Prosecution Division (SPD), handles \nprosecution of RATE cases. The SPD will have 23 positions, and it is intended that most of the \nlitigation lawyers initially assigned to the RATE program with MCC assistance will be transferred \nto  the  SPD.  In  anticipation  of  the  approval  of  the  rationalization  plan,  the  2009  national \n\n                                                 \n25  No. 2008-11, December 2008. \n26 ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance to the Republic of the Philippines for Strengthening the Philippine Government \n\nElectronic Procurement System. Manila. \n\n27 The group established under subprogram 2 comprises representatives from GPPB, key procurement agencies, and \nsix CSOs nominated by the CSO Forum\u2014a voluntary gathering of major CSOs. The six CSOs are (i) the Bishops\u2013\nBusinessmen  Conference,  (ii)  Makati  Business  Club,  (iii)  Transparency  and  Accountability  Network,  (iv)  Ateneo \nGovernment Watch, (v) Confederation of Filipino Consultants, and (vi) Procurement Watch. \n\n28 Procurement Transparency Group. http://procurementtransparencygroup.wordpress.com. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n25\n\ngovernment  budget  has  allocated  an  additional  P1.0  billion  to  the  BIR  for  new  technical \npositions;  approximately  3,000  new  positions  nationwide  will  be  funded  under  this  additional \nbudget.  To establish the credibility of the EAS, it must now successfully prosecute some of the \nmore  than  120  RATE  cases  filed  with  the  Department  of  Justice.  Encouraging  progress  was \nmade  when  the  BIR  successfully  prosecuted  two  tax  fraud  cases  under  the  RATE  program  in \nJune 2009.  \n \n59. \n   The BOC has also made progress in institutionalizing its RATS program. The DBM has \napproved the creation of positions for the 36 previously contracted lawyers under the initiative. \nThe BOC continues to make progress in implementing its action plan (2008\u20132012), which was \ndeveloped through the OMB integrity development review process. This examines an agency's \npractices  and  procedures  to  assess  their  vulnerability  to  corruption.  The  OMB  has  placed \nresident  officers  in  the  BOC  to  help  implement  an  action  plan  on  a  voluntary  basis,  as  buy-in \nfrom  the  department  is  considered  necessary  for  successful  implementation.  In  addition,  an \nintegrity  development  committee  at \nthe \nimplementation of the action plan.  \n \n60. \nImpact and outcomes of subprogram 3. By the end of 2009, the DPSP is expected to \nhave  improved  the  budget  allocation  of  resources  and  to  have  linked  the  medium-term \ndevelopment  plan  and/or  priorities  of  national  departments  with  the  budget  process  (via  the \nMTEF). More departments will have an MTEF, and the rollout of the OPIF to four constitutional \nbodies and 112 state universities and colleges will have been completed. By the end of 2009, \nthe  number  of  line  agencies  complying  with  the  procurement  reform  law  and  transparency \nconditions  such  as  PhilGEPs  will  have  increased.  The  anticorruption  revenue  programs  in  the \nBIR and BOC will have been institutionalized to ensure they are sustainable.  \n \n\nthe  BOC  has  been  established \n\nto  monitor \n\nc. \n\nImprove the Investment Climate  \n\nfor \n\nthe \n\nframework \n\nthrough  a  better \n\nlegal  and  regulatory \n\ninvestment  climate.  Subprogram  3  supports \n\nInvestment climate reforms. The Government\u2019s main objective is to increase the share \n61. \nof investment and infrastructure spending in GDP. Critical reform areas under the DPSP include \n(i)  clarifying  and  strengthening \ninvestments, \n(ii)  improving  trade  facilitation,  (iii)  facilitating  infrastructure  development,  and  (iv)  promoting \nthe \nrural  development \nGovernment\u2019s efforts to reduce business transaction costs in 2008 and 2009. A memorandum \norder was submitted to the President's Office for approval in July 2009. This mandates NEDA to \nbegin advocating the regulatory impact assessment (RIA) and to develop an action plan for its \ninstitutionalization. The DTI has continued improvements in business registration by developing \nthe first phase of the Philippine business registry for sole proprietors online. Phase 2 covering \npartnerships  and  corporations  involving  the  Securities  Exchange  Commission  is  expected  to \nbegin in 2009. The Government and members of the PDF held a strategic agribusiness planning \nworkshop  in  March  2009.  This  discussed  the  formulation  of  a  strategic  agribusiness \ndevelopment  plan  and  the  bottlenecks  in  agriculture,  including  production,  post-production, \nmarketing  and  distribution  and  financing  sectors.  A  first  draft  of  the  strategic  agribusiness \ndevelopment plan has subsequently been drafted. \n \n62. \nTrade facilitation and infrastructure policy. To enhance transparency and lower trade \nfacilitation costs, the Bureau of Customs worked with 21 agencies that issue import permits to \nput  in  place  a  national  single  window.  The  \"e2m  Customs  Systems  Project\",  of  which  the \nnational single window is a component, has been piloted at the port of Batangas and the BOC \nhas also implemented an import assessment system under the e2m Customs Systems Project. \nThe  Government  has  submitted  to  the  Senate  for  concurrence  the  instrument  of  accession  to \n\n \n\n\f \n\n26 \n \n\n \n\nthe  Revised  Kyoto  Convention,  which  would  promote  greater  transparency  and  efficiency  in \ncustoms facilitation. In infrastructure policy, the medium-term objective is to establish a public\u2013\nprivate  infrastructure  partnership  project  preparation  facility.  In  the  interim,  the  Government \nissued  a  set  of  guidelines  to  govern  joint  ventures  between  government  and  private  sector \nentities;  it  is  currently  drafting  a  set  of  standard  transaction  documents  for  public\u2013private \npartnerships;  and  preparing  options  for  a  strategy  for  the  Government\u2019s  risk  assessment  and \nmanagement,  particularly  for  infrastructure  projects  approved  by  the  investment  coordination \ncommittee (ICC). \n \n63. \nImpact  and  outcomes  of  subprogram  3.  By  the  end  of  2009,  the  DPSP-supported \nprogram is expected to have improved the Philippine investment climate. The investment\u2013GDP \nratio is expected to have increased from 14% of GDP in 2006 to 15% by 2009 and the share of \npublic  investment  in  GDP  to  have  increased  by  1\u20132  percentage  points.  This  progress  will  be \nachieved by reducing the transaction costs of doing business (as reflected in reduced number of \ndays to start up a business). \n \n\nd. \n\nEnhance Human Capital and Social Inclusion \n\n64. \nThe  DPSP  supports  the  Government\u2019s  agenda  to  improve  the  social  sectors  by \nincreasing  funding,  improving  governance  in  the  budget  process  and  procurement,  engaging \ncivil society in monitoring procurement, and improving targeting of poverty reduction programs. \nIn 2008, the DSWD scaled up the  CCT program to cover  337,345 households. Each receives \nP1,400 per month per household based on conditions related to child education and health, and \nprenatal  and  post-natal  health  care  for  pregnant  women.  The  technical  committee  on  poverty \nstatistics of the National Statistical Coordination Board (under NEDA) produced a draft poverty \nmonitoring mechanism  to provide timely data and assessments of the impact of the economic \nslowdown  and  other  external  shocks  on  the  poor  that  would  allow  the  authorities  to  respond \npromptly. The NSCB is expected to approve it in the third quarter of 2009 and implementation \nwill follow. To mitigate some of the worst effects of the crisis on the poor, Presidential Executive \nOrder  782  earmarked  1.5%  of  ministries'  maintenance  expenditure  for  new  hiring  of  displaced \nworkers accredited with DOLE on temporary contracts of up to 6 months.  \n \n Impact  and  outcomes  of  subprogram  3.  By  the  end  of  2009,  the  DPSP  will  have \n65. \nimproved systems for poverty monitoring and reporting. The CCT program has been scaled up \nto 337,345 families, potentially making a significant dent in poverty.  \n \n\n2. \n\nPost-Program Monitoring Framework \n\n66. \nThe  development  policy  letter  sets  out  the  Government  reform  agenda  for  the  next  \n1\u20132 years, building on the reform momentum of the DPSP. The Government of the Philippines, \nADB,  and  the  Government  of  Japan  have  agreed  to  a  post-program  monitoring  framework  for \n12  months  focusing  on  11  core  policy  measures  of  the  Government's  short-term  plan  fiscal \nreform policy, public financial management, and selected areas in investment climate (Table 2 \nand  Appendix  2).  Monitoring  arrangements  are  discussed  in  paras.  70  and  78.  Ongoing  ADB \ntechnical  assistance,  including  the  proposed  public  financial  management  TA,  will  support \nimplementation of selected measures in the action plan (Appendix 9).  \n \n\n \n\n\fTable 2: Post-Program Monitoring Framework \n\nFiscal Policy and \nMacroeconomic Stability \n1.

The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period \nof 3 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB's London interbank-offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft \nprogram  loan  agreement  presented  to  the  Board.  The  Government  has  provided  ADB  with \n(i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis \nof  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices  were  its  own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \nThe  ADB  funds  are  to  support  reforms  outlined  in  the  development  policy  letter  and \n68. \npolicy matrix (Appendix 2). The loan size was determined by the strength of the policy package, \nits  development  impact,  the  importance  of  the  sectors  covered,  adjustment  costs,  direct \nbudgetary costs, and the development financing needs of the Government, as estimated by the \nDOF.  The  direct  budgetary  costs  of  subprogram  3  include,  for  example,  (i)  increasing  the \npersonnel budget at BIR (P1 billion in 2009 to address resource constraints at the agency) and \n(ii)  helping  to  meet  the  costs  of  implementing  public  financial  management  initiatives  and \ninstitutionalizing the anticorruption programs at the revenue agencies, the BIR and BOC, among \nother reforms.  \n \n69. \nThe  program  loan  also  reflects  the  development  financing  needs  of  the  Government \n(Table 3). In addition to supporting the Government\u2019s efforts to balance the national government \nand consolidate public sector budgets, the DPSP also recognizes the need for fiscal expansion \nin  the  national  government  budgets  for  2009  and  2010.  The  Government  aims  to  increase \ndevelopment and social spending in 2009 and, given the need for additional funding to mitigate \n\n \n\n\f \n\n28 \n \n\n \n\nthe  effects  of  the  deterioration  in  economic  growth  and  on  poverty  rates,  the  Government \nenvisages  a  targeted  government  deficit  of  3.2%  of  GDP  in  2009  and  2.5%  of  GDP  in  2010. \nAccording to DOF budget reports, the gross budget financing requirement for 2009 is estimated \nat P660.9 billion, of which the gross external financing requirement is P209.1 billion. Overall, net \nfinancing  requirements  (net  of  amortization)  amount  to  P270.6  billion.  The  proposed  loan \namount of $250 million for subprogram 3 will help close the financing gap for 2009. Other ADB \nprogram loans amounting to a combined $375 million, in addition to the Countercyclical Support \nloan  of  $500  million,  will  further  help  close  the  financing  gap.  Other  development  partners \n(Government of Japan cofinancing DPSP subprograms 2 and 3 and World Bank financing) and \ncommercial  borrowing  (including  the  potential  issuance  of  samurai  bonds  backed  by  a \nGovernment of Japan partial guarantee) will also help to close the financing gap for 2009.   \n \n\nTable 3: Projected Government Financing Requirements for 2009 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \nFinancing Mix  \n \nProgrammed Gross External and Domestic \nBorrowings \nof which: \n   Gross External Borrowing \n\nADB\u2019s Proposed Program Loan Pipeline \n\nDPSP Subprogram 3  \nLGU Finance Reform (subprogram 2) \nGovernance in Justice Reform \n(second tranche) \n\nOther ADB \n      Countercyclical Support Facility  \nOther Program Aid \n       Cofinancing DPSP Subprogram 2 \n(Government of Japan)a \nCommercial borrowingb \n\nAmount \n($ million unless otherwise \nstated) \n \n\nP660.9 billion \n\n \n\n4,311.0 \n625.0 \n250.0 \n225.0 \n150.0 \n\n \n500.0 \n400.0 \n100.0 \n\n2,250.0 \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, DPSP = Development Policy Support Program, LGU = local \ngovernment unit.

The  DOF  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  responsible  for  overall  program \nimplementation  activities,  such  as  reporting  to  ADB,  administering  and  disbursing  the  loan \nproceeds,  and  maintaining  accounts.  The  DBM  and  NEDA  will  be  the  implementing  agencies \nresponsible  for  implementing  subprogram  3,  and  shall  be  supported  by  the  relevant  line \nagencies including the Department of Agriculture, DepEd, the DOH, the DPWH, the DSWD, the \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n29\n\nDTI, and the OMB. The DPSP coordinating committee initiated under subprogram 1, chaired by \nthe  DOF  undersecretary  and  comprising  officials  from  the  DOF,  the  DBM,  and  NEDA,  will  be \nresponsible  for  coordinating  implementation  and  sustaining  the  DPSP  policy  actions  and  the \npost-program  monitoring  framework  together  with  DBM  and  relevant  line  agencies  involved  in \nsupporting  the  DPSP  and  post-program  monitoring  framework  (DepEd,  the  Department  of \nAgriculture, the DOH, the DPWH, the DSWD, and the OMB).

The loan proceeds \nwill be used to finance the full foreign exchange costs (excluding local duties and taxes) of items \nproduced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries  no  more  than  180  days  before  the \neffectiveness  date  of  the  loan.  Items  specified  in  the  list  of  ineligible  items  (Appendix  7)  and \nimports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources are excluded. In accordance with the \nprovisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related  Requirements  for \nProgram Loans (1998), the loan proceeds will be disbursed to the Republic of the Philippines as \nthe Borrower. No supporting import documentation will be required if during each year that loan \nproceeds are expected to be disbursed, the value of Philippine total imports minus imports from \nnonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development \nassistance is equal to or greater than the amount of the loan expected to be disbursed during \nsuch  year.  The  Government  will  certify  its  compliance  with  this  formula  with  each  withdrawal \nrequest.  Otherwise,  import  documentation  under  existing  procedures  will  be  required. \nDisbursements will be made under the simplified procedures for program loans. In accordance \nwith  the  simplified  disbursement  procedures  and  related  requirements  for  program  loans,  all \ngoods  and  services  produced  and  originating  in  ADB  member  countries  will  be  procured,  with \ndue  consideration  to  economy  and  efficiency,  in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  standard \npublic  procedures  and  normal  private  sector  commercial  practices  acceptable  to  ADB.  Goods \ncommonly  traded  on  the  international  commodity  market  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with \nprocedures appropriate to the trade and acceptable to ADB.  \n \n73. \ncounterpart funds generated from the proceeds of the subprogram 3 loan.  \n \n\nThe  reform  needs  supported  under  the  DPSP  will  be  financed  by  local  currency \n\n4. \n\nAnticorruption and Fiduciary Issues \n\n74. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Program.  To  support  these \nefforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations \nand  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Program.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection  with  the  Program  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \n\n \n\n\f \n\n30 \n \n\n \n\nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Program. \n \n75. \nA  core  component  of  the  DPSP  cluster  focuses  on  governance  and  reduction  of \ncorruption in key national government agencies vulnerable to such practices. The DPSP cluster \nincludes reforms to public financial management through the MTEF, and measures to improve \ntransparency and accountability in the budget cycle in agencies with large procurement budgets \n(e.g.,  DepEd,  the  Department  of  Agriculture,  DOH,  and  DPWH).  The  DPSP  supports \nimplementation  of  the  procurement  reform  law  and  measures  to  improve  transparency  in  the \nprocurement  process  (para.  75).  The  DPSP  supports  institutionalizing  the  anticorruption \nprograms  of  RATE  and  RATS  within  their  agencies  to  ensure  their  longer-term  sustainability \n(paras. 57\u201358).  \n \n76. \nThe  country\u2019s  financial  management  systems  were  assessed  before  subprogram  1  in \n2007 so ADB could better understand the fiduciary risks and determine the appropriate fiduciary \narrangements  for  the  DPSP.  This  assessment  was  updated  for  subprograms  2  and  3.  The \nupdate is based on diagnostic work done in the last 12 months including the public expenditure \nand  financial  accountability  assessment  led  by  the  World  Bank,  with  ADB  participation  during \nthe first stage. The assessment identified core areas to be addressed with development partner \nsupport.  Discussions  with  the  Government  during  implementation  of  the  public  financial \nmanagement  triggers  under  subprogram  3  and  its  ongoing  reforms  to  public  financial \nmanagement  were  also  considered.  Based  on  this  assessment,  the  fiduciary  arrangements \nproposed for the DPSP remain acceptable. The assessment indicates that the Government has \nmade  progress  in  improving  systems  related  to  public  financial  management,  financial \naccountability,  and  procurement,  although  weaknesses  remain  and  continued  progress  on \nimplementing  the  Government\u2019s  program  to  improve  governance  and  reduce  corruption  is \nessential. The Government places significant emphasis on making progress in implementing the \nMTEF in line ministries and the OPIF; improving the credibility of the budget, its execution, and \nreporting; and the rollout of internal control systems and internal audit. In this regard, the ADB \npolicy  and  advisory  TA  is  designed  to  support  the  DBM  to  strengthen  public  financial \nmanagement capacity. \n \n\n5. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n77. \nADB retains the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment\u2019s  certification  for  withdrawal  applications.  Before  withdrawal,  the  Government  will \nopen a deposit account at the Central Bank of the Philippines to receive all loan proceeds. The \naccount will be managed, operated, and liquidated in accordance with terms satisfactory to ADB. \nThe  DOF  will  be  required  to  submit  quarterly  progress  reports  as  well  as  a  final  report  on  the \nprogress of subprogram 3 implementation. \n \n\n6. \n\nPerformance Monitoring, Evaluation, and Program Review \n\n \n78. \nIn  cooperation  with  the  DPSP  coordinating  committee  (para.  70),  ADB  and  the \nGovernment of Japan will carry out periodic reviews of program implementation and assess the \nimpact  of  the  DPSP  and  the  post-program  monitoring  framework.  The  Government  will  keep \nADB informed of the outcome of policy discussions with other multilateral and bilateral agencies \nthat  have  implications  for  DPSP  implementation,  and  provide  ADB  with  the  opportunity  to \ncomment  on  any  resulting  policy  proposals.  ADB,  in  collaboration  with  the  coordinating \ncommittee, will undertake a review of program performance 6 months after loan effectiveness to \nreview the outcome of subprogram 3. In addition to the review report, the committee will submit \n\n \n\n\f \n\n31\n\nto  ADB  (within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness  of  the  subprogram  3)  a  review  report  that \nassesses  compliance  with,  and  the  impact  of,  the  agreed  actions  under  subprogram  3.  A \ncompletion  report  that  shows  the  overall  outcomes  and  output  results  of  the  program  cluster, \ntaking into account the interim completion reports prepared for subprograms 1 and 2, will also \nbe prepared and submitted to ADB within 6 months of loan effectiveness for subprogram 3. In \naddition,  participants  in  the  PDF  (partner  agencies,  CSOs,  and  other  stakeholders)  will  be \nencouraged to support civil society monitoring of the DPSP reforms. \n \nThe  Government  and  its  development  partners  have  agreed  on  the  updated  outcome \n79. \nand  output  indicators  to  monitor  DPSP  implementation  and  evaluate  its  impact,  within  the \noverall DPSP framework (Appendix 1). \n \n\nV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n80. \nIn  connection  with  subprogram  3,  an  advisory  technical  assistance  grant  is  proposed. \nThis is the second of three TA projects for public financial management envisaged over the next \n3  years  to  continue  ADB's  engagement  in  public  financial  management  reforms  in  the \nPhilippines.  The  three  TA  projects  are  designed  to  strengthen  capacity  at  the  DBM  and  line \nministries  to  implement  public  financial  management  reforms.  The  first  TA  project  is  providing \nsupport to advance GFMIS dialogue, advisory assistance on budget execution, and piloting the \nICS laying the foundations for subsequent TA. The second TA project will support the DBM, the \nBureau  of  Treasury,  and  the  DOF  to  implement  and  monitor  key  public  financial  management \nreforms. The TA will cover capacity development support for the newly established debt and risk \nmanagement  division,  the  rollout  of  an  internal  controls  system  at  the  national  level,  and \ncontinued  support  to  the  design  and  development  of  the  GFMIS,  among  other  activities.  Its \nmeasures will be agreed as part of the post-program monitoring framework. The third TA project \nwill build on activities under the second TA project, including the integrated GFMIS, the rollout of \ninternal  control  systems,  debt  management,  and  cash  revenue  forecasting.  The  second  TA \nproject  is  estimated  to  cost  $1,150,000  equivalent,  of  which  ADB  will  provide  $800,000,  to  be \nfinanced  by  the  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program  (TASF\u2014other  sources).  The  Government  will \nprovide the remaining $350,000 in kind by providing counterpart staff and other facilities. A team \nof international and national consultants will implement the TA. ADB will engage a combination \nof  a  consulting  firm  and  individuals  in  accordance  with  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  firm  will  be  engaged  following  quality-  and  cost-\nbased  selection  (80:20  quality\u2013cost  ratio)  using  a  simplified  technical  proposal.  A  total  of  51 \nperson-months of consulting services will be required (18 international and 33 national). The TA \nis expected to commence in the first quarter of 2010 and to be completed by the fourth quarter \nof 2011. The TA purpose, outputs, methodology, implementation arrangements, and budget are \nin Appendix 8, and the terms of reference for consultants are in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n\nVI. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nExpected Impacts \n\nA. \n \n81. \n\nThe key benefits expected from the DPSP are as follows: \n(i) \n\nProgress  toward  medium-term  fiscal  sustainability  will  promote  macroeconomic \nstability  and  foster  broad-based  economic  growth,  job  creation,  and  poverty \nreduction, all of which are cornerstones of the Government\u2019s MTPDP and PDF.  \nBetter  public  financial  management  governance  will  improve  prioritization  and \nefficiency of spending in key sectors such as the social sectors. \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n\f(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nlong-term  growth,  stimulate \n\ninfrastructure  spending  will  generate \n\nLower  transaction  costs  for  business,  because  of  the  reduction  in  bureaucracy, \nwill open new opportunities; increase investment, productivity, and incomes; and \ncreate jobs. \nHigher \ninvestment, create jobs, and raise incomes. \nIncreased  spending,  better \ntargeted  social  assistance  programs,  and \nimplementation  of  the  CCT  program  will  improve  social  sector  outcomes.  The \nexpansion  of  the  CCT  program  will  have  potential  gender  benefits  for  maternal \nhealth  and  girls'  education:  (i)  pregnant  women  will  receive  pre-  and  postnatal \ncare beginning in the first trimester of pregnancy, and the birth will be attended \nby  a  skilled  health  professional;  (ii)  parents  will  attend  parent  effectiveness \nservice  classes;  (iii)  children  aged  0\u20135  will  receive  regular  preventive  health \ncheckups and vaccines; (iv) children aged 3\u20135 will attend day care or preschool \nprograms; and (v) children aged 6\u201314 will be enrolled in school and demonstrate \nat least an 85% attendance rate at school. The Government is intending to begin \nbenchmarking data in third quarter of 2009 to assess program performance. \nThe  institutionalization  of  governance  programs  including  the  MTEF,  regulatory \nimpact assessments and the anticorruption initiatives in the BIR and the BOC will \nimprove the sustainability of key governance programs. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nThe DPSP is subject to the following risks: \n(i) \n\nThe  global  financial  crisis  has  hurt  the  Philippines.  The  major  impact  on  the \neconomy has been the second-round effects of the decline in global demand and \nits fiscal repercussions. The economic slowdown in the Philippines and the risk of \na  decline  in  remittances  will  feed  into  higher  poverty  in  2009.  However,  the \nimpact on poverty will be partly offset through the scaling up of the CCT program \nand an increase in infrastructure development in 2009 and 2010. \n\nthreaten \n\nfiscal  discipline \n\nin  2010.  However, \n\n(ii)  With  the  economic  stresses  in  2009  and  an  election  in  2010,  the  Government \nand or members of Congress may be tempted to introduce populist policies that \ncould \nthe  Government  has \nannounced  its  budget  target  for  2010  at  2%  of  GDP  and  since  2006  it  has \ndemonstrated  commitment  to  meeting  its  fiscal  targets.  The  post-program \nframework will ensure dialogue is continued with the Government on fiscal policy.  \nThe  2010  presidential  elections  may  slow  implementation  of  reforms.  However, \nthe  Government  has  full  ownership  of  the  DPSP  reform  program,  which  is \nembedded  in  the  Philippines  Development  Forum  and  its  sector  strategies. \nMoreover, the Government, ADB, and the Government of Japan have agreed to \na post-DPSP program monitoring framework to maintain progress on reforms.  \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv)  Weak  capacity  in  some  of  the  crucial  spending  agencies  (such  as  the \nDepartment of Agriculture) may limit the effectiveness of the Government's fiscal \nstimulus in 2009 and the long-term delivery of services. Longer-term institutional \nreforms may be needed in some agencies.  \n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n83. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:  \n\n(i) \n\nCounterpart  funds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  development  needs  as  outlined \nunder the DPSP implementation arrangements. \n\n \n\n32 \n \n\n \n\n \nB. \n \n82. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n33\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe  policies  and  actions  taken  prior  to  the  date  of  subprogram  3  of  the  DPSP \nloan  agreement,  as  described  in  the  development  policy  letter  (including  the \npolicy matrix), will continue to be in effect for the duration of subprogram 3.  \nA  completion  report  that  shows  the  overall  outcomes  and  output  results  of  the \nprogram  cluster  taking  into  account  the  interim  completion  reports  prepared  for \nsubprograms 1 and 2 will be prepared and submitted to ADB within 6 months of \nloan effectiveness of the subprogram 3. \n\n \n\nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n\n84. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$250,000,000  to  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines  for  subprogram  3  of  the  Development  Policy \nSupport  Program  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in \naccordance with ADB's London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a term of \n15  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Program Loan Agreement presented \nto the Board. \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n24 August 2009 \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\n34 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n\n \nDesign \nSummary \nImpact  \n \n \nSustainable higher \neconomic growth \n \n \n \nLower unemployment \n\n \nPerformance Targets \nand/or Indicators \nBy 2010, revised \nMTPDP goals attained: \n \nReal gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) growth \nat 6%\u20137% per annum \n \n \nUnemployment reduced \nfrom 8% in 2005 to \n6.5% in 2010a       \n\nBy 2009 (baseline \nindicators in brackets): \nUpgrade in sovereign \ncredit rating (BB\u2013 \noutlook or equivalent in \n2005) \n \n \n \nIncrease in share of \nfixed capital to GDP in \nthe range of 2\u20134 \npercentage points (14% \nin 2006) \n \nBy end-2009 (baseline \nindicators in brackets): \n \nConsolidated public \nsector deficit of 0.5% in \n2009 and balanced in \n2010 (4.8% in 2004) \n \n \n \nNational government \nbudget deficit of 1% in \n2008, 0.5% in 2009, \nand balanced in 2010 \n(deficit of 2.7% in \n2005)b  \n\nOutcome \nHigher investment \n\nOutputs \n \n1.

The \nGovernment is intending to begin benchmarking data in third quarter of 2009 for assessing program performance.   \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n39 \n\nDEVELOPMENT POLICY LETTER AND POLICY MATRIX \n \n\n \nOur  macroeconomic  policy  response  to  the  external  shocks  has  been  both  appropriate  and \nresponsive. Earlier in 2008, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) shifted to a tighter monetary \nposition to counter possible second round inflationary effects from the commodity price surge. \nThen in the fourth quarter it shifted to an expansionary position to ensure sufficient liquidity in \nthe banking system against rapidly falling inflation. By May 2009 inflation had fallen to 3.3% well \nwithin  the  BPS's  inflation  target  for  2009.  To  boost  confidence  in  the  financial  sector,  the \nGovernment  took  a  number  of  preemptive  measures  aimed  at  increasing  liquidity  in  the \ndomestic bank system, assuring confidence of depositors, and strengthening the central bank's \nlender of last resort facility.  \n \nWith  these  preemptive  measures  in  place,  the  macroeconomy  stabilized  and  key  indicators \nshowed encouraging signs of improvement. Commercial bank lending continued robust growth \nat about 20% in the first quarter of 2009 on a year-on-year basis; the stock market and the peso \nhave stabilized since November and yields on domestic bonds have recently fallen back to pre-\ncrisis  levels,  Gross  international  reserves  continued  to  accumulate  in  2009,  equivalent  to  6.3 \nmonths of import cover and three times greater than external debt maturing this year, providing \na  sufficient  buffer  against  further  moderate  external  shocks.  Spreads  on  Philippine  sovereign \ndollar bonds have also declined in recent months but still remain above pre-crisis levels.  \n \nThe global crisis has impacted on our fiscal situation, although this remains manageable as a \nresult  of  successful  implementation  of  our  fiscal  consolidation  strategy  since  2004.  Our  fiscal \nconsolidation efforts brought down the non-financial sector public debt from over 100% of GDP \nin 2003 to 61 % at the end of 2008 back to levels last seen in the early 1990s. Perhaps one of \nthe  most  important  achievements  of  the  fiscal consolidation  program  has  been  the  creation  of \nfiscal space to mitigate some of the poverty impacts from the global crisis in 2009. In particular, \nthe  program  has  resulted  in  an  increased  share  of  discretionary  spending  from  26  %  of  total \nbudget expenditures in 2006 to 37 % in 2008, with the social sectors and infrastructure the main \nbeneficiaries. \n \nWith  these  challenging  times,  and  our  lessons  learned  from  the  1998  crisis  and  its \nrepercussions for fiscal sustainability, we are committed to maintain fiscal discipline necessary \nto maintain investor confidence in the economy, while at the same time creating fiscal space to \nprotect  spending  in  the  social  sectors  and  provide  an  effective  and  timely  stimulus  to  the \neconomy. Therefore, we are targeting a budget deficit of 3.2% of GDP in 2009, lower than our \nregional neighbors. The budget provides for an increase in discretionary spending as part of our \ncountercyclical  stimulus.  Key  initiatives  include  the  scaling  up  of  the  conditional  cash  transfer \nprogram (CCT) to 337,234 households in 2008 and 2009 and we intend to scale it up further. \nWe have also begun implementing the Comprehensive Livelihood and Emergency Employment \nProgram (CLEEP) with a target of creating 373,117 jobs. As of June 2009, 137,000 jobs have \nbeen created under the program. As part of our stimulus we have advanced procurement and \nspending  on  infrastructure  projects.  Key  procurement  agencies  such  as  Department  of \nAgriculture,  Department  of  Education,  Department  of  Pubic  Works  and  Highways,  and  the \nDepartment of Transport and Communication have committed themselves to front loading their \nspending programs in the first semester to 60% of the total 2009 program. Our data suggests \nthat these commitments have been broadly achieved. We are committed to fiscal sustainability \nand have announced a revised fiscal program up to 2013. We are targeting a budget deficit of \n2%  in  2010  and  a  balanced  budget  by  2013.  This  will  be  achieved  by  cutting  back  on  crisis-\nrelated discretionary spendiising the revenue to GDP ratio by one percentage point.  \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n41 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nTable A2: Policy Matrix for Subprogram 3 of the Development Policy Support Program with Government Short-Term Action \n\nPlan and Medium-Term Direction \n\n \n\nPolicy Actions \n1.1  Initiate reforms \nto reduce \nnational \ngovernment and \nconsolidated \npublic sector \ndeficits \n\nSubprogram 3 Policy Conditions (in bold) and Milestones \n \n\nThe Government continued its prudent fiscal policy and remained \nwithin its revised fiscal targets for 2008.

The \nimmediate  pressing  issues  for  macroeconomic policy  are  the  deceleration  in  economic  growth \nand  its  fiscal  repercussions.  The  critical  issues  for  the  Government  in  the  short  term  are  to \nsustain  critical  public  spending  and  to  address  additional  financing  needs  arising  from  the \ndecline  in  tax  revenues  in  the  first  quarter  of  2009.  Over  the  medium  term,  the  Government \npriorities  include  sustaining  priority  spending  by  raising  revenues,  improving  the  efficiency  of \npublic  expenditure  management,  and  increasing  the  effectiveness  of  debt  management.  The \nGovernment  has  outlined  a  revised  fiscal  sustainability  strategy  with  medium-term  balanced \nbudget targets. While the balanced budget target has served the Philippines well over the last 4 \nyears, the current crisis has provided an opportunity to revisit the policy of balancing the budget \ntarget  and  explore  alternative  fiscal  rules  that  could  anchor  fiscal  policy  and  operations  in  the \nfuture.   \n \nA.  \n \nEconomic growth was 4.6% in 2008, lower than the 7.3% in 2007, but above the regional \n2. \naverage. The slower economic growth was a combination of a contraction in public spending in \nthe first quarter of 2008, a surge in domestic inflation that reduced domestic consumption from \n6%  in  2007  to  4.6%  in  2008,  and  the  recession  in  the  United  States  that  lowered  demand  for \nPhilippines  exports.  Private  investment  continued  to  expand  in  the  first  half  of  2008,  with \npurchases of durable equipment expanding by 6% on a year-on-year basis, among the highest \nrates for a decade, and private construction expanding by 20% for 2008. As the global crisis has \nintensified since September 2008 and global demand has contracted, investment and trade has \nslowed.  In  the  first  quarter  of  2009,  the  economy  decelerated  sharply  to  contract  by  an \nannualized 2.3% (seasonally adjusted) as exports plunged and consumption stalled. Economic \ngrowth  for  2009  is  projected  to  be  in  the  range  of  0.8%\u20131.8%.  This  translates  to  a  negative \noutput  gap  of  4%\u20135%  of  GDP  (Figure  A4.1).  Indicative  of  a  sharp  cyclical  downturn  in  the \neconomy is the rapid fall in core inflation, which reached 3.3% in July 2009, down from its peak \nof 8.0% in November 2008 and the fall in tax collection of 5.2% in the first semester of 2009. \n \n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nFigure A4.1: Output Gap and Inflation \n \n\n  (a) Potential and Actual Economic Growth 1970\u20132009       (b) Headline and Core Inflation Jan 2008 to April 2009 \n                                                                                                     (monthly rates, year-on-year) \n\n \n\n%\n\n14\n\n12\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n9\n\n7\n\n0\n\n9\n\n9\n\n9\n\n9\n\n9\n\n9\n\n9\n\n9\n\n9\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n7\n\n7\n\n7\n\n8\n\n8\n\n8\n\n9\n\n9\n\n9\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n3\n\n6\n\n9\n\n2\n\n5\n\n8\n\n1\n\n4\n\n7\n\n0\n\n3\n\n6\n\n0\n\n0\n\n9\n\nJ\n\na\n\nn\n\n-\n0\n\n8\n\nF\n\ne\n\nb\n\n-\n0\n\nM\n\na\n\nr\n\n-\n0\n\n8\n\n8\n\nA\n\np\n\nr\n\n-\n0\n\n8\n\nM\n\na\n\ny\n\n-\n0\n\n8\n\nJ\n\nJ\n\nu\n\nu\n\nn\n\n-\n0\n\n8\n\nl\n\n-\n0\n\n8\n\nA\n\nS\n\nO\n\nN\n\nD\n\nu\n\ne\n\ng\n\np\n\n-\n0\n\n-\n0\n\n8\n\n8\n\nc\n\no\n\ne\n\nt\n-\n0\n\n8\n\nv\n\nc\n\n-\n0\n\n-\n0\n\n8\n\n8\n\nJ\n\na\n\nn\n\n-\n0\n\n9\n\nF\n\ne\n\nb\n\n-\n0\n\nM\n\na\n\nr\n\n-\n0\n\n9\n\n9\n\nA\n\np\n\nr\n\n-\n0\n\n9\n\nGDP growth\n\nPotential growth\n\nCore Inflation\n\nHeadline Inflation\n\n \nNotes: The potential economic growth rate is estimated using the Hodrick-Prescott filter, which estimates a nonlinear \ntrend in the economic growth data.

Spillovers  from  the  global  financial  crisis  on  the  Philippine  domestic \nfinancial  system\u2014especially  in  the  banking  sector\u2014has  been  relatively  muted  because  of \nlimited  exposure  to  troubled  US  assets,  and  low  exposure  to  securitization  and  off-balance \nsheet activities. The banking system remains sound, with the sector's capital adequacy ratio at \n14% and gross nonperforming loans at 3.6% as of end of May 2009 (Figure A4.2). Liquidity in \nthe banking system is sufficient as reflected in a liquidity\u2013deposit ratio of over 50% at the end of \nthe  third  quarter  of  2008.  However,  banks  will  face  new  challenges.  If  economic  growth \nweakens  as  projected,  this  would  affect  corporations  and  increase  nonperforming  loans  and \nerode  bank  capital.  The  Philippine  stock  market  index  fell  by  as  much  as  50%  in  2008  in  line \nwith the experience of regional neighbors and has since stabilized.  \n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n-4\n\n-6\n\n-8\n\n-10\n\nh\n\nt\n\nw\no\nr\n\ng\n\n \n\n%\n\n \n\n\f \n\n51\n\n49\n\n47\n\n45\n\n43\n\n41\n\n39\n\n37\n\n35\n\ne\nt\n\na\nr\n \n\ne\n\ng\n\nn\n\na\n\nh\n\nc\n\nx\n\ne\n \n\no\ns\n\ne\n\nP\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\nAppendix 4 \n\n53\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n     (a) Philippine Stock Exchange Index (PSEI)           (b) Spreads on sovereign dollar bonds (bps) \n           and Peso\u2013US Dollar Exchange Rate  \n\nFigure A4.2: Financial Sector Performance \n\n \n\nLHS\n\nRHS\n\n4000\n\n3500\n\n3000\n\n2500\n\n2000\n\n1500\n\n1000\n\ni\n\nE\n\nS\n\nP\n\n1200\n\n1000\n\n800\n\n600\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n\nA\n\nu\n\ng\n\n-\n0\n\n8\n\nJ\na\n\nn\n\n-\n0\n\n7\n\nM\n\nM\n\na\n\na\n\nr\n\n-\n0\n\n7\n\ny\n\n-\n0\n\n7\n\nJ\nu\n\nl\n-\n0\n\n7\n\nS\n\nN\n\ne\n\np\n\n-\n0\n\no\n\nv\n\n-\n0\n\n7\n\n7\n\nJ\na\n\nn\n\n-\n0\n\n8\n\nM\n\nM\n\na\n\na\n\nr\n\n-\n0\n\n8\n\ny\n\n-\n0\n\n8\n\nJ\nu\n\nl\n-\n0\n\n8\n\nS\n\nN\n\ne\n\np\n\n-\n0\n\no\n\nv\n\n-\n0\n\n8\n\n8\n\nJ\na\n\nn\n\n-\n0\n\n9\n\nM\n\na\n\nr\n\n-\n0\n\n9\n\nS\n\ne\n\np\n\n-\n0\n\n8\n\nO\n\nc\n\nt\n-\n0\n\n8\n\nN\n\no\n\nv\n\n-\n0\n\n8\n\nD\n\ne\n\nc\n\n-\n0\n\n8\n\nJ\n\na\n\nn\n\n-\n0\n\n9\n\nF\ne\n\nb\n\n-\n0\n\n9\n\nM\n\na\n\nr\n\n-\n0\n\n9\n\nA\n\np\n\nr\n\n-\n0\n\n9\n\nPeso exchange rate\n\nPhilippines' Stock Market Index\n\nPhilippines\n\nEast Asia\n\nIndonesia\n\n    \nPSEi\n                                                                                                                                       \n      (c) Banking System CAR and NPL (%)                    (d) Banking System LDR and Liquidity (%)    \n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\nLHS\n\nLHS\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n80\n\n75\n\n70\n\n65\n\n60\n\n55\n\n50\n\nRHS\n\nRHS\n\n2\n\nq\n\nq\n\nq\n\n2\n\nq\n\nq\n\nq\n\n2\n\nq\n\nq\n\nq\n\n2\n\nq\n\nq\n\nq\n\n2\n\nq\n\nq\n\nq\n\n2\n\nq\n\nq\n\nq\n\n0\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n0\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n0\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n0\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n0\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n0\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n0\n\n6\n\nq\n\n1\n\n0\n\n7\n\nq\n\n1\n\n0\n\n8\n\nq\n\n1\n\n0\n\n6\n\nq\n\n1\n\n0\n\n7\n\nq\n\n1\n\n0\n\n8\n\nq\n\n1\n\nCAR\n\nNPL\n\nLDR\n\nLiquidity\n\n  \n    \n   bps = basis points, CAR = capital adequacy ratio, LDR = loan to deposit ratio, LHS = left hand side, NPL = non        \n   performing loans , RHS = right hand side, PSEI = Philippine Stock Exchange Index. \n   Sources: Central Bank of the Philippines (BSP) and CEIC. \n \n4. \nGovernment\u2019s  policy  response.

Indicators \nhave since shown signs of improvement. Bank liquidity eased at the end of 2008, with interest \nrates on treasury bills falling from 6.9% in August 2008 to average 4.95% in the first semester of \n2009.

Fiscal  indiscipline,  coupled  with  poor \nmonetary  policy  management  until  1993  when  the  central  bank  was  reformed,  were  the  main \ncontributors to macroeconomic instability from the late 1970s to 2004. In 2005, the Philippines \nemerged from a period of serious fiscal difficulty. From 1998 to 2004, budget revenues dropped, \nwhich significantly suppressed expenditure in the social sectors, leading to a substantial decline \nin public sector real wages.1 The deficit reached 5.2% of GDP and the nonfinance public sector \ndebt  exceeded  100%  of  GDP  in  2004.  The  high  and  unsustainable  deficits  triggered  bouts  of \npeso  exchange  rate  instability.  The  Government  has  restored  macroeconomic  stability  and \nmaintained  it  through  fiscal  discipline.  The  cornerstone  and  the  measure  with  the  highest \nrevenue  impact  was  the  reform  of  value-added  tax  in  November  2005,  which  extended  the \nvalue-added  tax  base  to  energy  products,  and  increased  the  rate  from  10%  to  12%  effective \nFebruary  2006.  Other  measures  included  increasing  (i)  excise  taxes  on  alcohol  and  tobacco \nproducts  by  30%  at  the  end  of  2004  (increased  again  in  January  2007  and  January  2009, \nalthough  not  fully  indexed  to  inflation),  (ii)  the  corporate  income  tax  rate  from  32%  to  35% \n(which reverted to 30% in January 2009 as mandated in the amendments to tax legislation), and \n(iii)  electricity  tariffs.  As  a  consequence  of  these  reforms,  tax  revenues  grew  by  over  1.3 \npercentage  points  of  GDP  in  2006,  the  national  government  deficit  fell  to  0.9%  of  GDP  from \n2.7% in 2005, and the consolidated public sector budget turned in a surplus for the first time in \nalmost a decade, aided by the improvement in the finances of the National Power Corporation. \nFiscal  consolidation  continued  in  2007  with  the  national  government  deficit  falling  to  0.2%  of \nGDP and the consolidated public sector budget remaining in surplus for a second consecutive \nyear.  \n \n6. \nIncreased social expenditures. The fiscal crisis and subsequent consolidation program \nsuppressed  expenditures  in  the  social  sectors  and  in  infrastructure.  However,  by  2006 \nsubstantial resources were freed for priority spending in the 2007\u20132009 budgets. In particular, \ndiscretionary  spending  in  the  national  government  budget  increased  from  26%  of  total \nexpenditures  in  2006  to  37%  in  2008  with  the  social  sectors  and  infrastructure  the  main \nbeneficiaries  (Figure  A4.3).

In  the  past,  fiscal  policy  in  the \nPhilippines has not been effective in mitigating the effects of economic downturns. This is partly \na characteristic of most developing economies, as fiscal policy usually does not have embedded \nin it automatic stabilizers on the expenditure side of the national government budget that would \nallow  for  effective  countercyclical  spending.  In  the  Philippines,  relatively  high  public  debt  and \nlarge nondiscretionary commitments (interest payments and transfers to local government units) \nin  the  budget  limited  the  opportunity  for  discretionary  countercyclical  spending.  The  fiscal \nconsolidation program that has been in carried out since 2004 suppressed primary expenditures. \nThe  national  government  budget  does  have  modest  automatic  stabilizers  on  the  revenue  side \nbut these are generally offset by the expenditure side so that the overall national primary budget \nbalance appears to be generally neutral to economic downturns. Figure A4.4 presents trends in \nthe Philippines' fiscal policy behavior over the economic cycle (as measured by the output gap). \nIt shows the percentage point changes in tax revenues to GDP since 1991 mapped against the \neconomic cycle. As is apparent from the figures, tax revenues tend to be moderately procyclical, \ni.e., tax collections grow more quickly than nominal GDP during higher growth periods (implying \nan increase in the tax ratio) and drop more quickly than nominal GDP during economic troughs \n(implying a fall in the tax ratio). Indirect taxes (excluding customs duties) levied on goods and \nservices  and  direct  income  taxes  generally  move  together  over  the  economic  cycle,  although \nchanges  in  direct  income  taxes  tend  to  carry  over  into  the  next  year  as  the  tax  code  permits \ncorporations to carry over losses to the succeeding fiscal year. The large drop in tax collections \nin the first 4 months of 2009 is consistent with this cyclical pattern. Tax (cash) collections from \nthe  Bureau  of  Internal  Revenue  (BIR)  fell  6.5%  on  a  year-on-year  basis.2 Customs  collection \n(duties and VAT on imported goods) from the Bureau of Customs (BOC) fell 12% for the same 4 \nmonths  on  a  year-on-year  basis  as  imports  plummeted.  The  13%  drop  in  VAT  collection  on \nimported  goods  was  the  major  contributor  to  the  fall  in  customs  revenue  during  this  period. \nBased on this cyclical pattern, and assuming only a gradual economic recovery in 2010, ADB \n\n                                                 \n2 The  increase  in  the  tax  bracket  threshold  for  wage  earners  introduced  in  July  2008  and  the  reduction  in  the \ncorporate tax rate from 35% to 30% effective in January 2009 will also lower income tax in 2009. DOF estimates \nthese measures will lower tax collection by up to P40 billion. \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nstaff  estimates  that  the  tax\u2013GDP  ratio  will  drop  in  2009  and  the  drop  in  the  direct  income  tax \nratio may also carry over into 2010. On the expenditure side of the budget, the ratio of primary \nexpenditures  to  GDP  (net  of  statutory  spending  such  as  interest  payments  and  transfers  to \nLGUs) do not exhibit a distinct cyclical pattern. However, in some periods a procyclical pattern is \nobserved,  because  it  appears  that  primary  expenditures  are  linked  to  performance  on  the \nrevenue  side,  so  when  revenues  rise  faster  than  nominal  GDP  (mainly  during  high  economic \ngrowth years), so does expenditure, and vice versa.  \n \n\nTable A4.1: Bureau of Customs Collections, 2007\u20132009 \n\nTotal collected  \n(P billion) \n\nGrowth \nrate  \n(%) \n\nItem \nTotal Collection \n  Import duties \n  Import tax \n      of which VAT \n\n2008\n70.6\n21.7\n48.9\n44.2\nNote: Import taxes refer to VAT and excise collected on imported goods. \nSource: Bureau of Customs, Department of Finance. \n\n2007 \n209.4 \n67.0 \n142.4 \n129.0 \n\n2008\n260.2\n88.4\n171.8\n156.3\n\n24.3\n31.9\n20.7\n21.2\n\nTotal collected for \nJanuary to April \n(P billion) \n\nGrowth \nrate  \n(%) \n(8.3) \n(4.5) \n(10.1) \n(12.9) \n\n2009 \n64.7 \n20.7 \n44.0 \n38.5 \n\n \nFiscal  stimulus  in  2009.  As  a  consequence  of  the  lack  of  automatic  stabilizers  in  the \n8. \nbudget, governments in developing countries tend to boost discretionary expenditures, such as \ninfrastructure spending, cash transfers to the poor, and other subsidies. The Government of the \nPhilippines has  provided  a  fiscal  stimulus  to  mitigate  the  impact  of  the  economic  downturn  on \nthe poor and to maintain priority spending programs in infrastructure and the social sectors. The \n2009  budget  stimulus  comes  from  a  substantial  boost  in  infrastructure  and  social  sector \nspending. In particular, the Government has increased allocations to social assistance programs \nto  mitigate  the  poverty  impacts  of  the  crisis.  These  include  scaling  up  coverage  of  the \nconditional  cash  transfer  (CCT)  program  from  20,000  households  in  2007  to  337,345  in  2008 \nand  2009  with  further  scaling  up  expected,  expanding  the  hunger-mitigation  program,  and \ndeveloping  the  Comprehensive  Livelihood  and  Emergency  Employment  Program  with  a  target \nof creating 373,117 jobs in 2009. The Government has also implemented several measures to \nensure the fiscal expansion is an effective stimulus for the economy. These include accelerating \ndisbursements  of  critical  public  spending,  promoting  advance  procurement,  and  front-loading \nsocial  and capital spending  by  60% in  the  first  semester  (P84  billion\u2013P112  billion).  It  has  also \nfocused  on  programs  that  are  quick-disbursing  and  labor-intensive,  and  that  have  larger \nmultiplier  effects.  These  measures  have  improved  utilization  rates  (ratio  of  disbursements  to \ncash releases to line ministries) from 80% in 2008 to 97% in the first quarter of 2009.  With the \nmodest  stimulus  and  projected  fall  in  budget  revenues  from  2009  budget  plan,  the  national \ngovernment deficit is projected to rise from P68 billion in 2008 to P250 billion in 2009. With the \ndownward revision in nominal GDP growth, the national government budget deficit is projected \nat  3.2%  of  GDP.  This  translates  to  a  fiscal  expansion  of  2.3%  of  GDP  over  2008  levels, \nrelatively modest compared with those in neighboring economies. \n\n \n\n\f      (a) Output Gap and Changes in the Tax Revenue\u2013GDP Ratio  \n\n          (b) Output Gap and Changes in Direct and Indirect Taxes\u2013GDP Ratio              \n\nFigure A4.4: Fiscal Policy Behavior over the Economic Cycle \n \n\nP\nD\nG\n%\n\n \n\nP\nD\nG\n%\n\n \n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n-3\n\n-4\n\n-5\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n-3\n\n-4\n\n-5\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n-3\n\n-4\n\n-5\n\nP\nD\nG\n%\n\n \n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n-3\n\n-4\n\n-5\n\n1\n9\n9\n1\n\n1\n9\n9\n2\n\n1\n9\n9\n3\n\n1\n9\n9\n4\n\n1\n9\n9\n5\n\n1\n9\n9\n6\n\n1\n9\n9\n7\n\n1\n9\n9\n8\n\n1\n9\n9\n9\n\n2\n0\n0\n0\n\n2\n0\n0\n1\n\n2\n0\n0\n2\n\n2\n0\n0\n3\n\n2\n0\n0\n4\n\n2\n0\n0\n5\n\n2\n0\n0\n6\n\n2\n0\n0\n7\n\n2\n0\n0\n8\n\n2\n0\n0\n9\n\n1\n9\n9\n1\n\n2\n9\n9\n1\n\n3\n9\n9\n1\n\n4\n9\n9\n1\n\n5\n9\n9\n1\n\n6\n9\n9\n1\n\n7\n9\n9\n1\n\n8\n9\n9\n1\n\n9\n9\n9\n1\n\n0\n0\n0\n2\n\n1\n0\n0\n2\n\n2\n0\n0\n2\n\n3\n0\n0\n2\n\n4\n0\n0\n2\n\n5\n0\n0\n2\n\n6\n0\n0\n2\n\n7\n0\n0\n2\n\n8\n0\n0\n2\n\n9\n0\n0\n2\n\n      \n      (c) Output Gap and Changes in NG Primary Expenditures\u2013GDP Ratio \n\n \n\n \n(d) Output and Changes in the NG Primary Budget Balance\u2013GDP Ratio \n\nOutput Gap\n\nTotal Tax Revenue\n\nOutput Gap\n\nIndirect Tax\n\nDirect Income Tax\n\nFiscal expansion\n\n1\n9\n9\n1\n\n1\n9\n9\n2\n\n1\n9\n9\n3\n\n1\n9\n9\n4\n\n1\n9\n9\n5\n\n1\n9\n9\n6\n\n1\n9\n9\n7\n\n1\n9\n9\n8\n\n1\n9\n9\n9\n\n2\n0\n0\n0\n\n2\n0\n0\n1\n\n2\n0\n0\n2\n\n2\n0\n0\n3\n\n2\n0\n0\n4\n\n2\n0\n0\n5\n\n2\n0\n0\n6\n\n2\n0\n0\n7\n\n2\n0\n0\n8\n\n2\n0\n0\n9\n\n1\n9\n9\n1\n\n1\n9\n9\n3\n\n1\n9\n9\n5\n\n1\n9\n9\n7\n\n1\n9\n9\n9\n\n2\n0\n0\n1\n\n2\n0\n0\n3\n\n2\n0\n0\n5\n\n2\n0\n0\n7\n\n2\n0\n0\n9\n\nOutput Gap\n\nPrimary Expenditure\n\nOutput gap\n\nNG Primary Fiscal Stance\n\nFiscal contraction\n\n     \nGDP = gross domestic product, NG = national government. \nSources: ADB; Bureau of Treasury; Department of Finance estimates.   \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n4\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n5\n7\n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n3. \n\nMedium-Term Fiscal Policy Issues \n\n \n9. \nConsiderable  fiscal  gains  have  been  achieved  since  2005,  and  fiscal  space  has  been \nprovided from increased tax revenues. Building on these is an important medium-term goal. In \nthe context of the current crisis and the Government's medium-term budget framework, the four \nmajor  medium-term  issues  are:  (i)  exploring  alternative  fiscal  rules  to  balance  the  budget, \n(ii)  sustaining  priority  spending  by  increasing  revenues,  (iii)  improving  the  efficiency  of  public \nexpenditure management, and (iv) better debt management practices. \n \n10. \nAlternative  fiscal  rules.  While  the  Government's  fiscal  policy  and  its  medium-term \ntarget of a balanced budget has served the Philippines very well in achieving consolidation, the \nglobal crisis has provided an opportunity to explore with stakeholders alternative fiscal rules. As \ndiscussed in paras. 8\u20139, in the past fiscal policy has not been effective in mitigating the effects \nof the economic cycle. In fact budget expenditures have at times exhibited a procyclical pattern. \nMoreover,  because  of  external  shocks  to  the  economy,  the  balanced  budget  target  has  been \nchanged three times since 2005, potentially undermining its credibility. An increasing number of \ncountries  have  adopted  fiscal  rules  to  anchor  fiscal  policy  and  these  rules  are  generally \nformalized  through  legislation  such  as  fiscal  responsibility  acts.  Rules  may  pertain  to  debt, \nbudget balances (overall or primary), expenditures, or some combination of these.3 For example, \nThailand does not set budget ceilings but anchors fiscal policy in debt rules set in legislation and \nMinistry  of  Finance  policy  guidelines  for  public  debt.  It  may  also  be  feasible  to  anchor  fiscal \npolicy to public debt rules in the Philippines. The post-program monitoring framework includes a \nmeasure to assess fiscal policy and explores the feasibility of formalizing fiscal rules.  \n \nSustaining  priority  spending. The Government\u2019s goal is to raise national government \n11. \nnoninterest  expenditures  by  an  additional  1  percentage  point  of  GDP  over  the  next  2  years \n(excluding countercyclical spending in 2009). To achieve this goal, the Government targets an \nincrease  in  tax  revenues  to  15%.  The  tax  revenue  target  is  achievable  over  the  medium  term \nbut  requires  greater  efforts.  Revenue  management  is  challenged  by  (i)  the  proliferation  of  tax \nincentives in growth sectors of the economy that may have resulted in as much as P47 billion in \nforegone  revenues;  (ii)  generous  income  tax  deductions  that  have  eroded  the  tax  base;  (iii)  a \npoorly  structured  excise  tax  regime;  and  (iv)  weak  tax  administration,  including  administering \nvalue added tax and modernizing business procedures and systems of revenue district offices \n(RDOs).  The  Government  is  systematically  addressing  these  issues.  The  Bureau  of  Internal \nRevenue  (BIR)  has  a  comprehensive  tax  administration  reform  program  to  2010  with  support \nfrom  the  World  Bank,  Swedish  International  Development  Agency,  and  ADB  (in  2008),  but \nimplementation  has  been  slower  than  expected.  This  is  partly  due  to  the  complexity  of  the \nreform  program  and  its  outreach  to  all  RDOs,  but  it  is  also  because  the  BIR  lacks  resources. \nNevertheless,  progress  has  been  made.  The  Government  has  allocated  an  additional  P1.0 \nbillion to its personnel budget and this could potentially increase staffing by 25%. Ninety-seven \npercent  of  all  uncomputerized  RDOs  have  now  been  computerized  and  the  backlog  of  tax \nregistrations and returns has been reduced, with over 350,000 tax registrations and 1.2 million \nin income return files encoded into the electronic system. The Government has also submitted \ndraft bills to Congress on amending excise tax legislation (submitted in 2008) and consolidating \ninvestment  incentives  (submitted  at  the  end  of  2007)  to  improve  revenue  sustainability.    Over \nthe longer term, the Government will need to continue to address budget resource allocations to \nthe  BIR  as  it  implements  its  tax  reforms  and  enhances  tax  administration  in  monitoring  tax \ncredits, managing tax arrears, tax audits, and anticorruption programs. Tax exemptions initiated \nby Congress have eroded the tax base in recent years. \n\n                                                 \n3 IMF. 2009. Philippines: 2008 Article IV Consultation\u2014Staff Report. IMF Country Report No. 09/62. Washington, DC. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n59\n\n \n12. \nPublic  financial  management.  Medium-term  sustainable  priority  spending  requires \nimproving  efficiency  in  public  expenditure  management  by  ensuring  a  balanced  public \nexpenditure  program  for  capital  spending  and  recurrent  expenditures,  as  well  as  for \ndiscretionary  and  nondiscretionary  spending  items  (interest  payments  and  wages).  This  will \nrequire  continuing  to  reorient  spending  to  the  priority  sectors  of  education,  health,  and  public \ninfrastructure.  Implementing  better  public  expenditure  management  systems,  including  the \nmedium-term  expenditure  framework,  which  align  the  budget  planning  process  with  strategic \nobjectives  and  priorities,  is  integral  to  improving  efficiency  in  public  expenditure  management. \nProgress is being made. The Department of Budget and Management (DBM) has incorporated \nthe  medium-term  framework  into  the  2009  and  2010  budgets,  including  updating  forward \nestimates  for  a  3-year  rolling  period  for  all  23  national  agencies.  It  is  now  computerizing  the \ncomputation  of  forward  estimates  before  rolling  it  out  to  priority  line  ministries.  The  DBM  has \nproduced national guidelines on internal audit systems and is currently piloting internal control \nsystems  in  the  DepEd  and  the  DPWH,  with  the  DSWD  and  the  Department  of  Labor  and \nEmployment  scheduled  for  later  in  2009.  However,  during  the  Development  Policy  Support \nProgram  (DPSP),  the  Government,  ADB,  and  other  development  partners  have  identified \nseveral  core  areas  that  need  to  be  addressed,  from  budget  preparation  through  to  budget \nexecution,  including  improving  cash  management  and  reporting,  which  will  require  a  much \nlonger-term, coordinated effort, and a platform approach to capacity development.  \n \n13. \nDebt  sustainability.  The  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  undertook  an  Article  IV \nConsultation with the Philippines in November 2008 (footnote 2). As part of its consultations, the \nIMF  undertook  a  debt  sustainability  assessment  (DSA)  based  on  different  economic  growth, \ninterest rate, primary budget balance, and exchange rate shocks. The IMF updated its DSA for \nthe purposes of the DPSP 3. This appendix summarizes the pertinent findings of the DSA. \n \n14. \nThe  Philippines'  public  sector  debt  is  broadly  sustainable,  but  short-term  risks  have \nincreased due to global financial instability. Public debt as a share of GDP has declined to ratios \nlast  seen  in  the  early  1990s,  but  remains  high  by  regional  standards.  At  the  end  of  2008, \nnational government public debt amounted to 56% of GDP, down from its peak of 83% in 2003 \n(Figure A3). Nonfinancial public sector (NFPS) debt declined to 59.9% from 101.0% during the \nsame  period  (Figure  A3).  A  prudent  borrowing  strategy,  including  lengthening  the  average \nmaturity  of  debt  to  7.1  years  and  moving  to  domestic  financing;4  fiscal  discipline  (operating \nprimary  budget  surpluses);  and  sustained  economic  growth  contributed  to  the  rapid  decline. \nDebt  servicing  costs  as  a  share  of  national  government  budget  revenues  also  declined  from \n36.7% in 2005 to 22.6% in 2007, thereby freeing up substantial resources for priority spending \nsince 2007. However, at 8% of GDP, the Philippines\u2019 public debt servicing costs (amortization \nand interest payments) are high by regional standards.  \n \nThe  updated  IMF  DSA  indicates  that  public  sector  debt  is  broadly  sustainable.  In  the \n15. \nbaseline  scenario,  no  new  fiscal  measures  are  introduced  over  the  medium  term  apart  from \nplanned  reduction  of  the  corporate  income  tax  rate  in  2009.  In  this  scenario,  the  nonfinancial \nsector  public  debt  initially  rises  to  about  65%  in  2009/2010  and  then  declines  back  to  60%  of \nGDP  in  2014.  While  debt  dynamics  are  favorable  overall,  they  remain  vulnerable  to  shocks, \nespecially exchange rate fluctuations, as 40% of public debt is external. For example, the IMF \nsimulated a one-time permanent real depreciation of 30%, which led to a 20 percentage point \nincrease in the external debt ratio from 2009, which would remain close to 80% in the medium \n\n                                                 \n4  Share of foreign currency denominated debt in total NFPS debt fell from 68.3% in 2003 to 36.1% in 2008. \n \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nterm. The assessment also notes rising resilience to interest rate and growth shocks. Given the \nlengthening  of  maturities  and  increasing  utilization  of  domestic  financing,  external  debt  is  less \naffected  by world  interest  rates  and  domestic  growth  shocks.  It  is  only moderately  affected  by \nnoninterest shocks to the current account. The DSA also simulates the impact of lower primary \nbudget surpluses on debt over the medium term. It assumes a reduction in the average surplus \nfrom  2.7%  of  GDP  to  1.3%.  Under  this  scenario,  the  NFPS  debt  would  be  64%  in  2014.  The \nvarious scenarios are summarized in Table A4.2, with the baseline NFPS debt at 60% of GDP \nby 2014. \n  \n\nTable 4A.2: Public Debt Sustainability: Bound Tests (%) \n\nScenario \n1.

The fiscal \ndeficit is projected to be 3.2% in 2009 (revised in June 2009 up from 2.2% in February 2009). \nThe Government's medium-term fiscal projections are 2.0% in 2010, 1.5% in 2011, and 0.5% in \n2012, consistent with the need to ensure longer-term debt sustainability. The fiscal consolidation \nis  primarily  driven  by  a  stronger  revenue  effort,  with  tax  revenues  projected  to  rise  by  about \n1.0%  of  GDP  over  the  next  3  years  and  cut  back  in  temporary,  countercyclical  expenditures. \nThe  national  government  debt  would  rise  a  little  to  57.6%  in  2009  and  58%\u201359%  in  2010 \nensuring sustainable debt and providing a buffer in the event of future shocks to the economy. \nWhile  the  scenario  is  indicative,  it  does  demonstrate  the  need  to  continue  increasing  the \nrevenue effort. \n \n17. \nThe  Government  has  outlined  a  strategy  to  support  a  sustainable  adjustment  in  fiscal \npolicy  for  2009\u20132013  and  measures  to  improve  public expenditure  management  supported  by \nthe DPSP. The Government will \n\n(i) \n\ncontinue  to  implement  tax  policy  reforms  to  enhance  the  revenue  system  by \nbroadening  the  tax  base,  rationalizing  income  tax  incentives  and  excise  taxes, \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n61\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nincluding  through  a  revised  tax  incentives  rationalization  bill  submitted  to \nCongress  at  the  end  of  2007  (progress  has  been  made  in  deliberations  and \nCongress is expected to pass the bill in 2009\u2014its revenue effects will not begin \nto be realized until 2010) and draft amendments to excise legislation submitted to \nCongress  at  the  end  of  2008  (including  reducing  the  number  of  bands  and \nindexing specific taxes to inflation);  \nstrengthen  tax  administration,  including  by  completing  the  update  of  taxpayer \nregistration;  reduce  the  backlog  of  tax  return  files  and  tax  number  applications, \nimproving registration processes and production of a registration, audit strategies, \nmanagement of arrears, and tracking and monitoring of tax credits; \nincrease spending on the social sectors and public infrastructure in the 2008 and \n2009 budgets; \nstrengthen debt management systems to bring them in line with international best \npractice  including  establishing  a  debt  and  risk management  division  to  act  as  a \nmiddle function office at DOF; \ncontinue to implement a rolling 3-year, medium-term expenditure framework and \ncomputation of forward estimates; and \nimplement  a  program  to  strengthen  budget  execution  including  initiating \ndevelopment  of  the  government  financial  management  information  system,  and \nthe rollout of internal control systems with technical assistance from ADB, among \nothers.  \n\n \n \nTable A4.3: Philippines\u2014National Government Fiscal Program \n(% of GDP) \n\n2008 \n0.4 \n\nFiscal Target \n2009 \n\u2015 \n\n \n Indicator \nNonfinancial Sector Public Deficit \n  National Government Budget Deficit \n\n  National Government Budget Deficit \n\n(DOF definition) \n\n(IMF definition) a \n\nRevenues (excluding grants) \nTax Revenue \nNontax Revenue \n of which privatizations \n of which privatizations (P billion) \nExpenditure and Net Lending  \n of which non-interest expenditures \n of which infrastructure  \n \nMemorandum Items \n \n Nonfinancial Public Sector Debt \n National Government Debt \n\nthe central bank.  \n\n2004 \n(5.0) \n\n2005 \n(2.1) \n\nActuals \n2006 \n0.1 \n\n(3.8) \n\n(2.7) \n\n(1.1) \n\n(4.2) \n14.5 \n12.5 \n2.0 \n0.0 \n0.4 \n18.3 \n12.9 \n1.3 \n \n \n \n96.0 \n78.5 \n\n(3.0) \n15.1 \n13.0 \n2.1 \n0.0 \n2.4 \n17.8 \n12.2 \n1.5 \n \n \n \n87.0 \n71.8 \n\n(1.2) \n16.2 \n14.3 \n1.9 \n0.1 \n5.8 \n17.3 \n12.2 \n1.6 \n \n \n \n74.0 \n63.8 \n\n2007 \n0.4 \n \n(0.2) \n \n(1.7) \n17.1 \n14.0 \n3.1 \n1.4 \n90.6 \n17.3 \n12.6 \n2.0 \n \n \n \n67.0 \n55.8 \n\n(0.9) \n \n(1.5) \n16.0 \n14.0 \n2.0 \n0.4 \n31.3 \n16.9 \n13.2 \n \n \n \n \n61.0 \n56.3 \n\n( ) = negative, \u2015 = no available data, DOF = Department of Finance, IMF = International Monetary Fund. \na Fund definition: Excludes privatization receipts of the national government and includes net deficit from restructuring \n\nSources: Department of Finance. 2009.

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the Philippines: The Development Policy Support Program \n(DPSP)  policy  areas  largely  correspond  with  those  of  the  Government  as  spelled  out  in  the  Medium-Term  Philippine \nDevelopment Plan (MTPDP) 2004\u20132010, which focuses on five core areas: (i) economic growth and job creation; (ii) energy \ndependency  and  power  sector  reforms;  (iii)  social  justice  and  basic  needs;  (iv)  education  and  youth  opportunities;  and \n(v) anticorruption measures and governance. The MTPDP mission is to \u201cfight poverty by building prosperity for the greatest \nnumber of Filipino people.\u201d  \n \nThe  focus  of  ADB's  Country  Strategy  and  Program  (CSP)  and  the  country  operations  business  plan  (COBP)  for  the \nPhilippines  is  on  fiscal  consolidation,  an  improved  investment  climate,  and  accelerated    progress  toward  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), as confirmed by the country assistance program evaluation (CAPE) for the Philippines and an \nADB  study  on  the  critical  development  constraints  in  the  country.  The  Government  has  made  substantial  progress  in \naddressing  fiscal  consolidation.    This  is  necessary  to  increase  social  expenditures.  However,  the  global  financial  crisis  and \nsecond-round external demand destruction has hurt the Philippines and has had fiscal repercussions. Pressures on the fiscal \nsituation are exerted from two sources. On the one hand, there are increased public demands for additional social spending to \nmitigate the impact of the crisis on poverty. On the other, there was a decline in budget revenues in the first semester of 2009. \nThe  challenge  faced  by  the  Government  is  to  protect  recent  gains  in  social  expenditures  while  also  providing  additional \nassistance through its social programs such as the CCT program; carrying out a fiscal stimulus through increase infrastructure \nspending;  and  ensuring  medium-term  debt  sustainability.  Consequently,  the  national  government  budget  deficit  will  rise  to \n3.2%  of  GDP  in  2009  and  2%  in  2010.  The  DPSP  will  contribute  to  measures  to  protect  critical  public  spending  and  at  the \nsame time will ensure ensures fiscal discipline.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \n1.  Key Issues  \nThe  deceleration  in  the  Philippine  economy  threatens  to  reverse  recent  gains  in  reducing  unemployment,  which  has  been \nsteadily declining in the last 2 years. Most recently, it has increased from 7.3% in 2008 to 7.6% in 2009. Other indicators point \nto the adverse effects of the crisis on the labor market. Economic growth in 2009 is estimated in the range of 0.8%\u20131.8%, this \ntranslates to a decline in per capita incomes of \u20131.7% to \u20130.7%. This would result in an increase in the incidence of poverty. If \nremittances  fall  this  would  also  increase  poverty.  To  mitigate  the  impacts  of  the  crisis,  the  Government  has  piloted  the \nconditional cash transfer (CCT) program to 337,345 families in 2008 and 2009. This is likely to cushion the impact on poverty \nin the same way as Indonesia's unconditional cash transfer scheme.  \n \n2. Design Features. With support through the DPSP, the Government is addressing these issues of poverty and vulnerability \nto poverty by reforming social protection programs, scaling up the CCT program, increasing spending on the social sectors, \ninfrastructure,  and  labor-intensive  public  employment  programs  (such  as  the  Comprehensive  Livelihood  and  Emergency \nEmployment Program). \n \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \nThe DPSP supports the Government to address these issues through the program\u2019s public financial management and social \nsector  components.  Under  subprogram  3,  additional  policy  triggers  were  introduced  specifically  to  mitigate  the  poverty \nimpacts  of  the  current  global  crisis.  The  DPSP  supports  increased  spending  on  the  social  sectors  in  areas  where  the \nPhilippines  is  lagging  in  progress  toward  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs),  for  example  in  education.  It  also \nsupports the piloting and scaling up of the CCT program, which links assistance with outcomes in family education and health. \nThe DPSP also supports the public employment program; and the speeding up of disbursements of critical public spending \nand advancing procurement process through Department of Budget and Management crisis-related initiatives. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n63\n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nFindings of Social Analysis  \nADB  assessments  suggest  that  the  possible  decline  in  per  capita  incomes  in  2009  and  increased  unemployment  will \nexacerbate the economic downturn. Empirical analysis, on the whole, shows that in the Philippines the impact on poverty will \nbe short-term (1\u20133 years) assuming the economy begins to recover in 2010.  If the global economy is slow to recover, or the \ndomestic recovery is weak, poverty and unemployment effects will manifest themselves over a longer period. The magnitude \nof  the  recovery  and  growth  of  remittances  from  overseas  Filipino  workers  will  be  critical.  As  of  June  of  2009,  remittances \nremain  flat  and  are  expected  to  decline  in  the  range  of  2%\u20134%  in  second  semester  of  2009.  However,  a  disconcerting \nprospect is a  possible substantial  downward revision in the global economic outlook for 2009\u20132010,  which  would  affect the \nprospects for exports and remittances. \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\nAs part of the DPSP process, extensive consultations were held with a wide range of stakeholders, including representatives \nof  the  private  sector,  civil  society  groups,  and  development  partners.  The  key  forum  is  the  Philippines  Development  Forum \n(PDF)  which  meets  twice  a  year,  although  smaller  groups  meet  more  often.  Under  a  technical  assistance  project  for \ncompetitiveness  (attached  to  DPSP  subprogram  1),  ADB  engaged  a  research  institute  to  carry  out  a  survey  of  500 \nhouseholds and 1,300 individuals in February 2009 to solicit information on income, expenditure and employment experience. \nA second survey of the same households and an additional 500 will be carried out in July 2009 for the same purpose and to \nsolicit information about the impact of the crisis on household welfare and specific social sector issues related to health and \neducation. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \nIf  a  C&P  plan  was  prepared,  describe  key  features  and  resources  provided  to  implement  the  plan  (including  budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why.  \n\n Yes    \n\n No  \n\nC.   Gender and Development \n\nKey Issues. The DPSP has indirect gender impacts through its emphasis on reducing poverty and unemployment by \nreorienting public expenditures to social services and productive needs. The improved poverty orientation of public spending \nincreases women\u2019s access to essential services needed for achieving MDG targets, including improving child and maternal \nhealth.  \n2.

Partial accomplishment  \n\n(i) cleaning the corporate taxpayers \ndatabase and (ii) encoding of \nbacklog of tax registration and tax \nreturn files. \n\nPerformance \n \n1. Accomplished. PSC budget in surplus equivalent to 0.4% of GDP \n\n(January to November 2008). \n\n3. Implementation ongoing. In June 2009, the DOF issued a department \norder establishing the DRMD as a middle office. It was issued subject \nto DBM's approval of DOF's rationalization plan, of which approval is \nexpected in 2009. ADB will provide technical assistance to the DRMD \nto support capacity building and staff training under the second TA \nproject.  \n\n(i) Encoding backlog of tax data\u2014substantially accomplished. By the \n\nend of 2008, 71 (97%) of the remaining 75 RDOs had been \ncomputerized. The four remaining uncomputerized RDOs in southern \nMindanao will be completed when security conditions permit. Of the 35 \nUSAID and MCC-assisted RDOs, 27 have completed the encoding of a \nbacklog of tax information, and encoding in 11 MCC-assisted RDOs \nongoing. Encoding includes 348,465 tax registrations, 1,235,889 \nincome tax returns, and 2,275,103 PDES. The BIR plans to complete \nthe encoding in the 11 RDOs and start encoding in the remaining 36 in \n2009. \n\n(ii) Cleaning corporate taxpayers database\u2014partially accomplished \nand ongoing. Some progress was made in cleaning the corporate \ntaxpayers' database in 2008 and this remains ongoing. Under the \nDPSP subprogram 2, the BIR had identified 125,563 inactive taxpayers \nin the registry (taxpayers who had not filed an income return for the last \n3 years) and 9,429 SEC-registered corporations not registered with the \nBIR. Under subprogram 3 these will be validated as part of cleaning the \ntax registration database; inactive corporations and duplications will be \nremoved, and unregistered corporations registered and penalized). The \nBIR contracted a civil society organization to undertake this activity \nunder the World Bank tax administration reform project. As of \nSeptember 2008, only about 47% of the corporations had been \nvalidated by the CSO. About 10% (or 6,956) were reported as \noperational, 68% nonexistent, and 17% had invalid addresses. With a \nlimited budget to carry out the activity (less than P50 per validation, \nwhich required transport to the identified address, verification that the \ntaxpayer still resides at the address, photographs as evidence of the \nfield visit, and a copy of the barangay certificate of premises) the \ncontract was incomplete, with only 47% of corporations validated. The \nBIR instructed RDOs to complete the validation and cleaning process \nbut progress has been slow since then. In hindsight, it would have \nbeen more effective if the activity started with the 9,429 SEC registered \ncorporations, since this is where the biggest gains in tax collection are \nlikely.    \n\n5. Forward estimates produced by \n\n5. Accomplished. The Government updated and produced forward \n\nDBM staff with increasing \ninvolvement of departments and \nagencies \n\nestimates for all line ministries for the 2009 budget. The DMB carried \nout consultations with line ministries to formulate the forward estimates. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f66 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nOriginal Triggers as Specified in \nthe Subprogram 2 Document \n(Appendix 2, Table A2.2) \n \n\n6. Initiate development of GIFMIS \n\nstarting with a diagnostic study of \nthe scope and requirements  \n\nPerformance \n \n \n\n6. Accomplished. The DBM initiated development of the GFMIS, starting \nwith a diagnostic study of the scope and requirements with assistance \nfrom the US Trade and Development Agency. The study also sketches \nout a road map for implementing an integrated GFMIS. The study was \ncompleted in June 2009. The DBM organized a series of workshops in \nJuly to discuss the findings. It intends to arrange for an MOU with the \nBureau of Treasury (DOF) and COA to establish a task force for \ndeveloping an action plan under the post-program monitoring \nframework. ADB is providing technical assistance to the DBM on the \nGFMIS action plan.  \n\n7. Accomplished. Guidelines for internal control systems produced, \nprinted and disseminated to agencies, GOCCs, and LGUs. With \nassistance from AusAID (Philippines-Australia Partnership for \nEconomic Governance Reforms), two internal control systems in \nministry pilots (DepEd and DPWH) started in the fourth quarter of 2008, \nand are expected to be completed in 2010 at a cost of almost A$3.3 \nmillion.  \n\n8. Accomplished.  Through a revenue administrative order (RAO No 10-\n\n2009), the BIR has transformed the Enforcement Service to an \nEnforcement and Advocacy Service (EAS) under the Legal Division. \nThe EAS has four divisions, with the Special Prosecution Division \n(SPD) tasked to handle prosecution of RATE cases. There are 23 \npositions designated under the new SPD. In July 2009, the DBM \napproved the BIR's plan for the EAS. In anticipation of the approval of \nthe plan, the 2009 national government budget allocated an additional \nP1.0 billion to the BIR for new technical positions; about 3,000 new \npositions nationwide will be funded under this additional budget. Under \nMCC assistance, which was completed in December 2008, BIR staff \nwere trained in tax evasion investigations, toolkits were provided and \nguidelines were produced.  \n\n9.  Substantially accomplished.  Progress has been made in the \n\nPhilGEPS second year of operation in raising levels of compliance with \nthe 2003 law on procurement (RA 9184): (i) all 12 GPPB member \nagencies have posted bid opportunities and award notices, compared \nwith 9 in 2007; (ii) 9 of the 12 GPPB member agencies increased of the \nnumber of bid notices posted in 2008, compared with 2007, and 8 out \nof 12 agencies posted more award notices in 2008 than they did in \n2007; and (iii) progress was made in expanding outreach to non-GPPB \nmembers with the Department of Agriculture, DSWD, DENR and BIR \nall posting some bid notices and awards on PhilGEPS for the first time \nin 2008.  \n\noperations in 2008, with CSOs and GOP representatives appointed to \nthe group. Group members have identified the infrastructure projects \nthey intend to track, monitoring is under way, and regular updates are \nposted on the group's website. Regular group meetings are held with \nthe GPPB.  \n\n11. Implementation ongoing. A memorandum order was submitted to \nthe President's office for approval in July 2009. The memorandum \nmandates NEDA to advocate a regulatory impact assessment program \nand develops an action plan for implementing it across national \nagencies. The accomplishment of this trigger has taken longer than \nexpected because of resistance from some line ministries with \nregulatory power. The ministries were not familiar with the regulatory \n\n7. National guidelines for internal \n\ncontrol standards formulated and \npiloting in one department and one \nagency started. \n\n8. Institutionalize the RATE program by \nstrengthening the RATE Program \nwith permanent staff, budget, \noperational procedures and \nguidelines, and training program. \n\n9. Ensure all publicly bid opportunities \nand awards of central offices of the \n12 GPPB member departments plus \nthree non-GPPB members (DA, \nDSWD, DENR) posted on PhilGEPS \nin compliance with RA 9184. \n\nProcurement Transparency Group \nand start tracking selected \ninfrastructure projects  \n\n11. Adopt an action plan for \n\nimplementing a regulatory review \nprocess. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n10. Operationalization of the \n\n10. Accomplished.  The Procurement Transparency Group began \n\n\fOriginal Triggers as Specified in \nthe Subprogram 2 Document \n(Appendix 2, Table A2.2) \n\nPerformance \n \n\n     Appendix 6           67 \n\nimpact assessment (RIA) or its implications for their business operating \nprocedures, so NEDA carried out extensive and often drawn out \nconsultations with key line ministries to achieve some measure of \nsupport. NEDA's job was made harder as its mandate as chair of the \nRIA working group under the National Competitiveness Council was to \ndevelop a strategic framework for the RIA. It did not have a legal \nmandate to implement or advocate RIA implementation in other line \nministries Thus, the first step of NEDA's new mandate will be to \nadvocate RIA, build support for it, develop capacity to implement the \nRIA, and to facilitate the design and development of an RIA action plan \nand timeframe for its implementation.  \n\n12. Accomplished. The  Government stakeholders of the PDF working \n\ngroup on sustainable rural development/ subworking group on \nagribusiness held a strategic agribusiness planning workshop in March \n2009 to discuss formulation of the Strategic Agribusiness Development \nPlan. Discussions focused around bottlenecks in agriculture, including \nproduction, post-production, marketing, distribution, and financing. \nRecommendations were provided and action plans were produced. \n\n13. Accomplished.  The DSWD had scaled up the CCT program to cover \n337,345 households by end of 2008. Each household receives P1,400 \nper month per household.  \n\n14. Accomplished. These measures included (i) the issuance of a DBM \ncircular letter (No. 2008-11, dated December 2008) shifting from a \nquarterly cash release to a 6-month cash release and requiring line \nministries to spend each month\u2019s cash allocation or lose it; and (ii) a \nGPPB circular to line ministries clarified that ministries can start the \nprocurement process before receiving allotments from the DBM \n(authority to obligate the budget) but the signing of contracts will \nrequire receipt of these allotments. \n\n15. Accomplished. Congress passed and the President enacted a law to \n\nincrease the ceiling on the deposit insurance from P250,000 to \nP500,000 to enhance depositors' confidence in the domestic banking \nsystem.  \n\nthe DPSP and in response to the poverty impacts of the global \neconomic recession. The technical committee on poverty statistics of \nthe NSCB produced a draft of the poverty monitoring mechanism to \nprovide timely data and assessments of the impact of the economic \nslow down and other external shocks on the poor that would allow \ntimely response by authorities (June 2009).

This TA is the second of a series of three TA projects to \nsupport the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) and Department of Finance (Debt \nand  Risk  Management  Division,  DRMD)  and  Bureau  of  Treasury  in  implementing  and \nmonitoring  key  public  financial  management  reforms  with  a  focus  on  enhancing  cash \nmanagement,  budget  execution,  accounting,  recording,  and  reporting  and  to  strengthen  debt \nmanagement systems. The first TA project laid out the building blocks for developing an action \nplan and implementation timeframe for an integrated government financial management system \n(GFMIS),  provided  assistance  for  the  piloting  of  an  internal  control  system,  and  other  related \nareas  in  budget  execution.  The  second  TA  project  builds  on  the  GFMIS  and  focuses  on  the \nimplementing budget execution reforms needed for an integrated GFMIS, assistance for better \ncash revenue forecasting; capacity development support for the newly established debt and risk \nmanagement division; and a rollout of internal control system at the national level. All supporting \nmeasures  have  been  agreed  as  part  of  the  post-program  monitoring  framework.  The  third  TA \nproject  will  build  on  activities  under  the  second  TA  project,  including  an  integrated  GFMIS, \nrollout  of  internal  control  systems,  debt  management  and  cash  revenue  forecasting.  It  is \nintended  that  at  the  end  of  the  series  of  TA  projects,  the  DBM  will  be  in  a  position  to  have  a \nlong-term  public  financial  management  reform  strategy  and  to  fund  the  implementation  of  an \nintegrated  GFMIS  (Figure  A8).  The  scope  of  the  TA  parallels  the  DPSP,  covering  the \ngovernance  and  public  financial  management  component,  and  impact  and  outcomes  listed  in \nthe design and monitoring framework in Appendix 1. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nMedium-term  sustainable  priority  spending  requires  more  efficient  public  financial \nmanagement.  The  key  challenges  for  the  Government  are  to  strengthen  cash  management \npractices  at  the  Bureau  of  Treasury,  balance  the  public  expenditure  program  between  capital \nspending  and  recurrent  expenditures,  as  well  as  between  discretionary  and  nondiscretionary \nspending  items  (local  government  unit  transfers,  wages,  and  interest  payments);  and  to \nimplement \nthose  on  debt \nfinancial  management  systems, \nmanagement. The key public financial management issues were comprehensively discussed in \nthe main text of the RRP (paras. 22\u201328). This section briefly notes the key issues that are or will \nbe addressed by the three TA projects.  \n \n3. \nDebt  management.  The  debt  management  systems  at  the  DOF  are  fragmented,  with \nseparate  units  at  the  Bureau  of  Treasury,  Corporate  Affairs  (covering  contingent  liabilities  of \ngovernment-owned  and  controlled  corporations  and  others),  and  the  International  Finance \nGroup  (covering  official  development  assistance  and  international  commercial  borrowings). \nMonitoring  of  contingent  liabilities  under  the  build\u2013operate\u2013transfer  law  is  done  through  the \nis  not \nInfrastructure  Coordination  Committee.  Consequently,  debt  management \nNEDA \nconducted  within  an  integrated  debt  framework  as  suggested  by  best  international  practice. \nThere  is  no  integrated  debt  management  strategy  and  debt  sustainability  assessments  do  not \naccompany the proposed budget plan. The software is outdated, although the DOF does plan to \nupgrade its system. Under subprogram 3, the DOF approved the establishment of the DRMD, \nwhich will function as a middle office to undertake public debt policy formulation and analysis. \nCapacity  development  of  the  division  requires  longer-term  support  in  the  form  of  staff  training \n\nimproved  public \n\nincluding \n\nIssues \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n71\n\nand policy advisory assistance to develop a debt management strategy and to carry out public \ndebt  analysis  and  a  bi-semester  debt  sustainability  assessment.  Under  the  post-program \nmonitoring  framework,  it  is  anticipated  that  the  DRMD  will  formulate  a  debt  management \nstrategy in 2010. The second TA project will support this effort. \n \n4. \nBudget execution and controls. There are several gaps in budget execution that need \nto  be  addressed  in  the  short  and  long  terms.  These  include  weaknesses  in  recording  and \nmanagement of cash balances, as more than one treasury account makes reconciling balances \ndifficult.  The  monthly  (and  even  daily)  cash  forecasting  capabilities  of  the  Bureau  of  Treasury \nare limited and are not integrated with the revenue forecasts made by the BIR. Current reporting \narrangements  make  it  difficult  to  reconcile  the  budget  allocation  releases  and  actual \nexpenditures  incurred  by  agencies  because  of  differences  in  accounting  formats  used  by  the \nDBM and the chart of accounts used by the Commission of Audit (COA). \n \n5. \nInternal controls system. Development of internal control and internal audit systems in \nspending  agencies  is  an  essential  element  of  budget  execution  and  financial  reporting.  There \nare weaknesses in payroll controls and internal controls for nonsalary expenditures and a lack \nof  independent,  internal  audits  within  line  ministries.  Until  recently,  there  have  been  no \nguidelines  for  internal  control  systems  for  line  agencies  to  follow  and  not  all  agencies  have \nestablished  independent  internal  audit  units.  With  assistance  from  the  Australian  Agency  for \nInternational  Development  (AusAID),  the  DBM  has  produced  internal  control  guidelines  and \npiloted  them  in  two  ministries.  ADB  supporting  two  additional  pilots  at  the  Department  of \nEnvironment  and  Natural  Resources  (DENR)  and  the  Department  of  Labor  and  Employment \n(DOLE). The Government intends to complete the rollout of internal control systems to national \nagencies over the next 3 years.  \n \n6. \nBudget accounting, recording, and reporting.  Accounts reconciliation, in-year budget \nreports  on  obligations,  cash  releases  and  allotments,  obligations,  and  disbursements  are  not \ndone on time, and thus do not allow effective tracking of budget efficiency indicators. The key \nunderlying cause of weaknesses in budget execution, recording, and reporting is the absence of \nan  integrated  government  financial  management  information  system  (GFMIS).  The  current \nmanual  recording  of  accounts  payable  results  in  frequent  reporting  delays  from  line  ministries \nand  regions  to  the  DBM.  With  assistance  from  the  US  Trade  and  Development  Agency,  the \nGovernment  has  completed  an  analysis  of  the  GFMIS  at  the  DBM  and  line  ministries,  and \nprovided  a  tentative  costing  of  rolling  out  an  integrated  GFMIS  nationally.    The  DBM  has  also \nbegun consultations with stakeholders and development partners on a strategy for the future. It \nis  important  for  the  key  agencies\u2014COA,  DBM  and  DOF\u2014to  establish  a  consensus  on  a  way \nforward  for  integrating  the  fragmented  GFMIS.  This  will  require  a  formal  coordinated  effort  by \nkey government agencies, with longer- term support from development partners. ADB technical \nassistance  is  being  provided  to  the  DBM  to  support  it  in  developing  a  GFMIS  road  map  with \nclear targets and monitoring. This reform is included in the post-program monitoring framework. \n \nC. \n \nThe  TA  supports  a  core  element  of  the  Government\u2019s  public  financial  management \n7. \nreform  agenda.  Under  the  DPSP  cluster  the  Government  is  committed  to  (i)  rolling  out  the \nMTEF, (ii) initiating development of the GFMIS, (iii) piloting and then rolling out internal control \nand audit to national line agencies, and (iv) enhancing budget transparency and reporting. The \nDOF has issued a department order establishing the DRMD, which will oversee development of \nthe debt management strategy and policies related to debt management such as guidelines on \ndebt  tenures.  The  TA  complements  another  ADB  TA  on  enhancing  tax  revenue  collection, \n\nDevelopment Partners'  Coordination \n\n \n\n\f72 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nto  upgrade \n\nthe  revenue-forecasting  capabilities  at \n\nthe \nincluding  providing  assistance \nDepartment  of  Finance.  It  also  complements  the  activities  of  other  development  partners, \nincluding  AusAID  and  the  World  Bank.  AusAID  has  a  large  grant  assisting  the  DBM  with  the \ncomputation  of  forward  estimates  under  the  MTEF  and  development  of  guidelines  for  the \ninternal control systems. These initiatives are being piloted at the DepEd and the DPWH. The \nICS will be piloted in DSWD. A small World Bank grant is supporting the drafting of the DBM\u2019s \nbudget strategy paper and the Public Expenditure Accountability Financial (PEFA) report. ADB \nhas worked closely with other development partners in preparing the TA, and will continue to do \nso during implementation. ADB is collaborating with AusAID on the internal control systems and \nit  will  pilot  the  internal  control  systems  at  DOLE  and  the  DENR.  Informally,  the  development \npartners have agreed that AusAID will coordinate the activities of the development partners and \ndisseminate information on public financial management activities and issues identification.   \n \n\n2. \n\nTechnical Assistance \n\na. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n8. \nThe  TA  will  support  the  DPSP  cluster  by  (i)  enhancing  cash  management  practices, \nbudget  execution,  accounting,  recording,  and  reporting;  (ii)  initiating  the  development  of  an \nintegrated GFMIS; and (iii) strengthening debt management practices. \n \n9. \nThe  impacts  of  the  TA  will  be  an  enhanced  public  financial  management  system  with \nbetter budget transparency and efficiency. Over the longer term, these reforms will improve the \nsustainability of priority spending.    \n \n\nb. \n\nMethodology and Key Activities \n\nThe key TA activities are divided into three components: \n\n10. \n \n11. \nImplement public expenditure management reforms. This component will support the \nDBM and the Bureau of Treasury with budget execution reforms. Activities include assistance to \nthe  Bureau  of  Treasury  to  strengthen  cash  management  practices  and  cash  forecasting, \nassistance to the DBM to streamline budget execution procedures; and support for the rollout of \ninternal  control  systems,  starting  with  a  pilot  in  2009  and  a  full  rollout  in  2010  and  2011.  The \ncomponent will fund training in improving budget execution.  \n \nDevelop a government financial management information system. This component \n12. \nwill build on the results of diagnostic work on a GFMIS that will be undertaken by DBM in 2008 \nand  2009.  It  will  support  the  activities  of  the  interagency  task  force  on  the  integrated  GFMIS, \nincluding  the  design  and  implementation  of  a  road  map  for  developing  an  integrated  GFMIS \nwithin the national government.  \n \n13. \nDebt management practices. This component will assist the newly created DRMD with \ncapacity  development.  It  will  (i)  assist  with  development  of  a  debt  management  strategy  and \npolicies;  (ii)  sketch  out  a  longer-term  capacity  development  program  for  an  integrated  debt \nmanagement office; and (iii) provide training to staff of the DRMD.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nADB \ntechnical \nassistance \nfor PFM \n\nFigure A8: Public Financial Management Systems, Philippines \n\nSupports Aggregate Fiscal Discipline \n\nStrategic Allocation of Resources \n\nEffective Service Delivery\n\nCentral to country system of \ngovernance and accountability \n\nUnderpin Poverty Reduction \nStrategies\n\nBudget Planning \n\nBudget Execution\n\nAccounting and Reporting\n\nExternal Scrutiny and Audit\n\n \nPEFA \nPrinciples \n\n- Strategic Policy Objectives and \n\n- Macro Forecasting and Fiscal \n\nPlanning \n\nEnvelope \n\n- MTEF \n- Annual Budget \n- Revenue Management \n- Debt Management Strategy \n\n- Treasury and Cash \n\nManagement \n\n- Payroll and Human  \n- Resource Management \n- Procurement \n- Management control and \n\nInternal Audit \n\n- Chart of Accounts and \nBudget Classification \nSystem \n\n- Accounting Standards \n- Debt and Aid \nManagement \n\n- GIFMIS \n \n\n- Oversight by Supreme Audit \n\n- Legislative Review and \n\nInstitution \n\nscrutiny \n\n- Civil Society Monitoring \n- Procurement Watch \n\n \nPhilippines \nKey \nReforms \n\n- Paper on Budget Strategy \n\n(PBS), MTEF rolling out, and \nforward estimates used for \nFY 2008/9/10 Budgets \n\n- Organizational Performance \nIndicator Framework (OPIF) \nimplemented \n\n- PFM Manual Developed \n\n- Cutting edge procurement reform \nlaw with PHILGEPS implemented \nto enhance transparency and \ncompetition \n\n- Internal control systems guidelines \n\nproduced and 2 internal control \nsystems pilots (DepEd and \nDPWH) \n\n- Rationalization Program underway \n\n- Chart of Accounts set by \n\nCOA \n\n- Accounting Statement \nformat set by DBM \n\n- The Commission on Audit (COA) \n\nconstitutionally independent \n\n- Annual Audit Reports for FY1998 to FY2008 \n\npublished \n\n- Institutionalizing anticorruption programs at \n\nBIR and BOC underway. \n\n- Large CS) community and the Procurement \n\nTransparency Group established under the law \nmonitor procurement \n\n \nWeakness \n\n- Budget process characterized by \nsignificant degree of executive \nprerogative and special purpose \nappropriations \n\n- Budget integration not fully \n\n- Debt Management Strategy not \n\nachieved \n\nformulated \n\n- Procurement management and \n\nfinancial Management weak in key \nspending agencies  \n\n- Internal control systems and \n\ninternal audit in early stages of \nenhancement \n\n- Implementation of Rationalization Plan slow \n- Accounting and Financial Statements are not fully \n\ncomprehensive \n\n- Scope to improve effective coordination between \nCOA and DBM, and better harmonize Chart of \nAccounts wth DBM accounting and budget reports \n\n- Enormous scope for IT-based PFM system \n\n- Prosecution and \n\nenforcement of tax \nevasion continues to \nbe a challenge \n\n- Demand-side \n\ngovernance measures \noutpaces supply-side \nbottlenecks \n\n \nTA-1: building blocks for developing an action plan and \nimplementation timeframe for an integrated GFMIS, \npiloting the internal control system, and other related \narea in budget execution. \n\nTA-2: Focus on implementing budget execution reforms \nnecessary for an integrated GFMIS, improving cash \nrevenue forecasting; capacity development support at the \nDRMD; rollout of internal controls system at the national \nlevel, and supporting measures agreed as part of the \npost-program monitoring framework. \n\nTA-3: continue implementing budget execution \nreforms under TA-2, provide advisory support for \nthe pilot of GFMIS at DBM and eventual rollout to \nother line ministries; completion of rollout of internal \ncontrol systems, debt management, and other \nreforms identified under TA-2.  \n\n  73 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n8\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n7\n3\n\n \n \n\n\f74 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  COA  =  Commission  on  Audit,  DBM  =  Department  of  Budget  and  Management,  \nDepED  =  Department  of  Education,  DPWH  =  Department  of  Public  Works  and  Highways,  DRMD  =  debt  and  risk \nmanagement  division,  GFMIS  =  government  financial  management  information  system,  OPIF  =  organizational \nperformance  indicator  framework  ,  PEFA  =  Public  Expenditure  Financial  Accountability,  PHILGEPS  =  Philippine \nGovernment  Electric  Procurement  System,  PBS  =  Paper  on  Budget  Strategy,  PFM = public  financial  management, \nTA = technical assistance. \n\n \n\n3. \n\nCost and Financing \n\n14. \nThe  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $1,150,000  equivalent.
