A  summary  environment  impact  assessment  was \ncirculated  to  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Asian  Development \nBank (ADB) on 20 August 2007. \n\nThe  Project  will  expand  the  cargo  handling  capacity  of  Lae  port, \nimprove  the  livelihood  of  those  directly  or  indirectly  affected,  and \nreduce  the  incidence  of  HIV/AIDS  in  Lae.  It  will  finance  (i) the \nconstruction  of  a  tidal  basin  (700  x  400  meters),  a  multipurpose \nberth,  and  terminal  works  including  all  buildings,  storage  areas, \nroads,  drainage,  water,  electricity,  and  sewerage  services,  with \nbuilt-in flexibility to increase the capacity further in a cost-effective \nmanner; \nimprovement; \n(ii) \nin  project  management,  construction \n(iii) consulting  services \nsupervision, \nand \nsocioeconomic  monitoring;  and  (iv)  gender-responsive  programs \nfor HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention. \n\nfinancial  management, \n\nresettlement, \n\nresettlement \n\nlivelihood \n\nand \n\nPorts  have  always  been  important  in  the  logistic  chain  for \ninternational  trade.  They  are  particularly  critical  for  an  island \neconomy  like  Papua  New  Guinea  (PNG),  which  depends  greatly \non  exports.  Lae  port  is  PNG\u2019s  largest,  busiest,  and  single  most \nimportant port. It is a gateway linking the world market with a large \nhinterland\u2014half  of \nthe \npopulation lives. \n\nterritory\u2014where  about  half  of \n\nthe \n\nSince  1995,  Lae  port  has  witnessed  an  average  annual  increase \nin  cargo  of  131,000  tons,  with  containerized  cargo  growing  at \nmore  than  5%  per  year  and  general  cargo  at  2.5%.  In  2005,  the \nvolume  of  cargo  through  Lae  port  reached  2.4  million  revenue \ntons,  stretching  Lae  port  to  the  limit  of  its  capacity.  Frequent \ncongestion  at  the  port  imposes  high  costs  on  its  users  and \nhampers  both  international  and  domestic  trade.  The  situation  is \nexpected to worsen, as the country\u2019s economic prospects remain \nstrong  and  the  hinterland  of  Lae  port  is  experiencing  a  boom  in \ndevelopment. Some shipping companies have already purchased \nmore  ships,  and  are  increasing  demand  for  efficient  modern  port \ninfrastructure and management. Failure to expand capacity at this \ntime and to manage Lae port more efficiently will dampen PNG\u2019s \neconomic development. \n\n\fii\n\nInstead  of  simply  improving  the  port,  the  Project  will  build  new \nfacilities, for three reasons: (i) the terminal area at the existing port \nis not large enough for efficient operations; (ii) the existing berths \nthreat  of \nare  built  on  a  steep \ngeotechnical instability, heightening the financial risks of any port \nimprovement  project;  and  (iii) opportunities  to  extend  the  existing \nberths are limited, whereas the Project allows additional berths to \nbe built at relatively low marginal cost. \n\nforeshore  with \n\nincreasing \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  Project  is  expected  to  catalyze  industrial  and  commercial \ndevelopment  and  promote  trade  for  PNG  by  relieving  a  binding \nconstraint on key port infrastructure in Lae. \n\nProject Investment Plan\n\nThe  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $154  million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $4.44 million.  \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nfrom \n\nthe  OPEC  Fund \n\nADB will provide a blended loan of $100 million\u2014$60 million from \nordinary  capital  resources  (OCR)  and  $40  million  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Fund  (ADF)\u2014to  finance  64.9%  of  the  total  cost.  A \nInternational \nloan  of  $6  million \nDevelopment  (OFID)  will  finance  the  civil  works  for  the  port \nfacilities.  A  $1.5  million  grant  from  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty \nReduction  will  finance  the  livelihood  enhancement  activities  and \nsocial  services  associated  with  resettlement,  and  a  $0.75  million \ngrant for the HIV/AIDS component will come from the Cooperation \nFund  for  Fighting  HIV/AIDS  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific(cid:3) (HIV/AIDS\nCooperation  Fund)  and  will  be  administered  by  ADB.  The \nGovernment  will  provide  $45.75  million,  or  29.7%  of  the  total \nproject cost. (cid:3)\n\nfor \n\nADB\u2019s  $60  million  loan  from  OCR  will  be  provided  under  its \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)\u2013based lending facility. The \nloan  will  have  a  term  of  24  years  including  a  grace  period  of \n4 years,  an  interest  rate  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of \n0.35% per annum, and such other terms and conditions set forth \nin the draft loan and project agreements. \n\nA loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights \n25,242,000  ($40  million)  will  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s  ADF \nresources. The ADF loan will have a maturity of 32 years including \na  grace  period  of  8  years,  an  interest  charge  of  1%  per  annum \nduring  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter,  equal \namortization, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the \ndraft ADF loan and project agreements. \n\nThe loan of $6 million from OFID will have a maturity of 20 years, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years and an interest charge of 1.5% \nper  annum  plus  a  service  fee  of  1%  which  will  be  fixed  over  the \nterm of the loan.\n\n\fiii\n\nAllocation and Relending\nTerms\n\nThe  Government  will  relend  the  loans  to  the  Independent  Public \nBusiness  Corporation  on  the  terms  and  conditions  acceptable  to \nADB.  The  currency  risk  of  the  loans  will  be  borne  by  the \nGovernment. \n\nPeriod of Utilization \n\nUntil 30 June 2012 \n\nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n\n31 December 2011 \n\nExecuting Agency \n\nIndependent Public Business Corporation (IPBC) \n\nImplementation\nArrangements \n\nthe  director  of \n\nIPBC  will  set  up  and  maintain  a  fully  staffed  and  adequately \nfunded  project  management  unit  (PMU)  with  engineering  and \ncontract management, resettlement and environment, and finance \nand administration divisions. A project steering committee will be \nformed  to  oversee  the  project  implementation  and  provide  policy \nguidance.  It  will  be chaired  by  IPBC\u2019s  managing  director and  will \nhave \ninfrastructure  planning  and \ndevelopment  division  as  secretary.  The  other  members  will  be \nsenior representatives from the Departments of National Planning \nand  Monitoring,  Treasury,  Justice  and  Attorney  General,  Lands \nand  Physical  Planning,  Transport,  and  Environment  and \nIndependent  Consumer  and \nConservation,  and \nCompetition Commission and the Morobe Provincial Government \n(MPG) as well as the chairperson of the board of directors and the \nchief executive officer of PNG Ports Corporation Limited. \n\nIPBC\u2019s \n\nfrom \n\nthe \n\nThe  Morobe  Provincial  Administration  (MPA),  the  administrative \narm of MPG, will implement the livelihood and social improvement \nprogram  to  be  financed  by  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction \n(JFPR)  and  the  HIV/AIDS  awareness  and  prevention  program  to \nbe financed by the HIV/AIDS Cooperation Fund. But disbursement \nand  financial  management  will  be  centralized  in  the  PMU  for \ninternal control. \n\nThe  procurement  of  civil  works  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The major civil \nworks, involving dredging, berth, and terminal construction, will be \ngrouped  into  one  contract  package  to  be  awarded  through \none-stage,  one-envelope  international  competitive  bidding  with \nprequalification.  For  the  resettlement  and  livelihood  improvement \nactivities,  which  will  involve  contracts  of  various  sizes  for  works, \nnational  competitive  bidding  and  shopping  will  be  used  as \nappropriate. \n\nengineering \n\nInternational  and  national  consultants  will  (i)  support  the  PMU  in \nfinancial \ncontract  management, \nport \nresettlement,  and  socioeconomic  monitoring; \nmanagement, \nthe  environment; \n(ii) supervise  construction  and  monitor \n\nand \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting Services \n\n\fiv\n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries\n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\n(iii) undertake resettlement and livelihood and social improvement \nactivities;  and  (iv)  raise  awareness  of  HIV/AIDS  and \nits \nprevention.  The  consultants  will  be  hired  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from \ntime  to  time).  They  will  be  selected  through  quality-  and  cost-\nbased  selection, \nindividual  consultant  selection,  consultants\u2019 \nqualifications selection, single-source selection, or other methods \nas appropriate.  \n\nThe Project is economically viable. At a 12% discount rate, the net \npresent value is about K104 million and the economic internal rate \nof return is 15.8%. The Project will turn a land with little financial \nand economic value at present into a free trade zone or industrial \npark,  catalyze  private  sector  development,  and  add  value  to \nPNG\u2019s exports. In the process, it will (i) generate more than 1,000 \njobs  for  local  communities\u2014mostly  unskilled  laborers  based  in \nLae\u2014during the implementation; (ii) create opportunities for local \npeople to be employed as seafarers, sea workers, and port agents \nand  operators;  and  (iii) become  another  stable  source  of  income \nafter  completion  for  the  stevedoring  companies,  which  are  50% \nowned  by  the  local  ethnic  groups.  Industrial  and  commercial \ndevelopment  resulting  from  the  Project  will  add  hundreds  of  job \nopportunities. \n\nResettlement poses the greatest risks to the Project. Risks relate \nto  internal  conflicts  between  local  ethnic  groups,  perceptions \nabout  land  ownership,  procurement,  contract  enforcement,  and \nsocial equity. To mitigate these risks, extensive dialogue has been \nheld  with local  groups and  evidence  of  government  ownership  of \nthe project area has been presented. Two major stakeholders, the \nLabu and the Ahi, who were hostile to each other, have formed a \nBulo  Committee  to  coordinate  the  views  of  different  clans. \nimprovement  programs  are \nResettlement  and \nformulated  equitably  to  address  the  concerns  of  the  resettling \npeople,  the  Labu,  and  the  Ahi.  ADB\u2019s  ADF  loan  will  finance \nresettlement,  and  JFPR  resources  will  finance  livelihood  and \nsocial  improvement.  Implementation  responsibilities  will  be  split \nbetween  IPBC  (resettlement)  and  MPA  (livelihood  and  social \nimprovement).  Contract  packages  and  procurement  methods  are \nproperly  defined  so \nreliable \ncontractors,  suppliers,  and  nongovernment  organizations  are \nhired.\n\nreputable,  and \n\nthat  capable, \n\nlivelihood \n\nAnother major risk is corruption, given the size of the Project and \nits implementation context. The risk is heightened by the need to \nhire contractors and consultants. To mitigate this risk, (i) all PMU \nmanagement  and  staff  will  be \nthe \nGovernment\u2019s  anticorruption  policies,  including  the  concept  of \nwhistle-blowing as well as other methods of reducing vulnerability \nto corruption; (ii) IPBC will develop and maintain a project website \nwhere  the  audited  project  financial  accounts,  project  progress, \n\nin  ADB\u2019s  and \n\ntrained \n\n\fv\n\nand  procurement  activities  will  be  disclosed;  (iii)  the  imprest \naccounts  will  be  used  prudently  and  monitored  closely;  (iv)  key \nconsultants will be selected by ADB in consultation with IPBC, and \nbidding  documents  and  contract  awards  for  all  international  and \nnational competitive bidding contracts will be reviewed beforehand \nby  ADB;  and  (v) financial  management  will  be  centralized  in  the \nPMU  for  internal  control.  Identifying  IPBC  as  the  Executing \nAgency  further  mitigates  the  risk  of  corruption,  as  Transparency \nInternational  is  represented  on  the  IPBC  board  of  directors  and \nIPBC  is  among  the  organizations  that  are  PNG\u2019s  most  closely \nwatched.\n\nOther  risks  pertain  to  law  and  order,  project  management, \nconstruction quality, and HIV/AIDS prevalence. The project design \ntakes these risks into account. The Government will be required to \nprovide  security  during  the  project  implementation.  IPBC  will \nassign  a  team  of  qualified  counterpart  staff  to  the  PMU.

The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nPorts  have  always  been  a  critical  link  in  the  logistic  chain  for  international  trade.  More \nthan 80% of internationally traded goods are shipped from ports. Globalization of production and \nthe  rapid  expansion  of  world  trade  have  made  ports  even  more  important  to  economic \ndevelopment,  as  port  capability  and  efficiency  influence  the  location  of  plants  or  distribution \ncenters and determine the competitiveness of local producers.  \n\n3. \nThe  port  sector  is  particularly  critical  for  a  country  like  PNG,  a  Pacific  island  country \nwhose  territory  comprises  the  eastern  half  of  New  Guinea  and  600  offshore  islands.  Of  its  20 \nprovinces,  15  are  on  the  coast.  More  than  60%  of  the  country\u2019s  6  million  people  are  widely \ndispersed  across  islands  and  coral  atolls  and  along  the  banks  of  major  rivers.  There  is  no \nnational  rail  or  road  network.  Although  46  airports  and  numerous  airstrips  serve  a  network  of \nscheduled,  charter,  and  missionary  air  services,  even  to  some  very  remote  communities,  air \ntransport is too costly for any trips other than emergencies. \n\n4. \nPNG\u2019s  economy  is  small  and  open  and  is  highly  dependent  on  trade,  particularly \nexports, to generate economic growth and fiscal revenue. In 1980\u20132004, exports rose steadily \nfrom $985 million to $2,529 million, while imports had moderate growth. Exports increased from \n35% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1986 to almost 48% in 2002, and even reached more \nthan 50% in some years. Imports, on the other hand, stayed close to 30% of GDP. More than \n90% of the country\u2019s exports are shipped from its ports.  \n\nPNG\u2019s  good  economic  performance  has  always  been  associated  with  strong  trade \n5. \nperformance. From 1991 to 1994, a surge in mineral and crude oil exports and an associated \nincrease in imports spurred economic growth of 6% on average. The recent economic recovery, \nafter a prolonged recession from 1995 to 2002, also benefited from an increase in agricultural \nand mineral exports caused by the high commodity prices on international markets.  \n\n6. \nCoastal  trade,  particularly  outbound  container  cargo  from  Lae  to  other  PNG  ports,  has \nbeen  growing  rapidly  since  2001.  Full  outbound  containers  that  year  numbered  13,395 \ntwenty-foot equivalent units (TEU); by 2005 they totaled 23,811 TEU, for an increase of 78%. \n\n7. \nIn  sum,  the  port  sector  has  a  crucial  role  in  the  social  and  economic  development  of \nPNG. It is important not only for the adequate and efficient handling of exports and imports, but \nalso  for  the  efficient  movement  of  goods  and  persons  between  the  remote  and  sparsely \npopulated areas on the mainland and islands and the centers of economic activity.  \n\n\f2\n\nPNG\u2019s  port  sector  consists  of  22  declared  ports  and  numerous  publicly  and  privately \n8. \noperated wharves, jetties, and landings. The fully state-owned PNG Ports Corporation Limited \n(PPCL)  operates  16  of  the  22  declared  ports,  including  two  ports  operated  by  its  agents.  The \nother six declared ports are either being run by private entities or not operating. An analysis of \nthe PNG port sector is in Appendix 2.  \n\n9. \nThe PPCL-operated ports handle about 90% of international ships calling at PNG ports \nand 80% of PNG\u2019s international and domestic cargo. The ports of Lae and Port Moresby alone \naccount for more than 70% of the throughput of the declared ports.  \n\n10. \nFrom  1995  to  2005,  the  throughput  of  the  PPCL  ports  climbed  from  3.8  million  to \n5.3 million revenue tons, increasing steadily since 2002, thanks to the rising exports of minerals, \npetroleum,  coffee,  copra,  palm  oil,  logs,  timber,  and  marine  products.  While  the  number  of \nvessel calls has barely risen, overall traffic has grown by almost 40%, and containerized traffic, \nby  80%,  because  of  the  larger  size  of  ships.  International  ships  have  increased  in  size  from \n150 meters (m) to 180\u2013200 m, and in carrying capacity from 15,000 to 44,000 deadweight tons. \nCoastal trade vessels have similarly grown in size from 70\u201380 m to 100\u2013120 m. \n\n11. \nThe  increase  in  vessel  size  and  carrying  capacity  and  the  growing  trend  toward \ncontainerization  have  had  significant  impact  on  all  PNG  ports,  particularly  Lae  port,  PNG\u2019s \nlargest, busiest, and single most important port. Lae port handles about half of the throughput of \nthe  22  declared  ports  and  more  than  60%  of  the  international  and  coastal  trade  registered  in \nPPCL\u2019s ports, and generates more than 50% of PPCL\u2019s revenue. It serves as a gateway linking \nthe world market with a large hinterland comprising Morobe province, the city of Lae (the capital \nof the province, and PNG\u2019s industrial and commercial center), and five resource-rich provinces \nin the Highlands. The hinterland is home to about half of the population and represents half of \nthe  territory.  PNG\u2019s  most  significant  road,  the  Highlands  Highway,  runs  from  Lae  to  the \nHighlands  region,  dispensing  imports  ranging  from  heavy  machinery  to  food  products  in  the \nregion  and  bringing  the  country\u2019s  major  export  items  to  Lae  port.  About  50%  of  PNG  exports \nand 90% of coffee exports are shipped from Lae port. \n\n12. \nLae port was built in the 1930s to handle mostly break-bulk cargo but has developed into \na focal point of imports and exports and a regional hub distributing cargo to and from the more \nremote  populated  areas  along  the coastline  and  the  islands.  Since  1995,  the  volume  of  cargo \nhandled  at  the  port  has  increased  by  131,000  revenue  tons  each  year  on  average, 1  with \ncontainerized  cargo  growing  at  more  than  5%  yearly  and  general  cargo,  at  2.5%.  In  2005, \n2.4 million revenue tons of cargo passed through Lae port.  \n\n13. \nLae  port  has  been  adapting  to  the  demands  of  container  operations  over  the  past \ndecade.  But  investment  in  facility  maintenance  and  expansion  has  not  kept  pace  with  the \ngrowing  trend  toward  containerization  and  larger  ships.  The  current  five  berths2 at  Lae,  with a \ntotal  length  of  about  520  m,  and  a  total  storage  area  of  53,620  square  meters  (m2)3 for  cargo \nmarshaling, are aging and cannot handle increasing cargo volumes and ship sizes. Berth 4 for \ndomestic ships can no longer accommodate these ships and is underused. Berth 1, with a total \nlength of 123 m and water depth of 11 m, is suitable for overseas vessels but is now used as a \ndomestic  terminal.  Overseas  vessels  are  mainly  served  by  berths  2  and  3,  which  have  a  total \nlength  of  307  m.  As  a  result,  port  congestion  at  Lae  is  frequent,  imposing  high  costs  on  port \n\n                                                \n1  At 12 tons of cargo for every TEU. \n2   Including a passenger berth. \n3   Including covered storage of 14,620 m2 and open storage of 39,000 m2.\n\n\f \n\n3    \n\nusers. In 2005, all classes of vessels reportedly spent 210 days waiting for a berth, each day\u2019s \ndelay  in  the  harbor  costing  a  shipping  company  $8,000\u2013$15,000.  Some  vessels  are  turning \naway from the port. Others are considering imposing congestion charges in the range of $200\u2013\n$250 per TEU, which will translate into higher costs for importers and exporters, and eventually \nconsumers  and  the  general  economy.  Port  congestion  also  poses  health  and  safety  hazards, \nand the issue of compliance with the International Shipping and Port Security Code. As Lae port \nis the principal gateway for PNG, delays at the port have a cascading effect on other ports. \n\n14.  With a throughput reaching 2.4 million revenue tons, Lae port is operating at the limits of \nits capacity. The situation is expected to deteriorate, as the economic prospects for PNG remain \nstrong,  and  the  hinterland  of  the  port  is  experiencing  a  boom  in  development.  Some  shipping \ncompanies  have  already  purchased  more  ships,  and  are  increasing  their  demand  for  efficient \nmodern  port  infrastructure  and  management.  Failure  to  expand  capacity  at  this  time  and  to \nmanage Lae port more efficiently will dampen economic development.  \n\n15. \nInstead  of  simply  improving  the  port,  the  Project  will  build  new  port  facilities  because \n(i) the terminal area at the existing port is not large enough for efficient port operations; (ii) the \nexisting  berths  are  built  on  a  steep  foreshore  with  increasing  risks  of  geotechnical  instability, \nheightening the financial risks of any port improvement project; and (iii) the Project allows more \nberths  to  be  built  at  relatively  low  marginal  cost,  whereas  opportunities  to  extend  the  present \nberths are limited. \n\n16. \nThe Project is the first phase of the tidal basin master plan, under which the port facilities \nwill be expanded into a new swamp area. It is also part of the blueprint drawn up by the Morobe \nProvincial  Government  to  promote  industrial  development  in  Lae  city.  By  increasing  the \ncargo-handling capacity of Lae port, the Project will promote trade and private sector investment \nin industrial and commercial activities and contribute to export-led economic growth.  \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n17. \nPNG  faces  challenges  in  sustaining  economic  growth,  providing  employment,  and \ncreating  an  environment  conducive  to  private  sector  development.  However,  the  current \nmacroeconomic stability, high commodity prices, and dynamic global economy, particularly the \nemerging Asian economies, offer excellent opportunities for the country to accelerate economic \ngrowth, generate employment, increase national wealth, and improve living standards.  \n\n1. \n\nChallenges \n\nSluggish Economic Growth. The biggest challenge PNG faces is sustaining economic \n18.\ngrowth.  Since  1960,  economic  growth  has  been  uneven  and  highly  volatile,  showing  a \ndownward  trend.  The  economy  grew  at  an  average  rate  of  5.5%  in  1960\u20131975,  but  slowed \ndown to less than 1% in 1996\u20132004. Because of high population growth, real per capita GDP \ngrowth has declined even faster, resulting in estimated real per capita GDP at the end of 2004 \n50%  lower  than  that  in  1975. 4 The  low  level  of  economic  growth  has  adversely  impacted \npoverty,  infrastructure,  social  services,  employment,  and  human  resources.  The  incidence  of \npoverty  is  projected  to  have  increased  from  37.5%  of  the  PNG  population  in  1996  to  54%  in \n2003. 5 Infrastructure  has  deteriorated  to  such  a  state  that  it  hinders  access  to  markets  and \n\n                                                \n4   IMF. 2006.

Washington, DC. \n\n\f4\n\nservices, imposes high costs on producers and consumers, and discourages investment. Social \nservices are either under-provided or not provided at all, and the social indicators are the worst \nin the Pacific region. Urban unemployment is high, at around 40%. Many well-educated people \nhave left the country, further straining its already thin human resources.  \n\nChallenging  Business  Environment.  PNG  offers  many  business  opportunities,  given \n19.\nits  rich  endowment  of  minerals,  oil  and  natural  gas,  forestry,  fishery,  and  eco-conditions  for \nhigh-value agricultural production and its proximity to the fastest-growing Australian and Asian \nmarkets. However, most of the public goods that the private sector needs to flourish are either \nmissing  or  under-provided.  Private  investment,  despite  a  recent  increase  stimulated  by  high \ncommodity  prices,  has  been  stagnant.  The  manufacturing  and  service  sectors  are  withering. \nThe contribution of manufacturing to GDP used to be in the range of 5 to 11%; it is now around \n6%. The more than 40% share of services in GDP in the 1970s and 1980s has declined to less \nthan 30% (footnote 4).  \n\nThe stagnation in private activities can be explained by the high costs of doing business \n\n20. \nin PNG, which are attributable to the following factors: \n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\nCorruption and serious problems with law and order. PNG is perceived to be \none of the countries where corruption is rampant. It was ranked 162nd out of 180 \ncountries  by  Transparency  International  in  its  2007  Corruption  Perceptions \nIndex.6 Tribal conflicts and criminal activities such as rape, robbery, and murder \nare  rising  in  PNG  and  have  seriously  damaged  the  country\u2019s  image.  High \nturnover among qualified national and international staff results in high costs for \nboth the Government and funding agencies. Businesses in PNG also suffer from \nhigh  security  costs  and  cite  crime  and  theft  as  the  prime  impediment  to \ninvestment.  On  average,  companies  in  PNG  spend  about  12%  of  their  gross \nincome  on  private  security  and  loss  from  theft.  The  high  crime  rates  hamper \neconomic  activities  and  undermine  investors\u2019  confidence.  Since  the  mid-1990s, \nforeign investment in PNG has markedly slowed. \n\nPoor  infrastructure.  Electricity  is  cheap  by  regional  standards,  but  is  available \nto only 60% of urban households. Many businesses are forced to run their own \ngenerators.  Telecommunication  services  are  costly  and  unreliable  and  are  also \nrestricted to urban areas. Only 11% of the national roads and 14% of provincial \nroads  are  in  good  condition.  Half  of  the  feeder  roads  are  often  impassable. \nWharves,  jetties,  and  airstrips  have  fallen  into  disuse.  Some  60%  of  maritime \nnavigation aids need replacement. \n\n(iii)  Weak  institutional  capacity.  There  is  a  shortage  of  skills  in  almost  all \nprofessions. Labor productivity is low across all economic sectors outside mining \nand oil. Of PPCL\u2019s more than 400 staff, only four are engineers\u2014two at the head \noffice and the other two working in Port Moresby. \n\n(iv) \n\nComplex land ownership issues. The PNG landmass of about 462,000 square \nkilometers  accounts  for  more  than  80%  of  the  land  area  in  the  South  Pacific. \nHowever,  mobilizing  land  for  development  purposes  is  very  risky,  costly,  and \n\n                                                \n6  The  Transparency  International  Corruption  Perceptions  Index  ranks  countries  in  terms  of  the  degree  to  which \ncorruption is perceived to exist among public officials and politics, with scores ranging from 0 (highly corrupt) to 10 \n(highly clean).  \n\n\f \n\n5    \n\ntime-consuming  because  more  than  90%  of  the  land  in  PNG  is  customarily \nowned, and land ownership is subject to considerable dispute. Even when land is \nsold,  traditional  landowners  still  refuse  to  give  up  their  title.  The  history  of  the \nproject \nthe \nGovernment spent almost a century taking control of ownership. Customary land \nownership  has  led  to  a  vast  amount  of  unused  land.  In  the  city  of  Lae,  where \nthere  seems  to  be  a  severe  shortage  of  commercial  and  residential  land,  idle \nland is everywhere, without any signs of development. \n\nthe  pre-independence  administrations  and \n\nland  shows \n\nthat \n\n2. \n\nOpportunities \n\nMacroeconomic  Stability.  Macroeconomic  stability  is  a  precondition  for  economic \n21.\ngrowth. Since 2002, the present government has managed to restore macroeconomic stability \nthrough  prudent  fiscal  and  monetary  policies  and  debt  policies.  Inflation  has  been  drastically \nbrought down. The fiscal outcome has improved: the budget deficit in 2006 was projected to be \n0.6% of GDP. Public debt has fallen, from 72% of GDP in 2002 to a projected 42.4% in 2006. \nThe exchange rate has been stable. Aided by high commodity prices in international markets, \nPNG\u2019s economy emerged from a 6-year contraction to grow at around 3% in real terms in 2004, \n2005, and 2006. The GDP growth rate is estimated to reach 6.5% in 2007 and is projected to \nremain at 6.5% in 2008.  \n\nFavorable  External  Environment.  The  world  economy  has  been  rapidly  expanding \n22.\nsince 2002. Developing Asia is particularly dynamic. From 1991 to 2004, East Asia grew at an \nannual  average  rate  of  9.1%  and  South  Asia  at  5.7%.  The  buoyant  global  economy  and  the \ndramatic  transformation  in  developing  Asia  from  agriculture  to  resource-intensive  economies \nhave increased demand for raw materials and primary goods and driven up prices. The price of \noil increased to more than $90 per barrel in 2007, more than triple the amount 4 years earlier. \nThe prices of aluminum, copper, iron ore, lead, nickel, and other minerals have also surged. The \nprices  of  food  and  beverages,  under  downward  pressure  from  agricultural  productivity  and \ntechnological  advances,  stabilized  in  2005.  The  growth  of  the  global  economy  is  foreseen  to \nslow down but to remain strong. Developing Asia is expected to maintain its strong growth and \nwill  be  an increasingly important  consumer  in  sustaining  and  pushing  up  the  prices  of  primary \ncommodities.  A  recent  ADB  study 7  projected  a  long-term  rising  trend  until  2015  for  most \ncommodity prices in real terms, including the prices of some agricultural commodities, despite \nimprovements  in  productivity  and  resource  use  efficiency.  This  prospect  offers  an  excellent \nopportunity  for  PNG  to  attract  foreign  investment,  create  jobs,  expand  trade,  and  increase \nforeign exchange earnings. \n\nGovernment  Development  Strategy.  Acknowledging  the  failure  of  the  previous \n23. \ndevelopment  plans  and  strategies,  the  Government  in  2004  formulated  a  Medium  Term \nDevelopment Strategy (MTDS) for 2005\u20132010, through a consultative and participatory process. \nThe  MTDS  sets  the  goal  of  improving  living  standards  through  an  overarching  development \nstrategy  of  export-driven  economic  growth,  rural  development,  and  poverty  reduction. \nBroad-based economic growth driven by exports is central to the MTDS, which recognizes the \nopportunities offered by the global markets and PNG\u2019s comparative advantages. On the basis of \nthe  development  strategy,  seven  areas  of  expenditure,  including  the improvement  of  transport \ninfrastructure, the promotion of income-earning opportunities, HIV/AIDS prevention, and law and \njustice,  were  prioritized.  The  budget  allocated  to  these  priority  areas  has  been  increased \n                                                \n7   ADB. 2006. Asia\u2019s Imprint on Global Commodity Markets. Manila. \n\n\f6\n\nsubstantially  to  52.9%  of  total  expenditure  and  88.5%  of  development  budget  expenditure  in \n2007. The Government prefers to borrow from ADB for economic growth projects.  \n\nGovernment  Sector  Strategy.  The  Government\u2019s  National  Transport  Development \n24.\nPlan  (NTDP)  2006\u20132010  lists  priority  investment  projects  in  the  land,  water,  and  air  transport \nsubsectors,  with  heavy  emphasis  on  land  transport.  The  Highlands  Highway  and  Lae  port, \nwhich  form  the  country\u2019s  single  most  important  lifeline  for  growth  and  development,  top  the \npriority lists. While emphasizing asset maintenance and rehabilitation, the NTDP acknowledges \nthe need to fill the gaps in PNG\u2019s transport network, and to expand the port facilities. Both the \ncentral and provincial governments consider the Project strategic and support the Project.  \n\nADB  Strategy.  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  (CSP)  for  PNG  (2006\u20132010) 8\n25.\nsupports  the  Government\u2019s  development  goals,  strategies,  and  priorities  stated  in  the  MTDS. \nDrawn  from  ADB\u2019s  operational  experience  in  PNG,  the  CSP  chooses  to  be  selective  and  to \nfocus  ADB\u2019s  interventions  in  the  period  covered  on  four  strategic  areas  that  combine  the \nGovernment\u2019s  priorities  and  ADB\u2019s  policies:  (i)  public  financial  management,  (ii)  private  sector \ndevelopment, (iii) the transport sector, and (iv) health and HIV/AIDS. \n\n26. \nThe  CSP  recognizes  that,  although  the  maritime  subsector  is  not  a  core  operational \nsector under ADB\u2019s Medium-Term Strategy II,9 it is critical to PNG\u2019s economy, and is an area in \nwhich  ADB  has  been  deeply  involved  and  in  which  its  financing can  be  most  effectively  used. \nThe CSP therefore proposes a continued focus on the road and maritime transport subsectors. \nSpecifically,  to  assist  the  Government  in  achieving  its  development  objectives,  ADB  would \nsupport the Highlands Highway Rehabilitation Project and the Lae Port Development Project in \naddition to implementing the four ongoing loan projects.10\n\nExternal  Assistance.  Australia  is  the  largest  source  of  aid  for  PNG  and  offers  about \n27.\n$225  million  a  year  in  assistance.  The  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development \n(AusAID) pursues better governance, sustainable growth, conflict reduction, and social stability, \nand synergies between these objectives. In the transport sector, AusAID focuses on supporting \na  rational  policy  and  planning  framework,  sector  management  and  leadership,  and  road  and \nairport maintenance projects. The Bougainville Wharves Rehabilitation Project was financed by \nAusAID in October 2002\u2013April 2004. The financing amounted to about $10 million and was used \nfor the construction of wharves and storage facilities to boost the island economy by facilitating \nimports and exports to and from South Bougainville.  \n\nThe World Bank financed two port projects with a total committed loan amount of $12.7 \n28. \nmillion in the 1970s. ADB has provided five loans to the maritime sector since 1980. The total \nloan amount was about $70 million\u2014$43 million from ordinary capital resources (OCR) and $27 \nmillion  from  the  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF).  In  addition,  an  ADB  OCR  loan  of  about  $12 \nmillion  was channeled  to  the  port  subsector  through  the  Transport  Infrastructure  Development \nProject, approved in 1991. The loans financed the rehabilitation of wharves and navigation aids, \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2006. Papua New Guinea Counry Strategy and Program (2006\u20132010).

External assistance to the sector is summarized \nin Appendix 3.\n\nLessons  Learned.  ADB-financed  projects  in  PNG  have  generally  performed  poorly. \n29.\nMajor  problems  mentioned  in  the  country  assistance  program  evaluation  200311 and  the  CSP \nfor  PNG  (2006\u20132010)  include  substantial  delays  in  project  start-up  and  completion,  major \nchanges in project scope, failure to comply with ADB\u2019s project administration requirements, and \nproject sustainability. The lessons are as follows. First, the project design must be simple and \nfocused.  A  complex  design  covering  a  wide  geographic  area  or  several  sectors  will  lead  to \nproject  delays  and  implementation  problems.  Second,  government  ownership  and  active \nparticipation  in  a  project  is  the  key  to  project  success.  Third,  new  complex  systems  and \nprocedures  for  PNG  are  neither  necessary  nor  sustainable.  Fourth,  institutional  capacity  for \nproject implementation must be carefully assessed. Finally, land acquisition requires particular \nefforts before project implementation. \n\n30. \nThe  design  of  the  Project  takes  these  lessons  into  account.  The  Project  is  simple  and \nstraightforward in design, and is focused on crucial physical infrastructure. Policy dialogue with \nthe  Government  has  been  continuous,  to  enhance  ownership.  Institutional  capacity  has  been \nassessed,  and  the  Executing  Agency  carefully  chosen.  To  reduce  the  likelihood  of  delay  in \nproject  start-up,  the  prequalification  and  bidding  documents  and  engineering  design  for  the \nmajor  works,  sufficient  for  tendering  and  bidding,  have  been  prepared,  under  the  project \npreparatory technical assistance (PPTA).12 Dredging and construction of the wharf and terminal \nhave been grouped into one contract package to ensure economy in administration and avoid \ninterfacing problems. The land issue has been extensively studied, and a resettlement plan and \na  livelihood  and  social  improvement  program  have  been  formulated  in  an  equitable  way  to \nminimize social risks.  \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nThe Project is expected to catalyze industrial and commercial development and promote \n\n31. \ntrade for PNG by relieving a binding constraint on key port infrastructure in Lae.  \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nB. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  Project  will  have  three  outputs:  (i)  operational  new  port  facilities,  (ii)  improved \n32. \nlivelihood  for  those  affected,  and  (iii)  reduced  incidence  of  HIV/AIDS  in  Lae.  The  Project \nactivities will consist of (i) the construction of port facilities including a tidal basin, a berth, and \nterminal works; (ii) resettlement and livelihood and social improvement for the people affected \nby  the  Project;  (iii)  project  implementation  support;  and  (iv)  gender-responsive  HIV/AIDS \nawareness and prevention.  \n\n                                                \n11 ADB. 2003.

Manila. \n\n\f8\n\n1. \n\nPort Facility Construction \n\n33. \nThe Project will expand the capacity of Lae port by building a tidal basin (700 x 400 m) \nnorthwest  of  the  present  port  facilities  with  a  dredged  depth  of  13  m  below  Chart  Datum,  a \nmultipurpose berth (240 m long and 45\u201350 m wide), and terminal works including all buildings, \nstorage  areas,  roads,  drainage,  water,  electricity,  and  sewerage  services.  The  tidal  basin  and \nberth are designed to accommodate vessels with an overall length of 200 m, beam of 32.2 m, \nand fully laden draft of 12 m. There is built-in flexibility for extending the berth by another 150 m \nwithout incurring dredging cost; introducing rail-mounted quayside gantry cranes, heavy mobile \ncranes, and heavier handling equipment; and increasing depth to 15 m below Chart Datum. \n\n2. \n\nResettlement  and Livelihood and Social Improvement \n\n34. \nThe specific needs of the port expansion call for the relocation of 482 households (with a \npopulation  of  2,912)  currently  occupying  the  project  area  despite  the  very  unhealthy  living \nenvironment.  Another  affected  group,  the  Labu,  live  about  2  kilometers  (km)  away  from  the \nproject area, but their canoe landing site next to the port and an associated fish market will need \nto  be  acquired  to  construct  an  inter-port  road.  The  Project  will  relocate  the  482  households  to \nbetter  land  in  the  Malahang  area  of  Lae  and  provide  each  household  with  a  700  m2  residential \narea, a one-bedroom house with reasonable living conditions, and relocation assistance. It will \nalso  develop  the  SP  beach  into  an  alternative  landing  site  and  fish  market  for  the  Labu. \nRelocation  will  significantly  improve  living  conditions  for  the  majority  of  the  people  affected.  A \nlivelihood and social improvement program to complement the resettlement and further ensure \nlivelihood sustainability will be provided through Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR). The \ndescription of the JFPR is provided in Supplementary Appendix A. School and health facilities in \nMalahang will be expanded, and community infrastructure such as community centers, a sport \narea,  and  an  all-weather  market  at  the  resettlement  site  will  be  provided.  Other  interventions \ninclude (i) assisting re-settlers and the Labu in improving techniques in small-scale agriculture \nand  animal  husbandry  and  marketing  of  their  products;  (ii)  assisting  the  Labu  in  community-\nbased  fish  culture;  (iii)  providing  micro-credits  to  re-settlers  and  the  Labu;  and  (iv) providing \nlivelihood, health, nutrition, and vocational training for re-settlers. \n\n3. \n\nProject Implementation Support \n\nThe  Project  will  provide  support  for  project  implementation,  financial  management, \n\n35. \nconstruction supervision, resettlement, and socioeconomic impact monitoring.\n\n4. \n\nGender-Responsive HIV/AIDS Awareness and Prevention \n\nTo  minimize  the  potential  risk  of  new  HIV/AIDS  infections,  the  Project  includes  a \n36. \nprogram of support for effective and sustainable response to the AIDS epidemic. The activities \nin  the  program  include  (i)  developing  an  AIDS  code  of  conduct,  (ii)  renovating  the  seafarers\u2019 \nsupport  center  at  Lae  port,  (iii)  providing  institutional  strengthening  of  clinical  structures,  (iv) \ndeveloping  the  capacity  of  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  (v)  enhancing  the  outreach \nand impact of the AIDS site committee at Lae port, (vi) establishing AIDS site committees and \nwomen\u2019s  help  desks  at  police  stations  around  Lae  port,  (vii)  caring  for  people  living  with \nHIV/AIDS, and (viii) establishing an integrated response center for HIV/AIDS.  \n\n\f \n\n9    \n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n1. \n\nPolicy Dialogue with the Government \n\nADB\u2019s policy dialogue with the Government is focused on (i) resettlement, (ii) ownership \n37. \nand project management, (iii) tariff and revenue generation, and (iv) public-private partnership. \nLand  ownership  in  PNG  is  very  sensitive  and  controversial,  and  is  a  major  obstacle  to  the \ncountry\u2019s development. Since the PPTA fact-finding mission, ADB has paid particular attention \nto  land  and  resettlement  issues.  The  mission  provided  a  copy  of  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary\nResettlement  Policy  (1995)  to  the  Morobe  Provincial  Government  and  explained  the  policy.  It \nalso  met  with  the  major  stakeholders  (Ahi  and  Labu)  to  explain  the  policy.  Based  on  the \ndeclaration made in the National Gazette of 26 October 2000, the land required for the Project is \nnational  land.  This  will  be  further  confirmed  by  a  legal  opinion  to  be  issued  by  the  Attorney \nGeneral\u2019s Office.\n\n38. \nThe  feasibility  study,  the  engineering  design,  prequalification  and  bidding  documents, \nthe  environmental  impact  assessment,  and  the  resettlement  plan\u2014all  responsibilities  of  the \nGovernment\u2014were prepared under ADB\u2019s PPTA. ADB will further assist the Government during \nproject implementation in selecting and hiring qualified consultants to fill gaps in skills. However, \nthe success of the Project depends on the strength of its owner. It is extremely important for the \nGovernment  to  mobilize  a  team  of  highly  motivated,  devoted,  and  dynamic  professionals  with \nqualities  of  integrity,  reliability,  and  hard  work.  The  Government  agrees  to  pool  human \nresources from within and outside the country and to set up a strong project management unit \n(PMU) to safeguard the owner\u2019s interest.  \n\n39. \nTariff is a major source of port revenue. Tariff for the new port facilities should be high \nenough  to  recover  investment  costs  and  avoid  subsidizing  foreign  shipping  lines.  The \nGovernment agrees to review the tariff structure 6 months before the project completion and to \nset  a  new  tariff  that  reflects  the  costs.  It  also  agrees  to  take  proactive  measures  that  would \nattract private companies to develop and use one side of the tidal basin, to generate additional \nrevenues.\n\nThe project facilities, after completion, have the potential to attract the private sector to \n40. \noperate and bring private sector management expertise and resources into PNG\u2019s port sector. \nThe  Government  agrees  to  explore  the  possibility  of  partnering  with  the  private  sector  in \noperating the new port facilities, at least 1 year before project completion.  \n\n2. \n\nDonor Coordination and Project Complementarity  \n\n41. \nIn  preparing  the  Project,  close  coordination  and  consultations  with  major  donor \nagencies,  particularly  AusAID,  were  undertaken  to  identify  areas  of  collaboration,  ensure \ncomplementarity, and maximize the comparative advantages of the organizations.  \n\n42. \nLae port and the Highlands Highway form the backbone of PNG\u2019s economy. The Project \nwill  complement  the  efforts  of  the  Government  and  AusAID,  and  ADB\u2019s  current  and  future \ninvestment  in  the  Highlands  Highway.  Since  1995,  the  Government  has  strived  to  rehabilitate \nthe  Highlands  Highway  connecting  the  Chimbu,  Western,  and  Southern  Highlands  provinces. \nAusAID is supporting the Government through its Key Roads for Growth Maintenance Project, \nwhich  will  be  maintaining  the  Highlands  Highway  between  Lae  and  the  Eastern  Highlands \nprovince (Chimbu border) from 2006 to 2010. ADB has prioritized a Highlands Highway project \nin its CSP 2005 and is targeting 2008 for approval.  \n\n\f10\n\n3. \n\nPartnership with AusAID and OFID \n\n43. \nBy agreeing to the Transport Sector Support Program (TSSP, December 2005) with the \nGovernment,  AusAID  is  well  positioned  to  address  sector  issues  and  institutional  capacity \nbuilding.  The  TSSP  takes  a  program  approach  to  the  sector,  aimed  at  improving  governance \nand  the  performance  of  the  Government  in  transport  service  delivery  to  support  broad-based \neconomic growth. It seeks a long-term engagement with the Government (20\u201325 years) and is \nbacked by initial funding of K700 million over 4 years, divided into three facilities: (i) a TA facility, \n(ii) a challenge fund facility, and (iii) an infrastructure maintenance fund facility. The TA facility \nwill support sector reform and capacity building, the challenge fund facility will provide incentives \nfor  reform  and  improving  performance,  and  the  infrastructure  maintenance  fund  will  finance \nnational transport network priorities.  \n\n44. \nTo  complement  the  Project,  AusAID  will  assist  PPCL  in  strengthening  its  institutional \ncapacity  to  manage  its  capital  and  maintenance  investment  programs  and  improve  port \nservices,  with  an  initial  focus  on  preparing  Lae port  to  take  over  operation  in  case contracting \nand  other  arrangements  do  not  materialize.  The  scope  of  assistance  includes (i) assisting  the \nGovernment  in  exploring  public-private  partnerships  for  operating  the  new  port  facilities  built \nunder  the  Project,  and  (ii) providing  technical  assistance  to  strengthen  the  ports  operation \ndivision  of  PPCL,  including  the  services  of  a  port  operations  adviser  to  assist  the  manager  of \nLae port in improving the efficiency of operations. Among the functions of this adviser will be to \nprepare  PPCL  to  establish  a  port  operation  strategy  that  maximizes  the  use  of  the  increased \nwharf capacity created by the Project. \n\nThe  Project  presents  a  rare  opportunity  to  increase  the  technical  capacity  in  the  port \n45. \nsector. As part of its support for the PPCL port operations division, AusAID will explore options \nfor  strengthening  the  division  in  the  short  term  and,  more  importantly,  in  the  long  term.  The \nlonger-term options could include financing the seconding to the PMU of young engineers with \npotential from the University of Technology, to allow them to learn by doing, provided that the \nyoung  engineers  will  work  for  PPCL  for  at  least  5  years  after  project  completion.  AusAID  is \ncurrently  in  a  planning  phase  for  TSSP,  including  an  assessment  of  PPCL  systems  and \nprocesses. Its full package of assistance to PPCL in capacity building, institutional strengthening, \nand sustainable port infrastructure maintenance will be defined around February 2008. \n\n46. \n\nOFID will cofinance the civil works for the new port facilities with a loan of $6 million.  \n\n4. \n\nStakeholder Participation and Consultation  \n\n47. \nExtensive  public  consultations  have  been  conducted  with  government  officials,  the \nbusiness  sector,  local  communities,  affected  people,  and  international  and  national  NGOs \ninvolved  in  livelihood  restoration,  service  delivery,  and  HIV/AIDS  awareness  and  prevention \n(Supplementary  Appendix  E).  The  consultations  were  held  to  explain  ADB\u2019s  policies  on \nenvironment,  resettlement,  and  procurement;  increase  project  awareness;  build  project \nownership;  address  technical,  environmental,  and  social  concerns;  and  identify  appropriate \nproject interventions. Various ADB missions conducted public consultations and met with about \n300  stakeholders  from  the  central,  provincial,  and  Lae  district  governments;  the  Lae  business \ncommunity;  local  ethnic  communities;  civil  society  NGOs  (including  faith-based  organizations \nand  community-based  organizations);  and  donor  agencies.  During  the  PPTA  study,  the \nconsulting team distributed information leaflets and held public hearings, surveys, focus group \ndiscussions,  and  key  informant  meetings  at  provincial,  district,  port,  and  settlement  levels.  In \ntotal, more than 1,000 stakeholders were consulted. The stakeholders showed keen interest in \n\n\f \n\n11    \n\nthe Project and eagerness to benefit from it. They expressed concerns related to environmental \nand  social  issues,  and  these  concerns  were  considered  in  the  engineering  design,  the \nenvironmental  management  plan,  the  resettlement  plan,  the  JFPR  project,  the  HIV/AIDS \nawareness and prevention program, and the project design.  \n\nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n48. \nThe  project  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $154  million,  including  taxes  and  duties  of \n$4.44 million.

The  OCR  loan  will  carry  a  term  of  24  years \nwith  a  grace  period  of  4  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)\u2013based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.35%  per \nannum,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  OCR  loan  agreement.  The \nGovernment  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking \nthat these choices were independently made,  without relying on any communication or advice \nfrom ADB. The ADF loan will have a maturity of 32 years including a grace period of 8 years, an \ninterest charge of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, equal \namortization,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  ADF  loan  agreement. \nThe  Government  will  relend  the  loans  to  Independent  Public  Business  Corporation  (IPBC) \nthrough  a  subsidiary  loan  agreement  on  the  terms  and  conditions  acceptable  to  ADB.  The \ncurrency risk of the loans will be borne by the Government.   \n\n\f12\n\n50. \nOFID  will  provide  a  loan  of  $6  million  on  a  joint  basis.  It  will  have  a  term  of  20  years, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years, and an interest charge of 1.5%, plus a 1% service charge to \nbe fixed for the term of the loan. Grants of $1.5 million from the Government of Japan through \nJFPR, and $0.75 million from the HIV/AIDS Cooperation Fund, will also be provided. The funds \nfrom OFID, JFPR, and the HIV/AIDS Cooperation Fund will all be administered by ADB.\n\n51. \nADB will finance 64.9% of the total project cost, and the Government, 29.7%. The rest \nwill be financed by JFPR, the HIV/AIDS Cooperation Fund, and OFID.

The  organization  structure  for \nproject  implementation  is  shown  in  Appendix  6.  The  PMU  will  (i) implement  the  resettlement \nplan  in  association  with  the  Morobe  Provincial  Administration  (MPA),  (ii)  prepare  bidding \ndocuments and handle the bidding, (iii) manage the contracts, (iv) monitor the progress of the \nProject, (v) prepare applications for fund withdrawals, (vi) prepare the project progress reports \nand project completion report, (vii) maintain project accounts and financial records for auditing, \nand  (viii)  monitor  the  socioeconomic  impact  of  the  Project.  The  PMU  will  be  given  adequate \nfinancial authority to approve contract variations to facilitate project progress, and will manage \nthe  construction  supervision  contract  and  civil  works  contract  to  ensure  reasonable  progress \nand timely completion of the Project. The Project will provide 162 person-months of international \n\n                                                \n13 IPBC,  established  in  2002,  is  the  trustee  of  the  state  assets  and  state-owned  enterprises,  including  PPCL.  Its \nstrategic  objectives  include  mobilizing  resources  to  implement  government  policy  and  achieve  its  objectives,  and \ncatalyzing economic and social development. It reports to the minister for information and state enterprises and the \nNational Executive Council.  \n\n\f \n\n13    \n\nand national consulting services to strengthen the PMU in procurement, contract management, \nfinancial management, socioeconomic impact monitoring, and resettlement.  \n\n53. \nA  project  steering  committee  (PSC)  will  be  established  to  oversee  the  project \nimplementation and provide policy guidance. It will be chaired by IPBC\u2019s managing director and \nwill  have  the  director  of  IPBC\u2019s  infrastructure  planning  and  development  division  as  secretary. \nThe  other  members  will  be  senior  representatives  from  the  Departments  of  National  Planning \nand  Monitoring,  Treasury,  Justice  and  Attorney  General,  Lands  and  Physical  Planning, \nTransport,  and  Environment  and  Conservation,  the  Independent  Consumer  and  Competition \nCommission (ICCC), and Morobe Provincial Government (MPG), as well as the chairperson of \nPPCL\u2019s board of directors, and PPCL\u2019s chief executive officer. The PSC will be required to meet \nat least quarterly and provide ADB with minutes of the meetings.  \n\n54.  MPA, the Administrative arm of MPG, will be the Implementing Agency for the livelihood \nand  social  improvement  program  financed  by  JFPR  and  the  HIV/AIDS  awareness  and \nprevention program financed by the HIV/AIDS Cooperation Fund. However, disbursement and \nfinancial management will be centralized in PMU for sound internal control.  \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n55. \nThe Project will be implemented over 4 years, from 2008 to 2011. The pre-construction \nactivities,  such  as  detailed  engineering  design,  the  preparation  of  prequalification  and  bidding \ndocuments,  and  the  tendering  and  awarding  of  contracts,  began  in  January  2007  and  are \nexpected to be completed by 2008. The resettlement activities will begin in December 2007 and \nare also expected to be completed by 2008. The civil works for the port facilities are expected to \nstart by early 2009 and to be completed by 31 December 2011. The implementation schedule is \nin Appendix 7. \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n56. \nAll procurement for works under the ADB and OFID loans and the JFPR grant will follow \nADB\u2019s Procurement  Guidelines  (2007, as  amended  from  time  to  time). The  procurement  will \nconsist  mainly  of  civil  works  to  increase  the  capacity  of  Lae  port  and  the  works  necessary  to \nresettle 2,912 people and improve their livelihood. \n\nThe  major  civil  works  involving  dredging  and  the  construction  of  the  wharf  and  the \n57. \nterminal will be grouped into one contract package to attract international bidders, in view of the \nlack  of  local  capacity,  to  reduce  administrative  pressure  on  the  EA,  and  to  avoid  interfacing \nproblems.  It  will  follow  one-stage,  one-envelope  international  competitive  bidding  with \nprequalification.  \n\n58. \nThe  resettlement  and  livelihood  and  social  improvement  activities  will involve  contracts \nof various sizes, as detailed in the procurement plan in Appendix 8. National competitive bidding \nand shopping will be used as appropriate.  \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nInternational and national consulting services will be required to support the PMU in port \n59. \nengineering  and  contract  management, \nresettlement,  and \nsocioeconomic  monitoring,  and  in  construction  supervision  and  environmental  monitoring.  A \n\nfinancial  management, \n\n\f14\n\ntotal  of  729  person-months  of  consulting  services\u2014291  person-months  international  and \n438 person-months  national\u2014have  been  budgeted  for  these  purposes.  Various  consulting \nservices  will  also  be  required  to  carry  out  the  resettlement  and  livelihood  and  social \nimprovement activities and the HIV/AIDS prevention program (Appendix 8).  \n\n60. \nAll  consulting  services  financed  with  loans  from  ADB  and  grants  from  JFPR  and  the \nHIV/AIDS  Cooperation  Fund  will  be  engaged  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Individual consultants will be selected for the \nservices  in port  engineering  and contract  management,  financial  management,  socioeconomic \nmonitoring,  and  resettlement.  An  international  consulting  firm  will  be  recruited  through \nquality- and  cost-based  selection  for  construction  supervision  and  environmental  monitoring. \nIPBC has requested ADB to select the consultants to speed up the Project, as time is critical to \nits  success.  The  terms  of  reference  for  support  to  the  PMU  and  construction  supervision  are \noutlined  in  Appendixes  9  and  10.  For  the  component  to  be  financed  by  the  HIV/AIDS \nCooperation  Fund,  the  Lae  Chamber  of  Commerce  and  Industry  will  be  recruited  through \nsingle-source selection.14\n\n5. \n\nAdvance Action and Retroactive Financing \n\nThe  Project  is  revenue-generating.  As  time  is  critical  to  the  financial  and  economic \n61. \nviability  of  the  Project,  the  Government  has  asked  ADB  to  approve  advance  action  for  the \nrecruitment  of  consultants  and  the  procurement  of  civil  works.  Advance  action  covers \nprequalification,  invitation  of  bids,  bidding,  bid  evaluation,  and  limited  contract  award.  The \nadvance  action  will  conform  to  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  and  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants. The Government has been advised that approval of the advance action, if granted, \ndoes not commit ADB to financing the Project. \n\nTo meet the implementation schedule, the pre-construction activities must start in 2007. \n62. \nThe  Project  will  provide  retroactive  financing  for  project  management  and  resettlement  costs, \nincluding  consulting  services.  The  retroactive  financing  will  apply  to  expenditures  incurred  no \nearlier  than  12  months  before  the  date  of  the  Loan  Agreement.  The  Government  has  been \ninformed that the amount of retroactive financing must not exceed 20% of the ADB loan amount \nand that approval of retroactive financing does not commit ADB to financing the Project.   \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n63. \nwith  the  Government  and  IPBC,  both  of  which  must  adhere  to  its  requirements  during  project \nimplementation.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any \nallegations  of  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To \nsupport these efforts, relevant provisions of the Anticorruption Policy will be included in the loan \n\n                                                \n14 The  Lae  Chamber  of  Commerce  is  a  private  sector  entity  representing  a  majority  of  the  businesses  in  Morobe \nprovince. It is recognized for its (i) demonstrated commitment to promoting innovative socially responsible practices \nin  Morobe  province;  (ii)  high  representation  of  businesses  involved  in  infrastructure  and  economic  development; \n(iii) availability of local office and dedicated staff in Lae; (iv) extended presence and outreach of its programs and \ninitiatives in Lae and Huon districts; (v) demonstrated ability to partner with a broad range of government agencies, \nespecially  the  Morobe  Provincial  AIDS  Council  and  civil  society  NGOs,  faith-based  organizations,  and \ncommunity-based  organizations  involved  in  HIV/AIDS  prevention,  treatment,  and  care;  and  (vi)  adequate \naccounting, financial management, and auditing standards. \n\n\f \n\n15    \n\nregulations and bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts to be financed by \nADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  will  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit \nand examine the records and accounts of IPBC and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and \nother service providers as they relate to the Project. If ADB determines that representatives of \nthe  Government,  a  beneficiary,  a  contractor,  or  a  consultant  have  engaged  in  corrupt, \nfraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices,  ADB  may  take  the  following  actions:  (i) reject  the \nproposal  for  contract  award,  or  (ii)  declare  the  firm  or  individual  ineligible  for  ADB-financed \ncontracts, indefinitely or for a stated period of time. \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n64. \nThe  proceeds  of  the  loans  from  ADB  and  OFID  and  the  grants  from  JFPR  and  the \nHIV/AIDS  Cooperation  Fund  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time), through direct payment, payment via imprest \naccount,  and  reimbursement.  To  facilitate  project  implementation  and  funds  flow,  IPBC  will \nestablish separate imprest accounts for the loans from ADB and the grants from JFPR and the \nHIV/AIDS Cooperation Fund at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB after the loans and grants \ntake  effect.  IPBC  will  use  the  imprest  accounts  exclusively  to  finance  eligible  expenditures  as \nspecified in the loan and grant agreements. The initial amount to be deposited into each imprest \naccount  will  not  exceed  either  6  months  of  estimated  expenditures  to  be  financed  from  the \nimprest account or 10% of the loan or grant amount, whichever is less.15 For the contract for the \ndredging  and  wharfing  civil  works  and  international  consulting  services,  direct  payment  or \nreimbursement will be used. The OFID loan for the joint cofinancing of port facilities under the \nProject will be administered by ADB, and disbursed by OFID through direct payment. \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nIPBC,  through  the  PMU,  will  maintain  separate  accounts  for  the  Project  and  prepare \n65. \nseparate financial statements indicating the sources and uses of funds, and have them audited \nby an independent auditor acceptable to ADB. The audited project accounts, IPBC\u2019s corporate \naccounts, and the respective auditors\u2019 reports (which should include a separate audit opinion on \nthe use of the imprest account for the loan or grant) will be submitted to ADB within 6 months \nafter the end of each fiscal year. IPBC, through the PMU, will also prepare and submit to ADB \nmonthly and quarterly project progress reports, and a project completion report within 3 months \nof the completion of the Project. \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n66.  Within  12  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  ADB  and  the  Government  will  agree  on  a \nsystem for monitoring and evaluating the performance of the Project in relation to its goals and \npurposes, with emphasis on trade, economic activities, job creation, and livelihood improvement. \nSix person-months of international consulting services are provided under the Project for setting \nup the system with baseline data and assessing the socioeconomic impact of the Project. The \ninternational  consultant  will  begin  work  before  the  Project  starts.  The  international  financial \nspecialist will collect and enter data into the system. Annual performance monitoring reports and \nthe  final  report  will  be  prepared  by  the  socioeconomist  and  submitted  to  the  PMU  and  IPBC. \nIPBC  will  submit  to  ADB  the  annual  performance  monitoring  reports  within  3  months  after  the \n\n                                                \n15 The imprest accounts  will be used prudently according to the actual needs of the Project and the capacity of the \n\nExecuting Agency to liquidate advances. \n\n\f16\n\nend  of  each  calendar  year,  and  the  final  report  within  3  months  after  project  completion.  The \nindicators may include (i) industrial and commercial activities, (ii) job creation, (iii) exports and \nimports,  (iv)  traffic  volume,  (v)  port  charges,  (vi) income  generation,  and  (vii)  social  services. \nThe  employment  impact  indicators  will  include  information  about  unskilled  laborers,  poor \nlaborers, and women laborers. \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\nADB,  the  Government,  and  IPBC  will  undertake  semi-annual  and  midterm  reviews  to \n67. \nconsider (i) the compliance to the loan covenants; (ii) physical achievements against milestones \nalong with any reasonable changes, and disbursement and financial progress; and (iii) Project \nimplementation  issues  requiring  resolution  or  action.  The  midterm  review  shall  be  undertaken \nwithin 24 months of the loan effectiveness date.  \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACT, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nEconomic Benefit \n\n1. \n\nTraffic Forecast \n\n68. \nTraffic forecasts up to 2030 for overseas and coastal cargo have been prepared for Lae \nport.  Reflecting  a  strong  relationship  between  cargo  volume  and  the  growth  of  the  PNG \neconomy, the forecasts are based on expected GDP growth. For 2007\u20132011, GDP is assumed \nto grow at 4% on average, in line with the projections presented in the 2007 National Budget. \nAfter 2011, an average GDP growth rate of 3% is assumed. The traffic forecasts for the Project \nare summarized in Appendix 11. \n\n2. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\nThe  economic  analysis  (Appendix  11)  compares  with-  and  without-Project  scenarios. \n69. \nThe  assessment  covers  the  period  2008\u20132030  and  assumes  a  construction  period  of  4  years \nstarting in 2008. All benefits and costs are in constant 2007 prices. \n\nThe economic costs of the tidal basin are (i) capital cost, including labor, equipment and \n70. \nmaterials,  consulting  services,  and  physical  contingency;  (ii)  land  cost;  (iii)  resettlement  cost; \nand  (iv)  maintenance  cost.  The  economic  benefits  arise  from  (i)  savings  in  congestion  costs \n(i.e., in vessel waiting time and inventory costs), (ii) reduced need for lighterage and diversion of \ntransshipment  to  other  ports,  (iii)  income  generated  by  a  larger  coastal  shipping  and  port \nindustry,  and  (iv) productivity  gains  for  private  businesses  and  smallholders  from  a  more \nefficient  transport  system.  The  Project  will  also  have  other  benefits,  such  as  supporting  the \ndelivery  of  essential  social  services  and  minimizing  the  cost  of  consumer  goods.  These \nadditional  benefits  are  difficult  to  quantify  and  are  therefore  not  included  in  the  economic \nassessment.  \n\n71. \nAt a 12% discount rate, the Project is economically viable. The net present value (NPV) \nis  about  K104  million  and  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  is  about  15.8%.  The \nsavings  in  congestion  costs,  and  income  from  a  larger  coastal  shipping  and  port  industry,  are \nimportant  benefits.  But  the  key  to  the  Project  is  the  flow-on  benefits  from  the  additional \n\n\f \n\n17    \n\ninternational and coastal shipping it makes possible. The larger capacity at Lae port will provide \nsubstantial  productivity  benefits  to  private  businesses  and  smallholders  by  allowing  them  to \nengage in higher-value-added activities, notably the export of agricultural products to overseas \nmarkets.  The  expanded  port  capacity  is  also  important  in  minimizing  costs  in  the  economy  by \nallowing the import of key items that are not produced locally. \n\n72. \nThe EIRR calculation was subjected to sensitivity analysis to test the effects of negative \nchanges  in  the  key  parameters  that  determine  the  benefits  and  costs  of  the  Project.  The \nsensitivity  analysis  showed  the  Project  to  be  economically  viable  despite  a  10%  increase  in \ncosts or a 10% decrease in benefits or a 1-year delay in the construction period.  \n\nThe financial analysis assumes that PPCL will operate the new port facilities built under \n\nB. \n\nFinancial Benefit \n\n73. \nthe Project. \n\n1. \n\nTariff Analysis \n\n74. \nTariffs  for  essential  services  are  regulated  by  a  contract  between  PPCL  and  ICCC. \nEssential services are defined in the contract as wharfage, berthing, and berth reservation. An \nanalysis  was  undertaken  to  evaluate  the  level  of  tariff  necessary  for  PPCL  to  maintain  an \naverage  15%  pretax  return  on  equity  (ROE),  at  the  company  level,  for  10  years  after  project \ncompletion.  The  analysis  was  undertaken  for  Phase  I  of  the  Tidal  Basin  development,  which \nexcludes $29.51 million dredging costs for Phase II.16 The 15% return is considered appropriate \nfor the industry and region and is consistent with the equity risk\u2013weighted return factor used in \nthe  calculation  of  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC).  Financial  statements,  including \nproject  costs,  were  projected  for  PPCL  as  a  whole  through  2021.  Based  on  this  evaluation,  a \n26.7%  one  time  composite  tariff  increase  applicable  to  all  ports  or  57.3%  one  time  composite \ntariff increase for Lae Port in 2012 are projected to provide a 15% average ROE at the company \nlevel through 2021.\n\n2. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n75. \nFinancial  projections  have  been  prepared  for  PPCL  (Appendix  12)  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects (2005) to assess the \nfinancial  viability  and  sustainability  of  the  Project.  The  financial  evaluation  was  undertaken  in \nreal  terms  using  constant  2007  prices.  The  project  cost  estimates  and  financial  projections  in \nnominal  terms  were  converted  into  real  terms  by  adjusting  for  the  projected  effects  of  foreign \nand  domestic  inflation  and  currency  fluctuation.  Incremental  costs  and  benefits  were  derived \nunder with- and without-project scenarios.  \n\n76. \nAssuming  the  existing  revenue  items  remain  the  only  sources  of  revenue,  applying \n57.3% Lae-specific increase in tariffs in 2012 to project cash flows, and removing $29.12 million \ncosts for Phase II, the after-tax financial internal rate of return (FIRR) is 6.82%, which compares \nfavorably  with  the  WACC  of  5.09%.  The  results  of  the  sensitivity  analyses  (10%  reduction  in \n\n                                                \n16 These dredging works are to be undertaken jointly with Phase I so as to facilitate port expansion in a cost effective \nmanner.  A  matching  revenue  flow  will  only  be  generated  when  additional  investment  is  made  in  wharfs,  loading \nequipment, storage areas etc under Phase II. It is preferable that tariffs are set at a level that recovers the dredging \ncosts when Phase II begins operation. \n\n\fdemand,  1-year  delay  in  construction,  10%  increase  in  project  costs,  and  10%  reduction  in \ntariffs)  confirm  the  robustness  of  the  Project\u2019s  financial  viability.  Details  of  the  financial \nevaluation are found in Appendix 12. \n\n18\n\nC. \n\nProject Impact \n\n1. \n\nResettlement \n\nThe Project is classified as category A in line with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy\n77. \n(1995).  It  requires  the  acquisition  of  120  hectares  of  government-owned  marshland,  which  is \nnow occupied by 482 households (2,912 people), and an all-weather canoe landing site with an \nassociated  market  about  2  km  away  from  the  project  area,  which  is  now  used  by  three  Labu \nvillages. The resettlement site for the 482 households will be leased by the Government from its \ncustomary owners that use it as farmland.  \n\nA full resettlement plan conforming to ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) and \n78. \nthe Operations  Manual, section  2  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (2006),  defines  entitlements, \nproject  interventions,  and  implementation  arrangements  on  the  basis  of  a  comprehensive \nsocioeconomic  survey.  The  resettlement  and  livelihood  and  social  improvement  costs  are \nestimated  at  $6.7  million.  The  Government  and  ADB  will  finance  the  resettlement  costs,  and \nJFPR, the livelihood and social improvement costs. With these funds, the Project can ensure, in \nline with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy, that no one will be worse off as a result of the \nProject. The resettlement plan is summarized in Appendix 13. \n\n2. \n\nPoverty Reduction Impact \n\nPNG  is  suffering  from  rising  poverty.  A  World  Bank  assessment  in  2004 17 noted  a \n79. \nsignificant  increase  in  the  incidence  of  poverty  from  37.5%  in  1996  to  54%  in  2003.  While \neconomic  growth  may  not  necessarily  benefit  the  poor,  economic  contraction  will  certainly  be \ndetrimental to them. The poor suffer most during the economic downturn, because it takes a toll \non infrastructure, social services, and law and order\u2014all of which are fundamental to economic \nactivities  and  income  generation.  There  was  a  direct  linkage  between  the  long  period  of \neconomic contraction in the 1990s up to 2002 and an increase in poverty in PNG.  \n\n80. \nThe  Project  will  contribute  to  economic  growth  by  promoting  industrial  and  commercial \ninvestment  and  trade.  Investment  and  trade  are  the  engines  of  economic  growth  and  income \ngeneration.  The  Project  will  play  a  catalytic  role  in  developing  a  swamp  area  that  now  has \nnegligible  economic  and  financial  value  into  an  industrial  park  or  free-trade  zone,  where  the \ncountry\u2019s  export  products  can  be  processed  and  take  on  added  value  before  being  exported. \nAlthough  it  does  not  systemically  address  poverty  reduction  and  is  classified  as  a  general \nintervention, the Project will contribute to some extent to poverty reduction in Lae city through \njob creation, resettlement, and livelihood improvement. The Project will (i) generate more than \n1,000 \nin  Lae\u2014during \nimplementation;  (ii)  create  employment  opportunities  for  local  populations  employed  as \nseafarers, sea workers, and port agents and operators; and (iii) become another stable source \nof  income  after  its  completion  for  the  stevedoring  companies,  which  are  50%  owned  by  local \nethnic groups. Industrial and commercial development resulting from the Project will add at least \nhundreds  of  job  opportunities.

Washington, DC. \n\n\f \n\n19    \n\nenhancement  activities  and  social  services  financed  by  JFPR,  will  provide  the  poor  settlers  in \nthe project area with better living conditions, social services, and opportunities for employment. \nThe summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 14. \n\n3. \n\nSocial and Gender Impact \n\n81. \nDuring project preparation, the potential social and gender impact of the Project and the \nrelated  increase  in  sea  and  road  traffic  and  connectivity  was  analyzed  through  field  surveys, \nfocus  group  discussions,  and  interviews  with  key  informants.  These  consultations  were \ncomplemented  by  discussions  with  government  agencies,  including  MPA,  the  Lae  district \nadministration (LDA), the National AIDS Council, and the Morobe Provincial AIDS Council; civil \nsociety  NGOs,  including  the  National  Council  of  Women,  the  Morobe  Provincial  Council  of \nWomen,  community-based  organizations  and  faith-based  organizations;  major  local  ethnic \ngroups  including  Labu  Holdings  Ltd.  and  the  Ahi  Landowner  Group;  and  the  private  sector \nincluding the Lae Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Lae port users. The consultations, \nwhich were documented, confirmed widespread support for the Project. \n\n82.  Women  and  vulnerable  groups  will  not  be  disproportionately  affected  by  the  Project. \nInterventions for women and vulnerable groups, intended to promote gender and social equity, \nare  part  of  the  Project.  The  JFPR  grant  will  finance  training  for  women  in  child  care,  health, \nhygiene,  and  vocational  skills,  and  provide  opportunities  for  women  to  avail  themselves  of \nmicro-credit to start a business. The HIV/AIDS prevention program will further mitigate risks for \nwomen.\n\n4. \n\nEnvironmental Impact \n\n83. \nThe Project is classified as environmental category A by ADB. It involves the clearance \nof  about  120  hectares  of  bush,  and  the  dredging  and  reclamation  of  about  6.5  million \ncubic meters of material\u20143.4 million cubic meters unsuitable and 3.1 cubic meters suitable.  \n\n84. \nA full environmental impact assessment of the Project was carried out under the PPTA. \nProject  impact  on  flora  and  fauna  was  extensively  assessed.  The  Project  is  in  a  swamp  area \nwhose  vegetation  was  removed  in  the  1980s.  The  current  vegetation  consists  of  secondary \nplant growth. No ecologically important or protected species were found. \n\nThe impact on the vegetation in the project area will be irreversible. However, the impact \n85. \nis  considered  minor  in  view  of  the  advanced  degree  of  degradation  of  the  existing  vegetation \nand the virtual absence of natural value. \n\nA major environmental concern is the disposal of 3.4 million cubic meters of unsuitable \n86. \ndredged material in the ocean. The disposal of dredged material was initially governed by the \nLondon  Convention  of  1972,  which  will  be  entirely  superseded  by  the  Protocol  to  the  London \nConvention of 1996. Unlike the London Convention, which specified substances that cannot be \ndumped at sea, the Protocol specifies seven categories of material that may be dumped at sea \nsubject  to  appropriate  precautions  and  specified  criteria.  Dredged  material  is  one  of  the \ncategories.\n\nTwo  soil  tests  were  conducted  by  two  different  consulting  companies  to  determine  the \n87. \ndisposal option. The first one was carried out by Haskoning Nederland BV, the Netherlands, the \nPPTA  consultant,  and  the  results  were  compared  with  the  Dutch  Standard  2000,  as  PNG  has \n\n\f20\n\nnot  developed  its  own  standard.  The  copper  and  nickel  content  was  found  to  exceed  test \nvalues,  but  by  not  more  than  50%.  Accordingly,  in  the  view  of  Haskoning  Nederland  BV,  the \nmaterial dredged from the project area can be dumped at sea. To reconfirm the marine disposal \noption,  Sinclair  Knight  Merz,  Australia  (SKM)  undertook  another  soil  study  conforming  to  the \nAustralian  National  Ocean  Disposal  Guidelines  for  Dredged  Material.  The  laboratory  testing \nresults  led  SKM  to  conclude  that  the  high  concentration  of  metals  reflects  the  natural \nenvironment and that the sediment from the dredge area is nontoxic and acceptable for ocean \ndisposal according to the disposal guidelines.  \n\n88. \nThe  disposal  option  will  be  an  integral  part  of  the  bidding  documents  and  will  be \nimplemented  through  the  construction  contract.  The  contractor  will  be  required  to  release  the \ndredge fines at sufficient depth by means of a vertical pipe to avoid resuspension in the surface \nwaters  and  subsequent  dispersal  by  tidal  or  other  currents.  The  Project  provides  a  total  of \n20 person-months  of  international  consulting  services  under  construction  supervision  for \nstringent environmental monitoring and enforcement. \n\n5. \n\nProject Risks \n\n89. \nResettlement  poses  the  greatest  risk  to  the  Project.  Risks  relate  to  internal  conflicts \nbetween  local  ethnic  groups,  conception  about  land  ownership,  procurement,  contract \nenforcement,  and  social  equity.  To  mitigate  the  risks,  extensive  dialogue  has  been  held  with \nlocal  groups,  at  which  evidence  of  government  ownership  of  the  project  area  has  been \npresented. Two major stakeholders, the Labu and the Ahi, who used to be hostile to each other, \nhave formed a Bulo Committee to coordinate the views of different clans. The resettlement and \nlivelihood  improvement  programs  equitably  address  the  concerns  of  the  resettling  people,  the \nLabu,  and  the  Ahi.  The  ADB  ADF  loan  will  finance  the  relocation  costs,  and  JFPR  the \ninterventions  aimed  at  income  and  livelihood  sustainability.  Implementation  responsibilities  will \nbe  split  between  IPBC  (resettlement)  and  the  MPA  (livelihood  and  social  improvement). \nContract  packages  and  procurement  methods  have  been  properly  defined  to  ensure  that \ncapable, reputable, and reliable NGOs, suppliers, and contractors are hired.  \n\nAnother major risk is corruption, given the size of the Project, and the context in which \n90. \nthe  Project  will  be  implemented.  The  risk  is  heightened  by  the  need  to  hire  contractors  and \nconsultants to implement the Project. To mitigate the risk of corruption, (i) all PMU management \nand staff will be trained in ADB\u2019s and the Government\u2019s anticorruption policies,18 the concept of \nwhistle-blowing, and methods of reducing vulnerability to corruption; (ii) IPBC will develop and \nmaintain  a  project  website  to  disclose  the  audited  project financial  accounts,  project  progress, \nand  procurement  activities;  (iii)  the  imprest  accounts  will  be  prudently  used  and  closely \nmonitored; (iv) ADB will select key consultants in consultation with IPBC, and review beforehand \nthe bidding documents and contract awards for all international and national competitive bidding \ncontracts;  and  (v) financial  management  will  be  centralized  in  the  PMU  for  internal  control. \nIdentifying IPBC as the EA further mitigates the risk of corruption, as Transparency International \nis  represented  on  the  IPBC  board  of  directors,  and  IPBC  is  among  the  organizations  that  are \nPNG\u2019s most closely watched.  \n\n91. \nOther  risks  pertain  to  law  and  order,  project  management,  construction  quality,  and \nHIV/AIDS  prevalence.  The  project  design  takes  those  potential  risks  into  account.  The \nGovernment will be required to provide security during the project implementation and IPBC will \n                                                \n18  Including  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  and  zero-tolerance  position,  and  the \n\nGovernment\u2019s commitments under the Anti-Corruption Action Plan for Asia and the Pacific. \n\n\f \n\n21    \n\nassign  a  team  of  qualified  counterpart  staff  to  establish  the  PMU.  In  addition,  the  Project  will \nprovide  162  person-months  of  international  and  national  consulting  services  to  strengthen  the \nPMU \nfinancial  management,  socioeconomic  monitoring,  and \nresettlement. It will also finance the services of a construction supervision team to enforce the \ncivil works contract and verify its quality.  \n\nin  contract  management, \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  IPBC  have  given  the \n\n92. \nfollowing assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nCounterpart  financing.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  throughout  the \nimplementation  of  the  Project,  adequate  budgetary  allocations  of  the  required \ncounterpart funds are made, approved, and released in a timely manner in order \nto ensure the proper implementation of the Project. \n\nProject management unit. The Government will cause IPBC to ensure that the \nPMU remains fully staffed and adequately funded throughout the implementation \nof the Project. \n\nProject  steering  committee.  Within  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the \nGovernment will ensure that the PSC has been established.  \n\nConstruction  quality.  The  Government  will  cause  IPBC  to  ensure  that  the \nProject  is  built  in  accordance  with  the  technical  design  specifications  and  that \nconstruction  supervision,  quality  control,  and  contract  management  are \nimplemented in accordance with internationally accepted standards. \n\nlaws, \n\nEnvironment. The Government will ensure that the Project is carried out, and all \nproject facilities are designed, constructed, operated, maintained, and monitored, \nin  compliance  with  all  applicable  PNG  environmental  laws  and  regulations,  and \nADB\u2019s Environment  Policy  (2002).  In  case  of  any  discrepancies  between  the \nPNG\u2019s  environmental \nregulations,  and  procedures  and  ADB\u2019s \nrequirements, ADB\u2019s Environment Policy will prevail. The Government and IPBC \nwill  implement  and  comply  with  the  environmental  management  plan  (EMP) \nincluded  in  the  final  environmental  impact  assessment.  The  Government  and \nIPBC  will  submit  semiannual  reports  to  ADB  on  the  implementation  of  and \ncompliance  with  the  EMP.  The  dumping  of  dredged  sediment  offshore  shall  be \npermitted only if appropriate mitigation measures are in place and conducted in \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy and applicable laws and regulations \nof the Government.\n\n(vi) \n\nProject  Performance  and  Management  System.  The Government  will  cause \nIPBC to establish a project performance and monitoring system, and monitor and \nevaluate project impact to ensure that the Project is managed effectively and the \nbenefits are maximized. \n\n(vii) Monitoring.  The  Government  will  cause  IPBC  to  ensure  that  the  project \nstakeholders  are  involved  in  monitoring  the  implementation  of  the  Project.  This \n\n\f22\n\ninclude  ensuring \n\nthe  representatives  of \nshall \nstakeholders on a regular basis to report on the delivery of project inputs, and the \neffectiveness of project interventions.\n\nthe  PMU  meet  with \n\nthat \n\nInvoluntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  and \n\n(viii) Resettlement.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  land  to  be  utilized  or \nacquired  under  the  Project  for  the  port  facilities  is  government-owned  land  and \nthat the land is not subject to any ownership dispute. The Government and IPBC \nshall ensure that the resettlement activities under the Project are implemented in \nthe \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nresettlement  plan  agreed  upon  between  ADB  and  the  Government.  The \nGovernment and IPBC shall further ensure that (a) the people who are required \nto be relocated or have their assets dispossessed or both under the Project shall \nhave  been  given  adequate  compensation  and  other  related  resettlement \nassistance  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  and  the \nresettlement plan prior to their relocation or the dispossession of their assets; (b) \nthe  Malahang  resettlement  site  shall  have  been  fully  developed  and  ready  for \noccupation  prior  to  the  relocation  of  the  people  affected  by  the  Project;  and  (c) \nthe  new  boat  landing  facility  and  fish  market  in  SP  Beach  shall  have  been  fully \ndeveloped  and  operational,  prior  to  the  acquisition  of  the  existing  boat  landing \nsite  and  the  associated  fish  market  in  Landaun  Market  for  the  purpose  of  the \nProject.\n\n(ix) \n\nLabor,  health,  and  gender  development. The Government will cause IPBC to \nensure that civil works contractors engaged under the Project (a) comply with all \napplicable  labor  laws  and  related  international  treaty  obligations,  and  do  not \nemploy  child  labor  under  the  Project;  (b)  provide  information  to  all  construction \nworkers during the construction period on the prevention of sexually transmitted \ninfections, including HIV/AIDS, in health and safety programs; (c) provide prompt \nand  equal  pay  to  men  and  women  for  work  of  equivalent  value  in  accordance \nwith  national  laws  and  international  treaty  obligations;  (d)  provide  safe  working \nconditions  for  both  male  and  female  workers;  and  (e)  provide  separate  and \nculturally  appropriate  facilities  for  men  and  women  workers.  The  Government  \nwill cause IPBC to ensure that specific provisions to this effect are included in the \nbidding  documents  and  contracts  for  civil  works.  The  Government  will  cause \nIPBC  to  monitor  compliance  and  report  to  ADB  on  the  implementation  of  these \nactivities in the project progress reports. \n\n(x) \n\nSecurity  measures.  The  Government  will  undertake  the  measures  required  to \nprovide  adequate  security  for  the  smooth  and  uninterrupted  implementation  of \nthe  Project.  The  Government  will  also  ensure  that  (a)  all  civil  works  contracts \nrequire the preparation of an action plan for adequate security for the smooth and \nuninterrupted implementation of the Project, (b) the cost of implementing such a \nplan  is  included  in  the  budget  for  such  civil  works,  and  (c)  such  plan  is  fully \nimplemented.\n\n(xi) \n\nTariff.

Only the ports of Lae, \nMoresby,  Madang,  Kimbe,  and  Rabaul  have  appropriate  port  infrastructure  and  receive \ninternational  as  well  as  coastal  traffic.  Private  organizations  also  establish  and  operate  port \nfacilities  where  government  ports  do  not  exist  or  where  there  are  greater  benefits.  This  is \nparticularly the case for forestry, petroleum, mining companies, and some agricultural firms. \n\nCargo  Throughput.  Of  22  declared  ports,  PNG  Port  Corporation  Limited  (PPCL) \n2.\noperates  16  major  ports,  including  two  ports  operated  by  its  agents.  The  16  ports  are  Aitape, \nAlotau,  Buka,  Daru,  Kavieng,  Kieta,  Kimbe,  Lae,  Lorengau,  Madang,  Moresby,  Oro  Bay, \nRabaul,  Samarai,  Wewak,  and  Vanimo.  The  other  six  ports  are  either  not  in  operation  or  are \noperated by commercial entities. \n\n3. \nAbout  90%  of  vessel  calls  and  more  than  80%  of  PNG\u2019s  international  and  domestic \ncargo  are  handled  at  PPCL-operated  ports.  The  throughput  at  the  various  ports  in  the  past \n10 years  is  shown  in  Figure  A2.  The  increase  in  cargo  handled  since  2002  is  noticeable.  The \nports of Lae and Port Moresby account for over 70% of the total throughput. Kimbe represents \n8%, and Rabaul, 6%. \n\nFigure A2: Volumes of Cargo Handled in PPCL Ports \n(revenue tons) \n\n6,000,000 \n\n5,000,000\n\n4,000,000\n\n3,000,000\n\n2,000,000 \n\n1,000,000\n\n-\n\n1995  1996 \n\n1997  1998  1999\n\n2000\n\n2001  2002\n\n2003 \n\n2004  2005 \n\nPort Moresby \n\nDaru \n\nOrobay\n\nAlotau\n\nLae\n\nMadang\n\nWewak \n\nKimbe\n\nKavieng\n\nBuka\n\nKieta \n\nVanimo\n\nRabaul\nPPCL = PNG Ports Corporation Limited.  \nSource: PPCL. \n\nLae \n\n\f28\n\nAppendix 2\n\nB. \n\nLae Port \n\n4. \nLae port  is  PNG\u2019s  single  most  important  port  for  international  and  domestic  trade. \nTable A2 gives details of its growing share in the total volume of cargo handled by PPCL from \n1995 to 2005. \n\nTable A2: Share of Lae Port in Cargo Handled by PPCL in 1995 and 2005 \n\nImports \n\n \n\nExports \n\nTotal \n\n1995 \n\n2005 \n\n1995 \n\n2005 \n\n2005 \n\n    1995 \n\n2005 \n\nTransit \n\n \n     1995 \n\n(%)\n\n62.6 \n57.3 \n0.0 \n15.2 \n39.4 \n\n66.7 \n45.0 \n\n54.8 \n59.9 \n50.5 \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n60.3 \n15.3 \n0.0 \n9.1 \n28.0 \n\n61.1 \n51.3 \n\n44.9 \n54.1 \n42.3 \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n11.8 \n\n10.3 \n11.3 \n\n48.4 \n \n \n \n \n \n36.1 \n44.6 \n\n49.9 \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n37.7 \n45.5 \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n54.3 \n \n \n \n \n \n47.0 \n51.0 \n\nItem\n\nOverseas \n\nContainers \nBreak-bulk \nPalm Oil \nFuel \n\nTotal \nCoastal \n\nContainers \nBreak-bulk \nPalm Oil \nFuel \n\nTotal \nTotal\n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n54.9 \n62.3 \n\n59.0 \n57.5 \n\n24.6 \n16.9 \n\n0.2 \n19.4 \n47.6 \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n64.7 \n60.6 \n\n39.2 \n62.4 \n\n28.7 \n30.5 \n\n55.6 \n35.6 \n51.8 \n\nPPCL = PNG Ports Corporation Limited. \n\nSource: PPCL. \n\n5. \nThe rapid increase in cargo volume since 2002 has led to congestion at Lae port. Unless \nport  capacity  is  expanded  to  accommodate  the  rising  volume  of  imports  and  exports,  vessel \nwaiting times may increase to the limit that shipping companies decide not to call at the port any \nlonger. PNG\u2019s economy and its potential to develop will then be seriously affected.  \n\nC. \n\nIndependent Public Business Corporation (IPBC) \n\n6. \nIPBC was established in 2002 by the IPBC Act to succeed the Privatization Commission. \nIt is the trustee and manager of all the assets vested in the General Business Trust, including 23 \nstate-owned enterprises (SOEs) and state equities in various local companies in the mining and \npetroleum  and  other  industries.  Its  board  of  directors  comprises  representatives  from \nTransparency  International,  the  Department  of  the  Attorney  General,  the  PNG  Trade  Union \nCongress,  the  PNG  Chamber  of  Commerce,  the  National  Council  of  Women,  and  the \nDepartment of Treasury. \n\n7. \nAccording  to  the  IPBC  Amendment  Act  of  8  June  2007,  IPBC\u2019s  strategic  objectives \ninclude  (i)  catalyzing  economic  and  social  development,  and  (ii)  mobilizing  resources  to \nimplement  government  policy  and  achieve  its  objectives.  Its  functions have  been  expanded  to \ninclude acting as a central borrowing and capital-raising authority for SOEs and as an agent for \nSOEs in negotiating, entering into, and carrying out financial arrangements.  \n\nFrom  2003  to  2005,  the  net  trust  income  rose  from  about  K23  million  to  almost  K34 \n\n8. \nmillion, and net trust assets, from K1.45 million to K3.24 million.  \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n29 \n\nD. \n\nPNG Ports Corporation Limited (PPCL) \n\n9. \nFrom 1963 to 2002, the major ports were owned and operated by PNG Harbours Board, \nestablished as a self-supporting commercial statutory authority fully owned by the Government. \nIn  2002,  the  Harbours  Board  was  corporatized  as  PNG  Harbours  Limited  (PNGHL)  as  a  first \nstep to privatizing the ports. In November 2006, PNGHL was renamed PNG Ports Corporation \nLtd. (PPCL), still a state-owned company under IPBC\u2019s trust.  \n\nBefore  it  was  corporatized  in  2002,  PPCL  was  badly  managed  and  had  poor  financial \n10. \nmanagement  and  planning  and  weak  internal  controls.  As  a  result,  it  operated  at  a  loss  from \n1998  to  2003.  However,  since  2004,  PPCL  has  recorded  profits:  K17.7  million  in  2004,  K5.6 \nmillion in 2005, and K22.6 million in 2006.1 The improved financial performance is the result of \nan increase in tariffs and a reduction in costs.  \n\nE. \n\nInstitutional Capacity Assessment  \n\n11. \n Although  it  has  a  staff  of  more  than  400,  which  is  not  a  small  number  for  handling \n16 ports, PPCL does not have core in-house capacity in port engineering, contract management \nand supervision, port operation, financial management, and information technology. As a result, \ncontract award processes are problematic and time-consuming, ongoing maintenance programs \nare  progressing  at  an  unacceptable  pace  or  are  at  a  standstill,  port  efficiency  is  low, \nmanagement  information  is  available  but  unprocessed,  and  financial  statements  have  been \ndisclaimed  by  the  auditor.\nIn  addition,  PPCL  has  well-established  systems  that  are  highly \nbureaucratic and inefficient. \n\n12. \nOn  the  other  hand,  IPBC  is  dynamic  and  proactive.  IPBC  is  the  trustee  of  23  SOEs \nincluding  PPCL.  It  also  owns  equity  in  some  local  enterprises.  Although  it  does  not  have \ncapacity at this stage, IPBC stands a better chance to mobilize a good team of professionals to \nstaff the PMU because (i) it has clean financial statements and a stronger financial position than \nPPCL;  (ii)  it  is  now  stable  after  election  and  has  good  management,  comprising  a  board  with \nrepresentation  from  Transparency  International  and  staff, mostly  from  the  private  sector;  (iii)  it \nwill be more devoted to the Project than PPCL, as PPCL has its own capital and maintenance \nprogram; and (iv) it is a young organization in the process of establishing itself, with a tendency \nto embrace institutions favorable to its growth.  \n\nF. \n\nIssues and Challenges \n\nRegulatory  Framework.  The  current  regulatory  framework  is  shaped  by government \n13.\ndecisions  on  the  privatization  of  the  ports.  In  2002,  before  the  election,  the  Government \nattempted  to  privatize  PNGHL  and  transferred  its  government  functions  to  the  Department  of \nTransport (DOT). After the election, the new government suspended the privatization program, \nand  eventually  decided  not  to  privatize  PNGHL  in  2005.  Instead,  PNGHL  has  been  put  under \nIPBC\u2019s  trusteeship  until  the  time  when  it  can  be  privatized,  while  its  tariff-setting  and  service \nstandards  are  regulated  by  a  10-year  contract  with  Independent  Consumer  and  Competition \nCommission (ICCC). With these developments and the creation of the National Maritime Safety \nAuthority  (NMSA),  the  division  of  responsibility  between  PPCL,  DOT,  and  NMSA  is  unclear. \nThere is confusion as to who should do what.  \n\n                                                \n1   Unaudited results from PPCL\u2019s management accounts. \n\n\f30\n\nAppendix 2\n\nPrivate  Sector  Participation.  Private  sector  participation  is  needed  to  provide \n14.\nnecessary financing for maintenance as well as managerial skills. However, of PPCL\u2019s 16 ports, \nonly  two  are  profitable,  three  just  manage  to  break  even,  and  the  rest  need  to  be \ncross-subsidized.  It  is a  challenge  for  PPCL  to  attract  increasing  participation  from  the  private \nsector,  and  to  ensure  efficient  and  effective  port  infrastructure  and  operations  in  the  remote \nareas  on  the  mainland  and  other  islands  of  PNG.  A  system  of  cross-subsidization  of  the \nnon-profitable  port  installations  will  always  be  required  and  will  need  to  be  included  in  any \narrangements made with the private sector. \n\nOperational  Issues. Currently, all decisions are made at PPCL\u2019s headquarters in Port \n15.\nMoresby. Operational and financial delegation of authority is low between the board of directors \nand the management, and between the headquarters and individual ports. While centralization \nhas led to some benefits, it has also caused inefficiency, indecisiveness, and irresponsiveness \nto port users. The problem is more manifest at Lae port, which is the largest port and generates \nmore  than  50%  of  PPCL\u2019s  revenue. On  the other  hand, the  current  Lae  port  management, \nwithout  substantial  capacity  building,  may  not  be  ready  to  take on greater  operational  and \nfinancial authority.  \n\nMaintenance.  Because  of  the  economic  downturn,  little  maintenance  was  done  in  the \n16.\n1990s in the port sector, as in other sectors. Almost all PPCL ports require maintenance. PPCL \nneeds to clear its maintenance backlog and move from a reactive to a proactive approach.  \n\nG. \n\nGovernment and PPCL\u2019s Strategy \n\nThe  Government  and  PPCL  have  organized  a  series  of  studies\u2014among  these,  the \n17. \nstrategic  and  organizational  review  prepared  by  CPCS  Transcom\u2014to  strengthen \nthe \nperformance and competitiveness of PPCL and the port sector. PPCL is restructuring the skill \nmix  within  the  organization  by  reducing  staff  without  appropriate  skills  and  recruiting  the \nnecessary staff through a competitive process. It has developed a 5-year maintenance program \nwith  a  total  budgeted  amount  of  K165  million.  For  2007,  K44  million  has  been  budgeted  for \nmaintenance.  The  Government  and  PPCL  have  also  agreed  that  an  appropriate  level  of \nfinancial and operational authority should be delegated to Lae port management once it is ready \nto take on greater responsibilities.  \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n31 \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE PORT AND MARITIME SECTOR \n\nA. \n\nLoan\n\nTable A3.1: Asian Development Bank \n\nLoan Number  Project Title \n0468-PNG \n0469-PNG \n0738-PNG \n1153-PNG \n1754-PNG \n2079-PNG \n \nB. \n\nTotal \nTechnical Assistance \n\nLae Port \nLae Port  \nPorts Development \nTransport Infrastructure Development \nRehabilitation of the Maritime Navigation \nCommunity Water Transport \n \n\nProject Title \nLae Port Development \nPort Development Study \nNavigational Aids Improvement Study \n\nTA Number \n0284-PNG \n0473-PNG \n0642-PNG \n0686-PNG  Management Information Systems Study \nSecond Ports Development \n1077-PNG \nPorts Subsector Tariff Revision and Training \n1304-PNG \nInstitutional Strengthening of the Ports Subsector \n1390-PNG \nRehabilitation of the Navigation Aids System \n3162-PNG \nCommunity Water-Transport Project \n3615-PNG \nLae Port Development - Tidal Basin Phase I \n4793-PNG \n \n\nTotal \n\nLoan Amount ($ million)\nOCR \n12.0 \n \n11.0 \n12.0 \n19.8 \n \n54.8 \n\nTotal \n12.000 \n   8.000 \n11.000 \n12.000 \n19.800 \n19.005 \n81.805 \n\nADF \n- \n  8.000 \n- \n- \n- \n19.005 \n27.005 \n\nType \nPP \nPP \nPP \nAD \nPP \nAD \nAD \nPP \nPP \nPP \n \n\nTA Amount  \n($)\n150,000 \n250,000 \n240,000 \n120,000 \n350,000 \n100,000 \n367,000 \n500,000 \n580,000 \n900,000 \n    3,557,000 \n\nDate\nApproved \n25 Sep 80 \n25 Sep 80 \n02 Jul 85 \n14 Jan 91 \n12 Sep 00 \n24 Mar 04 \n \n\nDate\nApproved \n06 Mar 79 \n29 Jul 82 \n10 Dec 84 \n02 Jul 85 \n02 Dec 88 \n30 May 90 \n18 Oct 90 \n01 Feb 99 \n21 Dec 00 \n30 May 06 \n\nAD = advisory, ADF = Asian Development Fund, OCR = ordinary capital resources, PNG = Papua New Guinea, PP = \nproject preparatory, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nTable A3.2: World Bank Group\n\nProject Name \nPorts Project (Kieta, Lae, Port Moresby, and Alotau) \nSecond Ports (Port Moresby and Samarai) \n \n\nTotal\n\n \n\nIBRD \n\nLoan Amount ($ million)\nIDA \n9.2 \n \n9.2 \n\nTotal \n 9.2 \n 3.5 \n12.7 \n\n3.5 \n3.5 \n\nDate\nApproved \n1972 \n1978 \n\nIBRD = International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, IDA = International Development Agency. \nSource: World Bank. \n\nTable A3.3: Australia \n\nProject Name \nOn Scene Oil Spill Model \nMaritime College Project \nRehabilitation of the Maritime Navigation Aids Systema \nBougainville Wharves Rehabilitation Project \nPNG International Shipping and Port Security (ISPS) Assistance Project \n\nTotal\n\nAmount \n(A$)\n128,000 \n8,700,000 \n800,000 \n11,500,000 \n54,000 \n21,182,000 \n\nDate\nApproved \n1993 \n1995 \n2000 \n2001 \n2004 \n\na Attached  to  Asian  Development  Bank.  2000.

Lae  port  plays  a  critical  role  in  the  distribution  of  local  production  within  PNG,  to  other \nPacific islands, and to more distant international markets, and in the import of consumer goods \nand production inputs. The growth in the economy has contributed to a large increase in traffic \nhandled at Lae port in recent years, from 1.7 million revenue tons in 2001 to 2.4 million revenue \ntons in 2005.1\n\nTraffic  forecasts  have  been  prepared  for  Lae  port  for  the  period  to  2030.  As  much  of \n2. \nPNG\u2019s international and coastal shipping passes through the port, there is a strong correlation \nbetween the cargo volume at the port and PNG\u2019s economic growth.2 Hence, projections of gross \ndomestic product (GDP) growth underpin the traffic forecasts. For the period up to 2011, GDP is \nassumed to grow at 4% per year, in line with projections presented in the 2007 National Budget. \nAfter 2011, growth of 3% per year is assumed.  \n\nB. \n\nEconomic Assessment \n\n1. \n\nGeneral \n\nAn analysis of Lae port shows that it will soon be unable to handle any more cargo. Yet \n3. \nthere is little if any capacity available at other ports in PNG to handle the growing overseas and \ncoastal  cargo.  Lae  port  will  become  a  major  bottleneck  in  the  economy  in  the  absence  of  an \nupgrade  in  its  capacity.  The  constraint  that  this  bottleneck  will  impose  on  shipping  activity  will \nindustrial,  and \ndamage  PNG\u2019s  aggregate \ncommercial development in the hinterland of Lae port.  \n\ntrade  performance  and \n\nimpede  agricultural, \n\n4. \nThe economic evaluation of the Project was carried out by comparing with-Project and \nwithout-Project  scenarios.  The  assessment  covers  the  period  2008\u20132030,  on  the  assumption \nthat construction will extend over a period of 4 years starting in 2008. All benefits and costs are \nin constant 2007 prices. \n\nDuring project preparation, various alternatives were considered, including improving the \n5. \nexisting port facilities, expanding Madang port, and increasing the use of air cargo. The Project \nis  considered  to  provide  the  least-cost  option.  Expanding  Madang  port  would  require  an \nupgrade of the road link between Madang and Lae and incur the ongoing cost of road transport. \nThe total cost of the Madang option is considered to be at least as high as that of the Project. \nFurthermore,  it  would  introduce  additional  risk  to  the  transport  system  as  PNG  has  a  poor \nrecord in maintaining the road network. The cost of air cargo is prohibitive. A key factor in favor \nof expanding Lae port is its central position as both a destination and a source of cargo. Other \nports could be expanded to provide an arrival point for imports, for redistribution to other parts of \nPNG, and a departure point for PNG exports from other parts of the country. But the other ports \n\n                                                \n1  These  volumes  are  exclusive  of  liquid  bulk  (346,000  revenue  tons  in  2001  and  248,000  revenue  tons  in  2005), \n\nbecause this cargo is handled at the dedicated oil terminal in the port of Lae. \n\n2   The elasticity of cargo handled in Lae port with respect to GDP is estimated at 1.7 for 1967 to 2005, 1.3 for 2003\u2013\n\n2011, 1.37 for 2011\u20132030. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n49\n\nlack  the  same  access  to  the  outward  trade  provided  by  the  Highlands  region,  the  agricultural \nand forestry activity surrounding Lae, and the manufacturing and processing operations already \nestablished in Lae. Another factor in favor of the Project is that the existing berths at Lae port \nhave  been  built  on  a  steep  foreshore  with  risks  of  geotechnical  instability.  The  Project  would \nprovide a backup in case of collapse at the existing berths. \n\n2. \n\nCosts \n\nProject economic costs include resettlement cost, land cost, dredging costs, and the cost \n6. \nof  constructing  the  berth  and  terminal.  Taxes  and  duties  are  excluded  from  the  economic \nassessment. Costs were divided into tradable and non-tradable components. The non-tradable \ncomponent is made up of land, labor, and housing material, and is estimated to represent 5% of \ncosts. Project land cost is based on willingness to pay, using the projected purchase and lease \nprices. To account for local unemployment and underemployment, costs for labor were adjusted \nby a shadow wage rate factor of 0.8 to arrive at the economic price/opportunity cost. The market \nprice  is  assumed  to  equal  the  opportunity  cost  for  all  other  cost  items.  A  standard  conversion \nfactor  of  0.933  was  applied  to  calculate  the  economic  price  of  non-traded  goods,  and  to \nestimate the opportunity cost of operating costs.3\n\n3. \n\nBenefits \n\n7. \nWithout  the  Project,  congestion  at  Lae  port  will  result  in  longer  ship  waiting  times  and \nhigher  inventory  costs  on  cargo.  The  Project  will  reduce  these  congestion  costs  while  also \nallowing a higher level of shipping activity than would otherwise be possible. This higher level of \nshipping activity is important in four key respects:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nA  larger  coastal  shipping  and  port  industry  would  generate  additional  value \nadded, notably though the employment of additional labor. \n\nIt  would  avoid  the  need  to  divert  transshipments  to  alternative  ports,  or  to  use \nlighterage services to unload cargo. \n\nIt  would  allow  export  activity  that  would  otherwise  not  take  place.  Most  of  the \nPNG population is dependent on agriculture for cash incomes. The export of tree \ncrops  is  particularly  important  as  a  means  of  supplementing  subsistence \nlifestyles and lifting the standard of living above the poverty line. In the absence \nof this export activity, the economy\u2019s resources would be used. But they would be \nused in less productive and hence lower-income activities. \n\nIt would allow the import of additional production inputs. PNG\u2019s shallow economic \nstructure  leads  to  a  high  dependency  on  manufactured  imports,  from  vehicles \nand  boat  engines  to  building  materials  to  basic  food  processing  equipment.  A \nloss  of  access  to  these  items  would  prevent  some  activities  from  taking  place \n(e.g., some transport services would not be provided and some fishing would not \ntake place). It would also tend to reduce the efficiency of other activities (e.g., by \nrequiring  equipment  to  be  used  beyond  its  economic  life  or  by  preventing \n\n                                                \n3 The standard conversion factor is equal to the weighted average adjustment factor made in deriving the economic \n\nopportunity cost of construction. \n\n\f50\n\nAppendix 11\n\nmaintenance). The loss of access to imported production inputs would lower the \noverall productivity of the economy. \n\n8. \nThe  level  of  shipping  activity  under  the  cases  examined  is  summarized  in  Figure  A11. \nUnder  the  without-Project  case,  by  2030  outward  coastal  shipping  from  Lae  would  be  20%  of \nthe projected demand while inward coastal shipments to Lae would be about half the projected \ndemand. This would have the flow-on effect of reducing international shipping to less than 70% \nof projected demand by 2030. The Project is projected to delay the decline in coastal shipping \nand  lead  to  a  much  smaller  cutback  in  international  shipping  than  under  the  without-Project \ncase.  The  Project  and  Phase  II  of  the  tidal  basin  combined  are  almost  sufficient  to  meet  the \nprojected demand for international and coastal shipping until close to 2030. \n\nFigure A11.

The net present \n\n9. \nvalue (NPV) is K104 million and the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is 15.8%.  \n\n10. \nImportant  benefits  are  found  to  be  generated  by  the  Project  through  the  savings  in \ncongestion costs and the generation of income by a larger coastal shipping and port industry.4\nBut the key to the Project is the flow-on benefits realized from the additional international and \ncoastal  shipping  it  allows.  The  larger  capacity  at  Lae  port  is  estimated  to  provide  substantial \nproductivity  gains  for  smallholders  and  other  local  producers  by  allowing  them  to  engage  in \nhigher-value-added  activities,  notably  the  export  of  agricultural  products.  The  expanded  port \ncapacity is also important in minimizing costs in the economy by allowing the import of key items \nnot produced locally.  \n\n11. \nThe estimates of the benefits from the additional international and coastal shipping made \npossible  by  the  Project  are  considered  to  be  conservative.  This  is  because  the  assumed \nproductivity  effects  are  low  and  because  the  economic  evaluation  does  not  take  into  account \nbenefits to consumers (i.e., additional consumer surplus) provided by a higher level of imports. \nThe actual benefit from the Project could substantially exceed the estimates presented.  \n\n12. \nThe EIRR calculation was subjected to sensitivity analysis to test the effects of negative \nchanges  in  the  key  parameters  that  determine  the  benefits  and  costs  of  the  Project.  The \nsensitivity  analysis  found  that  the  Project  remained  economically  viable  in  the  face  of  a  10% \nincrease in costs or a 10% decrease in benefits or a 1-year extension in the construction period. \nIn what could be considered as the worst-case scenario\u2014a combination of increased costs and \ndecreased benefits\u2014the NPV would decrease from K104 million to K5 million, with EIRR going \nfrom 15.8% to 12.2%. The switching value for the Project for increased construction costs was \ndetermined  to  be  30%,  and  the  switching  value  for  decreased  benefits  was  determined  to  be \n24%.5\n\nThe  results  of  the  economic  assessment  and  sensitivity  analysis  of  the  Project  are \n\n13. \npresented in Tables A11.1 and A11.2.  \n\n                                                \n4  Congestion savings become \u201cnegative\u201d over time because, compared with the without-Project scenario, more ships \nand cargo will be handled in the with-Project scenario, leading to a total increase in waiting time and inventory cost \nat high rates of capacity usage.\n\n5  The switching value shows the percentage increase in a cost variable or decline in a benefit variable required for \n\nthe NPV to become zero, which is the same as the EIRR reducing to the cutoff level of 12%. \n\n\f52\n\nAppendix 11\n\nYear\n \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \n2018 \n2019 \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \n2025 \n2026 \n2027 \n2028 \n2029 \n2030 \nMemo items: \nNPV\n(K million) \nEIRR (%) \n\n0.0  \n0.0  \n0.0  \n41.9  \n40.6  \n38.6  \n36.7  \n34.0  \n31.3  \n27.2  \n23.4  \n17.7  \n14.3  \n(18.4) \n(23.7) \n(23.7) \n(23.7) \n(23.8) \n(23.8) \n(23.8) \n(23.5) \n(22.9) \n(22.2) \n\n104.7  \n\n \n\n0.0  \n0.0  \n0.0  \n8.8  \n6.5  \n6.1  \n4.2  \n4.3  \n2.8  \n3.5  \n2.4  \n3.8  \n5.4  \n7.4  \n3.8  \n3.8  \n3.8  \n(0.2) \n(1.4) \n(2.7) \n(3.7) \n(4.5) \n(5.3) \n\n22.9  \n\n \n\nTable A11.1: Economic Internal Rate of Return\n\nSavings in \nCongestion \nCosts \n\nSavings in \nLighterage and \nDiverted \nTransshipment \n\nAdditional \nShipping\nValue-\nAdded \n\nProductivity \nGain on \nExports \nfrom\nCoastal \nAreas \n\nProductivity \nGains on \nItems\nShipped to \nCoastal \nAreas \n\nTidal Basin \nConstruction \nand Operating \nCost\n\nK million (2007 prices) \n\n0.0  \n0.0  \n0.0  \n0.0  \n4.9  \n9.7  \n14.6  \n19.4  \n24.3  \n29.2  \n34.0  \n38.9  \n40.8  \n42.7  \n45.4  \n45.1  \n44.8  \n46.2  \n46.0  \n45.9  \n45.8  \n45.6  \n45.5  \n\n0.0  \n0.0  \n0.0  \n0.0  \n4.3  \n8.6  \n12.9  \n17.3  \n21.6  \n25.9  \n30.2  \n34.5  \n38.8  \n43.1  \n47.5  \n51.8  \n56.1  \n69.0  \n82.0  \n94.9  \n107.9  \n120.8  \n133.7  \n\n0.0  \n0.0  \n0.0  \n0.0  \n1.5  \n2.9  \n4.4  \n5.9  \n7.4  \n8.8  \n10.3  \n11.8  \n12.2  \n12.5  \n13.2  \n12.8  \n12.4  \n12.1  \n11.1  \n10.2  \n9.3  \n8.3  \n7.4  \n\n       (69.6) \n     (143.4) \n     (189.5) \n(1.4) \n(5.1) \n(5.2) \n(5.4) \n(5.7) \n(5.9) \n(6.0) \n(6.5) \n(6.6) \n(6.7) \n(7.1) \n(7.2) \n(7.3) \n(7.7) \n(7.8) \n(8.0) \n(8.4) \n(8.6) \n(8.7) \n(9.2) \n\nNet\nBenefit\n\n(69.6) \n(143.4) \n(189.5) \n49.2  \n52.6  \n60.8  \n67.5  \n75.2  \n81.4  \n88.6  \n93.9  \n100.0  \n104.7  \n80.3  \n79.0  \n82.5  \n85.7  \n95.5  \n105.9  \n116.1  \n127.1  \n138.6  \n149.9  \n\n( ) = negative, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n127.8  \n\n154.5  \n\n   35.8  \n\n (341.7) \n\n  103.9  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n15.8% \n\nTable A11.2: Sensitivity Analysis \n\n \nItem\n\n1.

A  tariff  analysis  was  also  performed  to  assess  the  impact  of  tariff \nadjustments on the financial position of the PNG Ports Corporation Limited (PPCL) as a whole. \nThe  tariff  analysis  evaluates  the  level  of  tariff  necessary  for  PPCL  to  maintain  an  appropriate \npretax return on equity (ROE) over the analysis period.  \n\n2. \nThe  Project\u2019s  costs  are  estimated  at  $154.0  million,  of  which  ADB  is  financing \n$100 million,  or  64.9%,  through  a  combination  of  ordinary  capital  resources  and  Asian \nDevelopment Fund loans. The remainder is being financed by the Government, the OPEC Fund \nfor  International  Development,  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR),  and  the  HIV/AIDS \nCooperation  Fund.  The  major  components  of  the  Project  are  the  preparation  and  dredging  of \nthe tidal basin, berth construction and paving, and environmental and resettlement costs.  \n\n3. \nThe  analysis  measures  the  revenue  generated  from  these  components  with  the  future \ncosts  of  operation  and  maintenance  and  debt  servicing  measured  by  financial  internal  rate  of \nreturn  (FIRR)  and  net  present  value  (NPV).  Assumptions  have  been  made  for  the  tidal  basin \nexpansion and related operations, leading to with- and without-Project analyses and streams of \nincremental  costs  and  revenues  over  a  23-year  period  starting  in  2008.  The  results  of  these \n\u201cbase-case  financial  projections\u201d  are  compared  with  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital \n(WACC)  for  the  Project  to  determine  financial  sustainability.  A  sensitivity  analysis  further \nassesses the impact of changes in cost and revenue assumptions on the base-case FIRR. \n\nB. \n\nMajor Assumptions \n\nCargo  Size  and  Traffic.  The  Project  will  generate  additional  revenues  from  the \n4.\nincreased  cargo  size  and  traffic  from  2012  (completion  of  construction)  to  2019  (the  point  at \nwhich  the  port  reaches  full  capacity).  The  traffic  forecast  for  Lae  port  has  been  forecast  for \n24 years, from 2007 to 2030. The average gross domestic product (GDP) elasticity of the cargo \nhandled at Lae port in 1967\u20132005 was 1.70. Since there is a strong correlation between cargo \nvolume and PNG\u2019s economic development, a major assumption made for the traffic forecast is \nGDP growth rate. For 2007\u20132011, it is assumed that the average GDP growth rate will be 4%, in \nline with the projections presented in the 2007 National Budget. After 2011, 3% average GDP \ngrowth rate is assumed.  \n\nTariffs:  Tariffs  for  essential  services  are  regulated  by  a  contract  between  PPCL  and \n5.\nIndependent  Consumer  and  Competition  Commission (ICCC)  for  31  July  2002--31  December \n2011. Essential services are defined in the contract as wharfage, berthing and berth reservation. \nThe  Contract  sets  out  the  maximum  tariffs  which  can  be  charged  for  these  services  and  the \nprocedures  for  preparing  the  follow-on  regulatory  contract.  The  regulated  tariff  is  based  on \napproved capital and operating costs and can be adjusted annually for changes in inflation, the \nexchange rate and other cost factors.1 The same tariffs must be charged at all ports.  \n\nRegulated  tariffs  for  wharfage  and  berthing  are  not  assumed  to  increase  until  the  tidal \n6. \nbasin  expansion  comes  online  in  2012.  This  coincides  with  the  renegotiation  of  the  contract \n\n                                                \n1   Additional  tariff  increases  of  16%  and  12%  were  provided  in  2003  and  2004  to  improve  the  financial  position  of \n\nPPCL and raise funds for PPCL\u2019s maintenance program. \n\n\f54\n\nAppendix 12\n\nbetween  PPCL  and  ICCC,  which  will  determine  new  regulated  tariffs  (i.e.,  for  wharfage  and \nberthing). Discussions with ICCC indicate a willingness to explore an increase in charges at Lae \nPort to compensate for the additional services and the cost of the tidal basin expansion. In the \nlight of past increases of 16% in 2003 and 12% in 2004, and the cost savings and expansion in \nbusiness opportunity offered to users by the upgrade of port facilities, a substantial increase is \nconsidered  reasonable.  Unregulated  charges  and  tariffs  are  likely  to  increase  more  slowly  but \nalso  more  often  (every  5 years)  as  PPCL  develops  a  more  commercial  attitude  toward  the \nexploitation of its assets. These charges and tariffs include storage tariffs, stevedoring license \nfees and pilotage charges, rental of offices and sheds, and charges on statutory authorities for \nthe  use  of  port  property.  The  port  also  earns  certain  other  operating  revenues  that  are \nindependent of traffic growth. The charging of port and cargo dues ended recently, following the \nrepeal of the bylaws authorizing their collection, so these dues are not included in the financial \nforecasts.\n\n7. \nAn analysis was made to evaluate the level of tariff necessary for PPCL to maintain an \naverage  15%  pretax  ROE,  at  the  company  level,  for  10  years  after  project  completion.  The \nanalysis  was  undertaken  for  Phase  I  of  the  Tidal  Basin  development,  which  excludes  $29.51 \nmillion dredging costs for Phase II.2 The 15% return is considered appropriate for the industry \nand region and is consistent with the equity risk\u2013weighted return factor used in the calculation of \nWACC.  Financial  statements,  including  project  costs,  were  projected  for  the  company  as  a \nwhole through 2021. According to this evaluation, a one-time composite tariff increase of 26.7% \napplicable  to  all  ports  in  2012  (35%  for  wharfage  and  berthage;  17.5%  for  all  other  services) \nprovides a 15.3% average ROE through 2021. The required 26.7% tariff increase is far below \nthe expectations of the shipping companies. \n\n8. \nAssuming the Project is built by IPBC and transferred to PPCL after completion, PPCL\u2019s \nfinancial statements have been projected from 2012 to 2021 on the basis of a composite tariff \nincrease of 26.7% (and additional financial assumptions listed below). Based on the projections, \nit  appears  that  PPCL  will  be  financially  healthy  and  generate  sufficient  cash  flow  to  repay  the \nProject loans (Table A12.1).      \n\n9. \nThis analysis is undertaken on the assumption that tariffs remain uniform across ports. \nThe major ports of Lae and Port Moresby currently cross-subsidize the smaller ports.3 A uniform \ntariff increase made to recover investment at Lae would reduce or perhaps remove the cross-\nsubsidy.  This  would  offer  efficiency  benefits  by  bringing  tariffs  more  into  line  with  the  cost  of \nservice  delivery.  However,  an  increase  in  tariffs  at  the  smaller  ports  may  be  undesirable  on \nsocial  grounds  as  the  smaller  ports  generally  service  less  developed  areas.  Furthermore,  a \nuniform  tariff  increase  may  create  a  cross-subsidy  in  favor  of  Lae  at  the  expense  of  Port \nMoresby.  This  would  be  undesirable  on  both  efficiency  and  equity  grounds.  These \nconsiderations suggest there are grounds for revising the regulatory regime and allowing a tariff \nincrease specific to Lae Port. \n\n                                                \n2 These dredging works are to be undertaken jointly with Phase I so as to facilitate port expansion in a cost effective \nmanner.  A  matching  revenue  flow  will  only  be  generated  when  additional  investment  is  made  in  wharfs,  loading \nequipment, storage areas etc under Phase II. It is preferable that tariffs are set at a level that recovers the dredging \ncosts when Phase II begins operation. \n\n3 Papua  New  Guinea  Independent  Consumer  and  Competition  Commission,  2007.

12\n\nAs  Lae  Port  accounts  for  approximately  half  of  PNG\u2019s  port  traffic,  a  Lae-specific  tariff \n10. \nincrease that is revenue-neutral would need to be the order of double the size of a uniform tariff \nincrease. A one time composite tariff increase of 57.3% (75.0% for wharfage and berthage and \n37.5%  for  all  other  services)  in  2012,  is  projected  to  provide  a  15%  average  ROE  at  the \ncompany level through 2021. As port charges are a relatively small share of total shipping costs, \nsuch  a  tariff  increase  has  a  small  impact  on  the  cost  of  shipping  to  and  from  Lae  Port.  It  is \nestimated that coastal shipping costs would rise by approximately 6.0% under the 57.3% tariff \nincrease,  while  international  shipping  costs  would  rise  by  approximately  3.5%.  This  is  a  gross \nincrease  and  excludes  the  savings  in  shipping  costs  that  the  Project  would  generate  through \nlower  congestion  costs  and  other  improvements  to  port  efficiency.  The  net  cost  increase  is \nconsidered  to  be  within  the  expectations  of  shipping  companies  and  manageable  by  the \neconomy given the additional trade made possible by the Project. \n\nProject  Costs.  Project  costs  are  estimated  at  $154.0  million.  However,  the  project \n11.\ndesign  includes  $29.51  million  additional  dredging  and  related  costs  to  accommodate  a  150 \nmeter berth extension and thus alleviate capacity constraints expected in 2018 from consistently \nincreasing traffic. While incurring these costs now is justified financially, they can be excluded \nfrom the financial analysis to evaluate the viability of the Project to support current demand. \n\nOperating  Costs.  All  costs  and  prices  are  expressed  in  2007  dollars.  The  major  cost \n\n12.\nassumptions are as follows: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nStaff  costs:  10%  increase  in  Lae  2006  staff  costs  of  K0.2  million  including \nbenefits.\nMaintenance: 0.5% x the civil works component of capital costs, consistent with \ninternational practice. \nUtilities: K0.30 per revenue ton in 2006. \nInsurance:  0.5%  x  asset  values  (replacement  cost).  This  is  very  close  to  the \npremium rate charged on PPCL\u2019s existing assets and is in line with international \npractice.\n\n13. \nA  comparison  of  the  total  costs  and  benefits  included  in  the  financial  analysis  of  the \nProject are summarized in the Table A12.2. These projections have been prepared on the basis \nof a composite tariff increase of 57.3% for Lae Port only. \n\nC. \n\nWeighted Average Cost of Capital and Financial Projections \n\n14. \nFor the purposes of the financial analysis, the calculation of the pretax WACC is based \non the amount of financing from the various sources. The contributions of JFPR, the HIV/AIDS \nCooperation Fund, and the Government are designated as equity. The cost of debt reflects the \ncost  of  the  funding  sources.  The  opportunity  cost  of  equity  has  been  estimated  at  15%.  A \nlong-term  international  inflation  rate  of  0.8%  and  a  long-term  domestic  inflation  rate  of  3.1% \nhave been assumed.

The  specific  needs  of  the  port \nextension (next to the existing port and with access to the ocean) make it impossible to avoid \nphysical and economic displacement. The project requires 120 hectares of government-owned \nmarshland and entails the physical relocation of three villages (Maus Markham, Wara Tais, and \nSodas)  with  2,912  people  from  482  households.  The  re-settlers  are  from  various  provinces  of \nPapua New Guinea (PNG) and have been living in the area since the 1980s despite the fact that \nthis land has been gazetted as government land and earmarked for the extension of the port for \ndecades.  Due  diligence  has  been  carried  out  and  all  stakeholders  agree  that  this  is  officially \ngovernmental land. Nevertheless, various ethnic groups claim ownership over this land, as land \nis  considered  by  most  people  in  PNG  to  be  a  non-commodity.  The  failure  to  achieve  mutual \nagreements with all groups involved has resulted in significant resistance and the cancellation of \nearlier  attempts  to  implement  this  project  (Loans.  0468-PNG  and  0469-PNG  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank [ADB] approved on 25 September 1980) after detailed design, mobilization, \nand clearing of the project site. \n\nBesides the 2,912 people who need to be physically relocated, three villages (Labu Butu, \n2. \nLabu  Miti,  and  Labu  Tale\u2014hereinafter  \u201cLabu  villages\u201d)  will  lose  their  only  all-weather  canoe\nlanding  site  and  an  associated  market  because  of  the  Project,  stricter  implementation  of  the \nInternational  Shipping  and  Port  Security  Code,  and  increased  traffic  in  fishing  grounds  in  the \nLae bay port area. \n\n3. \nThe resettlement site at Malahang will be leased from the BUP Development Co., which \nwas created by the BUP Association to handle landholdings of the Busulum, Uapu, and Pualu \nethnic  groups.  The  site  is  now  used  as  farmland  by  these  groups  and  inhabited  by  some \nsettlers.  The  BUP  Association  has  committed  itself  to  avoiding  the  displacement  of  these \nsettlers by  offering  them  the  opportunity  to  lease  at  an  affordable  rate  the  lands  they  are  now \noccupying without title.\n\nThis resettlement plan (hereinafter \u201cRP\u201d) was prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy\n4. \non  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995),  the  Operations  Manual  section  2  on  Involuntary \nResettlement (2006), and the Handbook on Resettlement (1998). This RP defines entitlements, \nproject  interventions,  and  implementation  arrangements  on  the  basis  of  a  comprehensive \nsocioeconomic survey. It was endorsed by the Independent Public Business Corporation (IPBC) \nand  the  Morobe  Provincial  Government  on  20 September  2007.  Intensive  and  comprehensive \nconsultations  with  all  stakeholders  (the  three  resettlement  villages,  the  Labu  villages,  and  the \nhost communities) have been carried out in a gender-sensitive manner. Key information related \nto the RP, including measurement of losses, detailed asset valuations, entitlements and special \nprovisions,  grievance  procedures,  timing  of  payments,  and  displacement  schedule,  was \ndisclosed  to  the  affected  people  in  September  2007  and  the  RP  was  disclosed  locally  at  the \nlocal councils and to the public through the ADB website. \n\n5. \nEach of the eligible 482 households (identified in a participatory process and through a \ndetailed  socioeconomic  survey)  is  entitled  to  a  one-bedroom  house  at  the  resettlement  site, \n700 square meters of land, a water storage tank, and a pit toilet. The land will be leased out to \nthe  re-settlers  (482  households)  at  a  rate  affordable  to  all  (K100  =  $30  per  year),  while  the \nhouses  and  the  other  infrastructure  will  become  their  property.  The  re-settlers  will  be  also \n\n\fassisted  in  transporting  their  salvageable  assets  to  their  new  homes  and  in  extending  their \nhomes  with  these  materials.  Vulnerable  individuals  have  been  identified  and  they  will  be \nassisted in the resettlement process to ensure that their living conditions are enhanced. \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n59\n\nTable A13.1: Resettlement Impact \n\nAssets Lost \nLands\n\nMaus Markham  Wara Tais \n\u00b1 120 ha (no titles that are legal or can be legalized)\n\nSodas \n\nHouses\nKitchens\nSheds\nToilets\nShops\nCanteens/Coffee shops\nEconomic trees\nGardens/Farms\nAccess to fishing grounds\nCommunal properties\nCultural/Ritual sites\nInformal markets\nCanoe landing areas\nFormal jobs\nSelf-employment\nJobs in the Informal sector  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n221\n84\n23\n216\n5\n8\n(cid:57)\n(cid:57)\n(cid:57)\n3 churches\nNone\n(cid:57)\n(cid:57)\nNone\nNone\nSome\n\n \n\n97 \n\n28\n1\n55\n2\n4\n(cid:57)\n(cid:57)\n(cid:57)\nNone\nNone\n(cid:57)\n(cid:57)\nNone\nNone\nSome\n\n164\n4\n12\n125\n7\n17\n(cid:57)\n(cid:57)\n(cid:57)\n2 churches\nNone\n(cid:57)\n(cid:57)\nNone\nNone\nSome\n\nLabu \nVillages \nNone\n\nNone\nNone\nNone\nNone\nNone\nNone\nNone\nNone\n(cid:57)\nNone\nNone\n(cid:57)\n(cid:57)\nNone\nNone\nNone\n\nHosts \n+40\nha\nNone\nNone\nNone\nNone\nNone\nNone\n(cid:57)\n(cid:57)\nNone\nNone\nNone\nNone\nNone\nNone\nNone\nNone\n\nThe  package  offered  to  the  re-settlers  ensures  compensation  at  replacement  costs  for \n6. \nall,  and  is  for  most  a  significant  enhancement  of  living  conditions.  The  asset  valuation  carried \nout in a participatory manner disclosed that 50% of the people live in houses with a value of less \nthan  K5,000  and  only  19%  have  assets  with  a  replacement  value  of  more  than  K10,000.  The \nvalue of the resettlement package is K25,000 (around $7,000). Six households have assets that \nexceed  the  value  of  the  compensation  package.  It  is  assumed  that  they  are  able  to  maintain \nsalvageable  assets  with  a  value  that  exceeds  the  difference  (K2,000\u2013K5,000).  \u201cBetter-off\u201d \nhouseholds with secure employment will also be invited to join a subsidized credit scheme that \nwill  enable  them  to  build  a  larger  house  at  the  resettlement  site.  This  scheme  will  be  closely \nmonitored to ensure that the better-off households are not worse off after the resettlement.  \n\n7. \nThe re-settlers are also entitled to relocation assistance for all affected livelihood assets \n(shops, shades, poultry, etc.). They will be compensated for the loss of trees and garden crops \nwith  seedlings  having  a  value  equal  to  the  replacement  costs,  and  assisted  in  planting  the \nseedlings in a professional manner to ensure long-term and maximized benefits. \n\nThe re-settlers and other affected people (including landowners) will receive preferential \n8. \naccess  to  employment  in  the  construction  of  the  resettlement  site  as  well  as  the  tidal  basin. \nDuring  the  physical  relocation,  experienced  governmental  services  and  nongovernment \norganizations  (NGOs)  will  help  the  re-settlers  dismantle  the  old  houses  and  other  structures, \nmove their salvageable assets to the resettlement site, and establish new structures with these \nmaterials.  They  will  also  provide  special  assistance  to  vulnerable  populations  (elders, \nhandicapped,  single-headed  households,  etc.).  The  re-settlers  will  receive  a  lump  sum  cash \ncompensation (K500, equivalent to the average urban income for 1 month) to cover additional \ncosts during the relocation (food, additional transport, new materials, etc.).  \n\n\f60\n\nAppendix 13\n\nAfter  the  relocation,  the  affected  people  will  receive  assistance  through  agricultural \n9. \nextension agencies and NGOs to improve or at least restore their livelihood. At present, a large \nnumber  of  people  obtain  their  livelihood  from  informal  activities,  some  of  which  are  closely \nassociated with ease of access to the port (sex workers, sale of narcotics, buying and selling of \nproducts  found  at  the  port,  etc.).  The  relocation  will  affect  these  activities,  while  all  other \nactivities  can  be  continued  at  the  new  site:  products  can  be  sold  on  markets  close  to  the \nresettlement site, which will be enhanced to host the re-settlers. Skills training and short courses \nin  the  home  processing  of  food  products  (chips,  jam,  dried  fruits,  snacks,  fruit  juices,  cookies, \netc.),  vocational  training,  and  technical  school  training  will  be  offered  to  make  the  re-settlers \nmore employable and lay the groundwork for sustainable and legal income-generating activities. \nAgricultural extension and training will be offered in animal husbandry (chickens, ducks, rabbits, \nfish,  pigs,  etc.)  in  backyard  enclosures  and  the  cultivation  of  vegetables  in  gardens  and  a \nsubsidized  micro-credit  program  will  be  made  available  to  better-off  households.  While  the \ndistance to the markets at the new site is equal or shorter, the ocean is farther away (4 km) and \nthe distance will affect the fisherfolk. But as most people are not from the coastal areas and the \nfishing  grounds  are  owned  by  the  indigenous  peoples  of  that  area,  the  number  of  households \nthat  indicated  fishing  as  their  source  of  livelihood  is  very  low  (less  than  5%).  The  livelihood \nimpact  will  be  closely  monitored  by  an  independent  monitoring  agency  against  the  detailed \nsocioeconomic  survey  baseline  data  and  additional  measures  elaborated  in  a  participatory \nmanner to address outstanding social issues if the need arises. \n\n10. \nAffected communal infrastructures (five churches) will be rebuilt at the resettlement site \nor  existing  infrastructure  in  the  host  villages  enhanced,  if  this  is  the  preferred  option  of  a \ncongregation. To accommodate the 2,912 re-settlers a health center will be extended in line with \nnational  standards.  The  Bowali  elementary  and  primary  schools  and  the  Malahang  technical \nschool  will  be  provided  with  additional  classrooms  and  additional  teacher  housing  to  host  the \n473 pupils from the resettlement site. As a large number of children do not go to school because \ntheir parents are unable or unwilling to pay the school fees, the Project will raise awareness of \nthe benefits of education and assist in increasing the educational level of the affected people. \nAdditional communal infrastructure (a sport facility and community centers) will be put in place \nin  line  with  national  standards.  Access  to  the  urban  water  and  electricity  grid  is  available,  but \nwhether or not to connect their houses to these grids remains the decision and responsibility of \nthe individual households.  \n\n11. \nThe  Project  will  further  need  to  acquire  an  all-weather  canoe  landing  site,  which  is  the \nmain access \u201croad\u201d for three Labu villages, and an associated fish market. To enable the Labu \nvillages  to  land  their  canoes  in  the  future,  the  existing  good-weather  landing  site  at  SP  beach \nwill be enhanced with a breakwater structure to facilitate landing under all-weather conditions, \nand the existing fish market will be enhanced with permanent shades to replace the market lost \nat  the  old  site.  The  Labu  villages  will  also  receive  training  and  support  in  establishing  floating \nfish  cages  in  the  Labu  lagoons  and  in  carrying  out  fish  farming  and  other  non-fishing-based \nincome-generating activities to offset any income loss related to the extension of the port. \n\n12. \nExtensive consultation and participation was undertaken during the resettlement planning \nand  preparation  phase,  with  the  Morobe  Provincial  Administration,  the  provincial  resettlement \ncommittee, the community resettlement committees, the BUP Association, the Labu Association, \nNGOs  (Adventist  Development  Relief  Agency,  Habitat  for  Humanity,  Catholic  Women\u2019s \nAssociation,  Catholic  Youth  Development  Center,  Lutheran  Church,  Young  Women\u2019s  Christian \nAssociation,  etc.),  and  other  institutions  (e.g.,  the  National  Agricultural  Research  Institute,  the \nUniversity  of  Technology).  Public  participation  and  consultation  will  continue  throughout \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n61\n\nresettlement  plan  implementation  as  well  as  during  the  evaluation,  and  stakeholders  will  be \nempowered and enabled to participate actively in the process. \n\n13. \nThe implementation of this resettlement plan and all its components will be coordinated by \nthe resettlement office of the project management unit and closely supervised by the resettlement \ncommittee,  which  comprises  IPBC,  PNG  Port  Corporation  Limited  (PPCL),  and  the  Morobe \nProvincial  Administration.  To  enable  the  resettlement  office  to  carry  out  this  work,  training  and \nbackstopping will be provided. Infrastructure will be established by construction companies under \nthe technical supervision of qualified management companies, while land development (clearing, \nroad construction, and laying of connections to water and electricity grids) will be done by the BUP \nDevelopment Co. under the supervision of the provincial public works department. The relocation \nplanning  and  assistance  during  relocation  will  be  facilitated  by  the  resettlement  office  and  the \nprovincial  administration.  NGOs  and  specialist  governmental  bodies  will  also  assist  vulnerable \npopulations  during  and  after  the  relocation  and  implement  livelihood  restoration  activities,  while \nexternal  monitoring  will  be  carried  out  by  an  independent  and  experienced  monitoring  agency. \nThe  experienced  and  well-established  provincial  ombudsman,  an  office  established  to  settle \ndisputes  between  ethnic  groups  and  the  State,  will  serve  as  grievance  redress  mechanism  to \nallow  affected  people  to  appeal  decisions  and  actions,  and  to  obtain  resolution  in  case  these \ngrievances are found to be justified. \n\n The satisfactory completion of the relocation process for the three settlements will need \n14. \nto be documented in an external monitoring and evaluation report and evaluated by ADB before \nthe Government and ADB approves the award of civil works contracts for the new port facilities. \n\nThe  total  costs  of  compensation,  relocation,  livelihood  restoration,  and  internal  and \n15. \nexternal monitoring, including contingencies, are estimated at $6.7 million. They will be financed \nby  the  Government  (counterpart  funds),  ADB  ADF  loan,  and  a  grant  from  the  Japan  Fund  for \nPoverty Reduction (financing livelihood restoration and external monitoring).   \n\nTable A13.2: Estimated Costs of the Resettlement Plan \n($ million) \n\nItem\nResettlement site purchase from BUP Development Co.\nHousing:  Construction  of  482  1-bedroom

\n\n63\n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nA. \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\nIs  the  sector  identified  as  a  national \npriority  in  country  poverty  partnership \nagreement?   \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Papua New Guinea \n\nThe  rehabilitation  and  maintenance  of  transport  and  marine  infrastructure  is  identified  in  the  Medium  Term \nDevelopment Strategy (MTDS) 2005\u20132010 as a strategic priority to promote export-driven economic growth and rural \ndevelopment (including agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and tourism). The Government\u2019s commitment to spearhead the \ndevelopment of Papua New Guinea (PNG) through the improvement of physical infrastructure is reiterated in the draft \nNational  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy,  and  consistently  reflected  in  the  National  Transport  Development  Plan  (2006\u2013\n2010), and the Five-Year Development Plan (2003\u20132007) of the Morobe Provincial Administration. The provincial plan \nidentifies  the  need  to  improve  and  maintain  physical  infrastructure  and  communication  network,  to  facilitate  and \naccelerate mobility and goods and service delivery, and encourage income-earning opportunities in the rural area. The \n\u201cnational corridor,\u201d which connects Lae port with its hinterland, carries the greatest volume of freight, and serves about \n40% of the country\u2019s population. The Lae Port Rehabilitation Project will contribute to supporting economic growth and \ndevelopment  in  Morobe  province,  with  extended  benefits  to  the  five  Highlands  and  Madang  provinces,  by \nstrengthening the port\u2019s ability to meet the increased demand from overseas ships and its role as transshipment port \nfor freight arriving on overseas ships bound for Alotau, Buka, Kiavieng Lihir, Madang, and Rabaul. The upgraded port \nfacilities will allow faster and cheaper access to minerals, oil, gas, coffee, spices, fresh vegetables, and cattle from the \nHighlands as well as imports of capital goods and consumables from abroad. \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis  \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention\n\nIn  2005,  PNG  had  an  estimated  population  of  about  5.9  million  with  about  85%  of  the  people  living  in  rural  areas. \nAccording  to  the  2000  census,  with  population  growing  at  a  steady  annual  rate  of  2.7%  from  1980  to  2000,  PNG\u2019s \npopulation  doubled  in  the  30  years  since  independence.  Despite  its  proclaimed  potential,  PNG  faces  many \nimpediments  to  socioeconomic  growth.  Key  factors  affecting  PNG\u2019s  development  outlook\u2014which  fully  reflect  the \nconditions  in  the  project  area\u2014include:  a  highly  diverse  and  complex  clan-  and  tribe-based  social  structure,  widely \nscattered  and  often  isolated  rural  communities,  weak  governance,  a  limited  human  capital  base,  and  serious \nlaw-and-order problems. The country\u2019s fast-growing population is adding significantly to the decline in living standards \nand the burden of delivering essential social and support services. Poverty estimates have not been updated since the \nlast  household  survey  in  1996.  From  1996  to  2003,  the  number  of  Papua  New  Guineans  living  below  $1/day  is \nestimated to have doubled, from 1.1 million to 2.2 million people. The poverty headcount index, for the $1/day poverty \nline, was about 39.4% in 2003, up from 24.6% in 1996. An estimated 70% of the population, or 3.9 million Papua New \nGuineans, now live on less than $2/day, up from 54% in 1996. \n\nAccording to the UNDP Human Development Index (HDI), PNG has improved since the mid-1970s, but very slowly. In \n2006,  PNG  ranked  139th  among  177  developing  countries,  reflecting  alarming  economic  and  social  intra-country \ndisparities. On the UNDP Human Poverty Index (HPI), PNG ranks 75th among 102 developing countries. PNG\u2019s main \nsocial indicators, such as life expectancy and maternal and child mortality rates, show improvements since 1975, but \nare still well below the averages for lower-middle-income countries (LMICs). PNG still has limited primary health care. \nInfectious diseases are claiming many lives, and there are serious public health risks from endemic diseases such as \nmalaria.  A  general  HIV  epidemic  is  under  way,  with  prevalence  rates  among  15-  to  49-year-olds  at  3\u20134%  in  Port \nMoresby,  well  over  2%  in  other  urban  areas,  and  over  1%  in  rural  areas.  In  education,  the  rate  of  participation  in \nprimary schooling is improving, but it remains lower than in most other countries in the region. \n\nIn  Morobe  province,  as  a  result  of  poor  rural  infrastructure,  people  in  rural  areas  are  pulled  by  migratory  factors  to \nurban areas to seek better services and income-earning opportunities. In the rural areas, poor rural infrastructure is a \nmarket  disincentive.  In  urban  areas,  lack  of  appropriate  skills  and  employment  opportunities  forces  people  into  the \ninformal  sector.  In  addressing  the  issue  of  poverty  and  lack  of  basic  infrastructure,  the  Morobe  Provincial  Strategic \nDevelopment  Plan  (2003\u20132007)  identified  the  following  contributing  factors  to  ever-increasing  levels  of  poverty: \n(i) inaccessibility  of  basic  services,  (ii)  increasing  number  of  in-migrants  from  other  provinces,  (iii)  lack  of \n\n\f64\n\nAppendix 14\n\nincome-earning opportunities, (iv) increasing rate of unemployment, and (v) increasing number of unskilled labor.\n\nC.  Participation Process \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis?\n\n   Yes \n\n   No\n\nExtensive  consultations  were  carried  out  during  the  PPTA  and  loan  fact-finding  missions  in  Port  Moresby  and  Lae. \nThese  involved  a  broad  range  of  stakeholders,  which  include:  government  agencies  (the  Morobe  Provincial \nAdministration [MPA], Lae district administration [LDA], the National Council of Women, the Morobe Provincial Council \nof  Women,  the  National  AIDS  Council,  the  Morobe  Provincial  AIDS  Council);  civil  society  representatives  (including \nnongovernment  organizations  [NGOs],  community-based  organizations,  and  faith-based  organizations);  business \ncommunity  representatives  (Lae  Chamber  of  Commerce,  port  authorities,  users,  and  operators);  and  Labu  and  Ahi \npeople.  Field  surveys,  focus  group  discussions  and  key-informant  interviews  have  been  organized  in  the  form  of \n(i) written information disclosure on resettlement and environmental issues (information leaflets); (ii) larger stakeholder \nmeetings  (information  dissemination  with  representatives  of  affected  communities  before  the  census  and  survey); \n(iii) key-informant meetings at provincial (MPA), district (LDA), port (PMU/IPBC), and settlement level; (iv) focus group \ndiscussions  (e.g.,  Lae  Chamber  of  Commerce  and  Industry,  the  Adventist  Development  Relief  Agency,  the  National \nAgricultural  Research  Institute,  Soroptimist  International,  Young  Women\u2019s  Christian  Association,  Save  the  Children, \nand  the  Lae  Police  Department);  and  (v)  a  full  household  census  and  market  and  trade  survey  among  local \nhouseholds,  traders,  passengers,  and  shop  owners  in  the  three  affected  settlements.  Relevant  information  from  the \nstakeholder analysis has informed the design of the loan components and formed the rationale for the special features \nunder the loan, which include: mobilizing the private sector to respond to gender and HIV/AIDS issues, with funding \nfrom the Swedish Cooperation Fund, and promoting livelihood rehabilitation and enhancement activities in the project \narea, with funding from JFPR. \n\nIs there a participation strategy?\n\n   Yes \n\n   No \n\nThe  project  processing  and  preparation  of  the  resettlement  plan  and  environment  impact  assessment  are  highly \nconsultative  and  participatory.  The  process  of  consultation  and  participation  is  continuing  daily  and  will  continue \nthroughout  the  project  cycle.  This  is  guaranteed  by  the  institutionalization  of  the  process.  IPBC  has  assigned  a \nfull-time  staff  as  the  resettlement  officer  to  dialogue  with  various  groups.  The  Ahi  and  the  Labu  have  formed  a  joint \ncommittee,  the  Bulo  Committee.  Resettlement  committees  at  the  communal  and  provincial  levels  have  been \nestablished to serve as mechanisms for addressing grievances and resolving disputes.  \n\nD.  Gender Development \n\nStrategy for maximizing impact on women: \n\nIn  the  light  of  women\u2019s  greater  vulnerability  to  the  risks  and  impact  of  infrastructure  development  and  the  need  to \nstrengthen their ability to avail themselves of the opportunities derived from increased connectivity and transportation, \nthe Project will: \n(cid:120) Mitigate  the  inherent  risks  involved  with  increased  road/port  traffic  and  connectivity,  by  promoting  greater \npartnership among the private sector, civil society NGOs, and the Morobe Provincial AIDS Council. The activities, \nto  be  funded  by  the  Swedish  Cooperation  Fund,  will  involve:  gender-responsive  AIDS  behavior  change  and \nawareness campaigns as well as capacity development initiatives aimed at strengthening the outreach and impact \nof NGOs working with most-at-risk groups in the working area. AIDS site committees and women\u2019s help desks at \npolice stations will be established in hot spots around the port. Effective modalities for the sustainable reintegration \nand  rehabilitation  of  People  Living  with  HIV/AIDS  (PLWHA),  including  AIDS  orphans  and  at-risk  groups  (e.g., \nfemale sex  workers, destitute single mothers, and female  heads of households)  will be pilot-tested in  the project \narea.\n\n(cid:120) Restore  and  enhance  livelihood  opportunities  of  affected  communities.  The  design  of  the  JFPR-funded  activities \nwill  take  into  consideration  the  specific  needs  and  constraints  faced  by  women  in  the  affected  communities  in \nterms of their ability to restore or enhance their income, and fully avail themselves of the opportunities provided by \nthe increased seaport and related road traffic and connectivity. \n\nThe  economic,  health,  and  social/gender  impact  of  the  loan  will  be  monitored  through  the  project  performance \nmonitoring  system  (PPMS)  and  consistently  reflected  in  the  project  progress  reports. All  data  collected  during  the \nProject will be sex-disaggregated.\n\nHas an output been prepared? \n\nYes\n\nNo\n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n65\n\nE.

Modalities  for  ensuring \nwomen\u2019s  equal  access  to  the  business  and  employment \nopportunities  provided  during  and  after  the  port  facilities \nhave been developed. \n\nPNG  population  consists  of  more  than  800  indigenous \npeople\u2019s  groups,  and  there  is  no  particular  dominant \ngroup. The directly affected people are illegal settlers from \nother parts of PNG. Their needs  will be addressed under \nthe resettlement plan. \n\nin  rural  areas. \n\nPNG  is  characterized  by  an  HIV  generalized  epidemic, \nwith prevalence rates among 15- to 49-year-olds at 3\u20134% \nin  Port  Moresby,  well  over  2%  in  other  urban  areas,  and \nover  1% \nIn  Morobe  province,  HIV \nprevalence is on the rise, with 600 officially registered HIV \ncases  (and  an  estimated  60%  unreported  cases),  2.5% \nHIV prevalence among women attending antenatal clinics, \nand  four  new  HIV  cases  reported  weekly  at  Angau \nMemorial  Provincial  Hospital  in  Lae.  In  this  context,  the \nanticipated  increase  in  sea  and  road  traffic  associated \nwith  the  rehabilitation  of  Lae  port  presents  critical  health \nand  social/gender  risks,  which  have  been  addressed  in \nthe loan design and implementation arrangements. \n\nHDI = Human Development Index, HPI = Human Poverty Index, Lae district administration = LDA, LMIC = lower-middle-\nincome countries, MTDS = Medium Term Development Strategy, NGO = nongovernment organization, PLWHA = People \nLiving  with  HIV/AIDS,  PNG  =  Papua  New  Guinea,  PPMS  =  project  performance  monitoring  system,  PPTA  =  project \npreparatory technical assistance.\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS\n(as of 31 October 2007) \n", "Currency Unit \n", "kina (K) \n", "\u2013 \n", "= \n= \n", "K1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "$0.357 \nK2.797 \n", " \n \n", " \n \n", "ABBREVIATIONS\n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "ADB \nADF \nAusAID \nCSP \nEA \nEIRR \nEMP \nFIRR \nGDP \nHIV/AIDS \n", "ICCC \nIPBC \nJFPR \nLDA \nLIBOR \nMPA \nMPG \nMTDS \nNGO \nNPV \nNTDP \nOCR \nOFID \nPMU \nPNG \nPNGHL \nPPCL \nPPTA \nPSC \nROE \nSOE \nTA \nTEU \nWACC \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nAsian Development Fund \nAustralian Agency for International Development \ncountry strategy and program \nexecuting agency \neconomic internal rate of return \nenvironmental management plan \nfinancial internal rate of return \ngross domestic product \nhuman immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency \nsyndrome\nIndependent Consumer and Competition Commission \nIndependent Public Business Corporation \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction \nLae district administration \nLondon interbank offered rate \nMorobe Provincial Administration \nMorobe Provincial Government \nMedium Term Development Strategy \nnongovernment organization \nnet present value \nNational Transport Development Plan \nordinary capital resources \nOPEC Fund for International Development \nproject management unit \nPapua New Guinea \nPNG Harbours Limited \nPNG Ports Corporation Limited \nproject preparatory technical assistance  \nproject steering committee \nreturn on equity \nstate-owned enterprise \ntechnical assistance \ntwenty-foot equivalent units \nweighted average cost of capital \n", "NOTES\n", "(i) \n", "(ii) \n", "The  fiscal  year  (FY)  of  the  Government  ends  on  31  December.  \u201cFY\u201d  before  a \ncalendar year denotes the year in which the fiscal year ends, e.g., FY2007 ends \non 31 December 2007. \nIn this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to US dollars. \n", "Vice President \nDirector General \nDirector\n", "C.
