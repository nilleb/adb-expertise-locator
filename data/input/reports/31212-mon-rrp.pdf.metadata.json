A technical assistance (TA)\ngrant  of  $695,000  equivalent  will  be  provided  upon  approval  of\nthe ASDP.\n\nAlthough  the  agriculture  sector,  in  particular  the  extensive\nlivestock  subsector,  has  been  the  mainstay  of  the  Mongolian\npopulation  during  the  recent  difficult  years  of  the  economic\ntransformation,  a  number  of  factors  continue  to  undermine  its\nperformance.  This  is  despite  the  adoption  of  major  market\nincluding  privatization,  deregulation  of  prices  of\nreforms \nagricultural  products,  and  liberalization  of  agricultural  trade,\nwhich  were  supported  by  the  ADB-financed  Agriculture  Sector\nProgram  implemented  during  1995-1998.  Many  of  the  new\nowners in the agriculture sector have little knowledge on how to\nmanage their assets in a market economy. The supply of critical\nsupport  services,  previously  organized  and  controlled  by  the\nstate,  has  deteriorated  and  left  a  vacuum  that  has  not  yet  been\nadequately  filled  by  the  private  sector.  The  financial  sector\ncontinues  to  be  restructured,  but  so  far  is  providing  very  little\nlending  in  rural  areas.  Due  to  the  limited  availability  of  support\nservices and other inputs, agricultural productivity is very low. In\nthe  livestock  subsector,  the  problem  is  intensified  by  the\novergrazing  of  many  pastures  as  a  result  of  the  substantial\nlarge  number  of\nincrease \ninoperative stock-watering wells.\n\nthe  national  herd,  and \n\nthe \n\nin \n\nClosely  related  to  the  problem  of  low  productivity  is  the  lack  of\nmarketing channels needed to increase incentives for agricultural\nactivity.  The  restructuring  of  marketing  and  the  privatization  of\nprocessing  enterprises  proceeded  much  slower  than  that  of\nlivestock  collectives  and  state  farms.  With  the  collapse  of\ntraditional  export  markets  and  the  reduction  of  subsidies,  many\nagricultural  processing  plants  have  been  closed,  and  the\nremaining  are  operating  with  low  capacity.  The  entry  of  private\ntrading and processing enterprises has been slow due to the lack\nof  investment  and  working  capital.  Partly  because  of  market\nlogistics  and  low  monetization  in  rural  areas,  subsistence\nproduction  and  barter  transaction  are  common.  Due  to  poor\ncommunication channels, many agricultural producers have little\naccess to market and other information. The cooperative system,\nwhich offers the most promising avenue for the provision\nof marketing and other services in rural areas as well as for the\n\n\fiii\n\ndelivery  of  local  public  goods  and  collective  income-earning\nactivities, requires support to fulfill its potential institutional role.\n\nThe  ASDP  will  address  these  two  main  problem  areas,  i.e.  low\nproductivity  and  limited  marketing  channels,  and  the  resulting\nconstraints on income-earning opportunities in rural areas. It will\ncomprise a policy loan for deepening and refining the policy and\nlegal framework for agriculture, and an investment loan providing\nsupport services for production and marketing, as well as credit.\n\nPrimary : Economic growth\nSecondary: Poverty reduction\n\nCategory B.\nEnvironmental implications of the policy and institutional reforms\nwere  reviewed,  and  environmental  interventions  have  been\nincorporated,  as  required.  An  initial  environmental  examination\nfor  the  components  under  the  investment  loan  was  undertaken,\nand no significant negative effects were identified.\n\nThe sector goals are to develop a more market-oriented, efficient\nand  sustainable  agriculture  sector  and  reduce  poverty  by\nproviding  increased  income  opportunities.  The  specific  purpose\nincrease  productivity  and  profitability  of  agricultural\nis \nto \nproducers.\n\nThe  ASDP  will \nindirect  poverty\ninclude  both  direct  and \ninterventions. Poor people are expected to comprise at least one\nthird  of  the  beneficiaries.  The  emphasis  on  poverty  reduction  is\nin line with the country operational strategy for Mongolia and the\nPartnership Agreement with the Asian Development Bank (ADB),\nand with the Government's Action Plan.\n\nThe  ASDP  will  consist  of  a  policy  program  with  seven  policy\nareas,  and  an  investment  Project  with  three  components.\nAssociated  with  the  ASDP  will  be  advisory  TA  for  Capacity\nBuilding in Agriculture.\n\nframework \n\nthe  broad \n\nThe  ASDP  is  designed  as  a  follow-up  to  the  Agriculture  Sector\nProgram.  With \nfor  market-based\ndevelopment  of  agriculture  in  place,  the  ASDP  policy  program\nwill  support  second  generation  reforms  to  deepen,  refine,  and\nmore  extensively  implement  the  policy  and  legal  framework  for\nagriculture.  The  emphasis  is  on  focusing  the  Government's  role\non providing essential support services, and creating a favorable\nenvironment  for  the  private  sector  to  more  effectively  undertake\nfunctions that during the pretransition period were carried out  by   \n\nClassification\n\nEnvironmental\nAssessment\n\nThe Sector Development Program\n\nObjectives\nand Scope\n\nPolicy Framework\nand Actions\n\n\fCapacity Building\n\nCapacity building is included in each of  the  components  of  the\ninvestment Project.\n\nThe Investment\nProject\n\niv\n\nthe  state,  such  as  the  supply  of  inputs,  the  processing  and\nmarketing of outputs, and the provision of financial services.\n\nThe  policy  program  focuses  on  providing  support  to  (i)  reduce\nprice  and  other  distortions  to  improve  resource  allocation  and\nefficiency  in  the  agriculture  sector;  (ii)  promote  competitive\nmarkets  for  agricultural  inputs,  outputs,  and  processed  goods;\n(iii)  ensure  the  delivery  of  financial  services  and  provide\nimproved access to credit for the rural population; (iv) rationalize\ntax  incentives  to  promote  investment  in  rural  areas;  (v)  improve\nproductivity  and  sustainability  in  extensive  livestock  production;\n(vi)  strengthen  agricultural  research  and  extension  to  support\nprivate  sector  agriculture;  and  (vii)  mitigate  risks  in  agriculture\nand ensure food security, income and employment for vulnerable\ngroups.\n\nLinked closely to the policy program, the investment Project will\nfocus  on  delivering  an  integrated  package  of  critical  support\nservices  to  help  increase  income  by  improving  productivity  and\nprofitability  in  the  crop  and  livestock  subsectors.  The  project\ndesign  has  also  been  guided  by  the  need  for  medium-  to  long-\nterm measures to help reduce the vulnerability of the agriculture\nsector to natural disasters.\n\nThe Project has three components with several subcomponents.\nThe  production  and  marketing  support  component  includes\nassistance  for  (i)  expanding  small-scale  horticulture  production\namong vulnerable groups under the Green Revolution Program;\n(ii)  strengthening  veterinary  services;  (iii)  rehabilitating  wells  in\npasture areas; (iv) developing the cooperative system to provide\nbetter  marketing  and  processing  services \nto  agricultural\nproducers; and (v) improving rural communication links, including\ntelephone  and  radio  services.  The  credit  component  comprises\nsupport  for  (i)  a  credit  line  for  participating  financial  institutions\n(PFIs)  to  increase  the  availability  of  credit  for  agricultural\npurposes,  and  (ii)  capacity  building  for  PFI  staff  and  advice  to\npotential  subborrowers.  The  project  management  component\nthe  efficient  management  of  project\nincludes  support \nactivities.\n\nfor \n\nThe  production  and  marketing  support  component  will  focus  on\nfour provinces in the relatively remote and poor western region of\nMongolia:  Dzavhan,  Hovd,  Gobialtay,  and  Urs.  The  credit\ncomponent will cover these provinces and, in addition, the north-\ncentral  provinces  of  Darhan-Uul  and  Selenge,  which  comprise\nthe country's most important wheat producing area. The Project\nwill be implemented over five years.\n\n\fSocial and\nEnvironmental\nIssues\n\nThe Policy Loan\n\nLoan Amount\nand Terms\n\nProgram Period\nand Tranching\n\nCounterpart Funds\n\nThe Investment Loan\n\nLoan Amount\nand Terms\n\nv\n\nSocial  and  environmental  assessments  indicated  that  none  of\nthe  ASDP  elements  are  expected  to  have  a  significant  adverse\nimpact  on  the  poor,  or  on  the  environment.  The  closely  linked\npolicy  actions  and  investments  in  the  areas  of  small-scale\nvegetable  production,  cooperative  development,  and  rural  credit\nprovision will directly benefit households with small herds, which\nconstitute  the  majority  of  the  poor  in  rural  areas.  Support  for\nimproved pasture management and well rehabilitation to reduce\nthe  pressure  on  overgrazed  areas  will  have  significant\nenvironmental benefits.\n\nA  loan  of  $7.0  million  equivalent  is  proposed  from  the  Special\nFunds  resources  of  ADB  in  support  of  the  policy  program.  The\nloan will have a maturity of 24 years, including a grace period of\n8 years. Interest will be charged at 1 percent per annum during\nthe grace period, and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter.\n\nThe  loan  will  be  used  over  four  years  from  the  date  of  loan\neffectiveness.  The  loan  funds  will  be  disbursed  in  two  equal\ntranches of $3.5 million equivalent. Release of the first tranche will\nbe  subject  to  loan  effectiveness.  The  second  tranche  will  be\nreleased  when  nine  conditions  are  met,  approximately  two  years\nafter the release of the first tranche.\n\nThe  proceeds  of  the  policy  loan  will  be  used  to  finance  the\nforeign  exchange  cost  of  items  produced  in  and  procured  from\nADB's  member  countries  (other  than  those  items  specified  in  a\nnegative  list  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and\nmultilateral sources). Procurement of eligible items will be on the\nbasis  of  normal  commercial  practices  for  procurement  by  the\nprivate sector or standard Government procedures acceptable to\nADB  for  procurement  by  the  public  sector.  However  for  goods\ninternational  commodity  markets,\ncommonly \nprocurement  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  procedures\nappropriate to the trade and acceptable to ADB.\n\ntraded  on \n\nThe  counterpart  funds  will  be  used  to  support  the  costs  of  the\npolicy program. Any counterpart funds not required for the policy\nprogram will be used first to finance local currency costs of other\nADB-financed  projects  and,  second,  for  general  development\npurposes.\n\nThe  total  project  cost  is  $13.1  million  equivalent.  The  proposed\nADB  loan  is  for  $10.0  million  equivalent  from  its  Special  Funds\nresources. The loan will have a maturity of 32 years, including a\n\nExecuting Agency\n\nMinistry of Finance and Economy (MFE)\n\nProcurement\n\n\fImplementation\nArrangements and\nExecuting Agency\n\nProcurement\nand Consulting\nServices\n\nTechnical Assistance\n\nRisks and Safeguards\n\nvi\n\ngrace period of 8 years. Interest will be charged at 1 percent per\nannum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5  percent  per  annum\nthereafter.\n\nThe  Executing  Agency  for  the  investment  loan  will  be  the\nMinistry  of  Food  and  Agriculture  (MFA).  To  ensure  effective\nimplementation,  a  steering  committee  chaired  by  the  deputy\nminister  of  finance  and  economy  will  be  created.  Project\nimplementation  agreements  will  be  executed  between  MFA  and\nthe  four  western  provinces.  For  the  implementation  of  the\nsubcomponent  on  rural  communication  links,  a  joint  order\nbetween MFA and the Ministry of Infrastructure will be executed,\nand  for  the  implementation  of  the  subcomponent  on  capacity\nbuilding  for  PFI  staff  and  subborrowers,  a  joint  order  between\nMFA  and  MFE  will  be  executed.  In  addition,  Bank  of  Mongolia\nwill enter into subsidiary loan agreements with PFIs.\n\nAll procurement will be in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on\nProcurement. Procurement of equipment, vehicles, and furniture\nwill  be  awarded  based  on  international  shopping  or  local\nto  ADB.  Small\ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable \ncontracts valued at less than $100,000 equivalent each may be\nawarded  on  the  basis  of  direct  purchase.  Consulting  services\ninclude  46  person-months  of  international  and  392  person-\nmonths  of  domestic  consulting,  a  training  contract,  and  two\nservice contracts. International consultants will be provided by a\nfirm  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of\nConsultants. Domestic consultants will be recruited by the firm in\naccordance with procedures acceptable to ADB.\n\nin  Agriculture.

A potential risk to the policy program is a delay in\nimplementing  some  of  the  policy  actions  due  to  institutional\nweaknesses  or  economic  uncertainties.  Safeguards  include  the\nsetting  of  a  period  of  two  years  between  the  first  and  second\ntranches,  and  another  period  of  two  years  between  the  second\ntranche and the end of the program to give adequate time for the\ncompletion of the policy reforms. In addition, many of the policy\nactions  are  closely  linked  to  activities  under  the  Project  and\nfor\nassociated  TA,  so \n\nindirectly  provided \n\nthat  support \n\nis \n\nTime Frame\n\nThe investment Project will be implemented over five years with\ncompletion expected by 31 March 2006.\n\n\fvii\n\nimplementing the policy measures.\n\nA potential risk for the investment Project involves the provision\nof  adequate  counterpart  financing.  The  Government  requires\nassistance  to  address  the  budget\u2019s  structural  problems,  which\nare  at  the  heart  of  the  current  budget  imbalance  and  cash\nshortage. The Governance Reform Program approved by ADB in\nimproving  public  expenditure\n1999  will \nmanagement.\n\ncontribute \n\nto \n\nA  potential  risk  to  the  credit  component  is  the  faltering  of  the\nongoing financial sector and banking reform. The Government is\ncommitted to continuing the reforms and ensuring the necessary\nframework to allow for the expansion of lending services in rural\nareas.  The  ADB-financed  Second  Financial  Sector  Program  in\ncoordination  with  the  World  Bank-financed  Financial  Sector\nAdjustment  Credit,  both  approved  in  2000,  will  help  mitigate  the\nrisk  of  faltering  financial  sector  and  banking  reforms.  The  credit\ncomponent  is  designed  to  allow  flexibility  for  PFIs:  any  financial\ninstitution  will  be  able  to  participate  as  long  as  it  meets  the\neligibility criteria.\n\nThe successful implementation of the Project will also depend on\nthe  capacity  of  the  agricultural  agencies  at  the  national,\nprovincial, and district levels. Most subcomponents of the Project\ncomprise capacity building and training activities. In addition, the\nproject  management  component  includes  assistance  to  MFA  to\nimprove monitoring and evaluation systems.\n\n\fviii\n\n\fI.\n\nTHE PROPOSAL\n\n1.\nI submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on two proposed\nloans  to  Mongolia  for  the  Agriculture  Sector  Development  Program  (ASDP).  The  report  also\ndescribes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Capacity  Building  in  Agriculture,  and  if  the\nproposed loans are approved by the Board, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the\nBoard, shall approve the TA.\n\nII.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n2.\nIn  response  to  a  Government  request,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  been\nconsidering  a  follow-up  loan  to  the  Agriculture  Sector  Program  (ASP)1  implemented  during\n1995-1998.2  A  feasibility  study3  conducted  from  October  to  December  1997  helped  focus  the\nASDP to (i) continue policy and institutional reform, (ii) increase the effectiveness of the former\nMinistry  of  Agriculture  and  Industry  and  local  governments  in  agriculture  development,  (iii)\npromote  rehabilitation  and  investment  in  the  agriculture  sector,  and  (iv)  improve  and  increase\nagricultural  production  in  a  sustainable  manner.  In  June  and  July  1999  and  October  1999  an\nagricultural  policy  consultant  was  fielded  to  improve  the  policy  agenda.  The  loan  Fact-Finding\nMission  was  fielded  in  January-February  2000,  followed  by  the  Loan  Preappraisal  Mission  in\nMarch-April 2000 which was subsequently upgraded to appraisal status. Following the elections\nin July 2000, a Project-specific Consultation Mission4 was fielded in September-October 2000 to\nconfirm the new Government\u2019s support for the ASDP.\n\n3.\nThis report is based on the consultants' studies and ADB staff field visits and discussions\nwith representatives of national, provincial, and district government agencies, herder and farmer\nhouseholds,  cooperatives  and  other  agricultural  associations,  the  private  sector,  potential\nparticipating  financial  institutions  (PFIs),  and  external  funding  agencies.  In  particular,  close\ncoordination was sought with the International Monetary Fund to ensure that the policy matrix of\nthe ASDP is consistent with ongoing Fund discussions. The program framework is presented in\nAppendix 1.\n\nA.\n\nMacroeconomic Context\n\nIII.\n\nTHE SECTOR\n\n4.\nSince  the  beginning  of  the  transition  in  1990,  Mongolia  has  made  great  progress  in\ndeveloping a democratic form of government and a market-based economic system. During the\nfirst four years of adjustment, the economy contracted sharply due to the withdrawal of Soviet\nassistance, equivalent to about 30 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), and the breakup of\nthe trading system with the member countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance.\nThe  collapse  of  the  state  budget  led  to  drastic  cuts  in  subsidies  and  welfare  programs.\nFurthermore, the economic restructuring and privatization process led to a severe retrenchment\nin public sector employment, and to the closure of many nonviable enterprises. Although much\nof  the  shed  labor  force  was  absorbed  by  the  extensive  livestock  sector,  and  in  part  by  the\ngrowing  informal  economy,  unemployment  and  poverty  increased  rapidly.  Based  on  the\n\n                                                          \n1 Loan 1409-MON: Agriculture Sector Program, for $35.0 million, approved on 5 December 1995.\n2 The  project  completion  report,  circulated  to  the  Board  on  31  May  2000,  showed  the  loan  to  have  been  partially\n\nsuccessful.\n\n3  TA 2819-MON: Agriculture Sector Development Program, for $492,000, approved on 27 June 1997.\n4  The Project-specific Consultation Mission comprised S.M. Scheierling, Project Economist and Mission Leader; M.\nJayawant,  Economist;  B.R.  Philips,  Manager;  B.J.  Hitchcock,  Sr.  Programs  Officer;  P.  Gittinger,  Agricultural\nEconomics  Expert;  and  A.  Wolz,  Cooperatives  and  Social  Development  Expert;  as  well  as  four  local  experts:  S.\nOyunchimeg, B. Burmaa, N. Batjargal, and U. Byambasuren.\n\n\f2\n\nGovernment's  income-based  poverty  line,  26  percent  of  the  population  was  living  below  the\nminimum living standard level by 1994.\n\n5.\nFrom 1994 to 1999 the economy recovered with real GDP growth averaging 3.6 percent.\nThe  source  of  growth  was  primarily  a  private  sector-led  recovery  in  the  agriculture  sector\nfollowing  the  privatization  of  livestock,  manufacturing,  and  services.  In  1996  the  Government\nadopted  an  ambitious  reform  program  to  complete  the  transition  to  a  market  economy,\naccelerate growth, and reduce poverty. Key elements of the program included reducing inflation,\nliberalizing prices, streamlining the public sector, developing the private sector, and establishing\na  social  safety  net.  As  a  result,  private  sector  activity  increased  sharply  and  exports  grew  as\nterms of trade improved in 1997. The exchange rate stabilized, and inflation fell from 47 percent\nin 1996 to 20 percent in 1997. In 1997, Mongolia joined the World Trade Organization, and most\nimport taxes were abolished.\n\n6.\nIn 1998 the terms of trade deteriorated resulting in lower tax revenues and undermining\nbank loan portfolios, thus contributing to severe problems in the banking system. In addition, the\neconomy was affected by the financial crisis in the Asian countries and the Russian Federation.\nPolitical uncertainty, resulting in two changes of government, undermined Mongolia's capacity to\nrespond  to  these  external  changes.  The  fiscal  deficit  widened  to  12  percent  of  GDP,  from  9\npercent  in  1997,  and  the  togrog  (MNT)  depreciated  by  11  percent  against  the  dollar.  Despite\nthese external shocks and political crises, the economy continued to grow and inflation declined\nto  6  percent.  But  the  number  of  households  living  below  the  poverty  line  remained  almost\nunchanged,5 suggesting increasingly inequitable growth.\n\nIn 1999, economic growth was sustained at 3.5 percent, and income per capita reached\n7.\nan estimated $435. Mainly due to a disruption of oil supplies from the Russian Federation and\nincreasing  world  market  prices  for  petroleum  products,  inflation  picked  up  and  reached  10\npercent at the end of the year. The exchange rate depreciated by 19 percent, thus contributing\nto a reduction in the trade balance deficit from 15 percent of GDP in 1998 to 9 percent in 1999.\nFiscal  performance  improved  in  1999  as  a  result  of  a  package  of  revenue  measures.  The\nexternal imbalance and the budget deficit were increasingly met by external borrowings at long-\nterm,  concessional  rates.  By  the  end  of  1999,  the  external  dept  had  grown  to  78  percent  of\nGDP, and official development assistance contributed about 30 percent of the budget.\n\n8.\nAccording  to  the  Action  Plan  of  the  new  Government,  which  came  into  power  in  July\n2000,  the  economic  policy  during  the  next  four  years  will  focus  on  continuing  and  deepening\neconomic  reform  and  accelerating  growth.  This  includes  ensuring  macroeconomic  stability;\nsetting  up  a  sound  banking  system    and  financial  sector;  continuing  the  privatization  process\nand  improving  its  efficiency;  restoring  domestic  industries  including  the  crop  industry,  and\npromoting  export,  in  particular  in  the  areas  of  livestock  raw  materials;  and  developing\ninfrastructure.\n\n9.\nMajor  achievements  in  macroeconomic  management  during  the  second  half  of  the\n1990s include the control of inflation and continued growth, however some uncertainty remains\nfor the country's short- to medium-term economic prospects. The dependence of the economy\non the exports of a few primary commodities, such as copper, gold, and cashmere, makes the\ncountry vulnerable to external shocks and contributes to the weakness of the external account.\nThe extremely harsh winter of 1999/2000 resulted in the loss of about 8 percent of Mongolia's\nlivestock,  which  may  have  far-reaching  implications  for  growth  and  poverty  reduction  in  the\n\n                                                          \n5 According  to  the  Government's  income-based  poverty  line,  26  percent  of  the  population  were  living  below  the\npoverty line in 1998. Living standards measurement surveys carried out in 1995 and 1998 estimated that in both\nyears about 36 percent of the population were living below an expenditure-based poverty line.\n\n\f3\n\ncoming  years.  Tax  revenue  collection  needs  to  be  improved  to  strengthen  the  fiscal  position,\nand direct foreign investment encouraged. The banking system continues to be relatively weak,\nand  the  range  of  available  financial  services  narrow.  This  is  constraining  private  sector\ndevelopment and growth, including in the agriculture sector.\n\nB.\n\nSector Description and Recent Performance\n\n1.\n\nOverview\n\nAgriculture  is  the  mainstay  of  Mongolia's  2.4  million  people  and  contributes  a  third  of\n10.\nGDP.  Agricultural  and  agroprocessed  exports  amount  to  about  one  third  of  foreign  exchange\nearnings. Agriculture is the source of employment for almost half of the population, and the most\nimportant source of household income in rural areas. Extensive livestock production is by far the\ndominant agricultural activity. Close to 80 percent of the country's total land area, or 128 million\nhectares  (ha),  is  pasture  land.  The  remaining  20  percent  is  considered  inaccessible  due  to\nmountain terrain or desert, or due to lack of water. Less than 1 percent of the land area, or 1.3\nmillion  ha,  is  considered  arable.  The  continental  climate  with  a  short  growing  season,  sharply\ndefined  seasons,  mean  annual  temperatures  between  \u20136o  and  +4o  Celsius,  low  precipitation,\nand  high  evapotranspiration  are  the  overriding  constraints  of  Mongolian  agriculture,  and  are\ncontributing factors to relatively fragile ecosystems.\n\n11.\nMongolia's  agriculture  sector  comprises  (i)  a  livestock  subsector,  consisting  mainly  of\nextensive livestock production based on the seasonal migration of mixed herds of sheep, goats,\ncattle,  horses,  and  camels;  and  some  intensive  livestock  production  with  housed  dairy  cattle,\npigs, and poultry; and (ii) a crop subsector concentrated on the production of wheat, the main\nstaple  food.  Crop  production  mostly  takes  place  on  relatively  large,  extensively  managed  and\nmechanized  farms  in  the  north-central  region  around  Ulaanbaatar.  Horticulture  production\ncomprises  mostly  potato  and  vegetables,  and  is  increasingly  based  on  small  family  plots  and\nsome commercial greenhouses.\n\n12.\nThe  transition  process  had  a  dramatic  impact  on  agriculture.  With  the  removal  of  the\nsupport  structure  previously  provided  by  the  state,  the  agriculture  sector  contracted  sharply  in\nthe early 1990s. However, by 1995 it had recovered to its 1989 level in real terms, and in 1998 it\nwas  14  percent  above  this.  In  contrast,  GDP  in  1995  was  only  84  percent,  and  in  1998,  93\npercent of its 1989 level in real terms (Appendix 2, Table A2.1). The relatively quick restoration\nof agricultural output helped to prevent a far worse economic contraction in the initial years of\nadjustment. In current prices, agriculture accounted for 15 percent of GDP in 1989. Agriculture's\nshare  rose  to  37  percent  in  1994,  the  first  year  of  economic  recovery.  Since  then  it  declined\nslightly  to  33  percent  in  1998.  In  real  terms,  the  share  of  agriculture  in  GDP  varied  less\ndramatically,  staying  at  around  37  percent  since  1995,  compared  with  30  percent  in  1989.\nWithin  agricultural  output,  the  share  of  the  livestock  subsector  increased  from  77  percent  in\n1989 to 90 percent in 1999, while the share of the crop subsector declined from 23 percent to\n10 percent. Employment in agriculture rose significantly, from 33 percent of total employment in\n1990 to about half in 1999.\n\n13.\nEven  though  agricultural  production  and  employment  increased  during  the  1990s,  the\nlinkages between the agriculture and industry sectors significantly declined. In 1989 more than\nhalf of industrial output was directly based on agriculture. By the end of the decade, this share\nhad decreased, both absolutely (to about 25 percent of its 1989 level) and relatively (to about a\nquarter of the total in 1989).\n\n\f2.\n\nCrop Subsector\n\n4\n\n14.\nDuring the late 1980s Mongolia was more than self-sufficient in wheat. For many years\nlarge state subsidies had stimulated the conversion of pasture land to cropped land, including in\nvery marginal areas. In 1989, 530,000 ha was sown with wheat.6 By 1999 this had declined by\nalmost a half to 273,000 ha (Appendix 2, Table A2.2). The areas planted to other crops, such as\npotatoes  and  fodder,  had  also  declined  considerably.  As  a  result,  crop  output  in  1999  was\nsignificantly below 1989 levels. Wheat output was a quarter, and fodder output 1 percent of the\n1989  level.  Only  potato  and  vegetable  output  showed  some  increase  in  the  last  few  years.\nAverage yields also declined significantly during the 1990s. Wheat yield fell from 1.3 tons per ha\nin 1989 to 0.6 tons per ha in 1999, although yields varied widely across provinces (from 0.17 ton\nto 1.5 tons per ha) and across farms, with some farms reaching over 2.5 ton per ha.\n\nPoor  seeds  are  a  major  contributing  factor  for  low  yields.  For  several  years,  little\n15.\ncommercial seed was available in the market; farmers used farm-saved seed of poor quality and\noutdated  varieties.  Other  factors  include  exhausted  soils,  little  use  of  fertilizers  or  pesticides,\nand failing machinery. While the demand for credit is high, in particular to buy inputs and minor\nequipment  at  the  beginning  of  the  cropping  season,  little  credit  has  been  available  for  crop\nfarmers over the last few years. The limited expertise of some of the new, private farmers also\nhas contributed to the decline in yields.\n\n16.\nBy  1999,  most  of  the  state  farms  were  fully  privatized,  with  about  80  percent  under\nsingle  (either  individual  or  company)  ownership.  There  are  now  about  300  farms  with  several\nthousand ha and many smaller farms with several hundred ha. An increasing share of vegetable\nproduction is taking place on small plots by households, mostly near urban centers. Vegetables\nare also grown commercially on some of the irrigated land, currently about 4,200 ha.\n\n17.\nIn the pretransition period, processing of crops largely involved the milling of wheat into\nflour  and  its  use  for  bread  and  bakery  production;  the  distilling  for  alcohol,  spirits,  and  other\nbeverage  manufacture;  and  the  production  of  manufactured  fodder.  During  the  1990s\nprocessing  activities  fell  sharply.  Flour  production  is  now  a  third,  and  bread  and  bakery\nproduction a quarter of their 1989 level. Manufactured fodder in 1998 was at 10 percent of the\n1989 level, largely due to the collapse of intensive livestock production. Only alcohol output has\nrisen above pretransition levels.\n\n18.\nExports  of  crop  products  have  essentially  disappeared,  while  imports  including  wheat,\nflour, potatoes, and vegetables are steadily increasing, and now account for about 10 percent of\ntotal imports. The import requirements for wheat in 1999 amounted to more than 50 percent of\nthe  country's  wheat  needs.  During  the  1990s,  wheat  and  flour  imports  have  largely  been\ncommodity aid-funded by the United States (US) and Japan.\n\n3.\n\nLivestock Subsector\n\na.\n\nPrivatization and Production\n\nPrior  to  1990,  pastoral  livestock  was  held  within  state-controlled  collectives  (negdels),\n19.\neach of which comprised the area of one district. Individual households were allowed to keep a\nsmall number of animals for personal use. The negdels employed herders as salaried workers,\nprovided  the  necessary  supplies  and  technical  advice,  marketed  the  produce,  and  offered\nvarious  social  and  cultural  benefits.  During  the  first  wave  of  privatization  in  1990/91  the\n                                                          \n6  Wheat production is mainly carried out using the monocropping strip system, which involves leaving a significant\n\nproportion of the land fallow in each year for cropping in the following year.\n\n\f5\n\ncollective  herds  were  distributed  to  negdel  members.  Since  then  total  livestock  numbers  have\nsteadily  increased,  from  25  million  in  1989  to  a  record  of  34  million  in  1999,  representing  an\nincrease of 36 percent (Appendix 2, Table A.2.3). With the increase in livestock numbers herd\ncomposition  also  changed.  Between  1989  and  1999  the  number  of  camels  declined  by  36\npercent, sheep remained relatively stable, horses increased by 11 percent, cattle increased by\n38 percent, and goats by more than 120 percent to 11 million head. The strong increase in the\nnumber of goats reflects the income opportunities from cashmere.\n\n20.\nIn  contrast  to  the  extensive  livestock  subsector,  intensive  livestock  production  has\nexperienced  a  sharp  decline.  With  their  reliance  on  imported  high  supplement  feed,  exotic\nspecies,  and  heated  housing  during  the  winter  (especially  for  pigs  and  poultry,  less  for  dairy\ncows), many production units became unviable with the loss of subsidies.\n\nProcessing  of  livestock  products  strongly  declined  during  the  1990s.  Meat  products  in\n21.\n1999  amounted  to  only  10  percent  of  their  1989  level.  Similar  declines  occurred  in  the\nprocessing of fibers (cashmere, camel hair, and wool) and hides and skins (cattle, horse, goat,\nand sheep). Export of many livestock products also dramatically declined. Meat exports fell from\n30,500 tons in 1989 to 2,200 tons in 1995, and then recovered to 7,500 tons in 1999. However,\nexport of unprocessed cashmere, and hides and skins in raw form continues to do well.\n\nb.\n\nLivestock Disaster During the Severe Winter\n\n22.\nThe continuous increase in livestock numbers over a favorable climatic period during the\n1990s came to a dramatic halt in the winter of 1999/2000. Following an unusually dry summer,\nthe winter of 1999/2000 was very harsh. Early and heavy snowfall in September-October 1999\ncontinued  to  build  up  and  denied  livestock  access  to  limited  forage.  Weakened  by  starvation,\nabout 2.7 million livestock or 8 percent of the total stock did not survive the cold. An estimated\n50,000 households were affected by livestock losses; many were households with small herds\nand little experience in herding. About 2,000 households lost all their livestock.\n\n23.\nIn the early phase of the disaster, the Government released strategic reserves of fodder\nand  fuel  to  affected  provinces,  and  distributed  relief  items  such  as  flour  and  tea.  The  State\nEmergency  Commission  organized  the  delivery  of  hay  and  fodder  to  the  worst  hit  areas.  In\nFebruary 2000, the Government launched an appeal for national and international donations to\nassist the herder population. Numerous nongovernment organizations (NGOs), embassies, and\ninternational  organizations  responded.  Short-term  relief  measures  until  June  2000  focused  on\nsupporting affected herder households and their livestock in overcoming the immediate effects\nof  disaster.  Since  July  2000  affected  herder  households  have  been  helped  to  restock  their\ndecimated herds and stock up food and fodder reserves for the winter.\n\nC.\n\nConstraints and Issues\n\n24.\nMajor  agricultural  reforms  introduced  by  the  Government  in  the  first  half  of  the  1990s\nincluded the privatization of state farms and negdels, deregulation of prices of major agricultural\nproducts,  and  liberalization  of  agricultural  trade.  These  policy  and  institutional  reforms  were\nsupported  by  the  ASP  (footnote  1).  From  1996  onward,  adopted  reforms  focused  on\nmacroeconomic  stabilization,  reduction  of  the  public  sector,  and  private  sector  development.\nDespite  substantial  progress  with  reform,  key  constraints  and  issues  remain  that  undermine\nagricultural performance.\n\n\f1.\n\nPrivate Sector Activity\n\n6\n\n25.\nDuring the 1990s almost all livestock and most crop farms were privatized. This process\nnow  needs  to  be  completed  with  the  privatization  of  the  remaining  crop  farms  which  have\nsignificant national or provincial government shareholdings.\n\n26.\nThe  changes  in  ownership  structure  have  frequently  failed  to  yield  significant\nimprovements  in  productivity  and  profitability.  This  is  mainly  because  the  supply  of  inputs,  the\nprocessing  and  marketing  of  outputs,  and  the  provision  of  financial  services,  which  previously\nwere  organized  and  controlled  by  the  state,  deteriorated  and  left  a  vacuum  that  has  not  been\nadequately filled by the private sector. Also many of the new owners have little knowledge, and\nreceived little advice, on how to manage their assets. Although Mongolia's human resources are\nhigh  in  literacy  and  technical  disciplines,  they  are  limited  in  terms  of  entrepreneurial  attitudes\nand  skills,  accounting,  marketing,  and  other  market-oriented  business  practices.  Increasingly,\nthe cooperative movement is seen as providing an important avenue to strengthen the needed\nhuman resource skills and management capacity.\n\n27.\nThe privatization of state-owned enterprises involved in the processing of livestock and\ncrop products proceeded much slower than that of livestock and crop farms. In the pretransition\nperiod  agricultural  processing  was  concentrated  in  a  few,  large  enterprises,  some  of  which\ncontinue to have the state as the major shareholder and hold a dominant market position. With\nthe collapse of traditional export markets, major agricultural processors are now operating at low\ncapacity,  seriously  constraining  their  ability  to  service  debts  and,  for  state-owned  enterprises,\nundermining  privatization  attempts.  In  addition,  several  large-scale  enterprises  that  were\ndeveloped  with  the  assistance  of  Council  of  Mutual  Economic  Assistance  countries,  such  as\nwool  spinning,  knitting,  shoe  making,  and  leather  factories,  became  unviable  with  the  end  of\ncentral  planning  and  had  to  shut  down.  As  a  result,  most  of  the  wool,  hides,  and  skins,  and\nabout half of the cashmere are now exported in raw form. Efforts are needed to help enterprises\nremaining  in  the  public  sector,  such  as  Biokombinat,  a  factory  which  produces  vaccines  for\ncombating animal diseases, to operate autonomously and compete fairly with the private sector.\n\n28.\nThe entry of new privately owned trading and processing enterprises has been slow due\nto the limited availability of investment and working capital, and the overly centralized structure\nof the remaining processing industry. However, the share of small- and medium-sized privately\nowned  plants  is  gradually  increasing,  and  in  some  areas,  such  as  cashmere  and  flour\nprocessing,  becoming  large  enough  to  challenge  the  market  power  of  the  large  processors.\nMost  of  the  investment  activities  are  taking  place  in  a  few  urban  centers,  indicating  a  role  for\ncarefully structured support programs to promote investment activities in more remote areas.\n\n2.\n\nTrade Regime and Taxation\n\n29.\nThe  liberalization  of  the  trade  regime  contributed  to  establishing  a  more  competitive\nposition  for  the  country's  domestic  production.  In  the  mid-1990s,  Mongolia  had  a  free  trade\nregime  with  zero  import  duties  and  no  nontariff  barriers.  This  policy  was  partially  reversed  in\n1999  when  a  discriminatory  trade  regime  with  tariffs  ranging  from  zero  to  15  percent  was\nreintroduced, with the 15 percent rate levied seasonally on wheat, potatoes, and vegetables. An\nexport tax on raw cashmere was adopted in 1997. Cumbersome and nontransparent customs\ncontrols  and  export  licensing  practices  also  tax  agricultural  exports.  To  encourage  export\ngrowth,  clear  procedures  need  to  be  established  for  applications  for  and  issuance  of  export\nlicenses for agricultural products.\n\n\f7\n\n30.\nCurrently the option of raising certain import duties and export taxes is under discussion,\nin part due to the need to contain the fiscal deficit. However, transport costs alone constitute an\nenormous penalty to Mongolian trade, and offer high rates of equivalent protection to domestic\nproduction.  Another  option,  in  the  longer  term,  would  be  to  broaden  the  tax  base.  Agriculture\ncurrently  accounts  for  about  a  third  of  GDP,  but  due  to  broad,  nontargeted  tax  exemptions\ncontributes  only  a  small  share  of  the  national  tax  revenue.  However,  as  the  tax  base  is\nbroadened, tax incentives need to be rationalized to encourage investment in rural areas.\n\n3.\n\nAgricultural Marketing System\n\n31.\nThe privatization of livestock and crop farms was carried out before the restructuring of\ninput and output marketing, which is needed to provide incentives and channels for increased\nagricultural  activity.  Partly  because  of  market  logistics  and  low  monetization,  subsistence\nproduction in rural areas, barter transactions, and in-kind wage payments are common. With a\nshortage of cash and a high-risk production environment, producers are reluctant to use inputs\nthat are not absolutely necessary. This, together with the lack of price differentiation for higher\nquality raw materials, is contributing to low productivity and poor product quality.\n\n32.\nProcessing  plants,  especially  for  livestock  raw  materials,  use  a  system  of  procurement\nagents  and  act  as  monopsonistic  buyers  in  small  rural  markets.  Producers  often  receive  not\ncash but kind, usually in the form of household consumption goods on which the terms of trade\nare  heavily  skewed  in  favor  of  the  agents.  Many  herder  households  are  isolated  during  the\nsummer when most buying takes place, and have little price information or access to markets.\nThe agent's willingness to buy small quantities of fiber or a few animals for trekking to slaughter\ncan be attractive to a herder with only a few animals and little market power. So far agricultural\nproducers  have  received  limited  advice  on  how  to  cooperate  to  improve  their  bargaining\nposition. However, in some regions cooperative marketing is increasingly being used to improve\nreturns for producers.\n\n33.\nThe marketing of agricultural raw materials follows a highly seasonal pattern. Cashmere\nis usually marketed in May, wool in July, wheat in September, and livestock in autumn. Due to a\nlack of working capital, many processing plants have difficulty acquiring the desired amount and\nquality  of  raw  materials  when  they  are  offered.  In  addition,  processors  in  the  crop  subsector\nhave  difficulty  competing  with  imported  goods,  and  many  livestock  processors  have  yet  to\nreestablish their export channels. Export opportunities in the meat and meat products industries\nare particularly constrained by the absence of standards and qualified, licensed veterinarians to\nsupervise meat hygiene and production.\n\n4.\n\nCooperative System\n\n34. When the negdels were privatized in the early 1990s, some ceased to exist, some were\nrestructured  into  other  legal  forms,  and  the  remainder  were  established  as  cooperatives.  New\ncooperatives have also been formed. Currently about 1,300 entities at the primary level have a\ntotal membership of about 5 percent of the Mongolian population. More than two thirds of these\nentities are cooperatives, and a quarter of them are agricultural cooperatives. The cooperatives\nare  organized  in  seven  cooperative  associations  covering  agriculture  (mainly  livestock),  small-\nscale industry and trade, and savings and credit services. Supplementary Appendix A provides\nan overview of the cooperative system and the activities of cooperatives and their associations.\n\n35.\nBy  the  mid-1990s,  many  households,  especially  in  rural  areas,  were  not  able  to\nparticipate in the emerging market economy. By working on their own and often in isolation, they\nhad few opportunities to pool limited resources and develop favorable market structures. Some\n\n\f8\n\nof the new herders households who had received livestock during the negdel privatization also\nlacked  the  professional  background  to  manage  these  assets.  Similar  to  other  transition\ncountries,  this  situation  created  new  interest  in  cooperatives.  When  asked  about  their  most\npressing  needs,  herder  and  cultivator  households,  especially  in  more  remote  areas,  often\nemphasize that besides improved access to financial services they need better marketing and\ninput supply channels. They are aware that when they bargain on their own with private traders\nthey  are  receiving  relatively  low  prices  for  their  produce,  while  they  pay  high  prices  for  inputs\nand  consumer  goods.  Many  realize  that  their  agricultural  activities  could  be  improved  if  they\norganized  themselves  into  groups  which  needed  to  be  larger  than  their  extended  family.\nCooperatives are seen by many agricultural and other rural producers as having the potential to\nexpand  the  local  organizational  basis  needed  for  economically  viable  activities,  such  as\nmarketing and processing, thereby providing greater income security and higher returns to their\nmembers.\n\n36.\nIn some regions cooperatives and their associations are now increasing their activities to\nimprove  services  and  provide  collective  income-earning  opportunities  for  their  members.\nHowever,  the  expansion  of  cooperative  activities  is  currently  limited  by  several  constraints.\nMany  rural  households  still  have  limited  knowledge  about  cooperative  activities  in  a  market\neconomy.  Also  cooperatives  have  limited  access  to  operating  capital,  necessary  for  their\nmarketing  activities,  and  to  investment  capital,  needed  to  improve  production,  marketing,  and\nprocessing facilities. Many cooperatives also lack the knowledge to prepare business plans and\nthe financial expertise to effectively use credit. Due to human resource and funding constraints,\nthe internal management of cooperatives and their cooperative associations is also often weak,\nand the provision of vital services such as accounting and auditing is limited. The tax treatment\nof  cooperatives  also  requires  significant  rationalization.  In  more  remote  areas,  communication\nand  transport  problems  pose  serious  constraints  to  cooperative  development.  The  legislative\nand  regulatory  framework  for  the  development  of  cooperatives  was  significantly  strengthened\nwith the adoption of the Cooperative Law and the Cooperative Development Program in 1998;\nhowever, the program remains largely unimplemented.\n\n5.\n\nRural Financial System\n\nBefore  1990,  all  banking  transactions  in  Mongolia  were  carried  out  by  the  State  Bank,\n37.\nwhich also acted as the central bank. The agriculture sector was supported through a complex\nsystem  of  subsidized  and  directed  credit  with  the  costs  being  largely  borne  by  the  financial\nsector, the national budget, and some countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance.\nIn 1991, the functions of the State Bank were transferred to the Bank of Mongolia (BOM), now\nacting  as  the  central  bank,  and  five  newly  established  commercial  banks.  During  the  1990s,\nseveral major financial crises were experienced, the last in 1998. Partly as a result of these, the\nfinancial  sector  has  remained  relatively  small,  and  little  cash  is  circulating  in  the  countryside.\nRestructuring of the financial sector continues with substantial assistance.7\n\n38.\nAt the beginning of 2000 Mongolia had 13 banks. Of these, the Agricultural Bank has by\nfar  the  largest  rural  network  with  branches  and  subbranches  in  most  provincial  and  district\ncenters.  During  the  most  recent  banking  crisis,  the  Agricultural  Bank  became  illiquid  and\ninsolvent,  and  in  1999  BOM  placed  it  under  conservatorship  and  later  receivership.  Lending\nactivities  were  stopped,  but  other  services  including  the  distribution  of  salaries  and  pension\n\n                                                          \n7  ADB has played an important role in the financial sector, providing TAs and two loans: Loan 1509-MON: Financial\nSector Program, for $35 million, approved on 16 December 1996; and, in cooperation with World Bank's Financial\nSector  Adjustment  Credit  of  $32  million,  Loan  1743-MON:  Second Financial Sector Program,  for  $15  million,\napproved on 22 June 2000.\n\n\f9\n\npayments continued. A restructuring plan was finalized, and a business plan prepared8 with the\naim of transforming the bank into a commercially viable entity. Following recapitalization in mid-\n2000,  control  of  the  Agricultural  Bank  was  passed  to  a  new  board  of  directors  and  executive\nmanagement,  including  two  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID)\nfunded staff. In September 2000, BOM and the World Bank approved the business plan for the\nperiod  up  to  July  2002.  BOM  approval  to  initiate  lending  activities  is  expected  by  the  end  of\n2000.\n\n39.\nThe  Post  Bank  has  the  second  largest  branch  network  and  is  in  the  process  of\nexpanding  its  rural  presence.  It  currently  offers  a  limited  amount  of  short-term  credit  to  larger\nagricultural  enterprises  from  its  headquarters.  In  the  first  quarter  of  2000,  the  Post  Bank\nreceived a BOM permit for lending in six provinces, and is now in the process of training its rural\ncredit  officers  to  be  able  to  start  rural  lending  in  November  2000.  The  ZOOS  Bank  and  Erel\nBank are among a small group of banks that have a limited branch network. They provide some\nfinancial  services  to  rural  clients,  mostly  to  agricultural  marketing  and  processing  companies.\nMongolia's  nonbank  financial  sector,  comprising  savings  and  credit  cooperatives,  finance\ncompanies,  and  leasing  companies,  is  at  a  nascent  stage  of  development.  Most  of  these\nbusinesses are not active in rural areas. An overview of the rural financial system is provided in\nSupplementary Appendix B.\n\nCurrently little credit is available for people in rural areas. Interest rates are high in real\n40.\nterms, ranging from 2.5 to 5 percent per month at commercial banks and about 10 percent per\nmonth at pawnshops, but is slowly declining as the financial system recovers. A recent study9\nshows that about a quarter of rural households have bank accounts, which are mostly used for\nreceiving  pensions,  salaries,  and  other  transfers.  Savings  mobilization  is  constrained  by  the\nperception  that  banks  have  limited  credibility.  About  80  percent  of  the  rural  households  claim\nthat  they  are  in  urgent  need  of  reliable  financial  services,  and  that  they  are  looking  for  safe\nsavings  options  as  well  as  credit  opportunities.  Delivery  of  financial  services  and  improved\naccess to credit for the rural population is a key requirement for restoring economic growth and\nemployment in rural areas, and coordinated aid support to strengthen the rural financial system\ncontinues to be essential.\n\n6.\n\nInstitutional Capacity and Governance\n\n41.\nDuring  the  last  decade,  a  series  of  major  changes  were  introduced  regarding  the\ninstitutional  setup  of  agricultural  and  agriculture-related  agencies  nationally  and  locally.  In  a\ndevolution  of  administrative  control  to  the  local  level  during  the  early  1990s,  the  Government\ntransferred several agricultural functions to the 22 provincial governments. In 1996, the Ministry\nof Food and Agriculture and the Ministry of Industry were amalgamated to form the Ministry of\nAgriculture  and  Industry.  The  structure  of  Government  agricultural  support  services  was\nrationalized  and  grouped  in  either  implementing  or  regulatory  functions  within  two  main\nagencies under the ministry. These organizational changes were accompanied with a significant\nreduction  in  the  number  of  staff.  In  addition,  fiscal  constraints  resulted  in  reduced  nonsalary\ndiscretionary budgets, and high staff turnover. Policy formulation in the agriculture sector lacked\nan  overall  framework  for  subsector  policies  and  programs,  and  aid  coordination  was  weak.\nPolicy implementation was largely dependent on lower levels of government, which often did not\nhave the policy priorities and funding resources required to implement programs designed at the\nnational  level.  No  consistent  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  program  implementation  was\n\n                                                          \n8 Support  has  been  provided  under  TA  3208-MON: Strengthening Restructuring of the Bank System \u2013 Agriculture\n\nBank of Mongolia, for $220,000, approved on 17 June 1999.\n\n9 Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  and  Ministry  of  Finance,  Mongolia.  2000.

Ulaanbaatar.\n\n\f10\n\nconducted,  and  the  lack  of  electricity  and  outdated  telephone  connections  in  most  district\ncenters made communication within provinces difficult.\n\n42.\nFollowing the elections in July 2000, the Government structure was again reorganized.\nThe former Ministry of Agriculture and Industry was split into the Ministry of Industry and Trade\nand the Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MFA). The internal organization of MFA and its related\nimplementing  and  regulatory  agencies  was  streamlined.  Salaries  were  increased,  and  new\nmanagement systems introduced. Institutional strengthening is nevertheless required for MFA to\nfulfill its mandated role in policy formulation, regulation, and monitoring and evaluation, and to\ncontinue  the  transformation  of  its  functions  away  from  direct  involvement  in  agricultural\nproduction  and  marketing  activities.  Commodity  aid  emerged  as  an  important  feature  of  the\nagricultural economy in the 1990s with the potential to significantly distort domestic markets, if\nnot carefully managed. The proceeds from the monetization of commodity aid now need to be\nmanaged and utilized in a transparent and accountable manner, and the remaining procurement\nand  sales  activities  of  Government  agencies  must  be  carried  out  without  influencing  market\nprices.\n\n7.\n\nAgricultural Support Services\n\n43. With the institutional changes during the last few years, the emphasis on cost recovery\nfor  agricultural  support  services  has  increased.  But  producers  often  find  it  difficult  to  avail  of\nthese services because of limited cash availability, the high cost of credit, and adverse terms-of-\ntrade  between  agricultural  inputs  and  outputs.  The  outreach  of  MFA\u2019s  agricultural  extension\ncenter is severely curtailed by the lack of staff and budgetary resources. Agricultural research is\nsimilarly  weak.  It  provides  little  tangible  support  to  extension  services,  and  is  not  oriented  to\nmeeting  the  demand  of  agricultural  producers  or  processors.  To  support  private  sector\ndevelopment, agricultural research services need to be responsive to the demands of producers\nand processors, and adequately organized and funded. Some success has been achieved with\nthe Green Revolution Program, approved in 1997, which aims to improve supplementary food\nand income to low income families by assisting with potato and vegetable production. It relies on\nthe  lower  levels  of  Government  as  well  as  on  the  initiatives  of  schools  and  NGOs  in  the\ncountryside.  It  is  credited  as  having  contributed  to  the  increased  potato  and  vegetable\nproduction that occurred in the second half of the 1990s. The Green Revolution Program can be\nenhanced  by  (i)  strengthening  the  involvement  of  NGOs  by  awarding  them  contracts  for\nprogram  implementation,  (ii)  focusing  benefits  on  vulnerable  groups,  (iii)  including  a  broader\nrange  of  activities,  (iv)  introducing  cost  recovery,  and  (v)  establishing  a  mechanism  at  the\nprovincial  level  to  ensure  that  the  different  programs  targeted  at  vulnerable  groups  are\ncoordinated.\n\n44.\nVeterinary  and  breeding  services  are  partly  privatized,  but  public-private  partnership\narrangements are still being adjusted with little progress to date. The professionalism of private\nveterinary practitioners needs to be upgraded, and the system of their remuneration revised to\nreflect their role as service providers in a market economy. In the area of vaccination policy, the\nGovernment must concentrate its limited resources on effective control of a limited range of key\ndiseases  rather  than  pursuing  an  ineffective  program  aimed  at  the  complete  coverage  of\nlivestock  diseases.  Some  efforts  have  been  undertaken  to  introduce  commercial  seed\nmultiplication  but  this  has  had  little  impact  on  the  availability  of  quality  seed,  and  farmers  are\nforced  to  use  farm-saved  seed  of  poor  quality  and  outdated  varieties.  Due  to  poor\ncommunication channels in rural areas, many agricultural producers have no access to market\ninformation.  This  together  with  the  limited  availability  and  affordability  of  suitable  support\nservices is a major constraint to improving agricultural productivity and the quality of products.\n\n\f8.\n\nSocial Transformation\n\n11\n\n45.\nUnder central planning, unemployment and poverty were virtually unknown. Cutbacks in\npublic expenditure during the transition period led to a sharp decline in social services and jobs\nin provincial and district centers, and to an increase in the number of people considered to be\npoor. This was accompanied by a shift in population to rural areas. From 1990 to 1999, the rural\npopulation increased from 40 percent of the total population to almost 50 percent. People have\nalso  been  moving  out  of  the  provincial  centers  and  minor  towns  either  to  Ulaanbaatar,  which\nhas grown by 16 percent since 1990, or to the countryside. In rural areas the extensive livestock\nsector  has  been  functioning  as  an  informal  safety  net  in  times  of  limited  formal  employment\nopportunities.\n\n46.\nThe privatization of the negdel livestock together with the population shift to rural areas\nresulted  in  a  nearly  threefold  increase  in  the  number  of  herders  (from  148,000  in  1990  to\n418,000  in  1999).  Similarly,  the  number  of  households  whose  primary  source  of  income  is\nderived from herding more than doubled (from 69,000 in 1989 to 197,000 in 1998) and is now\nequivalent to about 40 percent of the population. Strengthened by the overall growth in livestock\nnumbers,  herd  size  has  increased  substantially.  Following  privatization  in  1990,  about  80\npercent  of  households  with  livestock  owned  less  than  50  animals,  and  only  4  percent  owned\nmore  than  100  animals.10  By  1999,  the  number  of  households  with  less  than  50  animals\ndeclined to 36 percent, and the number of households with more than 100 animals increased to\n41  percent.  In  addition,  the  spread  of  households'  herd  sizes  increased.  In  1999  more  than\n1,200  households  had  more  than  1,000  animals;  the  majority  of  herder  households  had  only\nenough  animals  to  live  on  a  subsistence  basis.  Many  of  the  people  who  moved  to  the\ncountryside to become new herders have small, marginally viable herds and limited skills, and\nare most vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks.\n\n9.\n\nPasture and Well Management\n\n47.\nDuring  the  last  decade,  pressure  on  pastures  has  been  widespread  and  increasing\nbecause  of  the  significant  changes  in  the  size,  structure,  and  management  of  the  extensive\nlivestock  subsector.  The  national  herd  grew  by  about  8  million  head,  or  19  million  sheep\nequivalent units (SEU),11 and the average stocking rate increased from 0.34 SEU per ha to 0.46\nSEU  per  ha.  The  main  reasons  for  the  growth  in  livestock  number  include  the  need  of  an\nincreasing number of herder households to secure their livelihood, the general perception that\nmore livestock will increase economic security, the lack of marketing channels  to sell animals\nand the limited export demand, a large increase in the price for cashmere, and the absence of a\nweather-induced catastrophe until the winter of 1999/2000.\n\n48.\nOvergrazing  and  the  loss  of  pasture  productivity  was  recognized  prior  to  1990,  and\nattempts  were  made  to  address  the  problem  by  (i)  large-scale  provision  of  supplementary\nfodder by the state; (ii) heavy investment in the development of wells, bores, and pumps to open\nup  previously  underutilized  grazing  land  by  providing  reliable  stock-watering  facilities;  and  (iii)\ncontrols on the movement of herders, mostly within a particular district, relying on the authority\nof  negdel  managers  and  the  district  governor.  During  the  1990s  these  measures  were\ndiscontinued.  As  a  result,  the  fodder  supply  industry  has  almost  disappeared.  More  than  40\n\n                                                          \n10 A herd of about 100 animals is generally considered as the minimum size for a self-sustaining household, although\nthe number varies considerably according to geographic area and species mix. Herding households with less than\n100 animals have been assessed as below the poverty line. Such herds are considered unsustainable and doomed\nto decline as the off-take exceeds the reproduction rate.\n\n11 Livestock  head  are  converted  to  SEUs  using  the  following  factors:  sheep,  1;  goat,  0.9;  cattle,  6;  horse,  7;  and\n\ncamel, 5.\n\n\f12\n\npercent  of  the  wells  and  bores  nationwide  have  become  inoperative  due  to  the  lack  of\nmaintenance. Pastures that previously were supported by stock-watering facilities are now little\nused, and herder households who used to rely on these lands have moved to areas with reliable\nwater  supplies.  Furthermore,  not  much  progress  has  been  achieved  in  developing  the  tenure\nsystem for pasture land,12 and controls on herder movements are weak to nonexistent. This has\nencouraged  a  significant  migration  of  herder  households  areas  adjacent  to  larger  towns  and\ncities, and the central region of the country in order to have better access to markets, schools,\nand health services. Together, these factors have contributed to local overgrazing and conflicts\nover pasture rights, especially around population centers and major transportation routes.\n\n49.\nTo  address  this  situation,  improved  land  management  systems  and  institutions  are\nurgently needed, including innovative mechanisms for conflict resolution. The former Ministry of\nAgriculture  and  Industry  in  1998  started  a  small  well  rehabilitation  program  to  increase  the\nnumber of stock-watering points. Resources for well rehabilitation must be reinforced by putting\nin  place  arrangements  for  the  sustainable  operation  and  maintenance  of  wells,  and  by\nintroducing a cost recovery mechanism.\n\n10.\n\nRisk Management\n\n50.\nUnder central planning the state provided a comprehensive risk management system for\nagricultural  producers,  including  continuous  training  and  advice,  salaries,  livestock  insurance,\nemergency fodder supplies, radio communication channels covering almost all of the country's\ndistricts, and national and local emergency plans, which included transport facilities for herder\nhouseholds and their animals in times of natural disasters. During the last decade this support\nstructure ceased to exist, and agricultural producers were forced to individually shoulder all risk\nassociated with agricultural production in a harsh environment. The severity of the effects of the\nlivestock  disaster  of  the  winter  of  1999/2000  are  to  a  large  extent  a  result  of  the  loss  of  the\nprevious risk management system.\n\n51.\nIn addition to the short-term causes of the livestock disaster, i.e., a dry summer followed\nby  an  early,  cold,  and  snowy  winter,  several  medium-  to  long-  term  causes  contributed\nsignificantly  to  the  large  impact.  They  include  the  inflow  of  inexperienced  persons  to  the\nextensive  livestock  subsector  and  the  concomitant  emergence  of  many  relatively  small  and\neconomically unsustainable herds, the unbalanced composition and growth of herds, increasing\nparasite loads due to limited veterinary services, uncontrolled breeding, the lack of reserves of\nhay  and  animal  feed,  shrinking  grazing  areas  due  to  the  lack  of  stock-watering  points,  the\nconcentration  of  livestock  in  areas  around  market  centers,  the  breakdown  of  communication\nchannels  in  rural  areas,  and  related  to  that,  inadequate  early  warning  systems  and  disaster\nmanagement planning.\n\nMedium- to longer-term measures to help reduce the vulnerability of the country to future\n52.\nnatural  disasters  need  to  include  support  for  (i)  alternative  employment  opportunities  for  small\nherder households such as vegetable production, (ii) better animal health, (iii) increased water\nand  feed  supply  for  livestock,  (iv)  improved  marketing  channels  to  reduce  the  need  of  herder\nhouseholds  to  graze  their  animals  near  provincial  and  district  centers,  and  (v)  improved  rural\ncommunication channels. Close aid coordination will be essential to enable the Government to\n\n                                                          \n12 The Land Law and the Land Management Regulations adopted in 1995 provide for a continued state-ownership of\nland,  and  for  long-term,  inheritable,  but  nontransferable  leases  to  individuals  and  economic  entities.  Lease\ncertificates  are  issued  for  arable  land  and  dairy  farms,  but  not  for  pasture  land.  The  Land  Fee  Payment  Law  of\n1997  sets  fees  for  leasing  land  from  the  state,  yet  livestock  herders  using  common  pastureland  and  haymaking\nareas are exempt from land fee payments.\n\n\f13\n\naddress  these  needs  and  to  support  the  development  of  an  integrated  approach  to  risk\nmanagement, including improved provision of agricultural insurance.\n\nD.\n\nGovernment Expenditure\n\nAlthough agriculture contributes more than a third of GDP, only about 1.3 percent of total\n53.\nGovernment expenditure is being allocated for agricultural purposes. In 1999, this amounted to\nMNT4,861 million, of which MNT4,165 million was allocated for the national level and MNT696\nmillion for the country's 22 provinces. About 10 percent of the agricultural budget at the national\nlevel  was  used  for  salaries  and  benefits  of  staff  in  the  former  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and\nIndustry,  and  its  implementing  and  regulatory  agencies.  Close  to  42  percent,  or  MNT1,755\nmillion, was spent on the supply of free vaccines for herders. The other main expenditure items\nincluded  the  State  Reserve  (for  wheat,  seed,  and  other  goods)  with  MNT570  million,  pasture\nprotection  from  rodents  with  MNT230  million,  well  rehabilitation  with  MNT292  million,  and  the\nGreen Revolution Program with MNT180 million.\n\nE.\n\nGovernment Objectives and Strategy\n\n54.\nThe  Action  Plan  of  the  new  Government  adopted  in  September  2000  outlines  key\nobjectives  in  several  policy  areas,  including  economic  policy,  social  policy,  and  regional  and\nrural  development  policy.  A  key  objective  in  the  area  of  economic  policy  is  to  continue  and\ndeepen  economic  reform  and  accelerate  economic  growth  by  (i)  ensuring  macroeconomic\nstability  and  strengthening  fiscal  policies;  (ii)  setting  up  a  sound  banking  system  and  financial\nsector,  including  restructuring  and  strengthening  the  Agricultural  Bank;  (iii)  continuing  the\nprivatization  process  and  improving  its  efficiency;  (iv)  restoring  domestic  industries  and\npromoting export (in particular in the areas of livestock raw materials such as meat, fibers, skin,\nand hides), preventing a further decline in the crop industry, and intensifying the implementation\nof the Green Revolution Program; and (v) developing infrastructure. In the area of social policy,\na key element is the goal to reduce the number of households living under the poverty line by\nhalf by the end of 2004.\n\n55.\nThe medium-term objectives for regional and rural development focus on improving the\nliving standards of people in rural areas through economic development, infrastructure, as well\nas taxation, investment, and credit policies. This includes (i) designing tax policies to encourage\ngrowth  and  investment  in  the  regions;  (ii)  supporting  herder  initiatives  for  improving  their  life\nthrough  the  establishment  of  cooperatives;  (iii)  adopting  a  livestock  insurance  system  and  a\nsystem for protecting livestock from natural disasters, and establishing a disaster relief network;\n(iv)  developing  cooperation  among  herders,  farmers,  business  entities,  and  scientific  and\nresearch  organizations;  (v)  improving  the  fight  against  animal  diseases  and  strengthening  the\ncapacity  of  veterinary  laboratories;  (vi)  improving  water  supply  in  pasture  areas  and  resolving\nthe  issue  of  ownership  of  water  spots;  (vii)  equipping  all  provincial  centers  with  improved\ntelephone connections; and (viii) renovating and expanding radio studios, providing all provincial\ncenters  with  radio  stations,  and  increasing  the  number  and  duration  of  radio  channels  in  rural\nareas.\n\nF.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n56.\nSince  the  beginning  of  the  transition,  several  multilateral  and  bilateral  development\nagencies have supported Mongolia's agriculture sector. An overview is presented in Appendix 3.\nThree loans have been approved, including the ADB-funded ASP (footnote 1) and the Cadastral\nSurvey and Land Registration Project,13 and a loan from the International Fund for Agricultural\n                                                          \n13 Loan 1736-MON: Cadastral Survey and Land Registration Project, for $9.9 million, approved on 2000.\n\n\f14\n\nDevelopment,  which  provides  funds  for  poor  households  in  two  provinces  to  acquire  livestock\nfrom better-off farmers.\n\n57.\nIn the area of grant aid to the agriculture sector, three multilateral agencies predominate.\nThe  United  Nations  Development  Programme  financed  an  emergency  seeds  project  involving\nthe  import  of  Kazakh  wheat  for  multiplication.  The  European  Union  helped  to  strengthen\nveterinary  diagnostic  capabilities  and  laboratories,  and  in  1999  initiated  a  crop  development\nproject,  which  provides  training  in  farm  management  and  marketing  for  enterprises  and\nadministrators  in  selected  areas.  In  a  second  phase  due  to  commence  in  2001  it  will  support\nimproved  wheat  seed  production.  The  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  financed  several\nsmaller projects in the livestock and crop subsectors.\n\nthe  Deutsche  Gesellschaft \n\nInternational  Development  Assistance,  and \n\n58.\nAmong the bilateral agencies are the Japan International Cooperation Agency, USAID,\nf\u00fcr\nthe  Danish \nTechnische  Zusammenarbeit  (GTZ).  Japan  provides  the  most  bilateral  assistance.  Assistance\nhas  been  provided  for  upgrading  agroprocessing  industries,  and  for  studies  on  agricultural\ncooperatives,  rural  banking,  and  saving  mobilization.  In  addition,  Japan  has  supplied  food  aid\nconsisting of flour and wheat, and provided fertilizers and agricultural machinery, which is sold\nthrough  subsidized  installment  credit  to  farmers  selected  by  MFA.  The  US  has  also  provided\ncommodity aid, mainly in the form of wheat. Some of the counterpart funds generated from the\nsale of the wheat are used in the Agricultural Development Fund managed by MFA. Since 1997,\nUSAID has been assisting a number of smaller initiatives in crop and livestock production. GTZ\nis  involved  in  promoting  family  farming,  supporting  the  privatization  of  veterinary  services,\ntraining  cooperative  members,  and  assisting  the  Agricultural  Bank.  The  ASDP  has  been\ndesigned in close cooperation with the main international and bilateral development partners in\nthe agriculture sector.\n\nG.\n\nADB's Operations and Strategy in the Sector\n\n1.\n\nCountry Operational Strategy\n\n59.\nADB's  first  country  operational  strategy  (COS)  for  Mongolia  was  adopted  in  1994.  Its\nmain  aim  was  to  facilitate  the  country's  transition  to  a  market  economy  and  to  stimulate\neconomic  growth.  In  the  agriculture  sector,  the  focus  was  mainly  on  improving  the  policy  and\ninstitutional  environment.  During  the  period  covered  by  the  first  COS,  Mongolia  implemented\nsubstantial  reforms  and  experienced  reasonable  growth  rates.  But  economic  growth  did  not\nresult in a significant reduction in the number of people living below the poverty line.\n\n60.\nThe new COS endorsed in March 2000 is placing poverty reduction at the same level of\nimportance as the need to stimulate economic growth. The main objective is to foster economic\ngrowth  and  reduce  poverty  by  focusing  on  income  and  employment  generation  by  developing\nthe  private  sector.  The  strategy  emphasizes  the  need  to  promote  good  governance  as  an\noverarching objective. ADB interventions are to be guided by the main objective of growth with\npoverty  reduction.  Of  the  five  core  sectors  identified  for  ADB  support,  agriculture  has  the\npotential  to  (i)  support  private  sector-led  expansion  of  economic  activity,  (ii)  strengthen  the\nenabling  legal  and  regulatory  environment  to  stimulate  private  sector  activity,  (iii)  improve\nsupport services to overcome constraints to agricultural development, (iv) promote the improved\nprovision of financial services in rural areas, and (v) support improvements in land tenure.\n\n61.\nThe  main  features  of  the  COS  and  the  strong  commitment  to  reduce  poverty  are\nsummarized  in  the  Partnership  Agreement  signed  in  March  2000.  The  Partnership  Agreement\nidentifies  specific  targets  for  poverty  reduction  and  establishes  mechanisms  to  monitor\n\n\f15\n\nperformance. A key target is to reduce the proportion of people living below the poverty line by\nat least half by 2005. The ASDP is fully consistent with ADB's country and sector strategy and\nthe Partnership Agreement.\n\n2.\n\nADB Experience\n\n62.\nIn the initial years after Mongolia joined ADB in 1990, ADB's operations in the agriculture\nsector were limited to providing TA. In 1992/93 three project preparatory TAs14 were approved\nbut  processing  was  deferred  pending  a  comprehensive  sector  review.  This  review  was\nundertaken  in  the  second  half  of  1993,15  and  identified  serious  weaknesses  in  the  policy  and\ninstitutional  environment  that  undermined  the  Government's  capacity  to  either  effectively\nimplement  projects  or  bring  about  the  transition  to  a  sustainable,  private  sector-led  agriculture\nsector. As a result, ADB's support shifted to policy and institutional reform in 1994, and in 1995\nthe ASP was approved. The reform program covered three broad policy areas including (i) the\npromotion of competitive markets, (ii) institutional support to facilitate competitive markets, and\n(iii)  social  and  environmental  concerns.  Two  TAs  were  simultaneously  approved  covering\ninstitutional  strengthening  of  the  former  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Industry  and  its  related\norganizations,16  and  strengthening  land-use  policies.17  In  addition,  a  study  of  the  extensive\nlivestock production systems was approved in 1996.18\n\nADB's  experience  with  loans  to  Mongolia's  agriculture  sector  is  limited  to  the  ASP\n63.\nimplemented during 1995-1998. A program completion review carried out in 1999 evaluated the\nimplementation  and  coordination  of  the  ASP  as  partially  successful.  While  the  ASP\u2019s  policy\nreform  agenda  was  not  fully  achieved,  general  progress  in  macroeconomic  reform  was  rather\nimpressive.  In  particular,  the  privatization  process  made  significant  progress,  despite  a  slow\nstart,  and  price  liberalization  of  the  major  agricultural  and  food  products  was  largely\naccomplished.  Several  lessons  can  be  learned  from  ASP  implementation.  First,  ownership  of\nthe  policy  reform  agenda  and  commitment  to  its  implementation  are  critical  to  the  success  of\nreform  measures.  Second,  within  a  transition  economy  such  as  Mongolia,  the  already  weak\nimplementation  capacity  of  relevant  institutions  is  eroded  by  the  fiscal  constraints  that\naccompany the early stages of the reform process. Longer-term TA is needed to improve and\nmonitor implementation. And third, continuing dialogue with the aid community is needed over\nthe program period to ensure coordination with other programs. These lessons have been taken\ninto account in the design of the ASDP.\n\n64.\nThe  ASP  was  one  of  several  program  loans  supported  by  ADB  to  support  structural\nadjustment. A relatively high percentage of ADB lending to Mongolia, with about 29 percent of\nall  loans  and  32  percent  of  the  total  loan  amount,  have  been  program  loans.  Release  of  the\nsecond  tranches,  albeit  with  delays  in  some  of  the  program  loans,  demonstrate  the\nGovernment's commitment to, and capability for implementing difficult policy and sector reforms.\nOverall,  ADB's  portfolio  in  Mongolia  is  performing  satisfactorily  and  implementation  is\nproceeding  on  schedule,  despite  economic  uncertainty,  fiscal  constraints,  and  institutional\nweaknesses.\n\n                                                          \n14 TA  1639-MON:  Livestock  Feed  Improvement,  for  $410,900,  approved  on  7  January  1992;  TA  1808-MON:\nAgricultural Processing, Storage and Distribution,  for  $400,000,  approved  on  17  December  1992;  and  TA  1886-\nMON: Irrigation Systems Rehabilitation, for $500,000, approved on 13 May 1993.\n\n15 Asian Development Bank. 1994.

However,  lessons  can  be  learned  from  ADB's  operational\nexperience  with  agricultural  projects  in  other  transition  economies  of  Central  Asia.  These\nlessons emphasize the consideration of (i) the dynamic nature of agriculture sector reforms and\nthe  need  for  close  monitoring  of  project  implementation,  (ii)  the  critical  importance  of  strong\nGovernment ownership of the project and commitment to its implementation, and (iii) a realistic\nassessment  of  institutional  capacity  of  Government  implementation  agencies.  These  lessons\nwere incorporated in the design of the ASDP\u2019s investment Project by supporting activities that\nare part of the Government agenda, as outlined in the Action Plan, and addressing the urgent\nneed for capacity building.\n\nIV.\n\nTHE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\n66.\nMongolia's  transition  from  a  centrally  planned  to  a  market-oriented  system  during  the\n1990s has had a dramatic impact on the agriculture sector. With the removal of large subsidies\npreviously  provided  by  the  state,  the  agriculture  sector  contracted  sharply  in  the  early  1990s.\nHowever,  by  the  mid-1990s  agriculture  had  restored  output  to  pretransition  levels,  and  thus\nhelped to prevent a far worse contraction of the economy in the initial years of the transition.\n\n67.\nEven though the agriculture sector, in particular the extensive livestock subsector, was\nable  to  support  the  economy  during  the  most  difficult  years,  several  factors  continue  to\nundermine  its  performance.  This  is  despite  the  implementation  of  major  market  reforms,\nincluding  privatization,  deregulation  of  prices  of  agricultural  products,  and  liberalization  of\nagricultural trade. It is becoming increasingly apparent that while almost all livestock and most\ncrop farms have been privatized, many of the new owners have little knowledge, and have not\nbeen  taught  how  to  manage  their  assets  in  a  market  economy.  The  supply  of  critical  support\nservices,  which  was  previously  organized  and  controlled  by  the  state,  deteriorated  and  left  a\nvacuum that has not yet been adequately filled by the private sector. While the financial sector\nis being restructured with substantial external assistance, very little lending is provided in rural\nareas.  The  limited  availability  of  credit  in  the  countryside  and  the  high-risk  production\nenvironment of Mongolia's agriculture sector negatively affect the demand for support services.\nThe supply of support services such as research and extension is weak due to lack of staff and\nbudget resources. Other support services, such as veterinary services, are partly privatized but\npublic-private partnership arrangements are still being adjusted with little progress to date. As a\nresult of the limited availability and use of support services and other inputs, the productivity of\nmany agricultural enterprises is very low. In the livestock subsector the problem is intensified by\nthe overgrazing of many pastures as a result of the substantial increase in the national herd and\nthe large number of inoperative stock-watering wells.\n\n68.\nClosely  related  to  the  problem  of  low  productivity  is  the  lack  of  marketing  channels\nneeded  to  increase  incentives  for  agricultural  activity.  The  restructuring  of  marketing  and  the\nprivatization  of  processing  enterprises  has  proceeded  much  slower  than  the  privatization  of\nlivestock  collectives  and  state  farms.  With  the  collapse  of  traditional  export  markets  and  the\nreduction  of  subsidies,  many  agricultural  processing  plants  have  been  closed,  and  the\nremaining  are  operating  with  low  capacity.  The  entry  of  private  trading  and  processing\nenterprises has been slow due to the lack of investment and working capital. Partly because of\nmarket  logistics  and  low  monetization  in  rural  areas,  subsistence  production  and  barter\ntransactions  are  now  common.  Due  to  poor  communication  links,  many  agricultural  producers\nhave  little  access  to  market  and  other  information.  The  cooperative  system,  which  offers  the\nmost  promising  avenue  for  the  provision  of  marketing  and  other  services,  the  delivery  of  local\n\n\f17\n\npublic  goods,  and  collective  income-earning  activities  in  rural  areas  is  only  recently  receiving\nincreasing attention.\n\n69.\nTo  address  these  two  main  problem  areas,  i.e.,  low  productivity  and  limited  marketing\nchannels,  and  the  resulting  constraints  on  income-earning  opportunities  in  rural  areas,  a  two-\npronged approach is required. This involves (i) the deepening and refinement of the policy and\nlegal framework for agriculture, and (ii) the improved provision of support services for production\nand marketing as well as credit. Thus, the ASDP will integrate a policy loan with targeted policy\nactions, and an investment loan providing support in the two main problem areas.\n\nB.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n70.\nThe  sector  goals  are  to  develop  a  more  market-oriented,  efficient,  and  sustainable\nagriculture sector and reduce poverty by providing increased income opportunities. The specific\npurpose  is  to  increase  productivity  and  profitability  of  agricultural  producers.  The  primary\nstrategic  development  objective  is  economic  growth,  and  the  secondary  objective  is  poverty\nreduction. The ASDP will include both direct and indirect poverty interventions, and poor people\nare  expected  to  comprise  at  least  one  third  of  the  beneficiaries.  The  emphasis  on  poverty\nreduction  is  in  line  with  the  COS  for  Mongolia,  the  Partnership  Agreement,  and  the\nGovernment's Action Plan.\n\n71.\nThe  ASDP  comprises  a  policy  reform  agenda  with  seven  policy  areas,  and  the\ninvestment  Project  with  three  components.  Associated  with  the  ASDP  will  be  TA  for  Capacity\nBuilding in Agriculture.\n\nC.\n\nPolicy Framework and Actions\n\n72.\nThe  policy  reform  agenda  is  designed  as  a  follow-up  loan  to  the  ASP.  With  the  broad\nframework  for  market-based  development  of  agriculture  in  place,  the  policy  loan  will  support\nsecond  generation  reforms  to  deepen,  refine,  and  more  effectively  implement  the  policy  and\nlegal framework for agriculture. The emphasis is on focusing Government activities on providing\nessential support services, and creating a favorable environment for the private sector to more\neffectively undertake functions that previously were carried out by the state, including the supply\nof inputs, the processing and marketing of outputs, and the provision of financial services.\n\n73.\nThe  program  of  policy  reforms  is  in  line  with  the  Government's  Action  Plan  adopted  in\nSeptember  2000,  and  will  support  several  of  the  Government's  planned  initiatives.  It  is  also\nclosely linked to the investment components of the ASDP, and geared to bring about the stated\nsector  goals  and  create  the  institutional,  financial,  and  regulatory  conditions  necessary  to\nsuccessfully implement the ASDP and sustain the improvements thus gained. The development\npolicy letter setting forth the policy framework and the policy matrix is in Appendix 4. The policy\nprogram will provide support for the following.\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\nReduce price and other distortions to improve resource allocation and efficiency\nin  the  agriculture  sector.  Related  policy  actions  include  facilitating  growth  of\nagricultural exports, minimizing the influence of procurement and sale activities of\nGovernment  agencies  on  market  prices,  and  making  more  efficient  use  of\nfinancial resources arising from the sale of commodity aid.\n\nPromote  competitive  markets  for  agricultural  inputs,  outputs,  and  processed\ngoods.  Related  policy  actions  focus  on  completing  the  privatization  process  of\ncrop  farms,  achieving  operational  and  financial  autonomy  for  enterprises\n\n\f18\n\nremaining  in  the  public  sector  such  as  Biokombinat,  which  produces  livestock\nvaccines,  and  implementing  all  provisions  of  the  Cooperative  Law  and  the\nCooperative Development Program.\n\nEnsure  the  delivery  of  financial  services  and  provide  improved  access  to  credit\nfor the rural population. Related policy actions relate to restoring the Agricultural\nBank, which has the largest network of rural branches, as a commercially viable\nentity.\n\nRationalize  tax  incentives  to  promote  investment  in  rural  areas.  Related  policy\nactions  include  exempting  primary  producers  rather  than  products  from  value-\nadded  tax,  providing  the  legal  framework  for  agricultural  equipment  leasing,\nrationalizing  the  tax  structure  for  cooperatives,  and  preparing  an  action  plan  to\npromote investments in disadvantaged rural areas.\n\nImprove productivity and sustainability in extensive livestock production. Related\npolicy actions comprise rationalizing the public and private sector responsibilities\nin the control of animal diseases, ensuring minimum standards for meat hygiene\nservices,  maintaining  professional  standards  of  veterinary  practitioners,\nimproving pasture land use and management, and providing for more sustainable\nrehabilitation of stock-watering wells.\n\nStrengthen  agricultural  research  and  extension  to  support  private  sector\nagriculture. Related policy actions comprise making research more responsive to\nthe  demands  of  producers  and  processors,  and  providing  technical  advice  and\nbusiness development support.\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\n(v)\n\n(vi)\n\n(vii) Mitigate  risks  in  agriculture  and  ensure  food  security,  income,  and  employment\nfor  vulnerable  groups.  Related  policy  actions  include  adopting  a  policy  on  risk\nmanagement in agriculture, improving the provision of agricultural insurance, and\nreorienting  the  Government's  Green  Revolution  Program  to  stimulate  vegetable\nand  potato  production  among  vulnerable  households.  These  policy  actions  will\nspecifically help to mitigate the impacts of future natural disasters.\n\nD. \n\nCapacity Building\n\nAssistance  in  the  areas  of  advice,  training,  and  capacity  building  is  an  integral  part  of\n74.\neach of the components of the investment Project to improve institutional capacity of agricultural\nagencies and ensure effective project implementation. Capacity building activities are discussed\nin detail in paras. 80-103. The TA associated with the ASDP also focuses on capacity building.\n\nE.\n\nThe Investment Project\n\n1.\n\nProject Description\n\n75.\nLinked closely to these policy reforms, the investment Project will focus on delivering an\nintegrated  package  of  critical  support  services  to  improve  productivity  and  profitability  in  the\nagriculture  sector.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  five  years,  and  include  three\ncomponents: (i) production and marketing support, (ii) credit, and (iii) project management. The\ndesign  of  the  components  has  also  been  guided  by  the  need  for  medium-  to  longer-term\nmeasures  to  help  reduce  the  vulnerability  of  the  agriculture  sector  to  natural  disasters  (paras.\n51-52).\n\n\f19\n\nThe  activities  of  the  three  components  will  focus  on  four  provinces  in  the  relatively\n76.\nremote  and  poor  western  part  of  Mongolia:  Dzavhan,  Hovd,  Gobialtay,  and  Urs.  The  credit\ncomponent  will  also  cover  the  north-central  provinces  of  Darhan-Uul  and  Selenge,  which\ncomprise the country's most important wheat producing area. An overview of the six provinces\nis in Appendix 5.\n\n77.\nThe  four  western  provinces  comprise  about  a  quarter  of  the  country's  land  area  and\nlivestock, and 15 percent of the population. Due to the arid nature of the environment, the most\nimportant  agricultural  activity  is  extensive  livestock  production.  Crop  and  fodder  production\ndeclined  drastically  during  the  1990s.  Only  vegetable  production  is  now  higher  than  in  the\npretransition  period  (except  in  Dzavhan).  During  the  livestock  disaster  in  the  winter  of\n1999/2000, Urs and Dzavhan were the third and fourth most affected provinces in the country,\nwhile Hovd and Gobialtay were relatively little affected.\n\n78.\nThe standard of living in the four western provinces is generally lower than in the more\ncentrally  located  provinces.  Three  of  the  four  western  provinces  are  among  the  poorest\nprovinces in Mongolia, with Hovd being the second, Dzavhan the third, and Urs the fifth poorest.\nAccording  to  the  Government's  income-based  poverty  line,  the  population  living  below  the\nminimum  standard  level  in  these  three  provinces  in  1998  was  43  percent,  41  percent,  and  34\npercent  (the  national  average  was  26  percent).  A  main  reason  for  the  large  number  of  poor\npeople in the three provinces is the high percentage of households with small herds. Although\ntheir  number  is  declining,  in  1999  more  than  half  of  all  households  with  animals  in  Hovd,\nDzavhan, and Urs had less than 100 animals. By contrast, in Gobialtay, where 16 percent of the\npeople were living below the poverty line, less than 40 percent of the households with livestock\nhad less than 100 animals.\n\n79.\nThe  credit  component  will  cover  the  four  western  provinces  and  two  north-central\nprovinces: Darhan-Uul and Selenge. The extension of the credit component to Darhan-Uul and\nSelenge  will,  among  others,  facilitate  increased  wheat  production  and  productivity  in  the\ncountry's major wheat-producing area. The low level of wheat production and the continuing rise\nof flour and wheat imports to supply domestic demand have led to growing Government concern\nabout  food  security.  However,  the  credit  component  in  Darhan-Uul  and  Selenge  will  not  be\nlimited to wheat farmers. A summary of the three project components follows.\n\na.\n\nProduction and Marketing Support Component\n\n80.\nThe production and marketing support component includes assistance for (i) expanding\nsmall-scale  horticulture  production  among  vulnerable  groups  under  the  Green  Revolution\nProgram;  (ii)  strengthening  veterinary  services;  (iii)  rehabilitating  wells;  (iv)  developing  the\ncooperative  system  to  provide  better  marketing  and  processing  services  to  agricultural\nproducers;  and  (v)  improving  rural  communication  channels,  including  telephone  and  radio\nservices.\n\ni.\n\nGreen Revolution Program\n\n81.\nThe  Project  will  strengthen  and  reorient  MFA's  Green  Revolution  Program  in  the  four\nwestern provinces. Advice will be provided not only on the production of a few vegetables but\nalso  on  other  horticultural  products,  as  well  as  on  opportunities  for  storage,  processing,  and\nmarketing. The subcomponent will focus on vulnerable groups, including households headed by\nwomen and the unemployed in the provincial and district centers, households with small herds\nthat graze around these centers, as well as households affected by the livestock disaster during\n\n\f20\n\nthe  winter  of  1999/2000.  The  promotion  of  horticultural  activities  will  enable  these  groups  to\nimprove their food security and diversify incomes by marketing their surplus produce.\n\n82.\nAt  the  national  level,  support  will  be  provided  for  workshops  for  provincial  Green\nRevolution representatives and for preparing more information material and advice in the areas\nof horticulture, marketing and processing, and business practices for dissemination at the local\nlevel.  At  the  provincial  level,  funds  will  be  provided  for  the  enhancement  of  the  agroparks,\ntraining  for  district  agronomists,  workshops,  involvement  of  NGOs  in  market  surveys  and\nadvisory services, and various promotional activities such as agricultural shows. Assistance will\nalso be provided to send farmers to see successful ventures in other districts, and to experiment\nwith  new  crops.  Provincial  green  revolution  committees  will  have  small  funds  to  execute\nminiprojects,  such  as  the  provision  of  seed,  and  to  experiment  with  new  crops  and  irrigation\nmethods.  At  the  district  level,  additional  agroparks  will  be  set  up  to  provide  on-farm\ndemonstrations  and  advice,  and  training  to  farmers.  These  interventions  are  expected  to\nincrease horticulture production in the four western provinces by 10 percent at the end of year\nfive.\n\nii.\n\nVeterinary Services\n\n83.\nThis  subcomponent  will  help  to  prevent  increasing  losses  from  animal  disease,  and  to\nmeet the requirements of potential livestock and meat importing countries. Veterinary services\nprovided  by  the  public  and  private  sectors  will  be  strengthened  to  enable  them  to  fulfil  their\nrespective roles.\n\nMeat hygiene standards will be improved by providing training on international standards\n84.\nto  a  core  of  meat  inspectors  who  supervise  production  for  export  at  abattoirs  and  meat\nprocessing  plants.  The  Project  will  intensively  train  two  veterinary  inspectors  of  the  Veterinary\nInspection  Agency  of  MFA  on  international  standards  of  meat  inspection.  In  turn  they  will\nbecome trainers of about 24 veterinarians from both the Veterinary Inspection Agency and the\nprivate sector who will then be licensed to conduct their responsibilities. In line with international\npractice,  the  remuneration  of  these  trained  inspectors  will  be  covered  by  levying  a  service\ncharge on export products.\n\n85.\nTo  enhance  animal  disease  surveillance,  improve  diagnostic  capability,  and  prepare\ncost-effective  disease  control  plans,  the  Veterinary  Epidemiology  Unit  in  the  Veterinary\nImplementing  Agency  of  MFA,  the  Central  Veterinary  Laboratory,  and  the  laboratories  in  the\nfour western provinces will be supported. Veterinarians in each district will be trained in disease\ndiagnosis.  The  results  of  these  surveys  will  allow  a  more  rational  selection  of  diseases  to  be\ncontrolled  by  the  public  sector,  and  those  causing  private  losses  to  be  relinquished  to  private\nresponsibility.  This  will  contribute  to  an  improved  design  of  the  Government's  support  to\nveterinary services.\n\n86.\nThe  emerging  private  veterinary  sector  will  receive  training  in  animal  husbandry,  field\ndiagnostics, clinical treatment, and business management through part-time use of staff of the\nFaculty of Veterinary Science at the State University of Agriculture with the collaboration of the\nveterinary implementing agency. Faculty staff will include those with experience gained from the\nGTZ  and  US-funded  Agriculture  Cooperative  Development  International/Volunteers  Overseas\nfor  Cooperative  Assistance  (ACDI/VOCA)  projects,  which  are  providing  limited  support  in  this\narea.  During  the  project  period  three  training  courses  will  be  held  in  each  of  the  four  western\nprovinces to improve the skills of about 240 veterinarians. Private veterinarians will be able to\nborrow  from  PFIs  to  enable  them  to  have  sufficient  stocks  of  pharmaceuticals  to  support  their\npractices and to sell to herders.\n\n\f21\n\nFinally, support will be given to the consultative process and changes in procedures and\n87.\nlegislation necessary to establish a regulatory body (board of veterinarians) responsible for the\naccreditation, registration, and discipline of all veterinarians and paraveterinarians. The services\nwill be conducted from the veterinary implementing agency until the first register is produced. At\nthat stage the board is expected to become a self-regulatory body, recovering cost through an\nannual retention fee paid by the members.\n\niii.\n\nWell Rehabilitation\n\n88.\nBy  1995,  about  1,900  wells,  or  40  percent  of  the  wells  that  were  available  for  the\nwatering  of  livestock  and  supply  of  drinking  water  in  the  four  western  provinces  in  1989,  had\nfallen  into  disrepair.  The  number  is  estimated  to  be  even  larger  today.  Most  affected  are  the\nmedium  and  deep  wells,  which  usually  consist  of  an  electrical  pump  powered  by  a  diesel\nengine. To address the substantial need for an increased number of stock-watering points, the\nsubcomponent,  in  close  coordination  with  MFA's  well  rehabilitation  program  and  the  TA  on\npasture management (paras. 143-146), will support the rehabilitation of about 400 wells in the\nfour  western  provinces.  Since  nonoperational  wells  tend  to  be  in  varying  condition,  their\nrehabilitation requirements may range from a few spare parts to the installment of new pumps\nand  engines.  Average  well  repair  costs  are  estimated  at  $2,000.  Domestic  and  international\nexperts  in  close  cooperation  with  herder  communities  and  local  governments  will  assist  in\nprioritizing  the  wells  to  be  rehabilitated  taking  into  account  both  drinking  water  and  livestock\nwatering  needs,  and  in  determining  the  most  suitable  and  cost-effective  way  of  well\nrehabilitation.  Factors  to  be  considered  include  the  ownership/possession  of  the  well,  the\nintended users and use patterns, the technical aspects, and the herders' willingness and ability\nto pay water user fees to cover operation and maintenance costs. The well rehabilitation work\nwill be contracted out to provincial water supply boards or, in provinces where the boards have\nbeen  privatized,  to  water  supply  companies.  The  herders  intending  to  use  a  rehabilitated  well\nwill receive training, and contracts will be made with groups of herders or individuals assigning\nresponsibility for well operation and maintenance, and collection of user fees.\n\n89. Well rehabilitation will start in the second year of project implementation. During the first\nyear  a  mechanism  for  at  least  partially  recovering  well  rehabilitation  costs  will  be  developed.\nSuch mechanism may include the establishment of a well rehabilitation fund to be administered\nby a financial institution, which would be responsible for recovering a certain percentage of the\ncost. The recovered funds could be used to expand the well rehabilitation program.\n\niv.\n\nCooperative Development\n\n90.\nIn  close  cooperation  with  GTZ  and  the  attached  TA  on  cooperative  training,  the\nsubcomponent will provide extensive training and strengthen the capacity and competitiveness\nof  the  cooperative  system  in  the  provision  of  marketing  and  other  services  to  their  members.\nThe  activities  will  be  carried  out  at  the  national  level  and  in  the  four  western  provinces.\nCooperative  representatives  of  other  provinces  may  join  activities  in  Ulaanbaatar  or  at  the\nprovincial level. Assistance will be provided to cooperative advisory staff, trained under the TA,\nto train members of cooperatives and people interested in forming cooperatives at the National\nCooperative  Training  Center  (100  courses  for  about  2,000  persons)  and  at  provincial\ncooperative training centers (240 courses for about 6,000 persons). Training will include advice\non how to improve existing cooperatives and create new ones, how to formulate business plans,\nand how to establish banking relationships. Since close external supervision and monitoring has\nproved vital for the success of the cooperative movement in many countries, the subcomponent\nwill  initially  also  support  consulting  and  auditing  services  provided  to  cooperatives  by\n\n\f22\n\ncooperative advisory staff. Cost recovery will be gradually introduced by requiring the benefiting\ncooperatives to pay for these services.\n\n91.\nSince  many  cooperative  members  feel  that  their  cooperative  is  too  small  to  effectively\ncompete  with  private  traders,  discussions  are  now  taking  place  on  establishing  secondary\ncooperatives.  Secondary  cooperatives  are  groups  of  several  (primary)  cooperatives  set  up  to\nconduct  joint  business  activities,  such  as  processing  and  marketing.  Starting  from  the  second\nyear of project implementation, the subcomponent will promote and assist in the setup of about\nnine secondary cooperatives in the western provinces. This will include establishing small-scale\nprocessing and marketing facilities that will help cooperative members market agricultural raw,\ngraded, and partly processed materials, and purchase inputs at more favorable prices. The by-\nlaws of the newly established secondary cooperatives will require them to repay at least part of\nthe  costs  of  the  provided  facilities  with  the  profits  generated.  During  the  first  year  of  project\nimplementation,  mechanisms  for  cost  recovery  will  be  developed,  including  provisions  with\nrespect to the percentage of funds to be recovered from the secondary cooperatives, the period\nover  which  such  recovery  is  to  take  place,  the  use  of  recovered  funds  to  establish  additional\nsecondary  cooperatives,  the  possible  involvement  of  a  financial  institution  to  administer  the\nprovision and recovery of funds provided to secondary cooperatives, and the fees to be paid to\nthe  financial  institution.  To  improve  market  information  and  market  power  of  primary  and\nsecondary  cooperatives,  the  subcomponent  will  also  help  establish  a  cooperative  wholesale\ncenter at the national level that will benefit the cooperative movement nationwide. More than a\nthird  of  the  total  cost  of  this  subcomponent  will  be  borne  by  the  cooperatives  and  their\nassociations.\n\nv.\n\nRural Communication Links\n\n92.\nUnder  central  planning  the  rural  population  in  the  four  western  provinces  was  able  to\nreceive  a  national  and  usually  a  provincial  radio  program  through  transmitter  stations  in\nGobialtay or neighboring provinces. However, with the closure of some transmitter stations and\noutdated  technology  of  others,  the  people  in  Dzavhan,  Hovd,  and  Urs,  (except  those  living  in\nprovincial  capitals)  are  now  unable  to  receive  radio  programs.  In  Gobialtay  the  provincial\ntransmitter  station,  which  used  to  service  a  large  part  of  the  western  region,  is  now  only\nproviding a local frequency. It is operating at 50 percent of its capacity but consumes more than\n10  percent  of  the  provincial  electricity  requirements.  Thus  the  rural  population  in  three  of  the\nfour  western  provinces  have  practically  no  access  to  media  even  though  most  herder\nhouseholds  own  a  radio.  According  to  the  Ministry  of  Infrastructure  (MOI),  it  is  more  cost-\neffective  in  the  medium  to  longer  term  to  establish  new  transmitter  stations  in  each  of  these\nprovinces, than to provide for the operating cost of running the Gobialtay station at 100 percent\nof its capacity.\n\nThe  subcomponent  will  therefore  assist  in  setting  up  transmitter  stations  in  Dzavhan,\n93.\nHovd,  and  Urs,  which  will  allow  the  transmission  of  signals  from  the  central  radio  station  in\nUlaanbaatar,  and  the  airing  of  provincial  radio  programs.  Small  studios  for  the  production  of\nprovincial  programs  will  be  established  in  the  two  provinces  that  do  not  have  a  studio.  The\nproduction of provincial programs will be supported initially. They will include market information\nfor  producers  and  processors,  advice  related  to  agricultural  production  and  support  services,\nweather reports, news on project activities, and other information. People with skills in managing\nthe  studios  are  available  in  the  provinces.  The  operating  costs  for  radio  programming  will\ngradually  be  covered  by  advertisements.  MOI,  through  the  state-owned  Radio  and  Television\n\n\f23\n\nCompany, will arrange the bidding for the procurement of the new transmitter stations, and be\nresponsible for their operation and maintenance cost.19\n\n94.\nThe  Government  is  currently  changing  the  telephone  connections  from  the  provincial\ncapitals  to  Ulaanbaatar  from  analog  to  digital  systems.  This  will  allow  provincial  governments\nand  citizens  in  the  provincial  capitals  to  connect  to  the  Internet.  No  significant  technical\nimprovements  are  planned  in  the  medium  term  for  the  telephone  connections  between  district\ncenters and provincial capitals. Below the district level, few telephone connections are available.\nA  number  of  district  centers,  especially  those  in  remote  areas,  have  difficulty  establishing\ntelephone  connections  to  their  respective  provincial  capitals.  To  remedy  this  situation  and  to\nhelp  improve  the  communication  channels  between  district  and  provincial  governments,  the\nsubcomponent  will  also  provide  for  the  upgrading  of  some  of  the  telephone  connections  from\ndistricts  to  provincial  capitals.  Improved  communication  channels  will  not  only  facilitate  project\nimplementation,  but  also  stimulate  economic  activity  by  providing  advice  and  the  timely\ndissemination  of  vital  information  to  and  from  rural  areas.  The  Post  and  Telecommunication\nAuthority, an implementing agency of MOI, will be responsible for providing the upgrading.\n\nb.\n\nCredit Component\n\n95.\nThe credit component comprises (i) a credit line for PFIs in the four western and the two\nnorth-central  provinces  to  increase  the  availability  of  credit  for  agricultural  purposes,  and  (ii)\ncapacity building for PFI staff and advice for potential subborrowers. The credit line for PFIs will\nprovide  subloans,  initially  up  to  one  year,  for  agriculture-related  activities.20  The  capacity\nbuilding  activities  are  based  on  the  experience  of  the  ADB-financed  Employment  Generation\nProject,21 which showed that, even in times of banking difficulties, adequate advice to PFIs and\nsubborrowers can help to improve loan quality and significantly increase repayment rates.\n\ni.\n\nCredit Line\n\n96.\nBanking  and  financial  sector  problems  have  resulted  in  limited  financial  services  being\navailable outside the major urban areas of Mongolia. The subcomponent aims to address this\nsituation by making a credit line of $5.5 million equivalent available for PFIs in the six provinces.\nADB  will  finance  $4.4  million  equivalent,  and  the  PFIs  will  be  required  to  contribute  the\nremaining $1.1 million equivalent, or 20 percent of the credit line, from their own resources. To\navail  of  this  credit,  financial  institutions,  including  commercial  banks  and  nonbank  financial\ninstitutions (NBFIs), will have to meet certain eligibility criteria as described in Appendix 6. The\ncriteria  include  that  PFIs  should  have  a  rural  branch  network  and  BOM  approval  to  lend  in  at\nleast  one  of  the  six  provinces,  be  financially  sound  and  meet  BOM's  prudential  requirements,\nhave an acceptable record of lending to the agriculture sector, and have adequate staff for the\nprudent management of project funds. The financial institutions that may meet these criteria are\nthe Agricultural Bank, Post Bank, ZOOS Bank, and Erel Bank, and one NBFI, Credit Mongol.\n\n97.\nThe  Agricultural  Bank  has  branches  in  the  provincial  capitals  of  Darhan-Uul,  Dzavhan,\nUrs,  and  Gobialtay,  and  subbranches  in  most  of  the  district  centers.  The  bank  plans  to  start\nagain  with  lending  activities  toward  the  end  of  2000,  initially  with  relatively  small  loans  up  to\nMNT1 million and with terms up to 6 months. The Post Bank has branches in the capitals of all\n                                                          \n19 MOI  indicated  that  the  provincial  broadcasting  network,  including  in  Dzavhan,  Hovd,  and  Urs,  may  be  expanded\nwith the assistance of another funding agency. In this case, the costs allocated for the provision of three transmitter\nstations would be reallocated to upgrade provincial telephone connections.\n\n20 The  Rural  Finance  Project  planned  for  2001  will  address  the  broader  issues  for  expanding  the  availability  of\n\nfinancial services in rural areas, including the promotion of nonbank financial institutions.\n\n21 Loan 1290-MON: Employment Generation, for $3.0 million, approved 16 December 1993. The project completion\n\nreport was submitted to the Board on 30 June 2000.\n\n\f24\n\nsix provinces, and subbranches in most of the districts in Hovd and Selenge. Toward the end of\n2000,  the  Post  Bank  plans  to  start  lending  from  its  rural  branches  in  selected  provinces,\nincluding Dzavhan, Hovd, and Selenge, with loans up to MNT5 million. The ZOOS Bank, Erel\nBank, and Credit Mongol have branches in at least one of the six provinces, and are currently\nlending to rural clients, mostly to agricultural marketing and processing companies. On average,\nthese  financial  institutions  provide  short-term  loans  amounting  to  MNT5  million  to  MNT15\nmillion. Their experience with repayment has been good.\n\n98.\nIn the absence of an adequate benchmark, the interest for loans from the Government to\nthe  PFIs  will  be  determined  on  the  basis  of  a  formula  that  includes  allowances  for  the  cost  of\nfunds, administrative costs, exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations, and inflation. Currently\nthis implies a rate of 10 percent per year, which is in line with the cost of funds to commercial\nbanks.  The  subloans  will  be  denominated  in  togrog,  and  interest  rates  will  be  market\ndetermined. The current interest rates charged by commercial banks for loans denominated in\ntogrog range between 2.5 and 5.0 percent per month, and have been recently declining. Many\nof the cultivators, herders, and cooperative members have indicated that access to credit with a\nreliable financial institution was more important to them than a low interest rate.\n\n99.\nThe maturity of loans to the PFIs will initially not exceed one year; they will be equivalent\nto the maximum term of subloans to subborrowers. The PFIs will bear the risk of their onlending\ndecisions,  and  will  assume  responsibility  for  setting  interest  rates  and  terms  and  conditions  of\nthe subloans. Since the focus of the credit component is on improving access to credit for the\nagriculture  sector,  subloans  will  be  provided  for  activities  that  are  primarily  agriculture  related\nand  primarily  based  in  one  of  the  six  provinces.  The  criteria  for  selecting  subborrowers  are\ndescribed in Appendix 6.\n\nii.\n\nCapacity Building for PFIs and Subborrowers\n\n100. Most banks and NBFIs do not have much lending experience in the agriculture sector,\nexcept  to  some  larger  marketing  and  processing  enterprises.  While  some  in-house  training  is\nbeing conducted in several of the banks and NBFIs, it has not focused on serving agricultural\nclientele,  especially  small-  and  medium-size  agricultural  producers  and  processors,  and\ncooperatives.  Similarly,  the  majority  of  the  rural  population  has  experience  only  with  a  very\nlimited  range  of  financial  services  and  is  interested  in  learning  more  about  intensifying\nrelationships  with  financial  institutions  and  benefiting  from  improved  savings  and  credit\nopportunities.\n\n101.\nThe subcomponent on capacity building will therefore help strengthen lending operations\nin  the  PFIs'  branches  in  the  six  provinces.  This  will  include  the  organization  of  training  at  the\nBankers Training Institute22 in Ulaanbaatar (two courses with about 50 participants). But most of\nthe  training  will  be  conducted  at  the  provincial  level  for  the  relevant  provincial  PFI  staff.  The\ntraining  will  incorporate  issues  related  to  the  internal  requirements  of  the  PFIs,  but  will  mainly\nfocus on serving the needs of potential subborrowers in the agriculture sector. During the first\nthree years, the subcomponent will support a sequence of 12 courses in each provincial capital,\neach for about 35 staff of branches and subbranches involved in credit operations (courses for\nDarhan-Uul  and  Selenge  will  be  organized  and  executed  jointly).  The  courses  will  include\nmethods for identifying potential agricultural subborrowers and maintaining relations; minimum\nstandards  for  loan  applications  and  business  plans;  loan  appraisals;  administration  of  loans;\nlending  operations  and  savings  mobilization;  cooperation  between\nlinkages  between \nsubbranches,  branches,  and  head  offices;  and  performance  evaluations  of  credit  officers.  The\n                                                          \n22 The  Bankers  Training  Institute  was  established  under  Loan  1510-MON:  Upgrading  Skills  and  Systems  of\n\nCommercial Banks, for $3.0 million, approved on 16 December 1996.\n\n\f25\n\nsubcomponent  will  provide  for  an  international  and  five  domestic  rural  credit  experts  (one  for\neach  of  the  four  western  provinces  and  one  for  the  two  north-central  provinces)  who  in  close\ncooperation  with  the  commercial  banks  and  NBFIs  will  supervise  the  training,  and  provide\nfollow-up and additional on-the-job training for the participants.\n\nThe Project will also offer training and advisory services to potential subborrowers in the\n102.\nsix  provinces  to  identify  viable  business  opportunities,  prepare  business  plans,  apply  for\nsubloans, and effective use of financial resources. Since such services have not been available\nin  rural  areas,  the  rural  credit  experts  will  carry  out  a  training  needs  analysis  and  design  a\ncurriculum for training courses. Course provision will be subcontracted to local service providers\nor  NGOs.  PFI  staff  from  branches  and  subbranches  will  provide  input  to  the  training  courses.\nThe attendance of a training course will be a prerequisite for a subborrower's loan application.\nThe  selected  service  providers  will  receive  a  setup  allowance  to  upgrade  basic  facilities  and\nphysical  infrastructure,  and  a  fee  for  services  provided.  Starting  in  the  third  year  of  project\nimplementation, potential subborrowers will be expected to pay for the services. About 10,000\npotential subborrowers will be trained under the subcomponent\n\nc.\n\nProject Management Component\n\n103.\nThe component will support the efficient management of project activities at the national\nand provincial levels. At the national level, a project management unit (PMU) within MFA will be\nresponsible for overall project coordination and implementation. The day-to-day implementation\nof  activities  will  be  supervised  by  project  implementation  units  (PIUs)  established  in  the\nprovincial governments of the four western provinces. The project management component will\nprovide  training  and  equipment  to  assist  in  setting  up  and  operating  the  PMU  and  PIUs.  The\ncomponent  will  also  cover  a  PMU  director,  an  implementation  officer,  an  accountant,  a\nprocurement officer (for procurement and office management), and a driver in the PMU; and a\nPIU  director,  an \nimplementation  officer,  an  office  assistant  (procurement  and  office\nmanagement),  and  a  driver  in  each  of  the  PIUs.  In  addition,  the  component  will  fund  an\ninternational project adviser attached to the PMU. Activities will be supported at the national and\nprovincial levels to improve monitoring and evaluation systems for project implementation, and\nfor agricultural purposes in general.\n\n2.\n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan\n\n104.\nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  $13.1  million  equivalent.  The  foreign  exchange  cost  is\n$6.6 million equivalent, and the local currency cost $6.4 million equivalent. The proposed ADB\nloan of $10.0 million equivalent, denominated in Special Drawing Rights, will finance about 77\npercent  of  the  total  Project  cost,  covering  90  percent  of  direct  and  indirect  foreign  exchange\ncost, and 63 percent ($4.0 million equivalent) of the local currency costs. Of the remaining $3.1\nmillion equivalent of Project costs (24 percent of the total), $1.3 million equivalent will be funded\nby  the  national  and  provincial  governments.  In  addition,  the  PFIs  will  provide  contributions  of\n$1.2 million equivalent, and cooperatives $0.6 million equivalent. Tables 1 and 2 summarize the\ncost  estimates  and  financing  plan.  Details  are  presented  in  Appendix  7  and  Supplementary\nAppendix  C.\n\n105.\nThe  proposed  level  of  ADB  financing,  including  63  percent  of  the  total  local  currency\ncost, is considered reasonable. Mongolia continues to face economic uncertainties and budget\npressures.  The  proposed  level  of  ADB  financing  is  also  justified  considering  the  Project's\nemphasis on poverty reduction, and capacity building at national and local levels.\n\n\f26\n\nTable 1: Summary of Project Cost Estimates\n($ \u2018000 equivalent)\n\nItem\n\nA.

Support\nfor  the  Green  Revolution  Program  will  directly  address  the  needs  of  vulnerable  groups  in  the\nprovincial and district centers, where unemployment is high. The provision of training, access to\ntechnical  knowledge, \nincome-generating\nopportunities  in  horticulture  production,  as  well  as  in  agroprocessing,  which  will  help  diversify\nincome sources and extend opportunities beyond the short growing season. Women, who have\nbeen shown to be the first to take up horticultural and small-scale agroprocessing activities, and\ntheir households will be the principal beneficiaries in terms of improved nutrition and income.\n\ninformation  will  open  up \n\ninputs,  and  market \n\n\f27\n\n107. Support for private veterinarians will be of direct benefit to herder households with small\nherds by providing improved access to veterinary care and general animal production advice, as\nveterinarians  broaden  their  expertise.  This  will  improve  the  animal  health  situation  and  thus\nincrease herd productivity. The assistance for veterinary epidemiology and disease surveillance\nwill  strengthen  vaccination  programs  to  the  benefit  of  animal  owners,  while  investment  in  the\nquality of inspection at abattoirs and meat processing plants will contribute towards opening up\nmarkets for meat exports, leading to increased off-take and better prices for herder households.\n\n108. Support for cooperative development and associated marketing infrastructure under the\ninvestment Project will strengthen the productive capacity and bargaining power of households\nwith small herds who are some of the poorest people in the country. Cooperative development\nis an area with great potential for directly raising herder households' incomes by increasing their\nshare of market price and value added.\n\n109.\nThe capacity building for staff of PFIs in rural areas and for potential subborrowers, as\nwell  as  the  provision  of  a  credit  line  will  facilitate  the  access  of  agricultural  producers,\ncooperatives, and small- and medium-sized enterprises to credit, initially for up to one year. The\nsubloans  are  expected  to  mainly  help  finance  the  additional  inputs  necessary  for  improving\nproductivity and incomes in the extensive livestock and crop subsectors, and the working capital\nneeded by cooperatives to get more involved in marketing and processing activities. Vulnerable\ngroups  are  most  likely  to  benefit  from  the  improved  credit  availability  as  members  of\ncooperatives. By helping to establish relationships of rural households with financial institutions,\ntheir savings will gradually be mobilized, making them less dependent on livestock as a means\nof saving and, as a result, less vulnerable to natural disasters.\n\n110.\nThe  extension  of  the  credit  component  to  the  north-central  region  will  enable  wheat\nfarmers to buy more inputs and increase output and productivity. This will help to strengthen the\nnational  food  security  situation  with  respect  to  wheat  which  is  the  principal  staple  food.  By\nsupporting  the  Government's  food  security  goals  and  emergency  stock  management,  this  will\nalso safeguard the purchasing capacity of the poor in urban areas.\n\n2.\n\nEnvironmental Analysis\n\n111. Environmental  implications  of  both  the  ASDP  policy  reforms  and  the  investment\ncomponents  were  reviewed.  An  assessment  of  the  anticipated  environmental  impact  of  the\npolicy measures is provided in Supplementary Appendix D. No significant negative effects were\nidentified.  Positive  environmental  impacts  are  anticipated  from  a  more  efficient  allocation  of\nresources, and improved support services, which will contribute to sustainable grazing systems.\n\n112. An  initial  environmental  assessment  was  undertaken  for  the  components  under  the\ninvestment  Project.  The  summary  initial  environmental  examination  is  in  Supplementary\nAppendix  E.  None  of  the  activities  is  expected  to  have  a  significant  adverse  impact  on  the\nenvironment.  Some  will  have  a  positive  impact,  including  well  rehabilitation,  which  is  closely\nlinked with the TA on sustainable pasture management. This will help reduce livestock pressure\non overgrazed pastures and allow herder households to relocate to more favorable areas made\navailable  because  of  improved  stock-watering  facilities.  Improved  marketing  resulting  from\ncooperative  development  and  better  communication  links,  and  improved  livestock  health\nresulting from strengthened veterinary services and better water supplies will contribute to the\ndevelopment of a more market-oriented, efficient, and sustainable agriculture sector. In addition,\nincentives  will  be  provided  for  herder  households  to  substitute  their  current  strategy  of\nmaximizing  the  size  of  their  herds  with  a  strategy  for  improving  the  quality  and  productivity  of\ntheir animals and raw materials output.\n\n\f28\n\nV.\n\nTHE PROPOSED LOANS\n\nA.\n\nThe Policy Loan\n\n1.\n\nAmount of Loan, Terms, and Source of Funds\n\n113.\nThe proposed ADB loan is for $7.0 million equivalent, denominated in Special Drawing\nRights,  from  the  Special  Funds  resources,  and  will  support  the  ASDP  policy  program.  The\nBorrower will be Mongolia. The loan will have a maturity of 24 years, including a grace period of\n8  years.  The  interest  charge  during  the  grace  period  will  be  1  percent  per  annum,  and  1.5\npercent  per  annum  thereafter.  The  loan  is  expected  to  be  used  over  48  months  commencing\nfrom the date of loan effectiveness.\n\nThe  amount  of  the  policy  loan  was  determined  on  the  basis  of  the  costs  of  structural\n114.\nreforms under the ASDP. These are estimated at $8.0 million over the next four years, and will\nprimarily  result  from  the  following  policy  measures:  (i)  preparation  and  implementation  of    the\nplan  to  achieve  operational  and  financial  autonomy  for  Biokombinat  ($0.4  million),  (ii)\nimplementation  of  the  Cooperative  Law  and  Cooperative  Development  Program  ($0.3  million\nannually),  (iii)  implementation  of  an  action  plan  to  promote  investment  in  disadvantaged  rural\nareas ($0.4 million annually), (iv) control of animal diseases that are public health hazards ($0.3\nmillion  annually),  (v)  establishment  and  operation  of  a  licensing  system  for  veterinarians\nsupervising  meat  hygiene  and  production  ($0.1  million  annually),  (vi)  operations  of  the\nsecretariat  to  maintain  the  register  for  veterinarians  and  paraveterinarians  ($5,000  annually),\n(vii) implementation of pilot programs for improved pasture management ($0.4 million annually),\nthe  Science  and  Technology  Council  ($4,000  annually),  and  (vi)\n(viii)  operation  of \nimplementation of a medium-term plan for extension ($0.4 million annually). Implementation of\nthe policy on risk management will also involve significant costs.\n\nThe overall revenue impact of the reforms of the tax regime is expected to be close to\n115.\nneutral:  the  change  from  an  exemption  from  the  value-added  tax  for  agricultural  primary  raw\nmaterials  to  an  exemption  for  primary  producers,  with  primary  producers  being  permitted  to\nregister on a voluntary basis, is estimated to have a negative impact; the replacement of the 50\npercent  exemption  from  income  tax  for  crop  farms  with  an  accelerated  depreciation  or\ninvestment  tax  credits  is  estimated  to  have  a  positive  impact;  and  the  tax  exemption  of\ncooperatives'  reserve  funds,  patronage  refunds,  and  cooperative  dividends  on  equity  is\nestimated  to  have  a  negative  impact.  Increased  costs  of  the  structural  reforms  will  be  partly\noffset  by  reduced  costs,  or  increased  revenues,  induced  by  the  reforms  from  (i)  the  more\neffective use of the financial resources resulting from the sale of commodity aid, (ii) the use of\ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  for  procurement  and  sales  by  Government  agencies,  and  (iii)\nproceeds  from  the  privatization  of  the  remaining  crop  farms.  The  cost  for  implementing  the\nrestructuring plan for the Agricultural Bank is covered under the World Bank's Financial Sector\nAdjustment Credit.\n\n2.\n\nImplementation Arrangements and Executing Agency\n\n116.\nThe  Executing  Agency  for  the  policy  program  will  be  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and\nEconomy (MFE). MFE will be responsible for initiating withdrawals under the policy loan, for the\nuse of the counterpart funds generated by the loan proceeds, and the monitoring of these funds.\nA steering committee, with the deputy minister of finance and economy as chair and the deputy\nminister  of  food  and  agriculture  as  deputy  chair,  and  comprising  representatives  from  BOM,\nMOI, and additional representatives from MFE and MFA (including the PMU director), will assist\nin coordinating the implementation of the policy program, which will be carried out by MFA and\n\n\f29\n\nother  ministries  concerned.  The  steering  committee  will  be  established  prior  to  loan\neffectiveness, and will meet as often as necessary, but at least once every three months.\n\n3.\n\nProcurement and Disbursement\n\n117. Procurement  of  eligible  items  will  be  on  the  basis  of  normal  commercial  practices  for\nprocurement  by  the  private  sector  or  standard  Government  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB  for\nprocurement  by  the  public  sector.  For  goods  commonly  traded  on  international  commodity\nmarkets,  procurement  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  procedures  appropriate  to  the\ntrade and acceptable to ADB.\n\n118.\nThe proceeds of the policy loan will be used to finance the full foreign exchange cost of\nitems produced in and procured from ADB\u2019s member countries (other than those items specified\nin a negative list [Appendix 8] and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources).\nDisbursements  will  be  made  under  the  simplified  procedures  for  program  loans,  approved  by\nADB\u2019s Board of Directors on 16 April 1998. With each withdrawal request, the Borrower will be\nrequired to submit a certification that the value of the country\u2019s total eligible imports is equal or\ngreater  than  the  amount  of  ADB\u2019s  projected  disbursements  under  the  loan  in  a  given  period.\nADB will have the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the\nBorrower\u2019s certification.\n\n4.\n\nCounterpart Funds\n\n119.\nThe  local  currency  generated  by  the  loan  proceeds  (i.e.,  the  counterpart  funds)  will  be\nused  to  support  the  costs  of  the  policy  program.  Any  counterpart  funds  not  required  for  the\npolicy program will be used first to finance local currency costs of other ADB-financed projects\nand, second, for general development purposes.\n\n5.\n\nMonitoring and Tranching\n\n120.\nThe  Government  will  monitor  the  implementation  of  the  policy  program,  and  will  be\nrequired  to  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  quarterly  reports  on  the  implementation  of  the  policy\nprogram, including the completion of the actions set forth in the development policy letter and\nthe  policy  matrix.  The  Government  and  ADB  will  review  implementation  semi-annually,  and\nassess the impact of all relevant reforms on the agriculture sector in particular and the economy\nin  general.  This  will  include  active  policy  dialogue  between  the  Government  and  ADB,  and\nconsultations  with  other  major  bilateral  and  multilateral  agencies  supporting  agriculture  sector\ndevelopment.  MFE  in  cooperation  with  MFA  will  monitor  the  implementation  of  policy  reforms\nsupported by the ASDP on behalf of the Government. Training for monitoring and evaluation in\nMFA will assist the Government in monitoring program impacts. ADB will combine its reviews of\nthe Project with a review of the implementation of the policy program.\n\n121.\nThe loan funds will be disbursed in two equal tranches of $3.5 million equivalent each.\nThe  first  tranche  will  be  released  upon  loan  effectiveness.  As  indicated  in  the  policy  matrix\n(Appendix 4), the Borrower has satisfied five conditions prior to Board consideration. The nine\nconditions for release of the second tranche, which is expected to take place in the middle of the\npolicy  loan  period  (expected  in  March  2003),  are  set  forth  in  the  policy  matrix.  The  policy\nprogram  also  includes  other  conditions  that  ADB  will  require  the  Borrower  to  fulfill  prior  to  the\nend of the program (expected in March 2005).\n\n\f30\n\nB.\n\nThe Investment Loan\n\n1.\n\nAmount of Loan, Terms, and Source of Funds\n\n122.\nThe total cost of the Project is $13.1 million equivalent. The proposed ADB investment\nloan  is  for  $10.0  million  equivalent,  denominated  in  Special  Drawing  Rights,  from  the  Special\nFunds resources. The loan will have a maturity of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years.\nThe  interest  charge  will  be  1  percent  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5  percent  per\nannum thereafter.\n\n123. ADB will finance $6.0 million equivalent or 90 percent of the foreign exchange cost of the\ninvestment Project. ADB will also finance $4.0 million equivalent of the local currency cost. ADB\nfinancing will be about 63 percent of the total local currency cost of 6.4 million equivalent. The\ndetailed cost estimates and financing plan are presented in Appendix 7.\n\n2.\n\nImplementation Arrangements and Executing Agency\n\na. \n\nExecuting Agency and Implementing Agency\n\nimplementation.  The \n\n124. MFA  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project.  The  deputy  minister  of  food  and\nagriculture will be the national project director, and will be responsible for overall implementation\nproject \nimproving  rural\ncommunication links through MOI will be arranged through a joint order between MFA and MOI\noutlining  the  respective  responsibilities.  MOI  through  the  state-owned  Radio  and  Television\nCompany will be responsible for setting up and operating the radio transmitter stations in three\nwestern provinces. The Post and Telecommunication Authority will be responsible for upgrading\nthe telephone connections. MFE will enter into a subsidiary loan agreement with the Post and\nTelecommunication Authority for ensuring cost recovery.\n\nthe  subcomponent  on \n\nimplementation  of \n\n125.\nThe  implementation  of  the  credit  component  will  be  arranged  through  a  joint  order\nbetween  MFA  and  MFE,  outlining  the  linkages  between  the  PMU  and  PIUs  and  the  capacity\nbuilding  activities  for  PFI  staff  and  subborrowers.  The  implementation  of  the  credit  line  will  be\nbased  on  subsidiary  loan  agreements  between  BOM  and  the  PFIs.  Each  subsidiary  loan\nagreement  will  include  terms  and  conditions  relevant  to  the  credit  line,  as  well  as  to  the\nsubcomponent  on  capacity  building  for  PFI  staff  and  subborrowers.  Each  PFI  will  then  onlend\nfunds to subborrowers under onlending agreements.\n\nb.\n\nProject Management\n\n126. A  PMU  was  established  within  MFA  in  October  2000.  Under  the  supervision  of  the\nnational project director, the PMU headed by a PMU director will be responsible for the day-to-\nday coordination and implementation of project activities, including bidding for procurement and\nconstruction supervision; procurement of equipment and materials; selection, engagement, and\nmanagement of consultants; and liaison with ADB on project-related matters. In addition to the\nPMU  director,  the  PMU  will  be  staffed  with  a  project  adviser  (international  consultant  for  24\nperson-months),  an \nimplementation  officer,  an  accountant,  a  procurement  officer  (for\nprocurement  and  office  management),  and  a  driver.  The  steering  committee  responsible  for\noverseeing the implementation of the policy program will also give policy guidance to the PMU.\nTo  monitor  and  review  project  implementation  (the  policy,  institutional,  and  physical  aspects),\nsupervise  the  functioning  of  the  PMU,  and  provide  necessary  instructions  as  appropriate,  the\nsteering committee will meet as and when required, but at least once every three months.\n\n\f31\n\n127. Under  the  steering  committee,  a  working  group  will  be  established  to  implement  the\ncredit  line  (Appendix  6).  It  will  consist  of  a  representative  of  MFA,  MFE,  and  BOM;  ADB  will\nhave observer status. The working group will be chaired by the representative from MFA. The\ngroup will be responsible for approving PFIs, and ensuring that the approved PFIs continue to\nmeet the eligibility criteria. The working group will be established prior to loan effectiveness, and\nmeet as often as required, but at least once every three months.\n\n128. A  PIU  will  be  established  under  the  provincial  governor  in  each  of  the  four  western\nprovinces.  The  PIUs  will  supervise  the  day-to-day  implementation  of  project  activities  in  the\nrespective  province.  They  will  maintain  close  coordination  with  the  PMU,  be  consulted  on\nproject  design,  and  be  responsible  to  and  report  to  the  PMU.  Each  PIU  will  be  headed  by  a\nprovincial  project  director,  who  will  be  a  staff  member  of  the  provincial  government.  The  PIU\ndirectors will be responsible for the day-to-day management of the PIUs. In addition, each PIU\nwill  be  staffed  with  an  implementation  officer,  an  office  assistant  (procurement  and  office\nmanagement), and a driver. Representatives from the PIUs may attend meetings of the steering\ncommittee. The PIUs will also be informed about the discussions during the steering committee\nmeetings. A PIU advisory committee will be established in each of the four western provinces to\ngive  guidance  to  the  respective  PIU.  Each  PIU  advisory  committee  will  meet  as  and  when\nrequired, but at least once every three months to monitor and review project implementation in\nthe  respective  province,  and  supervise  PIU  functioning.  The  PIU  advisory  committee  will  be\nchaired by the governor of the provincial government and include representatives from the State\nAdministration  Department,  the  Planning,  Budget,  and  Economic  Policy  Department,  the\nAgriculture  Division,  the  provincial  assembly,  and  the  PIU.  The  PIUs  and  the  PIU  advisory\ncommittees  will  be  established  prior  to  loan  effectiveness.  To  ensure  that  the  four  provincial\ngovernments  perform  their  obligations  under  the  Project,  a  project  implementation  agreement\nwill  be  executed  between  MFA  and  the  respective  provincial  governor  as  a  condition  for\ndisbursement.\n\nc.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n129.\nThe Project will be implemented over five years, in accordance with the implementation\nschedule  given  in  Appendix  9,  and  is  expected  to  be  completed  by  March  2006.  MFA  has\noverall responsibility for the project implementation, and implementation of specific activities will\nbe  undertaken  either  by  the  four  western  provinces,  which  have  executed  a  project\nimplementation  agreement  with  MFA,  or  by  MOI  and  MFE,  which  have  executed  a  joint  order\nwith MFA. The implementation of the credit component in the two north-central provinces will be\nfacilitated by the establishment of a credit office in the provincial capital of Darhan-Uul.\n\n3. \n\nProcurement and Consulting Services\n\na.\n\nProcurement\n\n130. All  procurement  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  for  Procurement.\nProcurement  of  equipment,  vehicles,  and  furniture  financed  by  the  investment  loan  will  be\nawarded  based  on  international  shopping,  direct  purchase,  or  local  competitive  bidding\nprocedures acceptable to ADB. Procurement through international shopping will be undertaken\nfor  contract  packages  between  $100,000  and  $500,000  equivalent  in  accordance  with\nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Small  contracts  with  a  value  of  less  than  $100,000  equivalent\neach  may  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  direct  purchase.  Local  competitive  bidding  will  be\nundertaken for contract packages for pumps between $100,000 and $300,000. The PMU will be\nresponsible \nthe\nsubcomponent  for  improving  rural  communication  links,  which  will  be  conducted  by  MOI.  MOI\n\nfor  overall  procurement  activities,  except \n\nthe  procurement  under \n\nfor \n\n\f32\n\nwill  be  responsible  for  establishing  the  radio  transmitter  stations  and  upgrading  telephone\nconnections.  MOI,  together  with  the  Radio  and  Television  Company  and  the  Post  and\nTelecommunication Authority, has enough in-house capacity to prepare the bidding documents\nand  conduct  bid  evaluation.  Appendix  10  shows  the  indicative  contract  packages  for\nprocurement.\n\nb.\n\nConsulting Services\n\n131.\nInternational  and  domestic  consultant  services  will  be  financed  by  the  investment  loan\nfor  the  production  and  marketing  support  component,  the  credit  component,  and  the  project\nmanagement  component.  A  total  of  46  person-months  of  international  consulting  and  392\nperson-months of domestic consulting will be provided. The international consultants will have\nexpertise  in  (i)  international  classification  standards  for  cashmere  and  wool  classing  and\nmarketing,  as  well  as  for  livestock  marketing;  (ii)  water  resource  economics  and  well\nrehabilitation; (iii) rural credit; and (iv) project management. The domestic consultants will have\nexpertise  in  similar  areas  as  the  international  consultants.  They  will  also  provide  expertise  in\nhorticulture  production,  marketing  and  processing,  and  related  business  practices.  In  addition,\nthe  investment  loan  will  provide  for  a  training  contract  (for  10  person-months)  under  the\nsubcomponent  for  veterinary  services,  covering  the  areas  of  veterinary  meat  inspection  and\nabattoir  hygiene,  veterinary  epidemiology,  and  veterinary  diagnosis.  The  investment  loan  will\nalso provide two service contracts: one for providing advice to horticulture producers under the\nsubcomponent on the Green Revolution Program, and one for carrying out training for potential\nsubborrowers under the subcomponent on capacity building for PFIs and subborrowers.\n\nThe international consulting services, including the training contract, will be provided by\n132.\na  firm  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  The  domestic\nconsultants,  including  the  local  providers  under  the  two  service  contracts,  will  be  recruited  by\nthe  firm  in  accordance  with  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  In  selecting  and  engaging  the\nconsultants for item (iii) and the provider under the service contract for carrying out training for\npotential subborrowers, MFA will consult with MFE. The terms of reference and the schedule for\nconsulting  services  are  given  in  Supplementary  Appendix  F.  The  consultants  and  service\nproviders  financed  by  the  investment  loan  will  work  in  close  consultation  with  the  consultants\nfinanced by the attached TA.\n\n4.\n\nDisbursement\n\nTo expedite disbursement of loan proceeds, the Project will utilize two imprest accounts\n133.\n(in  dollars).  The  account  for  the  activities  of  the  production  and  marketing  support  component\nand the subcomponent on capacity building for PFIs and subborrowers will be established at a\ncommercial bank. The account for the credit line will be established at BOM. The accounts will\nbe established immediately after loan effectiveness. The initial amount to be deposited in each\nis  not  expected  to  exceed  $200,000  equivalent.  The  imprest  accounts  will  be  established,\nmanaged, replenished, and liquidated in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook,\nand detailed arrangements agreed to by the Government and ADB.\n\n134. Statement  of  expenditure  procedures  will  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures\nunder  the  Project,  and  to  liquidate  advances  provided  to  the  imprest  accounts  in  accordance\nwith procedures satisfactory to ADB and consistent with ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook.\nEach individual payment reimbursed or liquidated under the procedures will not exceed $50,000\nequivalent  for  each  item  of  expenditure.  The  disbursement  procedures  for  the  credit  line  are\noutlined in Appendix 6.\n\n\f5.\n\nAnticorruption\n\n33\n\n135. During  project  processing,  ADB's  anticorruption  policy  was  explained  to  Government\nofficials. Attention was drawn to the section on fraud and corruption that was recently added to\nADB's Guidelines for Procurement, particularly the need for bidders, suppliers, and contractors\nto observe the highest standards of ethics in procuring and executing ADB-financed contracts,\nand the sanctions if fraud and corruption are discovered. Similarly, the anticorruption provisions\nadded to ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants were also discussed. The ability of MFA\nto  prevent  potentially  corrupt  practices  will  be  enhanced  by  the  capacity  building  activities\nprovided under the project management component.\n\n6.\n\nProject Reviews\n\nthe  Government  will  undertake  semi-annual  reviews  during  project\n136. ADB  and \nimplementation,  taking  into  account  the  lessons  from  ADB's  operational  experience  with\nagricultural  projects  in  other  transition  economies  in  Central  Asia,  which  showed  the  need  for\nclose  monitoring  during  project  implementation.  The  reviews  will  include  evaluation  of  the\nproject  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  achievement  of  scheduled  targets,  progress  on\nthe agenda for policy reform, and capacity-building measures.\n\nIn addition, ADB will conduct a midterm review about 30 months after loan effectiveness.\n137.\nSenior officials from MFA, MFE, BOM, and MOI will participate in the review. The PMU will be\nresponsible for preparing a document outlining accomplishments and problems, which will be a\nbasis for discussion at the midterm review. The midterm review will enable the Government and\nADB  to  evaluate  the  progress  with  project  implementation,  to  assess  the  initial  impact  of  the\nProject and, if required, to make adjustments in implementation arrangements for the remaining\nProject period.\n\n7.\n\nReports\n\n138. MFA will provide ADB with all reports and information that ADB may reasonably request\nconcerning (i) the investment loan and the expenditure of the proceeds thereof at the national\nand  provincial  levels;  (ii)  the  policy  reforms;  (iii)  MFA  management  and  operations,  and  its\nrelevant agencies; (iv) the projected annual disbursement schedule for the investment loan; and\n(v) any other matters relating to the investment loan. MFA will furnish brief monthly reports and\ndetailed quarterly progress reports to ADB on project implementation and overall operation and\nmanagement. The quarterly reports  will be submitted no later than 30 days after each quarter\nand should include progress made and problems encountered during the quarter under review,\nsteps taken or proposed to be taken to remedy these problems, and the proposed program of\nactivities and expected disbursements during the following quarter. In addition, MFA will prepare\nand submit a project completion report to ADB within three months after the closing date of the\ninvestment loan in a format acceptable to ADB. All reports will be submitted in English.\n\n8.\n\nAccounts and Audit\n\n139. MFA will maintain records and accounts in accordance with sound accounting principles,\nand  sufficiently  detailed  to  identify  goods  and  services  financed  by  the  proceeds  of  the\ninvestment loan and to disclose the use thereof under the Project. These principles are detailed\nin the Project Accounting Manual, which was prepared23 to record activities for all ADB-funded\nprojects  in  Mongolia.  The  accounts  (including  financial  statements,  statements  of  expenditure,\nand  imprest  account  records)  will  be  audited  annually,  in  accordance  with  sound  auditing\n                                                          \n23 TA 2993-MON: Capacity Building in Project Accounting in Mongolia, for $150,000, approved on 10 March 1998.\n\n\f34\n\nstandards  by  independent  external  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  Provisions  have  been  made\nunder  the  investment  loan  to  finance  the  cost  of  auditing.  MFA  will  submit  certified  copies  of\naudited accounts and financial statements and the report of the auditor within nine months from\nthe  close  of  each  fiscal  year.  MFA  will  provide  ADB  with  additional  information  concerning\naccounts and financial statements and their audit as ADB may reasonably request from time to\ntime.\n\n140. Separate  accounts  will  be  maintained  for  the  imprest  accounts;  these  will  be  audited\nannually and the accounts submitted to ADB. ADB reserves the right to undertake an audit of\nthese  accounts  at  any  time.  In  addition,  under  the  subsidiary  loan  agreements  between  BOM\nand each of the PFIs, the PFI will be required to maintain full records relating to the subloans\nprovided, for at least five years after the subloan is given. The PMU and ADB may review and\naudit these records on a random basis.\n\n9.\n\nMonitoring and Evaluation\n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  a  comprehensive  program  for  project  monitoring  and\n141.\nevaluation,  acceptable  to  ADB,  is  carried  out  to  systematically  generate  input  and  output  data\nfor each investment subcomponent. This will include socioeconomic and environmental data to\nmonitor and measure project impacts. A set of indicators and the necessary baseline data will\nbe developed at the beginning of the Project by the staff and consultants of the PMU and PIUs,\nin consultation with the PFIs, cooperative associations, and other local stakeholders. The PFIs\nwill provide data on credit line beneficiaries, and the cooperative associations on beneficiaries of\ncooperative development. MFA's Information, Monitoring, and Evaluation Department will work\nclosely  with  the  PMU,  and  receive  PMU  support  and  training  to  ensure  that  monitoring  and\nevaluation  activities  continue  beyond  project  implementation.  Similarly,  the  PIUs  in  each\nprovince  will  provide  support  and  training  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  at  the  provincial  level.\nAnnual monitoring and evaluation reports will be prepared by each PIU, and consolidated and\nsubmitted to ADB through the PMU.\n\n142. Regarding the credit line under the credit component, the working group, together with\nADB, will conduct reviews six months and twelve months after the date when the first subsidiary\nloan  agreement  with  a  PFI  is  executed.  The  reviews  will  assess  matters  relating  to  the\nimplementation of the credit line, including the percentage of loan proceeds disbursed, the types\nof subborrowers and their geographical location, the uses by the subborrowers of the subloans,\nthe  interest  rates  charged  to  PFIs  and  subborrowers,  and  the  performance  of  the  PFIs.  The\nfindings  of  the  reviews  will  be  taken  into  account  in  the  further  implementation  of  the  credit\ncomponent.\n\nVI.\n\nTHE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\n\n143.\nThe  ASDP  will  be  accompanied  by  advisory  TA  to  support  Capacity  Building  in\nAgriculture.  This  includes  assistance  for  training  of  cooperative  members  and  for  promoting\nsustainable pasture management. The TA will focus on the four western provinces. Details on\nthe TA are provided in Appendix 11.\n\n144.\nThe TA component on training for cooperatives will be closely linked to and set the stage\nfor  the  activities  planned  under  the  project  subcomponent  on  cooperative  development.  It  will\nsupport  the  training  of  cooperative  advisory  staff  at  the  recently  established  Cooperative\nTraining  Center  in  Ulaanbaatar,  including  trainers,  business  advisers,  accountants,  and\nauditors. They will then assist the cooperatives in the four western provinces. The training will\nbe  closely  coordinated  with  the  GTZ  project  on  cooperative  promotion,  and  be  based  on  their\n\n\f35\n\nexperience  with  the  first  training  program  for  cooperative  trainers.  Limited  support  will  be\nprovided  to  improve  the  facilities  of  the  Cooperative  Training  Center,  and  to  set  up  provincial\ncooperative promotion centers in the capitals of the four western provinces.\n\n145.\nThe  TA  component  on  sustainable  pasture  management  will  be  closely  linked  with  the\nproject  component  on  well  rehabilitation.  Taking  into  account  the  outcomes  of  a  previous  TA\n(footnote  18),  this  TA  component  will  pilot  test  alternative  approaches  to  improve  grazing\npatterns  based  on  pasture  comanagement  arrangements  between  government  staff  at  lower\nlevels  and  herder  groups.  This  will  contribute  to  formulating  and  implementing  land\nmanagement plans at the district level as envisaged in the 1995 Land Law. The TA component\nwill  help  to  identify  current  winter  and  summer  pasture  uses,  collect  information  on  operative\nand  inoperative  wells,  identify  and  train  herder  groups  that  use  particular  pasture  areas  and\nwells, train provincial and district staff involved in land management, and explore the feasibility\nof setting up district pasture comanagement units and provincial comanagement committees to\nadvise the respective governor on formulating and implementing land management plans.\n\nThe  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $817,100  equivalent,  comprising  $479,230  in\n146.\nforeign  exchange  cost  and  $337,870  in  local  currency  cost.  The  entire  foreign  exchange  cost\nand $215,770 equivalent of the local currency cost totalling $695,000 equivalent is proposed to\nbe financed by ADB on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government\nof  Japan.  The  cooperatives  and  the  Government  will  finance  $122,100  equivalent  of  the  local\ncurrency cost, or 15 percent of the total TA cost.\n\nVII.\n\nBENEFITS AND RISKS\n\nA.\n\nExpected Impacts\n\n1.\n\nProject Justification\n\n147.\nThe  Project  will  contribute  to  agricultural  growth  and  poverty  reduction  primarily  by\nincreasing incomes of agricultural producers. By supporting a production and marketing support\ncomponent  combined  with  a  credit  component,  the  Project  will  help  increase  productivity  and\nprofitability in herder and crop producing households in the four western provinces. In addition,\nthe credit component will support increased wheat production and productivity, as well as other\ncrop and livestock production in the two north-central provinces.\n\n148. By its very nature, a sector development program such as the ASDP cannot be readily\nsummed up in a singe rate of return measurement as might be the case in agricultural projects\nfocusing  on  a  single  major  improvement,  such  as  irrigation.  Furthermore,  any  financial  and\neconomic  analysis  for  the  credit  component  can  only  be  indicative  because  subborrowers  are\nencouraged to use the money they obtain for the most productive use available to them in their\nagricultural  production  and  processing  enterprises.  However,  ample  evidence  exists,  as\npresented  in  Appendix  12,  that  the  investment  Project  of  the  ASDP  will  be  profitable  for\nindividual  herders  and  crop  producers,  and  will  generate  new  wealth  for  the  economy  of\nMongolia.  Project  analysis  was  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  for  the\nEconomic Analysis of Projects.\n\n2.\n\nResults of Financial and Economic Analysis\n\n149.\nThe  financial  and  economic  analysis  was  carried  out  in  four  parts,  including  for  the\nsubcomponents  on  (i)  livestock  production  (comprising  veterinary  services,  well  rehabilitation,\nand in part rural communication links), (ii) cooperative development, (iii) the Green Revolution\nProgram,  and  (iv)  credit  to  purchase  improved  seed  for  wheat  production,  all  of  which  are\n\n\f36\n\nindependently  financially  and  economically  viable.  The  analyses  for  livestock  production  and\ncooperative development were done using the rate of return analysis, and the analyses for the\nGreen Revolution Program and the credit for wheat seed using other estimates of financial and\neconomic worth.\n\nLivestock production will provide significant quantifiable and nonquantifiable benefits that\n150.\nwill  directly  contribute  to  the  goals  of  agricultural  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  Quantifiable\nbenefits  arise  because  of  improved  production  and  productivity  of  herder  households.  With\nproductivity in livestock production currently very low, relatively few inputs have the potential to\nhave  a  major  impact  in  the  short  term.  This  is  particularly  the  case  with  improved  livestock\nhealth  through  the  use  of  veterinary  inputs.  Nonquantifiable  benefits  will  arise  from  improved\ngrazing  patterns  made  possible  by  the  well  rehabilitation  subcomponent.  The  environmental\nbenefits  resulting  from  reduced  pressure  on  the  pastures  currently  served  by  wells  may  be\nsignificant in the longer term, but are difficult to quantify based on the data currently available.\nThe  financial  and  economic  analyses  focus  on  the  quantifiable  benefits  to  herder  households,\nand yield a financial internal rate of return (FIRR) of 28 percent and an economic internal rate of\nreturn (EIRR) of 38 percent. The resulting net present value, discounted at 12 percent, shows\nthat  about  MNT3,792  million  will  be  generated  for  the  economy.  The  EIRR  is  higher  than  the\nFIRR  because  the  value  of  incremental  livestock  production  is  priced  at  border  prices,  while\nmuch of the supporting services are nontraded. Results of the sensitivity analysis indicate that\nEIRRs  remain  high  despite  significant  changes  in  key  variables,  including  increased  costs,\nreduced benefits, or a combination of adverse conditions.\n\n151.\nThrough  the  development  of  cooperatives,  especially  secondary  cooperatives,  herder\nhouseholds  will  command  higher  prices  for  their  output  bringing  an  immediate  income  gain.\nHerder  households  will  also  be  able  to  sell  their  animals  at  the  end  of  the  summer  instead  of\nearly in the season, so that they will be able to realize the advantage of a weight gain as a result\nof good summer pasture. The investment in cooperatives proves to be quite profitable financially\nand  good  economically,  even  with  very  low  participation  rates.  The  analysis  assumes  that\nherder  households  marketing  through  the  cooperatives  will  be  those  with  sufficient  initiative  to\ntake  advantage  of \nthe  productivity  gains  made  possible  by  the  livestock  production\nsubcomponents.  Thus  the  benefit  stream  is  the  increment  between  a  herder  household\u2019s\nincome with productivity gain but without cooperative marketing as opposed to the income with\nproductivity  gain  and  marketing  through  secondary  cooperatives.  Only  half  of  the  herder\nhouseholds benefiting from the productivity gains under the Project are assumed to also market\nthrough  secondary  cooperatives.  With  these  assumptions  the  FIRR  is  estimated  to  be  41\npercent,  and  the  EIRR  22  percent.  The  difference  between  the  two  arises  because  meat\nproducts  from  secondary  cooperatives  are  assumed  to  command  a  quality  premium  at  the\ndomestic  market,  but  not  at  the  international  markets.  Economic  prices  are  thus  somewhat\nlower  than  financial  prices,  and  the  benefit  from  an  incremental  gain  is  less;  in  contrast,  the\nproject  costs  are  not  very  different  in  the  financial  and  economic  analyses.  As  a  result,  the\nincremental net benefit in the economic analysis is only about 40 percent of that in the financial\nanalysis. Results of the sensitivity analysis shows the cooperative development subcomponent\nto  remain  viable  even  if  a  benefit  reduction  of  10  percent  or  a  cost  increase  of  10  percent\noccurs.\n\n152. No  systematic  study  of  the  Government's  Green  Revolution  Program  has  so  far  been\nundertaken.  Yet  experience  from  Hovd  province  suggests  that  the  aggregate  impact  can  be\nsignificant.  In  Hovd  about  half  of  the  total  vegetables  marketed  now  come  from  households\nparticipating  in  the  Green  Revolution  Program  and  amount  to  some  MNT280  million  annually.\nBecause  of  the  limited  data  availability,  a  rate  of  return  for  the  subcomponent  on  the  Green\nRevolution  Program  cannot  be  calculated.  However,  it  is  possible  to  gain  an  idea  of  how\n\n\f37\n\neffective  the  subcomponent  must  be  to  achieve  financial  and  economic  results  sufficient  to\njustify the investment. In Hovd, for example, some MNT7 million incremental annual expenditure\nis expected from the subcomponent. Thus, production must increase by only about 2.5 percent\nto pay for the incremental cost, which is considered to be achievable.\n\n153. Much  of  the  credit  to  be  made  available  in  Darhan-Uul  and  Selenge  is  expected  to  be\nused  to  purchase  improved  seed,  in  the  short  term  imported  from  a  neighboring  country.\nImproved  seed  alone,  even  in  the  absence  of  other  inputs,  can  increase  yields  by  some  25\npercent.  An  analysis  based  on  the  production  system  common  in  the  north-central  provinces\nshows  that  the  incremental  value  of  wheat  on  a  per  hectare  basis  in  financial  terms  is  about\nthree times higher than the necessary investment in improved seed. The economic value of the\nincremental  production  would  be  somewhat  higher  than  the  financial.  This  is  because  the\nimported seed is priced at its border price, but the value of wheat at the farmgate is somewhat\nbelow  the  border  price  because  the  Government  has  been  releasing  food  grain  aid  at  a\nrelatively low price to moderate consumer prices.\n\n3.\n\nImpact on Poverty\n\n154.\nThe poverty analysis provided in the COS indicates that poverty in Mongolia is primarily\nincome-based: the result of insufficient incomes and lack of employment opportunities, and less\nthe result of education or health deprivation, social exclusion, or other lack of assets. The failure\nof  economic  growth  to  reduce  poverty  is  a  reflection  of  the  problem  of  creating  broad-based\nincome and employment-generating activities.\n\nThe  ASDP  is  designed  to  increase  the  income  and  to  some  extent  the  employment\n155.\nopportunities of agricultural producers, both in provincial centers where poverty is highest, and\nin  rural  areas.  In  provincial  centers,  poverty  is  strongly  correlated  with  unemployment.  In  rural\nareas one of the main reasons for poverty is the large number of households with small herds,\nwith  100  animals  generally  considered  the  minimum  size  for  a  self-sustaining  household.  By\nconcentrating  the  activities  of  the  project  components  in  four  western  provinces  where  the\nnumber of households with herds of less than 100 animals ranges from 40 to 60 percent, poor\npeople are expected to comprise at least one third of the beneficiaries.\n\n156.\nThe most important subcomponents under the ASDP in terms of poverty impact are the\nsupport  for  cooperative  development  and  the  support  for  the  Green  Revolution  Program.\nAccording to information from cooperative associations, the members of cooperatives tend to be\nmostly  households  with  smaller  herds.  Similarly,  the  target  group  of  the  Green  Revolution\nProgram are vulnerable groups including households headed by women and the unemployed in\nprovincial and district centers, and households with small herds, who graze their animals near\nthese centers and need additional income sources. The ASDP policy matrix is closely linked to\nthese  two  subcomponents  and  includes  policy  measures  to  provide  for  the  necessary\nframework  for  the  successful  implementation  of  both  cooperative  development  and  the  Green\nRevolution Program.\n\n157. Appendix  13  presents  an  overview  of  the  poverty  situation  in  Mongolia,  and  a  poverty\nimpact  assessment  of  the  relevant  policy  measures  including  (i)  implementation  of  the\nCooperative  Law  and  Cooperative  Development  Program,  and  (ii)  reorientation  of  the  Green\nRevolution Program. The analysis of these policy measures in terms of the effect on the labor\nmarket,  prices,  access  for  the  poor,  and  transfers  shows  that  they  are  anticipated  to  have  a\npositive impact on the poor. None of the other policy measures included in the reform program\nare expected to have a significant adverse impact on the poor.\n\n\fB.\n\nRisks and Safeguards\n\n38\n\n158. A  potential  risk  to  the  ASDP  policy  program  is  a  delay  in  implementing  some  of  the\npolicy  measures  under  the  reform  program.  The  delay  may  be  caused  by  institutional\nweaknesses or economic uncertainties. Safeguards are built into the ASDP to minimize this risk.\nA period of two years between the first and second tranches, and another two years between\nthe  second  tranche  and  the  end  of  the  program  have  been  set  to  give  adequate  time  for  the\ncompletion of the policy reforms. In addition, many of the policy measures are closely linked to\nactivities proposed under the investment Project and associated TA, so that support is indirectly\nprovided for policy implementation.\n\n159. A  potential  risk  to  the  investment  Project  involves  the  provision  of  inadequate\ncounterpart financing. The 1999 country portfolio review for Mongolia concluded that ADB's loan\nportfolio  is  satisfactory,  with  implementation  generally  proceeding  on  schedule  despite  the\neconomic uncertainties, fiscal constraints, and general institutional weakness. The main current\nand  likely  continuing  issue  facing  the  efficient  implementation  of  ADB-financed  projects  is  the\navailability  and  timely  release  of  counterpart  funds.  The  Government  requires  assistance  to\naddress  the  budget\u2019s  structural  problems  which  are  at  the  heart  of  the  current  budget\nimbalance.  The  recently  approved  Governance  Reform  Program24  will  contribute  to  improving\npublic expenditure management.\n\n160. A  potential  risk  for  the  credit  component  is  the  faltering  of  the  ongoing  financial  sector\nand  banking  reform.  To  address  this,  implementation  of  the  Agricultural  Bank\u2019s  business  plan\nneeds  to  proceed  on  schedule.  The  Post  Bank  must  undertake  training  to  start  lending  in  its\nrural  branches  and  subbranches.  The  inclusion  of  Darhan-Uul  and  Selenge  in  the  credit\ncomponent  will  allow  other  banks  and  NBFIs  to  qualify  as  PFIs.  The  credit  component  is\ndesigned to allow for flexibility for PFIs: any financial institution will be able to participate as long\nas  it  meets  the  eligibility  criteria.  The  Government  is  committed  to  continuing  the  reforms  and\nensuring the necessary framework to allow for the restoration of lending services in rural areas.\nThe  Second  Financial  Sector  Program  in  cooperation  with  World  Bank's  Financial  Sector\nAdjustment Credit, both approved in 2000, will help mitigate the risk of faltering financial sector\nand banking reforms.\n\n161. Successful  project  implementation  will  also  depend  on  the  capacity  of  the  national,\nprovincial, and district agricultural agencies. The ASDP includes ADB's first investment project\nin Mongolian agriculture, and the second externally-funded loan executed by MFA. Experience\nwith  agriculture-related  agencies  in  other  transition  economies  has  shown  that  strengthening\ncapacity requires a long-term effort. Most project subcomponents include capacity building and\ntraining activities. The project management component includes assistance to MFA to improve\nmonitoring and evaluation systems.\n\nA.\n\nSpecific Assurances\n\nVIII.\n\nASSURANCES\n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances  in  addition  to  the  standard\n\n162.\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n\n(i)\n\nThe Government will (a) maintain the policies adopted and actions taken prior to\nthe  date  of  the  Loan  Agreement  for  the  policy  loan,  as  described  in  the\ndevelopment  policy  letter  and  the  policy  matrix,  for  the  duration  of  the  ASDP\n\n                                                          \n24 Loan 1731-MON: Governance Reform Program, for $25.0 million, approved on 2 December 1999.\n\n\f39\n\npolicy  loan  period  and  subsequently;  (b)  promptly  adopt  the  other  policies  and\ntake  the  other  actions  included  in  the  ASDP  as  specified  in  the  development\npolicy letter and the policy matrix; and (c) ensure that such policies and actions\ncontinue in effect for the duration of the policy loan period and subsequently.\n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  in  accordance  with  the  implementation\nschedule of the investment Project (a) a green revolution committee, to support\nthe  Green  Revolution  Program,  is  established  with  qualified  members  and  is\noperational in each of the four western provinces; and (b) qualified staff, including\nprovincial  and  district  agronomists  are  allocated  and  assigned  to  implement  the\ninvestment Project.\n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  training  program  for  public  and  private\nsector  veterinarians  in  international  standards  of  meat  inspection  is  carried  out\nunder  the  Project,  including  the  delivery  of  the  training  by  the  veterinary\ninspectors of the Veterinary Inspection Agency of MFA who will participate in the\noverseas training-of-trainers program in such standards.\n\nDuring  the  first  year  of  project  implementation,  the  Government  will  develop\nmechanisms \nthe\nfor  cost  recovery  acceptable \nestablishment of secondary cooperatives and well rehabilitation.\n\nto  ADB  with  respect \n\nto \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  sufficient  budgetary  allocations  are  made\navailable  to  cover  operation  and  maintenance  costs  of  the  radio  transmitter\nstations in Gobialtay, and the radio transmitter stations to be set up in Dzavhan,\nHovd, and Urs.\n\nThe Government will ensure that annual budget allocations are made, so that the\ncounterpart  funds  required  for  project  implementation  are  available  on  a  timely\nbasis.

Reduce price and other distortions to improve resource allocation and efficiency in the agriculture sector\n\n1.1 The trade regime was\nsubstantially liberalized, but nontariff\nand informal barriers discourage\nexport growth.\n\n1.1.1 The Government has established clear procedures for the\napplication for and issuance of export licenses for agricultural\nproducts and informed the public about these procedures through\nthe public media.\n\nProgress reports\n\nDecember 2001\n\n1.2.1 The Government has taken necessary actions so that the\nprocurement and sales of Government agencies at national and\nlocal levels are carried out on the basis of competitive bidding in\nquantities and on a schedule designed to minimize the influence on\nmarket prices.\n\nMarket surveys and\nprogress reports\n\nDecember 2001\n\n1.2 The procurement and sale\nactivities of Government agencies\n(including the State Reserve Agency,\nthe Wheat Fund, strategic enterprises,\nand sales of food commodity aid)\nshould be carried out without\ninfluencing market prices.\n\n1.3 More efficient use of financial\nresources is needed in the institutions\nsupporting  agriculture, particularly for\nasset and financial management.\n\n1.3.1 The Government has established a working group to improve\nthe financial management and accountability of counterpart funds\ngenerated by the sale of commodity aid.\n\nCopy of order of Ministry\nof Finance and Economy\n(MFE)\n\nOctober 2000\n(Condition for Board\nsubmission)\n\n1.3.2 In accordance with Resolution 116/1998, the Government has\n(i) commenced the process of transferring the counterpart funds to\naccounts of MFE at the Bank of Mongolia (BOM); and (ii) provided\nthat the opening of any new account for future counterpart funds\nrequires the prior approval of the Minister of Finance and Economy.\n\nOpening of accounts at\nBOM\n\nOctober 2000\n(Condition for Board\nsubmission)\n\n1.3.3 The Government has provided for a financial and management\naudit of these counterpart funds by an independent auditor.\n\nAuditor's report\n\n1.3.4 MFE is managing the recovery of loans made with counterpart\nfunds in accordance with a loan recovery plan.\n\nCopy of loan recovery\nplan, and progress\nreports\n\nDecember 2001\n(Condition for second\ntranche release)\nDecember 2001\n(Condition for second\ntranche release)\n\n5\n5\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n4\n\n,\n \n\np\na\ng\ne\n\n \n\n5\n\n\fPrevious Reform Measures\nand Issues\n\nPolicy Measures under the Program\n\n     Time Frame\n\nMonitoring\nArrangements\n(Notes)\n\n2. Promote competitive markets for agricultural inputs, outputs, and processed goods\n\n2.1 Most crop farms have been\nprivatized, but the process needs to\nbe completed.\n\n2.1.1 In the five crop farms with significant national Government\nshareholdings, the State Property Commission (SPC) has\ncompleted the disposal of these shareholdings.a\n\nSPC records\n\nJanuary 2003\n\n2.2 Enterprises remaining in the\npublic sector, such as Biokombinat, a\nfactory that produces vaccines for\ncombating animal diseases, should\noperate autonomously and compete\nfairly with the private sector.\n\n2.3 The Cooperative Law adopted\nin 1998 aims at increasing the\ncompetitive strength of agricultural\nproducers, and provides for\ncooperative associations to be self-\nregulating bodies. To carry out these\nfunctions, cooperative associations\nneed a conducive regulatory\nframework and support for their\norganizational development.\n\n2.1.2 In the 18 crop farms with significant provincial Government\nshareholdings, the SPC has completed the disposal of these\nshareholdings.b\n\n2.2.1 The Government has prepared a plan, acceptable to ADB, on\nmeasures to be taken so that Biokombinat, can achieve operational\nand financial autonomy and cease to receive subsidies.\n\nSPC records\n\nJanuary 2003\n\nCopy of plan\n\nJanuary 2002\n\n2.2.2 The Government has implemented the plan for Biokombinat.\n\nAudited financial reports\nof Biokombinat\n\nJanuary 2003\n\n2.3.1 MFA has reconstituted the National Council, which is\nresponsible for the implementation of the Cooperative Development\nProgram, to include relevant stakeholders (with representatives of\nall cooperative associations as voting members and representatives\nof relevant assistance agencies as advisers).\n\nMFA issuance of a\nresolution on the\nreconstitution of the\nNational Council\n\nOctober 2000\n(Condition for Board\nsubmission)\n\n2.3.2 The National Council has amended its charter to include\nrelevant stakeholders (with representatives of all cooperative\nassociations as voting members and representatives of relevant\nassistance agencies as advisers).\n\nCopy of amended charter\n\nOctober 2000\n(Condition for Board\nsubmission)\n\n2.3.3 The Government through the National Council has prepared a\ntime-bound action plan, acceptable to ADB, and has provided the\nnecessary budgetary funds to implement all provisions of the 1998\nCooperative Law and the 1998 Cooperative Development Program.\n\nCopy of action plan, and\nprogress reports\n\nDecember 2001\n(Condition for second\ntranche release)\n\n3. Ensure the delivery of financial services and provide improved access to credit for the rural population\n\n3.1 Lack of access to financial\nservices, in particular credit, continues\nto be a fundamental constraint to rural\ndevelopment. Agricultural Bank, which\nhas the largest network of rural\nbranches, is now being restored as a\ncommercially viable entity that can be\nprivatized and/or sold.\n\n3.1.1 The restructuring plan for the Agricultural Bank has been\nimplemented in a manner acceptable to ADB.\n\nRestructuring of the\nAgricultural Bank, and\nprogress reports\n\nJuly 2002\n(Condition for second\ntranche release)\n\n3.1.2 Agricultural Bank has developed a time-bound business plan,\nacceptable to ADB, for the restoration of lending services.\n\nCopy of business plan\n\nOctober 2000\n(Condition for Board\nsubmission)\n\n3.1.3 Agricultural Bank has initiated lending operations in rural\nareas.\n\nProgress reports\n\nJanuary 2001\n\n5\n6\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n4\n\n,\n \n\np\na\ng\ne\n\n \n\n6\n\n\f4.

This prevents\nproducers from recovering the VAT\non their inputs.\n\n4.2 Under a 1997 amendment to the\n1992 Economic Entities and\nOrganizations Tax Law, crop farms\nare provided with a 50 percent\nexemption  from income tax.  At  the\nsame   time,  depreciation   for   most\nitems  of  equipment  is  spread  over\n10 years and based on historic\npurchase costs which discourages\ninvestment.\n\n4.1.1 The current exemption from value-added tax for agricultural,\nforest, and hunting primary raw materials has been repealed and\nreplaced with an exemption that applies to primary producers rather\nthan products.

Together  they  comprise  about  a  quarter  of  the  country's  land  area\nand 15 percent of the population. About three quarters of the population are considered rural,\ni.e.,  they  live  outside  of  the  provincial  capital.  The  most  important  agricultural  activity  is\nextensive livestock production. About 25 percent of the national herd is being grazed in the four\nprovinces.\n\nThe  credit  component  of  the  Project  will  cover  the  four  western  provinces  and,  in\n2.\naddition, the north-central provinces of Darhan-Uul and Selenge. These two provinces comprise\n3  percent  of  the  country's  land  area  and  8  percent  of  the  population.  Darhan-Uul  province  is\nlocated  within  Selenge  province,  with  the  majority  of  the  population  living  in  the  provincial\ncenter.  In  Selenge  almost  80  percent  of  the  population  is  considered  rural.  Darhan-Uul  and\nSelenge are Mongolia's most important wheat producing areas, with about half of the total area\nsown to wheat and about half of the output. An overview of the four western and the two north-\ncentral provinces is provided in Table A5.1.\n\nB.\n\nRole of Agriculture\n\n3.\nThe  four  western  provinces  cover  three  ecological  zones:  a  northern  mountain  steppe\nwith  mixed  trees  and  grassland,  a  central  short-grass  steppe  that  is  almost  treeless,  and  the\nsouthern desert steppe characterized by very sparse vegetation. The environment is generally\nharsher than in the rest of the country, with extremely cold winters and high aridity. Rainfall is\nvery  erratic  and  ranges  between  130  mm  and  220  mm  per  year.  In  Gobialtay  the  average\ntemperature  in  January  is  -18o  Celsius,  and  in  Urs  -32o  Celsius.  Strong  winds  exacerbate  the\ncold  winter  temperatures  and,  periodically,  some  regions  suffer  from  dzud1  causing  extreme\nhardship  and  loss  of  livestock.  During  the  last  dzud  in  the  winter  of  1999/2000,  Urs  and\nDzavhan  were  the  third  and  fourth  most  affected  provinces  in  the  country  in  terms  of  loss  in\nlivestock, having lost 9 percent and 7 percent, respectively, as of 1 March 2000.\n\n4.\nPastoral livestock is the mainstay of the population in the four western provinces. During\nthe transition period, the number of livestock increased significantly, from 14 percent in Hovd to\n29 percent in Dzavhan. Nationwide, Dzavhan has now the third largest livestock herd. Among\nthe  four  western  provinces  it  has  the  largest  herd  and  the  highest  stocking  rate  (in  sheep\nequivalent  units  per  hectare).  The  growth  in  the  number  of  livestock  was  largely  due  to  the\nsharp increase in the number of goats, fuelled by rising cashmere prices. Gobialtay has now by\nfar the largest goat population in the west, and takes second place nationwide. Since 1989, the\nnumber of herder households more than doubled in all four provinces. This is a reflection of the\neconomic restructuring and the lack of employment opportunities in urban areas.\n\nDuring  the  1990s,  the  area  sown  to  crops  dramatically  declined  in  the  four  western\n5.\nprovinces. The most dramatic fall was in the area sown to fodder crops, followed by wheat, with\nDzavhan most affected. Urs is now the only province in the west that has some remaining wheat\n\n                  \n\n1 Dzud is a generic term denoting a natural disaster during which livestock are not able to graze. There are different\nkinds of dzud including one that involves formation of a layer of ice over grazing land, often exacerbated by severe\nsnowfall.\n\n\fTable A5.1: Overview of the Project

In 1999  the four western provinces accounted for only 7 percent of the total sown\narea.  Potato  and  vegetable  production  are  slowly  recovering,  with  Hovd  being  the  leading\nprovince. But in terms of hectares, the area devoted to these crops is relatively small.\n\nIn the two north-central provinces, livestock production is much less dominant than in the\n6.\nwestern  provinces.  As  in  the  pretransition  period,  the  region  continues  to  be  considered  the\ncountry's  premiere  wheat  producing  area.  During  the  1990s,  the  area  sown  to  wheat  also\ndeclined,  but  much  less  drastically  than  in  the  western  region,  because  of  the  generally  more\nfavorable  climate  and  better  soils.  While  in  1989  the  two  provinces  accounted  for  about  35\npercent of the total area sown to wheat, their share increased to about a half in 1999.\n\n7.\nNo data is available on the sources of income by province, but an overview is provided\nby  the  Government's  household  income  and  expenditure  survey  of  1998.  As  shown  in  Table\nA5.2, agriculture is the main source of household income in rural areas. Income from livestock\nproducts  dominates,  providing  close  to  65  percent  of  income  for  households.  Crop  products\n(including  horticultural  products)  are  important  for  households  in  district  centers  around  which\nmany  of  the  smaller  plots  are  located.  Wages  are  the  most  important  sources  of  income  for\nhouseholds in Ulaanbaatar and provincial and district centers. However, the dominant basis for\nwage  income  in  many  district  centers  is  agricultural  production,  while  agricultural  processing\nand  services  are  significant  in  urban  areas.  Agricultural  processing  and  services  also  provide\nthe  basis  of  much  income  from  commerce.  The  major  items  of  household  expenditure  are\nagricultural products, including food, clothing, and footwear. Outside of the urban centers, these\nitems are often sourced through subsistence and barter. In rural areas, only about two thirds of\nexpenditures is monetized.\n\nTable A5.2: Household Income and Expenditure\n(fourth quarter, 1998)\n\nItem\n\nA.

Ulaanbaatar.\n\n8.\nThree of the four western provinces are among the poorest provinces in Mongolia, with\nHovd  being  the  second,  Dzavhan  the  third,  and  Urs  the  fifth  poorest.  According  to  the\nGovernment's income-based poverty line, the population living below the minimum standard in\nthese three provinces is 43 percent, 41 percent, and 34 percent, respectively. A main reason for\nthe large number of poor people in these three provinces is the high percentage of households\nwith  small  herds  (Table  A5.3).  Although  their  number  is  declining,  more  than  half  of  all\n\n\f63\n\nAppendix 5, page 4\n\nhouseholds  with  animals  in  Hovd,  Dzavhan,  and  Urs  have  less  than  100  animals,  which  is\ngenerally  considered  as  the  minimum  size  for  a  self-sustaining  household.2  By  contrast,  in\nGobialtay, which is below the national average of 26 percent for people living below the poverty\nline,  less  than  40  percent  of  the  households  with  animals  have  less  than  100  animals.  With\nabout half of the animals in Gobialtay being goats, the income per animal is likely to be higher\nthan  in  the  other  western  provinces.  Households  with  more  than  200  animals  are  generally\nconsidered as living comfortably, and households with more than 500 animals are regarded as\nwealthy.\n\nTable A5.3: Distribution of Animals among\nHouseholds with Livestock in the Four Western Provinces, 1999\n(percent)\n\nItem\n\nup to 50\n51 \u2013 100\n101 \u2013 200\n201 \u2013 500\n> 500\n\nDzavhan\nHouseholds Animals\n\nGobialtay\nHouseholds Animals\n\nHovd\nHouseholds Animals\n\nUrs\nHouseholds Animals\n\n25.6\n24.8\n29.9\n16.8\n  2.7\n\n5.3\n14.0\n30.2\n35.7\n14.8\n\n16.8\n21.9\n35.5\n22.6\n3.2\n\n3.2\n10.5\n32.4\n39.4\n14.5\n\n27.3\n24.4\n28.7\n16.9\n2.7\n\n5.9\n14.2\n30.6\n35.6\n13.7\n\n34.5\n25.3\n24.9\n13.7\n1.6\n\n7.3\n16.9\n32.2\n33.5\n10.1\n\nSource: National Statistical Office of Mongolia. 2000. Livestock Census. Ulaanbaatar.\n\n9.\nThe  two  north-central  provinces  are  less  poor  than  the  western  provinces,  with  25\npercent of the population living below the poverty line in Darhan-Uul and 16 percent in Selenge.\nThis is partly due to the fact that they belong to the central region around Ulaanbaatar where the\nmajor share of the country's economic activity is taking place. The vast majority of crop farms is\nprivatized, with most of them under single (either individual or company) ownership. In Darhan-\nUul  and  Selenge,  about  100  wheat  producing  farms  have  areas  of  more  than  500  hectares\n(including fallow land, which accounts for about half of the area), and many smaller farms have\nless than 500 hectares.\n\n10.\nDuring the last decade, relatively little economic development has taken place in the four\nwestern provinces as compared with the rest of the country. This contributed, particularly during\nthe  second  half  of  the  1990s,  to  an  increasing  migration  of  people  to  the  relatively  more\nprosperous  central  region  around  the  capital  city.  In  1999,  for  example,  3,600  people  (900\nhouseholds) with 93,000 animals from Urs moved to the central region, and 2,000 people (340\nhouseholds) from Dzavhan. As a result, the population in Dzavhan and Urs is declining, while\nthe  population  in  provinces  like  Selenge  and  Darhan-Uul  is  increasing.  The  concentration  of\nlivestock in the central region is also increasing as indicated, for example, in the sharp rise in\nthe stocking rate (sheep equivalent unit per hectare) for Darhan-Uul. While no detailed analysis\nof the migration has been carried out so far, the majority of migrants are estimated to be better-\noff  herder  households  who  want  to  benefit  from  the  more  developed  marketing  links  in  the\ncentral  region  as  well  as  from  better  education  and  health  facilities.  In  addition,  many  people\nwho come to the capital to receive higher education do not return to their home provinces as in\nthe past, but stay in the area due to better employment opportunities.\n\n                  \n\n2 In  early  2000,  due  to  deteriorating  terms  of  trade,  at  least  150  animals  are  estimated  to  be  needed  by  a  self-\n\nsustaining herder household with no other significant sources of income.\n\n\f64\n\nAppendix 5, page 5\n\nD.\n\nGender Issues\n\n11.\nMongolia  is  characterized  by  high  gender  equity,  founded  in  nomadic  and  socialist\nvalues.  Women  are  well-educated  and  well-represented  in  most  occupations,  and  have  equal\naccess  to  education  and  employment  opportunities.  Female  enrollment  is  higher  than  male\nenrollment at most levels, including university education. During the transition period, however,\nthe economic and social independence of many women was undermined. The loss of jobs and\nthe breakdown of much of the social support system especially affected women. In rural areas\nsmall service industries often had to close, and in urban areas state service industries were the\nfirst  to  downsize  their  labor  force.  Women  were  disproportionally  affected  by  these  changes.\nCommensurate with the expansion of the private sector, the informal sector grew, where women\nnow predominate.\n\n12.\nPoverty  is  particularly  severe  among  households  headed  by  women.  According  to  the\nLiving  Standards  Measurement  Surveys,  63  percent  of  such  households  were  poor  in  1995.\nThis  ratio  decreased  to  47  percent  in  1998.  In  1998,  about  25  percent  of  the  very  poor\nhouseholds  and  18  percent  of  the  poor  households  were  headed  by  women.  Most  of  these\nhouseholds were in urban areas (44 percent of Ulaanbaatar's poor households, and 53 percent\nof  the  provincial  centers'  poor  households),  rather  than  in  rural  areas  (24  percent  of  poor\nhouseholds).\n\n13.\nIn the agriculture sector, there were some negative consequences for women resulting\nfrom the privatization of livestock. Prior to privatization, women in negdels worked primarily as\ndairy  maids  in  single-species  livestock  units.  Privatized  herds  are  usually  mixed  and  require\nmore  tending  and  processing  of  animal  products,  implying  more  work  for  women.  Herder\nhouseholds headed by women tend to have smaller herds than herder households headed by\nmen, because they received fewer animals when animals were privatized. Given that there are\noften  no  other  adults  in  the  households,  herder  households  headed  by  women  face  labor\nshortages in critical times of the year. In addition, many of them had to sell their animals in order\nto buy food and other necessities. When animal resources are depleted, the women often are\nforced to work for wealthier herder households in exchange for food.\n\n\f65\n\nAppendix 6, page 1\n\nMECHANISMS AND CONDITIONS FOR THE CREDIT LINE\n\nA. \n\nThe Credit Line\n\nThe  investment  Project  of  the  Agriculture  Sector  Development  Program  will  comprise  a  credit\n1.\ncomponent  designed  to  support  short-term  finance  by  providing  a  credit  line  for  participating  financial\ninstitutions  (PFIs).  The  credit  component  will  be  open  to  participation  by  both  banks  and  nonbank\nfinancial  institutions  (NBFIs)  that  meet  specified  eligibility  criteria.  The  credit  component  will  be\nimplemented in the provinces of Darhan-Uul, Dzavhan, Gobialtay, Hovd, Selenge, and Urs. The credit\nline  will  amount  to  $5.5 million  equivalent.  ADB  will  finance  $4.4  million  equivalent,  and  the  PFIs  will\ncontribute  the  remaining  $1.1  million  equivalent,  or  20 percent  of  the  credit  line,  from  their  own\nresources.  In  accordance  with  the  implementation  period  of  the  Project,  the  duration  of  the  credit\ncomponent  will  be  five  years.  Utilization  of  the  special  project  account  beyond  the  fifth  year  will  be\ndiscussed by ADB and the Government during project implementation.\n\n2.\nUnder the steering committee of the Project, a working group comprising representatives of the\nMinistry  of  Food  and  Agriculture  (MFA),  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Economy  (MFE),  and    Bank  of\nMongolia (BOM), and with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) as an observer, will be established. It\nwill  be  chaired  by  the  MFA  representative.  The  director  of  the  project  management  unit  (PMU)  will\nserve  as  secretary  of  the  working  group.  The  working  group  will  be  responsible  for  approving    banks\nand  NBFIs  as  PFIs  under  the  credit  component,  and  for  ensuring  that  the  PFIs  continue  to  meet  the\neligibility  criteria.  To  participate  in  the  credit  component  a  bank  or  NBFI  must  receive  unanimous\napproval of  the working group. The decision will then be sent through MFE to ADB for approval within\na one-month period on a no-objection basis. The working group will also be responsible for authorizing\nwithdrawals from the special project account for subloan financing, which will be disbursed by the PFIs,\nand for ensuring the subsequent loan recovery from the PFIs to the special project account.\n\nB. \n\nRelending Mechanisms\n\n1. \n\nFlow of Funds\n\n3.\nFollowing the approval of a PFI, BOM will enter into a subsidiary loan agreement with the PFI.\nThe  agreements  with  PFIs  will  be  subject  to  agreement  by  ADB,  on  a  no-objection  basis,  and  will\ninclude terms and conditions relevant to the credit line. The maturity of loans to the PFIs will initially not\nexceed one year, i.e., they will be equivalent to the maximum term of subloans to subborrowers. Later\nduring  project  implementation,  the  working  group,  with  ADB  approval,  may  decide  to  extend  the\nmaturity of loans to PFIs and to subborrowers.\n\n4.\nThe PFIs will onlend funds to eligible subborrowers and then refinance these from the special\nproject  account.  However,  to  expand  the  value  of  funds  available  and  to  encourage  PFI  participation\nand commitment to recovery, the PFIs will be required to make a contribution from their own resources\namounting to 20 percent of each subloan. Subloan approvals are expected to initially be constrained by\nthe number of financial institutions meeting the eligibility criteria and requirements to develop advisory\nand disbursement mechanisms.\n\n5.\nThe PFIs will carry all credit risk and will be fully responsible for recoveries and for repayments\nto the Government. The PFIs will therefore choose the most creditworthy of the qualified subborrowers,\nnegotiate  the  most  appropriate  subloan  structure,  monitor  the  progress  of  each  project/activity,  and\nensure  collection  of  each  subloan.  They  will  have  responsibility  for  ensuring  that  subborrowers  meet\ntheir obligations. The PFIs will  repay to the special project account each subloan when it is collected\nfrom the subborrower.\n\n\f66\n\nAppendix 6, page 2\n\n2.\n\nInitial Eligibility Criteria for Participating Financial Institutions\n\n6.\nFinancial institutions must have the approval for lending in at least one of the six provinces, and\nhave a branch network at the provincial and preferably also at the district level. They will be thoroughly\nexamined to ensure that they are in compliance with the eligibility criteria at the time of assessment of\neligibility. Throughout the project period, the PMU, in cooperation with BOM, will identify potential PFIs\nand  undertake  the  first  assessment.  Based  on  that,  the  working  group  will  make  a  decision  on  the\neligibility of the respective financial institution. The eligibility criteria for PFIs are shown in Table A6.\n\nTable A6: Eligibility Criteria for PFIs to Participate in the Credit Line\n\nCriteria\n\nNotes\n\n1.

In addition, for continued eligibility, each PFI will be\nexpected to\n\n(i)\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nhave given at least 10 subloans to eligible subborrowers in the six provinces within half a\nyear after concluding the subsidiary loan agreement;\n\nhave extended at least 50 subloans to eligible subborrowers in the six provinces within\neach full year of implementation; and\n\nhave  no  more  than  10  percent  of  the  subloan  portfolio  under  the  credit  line  in\nnonperforming status.\n\n8.\nIf a PFI is found to not be in compliance with the general eligibility criteria and with the ongoing\neligibility  criteria,  MFE,  through  the  working  group  and  with  the  prior  approval  of  ADB,  will  determine\nwhether the PFI concerned (i) will prepare and implement a plan of action with the objective to reach\ncompliance with the criteria, or (ii) will be excluded from the Project. Any PFI that is not in compliance\nfor more than a quarter will be automatically excluded from the Project. If a PFI is excluded from the\nProject,  the  PFI  will  pay  back  to  the  special  project  account  all  funds  made  available  through  the\nProject.\n\nC. \n\nTerms and Conditions for Relending\n\nCurrently, no satisfactory benchmark has been set to determine the rate of interest for relending\n\n9.\nto the PFIs.1 The annual cost of funds to the PFIs will be based on the following:\n\ncost to the Government of ADB funds: 1 percent per annum;\n\ncost  of  Government  institutions  administering  the  relending  mechanism:  allowance  of\n1 percent per annum;\n\nforeign exchange risk and interest rate fluctuations: allowance of 2 percent per annum;\nand\n\n                                                \n1 Other  institutions  have  experienced  the  same  problem.  The  World  Bank\u2019s  Private  Sector  Development  loan,  for  example,\n\nuses a formula based on LIBOR. This formula is currently being reconsidered at the request of the Government.\n\n\f68\n\nAppendix 6, page 4\n\n(iv) \n\ninflation: allowance of 6 percent per annum.2\n\n10.\nThe cost of funds to PFIs will be 10 percent per year, approximately equivalent to the internal\ncost  of  funds  of  commercial  banks;  deposit  rates  currently  amount  to  about  0.8 percent  per  month  or\n9.6 percent  per  year.3  The  cost  of  funds  will  be  subject  to  review  by  the  working  group  at  six-month\nintervals.\n\nD. \n\nOnlending Mechanisms\n\nThe potential subborrowers will be previous and new customers of the PFIs in the six provinces.\n\n11.\nThey may be individuals, enterprises, or cooperatives. A subborrower will be required to\n\n(i) \n\nbe a private entity;\n\n(ii) \n\nhave a transparent and documented ownership structure;\n\n(iii) \n\nbe resident in one of the six provinces; and\n\n(iv) \n\nuse  the  subloan  for  a  project/activity  that  is  primarily  agriculture  related  (production,\nprocessing, marketing, or service provision) and primarily based in the six provinces.\n\nThe  project  implementation  units  (PIUs)  in  the  provinces4  will  be  responsible  for  ensuring  that\n12.\nthese conditions are satisfied. In addition, the PIUs will be required to ensure that the subloans are not\nused  for  refinancing  or  takeover  loans,  consumer  loans,  environmentally  damaging  projects,  or  the\npurchase or development of real estate.\n\n13.\nThe PFI will submit a request for endorsement to the respective PIU. This request will provide\nevidence  of  residency  and  provide  details  of  the  location  and  type  of  the  project/activity  as  well  as\nevidence  that  the  PFI  is  in  compliance  with  the  applicable  environmental  laws  and  requirements  of\nMongolia  and  ADB.  The  request  will  not  include  any  financial  information.  The  PFI  will  be  solely\nresponsible  for  evaluating  the  viability  of  the  project/activity  and  the  reliability  of  the  potential\nsubborrower.\n\nThe  subloans  will  operate  within  the  approval  structure  of  the  PFIs,  but  approval  should  be\n14.\nmade as close to the subborrower as possible, preferably at the level of subbranches in the districts.\nIndividual  responsibility  and  accountability  of  PFI  staff  will  be  preferred  to  credit  committee\nresponsibility. Those responsible for loan appraisal and approval will also be responsible for recovery,\npartly to build up banking relationships, partly to relate accountability to performance assessment.\n\n15.\nInitially subloans will be for a maximum of one year, but related to revenue generation periods.\nThe onlending interest rates to subborrowers will be determined by the PFI based on the actual cost of\nlending.  The  subloan  conditions  will  be  sensitive  to  the  seasonal  character  of  agricultural  activity  in\nMongolia. In the first two years of their involvement in the Project, PFIs will have authority to approve\nindividual loans of up to $10,000 equivalent. Loans in excess of this will require approval by ADB. In the\nremaining three years of the Project the ceiling may be increased. The PFIs in any of the six provinces\nwill not be able to draw down more than 25 percent of the credit line during the project period.\n\nThe PFIs will be required to retain their records of each subloan for at least five years after the\n\n16.\nsubloan is given. The PMU and ADB may review and audit these records on a random basis.\n\n                                                \n2 In 1999 the annual inflation fluctuated between 4  and 10 percent; rate is expected to decline during the project.\n3  The refinancing rate of commercial banks with BOM currently amounts to 3-4 percent per month.\n4  Under the Project, a PIU will be established in each of the provinces of Dzavhan, Gobialtay, Hovd, and Urs. For Darhan-Uul\n\nand Selenge provinces, a separate credit office will be established in the provincial capital of Darhan-Uul.\n\n\f69\n\nAppendix 7, page 1\n\nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN\n\nTable A7.1: Project Cost Summary by Component\n($ \u2019000)\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\n Total\n  Cost\n\n Foreign\nExchange\n(percent)\n\nTotal Base\nCost\n(percent)\n\n  Item\n\nA.

The  ASDP  is  supporting  the\ndevelopment  of  the  cooperative  system  as  cooperatives  offer  the  most  promising  avenue  for\ncollective  action  in  rural  areas,  including  increased  income-earning  activities  by  providing\nmarketing and other services to members. The limiting factors for improving livestock productivity\nare  veterinary  services,  water,  and  fodder.  The  investment  Project  will  help  improve  veterinary\nservices through the veterinary services subcomponent, and expand water supply in pasture areas\nthrough  the  well  rehabilitation  subcomponent.  Well  rehabilitation  is  expected  to  open  up  pasture\nareas that are currently not used due to a lack of water. The distribution of water supply points is\nclosely linked to grazing patterns, and the choice of wells to be rehabilitated needs to be made by\ntaking into account the pasture use that is likely to result. The TA will provide capacity building that\nwill  be  a  prerequisite  for  the  successful  implementation  of  the  cooperative  development\nsubcomponent and the well rehabilitation subcomponent.\n\nThe  sector  goals  are  to  develop  a  more  market-oriented,  efficient,  and  sustainable\n2.\nagriculture sector, and  reduce  poverty by providing increased income opportunities. The purpose\nof the TA is to contribute to these goals by providing capacity building in the areas of cooperative\ntraining  and  sustainable  pasture  management.  The  TA  activities  will  focus  on  the  four  western\nprovinces:  Dzavhan,  Gobialtay,  Hovd,  and  Urs.  The  objectives  of  the  TA  component  on\ncooperative  training  are  to  train  cooperative  advisory  staff  who  will  then  provide  advice  to\ncooperatives on how to improve their activities, and to improve the institutional setup for providing\nincreased  advice  to  cooperatives  (which  will  be  part  of  the  subcomponent  on  cooperative\ndevelopment).  The  TA  component  covers  support  for  (i)  developing  training  programs  and\nmaterials,  (ii)  training  cooperative  advisory  staff  at  the  recently  established  Cooperative  Training\nCenter in Ulaanbaatar, including 60 trainers and business consultants (20 from the national level\nand 10 from each of the four western provinces), and 20 auditors and accountants (4 from each of\nthe  four  western  provinces  and  6  from  other  provinces),  and  (iii)  improving  the  facilities  of  the\nCooperative  Training  Center,  and  setting  up  provincial  cooperative  promotion  centers  in  the\ncapitals of the four western provinces.\n\nThe objectives of the TA component on sustainable pasture management are to (i) support\n3.\nthe  implementation  of  the  1995  Land  Law,  which  tasks  district  governments  to  formulate  and\napprove  land  management  plans  in  their  territory,  and  (ii)  by  doing  so,  pilot  test  alternative\napproaches  for  improving  grazing  patterns  based  on  pasture  comanagement  arrangements\nbetween government staff and herder groups. The TA component covers support for (i) identifying\ncurrent winter and summer pasture uses; (ii) collecting information on the use of wells, and data on\ninoperative wells (which will feed into the subcomponent on well rehabilitation); (iii) identifying and\ntraining  herder  groups  who  use  particular  pasture  areas  and  wells;  (iv)  providing  training  to\nprovincial and district staff involved in land management; (v) exploring the feasibility of setting up\ndistrict  pasture  comanagement  units  and  provincial  comanagement  committees  to  advise  the\nrespective governor on formulating land management plans; and (vi) designing and implementing\nland management plans in selected areas.\n\nB.\n\nCost Estimates\n\n4.\nThe total cost of the TA is estimated at $817,100 equivalent, of which the foreign exchange\ncost  is  $479,230  and  the  local  currency  cost  $337,870  equivalent.  The  Asian  Development  Bank\n\n\f75\n\nAppendix 11, page 2\n\n(ADB)  will  finance  $695,000  equivalent,  comprising  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $215,770\nequivalent  of  the  local  currency  cost.  The  financing  will  be  provided  on  a  grant  basis  from  the\nJapan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the  Government  of  Japan.  The  grant  financing  constitutes  85\npercent  of  the  total  TA  cost.  The  cooperatives  and  the  Government  will  finance  $122,100\nequivalent or 15 percent of the total TA cost (Table A11).\n\nC.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n5.\nThe  Executing  Agency  of  the  TA  will  be  the  Ministry  of  Food  and  Agriculture  (MFA).  The\nASDP  steering  committee  will  also  oversee  TA  implementation  and  review  the  TA  reports.  The\ncooperative  associations  will  provide  counterpart  staff  for  the  component  on  cooperative  training,\nand  the  provincial  governments  for  the  component  on  sustainable  pasture  management.  The\ninternational consulting services will be provided by a firm in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on\nthe Use of Consultants. The domestic consultants will be recruited by the firm in accordance with\nprocedures acceptable to ADB. The TA will provide a total of 160 person-months of international\n(15)  and  domestic  (145)  consulting  services.  Under  the  component  on  cooperative  training,  the\ninternational  consultants  include  an  expert  for  developing  the  training  program  and  materials  (1\nperson-month), a trainer of cooperative trainers and business consultants (2 person-months), and\na trainer of cooperative auditors and accountants (6 person-months). The domestic consultants will\nhave  expertise  in  similar  areas  as  the  international  consultants,  and  will  also  include  interpreters\n(25  person-months).  Under  the  component  on  sustainable  pasture  management,  the  consulting\nservices  include  an  international  pasture  management  specialist  (6  person-months),  and  two\ndomestic pasture management specialists (120 person-months).\n\nD.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n6.\nBoth TA components will commence simultaneously with implementation of the investment\nProject.  The  component  on  cooperative  training  will  be  implemented  in  year  1  and  2,  and  the\ncomponent on sustainable pasture management from year 1 to 5.\n\nTable A11: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n($)\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal\nCost\n\nItem\nA.

Furthermore, any financial and economic analysis to the credit\ncomponent can only be indicative because subborrowers are free\u2014indeed encouraged\u2014to use\nthe  money  they  obtain  for  the  most  productive  use  available  to  them  in  their  agricultural\nproduction or processing enterprises.\n\nNonetheless, ample evidence exists, as presented in this appendix, that the investment\n2.\nProject  of  the  ASDP  will  be  profitable  for  individual  herders  and  crop  producers,  and  will\ngenerate new wealth for the economy of Mongolia well in excess of the ADB cut-off rate of 12\npercent.  Analyses  are  presented  for  the  project  components  and  subcomponents  addressing\nlivestock  production  (including  veterinary  services,  well  rehabilitation,  and  in  part  rural\ncommunication  links),  cooperative  development,  the  Green  Revolution  Program,  and  credit  to\npurchase  improved  seed  for  wheat  production,  all  of  which  are  independently  financially  and\neconomically viable.\n\n3.\nThe  Project  will  contribute  to  agricultural  growth  and  poverty  reduction  primarily  by\nincreasing incomes of agricultural producers. By supporting a production and marketing support\ncomponent  combined  with  a  credit  component,  the  Project  will  help  increase  productivity  and\nprofitability  in  herder  and  crop  producing  households  in  four  western  provinces,  including\nDzavhan,  Gobialtay,  Hovd,  and  Urs.  In  addition,  the  credit  component  will  support  increased\nwheat  production and  productivity as well as other crop and livestock production in two north-\ncentral provinces, including Darhan-Uul and Selenge.\n\nB. \n\nProject Alternatives\n\nIn consultation with the Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MFA) and its predecessor the\n4.\nMinistry  of  Agriculture  and  Industry,  various  alternatives  for  the  location  and  design  of  the\nProject were considered during project preparation. The choice of including four of the country\u2019s\nlowest  income  provinces  in  the  western  part  of  Mongolia  was  made  because  since  the\nbeginning of the transition most development has been taking place in the central region around\nUlaanbaatar.  Also  selecting  provinces  within  one  region  allows  for  close  consultation  among\nstakeholders and joint activities, while keeping travel times and costs at a minimum.\n\nThe  livestock  subsector  dominates  the  rural  economy  of  the  four  western  provinces.\n5.\nEven though the herd size increased by more than 20 percent during the last decade, incomes\nare very constrained. This is mainly due to (i) low productivity caused by low input use, with the\nmajor  contributing  factors  being  the  lack  of  cash  and  credit,  limited  veterinary  input,  and  high\nstocking rates (sheep equivalent units per hectare) aggravated by a large number of inoperative\nstock-watering facilities; as well as (ii) marketing bottlenecks and the lack of market information.\nThe Project is designed to address these critical issues. The cooperative system is considered\nto be the most promising channel to improve marketing in remote rural areas because a large\nstructure of primary cooperatives is  already in place and is in the process of being developed\nwith  the  support  of  the  Government  and  development  agencies  such  as  the  Deutsche\nGesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ).\n\n\f77\n\nAppendix 12, page 2\n\n6.\nIn  the  crop  subsector,  the  Government\u2019s  Green  Revolution  Program  has  supported\nhorticultural  production  to  improve  food  security  and  diversify  incomes.  In  the  four  western\nprovinces,  the  activity  was  mainly  taken  up  by  households  close  to  the  provincial  and  district\ncenters  where  unemployment  is  high,  and  by  vulnerable  groups  with  small  herds  that  graze\naround these centers. Especially after the livestock disaster of the winter 1999/2000, horticulture\nproduction has become an important activity for these groups to augment food reserves and to\nbarter  for  livestock  and  livestock  products,  and  was  therefore  included  as  a  project\nsubcomponent.\n\nResponding  to  Government  concerns  about  declining  wheat  production,  the  Project\u2019s\n7.\ncredit  component  includes  the  two  important  wheat-producing  provinces  of  Darhan-Uul  and\nSelenge.  This  will  allow  wheat  producers  to  borrow  to  purchase  improved  seed  and  perhaps\nsimple tillage equipment, or seed cleaners to clean seed from wheat saved by them to be used\nin the following season.\n\nC. \n\nDemand Analysis\n\n8.\nThe  subcomponents  addressing  the  livestock  subsector  will  result  in  additional\nproduction of fiber (cashmere and wool), hides and skins, and meat. Demand for cashmere by\nthe world market is considerable, with the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) being the largest\nimporter  of  Mongolian  cashmere.  In  recent  years,  the  price  of  cashmere  has  been  very\nfavorable.  Exports  of  cashmere  increased  from  400  tons  in  1990  to  2,000  tons  in  1999.  One\nresult of the strong export demand for cashmere has been an increase in the proportion of goats\nin livestock herds leading  to concerns in some areas of overgrazing since goats crop grasses\nmore  closely  than  other  livestock  species.  The  increased  production  of  meat  arising  from  the\nProject is not projected to be large enough to influence domestic prices. Up until the mid-1990s,\nthe four western provinces exported meat mainly to the Russian Federation and in some cases\nto the PRC. Export of meat to the PRC is currently not permitted because it is not included in\nthe  current  trade  agreement  with  the  PRC.  The  Project  will  train  veterinarians  in  international\nstandards of slaughter hygiene. Once the slaughter hygiene can meet international standards,\nexports are expected to increase, especially to the substantial Siberian market.\n\nThe  Project \n\nincludes  significant  support \n\nfor  cooperatives,  especially  secondary\n9.\ncooperatives, to serve the needs of herder households in the four western provinces. This builds\non an existing widespread cooperative structure, although the cooperatives vary widely in their\neffectiveness. Almost all agricultural cooperatives are primary cooperatives whose members are\nherder households or individual herders. Agricultural cooperatives purchase agricultural produce\nfrom  their  members,  including  cashmere,  sheep,  and  camel  wool,  livestock,  hides,  and  meat,\nand sell them to mostly large processors. Cooperatives compete with rural traders from within\nMongolia  and  from  the  PRC  who,  especially  in  the  case  of  cashmere,  currently  purchase  at\nrelatively high prices but with little regard for product quality, and a high level of uncertainty for\nproducers.  In  this  situation,  cooperatives  can  be  successful  in  providing  marketing  with\nreasonable  prices  and  a  high  degree  of  certainty  for  members.  When  purchasing  from  their\nmembers,  cooperatives  can  take  quality  aspects  into  consideration,  thereby  providing  price\nincentives for improving product quality. Rural households have a high demand for staple food\nitems,  such  as  flour,  sugar,  tea,  and  household  goods,  which  they  usually  obtain  from  rural\ntraders in relatively unfavorable barter exchanges for agricultural produce. Besides the supply of\nbasic consumer goods, cooperatives can also play an important role in organizing the supply of\nnecessary inputs for production activities, such as bulk purchase of winter fodder.\n\n10.\nMany  unutilized  opportunities  for  cooperative  processing  of  agricultural  raw  materials\nremain, especially for meat, cashmere, and wool. The  cooperatives report  the  main  constraint\n\n\f78\n\nAppendix 12, page 3\n\nfor increasing their marketing and processing activities is their difficulty in accessing short-term\ncredit,  although  they  also  need  substantial  staff  training  to  become  more  active  and  effective.\nUnder  the  circumstances,  considerable  demand  is  anticipated  for  the  credit  and  cooperative\ndevelopment activities of the Project.\n\nis  an  effort \n\nfour  western  provinces.  The  Green  Revolution  Program \n\nThe Project will support an expansion of the Government's Green Revolution Program in\n11.\nthe \nto  provide\nsupplementary  income  to  low-income  families  through  assistance  with  vegetable,  and  recently\nto  some  extent  with  fruit,  production,  and  is  active  in  all  provinces  of  Mongolia.  The  Green\nRevolution Program in a province includes at least one agropark, which is a small area used for\ndemonstration and training. Small cultivators are instructed in how to produce vegetables used\nfor  home  consumption  and  for  sale.  Characteristically,  the  small  cultivators  have  about  0.3\nhectares (ha) at their disposal, often in small compounds surrounding their homes. If they do not\nhave  a  small  plot  available,  they  may  receive  a  land  allotment  from  the  provincial  or  district\nadministration.  They  may  receive  the  right  to  cultivate  the  plot  at  no  cost,  or  they  may  pay  a\nsmall rental. The Green Revolution Program is extremely variable, and quite different elements\nare  found  in  different  provinces.  It  has,  however,  been  quite  popular,  especially  with  lower\nincome families. In Hovd, which has the most advanced Green Revolution Program of the four\nwestern  provinces,  for  example,  out  of  18,000  agricultural  households  in  the  province,  some\n14,000  participate  in  the  program  to  some  extent.  With  such  a  high  participation  rate,  the\nreorientation and expansion of the program supported by the Project will find a ready welcome.\n\n12.\nThe credit component, a significant part of the Project, reflects the substantial demand\nfor  credit  from  agricultural  producers.  When  herders  and  crop  farmers  were  interviewed,  they\ninvariably mentioned the shortage of working capital and many mentioned a shortage of longer-\nterm  investment  capital.  In  every  interview  with  either  herders  or  crop  farmers\u2014from  the\nsmallest producers to the largest\u2014the respondents said they would borrow from a participating\nfinancial institution (PFI) if credit was available. The fact that the banking system in recent years\nhad  lent  little  for  agricultural  production  reflects  problems  of  bank  management  and  lending\nskills, not a lack of demand. The results of a study of the rural finance system funded by Japan\nInternational  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA)  was  circulated  in  March  2000.  The  study  found  that\nalmost  a  quarter  of  rural  households  of  all  types  had  a  bank  account,  a  remarkably  high\nproportion for a country at the economic development stage of Mongolia. One reason for this is\nthat an account is needed to receive pension and other social security transfers. Also, the rural\nadministration staff is paid through the banking system, and many lower level civil servants are\nalso  agricultural  producers.  The  JICA  study  also  reported  that  some  80  percent  of  the\nrespondents  said  they  were  in  \u201curgent\u201d  need  of  reliable  financial  services,  including  credit.\nManagers of local branches of both Post Bank and Agricultural Bank in the western provinces,\nand the banks and nonbank financial institutions in the north-central provinces, neither of which\nhave  been  lending  much  to  agricultural  producers  recently,  said  they  looked  forward  to\nresumption or expansion of lending in rural areas. In a workshop in Ulaanbaatar for commercial\nbanks,  the  financial  institutions  expressed  an  interest  in  participating  in  the  Project\u2019s  credit\ncomponent.\n\nIncreased  wheat  production  arising  from  credit  for  improved  seeds  and  equipment  will\n13.\nmeet  a  ready  market.  Both  the  area  sown  to  wheat  and  the  production  of  wheat  have  fallen\nsharply  under  the  transition  economy.  In  1989,  the  area  sown  to  wheat  was  530,100  ha  and\nproduction  was  686,900  tons.  However,  this  large  area  and  production  was  only  possible  by\nbringing  land  under  cultivation  that  was  not  able  to  support  a  sustainable  wheat  production\nregime,  and  by  very  large  subsidies  for  agricultural  inputs.  Under  the  transition  economy,  a\nmore  economically  viable  and  ecologically  more  sustainable  wheat  production  system  has\nbecome  established.  By  1999,  the  area  sown  had  fallen  to  273,100  ha  and  production  had\n\n\f79\n\nAppendix 12, page 4\n\ndeclined to 166,700 tons. In 2000, production  has recovered somewhat, and estimates are that\nsome  200,000  tons  of  wheat  have  been  produced.  The  low  level  of  wheat  production  and  the\ncontinuing  rise  in  wheat  and  flour  imports  to  supply  domestic  demand  has  led  to  growing\nGovernment  concern  about  food  security  and  was  one  reason  for  including  the  provinces  of\nDarhan-Uul and Selenge in the credit component. Increased wheat production arising from the\nProject  will  replace  imported  flour,  mainly  that  coming  from  the  PRC.  Per  capita  wheat\nconsumption, about 105 kilograms (kg) to 110 kg per capita in the latter part of the 1980s, has\nnow  stabilized  at  about  100  kg  per  capita.  This  places  the  country\u2019s  annual  requirement  for\nwheat flour at 240,000 tons. Flour recovery in Mongolian mills is about 73 percent, so that the\ncountry  would  require  about  330,000  tons  of  wheat  to  satisfy  its  flour  demand.  Adding  the\ndemand for seed and from the alcohol industry, the total demand for wheat in Mongolia is about\n390,000 tons a year, much beyond any anticipated domestic wheat production. Ample capacity\nexists to mill the increased production arising from the Project.\n\nD. \n\nFinancial and Economic Analysis\n\n1. \n\nLivestock Production\n\n14.\nAn  analysis  was  conducted  to  determine  the  financial  and  economic  rate  of  return  to\nlivestock  production  under  the  Project.  The  analysis  was  based  on  an  indicative  herder\nhousehold model presented in Table A12.1.\n\nMajor  Assumptions.  The  major  assumptions  used  in  the  analysis  of  livestock\n\n15.\nproduction include the following:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nAll values are expressed in local currency in constant 2000 prices. Nominal 2000\nmarket prices were used in the financial analysis.\n\nThe prices of tradable commodities were determined as border prices based on\nmarket  prices  in  Ulaanbaatar,  and  those  of  other  commodities  were  based  on\ndomestic market prices as of 2000.\n\nThe  analysis  was  based  on  a  comparison  of  the  with  and  without  project\nsituations over 20 years. An exchange rate of MNT1,075 per dollar was applied\nas the rate prevailing during project appraisal.\n\n(iv) \n\nFor  nontraded  goods  and  services,  a  standard  conversion  factor  (SCF)  of  0.9\nwas used.\n\n16.\nThe project cost estimates in Appendix 7 were the basis of the financial analysis. After\ndeducting  price  contingencies,  estimated  costs  for  the  livestock  production  were  converted  to\neconomic  prices  by  subtracting  transfer  payments  and  applying  the  SCF  to  all  local  currency\ncosts.  The  incremental  operating  costs  for  livestock  production  were  based  on  estimates\nprovided by representatives of MFA and cooperative associations.\n\n17.\nLivestock  Benefits.  Livestock  production  will  provide  significant  quantifiable  and\nnonquantifiable  benefits  that  will  directly  contribute  to  the  goals  of  agricultural  growth  and\npoverty reduction.\n\n18.\nThe  financial  and  economic  analysis  focuses  on  quantifiable  direct  benefits  to  herder\nhouseholds.

This  is particularly the case\nwith  improved  livestock  health  through  the  use  of  drenches  and  dips  and  other  veterinary  inputs.\nProductivity  gains  are  expected  to  be  obtained  by  about  2,300  herder  households  in  year  2  of  the\nProject, and about 6,000 herder households by year 6 from a total of about 50,000 herder households\nin  the  four  western  provinces.  The  data  on  herder  households  benefits  and  costs  derived  from\nproductivity  gains  are  based  on  discussions  with  herders,  veterinarians,  and  representatives  of\nprovincial governments, and are relatively conservative estimates.\n\nNonquantifiable  benefits  associated  with  the  livestock  production-related  activities  under  the\n19.\nProject  will  arise  from  improved  grazing  patterns  through  the  well  rehabilitation  subcomponent.  The\nenvironmental  benefits  resulting  from  reduced  pressure  on  pastures  may  be  significant  in  the  longer                  \nterm, but are difficult to quantify based on the data currently available.\n\n20.\nTable  A12.2  shows  the  financial  and  economic  analysis  for  the  subcomponents  related  to\nlivestock  production.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  is  estimated  at  28  percent,  and  the\nresulting net present value (NPV), discounted at 12 percent, is MNT2,378 million. The financial rate of\nreturn  to  the  individual  herder  households  was  not  estimated  directly,  but  is  well  above  the  financial\nreturn to the sector as a whole because several of the sector costs, including some veterinary services,\nwell rehabilitation, and rural communications links, directly benefit herders but are not expected to be\nrecovered  in  full  from  them.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  is  38  percent.  The  resulting\nNPV, discounted at 12 percent, shows that about MNT3,792 million will be generated for the economy.\nThe EIRR is higher than the FIRR because the value of the incremental livestock production is priced at\nborder prices, while much of the supporting services are nontraded.\n\nResults of a sensitivity analysis presented in Table A12.3 (p. 83) indicate the EIRRs remain high\n21.\ndespite  significant  changes  in  key  variables,  including  increased  costs,  reduced  benefits,  or  a\ncombination of adverse conditions. Switching values for the EIRR to equal 12 percent indicate that the\nEIRR is relatively insensitive either to increased costs or decreased benefits.\n\n2. \n\nCooperative Development\n\nPromotion of cooperatives, especially secondary cooperatives, is an important subcomponent of\n22.\nthe Project. Through the secondary cooperatives, herders will command higher prices for their output\nbringing an immediate income gain. Another advantage is that herders will be able to sell their animals\nat the end of the summer season instead of early in the season, so that they will be able to realize the\nadvantage of a weight gain as a result of good summer pasture.\n\n23. \n\nThe investment in cooperatives proves to be quite profitable financially and good economically,\neven with very low participation rates. To test the financial and economic return to cooperatives,\nthe  incremental  income  accruing  to  herder  households  from  marketing  through  cooperatives\nwas  taken  as  the  benefit  stream.  Herder  households  who  would  market  through  the\ncooperatives  were  assumed  to  be  those  who  had  sufficient  initiative  to  take  advantage  of  the\nproductivity gains made possible by the livestock household\u2019s production subcomponents. Thus\nthe  benefit  stream  was  the  increment  between  a  herder  household\u2019s  income  with  productivity\ngain but without cooperative marketing, as opposed to the income with the productivity gain and\nalso  marketing  through  the  cooperatives.  Only  half  the  herder  households  benefiting  from  the\nproductivity gains under the Project were assumed to also market through cooperatives.\n\n\f82\n\n Appendix 12, page 7\n\nTable A12.2: Financial and Economic Internal Rate of Return to Livestock Production\n\nItem\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10-20\n\nYear  \n6\n\n          Incremental Net Benefit (MNT '000)\nFinancial Internal Rate of Return \nNet Present Value at \n\n     12 percent (MNT million)\n\n28%\n\n2,378\n\nA.

With these assumptions, the FIRR is estimated to be 41 percent, and the EIRR to be 22\npercent, as shown in Table A12.4 (p. 84). The difference between the two arises because meat\nproducts  from  secondary  cooperatives  are  assumed  to  command  a  quality  premium  at  the\ndomestic market but not at the international markets. Economic prices are thus somewhat lower\nthan the financial prices, and the benefit from an incremental gain is less. In contrast, the costs\nof  the  Project  are  not  very  different  in  the  financial  and  economic  analyses,  meaning  that  the\nincremental  benefit  in  the  economic  analysis  is  only  about  40  percent  that  of  the  financial\nanalysis.\n\n25.\nThe results were subjected to a sensitivity analysis, which is given in Table A12.5. This\nshows  the  cooperative  development  subcomponent  to  be  quite  viable  assuming  a  benefit\nreduction of 10 percent or an increase in the cost of the subcomponent by 10 percent.\n\nTable A12.5: Sensitivity Analysis of Cooperative Development\n\n    Scenario\n\nChange\n(percent)\n\nIRR\n(percent)\n\nNPV\n(MNT million)\n\nIRR\n(percent)\n\nNPV\n(MNT million)\n\nFinancial\n\nEconomic\n\nSwitching\nValue\n(percent)\n\n  51\n\n350\n\nSwitching\nValue\n(percent)\n\n23\n\n80\n\n21\n18\n\n21\n\n1,242\n   760\n\n1,194\n\n1.

This can produce about MNT200,000 to\nMNT250,000 worth of vegetables.

A  Green  Revolution  household  will  spend  about\nMNT80,000  for  land  rent,  seed,  fertilizers,  and  pesticides  and  herbicides.  Thus  the  household\nincreases  its  income  by  some  MNT120,000  to  MNT170,000  annually,  of  which  some\nMNT70,000 to MNT120,000 is in cash. In addition, most Green Revolution households have a\nfew head\u2014about 10-15\u2014of livestock, which they feed vegetable by-products and hay cut from\nnatural  grass.  The  livestock  also  graze  near  urban  centers,  or  are  taken  to  high  mountain\npastures  in  the  summer.  The  returns  from  a  Green  Revolution  plot  cannot  provide  sufficient\nincome for a household to live on. The households must have other income. Some participants\nare pensioners, some are casual laborers, and some have minor government posts or work in\nservice industries.\n\n28.\nThe  impact  of  the  Green  Revolution  Program  in  the  aggregate  can  be  significant.  In\nHovd, about half the total vegetables marketed come from households participating in the Green\nRevolution Program and amount to some MNT280 million annually.\n\nThe  subcomponent  on \n\nthe  Green  Revolution  Program  emphasizes \n\nfarmer\n29.\ndemonstrations and domestic travel to enable provincial staff to be able to stay in closer touch\nwith  district  staff,  and  both  staffs  to  be  able  to  visit  participating  households  more  often.  The\nobjective  is  to  broaden  the  range  of  crops  produced  by  participating  households,  including\nlegumes, fruits, and berries, to promote improved small-scale irrigation and greenhouses, and to\nassist  households  to  improve  their  marketing  and  postharvest  processing  either  for  home\nconsumption or for sale.\n\n30. While  a  rate  of  return  cannot  be  calculated  for  the  Green  Revolution  Program\nsubcomponent, financial and economic justification of project effectiveness can be estimated. In\nHovd  province,  for  example,  some  MNT7  million  incremental  annual  expenditure  is  expected.\nThus, production must increase by about 2.5 percent to pay for the incremental cost.\n\n4. \n\nWheat Production\n\nMuch  of  the  credit  to  be  made  available  in  Darhan-Uul  and  Selenge  provinces  is\n\n31.\nexpected to be used to purchase improved seed.\n\n32.\nThe national improved wheat seed production system in Mongolia is largely inoperative.\nHelp to revive the system is being provided by the European Union Technical Assistance to the\nConfederation of Independent States (TACIS) and other assistance agencies. However, at best,\nfirst generation seed (the seed used by producing farmers to produce wheat for milling) will be\navailable in three to four years.\n\nIn  the  meantime,  if  demand  is  sufficient,  the  market  can  supply  improved  wheat  seed\n33.\nimported from Kazakhstan or the Russian Federation. Varieties suitable for other central Asian\nregions  have  been  successfully  used  in  Mongolia.  Although  Mongolia  should  not  depend  on\nimported  wheat  seed  indefinitely,  in  the  interim  between  the  beginning  of  the  Project  and  the\ntime  when  Mongolian  improved  seed  can  be  produced  for  the  market,  imported  seed  can  be\nused.\n\n34.\nImproved seed alone, even in the absence of other inputs, can increase yields by some\n25  percent.  The  basic  computations  for  the  incremental  value  of  increased  production  arising\nfrom improved seed on 1 ha are given in Table A12.6.\n\n\f86\n\nAppendix 12, page 11\n\n                Table A12.6: Incremental Return Per Hectare to Improved Wheat Seed\n\nItem\nArea Devoted to Seed Multiplication (15 percent)\nSeed Needed for 0.15 ha at 200 kg/ha\nCost of Imported Improved Seed at MNT183,000/ton\nEstimated Incremental Production per ha (0.8 ton/ha x 0.25)\nArea Planted to Wheat for Production (85 percent)\nIncremental Production (0.2 ton x 0.85 ha)\nFinancial Value of Wheat at Farm Gate\nValue of Incremental Production (0.175 ton x MNT100,000)\n\nAmount\n0.15 ha\n30 kg\nMNT5,490\n0.2 ton/ha\n0.85 ha\n0.175 ton\nMNT100,000/ton\nMNT17,500\n\nha = hectare, kg = kilogram.\nSource: Staff estimates.\n\n35. When  improved  seed  is  used,  the  production  system  common  in  Darhan-Uul  and\nSelenge is for farmers to purchase improved seed sufficient for about 15 percent of their sown\narea.  This,  in  turn,  is  harvested  and  saved  to  provide  seed  for  the  rest  of  the  farm  in  the\nfollowing  year.  Thus,  once  the  process  is  established,  farmers  will  buy  improved  seed  every\nyear for 15 percent of their sown area. Improved seed currently sells for about MNT183,000 a\nton.  The  seeding  rate  is  about  200  kg/ha.  Thus  the  cost  of  improved  seed  needed  is  about\nMNT5,490/ha. The area planted to wheat to be sold for milling on a per ha basis is the area not\ndevoted  to  seed  production,  or  0.85  ha.  The  incremental  production  from  improved  seed  is\nabout  200  kg.  The  farm-gate  price  of  wheat  is  currently  about  MNT100,000  per  ton.  Thus  the\nincremental  value  of  wheat  is  about  MNT17,500/ha  and  well  in  excess  of  a  50  percent  FIRR.\nTherefore, an investment of some MNT5,490 leads to an incremental value of production a year\nlater of MNT17,500, or about a 3:1 return.\n\nThe  economic  value  of  incremental  production  will  be  somewhat  higher  than  the\n36.\nfinancial. The imported seed is priced at its border price, but the value of wheat at the farmgate\nis somewhat below the border price because the Government has been releasing food grain aid\nat a relatively low price to limit consumer price rises.\n\n\f87\n\nAppendix 13, page 1\n\nPOVERTY IMPACT ASSESSMENT\n\nA.\n\nPoverty Trends\n\nCauses  of  Poverty.  Until  1990  unemployment  and  poverty  were  virtually  unknown  in\n1.\nMongolia, and inequality was very low. During the initial transition period in the beginning of the\n1990s, the economy contracted sharply due to the withdrawal of Soviet assistance, equivalent\nto  about  30  percent  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP),  and  the  breakup  of  the  trading  system\nwith the member countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance. The collapse in the\nstate  budget  led  to  drastic  cuts  in  subsidies  and  welfare  programs,  and  this  pushed  many\nhouseholds  below  the  poverty  line.  In  addition,  the  economic  restructuring  and  privatization\nprocess  led  to  severe  retrenchment  in  public  sector  employment,  and  to  the  closure  of  many\nnonviable  enterprises.  Although  much  of  the  shed  labor  force  was  absorbed  by  the  extensive\nlivestock  sector  and,  in  part,  by  the  growing  informal  economy,  underemployment  and\nunemployment rose substantially. Furthermore, the privatization program for the collective herds\nresulted  in  many  households  owning  a  below-subsistence  herd  size.  With  reduced  state  and\nprivate  income,  both  formal  and  informal  social  safety  nets  faltered,  and  poverty  levels\nincreased rapidly.\n\n2.\nIncidence of Poverty. Before 1990, poverty was not reported in Mongolia. In 1991 the\nGovernment established a poverty line based on per capita income equivalent required to meet\na  daily  calorie  intake  of  1,872  kilo  calories  (Kcal)  per  capita  in  rural  areas,  and  1,992  Kcal  in\nurban areas. The income-based poverty line was adjusted each year. Based on this measure,\nthe population living below the minimum living standard level was estimated to be 16 percent in\n1991.  By  the  end  of  1998,  the  estimate  was  26  percent.  The  four  western  provinces,  with  the\nexception of Gobialtay, belonged to the poorest areas, with 43 percent of the population living\nbelow the minimum living standard level in Hovd, 41 percent in Dzavhan, and 34 percent in Urs.\nThe estimate for Gobialtay was 16 percent.\n\n3.\nIn 1995, the National Statistical Office in cooperation with the World Bank conducted a\nliving  standards  measurement  survey  (LSMS),  and  introduced  an  expenditure-based  poverty\nline  to  meet  a  calorie  intake  of  2,100  Kcal  per  capita,  comparable  to  the  norm  in  other\ndeveloping countries. According to this survey, 36.3 percent of the population were living below\nthe  poverty  line  in  1995.  In  1998  the  National  Statistical  Office  with  support  of  the  United\nNations  Development  Programme  carried  out  another  LSMS  based  on  a  similar  consumption\nbasket  for  a  daily  calorie  intake  of  2,100  Kcal  per  capita.  According  to  the  1998  survey,  35.6\npercent of the population were below the poverty line, and 19.7 percent were considered to be\nvery poor.1 The key poverty indicators of the 1995 and 1998 surveys are in Table A13.1.\n\n4.\nSome  methodologies  changed  from  the  1995  to  the  1998  LSMS,  making  direct\ncomparison  of  the  two  LSMS  surveys  difficult.  Also,  the  LSMS  surveys  did  not  provide\ndisaggregated  data  by  province.  But  they  showed  that  poverty  is  a  significant  problem  in\nMongolia  and  includes  about  a  third  of  the  population.  Mongolia  is  distinctive  in  that  poverty\ntends  to  be  less  in  rural  areas  than  in  urban  areas;  poverty  is  the  highest  in  the  provincial\ncenters.  Mongolia  is  also  distinctive  as  poverty  is  primarily  income  based,  rather  than  due  to\neducation  or  health  deprivation.  The  failure  of  economic  growth  (which  averaged  3.6  percent\n\n                  \n\n1  The  1998  LSMS  divided  the  population  into  five  categories  based  on  expenditures  to  show  how  poverty  is\ndistributed  between  different  groups:  (i)  very  poor  (less  than  MNT11,005):  19.7  percent;  (ii)  poor  (MNT11,005  to\nMNT14,674):  15.9  percent;  (iii)  not  poor\u2013low  (between  the  poverty  line  and  150  percent  above  the  poverty  line):\n27.0 percent; (iv) not poor\u2013medium (between 150 percent and 225 percent above the poverty line): 21.9 percent;\nand (vi) not poor\u2013upper (more than 225 percent above the poverty line): 15.5 percent.\n\n\f88\n\nAppendix 13, page 2\n\nbetween  1994  and  1998)  to  reduce  poverty  is  a  reflection  of  the  difficulty  of  creating  broad-\nbased income and employment generation activities in a transition economy.\n\nTable A13.1: Key Poverty Indicators\n(1995 and 1998)\n\nPopulation Below\nPoverty Line\n(percent)\n\nNumber of\nPoor People\n(\u2019000)\n\nItem\nAll Mongolia\nUrban\n\n Ulaanbaatar\n Provincial Centers\n\nRural\n\n1995\n36.3\n38.5\n35.1\n41.9\n33.1\n\n1998\n35.6\n39.4\n34.1\n45.2\n32.6\n\n1995\n820.7\n470.5\n214.1\n256.5\n350.1\n\n1998\n862.9\n493.4\n221.3\n272.1\n369.5\n\nDepth of Poverty\n1998\n11.7\n13.9\n13.0\n\u2013\n9.8\n\n1995\n10.9\n12.2\n10.4\n\u2013\n8.9\n\nSeverity of\nPoverty\n\n1995\n4.8\n5.7\n4.5\n\u2013\n3.6\n\n1998\n5.6\n7.1\n7.4\n\u2013\n4.4\n\n\u2013 = not available.\nSource:  National  Statistical  Office  of  Mongolia  and  United  Nations  Development  Programme.  1999.  Living Standards\n\nMeasurement Survey 1998. Ulaanbaatar.\n\n5.\nTable  A13.1  indicates  an  increase  in  the  depth  and  severity  of  poverty  between  1995\nand  1998.  The  depth  is  the  percentage  that  the  average  poor  person's  income  is  below  the\npoverty  line.  The  severity  takes  into  account  the  income  distribution  among  the  poor,  giving\nmore  weight  to  those  who  are  most  below  the  poverty  line.  This  increase  in  the  depth  and\nseverity  of  poverty  corresponds  to  rising  inequality.  Income  inequality  measured  by  the  Gini\ncoefficient  increased  from  0.31  in  1995  to  0.35  in  1998,  but  this  is  still  relatively  low  by\ninternational standards.\n\n6.\nVulnerable  Groups.  According  to  the  LSMS,  poverty  is  particularly  severe  among\nhouseholds  headed  by  women,  the  unemployed,  wage  employees  in  the  social  and\nadministrative  sectors,  and  households  with  small  herds.  These  groups  are  not  mutually\nexclusive. In 1998, 47 percent of the households headed by women were poor, a decline from\n63 percent in 1995. Households headed by women comprised nearly one fifth of all households,\nand were mostly located in Ulaanbaatar and provincial centers. By the end of 1999, the official\nunemployment rate was 5 percent, but hidden unemployment was estimated to be close to 20\npercent.  The  correlation  between  unemployment  and  poverty  is  particularly  strong  in  urban\nareas.  Due  to  a  real  wage  decline,  poverty  is  more  acute  among  wage  employees  and  public\nservants than among people working in the informal or agriculture sector.\n\n7.\nOne of the main reasons for rural poverty is the large number of households with small\nherds.  Although  their  number  is  declining,  in  1999  many  households  with  livestock  still  had\nfewer  than  100  animals,  which  is  generally  considered  the  minimum  size  for  a  self-sustaining\nhousehold. In the four western provinces, the number of households with livestock that owned\nless than 100 animals was 50 percent for Dzavhan, 52 percent in Hovd, and 60 percent in Urs.\nIn  Gobialtay,  which  has  the  lowest  poverty  level  of  the  four  provinces,  only  39  percent  of  all\nhouseholds with livestock had less than 100 animals.\n\nB.\n\nPolicy Actions and Their Impact on the Poor\n\n8.\nA  poverty  impact  assessment  was  conducted  for  the  policy  measures  under  the\nAgriculture Sector Development Program that are anticipated to have significant effects on the\npoor.  They  include  (i)  implementation  of  the  Cooperative  Law  and  Cooperative  Development\nProgram; and (ii) reorientation of the Green Revolution Program. The assessment is presented\nin Tables A13.2 and A13.3.\n\n\fTable A13.2: Impact of the Implementation of the Cooperative Law and Cooperative Development Program\n\nChannel\nLabor Market Nonapplicable or no \n\nDirect\n\neffect\n\nIndirect\n\nMacro\n\nNonpoor\n\nNonapplicable or no \neffect\n\nNonapplicable or no \neffect\n\nNonapplicable or no \neffect\n\nCase 1\n\nCase 2\n\nType of Effect\n\nPrices\n\nAccess for \nPoor\n\nAgricultural producers in \nrural areas receive \nrelatively low prices for \ntheir products and pay \nrelatively high prices for \nsupplies\nSmall herders, especially \nin remote areas, are \ndependent on private \ntraders who may visit a \nfew times a year\n\nLow investment and \nyields in agriculture, \nespecially in the \nlivestock subsector\n\nAgriculture's contribution \nto industrial sector \ngrowth and gross \ndomestic product is \nlimited\n\nNonapplicable or no \neffect\n\nHigh subsistence pro-\nduction combined with \nbarter transactions and \nin-kind wage payment\n\nIncreased poverty in \nrural areas\n\nNonapplicable or no \neffect\n\nDirect\nExpanded marketing and \nprocessing through \ncooperatives may \nincrease demand for \nlabor, especially in \nprovincial and district \ncenters\n\nHigher output prices and \nlower input prices for \ncooperative members\n\nIndirect\n\nNonapplicable or no \neffect\n\nMacro\n\nMore income and \nemployment \nopportunities in rural \nareas\n\nNonpoor\n\nNonapplicable or no \neffect\n\nIncreased investment \nand yields in livestock \nproduction and \nprocessing\n\nHigher output and \ngrowth, especially in the \nfour western provinces\n\nPrivate traders and \nagents of large \nprocessing enterprises \nmay have less profits\n\nCooperative member-\nship is not restricted. \nMany small herders are \nmembers and will profit \nfrom higher returns and \ngreater income security\n\nBetter access to the cash \neconomy may stimulate \ndemand for more \nservices in rural areas\n\nReduced poverty\n\nNonapplicable or no \neffect\n\nTransfers\n\nNonapplicable or no \neffect\n\nNonapplicable or no \neffect\n\nNonapplicable or no \neffect\n\nNonapplicable or no \neffect\n\nNonapplicable or no \neffect\n\nNonapplicable or no \neffect\n\nNonapplicable or no \neffect\n\nNonapplicable or no \neffect\n\nSignificant:\n\nTotal Net Effect\n\nSignificant:\n\nThe majority of the rural population, who comprise nearly half of Mongolian households, depend for \ntheir livelihood on agriculture, mainly extensive livestock production. Their access to markets is \nlimited and their terms of trade unfavorable. Few incentives and channels are available for increased \nagricultural activity and income, which contributes to rural poverty.\n\nIncreased access of small herder households and other vulnerable groups to active and well-\nmanaged cooperatives will provide them with larger returns for their products and enhance their \nparticipation in the rural economy.\n\nAssumptions about Crucial Variables\n\n1. Private traders and agents of large processing enterprises continue to dominate the marketing\n    of agricultural inputs and outputs in rural areas.\n2. Small herders have little information on market prices and very limited options for participating\n    in the market economy.\n\n1. Cooperatives and cooperative associations are able to take advantage of the more favorable\n     environment for cooperative development and expand services to their members.\n2. Existing and new cooperatives are assisted in formulating business plans, applying for credit,\n    and establishing secondary cooperatives.\n3. Cooperatives have access to credit, and are able to compete with private traders.\n\nThe proposal seeks to achieve full implementation of the 1998 Cooperative Law and the 1998 Cooperative Development Program. This will provide a more conducive regulatory framework and support for the organizational \ndevelopment of cooperatives and cooperative association, and contribute to more competitive markets for agricultural inputs, outputs, and processed goods.\n\nBrief Narrative\n\npotential to expand the local organization basis needed for economically viable activities, including the provision of services to members, the delivery of local public goods, and collective income-earning activities such as \n\ndemand for rural services, and in improved health and reduced withdrawal of children from schools in rural areas.\n\ni\n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n3\n,\n \np\na\ng\ne\n \n3\n \n\n\fTable A13.3: Impact of the Reoriented Green Revolution Program\n\nCase 1\n\nCase 2\n\nType of Effect\n\nChannel\nLabor Market Small increase in labor \n\nDirect\n\nIndirect\n\nNonapplicable or no \neffect\n\ninput to horticulture \nproduction, mainly \naround urban centers\n\nMacro\nSlight increase in \nemployment \nopportunities\n\nNonpoor\n\nNonapplicable or no \neffect\n\nDirect\n\nExpanded horticulture \nproduction may increase \ndemand for labor, \nespecially in provincial \nand district centers\n\nIndirect\n\nNonapplicable or no \neffect\n\nMacro\nIncreased employment \nopportunities in \nhorticulture production, \nprocessing, and \nmarketing\n\nNonpoor\n\nNonapplicable or no \neffect\n\nPrices\n\nHighly fluctuating prices \nfor horticultural products \ndue to limited processing \nand marketing\n\nNonapplicable or no \neffect\n\nLimited availability of \nhorticultural products and \nneed for imports\n\nUrban consumers face \nfluctuating prices and \nirregular supplies\n\nThrough improved \nhorticulture processing \nand marketing more \nstable prices\n\nBetter quality , larger \nvariety and increased \nsupply of horticulture \nproducts\n\nHigher food and income \nsecurity, less need for \nvegetable imports\n\nUrban consumers may \nbenefit from improved \nsupplies\n\nAccess for \nPoor\n\nLimited options for risk \nsharing; some \nparticipation in \nhorticulture production\n\nHorticulture in rural \nareas is a means for \nimproving subsistence \nproduction and \ndiversifying income\n\nHorticulture production \ncontributes to food \nsecurity and reduced \npoverty\n\nNonapplicable or no \neffect\n\nIncreased participation of \nvulnerable groups in \nhorticulture production\n\nTransfers\n\nSubsidies through Green \nRevolution Program \nlimited and not targeted\n\nNonapplicable or no \neffect\n\nLittle effect on budget\n\nBetter targeted subsidies Nonapplicable or no \n\nNonapplicable or no \neffect\n\nNonapplicable or no \neffect\n\nReduced poverty\n\nNonapplicable or no \neffect\n\nImproved food security \nand increased income \nand employment \nopportunities may \nstimulate demand for \nrural services\n\neffect\n\nMinor effect on budget, \nwith more emphasis on \ncost recovery in the \nGreen Revolution \nProgram\n\nMinor:\n\nTotal Net Effect\n\nSignificant:\n\nGreen Revolution Program activities have to some extent contributed to improved  food security, \nemployment, and income generation among households around urban centers.\n\nA rise in the participation of vulnerable groups in horticulture production, processing, and marketing \nwill improve their diet and help diversify their income and employment opportunities.\n\nAssumptions about Crucial Variables\n\n1.
