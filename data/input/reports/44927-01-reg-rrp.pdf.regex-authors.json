THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nequity  investment  in  the  Asia  Water  Fund  up  to  $20  million.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \nA.  Economic and Sector Background \n2.  Only 2.5% of the total global water supply is fresh water. Almost 70% of that amount is \npermanently frozen in glaciers and ice caps, leaving readily available surface water at less than \n1% of the world\u2019s water volume. Asia, with 60% of the world\u2019s population, only has access to \n40%1 of that amount, with about 670 million people in the region in 2002 lacking access to \npotable water (about one in five people). 2 With unceasing and growing global demand for clean \nwater\u2014which the World Bank estimates will double every 20 years, in large part driven by \npopulation and economic growth, urbanization, and climate changes in Asia\u2014the need for water \ninfrastructure investments is critical.   \n \n3.  Population  growth. Rapid population growth in Asia and the Pacific over the past \ndecade has led to increasing demand for water and sanitation services. According to the UN \nSecretariat\u2019s database, the population in Asia rose from around 3.7 billion in 2000 to 4.2 billion \nin  2008\u2014an  increase  of  about  500  million  or  13.5%\u2014and  it  is  expected  to  increase  by \n400 million by 2020, nearly a 24% increase from the 2000 level.3 This trend shows the need for \nAsia to accelerate its efforts on water infrastructure development to satisfy the requirement of \nthe projected population in the decades to come. \n \n4.  Economic growth and urbanization. Asia and the Pacific have enjoyed remarkable \neconomic growth in the last decade. For example, according to the National Bureau of Statistics \nof China (NBSC), the urbanization rate in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) was 43.9% in \n2007 and is predicted to be about 60%\u201365% by 2030. However, sanitation and wastewater \ntreatment facilities have not kept pace with the rapid development. The NBSC states that the \nsewage treatment rate in the PRC was only 48.4% in 2005, which is significantly lower than the \nrate of developed economies. To maintain Asia\u2019s current and future economic growth rate, new \nwater infrastructure investments and revamping existing water infrastructure are paramount.  \n \n5.  Pollution  and  climate  changes.  The  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change \n(IPCC) states that 11 of the 12 years to 2006 were the warmest since 1850 in terms of global \nsurface temperature.4 One of the worst effects of this climate change is the occurrence of \nextreme weather events and their impact on water, and incidences of flooding that damage both \nnatural sources of and  infrastructure for potable water in Asia and the Pacific. The sea level rise \nas a result of the melting of glaciers and ice caps in the northern and southern hemispheres has \nled to the intrusion of salt water to fresh water aquifers and consequently exacerbated fresh \nwater scarcity for the large population in Asia. \n \n6.  Opportunity for private sector investments.  The overwhelming amount of investment \nrequired to meet the growing demand for water supply and sanitation in Asia, at a time when \n                                                \n1  Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada (DFAIT Canada). 2009. The Global Water Crisis\u2013A \nQuestion of Governance. Canada:  DFAIT.. \n2  ADB. 2006. Water Knowledge Center, Asia Water Watch 2015.

Available: www.esa.un.org/unpp \n4  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report: Climate Change 2007 (AR4).  Available \nwww.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/publications_and_data_reports.htm#2 ", "2       \n \nfiscal policies are strained by stimulus packages meant to counter the effects of the global \nfinancial crisis, will make it difficult for public sector in the the developing world to continue to \nsupport capital-intensive projects in the water sector in its own. The private sector will have to \nplay a key role in creating and maintaining water infrastructure during the decades to come.  \n \n7.  To that end, as an independent investment vehicle comprising third-party capital, the \nfund is targeting a financial engineering niche in the water infrastructure sector in which project \nengineering companies are selected based on skill level as opposed to a conventional business \nmodel in which engineering companies are selected based on ability and willingness to invest \ntheir equity in a project.  With this model, the fund expects to generate superior investment \nreturns and greater private sector participation.  This initiative is bolstered by water sector \nregulation, which has been moving toward full cost recovery policies in Asia and the Pacific, with \nwillingness to reduce surface water pollution leading to tariff increases. Pricing water services in \nthis manner encourages water conservation, as well as yield returns that justify investing in \nwater sector infrastructure. Private water investments, incorporating the objectives of helping to \nalleviate Asia\u2019s impending water crisis while making a sustainable return to investors, create a \nwin-win solution for all stakeholders. \n \nB.   Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 \n8.  The  fund  is  being  established  to  make  private  equity  investments  in  water  and \nwastewater assets in certain ADB DMCs. As such, it is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020,5 \nwhich seeks to safeguard the environment and reduce the severe strain pollution is putting on \nthe region\u2019s land, forests, water systems, wetlands, marine ecosystems, and other natural \nresources  upon  which  many  of  the  poor  depend  for  their  livelihoods.  In  particular,  ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 2020 supports investment in essential public services, such as water and sanitation, as \nthese investments support improvements in health, agriculture, and rural development, and \nprovide  the  opportunity  for  all  to  improve  their  standards  of  living,  thereby  contributing  to \neconomic  growth,  poverty  reduction,  and  mitigation  of  extreme  inequalities.    For  further \ninformation about the fund\u2019s poverty reduction and social strategy, please refer to Apendix 3.     \n \n2.  Consistency with the Country Strategy \n9.  The country partnership strategy (CPS) for the PRC, 2008\u201320106 seeks to address \nenvironmental sustainability through greater attention to the management of natural resources \nand ecosystems as a key priority for the PRC and ADB. This new emphasis will result in \nincreased lending for natural resource management, agriculture, energy conservation and clean \nenergy, and urban and rural development. The CPS also identifies water supply and sanitation \nas one of the priority sectors for development. This fund\u2014with its emphasis on water and water \ninfrastructure investments focusing on municipal, industrial, agricultural applications along with \nenvironmentally friendly water projects primarily targeting the PRC\u2014aligns very well with the \nCPS.   \n \n10.  ADB\u2019s 10-year strategic framework for the Greater Mekong Subregion Program focuses \non enhancing private sector participation in development and promoting sustainable use of the \nsubregion\u2019s  shared  natural  resources.  For  example,  through  selected  technical  assistance \ninterventions,  ADB  is  augmenting  the  climate  change  mitigation  and  adaptation  efforts  of \nnational  and  local  governments  in  Cambodia  and  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic \n(Lao PDR). ADB is conducting a study on flood risk vulnerability in five southern provinces of \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2007. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n6  ADB. 2008. Country Partnership Strategy: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2008\u20132010. Manila. ", "     3 \nthe Lao PDR to design adaptation strategies and enhance the resilience of rice farmers and \nrural infrastructure. In Cambodia, ADB is cooperating with the World Bank to implement a \u2015pilot \nprogram for climate resilience\u2016 to mainstream climate risks in national and sectoral development \nplanning and to support key adaptation interventions in the agriculture, water resources, and \nrural infrastructure sectors.7 The fund is consistent with this strategy and will contribute to \nimproved rural infrastructure and water resources in Southeast Asia and the Greater Mekong \nSubregion.   \n \n3.  Consistency with the Sector Strategy \n11.  In 2001, ADB outlined its vision for water management in the region in its \u2015Water for All\u2016 \npolicy. The policy recognizes that, as a resource, water must be managed to meet needs \nwithout causing conflict or stressing natural resources. It also recognizes that innovative and \ncooperative financing efforts are crucial for the success of water projects. ADB, through its \nwater  sector  programs,  provides  funding  for  the  development  and  upgrading  of  water \ninfrastructure in Asia. ADB\u2019s commitment to the water sector is illustrated in the Water Financing \nProgram, 2006\u20132010, in which investments in water were expected to double and be directed \ntoward  reforms  and capacity  development  programs  in rural  communities,  cities,  and river \nbasins; and in the associated Water Financing Partnership Facility to mobilize cofinancing and \ninvestments from development partners.   \n \n12.  As a large majority of the water utilities in Asia are publicly owned, working actively on \npublic\u2013private  partnerships  (PPPs)  is  crucial  to  accomplishing  water  sector  investment \nobjectives. To that end, in April 2007, ADB made an equity investment in Asia Infrastructure \nProject Development (AIPD) together with three Singapore-based companies (Crest Spring,8 \nKonzen  Group,9 and  United  Engineers).10   AIPD\u2019s  mission  is  to  identify  and  incubate \ncommercially viable PPP projects in water supply, sanitation, and wastewater treatment in the \nPRC. In so doing, AIPD aims to enhance private sector participation and to play a critical role in \nthe delivery of services in the water sector.   \n \n13.  As of the end of 2009, ADB had lent $25 billion for water-related projects. In February \n2010, ADB and Daiwa Securities Group announced the issuance of a water bond for financing \nwater sector investments in Asia and the Pacific. According to ADB estimates, Asia needs \n$8 billion annually of capital investment to meet targets for safe drinking water in the next \ndecade.   \n \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2009. Climate Change: Strengthening Adaptation and Mitigation in Asia and the Pacific. Manila. \n8  Crest Spring Private is a subsidiary of GoldChina, a subsidiary of Goldis Berhad. Crest Spring provides water \ntreatment services in municipalities in the PRC and has extensive experience operating in the build-operate-transfer \nmarket in the PRC, particularly in municipal wastewater treatment. Crest Spring has also been actively involved in \nthe design, engineering, procurement, and construction of projects supplying ultra-pure and ultra-filtration solutions \nmainly to industries throughout the PRC. \n9  The Konzen Group out of Singapore evolved from Ionics (now part of GE Infrastructure Group) and includes two \nindependent entities: (i) Konzen Engineering Systems, based in Malaysia, which has more than 25 years of \noperating history in Southeast Asia; and (ii) Konzen Environment (Tianjin), based in the PRC, which has 15 years \nof operating experience there. These two companies are engineering specialists mainly engaged in industrial water \nprojects, providing high quality ultra-pure water as well as treating highly polluted wastewater to meet discharge \nstandards. The Konzen Group is the first specialized water technologies provider in Asia and works closely with \nSingapore Economic Development Board and Public Utilities Board. The Konzen Group provides total solutions in \nthe water sector including municipal and industrial wastewater treatment systems, irrigation and flood control \nsystems, and sludge treatment systems.   \n10 United Engineers (Singapore) is one of Singapore\u2019s pioneer engineering companies. It provides a wide range of \ncivil, mechanical and electrical, and process engineering services in Singapore and overseas\u2014specializing in \nproperty and environment-related projects. The company is the principal subsidiary of United Engineers Limited, a \nmainboard-listed group of companies with core strengths in engineering, construction, and integrated facility \nmanagement. \n ", "4       \n \n4.  Lessons Learned from Previous Operations     \n14.  The key recommendations of ADB\u2019s 2005 evaluation study of the \u2015Water for All\u2016 policy \nwere  (i) to  increase  ADB\u2019s  commitments  and  develop  ADB\u2019s  capacities  through  increased \ninvestments, staff realignment and development, and providing leadership in the region with \nrespect to prioritizing the water sector; and (ii) to promote leveraging innovations to increase \nwater access, affordability, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness, including nuanced guidance on \nsubsidy use, promoting PPPs, alternative financing modalities under the Innovative Efficiency \nInitiative (IEI), robust operations and maintenance arrangements, and scaling up of alternative \ntechnologies.  The  fund\u2019s  private  equity  investment  in  water  and  wastewater  assets  and \nutilization of PPPs such as AIPD emulate these goals.  \n \n15.  Key recommendations of ADB\u2019s evaluation study of private equity funds, in addition to a \nnumber  of  general  suggestions  (e.g.,  enhancing  staffing,  risk  management  systems,  and \nportfolio management), included (i) strengthening country programming arrangements so there \nis better coordination in the development of the nonbank financial sector, and (ii) articulating an \noperational strategy that sets out target countries and sectors. The fund generates synergies \nbetween public sector efforts in the various target countries and the private sector investments \nthat will be made through the fund, and aligns with ADB\u2019s focus on underinvested countries and \nsectors. \n \n5.  Consistency with Other Relevant ADB Operations \n16.  ADB recognizes that continued poverty reduction in Asia and the Pacific will not be \npossible without proactive efforts to mitigate the causes of global warming and to help the \nregion adapt to the impacts of climate change. ADB recognizes the water and agriculture \nsectors as being most sensitive to climate change, as water is the principal medium through \nwhich  climate  change  is  manifested.11 Insofar  as  the  fund  seeks  to  invest  in  water  and \nwastewater assets, it is consistent with these and other climate change initiatives of ADB\u2019s \noperation departments.   \n \n17.  The fund is also consistent with a number of ADB\u2019s region-wide strategic priority actions \nfor furthering progress in ADB\u2019s climate change program. One such action is to promote climate \nresilience. Many of the adverse impacts of climate change, such as reduced fresh water supply \nand spread of disease, are predicted to have gender-specific impacts. Adjusting to the need for \nclimate-resilient  development  will  mean  building  responses  to  the  physical,  social,  and \neconomic impacts of climate change into all aspects of development planning and investment.  \nSince  water  is  the  principal  medium  through  which  climate  change  is  manifested,  special \nattention will be given to improving DMC capacities for climate-resilient water management in \nurban, rural, and river basin settings through investments such as those targeted by the fund.   \n \nC.  Development Impact \n18.  Outputs and Outcome. The key outputs of ADB\u2019s investment will be the establishment \nof the fund itself, as well as the fund\u2019s investments in water and wastewater assets, ongoing \nmanagement advice to investee projects, and profitable divestment from its investments. This \nwill increase the flow of funds and expertise into water-related initiatives, expand and improve \nwater infrastructure in targeted DMCs, and improve investee project financial performance and \ngovernance (outcome).  \n \n                                                \n11  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change.  2007.  Fourth  Assessment  Report  (Working  Group  II). \nhttp://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/publications_and_data_reports.htm#2 ", "     5 \n19.  Impact. The ultimate development impact of the proposed investment will be sustainable \nwater sector development in ADB\u2019s DMCs, as well as private sector development in the water \nand  environment  sectors.  Through  ADB\u2019s  support  of  the  fund,  the  following  development \nimpacts will also be achieved: \n \n(i)  The fund\u2019s focused investments in clean water, sanitation, energy efficiency, and \nnew  water-related  technology  will  address  the  increasing  issues  on  water \npollution from domestic, industrial, and agricultural activities in the water sector in \nAsia.  These  investments  thus  help  in  achieving  effective  water  resource \nmanagement that has inherent linkages to other development-related sectors \nsuch as food, energy, and the environment. \n \n(ii)  The money invested by the fund will lead to the portfolio companies\u2019 growth and \nexpansion.    Further,  the  fund\u2019s  investments  in  greenfield  projects  under \ndevelopment will lead to developing individual companies in the private sector, \ncreating jobs, and contributing to sustainable employment in the region.  \n \n20.  Ancillary developmental benefits will include sustainable water supply and economic \ndevelopment, increased private sector participation and development, and mitigation of the \neffects of climate change. \n \nIII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY  \nA.  Ownership \n21.  The  Asia  Water  Fund  will  be  incorporated  as  a  Cayman  Islands  exempted  limited \npartnership. AmAsia Water Management (GP) Ltd., an exempted company incorporated with \nlimited liability under the laws of the Cayman Islands, will be the general partner of the fund.  \nThe  fund  manager,  AmAsia  Water  Management  Pte.  Ltd.,  is  a  private  limited  company \nincorporated  under  the  laws  of  Singapore  and  wholly  owned  by  MVMI,  a  wholly  owned \nsubsidiary of AmInvestment Group, which is part of the AmBank Group.   \n  \n1.  AmInvestment Group  \n \n22.  AmInvestment Group Berhad is one of Malaysia\u2019s leading investment banking groups \nwith over 30 years of experience. It offers a full range of retail, corporate, and investment \nbanking  services.  It  also  provides  asset  management  services,  and  is  an  adviser  to  the \nGovernment of Malaysia with regard to formulating the Malaysian Privatization Master Plan, \nhaving a wide range of experience in privatizations and PPPs.   \n \n23.  MVMI, a wholly owned subsidiary of AmInvestment Group, was incorporated in Malaysia \nin 1984. Since its inception, MVMI has managed three country funds: Malaysian Ventures I, \nMalaysian Ventures II, and AmPrivate Equity. MVMI also managed the SEAVI-Advent fund\u2014the \nregion\u2019s first fund focused on venture capital and private equity investing in the Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations\u2014on behalf of Advent International.  \n \n25.  The  continuity  of  MVMI\u2019s  well  vetted  investment  processes  and  risk  management \npractices will benefit the fund, as will the involvement of two key team members with experience \nworking together on prior MVMI funds. The value of the sponsor\u2019s private equity platform, as \nwell as the ability of its management team to execute the fund\u2019s strategy, is demonstrated by \nthe fund manager\u2019s execution of a water sector investment in YC Foxin in the first quarter (Q) of \n2010  through  MVMI\u2019s  AmPrivate  Equity  fund.  Through  this  investment,  the  sponsor  also \nestablished an extensive deal referral network among water sector developers and related \n ", "6       \n \ngovernment authorities in the PRC, making significant strides toward increasing the fund\u2019s deal \npipeline.     \n \nB.  Governance Structure \n1.  Management  \n26.  The  initial  investment  team  of the  fund manager  has  a good  mix  of  private  equity \ninvestment experience and water technology experience. Some of the key team members have \nworked together for many years on MVMI\u2019s prior private equity funds and its current fund, \nAmPrivate Equity.  \n \n2.  Corporate Governance \n27.  The fund manager will have an experienced board of directors, and the general partner \nof the fund will have an advisory board, comprising certain institutional investors, to represent \nthe interests of the investors, supervise the fund\u2019s operations, and advise and guide the fund \nmanager. ADB will be represented on the advisory board.  \n \n3.  Risk Management  \n28.  The fund manager will manage risk through its investment process, which involves \nseveral  layers  of  approval,  and  through  its  investment  committee,  which  is  composed  of \nmembers with extensive experience in the water sector and investment management.  \n   \n \n \nC.  Business Overview and Strategy \n1.  Investment Objectives and Policies   \n \n29.  The  fund  aims  to  provide  investors  with  stable,  long-term  capital  growth  and  cash \ndistributions by investing in water and water-related assets in the PRC and Southeast Asia. The \nfund  will  seek  to  mitigate  investment  risk  through  portfolio  diversification  with  respect  to \ngeographic regions as well as sector (e.g., municipal water, industrial water, agricultural water, \netc.), contracting with reputable engineering parties, investing in companies with high corporate \ngovernance and financial management standards, and by seeking a majority ownership stake \nwith the aim of having greater control and oversight of each portfolio investment. The fund will \ninvest 70% of the portfolio in the PRC and the rest in Southeast Asia. No more than 10% of the \ncommitments will be invested in a single transaction.     \n \n  2.  Investment Strategy \n \n30.  The fund\u2019s investment strategy will be to create a diversified portfolio of assets with \nopportunities for strong capital gains in the following water subsectors: \n(a)  municipal water and wastewater treatment plants, \n(b)  industrial water and wastewater treatment plants,  \n(c)  rural water and wastewater treatment plants,  \n(d)  agricultural wastewater treatment plants, and  \n(e)  water rehabilitation projects;  \n ", "     7 \nIV.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The ADB Assistance and Transaction Structure \n31.  ADB proposes to make an equity investment of up to $20 million in the fund or 25% of \nthe fund\u2019s total share capital, whichever is less. ADB will not be the single largest investor in the \nfund. The targeted fund size is $100 million, with a first closing of about $40 million. The fund \nhas been well received by other development financial institutions such as IFC.  \n \nB.  Justification for ADB Assistance \n32.  Catalytic and demonstration effect. Given the significant need for private investments \nin the water sector, ADB will have a catalytic role in attracting local and foreign private equity \ncapital to help build water and water-related infrastructure in Asia. ADB\u2019s intervention through \nthis fund will (i) demonstrate a framework to other development financial institutions in terms of \nhow to address the water shortage issue and how to support water sector development, and (ii) \nhelp  mobilize  capital  to  support  other  private  equity  funds  that  pursue  this  path.  ADB\u2019s \ninvestment in the fund will help to develop fund managers and financial professionals with \nexperience in the water infrastructure and services asset class in the region. \n \n33.  Private  sector  development.  The  fund  will  employ  market-based  mechanisms  to \ndevelop profitable and sustainable enterprises in the water sector, which needs it the most. \nADB\u2019s contribution to this type of initiative assists its DMCs to implement country-specific private \nsector development strategies. \n \n34.  Social and environmental issues. The transaction will have to comply with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009). \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Environment and Social Safeguards    \n35.  ADB\u2019s investment is classified category FI under the Safeguard Policy Statement. IFC \nhas conducted environmental and social due diligence on the fund following its environmental \nand social review procedures. Based on IFC\u2019s findings, the fund manager was informed that it \nshould expect environment and safeguards (E&S) audits on municipal projects to be more \nlengthy than industrial projects (at least 6 months) and that the fund manager would be required \nto include E&S due diligence as a critical job specification of the water specialist that the fund is \nplanning to hire. Furthermore, as a condition of IFC\u2019s investment, the fund will adopt a social \nand environmental management system (SEMS). The fund will be required to establish and \nmaintain  an  environmental  and  social  management  system  (ESMS)  as  part  of  its  overall \nmanagement system to meet national laws and/or ADB requirements. The SEMS and/or ESMS \nwill have to comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements on the environment, \ninvoluntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. The SEMS and/or ESMS satisfactory to ADB \nwill  be  adopted  by  the  fund  before  the  first  disbursement  for  the  purpose  of  financing  a \nsubproject.  In  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  ESMS,  the  fund  will  appoint  an \nenvironmental  and  social  safeguard  manager  and  staff  to  implement  the  ESMS;  the  staff \nconcerned  will  attend  ADB-approved  or  sponsored  training  related  to  compliance  and \nmonitoring activities; and the proposed subprojects will be screened against the Prohibited \nInvestment Activities List. An outline of an ESMS is in Appendix 2.  \n \n \n ", "8       \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy  \n36.  The fund was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and \npolicy relating to the Combating of Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism (2003). \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will \nrequire the fund manager and the sponsor to institute, maintain, and comply with internal \nprocedures and controls following international best practice standards for preventing corruption \nor money laundering activities or the financing of terrorism and covenant with ADB to refrain \nfrom engaging in such activities. The investment documentation between ADB and the fund will \nfurther allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings. \n \n37.  The general partner of the fund will be incorporated as an exempted company in the \nCayman Islands, an offshore financial center and common location of incorporation for funds \nand general partners. Incorporation in an  offshore financial center allows the fund and its \ninvestors to avoid double taxation, as a result of the Cayman Islands\u2019 own tax regulations and \nthe tax treaties that it has with other countries. Having undertaken its own due diligence of this \nmatter, the project team is satisfied that the fund will not be used for cross-border tax evasion, \nmoney laundering, or the financing of terrorism. \n \nC.  Assurances \n38.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter), \nthe Government of the PRC will be requested to confirm it has no objection to the proposed \nassistance to the fund. Following the approval of the proposed investment by ADB\u2019s Board of \nDirectors, ADB will enter into suitable documentation with the fund and the fund manager, in \nform and substance satisfactory to ADB. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n39.  I am satisfied that the proposed equity investment would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nequity investment of up to $20,000,000 in the Asia Water Fund from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources, with such terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in this report, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n ", "Appendix 1        9 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \nDesign  Performance Targets  Data Sources and  Assumptions  \nSummary  and Indicators with  Reporting Mechanisms   and Risks  \nBaselinesa \nImpact      Assumptions \n       \nPrivate sector  Improvements by the  DMC government reports  Adequate supply of PPP \ndevelopment in the  end of 2020b from the  and World Bank  projects in water \nwater sector in DMCs  end of 2010 in the  development data  infrastructure develops in the \n  water sector and in    targeted DMCs. \nWater pollution  access to water supply  Fund portfolio company   \nabatement and clean  with less pollution:  reports on an ongoing  Data on sewage treatment, \nwater shortage  1. 525 additional jobs  basis to the fund  PPPs, and new jobs created \nmitigation  created by the fund    are measured and reported \n  investment    in targeted DMC projects. \n  companies in the   \n  water sector  Targeted DMC governments \n  2.
