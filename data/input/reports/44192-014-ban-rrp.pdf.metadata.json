The  interconnection  includes \nabout  112  kilometers  (km)  of  400  kilovolt  (kV)  double-circuit  transmission  line  between  the \nelectrical substations at Baharampur in India and Bheramara in Bangladesh, a 400 kV switching \nstation at Baharampur, a 500 megawatt (MW) back-to-back high-voltage direct current (HVDC) \nsubstation  (400/230  kV)  at  Bheramara,  and  associated  infrastructure  on  both  sides.  The \ninterconnection will enable a power flow of 500 MW into Bangladesh from the Indian  electrical \ngrid to partly alleviate the significant power shortages in Bangladesh, with a provision to boost \nthe power flow subsequently to 1,000 MW. The project consists of the Bangladesh portion of the \ninterconnection.  The  additional  financing  will  cover  the  cost  overruns  that  have  resulted  in  a \nfunding gap for the project. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nDevelopment problem. Bangladesh's electrification ratio is still low, providing electricity \n3. \nto less than 50% of the population in 2010. During peak periods, up to 30% of demand is unmet \nand in 2013, there is daily load shedding for several hours in major cities. This situation affects \neconomic  performance,  business  competitiveness  and  productivity,  quality  of  life,  and  basic \nservices.  In  addition,  there  is  a  need  for  energy  diversification  given  concerns  over  long-term \navailability  of  domestic  natural  gas,  which  currently  fuels  80%  of  the  power  sector  in \nBangladesh.2 To overcome the power supply crisis, the government launched several initiatives \nto  add  new  generating  capacity\u2014e.g.,  mobilization  of  rental  power  plants,  rehabilitation  of \nexisting power plants, and power procurement from the South Asia region. In 2010, it signed an \nagreement  on  electrical  grid  connectivity  with  India. 3  Connecting  the  two  grids  provides  a \nplatform for more regional cooperation and a means to alleviate the prevailing energy shortfalls \nin  Bangladesh. 4  The  project  is  in  accordance  with  the  2010  South  Asian  Association  for \nRegional  Cooperation  Regional  Energy  Trade  Study  to  promote  South  Asian  regional  power \ntrading  and  is  included  in  the  regional  cooperation  operations  business  plan,  2013\u20132015  for \nSouth  Asia  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  The  project  would  contribute  to  ADB\u2019s \nregional cooperation and integration objectives under Strategy 2020.5 \n \n4. \nPerformance of original project. The project was approved in August 2010 and made \neffective in 2011. All contract packages under the project were awarded by early 2011. During \n                                                \n1 ADB. 2010. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  Bangladesh for  the  Bangladesh\u2013India  Electrical  Grid  Interconnection  Project.  Manila.  The  project  was \nrenamed  SASEC  Bangladesh\u2013India  Electrical  Grid  Interconnection  Project  to  highlight  its  regional  cooperation \ndimension. \n2 ADB. 2009. Energy Outlook for Asia and the Pacific. Manila. \n3 In 1997, ADB facilitated dialogue between Bangladesh and India to assess options for exchange of power. \n4 ADB. 2011.

The original loan agreement for the project therefore provided that disbursements by \nADB  would  start  only  after  conclusion  of  a  memorandum  of  understanding  for  a  long-term \nsupply  of  250  MW,  followed  by  a  power  purchase  agreement  (PPA),  acceptable  to  ADB,  6 \nmonths  later.  In  March  2012,  India\u2019s  National  Thermal  Power  Corporation  (NTPC),  through  its \nwholly owned subsidiary NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam, and the Bangladesh Power Development \nBoard (BPDB) signed a PPA for the sale of 250 MW of power from India to Bangladesh for 25 \nyears.6 While the PPA reduces the key risk of non- or underutilization of the interconnection, it \nwas also found that the PPA  does  not meet the strict standards  originally  contemplated  in the \nloan agreement. Most importantly, the PPA includes a clause that the PPA may be terminated if \neither  country  does  not  agree  to  extend  the  power  sector  cooperation  agreement  (signed  in \n2010) beyond the initial period of 5 years, i.e.,  by 2015. Nevertheless, ADB eventually accepted \nthe request from the government to allow disbursements under the ADB loan on the basis that \neconomically  viable,  alternative  sources  of  power  would  be  available  from  the  market  in  the \nunlikely event that the countries discontinued their cooperation in the power sector.7 The project \nhas been performing satisfactorily since the removal of the disbursement condition in 2012. The \npresent project performance rating is on track.  \n \n5. \nPhysical progress is now at an advanced stage with the transmission line commissioning \nnearly  completed  and  the  substation  in  pre-commissioning  mode  as  of  July  2013.  A  link  has \nbeen  established  from  the  substation  in  Bangladesh  to  the  Indian  border  in  May  2013.  All \ncontracts have been awarded. Disbursements crossed 80% of the approved loan amount in July \n2013.  The  substation  in  Bangladesh  will  be  ready  to  accept  power  flows  in  September  2013. \nThe components of the project were prepared and implemented based on agreed environmental \nand social safeguards, including periodic updates on the safeguard implementation and external \nreview of safeguard compliance. \n \n6. \nRisk management. Risks identified at due diligence of the project were adequately dealt \nwith. As discussed in para. 4, the conclusion of the PPA in March 2012 helped mitigate the key \nrisk  of nonutilization of the  interconnection.  A  two-stage  bidding process  was  used for the first \nHVDC substation to be developed in Bangladesh. The project's executing agency, Power Grid \nCompany  of  Bangladesh  (PGCB),  has  executed  several  ADB  projects  and  received  technical \nsupport from Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (PGCIL), the central transmission utility of \nIndia.  Approval  for  advance  procurement  facilitated  the  two-stage  procurement  process  and \nengagement with potential contractors. PGCIL, the executing agency on the Indian side of the \ninterconnection,  has  shared  the  safeguard  reporting  as  requested  by  PGCB  and  ADB.  An \nadditional PPA for 250 MW will be in place in 2013 through competitive procurement.  \n \n7. \nAdditional  financing.  Cost  escalation  is  primarily  attributed  to  the  inclusion  of  spare \ntransformers  during  the  two-stage  bid  process,  foreign  exchange  rate  fluctuations  and  tax \nincreases that have resulted in a funding gap. The Government has requested about $12 million \nof additional financing from ADB to cover the foreign exchange part of the total cost over-run of \nabout  $40.4  million.  The  project  remains  a  key  priority  for  the  government  and  this  additional \nfinancing  is  included  in  ADB's  country  operations  business  plan  for  2013.  The  additional \nfinancing meets the eligibility criteria in ADB\u2019s additional financing policy and the overall project \n\n                                                \n6 BPDB is the bulk supplier of electricity in Bangladesh. NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam is the trading arm of NTPC, the \nlargest power generation utility in India.  \n7 It appears unlikely that the active sub-regional cooperation between the two countries in several sectors, including \npower,  would  be  discontinued.  For  example,  NTPC  is  managing  the  operations  of  a  power  plant  in  Bangladesh. \nFurthermore, BPDB and NTPC have established a joint venture to set up a thermal power plant in Bangladesh. Also, \nparas. 29\u201330 discuss further measures to mitigate the risk of non- or underutilization of the interconnection. \n\n\f \n\nis expected to remain technically, economically, and financially viable despite the cost overrun. \nAdditional financing is assessed as a better option than restructuring, scaling down, or canceling \nthe  project.  It  would  support  timely  completion  of  the  project  and  contribute to  the  outcome  of \ncross-border power flows by up to 500 MW starting in 2013. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n8. \nThe  project  impact  and  outcome  remain  as  they  are  defined  in  the  original  project \ndesign.  The  impact  will  be  greater  regional  cooperation  in  the  power  sector  contributing  to \neconomic growth in Bangladesh. The outcome is the successful development and operation of a \npower transmission link between Bangladesh and India. The project is expected to alleviate the \npower  crisis  in  Bangladesh  by  making  available  up  to  500  MW  of  additional  power  starting  in \n2013.  \n \n C. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  physical  outputs  of  the  project  are  27  kilometers  km  of  400  kV  double-circuit \n9.  \ntransmission  line  in  Bangladesh,  a  500  MW  back-to-back  HVDC  substation  (400kV/230kV)  at \nBheramara,  a  4  km  230  kV  double-circuit  loop-in  loop-out  and  230kV  switching  station  at \nBheramara  to  link  to  the  transmission  network  in  Bangladesh. 8  Under  separate  technical \nassistance,  ADB  is  facilitating  capacity  building  and  information  sharing  on  cross-border \nelectricity  trading  and  the  development  of  interconnection  agreements  between  the  two \ncountries.9 \n \nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\n10. \nThe  revised  investment for the  project  is  $199.0 million,  an  increase  of $40.4  million  in \nthe overall cost for the packages in Bangladesh (para. 7).

To ensure effective implementation, PGCB set up a \nproject management unit in 2010, headed by a project director. PGCIL, the central transmission \nutility  of  India  and  the  executing  agency  on  the  Indian  side  of  the  interconnection,  provides \ntechnical  consulting  services  to  PGCB.  A  joint  working  group  comprising  senior  power  sector \nofficials  from  both  Bangladesh  and  India  meet  regularly  for  coordination  purposes.  A  joint \nsteering  committee,  co-chaired  by  the  power  secretaries  of  both  countries,  reviews  progress \nand ensures high-level coordination. \n \nGoods,  equipment,  and  civil  works  financed  under  the  project  were  procured  in \n14. \naccordance  with  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  \nInternational  competitive  bidding  was  followed  for  both  the  transmission  line  and  substation \npackages.  Approval for advance procurement  action  and retroactive financing  was  provided in \n2010,  which  supported  early  completion  of  the  procurement  process.  Retroactive  financing \napproval is sought, not exceeding 20% of the additional loan amount, for expenditures incurred \nbefore effectiveness of the relevant loan agreement but not earlier than 12 months prior to the \nsigning  date  of  the  loan  agreement.

The project was designed in 2009 by a joint technical team comprising representatives \nfrom the power utilities of Bangladesh and India. The team concluded that the interconnection \nbetween  the  eastern  region  of  India  and  the  western  part  of  Bangladesh  based  on  an \nasynchronous  mode  of  interconnection  at  400 kV  was  preferred,  to facilitate  careful  regulation \nand  management  of  the  power  flows,  maintain  complete  control  on  the  exchange  of  power \nbetween  the  two  countries,  and  allow  independent  operation  of  the  two  grids.  Based  on \ntechnical, operational, and economic considerations, an HVDC back-to-back substation terminal \nand  a  400  kV  double-circuit  transmission  interconnection  line  between  the  two  countries  were \ndesigned.  PGCIL  has  been  providing  support  in  technical  bid  evaluation  during  the  two-stage \nbid process, detailed design review, and implementation advisory services.  \n \n\n                                                \n11  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n17. \nBangladesh continues to face a power deficit, and direct tangible economic benefits from \nthe  project  arise  from  prevented  power  outages.  Economic  analysis  considered  the  tangible \nbenefits of resource cost savings of power generation based on alternative sources. The energy \nsource for resource cost savings was determined based on the least-cost analysis, which shows \nthat  power  import  is  one  of  the  least-cost  solutions  to  the  current  power  crisis  in  Bangladesh. \nThe  project\u2019s  economic  feasibility  was  assessed  from  a  Bangladesh-specific  and  regional \nperspective. The base case provided an economic internal rate of return of 24% compared to an \neconomic  internal  rate  of return  of  27% for  the  original  project. These  estimates  are  based  on \nconservative  assumptions  on  resource  cost  savings.  Evaluation  based  on  prevented  outage \ncosts or resource cost savings on fuel oil or diesel (used for rental power plants) yields a much \nhigher economic return. The project returns are stable against the relevant risk factors, and the \nanalysis demonstrates the economic feasibility of the project in different scenarios. The project \nalso provides larger intangible benefits of building mutual trust and will pave the way for similar \nprojects  in  South  Asia  in  the  future,  allowing  optimization  of  the  regional  energy  resources \namong  South  Asian  countries.  This  will  contribute  to  the  energy  security  and  economic \ndevelopment of the region. \n \n18. \nFinancial analysis of the project with additional financing was carried out in accordance \nwith  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects  (2005).  All \nfinancial  costs  and  benefits  were  expressed  in  constant  2013  prices.  Financial  viability  was \nassessed  by  comparing  the  incremental  costs  and  benefits  of  the  project  over  a  period  of \n30 years.  The  incremental  benefits  were  calculated  based  on  PGCB's  revenue  stream.  Costs \nused to determine the financial internal rate of return included the capital investment, operation \nand maintenance costs, and taxes to install and operate the project. Revenues were calculated \nbased  on  existing  transmission  tariffs  and  the  Bangladesh  Energy  Regulatory  Commission's \ntransmission  tariff regulations  were  considered  applicable once adopted. The financial  internal \nrate  of  return  of  the  project  is  4.0%,  which  compares  favorably  with  the  estimated  weighted \naverage cost of capital of 1.8%, indicating that the project remains financially viable.  \n \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n19.  \nThe  executing  and  implementing  agencies  meet  ADB\u2019s  procurement  management  and \nfinancial  management  requirements.12   Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the project. To \nsupport these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate)  were  included  in  the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  project.  Both \ncontracts financed by ADB were subject to prior ADB review and included provisions specifying \nthe right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the executing agencies and \nall contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the project. \nTable  4  summarizes  major  project-specific  governance  measures.  No  further  procurement  is \nrequired  under  additional  financing.  PGCB  is  listed  on  the  Dhaka  Stock  Exchange  and  its \nfinancial  parameters  are  disclosed  quarterly.  PGCB  has  been  rotating  its  external  auditors \nperiodically.  PGCB  is  capable  of  managing  funds  flow,  disbursement  procedures,  accounting, \nand financial reporting under the project.  \n \n\n                                                \n12 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fDue  to  delays  in  notification  of  the  electricity  transmission  and  distribution  tariff \n20. \nregulations, these were not adopted as contemplated under the original project.

The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the project administration manual. \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n\n22. \nBangladesh  ranks  seventh  on  the  list  of  most  populous  countries  in  the  world.  Its \npopulation in 2010 was 148.7 million, of which 106.9 million lived in rural areas.13  The services \nand industry sectors which are highly dependent on electricity, have been growing and in 2010 \ncontributed 53% and 29% respectively to the gross domestic product (footnote 12).  \n \n23. \nDespite its recent economic growth, Bangladesh remains one of the poorest countries in \nthe  world  with nearly  half  of  its  population  living below  the  $1.25  per  day  poverty  line.  Natural \ncalamities  like  floods  and  cyclones,  institutional  and  governance  factors,  and  inadequate \navailability  of  energy  sources  have  affected  growth  and  development.  The  consumption  of \nelectricity  in  Bangladesh  is  one  of  the  lowest  at  198  kilowatt-hours  per  capita.14 Slightly  less \n\n                                                \n13 International Fund for Agricultural Development. 2010.    \n   http://www.ruralpovertyportal.org/web/guest/country/statistics/tags/bangladesh \n14 Bangladesh Power Development Board. 2012. Annual Report. Dhaka.  \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fthan 50% of the population had access to electricity in 2010.15  Even with access to electricity, \nproblems  continue  due  to  power  cuts  and  irregular  supply.  All  these  factors  have  severely \nhampered economic growth and the delivery of essential services like health and education, and \ncontributed to the  high  poverty  levels. The  project  is  important to improve  access  to  electricity \nand economic growth, particularly in western Bangladesh, which is disproportionally affected by \nelectricity shortages.  \n \n24. \nThe jobs generated during construction directly benefit local communities. Other impacts \nof the project include greater production capacity of existing industries and the creation of new \nones.  More  reliable  power  supply  will  strengthen  the  sectors  most  dependent  on  it  and  help \ngenerate significant employment.  \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards  \n\n25. \nFrom the environmental standpoint, the project with additional financing is category B, as \nit  is  not  likely  to  lead  to  irreversible  adverse  impacts.  The  initial  environmental  examination \nbased on the analyzed data collected through reviews of available reports, satellite photographs, \ndiscussion  with  stakeholders,  and  field  visits  to  the  project  area  was  uploaded  on  the  ADB \nwebsite  in  May  2010.  The  initial  environmental  examination  was  prepared  following  ADB's \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  government's  environmental  impact  assessment \nguidelines,  and  related  national  policies  and  legislation.  The  environmental  management  plan \nunder the initial environmental examination is being implemented. Potential impacts will mostly \nbe  temporary.  The  Department  of  Environment  environmental  clearance  for  the  project  was \nrenewed. The budgetary provisions for implementation of the environmental management plan \nare being utilized. The implementation is being supervised by PGCB and progress reports are \nbeing  submitted  to  ADB.  In  the  event  of  any  change  of  alignment  or  identification  of  any \nunanticipated  environmental  impact  during  the  course  of  project  implementation,  PGCB  will \nsuitably  revise  the  environmental  management  plan.  A  monitoring  consultant  has  been \nappointed to review progress. \n \n26. \nThe  project  with  additional  financing  is  Category  C  under  indigenous  people,  and \nCategory  A  under  involuntary  resettlement.  No  additional  land  is  required  for  the  additional \nfinancing.  There  will  also  be  no  additional  resettlement  impacts.  The  resettlement  plan  for  the \noriginal project was uploaded on ADB\u2019s website in August 2010. Relevant information regarding \nthe project, and the views and opinions of all affected groups were taken into consideration  in \ndeveloping the entitlement matrix. Compensation payments were made in accordance with the \nresettlement plan at the substation site and along the transmission line right of way. A grievance \nredress mechanism was created by PGCB in 2010 and is operational. A monitoring consultant \nhas been appointed to review progress. \n \n27. \ninformation dissemination campaigns in the project areas during project implementation.   \n \n28. \nIn  accordance  with  the  provisions  in  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  the  associated \ntransmission  component  that  PGCIL  is  installing  in  India  is  also  subject  to  due  diligence. \nPGCIL\u2019s  environmental  and  social  safeguard  policy  requires  it  to  conduct  due  diligence  and \nensure  implementation  of  all  necessary  mitigation  measures.  Safeguard  documents  for  the \ninterconnection in India were prepared by PGCIL and provided to PGCB and to ADB.  \n \n\nAlthough the risk of spreading HIV/AIDS was not clearly identified, steps were taken for \n\n                                                \n15 Government of Bangladesh, Planning Commission. 2010.

A \nresidual  risk  is  non-extension  of  the  power  sector  cooperation  agreement  between  the  two \ncountries beyond the initial period of 5 years, which could result in the termination of this PPA. \nIn such an event, BPDB could undertake competitive procurement from the Indian power market. \nPower  market  reports  and  training  workshops  under  technical  assistance  (footnote  9)  help \nimpart familiarity with the Indian power market.  \n\n30. \nAnother  key  risk  is  that  the  procurement  of  additional  250  MW  of  power  through  a \ncompetitive  bidding  PPA  is  delayed.  Support  is  provided  to  the  Government  of  Bangladesh \nunder  the  same  technical  assistance  to  develop  PPA  and  bidding  documents  for  competitive \nprocurement, and to conclude the bidding process in the second half of 2013. Other risks such \nas  the  limited  capacity  of  PGCB  in  project  coordination  and  implementation,  and  operation  of \nthe  HVDC  substation,  have  been  mitigated  by  the  government's  recruitment  of  consultants. \nMajor risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5. The overall assessment of risk \nis  low  and  the  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to  outweigh  the  costs  of  the  risk \nmitigating measures. \n\nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nLimited HVDC technology \nimplementation capacity \n\nEither or both countries do not \nagree to extend the \nagreement on cooperation in \nthe power sector  \n\nIncrease in prices of raw \nmaterials \n\nLimited capacity in negotiating \ncross-border electricity trading \ncontracts \nCost of power from India not \ncompetitive compared with \noptions in Bangladesh \n\nimplementation \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe executing agency recruited PGCIL as consultants to assist in project \ndesign,  bidding,  and \nin  Bangladesh.  PGCIL  has \nexperience from installing  six HVDC projects in the region. It supported \nPGCB  in  the  design  of  the  project  in  2009  and  has  been  assisting  it \nduring  implementation\u2014bid  process,  review  of  contractor  designs,  and \nimplementation using on-site resources.   \nUnder  the  HVDC  contract,  PGCB  engineers  are  being  trained  for  the \noperation of the substation. PGCIL\u2019s role as the executing agency on the \nIndian side of the interconnection has resulted in successful coordination \nand timely construction of interconnection infrastructure on both sides. \nBoth countries have been participating in regional cooperation initiatives \nin  energy,  transport,  and  other  sectors.  In  the  unlikely  event  of  non- \nextension  or  termination  of  the  PPA,  or  reduction  in  the  service  quality \nunder  the  signed  PPA,  BPDB  can  procure  power  from  alternative \nsources in the Indian electricity market. Bidding is in the final stages for \nanother  250  MW  to  be  procured  by  BPDB  through  a  competitive \narrangement  supported  under  ADB  technical  assistance  (footnote  9, \nmain text).  \nContracts were awarded in 2010 and 2011. Commodity price variations \nwill  be settled at the end of the contract. Costs of the project  approved \nby the Planning Commission in 2013 are expected to be included in the \ntransmission rate base and tariff determined by BERC.  \nTechnical  assistance  supported  a  review  of  the  power  market  in  India \nand design of the draft PPA for an additional 250 MW of electricity flow. \nSupport to BPDB for concluding the PPA is being provided in 2013. \nThe first PPA for 250 MW is based on regulated tariffs in India, which are \nlower than the marginal cost of power in Bangladesh. Alternative options \nincluding  new  power  plants  in  Bangladesh  using  dual  fuel  technology \nand  imported  coal  power  are  more  expensive.  Power  from  India  under \nthe  second  PPA  is  expected  to  be  competitively  priced  compared  with \nsources in Bangladesh. ADB is assisting the Government of Bangladesh \nin  reviewing  its  gas  pricing  policy  that  has  an  impact  on  the  electricity \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nRisks \n\nInadequate power availability \nin the eastern region of India \n\nDelays in or failure to enter \ninto agreements for power \nsupply and transmission \n\nMitigating Measures \nsector  since  domestic  natural  gas  is  the  primary  source  of  power \ngeneration in Bangladesh. \nIndia  installs  about 17,000 MW annually.  The eastern region of India  is \nsurplus  and  is  expected  to  add  significant  generation  capacity  over  the \nnext  5  years  to  meet  the  growth  in  demand.  The  Government  of  India \nhas identified the sources for the first 250 MW, and competitive bidding \nis in the final stages for an additional 250 MW.  \nNVVN,  a  subsidiary  of  NTPC  and  the  nodal  agency  appointed  by  the \nGovernment  of  India,  entered  into  a  PPA  for  250  MW  in  2012  prior  to \nloan disbursement, indicating the specific stations from where power will \nbe  supplied  and  the  tariff-setting  parameters.  BPDB  and  PGCIL  have \nentered into a bulk power transmission agreement. \nPGCB  is  earning  a  profit  in  2012  and  financial  parameters  are  within \nacceptable  limits.  Early  implementation  of  BERC\u2019s  transmission  tariff \nregulations would improve PGCB\u2019s financial position.
