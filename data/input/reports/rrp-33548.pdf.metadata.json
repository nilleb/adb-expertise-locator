The  project  area  covers  three  oblast  (province)\ncapital  cities  with  high  incidence  of  poverty\u2014Djizzak,  Gulistan,\nand Karshi\u2014in the central and southern parts of the country. The\nProject  will  improve  water  supply  services  to  about  484,000\npeople of whom about 45 percent are poor.\n\nCategory B. An initial environmental examination was undertaken,\nthe  summary  is  a  core  appendix.  The  Project  will  not  have  any\nadverse impact on the environment but will have a positive impact\nby  improving  the  quality  of  delivered  water  and  the  efficiency  of\noperation.\n\nSince  independence  in  1991,  inadequate  budgetary  support  for\nurban  infrastructure  in  Uzbekistan  has  led  to  the  deterioration  of\nservice  provision.  Operation  and  maintenance  of  aging  assets  is\nbecoming \nincreasingly  difficult,  performance  efficiency  has\ndropped,  and  the  cost  of  service  delivery  has  risen.  Since  urban\nwater supply plays a vital role in determining the living standards\nand  pattern  of  human  development,  this  deterioration  must  be\nstopped.  The  capacity  of  the  sector  agencies  concerned  must\nalso  be  developed  to  enable  them  to  implement  upgrading\nprograms  and  to  undertake  operation  and  maintenance  of  the\nsystems in the long term. In line with the Government\u2019s policy to\ndecentralize  authority  and  responsibility  for  urban  infrastructure\nand its assets to the local authorities, the Project will improve the\nprovision  and  management  of  water  supply  to  the  cities  of\nDjizzak,  Gulistan,  and  Karshi.  All  three  cities  urgently  need\nrehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  basic  water  supply  facilities  and\nthat  are  barely  meeting  national  standards  and\nservices \nincreasingly lag behind growing demand. Currently only about 60\npercent of the population receive some water every day. Because\nassets frequently fail to operate, water is often rationed for a few\nhours a day. If the water systems in these cities are not upgraded,\nthey will fail to operate within the next 5 to 10 years.\n\nThe  main  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  improve  the  quality  of  life\nand  health  conditions  in  the  provincial  capital  cities  of  Djizzak,\nGulistan, and Karshi, where over 45 percent of the population are\npoor.  The  Project  will  improve  basic  water  supply  through  two\n\nObjective and Scope\n\n\fiii\n\ncomponents:  water  supply  and  capacity  building.  The  water\nsupply  component  will  include  rehabilitating  and  upgrading  the\nwater supply systems in the three cities. The aim is to secure 24-\nhour  supply,  minimize  unaccounted  for  water  losses  from  about\n40  percent  to  30  percent,  increase  supply  efficiency,  and  lower\nunit  costs.  The  capacity  building  component  includes  a  training\nprogram  for  local  governments  and  agencies  responsible  for\nwater supply; social development measures such as involvement\nin\nof  nongovernment  and  community-based  organizations \ncommunity  participation  and  consumer  awareness  initiatives  to\nimprove  distribution  and  penetration  of  benefits;  and  consulting\nservices for project management support.\n\nThe estimated project cost is $65.5 million equivalent, comprising\nforeign  exchange  costs  of  $32.9  million  (50  percent)  and  local\ncurrency costs equivalent to $32.6 million (50 percent).\n\nSources of Financing\n\nAsian Development Bank\n\nCentral Government\n\nLocal Government\nTotal\n\nForeign\nExchange\n32.9\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n3.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n32.9\n\n10.1\n\n19.4\n32.6\n\n($ million)\n  Total Percent\n\n36.0\n\n10.1\n\n19.4\n65.5\n\n55.0\n\n16.0\n\n29.0\n100.0\n\nIt is proposed that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provide a\nloan of $36.0 million from its ordinary capital resources. The loan\nwill have a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years,\nwith  interest  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  pool-based\nvariable lending rate system1 for US dollar loans, and will carry a\ncommitment  charge  of  0.75  percent  per  annum,  and  a  front-end\nfee of 1.0 percent of the loan amount.\n\nCost Estimates\n\nFinancing Plan\n\nLoan Amount and Terms\n\nPeriod of Utilization\n\nUntil 30 June 2007\n\nExecuting Agency\n\nUzbekistan Communal Services Agency (UCSA)\n\nImplementation\nArrangements\n\nresponsible \n\nA  central  project  management  unit  will  be  established  within\nUCSA  and  be \nfor  planning,  organizing,  and\nimplementing  the  Project.  Project  implementation  units  will  be\nestablished  in  each  of  the  three  project  cities  for  financial  and\nprocurement  management.  The  three  water  supply  agencies  in\nthe  project  cities  and \nthe  UCSA  General  Directorate  on\nInterregional Water Trunk Mains will be responsible for day-to-day\nimplementation activities. A project steering committee comprising\n\n                  \n\n1  The Government is reviewing details of the loan product based on the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR), and\nduring  loan  negotiations  decided  to  use  the  pool-based  US  dollar  facility  for  the  Project.  The  loan  terms  may  be\nrevised, as appropriate, if and when the Borrower chooses to borrow under the LIBOR-based loan product for this\nProject.\n\n\fProcurement\n\nConsulting Services\n\nEstimated Project\nCompletion Date\n\nProject Benefits and\nBeneficiaries\n\niv\n\nrepresentatives  from  central  and  local  governments  has  been\nformed to provide policy guidance, and to monitor and supervise\noverall project implementation.\n\nThe  procurement  of  goods  and  services  to  be  financed  by  the\nADB loan will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines\nfor Procurement. International competitive bidding procedures will\nbe applied for supply contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of\n$500,000  or  more,  and  civil  works  contracts  valued  at  over  $1.0\nmillion.  Supply  contracts  with  a  value  of  less  than  $500,000\nequivalent  will  follow  international  shopping  or  local  competitive\nbidding,  as  applicable.  Civil  works  contracts  valued  at  less  than\n$1.0 million will be carried out under local competitive bidding.\n\nThe Project will require 405 person-months of consulting services\n(45  person-months  of  international  and  360  person-months  of\ndomestic)  for  design  engineering,  finance  and  accounting,  social\ndevelopment, community development, and project management.\nConsultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines\non the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to\nADB for the engagement of domestic consultants.\n\n31 December 2006\n\nThe Project will directly benefit about 484,000 people in the cities\nof  Djizzak,  Gulistan,  and  Karshi,  where  about  45  percent  of  the\npopulation  are  poor.  The  support  for  decentralized  management\nand capacity building will enhance the efficiency and sustainability\nof urban water supply services at local levels. To comply with the\nneeds  and  demands  of  the  community,  a  participatory  approach\nwas  adopted  to  formulate  and  design  the  Project,  and  the\ncommunity  will  continue  to  be  involved  in  implementation.  Upon\ncompletion  of  the  Project,  all  residential,  commercial,  industrial,\nand  institutional  consumers  will  receive  24-hour  water  supply.\nHuman development benefits include improvements to the health\nand general welfare of the population, especially the poor who are\nless able to afford other coping mechanisms such as large water\nstorage containers and bottled water. Time will be saved for more\nproductive  activities,  particularly  for  women  who  are  often\nresponsible  for  collecting  water.  By  reducing  water  losses  and\nwastage,  the  existing  inefficiencies  and  resulting  costs  will  be\nminimized.  A  new  tariff  structure  will  be  introduced  where  users\nare  charged  by  the  volume  of  water  consumed.  The  proposed\ntariff structure is targeted at full cost recovery while providing the\nnecessary  mechanisms  to  protect  vulnerable  sections  of  the\ncommunity  against  unaffordable  cost  increases.  To  this  end,  a\nlifeline  tariff  will  be  introduced  where  a  low  tariff  is  set  for  low\nconsumption  to  ensure  that  benefits  reach  the  poor.  The\nproposed  average  residential  tariff  charges  are  about  4  to  5\npercent of the household income in the project cities. These are in\n\n\fTechnical Assistance\n\nv\n\nline  with  ADB\u2019s  affordability  criteria  of  5  percent  of  household\nincome and are within the consumers\u2019 average willingness to pay.\n\nSecurity of supply and improved standards of service will increase\nthe willingness to pay for service and will assist in cost recovery.\nFinancial  management  and  accounting  improvements,  including\nmeter  reading,  billing,  and  collection  will  improve  tariff  collection\nlevels  and  the  viability  of  the  implementing  agencies.  The\neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  for  the  project  components  in\nDjizzak  is  18.2  percent;  Gulistan,  17.2  percent;  and  Karshi,  24.4\npercent;  all  exceed  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital,\nwhich is assumed to be 12 percent. The financial internal rates of\nreturn  for  the  project  component  in  Djizzak  and  Gulistan  are  9.5\npercent,  and  in  Karshi,  8.4  percent,  exceeding  the  weighted\naverage  cost  of  capital,  which  is  about  5.0  percent,  and\ndemonstrating that each component is financially viable.\n\nAn  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA),  Capacity  Building  for\nUrban  Water  Supply,  will  be  provided  in  conjunction  with  the\nProject.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $860,000  equivalent,\ncomprising  $513,500  of  foreign  exchange  cost,  and  $346,500\nequivalent  of  local  currency  cost.  ADB  will  finance  $600,000\nequivalent,  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  Japan  Special  Fund,  to\ncover the entire foreign exchange cost and $86,500 equivalent of\nthe  local  currency  cost.  The  Government  will  finance  the\nremaining $260,000 equivalent of the local currency costs.\n\nThe  TA  will  help  the  Government  strengthen  the  capacity  of  its\nsector  institutions  and  train  concerned  staff  at  various  levels  of\ngovernment  in  appropriate  management  systems  for  delivering\nsustainable  urban  water  supply  services.

Operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of\naging  assets  is  becoming  increasingly  difficult  and  the  cost  of  service  delivery  has  risen.  The\nGovernment  recognizes  the  need  for  institutional  change  and  development.  Under  its  reform\npolicy,  the  Government  has  decentralized  authority  and  responsibility  for  the  operation  and\nmanagement  of  urban  infrastructure  assets  to  local  authorities.  The  Asian  Development  Bank\n(ADB)  through  its  country  operational  strategy1  seeks  to  assist  Uzbekistan  in  managing  the\ntransition  to  a  market  economy  and  reduce  poverty  through  institutional  development.\nAssistance in the urban sector is aimed at addressing governance and decentralization issues,\nparticularly in the provision of communal services and management.\n\n3.\nIn 1999, the Government asked ADB to support the improvement of urban infrastructure\nat the local level. ADB approved a TA2 in May 2000 to assist the Government in preparing its\nfirst  urban  infrastructure  project.  The  TA  was  implemented  by  the  Uzbekistan  Communal\nServices  Agency  (Uzcommunkhizmat)  (UCSA)3  and  was  completed  in  July  2001.  The  TA\nsupported  local  capacity  building  and  designed  an  investment  proposal  for  decentralized\ndevelopment of urban infrastructure in three cities. The TA was divided into three parts. Part A\nassessed  the  current  situation  and  proposed  measures  to  strengthen  urban  infrastructure\npolicies,  including  preparation  of  an  urban  infrastructure  sector  profile.  Part  B  was  the\npreparation  of  a  medium-term  urban  infrastructure  investment  program  where  priority  projects\nfor  the  next  5  to  10  years  were  identified.  After  screening  investment  needs  in  various  urban\nsubsectors, the highest needs were established for water supply, heating, and hot water. Under\npart  C,  the  TA  consultants  helped  the  central  and  local  governments  and  sector  agencies\ndevelop  an  investment  proposal  covering  three  water  supply  and  two  heating  and  hot  water\ncomponents  in  three  cities,  and  a  capacity  building  program.  Due  to  insufficient  counterpart\nfunds  to  cover  all  the  components,  the  Government  decided  to  proceed  with  only  the  water\nsupply  component,  in  line  with  its  priority  program  for  the  urban  infrastructure  sector.  The\nproposed  Project  was  prepared  in  close  consultation  with  the  communities,  and  detailed\nanalyses,  including  socioeconomic  surveys,  were  carried  out.  A  participatory  approach,\ninvolving  the  communities  and  local  government  agencies,  was  used  to  formulate  the  Project.\nThis report is based on the findings of the Appraisal Mission from 26 June to 13 July 20014 and\n\n                  \n\n1  Memo to Board 120-00, STS: UZB 2000-05, Country Operational Strategy Study for Uzbekistan, April 2000.\n2  TA 3440-UZB: Urban Social Infrastructure Development Project, for $720,000, approved on 18 May 2000.\n3  UCSA,  the  former  Ministry  of  Communal  Services,  was  established  under  President  Decree  No.  2791  (19\nDecember 2000) and its organization and functions were approved by the Cabinet of Ministers under Resolution\nNo. 493 (21 December 2000). The reorganization is part of the Government\u2019s reform and decentralization policy for\ncommunal services.\n\n4  The  Appraisal  Mission  comprised  A.  Leung,  Urban  Development  Specialist,  Mission  Leader;  R.  Kumar,  Senior\nEconomist;  E.  Yang,  Senior  Financial  Management  Specialist;  L.  Nazarbekova,  Counsel;  C.

The\nterritory  comprises  448,000  square  kilometers  with  a  population  of  24.58  million  in  2000  of\nwhich  about  9.2  million  (38  percent)  is  urban.  The  country  has  22  cities  with  Tashkent,  the\ncountry\u2019s  capital,  being  the  largest  with  a  population  of  2.1  million.  The  six  largest  cities  have\npopulations between 200,000 and 400,000.5\n\n5.\nUzbekistan  has  adopted  its  own  form  of  a  gradualist  reform  strategy  to  minimize  the\nsocial costs of transition. The depth and duration of the postindependence decline in incomes\nhas  been  less  severe  than  in  other  Commonwealth  of  Independent  States  countries.  Modest\neconomic  growth  resumed  in  1996.  In  1998  and  1999,  the  economy  suffered  from  three\nexogenous  shocks:  the  Russian  Federation\u2019s  financial  crisis;  adverse  weather  conditions  that\naffected  the  cotton  harvests;  and  low  international  prices  for  gold  and  cotton,  Uzbekistan\u2019s\nprincipal  exports.  In  1999  and  2000  the  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  grew  by  4.4  and  4.0\npercent.  However,  inflation  is  high,  exceeding  24  percent  in  2000,  and  is  expected  to  remain\nhigh. Interest rates continue to remain negative in real terms and the investment climate has not\nimproved.  The  external  sector  situation  is  a  cause  of  concern  with  the  external  debt  servicing\nburden rising, and the current account continuing to deteriorate. Economic performance in 2001\nis  forecast  to  remain  modest  in  2001  with  GDP  growth  at  4.5  percent,  inflation  at  22  percent,\nand  the  balance  of  payment  situation  still  under  pressure.  The  agriculture  sector  faces\nworsening  prospects  both  on  account  of  recent  adverse  weather  conditions  and  continued\ndistortion of the incentives structure due to administrative controls and regulations. The industry\nsector  may  receive  a  boost  as  a  result  of  the  concessions  announced  for  the  small-  and\nmedium-size  enterprise  sector  on  22  June  2001.6  These  have  improved  access  of  small-  and\nmedium-size enterprises to foreign exchange and included some policy changes that will raise\ntheir profitability.\n\n6.\nThe  three  key  transition  issues  facing  Uzbekistan  today  are  (i)  the  foreign  exchange\nregime, which is characterized by multiple exchange rates; (ii) the state procurement system for\nhigh-value  (high-liquidity)  commodities  like  gold  and  cotton;  and  (iii)  the  combination  of\nmonetary and fiscal policies that are resulting in annual inflation rates of about 20 percent. The\nGovernment  has  taken  steps  (footnote  6)  to  unify  the  three  exchange  rates  by  expanding  the\nscope of the commercial rate, which is determined by demand and supply of foreign currency.\nFor  the  state  procurement  system,  a  small  but  significant  step  is  permitting  some  changes  in\nsetting the procurement target on an individual basis and allowing extra production to be sold at\n\n                  \n\n5  Cities  with  populations  between  200,000  and  400,000  include  Andijan,  Bukhara,  Karshi,  Namangan,  Nukus,  and\nSamarkand.  Cities  with  less  than  200,000  population  include  Almalyk,  Angren,  Bekabad,  Chirchik,  Djizzak,\nFergana, Gulistan, Hojeyli, Kattadurgan, Khiva, Kokhand, Navoi, Shahrixabz, Termez, and Urgench.\n\n6  Resolution No. 263, On Measures of Further Liberalization of the Currency Market, 22 June 2001.\n\n\f3\n\na negotiated price on a pilot basis in one region. This has been done in the context of the ADB-\nfunded Ak Altin Agricultural Development Project.7\n\nDuring \n\nlong-term \n\ninvestment  was  made \n\nthe  Soviet  era  considerable \n\n7.\nin  urban\ninfrastructure.  Based  on  Soviet  technical  norms,  this  was  capital  intensive  and  expensive  to\nmaintain.  Moreover,  given  the  past  practice  of  minimal  charges  for  delivery  of  public  services,\nthese infrastructure assets have not only lagged behind growing needs of the expanding urban\npopulation, but also are not being adequately maintained. The financial constraints faced by the\nGovernment  during  the  transition  period  have  also  resulted  in  cutbacks  in  public  expenditure.\nThis  has  negatively  affected  the  quality  and  scope  of  coverage  of  public  services  in  smaller\ntowns,  in  particular;  they  also  suffer  from  weaker  financial  capacities.  An  ADB  assessment  of\ninfrastructure  needs  in  22  cities  revealed  an  urgent  need  to  rehabilitate  and  upgrade  urban\nwater  supply  capacity  and  services  in  many  of  the  smaller  cities.  The  review  also  indicated  a\nstrong need for the water utilities in these cities to adopt modern management and accounting\npractices.\n\n2. \n\nFinancial Constraints\n\n8.\nDuring  the  Soviet  era,  government-funded  public  organizations  were  responsible  for\nproviding  urban  infrastructure  services.  Financial  management  was  not  based  on  commercial\nprinciples. While tariffs were in place before independence, they were low and not intended to\ncover  the  full  cost  of  service  provision.  Since  1991,  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  policy  on\ntransition to a market economy, institutions responsible for providing public services have been\nundergoing  a  transition  to  become  self-financing  organizations.  Institutions  such  as  the\nvodokanals  (water  supply  and  sewerage  agencies)  have  been  working  on  a  self-financing\nprinciple  since  the  Soviet  period.  However,  weaknesses  in  collecting  water  charges  and\nmanaging  the  financial  system  mean  that  they  continue  to  remain  dependent  on  budget\nallocations  for  any  capacity  upgrading  or  expansion.  Recent  financial  performance  of  public\nservices  utility  agencies  indicates  that  all  are  suffering  from  acute  financial  constraints  arising\nfrom increasing expenditures due to inflationary pressure and deteriorating assets that require\nurgent  maintenance.  Inadequate  delivery  of  urban  infrastructure  services  is  a  direct  result  of\nthese  financial  constraints.  For  the  water  utilities  in  most  cities,  although  tariffs  have  been\nincreased for residential, industrial, and government consumers since 1997, collection rates are\nlow  and  falling,  partly  because  of  the  poor  and  decreasing  standard  of  service.  The  water\nutilities  are  all  in  a  difficult  financial  position  and  constrained  by  lack  of  funding  to  expand  or\nmodernize  their  facilities.  Thus,  these  agencies  need  to  strengthen  their  capacity  to  better\nmanage their assets, operations, and finances. Governance of these organizations should also\nbe improved to ensure accountability and transparency of their operation and management. The\nutility agencies recognize their weaknesses and are committed to reform.\n\n3. \n\nPoverty and Social Protection\n\n9.\nPoverty  in  Uzbekistan  is  multidimensional  in  character.  Low-income  families  rely  on\nstrong family support and assistance from the Government. While the incidence and extent of\npoverty has worsened since independence due to a decline in income, Government programs\nfor output stabilization, and expenditure on health, education, and social protection are having a\npositive impact. For example, low-income families that are unable to afford payments for basic\nneeds and services such as food, water, and heating may apply for social protection payments,\nwhich is a system of social benefit available for categories of disadvantaged people. The social\n\n7  Loan 1833-UZB: Ak Altin Agricultural Development Project, for $36 million, approved on 23 August 2001.\n\n                  \n\n\f4\n\nprotection  budget  is  allocated  from  central  Government  funds  to  each  mahalla8  (local  self-\nmanagement civil committee) on the assumption that the poorest households (especially large\nfamilies and pensioners living alone) in the mahalla will be assisted.\n\nThe average per capita monthly income in 2000 was estimated at SUM6,480.9 However,\n10.\nunderreporting  means  that  the  real  income  of  some  households  is  30  to  40  percent  higher.\nSince  independence,  inequality  in  income  distribution  has  increased  between  income  groups,\nsectors, and regions. The national Gini coefficient grew significantly from 0.26 in 1991 to 0.42 in\n1998 (footnote 1).10 The Government classifies the poor as a vulnerable and low-income group\nbased  only  on  the  prevailing  minimum  wage.11  Poor  families  are  often  headed  by  women  and\nusually comprise more than six persons. While the poor work in low-paid public sector positions,\nagriculture,  or  home  production,  or  are  unemployed,  they  normally  have  access  to  formal\nschooling  and  some  secondary  education.  In  these  circumstances  a  large  proportion  of  urban\ncommunities  have  not  been  able  to  afford  to  pay  the  full  O&M  cost  of  existing  facilities,  and\ncertainly not to invest in new ones. Overall, the quality of living conditions, including access to\npotable  water,  has  significantly  declined  during  the  economic  transition  for  a  major  part  of  the\npopulation.\n\n11.\nThe Government does not have a generally agreed or reliable measure of poverty, or an\nofficial  poverty  line.  The  household  survey  is  the  main  source  for  monitoring  living  standards.\nBased  on  the  before  independence  poverty  line  definition  of  75  roubles  per  capita  per  month,\nthe incidence of poverty was estimated at 44 percent of the working population. If this measure\nis  updated  for the  latest household  survey (1996)12  to  SUM740  per  capita  per  month  then  the\nincidence  of  poverty  in  1996  was  21.1  percent.  More  recent  work  by  the  World  Bank  and\nin  Tashkent,  Fergana,  and\nDeutsche  Gesellschaft \nKarakalpakstan using the minimum wage criteria estimated urban poverty in these areas at 10,\n28,  and  50  percent,  respectively.  In  the  same  survey,  self-ranked  poverty  (i.e.,  not  having\nenough money for food and medicines) in these areas ranged between 30 to 70 percent of the\npopulation.\n\nf\u00fcr  Technische  Zusammenarbeit(cid:1)\n\n12.\nUsing the World Bank definition of poverty of $1 per day, the equivalent monthly income\nper capita in Uzbekistan ranges from SUM9,900 at the official exchange rate, to approximately\nSUM25,000 at the commercial exchange rate, and SUM27,750 at the market rate. Even at the\nofficial exchange rate, the average income in Uzbekistan is approximately two thirds of the $1\nper day level. Use of the $1 per day definition for poverty results in the majority of the population\nbeing categorized as poor. The United Nations Development Programme estimated the poverty\nline based on a basket of goods for the lowest 10 percent of income groups to be SUM1,006 per\n\n                  \n\n8  The  mahalla  system  is  a  traditional  cultural  form  of  local  government  in  Uzbekistan.  These  traditional  mahallas\nhave replaced the former committee networks of the Soviet system and provide a highly decentralized and flexible\nsystem of benefit targeting. They are based on a group of elders who try to resolve conflicts and social problems\nwithin  the  community.  The  mahallas  are  responsible  for  administering  social  assistance  on  behalf  of  the  state.\nThere are about 12,000 local level mahallas with an average of 700 households per mahalla (range from 150 to\n1,500 households).\n\n9  Government of Uzbekistan. 2000.

They  may  be  summarized  as  (i)  geographically  restricted  raw  water  resources;  (ii)\npollution of potential resources; (iii) nonoptimal management and operation of raw water supply\nsystems; (iv) absence of suitable pressure controls and restricted available pressure; (v) limited\nmetering; (vi) difficulties in maintaining existing pumping equipment and a lack of investment in\nreplacement  pumps;  (vii)  insufficient  capacity  in  reservoirs  to  respond  to  diurnal  variations  in\ndemand;  (viii)  old  and  deteriorated  water  distribution  networks;  (ix)  high  degree  of  system\nlosses,  i.e.,  unaccounted  for  water;  (x)  absence  of  effective  demand  management;  (xi)  public\nattitude to water as an inexhaustible and very cheap resource resulting in wastage and low tariff\ncollection rates; (xii) poor condition of irrigation systems leading to the alternative use of potable\nwater  for  garden  and  land  watering;  and  (xiii)  poor  quality  of  technical  equipment  in  the\nvodokanals.  Many  of  these  problems  relate  to  lack  of  funding.  As  water  is  a  basic  need,  the\nGovernment is giving improvement to the water supply a high priority in its program.\n\nThe oblast  (province)  and  city  vodokanals  are  responsible  for  the  provision  of  potable\n14.\nwater  in  Uzbekistan.  Water  resources  are  drawn  from  the  Syrdarya  and  Amudarya  rivers  and\nfrom aquifers. Only 10 percent and 8 percent, respectively, of the watersheds of these rivers are\nwithin the borders of Uzbekistan, and hence the country has little control of water quantity and\nquality. The geographical distribution of underground water is uneven; most aquifers are in the\neastern part of the country. Westward, both rivers and aquifers are polluted by organic matter\nand industrial wastes, and contain high mineral content. The sources for potable water supplies\nto the cities vary from borehole to river and canal abstraction or a combination of both. Because\nof  the  problems  of  high  mineral  and  organic  content  of  water  and  the  restricted  availability  of\nresources  in  some  regions,  water  supply  has  often  been  undertaken  on  a  regional  basis,  with\ntransmission over long distances.\n\n15.\nOver  90  percent  of  the  urban  areas  are  connected  to  piped  water  supply.  However,\nwater  resource  capacity  is  limited  due  to  insufficient  borehole  yield  to  permit  a  continuous\nsupply. Reservoir storage is also restricted and actual demand reduces reserves to very short\nperiods contributing to the need to schedule supplies in some areas. Water supply in all major\ncities  is  by  means  of  interconnected  reticulation  networks,  which  are  pressurized  by  second-\nstage pumping. Pumping is reduced at night when demand falls but otherwise the entire supply\nnetwork  is  designed  to  accommodate  peak  flows.  The  distribution  systems  tend  to  be  old,  in\nvarying  stages  of  disrepair,  and  prone  to  high  levels  of  leakage.  The  pumping  equipment  is\nfrequently  considerably  more  than  25  years  old,  and  is  of  Russian  origin,  making  spare  parts\ndifficult  to  obtain.  Cannibalization  of  some  equipment  keeps  others  operational.  The  aging\nassets have resulted in poor delivery of services. Water rationing is common in all cities. Most\nindustry  is  metered  and  the  remaining  water  supplied  is  then  attributed  to  consumer  demand\n\n                  \n\n13 UNDP. 1996. Method of Calculating Poverty in Uzbekistan. Tashkent.\n14 TA to prepare a medium-term strategy for improving the living standards for the people of Uzbekistan is currently\nbeing  processed.  One  of  its  outputs  will  be  to  determine  the  appropriate  poverty  threshold  to  be  used  as  the\nbaseline for identifying target groups for poverty interventions. The TA is expected to be completed by the end of\n2001.\n\n\f6\n\n(including losses and wastage) resulting in a range of 250 liters per capita per day (lcd) to nearly\n1,000 lcd (about six times the average in European cities). This use is in addition to the supply\nof between 200 to 400 lcd of hot water. At present only 1.8 percent of domestic consumption is\nmetered.15\n\n16. Wastewater treatment facilities are provided in all major cities. The systems connect with\nalmost  all  apartment  buildings  and  some  private  housing.  The  extent  of  the  sewerage  system\nvaries according to city and ranges from 30 to 90 percent. The TA assessed that the sewerage\nsystem appears to be operating with fewer problems than the water supply system, despite its\naging facilities. The Government has plans to improve the coverage of the sewerage system to\nat least 70 percent by 2010. However, due to financial constraints at the local government level,\npriority is given to water supply and upgrading of the water supply systems. Once Government\nlegislation  on  pollution  charging  is  fully  operational  and  tariffs  are  properly  recovered,\nopportunities for self-funding of necessary improvements will be available.\n\n5. \n\nGovernment Institutions\n\n17.\nGovernment institutions involved in the investment, management, and delivery of urban\ncommunal  services  such  as  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  heating  are  UCSA,  oblast  and  city\ngovernments,  the  territorial  communal  exploitation  agencies  (TCEAs),  and  the  oblast  and  city\nvodokanals.  The  institutional  structure  for  communal  services  is  shown  in  Appendix  2.  UCSA\nwas established as a result of the reorganization of the former Ministry of Communal Services\n(footnote 3) in support of Government policy to decentralize communal services to local levels.\nThe department responsible for water was reorganized into a general directorate responsible for\noperation and development of interregional water trunk mains, and all other responsibilities for\nthe delivery of drinking water were devolved to the oblast and city levels. The technical design\ninstitutes  for  communal  services  and  the  center  for  developing  norms  and  guidelines  and\ntechnical  training  report  to  UCSA.  UCSA,  which  reports  to  the  Cabinet  of  Ministers,  is  now  a\nself-financing institution funded by income from the enterprises and organizations that comprise\nit.\n\n18.\nThe TCEA for each oblast has overall responsibility for providing housing and communal\nservices  in  their  area,  including  drinking  water,  central  heating,  and  sewerage.  According  to\nResolution  No.  493  (footnote  3),  the  TCEA  reports  to  the  oblast  government.  However,  the\nTCEA  still  has  working  relations  with  UCSA,  which  coordinates  work  to  reform  the  communal\nservices system, develops and approves the normative-legal acts, and implements controls for\nthe observance of current legislation and established technical requirements. The oblast TCEA\nis responsible for the main capital development and infrastructure programs in the oblast and is\nin charge of the oblast vodokanals. The oblast vodokanal manages the city vodokanal, which is\nresponsible  for  providing  drinking  water  within  the  city.  The  city  vodokanal  also  works  closely\nwith the city government, which is the owner of the communal assets, and is fully responsible for\nsystem O&M in the city.\n\n6. \n\nCommunity-Based and Nongovernment Organizations\n\n19.\nPart  of  the  Government\u2019s  decentralization  and  reform  policy  is  to  increase  community\nparticipation  in  the  development  of  communal  services.  To  this  end,  the  Government  issued\nResolution  No.  363  on  self-governing  of  the  community.  NGOs  and  community-based\norganizations  (CBOs)  have  been  developed  with  varying  degrees  of  success.  Mahalla\n\n15 Uzbekistan Communal Services Agency, April 2001.\n\n                  \n\n\f7\n\ncommittees  are  CBOs  that  administer  local  funds  to  provide  welfare  to  vulnerable  households\n(footnote  8),  execute  local  projects,  and  perform  ceremonies  at  the  local  community  level.\nExamples  of  prominent  local  NGOs  are  Kamalot  and  Red  Crescent.  The  former  is  a  self-\ngovernment  organization  founded  to  raise  funds  for  youth  development,  including  small\nbusiness  development.  The  latter  is  affiliated  with  an  international  NGO  in  the  health  sector.\nMahalla committees and NGOs must be involved in the Project to facilitate public participation in\nproject  implementation,  monitoring,  and  sustainability.  As  most  of  the  local  NGOs  were  only\nestablished  recently,  their  coverage  is  not  wide  and  they  are  facing  various  operational\nproblems. Lack of funding and training capacity are major constraints for many of the NGOs.\n\nB. \n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\nThe  Government\u2019s  urban  sector  policy  supports  its  overall  five-year  development\n20.\nstrategy in which the priorities include further democratization of society and liberalization of the\neconomy.  Within  this  context,  commitment  to  institutional  and  financial  reforms  in  the  urban\ninfrastructure sector is significant in current Government policy, decrees, and resolutions. This is\nparticularly evident with Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers No. 461 (3 November 1998), The\nConcept of Deepening Economic Reforms in the Communal Services System of the Republic of\nUzbekistan. This emphasizes decentralizing the delivery of services and increasing the level of\nprivatization and private sector participation in the sector.\n\n21.\nReorganization  of  the  communal  services  system  reinforces  the  reforms  (para.  17).\nHowever,  the  progress  of  these  policies  is  constrained  by  the  financial  limitations  on  new\ninvestment. Urban infrastructure investment projects by ADB and others are needed to support,\nfinance, and focus these financial and institutional reforms through their implementation policies.\nIn particular, urban infrastructure investment should promote decentralized implementation and\nsupport private sector participation and other market reforms.\n\nC. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n22.\nExternal assistance to the urban water supply sector is limited. This includes an ongoing\nWorld Bank water supply and health project in the cities of Nukus and Urgench in the western\nand  poorest  part  of  the  country,  and  a  project  under  preparation  by  the  World  Bank  for  water\nsupply  in  the  cities  of  Bukhara  and  Samarkand.  Bilateral  assistance  includes  a  number  of\nprojects under preparation. The French government is proposing assistance to water supply and\nsanitation  in  the  cities  of  Namangan  and  Samarkand,  and  the  Spanish  government  is\nconsidering  assistance  for  water  supply  in  Bukhara.  Appendix  3  lists  external  assistance\ninitiatives  by  multilateral  and  bilateral  funding  agencies  to  the  urban  water  supply  sector.  The\nproposed Project will be ADB\u2019s first urban project in the country. In preparing the Project, close\ncontact  was  maintained  with  major  urban  sector  assistance  agencies.  This  has  led  to  joint\napproaches  on  strategies  to  assist  the  Government  in  decentralizing  communal  services  and\nimproving  the  governance  and  financial  performance  of  sector  institutes.  These  include  tariff\nreforms, project implementation at the local levels, and introduction of international accounting\nand  financial  management  systems.  Furthermore,  the  Project  includes  a  comprehensive\ncommunity participation and capacity building program, which is complementary to the reform of\nthe  communal  services  sector  through  stronger  stakeholder  involvement.  The  Project  was\nprocessed in close coordination with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development,\n\n\f8\n\nwhich  is  currently  processing  in  parallel  a  heating  and  hot  water  project16  in  two  of  the  three\nproject cities.\n\nD. \n\nLessons Learned\n\n23.\nAs  this  will  be  ADB\u2019s  first  funding  of  an  urban  project  in  Uzbekistan,  experience  from\nimplementing urban projects financed by other external funding agencies and ADB\u2019s portfolio in\nother sectors were considered when designing the Project. Several lessons have been learned.\nOn  the  preparation  of  projects,  overall  processing  has  been  protracted  because  of  difficulties\nencountered during policy dialogue and policy uncertainty. The project development process is\noften  delayed  due  to  a  prolonged  process  for  releasing  information.  More  stakeholder\nconsultation and participation is required when preparing projects in accordance with the needs\nof  the  Government  and  beneficiaries  to  ensure  ownership  and  commitment.  The  Government\nrecognizes  the  need  to  focus  on  sustainability  of  operations  and  increasing  ownership  by\nbeneficiaries.\n\nThe  lessons  from  ADB  urban  projects  in  other  countries,  in  particular  those  in  Central\n24.\nAsia have also been studied. In general, the implementation agencies\u2019 limited experience with\nproject implementation has led to delays and slow disbursement. Another problem is the weak\ninstitutional  capacity  of  the  local  governments  where  substantial  technical  and  financial\nassistance  is  required.  These  issues  were  discussed  with  the  Government  during  project\nformulation  and  appropriate  measures  including  project  management  support  and  training\nprograms on implementation procedures have been comprehensively incorporated in the project\ndesign.\n\nThe  Government  and  ADB  are  now \n\n25.\nfocusing  on  community  consultation  and\nparticipation,  and  on  decentralizing  the  implementation  process.  While  the  capacity  and\npotential  for  NGO  involvement  in  project  development  is  recognized,  their  appropriateness\nneeds  to  be  measured  against  carefully  defined  criteria  to  ensure  successful  project\nimplementation.  Best  practices  indicate  that  NGOs  and  CBOs  have  certain  strengths  and\nweaknesses. Project design has taken these into consideration. City-based NGOs are important\nand can contribute much where they have established networks. NGO and CBO training will be\nsupported  by  the  Project  through  a  comprehensive  capacity  building  program  for  local  sector\nagencies.\n\nE. \n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n\n26.\nThe  central  goal  of  ADB\u2019s  strategy  in  Uzbekistan  is  to  help  manage  the  transition  to  a\nmarket-based economy, and support sustainable poverty reduction and improved standards of\nliving.  In  support  of  this  goal,  ADB\u2019s  operational  strategies  are  defined  as  (i)  assisting  the\nGovernment in managing the transition to an economy that relies on market-based institutions;\n(ii)  supporting  basic  reforms  including  strengthening  the  institutional  capacity  for  governance\nand specifically the development of financial institutions; (iii) minimizing the social costs of the\ntransition and increasing human development through TA and investment activities in education,\nearly childhood development, and urban development; and (iv) fully unlocking the potential for\nfuture  economic  growth  by  encouraging  regional  cooperation  in  trade,  supporting  agriculture\n\n                  \n\n16 The heating and hot water component was originally included in the design of the proposed Project. At the request\nof  the  Government,  this  component  was  deleted  due  to  inadequate  counterpart  funding.  Subsequently,  the\nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development expressed interest and is processing it as a separate project\nin  parallel  to  the  proposed  Project.  The  two  projects  will  mutually  improve  urban  infrastructure  services  in  the\nproject cities to maximize benefits to the population.\n\n\f9\n\nand  rural  development,  and  providing  direct  support  to  the  private  sector,  especially  in\ncomplementing public sector projects.\n\n27.\nADB\u2019s  assistance  in  the  urban  sector  will  be  particularly  orientated  to  addressing\ngovernance  and  decentralization  issues,  especially  in  providing  communal  services  and\nmanagement.  Urban  governance  encompasses \ninstitutional  strengthening  and  capacity\nbuilding,  community  participation,  and  involvement  of  the  private  sector.  Ongoing  policy\nchanges  in  the  delivery  of  municipal  services  should  improve  the  transparency  and\naccountability of local governments and participation of the target beneficiaries in governance-\nrelated decision making. The Project will support these issues.\n\n28.\nADB\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy  supports  the  development  of  accountable  local\ngovernments  and  improved  urban  management  to  address  the  problem  of  inadequate  and\ninefficient municipal services that affect the urban poor. ADB is helping the Government prepare\na national strategy for improving living standards of the vulnerable and poorer income groups.\nThe  Government  has  indicated  that  improved  water  supply  and  other  urban  infrastructure\nservices  in  poor  areas  will  be  an  integral  part  of  this  strategy.  In  line  with  its  emphasis  on\npoverty  reduction,  ADB  TA  to  prepare  a  national  strategy  to  improve  the  living  standards\n(footnote 14) is currently being processed for completion in 2001. This will likely culminate in a\npoverty partnership agreement in the first half of 2002. The Project, which will have a significant\nimpact on the urban poor, supports the priorities of both the Government and ADB.\n\nF. \n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\n1. \n\nInstitutional Reform and Decentralization of Implementation\n\n29.\nInfrastructure  investments  have  traditionally  been  planned  and  financed  by  the  central\nGovernment.  While  current  Government  policies,  decrees,  and  resolutions  reflect  significant\ncommitment  to  implementing  institutional  and  financial  reforms  in  the  urban  infrastructure\nsector,  top-down  approaches  are  still  embedded  at  all  administrative  levels  of  government.  In\nparticular,  participation  of  local  communities  is  rare.  However,  with  Presidential  Decree  2791\nand Resolution 493 (footnote 3), delivery and maintenance of urban infrastructure services has\nbeen devolved to the oblasts and cities. The Project addresses decentralization and governance\nissues,  particularly  to  strengthen  the  institutional  and  financial  capacity  of  oblast  and  city\ngovernments  to  carry  out  the  decentralized  functions  of  providing  and  maintaining  local  water\nsupply services. As a result of ADB policy dialogue with the central and local governments, the\nProject will be implemented by the city governments and managed by the central Government in\nsupport  of  the  Government\u2019s  decentralization  policy.  The  Project  and  the  associated  TA  will\nprovide capacity building, particularly at the local level. The Government recognizes that for the\nsystem  to  be  sustainable,  ownership  and  responsibility  must  be  passed  to  the  users.  The\nProject is structured to increase local responsibility for water supply services by decentralizing\nimplementation  and  O&M,  and  actively  involving  both  government  and  community-based\nstakeholders.\n\n2. \n\nRaising  the  Standards  of  Urban  Water  Supply  Service  Delivery  and\nMaintenance\n\n30.\nInfrastructure  facilities  built  during  the  Soviet  period  were  capital  and  energy  intensive,\nand inefficient and expensive to operate and maintain. While the normative standards set for all\nurban  water  utility  services  were  high,  capacity  is  increasingly  lagging  behind  expanding\ndemand  and  there  are  no  incentives  to  conserve  water.  Urgent  improvements  are  required  to\n\n\f10\n\nthe  water  distribution  systems  across  the  country,  including  strengthening  of  pipe  networks,\nsupply  zoning  with  flow  and  pressure  controls,  active  leakage  reduction  practices,  and\nrehabilitation  and  reequipping  of  pumping  stations.  This  will  contribute  to  meeting  service\nstandards  and  improving  the  delivery  of  water  in  urban  centers  to  meet  basic  human\ndevelopment needs. In parallel with these interventions, awareness for conservation of water as\na  valuable  resource  will  be  increased.  This  will  be  achieved  through  education  and  public\nawareness  campaigns  in  conjunction  with  improved  customer  services.  Tariff  reforms  and\nintroduction  of  metering  of  both  bulk  water  supply  and  local  consumption  will  help  raise\nawareness and provide incentives for water conservation. The Government views water supply\nsector reform as a high priority. Through policy dialogue, the Government supports rehabilitation\nof the existing water supply facilities in the three oblast capital cities with the most urgent needs\nfor urban infrastructure repair and rehabilitation. Delivery of water services when compared with\ngovernment standards and of all those surveyed is the poorest in these three cities. Part of the\npopulation  do  not  receive  water  every  day  and  where  water  is  available  daily,  the  supply  is\nrationed. Water needs to be stored when it is available, and bottled water is used for those who\ncan  afford  it.  The  emphasis  will  be  on  rehabilitating  and  upgrading  existing  facilities  by  using\ncost-efficient  technology  and  approaches.  Community  participation  in  capital  repairs  and\nmaintenance  of  major  common  elements  in  apartment  buildings  are  also  important  to  ensure\nthat  improved  water  services  are  available  to  individual  households.  Fostering  partnerships\nbetween  the  community,  the  utility  agencies,  and  local  governments  will  result  in  more\nresponsive infrastructure service delivery and maintenance. The Project is therefore structured\nto  build  ownership  and  responsibility  at  the  local  level  and  is  aimed  at  improving  customer\nservice to consumers.\n\n3. \n\nFinancial Performance of the Utility Agencies\n\n31.\nThe  Government  is  in  the  process  of  reforming  utility  agencies  from  budget-run\norganizations to self-financing agencies, with the ability to raise and manage their own finance.\nVodokanals are self-financing organizations and do not receive operational subsidies from the\nGovernment.  Expenditure requirements are increasing due to inflation and an increasing need\nfor O&M expenditure on aging assets. Capital investment is urgently needed to enable systems\nto  function  correctly.  Vodokanal  income  is  hampered  by  poor  tariff  collection,  and  despite\nincreases in tariffs, all vodokanals are suffering from severe financial constraints because actual\nincome  does  not  cover  inflation  and  increasing  O&M  expenditures.  As  assets  deteriorate,\nservice standards decline, customers become less willing to pay, and the ability to collect tariffs\nworsens. As a result, maintenance and asset replacement is inadequate. This compounds the\ndownward  spiral  and  negates  financial  self-sustainability.  Furthermore,  utility  agencies  are\nunable to properly manage their finances using internationally accepted accounting standards.\n\n32.\nThrough  policy  dialogue,  the  Government  agreed  to  improve  service  delivery  by  these\nagencies;  restructure  tariffs  to  introduce  charging  by  volume  for  residential,  as  well  as\ncommercial  and  industrial  customers;  help  those  on  lower  incomes;  improve  education  and\nawareness;  provide  a  transparent  billing  and  collection  system;  and  improve  the  financial\nmanagement system. All these factors will improve collection of tariffs. In addition, tariffs will be\nincreased. In line with Government policies to decentralize and reform the provision and delivery\nof basic urban services, the Project will assist in improving governance including operation and\nfinancial management of water utility agencies to ensure that their transformation is sustainable.\n\n\f4. \n\nCost Recovery\n\n11\n\n33.\nUnder the reform policy, the Government seeks to establish self-financing principles for\nthe provision of urban infrastructure services.  This policy will be implemented over a number of\nyears.  Water supply services in the project cities are currently targeted to be independent self-\nfinancing  entities  with  tariffs  set  to  fully  recover  costs  from  user  charges.  The  Government\nconsiders  that  the  pricing  of  basic  infrastructure  services  should  fulfil  four  main  objectives:  (i)\ncost recovery to ensure financial viability and sustainability; (ii) affordability, particularly for low-\nincome  residential  customers;  (iii)  demand  management  through  metered  charging;  and  (iv)\neconomic  efficiency.  In  light  of  these  objectives  and  after  careful  analysis,  the  Government\nagrees  that  (i)  full  cost  recovery  should  be  targeted  for  all  project  components;  (ii)  in  the  long\nterm, cross-subsidies should be minimized, but if affordability criteria cannot be met, then cross-\nsubsidization should be pursued; (iii) the use of stepped tariffs for water, with lower rates for low\nvolume use, is a useful approach in assisting those on lower incomes; (iv) where affordability is\nlow,  differential  pricing  can  assist  in  cost  recovery  and  improve  collection  rates;  and  (v)  tariffs\nshould  be  reviewed  annually  to  take  into  account  collection  rates,  expenditure,  and  future\ninvestment plans; tariffs should be adjusted accordingly.\n\n5. \n\nStakeholder Participation\n\nExperience  indicates  that  beneficiary  participation,  good  governance,  and  project\n34.\nsustainability are interrelated factors that contribute to project success, and need to be factored\ninto project design and implementation arrangements. In this regard, the prevailing situation in\nthe  water  supply  sector  in  Uzbekistan  warrants  particular  attention  to  attune  service  delivery\nwith  consumer  demand,  such  that  not  only  is  the  service  updated  technologically,  but  it  also\naddresses site-specific needs and constraints. Consumer participation in training and decision-\nmaking activities is thus featured in the Project. Through the participatory process, consumers\nwill  be  educated  on  the  need  to  conserve  and  price  water  as  an  economic  resource.  This\napproach  is  fully  supported  by  the  Government  and  is  evidenced  by  its  agreement  to  support\nformation  of  consumer  committees  to  participate  in  setting  standards  for  service  delivery,\nmonitoring, and tariff setting.\n\n6. \n\nPoverty Focus\n\n35. While  poverty  reduction  is  not  an  explicit  government  policy,  the  Government  has\nemployed descriptive statistics and multivariate analysis to profile the characteristics associated\nwith  low-income  families  and  to  link  this  with  an  evaluation  of  current  policies  on  allocating\nsocial  protection  benefits.  Inflation  has  meant  that  the  total  social  protection  expenditure  and\nalso its percentage share of GDP is decreasing. In 1998 the social protection budget amounted\nto 3.5 percent of GDP and was reduced to 2.3 percent of the GDP in 2000.17 The Government\u2019s\nresponse is to adopt a gradual approach to reform to protect the needy and vulnerable from the\nworst  traumas  of  a  society  in  transition.  The  Project  concept  represents  a  pioneering  effort  to\ncontinue  support  for  basic  infrastructure  services,  and  to  use  a  screening  process  to  direct\nassistance  to  the  underserved  and  poorer  urban  areas.  A  three-stage  screening  methodology\nwas  adopted.  In  stage  one  representative  cities  to  be  reviewed  and  assessed  were  identified.\nStage  two  involved  the  collection  and  review  of  infrastructure  performance  data,  ranking  of\ndeficiencies  and  needs,  and  the  application  of  social  need  criteria,  such  as  provision  of  basic\nwater  supply  to  the  poor,  to  generate  a  long  list  of  priority  projects.  Stage  three  assessed  the\n\n17 Ministry of Macroeconomics and Statistics. Government of Uzbekistan. 2001. The Performance of the Expenditure\n\n                  \n\nSide of the State Budget. Tashkent.\n\n\f12\n\nranked projects against four criteria: compliance with government policies and strategies, social\ndevelopment  benefits,  economic  benefits,  and  environmental  protection.  The  cities  that\ndisplayed  the  greatest  need  were  Djizzak,  Gulistan,  and  Karshi.  All  three  cities  represent  the\npredicament of urban centers: due to budgetary constraints, they are unable to meet a growing\ndemand for provision and repair of basic utilities.\n\n36.\nThe  social  analysis  prepared  in  the  course  of  designing  the  Project  confirms  that  the\nthree  cities  contain  a  significant  representation  of  the  urban  poor.  Of  the  total  population  of\n484,000,  45  percent  are  poor.  Other  salient  socioeconomic  features  of  the  population  confirm\nthe significance of the Project in meeting the basic need of the urban population and the poor\namong  them.  Most  households  are  in  the  lower  to  poor  income  category.  The  households\ncomprise extended families living in single-story houses called hovles; smaller nuclear families\nhoused in old apartments; and people living in houses with shop fronts, which they operate or\nrent to tenants operating small food or retail goods stalls. For this last category, uninterrupted\nwater  supply  is  essential  for  their  business.  Poorer  households  living  in  apartments  are  most\nlikely to have leaking pipes inside their units and consequent water disruption. Most families try\nto cope with water disruptions by fetching and storing water from alternative sources if these are\nwithin walking distance, others have to purchase bottled water. Such alternatives are not only a\ndrain on household budgets but often unsanitary. To meet their household consumption needs,\nwomen  bear  the  brunt  of  such  inadequacies.  Such  findings  have  also  been  used  to  include\npoverty friendly features in the project design (paras. 38, 69, and 78).\n\n7. \n\nCapacity Building\n\nSustainable  delivery  of  urban  infrastructure  services  that  meets  the  need  of  the\n37.\npopulation depends critically on the management capacity of local utilities responsible for these\nservices.  This  is  particularly  so  if  management  and  service  delivery  are  to  be  decentralized.\nVodokanals in the project cities will be encouraged to adopt market-based principles for service\ndelivery,  design  and  costing  standards,  financial  management,  tariff  setting,  and  collection  of\ncharges.  The  Government  and  the  service  organizations  concerned  recognize  that  to  achieve\nthis transition significant capacity building is needed in the areas of training and the acquisition\nof broader international experience particularly in finance and management. The policy dialogue\nin the context of the Project has focused on these issues. The Government supports the need\nfor  capacity  building  measures,  including  training  and  support  for  the  NGO  and  CBO\nimplementation  role  at  the  community  level.  This  is  needed  for  sustainable  delivery  of  urban\ninfrastructure  services.  The  Project  is  structured  to  build  ownership  and  responsibility  at  the\nlocal  and  community  levels  with  effective  partnerships  between  the  communities,  the  local\ngovernment, and water utility agencies.\n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\n38.\nSince independence in 1991, budgetary support for urban infrastructure has slowed and\nwater supply infrastructure assets deteriorated. As a result, the urban population, including the\npoor, receives inferior and intermittent water utility services. Since urban water supply plays a\nvital  role  in  determining  the  living  standards  and  pattern  of  human  development,  the\ndeterioration of the water supply system must be stopped and strategies introduced to ensure\nthat  acceptable  standards  are  attained  at  costs  that  will  not  adversely  affect  the  population,\nparticularly the poor. As part of the reform process, the Government is decentralizing authority\nand  responsibility  for  urban  infrastructure  and  devolving  its  assets  to  local  authorities.\n\n\f13\n\nSimultaneously, the Government recognizes the need to set tariffs for utilities and services at a\nlevel  that  will  ensure  the  services  can  be  sustained.  However,  increased  charges  and  tariffs,\nwhile necessary for sustainability, might not be affordable to the financially disadvantaged, and\nproject  interventions  must  strike  a  balance  between  resource  pricing  and  poverty  reduction\nconsiderations.  To  this  end,  mechanisms  necessary  to  protect  vulnerable  sections  of  the\ncommunity against unaffordable cost increases are included in the project design.\n\n39.\nBased on an assessment of performance data of each urban infrastructure subsector in\n22  cities  throughout  the  country,  potable  water  supply  in  Djizzak,  Gulistan,  and  Karshi  were\nidentified as having the most urgent need for rehabilitation and upgrading. Water supply in the\nthree  cities  is  characterized  by  limited  availability  of  raw  water  resources  and  lack  of\nconservation awareness and responsibility. Unaccounted for water is around 40 percent in the\nthree  cities.  Underfunding  of  assets  for  a  significant  period  has  led  to  antiquated  equipment,\ninefficiency,  and  equipment  failures.  Currently  only  about  60  percent  of  the  population  in  the\nthree  project  cities  receive  some  water  every  day.  If  the  water  systems  are  not  upgraded,\nDjizzak and Karshi will likely fail to supply the basic water requirement by 2007 and the system\nwill fail totally by 2015. The Gulistan system is in worse condition and will fail totally within five\nyears if the system is not upgraded or rehabilitated. Sewerage was not included in the Project\nas the existing wastewater treatment facilities in the three project cities have sufficient capacity\nto treat the additional water consumption, which is not expected to increase substantially, as a\nresult of improving the water system (para. 16).\n\n40.\nManagement  problems  include  inability  of  the  water  utility  agencies  to  manage  the\nassets in a modern and effective manner; this is further hindered by limited financial resources,\nrestricted  technological  expertise,  and  absence  of  economic  incentives.  The  Project  seeks  to\naddress  each  of  these  problems  by  creating  a  modern  and  efficient  operation  from  which  the\nwhole  population  can  expect  an  acceptable  standard  of  service  at  an  affordable  cost.  The\nProject will support the Government\u2019s policy to decentralize urban infrastructure services to local\ngovernments  and  to  transform  the  utility  agencies  into  financially  independent  entities.  To\nensure  long-term  sustainability  of  the  sector,  the  Project  has  adopted  a  holistic  approach  to\nimprove  the  institutional,  technical,  and  financial  capacity  of  the  concerned  agencies.  The\nProject seeks to make major improvements in asset performance, and to establish capacity for\nserving  the  population  over  the  planning  period  to  2020.  The  Project  will  strengthen  and\nupgrade the quality and availability of water supply to the population in the three project cities\nand  will  improve  the  quality  of  life  of  both  the  poor  and  nonpoor.  The  Project  is  in  line  with\nGovernment\u2019s  decentralization  of  communal  services  and  institutional  reform  policies,  and\nADB\u2019s human development and poverty reduction objectives.\n\nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope\n\nThe main objective of the Project is to improve the quality of life and health conditions in\n41.\nthe  oblast  capital  cities  of  Djizzak,  Gulistan,  and  Karshi,  where  about  45  percent  of  the\npopulation  are  poor,18  by  improving  basic  water  supply  services.  The  Project  will  (i)  assist  the\ncentral  and  local  governments  and  the  utility  agencies  with  upgrading  the  physical  delivery\nsystems for potable water supply; (ii) improve the institutional, technical, and financial capability\nof  local  governments  and  vodokanals  for  planning,  implementation,  and  O&M  of  the  facilities;\nand (iii) promote greater community participation in managing urban water supply services.\n\n18 The proportion of poor households in Djizzak is 37 percent; Gulistan, 44 percent; and Karshi, 51 percent.\n\n                  \n\n\f14\n\nThe  Project  will  also  upgrade  service  levels  and  delivery  efficiency,  and  achieve  better\n42.\ncost  recovery  by  providing  capacity  building  and  project  management  support.  The  aim  is  to\nassist  the  Government  in  implementing  institutional  reform  for  urban  water  supply  services  by\nimproving  governance  of  the  concerned  agencies,  and  providing  and  upgrading  reliable  and\nfinancially sustainable urban water supply services that will promote economic development and\nreduce  urban  poverty.  The  objectives  and  the  overall  scope  of  the  Project  are  in  accordance\nwith  the  objectives  of  the  ADB  water  sector  policy,19  which  are  to  improve  and  expand  the\ndelivery of services, foster the conservation of water, increase system efficiencies, and improve\ngovernance  through  decentralization  and  capacity  building  of  all  stakeholders.  The  Project\nconsists of two components: water supply and capacity building.\n\n1. \n\nWater Supply\n\n43.\nThis component will comprise investments in the cities of Djizzak, Gulistan, and Karshi\nto  upgrade  and  rehabilitate  the  water  supply  system  and  distribution  network.  The  component\nwill  (i)  strengthen  resource  capacity  and  security  of  available  water  supplies  by  rehabilitating\n135 existing boreholes and constructing 1 new borehole (in Djizzak), (ii) improve transmission\nsecurity by expanding reservoir storage capacity by 23,000 cubic meters (m3), (iii) renew a total\nof  about  142  kilometers  of  fragile  supply  and  distribution  pipelines,  (iv)  introduce  new  water\ndistribution mains (167 kilometers) to improve efficiency and security of supply and increase the\ncoverage of distribution networks, (v) renew pumping equipment and controls (20 second-stage\npumps  in  water  distribution  centers  and  44  pumps  in  local  booster  pumping  stations),  (vi)\nprovide  metering  of  bulk  supplies  at  source  and  at  strategic  sources  of  supply,  (vii)  install\nconsumer  metering  to  private  housing  (about  56,000  water  meters)  and  to  apartment  blocks\n(about 1,200 water meters)20 with associated basement plumbing, and (viii) reduce leakage by\nrepairing pipework and initiating an active leakage control program. By these means resources\nand availability will be secured, demand for supply will be managed, losses will be minimized,\nsupply efficiency raised, and unit costs lowered. The standard of service will be improved and\nthe whole operation will become more financially sustainable. Capital investments will be for civil\nworks,  equipment,  and  materials.  Appendix  4  provides  a  summary  of  the  water  supply\ncomponent.\n\n2. \n\nCapacity Building\n\n44.\nThis  component  includes  a  training  program,  social  development  measures,  and\nconsulting services for project management support. The training program involves support for\nthe recent transition of the previous Ministry of Communal Services into UCSA, and training of\nstaff  at  the  local  governments,  mahallas,  and  vodokanals  to  strengthen  their  capacity  to\nefficiently  implement,  operate,  and  maintain  the  systems.  Training  and  other  capacity  building\nwill  also  include  specific  initiatives  to  (i)  introduce  a  new  computerized  accounting  system  for\nfinancial  management  of  the  total  operation;  (ii)  provide  training  on  operational  management,\nparticularly aimed at asset management and improving customer services; (iii) initiate a public\nawareness  campaign  to  encourage  willingness-to-pay;  and  (iv)  build  capacity  for  developing\nsmall  plumbing  businesses.  The  focus  is  to  improve  the  skills  of  project  implementation\n\n                  \n\n19 ADB. 2000. Water for All: The Water Policy of the Asian Development Bank. Manila.\n20 Installation  of  water  meters  for  individual  units  in  apartment  buildings  was  considered  during  project  design.\nHowever, this would require reconstruction of the entire piping system in all apartment buildings. The cost will be\ntoo  high  for  the  Project  to  be  financially  viable.  Water  meters  will  be  installed  at  the  basement  of  apartment\nbuildings to start charging by volume and to initiate the practice of water conservation. Currently, poor households\nin apartment buildings are subsidized on their utility bills and the subsidy arrangement is undertaken by the local\nmahalla committees.\n\n\f15\n\npersonnel to carry out the Project effectively. An advisory TA, formulated in conjunction with the\nProject,  will  help  strengthen  sector  institutions  and  establish  a  training  center  for  long-term\ntraining of staff involved in the sector as well as concerned NGOs and CBOs.\n\nSocial development measures to improve the distribution of benefits will be provided in\n45.\nthe  form  of  education  and  awareness  initiatives  to  support  the  overall  goals  and  objectives  of\nthe  infrastructure  provision.  These  will  include  (i)  a  public  health  awareness  campaign  run  by\nwomen  to  enable  the  full  benefits  of  improved  drinking  water  supply  to  be  realized;  (ii)  a\ncommunity  participation  and  consumer  rights  awareness  program  to  improve  the  capacity  of\nconsumers  to  participate  in  project  implementation,  monitoring,  and  management;  and  (iii)  a\nwater conservation awareness program. These will be implemented with the support of NGOs\nand CBOs, and will include the establishment of consumer committees and their participation in\nproject implementation.\n\n46.\nProject  management  consulting  services  will  help  implement  the  Project  by  providing\nsupport  to  the  project  management  unit  (PMU)  and  project  implementing  units  (PIUs).  The\nconsulting  services  will  also  involve  socioeconomic  surveys,  community  consultations,  and\nparticipation  in  project  implementation  with  the  support  of  NGOs  and  CBOs.  The  services  will\ncover  project  management  and  monitoring,  implementation  of  the  training  program,  support  to\nsocial development measures, supervision of implementation, and construction of the physical\ncomponents of the Project.\n\nC. \n\nTechnical Justification\n\nEach  of  the  three  project  cities  has  a  centralized  water  supply  system  that  is  suffering\n47.\nfrom production deficiencies and a fragile distribution network, both unable to sustain necessary\ndelivery  pressures  and  lagging  behind  expansion  of  the  city  and  growth  of  its  population.  The\nresults are insufficient capacity, inefficient operation, and poor water quality. The Project will use\nappropriate technology to improve borehole resources and system storage; develop reticulated\nsystems and strengthen distribution networks; renew pumping equipment and supply mains to\nincrease delivery pressure; provide disinfection facilities to protect against waterborne diseases;\nand reduce leakage from the distribution network by zoning, metering, and repair. Unaccounted\nfor water will be targeted for reduction from the present level (city vodokanals report it to be in\nexcess of 40 percent), to approximately 30 percent by project completion. An improved system\nand  more  secure  water  supply  to  areas  both  currently  served  and  without  an  existing  piped\nsupply  will  ensure  improvements  to  the  health  and  general  welfare  of  the  population.  By\nreducing water supply  losses  and  extravagant use, as water is charged per capita and not by\nvolume consumed, the existing inefficiencies and resulting costs can be minimized. Security of\nsupply  and  improved  standard  of  service  will  increase  the  willingness  to  pay  for  service  and\nimprove cost recovery. Total demand for water may increase in the future due to (i) expanded\ncoverage of the supply network from currently over 90 percent to 100 percent of the population\nby  2007,  (ii)  delivery  of  24-hour  water  supply,  (iii)  natural  population  growth,  and  (iv)\nimprovements in the standard of living. Total demand for the three cities is projected to increase\nfrom the current 46,000 m3/day to 80,000 m3/day in 2020 for Djizzak, 45,000 m3/day to 60,000\nm3/day for Gulistan, and 110,000 m3/day to 130,000 m3/day in Karshi. However, required water\nproduction per capita is expected to drop over time as a result of increased appreciation of the\nvalue  of  water  developed  by  public  awareness  campaigns,  improved  efficiencies  within  the\ndelivery network, development of techniques of accounting for water, and freedom of choice on\nconsumption provided by metering and tariff policies that promote water conservation.\n\n\fD. \n\nCost Estimates\n\n16\n\n48.\nThe total project cost is estimated at $65.5 million (at June 2001 prices), of which $32.9\nmillion or 50 percent is the foreign exchange cost and $32.6 million equivalent or 50 percent the\nlocal currency cost.

The  ADB  loan  would  finance  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  of\n$32.9 million and $3.1 million equivalent of the local currency cost. The local cost financing is\nconsidered justified because of the fiscal constraints faced by the local governments during the\ncountry\u2019s  transition  to  a  market  economy.  The  ADB  loan  represents  55  percent  of  the  total\ncost.22 The Borrower will be the Republic of Uzbekistan. The proposed loan will have a term of\n25 years, including a grace period of 5 years, with interest determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s\npool-based variable lending rate system for US dollar loans. The loan will carry a commitment\ncharge of 0.75 percent per annum and a front-end fee of 1 percent. The Borrower will enter into\nsubsidiary  loan  agreement  with  UCSA,  the  Executing  Agency,  under  the  ADB  loan  terms  with\n\n                  \n\n21 During loan negotiations, the availability of the new LIBOR-based loan product was discussed with the Government\nof Uzbekistan. The Government indicated that it is still reviewing the implications of the LIBOR-based loan product\nand will borrow under the pool-based loan facility for the proposed Project.\n\n22 The ADB cost-sharing limit under the Graduation Policy for Uzbekistan for 2001 is 45 percent. However, 55 percent\ncounterpart funding represents an extraordinarily high financial burden for the local governments whose revenues\nhave  suffered  significant  erosion  due  to  the  impact  of  transition  and  adverse  weather  conditions  in  the  last  two\nyears.  Moreover,  investment  needs  for  building  urban  infrastructure  in  Uzbekistan  are  enormous.  Local\ngovernments  are  faced  with  binding  budget  constraints  on  account  of  rising  levels  of  public  expenditures  to\nmaintain  acceptable  levels  of  delivery  of  public  services.  Increasing  ADB\u2019s  cost-sharing  from  45  to  55  percent  is\nrequired  to  meet  the  cost  of  the  Project,  which  is  essential  to  improve  living  conditions,  reduce  poverty,  and\npromote economic development in the three cities.

UCSA\u2019s  General\nDirectorate  on  Interregional  Water  Trunk  Mains  is  now  fully  responsible  for  the  national\ninterregional trunk water mains. Its implementation capabilities will be strengthened through the\nProject\u2019s  capacity  building  activities.  ADB  and  UCSA  will  enter  into  a  project  agreement.  The\nPIUs and vodokanals in the three project cities will undertake detailed implementation activities.\n\nG. \n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1. \n\nExecution and Coordination\n\n52.\nPolicy  coordination  and  guidance  for  the  Project  will  be  assumed  by  an  interministerial\nproject steering committee (PSC), headed by the UCSA director general. Members of the PSC\ninclude  representatives  from  the  Department  of  Foreign  Economic  Relations  and  Investment,\nMinistry  of  Macroeconomics  and  Statistics,  Ministry  of  Finance,  and  the  local  governments  of\nthe  three  project  cities.  The  PSC  has  already  been  established  under  the  project  preparatory\nTA,  by  order  of  the  Prime  Minister,  to  provide  direction  on  project  preparation.  During  project\nimplementation, the PSC will be responsible for (i) setting policy guidelines for improving project\nimplementation, (ii) coordinating with other ministries and agencies, (iii) reviewing and approving\n\n\f18\n\nannual  implementation  plans,  (iv)  monitoring  the  progress  of  project  implementation,  and  (v)\nacting  as  a  tender  committee  to  endorse  contract  awards.  The  PSC  will  meet  at  least  once\nevery  six  months,  or  more  frequently  as  required.  The  project  implementation  structure  is  in\nAppendix 6.\n\n53.\nA PMU under UCSA and three PIUs under each of the project city governments will be\nestablished prior to loan negotiations. The PMU will include about six full-time counterpart staff\nand consultants led by a project management specialist to manage and coordinate the work of\nthe  three  PIUs  for  Djizzak,  Gulistan,  and  Karshi.  The  PMU  will  also  be  responsible  for  overall\ncoordination  of  procurement  activities  that  need  to  be  conducted  in  full  compliance  with  ADB\nrequirements, operation of central procurement contracts, and awarding of consulting contracts.\nThe PIUs will be responsible for coordinating detailed implementation activities and will report to\nthe  PMU.  Responsibilities  of  the  PIUs  include  financial  management  of  project  accounts,  all\nlocal  procurement  including  civil  works  contracts,  and  coordination  of  project  design  and\nsupervision.  Each  of  the  PIUs  will  include  a  full-time  manager  and  about  five  full-time\ncounterpart  staff  and  consultants.  The  three  city  vodokanals,  with  a  total  of  about  700  staff\nincluding about 100 engineers (Appendix 2), and the UCSA General Directorate on Interregional\nWater Trunk Mains will be responsible for day-to-day project implementation activities and will\nreport, through the PIU, to the PMU and UCSA. They will be responsible for activities such as\nconstruction supervision, O&M of assets, and collection of tariffs. The roles and responsibilities\nof the PMU, PIUs, and implementing agencies are summarized in Appendix 6.\n\n2. \n\nBudgetary Support and Channeling of Funds\n\nThe PMU will undertake central procurement, including the capacity building component\n54.\nand the packages for materials and equipment. The PIU will undertake procurement of all other\ngoods  and  services  and  transfer  the  physical  assets  to  the  vodokanals.  Counterpart  funds\nincluding  contributions  from  the  national  and  local  governments  will  be  channeled  to  the  PIUs\ntaxes  and  duties,  and  small\nthrough  regular  budgetary  allocations,  exemptions \ncontributions in kind. The ADB loan funds will be disbursed either through reimbursement to the\nPMU  and  PIUs  or  through  direct  payment  to  the  contractors,  suppliers,  and  consultants.  Cost\nrecovery will be from the consumers, through the vodokanals by the collection of user charges.\nThe flow of funds is shown in Appendix 7.\n\nfrom \n\n55.\nAt  the  start  of  the  Project,  the  PMU  will  help  the  three  project  city  administrations\nformulate the draft project expenditures for all activities, with estimates for each year of project\nimplementation.  These  budgets  will  be  reviewed  and  updated  every  six  months  and  approved\nby  the  PMU  before  implementation.  Expenditures  will  be  recorded  at  source  by  the\nimplementing  agencies,  PIUs,  and  PMU.  The  PMU  will  approve  and  supervise  all  drawdown\narrangements. The PMU will be responsible for compiling project expenditures based on its own\nexpenditures  and  the  reports  of  expenditures  submitted  by  the  PIUs.  It  will  report  project\nexpenditures to UCSA and the PSC, with copies to ADB, on a monthly basis, with quarterly and\nannual summaries.\n\n3. \n\nAnticorruption\n\n56.\nDuring project processing, ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to central and local\ngovernment  officials.  Attention  was  drawn  to  the  sections  on  fraud  and  corruption  in  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement,  particularly  the  need  for  bidders,  suppliers,  and  contractors  to\nobserve  the  highest  standards  of  ethics  for  the  procurement  and  execution  of  ADB-financed\ncontracts,  and  the  sanctions  if  fraud  and  corruption  are  discovered.  The  anticorruption\n\n\f19\n\nprovisions  in  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  were  discussed.  The  project\nmanagement  consulting  services  include  assistance  that  will  strengthen  the  implementation\narrangements,  including  internal  auditing  procedures.  The  international  project  management\nconsultants  will  assist  in  strengthening  the  procedures  for  the  selection  and  engagement  of\ndomestic  consultants,  increase  transparency,  and  provide  for  equal  opportunity  competition.\nThe  consultants  will  help  to  (i)  strengthen  the  financial  management  system  of  the  project\nvodokanals,  (ii)  conduct  training  to  promote  full  and  consistent  adherence  to  international\naccounting  standards,  and  (iii)  drafting  procurement  and  bidding  documents  to  strengthen  the\nability  to  detect  fraud  and  corruption.  The  Government  is  increasingly  concerned  with\ngovernance  issues  and  has  committed  to  (i)  create  a  strong  mechanism  of  checks  and\nbalances,  (ii)  strengthen  nongovernment  and  public  associations,  (iii)  reinforce  the  legal  basis\nfor reforms, (iv) support the gradual transfer of government powers of state bodies to citizens\u2019\nbodies for self-government and other nongovernment agencies, (v) encourage decentralization,\nand (vi) ensure the independence of the judiciary.23\n\n4. \n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n57.\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  five  years.  Detailed  feasibility  and  detailed\nengineering  design  will  commence  early  in  2002  and  tendering  of  contracts  will  commence  in\nthe last quarter of 2002. Construction of the water supply and distribution facilities will begin in\nmid-2003 and be completed by mid-2006. Installation of meters is targeted for completion by the\nend of 2005, and testing to be completed by 2006. All components will be implemented in the\nthree project cities simultaneously. The project implementation schedule is in Appendix 8.\n\n5. \n\nProcurement\n\n58.\nThe procurement of goods and services financed by the ADB loan will be undertaken in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for Procurement.  Civil  works  contracts  valued  over  $1.0\nmillion  and  equipment  contracts  above  $500,000  will  be  undertaken  through  international\ncompetitive  bidding  procedures.  Civil  works  contracts  valued  at  $1.0  million  or  less  will  be\ncarried  out  under  local  competitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB  and  in  accordance\nwith  Government  regulations.  Equipment  packages  valued  at  or  under  $500,000  will  be\nprocured  following  international  shopping  procedures.  Procurement  notice  for  contracts  to  be\nawarded  on  the  basis  of  international  competitive  bidding  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  within  90\ndays before the issuance of the prequalification invitation or invitation to bid for the Project. The\nproposed procurement packages and their estimated costs are provided in Appendix 9.\n\n6. \n\nConsulting Services\n\n59.\nThe  Project  will  require  consulting  services  in  the  fields  of  project  management,  water\nsupply  engineering,  health  and  public  awareness  education,  financial  and  accounting  advice,\nand  community  development.  Consulting  services  will  assist  in  (i)  preparing  detailed  feasibility\nand engineering design studies, including socioeconomic, technical, and environmental surveys;\n(ii)  applying  water  supply  system  design  standards;  (iii)  preparing  contract  packages  and\ndocuments;  (iv)  evaluating  project  activities;  (v)  supporting  the  institutional  development\nprogram,  including  training  for  unaccounted  for  water  loss  reduction;  (vi)  supporting  the\nmanagement  and  activities  of  the  PMU  and  PIUs;  (vii)  helping  staff  prepare  loan  withdrawal\napplications and supporting documents; and (viii) maintaining accurate and sufficient accounts\nfor  the  Project  and  the  vodokanals,  in  accordance  with  international  accounting  standards.  A\n\n23 Resolution No. 296 of the Cabinet of Ministers, sections 1.1-1.2, 10 June 1999.\n\n                  \n\n\f20\n\ntotal of 405 person-months (45 person-months international and 360 person-months domestic)\nof  consulting  services  are  required.  The  international  consultants  will  be  involved  in  project\nmanagement;  development  of  financial  management  practices  to  international  standards  with\ndomestic consultants and government staff; financial, technical, and institutional strengthening;\nand  community  development  activities  to  ensure  project  quality.  The  domestic  consultants  will\nbe responsible for long-term project implementation, reviewing technical studies, preparing and\ncommissioning  detailed  designs,  and  supervising  construction.  The  PMU  will  contract  with\nsuitable  NGOs  and  CBOs  to  implement  community  consultation  and  development.  UCSA  will\nengage  the  consultants  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  and\nother arrangements acceptable to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The terms\nof reference for the consultants are in Appendix 10.\n\nThe consultants will also be responsible for implementing the capacity building program,\n60.\nwhich  will  include  training  of  local  governments  and  vodokanals  on  O&M  and  management  of\nwater  supply  systems.  The  program  will  focus  on  (i)  gradual  expansion  of  the  organizational\nstructure,  including  identification  of  key  staff  to  be  hired;  (ii)  O&M  with  emphasis  on  demand\nincluding  reduction  of  wastage  and\nmanagement  and  asset  management  planning, \nunaccounted  for  water;  and  (iii)  development  of  capabilities,  including  planning,  engineering,\nfinancial,  accounting,  billing,  tariff  setting  and  collection,  and  operations.  Water  supply  system\noperators in the vodokanals will be trained during project implementation. About 1,100 staff in\nthe local governments and vodokanals will be trained under the capacity building program. The\ntraining  will  be  carried  out  in  conjunction  with  the  physical  implementation  of  the  Project.  In\naddition, training will also be provided by local NGOs and CBOs on strengthening the capacity\nof communities to be involved in community development and consumer empowerment through\nconsumer  committees.  The  PMU  and  PIUs  will  continue  development  of  the  training  program\nand will implement the training program.\n\n61.\nThe PMU and PIUs, in coordination with the health department in each project city and\nwith  assistance  from  the  consultants,  will  work  with  NGOs  to  develop  hygiene  and  health\nawareness programs (including water quality testing) for the health department and CBOs, such\nas mahallas. The programs will include (i) communication campaigns to educate the population\non the causes, effects, and prevention of waterborne and related diseases; (ii) specification and\nstandard  setting  for  health  awareness  campaigns  in  areas  such  as  maintenance  of  sanitation\nfacilities, food storage and preparation, and personal hygiene in houses and small businesses;\nand  (iii)  communication  and  training  programs  for  local  NGO  staff  and  volunteers,  including\nwomen\u2019s and youth groups to implement the programs with the community in the project cities.\nNGOs  will  also  be  involved  in  providing  training  to  individuals  to  undertake  plumbing  repair\nworks in houses and apartment units.\n\n7. \n\nDisbursements\n\n62.\nThe  PMU  and  PIUs  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  disbursement  projections,\nrequesting  budgetary  allocations  for  the  counterpart  funds,  collecting  supporting  documents,\npreparing withdrawal applications, and sending them to ADB in accordance with the ADB Loan\nDisbursement Handbook. To facilitate implementation of the Project, an imprest account may be\nestablished. Because this is UCSA\u2019s first experience with implementing an externally financed\ninvestment  project,  its  financial  and  accounting  management  capacity  is  yet  to  be  tested.  The\nimprest  account  will  be  established  only  after  the  fielding  of  the  project-financed  financial\nmanagement advise and the establishment of adequate financial and accounting controls. The\ninitial ceiling of the imprest account will be $100,000. The imprest account will be established,\nmanaged, replenished, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook\n\n\f21\n\nand  with  detailed  arrangements  agreed  to  by  the  Government  and  ADB.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of\nexpenditures procedure will be used to liquidate advances from the imprest account.\n\n8. \n\nAccounts, Audits, and Reports\n\n63.\nThe  Government  will  ensure  records  and  accounts  adequate  to  identify  the  goods  and\nservices  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  maintained.  The  PIUs  will  maintain  separate\nproject  accounts,  in  coordination  with  the  PMU,  which  will  prepare  the  project  accounts  and\nrelated  financial  statements,  including  imprest  account  and  records  of  the  statement  of\nexpenditures. Project accounts and financial statements of the three project vodokanals will be\naudited  annually  in  accordance  with  sound  auditing  standards  by  independent  auditors\nacceptable  to  ADB.  Certified  copies  of  such  audited  accounts  and  financial  statements  will  be\nsubmitted  to  ADB  within  nine  months  after  the  close  of  each  fiscal  year.  All  such  reports  and\nstatements  will  be  submitted  in  English.  The  Government  has  agreed  to  finance  the  costs\nrelated  to  the  annual  auditing  from  the  loan  proceeds.  UCSA  and  the  implementing  agencies\nwere informed of ADB\u2019s new policy on submission of audited financial statements and the strict\npenalties  for  noncompliance.  The  PMU  and  ADB  may  review  and  audit  these  records  on  a\nrandom basis.\n\n64.\nThe  PIUs,  in  coordination  with  the  PMU,  will  prepare  quarterly  reports  on  the\nimplementation  of  project-funded  activities.  The  reports  will  be  in  a  format  acceptable  to  ADB\nand  will  indicate,  among  other  things,  progress  made  against  established  targets,  problems\nencountered  during  the  quarter,  steps  taken  and  steps  proposed  to  resolve  the  problems,\ncompliance with loan covenants, and project activities to be undertaken during the next quarter.\nA  project  completion  report  will  be  prepared  within  three  months  of  project  completion.  All\nreports will be submitted in English.\n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation\n\na. \n\nAnnual Operation Plans and Financial Review\n\n65.\nTo facilitate project implementation and decentralization of communal services, both the\ncentral Government and the local governments of Djizzak, Gulistan, and Karshi will prepare by\n31  December  of  each  year  an  operation  plan  for  the  next  fiscal  year.  The  plan  will  include  (i)\nproposed  budgetary  allocations  for  communal  services,  and  specifically,  the  allocation  of\nsufficient  counterpart  funds  from  local  and  central  governments  and  other  sources  for  timely\nproject  implementation;  (ii)  status  of  policy  actions;  and  (iii)  financing  plan  for  the  project\nactivities for the  succeeding  year.  The plan will confirm that the Government has allocated an\nadequate budget for financing project implementation and recurrent costs.\n\nb. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring System\n\n66.\nThe  PIUs  will  implement  a  project  performance  monitoring  system  (PPMS)  for  each\nproject  component  to  evaluate  the  delivery  of  the  planned  facilities  and  the  project  benefits\naccrued. The PMU, with the assistance of the consultants, will develop comprehensive PPMS\nprocedures  and  plans  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  handbook  within  six  months  after  loan\neffectiveness.  The  PIUs  will  carry  out  PPMS  activities,  including  the  establishment  of\nbenchmarks,  collection  of  information,  monitoring  of  benefits,  and  evaluation  of  social  impact.\nData collection will be carried out prior to the start of the physical implementation of the Project\nand  in  conjunction  with  socioeconomic  surveys  and  focus  group  discussions.  It  will  then\n\n\f22\n\ncontinue  on  a  regular  basis  during  project  implementation  until  three  months  after  project\ncompletion. The results will be incorporated into the project progress and completion reports.\n\nc. \n\nAnnual and Midterm Review\n\n67.\nADB  and  the  Government  will  jointly  undertake  annual  project  reviews  to  assess\nprogress, identify constraints, and agree on strategies for resolving such constraints. More than\none review per year is expected for the first two years. In addition, ADB and the Government will\ncarry  out  a  comprehensive  midterm  review  in  the  third  year  of  project  implementation  (2004).\nThe Government will ensure that the midterm review is informed of any policy or implementation\nchanges affecting the local governments and the urban infrastructure sector, and if necessary,\nrecommend  changes  in  design  and  implementation.  The  midterm  review  will  (i)  review  the\nscope,  design,  and  implementation  arrangements  of  the  Project;  (ii)  identify  changes  needed\nsince  the  time  of  project  appraisal;  (iii)  assess  implementation  performance  against  project\nindicators; (iv) review and establish compliance with loan covenants; and (v) identify problems\nand  constraints  and,  if  necessary,  recommend  changes  in  the  design  or  implementation\narrangements.\n\n10. \n\nAdvance Action\n\nADB  management  has  approved  advance  action  to  recruit  consulting  services  for\n68.\nimplementation  assistance  and  the  preparation  of  detailed  designs  and  contract  documents\nprior to loan effectiveness. The Government has been informed that approval of advance action\ndoes not commit ADB to finance the whole or any part of the Project.\n\n11. \n\nCommunity Participation\n\n69.\nA  participatory  approach  was  adopted  to  formulate  and  design  the  Project.  A\ncomprehensive  socioeconomic  survey  and  focus  group  discussions  with  low-income  people\nwere carried out in each of the three project cities to determine the real demands of the people.\nThe  survey  results  indicate  that  the  majority  of  respondents  wished  to  have  improved  basic\nwater  supply  services  and  expressed  their  willingness  to  pay  user  fees  for  better  services.\nNGOs and CBOs, including women\u2019s groups and focus groups in the three project cities, were\nalso consulted during project formulation and expressed a strong commitment to participate in\nproject design and implementation. The PIUs, with assistance from the project consultants, will\nset  up  consumer  committees  (one  per  city)  to  participate  in  project  implementation  and\nmonitoring. These committees will include representatives from all consumer groups, including\nthe  mahalla  aksakal  (elder)  committees,  housing  partnerships,  city  women\u2019s  committee,  city\noffices of the ministries of health and education, and NGOs involved in project implementation.\nA particular focus of the participatory program will be on meeting and prioritizing the needs of\nthe  poor.  Furthermore,  the  attached  TA  and  the  capacity  building  program  of  the  Project  will\nprovide  training  and  support  for  local  NGOs  and  CBOs  to  strengthen  the  capabilities  of  the\nconsumer committees to participate in managing and maintaining urban water supply services\nin the long term.\n\n70.\nThe  main  selection  criteria  for  NGO  participation  in  the  Project  will  be  (i)  a  well-\nestablished track record of activities and social networks within the project cities, (ii) experience\nin  public  health  and/or  small  business  development,  (iii)  experience  in  mounting  publicity\ncampaigns, (iv) evidence of involvement of women and people of all ethnic origins in the project\narea,  (v)  experience  in  keeping  accounts  and  making  progress  reports,  (vi)  willingness  to\n\n\f23\n\nreceive  specialist  training  from  national  or  international  NGOs,  and  (vii)  ability  to  commit  the\nneeded staff resources full-time for the required duration of the Project.\n\n12. \n\nPrivate Sector Participation\n\n71.\nInfrastructure  development  requires  supply  of  equipment,  materials,  and  contracting\nservices.  A  strong  support  industry  is  an  essential  element  for  good  utility  performance.  A\nprivate support industry for the urban infrastructure sector is evolving only slowly in Uzbekistan.\nMost services are delivered through state agencies, publicly owned self-financing organizations,\nor  recently  privatized  companies  that  provide  similar  services  as  were  offered  by  the  former\nstate-owned enterprises, institutes, and ministries. Greater private sector participation will result\nin competition that allows utilities and consumers to choose the best contract in terms of quality\nand  cost.  Through  the  Project,  the  Government  will  be  encouraging  the  development  of  (i)  a\ndiversified  private  consulting  capacity  by  contracting  research  and  design  institutes  that  are\nprivatized  or  operate  on  market  principles;  (ii)  a  responsive  and  efficient  domestic  industry  to\nsupply  quality  equipment  and  materials  by  procuring  from  privatized  state  equipment\nmanufacturers  and  material  suppliers;  (iii)  civil  works  contractors  that  are  capable  of  providing\nquality  services  by  contracting  the  privatized  state  civil  works  contractors;  (iv)  small-scale\nenterprises  that  can  offer  construction  and  O&M  services;  (v)  NGOs  that  can  help  the\ncommunities to maintain the infrastructure facilities; and (vi) local consulting businesses, survey\ncompanies,  and  individuals.  In  future  years  the  project  approach  is  expected  to  allow  the\nimplementing and operating agencies, the vodokanals, to restructure and contract out some of\ntheir services such as the collection of tariffs, repairs and maintenance, and potentially, contract\nmanagement  and  financial  services.  The  establishment  of  consumer  committees  is  also\nexpected to strengthen demand-led private sector participation.\n\n13. \n\nOperation and Maintenance\n\nTo ensure sustainable O&M, the project design incorporates systematic training of staff;\n72.\npreparation of manuals; and periodic monitoring of operations, including consumer satisfaction.\nThe vodokanals will be responsible for the O&M of the facilities and collection of user fees on a\nregular  monthly  basis.  The  community  participation  program  to  be  undertaken  during  project\nimplementation will facilitate beneficiary involvement, enable the determination of an appropriate\nand  affordable  service  level,  and  help  ensure  that  the  costs  of  investment  and  O&M  are  fully\nunderstood.  Furthermore,  a  customer  service  orientation  program  will  be  included  for  utility\nagencies  to  regularly  monitor  the  level  of  customer  satisfaction,  which  has  a  direct  impact  on\nwillingness to pay, tariff collection, and cost recovery.\n\n14. \n\nCost Recovery\n\nFull recovery from user charges is targeted for all three cities to ensure financial viability\n73.\nof the Project and sustainability of the vodokanals. Tariffs will be increased for all categories of\ncustomers,  and  after  the  installation  of  meters  for  residential  customers  under  the  Project,  all\ncustomers  will  be  charged  by  volume.  Once  the  Project  is  completed,  tariff  collection  will\nimprove due to better service delivery and customer orientation, restructuring of tariffs based on\nconsumption,  more  transparent  billing,  establishment  of  consumer  committees,  and  education\nand  awareness  campaign.  Tariffs  will  be  set  to  cover  O&M,  interest  on  the  ADB  loan,\ndepreciation, and a profit margin, and will take into consideration the tariff collection rate and the\nprevailing  commercial  exchange  rate.  At  these  tariff  levels,  the  vodokanals  would  be  fully\nsustainable, and be able to repay interest and principal of the ADB loan to UCSA and cover its\nown costs.\n\n\f24\n\nUnder  the  Government  reform  policy  to  transform  vodokanals  to  become  financially\n74.\nindependent, utility agencies must take on the foreign exchange risk. Proposed tariff calculation\ntakes  into  consideration  devaluation  of  the  sum  at  the  commercial  exchange  rate  of  $1  to\nSUM700  (provided  by the  Ministry  of Finance) in 2001 to $1 to SUM1,100 in 2007 when loan\nrepayment  commences.  Tariff  collection  is  targeted  at  100  percent.  However,  proposed  tariff\ncalculation  includes  a  conservative  assumption  of  65  percent  in  the  early  years  of  operation\nrising  to  75  percent  by  2010.  The  proposed  tariff  structure  will  achieve  full  cost  recovery.\nProposed average tariffs per m3 in 2007 in constant prices are SUM103 in Djizzak, SUM119 in\nGulistan, and SUM95 in Karshi, (equivalent to about $0.14 to $0.17 at the commercial exchange\nrate).  To  improve  affordability,  nonresidential  customers  are  proposed  to  continue  to  cross-\nsubsidize  residential  customers  and  a  lifeline  tariff  for  residential  customers  is  proposed  to\nassist  those  on  low  incomes.  Under  this  tariff  structure,  the  proposed  household  charge  for\naverage  water  consumption  will  be  in  the  order  of  SUM687  to  SUM932  (equivalent  to  about\n$1.00  to  $1.40  at  the  commercial  exchange  rate)  per  month  in  constant  2001  prices.  These\nrepresent an increase of about 2.3 to 2.8 times the current charge and are about 4 to 5 percent\nof  average  household  income.  Nonresidential  tariffs  will  be  about  SUM150  to  SUM190\n(equivalent to $0.22 to $0.28 at the commercial exchange rate) per m3 in constant 2001 prices.\n\n75.\nSince required tariff levels are sensitive to changes in production, losses, consumption,\ncollection  rates,  actual  costs,  and  inflation  among  other  factors,  tariffs  must  be  reviewed\nregularly,  and  appropriate  tariffs  implemented,  both  during  project  construction  and  beyond\n2007.  In  particular,  the  implication  of  the  vodokanals  bearing  the  foreign  exchange  risk  is  that\ntariffs will need to increase more in order to meet loan repayments if the commercial exchange\nrate  depreciates  further  than  anticipated.  If  the  vodokanals  are  not  able  to  bear  the  full  debt\nservice of the loan and continue to adequately operate and maintain the water supply system,\nthe  central  Government  would  consider  subsidizing  their  debt  service  requirement.  The\nGovernment  agreed  that  the  vodokanals  should  prioritize  O&M  expenditure  to  ensure  that\nexisting and future service delivery is sustainable.\n\nH. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts\n\nimpacts.  Being  a  category  B  project,  an \n\nEach of the water supply components in the project cities, and the Project as a whole,\n76.\nwill  generate  positive  environmental \ninitial\nenvironmental  examination  was  undertaken  using  criteria  specified  in  ADB\u2019s  Environmental\nGuidelines for Selected Infrastructure Projects  (Appendix  11).  None  of  the  components  will\ncause  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  based  on  the  screening  of  possible\nenvironmental  consequences  using  ADB  checklists.  The  components  will  reduce  per  capita\nwater  consumption  (and  unaccounted  for  water),  and  will  reduce  energy  requirements  by\nimproving  efficiency  of  equipment  and  operation  of  distribution  networks.  The  quality  of  water\nreleased  into  the  distribution  networks  will  be  improved  with  less  likelihood  for  the  spread  of\nwaterborne  diseases.  None  of  the  Project\u2019s  physical  construction  activities  will  permanently\nadversely affect natural or cultural resources, or sensitive ecological zones, and no resettlement\nof residents or affected persons is required.\n\n77.\nTemporary  and  local  problems,  such  as  traffic  disruption  and  removal  of  topsoil,  will\noccur  during  construction  works.  These  are  routine,  minor  problems  that  will  not  have  a\nsignificant impact on the population. The vodokanals and their contractors are well experienced\nin  managing  construction  activities  to  mitigate  such  problems.  Operational  problems  are\nunlikely.  Where  new  equipment  is  installed,  the  operators  will  receive  O&M  training.  Improved\n\n\f25\n\nefficiency in all phases of the services combined with tariff reforms will improve the generation\nof  revenues  to  sustain  adequate  O&M  levels.  The  vodokanals,  working  in  conjunction  with\ndesign  institutes,  have  the  capability  to  assess  environmental  impacts  of  the  activities,  and  to\nprepare  the  statements  of  environmental  impacts  and  consequences  required  by  Uzbekistan\nlaw. Careful control of the discharge of rainwater from trenches or flushing waters from mains\nwill  be  exercised  during  construction  operations  to  follow  existing  regulations  and  procedures.\nSafety  officers  in  the  utility  agencies  will  be  included  in  training  provided  to  operators  of\nequipment under the Project, to ensure proper mitigation of potential hazardous situations.\n\n2. \n\nSocial Measures\n\nA social analysis following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Incorporation of Social Dimensions and\n78.\nHandbook for Incorporation of Social Dimensions in Projects  was  undertaken  to  evaluate  the\nstatus  of  water  supply  and  other  urban  infrastructure  service  delivery  and  the  demands  of  the\npeople, including the poor, living in the project cities. Views of the community concerned were\nobtained  regarding  their  infrastructure  service  needs  and  willingness  to  pay  fees  for  improved\nservices. The results of the social analysis are incorporated in project formulation as outlined in\nAppendix 12. The social analysis indicates that the potential beneficiaries show a high level of\ninterest and support for each project component. Implementation of the Project does not require\nany resettlement.\n\n79.\nA random survey of the target population was conducted to yield information pertinent to\ndesigning aspects of the Project that would address the needs of the poor. The findings of the\nsurvey provided a socioeconomic profile (para. 36 and Appendix 12), which provided the basis\nfor  including  the  specific  social  measures  described  in  para.  45.  Such  elements  are\nmechanisms  to  ensure  that  all  consumers,  particularly  the  poor  and  women,  will  be  able  to\nparticipate  in  project  implementation,  receive  the  benefits  of  improved  water  supply,  and  are\nwilling  and  can  afford  to  pay  for  the  water  services  (paras.  45  and  69).  The  formation  of\nconsumer  committees  and  related  support  for  their  activities  is  consistent  with  the  cultural\ntradition  of  community  participation,  embodied  in  the  mahalla  committee  system  (footnote  8).\nWomen\u2019s  involvement  will  be  facilitated  through  the  committee  members\u2019  capacity  to\nincorporate  best  practices  in  organizing  and  training  aspects,  and  also  to  ensure  their\nmembership  will  include  ethnic  minority  groups  in  the  target  population.  These  features  are\nexpected  to  serve  as  the  keystone  for  (i)  bridging  service  providers  with  consumers;  (ii)\ncoordinating  with  line  ministries  responsible  for  promoting  water  conservation  awareness,\ndrinking water, and health standards; and (iii) providing a voice for the target population to alert\nthe responsible authorities to their particular needs or problems. In short, these built-in features\nare  socially  sound  and  will  encourage  stakeholder  ownership  and  accountability  for  project\nimplementation.\n\nI. \n\nTechnical Assistance\n\n80.\nThe  Government  requested  advisory  TA  for  capacity  building  of  urban  water  supply\ndelivery and services, to be processed in conjunction with the Project. The TA\u2019s main objective\nis to strengthen sector institutions and train concerned staff at various levels of government in\nappropriate  management  systems  for  delivering  sustainable  urban  water  supply  services.  The\nTA  will  also  initiate  systems  for  involving  the  community  in  the  planning  of  the  services  to  be\nprovided by mobilizing and training NGOs and CBOs to undertake this work under the Project.\nThe  services  provided  under  the  TA  will  encompass  (i)  international  and  domestic  consulting\nservices;  (ii)  training  of  government  and  vodokanal  staff,  and  community  leaders;  and  (iii)\nestablishment of a training center through which the training activities can be coordinated.\n\n\f26\n\nUCSA will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The PSC established for the Project will\n81.\nalso supervise TA implementation to maximize use of TA findings in local government reform.\nThe main beneficiaries will be the consumers who receive improved services as a result of the\nimplementation  of  better  management  systems.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  seven\nmonths,  commencing  in  the  second  month  after  loan  effectiveness.  It  will  require  17  person-\nmonths of international consulting inputs and 32 person-months of domestic consulting inputs in\nthe  areas  of  project  management  and  training  for  institutional  development,  financial\nmanagement,  community  participation,  and  water  supply  engineering.  The  consultants  will  be\nrecruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other\narrangements for the engagement of domestic consultants.\n\n82.\nThe  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $860,000  equivalent,  of  which  $513,500  is  the  foreign\nexchange  cost  and  $346,500  equivalent  the  local  currency  cost.  Of  this  cost,  $600,000\nequivalent will be funded by ADB on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, financed by the\nGovernment of Japan. This includes the entire foreign exchange cost and $86,500 equivalent of\nthe local currency cost. The Government will finance the remaining $260,000 equivalent of local\ncurrency  cost,  representing  expenditures  (in  kind  or  cash)  for  remuneration  and  travel  cost  of\ncounterpart  staff,  translation,  interpretation  of  government  documents,  administrative  support,\noffice  space,  and  furniture.  A  detailed  TA  description  and  terms  of  reference  is  given  in\nAppendix 13.\n\nV. \n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial Analyses\n\n1. \n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n83.\nUrban  water  supply  services  in  the  project  cities  are  inadequate.  Assets  have\ndeteriorated and lack of maintenance is such that service delivery of water is severely affected.\nWithout major investment in the near future the central water supply will continue to deteriorate\nrapidly,  with  serious  consequences  for  economic  activity  and  livelihood.  Currently,  water\nrationing  occurs  in  all  three  cities.    Water  shortages,  cuts,  and  pressure  problems  mean  that\nonly about 60 percent of the population receive some water every day. Without the Project, by\n2007, the water supply system in Djizzak and Karshi will probably fail to supply even basic water\nrequirements  and  30  percent  of  the  population  will  not  have  access  to  a  piped  water  supply.\nThis proportion of households without access to a piped water supply is expected to gradually\nincrease,  until  the  system  totally  fails,  which  is  expected  within  15  years.  In  Gulistan,  the\nsituation is even more severe, where without the Project, by 2007, 100 percent of households\nwill  be  without  access  to  a  piped  water  supply,  since  total  failure  of  the  system  is  expected\nwithin five years. The Project is considered high priority by the Government, is timely, and well\nintegrated with other investment activity. The Project will benefit about 484,000 residential water\nsupply  customers,  industries,  small  businesses,  and  other  organizations  in  the  three  cities.\nAccess to a clean, safe, and reliable water supply system will benefit poor and nonpoor alike as\nthey  are  not  geographically  separated  and  all  households  will  have  access  to  the  improved\nsystem.\n\n84.\nThe  water  supply  components  will  (i)  generate  major  efficiency  gains,  reducing\ndistribution  leakage,  and  water  and  electricity  costs;  (ii)  improve  cost  recovery  through  better\ncustomer satisfaction with service delivery; (iii) reduce natural resource depletion; (iv) improve\npublic  health  by  reducing  the  incidence  of  waterborne  diseases;  and  (v)  support  economic\n\n\f27\n\nrecovery.  Unaccounted for water will be reduced from an estimated more than 40 percent, to a\ntarget of 30 percent in 2007.\n\n85.\nAn  analysis  of  alternatives  was  undertaken.  Djizzak  has  no  alternative  water  source  in\nthe short to medium term; the only alternative water source from the Zarafshan river scheme will\nnot be available within the time frame of this Project. In Gulistan, two specific alternatives were\nconsidered,  including  total  reliance  on  the  borehole  field  at  Dehkanabad  (under  the\nresponsibility of UCSA) and total reliance on borehole fields under the responsibility of the city\nvodokanal.  However,  both  alternatives  are  about  10  percent  more  expensive  and  the  chosen\nscheme is more acceptable in terms of implementation. In Karshi, the unit costs of the chosen\nscheme  were  about  10  percent  cheaper  than  the  next  best  alternative.  The  consideration  of\nalternative  sources  was  strengthened  by  the  choice  of  the  most  cost-effective  rehabilitation  of\nthe distribution system. Only items that were considered essential for establishing a sustainable\nsystem were included in the project design.\n\n86.\nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) calculation was undertaken in constant 2001\nprices  using  the  domestic  price  numeraire,  since  the  outputs  are  nontradable  in  nature.\nEconomic costs, excluding taxes and financial prices, are converted using factors of (i) 2.0 for\nthe  shadow  exchange  rate  factor  (SERF)  and  (ii)  0.8  for  labor.  Nonincremental  economic\nbenefits that were valued include (i) use of bottled water, (ii) time savings for water collection,\n(iii)  industrial  resource  cost  savings,  and  (iv)  savings  of  health  expenditure.  Incremental\neconomic benefits that were valued include (i) residential willingness to pay, and (ii) increases in\nsmall business output.\n\nThe  EIRR  is  18.2  percent  in  Djizzak,  17.2  percent  in  Gulistan,  and  24.4  percent  in\n87.\nKarshi.  For the three cities the EIRR exceeds the economic opportunity cost of capital, which is\nassumed to be 12 percent. Standard sensitivity tests were undertaken to consider the impact of\neconomic  risks,  encompassed  in  adverse  cost  and  benefit  scenarios  and  delays  in  benefits.\nSince  the  economic  risk  is  considered  to  be  higher  than  for  standard  ADB  projects,  the\nsensitivity tests were set at 20 percent. In addition, for each city, project-specific sensitivity tests\nwere  undertaken.  These  include  (i)  a  higher  SERF,  equivalent  to  the  use  of  the  market\nexchange  rate,  (ii)  increases  in  key  O&M  costs,  and  (iii)  decreases  in  demand  for  bottled\nwater\u2014the  most  sensitive  valued  benefit.  Under  all  the  sensitivity  tests,  the  components  were\nfound to be economically viable. Sensitivity indicators and switching values were calculated for\nstandard sensitivity tests and for the SERF. The SERF would need to exceed 4.0, for the EIRR\nto fall below the economic opportunity cost of capital. A summary of the economic analysis is in\nAppendix 14.\n\n2. \n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nProject financial appraisal was undertaken for each component, comparing the financial\n88.\ninternal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  with  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital;  and  the  average\nincremental cost with the average incremental revenue. Costs include capital costs in line with\nthe  implementation  schedule,  operational  costs,  and  replacement  costs.  Estimates  of  O&M\ncosts consider improvements in efficiency, particularly in the use of electricity, volume of water\nproduced,  and  specific  maintenance  requirements  for  the  facilities  created  under  the  Project.\nOnly additional costs resulting from the Project were included in the FIRR calculation.\n\nRevenues come from  direct  user charges at an assumed collection rate of 65 percent.\n89.\nThis  is  a  considerable  improvement  on  the  current  collection  rate,  which  is  about  30  to  40\npercent. Tariffs are assumed to stay constant in real terms beyond 2007.\n\n\f28\n\nThe  FIRR  is  9.5  percent  in  Djizzak,  9.5  percent  in  Gulistan,  and  8.4  percent  in  Karshi.\n90.\nAll exceed the weighted average cost of capital, which is about 5.0 percent, demonstrating that\nat  proposed  tariff  levels  the  Project  is  financially  viable.  Switching  values  and  sensitivity\nindicators were tested, and the components were found to be financially viable under adverse\ncost and revenue scenarios.\n\n91.\nFinancial projections were prepared for the vodokanals for 2001 to 2017, 10 years after\nproject  completion.  Existing  cash  flow  difficulties  are  expected  to  continue  during  project\nimplementation  since  poor  service  delivery  is  one  of  the  main  reasons  for  low  tariff  collection.\nThis should not affect project implementation since all counterpart funds are externally financed\nand  project  assets  will  be  transferred  to  the  vodokanals.  However,  once  service  delivery\nimproves and new charging arrangements and tariff increases are in place in 2007, the financial\nperformance  of  the  vodokanal  is  acceptable  and  key  ratios  satisfy  requirements.  The  debt\nservice  ratios  exceed  1.2;  debt-equity  ratios  are  less  than  one;  and  the  vodokanals  make  a\nsmall profit in the years after project implementation. Detailed financial analysis is in Appendix\n15.\n\n3. \n\nAffordability Analysis and Project Sustainability\n\n92.\nAs  discussed  in  para.  73,  full  cost  recovery  from  user  charges  is  targeted  for  all  three\ncities to ensure project sustainability and operation of the utility agencies. At the same time, the\npoor must be protected from the increase in charges. Current tariff is based on a flat per capita\ncharge irrespective of the volume of water consumed. The proposed tariff structure will charge\ncustomers  by  volume  of  water  used  and  a  lifeline  tariff  is  proposed  for  low  consumption\nhouseholds. An affordability analysis has been undertaken to assess whether the proposed tariff\nis  affordable  to  residential  consumers,  based  on  estimated  tariffs  and  household  income  data\nfrom the social survey. Since a single tariff is neither appropriate nor affordable, a tariff structure\nhas  been  prepared  for  each  city,  based  on  the  assessment  of  average  required  tariff  and  the\ndemand for water use by customer type. The proposed structure includes a lifeline tariff set at\n75 lcd, a tariff for consumption between 75 lcd and 125 lcd, and a higher tariff for consumption\nover 125 lcd. Different tariffs will be charged for residential and nonresidential consumers.\n\nAverage  household  charges  were  compared  with  willingness-to-pay.  Results  from  the\n93.\nhousehold  survey  showed  that  households  were  willing  to  pay  an  average  of  SUM1,054  per\nmonth  for  water.  Proposed  charges  for  average  water  consumption  ranging  from  SUM687  to\nSUM957 per household are below the average willingness-to-pay.\n\n94.\nProposed  average  household  charges  were  also  compared  with  average  household\nincome. Water charges for less than 5 percent of income are considered to be affordable, in line\nwith ADB affordability criteria. Proposed charges are 4 percent of household income in Djizzak,\n5 percent in Gulistan, and 4 percent in Karshi. For very low-income residents, proposed charges\nfor 75 lcd were compared with the income of the poorest 10 percent of households. Proposed\ncharges  are  lower  than  5  percent  of  household  income  in  the  three  project  cities.  Detailed\naffordability analysis is in Appendix 16.\n\nB. \n\nEnvironment\n\n95.\nThe  Project\u2019s  physical  components  will  have  no  adverse  impact  on  the  environment.\nMost of the physical work is rehabilitation of existing infrastructure. New construction comprises\ntrunk  mains,  closed  water  reservoirs,  and  additions  to  municipal  distribution  networks.  These\nworks  will  not  encroach  on  sensitive  ecological,  cultural,  or  historical  sites.  The  Project  is\n\n\f29\n\nexpected to have positive impact on the environment by improving the quality of delivered water\nand the efficiency of service operation. The abstraction and production of water will more closely\nmatch  consumer  demand  by  reducing  inefficiencies  and  losses.  Similarly,  electrical  power\nconsumption  will  be  optimized.  The  use  of  metering  and  consumption-based  billing  will\nencourage  conservation  by  users.  Continuous  environmental  monitoring  will  be  undertaken  as\npart  of  the  project  performance  monitoring  system  to  ensure  construction  quality  and\nenvironmental management meets national standards.\n\nC. \n\nSocial Dimensions\n\n1. \n\nSocial Impact\n\nTwenty-four hour provision of safe drinking water will make a significant positive impact\n96.\non  the  lives  of  people  in  all  income  groups  (especially  women).  Public  health  will  improve\nsignificantly,  and  indirectly  less  income  will  be  spent  on  medical  services,  school  days,  and\nworkdays lost due to sickness related to waterborne diseases. Better water supply also means\nimproved  treatment  facilities  for  patients  in  hospital.  Based  on  research  in  the  country,24  the\nincidence  of  hepatitis  A  and  dysentery  will  decrease  by  about  60  percent  and  typhoid  by  90\npercent with the provision of a chlorinated piped water supply system. Implementation of health\nawareness programs under the Project will enhance the benefits. Project benefits will be further\nenhanced by the creation of potential jobs in small plumbing repairs. Small businesses such as\nrestaurants and hairdressers that rely on continuous water supply will also benefit.\n\n2. \n\nPoverty Impact\n\n97.\nDespite the lack of an agreed or official poverty line, an assessment of absolute poverty\nwas undertaken to estimate the proportion of poor and nonpoor beneficiaries. All available data,\nincluding data on income, expenditure, and quality of life, was reviewed. The problems involved\nin defining a poverty line include (i) the use of official statistics that are not always reliable; (ii)\nthe  use  of  narrow  definitions  of  poverty  that  tend  to  ignore  the  economic,  cultural,  and  social\nsituation  in  the  project  area  and  the  difficulty  of  measuring  nonmonetary  benefits;  and  (iii)\nunregistered income, which may form a significant part of actual income levels. For the purpose\nof estimating the proportion of poor beneficiaries in the Project, a poverty line of SUM4,000 per\ncapita per month has been used (paras. 11 and 12). Based on this poverty line the social survey\nindicates that about 45 percent of the total 484,000 project beneficiaries in the three cities are\npoor. The proportion of poor households is 37 percent in Djizzak, 44 percent in Gulistan, and 51\npercent in Karshi. However, the Project will improve the water supply service to all beneficiaries\nwhether defined as poor or not. The difference between the poor and nonpoor is that the poor\nare the least likely to be able to cope when water supply services break down as they cannot\nafford  to  pay  for  alternatives.  Service  delivery  of  water  will  worsen  if  the  Project  does  not\nproceed,  as  facilities  will  continue  to  deteriorate  and  the  service  will  become  increasingly\nintermittent or fail completely.\n\n98.\nThe Project will benefit the poor by improving the quality of urban water services. This\nwill not directly generate income or give people the means to pull themselves out of poverty but\nwill improve their quality of life. Moreover, since the impact of not undertaking the Project may\nresult in a failure of city water supply, the consequence would be more poor people deprived a\n\n                  \n\n24 American Society of Tropical Disease Medicine and Hygiene; Ministry of Health, Uzbekistan; Swiss Disaster Relief\nCenter;  US  Center  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention;  and  US  Agency  for  International  Development.  1998.\nWater Distribution System and Diarrheal Disease Transmission: A Case Study in Uzbekistan. Tashkent.\n\n\f30\n\nbasic need, therefore the overall impact of the Project is pro-poor and positive. The Project will\nbenefit poor households by introducing a tariff structure that charges by volume of water used\nand  a  lifeline  tariff  for  low  consumption  households.  Quality  of  life  measures  related  to  water\nsupply  for  households  appropriate  for  the  Project  include  (i)  access  to  safe  drinking  water;  (ii)\naccess to washing facilities; (iii) morbidity level due to exposure to waterborne diseases (para.\n96); and (iv) proportion of day spent on water collection, i.e., loss of productive time. Time saved\nfrom  collecting  water  will  be  about  70  to  80  minutes  per  day.  Area  targeting  of  low-income\nhouseholds is not achievable in Uzbekistan as low-income and middle-income households live\nside  by  side  in  the  cities.  The  lack  of  a  housing  market  together  with  Uzbek  cultural  norms  of\nattachment \nto\nneighborhoods with better services. However, while middle and higher income households are\nable  to  purchase  alternative  services,  e.g.,  large  water  storage  containers  and  water  pumps,\nlower  income  households  are  more  vulnerable  to  service  deficiencies  as  these  coping\nmechanisms are unaffordable. These families are more vulnerable to sickness and are likely to\nspend  a  large  proportion  of  their  income  on  medical  treatment.  This  sickness  can  lead  to\ncomparatively  low  school  attendance  and  decreased  ability  to  learn  or  to  be  involved  in\nproductive  work.  The  Project  will  also  create  construction-related  job  opportunities  for  the\nunemployed  skilled  and  unskilled  laborers  during  the  implementation  stage.  About  2,100\nperson-months of skilled employment and about 5,000 person-months of unskilled employment\nwill be created by the Project. The results of the poverty impact assessment are in Appendix 17.\n\nthe  movement  of  higher \n\nland  have  restricted \n\nincome  households \n\nto \n\n3. \n\nGender and Development\n\n99.\nThe  Project  will  benefit  women  as  they  are  traditionally  responsible  for  cooking  and\ncleaning  and  taking  care  of  the  family,  and  are  highly  affected  by  problems  associated  with\nwater  supply.  Survey  data  show  that  around  13  percent  of  all  households  in  autumn  and  35\npercent  of  households  in  summer  could  not  get  water  from  taps  inside  their  homes.\nConsequently, women, particularly those in lower income households, spend a large proportion\nof their time collecting water and often walk considerable distances to collect it as they cannot\nafford to buy water storage tanks. One third of all households indicated that they walk more than\n200 meters to collect water, often making several trips per day, when water is not available in\ntheir houses. The average time spent per day collecting water is about 45 minutes in winter and\nabout  85  minutes  in  summer.  Women  also  dominate  the  teaching  profession  and  teachers\nreported that they have to organize lessons around water supply schedules. The improvement\nof  the  water  supply  system  to  ensure  continuous  supply  throughout  the  year  will  significantly\nreduce time spent collecting water and will directly benefit women and children who share the\nprimary  responsibility  for  carrying  water  to  the  household.  Women  will  also  receive  training\nunder  the  Project\u2019s  capacity  building  program  and  through  their  participation  in  the  consumer\ncommittees.\n\nD.\n\nRisks\n\n100.\nFive  possible  risks  have  been  identified:  (i)  delay  in  project  implementation  due  to\ninadequate counterpart funds; (ii) lack of institutional capacity, particularly at the local level, and\nexperience  in  implementing  large  projects  and  lack  of  knowledge  of  ADB  procedures;  (iii)\ninability to set and collect tariffs to achieve the tariff collection rate target because of consumers\u2019\nunwillingness  to  pay;  (iv)  the  benefit  of  the  lifeline  tariff  may  not  reach  poor  households  in\napartment buildings as individual water meters will not be installed in each apartment unit due to\nhigh  cost  (footnote  20);  and  (v)  devaluation  of  the  currency  because  of  the  unification  of  the\nofficial and commercial exchange rates.\n\n\f31\n\nThe  possibility  of  delay  in  implementation  due  to  lack  of  counterpart  funds  has  been\n101.\naddressed. The central and local governments and utility agencies have a written commitment\nto provide the necessary counterpart funds through taxes, duties, and budgetary allocations that\ninclude  contributions  in  kind.  Measures  to  reduce  possible  delays,  including  delays  in\ncounterpart  funds,  have  been  discussed  with  the  Government.  A  clear  delineation  of  agency\nresponsibilities  and  appropriate  mechanisms  for  coordination  has  been  identified  to  avoid  the\nrisk of delay in implementation. The issue of financial capability has been dealt with by including\nthe  capacity  building  program,  which  should  strengthen  the  capacity  to  cope  with  O&M  of  the\nimproved systems. A comprehensive training program is included as a major project component\nto  assist  in  project  implementation.  Through  O&M  training,  the  vodokanals  will  be  trained  to\nensure their effectiveness in project implementation and O&M. The capacity building component\nwill  comprise  customer  service  training  and  regular  monitoring  of  customer  satisfaction  to\nimprove  service  delivery  and  consumers\u2019  willingness  to  pay.  Social  surveys  have  shown  that\nconsumers  are  willing  to  pay  the  tariffs  proposed  if  service  delivery  is  reliable.  Although\nindividual water meters will not be installed for each apartment unit, all apartment buildings will\nbe  metered  at  the  basement,  and  charging  by  volume  will  still  benefit  all  households  living  in\napartments.  The  utility  charges  of  poor  households  in  apartment  buildings  are  currently  being\nsubsidized. By involving the community in project implementation, local mahalla committees and\nconsumer committees will ensure that poor households will continue to be subsidized under the\nnew tariff structure.\n\n102.\nThe anticipated unification of the official currency exchange rate with the commercial or\nmarket rate could result in a currency devaluation during the life of the Project. Devaluation may\nincrease  counterpart  contributions  to  local  project  costs  in  money  terms  by  fueling  inflation,\nalthough the equivalent dollar cost will remain unchanged or be reduced. The inflationary impact\nis  mitigated  by  the  use  of  high,  local  cost  escalation  factors  for  local  price  contingencies.\nDevaluation  of  the  currency  to  a  level  below  that  anticipated  will  cause  the  debt  service\nobligations of the vodokanals to increase since vodokanals are required to repay the loan at the\nprevailing  commercial  exchange  rate  under  the  subsidiary  loan  agreement.  If  the  currency\ndepreciates  to  the  extent  that  the  vodokanals  cannot  cover  the  cost  of  debt  service  and  O&M\nthrough  user  charges,  the  Government  has  agreed  that  the  vodokanals  will  prioritize\nexpenditure on O&M. In these circumstances, the Government will review the vodokanals\u2019 debt\nservice obligations.\n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances\n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES\n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\n\n103.\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n\n(i) \n\nCounterpart  Funding.

It  was  established  under  President  Decree  No.  2791  (19  December  2000),  and  its\norganization and functions were approved by the Cabinet of Ministers under Resolution No. 493\n(21  December  2000).  The  reorganization \nthe  Government\u2019s  reform  and\ndecentralization policy on communal services. UCSA reports to the Cabinet of Ministers, but is\nnow  a  self-financing  institution  funded  by  income  from  the  enterprises  and  organizations  that\nmake up UCSA. The central Government is expected to provide some form of financial support\nduring  the  early  years  of  transition.  UCSA  is  responsible  for  coordinating  the  reform  of  the\ncommunal services system, developing normative-legal acts, and implementing controls on the\nenforcement  of  current  legislation  and  established  technical  requirements.  The  department\nresponsible for water in the ministry was reorganized into a general directorate responsible for\noperation and development of interregional trunk water mains only. All other responsibilities for\nthe  delivery  of  drinking  water  were  devolved  to  the  oblast  (province)  and  city  levels.  The\ntechnical  design  institutes  for  communal  services  and  the  center  for  developing  norms  and\nguidelines and technical training remain subordinated to UCSA to provide technical advice and\nservices to the utility agencies at the local levels.\n\n2. \nUCSA has considerable experience in dealing with rehabilitation and upgrading of urban\ninfrastructure  facilities  and  management  of  infrastructure  projects  under  its  former  capacity  as\nthe  Ministry  of  Communal  Services.  UCSA  has  43  professional  and  technical  staff  with\nextensive experience in the operation and maintenance of communal infrastructure assets and\ncoordination  of  infrastructure  projects.  The  capacity  of  UCSA  to  manage  Asian  Development\nBank  projects  has  been  strengthened  through  implementation  of  the  project  preparation\ntechnical  assistance  for  the  proposed  Project  and  will  be  further  strengthened  under  the\nProject\u2019s capacity building activities. In support of the Project, UCSA has assigned four full-time\nstaff  to  the  project  management  unit  (PMU).  These  include  one  director,  one  deputy  director,\nand two senior engineers, all of whom have between 10 to 20 years professional experience in\nwater supply projects. The PMU office will be located at UCSA\u2019s headquarters in Tashkent.\n\nB. \n\nTerritorial Communal Exploitation Agency and City Vodokanals\n\n3. \nThe  territorial  communal  exploitation  agency  (TCEA)  in  each  oblast  has  overall\nresponsibility  for  providing  communal  services,  including  drinking  water,  central  heating,  and\nsewerage in their oblast. The TCEA reports to its oblast government, but maintains a working\nrelationship with UCSA in reforming the communal services system. The TCEA is responsible\nfor large capital development and infrastructure programs in the oblast and is in charge of the\noblast vodokanals, which manage the city vodokanals.\n\nThe city vodokanals are responsible for providing drinking water and sanitation services\n4. \nwithin  the  city,  and  for  system  operation  and  maintenance.  The  vodokanals  work  closely  with\nthe  city  government,  which  owns  these  public  infrastructure  assets.  The  vodokanals  are  self-\nfinancing  institutions  and  do  not  receive  operational  subsidies  from  the  Government.  Most\nvodokanals are suffering from financial constraints due to poor tariff collection rates. As a result\nthey do not have adequate funds for necessary capital investment to enable the infrastructure\nsystems to function properly. Staff at the vodokanals have extensive engineering and technical\nexperience in operation and maintenance works.\n\n\f40\n\nAppendix 3\n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE SECTOR\n\nLending\nInstitution\n\nCold Water Supply Project\n\nRemarks\n\nWorld Bank\n\n(cid:1)  Bukhara (with Spanish\n\nGovernment)\n\n(cid:1)  Samarkand (with French\n\nGovernment)\n\n(cid:1)  Urgench (with Kuwait Fund)\n(cid:1)  Nukus (with Kuwait Fund)\n\nKuwait Fund (cid:1)  Urgench (with World Bank)\n\n(cid:1)  Same as point 2 above.\n\n(cid:1)  Nukus (with World Bank)\n\n(cid:1)  Samarkand (with World Bank)\n\n(cid:1)  Same as point 1 above.\n\n(cid:1)  Bukhara (with World Bank)\n\n(cid:1)  Same as point 1 above.\n\nFrench\nGovernment\n\nSpanish\nGovernment\n\n1.

It  is  characterized  by  (i)  limited  availability  of  raw  water  resources;  (ii)  high  per  capita\nconsumption  because  of  lack  of  conservation  awareness  and  responsibility;  (iii)  underfunded\nassets  leading  to  antiquated  equipment,  inefficiencies,  and  failures;  (iv)  diversity  of  corporate\ninvolvement; and (v) inability  to  manage assets in an effective manner  due to limited financial\nresources and restricted technological expertise. The Project seeks to address these problems\nand to create a modern and efficient operation from which the whole population can expect an\nacceptable standard of service at an affordable cost.\n \n2.\nThe proposed components are summarized in Table A4.  Existing borehole performance\nyields  will  be  tested.  Some  boreholes  will  be  abandoned  and  those  remaining  will  be\nrefurbished,  including  the  provision  of  new  pumps,  riser  pipes,  switchgear,  and  controls.  One\nnew borehole will be constructed. Total water production will be metered. The reservoir capacity\nwill  be  increased,  where  necessary,  to  provide  an  adequate1  reserve  of  water  to  satisfy\nvariations  in  demand,  temporary  failures,  and  sufficient  retention  time  to  enable  particulate\nmatter  that  might  otherwise  have  an  adverse  effect  on  meter  performance  to  settle  out.  All\nreservoirs  will  be  equipped  with  new,  automatic  chlorinators.  Primary  pumping  into  the  supply\nand  distribution  network  is  necessary  in  each  city  and  these  pumping  stations  will  be  fully\nreequipped.  Alternative  electricity  supplies  to  all  boreholes  and  primary  pumping  stations  will\nprotect against single-source failures.\n \n\n Table A4: Summary of Project Components\n\nItems\nBoreholes \u2013 rehabilitation\nBoreholes \u2013 new\nReservoir storage\nChlorination\n\nMajor pumping stations \u2013 reequip\n\nMinor pumping stations \u2013 reequip and new\nReplacement of fragile/defective mains\nConstruction of new mains \u2013 strengthen supply and\nimproved distribution coverage\nSupply, district, consumer metering (approx.)\nAsset management facilities\n\nLaboratory testing \u2013 equipment and reagents\nOther:  Replacement of sections of transmission main\n\nDjizzak\n\n55\n1\n6 x 500 m3\n12 units\n\n6 pumps\n\n23 pumps\n37 km\n91 km\n\nGulistan\n\n20\n0\n10 000 m3\n1 unit\n\n4 pumps\n\n0\n45 km\n36 km\n\nKarshi\n\n60\n0\n10 000 m3\n4 units\n\n10 pumps\n\n26 pumps\n60 km\n40 km\n\n13,100\nEquipment and\nplant\nYes\n0\n\n15,550\nEquipment and\nplant\nYes\n0\n\n28,800\nEquipment and\nplant\nYes\n9 km\n\n \n3.\nPipework that is either designated as sensitive or having a record of frequent failures will\nbe  replaced.

Some extensions of the network will improve coverage.\n\nMetering of all private properties and individual apartment blocks will facilitate consumer\n4.\nawareness  of  consumption,  the  opportunity  for  voluntary  conservation,  and  enable  a  greatly\nimproved  opportunity  for  cost  recovery.  The  Project  will  make  improvements  to  operation\nfacilities, such as laboratory, asset management equipment, and computerization. Maintenance\nequipment and a range of spares are also included.\n\n1 Generally 15 hours at average daily demand.\n\n                  \n\n\fDETAILED COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN\n\n42\n\nAppendix 5, page 1\n\nTable A5.1: Cost Estimates\n($ million)\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal\nCost\n\nComponent\n\nA.

The  checklist  of  water\nproject actions known to affect environmental resources and values was applied.\n\n2.\nThe  project  implementation  units  (PIUs)  to  be  set  up  under  the  Project  and  the  utility\nagencies  concerned  will  also  conduct  environmental  screening  of  the  water  supply  projects\naccording to the laws of Uzbekistan. The law requires that an environmental impact statement\nbe  prepared  starting  at  the  time  of  the  selection  of  the  construction  site,  and  with  tasks\ncontinuing through the preparation of feasibility studies, implementation, and construction.\n\nDescription of the Project\n\nB.\n\n3.\n\nThe Project\u2019s physical components comprise works as identified generally in Table A11.\n\nTable A11: Physical Components\n\nWater Supply Component\nRehabilitation of borehole\nNew borehole\nStorage reservoir\nChlorine dosing facility\nMajor pumping station (1 in each town)\nLocal booster pumping\nReplace fragile/defective mains\nConstruction of new mains\nSupply, district, consumer metering\nAsset management facilities\nLaboratory testing\nReplace transmission main\nkm = kilometer, m3 = cubic meters.\n\nDjizzak\n55\n1\n6 x 500 m3\n12 units\n6 pumps\n6 stations\n37 km\n91 km\n13,100\nEquipment and plant\nFull package\n0\n\nGulistan\n20\n0\n10,000 m3\n1 unit\n4 pumps\n0\n45 km\n36 km\n15,550\nEquipment and plant\nFull package\n0\n\nKarshi\n60\n0\n10,000 m3\n4 units\n10 pumps\n8 stations\n60 km\n40 km\n28,800\nEquipment and plant\nFull package\n9 km\n\nC.\n\nDescription of the Environment\n\n4.\nPhysical. Most of the project works will occur within the urban environment where low\ndensity and generous street rights-of-way prevail. The climate is hot and dry in summer, causing\na significant increase in water use.\n\n5.\nThe  quality  of  abstracted  raw  water  is  generally  suitable  for  potable  use  according  to\nnational  standards  and,  apart  from  chlorination,  no  other  treatment  is  provided.  The  water  is\ntransmitted in large, buried pipelines, stored in closed reservoirs, then chlorinated and pumped\ninto the below-ground distribution network.\n\nEcological.  Years  of  intensive  agricultural  production,  primarily  cotton  growing,  has\n6.\ncaused serious, long-term ecological problems in Uzbekistan. Rivers are badly polluted by cattle\nhusbandry, industrial effluent, and sewage, in addition to receiving surface runoff and leachate\nloaded  with  agrochemicals.  Urban  areas  also  suffer  local  soil  contamination  from  industrial\nwastes and effluents, and from solid waste disposal in landfills. However, the three project cities\nall  rely  on  aquifers  that  are  primarily  recharged  by  runoff  from  mountain  snowmelt.  They  are,\ntherefore, relatively unaffected by the ecological concerns mentioned above.\n\n\f54\n\nAppendix 11, page 2\n\nSocioeconomic.  Deficient  urban  communal  services  have  social  and  health  impacts.\n7.\nThe negative impacts of poor communal services on public health are amplified by higher urban\npopulation density. In particular, irregular water supplies through fragile underground networks\nwhere  polluted  groundwater  exists  (from  lack  of  adequate  sanitation)  increases  the  risks  of\nwaterborne diseases.\n\nD.\n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n\n1. \n\nProject Location\n\n8.\nThe proposed work predominantly comprises rehabilitation of existing infrastructure and\na  modest  increase  in  water  storage  facilities.  With  the  exception  of  wellfield  rehabilitation  and\nrepairs  to  transmission  mains,  all  work  will  be  confined  to  the  urban  areas.  None  of  the  water\nsupply  components  will  adversely  affect  natural  or  cultural  resources  nor  sensitive  ecological\nzones, and no resettlement of residents is required by any of the activities.\n\n2.\n\nDesign Aspects\n\n9.\nThe overall effect of the proposed works will be to improve the quality and efficiency of\nwater service. The use of metering and consumption-based billing will encourage conservation\nby  users.  Water  quality  will  improve  as  a  result  of  improved  filtering  and  chlorination,  and  by\nreplacing  leaky  distribution  networks  to  reduce  infiltration  by  groundwater.  Improvement  of\ntesting  laboratories  in  the  vodokanals  (water  supply  agencies)  will  improve  their  capacity  to\nmonitor the quality of raw water and water supplied to the distribution network.\n\n10.\nThe  potential  health  hazards  from  spilled  chlorine  in  the  city  of  Djizzak,  where  existing\nboreholes and chlorination facilities are located within built-up urban areas, will be minimized by\nnot  stockpiling  chlorine  at  these  sites.  Chlorine-dosing  facilities  will  be  constructed  to  comply\nwith state planning and construction standards.\n\nThe  construction  of  pipe  networks  is  likely  to  cause  minor,  temporary  impacts  such  as\n11.\ntraffic  disruption,  and  potential  for  erosion  (silt  runoff)  at  excavation  and  trenching  sites\nHowever, these are routine problems that can be mitigated by construction management.\n\n3.\n\nConstruction\n\n4.\n\nOperations Stage\n\n12.\nImproved efficiency in all phases of service provision, combined with tariff reforms, will\nimprove  the  generation  of  revenues  to  sustain  the  service  at  the  improved  levels.  Where  new\nequipment is installed, training on operation and maintenance will be provided.\n\n5.\n\nEnvironmental Monitoring and Institutional Requirements\n\nEach of the utility agencies concerned will be required to assess environmental impacts\n13.\nof  the  project  physical  work,  and  to  prepare  the  statements  of  environmental  impacts  and\nconsequences  required  by  Uzbekistan  law.  The  works  proposed  are  similar  to  other  works\nconducted by the respective utility agencies, and their existing institutional capacity is adequate\nto prepare the required environmental impact assessments. No capacity building measures are\nneeded in this regard.\n\n\f55\n\nAppendix 11, page 3\n\nOnce  the  components  are  operational,  the  utility  agencies  will  need  to  monitor  water\n14.\nquality according to existing laws and regulations. The water agencies already routinely monitor\nwater  quality,  and  are  subject  to  quarterly  inspection  or  monitoring  by  the  Sanitary-\nEpidemeological Station, under the Ministry of Health. The water agencies have the equivalent\nof  a  department  for  safety  techniques  and  worker  protection,  charged  with  monitoring  and\nmitigating  hazardous  working  conditions.  The  designated  safety  officer  will  be  included  in\ntraining provided to operators of equipment under the Project.\n\n6.\n\nFindings and Recommendations\n\n15.\nNone  of  the  project  physical  components  will  cause  significant  environmental  impacts\nbased  on  the  screening  of  possible  environmental  consequences  using  ADB  checklists.  The\nwater supply project components will reduce per capita water consumption (and loss), and will\nreduce energy requirements by improving efficiency of equipment and distribution networks.\n\nThe  PIUs  should  each  make  one  staff  member  responsible  for  (i)  assuring  that  tender\n16.\nto  prevent  and  mitigate  adverse\nand  contract  documents  contain  binding  provisions \nenvironmental  impacts,  (ii)  assuring  that  the  implementing  utility  agencies  comply  with\nGovernment  environmental  impact  regulations  and  standards,  and  (iii)  monitor  and  report  on\nimpacts and compliance with the adopted environmental protection measures.\n\nE.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe  Project  will  have  no  significant  adverse  environmental  impact,  but  will  result  in\nis  not\n\nimprovements.  An  environmental \n\nimpact  assessment \n\n17.\nnumerous  environmental \nconsidered necessary.\n\n\f56\n\nAppendix 12, page 1\n\nA. \n\nIntroduction\n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS\n\nSocial  research  in  the  three  project  cities  focused  on  the  community  perception  of  the\n1. \ncurrent standards of drinking water and other communal services, its impact on their lives, and\nhow residents coped with the deficiencies. Special attention was given to gathering information\non  the  Project\u2019s  target  beneficiaries,  i.e.,  women  and  low-income  households,  as  well  as  on\neducation and medical services and small businesses, and on assessing the Project\u2019s impact on\nthese  beneficiaries.  The  research  comprised  (i)  a  random  statistical  household  sample  survey\ncarried out in February 2001, covering 1,500 households (500 per city); (ii) separate focus group\ndiscussions  with  low  income  men  and  women  focusing  on  poverty  issues;  (iii)  women\u2019s  focus\ngroups  on  gender  issues  relating  to  water  supply;  (iv)  a  random  selection  of  home  visits  in\nvarious  mahallas  (local  self-management  civil  committees)  in  each  city;  (v)  consultation  with\nteachers groups in all cities; (vi) visits to local doctors in their clinics and the city epidemiology\ndepartments;  (vii)  interviews  with  local  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  including  those\ninvolved  with  youth  and  the  disabled;  and  (viii)  in-depth  interviews  with  a  selection  of  water\nsensitive small and medium sized enterprises.\n\nB. \n\nBackground\n\n2. \nUzbekistan\u2019s population was estimated at 24.6 million in 2000 and is forecast to grow to\n28 million by 2010. Official projections show that the urban population will increase by 1 million\nover the next 10 years to reach 10.2 million. The national population structure is relatively young\nwith  around  41  percent  of  persons  under  15  years  of  age  and  4  percent  above  60  (1988\nfigures).  Population  growth  is  currently  outstripping  growth  in  employment  and  will  provide  a\nchallenge to the Government in future years. The incidence and extent of poverty has worsened\nsince  independence.  Per  capita  income  fell  by  approximately  24  percent  between  1991  and\n1996 and has not recovered in real terms. Inflation has affected families living on fixed incomes,\nparticularly  in  the  public  sector  where  wages  have  not  kept  pace  with  inflation.  Low-income\nfamilies  rely  on  strong  family  support  and  on  the  mahalla  benefits  system.  This  system  of\nneighborhood committees provides the basis for the administration of the Government\u2019s social\nwelfare  support  system.  Mahalla  officials  screen  families  according  to  officially  defined  criteria\nand  administer  welfare  payments  to  those  who  are  most  in  need.  On  health,  Uzbekistan\ninherited  an  outdated  health  system  from  Soviet  times,  and  although  significant  progress  has\nbeen  made  since  1991,  health  facilities  need  to  be  improved  to  meet  the  pressing  needs  of  a\ngrowing  population.  On  education,  Uzbekistan  had  97  percent  literacy  and  an  average  of  10\nyears  schooling  for  all  adults  over  25  at  the  time  of  independence.  However,  the  decrease  in\nbudget  allocation  for  education  has  meant,  among  others,  reduced  funding  for  school\nmaintenance.\n\n3. \nThese difficulties of the transition period have had a negative impact on the quality and\nscope of coverage of basic urban infrastructure services, especially in small towns, which have\nmore budgetary constraints. Frequent problems are experienced with drinking water supplies to\ndwellings,  schools,  clinics,  and  small  businesses.  Public  dissatisfaction  with  poorly  maintained\nwater supplies in the project cities, coupled with low income and affordability problems, means\nthat collection of payments is difficult.\n\n\f57\n\nAppendix 12, page 2\n\nC. \n\nProfile of Beneficiaries\n\n4. \nBased  on  the  results  of  the  social  survey  undertaken  in  February  2001,  the  average\nhousehold  income  per  month  in  the  three  cities  ranges  from  SUM7,400  to  SUM26,000  per\nmonth.  Household  sizes  in  the  project  cities  vary  significantly  between  extended  families  in\nhovles (traditional single-story private houses) and nuclear families in apartments. For example,\nin  Djizzak  households  in  hovles  averaged  5.42  persons  and  in  apartments  3.35  persons.  In\ngeneral, poor households comprise single elderly, elderly couples, unemployed, low-paid young\ncouples with children, and large extended families with few wage earners.\n\n5. \nWhen poverty is measured in terms of quality of life, such as vulnerability to water cuts\nand other service deficiencies, then the majority of the urban population is exposed to varying\ndegrees.  Only  29  percent  of  respondents  expressed  no  water  supply  problems.  While  poor\naccess  to  services  is  not  linked  to  housing  type  or  to  area,  households  living  in  hovles  have\ndirect  control  over  getting  plumbing  maintenance  and  may  also  benefit  from  sharing  facilities\nand  household  bills.  Households  living  in  apartments  above  the  second  floor  level  are\ncomparatively more vulnerable to water service and other problems. In general, the absorptive\ncapacities of apartment dwellers are less than that of those living in hovles. Households headed\nby women are more likely to live in apartments; extended family structures in hovles more often\nhave adult males who can generate income either on a formal or casual basis.\n\n6. \nThe  key  issue  is  whether  households  can  afford  to  pay  for  alternatives  to  mitigate  the\neffects of service deficiencies. Higher income families can minimize the amount of time spent on\ncollecting water by purchasing water pumps and storage tanks or paying for trucked delivery of\nwater.  Low-income  families,  in  particular  women,  cope  by  carrying  buckets  of  water  several\ntimes per day to their homes and often have to climb stairs when elevators are not functioning\nor working. In households headed by low-income elderly, sick, or disabled people, vulnerability\nis highest as they cannot carry heavy buckets and need to carry small amounts more frequently.\n\n7. \nSmall businesses such as restaurants, hair salons, and other personal services reported\nthat  their  turnover  is  highly  sensitive  to  water  supply  problems.  Schools  are  extremely\nvulnerable to service deficiencies. Lack of water severely affects hygiene leading to waterborne\ndiseases  and  hepatitis  outbreaks.  Many  low-income  households  cannot  afford  medical\ntreatment.  Clinics  are  unable  to  maintain  standards  of  hygiene  due  to  deficient  supply  of  safe\nwater.\n\nD. \n\nRole of Women\n\n8. \nWomen  are  affected  most  by  water  supply  and  other  service  problems,  since  they  are\nprimarily  responsible  for  cooking,  cleaning,  child  care,  and  taking  care  of  the  sick  and  elderly.\nThe high incidence of deficiencies in the drinking water systems in the project cities mean that\nwomen have to develop coping mechanisms to fulfil their traditional roles. Women in low-income\nfamilies are particularly vulnerable to service deficiencies as they have less money to purchase\nalternatives  such  as  bottled  water.  The  majority  of  teachers  in  the  three  project  cities  are\nwomen, who reported that schools are particularly affected by water supply deficiencies. Water\noften  has  to  be  collected  and  stored  during  lesson  times  so  that  at  meal  times  drinking  water\nsupplies and general hygiene can be maintained.\n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 12, page 3\n\nE. \n\nWater Sources and Availability\n\n9. \nWater  pressure  is  the  most  common  problem  where  water  cannot  reach  the  taps  in\nhouses and apartments. Households above the second floor in apartments and also hovles on\nhigh ground are most severely affected. Other problems include daily scheduled water cuts and\nfrequent  unscheduled  water  cuts,  often  for  two  to  three  days.  In  these  conditions,  households\nand  small  businesses  have  difficulty  maintaining  hygienic  practices.  Recent  medical  research\ncarried out by the Ministry of Health demonstrated the link between the incidence of typhoid and\nlow  pressure  in  water  pipes  (and  consequent  reflux),  water  losses  through  taps  and  leaking\npipes. All these conditions exist in the three project cities.\n\n10.  Many households living in apartments (62 percent in Djizzak, 47 percent in Gulistan, and\n23 percent in Karshi) said that they do not receive water from existing taps or standpipes inside\ntheir  homes.  A  smaller  proportion  of  households  living  in  hovles  (31  percent  in  Karshi,  18\npercent Gulistan, and 11 percent in Djizzak) also indicated they do not receive water from taps\nor standpipes within their homes or gardens. Household members (mainly women) have to find\nother sources such as standpipes in the street, from residents living at lower levels in apartment\nblocks  and  from  residents  living  in  low-level  hovles.  All  these  sources  are  also  subject  to\npressure  problems  and  therefore  not  constantly  available.  In  some  cases  local  factories  with\ntheir own boreholes and pumps sell water to households. In Karshi where some of the outlying\nmahallas have no water pipes, water is sometimes collected directly from boreholes or supplied\nby water tankers to those who can afford it.\n\nF. \n\nCommunity Structures and Social Support System\n\n11. \nThe  project  cities  are  divided  into  neighborhood  communities  administered  by  mahalla\ncommittees and headed by an aksakal  (chief elder). The mahalla system is a traditional Islamic\ncommunity-based  organization,  which  has  been  further  developed  by  the  Government  and  is\nnow organized into a hierarchy of committees at the oblast (region) and national levels. One of\nthe  key  responsibilities  of  the  mahalla  committees  is  to  administer  the  social  welfare  system\nwhereby low-income families can receive financial support (from which tariffs may be paid). The\nsystem tends to favor large families and elderly living alone and not all applicants from smaller\nhouseholds  are  able  to  obtain  assistance.  During  focus  group  discussions  some  respondents\nsaid that inflation had reduced the value of their subsidies.\n\n12. \nSocial  organization  and  group  formation  is  higher  among  hovle  dwellers  as  they  are\nmore likely to be Uzbeks and involved in mahalla activities. A small number of nongovernment\norganization activities are associated with the mahallas. Residents in apartment blocks have a\nvariety of ethnicity and comparatively less control over routine repairs to pipes. Some apartment\nblocks  have  formed  housing  partnerships  to  improve  their  conditions.  These  housing\npartnerships, which have the right to decide on building repair matters, have the potential to be\nused  as  a  basis  for  social  awareness  projects.  The  city  governments  also  have  women\u2019s\ncommittees who are responsible for women\u2019s development and welfare issues in the cities. The\nlevel of activity of these committees varies.\n\nG. \n\nPerceived Need for Services\n\n13. \nDissatisfaction  with  communal  services,  in  particular  water  supply,  is  widespread.  The\nfocus  groups  were  unanimous  in  responding  that  the  services  were  not  value  for  money.\nApartment dwellers are particularly vulnerable in that most of them are not in control of getting\n\n\f59\n\nAppendix 12, page 4\n\ntheir plumbing repairs done. The predominant reason for dissatisfaction was the irregularity of\nsupply and the second reason was the low water pressure. The problems are worse in summer.\n\n14.  Women  are  significantly  disadvantaged  by  the  water  supply  deficiencies  in  the  three\nproject  cities.  About  70  percent  of  households  surveyed  have  to  carry  water  from  sources\noutside  their  homes,  often  walking  considerable  distances  several  times  per  day.  The  mean\ndistance  is  about  260  meters.  Moreover,  93  percent  of  these  women  do  not  use  any  form  of\ntransport, although children often assist them. Of those who make trips, the average amount of\ntime spent per trip is 25 minutes with an average of 3.1 trips per day. Over one third of these\nspend between 26 and 150 minutes per day fetching water. The average time spent per day is\n43  minutes  in  winter  and  84  minutes  in  summer.  The  vast  majority  of  women  said  that  they\ncould not afford to pay for water from trucks and have to make more frequent journeys. Sick and\ndisabled people and pregnant women are particularly vulnerable, particularly when they have to\nwalk up to the apartments.\n\nH. \n\nWillingness to Pay\n\n15. \nBased on the household survey results, the proportion of respondents willing to pay for\nan  improved  water  supply  is  88  percent  in  Djizzak,  80  percent  in  Gulistan,  and  77  percent  in\nKarshi. Willingness to pay is often not only linked to income level. Although 15.4 percent of all\nhouseholds in the survey indicate they are not willing to pay, and 51 percent of these are poor\nhouseholds, a significant proportion of other poor households of various sizes are willing to pay\nhigher amounts. About 45 percent of the households surveyed are poor and are willing to pay\nSUM500  per  month  for  water.  This  indicates  that  a  significant  proportion  of  poor  households\nconsider a safe regular supply of drinking water to be a priority. Feedback from the focus groups\nof  low-income  residents  showed  that  they  were  unanimously  in  favor  of  having  water  meters\nbecause they believed that this would demonstrate their low level of consumption and therefore\nenable them to control and reduce their bills.\n\nI. \n\nSocial Impact\n\n16. \nThe  provision  of  safe  drinking  water  continuously  throughout  the  day  will  have  a\nsignificant positive impact on the lives of people in all income groups, and in particular women\nand  the  poor.  Public  health  will  be  improved  and  indirectly  income  spent  on  medical  services,\nand school days and workdays lost due to sickness related to waterborne and related diseases\nwill  be  reduced.  The  benefits  will  be  enhanced  with  the  implementation  of  health  awareness\nprograms under the Project. Project benefits will be enhanced by encouraging small businesses\nto undertake plumbing repair. Children will be able to maximize the use of their school facilities\nin winter and treatment facilities in hospitals and clinics for patients will be improved.\n\n\f60\n\nAppendix 13, page 1\n\nADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR\nCAPACITY BUILDING FOR URBAN WATER SUPPLY\n\nA. \n\nObjective and Scope\n\n1. \nReforms  undertaken  by  the  Government  of  Uzbekistan  include  decentralization  of\nfunctions and some infrastructure and assets from the Uzbekistan Communal Services Agency\n(\u201cUzcommunkhizmat\u201d)  (UCSA)  to  oblasts  (provinces)  and  cities.  At  the  same  time  the\nGovernment recognizes the need to set tariffs for utilities and services at a level that will ensure\nthe  services  can  be  sustained.  The  Urban  Water  Supply  Project  supports  the  Government's\ninstitutional  reform  policy  and  includes  the  principles  of  full  cost  recovery  and  stakeholder\nparticipation in project implementation.\n\n2. \nThe main objective of the advisory technical assistance (TA) is to strengthen the sector\ninstitutions  and  train  concerned  staff  at  various  levels  of  government  in  appropriate\nmanagement systems for delivering sustainable urban infrastructure services. The TA will help\nstrengthen the capacity of the central and local governments and concerned utility agencies to\nmanage  water  supply  facilities  and  services,  and  will  improve  the  capacity  of  local  training\ninstitutions  and  organizations  to  deliver  the  training  needed  for  the  planning,  operation,  and\nmaintenance  of  water  supply  systems.  The  TA  will  also  initiate  systems  for  involving  the\ncommunity  in  the  planning  of  the  services  to  be  provided  by  mobilizing  and  training\nnongovernment organizations and community-based organizations to undertake this work under\nthe Project. The services provided under the TA will encompass (i) international and domestic\nconsulting  services;  (ii)  training  of  local  government  staff,  vodokanal  staff,  and  community\nleaders; and (iii) establishment of a training center where training activities can be coordinated\nand provided.\n\nB. \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan\n\n4. \nThe cost of the TA is estimated at $860,000 equivalent, of which $513,500 will be foreign\nexchange  cost  and  $346,500  the  local  currency  cost.  Of  this,  $600,000  equivalent  will  be\nfinanced by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund,\nfinanced by the Government of Japan. The ADB financing will cover the entire foreign exchange\ncost and $86,500 equivalent of local currency cost. The Government will finance the remaining\n$260,000  equivalent  of  local  currency  costs.  The  estimated  costs  and  financing  plan  are  in\nTable A13.\n\nC. \n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n5. \nThe Uzbekistan Communal Services Agency (UCSA), the Executing Agency of the TA,\nwill supervise the implementation of the TA to maximize the use of TA findings in promoting a\ndecentralized  and  community-based  approach  to  water  and  heating  infrastructure  planning,\ndevelopment,  operation,  and  management.  The  TA  will  be  carried  out  over  seven  months,\ncommencing  in  the  second  month  of  loan  effectiveness.

The  analysis  compares  the\ncalculated  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  for  the  Project  and  each  component  to  the\neconomic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  (EOCC),  which  is  assumed  to  be  12  percent.1  Standard\nand  project-specific  sensitivity  tests  were  undertaken  to  assess  the  robustness  of  the  EIRR\ncalculation.  The  analysis  uses  the  domestic  price  numeraire,  as  benefits  are  nontradable  in\nnature. The analysis was done in constant 2001 prices.\n\nB. \n\nEconomic Rationale and Without-Project Situation\n\n3.\nUrban  infrastructure  services  in  the  project  cities  are  inadequate.  Assets  have\ndeteriorated and lack of maintenance is such that service delivery of water in the three project\ncities is severely affected. Without major investment in the near future the central water supply\nwill  continue  to  deteriorate  rapidly,  with  serious  consequences  for  economic  activity  and\nlivelihood.  Currently,  water  rationing  occurs  in  all  three  cities.  Water  shortages,  cuts  and\npressure  problems  mean  that  only  about  60  percent  of  the  population  receive  some  water\neveryday.  Without  the  Project,  by  2007,  the  water  supply  systems  in  Djizzak  and  Karshi  will\nlikely fail to supply even basic water requirements and 30 percent of the population will not have\naccess to a piped water supply. This proportion of households without access to a piped water\nsupply  is  expected  to  gradually  increase,  until  total  failure  of  the  system,  which  is  expected\nwithin  15  years.  In  Gulistan,  the  situation  is  even  more  severe,  where  without  the  Project,  by\n2007,  100  percent  of  households  will  be  without  access  to  a  piped  water  supply,  since  total\nfailure of the system is expected within 5 years. The Project is considered high priority by the\nGovernment, is timely, and is well integrated with other investment activity.\n\n4.\nThe  water  supply  components  will  (i)  generate  major  efficiency  gains,  reducing\ndistribution  leakage,  water,  and  electricity  costs;  (ii)  improve  cost  recovery  through  better\ncustomer satisfaction with service delivery; (iii) reduce natural resource depletion; (iv) improve\npublic  health  by  reducing  the  incidence  of  waterborne  disease;  and  (v)  support  economic\nrecovery. Unaccounted for water will be reduced from an estimated more than 40 percent, to a\ntarget of 30 percent in 2007.\n\nC. \n\nProject Description and Beneficiaries\n\n5.\nThe  Project  will  benefit  about  484,000  residential  water  supply  customers,  industries,\nsmall  businesses,  and  other  organizations  in  the  three  cities.  Access  to  a  clean,  safe,  and\nreliable  water  supply  system  will  benefit  poor  and  nonpoor  alike  since  they  are  not\ngeographically separated and all households will have access to the improved system.\n\n1 ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects, Manila.\n\n                  \n\n\f64\n\nAppendix 14, page 2\n\nThe Project\u2019s physical works mainly involve rehabilitation of existing assets and, where\n6.\nidentified  as  necessary,  new  assets  including  boreholes,  distribution  centers,  pipe  networks,\ntrunk mains, and metering of all residential houses and apartment blocks. The Project will also\nprovide  technical  assistance  and  capacity  building,  including  software  and  training  for\nmonitoring and control; improvements to financial management, billing, and collection systems;\nand education and awareness for customers. A consumer committee will also be set up in each\nproject  city  to  help  the  water  utility  agency  develop  a  customer-oriented  service  and  improve\ncustomer satisfaction. Specific service delivery targets for water supply and water quality have\nbeen agreed with the Government.\n\nD. \n\nAnalysis of Alternatives\n\nAn analysis of alternatives was undertaken. In Djizzak, no alternative source is available\n7.\nin  the  short  to  medium  term,  since  the  only  alternative  water  source  from  the  Zarafshan  river\nscheme  will  not  be  available  within  the  time  frame  of  this  Project.  In  Gulistan,  two  specific\nalternatives  were  considered,  including  total  reliance  on  the  borehole  field  at  Dehkanabad\n(under  the  responsibility  of  Uzbekistan  Communal  Services  Agency)  and  total  reliance  on\nborehole  fields  under  the  responsibility  of  the  city  vodokanal.  However,  both  alternatives  are\nabout  10  percent  more  expensive  and  the  chosen  scheme  is  more  acceptable  in  terms  of\nimplementation. In Karshi, the unit costs of the chosen scheme were about 10 percent cheaper\nthan the next best alternative. The consideration of alternative sources was strengthened by the\nchoice of the most cost-effective rehabilitation of the distribution system. Only items that were\nconsidered essential for establishing a sustainable system were included in the project design.\n\nE. \n\nEconomic Costs\n\n8.\nEconomic  costs  exclude  taxes,  and  financial  prices  are  converted  to  economic  prices\nusing  conversion  factors.  The  shadow  exchange  rate  factor  (SERF)  was  assumed  to  be  2.0\nbased on the existing relationship between the commercial rate and the estimated SERF.2 Since\nthe SERF is a key input into the analysis, tests were undertaken to assess the sensitivity of the\nProject to changes in the SERF. The conversion factor for labor was assumed to be 0.8, since\nthere  is  excess  employment  in  communal  services  for  both  skilled  and  unskilled  staff.\nConsiderable savings are made in operational costs under the Project, due to efficiency gains,\nbut  these  savings  are  offset  by  increases  in  maintenance  expenditure.  The  incremental\neconomic costs are phased over the planning period of the Project, assumed to be 20 years.\n\nF. \n\nEconomic Benefits\n\n9.\nFor  water  supply  components,  valued  economic  benefits  comprised  benefits  to\nresidents, businesses, and other organizations. Nonincremental benefits were valued using the\nresource cost savings approach for (i) use of bottled water, (ii) time savings for water collection,\n(iii)  costs  to  large  industry,  and  (iv)  savings  in  health  expenditure.  Incremental  benefits  were\nvalued using (i) willingness to pay and (ii) output of small businesses. Values for bottled water\nconsumption  were  based  on  the  cost  of  bottled  water  for  a  minimum  drinking  requirement  but\nonly for the highest 10 percent income group. Time savings for water collection and willingness\nto  pay  were  based  on  the  social  survey.  The  estimated  lost  output  to  small  businesses  was\nbased on a qualitative survey and local output data. The costs to larger industries were based\non  the  costs  of  extracting  alternative  water  supplies  or  lost  output.  Health  benefits  were\n\n                  \n\n2 The SERF was calculated based on the weighted average of the three exchange rates existing in Uzbekistan: the\n\nofficial rate, the commercial rate, and the market rate; and the estimated volume of transactions at each rate.\n\n\f65\n\nAppendix 14, page 3\n\ncalculated  based  on  the  avoided  treatment  costs,  using  international  agency  research  in\nUzbekistan  on  the  impact  of  water  supply  improvements  on  the  incidence  of  five  leading\nwaterborne diseases and the cost of medical supplies from local pharmacies.\n\nG. \n\nResults\n\n10.\nIn  each  of  the  three  cities,  the  EIRR  exceeded  the  EOCC,  which  is  assumed  to  be  12\npercent.  Sensitivity  tests  were  undertaken  to  consider  the  impact  of  economic  risks.  Standard\nsensitivity tests were taken at 20 percent, higher than the standard rate of 10 percent, to reflect\nthe  higher  level  of  risk  associated  with  this  Project.  Switching  values  and  sensitivity  indicators\nwere  also  calculated.  Under  the  standard  sensitivity  tests,  even  under  the  most  adverse\nscenarios, the project components were found to be economically viable.\n\n11.\nThree  additional  project-specific  sensitivity  tests  were  undertaken.  The  first  sensitivity\ntest  increased  the  value  of  the  SERF  to  reflect  the  difference  between  the  current  market\nexchange rate and the official rate. In all the cities, the EIRR exceeded the EOCC. A switching\nvalue  was  also  calculated  for  the  SERF  to  test  the  robustness  of  the  assumption.  The  results\nshowed that the SERF would have to exceed four (or increase by 100 percent) for the EIRR to\nfall  below  the  EOCC.  The  second  sensitivity  test  assumed  that  the  number  of  people  using\nbottled  water  was  halved.  Again,  the  EIRR  remained  above  the  EOCC  in  each  of  the  cities.\nFinally,  an  examination  of  the  operation  and  maintenance  costs  was  undertaken.  Since  there\nare  major  operational  cost  efficiencies  under  the  Project,  the  incremental  operation  and\nmaintenance costs of the Project are relatively low and thus even relatively large changes in key\noperational costs made little impact on the incremental operation and maintenance costs used\nin the analysis. A sensitivity test was undertaken assuming a 50 percent increase in operation\nand  maintenance  costs.  In  all  cities  the  EIRR  remained  well  above  the  EOCC.  Table  A14\nsummarizes the results.\n\nTable A14: Economic Internal Rate of Return Analysis and Sensitivity Tests\n\nItem\nBase case\nCosts increase by 20%\nBenefits decrease by 20%\nCosts increase by 20%, benefits decrease by 20%\nBenefits delayed by one year\nShadow exchange rate factor at 2.6\nOperations and maintenance costs increase by 50%\nPopulation using bottled water reduce by 50%\nSwitching value \u2013 cost increase\nSwitching value \u2013 benefit decrease\n\nDjizzak\n18.2%\n15.8%\n15.3%\n13.2%\n16.1%\n15.9%\n18.0%\n14.2%\n66.0%\n40.0%\n\nGulistan\n17.2%\n14.8%\n14.3%\n12.0%\n15.2%\n15.0%\n16.8%\n14.1%\n50.0%\n34.0%\n\nKarshi\n24.4%\n21.6%\n21.0%\n18.4%\n21.4%\n21.4%\n24.2%\n21.2%\n145.0%\n59.0%\n\nSource: Staff estimates.\n\nH. \n\nConclusion\n\nThe project components are economically viable and stand up to adverse cost and\n\n12.\nbenefit scenarios. The calculated EIRR is expected to be lower than the true EIRR since the\neconomic implications of not undertaking the Project are severe.\n\n\f66\n\nAppendix 15, page 1\n\nA. \n\nIntroduction, Background, and Scope\n\nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS\n\nThe financial analysis is undertaken in accordance with Asian Development Bank (ADB)\n1. \nguidelines,  including  the  Framework  for  the  Economic  and  Financial  Appraisal  of  Urban\nDevelopment  Sector  Projects  and  Handbook  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Water  Supply\nProjects.\n\n2. \nDjizzak,  Gulistan,  and  Karshi  vodokanals  (city  water  supply  agencies)  are  the\nimplementing agencies for the water supply component. In line with recent government policies,\nwhich  have  decentralized  responsibility  for  water  supply,  city  vodokanals  are  responsible  for\nwater  supply  and  sanitation  in  their  respective  cities.  Government  policy  has  also  promoted\nmarket  principles  in  the  provision  of  communal  services,  and  vodokanals  are  currently  self-\nfinancing institutions, with revenues coming from user charges rather than government subsidy.\n\nHowever, the current financial situation of the vodokanals is poor. Although tariffs have\n3. \nincreased  in  recent  years,  the  vodokanals  suffer  from  low  and  falling  collection  rates,  rising\nexpenditure  requirements,  and  cash  flow  problems.  Without  the  Project,  the  vodokanals  will\ncontinue  to  be  unable  to  provide  an  adequate  water  supply  service,  and  as  service  delivery\ndeteriorates further, their already poor financial situation is likely to get worse. The Project will\nstop the downward spiral of poor service delivery, aging assets, and poor collection rates, and\nwill enable the vodokanals to become fully self-financing and sustainable water utilities.\n\nThe financial analysis calculates tariffs required for cost recovery, undertakes a financial\n4. \nappraisal  of  each  city  project  component,  and  provides  financial  projections  for  the  three\nvodokanals.\n\nB.\n\nTariff Setting and Cost Recovery\n\n5. \nIn accordance with the recommended criteria of the Government and ADB, tariffs have\nbeen  estimated  based  on  the  principle  of  full  cost  recovery  from  user  charges,  such  that  no\nlong-term  subsidies  are  required.  Tariff  estimates  are  based  on  the  proposed  project\nimplementation  arrangements,  which  will  introduce  metered  charges,  by  volume,  for  all  water\nusers, including residential customers by 2007.\n\nTariffs  cover  operational  expenditure,  maintenance,  depreciation,  and  interest  on  the\n6. \nADB loan. Since the vodokanals will be entering into subloan agreements under which they will\nbe  required  to  repay  the  ADB  loan  at  the  prevailing  commercial  exchange  rate,  the  burden  of\nany  further  devaluation  of  the  commercial  exchange  rate  will  be  borne  by  water  users.  The\nrequired tariff will increase as the currency rate depreciates. The calculation of tariffs assumes\nthat  the  commercial  exchange  rate  will  depreciate  from  around  SUM690  to  $1  to  around\nSUM1,100 to $1, by the end of the construction period.1\n\nEstimates  of  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  consider  improvements  in\n7. \nefficiency,  particularly  in  the  use  of  electricity,  volume  of  water  produced,  and  specific\nmaintenance  requirements  for  the  facilities  created  under  the  Project  and  existing  assets.\nConsumption is based on estimated daily consumption for apartment residents, private houses,\n\n                                                \n1 The  currency  depreciation  assumes  purchasing  power  parity,  such  that  the  currency  depreciates  in  line  with  the\n\ndifference between international and domestic inflation.\n\n\f67\n\nAppendix 15, page 2\n\ncommunal services, and budget organizations. Industrial consumption is assumed to increase to\nthe levels before independence. Unaccounted for water is assumed to reduce from the current\nrate of more than 40 percent to 30 percent. The tariff collection rate is assumed to be 65 percent\nin  the  early  years  after  project  completion,  rising  to  75  percent  by  2010,  a  considerable\nimprovement  on  the  existing  collection  rates,  which  are  between  30  and  50  percent.  The\nimprovement  in  collection  rates  is  reasonable  since  under  the  Project,  cost  recovery  will  be\nassisted  through  improved  service  delivery,  efficiency  gains  in  water  production,  better\nstructuring  of  tariffs  so  as  to  be  more  affordable,  more  transparent  billing,  the  consumer\ncommittees,  and  the  education  and  awareness  campaign.  The  collection  rate  is  an  important\nconsideration, which is not included in the tariff calculations currently undertaken by the utilities.\n\n8. \nProposed  average  tariffs  per  cubic  meter  in  2007  in  constant  prices  are  SUM103  in\nDjizzak, SUM119 in Gulistan, and SUM95 in Karshi, (equivalent to about $0.14 to $0.17 at the\ncommercial exchange rate). Karshi is the largest city and gains from economies of scale when\ncompared with Gulistan,  the smallest city. Since existing tariffs are not  charged by volume for\nresidential  customers,  existing  and  proposed  tariffs  cannot  be  compared.  Comparisons  of\nexisting and proposed household charges are shown in the affordability analysis.\n\n9. \nSince required tariff levels are sensitive to changes in production, losses, consumption,\ncollection  rates,  actual  costs,  and  inflation  among  other  factors,  tariff  reviews  must  take  place\nregularly,  and  appropriate  tariffs  implemented,  both  during  project  construction  and  beyond\n2007.  In  particular,  the  implication  of  the  vodokanals  bearing  the  foreign  exchange  risk  is  that\ntariffs  will  need  to  increase  to  meet  loan  repayments  if  the  commercial  exchange  rate\ndepreciates further than anticipated.\n\nB. \n\nFinancial Appraisal\n\n10. \nProject financial appraisal was undertaken for each city, comparing the financial internal\nrate  of  return  (FIRR)2  with  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC);  and  the  average\nincremental  cost  to  the  average  incremental  revenue.  Sensitivity  tests  were  undertaken,  to\nassess  the  impact  of  cost  increases,  revenue  decreases,  construction  delays,  and  a  currency\ndepreciation on the FIRR. Switching values and sensitivity indicators were also calculated. The\nappraisal is undertaken in 2001 prices.\n\n11. \nThe  WACC  is  calculated  based  on  the  cost  of  borrowing  from  ADB  and  counterpart\nfunds.  The  cost  of  ADB  funds  are  calculated  at  6.7  percent  and  discounted  at  international\ninflation  of  2.4  percent.  The  local  counterpart  funds  are  assumed  to  reflect  an  equity\ncontribution. The cost of counterpart funds is assumed to be 6 percent over the rate of inflation\nin line with government rates for long-term lending. The WACC is 5.0 percent.\n\nProject capital expenditure is included in line with the implementation schedule, including\n12. \nphysical  contingencies  of  10  percent  for  all  items.  Replacement  costs  are  included  for  meters\nand chlorination units after 10 years, and control equipment every 5 years. O&M costs include\nonly the additional costs incurred under the Project.\n\n13. \nRevenues are additional user charges attributed to the Project. Revenues are based on\nthe required average tariff, actual water consumption, and a collection rate of 65 percent. Tariffs\nare  assumed  to  stay  constant  in  real  terms  after  2007  but  revenues  increase  slightly  due  to\nincreases in water consumed.\n\n                                                \n2 The FIRR calculation uses project capital costs and additional O&M costs associated with the Project.\n\n\f68\n\nAppendix 15, page 3\n\nThe FIRRs are 9.5 percent in Djizzak, 9.5 percent in Gulistan, and 8.4 percent in Karshi.\n14. \nAll exceed the WACC, which is about 5.0 percent, demonstrating that at proposed tariff levels\nthe project components are financially viable (Table A15.1).\n\nStandard  sensitivity  tests  were  undertaken  and  consideration  was  given  to  key\n15. \nassumptions  in  the  analysis.  Revenue  is  the  most  sensitive  factor  in  the  analysis,  and  an\nadditional  sensitivity  test  was  undertaken  for  a  20  percent  decrease  in  revenue.  The  city\ncomponents  were  found  to  be  financially  viable  under  all  the  adverse  cost  and  revenue\nscenarios. Detailed calculations and sensitivity tests on the FIRR are shown in a supplementary\nappendix.\n\nTable A15.1: Water Supply, Proposed Tariffs, and Summary FIRR Results\n\nItem\n\nDjizzak\n\nGulistan\n\nKarshi\n\n103\n5.0%\n9.5%\n8.5%\n8.4%\n7.4%\n\nAverage required tariff\nWACC\nFIRR\nCosts increase by 10 percent\nRevenues decrease by 10 percent\nCosts increase and revenues decrease\nby 10 percent\nRevenues decrease by 20 percent\nRevenues delayed by 1 year\nCurrency depreciation of 30 percent\nCosts increase \u2013 switching value\nRevenue decrease \u2013 switching value\nCurrency depreciation \u2013 switching value\nFIRR = financial internal rate of return, WACC = weighted average cost of capital.\nSource: Staff estimates.\n\n7.2%\n8.3%\n8.3%\n55%\n35%\n138%\n\n119\n5.0%\n9.5%\n8.4%\n8.3%\n7.2%\n\n6.9%\n8.2%\n8.2%\n48%\n32%\n120%\n\nC.\n\nFinancial Projections\n\n95\n5.0%\n8.4%\n7.4%\n7.3%\n6.2%\n\n6.0%\n7.3%\n7.2%\n37%\n27%\n95%\n\nDetailed financial projections up to 2015 have been prepared for the Djizzak, Gulistan,\n16. \nand  Karshi  city  vodokanals.  Projections  for  vodakanals  cover  water  supply  and  sanitation\noperations. The projected financial statements are in current prices that include inflation in each\nyear.  International  inflation  is  assumed  to  be  2.4  percent  per  annum.  Domestic  inflation  is\nassumed to be 20 percent for 2001, 15 percent for 2002, and 10 percent thereafter.\n\n17. \nUnder  the  proposed  project  implementation  arrangements,  fixed  assets  created  under\nthe  Project  will  be  transferred  to  the  vodokanals  during  project  implementation  and  the\nvodokanals will undertake a subsidiary loan agreement with the Executing Agency to repay the\nADB loan. For the purposes of the analysis, assets are valued using the commercial exchange\nrate  and  are  assumed  to  accumulate  as  work  in  progress  in  line  with  the  implementation\nschedule.  The  currency  is  expected  to  devalue  over  the  construction  period  of  the  Project  to\naround  SUM1,100  by  2007.  Since  currency  movements  after  2007  cannot  be  predicted,  the\nexchange  rate  is  assumed  to  stay  constant,  such  that  the  ADB  debt  service  in  sum  terms\nremains equal over the repayment period. In reality, since the loan repayment is fixed in dollars,\nif  the  exchange  rate  moves  significantly,  then  tariffs  will  need  to  be  adjusted  to  take  the\nexchange rate movement into account.\n\n\f69\n\nAppendix 15, page 4\n\nThe opening balance is based on balance sheets provided by the vodakanals for 2000.\n18. \nFixed assets are very low since assets are old and have been almost fully depreciated. Where\nthe balance sheet provided did not balance, an appropriate adjustment was made.\n\nProject  fixed  assets  are  depreciated  at  a  rate  of  2.5  percent  per  annum  for  pipe\n19. \nnetworks,  10  percent  for  meters,  and  5.0  percent  for  other  assets,  on  a  declining  balance.\nAccounts payable represent 10 percent of operating expenses. Seventy percent of additions to\naccounts payable are paid in the following year.\n\n20. \nLong-term  debt  is  the  ADB  loan  from  ordinary  capital  reserves.  Since  the  margin  for\nonlending  is  not  decided  and  will  be  small,  the  ADB  loan  is  assumed  to  be  onlent  to  the\nvodokanals  at  the  same  terms,  including  an  interest  rate  of  6.7  percent  per  annum,  a\ncommitment charge of 0.75 percent, and a 1 percent front-end fee. Nonoperational revenue is\nassumed to be zero.\n\nThe value added tax is calculated at an average of 15 percent on actual income. Profit\n\n21. \ntax is assumed to be 18 percent in line with government requirements.\n\n22. \nThe collection rate is assumed to be 65 percent rising to 75 percent by 2010. Revenues\nnot  collected  are  written  off,  thus  the  allowance  for  doubtful  debts  represents  35  percent  of\ncurrent period debit falling to 25 percent.\n\n23. \nRevenue for the years to 2006 is based on actual current income, increasing at a rate of\nabout 15 percent a year. Although tariffs are assumed to increase over the period, since service\ndelivery will not be improved substantially until the Project is almost completed, collection rates\nare  not  expected  to  improve  until  the  latter  years  of  project  implementation.  The  increase  in\nrevenue  in  2007  is  therefore  the  result  of  improvements  in  collection  rates,  rather  than\nsubstantive increases in tariffs.\n\n24. \nExpenditures  are  expected  to  stay  the  same  in  real  terms  until  2007.  From  2007  fixed\nand  variable  costs  for  water  are  calculated  based  on  production  volume.  Expenditure  on\nsanitation  is  assumed  to  stay  the  same  in  real  terms.  Detailed  assumptions  of  unit  cost  rates\nand calculation of O&M costs is included in Supplementary Appendix C.\n\n25. \nIn  the  years  to  2007,  because  of  inadequate  actual  income,  the  vodokanals  are\nexpected to continue to experience cash flow problems. This scenario is thought to be realistic,\ngiven the inadequate service provision of the vodokanal and the inability to charge for a service\nif none is provided. While the situation under the Project will not suddenly improve in year 2007,\nit is prudent to assume that revenue streams will not improve until after project completion.\n\nIn  Gulistan,  Uzbekistan  Communal  Services  Agency  will  own  and  operate  some  of  the\n26. \nassets  created  under  the  Project.  However,  for  the  purposes  of  the  financial  projections  and\nanalysis, assets are recorded as part of the vodokanal.\n\nBy 2007, the vodokanals run at a moderate profit and show reasonable financial ratios.\n27. \nKey financial ratios are shown in Supplementary Appendix C, Table SAC.7. The return on net\nassets  in  the  early  years  is  very  low  since  the  value  of  net  assets  is  very  high  in  relation  to\noperations  of  the  vodokanal,  as  would  be  expected  in  a  utility  that  undertakes  significant\ninvestment in very long-term assets. When compared with net operational income, profit levels\nin the early years are around 10 to 15 percent.\n\n\f70\n\nAppendix 15, page 5\n\nDebt service ratios exceed 1.2. However, as discussed, if the exchange rate depreciates\n28. \nfurther  than  anticipated,  the  debt  service  obligations  of  the  vodokanals  will  rise.  Particularly\nsince revenue is dependent on collecting tariffs from residents and businesses, the actual debt\nservice requirement is critical to the financial performance and sustainability of the vodokanal.\nUnification  of  the  currency  appears  likely  in  the  early  years  of  implementation.  Since  the\nanalysis is done at the commercial exchange rate, this is taken into consideration. The analysis\nalso  takes  into  consideration  a  considerable  further  depreciation  of  the  commercial  exchange\nrate. However, given the inability to predict the volatility of exchange rates, very large currency\nmovements cannot be assumed. If debt service requirements are much higher than anticipated,\nthen  tariffs  need  to  be  adjusted  accordingly.  The  Government  has  agreed  that  tariffs  should\nadjust  to  take  account  of  debt  service  requirements.  In  addition,  the  Government  has  agreed\nthat  in  the  unlikely  event  that  the  vodokanal  cannot  meet  O&M  costs  and  debt  service\nobligations, then the O&M assets will be given first priority in order to safeguard service delivery\nand sustainability of the water supply system.\n\n29. \nBased  on  the  data  available  and  the  assumptions  set  out,  after  project  completion  the\nperformance of the vodokanals is shown to be truly self financing, with income covering realistic\nand  adequate  maintenance  and  repair  to  keep  assets  in  good  order,  provide  for  depreciation,\nand run at a small profit. Under these conditions, the vodokanals appear to be sustainable in the\nlong term. Summary ratios are shown in Table A15.2. Detailed analysis and financial statements\nare shown in a supplementary appendix.\n\nTable A15.2: Vodokanals, Key Ratios 2007\n\nItem\nDebt service ratio\nCurrent ratio\nDebt to equity ratio\nRate of return on net assets\n\nDjizzak\n1.5\n7.2\n1.4\n2%\n\nGulistan\n1.5\n4.1\n1.9\n2%\n\nKarshi\n1.5\n3.9\n2.0\n2%\n\n\f71\n\nAppendix 16, page 1\n\nAFFORDABILITY ANALYSIS\n\nA. \n\nIntroduction\n\n1. \nAn  affordability  analysis  has  been  undertaken  to  assess  whether  the  Project  is\naffordable to residential customers, based on estimated tariffs and household income data from\nthe  social  survey.  In  line  with  ADB  practice,  tariffs  are  considered  to  be  affordable  if  they  fall\nbelow 5 percent of monthly household income. Since metered charging will be introduced under\nthe  Project,  a  tariff  structure  was  prepared  for  each  city  using  a  residential  tariff  stepped  by\nvolume and cross-subsidization of residential customers to increase affordability.\n\nB.\n\nTariff Structure and Affordability\n\nis  not  recommended.  Continued  cross-subsidization  of  residential  customers \n\nProposed  average  tariffs  are  calculated  using  the  principle  of  full  cost  recovery.\n2. \nHowever, since affordability of tariffs is a critical issue in project towns, a flat unit charge for all\nusers \nis\npreferable. In addition, once meters are installed, charging residential customers by volume but\nstepping  tariffs  according  to  volume  is  both  possible  and  recommended.1  This  will  encourage\ndemand  management  and  appropriate  water  use,  and  reduce  wastage.  Setting  a  low  tariff  for\nlow  consumption  is  termed  a  \u201clifeline\u201d  tariff  as  it  assists  those  with  low  income  to  have  a\nsubsistence  consumption  of  water  at  a  subsidized  and  affordable  price.  Unfortunately  in  the\nproject  cities  the  advantage  of  a  lifeline  tariff  for  different  customers  is  affected  by  the  lack  of\nindividual meters for apartments, within apartment blocks. This affects up to half the residential\npopulation. However, since apartment blocks are metered and the number of families in each is\ngenerally not too large, volume tariff structuring is considered to be useful although some of the\nbenefits will not be realized.\n\n3. \nThe tariff structure includes for residential customers: a lifeline tariff set at 75 liters per\ncapita per day (lcd), a tariff for consumption between 75 lcd and 125 lcd, and a higher tariff for\nconsumption  over  125  lcd.  Tariffs  for  industrial  and  other  users  are  higher  than  the  tariffs  for\nresidential users.\n\n4. \nA detailed comparison of existing and proposed charges for a variety of residential water\nconsumption  levels  is  shown  in  Table  A16.  Charges  are  also  shown  as  a  proportion  of\nhousehold  incomes.  The  household  charge  for  average  water  consumption  satisfies  ADB\ncriteria since it accounts for a maximum of 5 percent of average household income. For those\nwith  the  lowest  incomes,  the  water  charge  is  lower  than  5  percent  of  income  if  water\nconsumption is constrained to around or just above the lifeline consumption level.\n\n5. \nThe household survey showed that about 80 percent of respondents were willing to pay\nfor water supply improvements. Of those respondents who were willing to pay, the average was\nabout SUM1,000 per household per month. Proposed household charges are below this level.\n\n6. \nProposed  nonresidential  tariffs  in  the  same  range  of  SUM150  to  SUM190  per  cubic\nmeter.  In  Djizzak  and  Karshi,  this  represents  increases  of  about  three  and  four  times\nrespectively.  However,  in  Gulistan  these  levels  represent  a  large  increase  compared  with  the\ncurrent  tariff  since  current  tariffs  are  very  low  compared  with  the  other  cities.  The  analysis\nshows  that  to  keep  the  residential  tariffs  below  5  percent  of  income,  then  required  tariff\nincreases remain affordable in Djizzak and Karshi but are only marginally affordable in Gulistan.\n\n                                                \n1 At this stage, a more detailed stepped tariff structure cannot be designed, because until meters are installed, no\ninformation  is  available  on  the  distribution  and  range  of  residential  water  consumption.  Once  metered  volumes\nbecome available this demand information should be used to assist in designing an appropriate tariff structure.\n\n\fTable A16:  Tariff Structure and Affordability\n\nExample \nProposed    \nWater Charge \nper Capita    \n\n(SUM/month)\n\nExample \nProposed   \nWater Charge \nper HH   \n(SUM/month)\n\nExample \nProposed \nWater Charge \nas % of \nExisting Water \nCharge\n\nLowest \nDecile HH \nIncome per \nMonth\n\nExample \nProposed  \nWater \nCharge % of \nLowest \nDecile HH \nIncome \n\nLowest \nQuintile HH \nIncome per \nMonth\n\nWater \nCharge % of \nLowest \nQuintile HH \nIncome \n\nAverage \nHH Income \nper Month\n\nWater \nCharge % \nof Average \nHH Income \n\nExisting Charge \nper Capita \n(SUM/month)\n\nExisting \nCharge per HH \n(SUM/month)\n\nIndependent of consumption\n\n396\n396\n396\n396\n396\n396\n\n418\n418\n418\n418\n418\n418\n\n241\n241\n241\n241\n241\n241\n\n76.5\n71.3\n163.5\n221.9\n296.3\n473.3\n\n85.5\n139.5\n193.5\n251.8\n355.5\n571.5\n\n56.3\n96.8\n137.3\n180.8\n267.8\n441.8\n\n321\n504\n687\n932\n1244\n1988\n\n325\n530\n735\n957\n1351\n2172\n\n213.8\n367.7\n521.6\n686.9\n1017.5\n1678.7\n\n81%\n127%\n173%\n235%\n314%\n502%\n\n78%\n127%\n176%\n229%\n323%\n520%\n\n89%\n153%\n217%\n285%\n423%\n697%\n\n9,000\n9,000\n9,000\n9,000\n9,000\n9,000\n\n6,800\n6,800\n6,800\n6,800\n6,800\n6,800\n\n4,700\n4,700\n4,700\n4,700\n4,700\n4,700\n\n4%\n6%\n8%\n10%\n14%\n22%\n\n5%\n8%\n11%\n14%\n20%\n32%\n\n5%\n8%\n11%\n15%\n22%\n36%\n\n12,500\n12,500\n12,500\n12,500\n12,500\n12,500\n\n10,000\n10,000\n10,000\n10,000\n10,000\n10,000\n\n8,000\n8,000\n8,000\n8,000\n8,000\n8,000\n\n3%\n4%\n5%\n7%\n10%\n16%\n\n3%\n5%\n7%\n10%\n14%\n22%\n\n3%\n5%\n7%\n9%\n13%\n21%\n\n24,000\n24,000\n24,000\n24,000\n24,000\n24,000\n\n21,250\n21,250\n21,250\n21,250\n21,250\n21,250\n\n19,500\n19,500\n19,500\n19,500\n19,500\n19,500\n\n1%\n2%\n3%\n4%\n5%\n8%\n\n2%\n2%\n3%\n5%\n6%\n10%\n\n1%\n2%\n3%\n4%\n5%\n9%\n\nPer Capita Daily Consumption of \nCold Water\n\nA.

The\n1. \naverage per capita monthly income in 2000 was estimated at SUM6,480.1 Since independence\nincome  distribution  has  worsened  between  income  groups,  sectors,  and  regions.  The  national\nGini  coefficient  grew  from  0.26  in  1991  to  0.42  in  1998.2  In  Government  terms  the  poor  are\nclassified as a vulnerable and low-income group based on the prevailing official minimum wage,\nwhich is adjusted regularly for inflation, and in January 2001 was set at SUM2,450 per month.\n\n2. \nThe  Government  household  survey  is  the  main  source  for  monitoring  living  standards.\nBased  on  the  poverty  line  definition  of  75  roubles  per  capita  per  month  before  independence,\nthe incidence of poverty, at that time, was estimated to be 44 percent of the working population.\nIf this measure is updated for the latest household survey (1996)3 to SUM740 per capita then\nthe  incidence  of  poverty  in  1996  was  21.1percent.  More  recent  work  by  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr\nTechnische  Zusammenarbeit,  Tacis,  and  the  World  Bank  in  Tashkent,  Ferghana,  and\nKarakalpakstan,  using  the  minimum  wage  criteria,  indicates  that  urban  poverty  in  these  areas\nwas estimated at 10, 28, and 50 percent, respectively. In the same survey, self-ranked poverty\n(i.e.,  not  having  enough  money  for  food  and  medicines)  in  these  areas  ranged  from  30  to  70\npercent of the population depending on the location. Using the World Bank definition of poverty\nof $1 per day, even at the official exchange rate, would put the average income in Uzbekistan at\napproximately two thirds of the $1 a day level. This indicates that the majority of the population\nis  poor.  In  1996  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP)4  estimated  the  poverty\nline based on a basket of goods for the lowest 10 percent of income groups to be SUM1,006 per\ncapita, or an equivalent of SUM6,011 in 2001 prices.\n\nB.\n\nIncome in Project Cities\n\n3. \nIncome and expenditure data for 1999 and 2000 shows that the average annual money\nincome  was  SUM61,200  and  expenditure  was  SUM53,000,  an  equivalent  of  SUM6,400  and\nSUM5,700 per month. However, the national average hides wide variations between Tashkent\nCity  and  other  oblasts  (provinces)  where  income  and  expenditure  levels  are  much  lower.\nIncome  and  expenditure  in  the  project  cities  range  from  40  to  65  percent  of  the  national\naverage.5 Of the 14 regions (including Tashkent City and the Republic of Karakalpakstan), the\noblasts where the project cities are located ranked 9, 11, and 14.\n\nOblast (City)\n\nMoney\nIncome\n(half year)\n2000\n38,900\n23,000\n30,400\n31,300\n\nConsumer\nExpenditure\n(half year)\n2000\n34,200\n15,600\n22,600\n23,000\n\nMoney\nIncome\n(per month)\n2000\n6,480\n3,830\n5,070\n5,220\n\nNational Average\nDjizzak (Djizzak)\nSyrdarya (Gulistan)\nKashkadarya (Karshi)\nSource: Staff estimates.\n                                                     \n1  Government of Uzbekistan. 2000.

The problems involved\nin defining a poverty line include (i) use of official statistics that are not always reliable; (ii) use of\nnarrow definitions of poverty, which tend to ignore the economic, cultural, and social situation in\nthe  project  area  and  the  difficulties  of  measuring  nonmonetary  benefits;  and  (iii)  unregistered\nincome, which may form a significant part of actual income levels. Based on this evidence and\nin  the  absence  of  an  agreed  Government  definition  of  poverty,  an  estimated  poverty  line  of\nSUM4,000  per  capita  per  month  based  on  income,  expenditure,  and  quality  of  life  criteria  has\nbeen  used  to  calculate  the  percentage  of  poor  beneficiaries.  This  is  slightly  lower  than  the\naverage between the Government minimum wage and the UNDP definition of the poverty line,\nand is supported by data on quality of life from the household survey.\n\nD.\n\nLoan Classification\n\nBased on a poverty line of SUM4,000 per capita per month and the social survey results,\n5. \n45 percent of project beneficiaries are poor. This includes 37 percent in Djizzak, 44 percent in\nGulistan,  and  51  percent  in  Karshi.  The  loan  is  therefore  classified  as  a  poverty  intervention\nsince the proportion of beneficiaries classified as poor is in the range of 25 to 50 percent.\n\nE.\n\nPoverty Impact Assessment\n\n6. \nThe assessment of poverty impact used for this Project has considered (i) the extent to\nwhich  the  project  targets  areas  where  the  poor  are  located;  (ii)  the  proportion  of  project\nbeneficiaries  who  are  poor;  (iii)  the  targeting  of  the  project  loan  toward  the  poor;  and  (iv)  the\nimpact on the quality of life of the poor.\n\nIdentification  of  the  poor  within  a  set  of  project  beneficiaries  is  not  possible  for  this\n7. \nProject. Poor people live in houses and apartments, and are not geographically clustered within\nthe  cities.  Since  the  poor  are  not  geographically  clustered,  and  the  Project  covers  the  entire\nthree  cities,  the  loan  is  not  targeted  more  to  the  poor  than  the  nonpoor.  All  beneficiaries  will\nbenefit from the improvements to the water supply services.\n\n8. \nUsing  a  poverty  line  of  SUM4,000  per  capita  per  month,  the  proportion  of  poor\nhouseholds  in  the  three  project  cities  is  around  45  percent.  About  45  percent  of  the  Project\u2019s\nbeneficiaries will be poor. The Project will improve the water supply service to all beneficiaries\nwhether poor or not. The only difference between poor and nonpoor is that the poor are least\nlikely to be able to cope under the existing situation as they cannot afford to pay for alternatives.\nThis situation will worsen if the Project does not go ahead as infrastructure facilities continue to\ndeteriorate and the service becomes increasingly intermittent or fails completely.\n\n9. \nThe  project  loan  from  ADB  provides  55  percent  of  the  project  costs.  The  funds  will  be\ntargeted at project beneficiaries, 45 percent of whom are poor. Based on this, $16.2 million of\nthe funds will be targeted to the poor and gives a category B rating for loan targeting.\n\n10. \nPoverty  impact  is  also  measured  in  terms  of  quality  of  life  related  to  a  definition  of  an\nacceptable urban living standard including access to basic services such as water supply, all of\nwhich are included in the ADB objective of poverty reduction. For this Project it is assumed that\nthe  acceptable  urban  living  standard  is  assumed  to  be  the  standard  of  service  provision  that\nexisted  when  the  water  services  functioned  properly.  The  effects  of  deficiencies  in  present\n\n\f75\n\nAppendix 17, page 3\n\nstandards of service delivery are also taken into account. Relative deprivation, which takes into\naccount  the  urban  lifestyle,  can  also  be  adapted  to  the  specific  quality  of  life  problems\nexperienced in transitional economies.\n\nQuality  of  life  measures  for  households  appropriate  for  the  water  supply  component  of\n11. \nthis  Project  include  (i)  access  to  safe  drinking  water,  (ii)  access  to  washing  facilities,  (iii)\nmorbidity level due to exposure to waterborne disease, and (iv) proportion of the day spent in\nwater collection (i.e., loss of productive time).\n\n12. \nArea targeting of low-income households is not achievable in the context of Uzbekistan.\nHowever, while middle and higher income households are able to purchase alternative services,\ne.g.,  large  water  storage  containers  and  water  pumps,  lower  income  households  are  more\nvulnerable to service deficiencies as these coping mechanisms are unaffordable. This leads to\nopportunity  costs,  which  have  long-term  implications  and  perpetuate  the  poverty  cycle.  These\nfamilies  are  more  vulnerable  to  sickness  and  are  likely  to  spend  a  larger  proportion  of  their\nincome on medical treatment. This sickness can lead to comparatively low school attendance,\nand decreased ability to learn or to be involved in productive work.\n\n13. \nThe Project will also provide opportunities for women to use their time more productively\n(since they will not have to spend a large amount of time carrying water). Small- and medium-\nsized businesses are likely to improve productivity with continuous supply of water. The Project\nwill  also  create  construction  job  opportunities  for  both  skilled  and  unskilled  labor  during  the\nimplementation stage. The Project will create about 2,100 person-months of skilled employment\nand about 5,000 person-months of unskilled employment.\n\nF.\n\nConclusion\n\n14. \nBased  on  the  45  percent  poor  beneficiaries,  about  $16.2  million  of  the  loan  will  be\ntargeted to the poor. The quality of life of the poor will improve as lower income households are\nmore vulnerable to service deficiencies. The Project will reduce the effect of opportunity costs,\nwhich perpetuate the poverty cycle.\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS\n(as of 31 July 2001)\n", "Currency Unit\nSUM1.00\n$1.00\n", "\u2013\n=\n=\n", "Sum (SUM)\n$0.00256\nSUM390 (official exchange rate)\n", "For the purpose of calculations in this report, an exchange rate of $1.00 = SUM350 has been\nused.
