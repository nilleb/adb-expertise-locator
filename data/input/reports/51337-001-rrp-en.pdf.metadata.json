Tamil Nadu is the southernmost state of India, stretched along the Bay of \nBengal,  and  borders  the  states  of,  Andhra  Pradesh,  Karnataka,  and  Kerala.  With  an  area  of \n130,000 square km, it is India\u2019s 10th largest state. The western and northwestern parts of Tamil \nNadu are hilly, featuring the Western and Eastern Ghats, and are rich in vegetation. The central \nand eastern parts are generally fertile plains, but arid in some central and southern districts. The \ntotal  population  in  2016  was  estimated  at  about  78  million. 2 Major  cities  such  as  Chennai, \nCoimbatore, Erode, Madurai, Salem, Tiruchirappalli, Tirunelveli, and Tiruppur are in the center of \nthe plains or near the Eastern Ghats in the northwest. \n \nTamil Nadu has the second-largest state economy in India after Maharashtra.3 With robust \n4. \neconomic growth averaging about 8.5% since fiscal year (FY) 2006, it recorded a steady decline \nin poverty from 28.9% in 2004\u20132005 to 11.2% in 2011\u20132012, translating into an average annual \npoverty reduction rate of 12.7%, well above the national average of 7.3% for the same period. Its \npoverty  levels  are  lower  than  those  of  most  other  states  in  India. 4  While  Tamil  Nadu  has \ntraditionally been agrarian, agriculture now contributes less than 10% of the gross state domestic \nproduct. Instead, manufacturing and some service industries such as finance and real estate are \nmajor drivers of growth. Tamil Nadu ranks first among Indian states in  the number of factories \nand  industrial  workers,  and  has  one  of  India\u2019s  most  diversified  and  modern  industrial  bases, \nsupplemented by strong foreign direct investment. It leads in several manufacturing industries, \nincluding automobiles, engineering, pharmaceuticals, garments, textile products, and aerospace. \n \n5. \n Despite  the  growth  and  progress  in  poverty  reduction,  Tamil  Nadu  faces  several \neconomic and social challenges. From FY2013 to FY2020, its economy posted average annual \ngrowth of 7.0%, markedly lower than the 10.3% average of the preceding 6 years. Tamil Nadu\u2019s \nper capita net domestic product was the third highest among the major Indian states in FY2012, \nafter  Maharashtra  and  Haryana,  but  plunged  to  sixth  place  in  FY2019,  overtaken  by  Gujarat, \n\nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n1  Details of the upgrades are in para. 27 and Technical Features of the Proposed Project (accessible from the list of \n\n2  Government of Tamil Nadu, Department of Economics and Statistics. 2018. Statistical Handbook 2018. Chennai. \n3  Government of India, Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. 2020.  Gross State Domestic Product. \n\n4  Tamil Nadu has one of the highest numbers of cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in India, which could have \n\na substantial negative impact on the state economy in FY2021. \n\nNew Delhi. \n\n \n\n\fKarnataka,  and  Kerala. 5 Both  the  poverty  ratio  and  human  development  index  vary  among \ndistricts;  rural  areas,  away  from  industrial  hubs  such  as  Chennai  and  Coimbatore,  are  still \nexperiencing low incomes, and their poverty levels remain high, exceeding 30% of the population \nin some districts.6 Consumption inequality in the state is higher than the national average. Tamil \nNadu needs to transform its economy to become more value-added, further develop its industrial \nbases with efficient value chains, and expand these economic activities throughout the state for \ninclusive growth. \n \nStrategic  plan  for  the  state's  development.  In  2012,  the  Government  of  Tamil  Nadu \n6. \nunveiled Vision Tamil Nadu 2023, a strategic plan for infrastructure development synchronized \nwith economic transformation.7 To achieve upper middle-income per capita status for the state, \nVision Tamil Nadu 2023 identifies the key areas for economic acceleration, such as increasing \nthe  share  of manufacturing,  energizing  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises, focusing  on  skills \ndevelopment,  and  providing  the  best  infrastructure  services,  including  the  development  of \nindustrial corridors. \n \nEast  Coast  Economic  Corridor.  The  Government  of  India  has  initiated  an  \u201cindustrial \n7. \ncorridor  approach\u201d  to  stimulate  manufacturing  and  an  \u201cAct  East\u201d  policy  to  integrate  the  Indian \neconomy  with  Asia\u2019s  dynamic  global  production  networks.  The  industrial  corridor  approach \ninvolves  the  creation  of  an  efficient  multimodal  transport  network  supported  by  quality \ninfrastructure  and  logistics  within  a  defined  geography,  and  a  policy  framework  that  facilitates \nbusiness operations for integration with global production networks. Industrial corridors are also \ncentral  to  India\u2019s  \u201cMake  in  India\u201d  initiative,  which  encourages  investments  in  manufacturing  to \nstimulate growth and create high-quality jobs. In line with these policies, the government and the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  identified  the  East  Coast  Economic  Corridor  (ECEC)\u2014India\u2019s \nfirst coastal corridor\u2014stretching more than 2,500 km from West Bengal to Tamil Nadu. The ECEC \naims to stimulate growth through network externalities,  links with urban and industrial clusters, \nand integration in regional value chains in Southeast and East Asia through the ports along the \ncoastline, including Chennai and Thoothukudi in Tamil Nadu serving as major ports.  \n \n8. \nThe  CKIC  (para.  2)  is  proposed  as  the  second  phase  of the  ECEC,  covering  23  of the \n32 districts  between  Chennai  and  Kanyakumari  in  Tamil  Nadu  as  its  influence  areas. 8  The \nobjectives  of  the  CKIC  are  to  promote  manufacturing  competitiveness  and  job  creation  in  the \ncorridor, increase the manufacturing industry\u2019s participation in global value chains and production \nnetworks, and serve as a key driver to achieving Vision Tamil Nadu 2023. The ADB-supported \ncomprehensive development plan (CDP) for the CKIC9 established a strategy for the industrial \ntransformation by introducing industrial nodes to promote manufacturing bases with comparative \nadvantages.10 The  CDP  also  identified  nearly  200  projects  in  the  transport,  energy,  and  urban \nsectors to underpin the industrial growth strategy. ADB\u2019s overarching approach for the CKIC has \n\n \n\n5  Tamil Nadu\u2019s per capita net domestic product in FY2019 was about $2,600. \n6  Government of Tamil Nadu. 2017. Tamil Nadu Human Development Report 2017. Chennai. \n7  Government of Tamil Nadu. 2012. Vision Tamil Nadu 2023: Strategic Plan for Infrastructure Development in Tamil \nNadu. Chennai. In the road subsector of the strategic plan, the following investment requirements were identified to \nsupport the strategy: (i) enhancement of 2,000 km of trunk roads between Chennai and major towns into 6- or 8-lane \ncorridors; (ii) modernization of state highways covering 5,000 km of four-lane highways; (iii) improvements of other \nstate highways and major roads for a total length of 2,700 km, including improvements to pavements, cross-sections \nsuch as paved shoulders, and bypasses; and (iv) an upgrade of 8,080 km of major district roads. \n\n8  The Visakhapatnam\u2013Chennai Industrial Corridor, also supported by ADB, represents the first phase of the ECEC. \n9  ADB. 2017. Chennai\u2013Kanyakumari Industrial Corridor: Comprehensive Development Plan. Manila. \n10 Six industrial nodes were identified: (i) Cuddalore and Nagapattinam, (ii) Ariyalur and Perambalur, (iii) Tiruchirappalli\u2013\nPudukottai\u2013Sivaganga, (iv) Madurai\u2013Dindigul\u2013Virudhunagar\u2013Theni, (v) Ramanathapuram, and (vi) Thoothukudi and \nTirunelveli. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fplayed a significant role in guiding priority infrastructure for economic corridor development, and \nalso served as a catalyst for attracting targeted investments by the private sector. Responding to \nthe  identified  development  needs,  ADB supported the  government\u2019s  effort to  create  a  physical \nand institutional enabling environment for economic transformation through investment loans in \nenergy and urban infrastructure and through technical assistance projects (para. 18). \n \n9. \nRoad transport for industrial development. Tamil Nadu\u2019s road network is dense and \nwell  laid  out,  providing  basic  access  to  the  state\u2019s  population  and  economic  activity  centers.11 \nHowever,  many  state  highways  still  need  to  be  improved  for  smoother  transport.12 The  CDP \nprojected that nearly 90% of major roads would not fully provide stable traffic flow services in 2025 \nbecause of increasing traffic demand in the area. Since the logistics costs of the CKIC\u2019s targeted \nindustries  are  estimated  at  3%\u201310%  of  the  total  production  costs,  seamless  road  connectivity \nbetween  industrial  clusters,  transport  gateways,  and  consumption  centers  would  be  critical  for \ngreater  competitiveness.  The  CDP\u2019s  road  capacity  and  service  level  assessments  identified  a \npriority road network of 7,653 km, including four trunk routes and 76 lateral grid connections, to \nbe upgraded for well-connected regional transport networks that will link the potential industrial \ngrowth centers and the rural hinterland with the trunk routes, international ports, and high-density \nurban areas.13 The transport sector, aligned with the industrial development strategy, will promote \nconnectivity  to  global  value  chains  and  markets,  including  in  Asian  countries,  and  cater  to  the \nvalue-adding manufacturing industry. \n \n10. \nThe project is part of the identified priority road network and selected for ADB financing in \nthe CDP to improve lateral road connectivity for industrial development, as conceptualized under \nthe CKIC.14 It also aligns with Vision Tamil Nadu 2023 and the basic policies for Tamil Nadu\u2019s \nroad transport development.15 \n \n11. \nEmerging challenges in road sector. In addition to the road transport needs, the road \nauthorities must meet several other challenges. Road safety, in particular, is a growing concern \nin Tamil Nadu. In 2018, the total number of road crashes in India was reported at 467,044, causing \ninjuries to 469,418 individuals and claiming 151,417 lives. Tamil Nadu topped the number of road \ncrashes  nationwide  with  a  share  of  13.7%,  followed  by  Madhya  Pradesh  with  11.0%. 16 It  is \nimperative to involve all stakeholders in road safety improvements, and any such measures must \nbe implemented on a pilot basis and then standardized as good practice. Also, road authorities \nneed to strengthen their institutional capacity to apply newly developed material, equipment, and \nconstruction and maintenance methods to road projects and thus obtain better value for money, \nincluding greater road safety, climate change resilience, and private sector involvement. \n \n\n \n\nand major district roads for 18%. \n\ntwo lanes or even just one. \n\n11 Tamil Nadu has 66,039 km of major roads, of which national highways account for 10%, state highways for 17%, \n\n12 While 47% of the national highways are multi-lane (four lanes or more), nearly 80% of state highways still have only \n\n13 The four trunk routes are: (i) East Coast Road; (ii) NH32, NH 132, SH 83, NH 38; (iii) NH 44 NS; and (iv) NH36 and \nSH42. All except the northern part of NH44 NS fall into the CKIC influence areas. East Coast Road and NH32, 132, \n83,  38/southern part  of  NH44  NS  are  considered  spines  of  the  CKIC.  NH36  and  SH42  are  running  between  the \nspines in parallel. \n\n14 Two project roads (SH79 and SH86) are not part of the priority road network defined in the CDP but are included in \nthe scope of the project. They are considered extensions of the priority road network to link a trunk road and core \ncities in the neighboring districts of CKIC influence areas. The two roads are still part of the core road network of \nTamil Nadu and included in the improvement of state highways under Vision Tamil Nadu 2023. \n\n15 Government of Tamil Nadu, Highways Department. 2019.

The project aligns with ADB\u2019s country partnership \n12. \nstrategy, 2018\u20132022 for India, which emphasizes boosting economic competitiveness to create \nmore  and  better  jobs  by  expanding  the  infrastructure  network  for  transport  and  energy  along \neconomic corridors, including the ECEC; and addressing climate change and increasing climate \nresilience. 17 The  project  is  listed  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan,  2021\u20132023  for \nIndia.18 It  contributes  to  the  operational  priorities  of  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  through  (i)  reducing \nremaining  poverty  and  inequalities  and  (ii)  promoting  rural  development  and  food  security  by \ncascading economic and social benefits from growth centers to  nearby areas; (iii) accelerating \nprogress  in  gender  equality  in  employment  opportunities,  capacity  strengthening  and  safety \nconcerns;  (iv) tackling  climate  change,  building  climate  and  disaster  resilience,  and  enhancing \nenvironmental sustainability of roads; (v) strengthening governance and institutional capacity in \nroad  safety,  research,  and  planning;  and  (vi)  fostering  regional  cooperation  and  integration  by \nimproving the lateral connectivity to major ports for global production networks.19 \n \n13. \nLessons  from  previous  assistance  by  ADB  and  other  development  partners. \nPrevious  road  transport  projects\u2014e.g.,  Uttarakhand  State-Road  Investment  Program,  Madhya \nPradesh State Roads Project III, and National Highway Sector II Project\u2014have shown the need \nfor (i) stronger post-construction maintenance, including contractual arrangements; (ii) measures \nto  improve  contractors\u2019  performance;  and  (iii)  greater  focus  on  the  selection  of  qualified \ncontractors in multiple contract procurement.20 The TNHD implemented two similar state highway \nprojects funded by the World Bank. A review of the first project stressed the need to pay adequate \nattention to the empowerment of dedicated implementation units, and also highlighted the merits \nof  successful  land  acquisition  through  private  negotiations.21 An  implementation  report  on  the \nsecond  project  rated  the  overall  implementation  progress  satisfactory.22 Although  the  public\u2013\nprivate  partnership  (PPP)  modality  caused  substantial  delays,  9  out  of  10  engineering, \nprocurement,  and  construction  (EPC)  contracts  were  completed. 23  These  lessons  and \nexperiences  were  fed  into  the  design  of  the  proposed  project  and  its  implementation \narrangements, resulting in longer PBM contracts, incentives for early completion, a strengthened \nproject  implementation  unit  (PIU),  the  introduction  of multiple  contract  award  criteria  in  the  bid \ndocuments, and land acquisition through the approved private negotiation procedures. \n \nB. \n \n14. \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  economic  prosperity  and  employment \ngeneration with inclusive growth achieved (footnote 7). It will have the following outcome: capacity, \nconnectivity, efficiency, and safety of the highway system increased (footnote 15).24 \n \n\nProject Description \n\n \n\n17 ADB.  2017.

The project will upgrade about \n15. \n590 km of 16 state highways in the CKIC influence and its neighboring areas with (i) engineering \ndesign features of climate change adaptation and road safety, and (ii) 7-year PBM.25 \n \nOutput 2: Capacity in road safety, sector planning, and research enhanced. The loan \n16. \nwill support (i) strengthening of the knowledge and research function of the Highway Research \nStation  (HRS)  by  developing  its  institutional  strategy  and  by  modernizing  its  organization, \nbusiness  process,  facilities,  and  equipment  to  pursue  better  value  for  money  in  the  sector; \n(ii) development  and  piloting  of  road  safety  improvement  program  in  accident-increasing \nurbanizing  areas  by  introducing  (a)  standard  operating  procedures  among  stakeholders;  and \n(b) advanced technologies for material, road facilities, monitoring methods, reporting system, and \nenforcement;  and  (iii)  enhancement  of  sector  planning  capacity,  including  (a)  examination  of \ninnovative contract modalities involving more private sector participation in road service provision, \n(b) development of sector strategic direction to address evolving technology, and (c) preparation \nfor implementation plan to eliminate traffic bottlenecks such as railway level crossings.26 \n \nContract  modality.  The  Government  of  Tamil  Nadu  has  introduced  several  innovative \n17. \ncontract modalities to better involve the private sector in the development of major state roads. \nThese  include  EPC,  PPP  (annuity),  PBM,  design\u2013build\u2013operate  and  transfer,  and  output-  and \nperformance-based contracts. The EPC modality with 7-year PBM was selected because of the \n(i) non-revenue-generating project features, (ii) lack of interest by market forces in PPP contracts, \nand (iii) financial difficulties in the private sector caused by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) \npandemic. The EPC\u2013PBM modality will ensure the maximum use of private players' engineering, \nconstruction, and maintenance capacity, and achieve efficiency and quality gains by combining \nthe  three  phases  of  design,  construction,  and  maintenance  into  one  contract.  This  will  also \nimprove asset quality and service levels. \n \nC. \n \n18.  With  strategic  planning  support  from  ADB,  the  CDP  for  the  CKIC  was  prepared,  which \nincludes an infrastructure strategy to drive economic growth, high-potential industrial sectors, and \na set of priority projects. The CKIC, with its long coastline and strategically located ports, provides \nmultiple international gateways to connect India with vibrant global production networks and to \nfacilitate  regional  integration.  The  CDP  identifies  the  CKIC\u2019s  high  potential  for  generating \nadditional employment and industrial output. ADB\u2019s strong ties with the implementing agencies \nfor urban, energy, transport, and regional cooperation enable an integrated, multidisciplinary, and \ncross-sector approach to developing the infrastructure required for an economic corridor.27 The \ninfrastructure investments are further complemented by ADB\u2019s support for soft components, such \nas a detailed master plan study of industrial nodes, greater ease of doing business, single-window \nplatform for investment facilitation, and stronger dialogue with investors.28 This road project is the \n\nValue Added by ADB \n\n \n\n25 The PBM includes overlay works in the sixth year of the maintenance period. \n26 Highway Research Station is an institution in the TNHD established in 1954 to provide technical guidance on road \n\nconstruction and maintenance, including road safety. \n\n27 ADB.  2018.

ADB\u2019s value addition is also to facilitate the government in creating \npositive  external  effects  that  can  spill  over  to  or  be  replicated  in  other  states  or  projects.  To \nachieve this, project activities were chosen based on their potential for wider replication, level of \nmaturity,  and  the  participating  agencies\u2019  capacity.  The  road  safety  improvement  program, \ntargeted at urbanizing areas with a rapidly changing safety environment, will be prepared as a \ncomprehensive road  safety  approach that  (i)  involves  roadside residents,  including  women,  as \nwell as all government agencies concerned; and (ii) introduces advanced safety technologies.29 \nThe  government  agencies may  later  refine  and use  these  approaches for further replication  in \nother states or projects. The strengthening of the HRS as a knowledge and research hub will underpin \nthe  effective  application  of  newly  developed  road  safety  technologies  and  help  the  government \nimprove  the  performance  of  the  whole  road  sector.  From  a  road  management  perspective,  the \nintroduction  of  several  innovative  contract  modalities  that  involve  private  players  in  road  service \nprovision  (para.17)  yielded  varying  implementation  results,  so  the  project  will  support  the  TNHD\u2019s \neffort  to  review  and  refine  the  modalities  for  possible  replication.  These  capacity  development \ncomponents will add value to the project by creating spillover impacts beyond the project scope, and \ncan be used by the government as a tool for replication initiatives.30 The economic corridor strategic \nplanning is another key initiative in the project for effective regional development. ADB is assisting in \nadopting  the  similar  strategic  approach  in  other  states  of  India  to  promote  investments  in  critical \ninfrastructure and reforms to attract private investments. Good practices and models obtained from \nthe project and the strategic planning approach will be further channeled and disseminated through \nthe  Capacity  Development  Resource  Center  in  ADB\u2019s  India  Resident  Mission  to  facilitate  the \ngovernment in replicating these good practices and learnings in other states. \n \nD. \n \n20. \n \n21. \nDetailed  cost  estimates  by  expenditure  category  and  by  financier  are  included  in  the \nproject  administration  manual  (PAM). 31  Civil  works  and  consulting  services  are  the  major \nexpenditure items under the project. \n \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $904.60 million (Table 1).  \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\nItem \nA. \n \n\nBase Costb \n\n1.

A  climate  change  assessment \nindicated  high  risk  of  flooding  caused  by  increased  rainfall  because  of  climate  change.32 The \nfrequency  of  extreme  rainfall  events  is  projected  to  increase,  particularly  in  western  hilly  and \neastern coastal areas. Drainage will be improved to cope with higher flooding frequency and to \nprovide higher discharge capacities. Bridges and culverts will be resized and redesigned to secure \nsmoother  water  flow.  Road  embankments  will  be  raised  in  critical  sections  to  prevent  water \nstagnation  and  flooding  impacts,  and  slopes  will  be  protected  through  bioengineering  and \nstructural measures. Climate adaptation is estimated to cost $53.13 million.

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on \nthe project has been reviewed by ADB and the TNHD. Because most materials and resources \nrequired for the implementation can be secured locally or domestically, COVID-19 is not expected \nto cause any significant delays or cost increases; however, the project may attract fewer bidders \n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fbecause  of  potential  financial  difficulties  caused  by  the  pandemic.  While  no  changes  to  the \nimplementation  arrangements  are  considered  necessary  at  this  stage,  the  TNHD  continues  to \nmonitor  the  procurement  performance  closely,  and  work  effectively  within  the  constraints  and \nsafety  requirements  imposed  by  the  government\u2019s  response  to  the  pandemic.  The  project's \nimplementation, on the other hand, will have a positive impact on the local economy through the \nconstruction value chain and the generation of local employment. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\nEconomic and Financial Viability \n\n \nA. \n \n27. \nThe  project  was  assessed  as  technically  viable.  The  TNHD  prepared  the  engineering \ndesign of the project roads during project preparation. The engineering design follows applicable \ncriteria in line with Indian Roads Congress regulations. The upgrades will involve the expansion \nof  lanes  and  shoulders,  overlay  of  pavement,  construction  of  bypasses  in  congested  areas, \nreplacement  of  aging  bridges  and  culverts,  realignment  of  sharp  curves,  railway  overpasses \n(instead  of  level  crossings),  road  redesigns  for  climate  resilience,  installation  of  road  safety \nfacilities, and construction of bus bays and shelters. \n \nB. \n \n28. \nThe project is economically viable. The economic evaluation of the project was undertaken \nin accordance with ADB guidelines by comparing life-cycle economic costs and benefits in with-\nproject and without-project scenarios, against an assumed hurdle rate of 9% as decision criteria.33 \nThe quantified benefits include savings in vehicle operation costs and travel time, as well as a \nreduction in carbon dioxide emissions. The overall economic internal rate of return is estimated \nto be 18.4%. The sensitivity analysis demonstrated the robustness of the project.34 \n \nC. \n \n29. \nThe project will not generate revenue. Once the 7-year PBM period is over, the TNHD will \nassume responsibility for maintenance through regular budget allocations in each financial year. \nThe  budgetary  requirements  for  maintaining  the  project  road  assets  will  decrease  in  the  first \n20 years after construction because of (i) lower routine maintenance costs thanks to improved \nroad conditions, (ii) the inclusion of PBM contracts, and (iii) sixth-year overlay works as part of \nthe PBM. The state's annual budget allocation to routine maintenance was about \u20b910 billion on \naverage during FY2016\u2013FY2020, which is about 10%\u201312% of the total annual road budget.35 At \npresent, TNHD is capable of maintaining most state highways and major district roads in fairly \ngood condition with the current level of maintenance budget, established road asset management \nsystem for efficient maintenance planning and resource allocation, as well as the involvement of \nthe  private  sector  in  road  maintenance.  In  fact,  less  than  10%  of  the  roads  are  now  in  poor \ncondition. The required recurrent costs of the project roads are estimated to be about 0.7% of the \nTNHD maintenance budget. The TNHD has committed to prioritize the allocation of maintenance \nfunding for the project roads. \n\nSustainability \n\n \n33 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n34 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The possible impact \nof COVID-19 on traffic demand was also assessed in the traffic demand forecast and the sensitivity analysis. The \neconomic internal rate of return varies among project roads from 10.2% to 25.2%. \n\n35 In addition, about \u20b910 billion is allocated annually to periodic maintenance under the Improvement to Riding Quality \nProgramme. Some road improvement works are also carried out as part of the Comprehensive Road Infrastructure \nDevelopment Programme, with an annual budget of about \u20b927 billion on average during FY2016\u2013FY2020. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nGovernance \n\nD. \n \n30. \nInstitutional.  The  TNHD  will  implement  the  project  through  a  PIU  based  in  Chennai. \nBecause the project covers a large geographic area, six field implementation units (FIUs) and four \nfield-level land acquisition, resettlement, and rehabilitation (LARR) units were set up to support \nthe PIU. Many of the staff members in the PIU and FIUs have experience in implementing World \nBank-funded projects, and have sufficient capacity to prepare and implement the  ADB project. \nConsultants  to  be  engaged  under  the  project  will  support  the  PIU  in  the  areas  of  project \nmanagement, supervision, reporting, financial management, and safeguard monitoring. \n \n31. \nFinancial  management.  The  assessed  pre-mitigation  financial  management  risk  is \nmoderate, mainly because the TNHD has not previously implemented ADB-supported projects \nand  because  the  large  geographical  spread  of  the  project  carries  inherent  risk.  The  TNHD  is \nfamiliar with the requirements for maintaining separate project records and accounts from working \nwith the World Bank. The identified risks will be mitigated through the provision of training on ADB \npolicies  and  procedures,  the  appointment  of  a  qualified  financial  expert  to  the  PIU,  and  the \nimplementation of a comprehensive project financial management manual. The PIU has already \ndrafted such a manual with detailed policies and procedures governing internal controls, financial \nmanagement, and financial reporting. \n \nProcurement and value for money. The project procurement risk is rated medium. The \n32. \nrisk  assessment  concluded  that  the  executing  agency,  although  new  to  ADB's  procurement \npolicies  and regulations,  has  significant  experience  in  procuring  and managing  civil  works  and \nconsulting  contracts  under  both  national  and  World  Bank  regulations.  All  major  procurement \npackages will be subject to prior review to avoid any risks of noncompliance in the procurement \nprocess. The procurement of 16 civil works packages and the recruitment of consulting services \nis  progressing  well  under  advance  action.36 The  project's  value  for  money  is  being  optimized \nthrough  strategic  procurement  planning  and  a  risk-managed  approach  as  follows:  open \ncompetitive bidding; use of eProcurement; application of the EPC contract modality with 7-year \nPBM; works contracts packaged based on project readiness, market capacity, and geographical \nproximity; and application of multiple contract evaluation criteria and early completion bonus. \n \n33. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  TNHD.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 31). \n \nE. \n \n34. \nPoverty.  The  average  poverty  level  in  Tamil  Nadu  is  lower  than  the  national  rate  as  a \nresult  of  relatively  higher  average  incomes,  but  income  disparity  within  the  state  is  significant \n(para. 5). The project will improve state highways to link potential industrial growth areas and their \nhinterland; beneficiaries, including the poor, will benefit from better access to basic services and \njobs.  The  project  will  also  enable  economic  growth  through  industrial  development  along  the \nproject roads. Its preparation involved consultations with local community members, both women \nand men, who were generally supportive of the project, saying that the road improvements would \nenhance  mobility  between  commercial  centers  and  thus  increase  economic  and  employment \nopportunities. \n \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n36 Bids for all 16 civil works contracts have been invited, and requests for proposals for all five supervision consulting \n\ncontracts were issued.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fSafeguards \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nGender.  The  project  is  categorized  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The  road \n35. \ninfrastructure improvements will yield several gender-related advantages, such as better access \nto  health  and  education  services,  more  income  opportunities,  affordable  and  reliable  transport \nfacilities for safe mobility, better implementation of government outreach programs, and reduced \ntime poverty. Tamil Nadu generally fares better than other states of India on several important \ngender  parameters. 37  The  gender  equality  and  social  inclusion  (GESI)  action  plan  defines \nindicators and targets, responsible agencies, and time frames to ensure effective implementation, \nmonitoring, and reporting of GESI activities. This includes (i) considering the specific needs and \nsafety concerns of different users\u2014the elderly, women, children, and people with disabilities\u2014in \nthe  design,  upgrade,  and  maintenance  of  roads  and  facilities;  (ii)  creating  an  enabling \nenvironment  to  attract  women  to  construction  work  and  participation  in  the  PIU  and  FIUs; \n(iii) involving  women's  self-help  groups  in  road  maintenance;  (iv)  involving  women  in  the \nimplementation  of  afforestation  programs;  (v)  ensuring  community  participation  in  road  safety \nimprovements;  (vi)  rolling  out  various  awareness-raising  programs;  and  (vii)  collecting  sex-\ndisaggregated  data  during  the  baseline  survey,  subproject  monitoring,  and  project  impact \nassessment.38 \n \nF. \n \n36. \ncategories are as follows.39 \n \n37. \nEnvironment (category B). Since the project will upgrade existing state highways, most \nof the road works will follow existing alignments, except for the partial realignment of curves and \nbypass construction. The TNHD prepared initial environmental examination (IEE) reports for the \n16 project roads in accordance with the Safeguard Policy Statement. Potential adverse impacts \nidentified are mostly construction-related dust, noise, vibration, pollution, soil erosion, waste, and \noccupational health and safety concerns; and some induced noise and air quality impacts during \noperation. The COVID-19 situation necessitates special attention to occupational and community \nhealth  and  safety  measures  under  the  project,  closely  monitored  by  the  PIU  and  construction \nsupervision consultants. No significant, irreversible environmental impacts are anticipated, and \nnone of the roads is located inside any critical habitat. Mitigation measures to manage all identified \nimpacts and risks were captured and budgeted in the road-specific environmental management \nand monitoring plans. However, two project roads, SH63 and SH191, border with bird sanctuaries, \nand another road, SH40-2, runs near the boundary of a reserved forest that forms part of a tiger \nreserve.40 The biodiversity and critical habitat assessments established that the sanctuaries are \ncritical habitats for migratory birds, and potential impacts on biodiversity were assessed to be of \nmedium risk, whereas physical barriers separate SH40-2 from the reserved forest, which makes \nimpacts on wildlife and other species unlikely. With implementation of the mitigation measures \nand habitat improvement activities, the project will not result in significant residual environmental \nimpacts. Biodiversity action plans were prepared for SH63 and SH191 to mitigate biodiversity-\nrelated risks, including habitat improvement activities to ensure no net loss or achieve net gain of \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n \n\n37 Details  are  in  Summary  Poverty  Reduction  and  Social  Strategy  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \n\n38 The road design includes well-marked crossings, safety signage, 1.5 meters pedestrian walkways in urban locations, \nrailings along roads, covered drains, paved shoulder, speed bumps, rumble strips, guard stones, and solar blinkers. \n\n39 ADB.

The roads fall into eco-sensitive zones \nof the sanctuaries for short sections of 1.85 km and 3.7 km, respectively. SH40-2 road is located 750 meters from \nthe edge of the Kolundumamalai Reserved Forest, which is largely separated from the core zone of the Kalakkad \nMundanthurai Tiger Reserve. \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\fbiodiversity under the project. The implementation of the biodiversity action plan, environmental \nmanagement plan, construction activities, and road operation of up to 1 year will be independently \nmonitored by a third party for SH63, SH191, and SH40-2. Public consultations were held for all \nproject  roads  during  the  detailed  project  report  and  IEE  preparation.  IEE  reports  are  available \nfrom  the  TNHD  and  disclosed  on  ADB  and  project  websites  in  compliance  with  ADB's \nrequirements on information disclosure and meaningful consultation. \n \n38. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category A). The project minimizes involuntary resettlement \nimpacts  by  constructing  bypasses  in  congested  areas  and  revisiting  the  lane  configurations  of \nsome project roads. Still, about 448 hectares of private land will be required for the 16 project \nroads, and about 14,100 households (or 59,500 individuals) will be affected by land acquisition \nand  resettlement.41 Of  the  2,340 significantly  affected  households  (totaling  10,165  individuals), \n1,166  (4,759  individuals)  are  affected  by  physical  displacement;  945  (4,463  individuals)  by \neconomic displacement; and 229 (943 individuals) by both physical and economic displacement. \nThe  TNHD  has  drafted  16  resettlement  plans  following  the  Right  to  Fair  Compensation  and \nTransparency  in  Land  Acquisition,  Rehabilitation  and  Resettlement  Act  (2013)  and  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement. The plans outline the entitlements, summary of public consultations \nand  information  disclosure,  grievance  redress  mechanism,  and  institutional  arrangements  to \nensure orderly implementation. They were prepared based on preliminary resettlement surveys, \nsocial assessments, and consultations, and will be updated based on the information gathered \nduring the award enquiry phase.42 All involuntary resettlement impacts were adequately assessed, \nand all stakeholders, including affected individuals, were meaningfully consulted. The TNHD is \nfound to have the capacity and the commitment to ensure that land acquisition and resettlement \nactivities  are  carried  out  adequately  and  in  accordance  with  all  applicable  requirements.  It  will \nengage  an  external  monitor  to  validate  the  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plans.  The \nGovernment  of  Tamil  Nadu  also  approved  the  approach  to  acquire  private  land  and  assets \nthrough  direct  purchase.  Any  land  acquisition  under  this  approach  shall  be  independently \nmonitored by a third party in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \n39. \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  B).  The  social  impact  assessment  conducted  by  the \nTNHD indicates that project road SH58-2 will involve the relocation of 41 tribal households  (or \n159 individuals) because of the proposed Arakkonam bypass. An indigenous peoples plan (IPP) \nwas  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  Constitution  of India;  India\u2019s  Right  to  Fair  Compensation \nand Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act (2013); and ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement. The IPP covers the following: (i) development of a residential colony \nadjacent  to  the  current  location  (non-traditional  land)  of  the  tribal  households  with  basic \ninfrastructure  such  as  streetlights,  24-hour  water  supply,  community  hall,  Anganavadi  (mother \nand child care center) building, and temple; (ii) provision of income-generating schemes to men \nand women in the community; and (iii) capacity building through training to uplift the welfare of \nthe  tribal  households.  The  IPP  outlines  the  entitlements,  summary  of  public  consultations  and \ninformation disclosure, grievance redress mechanism, and institutional arrangements. The TNHD \nhas the capacity and the commitment to ensure the adequate implementation of the IPP. \n \n40. \nThe PIU includes an environmental wing and a LARR unit. The wing and LARR unit will \nbe  responsible  for the  overall  management  of  safeguards  under the  project,  supported  by  FIU \nand  field-level  LARR  officers  who  will  serve  as  the  safeguard  focal  points  at  the  sites.  The \nconstruction supervision consultants will support the PIU in the implementation of the project and \n\n41 The  numbers  of  households  and  individuals  are  tentative,  and  dynamic  by  nature;  the  final  numbers  will  be \n\ndetermined during the award inquiry. The data includes households of indigenous peoples. \n\n42  The information gathered will be finalized in line with the national procedure for land acquisition. \n\n \n\n12 \n\n \n\n\fthe safeguards. The TNHD will recruit external consultants to ensure third-party monitoring and \nverification of all safeguard implementation activities and reports. Semiannual environmental and \nsocial monitoring reports will be submitted by the TNHD and disclosed on the ADB website until \nthe issuance of the project completion report. \n \nG. \n \n41. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.43 \n \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigation Measures \n\nThe executing agency has a robust asset management system.
