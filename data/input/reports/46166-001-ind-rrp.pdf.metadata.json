I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan  to  India  for  Supporting  Human  Capital  Development  in  Meghalaya,  and  (ii) proposed \nadministration of technical assistance (TA) to be provided by the Japan Fund for Poverty \nReduction  (JFPR)  for  Capacity  Building  for  Supporting  Human  Capital  Development  in \nMeghalaya.1 \n \n2.  Meghalaya is one of India\u2019s \u201cspecial category\u201d states.2 It is flanked by Bangladesh in the \nsouth and Assam, India, on the other three sides. The project will enhance the employability of \nMeghalaya\u2019s youth (16\u201335 years old) by improving the quality, access, and delivery of its \nsecondary  and  higher  secondary  (SHS)  education,  and  technical  and  vocational  skills \ndevelopment programs.3  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n  \n3.  Meghalaya is a predominantly tribal state with rich mineral reserves, more than 70% \nforest  cover,  and  abundant  rainfall.4 Owing  to  its  remote  location,  hilly  terrain,  and  poor \ninfrastructure, Meghalaya finds it difficult to attract private investment. Despite these constraints, \nits economy has grown at 8% over 2007\u20132012. The tertiary sector grew by 9.1% while the \nsecondary  sector  grew  by  9.9%.5 While  the  Government  of  Meghalaya  (GOM)  has  been \nfocusing on upgrading infrastructure development and incentivizing private investment, it is \nconstrained by the state\u2019s weak human capital profile. \n \n4.  Owing to the poor quality of Meghalaya\u2019s secondary (grades 9 and 10) and higher \nsecondary (grades 11 and 12) schools, and outdated technical and vocational education training \n(TVET)  system,  Meghalaya\u2019s  youth  find  it  difficult  to  make  the  transition  from  primary  to \nsecondary or tertiary sector jobs, and to compete for formal employment, especially outside the \nstate.6 The gross enrollment ratio is only 29.9% at the SHS level as compared with the all India \naverage of 45.5%. Of the 961 recognized SHS schools in Meghalaya, only 33 (3%) are directly \nunder the government (central and state) and cater to 6% of the students. A total of 337 (35%) \nare private-unaided schools in which 23% of the students study. The remaining 591 (62%) are \ngovernment-aided private schools where 71% of the students, mainly from poor tribal families, \nstudy. Since government-aided private schools are not eligible for infrastructure support from \nGOM and only receive limited grant funding, their infrastructure is far below the standards \nprescribed by India\u2019s National Secondary Education Mission (RMSA).7 Of the SHS schools in \n                                                \n1 The design and monitoring framework is in appendix 1.  \n2  Special category states are designated as such since they suffer from various constraints resulting from their \nspecial history, poor connectivity, difficult terrain, weak economic base, and poor infrastructure.  \n3  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance. ADB. 2012. Technical \nAssistance to India for Preparing the Supporting Human Capital Development in Meghalaya Project. Manila. \n4  The tribes listed in the Constitution Scheduled Tribe (ST) Order, 1950, account for 86% of Meghalaya\u2019s population. \nKhasis, Garos, and Jaintias are the three largest tribes of the state.  \n5 The  tertiary  sector  includes  hospitality,  transport  and  communication,  trade,  banking,  insurance,  and  public \nadministration. The secondary sector includes construction, manufacturing, and mining and quarrying. \n6  In FY2010, 62.3% of the labor force was engaged in agriculture, 25.6% in services, and 12.2% in the secondary \nsector. In terms of labor force, 55% was self-employed, 30% was casual labor, and 15% was in the formal sector. \n7  The RMSA was launched in 2009 to provide universal access to secondary education by 2017 and achieve \nuniversal retention by 2020. Under the RMSA, all government secondary schools will be provided basic facilities \nincluding classrooms, laboratories, libraries, and toilets.  ", "2 \nMeghalaya, 60% do not have science laboratories, and 72% do not have separate toilets for \ngirls. Nearly 5,700 serving SHS teachers do not have the required training. For every five \nsecondary schools, there is only one higher secondary school in Meghalaya. \n  \n5.  Owing to the poor learning environment and limited capacity at the SHS level, many \nstudents drop out before completing their education. This puts a heavy burden on Meghalaya\u2019s \nunder-resourced TVET programs. The annual TVET training capacity is 7,000 against the state \ntarget  of  21,000.  As  in  other  states,  Meghalaya\u2019s  TVET  programs  are  mainly  funded  and \ndirected by central line ministries such as those for labor and employment, human resource \ndevelopment, rural development, tourism, and industries and commerce. These programs are \nimplemented according to ministries\u2019 priorities, and lack the flexibility to respond to Meghalaya\u2019s \nevolving needs. The linkage of these TVET programs with private sector needs or the demand \nside is weak, which adversely affects their quality and placement rate.8  \n \n6.  Meghalaya\u2019s decadal population growth rate of 27.8% over 2001\u20132011 was the highest \nof all Indian states.9 More than half (56%) of Meghalaya\u2019s population is under 25 years against \n49% for India. Human capital development is an urgent priority for GOM. The Twelfth Five-Year \nPlan  of  Meghalaya,  2012\u20132017,  notes  that  education  and  skills  development  will  be  the \ncornerstone of development as these enhance people\u2019s productivity and employability, and \nempower  them  to  participate gainfully  in  market  activity.10 The  plan  aims  at  universalizing \nsecondary education as part of the RMSA mandate. However, since only 3% of Meghalaya\u2019s \nschools are under the RMSA, GOM needs additional support to improve the infrastructure and \nlearning environment in government-aided private schools where the majority of poor students \nstudy.  \n \n7.  The National Skills Policy, 2009, mandates decentralization of skills development to \nstates, and facilitation of public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) in TVET reform. Accordingly, the \nMeghalaya State Employment Promotion Council (MSEPC) was established in August 2011.11 \nThe Meghalaya State Skill Development Society (MSSDS) was formed in December 2011 to \ndeliver on the mandate laid down by MSEPC. It has been given the authority to receive funds \nfrom the government (central and state), financial institutions, and  development partners.12 \nGOM now needs to draw on external funding, best practice, and capacity development support \nto operationalize the MSSDS effectively. \n \n8.  In view of GOM\u2019s priorities, the project will enhance the employability of Meghalaya\u2019s \nyouth by improving the quality, delivery, and access of its SHS education and TVET programs. \nIt will catalyze PPPs in skills training, strengthen public training institutes, build awareness \namong  the  tribal  youth,  increase  participation  of  women,  and  strengthen  monitoring  and \nevaluation (M&E) to increase results orientation. The project will reinforce GOM\u2019s efforts in \ncreating a facilitating environment for inclusive growth and combating poverty. It is in line with \nthe country partnership strategy, 2009\u20132012 for India, which aims at supporting India\u2019s efforts \n                                                \n8  Sector Assessment (Summary): Secondary Education and Skill Development (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n9  According to Census 2011, the decadal population growth for the whole of India during 2001\u20132011 was 17%.  \n10  Government  of  Meghalaya,  Planning  Department.  2012.  Twelfth  Five-Year  Plan  of Meghalaya, 2012\u20132017. \nMeghalaya. \n11  The MSEPC is headed by the chief minister. The executive council is headed by the chief secretary. \n12  The  2011  skills-gap  analysis  conducted  by  the  National  Skill  Development  Corporation  (NSDC)  estimates \nadditional demand for 249,000 skilled workers in sectors such as horticulture, construction, hospitality, automotive, \ninformation technology (IT) and IT-enabled services, health care, and food processing within Meghalaya over \n2011\u20132021. It identifies retail, hospitality, health care, private security, and airlines (flight attendants, ground staff) \nas areas with strong employment potential outside Meghalaya provided the youth have the right skills. \n ", "3 \ntoward inclusive growth, and the country operations business plan, 2013\u20132015 for India, which \nrecognizes education as a new sector in Asian Development Bank (ADB) operations in India.13 \nThe project is fully aligned with Strategy 2020.14  \n        \n9.  This will be the first ADB project in India to focus on reform of SHS education and skills \ndevelopment. It has several innovative features. The Skills Challenge Fund (SCF) modality will \nenable the MSSDS to draw in private training agencies for providing training options to meet the \nneeds of different segments: rural and urban youth, girls and boys, dropouts (at various levels) \nand school graduates, and those seeking employment within and outside Meghalaya. District-\nlevel skills-gap analysis and M&E studies, that are sensitive to gender equality and social \ninclusion, will be conducted to ensure that training is linked to demand, and leads to the desired \nresults, i.e., placement for wage employment or enhanced remuneration for self-employment. \nPartnerships  with  the  sector  skills  councils  established  by  the  National  Skill  Development \nCorporation (NSDC) will market Meghalaya as a source of trained labor while building its skills \necosystem.  The  project  will  revitalize  public  training  institutions  by  training  their  trainers, \nimproving course material, and upgrading training equipment. This approach can be replicated \nfor strengthening the TVET programs in other states as well.  \n \n10.  The project will reinforce and build on GOM\u2019s efforts to improve road connectivity and \npower supply, attract industries, and enhance livelihoods through the flagship Integrated Basin \nDevelopment  and  Livelihood  Program. These  initiatives  are gradually stimulating  economic \nactivities and demand for skilled jobs within the state. The project is therefore, very timely, and \nensures convergence with GOM\u2019s initiatives. Given its strong pro-poor and gender focus, the \nproject will support GOM in creating a virtuous cycle of inclusive growth in the state.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact of the  project will be enhanced employability of  Meghalaya\u2019s youth. Its \noutcome will be improved quality, delivery, and access to SHS education and technical and \nvocational skills training in Meghalaya.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n12.  The outcome will be achieved through the following four outputs: \n \n13.  Output 1: Improved teaching and learning in government-aided secondary and \nhigher secondary schools. The project will enhance the physical and learning environment of \nselected schools, support school management and leadership in improving delivery of SHS \neducation, provide information and communication technology (ICT) equipment and materials \nfor more effective teaching and learning, and support training of SHS teachers. This output will \nbe achieved through the following four activities:  \n \n \n(i)  Upgrading  the  infrastructure  of  117  or  about  20%  of  the  government-aided \nprivate SHS schools to RMSA standards to improve the overall learning and \nteaching environment, improve access for the physically challenged, and meet \nseismic and other safety standards.15 Additional rooms and facilities (including \nlaboratories, libraries, separate toilets for girls and boys, clean drinking water, \n                                                \n13  ADB. 2009.

The project will upgrade three schools per block on average.  \n ", "4 \nbetter furniture, display boards, and computers) will be provided. Rooms will be \nbuilt to accommodate grades 11 and 12 where required to increase retention and \nenrollment  at  the  higher  secondary  level.  In  return  for  the  infrastructure \ndevelopment  support,  the  school  management  committees  (SMCs)  of  the \nrecipient schools will sign an agreement with GOM committing to monitor and \nenhance teacher and student attendance, upgrade teachers\u2019 qualifications and \ntraining, lower the dropout rates, monitor teaching and learning, and provide data \nregularly in the prescribed formats.16  \n(ii)  Promoting interactive learning and teaching, including in remote locations, by \nproviding tablets with built-in solar panels and pre-loaded teaching modules on \nSHS courses, soft skills, training in select trades, and career counseling to these \n117 schools.  \n(iii)  Training  by  qualified  public  and  private  sector  training  providers  for  about \n3,500 under-qualified  and  untrained  teachers  who  are  employed  in  the 591 \ngovernment-aided SHS schools. School principals and key administrators will \nalso receive training. The training will be mandatory for all untrained teachers of \nthe 117 selected schools.  \n(iv)  Enhancing Meghalaya\u2019s capacity to train teachers by upgrading the six teacher \ntraining centers (TTCs) and providing these with modern teaching facilities. The \nproject will also support training for the instructors in the TTCs.    \n \n14.  Output  2:  Increased  capacity  and  responsiveness  of  technical  and  vocational \neducation and training. The project will help the MSSDS catalyze market-responsive skills \ntraining programs in line with the priorities laid down by the MSEPC through two broad activities: \n(i)  Strengthening skills training in Meghalaya to coordinate and target priority skills \ntraining in the state. The SCF will provide grants to incentivize skills training \nthrough private and public training providers in priority sectors identified through \nskills-gap  analysis,  industry  consultations,  and  demand  assessment.  The \ncapacity of MSSDS to appraise and award funds to qualified training providers, \nenhance quality assurance by establishing a monitoring system, and link up with \nsector skills councils and other NSDC-led PPP initiatives will be strengthened.17    \n(ii)  Incentivizing selected, Meghalaya-based public (e.g., industrial training institutes \nand community polytechnics) and private nonprofit training providers to promote \nplacement-linked  training  and  self-employment  by  upgrading  their  training \nequipment, training their instructors, and improving their curriculum and delivery \nmethods. The providers will enter into an agreement with the MSSDS committing \nto reforming their training methods and partnering with the private sector as \nrequired. The proposals submitted by the providers will be selected through a \ncompetitive process by the project appraisal committee of the MSSDS.  \n \n15.  Output  3:  Increased  awareness  and  participation.  Since  many  of  Meghalaya\u2019s \nschoolchildren are first-generation learners, the project will support this output by establishing \nan effective student counseling and guidance mechanism to persuade SHS students (boys and \ngirls) to complete schooling, acquire soft skills critical for employment, and inform them about \nthe available vocational training options and the corresponding opportunities.

Output 4: Improved project management and monitoring and evaluation. This will \nbe achieved by (i) providing technical support to implement project activities and build capacity; \nand (ii) hiring a research institute or consulting firm to undertake skills-gap analysis and tracer \nstudies to track the results of skills training and learning reforms.  \n  \nD.

The \nDepartment  of  Education  (DOE),  MSSDS,  and  Department  of  Labor  will  be  the  three \n ", "6 \nimplementing agencies. The chief secretary, GOM will be chair of the project steering committee \n(PSC), which will include the additional chief secretary, finance; principal secretary, planning; \nprincipal  secretary,  education;  principal  secretary,  community  and  rural  development;  chief \nexecutive officer, MSSDS; principal secretary, labor; and secretary, Public Works Department \n(PWD). The PSC will meet quarterly to monitor progress, approve the project\u2019s annual budget, \nand provide overall guidance. The project management unit (PMU) will be headed by the \nadditional chief secretary, finance. It will include all PSC members (except the chief secretary) \nplus  the  chief  engineer,  PWD,  and  director,  institutional  finance.  The  commissioner  and \nsecretary, finance, will be the deputy project director. The PMU will be responsible for day-to-\nday coordination, management of project activities, and preparation of progress reports. The \nproject director will be the focal point for issues related to social and environment safeguards. \nTwo project implementation units (PIU) have been established. The first (PIU1) will focus on \nSHS education, while the second (PIU2) will focus on skills development and TVET reform. \nGOM has designated staff members to the PIUs for undertaking functions such as education, \nrural  development,  procurement,  accounts,  finance,  and  planning.  Eleven  district  project \ncoordination units (one for each district) headed by district magistrates will ensure effective \nproject implementation. Detailed implementation arrangements are in the project administration \nmanual (PAM).18   \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  1 January 2014\u201330 September 2018 \nEstimated completion date  September 2018  \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  PSC headed by the chief secretary, Government of Meghalaya  \n(ii)   Executing agency  Department of Finance, Government of Meghalaya  \n(iii)  Key implementing  Department  of  Education;  Meghalaya  State  Skills  Development  Society;  and \nagencies  Department of Labor, Government of Meghalaya  \n(iv)  Implementation unit  In Shillong, capital of Meghalaya  \nPIU1 \u2013 Secondary and Higher Secondary Education; 8 staff designated \nPIU2 \u2013 Meghalaya State Skill Development Society; 6 staff designated \nProcurement  International competitive bidding  2 contracts  $16.1 million \nNational competitive bidding  8 contracts  $29.8 million \nConsulting services  QCBS (90:10) (skills training)  10 contracts  $20.0 million \nQCBS and SSS (teacher  3 contracts amounting to  $3.8 million \ntraining)  $3.4 million (through QCBS) and 2 \ncontracts of $200,000 each through \nSSSa \nQCBS (90:10 basis)  3 contracts  $9.03 million \n  QBS  1 contract  $1.81 million \n  Individual consultants  4 contracts  $0.19 million \nAdvance contracting  The contract for the project management consultant is expected to be issued before \nloan effectivity.  \nDisbursement   The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2012, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed \nupon between the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, PIU = project implementation unit, PSC = project steering committee, QBS = \nquality-based selection, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection, SSS = single-source selection. \na The justification for SSS is provided in the Project Administration Manual, section VI. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n20.  Procurement arrangements. All procurement to be financed under the project will be \ncarried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to \ntime). ADB has approved advance procurement action. The Government of India and GOM \n                                                \n18 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n ", "7 \nhave been advised that approval of advance procurement does not commit ADB to finance the \nproject. The consultants will be engaged in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time).   \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n21.  The TA is estimated to cost $2 million which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJFPR, and administered by ADB. TA will be provided to build capacity of GOM staff deputed to \nthe PMU and PIUs. Manuals will be prepared and the required training provided to ensure that \nGOM officials are able to implement the project, track the performance of skills providers, and \nmonitor compliance. Quality course materials will be prepared for training both male and female \nteachers and skills trainers. Social development (gender) and social safeguards (indigenous \npeople) consultants will sensitize staff of GOM, public and private TVET agencies, and SMCs \nabout the needs and concerns of women and tribal people, and help in the implementation of \nthe  gender  action  plan  (GAP)  and  indigenous  peoples  plan  (IPP).  The  TA  project  profile \nprovides further details.19  \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n22.  Detailed due diligence has been undertaken for this project.  \n \nA.  Technical \n \n23.  Condition assessment has been undertaken for 21 state-aided private schools and two \nTTCs to be upgraded under the project.20 The schools and TTCs were selected from across all \ndistricts of Meghalaya. The design and cost estimates for civil works, equipment, furniture, and \nother facilities have been discussed with the PWD, GOM. The detailed project reports and bill of \nquantities are being prepared by PWD.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial  \n \n24.  The economic benefits for this project are expected to derive from (i) improved quality \nand increased capacity of SHS education in 117 selected government-aided private schools; (ii) \na reduced number of students failing or dropping out as a result of a poor learning environment; \n(iii) improved learning outcomes resulting from teacher training, use of ICT-based modules, and \ncareer counseling; and (iv) enhanced capacity and quality of skills training by increasing the \ninvolvement of private sector providers with a focus on outcomes. The project yields a net \npresent value of $60.7 million. The economic internal rate of return associated with this net \npresent value is 18.6%, assuming a discount rate of 12%.  \n \n25.  The overall effort to enhance human capital development in Meghalaya, as elaborated in \nthe project design, will cost $125 million. Of this amount, $100 million (or 80%) will be funded \nthrough the ADB loan while GOM will provide $25 million (or 20%). The Planning Commission \nhas agreed to allocate $25 million as part of the State Plan for this project over the 12th plan \nperiod (2013\u20132017). Consequently, the project will not put any net additional fiscal burden on \nGOM. The contributions to be made by GOM to the SCF and the school maintenance fund will \nensure sustainability of the benefits beyond the life of the project. \n                                                \n19 Technical Assistance: Capacity Building for Supporting Human Capital Development in Meghalaya (accessible \nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 Sample Condition Assessment of a School (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \n  \nC.  Governance  \n \n26.  A  financial  capacity  assessment  and  procurement  capacity  assessments  were \nundertaken of the DOF, DOE, and MSSDS.21 The financial capacity assessment concluded that \nthe DOF and DOE have well established financial management procedures. However, since the \nMSSDS is a relatively new entity, its financial management systems and procedures need to be \nstrengthened significantly. GOM\u2019s strong commitment to and ownership of needed reforms in \nfinancial management provide a good basis for the required improvements. Capacity building \nassistance will be provided to strengthen the internal controls and operating procedures of the \nMSSDS. The procurement assessment highlighted the need to assist the DOE and PWD in \nundertaking civil works, and the MSSDS in engaging skills training providers. The required \ncapacity building inputs will be provided under the loan and through the JFPR TA. By setting up \nmanagement  information  systems  for  the  DOE  and  MSSDS,  the  project  will  strengthen \ngovernance  and  financial  management  systems  within  the  DOE  and  MSSDS.  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \nGovernment of India and GOM. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the project administration manual.  \n \nD.  Poverty and Social  \n \n27.  Endemic poverty and low levels of some social indicators are major problems facing \nMeghalaya. According to the census of households below the poverty line carried out in 2002, \n48.9% of households state-wide were below the poverty line. The education and health profile of \nwomen in Meghalaya remains relatively poor.22 A detailed ground-level social assessment was \nundertaken during project design, which has guided preparation of the GAP and IPP. The social \nassessment reaffirms strong support for the project since it will improve the quality, delivery, and \naccess of SHS, and TVET programs, especially in underserved districts and blocks. The GAP \nfocuses  on  building  awareness  and  mobilizing  communities  around  education  and  skilled \nemployment for tribal youth (boys, girls); building the capacity of teachers and skill providers on \ngender equality concepts and practices; developing gender-sensitive infrastructure in schools; \nand assisting trained youth, especially women, to avail of employment opportunities. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n28.  The project is categorized B for environment since it will only involve upgrading of the \nbuildings of existing schools and TTCs. Where there is space within existing school premises, \nadditional rooms will be built for grades 11 and 12. The upgrading will improve the overall \nenvironmental management of the buildings in terms of appropriate drainage, handling and \ndisposal  of  sanitary  and  solid  waste,  introduction  of  water  harvesting,  and  seismic \nstrengthening. School buildings located in or near an environmentally sensitive area will not be \nincluded under the project. An environmental assessment and review framework has been \nprepared to guide the future environmental assessment work of upgrading 117 schools and six \nTTCs. Since there will be no land acquisition or resettlement, the project is categorized C for \ninvoluntary resettlement.  \n \n                                                \n21 Procurement Capacity Assessment Report; Financial Capacity Assessment (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n22 In 2007\u20132009, Meghalaya\u2019s maternal mortality rate was 238 per 100,000 live births against the national average of \n212 per 100,000 live births. The infant mortality rate of females per 1,000 live births was 59 in Meghalaya against \n52 for India as a whole in 2009.  \n ", "9 \n29.  The project is classified B for indigenous peoples. The various scheduled tribes together \nconstitute 86% of Meghalaya\u2019s population. To understand the views and aspirations of the \nscheduled  tribes  about  the  activities  proposed  under  the  project,  a  series  of  meaningful \nconsultations were held with durbars and nokmas (councils of tribal elders), women\u2019s groups, \nSMCs, teachers, students, parents, NGOs, skills providers, and government officials during the \ndesign phase. The project was explained to the stakeholders, and their feedback used to \nstrengthen the design. These consultations confirm strong support for both, the education and \nskills development components of the project. It is appreciated that the project will not have any \nnegative effect but instead, have a positive effect by improving youth employability. While the \nentire project has been designed to reach out to all tribal groups, a separate IPP has been \nprepared  to  ensure  that  the  different  tribal  groups  benefit  equitably  and  in  a  culturally \nappropriate manner from the positive effects of the project. \n \n30.  The project director, who is the focal point for all safeguard issues, will be assisted by a \nsocial  safeguards  specialist,  social  development  specialist  (gender),  and  environment \nspecialists who will be hired under the loan. They will oversee implementation of the IPP, GAP, \nand the environmental assessment and review framework. The specialists will also ensure that \ngrievances, if any, are redressed in a timely and effective manner, and that the PMU, PIUs, and \nDPCUs comply with ADB\u2019s information disclosure and consultation requirements.  \n \nF.
