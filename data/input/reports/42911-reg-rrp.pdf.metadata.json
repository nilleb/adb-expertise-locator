Since  its  inception  over  40  years  ago,  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) has invested extensively in infrastructure. This long-term commitment \nto the sector, through both the bank\u2019s public and private sector departments, results from ADB\u2019s \nconviction  regarding  the  critical  importance  of  infrastructure  to  economic  growth  and  poverty \nreduction. \n \n3. \nInfrastructure Needs in Asia. Across ADB\u2019s developing member countries (DMCs), the \nstate  of  infrastructure  (in  the  roads,  water  and  sanitation,  power,  and  telecommunications \nsectors) is often poor. Appendix 1 provides country- and sector-specific information on the state \nof infrastructure in each DMC; highlights of particular sectors in particular countries include:1\n \n\n(i) \n\nRoads.  The  percentage  of  roads  that  are  paved  in  countries  like  Bangladesh \n(23.7%  in  2006)  and  Afghanistan  (9.5%)  is  far  below  the  average  even  for  the \nSouth Asian region (56.9%, which is itself well below other regional averages). In \nthe Kyrgyz Republic, only 11% of the road network is in good condition, with 51% \nin poor or very poor condition.2  \n\n \n(ii)  Water  and  Sanitation.  ADB  DMCs  include  some  of  the  poorest  performers  in \nthe world with regard to access to clean water and sanitation. In Indonesia, piped \nwater supply reaches only 39% of urban dwellers, and only 1.5% have access to \nsewage  coverage. 3  Central  Asia  generally  ranks  relatively  well  with  regard  to \nwater and sanitation, but even there, some areas face challenges; in 2005 in the \nKyrgyz Republic, only 53% of the urban population had access to sanitation.4  \n\n(iii) \n\nPower.  Electric  power  consumption  per  capita  in  many  countries  is  low \ncompared to regional averages, and DMCs across the region often have minimal \naccess to power (e.g., Bangladesh, where 42% of the population has access to \nelectricity,5 and Indonesia, with a 53% electrification rate6), while others (such as \nAzerbaijan) experience power outages on an ongoing basis. \n\n \n\n \n\n(iv) \n\nTelecommunications.  Telecommunications  penetration  rates  are  low  in  many \nDMCs as well, and the proportion of the population that subscribes to fixed line \nand  mobile  services  in many  countries  is  well below  20%\u2014e.g.,  19%  in  Kyrgyz \n\n                                                 \n1  Unless otherwise footnoted, the percentages in this paragraph, available in Appendix 1, are from the World Bank \nGroup\u2019s  \u201cPrivate  Sector  at  a  Glance\u201d  data  tables  from  2006,  available  on  the  World  Bank\u2019s  website  at: \nhttp://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/DATASTATISTICS/0,,contentMDK:21323532~menuPK:1192714~p\nagePK:64133150~piPK:64133175~theSitePK:239419,00.html (March 2009).    \n\n2  ADB.  2007.

Even  in  Malaysia,  a  regional  leader  in  the  quantity  and  quality  of \ninfrastructure, progress needs to be made to meet the country\u2019s own objectives \nin areas like information and communications technology.  \n\n  \nInfrastructure  Investment  Demand.    Worldwide  demand  for  infrastructure  investment \n4. \nis enormous, with estimates of global infrastructure needs by organizations such as ADB,9 the \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation, the World Bank, and the United Nations as high as \n$130  billion\u2013$600  billion  annually.  Estimates  of  infrastructure  demand  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific \nalone are exceptionally large, with some estimates ranging as high as $1 trillion over the coming \ndecade. 10  Using  techniques  applied  in  other  regions,  in  2007  ADB  calculated  that  the  total \ninfrastructure finance requirements for Asia and the Pacific averaged more than $250 billion per \nannum  ($125  billion  in East  Asia,  $76  billion  in  South  Asia,  $42  billion  in  Southeast  Asia,  and \n$12  billion  in  Central  and  West  Asia). 11   Even  removing  the  huge  needs  of  India  and  the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China from the survey totals, well over $50 billion annually is needed for \nthe region\u2019s smaller economies.  \n \nCountry-Specific Investment Needs. Several country-specific examples provide a vivid \n5. \nillustration of the scale of investment needed to build new and maintain existing infrastructure. \nFor  example,  the  World  Bank  has  stated  that  underperformance  of  Pakistan\u2019s  transport \ninfrastructure costs the economy $5 billion a year, and that the aging and inadequate irrigation \nand water infrastructure deficit alone is estimated at an aggregate of approximately $70 billion.12 \nThe Institute on Research and Information Systems for Developing Countries in India estimated \nin  a  February  2009  presentation  that  the  infrastructure  investment  needed  annually  between \n2008  and  2012  was  $11.6  billion  in  Bangladesh,  and  $13.3  billion  in  Pakistan. 13   A  2005 \n                                                 \n7  This  data  is  from  the  World  Bank's  2006  data  set.  ADB  Uzbekistan  Resident  Mission  has  noted  that,  as  of  31 \nDecember 2008, there were 12.7 million mobile subscribers and 1.84 million fixed line subscribers in Uzbekistan.   \n\n8  Central Intelligence Agency. 2009.

Financial Crisis Global Economic Governance and Development. Available: http://www.ris.org.in/.  \n\n 2 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3\n\npresentation  by  the  Indonesian  Coordinating  Ministry  of  Economic  Affairs  identified  the  gap \nbetween investment demand and identified sources of supply to be 62% ($90 billion); most of \nthat gap will have to be closed by the private sector.14 Finally, the United Nations Economic and \nSocial Commission for Asia and the Pacific estimates annual average infrastructure investment \nneeds in Central Asia of $46 billion, or 6.9% of GDP, between 2006 and 2010.15  \n \n6. \nThis  gap  in  infrastructure  investment  means  there  is  a  large  stock  of  infrastructure \nprojects  seeking  financing,  including  greenfield  projects,  upgrades,  expansions,  refinancings, \nbrownfields,  etc.    ADB  itself  receives  much  greater  deal  flow  (investment  proposals)  than  it \ncould conceivably finance with available resources. \n \n7. \nInfrastructure  Finance  Supply.  The  existing  supply  of  infrastructure  finance  does  not \ncome  close  to  meeting  the  scale  of  demand  described  above.  Between  1992  and  2003, \napproximately $280 billion was invested in infrastructure projects in Asia and the Pacific. About \n22%  of  this  came  from  the  private  sector,  70%  from  the  public  sector,  and  8%  from  official \ndevelopment assistance.16 To put this in perspective, the $280 billion of aggregate infrastructure \ninvestment made over the course of a decade is approximately equal to the projected amount \nneeded  in  the  region  per  year  over  the  next  decade.  Aggregate  capital  flows  into  ADB  DMCs \n(i.e., for infrastructure and all other sectors) increased from $32 billion in 2000 to $160 billion in \n2005,  with  private  sector  investors  comprising  an  increasing  percentage  of  that  total  (footnote \n16). The Institute for International Finance substantiates this recent trend, noting that net private \nsector  flows  to  emerging  Asian  markets  has  continued  to  rise,  increasing  from  $259  billion  in \n2006  to  $315  billion  in  2007.17  Private  capital  flows  are  notoriously  capricious,  however,  and \ncontracted sharply in response to the 2008 global financial crisis. The Institute for International \nFinance estimates flows for 2008 at only $96 billion, and projects that they will fall in 2009 to a \nmere  $65  billion. 18   These \nincluding \ninfrastructure\u2014are  tiny  compared  to  the  level  of  demand  in  the  region  for  infrastructure \ninvestment alone. Substantial debt and equity are needed on a long-term basis, both to maintain \nexisting  infrastructure  and  to  build  new  capacity,  and  neither  debt  nor  equity  comes  close  to \nmeeting projected demand. In particular, many countries have great difficulty accessing private \nequity  funding;  these  underserved  countries  include  many  of  the  countries  across  South, \nSoutheast,  and  Central  Asia.  Very  few  funds  globally  have  investment  strategies  that  target \nthese regions.  \n \n8. \nCapital  in  the  Islamic  World.  Great  wealth  exists  in  many  Middle  Eastern  countries, \ngenerated in large part from substantial oil revenues, which have greatly increased the fortunes \nof  high  net-worth  individuals  and  sovereign  wealth  funds.  The  Council  on  Foreign  Relations \nestimates that the sovereign wealth funds in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries19 held $1.2 \ntrillion  in  2008.  This  actually  represented  a  decrease  of  approximately  $100  billion  from  2007, \nreflecting $300 billion of inflow (driven by average oil prices of $100 a barrel throughout 2008), \noffset  by  the  mark-to-market  losses  on  their  equity  portfolios.20  The  size  of  these  funds  may \n                                                 \n14 Infrastructure \n2005. \n\nfigures\u2014which  refer \n\nInfrastructure  Development \n\ninvestable  sectors, \n\nIndonesia. \n\nStrategies \n\nAvailable: \n\nto  all \n\nSummit. \n\nin \n\nhttp://jakarta.usembassy.gov. \n\n15 ESCAP.  2006,  March.

Despite  this  recent  volatility,  great \nwealth  still  resides  in  the  region,  and  investors  are  increasingly  interested  in  channeling  this \ncapital  into  investment  opportunities  that  comply  with  Shari'ah  law  and  values.  Accenture \nestimates that demand for Islamic finance products has grown by up to 15% a year; households \nalone could direct as much as $24 billion of savings per year into Islamic savings products by \n2020. As recently as 2005, however, Shari\u2019ah-compatible traded stocks amounted to only $300 \nbillion, and Islamic mutual funds amounted to only $11 billion.21 In order to attract that money to \nAsian investment opportunities, suitable investment vehicles must exist to tap that capital. \n \n9. \nUnlocking  the  Capital.  Institutional  investors  in  many  Middle  Eastern  countries  that \nmight otherwise have appetite for investment risk in the Fund\u2019s target countries require Shari\u2019ah-\ncompliant investment opportunities, and are thus precluded from investing in traditional private \nequity funds that are not specifically structured to accommodate that requirement. Indeed, the \nnumber of private equity funds set up to accommodate Shari\u2019ah-compliant investment is limited. \nProject sponsors across ADB DMCs, constrained by the general undersupply of risk capital in \ntheir regions (particularly given recent reversals in capital flows), are eager to tap into the large \npools  of  wealth  that  exist  in  many  countries  throughout  the  Middle  East,  but  are  unable  to \naccess that money in the absence of suitably structured funds that can serve as intermediaries \nbetween investors and project sponsors. To help bridge this gap, ADB will collaborate with IDB \nto establish a Shari\u2019ah-compliant private equity fund (the Islamic Infrastructure Fund, L.P., or the \nFund)  to  invest  in  infrastructure  projects  across  those  member  countries  common  to  both \ninstitutions.  By  structuring  the  Fund  to  accommodate  the  needs  of  investors  for  Shari\u2019ah-\ncompliant investment vehicles, the Fund will \u201cunlock\u201d for project sponsors in the target region a \nlarge  pool  of  money  seeking  investment  opportunities.  This  will  in  turn  channel  more  equity \ncapital  into  infrastructure  projects  throughout  the  region,  and  will  also  allow  project  sponsors \nspecifically seeking  Islamic  funding  access  to  financing  tools  structured  around  their  particular \nrequirements. \n \nB. \n \n10. \nGiven  the  crucial  role  of  infrastructure  in  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction,  ADB \nhas  affirmed  its  commitment  to  assist  in  developing  infrastructure  throughout  Asia  and  the \nPacific  in  virtually  all  of  its  strategic  documents,  including  its  long-term  strategic  framework \n2008\u20132020  (Strategy  2020),22  as  well  as  its  specific  country  strategies  and  programs  (CSPs). \nThe project is also aligned with ADB's approach to Islamic finance, and to using private equity \nfunds for specific purposes. \n \n\nConsistency with ADB Strategies and Approaches \n\n1. \n\nLong-Term Strategic Framework \n\n \nThis initiative is fully aligned with ADB\u2019s strategic priorities, as reflected in Strategy 2020, \n11. \nwhich was approved by ADB\u2019s Board in 2008, and which articulates infrastructure as the first of \nfive priority areas for ADB over the next 12 years. Strategy 2020 states that \u201cADB investment in \ninfrastructure  is  fundamental  to  achieving  poverty  reduction  and  inclusive  growth,\u201d 23   and \ntransport  and  communication \nfocus, \nmentions  specific  areas  of  operational \nconnectivity within and between DMCs; energy supply (including clean energy), and promotion \n\nincluding: \n\n                                                 \n21 Accenture. 2007.

It  affirms  the  importance  of  both  public \ninvestment  and  an  expanding  role  for  private  capital  and  markets,  noting  that:  \u201cADB\u2019s \ninfrastructure  operations  will  emphasize  public\u2013private  partnerships  and  private  sector \nengagement.  ADB  will  promote  a  larger  role  for  the  private  sector  in  financing  infrastructure, \neither  as  a  project  sponsor  or  an  institutional  bond  or  equity  investor.  The  latter  role  carries \ngreat promise for augmenting the supply of capital for infrastructure in developing the region.\u201d24 \nThis  project  is  consistent  with  the  long-term  strategic  framework  because  it  positions  ADB  to \nplay  a  catalytic  role  in  mobilizing,  through  the  Fund,  additional  private  sector  resources  into \ninfrastructure projects, alongside the commitments made by ADB and IDB.  \n \n\n2. \n\nCountry Strategies and Programs \n\n \n13. \nexamples from the Fund\u2019s target countries include the following: \n \n\nThe  CSPs  for  virtually  all  ADB  DMCs  identify  infrastructure  as  a  target  sector.

In 2004, ADB provided TA to the Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB), which sets \nregulatory standards for Islamic financial institutions. The TA funded technical experts to work \non  a  number  of  regulatory  concerns,  and  resulted  in  new  transparency  and  market  discipline \nstandards,  financial  soundness  indicators  for  Islamic  institutions,  and  assessments  of  the \npotential  for  Islamic  asset  securitization. 29   ADB  and  IFSB  have  agreed  to  continue  this \ncollaboration under a new TA, approved in March 2009, which aims to follow up on and expand \nupon  earlier  initiatives.30  The  new  TA  will  address  development  of  prudential  and  supervision \nstandards for Islamic financial markets, and is cofinanced by ADB and IFSB; the IFSB funding is \nbeing provided by IDB. To complement regional initiatives, ADB is also working directly with a \nnumber of financial sector regulators, such as in Indonesia and Pakistan, to develop an enabling \nlegal  and  regulatory  framework  for  Islamic  finance.  ADB  has  thus  been  involved  in  several \ninitiatives  that  have  assisted  in  opening  the  Asian  market  to  Islamic  financing  sources.  This \nproject will be ADB's first involvement in parallel private sector efforts to develop the market. \n \n\n4. \n\nUse of a Private Equity Fund \n\n \n15. \nAlthough  substantial  direct  work  in  the  infrastructure  sector  is  undertaken  directly  by \nADB through its public and private sector infrastructure divisions, ADB has elected in this case \nto utilize a fund (or indirect investment) structure. The primary reason for creating a fund is that \nADB is seeking to mobilize Islamic financing capital into the underlying transactions (paras. 8\u20139), \nwhich it would be unable to mobilize into its own conventionally structured transactions. A fund \nstructure permits ADB to mobilize Islamic financing capital into suitable projects in the targeted \ncountries.  Additionally,  the  creation  of  a  fund  that  mobilizes  third-party  capital  (both  private \nsector  commitments  to  the  Fund  and  additional  Islamic  debt  used  in  the  Fund's  transactions) \ngenerates a multiplier effect beyond what could be achieved through direct ADB interventions.  \n \nC. \n\nDevelopment Impact \n \n1. \n\nDevelopment Impact \n\n \nADB's  mission  is  poverty  reduction  in  its  DMCs  and  each  intervention  that  the  bank \n16. \nundertakes should relate\u2014either directly or indirectly, and immediately or over the long-term\u2014to \n                                                 \n29 ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance Completion Report Development of International Prudential Standards for Islamic \nFinancial  Services.  Manila.  Specifically,  the  TA  addressed  a  number of  regulatory  concerns,  including  (i)  gaps  in \nregulatory  frameworks;  (ii)  lack  of  comparability  of  Islamic  financial  products  across  borders;  (iii)  the  risk  of \nregulatory  arbitrage;  (iv)  lack  of  a  level  playing  field  with  conventional  financial  products;  and  (v)  the  absence  of \nreliable data on Islamic financial institutions and countries\u2014or among banks within a country\u2014due to differences in \naccounting  standards  and  weak  accounting  and  auditing  environments.  The  TA  funded  technical  experts  who \nprovided  assistance  to  the  IFSB  to  (i)  develop  a  new  transparency  and  market  discipline  standard  to  more \neffectively address the unique mix of risks that arise from the contractual design of instruments based on Shari\u2019ah \nprinciples,  which  was  subsequently  adopted  after  widespread  consultation  with  IFSB  members;  (ii)  develop  a \ncompilation  guide  for  an  Islamic  financial  database  modeled  on  the  International  Monetary  Fund\u2019s  financial \nsoundness  indicators,  which  was  approved  by  the  IFSB  in  March  2007  and  issued  as  an  IFSB  guide;  and  (iii) \nconduct  a  cross-country  assessment  of  the  legal  framework  for  Islamic  asset  securitization  as  a  first  step  in \ndeveloping an appropriate legal framework. The assessment was presented at the 2007 IFSB annual meeting.  \n30  ADB.  2009.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7\n\n(i) \n\n \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nachievement of that mission. In this transaction, ADB's establishment of and investment in this \ninfrastructure  fund  is  ultimately  intended  to  help  increase  the  set  of  economic  opportunities \navailable to the inhabitants of the Fund's targeted DMCs. This set of linkages, as detailed in the \ndesign and monitoring framework (DMF, see Appendix 2), can be understood as follows: \n \n\nOutput.  The  output  of  the  project  will  be  that  this  Fund  is  established  as \nanticipated in this proposal; that it identifies, screens, and evaluates investment \nopportunities; makes investments; and divests from those projects over time.  \n\nOutcome.  The  outcome  of  the  project  is  an  expanded  and  improved  stock  of \nbasic infrastructure in the Fund's targeted DMCs.  \n\nImpact.  Long-term,  it  is  anticipated  that  accelerated  infrastructure  development \nwill  increase  access  to  economic  opportunities  for  the  inhabitants  of  the  Fund's \ntargeted DMCs. \n\n \nThe  logic  of  the  DMF  implies  that  infrastructure  investment  results  in  economic  growth \n17. \nand  poverty  reduction  through  an  expansion  of  economic  opportunities.  This  logic  can  be \nsummarized as follows:  \n \nInfrastructure and Growth. Infrastructure investment contributes to economic growth in \n18. \na  number  of  ways.  Most  fundamentally,  infrastructure  services,  such  as  transport,  water,  and \nelectricity, are intermediate inputs to production, and any reduction in these input costs raises \nthe profitability of production, thus allowing higher levels of output, income, and/or employment. \nInfrastructure services also increase labor productivity by (i) reducing workers' commuting time, \ntravel  costs,  and  travel  stress  (via  improvements  to  roads  and  bridges);  (ii)  increasing  output \nand  efficiency  via  introduction  of  electricity;  (iii)  increasing  agricultural  productivity  through \ninvestment  in  irrigation  facilities;  (iv)  improving  information  flows  through  telecommunications; \nand  (v)  creating  economies  of  scale  and  scope.  The  links  between  improvements  in \ninfrastructure and economic growth are numerous and apparent. \n \n19. \nEconomic Growth and Poverty Reduction. Economic growth has the effect of raising \nthe  incomes  of  all  members  of  society,  including  the  poor,  thereby  reducing  poverty.  Richard \nAdams,  of  the  World  Bank's  Poverty  Reduction  Group,  summarizes  this  by  stating  that \n\u201c[e]conomic growth reduces poverty in\u2026developing countries\u2026because average incomes of the \npoor  tend  to  rise  proportionately  with  those  of  the  rest  of  the  population.\u201d31  The  relationship \nbetween  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  has  been  consistently  substantiated  by \nempirical evidence.  \n \n20. \nInfrastructure and Poverty Reduction. In addition to the indirect link described above \nthat  ties  infrastructure  to  economic  growth,  and  thereby  to  poverty  reduction,  infrastructure \ninvestment  is  also  more  directly  linked  to  poverty  reduction:  (i)  electricity  and  gas  allow  poor \npeople to heat their homes and cook their food more efficiently, and use electrical appliances to \ngenerate  self-employment  income;  (ii)  roads  and  urban  mass  transit  allow  people  access  to \nemployment and markets, as well as to health and education services; and (iii) clean water and \nsanitation  lead  to  improved  health  outcomes.  These  are  only  a  few  of  the  ways  in  which \ninfrastructure  investment  has  the  potential  to  result  in  improved  socioeconomic  conditions  for \nthe poor.  \n\n                                                 \n31 Adams,  Richard  H.,  Jr..  2003.  Economic  Growth,  Inequality,  and  Poverty:  Findings  from  a  New  Data  Set. \n\nWashington, DC: The World Bank. \n\n \n\n\f 8 \n\n \n\n \n21. \nFurther Developmental Impact. Finally, although the DMF captures only the core logic \nof  this  project  related  to  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction,  there  are  a  number  of \nadditional indirect development outcomes anticipated from the transaction. These include: (i) an \nincreased use of private equity funding in ADB DMCs, 32 and (ii) mobilization of capital from the \nMiddle East into the rest of Asia.33 Indeed, a key developmental aspect of this transaction is that \nADB's  participation  in  the  Fund  will  help  widen  access  to  finance  for  groups  that  would \notherwise  be  unable  to  utilize  Shari'ah-compliant  financing  for  infrastructure  projects,  by \nleveraging new sources of financing into the region. Additionally, ADB's participation and policy \nrequirements will assist in the development of international best practices for Shari'ah-compliant \nfunds.  \n \n\n2. \n\nValue Added by ADB \n\n \n22. \nGeneral.  ADB  will  add  value  to  the  Fund  in  a  number  of  ways.  ADB\u2019s  principal \nadditionality comes in the form of sponsoring and establishing the Fund from the outset; without \nADB\u2019s  support,  the  Fund  would  not  exist.  Through  its  investment,  ADB  will  demonstrate  its \nconfidence  in  the  transaction,  which  may  by  example  encourage  further  investment  by  other \ndevelopment  institutions  and  institutional  investors.  ADB  will  assist  in  deal  sourcing  on  an \nongoing basis, and its seat on the Fund\u2019s investment committee will allow ADB to comment and \nvote on each transaction contemplated by the Fund.  \n \n23. \nEnvironmental  and  Social  Safeguards.  Environmental  and  social  safeguard  (ESS) \nissues are of great importance to ADB, and are an active focus for ADB's private equity funds \nportfolio.  The  Fund  Manager  has  been  an  active  partner  in  ADB's  efforts  to  ensure  the  Fund \ncomplies with ADB\u2019s ESS requirements. Activities in this regard have included: (i) providing the \nFund  Manager  with,  and  incorporating  their  feedback  on,  ADB's  ESS  management  system \nframework; (ii) providing the Fund Manager with guidelines for annual reporting on ESS issues; \n(iii) fielding a mission to Kuala Lumpur to deliver a one-day training on ADB\u2019s ESS policies, and \non  the  Fund's  responsibilities  in  complying  with  those  policies;  (iv)  developing  a  flow  chart \ndelineating  the  responsibilities  of  the  Fund  Manager,  the  portfolio  companies,  and  ADB  in \ncomplying with the relevant policies; and (v) providing samples of standard documents used in \nvarious parts of the process. The Fund Manager will ensure that the Fund's investments comply \nwith  ADB's  ESS  policies.  ADB  will  monitor  the  Fund  Manager\u2019s  compliance  with  ADB  policies \nthroughout the life of the Fund.  \n\n                                                 \n32 The Fund will provide financing specifically in the form of private equity, which confers benefits (such as expertise, \nadvice, mentoring, and strategic inputs) beyond those that accrue to other forms of financing (e.g., debt and public \nequity).  In  Private  Equity  Impact  2008,  Venture  Intelligence  summarizes  the  comments  of  private  equity-funded \ninfrastructure companies regarding the particular advantages of private equity. Those managers stated that private \nequity firms add value in a number of key areas, including: (i) expertise in valuing infrastructure projects, (ii) advice \nin  fine-tuning  business  models,  (iii)  improvements  in  operational  efficiency,  (iv)  strengthening  of  corporate \ngovernance, (v) mentoring for management teams, (vi) assistance in accessing follow-on financing, (vii) expertise \nin tapping public markets, (viii) strategic inputs to identify  new opportunities, and (ix)  working  with regulators and \nthe government to speed up clearances. Venture Intelligence. 2008. Private Equity Impact 2008. Chennai. \n\n33 By structuring this Fund to accommodate the needs of investors for Islamic investment vehicles, and by soliciting \ninvestment from third-party investors, the Fund will help mobilize Middle Eastern capital into productive investment \nopportunities in ADB\u2019s DMCs, thus \u201cunlocking\u201d for Asian project sponsors a large pool of new capital. As described \nabove,  there  are  large  pools  of  untapped  wealth  across  the  Middle  East  in  search  of  appropriate  investment \nopportunities,  with  sovereign  wealth  funds  controlling  trillions  of  dollars  (much  of  it  in  Islamic  countries),  and  oil \nrevenues across the Arab states amounting to hundreds of billions of dollars per year. Investors in these countries \nare increasingly interested in investing in Shari\u2019ah-compliant projects. Asian project sponsors are eager to tap into \nthese  large  pools  of  wealth,  but  are  unable  to  access  this  capital  in  the  absence  of  suitably  structured  Shari\u2019ah-\ncompliant private equity funds that can serve as intermediaries between investors and sponsors. \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED INVESTMENT \n\nOverview \n\nSize. The Fund will have a first closing of $260 million, including an investment of up to \n\n \nA. \n \n24. \nStrategy  and  Objective. The Fund will make strategic, Shari\u2019ah-compliant investments \nin  infrastructure  projects  in  countries  that  have  membership  in  both  ADB  and  IDB,  namely: \nAfghanistan,  Azerbaijan,  Bangladesh,  Indonesia,  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Malaysia, \nMaldives,  Pakistan,  Tajikistan,  Turkmenistan,  and  Uzbekistan,  and  such  other  countries  that \nmay become common member countries of ADB and IDB in the future. The Fund\u2019s sector focus \nwill  comprise  transport;  telecommunications;  energy;  and  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  waste \nmanagement.  \n \n25. \n$100 million from ADB, and a $150 million investment from IDB.  \n \nAnchor  Investors.  As  anchor  investors,  ADB  and  IDB  have  taken  the  lead  in  the \n26. \nstructuring and documentation of the Fund, and will contribute to the operations and governance \nof the Fund in a number of ways. IDB, headquartered in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, is a multilateral \nfinancial  institution  that  started  operations  in  1975,  and  is  owned  by  its  56  member  countries. \nThe  IDB\u2019s  objective  is  to  foster  the  economic  development  and  social  progress  of  member \ncountries and Muslim communities, in accordance with the principles of Shari\u2019ah, or Islamic law. \nThe  functions  of  the  IDB  are  to  participate  in  equity  capital  and  provide  loans  for  productive \nprojects and enterprises, and to provide other forms of financial assistance to member countries \nfor the purpose of economic and social development.   \n \nB. \n \nCIMB  Standard  (the  Fund  Manager).  CIMB  Standard  Islamic  Infrastructure  Fund \n27. \n(General  Partner)  Limited  (the  General  Partner)  is  a  joint  venture  established  by  CIMB  Group \nand Standard Bank, which will act as the general partner of the Fund. The Fund Manager was \nselected  for  this  project  due  to  several  key  competitive  advantages.  It  is  one  of  the  only  fund \nmanagement  teams  in  Southeast  Asia  specifically  focused  on  infrastructure,  and  is  currently \nmanaging  The  South  East  Asian  Strategic  Assets  Fund  L.P.  (SEASAF),  a  private  equity  fund \nfocusing  on  provision  of  growth  and  expansion  capital  to  energy,  infrastructure,  natural \nresources, and associated industries in Southeast Asia. The team has in-depth expertise in core \ninfrastructure,  as  well  as  significant  financial  engineering  expertise  in  investment  structuring. \nCIMB  Standard  is  also  well  positioned  for  deal  sourcing;  deal  referrals  from  CIMB  Group  and \nStandard  Bank  (as  well  as  the  parent  institutions\u2019  strong  presence  in  the  geographic  areas \ntargeted by the Fund) are anticipated to grant the Fund Manager privileged access to deal flow. \nFinally,  due  to  the  Islamic  finance  capabilities  of  its  parent  institutions,  the  Fund  is  well \nestablished to source and execute Shari'ah-compliant transactions. \n \n28. \nCIMB Group. CIMB Group is one of Southeast Asia\u2019s leading universal banking groups, \nand  the  second-largest financial services  provider  in  Malaysia,  with  over  36,000  employees  in \nnine countries. As of year-end 2008, it had total assets of over $55 billion, market capitalization \nof over $6 billion, and revenues of over $2 billion. CIMB Group offers a full suite of services in \nbanking,  capital  markets,  and  asset  and  fund  management.  It  has  financed  the  largest \ninfrastructure  projects  in  both  Malaysia  and  Indonesia,  and  has  received  multiple  awards, \nincluding \u201cBank of the Year,\u201d \u201cBest Investment Bank,\u201d and \u201cBest Equity House,\u201d among others, \nin  2007  and/or  2008.  CIMB  Group\u2019s  high  profile  gives  its  various  businesses  access  to  key \n\nFund Manager \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f 10 \n\n \n\ndealmakers,  and  facilitates  cross-border  deals  due  to  the  depth  of  its  relationships.  Within  its \ncorporate  umbrella,  CIMB  Group  owns  CIMB  Islamic,  a  leading  Islamic  bank  which  has \npioneered  the  development  and  provision  of  a  complete  suite  of  Shari\u2019ah-compliant  services. \nCIMB  Islamic  has  won  international  recognition  for  its  role  in  many  groundbreaking  Islamic \ntransactions, and has structured dozens of Shari\u2019ah-compliant funds. CIMB Group has over $5 \nbillion  in  assets  under  management  (20%  of  which  is  Shari\u2019ah-compliant),  comprising  about \n$4.5 billion in publicly traded funds and $0.5 billion in private equity.34 (See Appendix 3 for more \ndetails on CIMB Group.) \n \n29. \nStandard Bank. Standard Bank is listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and has \na  global  presence  in  38  countries  across  Africa,  Asia,  the  Americas,  Central  and  Eastern \nEurope, and the Middle East, with over 48,000 employees worldwide. It had assets of over $174 \nbillion as at 30 June 2008, and a market capitalization of over $7 billion as at 20 February 2009, \nplacing Standard Bank in the top sixty global banks by market capitalization. It has consistently \nachieved headline earnings growth and return on equity in excess of 20% for 20 years.35 It is an \nestablished  emerging  markets  bank  providing  a  full  spectrum  of  financial  services,  including \nbanking, advisory, capital markets, and investment and asset management services. Standard \nBank was the winner of the \u201cEmerging Markets Bank of the Year\u201d in The Banker Awards in 2007, \nand The Banker\u2019s \u201cBank of the Year\u201d award in multiple African countries in both 2007 and 2008 \n(as  well  winning  other  awards  in  other  years).  The  bank  has  broad  and  deep  infrastructure \nexperience in power, concessions, telecommunications, and export finance. Since 2003, it has \ntransacted over a hundred deals worth in excess of $40 billion in 32 countries, and is the lead \nAfrican  project  finance  franchise,  with  rapid  expansion  into  other  emerging  markets,  including \nCentral Asia. Standard Bank, which focuses its fund management on emerging markets and the \ninfrastructure  sector,  has  over  $2  billion  in  funds  invested  and  under  management,  which  it \nplans to grow to $5 billion in the medium term.36 (See Appendix 3 for more details on Standard \nBank.) \n \nC. \n \n30. \nFund  Manager.  The  Fund  Manager  will:  (i)  provide  general  business  advice,  including \nidentification  of,  and  recommendations  concerning,  investments  and  potential  investments;  (ii) \nsupervise the preparation of and review all documents required to complete each investment; (iii) \nmonitor the performance of each portfolio company; (iv) provide advice and recommendations \nconcerning the disposition of investments; (v) provide strategic and financial planning; and (vi) \nother activities as appropriate. The Fund will have an investment committee, an advisory board, \nand a Shari'ah supervisory board. \n \n\nGovernance Structure \n\n                                                 \n34 CIMB  Group's  previous  experience  with  funds  includes  management  of  CIMB  Mezzanine  Fund,  CIMB  Private \nEquity  Fund  I,  CIMB-Mapletree  Real  Estate  Fund  I,  CAV  Growth  Buyout  Fund,  Commerce  Technology  Ventures \nFund,  Commerce  Agro  Ventures  Fund,  Commerce  Khazanah  Agro  Teroka,  Commerce-KPF,  and  C-Bat  /  I-BAT \nFund. These funds focus or focused on Malaysia and Association of Southeast Asian Nations member countries, \nand in various sectors, including growth capital, buyout, pre-IPO, real estate, and small and medium enterprises. \nCIMB Group thus has institutional commitment to the private equity business. Since these funds were not managed \nby the Fund Manager of this Fund, their full track records have not been presented in this RRP. \n\n35 Normalized for adjustments, unaudited.  \n36 Standard  Bank's  previous  experience  with  funds  includes  management  of  Emerging  Africa  Infrastructure  Fund, \nGuarantCo,  Gulf  Cooperation  Countries  Energy  Fund,  SU  Turkish  Private  Equity  Opportunities  Fund,  Standard \nAfrica Development Fund, and Standard Bank SA proprietary investments. These funds focus or focused on Africa, \nthe Gulf Cooperation Countries, and other emerging markets, and in various products and sectors, including debt \nand mezzanine, guarantees, private equity, and energy and energy-related businesses. Since these funds were not \nmanaged by the Fund Manager of this Fund, their full track records have not been presented in this RRP. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n11\n\nIV. \n\nINVESTMENT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nSocial and Environmental Safeguard Policies \n\n \nA. \n \nADB\u2019s investment in the Fund is classified as category FI (financial intermediary) under \n31. \nADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002), as category C under ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy \n(1995),  and  as  category  C  under  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998).  The  Fund \nManager  will  be  required  to  adopt  an  environmental  and  social  management  system,  and  will \nensure that all investments comply with ADB social safeguards policies, and that all necessary \nassessments  have  been  made  and  appropriate  mitigation  measures  have  been  taken.  In \naddition,  the  Fund  will  not  invest  in  activities  set  out  in  ADB\u2019s  list  of  prohibited  investment \nactivities.  \n \nB. \n \n32. \nThe  Fund  Manager  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to \ndate)  and  the  policy  relating  to  the  Combating  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of \nTerrorism  (2003).  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB will require the Fund Manager to institute, maintain, and comply with internal \nprocedures  and  controls  following  international  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of \npreventing corruption or money laundering activities or the financing of terrorism and covenant \nwith  ADB  to  refrain  from  engaging  in  such  activities.  The  investment  documentation  between \nADB  and  the  Fund  will  allow  ADB  to  investigate  any  violation  or  potential  violation  of  these \nundertakings.  \n \n\nAnticorruption, and Combating Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n33. \nFollowing the approval of the proposed investment by ADB\u2019s Board, ADB will enter into \nsuitable  investment  documentation,  and  ensure  that  such  documentation  and  other  principal \nagreements  relating  to  the  Fund  will  be  on  terms  and  conditions  acceptable  to  ADB  and
