An  environmental  impact  assessment  was  completed  and \nthe  summary  was  circulated  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nBoard of Directors on 16 August 2007. \n \n\n \nProject Description  The  Lanzhou\u2013Chongqing  Railway  (LCR)  Development  Project  is  in \nChongqing  municipality  and  the  northwestern  part  of  Sichuan  and \nGansu  provinces\u2014a  relatively  poor  area.  It  is  designed  to  promote \nsustainable economic growth by building 820 kilometers (km) of railway \nline from Lanzhou, the capital city of Gansu province, to Chongqing. The \nProject will (i) develop an efficient, safe, affordable, and environmentally \nsustainable  railway  transport  system  in  the  region;  and  (ii)  help  create \nmore employment and income-generating opportunities, thus benefiting \npoor residents.  \n \nThe  Project  reflects  ADB\u2019s  operational  strategy  for  the  PRC  railway \nsector,  which \nincludes  reducing  railway  network  constraints  and \npromoting  sustainable  economic  growth  in  poor  areas  not  served  by \nrailways.  The  Project  is  also  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  western \ndevelopment  strategy  of  providing  less-developed  regions  with  better \ninfrastructure  to  facilitate  economic  growth,  thereby  giving  people  a \nbetter opportunity to improve their living standards.  \n\n \nRationale \n\nThe  interior  regions  of  the  PRC  have  not  benefited  as  much  from \neconomic  growth  and  reforms  as  the  east  coast;  in  fact,  the  gap \nbetween  economic  and  social  development  in  those  regions  has \nincreased.  Transport  constraints  and  high  logistics  costs  contribute  to \nthe  economic  disparities  between  the  regions  and  prevent  the  western \nregion from capitalizing on its comparative advantages. \n\nThe Project will be (i) the first north\u2013south railway line linking Chongqing \nmunicipality  and  Gansu,  Shaanxi,  and  Sichuan  provinces;  and  (ii)  the \nshortest  north\u2013south  corridor  linking  Lanzhou,  Baoji,  Yinchuan,  Xining, \nXinjiang,  and  other  major  cities  in  the  north  to  Chongqing,  Chengdu, \nGuiyang,  Kunming,  and  other  ports  and  cities  in  the  south.  The \nproposed alignment for the LCR is shorter by 295 km and 600 km than \nthe  two  existing  routes  between  Lanzhou  and  Chongqing.  Traversing \nGansu,  Shaanxi,  and  Sichuan  provinces  and  Chongqing  municipality, \nthe  proposed  railway  line  will  connect  with  the  Baotou\u2013Yinchuan\u2013\nLanzhou in the northeast; Urumqi\u2013Lanzhou in the northwest on its way \nto  Kazakhstan  and  Europe;  Shanghai\u2013Wuhan\u2013Ankang  in  the  east,  at \n\n \n\n\f \nImpact and \nOutcome \n\nii \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \nProject Investment \nPlan \n \n \n\n \n\nthe \nin \nGuangyuan;  Shanghai\u2013Wuhan\u2013Yichang\u2013Daxian\u2013Chengdu \ncenter;  Yichang\u2013Lichuan\u2013Chongqing,  Chongqing\u2013Guiyang, \nand \nChongqing\u2013Kunming in the south on its way to Viet Nam, Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic  Republic,  and  Southeast  Asia;  and  the  main  lines  Xi\u2019an\u2013\nChongqing  in  the  north,  and  Chongqing\u2013Chengdu  in  the  west.  The \nProject will also help promote regional cooperation, as this north\u2013south \ncorridor  will  be  the  shortest  linking  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  to \nCentral  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  countries  through  the \nPRC. \n \nThe project company, a joint venture of the Ministry of Railways (MOR) \nand the Chongqing municipal, Gansu provincial, and Sichuan provincial \ngovernments, will have substantial managerial and financial autonomy. It \nwill  help  change  railway  enterprises  from  cost  centers  in  a  planned \neconomy  to  profit  centers  in  an  increasingly  competitive  transport \nmarket.  The  components  have  been  formulated  in  line  with  MOR\u2019s \nrailway development plan for 2004. \n \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  an  improved  transport  system  in  the \nregion  that  supports  socioeconomic  development  and  the  western \ndevelopment  strategy.  Providing  economic  railway  transportation  in \nunserved, less-developed, and poor areas will help create the conditions \nfor local resource development, more jobs, and higher incomes and thus \nraise living standards in the project area.  \n \nProject  preparation  was  participatory.  All  the  main  stakeholders\u2014\nvarious affected people, potential beneficiaries, village leaders, women\u2019s \ngroups,  local  ethnic  bureaus,  and  local  governments  in  the  project \narea\u2014were extensively consulted. Household surveys and participatory \nworkshops  in  the  project  area  elicited  public  opinion  about  the  Project \nand useful information for the social and environmental assessments. \n \nThe Project has the following components: (i) the construction of 820 km \nof  double-track  electrified  standard-gauge  class  I  railway  from  Lanzhou \nto  Chongqing;  (ii)  the  construction  of  31  new  railway  stations  complete \nwith  facilities;  (iii)  the  provision  of  modern  technology  and  equipment, \namong  other  initiatives,  to  improve  safety;  (iv)  the  introduction  of  a \nsignaling, communication, and management information system; (v) the \nprovision  of  training  in  the  use  and  maintenance  of  the  modern \nequipment;  (vi)  land  acquisition  and  resettlement;  (vii)  environmental \nprotection  and  mitigation  of  adverse  environmental  effects; \n(viii) consulting  services  for  construction  supervision,  monitoring  and \nevaluation,  and  marketing  and  business  development;  and  (ix)  the \nstrengthening  of  institutional  capabilities.  Project  implementation  will \nrequire these key inputs: civil works, equipment, consultants, and MOR \nand project company staff.  \n \nThe investment cost of the Project is estimated at $8,608.9 million.  \n\n\fFinancing Plan \n\n \nPeriod of \nUtilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency  MOR \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting \nServices \n\nProject Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\n \n\niii \n\nA  loan  of  $300 million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  will  be \nprovided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)\u2013based \nlending facility. The loan will have a term of 27 years including a grace \nperiod  of  7  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  yearly, \nand other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n \nUntil 30 June 2016 \n \n \n31 December 2015 \n\nthe \n\nto  strengthen \n\nimplement  adequate  and \n\nto  ADB.  The  project  company, \n\n \nThe Project will be implemented over 7 years. The Foreign Capital and \nTechnical  Import  Center  under  MOR  will  coordinate  the  tasks  of  the \nfor  procurement, \nproject  management  office  and  be  responsible \nwithdrawals,  and  reporting \nthe \nImplementing  Agency,  will  manage  and  run  the  project  railway,  and \ntransparent  business \ndevelop  and \ndevelopment mechanisms, and accounting and reporting systems.  \n \nMOR  will  procure  ADB-financed  components  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  and \nother items according to government procedures acceptable to ADB.  \n \nThe ADB loan will finance 10 person-months of international consulting \ninstitutional,  marketing,  and  business \nservices \ndevelopment  functions  of  the  project  company.  The  consultants  will  be \nrecruited  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  In  addition,  MOR  will  hire  and \nfor  project  design, \nfinance \nconstruction  supervision,  construction  quality  control,  environmental \nsupervision,  procurement,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  of \nthe \nsafeguard aspects of the Project. \n \nThe  Project  will  (i) provide  the  shortest  land  route  between  Lanzhou, \nLongnan, Guangyuan, and Chongqing\u2014key economic centers of Gansu \nand Sichuan provinces and Chongqing municipality\u2014lowering transport \ncosts  for  railway  users  and  cutting  travel  distances  and  times; \n(ii) increase  the  corridor\u2019s  capacity,  to  the  benefit  of  consumers  and \nproducers  of  goods  and  services,  who  can  avail  themselves  of  timely \nand  efficient  transport  services  and  lower  logistics  costs;  (iii) generate \ndirect  and  indirect  employment  and  other  income-earning  opportunities \nin the project influence area (much local unskilled labor will be hired to \nbuild  and  operate  the  railway);  (iv) broaden  access  to  markets  for  an \narea  that  lacks  cost-efficient  transportation  services;  and  (v) stimulate \nlocal  development  through  small-business  opportunities,  tourism,  and \nrailway station area and other infrastructure development.  \n \n\nthe  services  of  national  consultants \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \n\nThe major project beneficiaries will be (i) the Government, which stands \nto  gain  from  improved  safety  and  a  lower  energy  bill;  (ii)  passengers, \nincluding  tourists,  for  whom  travel  will  be  affordable,  faster,  and  safer; \n(iii) freight  users,  who  switch  from  the  existing  road  and  benefit  from \nmore affordable, faster, and safer trips; (iv) local residents, who will pay \nless for goods and services transported by the project railway; (v) local \nlabor hired to build the railway, supply materials during construction, and \nload and unload goods during operation; (vi) local farmers, who can sell \ntheir products at market prices without having to pay a high margin to a \ntransport  intermediary;  (vii) manufacturers  and  traders,  who  can  set  up \nbusinesses,  produce  more,  and  transport  their  goods  and  services  by \nthe  railway;  and  (viii) local  governments,  which  will  have  greater \nopportunity for local area development and higher tax revenues. \n \nThe  Project  will  benefit  about  16.8  million  people  living  in  the  project \narea. The poverty and social assessment looked at the 28 counties and \ndistricts  in  the  area,  including  15  designated  national  poverty  counties \nand  2,897  designated  poverty  villages.  About  72%  of  the  beneficiaries \nare  rural,  and  17%  are  poor,  with  an  annual  net  income  per  capita  of \nless  than  CNY1,000.  The  links  between  poverty,  difficult  topography, \nand poor transport systems are apparent in the project area. Poverty is \noften caused by geographic remoteness and isolation, limited transport \naccess, high transport costs, and poor access to market information, as \nwell as limited access to health, education, and other social services. \n \nThe  Project  will  give  rise  to  more  jobs  and  income  opportunities.  The \n468,000  or  so  person-years  of  work  during  construction  will  provide \ndirect  employment  for  over  234,000  poor  people,  including women  and \nethnic  minorities.  Railway  station  area  development  will  boost  the \nincomes of communities and produce tax revenues. The development of \nsmall  businesses,  local  industry,  and  tourism  through  the  Project  will \nincrease  opportunities  in  the  future  for  local  people.  Consultations  with \nlocal people in the project area indicated strong support for the Project. \n \nThe  Project  is  financially  and  economically  sustainable.  The  6.98% \nfinancial  internal  rate  of  return  exceeds  the  2.74%  weighted  average \ncost of capital. The economic internal rate of return is 17.09%.  \n \nThe increased tax revenues from the economic development induced by \nthe Project will help finance improvements in social service facilities and \nbasic infrastructure. \n \nThe  construction  of  the  railway,  in  mountainous  areas,  presents  a \nsignificant  technical  challenge.  Construction  could  be  delayed,  cost \nmore than expected, compromise the health and safety of workers, and \nadversely  affect  the  environment.  These  potential  risks  have  been \nassessed and mitigating measures based on lessons learned from other \nrailway projects in the PRC have been provided.  \n \nResettlement will cause the relocation of about 12,000 households. The \nto  minimize  resettlement,  where \nrailway  alignment  was  selected \n\n\f \n\nv \n\nin  hiring \n\nfor \npossible.  Those  resettled  will  be  given  preference \nconstruction,  in  the  supply  of  local  materials,  in  the  allocation  of \ncommercial space near railway stations, and in job training. To mitigate \nthe  potential  social  risks,  resettlement  will  be  implemented  by  local \ngovernments and closely monitored and supervised. \n \nIntermodal  competition  between  railways  and  roads  will  pose  market \nrisks  for  the  project  railway.  However,  the  existing  road  is  in  poor \ncondition  and  congested,  and  the  congestion  will  only  get  worse. \nPassengers and freight shippers surveyed pointed out the advantages of \nrailways  over  other  transport  modes:  lower  fares,  shorter  travel  times, \nsafety,  and  punctuality.  The  increasing  commercial  orientation  of  the \njoint-venture railway will help lessen the market risks. \n \nA  technical  assistance  grant  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $800,000 \nfrom  the  Clean  Energy  Fund  under  the  Clean  Energy  Financing \nPartnership Facility is proposed to assist MOR in preparing the Railway \nSector  Energy  Efficiency  Strategy.  The  technical  assistance  grant  will \nsupport  (i)  an  analysis  of  the  energy  efficiency  of  the  PRC  railway \nsector,  (ii)  the  identification  of  areas  where  energy  efficiency  can  be \nimproved, and (iii) the recommendation of actions and technologies that \ncan be adopted. Areas where energy efficiency can be improved will be \nprioritized and a pipeline of priority lending projects for energy efficiency \nin the PRC railway sector, some of which can be supported by ADB, will \nbe recommended. \n \nConsultants  financed  by  ADB  will  be  recruited  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to \ntime).

The report also describes proposed administration of technical assistance \n(TA) for preparing the Railway Sector Energy Efficiency Strategy, and if the Board approves the \nproposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \nThe design and monitoring framework for the Project is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nFrom  1978,  when  market-oriented  economic  reforms  were  introduced  in  the  PRC,  to \n2007, the country went through sustained rapid economic growth, and a resulting rapid increase \nin  demand  for  transportation.  Passenger  transport  grew  by  9%  yearly  and  freight  transport  by \n7.6%. Railways are the principal mode of freight transport in the PRC, with 47.5% of total freight \nton-kilometers  (ton-km)  in  2006,  followed  by  27.9%  for  inland  waterways  and  sea-to-shore \nshipping,  21.1%  for  roads,  3.3%  for  pipelines,  and  0.2%  for  civil  aviation.  In  2006,  road  traffic \naccounted for 52.8% of total passenger-kilometers (pass-km), followed by railways with 34.5%, \ncivil aviation with 12.3%, and coastal and inland waterways with 0.4%. \n \n3. \nThe railway is the primary mode of long-distance and bulk transport. At the end of 2007, \nthe  PRC\u2019s  78,000  route-kilometers  (route-km)  of  railways  comprised  63,600  km  of  national \nrailways and 14,400 km of joint-venture and local railways. The Ministry of Railways (MOR) runs \nthe state-owned national railway as an integrated system. The joint-venture and local railways, \nregional  lines  within  provincial  boundaries,  are  built  under  provincial  government  or  MOR \nsponsorship to serve local needs and interconnect with the national railway network. Despite its \nlarge size, however, the railway network does not provide adequate coverage for the country\u2019s \npopulation and land area.1  \n \n4. \nPRC railways have the highest freight transport density in the world and second-highest \npassenger transport density after Japan. Locomotive turnover is the highest in the world. From \n1978  to  2007,  railway  freight  increased  from  535  billion  ton-km  to  2,380  billion  ton-km,  or  by \n5.28%  yearly,  and  passenger  traffic  grew  by  6.74%  yearly,  from  109 billion  pass-km  to \n722 billion pass-km. For passenger trips, the average railway journey increased from 134 km in \n1978 to 532 km in 2007, compared with road travel, which grew from 35 km to 55 km over the \nsame  period.  For  freight,  the  average  railway  journey  in  2007  was  757  km,  compared  with \n65 km  for  road  transport.  Yet,  despite  such  growth  rates,  railway  capacity  has  lagged  behind \ndemand  because  of  system  constraints.  Given  the  railways\u2019  important  role  in  economic \ntransportation,  these  constraints,  if  not  removed,  will  continue  to  hamper  efficient  economic \ngrowth. The Government\u2019s aggressive plan to improve railways includes network expansion and \nconstruction in underserved areas. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1  Network density per 1,000 square km of land is one-third that of India and one-tenth that of Japan. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nB. \n \n\n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nGovernment Strategy  \n\n \nThe Government\u2019s railway development policy puts emphasis on (i) removing constraints \n5. \nand expanding the system, (ii) encouraging the construction of joint-venture and local railways \nto promote the development of local economies, (iii) improving the efficiency and safety of the \nexisting  system  by  using  new  technology  and  modern  management  tools  in  planning  and \noperation,  (iv)  reducing  operating  subsidies  through  appropriate  pricing  and  commercialization \nof  services,  (v)  initiating  institutional  and  structural  reforms  to  increase  autonomy  and \naccountability,  and  (vi)  encouraging  nongovernment  investment  in  infrastructure  and  related \nservices.  \n \n6. \nIn  2004,  the  State  Council  approved  a  railway  development  plan  for  the  period  up  to \n2020.  The  plan  seeks  to  expand  the  railway  network  to  100,000  km  by  2020.  Increasing  train \nspeed  is  a major  goal. Priority  will be  given  to the  development  of  railways  in  unserved  areas \nand regions that lack transport and have remained less developed. Route network length in the \nwestern  region  of  the  PRC  will  increase  by  16,000  km,  to  40,000  km,  by  2020.  To  improve \noperating  efficiency,  MOR  has  begun  to  separate  passenger  and  freight  trains  on  key  rail \ncorridors.2  \n \n7. \nThe  11th  Five-Year  Plan  (2006\u20132010)  highlights  railway  development  and  accelerated \nrailway  construction.  It  foresees  (i)  the  construction  of  17,000  km  of  new  lines,  for  a  total \nnetwork  length  of  92,000  route-km;  and  (ii) the  conversion  of  45%  of  the  network  length  into \ndouble-track  electrified  railway.  The  plan  seeks  to  (i)  build  a  dedicated  passenger  railway \nnetwork through the construction of 7,000 km of passenger-dedicated lines by 2010; (ii) develop \ncoal transport corridors by increasing the capacity of the existing lines; (iii) expand the railway \nnetwork  in  the  poor  western  region  (to  34,000  km);  (iv)  build  international  corridors  at  the \nsouthwest and northwest borders; and (v) develop a nationwide intermodal container network. A \ntotal  investment  of  CNY1.5  trillion  (about  $200 billion)\u2014CNY1.25  trillion  for  construction  and \nCNY250 billion for rolling stock\u2014is planned in the 11th Five-Year Plan, of which a total of CNY \n465.2 billion has been spent in 2006 and 2007 (Appendix 3). \n \n\n2. \n\nAsian Development Bank Strategy and Sector Experience \n\n \n8. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  strategy  for  the  railway  sector  is  centered  on \nhelping  (i)  expand  the  railway  system  by  constructing  new  lines  in  unserved,  less-developed \nareas;  (ii) modernize  railways  and  increase  safety  and  capacity,  to  improve  efficiency  on  key \nroutes; (iii) commercialize railway operations to sustain efficient operations; (iv) promote energy \nconservation  and  environmental  sustainability;  and  (v)  increase  railway  competitiveness  in  the \ntransport  sector  through  restructuring  and  reform.  ADB,  the  lead  development  partner  in  the \nPRC  railway  sector,  has  directed  its  energies  to  the  development  of  railways  in  poor, \nless-developed inland provinces to promote sustainable economic growth and reduce poverty.3 \nADB  has  provided  15  loans  totaling  over  $3.0  billion  to  finance  the  construction  of  about \n1,921 km  of  eight  provincial  railways  operated  by  joint  ventures  with  MOR,  5,541  km  of  new \n\n                                                 \n2  ADB  is  financing  the  first  passenger-dedicated  corridor  under  ADB.  2005.

The report concluded that completed railway projects supported general economic growth in the \nregion and led to small areas of high economic growth in towns served by railway stations. \n\n\f3 \n\nrailway lines under the  six national railway projects, and a sector-wide intervention to improve \nsafety  on  the  PRC  railway  network.  ADB  assistance  to  the  sector  has  evolved  from  financing \ncivil works on local railways to supporting major national corridors with much less financing but \nwith  safety,  management \ntechnological \nimprovements.  The  Project,  designed  to  promote  economic  growth  by  providing  railway \ntransportation  in  unserved,  less-developed,  and  poor  areas  of  Chongqing  municipality  and \nGansu,  Shaanxi,  and  Sichuan  provinces,  is  consistent  with  the  PRC\u2019s  development  priorities \nand the ADB strategy. \n \n\ninformation  system,  environmental,  and  other \n\n3. \n\nPolicy Dialogue  \n\n \n9. \nPolicy  dialogue  has  been  a  feature  of  ADB  assistance  to  the  railway  sector  and  has \neffectively complemented the lending operations. Since 2002, ADB has actively engaged MOR, \nthe  National  Development  and  Reform  Commission,  and  the  Ministry  of  Finance  in  policy \ndialogue  and  discussion  and  has  reached  broad  agreement  on  reforms  as  an  engine  for  the \nfurther development of the railways. The railway development plan defines the major goals for \nthe  PRC  railways  to  2020,  and  generally  conforms  with  ADB\u2019s  strategic  agenda.  MOR\u2019s \nproposed  reform  agenda  under  this  plan  involves  (i)  studying  and  learning  from  the  best \ninternational  practices,  (ii)  separating  core  operations  from noncore  transportation businesses, \n(iii) streamlining  the  staff,  (iv)  reforming  the  railway  investment  and  financing  system,  and \n(v) establishing specialized transportation companies.  \n \n10.  MOR  has  taken  a  structured  approach  to  railway  reform.  In  1999,  under  a  new \nmanagement  concept\u2014the  asset  operating  liability  system\u2014MOR  entered  into  management \ncontracts  with  some  railway  administrations  to  improve  profitability  (as  a  pilot  project).  The \ncontracts helped improve operating and financial performance; the approach was later extended \nto  all  the  railway  administrations.  The  separation  of  core  and  noncore  businesses  is  a  key \nelement  of  MOR\u2019s  restructuring  program.  The  total  number  of  employees  in  the  core \ntransportation  business  was  reduced  from  1.89  million  in  1997  to  1.41  million  in  2006.  In  the \nnoncore  transportation  business,  five  large  companies  employing  616,500  staff  have  been \ndivested.  To  provide  jobs  for  redundant  staff,  by  the  end  of  2006,  MOR  had  set  up  3,625 \ndiversified  businesses  (independent  of  the  core  transportation  business)  employing  321,544 \nstaff to supply equipment, goods, and services to the railway industry. In 1998, MOR began a \ncost-sharing  scheme  for  health  insurance  and  pensions  for  railway  employees.  In  2005,  MOR \ncompleted  the  transfer  of  822  primary  and  middle  schools,  46  vocational  schools,  and  181 \nnursery schools, as well as 260 hospitals and medical units, to local governments. One hundred \nbranch  lines  totaling  7,800  km  were  separated  to  improve  productivity  and  reduce  operating \nlosses.  (The  reform  agenda  matrix  is  in  Appendix  4.  Supplementary  Appendix  A  includes  a \nchronology of railway reforms.) \n \nADB  policy  dialogue  with  MOR  deals  primarily  with  (i)  poverty  reduction  as  the \n11. \noverarching  objective  of  ADB  operations,  (ii)  energy  conservation  and  environmental \nsustainability,  (iii) safety  improvements,  (iv)  sector  reforms,  (v)  marketing  and  business \ndevelopment,  and  (vi) private  sector  participation  and  nongovernment  financing.  Fourteen \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  grants  totaling  $6.6  million  have  been  provided  since  1989  for  the \ndevelopment of the emergency management system  on the PRC railway network, institutional \ndevelopment  of  dedicated  passenger  lines  and  local  railways,  tariff  and  organizational  studies \nfor  the  Jing\u2013Jiu  railway,  enhancement  of  commercial  and  business  operations,  marketing  and \nfinancial \nbusiness  development,  human \nmanagement  and  accounting  systems  (Appendix  5).  ADB,  as  the  lead  development  partner, \ncontinues  to  emphasize  further  progress  in  those  areas  and  coordinates  closely  with  other \n\nresource  development,  and \n\nimprovement  of \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\ndevelopment  partners  such  as  the  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement  (AFD),  Kreditanstalt \nf\u00fcr Wiederaufbau, and the World Bank. In recent years, ADB policy dialogue has emphasized \nenhanced safety, environmental sustainability, and energy conservation.  \n \n\na. \n\nPoverty Reduction \n\n \n12. \nThe  strategic  purpose  of  ADB  involvement  in  the  railway  sector  is  to  create  the \nconditions  for  sustainable  economic  growth  that  would  help  improve  living  standards.  The \nProject,  located  in  an  unserved  area,  would  spur  economic  growth  through  improved, \ncost-effective transport access. Identifying ways of intensifying the impact on poverty reduction \nis  an  integral  part  of  project  planning  and  design.  To  this  end,  there  are  provisions  for  (i) the \npreferential  hiring  of  poor  workers,  including  women,  for  the  construction  and  operation  of  the \nLCR; 4 (ii)  the  use  of  locally  produced  materials  that  meet  the  requirements  of  quality  and \neconomy (e.g., sand, stone, cement); (iii) railway station area development; (iv) the building of \nstation  access  roads  and  construction  access  roads;  and  (v) support  for  the  poverty  reduction \nprograms of local governments.5 The Project will finance the construction of access roads to be \nhanded over to the local government after they are built. Local governments have a 5-year plan \nfor improving the road network and transport services in the project area while the Project is in \nprogress.  These  roads  will  reach  all  of  the  province-designated  poverty  villages.  The  Project \nand the development of local roads will increase the welfare gains for the poor, including women, \nand help spread the project benefits to the poverty villages. \n \n\nb. \n\nEnergy Conservation and Environmental Sustainability \n\n \nEnergy conservation and environmental sustainability have been important elements of \n13. \nthe  ADB  policy  dialogue  with  MOR  since  2006,  and  are  also  identified  as  the  two  important \nareas of sustainable development in the 11th Five-Year Plan of the Government. ADB dialogue \nis  helping  to  create  awareness  of  these  two  issues  and  of  factors  like  energy  savings  and \nenvironmental improvements in the performance evaluation of railway administrations and other \nentities.  The  dialogue  encourages  the  use  of  clean  energy  and  energy-efficient  technologies \nand environmental improvements in railway construction, operation, and maintenance. ADB will \nassist  MOR  in  drawing  up  a  strategy  for  making  the  PRC  railways  more  energy-efficient. 6 \nFuel-efficient locomotives, double-stack container trains, \u201cgreen corridors,\u201d environment-friendly \nstation  design  and  waste  disposal,  and \nfuel-efficient,  environment-friendly  safety  and \nmaintenance equipment are part of the project design. This area has been of mutual interest to \nother  development  partners  such  as  the  AFD,  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau  (KfW),  and  the \nWorld Bank. Close coordination has been maintained with them. \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n4  In  the  Guizhou\u2013Shuibai  Railway  Project,  the  poor  composed  41%  of  unskilled  labor  on  average,  and  64%  at  the \npeak  of  construction  (ADB.  1998.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a \nProposed Loan to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Guizhou\u2013Shuibai Railway Project. Manila).  \n\n5  According to the reports on some completed projects, about 40% of the poor at appraisal\u201441% in the case of the \nHefei\u2013Jiujiang  Railway  Project\u2014were  raised  above  the  poverty  line  upon  project  completion  (ADB.  1993.  Report \nand Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina for the Hefei\u2013Jiujiang Railway Project. Manila). \n\n6  An  application  under  the  Clean  Energy  Financing  Partnership  Facility  for  a  technical  assistance  under  the  Clean \nEnergy  Fund  for  PRC:  Preparing  the  Railway  Sector  Energy  Efficiency  Strategy  was  approved  on  29  February \n2008. \n\n\f5 \n\nc. \n\nSafety Improvements \n\nis  an \n\nSafety \n\n \n14. \nintegral  part  of  providing  competitive,  high-quality,  and  reliable \ntransportation  for  people  and  goods.  As  PRC  railways  have  modernized,  introduced  new \nconcepts  and  technologies,  and  increased  speeds,  the  safety  needs  have  changed.  The  11th \nFive-Year Plan of MOR recognizes this important aspect and seeks to attract foreign technology \nand know-how to meet these needs. ADB policy dialogue with MOR emphasizes the need for \nreforms  in  rail  network  operations,  including  safety  in  construction  and  in  operation  and \nmaintenance.  MOR  and  ADB  support  the  objective  of  safety  and  security  on  PRC  railways \nthrough the introduction of modern technologies, policy development, legislation, monitoring and \nenforcement,  and  outreach  activities  (Appendix  6).  Since  2003,  investments  in  railway  safety \nhave  been  part  of  ADB  financing.  ADB  initiated  dialogue  on  the  need  to  adopt  a  sector-wide \napproach rather than a project-based approach to safety. A sector-wide approach is consistent \nwith the network approach to train operations in the PRC and helps provide economies of scale, \nand  better  management  of  emergencies,  accidents,  and  preventive  maintenance.  MOR  has \nadopted the sector-wide approach to safety, and its safety and transportation departments have \nworked closely with ADB to develop a comprehensive plan for the institutional, investment, and \ntraining needs for safety in PRC railways. ADB provided a TA of $500,000 for the development \nof an emergency management system for PRC railways.7 In 2007, ADB approved a $100 million \nloan for improving safety on the PRC railway network.8  \n \n\nd. \n\nSector Reforms \n\n \n15. \nADB is supporting the institutional reform of the railway sector to separate government \nand enterprise functions, giving full play to market forces and increasing the competitiveness of \nthe railways. ADB has actively pursued (i) the separation of the core transport business from the \nnoncore transport business, (ii) the segmentation of passenger and freight services, and (iii) the \nstrengthening  of  the  recently  corporatized  specialized  transportation  companies.  As  part  of \nADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  with  MOR,  three  large  companies  handling  containers,  special  goods, \nand express parcel have been set up.9 The establishment of passenger-dedicated corridors with \na separate institutional structure is a key ADB intervention.10 With ADB assistance, institutional, \nmarketing,  business  development,  and  technical  standards  are  being  worked  out  for  such \ninitiatives and MOR officials are receiving capacity-building support.11  \n \n16. \nThe streamlining of transportation and non-transportation staff is also being pursued. On \n18  March  2005,  under  a  major  restructuring  exercise,  MOR  abolished  41 sub-railway \nadministration bureaus, thereby doing away with one tier of railway management. By the end of \n2007, the number of stations and sections had been reduced from 1,500 to 627. This move has \ntrimmed the staff by more than 22,000 and helped rationalize operations, improve productivity, \n\n                                                 \n7  ADB.  2007.

Recent  ADB  support  for  reforms  in  operations  and  railway  safety \nincludes a sector-wide intervention for the introduction of an emergency management system, \nsafe  and  reliable  technology,  improved  speeds,  dedicated  passenger  and  freight  lines,  a \nmodern  dispatch  control  system,  and  high-quality  information  systems  on  the  PRC  railway \nnetwork.  The  PRC\u2019s  accession  to  the  World  Trade  Organization  has  intensified  competition \namong  the  different  modes  of  transport  and  the  structure  of  transport  demand  is  likely  to \nchange.12 An  ADB  advisory  TA  for  policy  reform  support  to  MOR13 analyzed  (i)  the  conflicting \nroles of meeting social obligations and making profits, (ii) increasing modal competition, (iii) the \nimpact of fast urbanization and economic development, and (iv) demand for better services. As \na lead development partner in the sector, ADB maintains close coordination with AFD, KfW, and \nthe World Bank; and has developed with these institutions a common approach to reforms and \nassistance (Appendix 3).  \n \n\ne. \n\nMarketing and Business Development \n\n \n17. \nAs the PRC progresses toward a market-driven economy, its railways need to compete \non  the  basis  of  price  and  service  quality  for  demand-based  transportation  services.  New \nmarketing  and  business  development  initiatives  are  needed  for  both  freight  and  passenger \nservices to be competitive. In past projects, ADB has financed project-specific studies to create \nmarketing and business development opportunities, including the skills and knowledge needed \nfor market-oriented, profitable operations. ADB is supporting the development of marketing and \nbusiness  strategies  for  dedicated  passenger  lines  (footnote  11),  7,000  km  of  which  will  be \ncompleted by 2010. The first dedicated passenger line from Beijing to Tianjin started operation \nin August 2008 and has adopted recommendations of this TA. The Project will continue these \ninitiatives through a capacity development program for the project company. \n \n\nf. \n\nPrivate Sector Participation  \n\n \nADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  encourages  increased  private  sector  participation  in  the  railway \n18. \nsector.  ADB  is  assisting  MOR  with  a  study  to  examine  opportunities  for  diversified  financing \nsources,  increased  private  sector  involvement,  and  public\u2013private  partnerships  in  the  PRC \nrailways  sector.  In  2005,  MOR  issued  guidelines  to  facilitate  investment  and  financing  system \nreforms, which seek to lower the threshold of investment, encourage the private sector to invest, \nand  attract  strategic  investors  to  railway  financing. 14  Strategic  and  private  investors 15  are \nparticipating  in  the  project  equity  of  the  ADB-financed  Taiyuan\u2013Zhongwei  Railway  Project \n(2006).  The  initial  public  offering  for  the  Daqin  Railway  Company  (CNY15 billion)  and  the \nGuangshen Railway Company16  (CNY10 billion) in 2006 was heavily oversubscribed. In 2007, \nthe  China  Railway  Tielong  Container  Logistics  Company  made  an  additional  public  offering  of \n80 million shares for CNY700 million. \n \nUnder  the  Project,  the  Gansu  and  Sichuan  provinces  are  exploring  the  possibility  of \n19. \ndiversifying financing sources to include strategic and private investors.

The  report  noted  that  ADB\u2019s  strategic \npriorities in the railway subsector were well aligned with the country\u2019s needs. Its overall focus on \nbuilding  railways  with  modern  technologies  met  the  need  to  increase  railway  capacity  and \nreduce  the  persistent  gap  between  supply  and  demand  as  quickly  and  efficiently  as  possible. \nThe priority given by ADB to improving efficiency and commercial orientation and its emphasis \non policy restructuring and reform matched the evolving institutional reforms in railways. \n \nCompleted  and ongoing ADB-financed railway projects in the PRC show the executing \n21. \nagencies\u2019  strong  commitment  and  generally  satisfactory  capabilities  for project  implementation \n(Appendix 7). The speed of implementation has generally exceeded expectations at appraisal, \nand  agencies  have  generally  complied  with  loan  covenants.  Resettlement  and  environmental \nmanagement  have  been  satisfactory.  Audit  covenants  have  been  complied  with  in  a  timely \nmanner,  and  the  audited  financial  statements  have  been  generally  acceptable.  Of  the  15 \nADB-supported railway projects, 10 have been completed, and 5 are being implemented. \n \nThe completed railway projects highlight the need to (i) ensure that the executing agency \n22. \nestablished  for  project  processing,  implementation,  and  operation  has  adequate  capacity; \n(ii) prepare  realistic  traffic  forecasts;  (iii)  review  network-wide  constraints  on  traffic  and  the \nimpact on project viability of existing and planned railway lines and other transportation modes \nthat may compete with project facilities; (iv) make realistic resettlement projections at appraisal; \nand (v) finance railway projects with appropriately determined debt\u2013equity ratios.  \n \n23. \nPrevious  railway  projects  have  contributed  to  socioeconomic  development  in  their \ninfluence areas. Their main impact is as follows: (i) new railway lines in less-developed regions \nhave  stimulated  economic  development,  resulting  in  higher  growth  in  gross  domestic  product \n(GDP)  and  rural  incomes  than  under  the  \u201cwithout-project\u201d  scenario;18 (ii) construction  activities \nhave  created  demand  for  unskilled  labor  and  employment  of  poor  workers,  including  women, \nwho  would  otherwise  have  remained  unemployed  or  underemployed;19 (iii)  service  roads  built \nfor  construction  activities  have  opened  up  and  benefited  rural  communities  in  previously \ninaccessible  areas;  (iv)  domestic  resource  mobilization  has  improved,  providing  additional \n\n                                                 \n17 ADB.  2007.

Manila. \n\n18  In  the  project  area  of  the  Jing\u2013Jiu  Railway,  the  GDP  of  10  counties  in  Jiangxi  province  increased  from \nCNY4.9 billion in 1993 to CNY15.4 billion in 1998, or by 25.5% yearly, compared with 10.2% for the province as a \nwhole.  Rural  income  per  capita  in  Xinfeng  county  increased  from  CNY802  in  1993  to  CNY2,222  in  1998,  or  by \n18.5% yearly, compared with 10.3% in 1985\u20131992 (before the project). \n\n19  The  first  2  years  of  construction  of  the  Guizhou\u2013Shuibai  Railway  generated  about  7.5  million  person-days  of \nemployment. Of this total, 4.1 million person-days, or about 55%, were set aside for local poor people, who were \nthus raised above the poverty line. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nresources  for  social  programs 20  and  generating  employment;  (v)  employment  has  been \ngenerated  as  well  by  the  supply  and  transportation  of  local  materials;  (vi)  improved  and \nlower-cost  transport  (a)  has  lowered  the  prices  of  agricultural  inputs  (such  as  fertilizers)  and \nthus stimulated cash-crop farming and provided more income to farmers, and (b) has increased \nthe  mobility  of  rural  residents  and  allowed  them  access  to  more  markets,  employment \nopportunities, and social services beyond their immediate communities; (vii) counties with new \nrailway access have recorded higher GDP growth rates than other counties; (viii) the investment \nclimate  has  improved,  resulting  in  the  rapid  development  of  secondary  and  tertiary  industries \nthat have generated employment;21 (ix) the consequent shift in the structure of employment from \nlow-productivity  agriculture  to  higher-productivity  agro-processing  and  light  industry  has \nincreased employment opportunities for women and improved their incomes and social status;22 \n(x)  tourism  has  developed  because  of  more  affordable  and  convenient  railway  travel;  and \n(xi) environmental  protection  and  mitigation  measures  have  been  taken  under  the  projects  as \nagreed  at  appraisal,  and  the  environmental  impact  of  induced  developments  has  been \naddressed  according  to  the  environmental  impact  assessments  (EIAs)  for  the  projects.  The \nrailway  projects  have  helped  transform  the  local  economies:  per  capita  rural  incomes  have \nincreased  substantially,  living  standards  have  improved,  and  poverty  has  been  reduced.  The \nlessons learned and experiences gained are incorporated in the design of the current project.  \n \n\n5. \n\nRationale \n\n \n24. \nThe  Project  will  (i)  enhance  capacity  and  reduce  the  bottlenecks  through  network \ndevelopment;  (ii)  improve  energy  efficiency  and  environmental  sustainability  by  providing  a \nmore efficient and environment-friendly mode of transport in the corridor; (iii)  improve safety by \nproviding a reliable and safe mode of transport; (iv) support the PRC railway development plan \nand the western region development strategy; and (v) promote pro-poor economic growth along \nthe  railway  line  and  in  the  region,  thereby  reducing  poverty.  The  project  area  is  largely \nmountainous with abundant natural reserves of coal and other nonferrous materials, and a large \nmanufacturing  industry  and  tourist  sites.  But,  despite  the  abundant  natural  resources,  many \nliving  in  the  area  are  poor.  Because  of  inadequate  transport  services  and  high  costs,  the \neconomic growth needed to reduce rural poverty has not materialized. Local governments and \npeople living in the project area see the railway as a key investment for addressing this problem. \n \n25. \nThe Project is part of the shortest north\u2013south corridor linking Lanzhou, Baoji, Yinchuan, \nXining, Xinjiang, and other major cities in the north to Chongqing, Chengdu, Guiyang, Kunming, \nand  other  ports  and  cities  in  the  south.  The  proposed  alignment  is  shorter  by  295  km  and \n600 km  than  the  two  existing  routes  between  Lanzhou  and  Chongqing.  Traversing  Gansu, \nShaanxi,  and  Sichuan  provinces  and  Chongqing  municipality,  the  proposed  railway  line  will \nconnect with Baotou\u2013Yinchuan\u2013Lanzhou in the northeast; Urumqi\u2013Lanzhou in the northwest on \nits  way  to  Kazakhstan  and  Europe;  Shanghai\u2013Wuhan\u2013Ankang  in  the  east,  at  Guangyuan; \nthe  center;  Yichang\u2013Lichuan\u2013Chongqing, \nin \nShanghai\u2013Wuhan\u2013Yichang\u2013Daxian\u2013Chengdu \nChongqing\u2013Guiyang,  and  Chongqing\u2013Kunming  in  the  south  on  its  way  to  Viet  Nam,  Lao \n\n                                                 \n20  The  financial  revenue  of  10  poverty  counties  in  Jiangxi  province  that  are  traversed  by  the  Jing\u2013Jiu  Railway \nincreased  from  CNY0.5  billion  in  1993  to  CNY1.4  billion  in  1998,  or  by  22.7%  yearly,  compared  with  12.3%  in \n1985\u20131992, before the construction of the railway. \n\n21  The  Jing\u2013Jiu  Railway  facilitated  the  setting  up  of  many  resource-  and  agriculture-based  industries  in  Xingfeng \ncounty of Jiangxi province, from 3 in 1992 to 39 in 1998, after project completion. The number of businesses grew \nfrom 8,005 in 1992 to 19,287 in 1998, and the number of persons employed in these businesses increased from \n18,484  in  1992  to  52,153  in  1998,  or  by  23%  yearly.  In  the  same  county,  the  number  of  people  living  below  the \npoverty line was reduced by 62%, from 30,400 in 1993 to 11,580 in 1998. \n\n22 Beneficial  income  and  social  impact,  particularly  on  women,  was  noted  in  the  influence  areas  of  the  Yaogu\u2013\n\nMaoming Railway and the Guang\u2013Mei\u2013Shan Railway. \n\n\f9 \n\nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic, and Southeast Asia; and the main lines Xi\u2019an\u2013Chongqing in the \nnorth, Chongqing\u2013Chengdu in the west, and Chongqing\u2013Kunming in the south. The Project will \nalso  help  promote  regional  cooperation,  as  Urumqi\u2013Lanzhou\u2013Chongqing\u2013Kunming  will  be  the \nshortest north\u2013south corridor linking the Greater Mekong Subregion to Central Asia and Europe \nthrough  the  PRC,  which  will  generate  a  significantly  larger  volume  of  trade  in  goods  and \nservices. Chongqing is a major manufacturing center for automobiles, motorcycles, chemicals, \nelectrical  items,  and  exports  to  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion.  With  the  development  of  the \nproposed railway, the Chongqing manufacturers intend to promote sales in Central Asia where \nincomes  are  beginning  to  rise  and  the  demand  for  PRC  exports  is  increasing  (Supplementary \nAppendix D). \n \n26. \nThe  Project  and  associated  developments  are  expected  to  stimulate  industrial  and \nnatural  resources  development,  tourism,  and  related  industries,  increase  mobility  and \ninformation  exchange,  generate  employment,  raise  living  standards,  and  help  reduce  poverty. \nThe Project is part of the Government\u2019s program to integrate the development of transportation \nfacilities,  upgrade  highways,  and  construct  links  and  access  roads  to  the  hinterland.  Other \ninfrastructure,  such  as  water  supply  and  investment  to  improve  education  and  health-care \nfacilities, are also planned. The railway will play an important role in facilitating the development \nof this poor and underdeveloped region in the PRC and integrating it with the rest of the country \nand with neighboring countries.  \n \n27. \nThe  Project  will  be  a  joint-venture  railway  owned  and  operated  by  MOR  and  the \ngovernments  of  Gansu,  Sichuan,  and  Chongqing.  An  aggressive  plan  to  develop  the \njoint-venture  railways  has  been  adopted  and  MOR  signed  a  cooperation  agreement  with \n31 provinces and municipalities in 2003 for the development of the railways. By the end of 2007, \n40 joint-venture \ntotaled  CNY960 billion. \nformed  and \nJoint-venture railways, which account for 9,517 km (2007) of the PRC system, have substantial \nmanagerial and financial autonomy, including the freedom to set tariffs, which are several times \nhigher than those on the national network. Freight and passenger traffic have grown faster on \njoint-venture railways than on national railways. From 1996 to 2007, passenger traffic grew from \n2.2  billion  pass-km  to  31.5  billion,  or  by  28%  yearly  (versus  6.8%  on  the  national  railway \nnetwork),  and  freight  traffic  rose  from  12.3  billion  ton-km  to  155.2  billion  ton-km,  or  by  26.5% \nyearly (versus 4.9% on the national railway network). Joint-venture railways are more efficient, \nemploying  only  8\u201310  people  per  km,  compared  with  about  25  people  per  km  for  national \nrailways. The project company will employ 8\u201310 people per km. \n \nThe Project is a key intervention in the railway sector, with many technical, operational, \n28. \nsafety,  environmental,  economic,  and  financial  benefits.  A  corporate  entity  has  been  set  up  to \nconstruct,  operate,  and  manage  the  Project,  which  will  promote  its  financial  viability  and \ncorporate  governance  and  stimulate  participation  from  strategic  and  private  investors.  ADB \nfinancing,  for  its  part,  has  stimulated  cofinancing  from  two  of  the  largest  commercial  banks  of \nthe  PRC.  ADB  is  assisting  with  institutional,  marketing,  and  business  development  for  the \nproject company. The agreed tariffs are more affordable than those for road transport and are \nfinancially  viable.  The  Project  will  bring  in  new  technology  such  as  modern  dispatch  control \nsystems  and  high-quality  information  systems,  and  pursue  improvements  in  operations  like \nhigher  speeds  and  greater  safety  on  the  railway  network.  When  complete,  the  Project  will \nprovide a shorter link from northwest to southwest PRC, release capacity on the existing railway \nlines, and provide an efficient, high-quality, safe, reliable, and environmentally friendly mode of \ntransport in the region.  \n \n\nrailways  had  been \n\ninvestments \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nOutputs \n\nSpecial Features \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  an  improved  transport  system  in  the  region  that \n29. \nsupports socioeconomic development and the western development strategy. It will achieve this \nby  providing  efficient,  affordable,  environment-friendly,  and  energy-efficient \nrailway \ntransportation  in  unserved,  less-developed  areas  to  create  the  conditions  needed  to  develop \nlocal resources and generate employment and income-enhancing opportunities.  \n \nB. \n \nThe  Project  comprises  (i)  the  construction  of  820  km  of  double-track  electrified \n30. \nstandard-gauge  class  I  railway  from  Lanzhou  to  Chongqing;  (ii)  the  construction  of  31  new \nrailway stations complete with facilities; (iii) the provision of modern technology and equipment, \namong  other  safety  initiatives;  (iv)  the  introduction  of  a  signaling,  communication,  and \nmanagement information system; (v) the provision of training in the use and maintenance of the \nmodern  equipment;  (vi)  land  acquisition  and  resettlement;  (vii)  environmental  protection  and \nmitigation  of  adverse  environmental  effects;  (viii)  consulting  services \nfor  construction \nsupervision, monitoring and evaluation, and marketing and business development; and (ix) the \nstrengthening  of  institutional  capabilities.  Civil  works,  equipment,  consultants,  and  MOR  and \nproject company staff are the key inputs needed for project implementation.  \n \nC. \n \n31. \nAdding  Value.  Catalyzing  financing,  setting  up  an  institutional  structure,  and  moving \nahead on reforms are the key value additions of ADB participation. Given the huge investment \nneeds of the Project, ADB has encouraged MOR to tap diverse financing sources. A financing \narrangement  of  50%  in  equity  and  50%  in  long-term  loans  has  been  worked  out.  The  three \nprovinces (Gansu, Sichuan, and Chongqing municipality) are contributing 45% of the equity, a \nsignificant contribution. Encouraged by ADB to explore diverse financing sources for their equity \ncontribution,  Gansu  and  Sichuan  provinces  have  set  up  province-level  investment  companies \nand are exploring the possibility of participation by strategic and private investors. Two domestic \ncommercial  banks\u2014the  China  Construction  Bank  (CCB)  and  the  Industrial  and  Commercial \nBank  of  China  (ICBC)\u2014have  already  committed  cofinancing  of  $4  billion.  Setting  up  a  project \ncompany and proposing specific measures under the Project to outsource some of the activities \nhandled by railways and involve the private sector are other key steps. ADB has engaged MOR \nin dialogue aimed at enhancing policy reform during project processing, and this will continue. \nMOR will also continue to separate the core and noncore activities and streamline its staff. The \nProject will bring in new technology, emphasize safety, and build MOR capacity.  \n \n32. \nEnhancing  Energy  Efficiency.  Railways  as  a  mode  of  transport  are  a  more \nenergy-efficient  and  environmentally  friendly  mode  of  transport.  A  steel  wheel  on  rail  meets \nmuch less rolling resistance than rubber tires on pavement. Some theoretical estimates indicate \nthat rail transport is 6\u201310 times more energy-efficient than road transport. In the United States, \nthe Department of Energy has estimated the energy intensity of rail freight at 345 British thermal \nunits per ton-mile, and road freight at 3,476 British thermal units per ton-mile. 23 This indicates \nthat rail is about 10 times as energy-efficient as truck transport\u2014similar to the estimate made by \n\n                                                 \n23 US Department of Energy. 2004. Transportation Energy Data Book, Edition 24. Oak Ridge, Tennessee: Oak Ridge \n\nNational Laboratory. \n\n \n\n\f11 \n\nincluding \n\nimprovements, \n\nCanadian  researchers.24 The  Project  is  classified  as  a  clean  energy  project.  According  to  the \nInternational Energy Agency report25 and fuel data from the China Statistical Yearbook 2006,26 \nthe diverted traffic from road to rail, and from existing rail to LCR will result in a yearly benefit \n(from  the  reduction  in  fuel  consumption)  of  CNY616  million  in  2015,  increasing  to  CNY1.91 \nbillion in 2034 (for a cumulative total of CNY24.3 billion for 2015\u20132034). \n \n33. \nPromoting  Environmental  Sustainability.  There  is  a  direct  relationship  between \nenergy  consumption  and  emission  of  harmful  pollutants,  and  rail  transport  emits  far  fewer \nharmful elements than road transport. These emissions include carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen \noxides, hydrocarbons, sulfur oxides, and suspended particles. Under the provisions of the Kyoto \nProtocol, a value can be placed on CO2 emissions. Specific fuel use and emission rates for the \nPRC indicate that the diversion of traffic from road to rail will reduce CO2 emissions by 864,280 \ntons  in  2015,  rising  to  1.1  million  tons  in  2020  and  2.0  million  tons  in  2034  (for  cumulative \nsavings of 27.7 million tons in 2015\u20132034), equivalent to a  yearly economic benefit of CNY55 \nmillion in 2015, increasing to CNY128 million in 2034 (for a cumulative total of CNY1.75 billion \nfor  2015\u20132034).  The  Project  will  support  environmental \nthe \ndevelopment  of  a  green  corridor  along  the  proposed  alignment.  For  the  first  time,  ADB  will \nfinance $11.56 million worth of environmental protection equipment. \n \n34. \nPromoting  Intermodal  and  Container  Transport.  The  proposed  railway  will  be  the \nshortest north\u2013south railway link connecting the Greater Mekong Subregion countries with the \nCentral Asia Regional Economic Cooperation countries and Europe through the PRC, and will \nopen up a new and shorter economic corridor. The Project will promote railway and multimodal \ntransportation  in  the  region  by  introducing  double-stack  container  transport  operation  on  an \nelectrified  track,  thereby  reducing  land  use,  increasing  carrying  capacity  by  60%  on  the  same \ntrack, improving energy and environment efficiency by 40%\u201360%, and allowing cargo to move \nmore  quickly,  safely,  and  efficiently.  MOR  will  build  two  extra-large  container  terminals  at \nLanzhou and Urumqi, and container handling facilities at Longnan and Guangyuan to (i) attract \nhigh-value traffic to the railways; (ii) promote intermodal traffic; and (iii) encourage private sector \nshippers and freight forwarders to use the facility to export cargo to and import cargo from other \nparts of the PRC, ports in the southern part of PRC, and Central Asia and Europe in the west. \nThese facilities will be financed by MOR and completed by 2014. \n \n35. \nImproving  Safety.  ADB  policy  dialogue  has  emphasized  the  need  for  operational \nreforms in the rail network, including safety improvements through safe and reliable technology, \nmodern maintenance systems, and safety performance monitoring. A component of the Project \n(worth $36.11 million equivalent, of which $6.65 million will come from the ADB loan) will involve \nthe procurement of operation and maintenance equipment to increase safety and build capacity, \nthrough  staff  training  and  other  activities.  Given  the  large  number  of  tunnels  on  the  proposed \nrailway,  the  project  company  will  prepare  a  tunnel  safety  manual  to  guide  operation  and \nmaintenance. \n \n36. \nIncreasing Private Sector Participation and Strengthening Corporate Governance. \nThe  project  company  will  outsource  through  open  competition  such  activities  as  consulting \nservices  for  construction  supervision,  testing,  construction  contracts,  track  maintenance, \nlogistics facilities, and industrial sidings. Private sector initiatives such as onboard train services, \n\n                                                 \n24 The  Railway  Association  of  Canada.  2001.

The  ADB \npolicy  reform  agenda  in  the  railway  sector  emphasizes  the  restructuring  of  MOR,  the \ncommercialization of operations, support for the management autonomy of railway operations, \nhuman \nfinancial  management  and  accounting  system \nimprovements. Setting up the joint-venture railways in the PRC is a key ADB intervention. Under \nthe Project, a corporate entity has been set up and its capacity development will be supported. \nADB-financed  consulting  services  will  assist  in  strengthening  the  institutional,  marketing,  and \nbusiness development functions of the project company. \n \nSustaining  Stakeholder  Consultation  and  Participation.  Extensive  consultations, \n37. \ntourists, \nincluding  surveys, \nbusinesspersons,  transport  users,  and  local  governments  (Appendix  8).  These  helped  in \n(i) understanding  public  opinion  about  the  proposed  railway;  (ii) conducting  the  environmental, \neconomic, and social assessments; (iii) planning for resettlement; and (iv) identifying the role of \nvarious stakeholders. Leading groups have been formed in the prefectures with the participation \nof  relevant  government  agencies,  including  poverty  reduction  offices,  the  All-China  Women\u2019s \nFederation,  and  health,  civil  affairs,  and  ethnic  affairs  bureaus.  The  local  governments  have \ngiven their assurances that the consultations will continue, to finalize the design and implement \nsocial and environmental measures. \n \n38. \nUndertaking Complementary  Development  Initiatives.  To heighten the development \nimpact  in  the  project  area,  the  local  governments  have  agreed  to  provide  road  access,  good \ndrinking  water,  and  telephone  connectivity  to  all  the  poverty  villages  along  the  alignment.  The \nvarious  provincial  and  local  governments  have  agreed  to  include  these  initiatives  in  their  11th \nfive-year plans. They have agreed in principle to provide electricity to 169 villages, road access \nto 954 villages, drinking water to 1,873 villages, and telephone connections to 696 villages by \nthe end of 2014. The local governments have also agreed to reallocate part of the tax revenue \nto relevant agencies to undertake development programs in the project area.  \n \nD. \n \n39. \nThe  project  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  the  equivalent  of  $8,608.9  million.  Table  1 \nsummarizes  the  project  investment  plan;  details  are  in  Appendix 9.  The  cost  estimates  are \nbased  on  quantities  derived  from  preliminary  engineering  designs  and  unit  rates  reflecting \nmarket  prices  for  goods  and  materials, 27  and  include  the  costs  of  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement, and environmental monitoring.  \n \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n                                                 \n27 Because of the high proportion of bridges and tunnels, the average cost per km for civil works is higher than that \n\nfor other railway projects in the PRC. \n\n\f13 \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan ($ million) \n\nAmounta \n\n \n\n4,372.8 \n542.7 \n335.0 \n55.5 \n36.1 \n282.0 \n336.7 \n108.8 \n251.3 \n62.4 \n53.9 \n6,437.2 \n\n1.

The loan will have a term of 27 years, including a grace \nperiod of 7 years, an interest rate determined according to ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)\u2013based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% yearly, conversion options that \nmay  be  exercised  according  to  ADB\u2019s  loan  regulations  and  conversion  guidelines,  and  other \nterms and conditions set forth in the Loan Agreement. The Government has provided ADB with \n(i) reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of \nthese terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent \ndecision and not made because of any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n41. \nADB will finance all of the contract packages to be procured under the ADB loan; CCB, \nICBC, and MOR will finance the rest of the foreign exchange cost. The local currency cost will \nbe  financed  by  MOR  and  the  provinces,  and  cofinanced  through  a  loan  from  CCB  and  ICBC. \nCCB and ICBC have appraised the Project and submitted their commitment letters to MOR. The \nCCB loan is repayable over 20 years, including a grace period, at a lending rate currently set at \n6.6% yearly. The ICBC loan is repayable over 25 years, including a grace period, at a lending \nrate  of  7.13%  currently.  MOR  will  finance  55%  of  the  equity,  and  the  Gansu  provincial \ngovernment  (GPG),  the  Sichuan  provincial  government  (SPG),  and  the  Chongqing  municipal \ngovernment  (CMG)  will  finance  45%  of  the  equity,  including  the  land  acquisition  and \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nresettlement  costs.

MOR will be the Executing Agency, responsible for overall project implementation. The \nForeign Capital and Technical Import Center (FCTIC), under MOR, will coordinate the tasks of \nthe project management office and be responsible for procurement, withdrawals, and reporting \nto  ADB.  A  project  company  (a  limited-liability  company  under  the  PRC  Company  Law),  with \nheadquarters  at  Lanzhou  has  been  set  up,29 which  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency  for  the \nProject. The project company will (i) assist in the construction of the project railway and manage \nand operate the project railway after its construction; and (ii) develop and implement adequate \nand  transparent  business  development  mechanisms,  and  accounting  and  reporting  systems. \nThe project company is headed by a director general and assisted by an adequate number of \nsuitably  qualified  professional  staff  with  experience  in  railway  engineering,  financial,  and \nadministrative matters, and in the implementation of projects financed by international financial \ninstitutions. The company has set up on-site construction management offices along the project \nroute.  To  develop  the  project  management,  business  development,  and  marketing  capacity  of \nthe project company, assistance will be provided through project-financed consulting services.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n43. \nThe Project will be implemented over about 7 years. The construction will be completed \nin about 6 years (December 2014). Trial operations will start in January 2015 and last for 1 year \nbefore commercial operations begin (Appendix 10).  \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n44. \nAll  ADB-financed  procurement  will  follow  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). ADB will finance the procurement of materials and equipment as \ndescribed in the procurement plan (Appendix 11). Contracts valued at $1 million or more will be \n                                                 \n28 ADB. 2005.

MOR  will  select  tendering  companies  on  a \ncompetitive basis to handle international bidding. The relevant sections of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  will  be  included  in  all  documents  and  contracts  during  the \nbidding for, and implementation of, the Project.  \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n(iv) construction  quality  assurance; \n\n \nThe  Government  will  hire  and  finance  the  services  of  qualified  national  consultants  for \n45. \ntechnical  specifications;  (iii)  construction \n(i) detailed  project  design;  (ii)  preparation  of \nsupervision; \n(v)  environmental  supervision  and \nmanagement;  (vi) monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  resettlement  plan;  and  (vii)  socioeconomic \nimpact assessment, evaluation of poverty reduction, and project performance monitoring. \n \n46. \nThe  ADB  loan  will  be  used  to  finance  10  person-months  of  international  consulting \nservices  to  strengthen  the  institutional,  marketing,  and  business  development  functions  of  the \nproject company. Appendix 12 gives the terms of reference for the international consultants, who \nwill be recruited through quality- and cost-based selection (at an 80:20 ratio) based on simplified \ntechnical  proposals,  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). The provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy will be included in all \ninvitation documents and contracts for international consultants.  \n \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Measures \n\n \n47. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy has been explained to, and discussed with, the Government. \nConsistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB \nreserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  allegations  of  corrupt, \nfraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts, \nrelevant provisions of ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and the \nbidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with \nthe Project will specify the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of MOR, \nthe project company, and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as \nthey relate to the Project. \n \n48. \nIn  relation  to  the  Project,  MOR  will  ensure  that  (i)  a  supervisory  body  is  established  to \nprevent undue interference in business practices, and adequate resources are made available \nfor  its  effective  operation;  (ii)  a  leading  group  of  officials  from  the  discipline  unit  and  the \nsupervision department  of  MOR  is  located  in  offices  involved  in  the  bidding,  construction,  and \nother  operational  activities  under  the  Project;  and  (iii)  periodic  inspections  of  the  contractor\u2019s \nactivities  related  to  fund  withdrawals  and  settlements  are  carried  out.  MOR  and  the  project \ncompany  will  also  initiate  liaison  meetings  with  the  prosecutor\u2019s  office  as  needed,  to  discuss \nwarnings about, or information on, corrupt practices. \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \nThe  ADB  loan  will  be  disbursed  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook \n49. \n(2007, as amended from time to time). Since most payments will be made for large contracts, \ndirect  payment,  reimbursements,  and  commitment  procedures  will  be  used.  The  Government \nwill be reimbursed, according to ADB\u2019s reimbursement procedure, for any eligible expenditure it \ninitially  funds.  To  facilitate  disbursements,  MOR  will  set  up  an  imprest  account 30 at  a  bank \n\n                                                 \n30 Imprest accounts are used in three ongoing loans in the PRC. The utilization performance is satisfactory. \n\n \n\n\facceptable to ADB after the loan becomes effective. The ceiling of the imprest account will be \neither the estimated expenditures for the next 6 months or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is \nless.  To  expedite  funds  flow  and  simplify  documentation,  the  statement-of-expenditure \nprocedure  will  be  used  in  liquidating  and  replenishing  the  imprest  account  and  reimbursing \nthe \neligible  expenditures  of  not  more \nstatement-of-expenditure  ceiling  will  be  reimbursed,  liquidated,  or  replenished  on  the  basis  of \nfull supporting documentation. The financial assessment questionnaire indicates that the Project \nwill have an adequate financial management system in place. Funds from the ADB loan will flow \ndirectly  to  MOR,  the  Executing  Agency,  which  will  be  responsible  for  disbursements  for  the \ncontract packages financed by ADB (Supplementary Appendix C).  \n \n\nthan  $200,000  per  payment.  Payments  over \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n50.  MOR and the project company will maintain separate accounts for the Project and have \nthose  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  audited  annually  by  an  external  auditor \naccording  to  auditing  standards  acceptable  to  ADB.  MOR  and  the  project  company,  through \nMOR, will submit to ADB, within 6 months after each fiscal year, certified copies of the audited \nproject accounts and financial statements and auditor\u2019s reports, all in English. The audit of the \nfinancial  statements  will  include  (i)  an  assessment  of  the  adequacy  of  the  accounting  and \ninternal control systems with respect to project expenditures and other financial transactions, (ii) \nan  assessment  of  compliance  with  loan  covenants  and  ADB  requirements  for  project \nmanagement, and (iii) a separate opinion on the use of the imprest account and statement-of-\nexpenditure  procedures.  The  project  company,  through  MOR,  will  also  submit  its  audited \nfinancial statements covering income statements, balance sheets, and cash-flow statements for \nthe first 3 years of commercial operations of the project railway within 6 months after each fiscal \nyear.  To  ensure  that  an  effective  internal  control  system  and  checks  and  balances  are  put  in \nplace, the project company will establish an internal audit unit within the company. The unit will \nindependently  test  financial  transactions  to  ensure  the  safe  custody  of  the  project-financed \nassets and report directly to the project company\u2019s board of directors. \n \n51. \nThe  project company  will  make  satisfactory  arrangements  for  reporting  the  progress  of \nproject  implementation  by  submitting  quarterly  progress  reports  to  ADB  through  MOR.  Within \n3 months of project completion, MOR will submit a project completion report to ADB.  \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \nA set of indicators for evaluating project performance in relation to its impact, outcomes, \n52. \noutputs,  and  conditions  has  been  agreed  on  with  MOR  and  is  included  in  the  project \nperformance management system. The design and monitoring framework has been developed \nwith the use of the indicators from the project performance management system. The indicators, \nto  be  reviewed  at  the  start  of  project  implementation,  include  (i)  economic  development  and \nsocioeconomic  indicators,  (ii)  transport  costs  and  time  for  passenger  and  freight  services, \n(iii) transport  services  and  transport  charges,  (iv)  accident  rates,  (v)  financial  sustainability, \n(vi) county  and  village  incomes,  (vii)  access  to  social  services,  and  (viii)  jobs  created  in \nconstruction  and  maintenance.  At  the  start  of  project  implementation,  MOR  and  the  project \ncompany  will  establish  baseline  and  target  values  for  the  indicators.  The  indicators  will  be \nmeasured  at  project  inception,  completion,  and  3  years  later,  and  compared  with  the  baseline \n(Appendix  13).  MOR  will  recruit  qualified  consultants  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  to  help \nestablish the monitoring and evaluation system, and train the project company staff in its use. \nThe main sources of data include (i) secondary data from government sources, (ii) a household \n\n16 \n\n \n\n\f17 \n\nsocioeconomic sample survey, and (iii) participatory rapid appraisal. MOR will submit a report to \nADB summarizing the key findings of monitoring at inception, completion, and 3 years later. \n\n \n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n53. \nADB,  MOR,  and  the  project  company  will  carry  out  a  yearly  review  of  the  Project \nincluding  a  midterm  review  in  2012,  covering  all  institutional,  administrative,  organizational, \ntechnical, environmental, social, poverty reduction, resettlement, economic, financial, and other \nrelevant aspects that may have an impact on the performance of the Project and its continuing \nviability. The review will examine progress in sector reforms, policy development, resettlement, \nenvironment, poverty impact, and compliance with covenants in the Loan Agreement.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR PREPARING THE RAILWAY SECTOR \n\nENERGY EFFICIENCY STRATEGY \n\n \n54. \nADB  has  engaged  MOR  on  the  key  issue  of  enhancing  energy  efficiency  on  the  PRC \nrailways, also identified as a key area for action in the 11th Five-Year Plan of the Government, \nwhich has urged MOR to take actions to enhance energy efficiency on the railway system. MOR \nhas  initiated  some  steps  to  achieve  this  reduction;  however,  the  measures  are  local  and  not \ncoordinated. Discussions with MOR highlighted the need for a sector-wide strategy for dealing \nwith this important issue, which would include taking stock of current consumption patterns and \nenergy  conservation  measures,  identifying  the  gaps,  and  recommending  actions  that  can  be \ntaken by MOR. MOR has therefore requested ADB for a TA grant assistance to assist MOR in \npreparing the railway sector energy efficiency strategy. Technical assistance amounting to the \nequivalent of $800,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Clean Energy Fund under the \nClean  Energy  Financing  Partnership  Facility  and  administered  by  ADB. 31  The  study  will \n(i) analyze  the  energy  efficiency  of  the  PRC  railway  sector,  (ii)  identify  areas  where  energy \nefficiency can be enhanced, and (iii) recommend actions and technologies that can be adopted. \nIt will help prioritize areas for enhancing energy efficiency and recommend a pipeline of priority \nlending  projects  for  energy  efficiency  in  the  PRC  railway  sector,  some  of  which  can  be \nsupported by ADB. The TA is outlined in Appendix 14. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACT, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nTraffic Forecast \n\n \n55. \nThe project benefits and impact were assessed along with the potential risks associated \nwith the Project. The combined benefits and impact will outweigh the costs, and net benefits will \naccrue to the project area. \n \nA. \n \nThe traffic forecast is based on forecasts prepared by the First Survey Design Institute \n56. \nand  the  Second  Survey  Design  Institute,  considering  expected  economic  growth,  population \nincrease, tourism development potential, local government development plans, market surveys, \nand the assessment of TA consultants. Passenger volume on the LCR is forecast to grow from \n10.70 billion pass-km in 2015 to 34.19 billion pass-km in 2034, or by an average of 6.3% yearly. \nOn  the  basis  of  similar  factors,  freight  traffic  on  the  LCR  corridor  is  forecast  to  increase  from \nabout 40.14 billion ton-km in 2015 to 88.58 billion ton-km in 2034, for an annual growth rate of \n4.25%.  The  projected  volumes  can  be  accommodated  by  the  LCR  and  justify  project \nconstruction (Appendix 15). \n\n                                                 \n31  Contributors: the governments of Australia and Norway. \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\nB. \n \n57. \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated through a comparison of the \nwith- and without-Project situations. The Project will reduce the cost of transport to and from the \npoor central and northwestern part of Gansu, Shaanxi, and Sichuan provinces and Chongqing \nmunicipality,  and  will  provide  economic  opportunities  in  the  unserved  areas  of  Gansu  and \nSichuan  provinces  (Supplementary  Appendix  D).  Economic  costs  include  construction, \noperation,  and  maintenance  costs,  and  the  value  of  agricultural  production  from  land  lost \npermanently.  Economic  benefits  include  (i) operating  cost  savings  for  freight  and  passenger \ntraffic,  (ii)  time  savings  in  diverted  passenger  traffic  from  buses,  (iii)  transport  benefits \ngenerated, (iv) tourism benefits, (v) shipper savings because of increased railway competition, \n(vi)  road  accidents  avoided,  (vii)  pollution  reduction  benefits,  (viii)  energy  savings,  and \n(ix) national  productivity  benefits.  The  project  EIRR  is  17.09%,  indicating  that  the  Project  is \neconomically viable (Appendix 15). Sensitivity analysis confirms the robustness of the Project\u2019s \neconomic  viability.  Changes  in  the  key  variables,  such  as  a  20%  reduction  in  benefits,  do  not \nsignificantly affect economic viability. The total cost would have to increase by 23% over those \nestimated for the EIRR to fall below the cutoff rate of 12%. Freight benefits would have to fall by \n25%  and  passenger  benefits  by  175%.  Given  ADB\u2019s  experience  in  the  PRC  railway  sector, \nvariations  of  such  magnitude  are  unlikely.  Project  risks  were  quantified  through  the  statistical \nmethod,  i.e.,  considering  the  possible  value  for  key  variables  and  the  probability  of  their \noccurrence. The result shows that the EIRR will exceed 12%, with 100% probability. Distribution \nanalysis, undertaken by determining the project effects for various beneficiaries, indicates that a \nlarge portion of net benefits will accrue to project users and the economy. \n \nC. \n \n58. \nFinancial  projections  prepared  for  the  project  company,  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Financial \nManagement and Analysis of Projects,32 assessed the financial viability and sustainability of the \nrailway (Appendix 16). The projected financial statements indicate that financial revenues will be \nsufficient  to  cover  operation  and  maintenance  costs,  income  taxes,  and  debt  service,  and \nprovide  a  reasonable  rate  of  return.  The  financial  evaluation  was  undertaken  in  real  terms,  in \nconstant 2008 prices. The project cost estimates and financial projections in nominal terms were \nconverted  to  real  terms  by  adjusting  for  the  projected  effects  of  foreign  and  domestic  inflation \nand currency fluctuation. Incremental costs and benefits were derived under with- and without-\nProject  scenarios.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return,  computed  after  tax,  is  6.98%.  This \ncompares favorably with the weighted average cost of capital, also computed after tax, of 2.74%. \nThe Project is both financially viable and sustainable. Sensitivity and risk analyses indicate that \nthe financial internal rate of return for the Project is robust under most conditions. Consolidated \nfinancial  statements  for  the  project  company  have  been  prepared  and  the  project  company\u2019s \nfinancial  performance  is  projected  to  be  sound  and  sustainable  over  the  operating  period \n(Appendix 16). \n \nD. \n \nThe  Project  is  classified  as  ADB  environmental  category  A.  The  First  Survey  Design \n59. \nInstitute  and  the  Second  Survey  Design  Institute  prepared  an  EIA  for  the  Project,  which  was \napproved  by  State  Environmental  Protection  Administration  on  1  August  2008.  MOR  has \nendorsed  the  summary  environmental  impact  assessment,  which  was  circulated  to  the  ADB \nBoard of Directors and uploaded onto the ADB website on 16 August 2007.  \n\nEnvironmental Impact and Assessment \n\nFinancial Benefits  \n\n                                                 \n32 ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f19 \n\nImpact on Poverty  \n\nThe  potential  adverse  environmental  impact  includes  (i)  noise  and  vibration  impact  on \n60. \nnearby  residents;  (ii)  soil  erosion  from  cut  and  fill  activities;  (iii)  impact  on  the  surface  water \nquality  of  adjacent  waterways;  (iv)  impact  on  public  health  and  safety;  and,  (v)  increased \nsedimentation  in  local  waterways  from  spoil  stockpiles.  The  alignment  intersects  (i)  the  Yuhe \nProvincial  Nature  Reserve,  (ii)  the  Maozhai  Provincial  Nature  Reserve,  and  (iii)  the  Jialing \nCity-Level  Wetland  Nature  Reserve.  It  mostly  passes  under  these  reserves  in  deep  tunnels; \nhowever, protected flora and fauna in the nature reserves could be affected. The EIA concluded \nthat the adverse environmental impact can be successfully mitigated through best practices and \nappropriate  technologies.  The  implementation  of  the  environmental  management,  mitigation, \nand  monitoring  programs  included  in  the  EIA  will  ensure  compliance  with  the  environmental \nguidelines  and  procedures  of  ADB  and  the  Government.  Internal  and  external  monitoring  and \naudits  will  see  to  it  that  standards  and  regulations  are  followed.  An  independent  monitoring \nagency will be hired to carry out external monitoring and evaluation during implementation. \n \nE. \n \nThe  railway  will  traverse  28  districts  and  counties  in  the  Gansu,  Shaanxi,  and  Sichuan \n61. \nprovinces  and  Chongqing  municipality;  15  are  designated  national  or  provincial  poverty \ncounties.  The  Project  will  benefit  about  16.8  million  people  in  the  project  area,  of  which \n12.1 million are rural (72%) and 2.9 million are poor (17%). There are 2,897 designated poverty \nvillages in the project area, many of which lack access to potable water, electricity, roads, and \ntelephone (Appendix 17).  \n \n62. \nThe links between poverty, topography, and poor transport systems are apparent in the \nproject area. Poverty in this area is caused by (i) adverse environmental and weather conditions \nand limited farmland (e.g., mountainous terrain, cold weather, water scarcity, and soil erosion); \n(ii) geographical remoteness and isolation, and high transport costs; (iii) limited access to credit \nfor  rural  enterprises;  (iv)  lack  of  access  to  good  social  and  health-care  facilities;  and  (v)  high \ncost of middle- and higher-level education. \n \n63. \nAbout  468,000  person-years  of  work  will  be  created  for  unskilled  laborers  during \nconstruction.  Of  this  total,  50%  or  more,  or  about  234,000  person-years,  with  total  wages  of \nCNY2,105  million,  will  be  targeted  at  the  poor.  The  estimated  construction  tax  revenue  to \ncounties  will  be  reallocated  and  used  for  a  range  of  poverty  reduction  and  social  activities, \nincluding  the  mitigation  of  negative  impact  from  HIV/AIDS  or  sexually  transmitted  infections \n(STIs), human trafficking, and on the environment. The construction of 31 new railway stations, \nto  be  connected  to  the  road  network  accessible  by  all  villages,  including  the  poor,  will  create \nvarious jobs to help distribute the benefits in the project area. There will be sufficient space in \nand  around  the  stations  for  local  area  development,  and  local  governments  will  support  the \npoor, women, ethnic groups, and other vulnerable people in selling local specialties and other \ngoods and services. \n \nF. \n \nThe project railway alignment will cross 275 villages as it passes through 94 townships \n64. \nand 22 districts and counties. An estimated 1,646 hectares of land will be permanently acquired, \nof  which  about  83%  is  now  under  cultivation;  the  rest  is  predominately  forest  land,  residential \nland,  or  wasteland.  The  loss  of  land  will  partially  affect  81,400  persons.  The  impact  is  spread \nthinly  over  a  long  narrow  corridor.33 The  Project  will  temporarily  require  about  1,390  hectares. \n                                                 \n33 Land  use  for  railways  is  much  less  than  for  a  highway  of  equivalent  capacity  (a  double-track  railway  has  the \n\nResettlement Impact  \n\ncargo-carrying capacity of a 16-lane highway).  \n\n \n\n\fImpact on Ethnic Minorities  \n\nAlso, the Project will affect 1.19 million square meters of structures, of which 94% are residential \nstructures; 42,250 persons (12,070 households) will have to be relocated. Aligning the railway \naway  from  urban  areas,  village  centers,  and  other  facilities,  where  possible,  on  the  basis  of \nconsultations with communities, has minimized the impact.  \n \n65.  MOR,  in  consultation  with  the  local  governments,  has  prepared  a  resettlement  plan \nbased  on  the  feasibility  study,  surveys  of  most  of  the  affected  villages,  2,700  household \nsurveys,  and  consultations  with  local  officials,  village  leaders,  and  affected  households.  Local \ngovernment  land  administration  bureaus,  in  conjunction  with  railway  construction  support \noffices, will be responsible for implementing the resettlement; many activities will be carried out \nby township officials and village committees. The estimated resettlement cost is CNY2.1 billion, \nincluding land taxes, administration fees, and contingencies. The summary resettlement plan is \nin  Appendix  18.  MOR  and  municipal-level  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  offices,  in \ncollaboration  with  the  county  resettlement  offices,  will  be  responsible  for  internal  supervision \nand  monitoring.  An  independent  monitor  will  carry  out  the  external  monitoring  and  evaluation, \nand prepare monitoring reports for submission to MOR and ADB.  \n \nG. \n \n66. \nThe  project  area  has  few  ethnic  minority  people  and  only  about  2%  of  the  total \nbeneficiaries,  numbering  about  1,000,  may  be  adversely  affected  by  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement.  The  main ethnic  group  is  Hui,  who  are  quite  integrated  with  the  Han society.  To \ngive further support to ethnic minorities and mitigate any potential social risks, special measures \nhave  been  included  in  the  resettlement  plan  and  social  development  action  plan  (SDAP) \n(Appendix  19).  Ethnic  minorities  will  be  given  preference  in  livelihood  training  and  in  jobs  in \nconstruction  and  operation,  and  targeted  awareness  for  HIV/AIDS  and  other  transmissible \ndiseases and human trafficking.  \n \nH. \n \n67.  Women and other vulnerable groups will benefit from the Project, and have equal access \nto project-generated employment and wages. The railway will generate demand for local labor \nand increase worker productivity and wages. Under PRC law, women are given equal rights in \nemployment.  The  expansion  of  secondary  and  tertiary  industries  will  help  generate  additional \nemployment  opportunities  for  both  men  and  women.  Afforestation  activities  will  provide \nadditional employment opportunities for women relatively close to their homes.  \n \n68. \nThe  construction  and  operation  of  the  railway  could  have  an  impact  on  HIV/AIDS/STIs \nbecause of the large number of workers during construction. HIV/AIDS-infected persons in the \nproject area are much fewer than in other parts of the PRC. Local governments have an active \npublic information program for HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention, including the distribution of \nleaflets and posters, the airing of radio and television programs, and voluntary counseling and \ntesting; these will be continued.  \n \nDuring  construction,  the  county  governments  along  the  alignment  will  raise  public \n69. \nawareness among workers and communities. MOR has experience in ensuring that contractors \nimplement  awareness  and  prevention  programs  during  railway  construction.  Medical  clinics \nhave been established in the area of construction camps, and HIV/AIDS awareness campaigns \nand  preventive  measures  for  workers  and  communities  have  been  organized  during  railway \nconstruction. These activities will continue during the construction and operation of the Project. \n\nSocial and Gender Aspects  \n\n20 \n\n \n\n\f21 \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\nCombined  with  increased  awareness  efforts  by  local  government,  they  will  ensure  that  the \npotential risks of HIV/AIDS/STI transmission are adequately managed. \n \n70. \nAn  SDAP  has  been  prepared  in  consultation  with  local  governments  to  enhance  the \nproject  benefits,  ensure  that  the  adverse  effects  are  avoided  or  mitigated,  and  increase \neconomic development benefits to the poor, women, ethnic minorities, and the vulnerable in an \nequitable and sustainable manner (Appendix 19). The SDAP will (i) enhance job opportunities \nfor  local  people;  (ii)  provide  training  and  vocational  programs  for  the  poor,  women,  ethnic \nminorities,  and  the  vulnerable;  (iii)  support  HIV/AIDS  awareness  and  prevention  programs; \n(iv) support  income  recovery  programs  for  people  affected  by  resettlement;  (v)  provide \nawareness  and  prevention  programs  for  safety  during  construction  and  operation;  and \n(vi) promote local economic development. The SDAP will be implemented with the participation \nof  relevant  government  agencies  at  the  local  level,  including  poverty  alleviation  offices,  the \nAll-China  Women\u2019s  Federation,  and  health,  civil  affairs,  labor,  and  ethnic  affairs  bureaus. \nLeading  groups  have  been  formed  to  continue  the  process  of  consultation  and  coordination \namong various agencies during implementation. \n \nI. \n \n71. \nThe  Project  has  been  formulated  to  minimize  potential  risks.  Traffic  demand  has  been \nestimated conservatively, on the basis of experience with previous railway projects. Sensitivity \ntests indicate that economic circumstances would have to become substantially adverse for the \nProject to lose economic viability. A potential risk is delay in implementation, which would delay \nthe  realization  of  benefits.  MOR  has  successfully  built  railway  lines,  such  as  the  Ganzhou\u2013\nLongyan,  Hefei\u2013Xi\u2019an,  and  Jing\u2013Jiu  railways.  Support  for  the  Project  and  its  preparation  from \nthe  Government,  MOR,  GPG,  SPG  and  CMG  will  help  reduce  the  potential  risk  of \nimplementation delays. Environmental risks will be mitigated by measures in the environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP) and will be closely monitored during project implementation. \n \n72. \nThe  Project  will  cause  the  relocation  of  12,070  households  and  partial  loss  of  land  for \n81,400  people.  The  resettlement  plan  includes  good  compensation  standards,  rehabilitation \noptions, and preferential treatment for employment during construction, supply of local materials, \nallocation  of  commercial  space  near  railway  stations,  and  job  training.  The  resettlement  plan \nand SDAP will be closely monitored to ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s social safeguard policies. \n \n73. \nIntermodal competition among railways and roads will create market risks for the project \nrailway. However, the existing road is already congested and capacity constraints are expected \nto worsen. Traffic surveys indicate that the railway has several advantages: lower fares, shorter \ntravel times, higher safety, and improved punctuality. The increasing commercial orientation of \nthe joint-venture railway will help lower the risks posed by intermodal competition. \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n74. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n(i) \n\nReform  measures.  The  Government  will  take  necessary  measures  to  continue \nimplementation of the Railway Development Plan (2004) including (a) separating \nthe  core  railway  operations  from  noncore  transportation  business  operations, \n(b) rationalizing  staff,  and  (c)  encouraging  the  project  company  to  outsource \nsome activities currently handled by railways, including to the private sector. \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n(v) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nConstruction  quality.  The  Government  will  cause  MOR  and  the  project \ncompany to ensure that the project railway is constructed in accordance with the \nGovernment\u2019s  national  technical  standards,  and  that  construction  supervision, \nquality control, and contract management are carried out satisfactorily. \nConnecting  railway  lines.  The  Government  will  cause  MOR  and  the  project \ncompany  to  ensure  that  (a)  capacity  enhancement  operations  for  connecting \nrailway lines are completed by the commencement of commercial operations of \nthe  project  railway;  and  (b)  necessary  measures  are  promptly  taken  to  mitigate \nany  capacity  constraint  on  connecting  railway  lines,  identified  during  the \noperation of the project railway, to ensure the smooth flow of traffic generated by \nthe project railway. \nContainer  traffic.  The  Government  will  cause  MOR  to  construct  2  extra-large \ncontainer terminals in Urumqi and in Lanzhou, and container handling facilities at \nLongnan and Guangyuan by the commencement of commercial operations of the \nproject railway. \nSupply of rolling stock. The Government will ensure that MOR and the project \ncompany provide sufficient rolling stock, at all times, for the effective operation of \nthe project railway. \nSafety. The Government will cause MOR and the project company to ensure that \nall safety measures are fully implemented with respect to construction, operation \nand maintenance of the project railway in accordance with relevant government \nlaws and regulations. \nSafety  dissemination.  The  Government  will  ensure,  through  MOR,  that  the \nproject  company,  in  cooperation  with  the  local  prefecture,  city,  and  county \ngovernments,  formulates  and  implements  appropriate  public  safety  campaigns \nthrough  media,  public  announcements,  households,  and  schools  to  familiarize \npeople living along the project railway route with safety issues related to railways. \n(viii)  Station access and link roads. The Government will cause the local prefecture, \ncity,  and  county  governments  to  (a)  construct  station  access  roads  in  a  timely \nmanner  prior  to  the  commencement  of  commercial  operations  of  the  project \nrailway, and (b) apply ADB safeguard policies in the construction of such roads. \nFinancial  ratios  and  reporting.  The  Government  will  cause  the  project \ncompany to maintain, starting after the second full year of the commencement of \ncommercial  operations  of  the  project  railway,  (a)  an  operating  ratio  of  not  more \nthan 70%, (b) a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.2, and (c) a debt-equity \nratio  of  not  more  than  65:35  to  ensure  operating  efficiency  and  financial \nsustainability. \nTariff  and  tariff  study.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  MOR  and  the  project \ncompany  set  the  tariffs,  with  respect  to  the  project  railway,  at  rates  sufficient  to \nensure full cost recovery including the management cost of the project company \nthe  project  railway, \nand  working  (operation  and  maintenance)  costs  of \ndepreciation,  debt  service,  taxes,  and  a  reasonable  profit.  The  Government, \nthrough MOR, will also ensure that the project company carries out a tariff study \n6 months prior to the trial operation of the project railway and advises ADB of the \ntariffs applied during such trial operation. \nAnticorruption.  During  project  implementation,  the  Government  shall  follow \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy,  it  being  understood  that  ADB  reserves  the  right  to \ninvestigate  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent, \ncollusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. The Government will cause \nMOR  to  ensure  that  (a)  a  supervisory  body  is  established  for  the  prevention  of \nundue  interference  in  business  practices,  and  adequate  resources  are  made \n\n(ix) \n\n(xi) \n\n(x) \n\n\f23 \n\navailable  for  its  effective  operation;  (b)  a  leading  group  of  officials  from  the \nDiscipline  Unit  and  Supervision  Department  of  MOR  are  located  in  offices \ninvolved  in  the  bidding,  construction,  and  other  operational  activities  under  the \nProject;  (c) periodic  inspections  of  the  contractors\u2019  activities  related  to  fund \nwithdrawals  and  settlements  are  carried  out;  (d)  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  all  bidding  documents  for  the  Project;  and \n(e)  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  include \nprovisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and \naccounts  of  MOR  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service \nproviders  as  they  relate  to  the  Project.  The  Government  shall  also  cause  MOR \nand the project company to initiate liaison meetings with the Prosecutor\u2019s Office, \nas  needed,  where  warnings  about,  or  information  on,  corrupt  practices  can  be \ndiscussed. \nEnvironment.  The  Government  will  cause  MOR,  the  project  company,  GPG, \nSPG, and CMG to ensure that (a) the Project is designed, constructed, operated, \nand  maintained  in  accordance  with  environmental  laws  and  regulations  of  the \nGovernment  and  the  ADB  Environment  Policy  (2002);  (b)  the  EMP  and  the \nmitigation measures included therein, as specified in the project EIA, are properly \nimplemented;  (c)  the  EMP  is  updated  at  the  engineering  design  stage  and \nincorporated  into  bidding  documents  and  civil  contracts;  (d)  any  environmental \npermits,  licenses,  and  clearances  are  obtained  in  a  timely  manner;  and  (e) the \nimplementation  of  the  EMP,  including  any  safety  breaches,  violation  of \nenvironmental  standards,  and  corrective  measures  taken  thereto,  is  reported \nsemiannually to ADB. \n\n(xii) \n\n(xiii)  Land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  Government  will  cause  MOR,  the \nproject company, GPG, SPG, and CMG to ensure that (a) the resettlement plan \nis  updated,  if  necessary,  and  approved  by  ADB  before  the  start  of  land \nacquisition  and  is  carried  out  promptly  and  efficiently  in  accordance  with  all \napplicable government laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement \nPolicy  (1995);  (b)  all  affected  people  are  given  adequate  opportunity  to \nparticipate  in  resettlement  planning  and  implementation;  (c)  those  affected  are \ncompensated  and  assisted  prior  to  displacement  from  their  houses,  land,  and \nassets, such that they will be at least as well off as they would have been in the \nabsence  of  the  Project;  (d) adequate  and  appropriate  support  is  provided  for \nenterprise  relocation;  (e) affected  people  receive  priority  for  employment  in \nproject  construction;  (f) special  measures  are  implemented  for  ethnic  minorities \nand  vulnerable  groups; (g)  civil  works  contracts  include  requirements  to  comply \nwith  the  resettlement  plan;  (h)  the  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plan  is \nmonitored \nlocal \ngovernments,  and  externally  by  an  independent  institute;  and  (i)  related  reports \nare  submitted  to  ADB  and  MOR  as  stipulated  in  the  resettlement  plan.  The \nGovernment  will  cause  MOR,  the  project  company,  CMG,  GPG,  and  SPG  to \nensure  that  (a)  funds  needed  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  including \nthose for cost overruns, are allocated and disbursed in a timely manner; and (b) \nADB is promptly advised of any substantial changes in resettlement impacts. \n\nthe  project  company  and \n\nthe  respective \n\ninternally  by \n\n(xiv)  Poverty reduction and gender development. The Government will ensure that \nMOR  and  the  project  company  initiate  the  contractors  involved  in  project \nimplementation  to  maximize  the  employment  of  local  poor  persons,  including \nethnic  minorities,  who  meet  the  job  and  efficiency  requirements  for  the \nconstruction of the project railway. Such workers will be provided with adequate \non-the-job  training.  Civil  works  contractors  will  comply  with  all  applicable  laws \n\n \n\n\frelating to gender equality. MOR and the project company will (a) implement the \nProject  in  accordance  with  the  SDAP,  and  (b) monitor  the  Project\u2019s  impact  on \npoverty  and  gender  aspects \nthe  collection  and  compilation  of \ngender-disaggregated  data,  where  relevant,  and  submit  annual  monitoring \nreports to ADB during project implementation. \n\nthrough \n\n(xv)  Health  risks.  The  Government  will  cause  MOR  and  the  project  company  to \nensure  that  (a)  contractors  involved  in  project  implementation  disseminate \ninformation on the risks of socially transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS, to \nthe  workers  they  employ  under  the  Project  and  to  local  communities,  through \npublic  awareness  campaigns;  and  (b)  adequate  health  and  treatment  facilities \nare  available  in  the  project  area.  The  Government  will  cause  MOR,  the  project \ncompany,  CMG,  GPG  and  SPG \nis \ndisseminated,  in  consultation  with  the  relevant  health  bureaus,  to  railway \noperating staff. \n\nthat  similar \n\ninformation \n\nto  ensure \n\n(xvi)  Change  in  ownership.

Despite government efforts to increase the country\u2019s transport capacity, \n1. \nserious  constraints  and  bottlenecks  remain,  especially  in  the  road  and  railway  sectors.  By  the \nend  of  2007,  the  PRC\u2019s  railway  system  of  78,000 kilometers  (km)  comprised  63,600  km  of \nnational railways and 14,400 km of joint venture and local railways.  From 1978, when economic \nreforms were first introduced, to 2007, the PRC experienced sustained rapid economic growth. \nThis  resulted  in  a  correspondingly  rapid  increase  in  demand  for  transportation.  Passenger \ntransport grew by 9% yearly and freight transport by 7.6% yearly during the period. Railways are \nthe  principal  mode  of  freight  transport  in  the  PRC,  accounting  for  47.5%  of  total  freight  ton-\nkilometers (ton-km) in 2006, followed by 27.9% for inland waterways and sea-to-shore shipping, \n21.1%  for  roads,  3.3%  for  pipelines,  and  0.2%  for  civil  aviation.  Road  traffic  accounted  for \n52.8%  of  total  passenger-kilometers  (pass-km),  followed  by  railways  with  34.5%,  civil  aviation \nwith 12.3%, and coastal and inland waterways with 0.4%.  \n \n2. \nRecent  Developments.  To  minimize  transport  inefficiencies  and  eliminate  transport \nbottlenecks  that  constrain  efficient  economic  development,  the  Government  increased  its \ninvestment  in  transport  infrastructure  in  the  10th  Five-Year  Plan  (2001\u20132005)  and  the \n11th Five-Year  Plan  (2006\u20132010).  Investment  in  transport  infrastructure  as  a  share  of  gross \ndomestic  product  (GDP)  more  than  doubled  in  the  last  decade.  The  PRC  had  invested \nCNY308 billion  in  capital  construction  to  build  6,458  km  of  new  lines,  provide  3,275 km  of \ndouble lines, and electrify 6,259 km of tracks in the 10th Five-Year Plan. A World Bank study1 \nindicates  that  total  transport  investment  should  increase  to  at  least  3.8%  of  GDP  to  avoid  the \neconomic costs associated with transport constraints. The Government continues to accord high \npriority to transport infrastructure investments to meet the increase in transport demand. \n \nFuture  Development  Priorities  and  Outlook. Substantial investments in the road and \n3. \nrailway  sectors  from  both  domestic  and  international  financing  sources,  including  the  private \nsector, are envisaged in the 11th Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010). The plan continues to emphasize \nrailway  development,  and  seeks  to  accelerate  railway  construction.  It  envisages  (i) the \nconstruction of 17,000 km of new lines, and (ii) the double-tracking and electrification of 45% of \nthe  network  length.  The  plan  seeks  to  (i)  build  a  dedicated  passenger  railway  network  by \nconstructing  7,000  km  of  passenger-dedicated  lines  by  2010;  (ii)  develop  coal  transport \ncorridors by increasing the capacity of the existing lines; (iii) expand the railway network in the \npoor  western  region  (to  34,000  km);  (iv)  build  international  corridors  at  the  southwest  and \nnorthwest  borders;  and  (v)  develop  a  nationwide  intermodal  container  network.  A  total \ninvestment  of  CNY1.5  trillion,  or  about  $200  billion  (CNY1.25  trillion  for  construction  and \nCNY250 billion for rolling stock) is planned in the 11th Five-Year Plan, of which a total of CNY \n465.2 billion has been spent in 2006 and 2007. \n \n4. \nIn 2004, the State Council approved the new railway development plan (up to 2020). The \nplan  seeks  to  expand  the  railway  network  from  74,000 km  in  2004  to  100,000 km  by  2020. \nIncreasing train speed is a major goal.2 Priority will be given to developing railways in unserved \nareas  and  regions  that  lack  transport  and  have  remained  less  developed.  The  route  network \nlength will be increased by 16,000 km to reach 40,000 km in the western region of the PRC by \n\n                                                 \n1  World Bank. 1998. China: Forward with One Spirit: A Strategy for the Transport Sector. Washington, DC (Report \n\nNo. 1595-CHA Transport Sector Unit, East Asia and Pacific Regional Office).  \n\n2  By April 2007, train speed had been increased to over 160 kilometers per hour (km/h) on 14,000 km, and 200\u2013250 \n\nkm/h on 6,000 km of railway lines. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n29 \n\nAsian Development Bank Experience \n\n2020.  The  plan  also  calls  for  separating  passenger  and  freight  traffic  in  heavily  trafficked \ncorridors and for developing 12,000 km of passenger-dedicated corridors by 2020. \n \n5. \nOther  Development  Partner  Operations. In the railway subsector, the Japan Bank for \nInternational Cooperation and the World Bank, in addition to the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nhave been mainly involved in expanding the capacity of national railways. In the past 20 years, the \nJapan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  has  provided  \u00a5578 billion  for  15  railway  projects  to \nexpand  rail  transport  capacity,  particularly  in  major  coal  transport  corridors.  It  has  also  financed \nthe development of new sections of the national railway network in inland provinces. Since 1984, \nthe World Bank has provided 12 loans totaling $2.9 billion for 11 national railway projects and one \nlocal railway project. ADB introduced Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement in 2004 to the PRC \nrailway  and  it  has  provided  2  loans  for  about  $140  million  (Euro  113  million)  for  network \nexpansion. Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau has provided 4 loans for Euro 484 million since 2005. \nAustria  has  provided  a  loan  of  Euro  35  million  in  2006  and  Spain  provided  a  loan  for  Euro  78 \nmillion in 2005. US Export Import Bank has provided two loans of $300 million for procurement of \ntrack equipment since 2003.    \n \nB. \n \n6. \nAssistance  to  the  Sector.  ADB  is  the  lead  lender  and  has  focused  on  improving \ninfrastructure in less-developed and poor regions to promote sustainable economic growth and \nreduce poverty. Since 1989, ADB has provided 15 loans totaling over $3.0 billion to help finance \nthe construction of 1,921 km of new railway lines under eight local railway projects, 5,541 km of \nnew railway lines under six national railway projects, and a sector-wide intervention to enhance \nsafety  on  the  PRC  railway  network.  These  projects  have  introduced  modern  technology  and \nimproved  the  efficiency  of  railway  operation  through  institutional  and  structural  reforms.  ADB \nhas  also  provided  14 technical  assistance  initiatives  totaling  about  $6.6 million  to  promote  the \ncommercial  operation  of  railways,  establish  corporate  governance,  achieve  cost  recovery,  and \nimprove railway management.  \n \nEvaluation of Assistance. The evaluation3 of ADB assistance to the transport sector in \n7. \nthe PRC concluded that ADB\u2019s program for railways was a success. The evaluation noted that \nin  the  railway  subsector  ADB  strategic  priorities  were  well-aligned  with  the  PRC\u2019s  needs.  Its \noverall  focus  on  building  railways  using  modern  technologies  addressed  needs  to  increase \nrailway  capacity  and  reduce  the  persistent  gap  between  supply  and  demand  as  quickly  and \nefficiently  as  possible.  The  priority  given  by  ADB  to  improving  efficiency  and  commercial \norientation, and its emphasis on restructuring and reforming policy was well matched to evolving \ninstitutional reforms in railways. Experience from completed and ongoing ADB-financed railway \nprojects  in  the  PRC  shows  strong  commitment  and  generally  satisfactory  capabilities  of  the \nexecuting  agencies  for  project  implementation.  The  speed  of  implementation  has  often \nexceeded expectation at the time of appraisal. The executing agencies have generally complied \nwith the loan covenants. Resettlement and environmental management have been carried out \nsatisfactorily.  Audited  financial  statements  have  been  submitted  on  time,  and  the  audited \nfinancial statements have been found to be generally acceptable. Of ADB\u2019s 15 railway projects, \n10 are complete, and 5 are under implementation. The projects highlight the need to (i) ensure \nthat the executing agency established for project processing and implementation has adequate \ncapacity;  (ii) prepare  realistic  traffic  forecasts;  (iii) review  constraints  on  traffic  throughout  the \nnetwork,  and  the  impact  on  project  viability  of  existing  and  planned  railway  lines  and  other \ntransportation  modes  that  may  compete  with  the  project  facilities;  and  (iv) finance  railway \n\n                                                 \n3  ADB.  2007.

The railway projects have contributed \nto a dramatic transformation of local economies. Per capita rural incomes in project areas have \nsubstantially  increased.  Living  standards  have  gone  up  and  poverty  has  been  reduced.  The \nproject  performance  audit  report 4  for  the  ADB-financed  Jing\u2013Jiu  railway  project  in  the  PRC \nconcluded that the project was successful and exceeded its original passenger traffic forecasts. \n \nC. \n \nStrategy  and  Priorities.  ADB\u2019s  strategy  for  the  railway  sector  has  three  broad \n8. \nobjectives:  (i) improve  economic  efficiency,  (ii) promote  growth  in  poor  inland  provinces  to \nreduce  poverty,  and  (iii) protect  the  environment  and  manage  natural  resources.  In  pursuit  of \nthese  three  objectives,  the  strategy  supports  the  development  of  efficient  and  integrated \ntransport networks to meet the needs of a growing market economy and contribute to reducing \npoverty through investment targeting poorer areas, coupled with policy and institutional reforms. \nBecause  of  the  importance  of  railway  transport  for  the  development  of  the  national  economy, \nADB\u2019s  strategy  for  the  railway  sector  is  focused  on  (i) expanding  the  railway  system  by \nconstructing new lines in unserved areas that are less developed and poor, (ii) modernizing and \nincreasing  the  capacity  to  improve  transport  efficiency  on  key  routes  of  the  national  railway \nsystem,  (iii) commercializing  railway  operations  to  sustain  efficient  operations,  (iv)  promoting \nenergy \nrailway \ncompetitiveness in the transport system through restructuring and reform.  \n \nPoverty  Reduction. To heighten the poverty reduction impact of transport investments, \n9. \nADB  pays  particular  attention \nin \nless-developed  and  poor  regions  where  new  lines  will  stimulate  economic  development, \n(ii) encouraging the maximization of employment of poor people during project construction and \noperation, (iii) supplying local materials that meet the requirements of quality and economy from \npoor  villages,  and  (iv) providing  station  access  roads  and  link  roads  to  widen  the  reach  of \nproject benefits to poor interior areas. \n \nGovernance and Policy Reform Agenda. The ADB policy reform agenda in the railway \n10. \nsector \nthe \nis  contributing \ncommercialization  of  operations,  the  increased  management  autonomy  of  railway  operations, \nhuman  resource  development,  and  improvements  in  financial  management  and  accounting \nsystems. ADB\u2019s policy dialogue with MOR emphasizes the need for operational reforms for the \nrail  network,  including  enhancing  safety  in  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance.  ADB \nsupports the safety and security objective on PRC railways through the introduction of modern \ntechnologies, policy development, legislation, monitoring, and outreach activities (Appendix 6). \n \n11. \nPrivate  Sector  Development.  The  PRC\u2019s  large  infrastructure  needs  require  local \ngovernments  to  shift  from  traditional  financing  modes  to  the  capital  markets.  In  the  railway \nsector,  a  wider  role  for  the  private  sector  is  envisaged.  MOR  has  taken  steps  to  create  the \nconditions  necessary  to  attract  investments  in  the  project  facilities  and  services  from \nnongovernment and private sector sources. Possible areas include the construction of industrial \nsidings, commercial services, tourism, containerization, and parcel-related businesses. \n \n12. \nRegional  Cooperation.  The  PRC  is  an  active  participant  in  three  regional  cooperation \ninitiatives:  (i) the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion,  through  Yunnan  and  Guangxi  province;  (ii) the \nCentral  Asian  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC)  initiative,  through  the  Xinjiang \n\nthe  Ministry  of  Railways  (MOR), \n\n(i) locating  ADB-financed  projects \n\nthe  restructuring  of \n\nissues: \n\nfour \n\nto \n\nto \n\n                                                 \n4  ADB.  2002.

Since  these  programs \ninvolve the poorer areas of the PRC, expanding regional markets and options could help reduce \npoverty.  The  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  and  CAREC  programs  are  developing  strategies  for \ncooperation  in  transport,  of  which  railway  is  an  important  subsector.  Steps  are  being  taken  to \ndevelop an institutional framework to facilitate the implementation of regional transport projects, \ne.g., Uzbekistan\u2013Kyrgyz Republic\u2013PRC railway development and the Pan-Asian railway project \n(Singapore\u2013Kunming railway link project). \n \nD. \n \n13.  Monitoring  Targets,  Indicators,  Modality,  and  Processes.  The Government monitors \nand  evaluates  sector  performance  annually;  ADB  reviews  this  through  the  process  of  the \ncountry  partnership strategy.  Indicators  for  evaluating  sector  performance  include  (i) economic \ndevelopment  and  poverty  indicators  for  the  western  region;  (ii) transport  density  in  relation  to \nland  area  and  population;  (iii) public  and  private  investment  in  railways;  (iv) transport  demand \nfor freight and passengers with modal split data; (v) level of user charges (railway construction \nsurcharges,  etc.);  and  (vi) cross-border  traffic  volumes  with  the  Central  Asian  republics,  the \nGreater Mekong Subregion, and Mongolia. \n \n\nTable A3: Railway Sector Road Map \n\nIncreasing capacity in key routes \n\n1.

accountability \nDevelop and implement a \nsustainable monitoring \nsystem transferable to other \n\n \n\nThe project was deemed unsuccessful because of a \nshortfall in traffic and resulting low economic internal rate \nof return, poor institutional setup, and operational \nconstraints on the adjacent locally funded section.a The \npost-evaluation highlighted the need to (i) have a fully \nfunctional and committed EA responsible for both \nconstruction and operation at the project planning stage, \n(ii) prepare realistic traffic forecasts, and (iii) ensure an \nadequate institutional setup. However, since post-\nevaluation, the operating performance has improved \nsubstantially because of new management and some \nphysical improvements.  \nPart 1 of the TA assisted the EA with construction \nmanagement. Part 2 helped address the areas of concern \nfor improving operation. However, this assistance was not \nsufficient to overcome problems associated with this \nproject. \n\nThe PCR concluded that the project was a success.b \nTraffic exceeded forecasts and commercial operations \nwere successful. The project area underwent rapid \neconomic growth and substantial social changes after the \nproject. Jobs created in tertiary industry helped women \nimprove their social status. The EA was restructured into \na joint-stock company. An important lesson was the need \nto ensure appropriate capital adequacy for such projects, \nas 100% debt financing is not financially sustainable. \nThe TA supported the establishment of a market-oriented \nand profit-conscious management. The organizational \nstructure was rationalized, corporate profitability \nobjectives were established, and associated management \npolicies were implemented. Computerization aided \nmanagement and financial decision making. \nThe TA helped identify railway projects for development \nof unserved areas. Some have been built. \n\nThe PCR rated the project a success.c Commercial \noperation started 1 year ahead of schedule. Traffic and \nrevenues exceeded forecasts. The railway had a \nsubstantial socioeconomic impact.d Incomes and living \nstandards in the project area were raised and poverty was \nreduced after the project. Employment creation in the \nservice industry increased opportunities for women. Debt \nservicing problems resulting from 100% debt financing \nwere addressed through financial restructuring. Its \nsuccessful financial performance allowed the Guang\u2013\nMei\u2013Shan Railway Company to raise $510 million through \nan initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange \nin 1996.  \nFinance and marketing functions were strengthened, and \ncomputer applications developed to improve management \ninformation systems. The TA helped establish the EA as a \ncommercial entity, focusing on corporate and \norganizational reform, commercial operation, and \neffective information flow. Transfer of knowledge to other \nlocal railways was promoted. \n\nSocioeconomic evaluation showed that the project \nfacilitated economic development in the project area, \nincluding that of tertiary industry, which generated \n\n\fObjectives \n\nprojects and provinces  \n \n \n\n(i) Foster economic growth by \ncompleting part of the second \nrailway from Beijing to \nKowloon \n(ii) Provide essential transport \ninfrastructure in \nless-developed inland \nprovinces  \n\n(i) Promote commercial \ndiscipline in local railway \ncompanies \n(ii) Examine the feasibility of \nlocal railway companies\u2019 \ndiversifying ownership \nthrough broader equity \nparticipation  \n(i) Enhance operational \nefficiency of the Jing\u2013Jiu \nRailway by acquiring modern \nrailway technology and \ndeveloping human resources \n(ii) Support MOR in \nformulating reforms to \nimprove efficiency and \ncommercialize operations  \n(i) Recommend \norganizational arrangements \nfor the commercial operation \nof the Jing\u2013Jiu Railway \n(ii) Formulate a tariff policy \nconsidering alternative routes \n\nProvide economic \ntransportation to facilitate \neconomic growth in northern \nSichuan and reduce poverty \n\n(i) Corporatize the railway \nbureau  \n(ii) Promote \ncommercialization, corporate \nand financial management, \nmarket-based tariffs, and \nhuman resource development \nPromote economic \ndevelopment and reduce \npoverty in northern Shaanxi \nprovince by providing \neconomic transportation  \nConvert SLRC into a \ncorporate entity, and help \nSXRC and SLRC develop \nfinancially commercial \noperations \n\nPromote economic growth \nand create conditions \nnecessary to reduce endemic \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n37\n\nMajor Accomplishments and Lessons Learned \nemployment and promoted the welfare of rural residents. \nThe income of resettled households was increased and \nliving conditions improved. \n \nThe PCR concluded that the project was only partly \nsuccessful because of lower-than-expected traffic.e \nEnvironmental management and resettlement were \ncompleted satisfactorily. The lessons learned were: \n(i) undercapitalization led to high, short-term debt \nfinancing; (ii) traffic forecasts need to be prepared, \nconsidering alternative routes; and (iii) tariffs should \nconsider those on alternative railways. Since 2003, traffic \nhas increased substantially.  \nThe TA helped the railway company improve commercial \norientation and knowledge of market-oriented businesses. \nThe railway company was assisted in forecasting financial \nperformance in 1999\u20132003. The EA was helped in \nassessing the year 2000 readiness of the project facilities \nand taking remedial measures. \n \n\nThe PCR and PPAR concluded that the project was a \nsuccess.f MOR acquired modern technology and \nimplemented organizational and tariff reforms that \nimproved efficiency. The project helped stimulate \neconomic growth in the project area, particularly in the \npoverty counties in Jiangxi province. Per capita income \nincreased substantially and poverty incidence fell. This \nproject also highlighted the need to forecast freight traffic \nmore accurately than it did. \nThe TA concluded that (i) a separate entity for \ncommercial operation of the Jing\u2013Jiu Railway is not \ndesirable, as it would place the Jing\u2013Jiu Railway at a \ncompetitive disadvantage; and (ii) the operation should be \nintegrated with the national network. The proposal for a \nhigher tariff for the north\u2013south corridor, including the \nJing\u2013Jiu Railway, was put into effect.  \nThe PCR concluded that the project was a success and \nhad resulted in rapid economic growth that significantly \nbenefited people living in the project area.g \n\nThe TA identified excessive staffing, undercapitalization, \nand underutilization of assets as problems of local \nrailways in Sichuan. The organizational commitment to \nmeet customer needs was lacking. An action plan to \ndevelop the required business environment is under \nimplementation. \n\nThe PCR concluded that the project was successful and \nhad resulted in rapid economic growth that significantly \nbenefited people living in the project area.h \n\nThe study made recommendations for efficient \ncommercial operation of SXRC and SLRC, including \ncorporatization of SLRC. Other areas covered included \nmanagement information systems, traffic costing, and \ntariffs. Implementation of the action plan developed under \nthe TA is in progress.  \n \nThe PCR rated the project highly successful.i The project \nhelped stimulate economic growth in the project area, \nparticularly in the poverty counties.

The 11th Five-Year Plan of \nthe Government identifies this as a key area for action and has requested MOR to take actions \nto enhance energy efficiency on the railway system. MOR has initiated some steps to achieve \nthis;  however,  these  measures  are  local  and  are  not  coordinated.  A  key  aspect  highlighted  in \ndiscussions with  MOR  is  the  need  for  a  sector-wide  strategy  to  deal  with  this  important  issue, \nwhich  would  include  taking  stock  of  current  consumption  patterns  and  energy  conservation \nmeasures,  identifying  the  gaps,  and  recommending  actions  that  can  be  taken  by  MOR.  MOR \nhas therefore requested ADB for a grant assistance to assist MOR in this important area. The \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  will  assist  MOR  in  developing  a  strategy  for  enhancing  energy \nefficiency and energy conservation.  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe  study  will  (i)  analyze  the  energy  efficiency  of  the  PRC  railway  sector,  (ii)  identify \nareas where energy efficiency can be improved, (iii) recommend actions and technologies that \ncan be adopted, and (iv) develop a national railway sector energy efficiency strategy. It will help \nprioritize  areas  for  enhancing  energy  efficiency  and  recommend  a  pipeline  of  priority  lending \nprojects  for  energy  efficiency  in  the  PRC  railway  sector,  some  of  which  can  be  supported  by \nADB.  \n \nC. \n \n3. \nInternational  consultants,  supported  by  national  consultants,  will  be  hired  to  implement \nthe study. The consultants will (i) undertake a desktop study of available studies on the energy \nefficiency of the PRC railway sector, (ii) analyze the energy efficiency characteristics of the PRC \nrailway  sector  and  identify  areas  where  energy  efficiency  can  be  enhanced,  (iii) review  recent \ntechnological  developments  and  assess  the  most  appropriate  technologies  for  transfer  to  the \nPRC  railway  sector,  (iv)  undertake  consultation  with  key  stakeholders,  (v)  prepare  a  national \nrailway  sector  energy  efficiency  strategy,  (vi)  prioritize  investment  areas  and  recommend  a \npipeline  of  priority  lending  projects  for  energy  efficiency  in  the  PRC  railway  sector, \n(vii) recommend a railway energy efficiency enhancement project that ADB could support, and \n(viii) provide  capacity-building  support  to  major  stakeholders  in  achieving  railway  energy \nefficiency. An international training program with participation from the relevant departments will \nbe  organized  to  allow  the  participants  to  learn  from  the  experience  of  other  railways  abroad. \nWorkshops and seminars will be organized to review and disseminate the findings of the study. \nThe  study  will  be  undertaken  in  close  consultation  with  the  Government,  MOR,  and  other \nrelevant  agencies.  The  study  will  build  on  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  policy  dialogue  and  will  consider  all \nprevious  studies  by  the  Government,  ADB,  AFD,  the  World  Bank,  and  other  multilateral  and \nbilateral agencies.  \n \nD. \n \n4. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  study  is  estimated  at  $1,000,000  and  is  proposed  to  be  financed \nwith a TA from the Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility.1 \nThe  Government  has  requested  ADB  to  finance  $800,000.  MOR  will  finance  the  remaining \n\nMethodology and Key Activities \n\nCost and Financing \n\n                                                 \n1   Contributors: the governments of Australia and Norway. \n\n \n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n$200,000,  which  will  cover  office  accommodation  and  counterpart  staff  required  to  implement \nthe study.

A  steering  committee,  comprising  representatives  of  relevant  departments  of \nMOR,  will  be  set  up  to  oversee  implementation,  provide  guidance  and  direction  to  the \nconsultants.  In  addition,  MOR  will  appoint  a  project  coordinator  to  supervise  and  coordinate \nday-to-day  study  activities,  including  monitoring  progress,  resolving  problems,  arranging \nmeetings, and coordinating with concerned government agencies. To facilitate the work of the \nconsultants  and  ensure  that  MOR  benefits  from  their  experience,  MOR  will  also  provide \nadequate counterpart staff with relevant work experience during implementation.  \n \n6. \nA  team  of  international  consultants  in  association  with  national  consultants  will  be \nengaged  by  ADB  through  simplified  technical  proposals  and  quality-  and  cost-based  selection \n(80:20) according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time \nto  time)  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  national  consultants.  The \nstudy  will  require  about  24  person-months  of  international  and  about  12  person-months  of \nnational consulting services. The consultants will have expertise in energy efficiency as applied to \nthe railway sector and must have experience developing similar policies and programs. The study \nis expected to begin in March 2009 and to be completed by December 2009. The procurement \nof  equipment,  supplies,  and  materials  by  consultants  under  the  study  will  follow  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  equipment  will  be  turned \nover to MOR after the study. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n49\n\nTRAFFIC FORECAST AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\n \n\nthat \n\nTraffic Forecast \n\n \nA. \n \nFreight  traffic  for  the  Lanzhou\u2013Chongqing  Railway  (LCR)  was  forecast  by  commodity \n1. \n(i.e.,  coal,  petroleum  products,  iron  and  steel,  fertilizers,  intermodal  containers,  and  other \ncommodities) in two categories differentiated by their economic impact: (i) traffic diverted from \nother  modes  (other  railway  routes,  and  roads)  on  the  basis  of  an  assessment  of  the  relative \nservice  and  cost-competitiveness  of  the  project  railway;  and  (ii)  generated  traffic  that  would \nmove only because of the existence of a railway line where none previously existed. The traffic \nforecast  was  based  on  a  two-tier  analysis:  (i)  national  transport  demand  based  on  historical \ntrends correlating socioeconomic parameters, such as gross domestic product and propensity to \ntravel  or  ship  or  demand  for  railway  transport;  and  (ii)  national  and  regional  railway  traffic \ndemand  based  on  commodity-specific  analysis  for  major  commodities  currently  using  other \nrailway  lines  and  roads.\nTraffic  projections  considered  expected  economic  growth,  population \nincrease, tourism development potential, local government development plans, market surveys, \nand  assessments  of  technical  assistance  (TA)  consultants  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) missions. The freight volume on the LCR is forecast to increase from about 40.14 billion \nton-kilometers  (ton-km)  in  2015  to  88.58  billion  ton-km  in  2034,  for  an  average  annual  growth \n \nrate  of  about  4.25%.\nPassenger  traffic  is  forecast  to  grow  from  10.70  billion  passenger-km \n(pass-km) in 2015 to 34.19 billion pass-km in 2034, for an average annual growth rate of 6.3% \n(Table  A15.1).  Traffic  forecasts  are  considered  reasonable,  given  that  (i)  the  LCR  is  an \nimportant  link  connecting  northwest  PRC,  Central  Asia,  and  Europe  to  the  Chengdu\u2013\nChongqing\u2013Shanghai transport corridor, which also connects to Southeast Asia via Kunming to \ntraffic \nthe  south,  such \n(origin-and-destination  pairs  for  major  traffic  movements  include  Urumqi\u2013Kunming,  Urumqi\u2013\nChengdu, Alashankou\u2013Chengdu, Jiayuguan\u2013Chengdu, Jiayuguan\u2013Geermu, Geermu\u2013Chengdu, \nUrumqi\u2013Guiyang,  Urumqi\u2013Yangang,  Kunming\u2013Wuwei,  and  Geermu\u2013Chengdu);  (ii)  railways  in \nthe PRC have experienced high annual traffic growth with recent rates higher than the assumed \ngrowth  rates  for  freight  and  passenger  traffic;  (iii)  for  about  two-thirds  of  the  length  of  the \nalignment,  there  has  been  limited  transport  infrastructure  developed,  with  the  result  that \nresources such as minerals have not been exploited, and there are already plans to tap these \ndeposits  once  LCR  is  opened;  and  (iv)  the  average  distance  saved  by  routing  traffic  through \nLCR  compared  with  other  railway  lines  is  about  295  km,  and  over  600  km  for  two \norigin-and-destination  pairs  involving  long-distance  movement  between  eastern  and  western \nPRC.  \n \nB.  \n \n2. \nthe  economic  analysis,  possible  alternative \ninterventions  that  would  meet  the  growing  transport  demand  in  the  project  area  under  the \nnational  and  provincial  transport  network  plan  were  considered.  Alternative  analysis  reviewed \ntransport  modes,  alignments,  and  technical  designs  for  various  options.  While  enhancing  the \nexisting road capacity may be an option that would partly meet the increasing demand, it will not \ncompletely  satisfy  the  various  kinds  of  traffic,  particularly  bulk  cargo  such  as  coal  over  long \ndistances to meet the needs of a growing economy. Aside from the higher initial cost, increased \nland  requirements,  high  air  pollution  impact,  fuel  consumption,  and  user  costs  make  the  road \nalternative  less  viable.  Several  alignment  alternatives  were  subsequently  evaluated  for  line \nsections  on  the  basis  of  geologic  and  topographic  conditions,  terrain  considerations, \nconsultations  with  community  representatives,  cost  estimates,  relative \nthe \nenvironment and on resettlement, and integration with the national and local transport network. \n\nAlternative  Analysis.  As  part  of \n\nEconomic Evaluation  \n\ntraffic  accounts \n\nfor  49.3%  of \n\nimpact  on \n\nfreight \n\ntransit \n\ntotal \n\n \n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\nThe  technical  design  was  proposed  after  consideration  of  the  national  railway  network, \nconsistency  in  the  standards  of  contiguous  sections  at  each  end  of  the  project  railway,  and \nforecast traffic.  \n \nCost.  The  economic  evaluation  is  based  on  a  comparison  of  with-  and  without-Project \n3. \nscenarios, using constant 2008 economic prices. Under the with-Project scenario it is assumed \nthat  the  diverted  traffic  (41.98  million  tons  and  12.24  million  passengers  in  2015)  estimated \nunder  the  with-Project  scenario  would  continue  moving  by  road  and  by  existing  railway  lines. \nFurthermore, the generated traffic estimated under the with-Project scenario (26.98 million tons \nand 6.65 million passengers in 2015) would not materialize under the without-Project scenario. \nThe  project  benefits  and  cost  were  revalued  in  economic  prices  by  separating  the  cost  items \ninto tradable materials and equipment, non-tradable materials, labor, and land. The prices were \nexpressed  in  yuan  using  the  domestic  price  numeraire  with  a  shadow  exchange  rate  factor \n(SERF) of 1.01 for foreign exchange effects. A shadow wage rate factor of 0.67 was used to put \nan economic value on the wages paid to unskilled labor but not on wages for skilled labor, since \nthere is no clear surplus of skilled workers.  \n \n4. \nBenefits.  Economic  benefits  include  (i)  user  cost  savings  for  freight  and  passenger \ntraffic;  (ii)  time  savings for  diverted passenger and  freight  traffic  from  buses,  trucks,  and  other \nrail  lines;  (iii)  passenger  and  freight  transport  benefits  generated;  (iv)  tourism  benefits; \n(v) shipper  savings  due  to  increased  railway  competition,  (vi)  road  accidents  avoided; \n(vii) reduced pollution; (viii) energy savings; and (ix) national productivity benefits.  \n \n5. \nFor passenger traffic diverted from road (5.08 million passengers in 2015), the user cost \nsaving (CNY197.74 million in 2015) is the difference in the passenger economic fare between \nroad and rail transport (CNY0.1271 per pass-km). For passenger traffic diverted from other LCR \nroutes (7.00 million passengers in 2015), the user cost saving (CNY66.97 million in 2015) is the \ndifference  in  route  distance  applied  to  the  economic  cost  of  rail  passenger  travel  (CNY0.0123 \nper pass-km). For passenger traffic diverted from air (0.15 million in 2015), the user cost saving \n(CNY32.35  million  in  2015)  is  the  difference  between  the  economic  cost  of  LCR  and  air \ntransport  (CNY0.3693  per  pass-km).  For  generated  passenger  traffic  (both  local  and  interline) \nthe  estimated  pass-km  (3.6  billion  in  2015)  is  multiplied  by  one-half  of  the  average  economic \ncost saving (CNY0.0845 per pass-km), and amounts to CNY307.16 in 2015. Passenger traffic \ntime saving (CNY3.57 million in 2015) was computed only for diverted traffic.  \n \n6. \nFor  freight  traffic  diverted  from  roads  (9.6  million  tons  in  2015),  the  economic  benefit \n(CNY675.01 million in 2015) is the difference in shipper economic costs between road and rail \ntransport  (CNY0.1865  per  ton-km).  For  traffic  diverted  from  other  railway  routes  to  LCR,  the \nbenefit (CNY446.65 million in 2015) is the rail-diverted ton-km (26.93 billion in 2015) multiplied \nby  the  difference  (CNY0.0166  per  ton-km)  between  the  economic  rate  of  rail  transport  to  the \nLCR  economic  rate.  For  generated  freight  traffic  benefits  (CNY6,708.73  million  in  2015)  an \nadjusted economic value-added ranging from CNY111.06 per ton for fertilizers to CNY2,440.74 \nper  ton  for  containerized  cargo  was  computed  on  the  basis  of  current  financial  value,  nontax \nelements,  SERF,  percentage  value  added,  percentage  net  taxes,  depreciation,  and  operating \nsurplus for each commodity. The adjusted economic values per ton represent the net economic \nvalue,  i.e.,  the  value  of  output  at  economic  prices  less  the  costs  of  production  (sum  of  all \nintermediate  input  costs,  wages,  and  annualized  investment  costs).  Since  generated  traffic \nbenefits  represent  producer\u2019s  surplus,  one-half  of  the  economic  value  for  each  commodity  is \nmultiplied  by  estimated  generated  freight  tons.  Similar  to  passenger  traffic,  freight  traffic  time \nsaving (CNY3.65 million in 2015) was computed only for diverted traffic. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n51\n\nTourism  benefits  (CNY64.14  million  in  2015)  assume  that  15%  of  incremental  interline \n7. \npassenger traffic growth is attributable to LCR (0.338 million in 2015), which will generate a net \neconomic  value  of  CNY95  per  tourist,  representing  16.9%  of  the  value  added  in  the  tourism \nsector accounting for the value of output at economic prices less the cost of production (sum of \nall  intermediate  input  costs,  wages,  and  annualized  investment  costs).  To  eliminate  double \ncounting,  a  downward  adjustment  of  15%  of  generated  traffic  benefits  was  made,  reducing \nthese  benefits  by  the  same  proportion  as  the  percentage  of  tourists  in  projected  interline \npassengers.  \n \n8. \nEnergy and pollution benefits were also estimated for the Project. With the diversion of \nfreight  and  passengers  from  road  to  rail,  there  will  be  benefits  from  reduced  pollution  from \ntrucks,  buses,  and  cars  as  well  as  less  energy  used  by  the  transport  sector.  On  the  basis  of \nrecent  research  conducted  by  the  International  Energy  Agency,  the  number  of  tons  of  carbon \ndioxide  (CO2)  per  traffic  unit  for  road  and  rail  were  computed  for  PRC.  These  savings  for  rail \ncompared with road were found to be 25.4 tons of CO2 per million pass-km and 24 tons of CO2 \nper million ton-km. This value was included in the benefit stream (CNY54.62 million in 2015). In \naddition, the saving in reduced total fuel consumption (CNY616.01 million in 2015) as a result of \ndiverting traffic from both road and rail to LCR was computed and included in the benefit stream. \nUnit operating costs for both road and rail transport were adjusted to exclude fuel costs in order \nto eliminate double counting of this benefit.  \n \n9. \nThe  construction  of  LCR  will  help  avoid  some  costs  that  would  not  be  possible  in  the \nabsence  of  LCR.  The  economic  analysis  estimated  four  such  cases  of  cost  avoidance; \n(i) highway  investment  costs  avoided;  (ii)  highway  routine  and  periodic  maintenance  costs \navoided;  (iii)  truck  shipping  charges  to  freight  shippers  avoided  through  increased  competition \nbrought about by LCR; and (iv) road accident costs avoided.  \n \n10. \nConclusion.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  for  the  Project  is  17.09% \n(Table A15.3). Benefits from freight traffic, including generated benefits, are the major economic \nbenefit (about 63.8% for freight shippers in Table A15.2), with passenger benefits contributing \nabout 4.9% and other benefits making up the balance. Sensitivity analysis tested 10 scenarios \nto assess the robustness of the results of the economic analysis (Table A15.4). The total cost \nwould have to be more than 23% higher than estimated for the EIRR to fall below the cutoff rate \nof  12%.  Considering  the  experience  of  ADB-financed  projects  in  the  railway  sector,  this \nswitching value is unlikely to occur. The freight benefits would have to decrease by about 25% \nto  make  the  Project  economically  nonviable.  A  1-year  delay  in  completion  would  not  affect \neconomic  viability  but,  again,  this  is  unlikely,  as  MOR  has  demonstrated  the  capacity  to \nimplement and complete projects on schedule. Combinations of adverse effects of benefits and \ncosts were also tested. The results showed that the Project would maintain its economic viability \nunder plausible scenarios of variability. \n \n11. \nThe  economic  analysis  was  extended  to  quantify  project  risk  and  distribute  project  net \nbenefits among stakeholders. The risk analysis considered the distribution of possible values for \nkey variables, including capital costs, operation and maintenance costs, passenger traffic, and \nfreight  traffic,  and  the  probability  with  which  they  may  occur.  After  500  iterations,  the  results \nshow  that  the  EIRR  would  exceed  12%  with  100%  probability.  Distribution  analysis  examined \nhow  project  net  benefits  would  be  distributed  by  determining  the  project  effects  for  project \nbeneficiaries,  such  as  passengers,  freight  shippers,  labor,  government,  and  the  economy \n(Table A15.2).  Distribution  analysis  indicates  that  a  large  portion  of  net  benefits  will  accrue  to \nproject users and the economy. \n \n\n \n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\nTable A15.1: Traffic Forecast

Construction  will  be \ncompleted  in  2014,  followed  by  trial  operation  in  2015.  The  cost  estimates  are  presented  in \ncurrent  terms.  As  required  in  the  financial  management  guidelines,  physical  contingencies  (at \nthe weighted average rate of 6.14%) and price contingencies1 have been provided.  \n \nB.  \n \n2. \nA set of tariffs was devised for freight and passenger transport service, on the basis of \nfull  cost  recovery  plus  an  adequate  return  on  equity.  Operating  revenues  from  tariffs  were \nprojected on the basis of a forecast of future traffic and a base average tariff rate of CNY0.12 \nper  ton-kilometer  (ton-km)  for  2015,  inclusive  of  Railway  Construction  Fund  collections,  which \naverage CNY0.033 per ton-km. The freight tariff is assumed to increase at a rate of 1% yearly \nwith  tariff  adjustments  taking  place  every  5  years.  Similar  to  the  freight  tariff,  passenger  fares \nare  assumed  to  increase  in  current  terms  once  every  5  years  at  an  annual  rate  of  1%. \nPassenger  tariff  ranges  from  CNY0.1  per  passenger-kilometer  (pass-km)  for  local  trains  to \nCNY0.20 per pass-km for very fast transit trains (200 km/hour) in 2015, with a weighted average \nrate of CNY0.144 per pass-km for all passenger traffic. No real increase in tariffs is expected to \noccur over the Project\u2019s life span. Other revenues, including loading and unloading, warehouse \nstorage, parcel service in the train stations, amount to 4.5% of combined freight and passenger \nrevenue.  \n \n3. \nAll  incremental  operating  costs  are  projected  to  increase  yearly  with  inflation  rates. \nPeriodic track maintenance and infrastructure rehabilitation will be required after each 7 years of \noperation, at a cost of CNY2.598 million per route-kilometer; electric power and catenaries will \nbe  replaced  after  15  years  of  operation  at  a  cost  of  CNY1,298.86  million,  and  signaling  and \ncommunications, safety, and other equipment will be replaced after 20 years of operation, at a \ncost of CNY650.99 million.  \n \n4. \nDepreciation is calculated according to the straight-line method, with an average life of \n65 years for the main railway structure, 10 years for track, 45 years for buildings, 15 years for \nelectric  power  and  traction,  and  20  years  for  signaling,  communications,  safety,  and  other \nequipment and facilities. Applicable business taxes, at an average rate of 3.24%, are charged \non revenue. Corporate income tax, at 33%, is paid on income after deducting business taxes, \ndepreciation  and  interest  charges,  operating  expenses,  and  any  prior  year  losses  carried \nforward.  \n \n5. \nThe Project will be funded 50% by equity (55% by MOR and 45% divided between the \nChongqing  municipal  government  and  Gansu  and  Sichuan  provinces)  and  50%  by  long-term \nloans.  The  loan  from  China  Construction  Bank  (CCB)  is  repayable  over  20  years,  including  a \ngrace  period,  at  a  lending  rate  currently  set  at  6.6%  yearly.  The  loan  from  the  Industrial  and \nCommercial  Bank  of  China  (ICBC)  is  repayable  over  25  years,  including  a  grace  period,  at  a \nlending  rate  of  7.13%  currently.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  loan  ($300 million)  will \n                                                 \n1  Physical contingencies computed at 6.14% of base cost on average for civil works and 6.14% for field research and \ndevelopment,  training,  surveys,  and  studies  (this  estimate  is  based  on  assumed  contingency  rates  for  specific \ncomponents ranging from 3% to 15%). Price contingencies computed at 6.8% on foreign exchange costs in 2008, \n0.7% in 2009, 1.4% in 2010, 0.4% in 2011, 0.5% in 2012 and onward, and local currency inflation rate at 5.5% in \n2008,  5.0%  in  2009  and  onward,  and  includes  provision  for  exchange  rate  fluctuation  under  the  assumption  of  a \npurchasing power parity exchange rate. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 16 \n\n55 \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\nhave a 27-year term with a 7-year grace period, and be a US dollar London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)\u2013based loan. The projected financial statements indicate that the forecast revenue \nunder the base assumptions is sufficient to cover annual recurrent costs, depreciation, and debt \nrepayments on the ADB and domestic bank loans, and generate reasonable profits.  \n \nA  financial  management  assessment  questionnaire  was  completed  according  to  ADB \n6. \nguidelines. The Executing Agency will maintain separate accounts for the Project and have such \naccounts  and  related  financial  statements  audited  annually  by  an  independent  auditor, \naccording  to  auditing  standards  that  are  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  Executing  Agency  is  also \nrequired  to  submit  to  ADB,  within  6  months  after  each  fiscal  year,  certified  copies  of  such \naudited project accounts and financial statements and auditor\u2019s reports, all in English. The audit \nof such financial statements will include (i) an assessment of the adequacy of accounting and \ninternal  control  systems  with  respect  to  project  expenditures  and  other  financial  transactions, \nand  (ii)  an  assessment  of  compliance  with  loan  covenants  that  may  be  agreed  on  under  the \nProject and ADB\u2019s project management requirements, and (iii) a separate opinion on the use of \nthe imprest account and statement-of-expenditure procedures. Within the project company, an \ninternal audit unit will be established to ensure that an effective internal control system is put in \nplace.  The  unit  will  independently  test  financial  transactions  to  ensure  the  safe  custody  of  the \nproject-financed assets and will report directly to the project company management and external \nauditors. The Foreign Capital and Technical Import Center, under the Ministry of Railways, will \nmake satisfactory arrangements for reporting the progress of project implementation to ADB by \nsubmitting quarterly progress reports. \n \nC.  \n \n7. \nFollowing are the major assumptions used in the calculation of a financial internal rate of \nreturn:  (i)  all  calculations  are  based  on  2008  prices,  covering  2008\u20132034;  (ii)  capital  costs \ninclude  all  incremental  capital  expenditures  related  to  construction  and  equipment  for  the \nrailway,  but  exclude  price  contingencies  and  interest  during  construction;  (iii)  operating  costs \ninclude  all  annual  incremental  expenses  incurred  in  operating  the  project  railway,  but  exclude \ndepreciation and debt repayment provisions; and (iv) the residual value is equal to one-half of \nthe net book value of the capital investment.  \n \n8. \nThe  estimated  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC),  after-tax,  in  real  terms  was \ncalculated as follows: (i) the applicable 7-year LIBOR fixed swap rate plus a provision for ADB\u2019s \nspread of 0.6% with a discount of 40 basis points was used for ADB debt, with an interest rate \nof 4.51%; (ii) the estimated interest rates of 7.13% per year for the Industrial and Commercial \nBank of China loan and 6.6% per year for the China Construction Bank loan were used; and (iii) \nthe  opportunity  cost  of  equity  capital  was  assumed  to  be  10%.  The  cost  of  debt  was  also \nadjusted to reflect the impact of income tax of 33%. The nominal cost was converted to the real \ncost  by  applying  domestic  and  international  long-term  inflation  rates  for  local  currency  and \nforeign exchange denominated debt, respectively.  \n \n9. \nThe  financial  internal  rate  of  return  for  the  Project,  computed  after  tax,  is  6.98% \n(Table A16.4),  which  compares  favorably  with  the  WACC  of  2.74%,  computed  after  tax.  The \nProject  is  considered  both  financially  viable  and  sustainable.  The  sensitivity  of  the  Project's \nfinancial  indicators  to  cost  and  revenue  variations  is  shown  in  Table  A16.5.  Sensitivity  tests \nindicate  that  conditions  that  might  cause  the  Project\u2019s  viability  to  fall  below  the  WACC  are \nunlikely  to  occur.  The  switching  values  show  that  the  financial  viability  of  the  Project  is  not \naltered within a realistic range of variation in key parameter estimates. \n\n \n\n\fTable 16.1: Projected

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC): \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nThis Project is consistent  with the Country  Partnership Strategy,  which aims to enhance pro-poor economic growth through \ntransport infrastructure development. The railway will serve a as key transport link for the western development region of the \nPRC.  Overall,  it  is  expected  that  the  Lanzhou\u2013Chongqing  Railway  (LCR)  Development  Project  will  contribute  to  equitable \neconomic  growth  by  (i)  improving  access  to  marketing  and  employment  opportunities;  (ii)  facilitating  access  to  key  social \nservices;  (iii) supporting  and  stimulating  agricultural  production;  (iv)  promoting  trade,  encouraging  livelihood  diversification, \nand enabling information exchange; (v) improving a key component of regional and rural infrastructure and reducing widening \ngaps  in  living  standards  and  economic  opportunities  between  the  western  and  coastal  areas;  and  (vi)  removing  one  of  the \nconstraints on the development of poor and rural communities. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                           Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \nDevelopment in the project impact area (PIA) has been constrained by limited transportation infrastructure, which is one factor \ncontributing  to  the  relatively  high  incidence  of  poverty  in  some  areas.  The  28  counties  and  districts  in  the  PIA  include  15 \nnationally designated poverty counties and 2,897 designated poverty villages (31% of all villages in the PIA). Better railway \ntransport will provide an enabling condition for poverty reduction through improved access to markets, employment, education \nand  medical  facilities,  new  knowledge  and  information,  families  working  or  studying  in  other  regions,  and  other  social  and \neconomic  services  that  facilitate  economic  development.  Improved  access  to  markets  will  open  up  opportunities  for  new \nenterprises  and  expansion  of  existing  ones.  Incoming  passengers  and  tourists  will  spawn  additional  demand  for  locally \nproduced goods and services. \n \n2.  Design Features  \nThe construction and operation of the railway will generate significant employment in local communities, which will be targeted \nat local communities including poverty villages. Construction access and roads connecting to the railway will directly benefit \npoor villages by helping to extend the project benefits and opportunities to the poor communities. Station area development \nwill encourage small business development among local people, including women and the poor. \n\n \n\nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending - not applicable \n  \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nFindings of Social Analysis  \n\nA. \nA poverty and social assessment (PSA) has been prepared for the Project. This includes a poverty profile of beneficiaries and \nclient groups and a social assessment. The beneficiaries of the Project have been identified through surveys, consultative \nfieldwork, and secondary sources. Beneficiaries can be broken down into (i) direct beneficiaries, i.e., existing rail users, and \nother transport users who might shift to rail, such as freight carriers, and passengers; and (ii) indirect beneficiaries, who do not \nnecessarily rely on the railway but may derive some benefits including those in public sector employment, operators of small \nbusinesses such as shop owners and traders, farmers and farmers\u2019 associations or cooperatives, people engaged in daily \nlabor, construction workers, and tourists visiting or transiting the PIA.  \n\nEconomic conditions along the alignment range from relatively well off to some of the poorest in the PRC. Most of the villages \nalong the alignment are isolated and have not been recipients of development. The links between poverty, topography, and \ntransport systems are apparent in the PIA. People living in the mountains or in isolated areas lack fertile land and sufficient \nmeans of livelihood. They also live in areas prone to drought, frosts, erosion, and uncertainty. The main causes of poverty in \nthe  project  areas  are  (i)  natural  calamity,  (ii)  lack  of  infrastructure,  (iii)  very  limited  and  unsustainable  sources  of  livelihood, \n(vi) uneven economic development, and (v) poor health. The Project will benefit about 16.8 million people in the PIA, of whom \n72% live in rural areas and 8% are designated poor (using the official absolute poverty line in the PRC of CNY693 per person \nper  year).  According  to  survey  data,  17%  of  households  are  poor  and  vulnerable  (with  annual  incomes  below  CNY1,000). \nVulnerable  households  are  above  the  poverty  line  but  are  susceptible  to  economic  shocks  that  could  force  them  below  the \npoverty line. Few households have regular nonfarm income. The most predominant livelihood sector, on a regular or irregular \nbasis, is agriculture, accounting for 80% of all working household members.  \n\nAbout 467,913 unskilled person-years of work will be created during the construction of LCR. Half will target the poor, at total \nwages  of  CNY2,105  million  over  233,957  person-years,  or  CNY8,997  per  person-year\u2014more  than  12  times  the  official \npoverty  line  of  CNY693  per  person  per  year.  Hiring  priority  will  be  given  to  women,  resettlement-affected  people,  and \nvulnerable  people.  In  addition,  during  the  construction,  80,693  person-years  of  local  unskilled  jobs  in  the  provision  of \nconstruction materials,  with total  wages of  CNY605.2 million,  will be created; again, half, or 40,346  person-years,  with total \nwages of CNY302.6 million will be set aside for the poor. When the new railway starts operating in 2015, about 3,460 more \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 17 \n\nlow-skilled  and  unskilled  jobs  will  be  created,  with  total  wages  of  CNY34.60  million  annually.  Expecting  more  efficient  and \ncheaper freight transport and business travels on the LCR, many enterprises in the PIA have been planning to expand their \noutput and increase labor; PIA companies foresee the creation of an estimated 35,646 jobs as a result of LCR.  \n\nThe 31 railway stations, which will be connected to all levels of road network accessible by all villages, will also create various \njobs, and help distribute benefits across a broader spectrum of the population throughout the PIA. Station design will ensure \nsufficient space in and around the stations for local area development to foster income-generation opportunities for the poor, \nwomen,  and  vulnerable  people,  who  will  be  supported  by  local  government  agencies  in  selling  local  specialties  as  well  as \nother goods and services. All of this direct, indirect, and generated impact will provide the conditions for meeting the PRC goal \nof  micro-urbanization  for  poor  families  by  (i)  moving  poor  households  away  from  unsustainable,  mountainous,  and  isolated \nfarmlands;  (ii)  providing  better  access  to  markets,  advanced  education,  and  health  facilities  especially  for  pregnant  women; \n(iii) building a sustainable future through new centers of economic activity; and (iv) complementing poverty reduction activities \nby assisting the poor with urban migration, relocation, employment, local economic development, farmer-based rural tourism, \nagricultural product development, access to health services, and physical infrastructure improvement. In addition to providing \ncheaper transport, LCR will offer a safer means of travel than roads. \n\n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \n\nThe  PIA  of  LCR  includes  seven  prefectures  and  28  counties  in  Gansu,  Shaanxi,  and  Sichuan  provinces  and  Chongqing \nmunicipality.  Participation  has  included  surveys  and  community  consultation  (focus  group  meetings  and  interviews  with \nstakeholders).  About  3,900  household  surveys,  350  village  surveys,  and  200  industry  surveys,  as  well  as  770  passenger \nsurveys, have been completed. During the household surveys, beneficiaries provided information on their perceptions of the \nProject:  overall,  94%  saw  the  Project  as  bringing  tangible  benefits  to  their  household,  while  5%  were  indifferent  and  1% \nexpressed the view that that the Project would also have some adverse impact. \n\nVarious  project  public  consultations  and  participation  activities  were  carried  out  in  2006\u20132007  and  the  role  of  each \nstakeholder has been identified. The Ministry of Railways (MOR), the First and Second Survey Design Institutes of China Rail, \nthe  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  consultant,  and  ADB  missions  have  had  formal  and  informal \nconsultations  with  local  communities  and  government  agencies  through  meetings,  surveys,  household  interviews,  written \ncommunications, and workshops. Since the start of the feasibility studies some 14,000 individuals have been consulted about \nthe  Project.  MOR  is  the  Executing  Agency  and  is  responsible  for  overall  supervision  and  implementation  of  construction \nactivities. The local county and township governments and communities will assist the Executing Agency in land acquisition, \nthe  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plan,  and  the  organization  of  local  labor  for  the  construction  and  local  development \n(including  the  station  areas)  to  ensure  that  the  Project  benefits  the  poor,  women,  ethnic  minorities,  and  other  vulnerable \npeople.  Initial  issues  discussed  included  the  selection  of  the  alignment.  Further  public  consultation  occurred  during  various \nfield surveys among local residents and government officials, tourists, passengers using all modes of transport, industries in \nthe PIA, and other stakeholders.  \n\n \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n \n3. Was a C&P plan prepared? \n\n Yes    \n\n No  \n\nThe resettlement and environment safeguard processes also include consultations with and the participation of the community \nas a key step in the identification of impact and mitigation measures. Beneficiaries will participate in project development and \nimplementation  through  the  use  of  local  people,  especially  the  poor  and  women,  in  the  construction  of  civil  works.  The \ncontract documents include clauses specifying targets for local employment. A participation and consultation plan has been \nprepared to guide MOR in continuing the consultation with stakeholders and affected communities along the alignment. \n\n \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues  \n\nThe  PSA  concluded  that  women  will  be  beneficiaries  of  the  Project,  as  the  Project  could  have  gender-specific  outcomes. \nGeneral  social  benefits  that  could  be  derived  from  improved  and  maintained  transport  access  could  also  enhance  the \nparticipation  of  women  in  the  commercial  sector.  The  construction  of  the  LCR  will  create  opportunities  for  local  area \ndevelopment by (i) facilitating the flow of materials and information into the area, and (ii) accelerating the development of local \nindustries.  Many  of  the  service  sector  jobs  that  will  be  created  by  the  railway  and  in  the  tourism  sector  are  for  female \nemployees. The All-China Women\u2019s Federation (ACWF) will provide business management training and financial assistance \nto women interested in setting up small businesses that serve construction crews. But while women stand to benefit from the \nProject, they are also likely to be more exposed to the risk of communicable diseases. This risk will be mitigated through the \nHIV/AIDS/STI  and  human  trafficking  awareness  and  prevention  programs  that  are  a  component  of  the  social  development \naction plan (SDAP) to be implemented by the Project.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 17 \n\n61\n\n2.  Key  Actions.

For  example,  members  of  the  community  will \ncollectively  decide  where  schools  and  other  community  facilities  will  be  relocated.  Women,  especially  female  heads  of \nhousehold,  will  be  consulted,  as  schools  provide  an  informal  source  of  day  care  for  their  children.  Widows  and  households \nheaded  by  women  will  be  eligible  for  special  assistance,  if  necessary,  during  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  SDAP \nincludes a range of measures including hiring preferences to ensure that women fully participate in, and enjoy project benefits \nto  the  same  extent  as  men.  Women  will  be  given  priority  in  hiring  for  project-generated  jobs  during  the  construction  and \noperation  of  the  railway.  The  increase  in  female  participation  in  the  labor  force  will  increase  women\u2019s  net  income,  thus \nimproving overall family welfare, and raising the status of women. \n \n\nIII. \n\nSOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \n\nIssue \n\n \nInvoluntary \nResettlement \n\n \nIndigenous \nPeoples \n \n\n \nLabor \n\n Employment \n\nopportunities \n Labor \nretrenchment \n Core labor \n\nstandards \n\n \nAffordability \n\nRisks \n\nOther \nand/or \nVulnerabilities \n HIV/AIDS \n Human \ntrafficking \n\n Others  (conflict, \npolitical \ninstability, \netc), please specify \n\nSignificant/Limited/ \nNo Impact \n\nimpact\u20141,646 \n\nOverall,  the  Project  will  have  significant \nresettlement \nhectares \n(24,694  mu)  of  land  will  be  permanently \nacquired.  Of  this,  82.8%  will  be  farmland, \ncausing  partial  land  loss  for  about  30,000 \nhouseholds.  In  addition,  12,072  households \nwill be relocated.  \n\nThe  project  impact  on  ethnic  minorities  is \nnot  significant.  In  the  PIA,  ethnic  minorities \nrepresent only 2% of the population and are \nmade up mostly of Hui people, who are not \neconomically  disadvantaged.  There  are  no \nethnic  minority  townships  or  villages  along \nthe  alignment.

The Lanzhou\u2013Chongqing Railway (LCR)  Development  Project will cross Gansu \nand Sichuan provinces and Chongqing City and 28 counties and districts. Land acquisition and \nhouse  demolition  will  affect  94  townships  and  275  villages.  The  resettlement  impact  of  the \nProject  is  spread  thinly  over  a  long,  narrow  corridor.  The  resettlement  plan  addresses  the \npermanent and temporary impact caused by the railway alignment, station sites, station access \nroads, and related construction activities. The project scope does not include the proposed loop \nlines and rail yards in Lanzhou and Chongqing.  \n \n2. \nAn estimated 1,646 hectares of land will be permanently acquired. Of this, 31.0% will be \npaddy  land,  51.0%  cultivated  dryland,  0.8%  garden  or  orchard,  6.8%  forest  land,  6.4% \nresidential land, and 2.7% wasteland. The Project will also temporarily acquire 1,388 hectares \nfor LCR construction activities and access. A total of 1,189,240 square meters of structures will \nbe  affected,  93.7%  of  which  will be residential  units  and  other  farm  structures,  5.3%  industrial \nstructures,  and  1%  schools.  According  to  the  standard  for  impact  assessment  in  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  China  (PRC),  the  equivalent  of  3,843  households  would  lose  all  their  land  and \nagricultural livelihoods, and 12,072 households would have their houses demolished. Since the \nalignment is narrow, most land impact will be partial, resulting in more affected households with \nless significant impact. From previous experience with PRC railways, it is estimated partial land \nimpact  in  the  order  of  15%  along  the  route  and  33%  at  stations  will  be  experienced,  affecting \nabout  81,366  affected  people  and  21,469  households  through  permanent  land  acquisition.  In \naddition,  an  estimated  6,935  households  (26,283  people)  are  expected  to  be  affected  by \ntemporary land acquisition. Land acquisition and resettlement (LAR) impact has been lessened \nby  aligning  the  railway  away  from  the  most  densely  populated  areas,  and  avoiding  villages, \ncultivated land, and facilities where possible; 72.6% of the alignment is tunnels or bridges.  \n \n3. \nThe resettlement objective is to ensure that compensation and entitlements provided to \naffected persons are adequate to at least maintain their \"without-Project\" standard of living, with \nprospects of improvement, in line with the PRC Land Administration Law (amended 2004) and \nwith ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). In addition, affected people that are poor or \nvulnerable should be made better off, either as direct beneficiaries or through special measures \nto safeguard and enhance their living conditions. People losing land, housing, other assets, or \nother  means  of  production  will  be  compensated  at  replacement  cost  and  assisted  in  restoring \ntheir incomes and living standards. Payments for land will be made to the village collectives, and \nthey  will  determine  how  the  funds  should  be  allocated  among  the  affected  persons.  Village \nrehabilitation plans will be prepared for stations that cause serious impact on affected villages; \nthese plans will be integrated with station area development plans. \n \n4. \nThe resettlement plan stipulates eligibility and entitlement provisions for affected persons. \nThe  Project  will  ensure  that  land  compensation  will  not  be  less  than  16  times  the  average \nannual output value. Compensation for temporary land loss will be paid directly to the affected \npersons  and  the  land  will  be  restored  to  its  original  state  after  use.  Compensation  for  rural \nhousing  losses  will  be  paid  directly  to  the  affected  persons  at  replacement  cost,  free  of \ndepreciation,  demolition  expenses,  and  salvaged  materials.  In  general,  rural  households  will \neither rebuild their own houses within the same village or integrated with the centrally planned \nsuburban  housing.  Better  road  access  and  provision  of  site  leveling,  water  supply,  electricity, \ntelephone,  and  cable  facilities  will  be  provided.  Urban  households  may  choose  to  be \n(i) allocated  replacement  housing  on  the  basis  of  a  swap  of  property  rights  for  properties  of \nequivalent size and quality, or (ii) paid cash compensation at the market  price with which they \nmay purchase replacement housing in the real estate market. Compensation for crop and tree \nlosses will be paid directly to the affected persons. Factories, schools, and other institutions and \nenterprises  will  be  compensated  after  a  process  of  negotiation.  Local  government  will  finance \nthe improvement of affected schools.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 18 \n\n63\n\n5. \nThe Ministry of Railways (MOR), with the assistance of the First and Second Survey and \nDesign Institutes, conducted a survey of 1,565 potentially affected households in August 2006. \nAlso,  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  consultant  surveyed  355  villages  and  1,167 \nadditional  households.  About  11.9%  of  all  households  surveyed  had  net  incomes  below \nCNY1,000 per capita. Special measures are included in the resettlement plan for the poor and \nother  vulnerable  groups  to  ensure  they  are  adequately  rehabilitated  and  their  living  standards \nimproved. Ethnic minority households constitute 2% of the population in the project area; most \nare Hui living in cities.  \n \n6. \nEach village or affected person will use the land compensation and resettlement subsidy \nfor income restoration. Local officials have indicated that schools, factories, and enterprises will \nrebuild  locally  and  that  these  organizations  and  their  employees  will  be  fully  compensated  for \nany  and  all  losses  and  costs  associated  with  relocation.  Affected  households  will  receive \ntraining  and  skills  development  assistance  that  will  facilitate  income-generating  activities.  An \nincome  restoration  budget  has  been  included  to  meet  the  costs  of  extension  of  services  to \naffected  persons  and  others  in  affected  villages  in  areas  such  as  agricultural  extension, \ncooperative  marketing  and  organization  for  agricultural  produce,  agricultural  and  enterprise \ncredit,  and  other  needs  that  arise  during  detailed  resettlement  planning  and  implementation. \nOther assistance, such as preferential hiring of affected persons by construction companies and \naccess to capital, will also be provided. \n \n7. \nAffected persons have been informed and consulted at various stages about the project \nimpact  and  resettlement  policies  and  entitlements.  They  will  continue  to  be  consulted  and  are \nencouraged to participate in resettlement activities, including the detailed measurement survey, \nlocation  of  underpasses,  new  housing  sites,  and  grievance  redress.  Affected  persons  can \nappeal  any  problems  or  grievances  regarding  land  acquisition,  housing  demolition  and \nrelocation,  compensation,  and  resettlement  to  five  levels:  the  village  committee,  the  railway \nconstruction  support  office  (RCSO),  local  government,  the  project  company,  the  independent \nmonitor, or the courts. A resettlement information booklet was provided by MOR to all affected \nvillages in October 2007. The resettlement plan will be updated on the basis of the inventory of \nlosses and the final alignment. \n \n8. \nLocal government RCSOs, set up under the local development and reform commissions, \nwill  be  responsible  for  implementing  the  resettlement;  the  offices  at  the  county  or  district  level \nwill  coordinate  the  administrative  LAR  activities,  with  assistance  from  township  officials  and \nvillage  committees.  MOR  will  monitor  the  LAR  activities  and  supervise  the  contractors  with \nrespect to temporary impact. MOR and the local governments have extensive experience with \nresettlement. The local government will provide training to local officials who will be involved in \nimplementation.  MOR  and  the  project  company,  in  collaboration  with  the  RCSOs,  will  be \nresponsible for internal supervision and monitoring of resettlement. An independent monitor will \nbe contracted by MOR to carry out the external monitoring and evaluation work.  \n \nThe  total  resettlement  cost  for  the  Project  is  CNY2.1  billion,  including  taxes  and \n9. \ncontingencies. The budget will be adjusted on the basis of the actual measurement of physical \nlosses.  Each  provincial  government1 will  be  responsible  for  resettlement  costs  as  part  of  its \nequity in the Project Company. The local governments will supplement the resettlement budget, \nas  may  prove  necessary,  to  meet  any  shortfall.  The  implementation  schedule  is  based  on  the \nproposed  project  construction  timetable.  Land  acquisition  will  begin  in  December  2008  and \nfinished in early 2012. The Project will be completed in 2015. \n\n                                                 \n1  The exception is Shaanxi province, where less than 25 km of LCR is located, and only two villages are affected. In \n\nthis case, although the local government will implement the resettlement, costs will be financed by the Project. \n\n \n\n\fSOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ACTION PLAN \n\nProposed Actions \nA.
