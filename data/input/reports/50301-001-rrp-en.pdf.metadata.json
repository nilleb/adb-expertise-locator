It will upgrade and maintain about 3,400 kilometers (km) of rural access \nroads to an all-weather standard; rehabilitate and maintain to a good condition about 340 km of \nnational roads in Eastern, Northern, Uva, and Western provinces; and improve the capacity of \nroad agencies with respect to safeguards, road safety, maintenance, research capacity, and road \ndesign and construction.1 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nSri  Lanka\u2019s  economy  has  grown  at  an  annual  average  of  6%  since  2003.  With  strong \neconomic growth, the poverty rate dropped significantly, from 22.7% in 2002 to 6.7% in 2012\u2013\n2013.2 About 82% of Sri Lanka\u2019s population (21 million in 2015) lives in rural areas.3 The rural \nsector also recorded a remarkable reduction in poverty, from 24.7% in 2002 to 7.6% in 2012\u2013\n2013. \n \nDespite  rapid  progress  in  reducing  poverty,  Sri  Lanka  faces  several  challenges  to  fully \n4. \neradicate poverty. Disparities in the poverty rate exist across provinces and districts, particularly \nin districts in Eastern, Northern, and Uva provinces, where headcount poverty rates are close to, \nor exceed, 20%. The Western Province, which has Sri Lanka\u2019s lowest headcount poverty rate, \nstill retains pockets of poverty\u201436% of the population remains vulnerable and lives close to the \npoverty line (on less than $4 per day). Consumption and income inequality have both increased \nsince 2009, with slower consumption and income growth among the poorer half of the population \nthan among the wealthier half.4 Pro-poor economic growth will need to be driven not only by high \nrates  of  public  expenditure,  but  also  by  market-oriented  value  addition  and  private  sector-led \ninvestment.  Access  to  markets,  and  business  and  knowledge  opportunities  and  benefits, \nespecially  along  agricultural  value  chains,  will  be  key  to  further  poverty  reduction  and  shared \nprosperity  in  rural  areas.  However,  these  have  been  hindered  by  poor  transport  infrastructure, \nparticularly poorly maintained provincial and local authority roads. \n \n5. \nSustainable and inclusive development remains a key concept as the government seeks \nto  secure  prosperity  for  everyone.  The  government\u2019s  development  policy  statements  identified \nfive development goals: (i) generate 1 million jobs, (ii) enhance income levels, (iii) develop rural \neconomies,  (iv)  ensure  land  ownership  in  rural  and  estate  sectors,  and  (v)  create  and  grow  a \n                                                 \n1  The  Road  Development  Authority  (RDA)  prepared  the  proposed  investment  program  with  assistance  from  the \nconsultants  recruited  for  the  Integrated  Road  Investment  Program.

This  will  be  achieved  by  grouping  many \nvillages as potential development centers with access to fully equipped rural economic market \nunits, and by upgrading or rehabilitating rural access routes.6 \n \n6. \nRoad map. Sri Lanka\u2019s road network is dense and well laid out, providing basic access to \nthe country\u2019s population and economic activity centers. The 117,012-km road network is classified \ninto  national,  provincial,  and  local  authority  roads,  based  on  administrative  responsibility.7 The \ncentral government is responsible for transport policy. \n \n7. \nNotable  progress  has  been  made  since  2005  in  addressing  trunk  road  network \ndeficiencies,8 but  progress  in  improving  provincial  and  rural  roads  has  been  relatively  slow. 9 \nImprovement  of  the  poor  rural  transport  infrastructure  is  key  to  achieving  the  government\u2019s \ndevelopment  goals.  Improving  connectivity  is  challenging  because  most  rural  access  roads, \nincluding provincial and local roads, cannot provide all-weather, user-friendly access, and parts \nof the trunk road network are in poor condition. These issues stem from (i) competition for budget \nallocations; (ii) limited availability of suitable raw materials; (iii) the limited project implementation \ncapacity  of  road  agencies,  particularly  at  provincial  and  local  levels;  (iv)  ad  hoc  selection  of \nprovincial  and  local  project  roads  that  lacks  clear  criteria;  and  (v)  insufficient  community \ninvolvement in rural road development. \n \n8. \nPreserving the asset value of rehabilitated infrastructure, particularly road infrastructure \nmanaged by  the  provinces  and  local  authorities,  is  also  challenging.10 Several factors  must  be \naddressed to ensure sustainability of rural road assets, including (i) inadequate rural road design \nstandards and construction specifications; (ii) poor provincial and local-level contractor capacity; \n(iii) limited technical maintenance and road asset management capacity on the part of provincial \nand  local-level  road  agencies;  (iv)  lack  of  capital  investment  coupled  with  sound  maintenance \nregimes; and (v) insufficient maintenance budget allocations to rural roads. \n \n9. \nPolicy framework. The government has adopted a two-tier strategy to provide nationwide \nconnectivity:  (i)  establish  a  trunk  road  network  with  expressways  and  well-connected  national \nroads linked to the global value chain, and (ii) complete a rural road network to connect the rural \npopulation  to  trunk  roads  for  poverty  reduction  and  shared  prosperity.  The  Public  Investment \nProgramme, 2017\u20132020, provides policy directions for the road sector to facilitate the country\u2019s \neconomic growth by creating an efficient road network that (i) connects large and emerging cities, \n\n                                                 \n5  From the Prime Minister\u2019s economic statements to Parliament on 5 November 2015 and on 27 October 2016. \n6  The government is implementing a $1.8 billion rural road connectivity investment plan designed to provide physical \ninfrastructure and capacity to enhance rural road connectivity. The previous government originally selected about \n1,000 rural communities as rural hubs, based on their population and development potential. The current government \nrecently expanded the number of rural hubs to 2,500. \n\n7  The  central  government,  through  the  Road  Development  Authority  (RDA),  manages  161  kilometers  (km)  of \nexpressways  and  12,208  km  of  class  A  and  class  B  roads  classified  as  national  roads.  The  provincial  councils \nmanage the provincial road network, which comprises 19,083 km of class C and class D roads. Local authorities \nmanage the 85,560 km of local authority roads classified as class E. In addition, other government agencies (e.g., \nforest and irrigation departments) manage about 20,000 km of roads.  \n\n8  The proportion of national roads in good and fair condition rose from 48% in 2005 to 70% in 2015, and those in poor \n\ncondition declined from 52% to 30% during the same period. \n\n9  The  government has  established a  rural  road  program,  Maga  Neguma,  to  improve  rural roads  through  the  RDA. \nSince 2004, the program has improved about 10,000 km of rural roads at the request of local authorities. In total, the \ngovernment has rehabilitated 4,900 km (26%) of provincial roads, and 39,000 km (37%) of rural roads.  \n\n10 About 80% of the rural access road network still requires rehabilitation. \n\n\f3 \n\ntownships, economic centers, and rural hubs, and (ii) ensures safety and equity.11 \n \n10. \nFor  the  rural  road  network  enhancement  program  (footnote  6),  the  government \nestablished an implementation framework for the Road Development Authority (RDA) to improve \nprovincial  and  local  authority  roads  with  local  road  agencies.  The  objective  was  to  accelerate \ncompletion of the rural road network by supplementing the limited capacity of the local agencies. \nTo  overcome  shortcomings  in  previous  rural  road  development  programs,  the  framework \nincreased subproject selection criteria accountability and strengthened community participation. \n \n11. \nTo manage  the  national  road  network, the  RDA  deployed  a  comprehensive  road  asset \nmanagement  system  in  its  planning  division  and  is  currently  enhancing  the  system,  with \nassistance from the World Bank, to improve internal management efficiency. Expansion of the \nroad  asset management  system to  provincial  and  local  authority  roads  is  supported  under the \nIntegrated  Road  Investment  Program  approved  in  2014.12 A  road  maintenance  trust  fund  was \nestablished in 2005, which through its operational budget provides sustainable funding for routine \nand periodic maintenance of the national road network. The maintenance budget increased from \nSLRs1.8  billion  in  2005  to  SLRs4.3  billion  in  2015,  following  the  establishment  of  the  road \nmaintenance  trust  fund.13 The  budget  increase,  together  with  the  RDA\u2019s  enhanced  technical \nmaintenance capacity and the introduction of a road asset management system, has improved \nthe condition of national roads, but rural road sustainability still needs improvement.14 Initiatives \nwere undertaken in the first program to improve rural road sustainability through (i) improvement \nof  rural  road  design  and  specifications,  (ii)  introduction  of  a  3-year  performance-based \nmaintenance (PBM) contract, and (iii) technical capacity development of local road agencies. \n \nStrategic context. In line with the government\u2019s national strategy, the country partnership \n12. \nstrategy, 2018\u20132022 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for Sri Lanka aims to address major \ndevelopment constraints by (i) strengthening the drivers of economic growth, and (ii) improving \nthe quality of growth.15 The transport sector is a key area for implementing the strategy, and ADB \nplaces high value on improving the accessibility of the road network to integrate rural communities \nwith socioeconomic centers. \n \n13. \nInvestment program. The proposed Second Integrated Road Investment Program aligns \nwith the government strategy and policy to establish fully connected rural development centers \nwith upgraded rural roads. The proposed investment program targets the three lagging provinces \nof Eastern, Northern, and Uva, and Western Province, and will complement assistance under the \nfirst  program  in  other  areas  to  cover  all  of the  country\u2019s  priority  rural  development  hubs.16 The \nproposed  investment  program  will  play  a  catalytic  role  in  the  sustainable  development  of  rural \nareas. \n\n                                                 \n11 Government of Sri Lanka, Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs, Department of National Planning. 2017. \n\nPublic Investment Programme, 2017\u20132020.

Completion Report: Eastern and North Central Provincial Road Project \nin Sri Lanka. Manila). \n\n15 ADB. 2017. Country Partnership Strategy: Sri Lanka 2018\u20132022. Manila.  \n16 ADB approved the first program, with an MFF of $800 million, to upgrade the rural road network in the Central, North \nCentral, North Western, Sabaragamuwa, and Southern provinces, and in the Kalutara district in Western Province. \nThe proposed investment program will also cover the Kalutara district in Western Province (the project allocation to \nthe district under the first program was insufficient). \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nAn MFF is proposed for the financing modality for the investment program because it will \n14. \nallow long-term partnership between the government and ADB on policy dialogue and capacity \ndevelopment within the large-scale program. The MFF uses a time-slicing approach to increase \nthe  efficiency  of  financial  resource  utilization  during  program  implementation. 17  Under  the \nproposed  MFF,  the  RDA  identified  the  projects,  all  of  which  have  a  low  safeguards  risk \nclassification  (none  are  classified  as  category  A).  Subsequent  MFF  tranches  will  finance  the \nidentified projects in accordance with disbursement requirements. \n \nA  portfolio  review  of  ADB-funded  road  projects  confirmed  that  Sri  Lanka  has  adequate \n15. \nimplementation  capacity.  Review  missions  for  the  first  program  also  observed  that  it  is  being \nimplemented  smoothly  with  no  critical  implementation  capacity  issues. 18  RDA  awarded  all \ncontracts  for  rural  roads  under  the  first  program.  Physical  progress  of  the  civil  works  is  about \n47.1% as of June 2017. Lessons from the review are incorporated in the design of the proposed \ninvestment program. Major improvements include (i) stronger community participation, (ii) more \nrational contract package, and (iii) modified contract conditions.19 \n \nDevelopment  coordination.  There  has  been  continuous  coordination  among \n16. \ndevelopment partners active in Sri Lanka\u2019s road sector since 2004, which include ADB, the Japan \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA),  and  the  World  Bank.  JICA  has  assisted  in  the \nrehabilitation of national and provincial roads.20 The World Bank has supported the rehabilitation \nof national, provincial, and local authority roads, and institutional changes and reforms in road \nmaintenance  management.  In  2016,  the World  Bank  approved the Transport  Connectivity  and \nAsset Management Project to support modern road asset management in the RDA.21  \n \nB. \n \n17. \nThe  impact  of  the  investment  program  will  be  improved  connectivity  between  rural \ncommunities  and  socioeconomic  centers  in  Sri  Lanka,  in  line  with  the  Public  Investment \nProgramme, 2017\u20132020. The outcome will be increased transport efficiency on project roads. \n \nC. \n \nThe  outputs  of  the  proposed  investment  program  will  be  (i)  improved  road  conditions \n18. \nbetween the selected rural communities and socioeconomic centers, and (ii) enhanced capacity \nof road agencies.22 \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\n                                                 \n17 Comparison  of  Financing  Modality  and  Approach  to  Time-Slice  Financing  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n18 Summary Review of the First Investment Program (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).

The  MFF  will  consist  of  several  tranches,  subject  to  the  government\u2019s \nsubmission  of  related  periodic  financing  requests,  execution  of  the  related  loan  and  project \nagreements for each tranche, and fulfillment of terms of conditions and undertakings set forth in \nthe framework financing agreement.23 Each tranche will finance parts of the works, equipment, \nand consulting services contracts using the time-slice approach for the large-scale program. Once \na tranche is substantially disbursed, the government will submit a periodic financing request for a \nsubsequent tranche, which will continue to finance the contracts awarded under the first tranche.24 \n \nThe MFF will provide regular and concessional loans up to the aggregate MFF amount. \n21. \nAny allocation for concessional loans will be subject to (i) the availability of such resources, (ii) \nSri Lanka\u2019s access to such resources pursuant to ADB\u2019s Graduation Policy and the requirements \nof donors to such resources,25 and (iii) the availability of such resources to Sri Lanka given ADB\u2019s \nperformance-based  allocation  of  such  resources.26 Any  change  in  the  amount  of  concessional \nloans  will  be  balanced  by  a  corresponding  change  in  the  regular  loans,  with  total  financing \nprovided under the MFF not to exceed the aggregate MFF amount. \n \nThe  first  tranche  of  the  MFF  will  comprise  (i)  a  regular  loan  of  $90  million,  and  (ii)  a \n22. \nconcessional  loan  of  $60  million.

The RDA will strengthen \ncommunity  participation  through  a  context-sensitive  design  approach  to  accommodate  local \nrequests  and  concerns.  Civil  works  contracts  include  3-year  performance-based  maintenance \n(PBM)  (5-year  PBM  for  national  roads)  to  ensure  efficient  maintenance  and  implementation \nperformance of contractors. \n \nB. \n \nEconomic  analysis.  The  economic  analysis  of  the  investment  program  follows  ADB \n26. \nguidelines,  and  compares  life-cycle  costs  in  with-  and  without-project  scenarios,  using  a  9% \ndiscount  rate  and  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  as  decision  criteria.31 All  roads \nproposed  under  all  tranches  of  the  time-slice  investment  program  were  evaluated.  Quantified \nbenefits include savings in vehicle operation costs, travel time, and road maintenance costs, as \nwell as a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. The overall EIRR of the investment program is \nestimated to be 17.2%, with an estimated poverty impact ratio of 34.0%.32 The sensitivity analysis \ndemonstrated the robustness of the projects. \n \n27. \nFinancial sustainability. The project will not generate revenue. Financial requirements \nfor the maintenance of road assets will decrease in the first 10 years after construction due to (i) \nlower  routine  maintenance  costs  resulting  from  improved  pavement  conditions,  and  (ii)  the \ninclusion  of  PBM  contracts.  After  the  PBM  contracts  elapse,  project  road  maintenance  will \nbecome the responsibility of respective road agencies. The incremental recurrent costs of national \nroads are estimated to be 0.7% of the RDA maintenance budget, while the incremental recurrent \n\n                                                 \n29 The main criteria for rural roads are (i) number of households (50 or more); (ii) availability of electricity and water; (iii) \npresence of health and medical facilities, educational facilities, and commercial and market facilities; and (iv) absence \nof land acquisition, and environmentally sensitive areas. \n\n30 The incremental cost to address climate change adaptation is estimated at 5.2% of the civil works cost. This includes \nthe additional cost of drainage, culverts, retaining walls, and concrete pavement in flooded areas to address identified \nclimate risks and vulnerabilities such as flooding, soil erosion, and landslide. \n\n31 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n32 The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) (excluding carbon dioxide emissions savings) is 17.1%. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nGovernance \n\ncosts  of  provincial  and  local  roads  in  Eastern,  Northern,  and  Uva  provinces  are  estimated  to \nrequire a 2%\u20137% increase in the maintenance budget of provincial authorities, and a 29%\u201340% \nincrease in the maintenance budget of local authorities.33 Improvements in institutional funding \narrangements are required to ensure the sustainability of provincial and local road investments \nover  their  design  life.  In  addition  to  the  government\u2019s  commitment  to  allocate  sufficient \nmaintenance  funds,  the  RDA  will  recruit  institutional  management  specialists  under  the \ninvestment program to propose feasible policy improvements or alternatives to the existing road \nmaintenance scheme. ADB will closely monitor progress during program implementation. \n \nC. \n \n28. \nPolicy and legal. Implementation arrangements will involve the central, provincial, and \nlocal  governments. 34  At  the  central  level,  the  Ministry  of  Higher  Education  and  Highways \n(MOHEH)  is  responsible  for  the  formulation  of  policies  and  performance  monitoring.  The  RDA \nwas  established  as  a  statutory  authority  with  separate  legal  status  by  the  Road  Development \nAuthority  Act,  1981.  The  RDA  chairperson  reports  to  the  MOHEH  secretary.  Under  the  13th \namendment to the Constitution (enacted in 1987) and the Pradheshiya Sabha Act, No. 15 of 1987, \nprovincial councils (which constitute provincial-level government agencies) are responsible for the \nwork of local authorities within the areas served by the provincial councils. In keeping with the \ndevolution norm of Sri Lanka, the RDA operates as though it was contracted by the provincial \nauthorities  to  construct  roads  that  belong  to  the  local  authorities.  The  implementation \narrangements  satisfy  the  RDA  Act,  which  requires  the  RDA  to  consult  with  other  government \nagencies  on  projects  within  their  areas.  The  national  steering  committee  and  provincial \ncoordination committees will ensure proper coordination. \n \n29. \nInstitutional capacity. MOHEH and the RDA have sufficient capacity, experience, and \ninstitutional  strength  to  procure  civil  works,  equipment,  select  consultants,  and  administer \ncontracts. Provincial, district, and local authorities will participate in the steering and coordination \ncommittees, with consideration of their respective institutional capacity. \n \n30. \nFinancial  management.  The  RDA  has  prior  and  ongoing  experience  in  implementing \nADB-funded  projects.  A  financial  management  assessment  of  the  RDA  found  that  the  RDA\u2019s \noverall  risk  is  moderate.  The  RDA  has  a  dedicated  project  accounting  and  finance  team  with \nsuitably qualified accountants. The RDA will establish and maintain separate project records and \naccounts to identify the financing resources received and expenditures made for the project, thus \nensuring an adequate audit trail. The government\u2019s Auditor General\u2019s Department will audit the \nproject accounts and financial statements annually, following international auditing standards. \n \n31. \nProcurement and anticorruption. Procurement will be undertaken in accordance with \nthe ADB Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). All consultants will be \nengaged in accordance with the ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time). The Bribery Act, No. 11 of 1954 (as amended from time to time); the Declaration \nof  Asset  and  Liabilities  Act,  No.  1  of  1975;  and  the  Permanent  Commission  to  Investigate \nAllegations of Bribery and Corruption Act, No. 19 of 1994 provide a legal basis for addressing \nbribery  and  corruption.  The  auditor  general  will  check  procurement  activities.  The  ADB \nAnticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the \ngovernment,  MOHEH,  and  the  RDA.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \n\n                                                 \n33 Costs in Western Province are expected to decrease by 3% of the maintenance budget. \n34 The governance arrangements for the proposed investment program are the same as those used in the first program. \n\nNo major issues have been observed in terms of the RDA\u2019s implementation capacity. \n\n\f9 \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nmeasures are described in the facility administration manual. \n \nD. \n \nPoverty  reduction  and  social  impacts.  The  investment  program  will  improve  the \n32. \nsocioeconomic situation and enhance poverty reduction in Eastern, Northern, Uva, and Western \nprovinces  (para.  26).  About  9.8  million  people  live  in  the  project  area\u2019s  145  divisions.  A \nsocioeconomic  assessment  found  that  the  main  sources  of  income  for  users  of  the  proposed \nroads are agriculture, fisheries, self-employment, and wage labor. Employment in the public and \nprivate  sectors  is  significant  in  larger  towns.  Over  90%  of  surveyed  households  described  the \ncurrent road conditions as bad. Communities indicated that poor road conditions affected day-to-\nday  activities.  Improved  access  to  education  and  health,  road  safety,  and  increased  job \nopportunities were listed among the positive benefits expected to result from the improvements. \nMany of the roads to be improved under the investment program are in areas that were affected \nby the 26-year civil conflict, and upgrading these roads will benefit post-conflict rehabilitation and \nthe continued revival of the rural economy. \n \n33. \nGender  and  development.  The  socioeconomic  assessment  found  that  women  were \nactively  engaged  in  family  and  community  activities  and  decision-making  processes,  although \nresults  vary  among  provinces.  Women  surveyed  for  the  assessment  said  they  were  willing  to \nparticipate in the projects by (i) working as maintenance or civil works wage laborers, and/or (ii) \noperating a small business to provide services to contractors. The gender action plan prepared \nfor tranche 1 includes key gender mainstreaming activities.35 Tranche 1 is classified as effective \ngender mainstreaming. \n \n34. \nHIV,  AIDS,  and  human  trafficking.  The  HIV  prevalence  rate  is  low  in  Sri  Lanka.  The \nestablishment of the National Program for Sexually Transmitted Diseases and AIDS Control helps \nrefurbish health clinics and establish outreach and awareness programs throughout the country. \nThe investment program has incorporated measures to mitigate HIV and AIDS risks by providing \nawareness training for civil works contractors and for project-affected communities at prominent \nvillage locations. Awareness-raising activities will be conducted separately for men and women. \nThe social impact assessment did not identify human trafficking as a significant issue in the project \narea. It is anticipated that civil works contractors will hire local laborers; as a mitigation measure, \naffected  communities  will  be  provided  with  awareness  training  on  human  trafficking.  Specific \nprovisions in the bid documents and the works contracts financed under the program will ensure \nthat the contractors follow all applicable international core labor standards and national labor laws. \n \nE. \n \n35. \nInvoluntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. Projects identified under the time-\nslice investment program are classified category B for involuntary resettlement in accordance with \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                 \n35 Gender  Action  Plan:  Tranche  1  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2).  Key  gender \nmainstreaming activities for tranche 1 include (i) ensuring at least 35% of those engaged for design consultations \nare women; (ii) integrating features that increase safety and meet the needs of the elderly, women, children, and the \ndisabled; (iii) encouraging employment of local women as road construction workers; (iv) ensuring that at least 30% \nof local employees hired for road maintenance are women and that they receive equal wages for equal work; (v) \nconducting awareness training on road safety, HIV, and sexually transmitted infections, with women comprising a \nminimum of 40% of participants; (vi) appointing gender focal persons at all levels; (vii) building knowledge and skills \nof the transport sector on gender and inclusivity; and (viii) developing an online grievance reporting mechanism, and \ntracking gender-disaggregated data regarding complainants. \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).36 Rural access road and national road improvements \nwill be made within the existing alignments, with no widening required. Due diligence identified no \nimpacts to land, structures, private trees, or community resource properties. However, minimal \nland  acquisition  for  national  roads  may  be  required  at  black  spots  to  ensure  road  safety.  A \ngrievance redress mechanism will be established in all project areas. The resettlement framework \nwill guide compliance with social safeguard requirements.37 A voluntary land donation system was \nused effectively in the first program, and will be used if land should be required for rural roads \nduring  project  implementation.  Specific  procedural  requirements  for  land  donation  involve \ncomprehensive  consultations  with  the  communities,  and  are  specified  in  the  resettlement \nframework. The government will ensure that land donation is undertaken without coercion and \ndocumented  in  a  transparent  manner,  and  will  have  the  process  verified  by  an  independent \nmonitor. National roads requiring land acquisition will follow government and ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement requirements, as specified in the resettlement framework. The identified projects \nare not expected to impact indigenous peoples and are consequently classified category C. An \nindigenous peoples planning framework has been prepared.38 \n \nEnvironmental  impact.  The  scope  of  works  under  the  investment  program  involves \n36. \nrehabilitation  and  maintenance  of  existing  rural  and  national  roads.  Therefore,  the  identified \nprojects  are  classified  category  B  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  The \nRDA has prepared consolidated provincial initial environmental examination (IEE) reports for the \nfour  provinces,  and  an  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  to  guide  compliance \nwith the environmental safeguard requirements of the government and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement  during  program  implementation.39 The  IEE  and  the  environmental  assessment  and \nreview \nfulfill  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  requirements.  Anticipated \nenvironmental impacts entail typical road construction-related issues such as generation of dust, \nnoise,  exhaust,  and  waste  from  construction  sites  and  worker  camps;  water  contamination; \noccupational health and safety; erosion; and siltation. The standard environmental management \nplan  (EMP),  which  forms  part  of  the  IEE,  includes  mitigation  measures.  Contractors  will  be \nrequired  to  prepare  contract  package-specific  EMPs  based  on  the  final  design,  road-specific \nenvironment checklists, and the standard EMP. The RDA conducted consultations during project \npreparation, and the IEEs incorporate the concerns of the affected persons and stakeholders. \n \nEach provincial project implementation unit will include a senior environment safeguards \n37. \nofficer and environment assistants to monitor the implementation of environment safeguards. In \naddition, the experienced safeguards team from the RDA\u2019s Environment and Social Development \nDivision  will  provide  technical  support  and  monitor  the  implementation  of  safeguards.  The \nenvironment  specialists  and  project  implementation  consultants  will  also  support  program \nimplementation  units  in  monitoring  and  reporting  on  safeguards  implementation.  Project \nimplementation consultants will hold regular safeguards training workshops. \n \nF. \n \n38. \nThe overall risk assessment is moderate. Major risks are (i) insufficient budget allocation \nunder the fiscal consolidation, and (ii) inadequate maintenance of the road asset. These risks and \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nframework \n\n                                                 \n36 The RDA has identified and prepared all projects under the time-slice MFF concept. Tranche 1 and all future tranches \nare classified category B for involuntary resettlement and the environment and category C for indigenous peoples. \n37 Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).
