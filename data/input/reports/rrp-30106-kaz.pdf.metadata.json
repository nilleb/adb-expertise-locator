Technical assistance (TA),\nDeepening  of  Agricultural  Reforms  and  Development\nPrograms, will be provided on approval of the proposal.\nRationale Kazakhstan\u2019s transitional agriculture sector has reached a\nturning point. Major market reforms have been adopted,\nbut many farms, although privatized, have yet to adopt\nfinancially viable management structures and operations\nsuited to a market economy. The banking system provides\nlimited lending  to  farms.  The  farms  use  minimal  inputs\nacquired largely by barter, grow largely traditional, low-\nvalued crops, and maintain excessive social obligations.\nAs a result, they are not financially profitable. To achieve\nthe profitability that Kazakhstan\u2019s soils and climate permit,\na two-pronged approach is required involving (i) advisory\nand  financial  support  to  farms  and  rural  communities\nundergoing  restructuring,  and  (ii)  refinement  and  more\neffective implementation of the policy and legal framework\nfor  agriculture.  The  proposed  Sector  Development\nProgram (SDP) will integrate (i) a project component to\ndirectly  support  farm  restructuring  in  East  Kazakhstan\noblast;  and  (ii)  a  policy  component  to  accelerate  the\nGovernment\u2019s  ongoing  efforts  to  strengthen  the  policy,\nlegal,  and  regulatory  framework  underlying  farm\nrestructuring and commercial lending to agriculture, with\nthe specific objective of creating a suitable environment for\nimplementation of farm restructuring.\nClassification Economic growth\nEnvironmental Assessment Category B\nAn initial environmental examination was prepared and a\nsummary of the results is presented as an appendix.\nThe Sector Development Program\nObjective and Scope The  objective  of  the  SDP  is  to  promote  agricultural\nrecovery and rural growth through a combination of policy\nreform,  institutional  development,  and  investment  to\ndevelop  financially  sustainable  farm  enterprises  and\nagribusinesses,  and  reestablish  and/or  expand  nonfarm\nemployment.  The  policy  reforms  will  be  nationwide  in\nscope,  but  institutional  development  and  investment\nactivities will focus on East Kazakhstan oblast.", "iii\nPolicy Framework and With prior Asian Development Bank (ADB) support,1 the\nActions major  market-oriented  reforms  have  largely  been\ncompleted  in  Kazakhstan\u2019s  agriculture  sector.  The\nproposed policy component will support the Government\u2019s\ninitiatives to deepen, refine, and more effectively apply the\npolicy and legislative measures already undertaken, with\nthe  specific  objective  of  promoting  effective  farm\nrestructuring and viable commercial lending to agriculture.\nThe  SDP's  policy  support  measures  will  (i)  strengthen\nsector monitoring, analysis, and programming; (ii) promote\ntransparent  farm  management  and  secured  lending  to\nagriculture;  (iii)  improve  the  understanding  and\neffectiveness  of  legislation  on,  among  others,  land  and\nfarm  ownership,  accounting,  auditing,  bankruptcy,  and\nmortgages; (iv) promote efficient agricultural taxation and\nuse of water fees; (v) facilitate local private initiatives and\nthe formation of voluntary rural associations; (vi) promote\nefficient pricing of agricultural inputs; and (vii) encourage\nprivate investment in agriculture.\nCapacity Building Kazakhstan\u2019s transition to a market economy requires a\nmuch deeper understanding of economics, finance, and\ncommercial law than exists at present. A wide range of on-\nthe-job and formal training will be provided to develop the\nnecessary  skill  levels  as  quickly  as  possible.  Training\nopportunities  will  be  provided  to  all  beneficiaries,\ncommercial  bank  staff,  and  the  numerous  public\ninstitutions  involved  in  the  complex  process  of\nrestructuring farms and regenerating rural economies.\nThe Investment Project The  Project  comprises  three  basic  components:\ninstitutional  development,  training,  and  credit.  Activities\ninclude the following:\n(i) A rural advisory unit (RAU) will be established in East\nKazakhstan  oblast  to  provide  advice  and  formal\ntraining on the legal and financial aspects of farm\nrestructuring and business management in a market\neconomy.\n(ii) The  process  of  farm  restructuring  will  involve  a\nreduction  in  direct  employment  and  the  social\nobligations borne by the larger farm enterprises. The\nRAU,  working  in  cooperation  with  local\nnongovernment  organizations,  will  support  skills\ntraining and the expansion of rural employment in\nnonfarm microenterprises.\n                                                \n1  Under Loan 1406-KAZ: Agriculture Sector Program, for $100 million, approved on 23 November 1995. The\nProgram was implemented satisfactorily and the second tranche was released in June 1997.", "iv\n(iii)  Farms,  agribusinesses,  and  microenterprises  that\ndemonstrate  a  commitment  to  sound  management\nwill be eligible to apply for credit at market rates for\nworking capital and longer term investment through\nlocal commercial banks.\n(iv) Training and capacity building in commercial banks,\nlocal public agencies, East Kazakhstan\u2019s agricultural\nresearch  and  educational  institutions  will  be\nsupported,  and  an  implementation  unit  established\nwithin the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA).\nSocial and Environmental The marked increase in rural poverty in Kazakhstan can\nMeasures only be arrested by a combination of profitable farms, well-\nmanaged  support  services,  and  growth  of  off-farm\nemployment. The policy component and the investment\nProject  provide  specific  interventions  to  mitigate  the\nundesirable  social  impacts  of  farm  restructuring.  The\nProject\u2019s microenterprise component is directly targeted at\nthe  rural  communities  and  social  groups  likely  to  lose\ndirect farm employment as the result of farm restructuring.\nThe  policy  support  measures  will  reinforce  the  project\ninterventions by providing information to rural communities\nabout their rights, obligations, and opportunities, as well as\nstrengthen the legal and institutional framework for land\nand  farm  ownership,  rural  small  business  development,\nand the formation of voluntary rural associations.\nThe Project\u2019s net environmental impacts will be positive,\nprincipally by (i) removing marginal land from agricultural\nuse (ii) reducing the cultivation of sloping land, and (iii)\nusing more diversified cropping patterns that improve soil\nfertility.  With  support  from  the  RAU,  the  responsible\nGovernment  agencies  will  (i)  ensure  subborrower\ncompliance with all applicable environmental assessment\nand  mitigation  requirements,  and  (ii)  monitor  relevant\nenvironmental parameters such as agrochemical use and\nsoil/water effluents.\nThe Policy Loan\nLoan Amount and Terms The proposed $25 million loan from ADB's ordinary capital\nresources will have a term of 15 years, including a grace\nperiod of 3 years, with interest calculated in accordance\nwith ADB\u2019s pool-based variable lending rate system for US\ndollar loans, and a commitment charge of 0.75 percent per\nannum  on  the  undisbursed  portion  of  the  loan.  The\nGovernment  will  pay  ADB  a  front-end  fee  equal  to  1\npercent of the loan. The fee will be capitalized in the loan.\nProgram Period and  The policy component will be implemented over two years\nTranching from 30 November 2000 to 30 November 2002. The loan", "v\nwill  be  utilized  over  two  years  from  the  date  of\neffectiveness  of  the  Loan  Agreement,  and  will  be\ndisbursed in two equal tranches.\nExecuting Agency Ministry of Finance (MOF)\nProcurement The proceeds of the policy loan will be used to finance a\nbroad range of imports (excluding items specified in the\nnegative list to be provided to the Government and imports\nfinanced by other bilateral and multilateral sources of aid).\nThe  Government  will  be  required  to  submit  with  each\nwithdrawal  application  a  certificate  that  the  volume  of\neligible imports exceeds the amount of ADB's projected\ndisbursements under the loan in a given period. ADB will\nhave the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to\nverify the accuracy of the Government's certification.\nCounterpart Funds The local currency proceeds to be generated from the loan\nwill be used by the Government to finance (i) the costs of\nimplementing the SDP\u2019s policy reforms; and (ii) the local\ncounterpart costs of high-priority development projects and\nTA in the agriculture sector, particularly those financed by\nADB.\nThe Investment Loan\nLoan Amount and Terms The  proposed  loan  of  $20  million  from  ADB's  ordinary\ncapital resources will have a term of 25 years, including a\ngrace  period  of  5  years,  with  interest  calculated  in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  pool-based  variable  lending  rate\nsystem  for  US  dollar  loans,  and  an  annual  commitment\ncharge of 0.75 percent. The Government will pay ADB a\nfront-end fee equal to 1 percent of the loan amount. The\nfee will be capitalized in the loan.\nExecuting Agency MOA\nImplementation MOA will supervise implementation and monitor progress\nArrangements through  its  project  office  in  Astana  and  a  coordinating\noffice  in  Ust-Kamenogorsk.  In  East  Kazakhstan,  the\nProject will be implemented by MOA through the RAU, and\ncoordination will be provided by the oblast administration\n(Akimyat), including the East Kazakhstan Department of\nAgriculture.\nRelending and Onlending The  Borrower  will  relend  the  proceeds  of  the  loan  to\nTerms qualified  commercial  banks  under  subsidiary  loan\nagreements with interest rates reflecting the cost of ADB\nfunds,  plus  an  assessed  level  of  risk  allowance  and\nadministrative costs, and a repayment period of not more\nthan  15  years,  including  3  years  grace.  The  onlending", "vi\ninterest rates to be charged by the commercial banks will\nbe market-based. Loans to subborrowers will be made in\neither US dollars or tenge. The risks of foreign exchange\nand  interest  rate  fluctuations  will  be  borne  by  the\nsubborrowers  or  the  commercial  banks  concerned  in\naccordance with arrangements satisfactory to ADB.\nProcurement All goods and services financed under the ADB loan will\nbe  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for\nProcurement.\nConsulting Services Project implementation will require 76 person-months of\ninternational  and  360  person-months  of  domestic\nconsulting  services,  and  the  TA,  20  person-months  of\ninternational and 28 person-months of domestic consulting\nservices. Consultants will be recruited in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.\nTime Frame The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  five  years  with\ncompletion expected on or about 31 November 2005.\nProject Benefits Over five years, the Project will restore crop and livestock\nproductivity to competitive levels on a core group of farms\ncovering some 400,000 hectares. The Project will support\nthe  development  of  agroprocessing  enterprises  and\npromote nonfarm microenterprise employment to stabilize\nincomes  in  communities  affected  by  farm  restructuring.\nFinancial internal rates of return for indicative farm and\nagribusiness  restructuring  and  investment  initiatives  are\nestimated  to  be  between  33  and  38  percent,  while\neconomic returns range from 36 to 48 percent.\nTechnical Assistance The TA grant of $800,000 will serve two distinct purposes:\n(i) facilitate SDP implementation by assisting MOA and\nother  concerned  agencies  in  evaluating  and  refining\nagricultural  policies  and  legislation;  and  (ii)  support  the\nProject by developing a program  of  applied  agricultural\nresearch and technology dissemination, focusing on East\nKazakhstan. The TA will be financed by ADB from the\nJapan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan.\nRisks and Safeguards Given  Kazakhstan\u2019s  institutional  transition  and  frequent\nchanges in key Government personnel, the SDP\u2019s major\nrisk is that the Government\u2019s commitment to full program\nimplementation falters. However, the reforms supported by\nthe SDP build directly on the constraints identified in farm\nand rural community consultations, as well as the sector\nanalyses and medium-term strategic agenda prepared by\nMOA and other agencies. Stakeholders\u2019 support for the\nreforms is expected to continue. Kazakhstan\u2019s budgetary\nconstraints and some uncertainty in the exchange rate and", "vii\nfinancial sector are likely to persist for at least the next one\nor  two  years.  These  circumstances  lead  to  risks  of\ncounterpart funding shortfalls, as well as to greater caution\namong commercial banks in lending to agriculture. The\nGovernment has initiated endeavors to improve the public\nexpenditure program. The policy component of the SDP\nhas  been  designed  to  encourage  greater  commercial\nlending to agriculture by leveling the playing field for the\nbanks  in  respect  of  the  legal  framework  for  secured\nlending,  farm  accounting/auditing,  liquidation,  and\nbankruptcy.  The  investment  Project  faces  a  number  of\nrisks for which safeguards have been built into the Project\nto minimize the risks. These risks mainly involve the timely\ndevelopment of business skills suited to the needs of a\nrural  market  economy,  the  adoption  of  improved  crop\ntechnology, and the development of credit discipline.", "viii", "I.  THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on two proposed\nloans to the Republic of Kazakhstan for the Farm Restructuring Sector Development Program\n(SDP).  The  report  also  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Deepening  of\nAgricultural Reforms and Development Programs, and if the proposed loans are approved by\nthe Board, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, shall approve the TA.\nII. INTRODUCTION\n2. During  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Country  Programming  Mission  to\nKazakhstan in 1996, the Government requested TA to prepare a project to help farmers adapt\nto  the  postprivatization  environment.  The  Farm  Restructuring  and  Development  TA1  was\nconducted in two phases during May 1997\u2013January 1998. The first phase (i) reviewed the\nperformance of the agriculture sector; (ii) assessed Kazakhstan's comparative advantage in\nselected agricultural commodities; (iii) confirmed the need to establish advisory services for\nprivatized farms and rural enterprises, strengthen the capacity of the commercial banks, and\nimprove the accessibility of working and investment capital for farmers who are adapting to the\npostprivatization environment; and (iv) developed criteria for the selection of regions (oblasts)\nsuitable for a project that would respond to these needs. During the TA's second phase,\ndetailed preparation of a farm restructuring project was conducted in East Kazakhstan oblast.\nThe TA's extensive consultations with farmers, rural communities, and Government agencies at\nthe local and national levels indicated the need to combine project financing with additional\nsupport for the refinement of the policy and legal framework underlying farm privatization and\nrestructuring. The Appraisal Mission visited the project area during May-June 1999.2 The main\nfindings of the Appraisal Mission were updated in June 2000. This report is based on the\nconsultants' studies; the findings of the missions; and discussions with the national and local\ngovernment agencies, the potential participating banks, and farmers in the project area.\nIII. THE SECTOR\nA. Macroeconomic Context\n3. Recent  economic  and  social  trends  in  Kazakhstan  have  underscored  the  need  to\naccelerate growth by diversifying the mix of productive activities, employment, and trade. Five\ndifficult years of macroeconomic disarray followed Kazakhstan\u2019s separation from the former\nSoviet Union (FSU) in 1991. Gross domestic product (GDP) declined by about 50 percent, then\nbegan stabilizing in 1995. The hyperinflation of 1992-1994 was reduced to about 17 percent in\n1997 and to about 2 percent in 1998. GDP grew positively, albeit modestly, at about 1.5 percent\nannually during 1996-1997, but in 1998, the economy contracted by 2.5 percent due to the\ncombined effects of lower international prices for Kazakhstan\u2019s primary exports (oil, copper,\nzinc, and grain); the economic crisis in the Russian Federation,3 which accounts for 46 percent\nof Kazakhstan\u2019s trade; and the ongoing East Asian recession. GDP grew by about 1.7 percent\nin 1999, and is expected to grow by 7 percent in 2000, spurred by higher world commodity\n                                                \n1  TA 2737-KAZ: Farm Restructuring and Development Project, for $1.2 million, approved on 31 December 1996.\n2  The Appraisal Mission comprised F. Roche,  Senior Project Economist and Mission Leader; H. Wang, Senior\nEconomist and Resident Representative, Kazakhstan Resident Mission; N. Bestari, Project Economist; O. Tiwana,\nCounsel; L. Wu, Economist; and R. Gaynor, Legal Specialist and Staff Consultant. The report was updated by F.\nRoche, N. Bestari, and P. Kamayana, Programs Officer.\n3 For details, see IN.289.98: The Impact of the Russian Economic Crisis on the Central Asian Republics, 9\nDecember 1998.", "2\nprices and a significant increase in industrial production. Nonetheless, despite this growth,\nKazakhstan\u2019s GDP will remain at about two thirds of its 1989 level.\n4. The  upsurge  in  industrial  production  is  encouraging,  because  Kazakhstan\u2019s\nmacroeconomic performance during the last three years illustrates how the narrow productive\nbase\u2014energy, minerals, grain, and construction\u2014and continued interdependence with FSU\ncountries  make  the  economy  vulnerable  to  external  shocks.  In  April  1999,  in  the  face  of\ndeclining competitiveness because of exchange rate depreciation in neighboring countries, the\nNational  Bank  of  Kazakhstan  (NBK)  ceased  its  managed  float  of  the  tenge,  leading  to  a\ndevaluation of 33 percent and consequent inflationary pressure. Inflation was estimated to be\nabout 18 percent in 1999, but should be much lower in 2000. Since late 1999, the tenge-dollar\nexchange rate has been stable.\n5. Although the signs are positive, Kazakhstan\u2019s macroeconomic recovery is fragile. Since\nindependence, the Government has been committed to a sound stabilization framework and\nmarket-oriented reforms in the policies, laws, and institutions regulating the economy. This\ncommitment was reconfirmed in December 1999, when the Government and the International\nMonetary Fund agreed on economic guidelines for the next three years. The guidelines focus on\nprudent  monetary  policy,  consolidation  of  public  finances,  and  continued  structural  reform.\nGreater foreign investment to expand the industrial base is being actively encouraged. These\nefforts must be broadened to other sectors if growth is to accelerate and be more broadly felt.\nFiscal constraints will severely limit the level of direct public investment during the medium term.\nThe Government is committed to ensuring high efficiency and cost recovery in its investments,\nwhich, in turn, necessitates a high degree of beneficiary participation and ownership.\n1. Social Issues\n6. The major social issues in Kazakhstan directly reflect the impacts of the macroeconomic\ndisarray. Real wages fell precipitously as a result of hyperinflation during 1992-1994; the decline\nwas exacerbated by delayed wage payments in many sectors, including agriculture. Formal\nemployment declined by 30 percent between 1994 and 1997, although this was offset to some\ndegree by growing economic activity in the private sector, which Kazakhstan\u2019s statistical system\ndoes not yet fully capture. As the command economy collapsed and many industries (including\nagriculture) were privatized, Kazakhstan\u2019s formerly well-developed social services and safety\nnets went into a steep decline. The problem of pensions has received the highest attention of\nthe Government; ADB4 and the World Bank have supported pension system reform. Health care\nand education services provided directly by state enterprises under the command economy\nwere transferred to local governments, which typically have inadequate financial resources to\nbear the responsibility.\n7. According to the United Nations Development Programme, about 43 percent of the\npopulation  lived  in  poverty  in  1998,  reflecting  a  sharp  rise  since  1992.  As  measured  by\nmonetary income, the incidence of poverty is 48 percent in rural areas and 39 percent in urban\nareas.5  At  the  same  time,  rural  households  almost  universally  own  small  plots  that  are\nintensively cultivated, while farm shareholders also usually have access to grain and livestock\nfeed. Together, these resources provide a degree of food security that the urban poor do not\nenjoy. However, rural households are at a distinct disadvantage in terms of access to health\n                                                \n4  Under Loan 1589-KAZ: Pension Reform Program,  for $100 million, approved on 16 December 1997.\n5  United Nations Development Programme. 1999. Human Development Report, Kazakhstan. The cited figures are\nbased on per capita monthly minimum subsistence income as estimated by Kazakhstan\u2019s National Statistics Office.", "3\ncare and other social services, particularly in isolated areas. Kazakhstan\u2019s economic transition\nhas been accompanied by increasing inequality of income. The share of income received by the\nlowest three quintiles of the population fell by 19 percent between 1989 and 1997, a decline that\nwas almost exactly counterbalanced by the 21 percent increase in the share of the top quintile.\nRegionally, the incidence of poverty is far higher in the southern and eastern oblasts than in the\nfar north and west.\n2. Incidence of Poverty\n8. The existence of poverty was never officially acknowledged by the FSU, which, in any\nevent, had well-established safety nets in place. Thus, in response to the postindependence\nsocial trends, the Government has had to develop the capacity to monitor poverty among\nvulnerable  groups,  including  the  unemployed,  households  with  many  dependent  children,\npensioners,  and  invalids.  The  Government\u2019s  strategy  for  poverty  reduction  focuses  on\nemployment  generation,  supplemented  by  programs  providing  monthly  cash  allowances  to\npeople who are unable to work. In 1998, a presidential decree established the National Fund for\nSupport of Low-Income Citizens to provide subsidized microcredits of up to $400 equivalent for\nsmall, largely rural, enterprises. In the same year, the Agency in Support of Small Business was\ncreated to support small-scale, private entrepreneurial initiatives. However, in 1999, financing for\nthese programs was severely curtailed by the growing budgetary crisis. Technical and other\nadvisory  services  to  encourage  employment-generating  activities  remain  scarce,  while  the\nlegislative basis for pro-poor activities such as voluntary cooperative organizations needs to be\nstrengthened.\n9. In April 2000, the ministries of economy, and labor and social protection drafted the\nNational Program for Fighting Poverty and Unemployment 2000-2002. ADB and the United\nNations  Development  Programme  provided  short-term  consulting  services  to  assist  the\nGovernment  to  formulate  this  program,  which  has  the  specific  objective  of  reducing\nunemployment from 13 percent to 9 percent over three years. The Government estimates that\naccomplishing this goal will require resources equivalent to 0.8 percent of GDP in 2000 and 1\npercent in 2001 and 2002. However, the program does not address many aspects of poverty\nthat are not income-based. Nor was the program discussed widely enough to gain strong\nstakeholder  ownership,  including  by  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  and  the  private\nsector, to support its effective implementation. In its most recent country assistance plan, ADB\ncommitted to participating fully with the Government in its poverty reduction efforts, including\nprovision of TA in 2000 to assist the Government in preparing a more comprehensive medium-\nterm poverty reduction strategy. The strategy will consider the full range of human, income, and\ngovernance dimensions of poverty in Kazakhstan. The strategy will be prepared in a manner\nthat ensures strong stakeholder ownership and will be implemented during 2003-2010. Based\non the strategy, ADB's operational strategy for future assistance to Kazakhstan, with a principal\nfocus on poverty reduction, will also be updated in 2001.\nB. Sector Description and Recent Performance\n10. Agriculture presently accounts for about 10 percent of GDP, 14 percent of employment,\nand 10 percent of export earnings. Kazakhstan's rural areas are home to about 47 percent of\nthe country's population and a majority of the poor. Agriculture encompasses extensive grain\nand livestock production primarily in the northern and central oblasts, and more intensive cotton\nand cereal production in irrigated areas of the south. The dry continental climate and short\ngrowing season generally restrict agriculture to a single crop each year. Timely and judicious\nmanagement of soil, labor, and other farm resources are critical in all farming systems. The rain-", "4\nfed areas are cultivated under severe moisture constraints that limit productivity, increase risk,\nand by comparison with most ADB developing member countries, necessitate very large-scale,\ncapital-intensive farm operations.\n11. Since becoming independent of the FSU, the Government has, with ADB support under\nthe Agriculture Sector Program (ASP),6 initiated major policy, legal, and institutional reforms\nintended to accelerate the transition to a market economy. In the agriculture sector, almost all of\nthe  former  state-owned  farms  and  agribusinesses  have  been  privatized;  most  subsidies\neliminated, together with direct national interventions in input and output markets; and a legal\nframework  for  market-led  growth  introduced.  The  progress  in  farm  privatization  has  been\ndramatic.  State  enterprises  now  account  for  less  than  10  percent  of  the  cultivated  area,\ncomprising  primarily  agricultural  research  institutes  and  agricultural  subsidiaries  of  state\nindustrial  enterprises.  Three  basic  types  of  private  farms  have  come  into  existence:  (i)\nproduction cooperatives: 2,380 units nationwide as of April 1999, averaging 14,000 hectares\n(ha) per farm; (ii) corporate partnerships and joint-stock companies: 2,790 units and averaging\n8,500 ha; and (iii) the relatively small, so-called peasant farms: approximately 85,000 units\naveraging  450  ha.7  Overall,  it  is  estimated  that  production  cooperatives  occupy  about  43\npercent of the cultivated area, partnerships and joint-stock companies about 30 percent, and\npeasant farms about 16 percent. While the large farms have generally retained management\nand operational practices similar to those of the FSU period, the peasant farms constitute an\nentirely new class of independent units, created with shares of land and other assets redeemed\nfrom the former state farms.\n12. The country\u2019s macroeconomic disequilibrium and the breakdown of formerly secure FSU\nmarkets have complicated the transformation of state farms into viable private enterprises. The\nelimination of subsidies initially contributed to a sharp decline of the agriculture sector's terms of\ntrade. Cultivated areas, input use, wage payments, and productivity of almost all crops and\nlivestock declined sharply during the immediate postindependence years. Irrigation systems were\npoorly maintained, while farm machinery and other capital assets depreciated as a result of\nphysical deterioration and lack of spare parts. The rural financial system, originally developed\nprimarily to direct subsidized credits to state farms, floundered as a result of accumulating arrears\nand poor management. Social services formerly provided by the farms deteriorated because of\nthe  contraction  of  farm  income  and  the  inability  of  the  national  (Republican)  and  local\ngovernments to fund these services through budgetary resources.\n13. Because of the loss of FSU markets and the nascent entrepreneurial capacity of many of\nthe newly privatized farmers, competitive forces and market-led growth have emerged slowly.\nAgronomic  and  economic  potential  for  diversification  exists  in  the  country\u2019s  better  endowed\nregions, but most farms continue to rely on a narrow range of crops and livestock largely\nunchanged since the FSU period. Inherent agroclimatic variability affects rain-fed agriculture in\nmost of Kazakhstan. Grain production, which accounts for about two thirds of agricultural output,\ndeclined by 28 percent between 1991 and 1995, but showed encouraging gains of 18 percent in\n1996 and 10 percent in 1997 as a result of good weather and improved prices. However, in\n1998, drought, compounded by a sharp decline in international wheat prices, led to a 19 percent\ndrop in the total value of agricultural output. Grain production declined by about 30 percent,\n                                                \n6  Loan 1406-KAZ: Agriculture Sector Program, for $100 million, approved on 23 November 1995, was implemented\nsatisfactorily and the second tranche was released in June 1997.\n7 The average figures obscure the considerable regional heterogeneity of farm size associated with land productivity.\nPeasant farms as small as 10-15 ha are common in the irrigated areas of southern Kazakhstan, but peasant farms\ncan be as large as several thousand ha in the rain-fed, grain-producing regions, where the production cooperatives\nand other corporate entities may be as large as 80,000 ha.", "5\nwhile  the  livestock  economy,  most  noncereal  crops,  and  many  agroprocessing  industries\ncontinued to stagnate.8 Agriculture experienced a bumper year in 1999, despite serious locust\ndamage in some localities. Due in part to favorable weather during the growing and harvest\nperiods, grain production more than doubled as compared with 1998. Equally encouraging,\nprivate investment in agriculture, mainly in postharvest processing, has increased rapidly during\nthe past two years, albeit from a small base. However, these developments are now threatened\nby a growing problem with locusts that reflects, in part, a decline of the standard of farm\ncultivation practices and weaker public sector capacity to directly support agriculture.\n14. If the sector\u2019s performance can be sustained, Kazakhstan can solidify its position as an\nefficient agricultural exporter. During the medium term, there will be growing opportunities to\nexport  competitive  grain,  livestock  products,  oilseeds,  and  commercial  crops  to  emerging\nmarkets in Central Asia, the Middle East, and the People\u2019s Republic of China. However, the\nagronomic potential varies considerably by region, generally being highest in the southern\nirrigated areas and in the northern and eastern regions where there are relatively fertile soils\nand reliable rainfall. In Kazakhstan\u2019s arid steppes, conditions for agriculture are marginal and\nthe distance to markets is a formidable economic barrier. Many farms\u2014created by fiat under the\nFSU  rather  than  in  response  to  market  forces\u2014will  have  great  difficulty,  even  with  good\nmanagement,  in  becoming  financially  viable  in  a  market  economy.  Recognizing  this,  the\nGovernment has focused on measures to facilitate the transition and ease its social costs in its\nrecent strategy formulation for the agriculture sector. The Government also recognizes that the\nfirst, and comparatively easy, phase of legally privatizing farms is over, while a second and more\ncomplicated phase has been initiated in which support services must be provided to directly\nencourage the establishment of truly viable farm enterprises. This new phase will require the\nrefinement of policy reforms at the national level, and equally important, the more effective\nunderstanding and application of policies and legislation at the oblast and district (raion) levels.\nC. Constraints and Issues\n15. Despite the reforms and signs of stabilization in grains, the problems of Kazakhstan's\nagriculture sector are reflected starkly in average output and incomes that are well below their\npotential, the limited diversification and commercial orientation, and the precarious financial\nposition of many farms. Overall, the sector has been trapped in a lingering equilibrium of low\ninputs, low productivity, and low income, in which barter has become the predominant form of\nexchange. Privatization and market liberalization alone have not been sufficient to bring about\nrecovery and growth. Three major groups of constraints have been addressed in the design of\nthe Farm Restructuring SDP.\n1. Inefficient Farm Management and Operations\n16. There is an emerging core of relatively well-managed farms, but the great majority of\nfarm managers and shareholders have yet to adapt their farms to the realities of a market\neconomy. The essence of farm restructuring is to take the necessary steps to\n(i)  adopt clear, stable, and legally sound ownership structures that are consistent\nwith Kazakhstan\u2019s laws;\n                                                \n8\nAs a result of unrecorded production and sales, particularly among the smaller, individually managed farms,\nagricultural output may be significantly underestimated in official statistics. For example, the Food and Agriculture\nOrganization concluded that cereal production was underestimated by about 26 percent in 1996.", "6\n(ii)  ensure independent financial viability in the absence of subsidies by rationalizing\nfarm costs and shedding unprofitable activities;\n(iii)  respond  to  market  opportunities  by  adopting  more  diversified,  commercially\noriented farming systems; and\n(iv)  particularly for the larger corporate farms, form a medium-term farm (3-5 year)\nbusiness  development  plan  encompassing  debt  resolution;9  improved\nmanagement and cash flow; and new investment, primarily in machinery stock.\n17. Even on the best lands, many of Kazakhstan\u2019s large, corporately owned farms typically\nbear an unaffordable burden of labor and social obligations held over from the command\neconomy era. The dilemma is that wage and social costs must often be reduced drastically if the\nfarms are to become financially viable, so attention must simultaneously be given to the creation\nof sustainable new employment for the redundant workforce.\n18. Occupying the largest share of the cultivated area, the country\u2019s production cooperatives\npresent the greatest challenge for future farm restructuring efforts. Despite being fully privatized,\nmost of these farms have retained essentially unchanged management structures. Originally\nconceived as a convenient vehicle for facilitating the initial transition from state ownership, the\nlegal framework underlying production cooperatives complicates their internal management and\nmakes  them  inherently  unstable  enterprises  that have great difficulty attracting commercial\ncredit and outside investment.10 The alternative forms of corporate farm ownership\u2014limited\nliability partnerships and joint-stock companies\u2014have come about more recently and constitute\na step up the evolutionary ladder by providing a clearer and more flexible legal structure.\nHowever, even among these farms, the farming systems are dominated by traditional cereal\ncrops and livestock, produced with minimal inputs for markets that no longer exist. This even\noccurs in regions where soil and water availability would permit more intensive, diversified\nproduction.\n19. The  individually  managed  peasant  farms  have  grown  rapidly  in  number  and  are\ngrappling with a different set of problems. Peasant farm owners\u2014for example, former tractor\ndrivers\u2014often  have  little  farm  management  experience;  unfortunately,  suitably  tailored\nextension and support services do not exist. Owners also face difficulties because the basic\nrural facilities on which they depend\u2013-irrigation, roads, household utilities, and social services\u2014\nwere designed to suit the needs of the former state farms. Because of their small scale, they\nhave difficulty obtaining inputs and marketing outputs. The scope for assisting peasant farms is\nconsiderable and includes forming agricultural cooperatives and other voluntary associations for\nactivities such as credit, input provision, marketing, and irrigation management.\n20. On both large and small-scale farms, farmers typically cite the lack of working and\ninvestment capital, and the rapidly deteriorating condition of their farm equipment as the major\nconstraints to profitable operation. Fuel, agrochemicals, and machinery are available in markets,\nbut the financial capacity of the farms to purchase these inputs is extremely limited, and at\n                                                \n9 As of April 1999, the aggregate outstanding debt of Kazakhstan\u2019s corporate farms was estimated by the Ministry of\nAgriculture at about $800 million equivalent, or approximately $150,000 per farm. This seemingly onerous figure\nworks out to less than $10 per ha on average. It should readily be within the capacity of well-managed farms in\nKazakhstan\u2019s better endowed areas to resolve such debt, a large part of which has been rescheduled by\nGovernment decrees. Nonetheless, there is considerable variation in the debt burden and repayment capacity\namong regions, which is contributing to the accelerated liquidation of nonviable farms in marginal areas.\n10Kazakhstan\u2019s law requires that all shareholders in a production cooperative must also be employed on the\ncooperative: this inhibits outside investment by nonshareholders. Management decisions may be subject to\nunpredictable  shareholder  votes,  while  the  land  and  assets  owned  are  subject  to  sudden  change  when\nshareholders opt to establish independent peasant farms.", "7\ntimes, complicated by the unresolved debts inherited from the former state farms.11 Few farms\npresently use fertilizer and other agrochemicals, and farm machinery and equipment has rarely\nbeen  replaced  during  the  past  several  years.  Assuring  the  necessary  timeliness  of  farm\noperations has become increasingly difficult.\n2. Limited Commercial Lending to Agriculture\n21. Under the guidance of NBK, considerable progress has been made over the past three\nyears in strengthening Kazakhstan\u2019s financial system. In 1994, there were more than 200\ncommercial banks, composed of remnants of the former Soviet system and small, often family-\nmanaged start-up operations of dubious financial health. Through the strict application of NBK\u2019s\nprudential  requirements  and  a  guided  process  of  mergers  and  closures,  this  number  was\nreduced to 102 in late 1996 and to 63 as of late 1999. A core group of private banks now\noperates on market-based principles in Kazakhstan\u2019s second tier financial system.12\n22. However, with the principal exception of Kazagroprom Bank, the former state-owned\ninstitution most active in the agriculture sector, the commercial banks provide little credit to\nfarms at present. The banks are cautious about lending to farms and agricultural enterprises\nbecause  of  the  risks  arising  from  (i)  the  farms'  often  uncertain  ownership  structures  and\nmanagement capacity; (ii) the inherent agroclimatic and biological variability of agriculture; (iii)\nthe incomplete legal framework for secured lending, bankruptcy, and debt resolution;13 and (iv)\nweak markets for land and other collateral assets.\n23. Loan amounts and terms are almost entirely determined by the collateral offered rather\nthan  the  projected  financial  performance  of  the  farms\u2019  proposed  investments.  Collateral\nrequirements\u2014ranging from 150 to 200 percent of the value of requested loans\u2014are difficult for\nfarms to meet, particularly since land and other immovable farm property are rarely accepted.\nAlthough most farmers presently possess certificates of long-term or permanent land use rights,\nthe slow development of a land market effectively reduces the level of bankable credit demand.\nCollateral requirements are particularly onerous for the small peasant farmers who inherited\nland from the former state farms, but typically few other capital assets.\n24. Aside from Kazagroprom, the agricultural portfolios of the major commercial banks are\nlimited to short-term loans, largely to agribusiness and agroprocessing enterprises. Agricultural\nloans make up less than 5 percent of their total lending. Even Kazagroprom tightened its farm\ncredit policy in the face of the macroeconomic uncertainty and rising loan arrears in 1999.\nBecause  of  the  perceived  risks  and  to  avoid  frequent  interference  by  oblast  and  raion\nadministrations in private business affairs,14 responsibility for credit approval in the regional\nbank branches now rests predominantly with headquarters in Almaty.\n                                                \n11Given the scarcity of credit, the farms have resorted to a variety of means to secure fuel, seed, and machinery\nservices. The most common arrangement is forward contracting of a crop in exchange for inputs, often at low\nrealized crop prices. The smallest farms often finance seasonal production costs through the sale of livestock and\nother assets, and the largely informal sharing of farm machinery with neighbors and farms.\n12These banks include TuranAlem Bank, Kazkommerts Bank, Halyk Savings Bank, and Centre Credit Bank.\n13The Government has adopted legislation governing mortgage and pledging of property, but operational guidelines\nand procedures are not yet fully applied. Kazakhstan\u2019s bankruptcy law, passed originally in 1997 and amended in\n1998, gives considerable authority to public agencies in both instituting bankruptcy proceedings and administering\nthese proceedings, whether or not the Government is a major creditor.\n14Interference in the affairs of private farms and rural businesses takes many forms, e.g., efforts to ensure local food\nsecurity by encouraging the planting of food crops; aggressive tax collection, including abrupt seizure of bank\naccounts; mediation between farms and creditors in regard to overdue debts; and solicitation of voluntary\ncontributions from successful enterprises for local poverty reduction programs.", "8\n25. In the eyes of commercial bank personnel, farms are generally perceived as poorly\nmanaged  and  largely  insolvent,  but  the  banks'  reluctance  to  lend  exacerbates  financial\ndifficulties faced by the farms. In turn, given the lack of commercial credit, farmers have come to\nfulfill most of their working capital requirements through barter trade and forward contracting\nwith  input  suppliers  and  commodity  traders.  The  opaque,  informal  nature  of  barter  trade\ncomplicates the assessment of the financial capacity of potential borrowers and acts as a\ndisincentive for lending by the banks.15\n26. The  uncertainty  associated  with  the  depreciation  of  the  tenge  led  the  banks  to\nincreasingly  resort  to  dollar-based  lending.  In  the  tight  monetary  environment  triggered  by\nKazakhstan\u2019s financial crisis in 1999, interest rates rose to 14-18 percent per annum in dollar\nterms, reflecting the rising opportunity cost of funds for the banks.16 Currently, most lending is\nfor short-term working capital for periods no greater than six months and limited largely to\nestablished trading, service, and manufacturing enterprises. Commercial bank personnel have\nserious doubts about the capacity of farms and rural enterprises to service dollar-equivalent\ndebts on these terms, especially given the significant foreign exchange risk that is borne by the\nborrowers. Overall, these conditions have significantly curtailed the demand for long-term loans.\nSince many farms have become discouraged about their prospects for obtaining loans, the\nvolume of loan applications currently reported by the banks reflects only a small share of the\ndemand that exists.\n27. Simply augmenting the supply of funds for credit will not solve these problems. The risks\nof lending to agriculture are a more fundamental constraint than bank liquidity; Kazakhstan\u2019s\ncommercial banks have limited experience in critically appraising and managing agricultural\nloans in a market economy. Suitable training and capacity building in the rural financial sector\nare necessary to encourage banks to gradually move from collateral-based to performance-\nbased lending. This capacity building must be accompanied by support to establish a core\ngroup of successful farms that demonstrate that performance-based lending can be prudent and\nprofitable.\n3. Lack of Understanding of Agriculture in a Market Economy\n28. For farms, rural communities, banks, and rural public agencies, equitable rural growth is\nconstrained by lack of information and knowledge. The information gap encompasses two\ndimensions: (i) lack of understanding\u2014among rural communities and local administrations\u2014of\nlegal rights and opportunities, and (ii) lack of knowledge about business management in a\nmarket economy. Kazakhstan now has a reasonably comprehensive body of legislation on\nmatters  such  as  land  and  property  rights,  farm  ownership,  taxation,  secured  lending,  and\nbankruptcy. While refinements of this legislation are needed, the major challenge is to ensure\nthat the legal framework is correctly understood and applied at the local level. The process of\nprivatization involved little or no provision of information and guidance to rural communities\nabout their legal options, rights, and obligations. During 1996 and 1997, many rural families,\nencouraged by the former state farm managers, and often by oblast and raion administrations,\ntransferred their shareholding rights to the farm managers in exchange for legally undocumented\n                                                \n15Although lending to farms has been scaled back, the banks have increased their lending to food processing\nindustries, which, in turn, often extend seasonal loans to farms under forward contracts. Although no data are\navailable on the extent of this onlending, these arrangements are accepted by the banks because the risks are\nborne by the processing enterprises.\n16Short-term dollar-based deposit rates for up to 12 months also increased to 10-15 percent per annum in late 1999.\nIn tenge terms, the interest rates rose to 25-30 percent per annum by late 1999, and declined to 18-21 percent by\nJuly 2000.", "9\npromises of continued employment, dividends, and in-kind services. In 1997 and 1998, the\nMinistry of Agriculture (MOA) organized oblast-level seminars to explain the new policy and legal\nframework for agriculture. But, in a country as vast as Kazakhstan, much greater effort is needed\nto ensure that the necessary information reaches the rural communities.\n29. The pace and equity of the transition to a market economy will depend critically on the\ndepth of understanding of market economics, finance, and commercial law at all levels of\nsociety. Farm restructuring cannot succeed without a significant upgrading of agribusiness\nmanagement skills to international standards. Farmers need new knowledge on subjects such\nas farm business planning and accounting; recent developments in markets; crop and livestock\nproduction technology; and the formation of voluntary, cooperative organizations. At present,\nthere is little of the necessary expertise in these areas at the local level. Competent technical\nspecialists are often available, but there is a need to supplement their skills with knowledge\nabout recent advances in production technologies, as well as basic market economy principles.\nD. Government Expenditure\n30. After  Independence,  and  with  the  termination  of  subsidies  from  the  FSU,  public\nexpenditures fell sharply from 33 percent of GDP in 1990 to 18 percent in 1994, and ranged\nfrom 19 percent in 1995 to 21 percent in 1999. Government budgetary operations in agriculture\namounted to T7.2 billion in 1995, T6.7 billion in 1996, T6.5 billion in 1997, and T4.8 billion in\n1999 (all in 1995 prices). Almost half of the Republican budget for MOA in 1999 consisted of\ninvestment projects that were partly financed by external sources of funds. In 1999, local\ngovernment budgets for agriculture, forestry and fishery amounted to T1.6 billion in current\nterms, representing less than 18 percent of the total public spending on agriculture. Compared\nwith public spending on other sectors, public expenditures on agriculture are small. With tight\nfiscal constraints and significant reduction in subsidies, Government spending on agriculture\ndecreased from 3.5 percent of the total public expenditures in 1995 to 1.9 percent in 1999.\nE. Government Objectives and Strategy\n31. The Government has given considerable attention to the agriculture sector in its long-\nterm strategic planning. MOA, in cooperation with the Agency for Strategic Planning (AgSP),\nrecently prepared a medium-term strategy for the accelerated completion of reforms in the\nagriculture  sector.17  This  strategy  includes  measures  to  (i)  complete  the  process  of  farm\nrestructuring, in part by applying, when required, bankruptcy procedures specific to the needs of\nagriculture; (ii) develop market infrastructure and market information services; (iii) stimulate the\nformation of cooperatives and voluntary farmer associations; (iv) enhance access to financial\nservices; and (v) stimulate domestic and foreign private investment in the sector. The objectives\nand scope of the SDP are fully consistent with this medium-term strategy.\n32. The Republican Working Committee was formed in February 1998 to analyze progress\nin  farm  restructuring,  focusing  on  the  country\u2019s  remaining  production  cooperatives.  The\ncommittee recommended steps to (i) legally register all shares in such cooperatives, and (ii)\nencourage their restructuring into more financially viable farm structures. The committee also\nrecommended action to monitor and strengthen the financial performance of the country\u2019s large\n                                                \n17In November 1997, the Government issued a long-run strategic statement, Kazakhstan 2030. Government line\nagencies, including MOA, have collaborated closely with AgSP to draft medium-term plans to realize this vision at\nthe sector level.", "10\ncorporate farms, and to provide information to farm shareholders on their farm restructuring\noptions. These efforts will be enhanced under the proposed SDP.\n33. Although medium-term fiscal constraints will severely limit the Government's capacity for\ndirect investment in the sector, including that financed through external borrowing, MOA has, in\npart with ADB assistance,18 strengthened its efforts to monitor and support the agriculture\nsector, recently conducting a nationwide survey and analysis of the operational and financial\nperformance of Kazakhstan's relatively large-scale, corporately owned farm enterprises. In early\n1999,  MOA  was  reorganized  to  consolidate  its  capacities  to  (i)  analyze  national  and\ninternational market developments, (ii) refine and more effectively implement market economic\nreforms, (iii) provide technical support services and facilitate the provision of credit, and (iv)\nencourage private sector investment. Activities proposed under the SDP will complement and\nreinforce MOA\u2019s institutional strengthening efforts.\n34. The  Government\u2019s  strategy  has  increasingly  addressed  the  need  to  generate  new\nemployment in rural areas. In addition to the National Fund for Support of Low-Income Citizens\n(para. 8), the Small Business Development Fund was created in 1997 to provide investment\ncredits to small- and medium-size nonfarm enterprises.19 The Government is preparing a new\nnational program for fighting poverty and unemployment 2000-2002 (para. 9). To further the\ngoals of the newly established Agency in Support of Small Business, the Government issued a\ndecree in 1998, clarifying the legal rights of citizens for freedom of business activity. The\nproposed SDP will enhance the effectiveness of these efforts.\nF. External Assistance to the Sector\n35. Besides ADB, several international financial agencies and bilateral sources are assisting\nKazakhstan\u2019s  agriculture  sector.  The  SDP  was  prepared  in  close  coordination  with  these\norganizations. Of most direct relevance to the SDP are the programs financed by the World\nBank,  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development,  the  European  Union's\nTechnical Assistance for the Confederation of Independent States (EU-TACIS), and the United\nStates. In 1997, the World Bank approved the Real Estate Registration Pilot Project for $10\nmillion, followed in 1998 by the Agricultural Post-Privatization Support Project for $15 million.20\nThe European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the United States Government\nare financing credit lines for onlending to micro, small, and medium-size enterprises, including\nthose in the agriculture sector. Access of SDP beneficiaries to these funds as an alternative to\nproject financing will be explored, where appropriate, during project implementation.\n36. EU-TACIS has implemented three pilot projects for the restructuring of privatized farms\nand  agribusinesses  into  more  profitable  units.21  In  1998,  EU-TACIS  commenced  the\n                                                \n18ADB-financed TA has supported MOA\u2019s institutional strengthening, including TA No. 2356-KAZ: Strengthening the\nImplementation of Agriculture Sector Reforms, for $600,000, approved on 4 July 1995; and TA No. 2448-KAZ:\nStudy on Market Reforms in the Agriculture Sector, for $1.044 million, approved with the ASP on 23 November\n1995. TA 2449-KAZ: Study on Rural Credit and Savings, for $0.47 million, approved on 23 November 1995,\nprovided a comprehensive analysis of the rural financial sector.\n19The Small Business Development Fund has been financed, in part, with second-tranche proceeds of the ASP.\n20Both  projects  are  being  implemented  in  the  oblasts  of  Akmola  and  Almaty.  The  SDP's  farm  restructuring\ncomponent and the Agricultural Post-Privatization Support Project have similar objectives (although different\ndesign) and will logically share common implementation arrangements within MOA. A follow-on to the Real Estate\nRegistration Pilot Project is presently under preparation and will extend the Government\u2019s real estate registration\nsystem into two new oblasts, including East Kazakhstan.\n21These include (i) Support to Food Processing in Aktubinsk Oblast, (ii) Private Farmers Organizational Support, and\n(iii) Pilot Development of Private Farming and Food Processing in Akmola Oblast.", "11\nimplementation of a project, Support to Rural Credit Improvement, that will provide technical\nadvice and training to commercial bank staff in Almaty and Akmola oblasts. The Agricultural\nManagement and Market Information System Project, completed in mid-1998, developed a\ncomprehensive database on prices and markets for nationally disseminated publications. During\nthe coming few years, MOA intends to expand this system so that it provides more regionally\ndisaggregated  information  in  high-priority  agricultural  oblasts.  Finally,  in  2000,  EU-TACIS\ninitiated a two-year project, Support to Establish a Vertical Market Structure, with objectives to\n(i) establish assembly markets, possibly including input supply; (ii) strengthen oblast market\ninformation systems and link these to the national system; (iii) strengthen farmer cooperatives;\nand (iv) promote efficient competition among agricultural traders and business persons. All of\nthe EU-TACIS-supported projects are highly complementary to the objectives of the SDP, and\nformal linkages to their activities will be made where appropriate.\n37. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is financing a variety\nof  projects  that  are  highly  complementary  to  the  SDP.  Of  particular  relevance  are  the\nCommercial Law and Accounting Reform projects, which are helping the ministries of justice\nand finance (MOJ/MOF) and other agencies (i) prepare the legal framework for private sector\ninvestment  and  (ii)  develop  private  financial  institutions,  including  legislation  related  to\nmortgage, accounting, auditing, and bankruptcy. The Fiscal Reform Project is providing training\nand policy advice in support of the efforts of MOF to rationalize and improve the efficiency of\nKazakhstan\u2019s  tax  system.  If  fully  implemented,  the  recommendations  of  this  project  will\nsubstantially improve the transparency and equity of the tax burden borne by farms. USAID\u2019s\nKazakhstan Community Loan Fund is presently setting up the country's first credit union in a\npilot project that is being monitored closely by NBK. In the area of environment, USAID-financed\nprojects have assisted MOA's Committee for the Management of Water Resources in forming\npilot water user associations (WUAs) and in drafting legislation on water pricing. USAID\u2019s\nFarmer-to-Farmer Program and the joint USAID/Israeli Cooperative Development Program are\nproviding  TA,  training,  and  farm  demonstration  activities  in  animal  husbandry,  greenhouse\nfarming, irrigation, crop production, and food processing.\nG. ADB\u2019s Operations and Strategy in the Sector\n38. The objectives of ADB's operational strategy for Kazakhstan include (i) encouraging the\ntransition to a market economy, (ii) promoting rehabilitation of the environment, (iii) strengthening\nthe long-term potential for sustainable growth through investment in physical infrastructure and\nhuman resources, and (iv) encouraging private sector investment. Since commencing lending\noperations in Kazakhstan in 1995, ADB has been a major source of external finance and\nadvisory TA in the agriculture sector. The SDP is a logical step in ADB\u2019s phased sequence of (i)\nsupport  for  market-oriented  policy  reforms,  and  (ii)  direct  investment  in  sustainable,\nenvironmentally sound projects to promote growth. The proposed loans would be the fourth and\nfifth for ADB in the agriculture sector, after the ASP (footnote 6) and the Water Resources\nManagement and Land Improvement Project.22 ADB is also preparing assistance to strengthen\nthe Government\u2019s capacity to deal with the recent upsurge of locusts in Kazakhstan\u2019s northern\ngrain-producing regions.23\n                                                \n22Loans 1592/1593(SF)-KAZ: Water Resources Management and Land Improvement Project, for $40 million,\napproved on 17 December 1997.\n23 Under TA 3442-KAZ: Preparation of the Locust Management Project, for $100,000, approved on 19 May 2000.\nBased on the outcome of the TA and a request from the Government, ADB will provide a separate technical\nassistance in 2001 to Kazakhstan to help MOA and other agencies formulate and implement an environmentally\nsound strategy for locust management.", "12\n39. Although  ADB\u2019s  experience  in  implementing  agriculture  sector  projects  is  relatively\nlimited in Kazakhstan, several important lessons have been applied in formulating of the SDP.\nFirst, the situation in the sector may be depressed, but it is hardly static. There has been and\nwill continue to be significant dynamism in the institutional and policy framework, as well as in\nthe domestic and external economic environment. Hence, projects and TAs must be designed\nwith enough flexibility to respond proactively to changes and emerging opportunities. To ensure\nthat this occurs, there must be sustained monitoring and evaluation of the impacts of policies,\nlaws, and economic incentives. More importantly, in a country as large as Kazakhstan, central\nguidance must ensure that national policies and laws are properly understood and implemented\nat the local level.24 Second, because of the major downsizing of national agencies during the\nlast few years, as well as the country\u2019s fiscal constraints, project and TA design requires a high\ndegree of decentralization to, and ownership by, the local agencies and beneficiaries who will\nbear most of the responsibility for cost recovery. The SDP and its investment Project reflect the\nfindings of extensive consultations with farmers and rural communities about the financial,\ninstitutional, and technical constraints to rural employment and income growth.25 Third, the\nGovernment has made a major effort during the past two years to recruit a new generation of\nenergetic, reform-minded personnel, but this has not been sufficient to overcome the lack of\nknowledge  about  managing  agriculture  in  a  market  economy.  While  experience  has  been\ngained in the administrative procedures of ADB and other international institutions, the roster of\npersonnel in public agricultural agencies has been in constant transition. Training and capacity\nbuilding will continue to be needed in areas such as market economics, project management,\nand environmental assessment.\nIV.  THE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM\nA. Rationale\n40. Kazakhstan\u2019s transitional agriculture sector has reached a turning point. Major market\nreforms  have  been  adopted,  but  widespread  understanding  of  the  reforms  has  not  been\nachieved and their expected impacts have not fully materialized at the oblast level. The farms\nhave been privatized and almost fully separated from state support systems, but most have yet\nto adopt financially viable management structures and operations suited to a market economy.\nUnder NBK supervision, the rural banking system is being strengthened, but only limited lending\nis available to farms. The farms, in turn, use minimal inputs that are acquired largely by barter;\ngrow primarily traditional, relatively low-value crops; and maintain excessive social obligations.\nAs a result, most are not financially profitable. To escape this moribund equilibrium and achieve\nthe profitability that Kazakhstan's soil and climate would permit, a two-pronged approach is\nrequired: (i) provision of information, and advisory and financial support to the farms and rural\ncommunities that undergo restructuring; and (ii) refinement and more effective implementation\nof the policy and legal framework for agriculture. Thus, the SDP will integrate (i) an investment\nproject component to directly support farm restructuring; and (ii) a policy component to support\nand  accelerate  the  Government\u2019s  ongoing  efforts  to  strengthen  the  comprehensiveness,\nunderstanding, and application of the policy, legal, and regulatory framework underlying farm\nrestructuring and commercial lending to agriculture. The reforms supported by the policy loan\nwill be instrumental in creating a suitable environment for the implementation of the Project. In\nthe absence of such interventions, the future will see continuing stagnation of many farms and\n                                                \n24 IN.206-99: Agriculture Sector Program, August 1999.\n25These consultations were conducted throughout Kazakhstan's major agricultural oblasts during the first phase of\nthe project preparatory TA (para. 2) and subsequently focused on the project area as the SDP's design was\nfinalized.", "13\nincreasing rural unemployment despite the agronomic and economic potential for regeneration\nand growth.\nB. Objective and Scope\n41. The SDP\u2019s objective is to promote agricultural recovery and rural growth by (i) refining\nthe policy, legal, and institutional framework for market-led agriculture; (ii) providing public\ninformation and education on agriculture nationwide; (iii) directly supporting the development of\nfinancially  sustainable  farm  enterprises  and  agribusinesses;  (iv)  directly  supporting  the\nreestablishment and/or expansion of nonfarm employment and income-generating activities in\nrural  communities;  and  (v)  strengthening  capacity  in  local  government  agencies  and\nparticipating commercial banks (PCBs) so that they can better serve the needs of agriculture\nand  the  rural  communities.  Appendix  1  presents  the  logical  framework  for  the  Farm\nRestructuring SDP.\nC. Policy Framework and Actions\n42. With prior ADB assistance under the ASP, the major market-oriented reforms for the\nagriculture sector have been largely completed at the national level. Since the release of the\nsecond tranche of the ASP in June 1997, the Government has endeavored to improve its\nmonitoring, analysis, and response to the identified problems of agriculture, even though its\nfinancial and human resources are very limited relative to the country\u2019s size. As detailed in the\ndevelopment policy letter (Appendix 2) and the policy matrix (Appendix 3), the Government\u2019s\ninitiatives have included the following:\n(i)  since 1997, (a) continued strengthening of MOA\u2019s capacity for market analysis\nand  information  provision;  (b)  substantial  efforts  to  deepen  the  legal  and\nregulatory  framework  for  property  rights,  mortgage,  secured  lending,  farm\naccounting, auditing, and agricultural bankruptcy; (c) initial efforts to promote\nwider public understanding of the legal and policy framework for agriculture; and\n(d) the promotion of simplified and more transparent agricultural taxation;\n(ii)  since 1998, (a) an ongoing nationwide survey of the financial status of corporate\nfarms; (b) efforts to promote restructuring of production cooperatives into more\nstable, efficient farm structures; and (c) efforts to directly promote and protect the\nrights of microenterprises and small private businesses;\n(iii)  in 1999, (a) reorganization and rationalization of the functions of MOA and other\ncentral ministries concerned with agriculture; and (b) passage of the Law on\nRural Consumer Cooperatives; and\n(iv)  also in 1999, the submission to Parliament of a draft land law to replace the\nexisting  Presidential  Decree  on  Land  (No.  2717  of  1995).  Among  other\nmeasures,  the  draft  land  law  provided  for  conversion  of  land  use  rights  to\nownership rights by individual citizens. With Government encouragement, the\ndraft land law was widely publicized within Kazakhstan. In the ensuing public\ndiscussion, widespread concern was expressed that Kazakhstan was not yet\nready to cede permanent land ownership rights to private individuals. As a result,\nthe land law was withdrawn from Parliament for amendment and resubmission at\na later date. Although public opinion does not yet favor full land ownership, this\nexperience illustrates the Government\u2019s intent to deepen the reform process and", "14\nits increasing efforts to involve the public in the consideration of major policy\nissues.26\n43. The SDP was formulated in the light of the Government\u2019s commitment to market reforms\ndespite severe public resource constraints. Rather than requiring dramatic new reforms, the\npolicy component is evolutionary and will support the Government\u2019s initiatives to deepen, refine,\nand more effectively apply the institutional, legislative, and policy measures already undertaken,\nwith  the  specific  objective  of  promoting  effective  farm  restructuring  and  viable  commercial\nlending to agriculture. Thus, the policy component is fully consistent with the Government\u2019s\nagriculture sector strategy, and will enhance eight areas of reform:\n(i)  The policy component will deepen MOA\u2019s efforts to strengthen sector monitoring,\nanalysis, and programming. MOA\u2019s surveys of sector and farm performance will\nbe expanded in coverage, a system of computerized market information centers\nwill be established, and with support from the accompanying TA (para. 94),\ndomestic agricultural research programs will be strengthened.\n(ii)  The growth of agriculture will be promoted by creating a stronger collateral basis\nfor commercial lending to farms, and supported by expanding the system for\nregistering rights to immovable property into East Kazakhstan and at least one\nother high-priority oblast.\n(iii)  More transparent farm management and a stronger legal framework for secured\nlending  will  be  promoted  through  the  adoption  by  MOF  of  international\naccounting and auditing standards, and the application of suitable accounting\nand  auditing  standards  to  farms  and  agribusiness  enterprises  that  are  legal\nentities.  With  TA  support,  the  Government  will  also  evaluate  and  refine,  as\nnecessary, legislation on agricultural bankruptcy, and on the pledging of movable\nproperty and mortgage of immovable property.\n(iv)  Through a nationwide public information campaign, the policy component will\ndirectly promote greater understanding of agriculture in a market economy. Using\nmass media, publications, training courses, and seminars, the campaign, to be\nprepared with TA support, will include the legal rights, obligations, and economic\nand financial opportunities associated with alternative forms of land tenure and\nfarming  structures;  pledging  of  movable  and  immovable  property;  agricultural\ntaxation;  bankruptcy;  formation  of  voluntary  farmer  associations;  and  conflict\nresolution, including conflicts that arise from interference by local administrations in\nfarm decisions.\n(v)  To promote more efficient collection of agricultural taxes and use of water fees,\nthe  Government  will  continue  its  reforms  of  agricultural  tax  policy  and\nadministration. In addition, based on the findings of ongoing ADB-financed TA,27\nthe Government will improve procedures to collect water fees and rationalize the\nallocation  of  these  fees  between  oblast  administrations  and  the  national\nGovernment. Starting in 2002, a line item in the Republican budget will provide\nfunding for operation and maintenance of drainage and irrigation infrastructure,\ntaking into account the level of collection of water fees for past years.\n                                                \n26From the standpoint of the SDP, the legal framework for land tenure embodied in the 1995 Presidential Decree on\nLand provides adequate incentives for the development of competitive agriculture as it allows long-term land use\nrights to be bought, sold, exchanged, bequeathed, leased, and mortgaged.\n27TA 2946-KAZ: Institutional Development and Policy Reforms for Improving Water Management, for $600,000,\napproved on 17 December 1997 attached to Loan 1592/1593 (SF)-KAZ: Water Resources Management and Land\nImprovement Project, for $40 million, approved on 17 December 1997.  The TA commenced in June 2000.", "15\n(vi)  The policy component will encourage local private initiative through measures to\nreduce interference by local administrations in farm and rural business affairs, and\nto facilitate the formation of voluntary rural associations, including cooperatives\nand water user groups. With TA support for critical reviews of the Civil Code and\nother existing laws governing voluntary associations, new or, as appropriate,\nrevised legislation will be prepared to facilitate the establishment and functioning\nof such associations. A specific goal is to establish clear legal procedures for the\ntransfer of irrigation and drainage systems to water users.\n(vii)  Efficient pricing of agricultural inputs, a key thrust of the ASP, will be continued.\nThe Government\u2019s programs for subsidized farm and microenterprise credits,\nsuspended since late 1998, will not be reintroduced except as specifically agreed\nupon by the Government, ADB, and World Bank. In addition, except as otherwise\nagreed, the Government will continue its policy of not subsidizing meat, wool,\nfertilizer, and other production inputs used in agriculture.\n(viii) Recognizing that encouraging foreign private investment will facilitate the market-\nled  diversification  of  agriculture,  the  Government  will  conduct  a  survey  of\npotential  foreign  investors,  and  prepare  and  implement  recommendations  to\nimprove foreign investment incentives. Domestic oilseed processing is a key\nsubsector in which a sharp decline in capacity over the past seven years now\nconstrains potential crop diversification by farmers. Hence, as part of the policy\ncomponent, MOA will review the recent developments in oilseed production and\nprocessing, and prepare recommendations to encourage the efficient revival of\nthis industry.\nD. Capacity Building\n44. Training of trainers and beneficiaries is an indispensable part of the SDP. Staff of farm\nenterprises,  rural  businesses,  private  farmer  associations,  and  participating  NGOs  will  be\nprovided with a range of training opportunities to achieve the necessary skill levels as quickly as\npossible. On-the-job and formal training financed by the investment Project will include (i)\nagriculture  and  farm  management  in  a  market  economy;  (ii)  awareness  training  for  all\nbeneficiaries; (iii) agricultural law; (iv) microenterprise development, including bookkeeping and\naccounting in addition to vocational and marketing skills; and (v) cooperative development. In\naddition,  formal  linkages  will  be  developed  with  relevant  capacity  building  efforts  of  other\nexternal agencies, particularly EU-TACIS and USAID (paras. 36-37).\n45. The investment Project will provide a variety of training opportunities for microenterprise\ndevelopment  workers  and  business  owners  in  areas  such  as  credit  delivery,  business\naccounting and management, marketing and product development, and specialized vocational\nskills. The Project will also support training and capacity building within the participating banks.\nA long-term agricultural credit specialist (Appendix 4) will advise the banks, other financial\nintermediaries, and the concerned public agencies on the organization of agricultural and small-\nscale lending activities at the oblast and raion levels, including the formulation of procedures\nand methods for rural credit appraisal and loan monitoring.\n46. Numerous public and private institutions will be involved in the complex process of\nrestructuring farms and regenerating rural economies. These include the national, oblast, and\nraion  offices  of  MOA,  the  PCBs,  oblast  administration  personnel  responsible  for  poverty\nreduction programs, and the agricultural research and training institutions, together with local\noffices of MOJ, the courts, and the State Committee for Land Tenure and Land Relations\n(Goskomzem). On-the-job and formal training will be provided to ensure that these agencies are", "16\nprepared to implement and manage the Project, to sustain the activities beyond the period of\nADB financing, and to independently replicate the project approach elsewhere in Kazakhstan.\nThe key inputs for accomplishing these tasks will include (i) long-term consulting advisers in\nfarm and agribusiness management and agricultural credit; (ii) short-term specialists, recruited\nas needed, to strengthen skills in diverse areas such as farm machinery and equipment, project\nmanagement, and water and environmental management (Appendix 4); and (iii) the institutional\nstrengthening support to be provided under the accompanying TA (para. 94).\nE. The Investment Project\n1. The Project Area\n47. East Kazakhstan oblast occupies the northeastern corner of the country, and is bordered\non the north by the Russian Federation and on the east by the People\u2019s Republic of China. The\noblast\u2019s population of 1.6 million people is 43 percent rural. The oblast covers some 288,000\nsquare  kilometers  and  is  characterized  mainly  by  three  distinct  agroecological  zones:  (i)\nmountainous areas in the south and north, where annual precipitation is greater than 500\nmillimeters (mm); (ii) the relatively fertile upper foothills and lower-lying floodplains in the center,\nwhich have precipitation of 350-500 mm and receive significant growing-season runoff from the\nmountains; and (iii) the semiarid steppes in the west, where annual precipitation usually is below\n300 mm. Overall, the agricultural potential of the foothills and floodplains is considerable, far\nexceeding that of the steppes. The lower mountain areas also have good agricultural potential,\nbut require suitable soil conservation techniques.\n48. The selection of East Kazakhstan for inclusion in the Project was based on careful\nconsideration  of  a  variety  of  criteria,  including  (i)  nature  and  potential  of  the  agricultural\neconomy; (ii) farming structure, including the need and scope for restructuring; (iii) level of farm\nindebtedness;  (iv)  availability  of  potential  participating  bank  branches  in  rural  areas;  (v)\nreceptiveness  and  capacity  of  local  agricultural  agencies,  including  research  and  training\ninstitutions;  and  (vi)  socioeconomic  characteristics.28  East  Kazakhstan  has  a  large  rural\npopulation in a predominantly agricultural oblast. Its agroecological zones are representative of\nKazakhstan\u2019s  high  potential  rain-fed  areas.  Farm  debt  levels  in  the  oblast  are  generally\nmanageable, while the basic capacities of the public institutions and banks are judged to be\nabove  average.  Local  farmers  and  public  agency  personnel  have  expressed  considerable\ninterest and commitment to the proposed activities of the Project.\n49. Not all of East Kazakhstan\u2019s 15 raions have the required agroclimatic potential for\nfinancially sustainable growth in a market economy. The foothill areas of highest potential are\nconcentrated in the oblast\u2019s northern, northeastern, and east central regions. These areas cover\na total of eight to nine of the oblast\u2019s raions and will, initially at least, be the primary focus of the\nProject. Areas of low potential include the upper mountains, steppes, and semideserts where\nthe  low  rainfall  and  short  growing  season  are  formidable  constraints  to  financially  viable\nagriculture. Subject to the availability of project resources, these low-potential regions may be\ncovered by the Project beginning about two years after its commencement.\n                                                \n28The first phase of project preparation involved a detailed study of all of Kazakhstan\u2019s major agricultural regions and\na systematic ranking of oblasts based on these selection criteria.", "17\n2.  Project Activities\n50. The Project comprises three basic components: institutional development, credit, and\ntraining. The logical sequence of the project activities is as follows:\n(i) A rural advisory unit (RAU) will be established in Ust-Kamenogorsk, the capital of\nEast Kazakhstan oblast, to provide advice and formal training in the legal and\nfinancial aspects of farm restructuring and business management in a market\neconomy,  as  well  as  the  technical  and  marketing  skills  required  for  farm\ndiversification.\n(ii) The revitalization of input supplies and agroprocessing facilities is essential to\nencourage more productive, diversified farming systems. Hence, the RAU will\nalso provide training and advisory services to selected agribusinesses that have\nstrong  forward  and  backward  linkages  to  the  farms.  In  East  Kazakhstan,\ncandidate enterprises for such support may include machinery repair and custom\nhire services, medium-scale processing of sunflower and other oilseeds, and\nsmall-scale dairy processing.\n(iii) The process of farm restructuring has involved a significant reduction in the direct\nemployment provided by the larger farm enterprises. This loss of employment is\nexpected to continue during the restructuring of the farms that are the primary\ntarget group of the Project. To counteract this, the RAU, working in cooperation\nwith  local  NGOs,  will  complement  the  Government\u2019s  antipoverty  efforts  with\nsupport for skills training and the expansion of employment in rural nonfarm\nmicro  and  small  business  enterprises  that  build,  to  the  maximum  degree\npossible, upon existing skills and other resources in the oblast.\n(iv)  Farms, agribusinesses, and microenterprises that adopt viable business plans\nand  demonstrate  their  commitment  to  sound  management  practices  will  be\neligible to apply for credit at market rates under the Project for seasonal working\ncapital and longer term investment through the local commercial banks. Both\nbanks  and  borrowers  will  make  significant  contributions  to  the  investment\nfinancing. Potential subborrowers will be able to approach the banks directly for\nrelatively small working capital loans, but all applications for large investment\nloans must be accompanied by a detailed farm restructuring plan, and will need\nto be reviewed and cleared by the RAU. Thus, the RAU will serve as a linkage\nbetween the large rural enterprises and the PCBs.\n(v)  Since these banks need stronger abilities to appraise and manage rural loans,\nthe Project will provide consulting services and training to build capacity in the\nrural  financial  system.  As  has  been  initiated  under  the  Government\u2019s\nmicroenterprise program, support for the establishment of joint liability lending\nwill be explored to widen the Project\u2019s potential borrower base.\n(vi)  Finally, the Project will support (a) training and capacity building in local public\nagencies;  (b)  strengthening  of  applied  agricultural  research,  education,  and\noutreach  capacity  within  East  Kazakhstan;  and  (c)  development  of  project\nimplementation capacity within MOA, which will be responsible for recruitment of\nconsultants and procurement, project monitoring and evaluation, coordination\nwith other Government agencies, ensuring that ADB procedures are followed,\nand routine reporting to ADB.", "18\n3. Cost Estimates and Financing\n51. The Project\u2019s total estimated costs and financing plan are shown in tables 1 and 2. The\ntotal cost of the Project is estimated at $30.7 million, composed of $16.9 million in foreign\nexchange and $13.8 million in local currency. ADB will finance 65 percent of the investment\nproject  cost.  The  ADB  financing  amounts  to  $20.0  million  equivalent,  covering  all  foreign\nexchange costs and $3.1 million equivalent of the local currency costs.\nTable 1: Estimated Project Cost\n($'000)\nForeign Local Total % Foreign\nItem Exchange Currency Cost Exchange\nA.

Details on the project cost estimates and financing are in Appendix 5.\nF. Social and Environmental Measures\n1. Social Analysis\n53. Detailed  surveys  of  social  conditions  in  representative  rural  communities  of  East\nKazakhstan were conducted as part of the investment Project preparation. These surveys\nconfirmed that nationwide unemployment, low and declining incomes, and deteriorating social\nservices are also significant social problems in the area. Potentially vulnerable groups include\nhouseholds with no stable employment, those that never received or those that transferred\nfarmland and property shares, and pension-dependent families, particularly those headed by\nwomen.  A  marked  share  of  the  rural  population  in  the  working  age  group,  including  a\ndisproportionately  large  share  of  women,  has  lost  formal  employment  as  a  result  of  farm\nprivatization, restructuring, and the collapse of economic activity in rural Kazakhstan. The loss\nof direct farm employment is expected to continue as an inevitable part of the processes of farm\nrestructuring and the rationalization of production costs.\n54. The  investment  Project\u2019s  microenterprise  development  initiatives  will  mitigate  this\nproblem by providing training, advisory support, and financing aimed at adding value to readily\navailable, largely agricultural, raw materials that provide a source of cash income. The activities\nwill  focus  on  farm  communities  that,  with  project  support,  commence  a  process  of\ncomprehensive  restructuring  involving  a  significant  rationalization  of  costs.  Over  time,  and\ndepending on demand, the microenterprise development may expand to other areas of the\noblast and is expected to have particular benefits for women.\n55. The microenterprise development will complement the oblast\u2019s ongoing microenterprise\nprograms managed by NGO Microcredit and the Regional Fund for Support to the Low-Income\nPopulation.29 The Project will build upon the experience gained and clientele base established\nunder these programs, working to help poor families that have successfully established an initial\ncredit record to graduate to larger loans on commercial terms. The subloans for microenterprise\ndevelopment  will  likely  fall  within  the  range  of  $1,000\u2013$10,000  equivalent,  with  lending\narrangements similar to those described in paras. 80-81 for farm and agribusiness enterprises.\n2. Impact on Poverty\n56. The increase in rural poverty can only be arrested by a combination of profitable farms,\nwell-managed farm support services, and growth of off-farm employment. These are the main\nfocus of the Project. The SDP and the Project, in particular, provide specific interventions to\nmitigate the undesirable social impacts of farm restructuring. The Project\u2019s microenterprise\ndevelopment is directly targeted at rural communities and social groups most likely to lose direct\nfarm employment as the result of farm restructuring. The project activities are intended to be\nboth sustainable and replicable. In addition, the SDP's policy support measures will reinforce\nthe  project  interventions  by  providing  information  to  rural  communities  about  their  rights,\nobligations, and opportunities, as well as by strengthening the legal and institutional framework\n                                                \n29These programs operate under the umbrella of the National Fund for Support of Low-Income Citizens (para. 8) and\noffer credits of up to $400 equivalent, largely to underemployed rural households, for the establishment or\nexpansion of microenterprises. State funding of the programs was suspended in late 1998 due to budgetary\nconstraints. Unemployed women, particularly those in households with a large number of children, were a specific\ntarget group of these programs, and will receive attention under the Project.", "20\nfor land and farm ownership, rural small business development, and the formation of voluntary\nrural associations.\n3. Environment\n57. The  Project  was  classified  by  ADB  as  environmental  category  B,  meaning  that\npotentially  adverse  environmental  impacts  must  be  assessed,  and  if  required,  appropriate\nmitigation  measures  incorporated.  Accordingly,  an  initial  environmental  examination,\nsummarized in Appendix 6, was conducted during project preparation. It concluded that the\nProject  would  cause  no  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts.  Indeed,  the  net\nenvironmental  impacts  are  expected  to  be  positive,  principally  through  (i)  the  removal  of\nmarginal land from agricultural use; (ii) a reduction in the cultivated area, especially sloping\nland; (iii) the use of more diversified cropping patterns to promote soil fertility and biodiversity,\nand prevent the buildup of plant diseases; and (iv) reduced use of inefficient energy-consuming\ntechnologies. Only modest incremental fertilizer and agrochemical use by farms is expected as\na result of the Project. East Kazakhstan\u2019s pump irrigation systems were capable of functioning\nonly under conditions of heavily subsidized energy costs. In the present economic environment,\nthese systems will certainly continue to decline in area even as farm profitability recovers. The\nProject will focus predominantly on rain-fed agriculture and will have no significant implications\nfor on-farm water use.30 Finally, the agribusiness and microenterprise investments envisioned\nunder the Project\u2014for example, machinery services, oilseed and dairy processing, and small\nhousehold crafts and services\u2014will entail negligible increases in effluents and wastes. Hence, a\nfull environmental impact assessment was not required for the Project. Nonetheless, the RAU\nand participating staff of the oblast Department of Agriculture (DOA) will coordinate with the\noblast  Department  of  Environment  and  Natural  Resources  to  (i)  monitor  subborrower\ncompliance with the applicable environmental assessment and mitigation requirements of the\nGovernment  and  ADB,  and  (ii)  monitor  relevant  environmental  parameters  such  as\nagrochemical  use  and  soil  and  water  effluents.  Submission  of  an  initial  environmental\nexamination in accordance with ADB guidelines will be a condition for ADB clearance of all\nagroprocessing subloans in excess of $100,000 in value. Agroprocessing investments financed\nby subloans below $100,000 must be in compliance with applicable Government and ADB\nenvironmental guidelines, and certification of such compliance will be maintained as part of PCB\nloan records.\nV.  THE LOANS\nA. The Policy Loan\n1. Amount of Loan, Terms, and Source of Funds\n58. Implementation of the SDP's policy reforms (para. 43) will include substantial costs for (i)\na nationwide public information and education campaign on agriculture; (ii) the expansion of the\nsystem  for  registering  rights  to  immovable  property;  (iii)  a  market  information  system;  (iv)\nimplementation and monitoring of new accounting and auditing requirements, (v) a national\nsurvey  of  farm  financial  performance,  cropping  patterns,  and  profitability;  and  (vi)  various\nstudies and evaluations required to the legal framework. To support the implementation of the\n                                                \n30At present, the main potential for irrigation development exists in low-lying regions of the oblast, where soil and\nwater table characteristics make groundwater irrigation feasible. This development will not be financially justified\nwith the present mix of largely low-value cereal crops, but the viability of the investment may improve as farm\nrestructuring and diversification occur. Should farmers show interest, the RAU  will assist them in evaluating\nfinancially and environmentally sound technologies and promote WUAs.", "21\nSDP's  policy  component,  a  loan  of  $25  million  is  proposed  from  ADB's  ordinary  capital\nresources, with a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years, interest calculated in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s pool-based variable lending rate system for US dollar loans,  and a\ncommitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum on the undisbursed portion of the loan. The\nGovernment will pay to ADB a front-end fee equal to 1 percent of the loan amount. The fee will\nbe capitalized in the loan.\n2. Implementation Arrangements and Executing Agency\n59. The policy component will be implemented over two years from 30 November 2000 to 30\nNovember 2002. MOF will be the Executing Agency for the policy loan and will take overall\nresponsibility for the policy component implementation, which will be jointly monitored by a\nsteering committee to be established immediately after the policy loan becomes effective. The\ncommittee will be composed of senior personnel of MOA, AgSP, MOJ, and the Ministry of\nEconomy.\n3. Procurement and Disbursement\n60. The proceeds of the policy loan will be disbursed against a broad range of imports with\nthe exclusion of items contained in a short negative list and imports financed by other bilateral\nand multilateral sources. Disbursement will be in accordance with the simplified disbursement\nprocedures and related requirements for program loans. The Government will be required to\nsubmit with each withdrawal application a certificate that the volume of eligible imports exceeds\nthe amount of ADB's projected disbursements under the loan in a given period. ADB will have\nthe right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the Government's\ncertification.\n4. Counterpart Funds\n61. The counterpart funds to be generated from the proceeds of the loan will be used by the\nGovernment to finance (i) the costs of implementing the SDP\u2019s policy reforms; and (ii) the local\ncounterpart  costs  of  high-priority  development  projects  and  TA  in  the  agriculture  sector,\nparticularly those financed by ADB.\n5. Monitoring and Tranching\n62. MOF will be responsible for monitoring the implementation of all measures contained in\nthe policy matrix, and for semiannual reporting of progress to ADB. The proceeds of the loan will\nbe utilized over 24 months and released in two equal tranches of $12.5 million. The first tranche\nwill be released upon loan effectiveness. Release of the second tranche is expected to occur in\nNovember 2001 upon satisfactory completion of the following Government actions:\n(i)  prepare a phased plan, in a manner satisfactory to ADB, and submit a proposal\nto Parliament in the draft law on the Republican budget for 2002 to finance a\nsystem of computerized market information centers that routinely disseminate\nprice and other market information to farms;\n(ii)  accept the application of either the international accounting standards of the\nInternational  Accounting  Standards  Committee  or  equivalent  standards\nsatisfactory  to  ADB;  and  adopt  a  timetable  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the\nimplementation of the accounting standards;", "22\n(iii)  prepare and commence implementation, in a manner satisfactory to ADB, of a\nphased plan to apply internationally accepted auditing and accounting standards,\nor  equivalent  standards  satisfactory  to  ADB,  to  farms  and  agribusiness\nenterprises that are legal entities;\n(iv)  propose to Parliament in the draft law on the Republican budget for 2002 the\nprovision of a budget, in an amount to be agreed upon by ADB, to finance the\nnationwide public information and education program on agriculture, which will\ndisseminate  knowledge  through  publications,  mass  media  (newspapers,\ntelevision, and radio), and training courses and seminars;\n(v)  evaluate the impact of oblast and raion-level administration interference in the\ndecisions of private farmers on land use, cropping patterns, and input-output\nmarketing, including the adequacy of grievance procedures; and based on the\nresults of this review, submit to the President\u2019s Administration, for approval,\nmeasures necessary to reduce administrative interference in the activities of\nprivate farms and agribusinesses; and\n(vi)  submit to Parliament a draft law on WUAs, or adopt a regulation on WUAs,\nspecifying  procedures  for  the  transfer  of  irrigation  and  drainage  systems  to\nWUAs, and removing any legal obstacles to WUA formation.\nB. The Investment Loan\n1. Amount of Loan, Terms, and Source of Funds\n63. A loan of $20 million from ADB's ordinary capital resources is proposed, with a term of\n25 years, including a grace period of 5 years, and with interest calculated in accordance with\nADB\u2019s pool-based variable lending rate system for US dollar loans, and an annual commitment\ncharge of 0.75 percent. The Government will pay to ADB a front-end fee equal to 1 percent of\nthe loan amount. The fee will be capitalized in the loan.\n2. Implementation Arrangements and Executing Agency\na. Organization and Financing of the RAU\n64. The RAU will be staffed initially by domestic and international specialists, together with a\nsmall  number  of  oblast  administration  personnel,  with  suitable  experience  in  farm  and\nagribusiness management, microenterprise development, agricultural training, accounting, law,\nmarketing, and other required specialties on an as-needed basis. The RAU will be headed by a\nlong-term,  locally  recruited  director  with  suitable  experience  in  farm  and  agribusiness\nmanagement, and detailed knowledge of the legal and financial aspects of farm privatization\nand  restructuring.  It  will  have  an  advisory  board,  comprising  representatives  of  the  oblast\nadministration, DOA, participating banks, NGOs, and farmers, and will be supervised by MOA.\nThe advisory board will set general policies and strategies for the RAU, and review the progress\nand impacts of the onlending and other project activities, but the RAU\u2019s director and staff must\nretain autonomy in their day-to-day operations, including all decisions to endorse onlending. It\nwill be critical\u2014as MOA and the oblast administration have agreed\u2014for the RAU to be an\nobjective organization that fairly and transparently applies strict eligibility and financial criteria in\nidentifying, appraising, and endorsing subloans.\n65. During its first two years of operation, the RAU will be fully financed by the Project\nthrough the contributions of the ADB loan (80 percent) and the Republican budget (20 percent).\nAt the end of the second year, the Government and ADB will undertake a comprehensive", "23\nmidterm review (para. 89), during which the performance of the RAU and the participating farms\nwill be evaluated, and a phased plan for RAU cost recovery through user fees will be prepared\nand initiated. Thereafter, the RAU will continue as a permanent, independent organization\nfunded increasingly through user fees for the services provided, with a corresponding decrease\nin funding by the Project. Besides the borrowing farms and enterprises, possible financial\ncontributors include the commercial banks, agricultural input supply and agroprocessing firms,\nand other organizations with a stake in a profitable agriculture sector.\nb. Structure and Characteristics of Participating Farms\n66. As of late 1999, East Kazakhstan oblast had a total of 7,085 farms: 6,869 peasant farms\nwith a median size of about 300 ha, and the remainder much larger corporate entities averaging\nabout 21,000 ha. The process\u2014rather than the discrete event\u2014of the restructuring of the\nformer state farms constitutes a dynamic element of social change in the project area. The total\nnumber of peasant farms has grown by about 20 percent since mid-1998 as the result of the\nliquidation  and  reform  of  bankrupt  corporate  entities,  and  the  entrepreneurial  desire  to\nundertake private farming. This desire has been fueled by a variety of forces, including the\ndeclining work hours and wages on the corporate farms; the market reforms that have freed\ncrop and input prices, and limited nonfarm job opportunities; and a reassertion of the basic\nindependence and initiative of individual rural households.\n67. Nonetheless, although the large corporate units comprise just 3 percent of the farms,\nthey collectively account for more than 50 percent of the oblast\u2019s agricultural area.31 The April\n1999 survey of the oblast\u2019s corporate farms conducted by MOA and DOA concluded that 36\npercent  were  performing  profitably  (group  I),  33  percent  were  in  need  of  fundamental\nrehabilitation and restructuring (group II), and 31 percent would likely face liquidation (group III).\nIn contrast, as of mid-1998, only 4 percent of the peasant farms were judged to be bankrupt,\nwhile 70 percent were performing profitably. These results are indicative of the efforts already\nbeing made by MOA and DOA to categorize and target specific types of farms, and also show\nthat it is the large corporate farms that are most frequently in need of restructuring support.\nGroup II farms constitute the primary target group for the RAU\u2019s farm restructuring advisory\nsupport. In general, group III farms, whether corporate or peasant, will not be eligible for project\nsupport  until  the  outcome  of  liquidation/bankruptcy  proceedings  is  clear.  Group  I  farms,\nparticularly the smaller peasant units, should find it relatively easy to access credit without\nadditional restructuring, but much will depend on the precise circumstances of each farm. Some\ngroup I farms, although structurally stable and deemed profitable, may not be able to meet\ncommercial bank lending criteria for major investments unless there are fundamental changes in\nmanagement practices. Such farms will also be assisted by the RAU if they wish to access\nsignificant investment credit under the Project.\n68. The  Project  will  seek  to  assist  a  core  group  of  farms  that  are  (i)  committed  to\nrehabilitation  and  restructuring;  (ii)  have  a  sound  farm  development  plan;  (iii)  have\ndemonstrated ability to produce a strong cash flow, repay loans, and resolve any outstanding\ndebt ; and (iv) have the ability to meet other commercial bank criteria, such as collateral (with or\nwithout any risk cover). However, the RAU will have limited human (advisory) and financial\n                                                \n31\nThe size distribution of peasant farms is skewed by the 1 percent of this class that are essentially production\ncooperatives averaging 2,400 ha. The large peasant units were formed to avoid the more complicated registration\nand tax procedures for corporate farms that must register as legal entities. If the large peasant farms are added to\nthe corporate farms, then East Kazakhstan\u2019s largest farms comprise 4 percent of total farms, but occupy almost 70\npercent of the farm area.", "24\nresources  relative  to  the  oblast\u2019s  overall  need.  To  make  the  most  effective  use  of  those\nresources, only 50-60 corporate farms will be targeted for detailed restructuring over five years.\nWith  careful  selection,  this  number  of  farms,  although  small,  will  represent  a  significant\nproportion of the oblast\u2019s agricultural resources, covering more than 400,000 ha of agricultural\nland, of which about 200,000 ha are arable and 10,000-20,000 ha are irrigated.\n69. The farms, agribusiness enterprises, and commercial banks must meet a detailed set of\neligibility criteria if they are to receive advisory support and significant credit access under the\nProject. These eligibility criteria are discussed in Appendix 7.\nc. Roles and Responsibilities of the Oblast Administration\n70. In 1998 the East Kazakhstan DOA was actively involved in the national Republican\nWorking  Committee's  survey  of  farm  financial  performance,  and  in  the  screening  and\nsubsequent endorsement to local commercial banks of farm applications for the Government\u2019s\n1998/99 subsidy program for interest charges on agricultural loans.32 Although the Project's\nlending arrangements and terms will differ, this activity is essentially similar to the function that\nwill be performed by the RAU. In addition, given East Kazakhstan\u2019s enormous size and the\nRAU\u2019s staff constraints, it is inevitable that the RAU will depend heavily on the oblast and raion-\nlevel DOAs to facilitate communications and project activities. For the past two years, the staff\nof  the  oblast  governor  have  been  involved  in  implementing  the  Government\u2019s  small-  and\nmedium-size  enterprise  development  programs,  an  activity  that  also  closely  parallels  the\nProject\u2019s support for community microenterprise development. These considerations make it\nlogical to establish a formal role for the administration\u2019s personnel in RAU operations. As part of\nits contribution to the Project, DOA will assign at least one suitably qualified staff member with\nexperience in farm management, finance, and lending to work with the RAU on a full-time basis.\nIn addition, at least one suitably qualified staff from the oblast administration will be assigned,\non at least a part-time basis, to support the Project\u2019s microenterprise development.\n71. The  direct  involvement  of  oblast  personnel  will  allow  the  project  activities  to  be\ncoordinated  closely  with  the  Government\u2019s  related  programs,  and  will  ensure  that  these\npersonnel benefit from the project training and institutional development activities. However,\ndespite this involvement, it is understood that the RAU must retain autonomy for selecting\npotential  subborrowers,  providing  advice  on  restructuring  and  other  matters,  and  providing\nonlending recommendations to the PCBs. This independence will be critical if the RAU is to gain\ntrust as an objective, credible partner of the farms and participating banks.\n72. DOA will coordinate the Project at the oblast level and will take responsibility for reporting\nprogress to MOA and MOF\u2019s Department for External Loans at intervals and in a format to be\nagreed  upon  by  the  Government  and  ADB.  The  Project  will  be  supervised  by  an  oblast\ncoordination  committee,  to  be  established  within  one  month  following  effectiveness  of  the\ninvestment loan. The committee will comprise the oblast governor as chairperson, the directors\nof DOA and the RAU, oblast and raion-level representatives of the PCBs, the participating farms\nand NGOs, and key private sector representatives involved in input and output marketing.\n                                                \n32Under this program, the Government contributed interest-free matching funds to those of the commercial banks for\nsmall- and medium-size farm loans that were used largely for working capital. The bulk of such loans extended by\nthe East Kazakhstan Kazagroprom branch in 1998 was in the range of $5,000-$20,000 equivalent. Due to\nbudgetary constraints, this program was suspended in the second half of 1998, and, in accord with the conditions\nof the SDP\u2019s policy component, it will not be reintroduced.", "25\nd. Roles and Responsibilities of Other Oblast Organizations\ni. Raion Agriculture Departments\n73. One officer in each of the selected raion offices of DOA (para. 49) will be nominated as\nfarm restructuring coordinator, and will be assigned the responsibilities of (i) disseminating\ninformation about the Project and RAU support services; (ii) assisting rural enterprise managers\nin  communicating  with  the  RAU;  preparing  the  information  that  will  be  required  for  RAU\nscreening of the farm\u2019s legal, financial, and operational status; and assessing the need for, and\nappropriateness  of,  detailed  RAU  assistance;  (iii)  helping  prepare  subloan  application\ndocuments; and (iv) monitoring the use of subloan funds, the enterprise\u2019s operational and\nfinancial performance, and subloan repayment.\n74. During  the  first  three  months  of  project  implementation,  the  farm  restructuring\ncoordinators will be provided with initial training about the Project, including enterprise selection\ncriteria and financial assessment methods. Later in the Project, the coordinators, together with\nselected oblast staff, will receive more detailed training in areas related to agriculture in a\nmarket economy, including farm economics, finance, and management; agronomy, livestock,\nhorticulture, and rangeland management; and marketing and cooperative development.\nii. Participating Banks\n75. During SDP preparation, Kazakhstan\u2019s main commercial banks were approached, and\ntheir interest and capacity for participating in the Project determined. Their participation will be\nsubject to ADB approval and to their meeting the eligibility criteria outlined in Appendix 7,\nincluding: (i) full compliance with NBK prudential requirements; (ii) sound governance, financial\nmanagement, and loan tracking systems; (iii) annual audited financial statements, prepared in\naccordance  with  international  accounting  standards;  (iv)  an  adequate  branch  network  and\nhuman resources to serve the rural areas in East Kazakhstan; and (v) commitment to contribute\nat least 15 percent of the capital to subloans over the project period and to participate in\ncapacity-building activities. Following approval of the SDP, the PCBs will be evaluated and\nselected by MOF in close consultation with ADB.\n76. Kazagroprom  has  confirmed  its  interest  in  participating  in  both  the  farm  onlending\nactivities and the project\u2019s training and capacity-building programs, and is expected to formally\napply for consideration as a PCB following approval of the SDP.33 Two additional banks\u2014\nKazkommerts  and  TuranAlem\u2014have  also  expressed  strong  interest  in  participating  in  the\nProject. Other banks are expected to formally express interest once the Project is under way\nand  the  RAU  is  established.  Such  participation  will  be  actively  sought  to  improve  the\ncompetitiveness of onlending. The mix of banks meeting the Project\u2019s selection criteria will have\nan  impact  on  the  types  of  subloans.  Consistent  with  its  corporate  identity  and  strategy,\nKazagroprom would likely concentrate on subloans to farms and microenterprises, whereas\nKazkommerts and TuranAlem would focus more on loans to agroprocessing enterprises, with\nwhich they have greater experience.\n                                                \n33The East Kazakhstan branch of Kazagroprom is presently managing a modest agricultural loan portfolio that will\naccommodate the relatively small microenterprise loans to be provided under the Project. In addition, this bank has\nexpressed interest in exploring the formation of borrower groups for joint liability lending during the Project\u2019s\nimplementation as a means of reducing both the risks and transaction costs of lending to small borrowers.", "26\niii. Nongovernment Organizations\n77. A  significant  part  of  the  training  and  community  preparation  for  the  Project\u2019s\nmicroenterprise activities will be subcontracted to a suitably qualified NGO or NGOs. NGO\nparticipation will ensure that appropriate services are provided to the Project on a cost-effective\nbasis. Fieldwork and consultations under the 1997 project preparatory TA (footnote 1) and\nduring loan processing in 1998/99 demonstrated that several NGOs are already successfully\nworking  in  rural  small-scale  employment  activities  in  East  Kazakhstan.  The  NGOs  visited\nexpressed keen interest in participating in the Project's outreach and capacity-building activities.\nSince that time, the number of active NGOs has grown rapidly.34 In light of this growth, the\nexperience and capacities of the NGO community will be recanvassed early during project\nimplementation. Participating NGOs will then undergo formal evaluation and recruitment through\ncompetitive tender by MOA in consultation with DOA and ADB.\niv. East Kazakhstan Scientific Research Institute for Agriculture\n78. Symptomatic of the agriculture sector\u2019s incomplete adjustment to the postprivatization\neconomic environment, most of Kazakhstan\u2019s farms still rely on a narrow range of crop and\nlivestock activities essentially unchanged since the FSU period. Overall, there has been little\nmarket-led  diversification  of  agriculture.  Crops  with  strong  market  potential  that  can  be\nsuccessfully integrated into Kazakhstan\u2019s farming systems must be identified. To accomplish\nthis, the East Kazakhstan Scientific Research Institute for Agriculture, in close coordination with\nthe RAU, will participate in the Project by undertaking a program of field trials and economic\nevaluation of potentially profitable, environmentally sustainable new crops.35 To strengthen its\ncapacity for economic analysis and its linkages to the international agricultural research system,\nthe institute will be supported under the Project\u2019s associated TA (para. 94).\nv. Training Institutions\n79. To  ensure  sustainability  and  replicability,  the  training  strategy  will  focus  initially  on\nstrengthening the skills of staff at East Kazakhstan Agricultural College, the oblast\u2019s leading\ninstitution,  in  critically  deficient  areas  such  as  agricultural  economics,  farm  management,\nmarketing,  and  cooperative  development,  as  well  as  upgrading  disciplines  such  as  crop,\nlivestock, and rangeland management in a market economy.36 Following this, the college is\nexpected to take on the major responsibility for implementing the RAU\u2019s training programs for\nfarmers and public agency personnel.\ne. Flow of Funds and Onlending Arrangements\n80. MOF will onlend the loan proceeds, together with the Government\u2019s financing share of\nthe credit line, to the PCBs under subsidiary loan agreements (SLAs) with market-based terms\nand conditions satisfactory to ADB. Execution of an SLA between MOF and each PCB, on\n                                                \n34\nThe NGO Confederation of Kazakhstan reported in June 2000 that the country now has a total of about 1,000\nofficially registered NGOs (including some 110 in East Kazakhstan), and estimated that 2,000 NGOs have not yet\nofficially registered. In 1997, fewer than 250 NGOs were estimated to exist nationwide.\n35\nThe research program will focus initially on nitrogen-fixing crops with good market prospects such as soybeans and\nother legumes. Other crops that have regional or international export potential, short-season annual forage crops\nthat would utilize residual soil moisture, and medicinal plants will be studied as the program evolves.\n36\nThere is scope for collaboration in training and curriculum development between East Kazakhstan Agricultural\nCollege and strong national institutions such as the Kazakhstan Institute for Management, Economics, and\nPlanning, and the Institute of Agribusiness Economics, both located in Almaty.", "27\nterms and conditions satisfactory to the ADB, will be required prior to disbursement of funds to\nthe relevant PCB. Conditions for the proportional allocation of subloans between working capital\nand investment and for the rollover of project funds will be specified as part of each SLA. The\nPCBs will onlend the funds to eligible subborrowers under suitable subloan agreements. The\nterms and conditions for relending to the PCBs will be similar to those of the Loan Agreement\nbetween ADB and the Government, but with a maximum 15-year term and 3-year grace period,\nand reflecting the cost of ADB funds, plus an assessed level of administrative costs and risk\nallowance. The onlending interest rates to be charged by the PCBs will be market-based. Loans\nto subborrowers will be made either in US dollars or tenge, depending on the purpose of the\nloan.  The  risks  of  foreign  exchange  and  interest  rate  fluctuations  will  be  borne  by  the\nsubborrowers or the PCBs concerned in accordance with arrangements satisfactory to ADB.\n81.  Due to (i) the RAU\u2019s resource constraints, (ii) the expected high demand by farms for\nrelatively  small  loans  for  seasonal  working  capital,  and  (iii)  the  generally  satisfactory\nperformance of the agriculture sector loan portfolio of East Kazakhstan\u2019s potential PCBs, it is\nneither necessary nor desirable for the RAU to closely scrutinize and endorse all subloan\napplications. Therefore, it is envisioned that applicants for loans of up to $50,000 equivalent and\n12 months\u2019 duration will be able to approach the PCBs directly without review and endorsement\nby the RAU. For loans greater than $50,000 equivalent, and for all investment loans with a\nrepayment period exceeding 12 months, the subborrower will need to (i) prepare, in consultation\nwith the RAU, an appropriate medium-term enterprise restructuring and development plan; and\n(ii) obtain endorsement of the loan application from the RAU. In addition to RAU endorsement,\nall subloans in excess of $350,000 will be reviewed by ADB prior to approval by the PCBs. In\naddition, ADB clearance will be required for the first five subloans under the Project, regardless\nof their size.\nf. Project Supervision\n82. MOA will be the Executing Agency for the Project. In Astana, MOA will establish an\nadequately staffed project office, headed by a suitably qualified director selected with ADB\nagreement. In Ust-Kamenogorsk, MOA will establish a coordinating office for the Project, headed\nby  an  office  manager.  MOA  will  (i)  ensure  that  the  Project  is  implemented  in  a  manner\nconsistent with its objectives and complies with all applicable ADB guidelines and procedures;\n(ii)  coordinate  intergovernment  activities  associated  with  the  Project  in  liaison  with  MOF's\nDepartment for External Loans; (iii) monitor and evaluate PCB lending operations, the RAU\u2019s\nactivities, and consultant performance; (iv) monitor compliance with environmental assessment\nand impact mitigation measures; (v) maintain appropriate expenditure accounts and supporting\ndocumentation  for  project-related  activities;  and  (vi)  prepare,  with  inputs  from  the  PCBs,\nDepartment for External Loans, and the RAU, quarterly progress reports and other project\nreports, in formats agreed to by ADB.\n83. Project supervision at the national level will be provided by an interministerial coordination\ncommittee to be established within three months of loan effectiveness and comprising the minister\nof agriculture (chair); the project and RAU directors; and appropriate senior personnel from MOF,\nthe Ministry of Economy, AgSP, the PCBs, and the East Kazakhstan oblast administration. The\nProject monitoring and reporting responsibilities of MOA and MOF are described in paras. 85-87.\nProject coordination at the oblast level is described in para. 72.", "28\ng. Disbursement, Accounts, Audits, and Reports\n84. An imprest account will be established immediately after loan effectiveness, at a bank to\nbe agreed upon by the Government and ADB. Initially $200,000 will be deposited; this is based on\nan estimate of expenditures to be incurred during the first six months of project implementation. At\nthe option of the PCB concerned, the Government may establish a separate imprest account\n(PCB imprest account) for disbursements to each PCB for financing subprojects under the credit\ncomponent of the investment Project. The initial amount to be deposited into the PCB imprest\naccount  will  not  exceed  $350,000.  The  imprest  accounts  will  be  established,  managed,\nreplenished, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook and other\nprocedures  agreed  upon  between  the  Government,  ADB,  and  the  PCBs  concerned.  ADB\u2019s\nstatement of expenditure procedures may be used for reimbursement of eligible expenditures and\nliquidation of advances to the imprest accounts. Any individual payment to be reimbursed or\nliquidated  under  the  statement  of  expenditure  procedures  will  not  exceed  the  equivalent  of\n$50,000.\n85. MOA will maintain separate accounts and financial statements for the Project, covering\nseparately the activities of the RAU and the project office, which will be audited annually by\nindependent auditors acceptable to ADB. Certified copies of the audited financial statements will\nbe submitted to ADB by MOA through MOF within nine months after the end of the fiscal year to\nwhich  they  relate.  MOF  will  submit  to  ADB  consolidated  statements  on  the  Project\u2019s  credit\ncomponent and the activities of the PCBs within a similar time period. In addition, the PCBs will\nsubmit audited annual financial statements to ADB, through MOF. The auditor's report will also\ninclude the auditor's opinion on use of the imprest accounts and the statement of expenditure\nprocedure. Both the financial statements and auditor's report will be in the English language. The\nGovernment and MOA were informed of a new ADB policy on submission of audited accounts,\nwhich covers failure to submit audited accounts and financial statements within the due time. A\nformal warning will be issued for accounts more than six months overdue and disbursements will\nbe suspended for accounts that are 12 months overdue.\n86. MOA will provide ADB with quarterly progress reports on project implementation, to be\nsubmitted within one month after the end of the quarter to which they relate, and such other\nreports and information relating to the Project as ADB may reasonably request. In addition, within\nthree months after physical completion of the Project, MOA will submit to ADB, through MOF, a\nproject  completion  report  including  information  on  project  implementation,  use  of  the  loan\nproceeds, and the extent to which the project objectives have been achieved.\n87. The Appraisal Mission judged MOA's capacity to manage the Project to be acceptable.37\nMOA has gained implementation experience during the past three years with projects financed\nby ADB and the World Bank. To ensure compliance with ADB procedures and policies, the\nProject provides for short-term consultants and training on an as-needed basis in areas such as\naccounting, project management, and environmental assessment.\nh. Implementation Schedule\n88. The Project will be implemented over five years, 2000-2005, with completion expected\non or about 30 November 2005. The initial year will be devoted primarily to (i) setting up the\n                                                \n37An assessment of MOA\u2019s capabilities will be undertaken during the loan inception mission in line with ADB's\ninternal  guidelines  for  assessment  of  borrower/executing  agency  internal  control,  accounting  system,  and\ncapabilities for the use of imprest account and statement of expenditures procedures.", "29\nRAU,  including  recruitment  of  staff  and  consultants;  (ii)  establishing  consultative  linkages\nbetween the RAU and PCBs; (iii) finalizing subcontracts with NGOs based on an analysis of\nneeds in key communities; and (iv) arranging for foreign and domestic training programs. Initial\nadvisory services will be provided to a core group of farms identified during loan preparation.\nThe initial extension of credit is expected to occur in time for the 2002 planting season. From\nyear 2 the RAU will be in full operation. An average of 10-15 large farms each year will receive\ndetailed restructuring analyses and advice, while a larger group of smaller farms will receive\ntraining and guidance on agrarian law, taxation, marketing, and farm business management.\nAppendix 8 shows the envisioned implementation plan in detail.\ni. Midterm Review\n89. In  addition  to  regular  review  missions,  the  Government  and  ADB  will  undertake  a\ncomprehensive midterm review at the end of the second year of project implementation to\nscrutinize progress and achievements, identify any problems and constraints, and recommend\nmidcourse  corrections  that  may  be  warranted  to  achieve  all  objectives.  In  assessing\nperformance, the midterm review will give particular attention to (i) the realization of monitorable\nindicators;38  (ii)  impacts  of  the  policy  and  legal  reforms,  and  (iii)  the  effectiveness  of  the\nassociated TA (para. 94). The review of the Project will focus on (i) the operations of the RAU\n(relevance and quality of its services; numbers of farms served and the demand for RAU\nservices; views of farm managers, rural communities, and oblast agencies on the work of the\nconsultants;  and  prospects  for  cost  recovery);  (ii)  progress  in  farm,  agribusiness,  and\nmicroenterprise  lending,  including  appraisal  procedures,  loan  utilization,  monitoring,  and\nrepayment; and (iii) the anticipated economic and social impacts of the Project.\nj. Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n90. A  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  (BME)  system  to  monitor  progress  in  farm\nrestructuring, farm and agribusiness performance, and rural microenterprise activities will, within\nsix months of loan effectiveness, be established within the RAU with the assistance of the\nproject consultants. BME will include (i) the farms, agribusinesses, and microenterprises served\nby the RAU; (ii) crop and livestock productivity; (iii) farm and nonfarm employment of men and\nwomen; (iv) farm financial performance and profitability; (v) loan utilization and repayment; (vi)\nproject environmental impacts; (vii) average incomes and the incidence of poverty at the farm\nand  community  level;  and  (viii)  the  gender-specific  impacts  of  farm  restructuring  and  the\ninterventions supported by the Project. The BME system will be integrated with the MOA and\nDOA databases used in the 1998 survey of farm financial performance and databases to be\nestablished as part of the market information system under the SDP.\n3. Procurement and Consulting Services\n91. Two types of procurement will occur under the Project: (i) procurement by subborrowers,\nand (ii) procurement by Government agencies. Goods and services procured by subborrowers\n                                                \n38Verifiable indicators of SDP performance will include (i) establishment and operation of oblast-level information\nservices, real estate registration offices, and programs for crop agronomic improvement; (ii) comprehensiveness\nand quality of studies and evaluations of property registration, bankruptcy, extralegal interventions by local\nadministrations, small business development, and foreign investment, together with the legislation adopted and\nother actions taken on the basis of these studies/evaluations; (iii) coverage, quality, and impact of the nationwide\npublic information and education campaign for agriculture; (iv) progress in farm restructuring, farm profitability, and\ncommercial lending to agriculture, both nationwide and in East Kazakhstan; and (iv) budgetary expenditures for\nirrigation operation and maintenance, credit, and agricultural inputs in the agriculture sector.", "30\nwill  include  agricultural  inputs  (seed,  fuel,  agrochemicals),  farm  machinery,  spare  parts,\nequipment for microenterprises, and small- and medium-size agroprocessing equipment. Such\ngoods and services will typically be procured directly in local markets by the subborrowers. The\nPCBs will be required to (i) demonstrate that the procurement procedures are appropriate in the\ncircumstances;  (ii) ensure that goods and services financed by such subloans are purchased at\na reasonable price, taking account of factors such as time of delivery, suitability and reliability of\nthe goods, availability of maintenance facilities and spare parts, and in the case of services,\ntheir quality and the competence of the parties rendering them; and (iii) ensure and certify that\nall  goods  procured  have  satisfied  ADB\u2019s  country-of-origin  and  eligibility  requirements.\nDepending upon demand, bulk procurement of inputs and machinery may prove to be an\nefficient  option  and  could  be  facilitated  and  coordinated  by  the  RAU  at  the  option  of  the\nsubborrowers, in which case procurement will be competitive and in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement.\n92. Procurement by Government agencies will be limited largely to equipment and materials\nrequired for the project offices, training, and vehicles required for project implementation and\nmonitoring.  All  procurement  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for\nProcurement. Procurement of vehicles with an estimated total value in excess of $100,000 will be\nundertaken  using  international  shopping  procedures.  Other  procurement  contracts  by\nGovernment agencies are expected to cost well below $100,000, primarily for equipment and\nmaterials. Since such contracts are unlikely to be of interest to international suppliers and will be\nfor goods that are available locally at competitive prices, local competitive bidding procedures\nacceptable to ADB or direct purchase will be used. MOA will be responsible for supervising all\nprocurement.\n93. The Project will require 76 person-months of international consulting and 360 person-\nmonths of domestic consulting services for the RAU, and training and capacity building in the\nrural communities, participating banks, educational institutions, and government agencies. MOA\nwill recruit these consultants, including specialists engaged through NGOs, in collaboration with\nthe East Kazakhstan DOA and in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants\nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. To\nensure that the best qualified people are selected, MOA has agreed that recruitment of RAU\nprofessional  staff  will  involve  a  well-publicized  nationwide  search  to  be  undertaken  in\nconsultation with ADB. Appendix 4 summarizes the terms of reference for the international\nconsultants and for the director of the RAU.\nVI.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\n94. The Government asked ADB to finance advisory TA, Deepening of Agricultural Reforms\nand Development Programs. The TA will serve two distinct purposes in furthering the SDP\u2019s\nobjectives. It will (i) facilitate SDP implementation by providing assistance to MOA and other\nconcerned agencies (AgSP, MOF, and MOJ) with the evaluation and refinement of agricultural\npolicies and legislation, and the design and preparation of the market information system and\nthe public information and education campaign on agriculture; and (ii) complement the Project\nby developing a program of applied agricultural research and technology dissemination focusing\non East Kazakhstan, and strengthening linkages between East Kazakhstan Scientific Research\nInstitute  for  Agriculture,  other  domestic  agricultural  research  institutions,  and  international\ninstitutes such as the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center and the International", "31\nCenter for Agricultural Research on Dry Areas.39 MOA will be the Executing Agency for the TA,\nwhich will be supervised by a steering committee comprising representatives from MOJ, MOF,\nMinistry of Science and Higher Education, and AgSP. The TA will require 20 person-months of\ninternational consulting and 28 person-months of domestic consulting, provided over 24 months\nestimated to begin in April 2001. All consultants will be recruited by ADB in accordance with\nADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the\nengagement of domestic consultants. The TA is estimated to cost $1,140,000 equivalent, of\nwhich $800,000 will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded\nby the Government of Japan, and $340,000 equivalent will be provided by the Government for\nin-kind support and the costs of data compilation, land and materials for the field crop trials,\ncounterpart  travel  and  per  diem,  use  of  state  television  and  radio  facilities  for  the  public\ninformation campaign, and contingencies. The Government has given assurance that adequate\nbudgetary provision for these financial costs will be made so that the TA can be implemented\nexpeditiously. Appendix 9 provides the detailed rationale, terms of reference, and costs of the\nTA.\nVII.  BENEFITS AND RISKS\nA. Expected Impacts\n1. Financial and Economic Analyses\n95. Emerging private farms have been caught in a low input-low output equilibrium. Most\nfarms have abandoned the use of fertilizers and agrochemicals, and are unable to undertake\ntimely farm operations, with the result that reported yields have declined to 60-70 percent of pre-\nIndependence levels.40 Profitability has worsened for many farms as they continue to face\nexcessive  labor  costs  and  social  obligations,  high  administrative  costs,  disproportionate\nmanagement and overhead costs, and excessive machinery maintenance and repairs due to\naging equipment. With poor access to commercial banks, farms have increasingly relied on\nsuppliers and traders to finance their working capital requirements in exchange for farm outputs\nat harvest. While these barter arrangements appear to provide guaranteed markets for farm\noutputs, the costs of this form of financing are opaque and probably high.\n96. The Project aims to enable private farms to improve farm productivity and achieve higher\nincome by (i) emphasizing measures to improve their commercial viability, and (ii) helping them\nformulate viable business plans that can be used when applying to commercial banks for\nworking capital and investment loans. Farms will have to undertake several initiatives to improve\ntheir commercial and financial viability, including (i) restoring productivity rapidly; (ii) performing\nbenefit-cost analyses to guide their financial decisions; (iii) eliminating activities that contribute\nto losses; (iv) streamlining the workforce to reduce labor costs; (v) rationalizing farm machinery\noperations to reduce maintenance and repair costs; (vi) making management more efficient and\nmarket-responsive; (vii) introducing a needs-based approach to minimize administration and\noverhead  costs;  and  (viii)  preparing,  implementing,  and  abiding  by  an  investment  and\noperational plan to improve productivity and realize cost savings. The negative impacts of the\n                                                \n39These  two  international  institutes  have  a  keen  interest  in  extending  their  programs  in  Central  Asia.  The\nInternational Maize and Wheat Improvement Center opened a country representational office in Almaty in June\n1998.\n40The decline in productivity is real, but it must also be noted that an unknown share of the apparent yield decline is\ndue to the combined effects of (i) incomplete statistical coverage of privatized farms; (ii) difficulty recording output\ntraded under barter arrangements; and (iii) farmer reluctance to report actual production, which is taxable.", "32\nloss of direct farm employment will be ameliorated by the Project\u2019s closely related support for\nthe development of rural microenterprises.\n97. Four indicative models were developed for the purpose of illustrating the financial and\neconomic viability of the Project\u2019s farm and agribusiness initiatives:\n(i)  a rain-fed arable farm with landholdings of 4,000 ha, consisting of 1,920 ha of\narable land and 2,080 ha of extensive pastures (in any given year, 20 percent of\nthe arable land is left fallow); the farm also has 100 head of beef cattle;\n(ii)  a rain-fed arable farm with landholdings of 10,000 ha, consisting of 5,500 ha of\narable land and 4,500 ha of extensive pastures (in any given year, 20 percent of\nthe arable land is fallow); the farm has 200 head of beef cattle;\n(iii)  a beef cattle fattening farm starting with a herd of 100 head, and using feed\nrations of mixed concentrates and crop by-products; and\n(iv)  a wheat flour mill, with an installed processing capacity of two tons of grain per\nhour, operating on two eight-hour shifts per day over 260 days a year.\n98. Financial  internal  rates  of  return  (FIRRs)  for  farm  restructuring  and  investment  are\nestimated to be at 34.4 percent for the 4,000 ha farm, 33.4 percent for the 10,000 ha farm, and\n37.4 percent for the beef fattening farm. These farms are anticipated to generate economic\ninternal rates of return (EIRRs) of 47.5 percent (4,000 ha), 45.6 percent (10,000 ha), and 41.8\npercent (beef fattening farm). International wheat prices fell by about 15 percent in 1999. While\nwheat prices are projected to rise over the next five years, they are expected to decline over the\nlong run. When a wheat price decline of 10 percent is applied across these projections, the\nEIRRs fall to 31.3 percent (4,000 ha) and 31.1 percent (10,000 ha). However, the FIRRs are\nless robust, and decline to 20.2 percent and 20.3 percent, respectively. When the projected\nyields of all crops are reduced by 10 percent simultaneously, the FIRRs of these farms are\nreduced to 5.1 percent (4,000 ha) and 4.1 percent (10,000 ha), although their EIRRs remain\nattractive at 16.8 percent (4,000 ha) and 16.0 percent (10,000 ha). Such reductions in yield are\nunlikely if fertilizers and agrochemicals are applied at the modest levels used in the model, but\nthe sensitivity of yields reinforces the need for close RAU guidance of the participating farms\nand for project support to applied agronomic and economic research in East Kazakhstan.\n99. The  viability  of  farm  restructuring  very  much  depends  on  the  overall  financial  and\ncommercial viability of the restructuring initiatives. Given the short growing season and moisture\nconstraints of the project area, successful farm restructuring must combine astute financial and\nbusiness  planning  with  sound  crop  agronomy  and  farm  management.  While  FIRRs  on\ninvestment are expected to be well above the cost of capital, the level of loan financing and\nrepayment schedules must be determined on a case-by-case basis to match the overall earning\ncapacity and cash flows of the farms. The FIRRs are sensitive to decreases in benefits and to\nincreases in operating costs, but less sensitive to increases in investment costs. A 9 percent\nincrease in operating costs would reduce the FIRR of the cattle fattening farm to 12 percent.\nSimilarly, the FIRRs of both the 4,000 ha and 10,000 ha farms would fall to 12 percent when the\noperating costs of these farms rise by about 10 percent.\n100. Under the base scenario, the wheat flour mill generates an FIRR of 35.4 percent and an\nEIRR of 36.7 percent. The FIRR is moderately robust for declines in output and prices of wheat\ngrains and wheat flour, and for increases in investment and operating costs. The FIRR is\nsensitive to price fluctuations of wheat flour when prices of wheat grains remain constant.\nAlthough this scenario is unlikely, the FIRR is reduced to 12 percent when benefits decline by\n7.0 percent, a case when flour prices alone decline by 7.0 percent without a similar drop in the", "33\nprice of wheat grains. Similarly, the EIRR falls to 31.1 percent when output declines by 10\npercent, and to 28.3 percent when wheat grain and wheat flour prices simultaneously drop.\nDetails on financial and economic viability and results of the sensitivity analysis are presented in\nAppendix 10.\n2. Impact on Poverty\n101. The poverty impact assessment (Appendix 11) concluded that the measures supported\nunder the SDP will, on balance, have modest net benefits for the poor, primarily through the\nmechanisms of (i) better access to commercial credit; (ii) better informed decision making on\nagriculture  through  improved  access  to  information  about  the  legal,  policy,  and  economic\nenvironment;  (iii)  more  transparent  procedures  for  farm  accounting,  property  registration,\nsecured lending, and bankruptcy; and (iv) greater private initiative in small businesses and\nvoluntary rural associations. At the same time, it must be recognized that the SDP is intended,\nfirst and foremost, to encourage market-led growth. The SDP will reinforce irreversible long-run\ntrends in Kazakhstan\u2019s agriculture that are inherent in the country\u2019s transition to a market\neconomy, particularly the rationalization of farm ownership structures and costs, the exit from\nagriculture  of  financially  unsustainable  farms  and  redundant  labor,  and  the  elimination  of\nsubsidies for irrigation and other inputs. The positive impacts of this transition are likely to be\ngreatest  and  most  rapidly  felt  in  relatively  nonpoor  regions  that  have  high  potential  for\nagricultural growth due to factors such as irrigation, soil quality, length of the growing season,\nand accessibility to markets. In contrast, the negative impacts of the transition on the poor will\nbe largest among marginal regions and farms. The Government is fully cognizant of these\nnegative  impacts,  and  within  its  presently  severe  resource  constraints,  is  committed  to\nameliorating them. To this end, the SDP will, in coordination with the activities of other external\nassistance agencies, strengthen the Government\u2019s capacity to monitor, evaluate, and refine\nboth the content and the application of agricultural policies and legislation, with the intent of\nimproving transparency, effectiveness, and equity.\n102. Given the necessary scale and capital intensity of financially sustainable farming in the\nrain-fed areas of East Kazakhstan, it is inevitable that the process of farm restructuring will, at\nleast during the short run, have adverse impacts on employment in potentially vulnerable rural\ncommunities.41 But in the long run in a market economy, the creation of financially healthy farms\nis the only sustainable way to ensure household food security and access to social services.\nThe Project\u2019s microenterprise development initiatives will directly address the antipoor impacts\nof the market transition. The microenterprise activities will, in the first instance, be specifically\ntargeted at the communities dependent on large farms that initiate a significant program of\nrestructuring and downsizing of their labor force. Thus, the Project will prevent rural households\nfrom slipping into poverty. In addition, to the extent warranted by bankable demand and project\nresources, the microenterprise activities will expand to cover other regions of East Kazakhstan\nthat suffered employment losses through farm restructuring and bankruptcy prior to the Project.\nOver  the  life  of  the  Project,  it  is  envisioned  that  at  least  200  microenterprises  and  small\nbusinesses including craft industries and women\u2019s groups will be supported in over 60 rural\ncommunities.  The  Project  will  train  about  50  community  development  workers  and  200\napprentices in craft and services industries. A quick start-up for this component is assured\n                                                \n41 Although there will be loss of direct employment, most rural households will continue to own shares in the farms.\nHence, during the medium term, the loss of direct labor income should be at least partially offset by the increasing\ndividends paid to shareholders as the farms become more profitable. Alternatively, households that are successful\nin finding new nonfarm employment may opt to sell their farm shares.", "34\nbecause it has been designed to complement and build on the oblast\u2019s ongoing Regional Fund\nfor Support to the Low-Income Population.\nB. Risks and Safeguards\n103. Given  Kazakhstan\u2019s  rapid  macroeconomic  and  institutional  transition  and  frequent\nchanges  in  key  Government  personnel,  the  SDP\u2019s  major  risk  is  that  the  Government\u2019s\ncommitment  to  full  program  implementation  falters.  However,  the  ASP  (footnote  6)  was\nimplemented  successfully  during  a  similar  period  of  rapid  change  (footnote  24).  More\nimportantly, the reforms supported by the SDP build directly on the constraints identified in farm\nand rural community consultations, as well as the sector analyses and medium-term strategic\nagenda prepared by MOA and other agencies. Nonetheless, several SDP measures\u2014budgets\nfor  the  agricultural  information  initiatives  and  for  irrigation  operation  and  maintenance\nfinancing\u2014depend  on  approval  by  Kazakhstan\u2019s  Parliament,  thus,  there  is  an  element  of\npolitical uncertainty.\n104. The  investment  Project  faces  a  number  of  macro  and  micro  risks  to  successful\nimplementation  and  the  attainment  of  anticipated  benefits.  Kazakhstan\u2019s  macroeconomic\ndifficulties\u2014entailing budgetary constraints and some uncertainty in the exchange rate and\nfinancial sector\u2014are likely to persist for at least the next one or two years. These difficulties\nlead to risks of counterpart funding shortfalls, as well as to greater caution among commercial\nbanks in lending to risky sectors like agriculture. It is beyond the scope of the Project to directly\naddress such risks, but at the same time, they are considered manageable and worth taking.42\nThe Government has provided assurances that adequate counterpart funding will be provided\nfor the Project. Recently the Government has (i) initiated endeavors to improve the quality of the\npublic expenditure program; (ii) limited new external borrowing within the ceiling established by\nthe International Monetary Fund under the enhanced fund facility; and (iii) initiated a review of\nongoing  foreign-funded  projects,  in  order  to  cancel  projects  that  do  not  meet  criteria  for\nimpact/effectiveness, return on investment, and sustainability. At a time of great pressure on\nforeign exchange reserves, rationing of dollars is a risk, but NBK has consistently reiterated the\nGovernment\u2019s commitment to a freely traded tenge. Indeed, the depreciation of the tenge will\nbring significant benefits to sectors like agriculture, which produce tradable goods. Finally,\ndespite  the  financial  sector  uncertainty,  several  commercial  banks  have  expressed  strong\ninterest in participating in the Project, and more are expected to do so once the Project is\nactually under way.\n105. The  micro  risks  were  addressed  in  the  project  design.  Given  the  scarcity  of  rural\nbusiness skills suited to the needs of a market economy, it is unlikely that a credit line alone\nwould be either disbursed or utilized efficiently. Hence, the Project provides a package of\nmutually complementary advisory and financial support. Nonetheless, there are risks that the\nrural  enterprises  may  not  perform  as  expected  if  they  do  not  implement  agreed-upon\nmanagement practices, including land use, cropping patterns, and inputs. The Project\u2019s financial\nand economic analyses assume conservative yields, well below the potential of good farm\nmanagement in the project area. The Project and the associated TA will initiate and support\nefforts to locally adapt and extend improved crop technology to the farms. It is believed that\nproductivity can be readily improved if farming operations are performed correctly with modest\nlevels of inputs. The farms will be required to adopt and implement agreed upon restructuring\nprograms on a phased basis; failure to do so will result in termination of credit facilities. The\n                                                \n42 There are significant risks in doing nothing. Continuing farm and rural stagnation are to be expected in the absence\nof public support to restore productivity and promote growth.", "35\nRAU will have responsibility for monitoring the restructuring and onlending processes, and\nkeeping financial institutions informed. Financing institutions may also be required to provide\ncrop insurance.\n106. Although the RAU will be established within agencies of the oblast administration, its\ncredibility in the eyes of participating farms and the commercial banks will depend critically on\nits objectivity and strict application of the eligibility and financial criteria for the identification,\nappraisal,  and  endorsement  of  subloans.  The  importance  of  the  RAU\u2019s  independence  is\nacknowledged by both national and local authorities, whose commitment to this independence\nwas reconfirmed during the Appraisal Mission, when a framework and timetable for the legal\nestablishment of the RAU was agreed upon. Intensive monitoring by ADB is required during the\nProject\u2019s  first  year  of  implementation  to  get  the  RAU  up  and  running,  to  ensure  smooth\nconsultant recruitment and mobilization, and to advise on the terms and execution of SLAs with\nthe commercial banks.\n107. Even if the expected productivity is achieved, lack of credit discipline by borrowers could\ncontribute to poor loan repayment. To reduce this risk, borrowers will be carefully assessed and\nrequired to contribute an equity share in any investment. The RAU must contribute to an\nobjective, rigorous analysis of potential loans by applying strict financial and economic criteria\nthat have been missing from the farm privatization process to date. This approach is designed\nto ensure the recovery of costs that is central to the Government's borrowing strategy.\n108. The commercial banks will contribute their own resources to the onlending and bear the\nrisk of loan default. Thus, disbursement under the Project will be slowed if the banks prove\nexcessively cautious in lending. The training and capacity building provided to bank staff, and\nthe RAU\u2019s roles in encouraging the formation of stable farm structures and in screening large\nloans are intended to reduce this risk. Moreover, the policy component is specifically designed\nto encourage greater commercial lending to agriculture by leveling the playing field for the banks\nin respect of the legal framework for secured lending, farm accounting and auditing, liquidation,\nand bankruptcy.\n109. Some farmers may not wish to become involved with the Project if it means rationalizing\nor divesting of their traditional activities. This is the prerogative of the farm managers and\nshareholders. While the SDP, including the Project, include measures to inform shareholders of\ntheir options and the benefits of farm restructuring, the Project will only support farms and rural\ncommunities that are motivated and willing to accept the proposed changes.\n110. The provision of working capital should enable farm enterprises to free themselves from\nbarter deals and trade freely for cash. However, farmers may not wish to do so if there is a risk\nof tax authorities seizing cash in bank accounts. While the Project will require the use of a bank\naccount, the policy component will require the adoption of sound, transparent accounting and\nauditing practices, as well as continued reform of tax policy and administration. The Project will\nwork primarily with farms that have revenue-generating potential to repay any outstanding debt;\nif successful, these farms will face reduced risk of having their bank deposits seized.\nVIII. ASSURANCES\nA.  Specific Assurances\n111. The Government has given the following specific assurances, in addition to the standard\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents.", "36\n1. For the policy loan, assurances include the following:\n(i)  The policies adopted and actions taken as detailed in the development\npolicy letter will continue throughout the implementation period of the\npolicy component and subsequently.\n(ii)  The policies and actions set out in the development policy letter will be\ncarried out in accordance with the schedule of policy reforms detailed in\nthe policy matrix (Appendix 3).\n(iii)  The counterpart funds generated from the proceeds of the policy loan will\nbe used by the Government to finance the implementation of the SDP\u2019s\npolicy reforms.\n2.  For the investment loan, assurances include the following:\n(i)  Prior to onlending by PCBs of the investment loan proceeds (a) the first\nfive subloans and all subloans greater than $350,000 will be reviewed\nand approved by ADB; (b) an acceptable summary initial environmental\nexamination, in accordance with ADB guidelines, will be submitted to\nADB for all agroprocessing subloans in excess of $100,000.\n(ii)  The Project will be accorded high priority and included as a specific line\nitem  for  annual  budgetary  allocations,  and  such  annual  budgetary\nallocations will be made available on a timely basis.\n(iii)  During project implementation, the RAU will be organized and managed\nto promote maximum autonomy and independence in its decision-making,\nadministrative,  and  operational  activities  and  will  have  adequate\nresources and staff to carry out its assigned activities in an effective and\ntimely manner.\n(iv)  Employees of public agencies who receive training under the Project will\nbe obligated to remain in service for at least one year after such training,\neither  in  their  originally  assigned  positions  under  the  Project  or  in  a\ncapacity relevant to the training provided.\n(v)  Within six months of loan effectiveness, a BME system satisfactory to\nADB  will  be  established  within  the  RAU  to  monitor  progress  in  farm\nrestructuring,  farm  and  agribusiness  performance,  and  rural\nmicroenterprise activities supported by the Project. The BME system will\nbe integrated with the MOA and DOA databases used in the surveys of\nfarm financial performance and those established as part of the market\ninformation system and will monitor (a) the farms, agribusinesses, and\nmicroenterprises served by the RAU; (b) crop and livestock productivity;\n(c)  farm  and  nonfarm  employment  by  gender;  (d)  farm  financial\nperformance  and  profitability;  (e)  loan  utilization  and  repayment;  (f)\nproject  environmental  impacts;  (g)  average  incomes  and  poverty\nincidence at farm and community levels; and (h) gender-specific impacts\nof farm restructuring and project interventions.\n(vi)  The  implementation  of  the  Project,  including  selection,  design,  and\napproval of subprojects, will be carried out in accordance with relevant\nenvironmental  regulations  of  the  Borrower  and  applicable  ADB\nenvironmental guidelines, and any monitoring and mitigation measures\nspecified  in  the  summary  initial  environmental  examination  (SIEE)\nundertaken for the Project, and in approved subproject SIEEs, will be\npromptly undertaken in accordance with their terms.", "37\nB. Conditions for Loan Effectiveness\n \n112.

Overall, the Project will have positive environmental impacts and is not expected to have\nany significant adverse environmental impacts that would require detailed environmental impact\nassessment. During project implementation, specific attention will be given to management of\nagroprocessing wastes, and to improved soil and water quality. By and large, current farming\nsystems are financially unsustainable. To be eligible for project support, farms will implement\nsound  financial  practices  and  more  sustainable  management  of  soils,  water,  and  the\nlandscape.1 Higher productivity levels will increase the incomes of farms, farm employees, and\nshareholders. Families losing direct farm employment will be given the opportunity to establish\nalternative income-generating activities. The enhanced welfare of rural communities will slow\nthe migration to urban areas and even the total abandonment of some villages. Finally, higher\nrural incomes will reduce pressure on natural resources. Table A6 summarizes the Project\u2019s\nmain  potential  environmental  impacts  and  the  corresponding  monitoring  and  mitigation\nmeasures. A more detailed assessment is presented in the supplementary Summary Initial\nEnvironmental Examination report, which is available on request.\nTable A6: Summary of Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\nProject Activity and Potential Impacts Monitoring and Mitigation Measures\nFarm Restructuring and Development\nAgrochemical use is projected to rise from very low The Rural Advisory Unit (RAU) will monitor the use\nlevels at present to moderate levels as a result of of agrochemicals and other environmental aspects\nthe Project, e.g., to about 50 kilograms of nutrient as  part  of  the  Project\u2019s  benefit  monitoring  and\nequivalent per hectare of all fertilizers, and modest evaluation system.

Rationale and Objective\n1. Kazakhstan has substantial resources to support an agriculture sector that is efficient,\ncompetitive, and environmentally sound. The country is capable of producing for a population\nfar larger than the domestic market. At present, however, the sector is performing well below its\npotential because of the farms\u2019 incomplete adjustment to the postprivatization environment and\nthe failure, so far, to establish strong linkages to new markets outside of the former Soviet\nUnion.  Crops  with  market  potential  that  can  be  successfully  integrated  into  Kazakhstan\u2019s\nfarming systems must be identified. However, the country\u2019s agricultural research system__in\ndisarray for several years__will need support if it is to contribute to the transition. The process of\nreestablishing the research system must focus on the new opportunities offered by domestic\nand  international  markets.  Equally  important  is  the  need  to  encourage  more  widespread\nknowledge and understanding within rural communities of the legal basis and options for farm\nrestructuring and other rural economic activities. Finally, the Government needs assistance in\ncarefully evaluating the implementation and impact of the market reforms, in order to refine, as\nappropriate, the policy and legislative framework for market-led agriculture. The objective of the\ntechnical assistance (TA) is to assist the Government in undertaking all of these tasks.\nB.  Description of Tasks\n1. Program for Agronomic Field Trials for High-Potential Crops\n2. This component of the TA will (i) identify opportunities for crop development and the\ndiversification of cropping systems in Kazakhstan; (ii) strengthen linkages between national\nagricultural research agencies and relevant institutions associated with the Consultative Group\nfor International Agricultural Research (CGIAR); and (iii) upgrade national applied agricultural\nresearch skills by participating in a crop trials program and training at selected international\ninstitutes. The component will be implemented over two years and will include (i) review of\nrecent agricultural research in Kazakhstan, (ii) implementation of an agronomic and economic\nevaluation program for selected crops in East Kazakhstan oblast, and (iii) development of a\nmedium-term (3-5 years) program for applied research, information diffusion, and institutional\ndevelopment  for  the  national  agricultural  institutes  in  cooperation  with  relevant  CGIAR\ninstitutions.1  The  TA  will  be  coordinated  by  a  field  crop  agronomist  and  an  economist  in\ncollaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), the Kazakhstan Academy of Sciences'\nNational Academic Center for Agrarian Research, and its satellite institute, the East Kazakhstan\nScientific Research Institute for Agriculture (EKSRIA), which is located in Ust-Kamenogorsk and\nhas extensive experimental sites around the oblast. The specific tasks of the experts include the\nfollowing.\n                                                \n1\n These might include the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) and the International\nCenter for Agricultural Research on Dry Areas (ICARDA), both of which have keen interest in extending their\nprograms in Central Asia. CIMMYT opened a country representational office in Almaty in June 1998.", "70 Appendix 9, page 2\na.  Crop Trials Program\n3. The tasks include\n(i)  review  the  farming  systems  and  agricultural  practices  in  East  Kazakhstan,\nidentifying the major agronomic constraints to higher productivity;\n(ii)  with the assistance of the Rural Advisory Unit (RAU), and oblast and raion\ndepartments of agriculture, identify a short list of possible crops and varieties that\ncould potentially be integrated into the existing farming systems;2 and\n(iii)  design and implement a two-year program of field trials, analyze the results, and\npresent the findings in a technical report.\nb.  Economic Assessment\n4. The consultants will\n(i)  relate the crop trial results to current and potential farming systems and, with the\nassistance of the RAU, assess the economic prospects for adoption;\n(ii)  provide a detailed economic justification for any recommendations to promote\nparticular crops, focusing on their market potential and suitability for the existing\nfarming systems;\n(iii)  assess the capacity of the research institute to undertake similar work, and\nformulate  detailed  recommendations  on  the  need,  design,  and  resource\nrequirements of follow-on applied research programs that could be implemented\nlargely by oblast agricultural agencies; and\n(iv)  prepare a summary report for the Government and the Asian Development Bank\n(ADB).\nc.  Institutional Development\n5. Tasks include\n(i)  arrange short-term training for domestic research staff at selected international\nagricultural research institutes to become familiar with their research programs\nand to establish cooperative links;\n(ii)  assess EKSRIA\u2019s capacity to sustain the field trial program and, consistent with\npresent budgetary realities in Kazakhstan; and prepare recommendations for\nskills upgrading, facilities development, and realistic financing mechanisms; and\n(iii)  explore and promote within the funding community interest in contributing to this\ndevelopment.\n2. Refining and Promoting Understanding of Agricultural Legislation\n6. Nationwide  in  scope,  this  TA  component  will  promote  wider  understanding  within\nKazakhstan\u2019s rural communities of the new legal and institutional environment for agriculture,\nand will contribute to the refinement of legislation related, among others, to farm and land\n                                                \n2\nThese crops include  various legumes and medicinal plants such as camomile, fennel, and calendula; other crops\nthat have regional or international export potential based on CGIAR experience; and short-season annual forage\ncrops.", "71 Appendix 9, page 3\nownership,  secured  lending,  agricultural  bankruptcy,  the  legal  rights  of  farms  and  small\nbusinesses, and the formation of voluntary rural associations.\na. Information Dissemination\n7. This component will assist the Government in designing, preparing, and evaluating a\nnationwide public information and education campaign on the legal and policy framework for\nagriculture, which will disseminate knowledge through publications, state and private mass\nmedia (newspapers, television, and radio), and training courses and seminars. The activities will\nbe coordinated by specialists in agricultural education law and institutions, who will work closely\nwith other TA specialists in bankruptcy, and secured lending, as well as relevant specialists\nfunded by other aid agencies. The educational program will include (i) land and property shares;\n(ii)  agricultural  land  ownership,  covering  Kazakhstan\u2019s  new  Law  on  Land,  including  legal\nrequirements to qualify for land ownership, registration, and certification procedures; state rights\nto repossess agricultural land; and the advantages and disadvantages of land ownership as\ncompared with long-term leasing or land use rights; (iii) legal entities; (iv) secured lending;  (v)\ntaxation;  (vi)  bankruptcy;  (vii)  voluntary  rural  associations;  (viii)  rights  of  farms  and  small\nbusinesses; and (ix) sources of technical and other assistance.\n8.

A bankruptcy adviser will work with relevant Government agencies, including Ministry of\nJustice (MOJ), Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), Ministry of Finance, Ministry of State Revenue,\nand State Agency for the Reorganization and Liquidation of Enterprises (SARLE). He/she will\nundertake the following tasks:\n(i)  Assist  in  the  review  of  agricultural  bankruptcy  legislation  required  under  the\nProgram.  The  review  will  identify  ambiguities,  inconsistencies,  and  other", "72 Appendix 9, page 4\nproblems  in  legislation  that  are  hindering  or  delaying  the  application  of\nbankruptcy legislation to agricultural businesses. It will also examine whether the\nlegislation establishes an equitable balance of the interests of all participants in\nthe  bankruptcy  process,  including  SARLE,  government  and  nongovernment\ncreditors, secured and unsecured creditors, debtors, and farm members.\n(ii)  Conduct a study of bankruptcy cases in selected oblasts focusing on (a) the\nnumber  of  bankruptcy  cases  filed;  (b)  the  number  of  licensed  rehabilitation\nmanagers and liquidators qualified to manage agricultural bankruptcies; (c) the\nlegal structures of bankrupt farms; (d) the farming activities of bankrupt farms; (e)\nthe  debt  structure  of  debtor  farms;  (f)  the  length  of  time  between  filing  a\nbankruptcy case and appointment of a rehabilitation manager or liquidator; (g)\nthe length of time from initiation to completion of bankruptcy proceedings; (h)\ncost of processing a bankruptcy case (in terms of costs to creditors, debtors, and\nthe judicial system); (i) creditors\u2019 opinions of the process particularly in terms of\nability to effectively use bankruptcy legislation to force restructuring or final debt\ncollection; (j) debtors\u2019 opinions of the process, particularly in terms of adequate\nprotection of their rights and whether the process facilitates rehabilitation and\nrestructuring; and (k) competence of rehabilitation managers, liquidators, and\njudges.\n(iii)  Gather comparative data on bankruptcy cases involving both agricultural and\nnonagricultural  enterprises  to  identify  problems  specific  to  agricultural\nbankruptcies.\n(iv)  Prepare  a  report  recommending  amendments  to  legislation  and  practical\nprocedures to correct deficiencies identified by the legislative review and the\nstudy. The report will also make recommendations regarding whether additional\ntraining is required for rehabilitation managers, liquidators, and judges.\n(v)  Prepare amended legislation or other materials recommended in the report.\n(vi)  Prepare materials on bankruptcy to be included in the public information and\neducation campaign.\nc.  Review of Legislation and Procedures for Secured Lending\n10. A secured lending adviser will undertake these tasks:\n(i)  Review legislation and practical procedures relating to secured lending to identify\nambiguities,  inconsistencies,  and  other  problems  that  are  obstacles  to  the\ngranting of secured loans to agricultural enterprises. The review will include\nanalysis of (a) land ownership and tenure forms and the extent to which the\nexisting  legislation  detracts  from  their  value  as  collateral;  (b)  forms  and\nprocedures  for  the  granting  of  security  interests  in  movable  and  immovable\nproperty collateral; (c) procedures and costs associated with registering security\ninterests in movable and immovable property collateral; (d) general effectiveness\nof  registration  systems;  (e)  cost,  timing,  and  effectiveness  of  judicial  and\nnonjudicial  procedures  for  foreclosure  on  collateral,  including  eviction\nprocedures;  and  (f)  consistency  of  other  legislation,  including  the  Law  on\nBankruptcy, the Tax Code, the Law on Joint Stock Companies, and the Law on\nExecutory Proceedings and the Status of Judicial Executors, with the Law on\nPledge and the Law on Mortgage in terms of clearly establishing the rights and\nrelative priorities of different classes of creditors.\n(ii)  Conduct a study of secured lending in the agriculture sector focusing on the\nfollowing  issues:  (a)  the  extent  to  which  secured  loans  are  being  made  to", "73 Appendix 9, page 5\nagricultural borrowers; (b) the types of banks and other lenders making loans in\nthe agriculture sector; (c) lenders\u2019 policies on the use of movable and immovable\nproperty security, including preferences for some types of collateral over other\ntypes, and preferred debt collateral ratios; (d) whether loan terms meet the needs\nof farmers; (e) use of guarantees, mortgage insurance, or other mechanisms for\nrisk sharing; (f) lenders\u2019 opinions of legislation and procedures particularly in\nterms  of  ability  to  effectively  assess  risk  and  foreclose  on  the  collateral,  if\nnecessary; (g) borrowers\u2019 opinions of the process, particularly in terms of clarity\nand  protection  of  their  rights;  (h)  number  of  security  interests  registered  in\nmovable  and  immovable  property  registration  systems;  (i)  number  of  cases\ninvolving enforcement of security interests, including both judicial and nonjudicial\nproceedings; and (j) costs and average length of foreclosure cases.\n(iii)  Prepare  a  report  recommending  amendments  to  legislation  and  practical\nprocedures to correct deficiencies identified by the legislative review and the\nstudy.\n(iv)  Draft amended legislation or other materials recommended in the report.\n(v)  Prepare materials on secured lending to be included in the public information and\neducation campaign.\nd. Improving Market Information\n11. Building upon MOA's earlier work in cooperation with TA financed by the European\nUnion,3 a market information and database specialist will advise MOA on the establishment and\nsustainable operation of a system of computerized market information centers to routinely\nprovide price and other market information to the public. By the end of 2002, it is expected that\nthe system will be equipped and operating in at least four high-potential agricultural oblasts,\nincluding East Kazakhstan. The specialist will review, in conjunction with the TA's program of\nagronomic field trials, the market prospects for crop diversification and for the expansion of\nKazakhstan's traditional cereal crops. Based on this review and an assessment of existing\nchannels for price and market information, a plan will be prepared for the market information\nsystem,  covering  (i)  data  needs,  sources,  and  processing  requirements;  (ii)  plans  for  the\nproduction, broadcast, and publication of materials; (iii) computer hardware and software needs;\n(iv)  institutional  development  and  training;  (v)  detailed  cost  estimates  for  establishing  and\nrunning the system; and (vi) mechanisms for user cost recovery to ensure that the system is\nfinancially sustainable.\nC.  Implementation Arrangements and TA Costs\n12. MOA  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA.  A  TA  steering  committee  will  be\ncomposed of representatives of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education, MOJ, Ministry of\nFinance,  and  Ministry  of  Culture,  Information  and  Public  Harmony.

Background\n1. The Project aims to enable private farms to improve productivity and achieve higher\nincomes by (i) promoting measures to improve their commercial viability, and (ii) assisting these\nfarms in formulating viable business plans for submission to commercial banks so as to obtain\nworking capital and investment loans to be provided under the Project. Although it is not\npossible to predetermine the types and composition of investment plans that will be financed\nthrough the line of credit, the approach adopted for the financial and economic analyses is to\npresent indicative farm and agribusiness models that represent potential and typical situations in\nEast Kazakhstan. Four indicative models were developed (details presented in Supplementary\nAppendix E).\n(i)  A rain-fed farm with landholdings of 4,000 hectares (ha), consisting of 1,920 ha\nof arable land and 2,080 ha of extensive pastures. In any given year, 20 percent\nof the arable land is left fallow. The farm also has 100 beef cattle.\n(ii)  A rain-fed farm with landholdings of 10,000 ha, consisting of 5,500 ha of arable\nland and 4,500 ha of extensive pastures. In any given year, 20 percent of the\narable land is left fallow. The farm also has 200 beef cattle.\n(iii)  A beef cattle fattening farm, starting up with a herd of 100, with feed rations\nutilizing mixed concentrates and crop by-products.\n(iv)  A wheat flour mill, with an installed processing capacity of 2 tons (t) of grain per\nhour, operating on two eight-hour shifts per day over 260 days a year.\nB.  Major Assumptions\n2. Without the Project, the cropping pattern is expected to continue with winter and spring\nwheat (48 percent), other cereals (25 percent), and sunflowers (7 percent). With the Project,\nonly minor changes in cropping patterns are expected, with more timely farm operations to allow\nfor a modest increase to 15 percent for sunflowers. Also with the Project, only minor medium-\nterm changes in cropping patterns are expected. As the result of improved capacity for more\ntimely farm operations, winter wheat would tend to substitute for spring wheat, in turn permitting\nlarger areas to be planted to relatively profitable sunflowers. Without the Project, crop yields are\nexpected to remain low, on average below 1.0 t/hectare without significant applications of\nfertilizers.  With  low  rainfalls,  only  small  amounts  of  fertilizers  (10-25  kg  of  Nitrogen  and\nPhosphorus nutrient contents) are needed. With the Project, crop yields are expected to level off\nby year 3: winter wheat, 1.8 t/ha; spring wheat, 1.7 t/ha; barley, 1.7 t/ha; winter rye, 1.7 t/ha;\nbuckwheat, 0.9 t/ha; peas, 0.8 t/ha; and sunflowers, 1.3 t/ha.\n3. Local inflation is projected at 10 percent per year for 2000-2002, and 6 percent per year\nfrom  2003.  Foreign  inflation  is  assumed  to  follow  the  World  Bank\u2019s  projection  of  the\nmanufacturing unit value indices (MUV). Foreign inflation is projected 2.5 percent in year 2000,\n2.3 percent in 2005, and 2.48 percent in 2010.\n4. Both financial and economic analyses are conducted over 10 years in 2000 constant\nprices and in the local currency, tenge (T). Year 1 represents 2001, the year in which the Project\nis expected to commence. The exchange rate is assumed at T144 to $1.00 (actual, July 2000).\nAdjusting  for  inflation,  projected  profit  and  loss  statements,  cash  flows,  and  debt  service\ncalculations are presented in current terms.", "76 Appendix 10, page 2\n5. Wheat  and  fertilizer  prices  are  projected  using  the  World  Bank\u2019s  commodity  price\nprojections (January 2000). Various adjustments for transport, handling, storage, insurance,\nmarketing margins, and physical losses are made to determine farm-gate prices. The economic\nand financial farm-gate prices of urea and phosphate, as derived on an import parity basis, are\nexpressed in terms of nitrogen and phosphorus nutrient contents.\n6. Kazakhstan is a wheat exporting country. Its wheat exports to the Russian Federation\ncompete with wheat exports from the United States and Canada. Faced with low international\nwheat prices, vast distances to major markets, and high intermediary costs, financial farm-gate\nprices of wheat of average grades are expected to remain at about $60/t in 2000. However,\nwheat prices are expected to strengthen over the next five years. In local markets, farm-gate\nprices of barley and rye are priced 10 percent lower than wheat prices. Prices of wheat flour of\ngrade 1 (premium) and grade 2 qualities at the mill-gate are projected at 200 and 160 percent,\nrespectively,  of  wheat  prices  at  the  elevators  gate.  Wheat  prices  at  the  mill-gate  include\ntransport, drying, storage, losses, and elevator's margin. Sunflower seeds are anticipated to\nremain firm at about T27,500 ($190.97) per ton in 2000 at farm gate. Sunflower prices are\nclosely correlated with international prices of soybeans.\n7. The economic analysis is based on the world price level numeraire. Adjustments mainly\nreflect removal of taxes, duties, and debt service charges, and the application of a standard\nconversion factor (SCF) of 0.95 on nontraded inputs and outputs. Farm wages in mid-2000 in\nEast Kazakhstan are estimated to vary from T165/day for seasonal unskilled labor to T440/day\nfor skilled labor. Given a situation where there is less than full employment in the rural areas,\nand that farms are expected to restructure, operate more efficiently, and employ less people, a\nshadow wage rate factor of 0.9 is applied. Consequently, a conversion factor of 0.855 is applied\non labor costs.\nC.  Incomes and Rates of Return\n1. Rain-Fed Farm (4,000 ha)\n8. Without restructuring, the farm would incur net operating losses in constant 2000 terms\nof about T2.1 million in year 1, T1.4 million in year 2, and T1.2 million in year 3. Apart from\nagronomic improvements and adjustments to the cropping pattern, key restructuring initiatives\nassumed in the model are the following:\n(i)  Rationalize fuel consumption by introducing disciplinary measures to restrict use\nof tractors and vehicles to farming purposes only. Fuel savings of about 15\npercent can be realized over five years.\n(ii)  Increase labor productivity so that labor requirements during peak periods can be\nreduced by about 18 percent over five years, from a workforce of 45 to 37\npeople. A 15-20 percent reduction in the workforce is considered modest, as\nemerging private farms still grapple with an underutilized permanent workforce.\n(iii)  Rationalize the labor force, minimize redundant labor, reduce social obligations,\nand engage seasonal workers for peak seasons.\n(iv)  Reduce  management  and  administration  costs,  including  the  cost  of  surplus\nlabor, by more than 40 percent over three years \u2014 T770/ha to T440/ha in 2000\nconstant terms. Management and administrative costs are frequently excessive\nprimarily due to overstaffing and privileges enjoyed by managers and staff.\n(v)  Improve discipline on preventive maintenance, and undertake an investment plan\nto replace and recondition machinery and equipment. Maintenance and repair", "77 Appendix 10, page 3\ncosts of equipment could reasonably be reduced by about 28 percent over two\nyears from $18/ha of arable land to $13/ha in constant 2000 terms.\n9. An  initial  investment  of  about  T31  million  in  2000  terms  ($215,000)  was  broadly\nestimated for the farm. This investment plan is assumed to be phased over three years: $90,000\nin year 1, $72,000 in year 2, and $53,000 in year 3. These initial investments are indicative in\nnature, and primarily include urgent replacement of aging farm equipment and provisions for\nspare parts. Farms of this size are assumed to have existing fixed assets, which are revalued\nconservatively at T15 million. Additionally, the farm is expected to spend T16 million ($111,000)\nin 2000 terms for further equipment replacements over a period of four years from year 7.\n10. With the above restructuring initiatives, including measures to improve crop yields and\nlivestock performance, the farm can potentially generate a net operating income, in constant\n2000 terms, of T3.2 million in year 1, T6.5 million in year 2, and T9.1 million in year 3. By year 3,\nthe farm would be able to produce 1,650 t of wheat, 98 tons of barley, 98 t of rye, 104 t of\nbuckwheat, 56 t of peas, and 374 t of sunflower seeds. However, net operating incomes are\nexpected to decline, in constant 2000 terms, from about T9.9 million in year 6 to T8.3 million in\nyear 10. This decline is primarily due to projected shifts in input and output prices.\n11. To estimate financial internal rates of return (FIRR) on investments before financing, and\neconomic internal rates of return (EIRR), incremental operating incomes are projected under\ntwo scenarios:\n(i)  Case 1. In this scenario, without the Project, the farm is allowed to incur net\noperating losses for a maximum period of three years, after which the farm\nceases  to  operate.  Continuing  losses  are  not  sustainable.  Estimation  of\nincremental benefits due to the Project includes forgone financial losses of these\nthree years only.\n(ii)  Case 2. In this scenario incremental benefits due to the Project exclude the Case\n1 forgone losses. Without restructuring initiatives as proposed under the Project,\nthe farm ceases to operate immediately, and therefore net operating income\nwithout the Project is assumed at zero level.\n12. Case 1 illustrates an upper limit for deriving benefits that can be attributed to project\ninitiatives. Farms may in fact sustain operating losses over a period longer than three years by\nselling off its assets and relying heavily on mounting debts and arrears to their creditors,\nincluding their workers through unpaid wages. The prevalent barter trade also complicates the\nassessment of continuing financial insolvency. Conservatively, for the purpose of this analysis, a\nthree-year limit to operating losses is considered the maximum for the without-project scenario.\n13. Under Case 1, the FIRR before financing is estimated at 46.8 percent. Assuming an\nopportunity cost of capital of 12 percent per annum, the financial net present value (NPV)\namounts to T18.0 million. Correspondingly, the EIRR is estimated at 52.1 percent and the\neconomic NPV at T22.3 million. The FIRR and EIRR are considerably high mainly because of\nthe  incremental  benefits  due  to  forgone  losses.  Under  Case  2,  when  forgone  losses  are\nexcluded from the incremental benefits, the FIRR and financial NPV are estimated at 34.4\npercent and T14.1 million, respectively. The EIRR and the economic NPV are at 47.5 percent\nand T21.2 million, respectively. Under both cases, the FIRRs before financing are significant.\nFarms of this size in East Kazakhstan generally have significant underutilized resources. The\nproposed  investment  plan  is  complementary  to  existing  assets.  This  incremental  capital\ninvestment,  combined  with  small  increases  in  direct  expenses  in  the  form  of  fertilizers,", "78 Appendix 10, page 4\nagrochemical, and improved seeds, enables these farms to capture significant benefits from\nrapid increases in crop yields and cost savings induced by the restructuring initiatives.\n2.  Rain-Fed Farm (10,000 ha)\n14. Similar restructuring measures can be introduced to large farms 10,000 ha in size.\nWithout restructuring, farms of this size would suffer from unsustainable net operating losses of\nabout T7.4 million in constant 2000 terms over three years. An initial investment of about T90.7\nmillion in 2000 constant terms ($630,000) over three years is required: $282,000 in year 1,\n$198,000 in year 2, and $150,000 in year 3. This investment includes replacement of equipment\nand spare parts. The farm is assumed to have existing fixed assets of about T30 million. The\nfarm can potentially generate net operating incomes, expressed in constant 2000 terms, of\nabout T10.2 million in year 1, T19.5 million in year 2, and T26.7 million in year 3. However with\nunfavorable shifts in input and output prices, net operating incomes are expected to decline\nfrom about T29.0 million in year 6 to T24.4 million in year 10.\n15. Similar to the 4,000 ha model, FIRRs before financing and EIRRs on investments are\nestimated under two cases, although in reality there is a continuum of possibilities between\nthese two cases. Under the case 1 assumption, the FIRR before financing is estimated at 39.7\npercent with a financial NPV of T43.7 million, while the EIRR is higher at 44.6 percent with an\neconomic NPV of T55.4 million. Under case 2, when forgone financial losses are excluded from\nthe incremental benefits, the FIRR declines to 33.4 percent with a financial NPV of T37.6\nmillion. However, the EIRR in case 2 is not lower than that in case 1. When converted into\neconomic prices, the farm (without the Project) does not incur economic net operating losses.\nInstead, the farm generates economic net operating incomes of about T2.2 million in constant\n2000 terms over the three years. Consequently, the EIRR of 45.6 percent in case 2 is higher\nthan that in case 1. At an opportunity cost of capital of 12 percent per annum, the economic\nNPV is estimated at T57.0 million.\n3.  Beef Cattle Fattening Farm\n16. The model examines the benefits and costs of maintaining a beef fattening operation on\nan existing rain-fed farm to generate additional returns by maximizing the use of available crop\nby-products that are presently underutilized. With modest investments for new equipment and\nimprovements to the existing stable and storage facilities, the farm\u2019s herd size with the Project is\nprojected to increase by 40 head from 99 to 139 over five years. Without such investments, the\nfarm\u2019s herd could increase by 8 head over the same period.\n17. Livestock mortality rate (age 6-24 months) is presently 5 percent per annum. This rate is\nanticipated  to  decline  over  five  years  to  3  percent.  With  simultaneous  improvements  in\nsanitation, health care, and feed rations, the mortality rate is expected to decline to 3 percent in\nyear 1 with the Project, and stabilize at 2 percent from year 3. Calves of about 12 months old\nand 120 kg/head are purchased and kept for a year, and sold as heifers and bulls at an average\nlive weight of 420 kg/head (with the Project) and at 350 kg/head (without the Project).\n18. With  incremental  investments  of  T1.3  million  (constant  2000),  the  beef  fattening\noperation is expected to yield an FIRR before financing of 37.4 percent and a financial NPV of\nT0.8 million. The model also shows that the incremental investment and improvements could\ntap the existing potential of the farm, and generate an EIRR of 41.8 percent and an economic\nNPV of T0.9 million.", "79 Appendix 10, page 5\n4.  Wheat Flour Mill\n19. A  flour  mill  with  a  processing  capacity  of  2  t  of  grain  per  hour  requires  an  initial\ninvestment of T50.3 million in 2000 constant prices. The mill produces two grades of flour: grade\n1 (premium) and grade 2. By-products are sold as livestock fodder. On average, processing\noutputs against wheat grain inputs are assumed to comprise 39 percent of grade 1 flour, 31\npercent of grade 2 flour, 28 percent fodder and 2 percent losses including dust. As a base case,\nthe flour mill operates on two eight-hour shifts over 260 days per year. The mill is anticipated to\noperate for 10 years. It requires four operators per shift, a loading crew of three persons, and a\nmanager. Electricity consumption is rated at 135 kilowatts per hour of operations. The mill has\nan effective processing capacity of 90 percent of the installed capacity. While the present\nelectricity tariff is at T4.4 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), the long-run marginal cost of electricity is\nestimated at $0.06 per kWh. Production expenses mainly include (i) wheat grains, (ii) electricity,\n(iii) wages and benefits, (iv) maintenance of machinery and building facilities, (v) packaging, and\n(vii) handling and transport.\n20. On the basis of 4,160 operating hours per year, a total of 7,488 t of wheat can be milled\nto produce 2,920 t of grade 1 flour, 2,321 t of grade 2 flour, and 2,097 t of fodder. Net operating\nincomes, before financing and income taxes, are expected to range from T17.0 million in year 2\nto T20.9 million in year 7. Variation is due to anticipated fluctuations of wheat and flour prices.\nUnder a base case scenario, these net operating incomes generate an FIRR of 35.4 percent on\nthe invested capital, and a financial NPV of T48.1 million. The investment is expected to\ngenerate an EIRR of 36.7 percent and an economic NPV of T46.1 million.\nD.  Net Incomes, Cash Flows, and Debt Service Capacity\n21. For projection purposes, the farms require an investment loan to finance 85 percent of\nthe proposed investment costs, and a working capital loan to cover 50 percent of the annual and\nseasonal direct expenses of the farms. To estimate profitability and debt service, the following\nassumptions are made.\n(i)  For simplicity, and based on prevailing rates in mid-2000, the nominal interest\nrates for working capital and investment loans are projected at 20 percent per\nannum, in tenge. This interest rate, after adjusting for expected local inflation in\n2000, is equivalent to 10 percent per annum in real terms. In dollar terms, the\nnominal interest rate is about 12 percent per annum.\n(ii)  Working  capital  loans  are  for  an  average  period  of  seven  months.  The\ninvestment loan is for seven years, applicable to loan withdrawals of each year,\nwith a one-year grace period on loan principal repayment. Interest charges are to\nbe serviced during the grace period.\n(iii)  Depreciation of fixed assets, excluding land, is calculated on a straight-line basis\nover 10 years.\n(iv)  An income tax rate of 10 percent is applied against taxable income (net operating\nincome less depreciation allowance and interest charges).\n(v)  No provision is made for payment of dividends to shareholders. This assumption\nis made to show cash balances that reflect full retained earnings.\n1. Rain-Fed Farm (4,000 ha)\n22. Net income after tax is projected to steadily rise in current terms from no profits in year 1\nto T3.6 million in year 5 and T5.9 million by year 10. In 2000 constant terms, net income after", "80 Appendix 10, page 6\ntax rises to T2.6 million in year 5 and T3.2 million by year 10. The debt service coverage ratio1 is\nprojected to be healthy, averaging 2.0 over the 10-year period; and it is not expected to average\nbelow 1.2 over any two consecutive years. Although the farm has a potentially strong debt\nrepayment capacity, borrowing and loan repayment terms should be designed to suit  the farm\u2019s\nearning  capacity  and  cash  flows.  While  the  investment  plan  developed  for  this  model  is\nindicative in nature, the farm would be able to borrow and repay an investment loan of about\nT30 million and leave enough room to maintain healthy cash balances during debt service. The\nfarm\u2019s end-of-year cash balance is expected to rise in current terms from T0.9 million in year 1\nto T8.0 million in year 5 and T20.3 million by year 10. In constant 2000 terms, this cash balance\nsteadily rises from T0.9 million in year 1 to T5.7 million in year 5 and T10.8 million by year 10.\n2. Rain-Fed Farm (10,000 ha)\n23. The debt service coverage ratio is projected to be healthy, averaging 2.0 during the 10-\nyear period. This ratio is not expected to average below 1.2 over any two consecutive years.\nThe farm has a potentially strong debt repayment capacity, provided that borrowing and loan\nrepayment terms are designed to match the farm\u2019s earning capacity and cash flows. The farm\nwould be able to borrow and repay an investment loan of about T87.1 million and still maintain\nadequate cash balances during debt service. Net income after tax is projected to be steadily\nrising in current terms from T3.2 million in year 1 to T13.4 million in year 5 and T19.3 million by\nyear 10. In 2000 constant terms, net income after tax rises more modestly from a profit of T3.1\nmillion in year 1 to T9.5 million in year 5 and T10.3 million by year 10. The farm\u2019s end-of-year\ncash balance is expected to rise rapidly in current terms from T2.3 million in year 1 to T23.1\nmillion in year 5 and T42.8 million by year 10. In constant 2000 terms, this cash balance rises\nsteadily from T2.2 million in year 1 to T16.5 million in year 5 and T22.8 million by year 10.\nE.  Sensitivity Analysis\n24. The FIRRs and EIRRs of the three farm models are moderately robust. Table A10.1\nshows the impacts of yield reduction, output price decreases, and increases in investment and\noperating costs on these rates of return. Wheat prices are projected to be recovering and stable,\nafter experiencing a 15 percent decline over the last year. In constant 2000 terms, the World\nBank\u2019s commodity price projections (January 2000) show that American wheat prices2 are\nexpected to reach $115/t in 2000, $134/t in year 2005, and $126/t in year 2010. When a further\nprice decline of 10 percent is applied across these projections, the FIRRs of the 4,000 ha and\n10,000 ha farms are reduced to 20.2 percent and 20.3 percent, respectively. Nevertheless, the\nEIRRs remain attractive at 31.3 percent for the 4,000 ha farm, and 31.1 percent for the 10,000\nha farms.\n25. In an unlikely event, when projected yields are reduced by 10 percent throughout the 10-\nyear period, the FIRRs of these farms are reduced to 5.1 percent (4,000 ha) and 4.1 percent\n(10,000 ha), although the respective EIRRs remain attractive at 16.8 percent for the 4,000 ha\nfarm and 16.0 percent for the 10,000 ha farm. Such reductions in yields are highly unlikely if\nfertilizers and agrochemicals are applied to the crops of arable farms in zones III and IV.\n26. The viability of the farm very much depends on the overall financial and commercial\nviability of the restructuring initiatives. Switching values, for rates of return not to fall below 12\n                                                          \n1 The ratio of net income (excluding depreciation, noncash charges, interest, and other charges on debt) against\ndebt service (including long-term loan principal repayments and interest charges on all debts).\n2 US No. 1 hard red winter wheat, free-on-board basis, US Gulf Port.", "81 Appendix 10, page 7\npercent,  are  presented  in  Table  A10.2.  Although  there  is  room  for  absorbing  unfavorable\nimpacts,  these  results  show  that  farm  restructuring  requires  astute  financial  management,\nbusiness planning, and farm management. While FIRRs on investments may show to be above\nthe cost of capital, the level of loan financing and its repayment schedules should be evaluated\nto match the overall earning capacity and projected cash flows of the farms.\n27. The FIRRs of these farms are sensitive to decreases in benefits. In the event benefits\nare reduced by 7-8 percent across all projected years, the FIRRs fall to 12 percent, a level\nassumed to be the opportunity cost of capital. Similarly, the FIRRs are also sensitive to overall\nincreases in operating costs. The FIRRs would again fall to 12 percent when operating costs\nrise  by  about  10-11  percent.  However,  the  FIRRs  are  less  sensitive  to  increases  in  the\ninvestment costs. The FIRR of the cattle fattening model is sensitive to increases in operating\ncosts. A 9 percent increase in the operating costs (with the Project) would reduce the FIRR of\nthe cattle fattening farm to 12 percent.\n28. In the case of the flour mill, the base FIRR is moderately robust to declines in output and\nprices of wheat grains and wheat flour, and to increases in investment and operating costs.\nTable A10.1 shows that the FIRR is reduced to 29.9 percent when output declines by 10\npercent,  and  to  27.8  percent  when  prices  of  wheat  grains  and  wheat  flour  decline\nsimultaneously by 10 percent.  For the FIRR to fall to 12 percent, the investment costs must rise\nby 107 percent or the operating costs must increase by 64.3 percent. The FIRR is sensitive to\nprice fluctuations of wheat flour when prices of wheat grains remain constant. Although this\nscenario is unlikely, the FIRR is reduced to 12 percent when benefits decline by 7.0 percent, a\ncase when flour prices alone decline by 7.0 percent without a similar drop in the price of wheat\ngrains. Similarly, the EIRR falls to 31.1 percent when output declines by 10 percent, and to 28.3\npercent when wheat grain and wheat flour prices simultaneously drop by 10 percent. The EIRR\nis reduced to 12 percent when (i) investment costs rise by 114 percent; (ii) operating costs\nincrease by 56.0 percent; or (iii) benefits drop by 6.6 percent.

The sensitivity of the FIRRs to depreciation of the local currency equivalent to the US\ndollar was tested (Table A10.3). In the event the tenge experiences a further 20 percent\ndepreciation, from T144.00/$1 to T188.00/$1, the FIRRs are expected to rise to 47.8 percent\n(4,000 ha), 43.4 percent (10,000 ha), 45.8 percent (cattle fattening), and 38.8 percent (flour\nmill). Depreciation of the tenge would cause prices of tradable inputs (equipment) and outputs\n(grains and sunflower) in tenge to rise to maintain their dollar equivalents, while prices in tenge\nof nontradable inputs would lag behind. Nontradable inputs and outputs are estimated to have\n50 percent foreign content, while transport costs have up to 80 percent foreign content.

Poverty impact assessment was conducted for the major groups of program measures,\nincluding (i) information provision; (ii) refinement of legislation on farm accounting, auditing,\nbankruptcy,  and  mortgage;  (iii)  more  effective  cost  recovery  in  public  irrigation;  and  (iv)\nencouragement  of  small-scale  rural  employment  and  the  formation  of  voluntary  rural\nassociations.\nB. Measures to Improve Information and Knowledge about Agriculture\n2. Measures  under  this  category  will  (i)  strengthen  sector  monitoring,  analysis,  and\ninformation provision by the Ministry of Agriculture; (ii) improve the legal framework for land\nownership;  and  (ii)  promote,  through  a  nationwide  public  information  campaign,  more\nwidespread understanding of the current legislation and policy framework for agriculture.\nMedium-Term/\nChannel Short-Run/Direct Indirect Macro Nonpoor\nDemand for No immediate Positive insofar as\nUnskilled impacts of the market improved market\nLabor information system information\nare expected, since it contributes to the\nwill take time for adoption of higher-\nusers to gain valued, more labor-\nfamiliarity with the intensive\nsystem.

The\nproposed technical assistance (TA) for Deepening of Agricultural Reforms and Development\nPrograms will assist the Government in the design, implementation, and evaluation of the\ncampaign, and in the development of farm technology messages, which can be delivered in\nEast Kazakhstan and agroclimatically similar regions.\nNet Impact Positive and negative impacts balance one another. The pro-poor impact of the information\ncampaign would be enhanced by a focus on the needs of relatively disadvantaged rural\ngroups, e.g., farms and rural communities in marginal agroclimatic zones, and by widening the\nscope of the campaign\u2019s messages to cover topics such as microenterprise development and\nnonfarm employment opportunities.\nNarrative Improved information and knowledge about the legal and policy framework for agriculture is\nexpected to contribute to (i) consolidation of land- holdings, farm shares, and land tenure and\nownership rights into legally sound farm structures; (ii) greater demand for commercial credit\nbased on pledging of property; (iii) greater use of bankruptcy as a tool for farm restructuring;\n(iv) formation of cooperatives and voluntary organizations; and (v) greater willingness by farm\ncommunities and small businesses to resist extralegal interventions in their affairs by local\nadministrations. Improved market information should contribute to greater responsiveness to\nprice signals and diversification of farming based on comparative advantage.\nC. Refinement and More Effective Implementation of Legislation on Farm Accounts,\nBankruptcy, Mortgage, and Taxation\n3. These  measures  will  involve  (i)  application  of  international  accounting  and  auditing\nstandards to farms and agribusinesses that are legal entities; (ii) improved effectiveness of\nlegislation on agricultural bankruptcy, pledging of property, and taxation; and (iii) expanded\nimplementation of the system for registering rights to land and other immovable property.\nMedium-Term/\nChannel Short-Run/Direct Indirect Macro Nonpoor\nDemand for Small impacts in the Improved\nUnskilled short run because the bankruptcy\nLabor implementation of measures will\nlaws tends to be slow, accelerate farm\nespecially in remote restructuring and\nregions debt resolution,\nwhich will accelerate", "86 Appendix 11, page 3\nMedium-Term/\nChannel Short-Run/Direct Indirect Macro Nonpoor\nthe long-run exit of\nlabor from farming.\nThe decrease in\nlabor demand on\nnonviable farms will\nbe partially offset by\nincreased demand\non successful farms\nthat are more\nattractive to\ncommercial lenders.\nPrices Unlikely to have Over time, the\nsignificant short-run measures will\nimpacts contribute to more\nefficient farm\noperation, greater\naccess to credit, and\nhigher productivity,\nall leading to more\nstable prices of\nagricultural products.\nThe costs of farm\nborrowing should be\nlower because of\nincreased bank\nconfidence in\nlending to farms.\nAccess for There will be more Budgetary revenues\nPoor transparent financial may grow as the\nreporting by corporate result of improved\nfarm managers to farm accounting and\nshareholders.

The measures will (i) reduce extralegal interventions by local administrations in the\nactivities of farms and small businesses; (ii) improve legislation governing the formation of\ncooperatives and other voluntary associations; and (iii) establish a sound legal framework for\nthe transfer of irrigation and drainage systems to water user associations (WUAs).\nMedium-Term\nChannel Short-Run/Direct Indirect Macro Nonpoor\nDemand for These measures will Private investment\nUnskilled directly promote the and formation of\nLabor establishment of cooperatives and\nsmall businesses that WUAs will\ntend to use labor- encourage labor\nintensive demand in\ntechnologies. agroprocessing and\nmarketing, as well\nas in irrigated\nfarming and\nprivatized operation\nand maintenance\n(O&M).

However, the social capital for these activities was\nnot developed during the Soviet period, when production and marketing decisions were\nmade centrally. Although Kazakhstan\u2019s Civil Code presents few legal barriers to private\nbusiness initiative and the formation of cooperatives, additional explicit legislative support is\nwarranted. Similarly, explicit support for the formation and functioning of WUAs is urgently\nneeded to arrest the deterioration of water resources infrastructure that accompanied the\nbreakup of the state farms and the breakdown of O&M services provided under the\ncommand economy.\na Approved by the Board on 17 December 1997, for $600,000, together with Loans 1592/1593-KAZ: Water\nResources Management and Land Improvement Project, for $40 million.\nE.

The principal measures will (i) improve procedures for collection of water fees and\nrelated user charges; (ii) establish procedures for annual allocation of such fees between oblast\nadministrations and the national Government to finance the costs of O&M of drainage and\nirrigation infrastructure; and (iii) institutionalize explicit routine national budgeting for O&M in\nbalance with the revenues generated by water fees.", "89 Appendix 11, page 6\nMedium-Term\nChannel Short-Run/Direct Indirect Macro Nonpoor\nDemand for Over time, improved No significant\nUnskilled financing of O&M will impacts expected.\nLabor lead to more reliable However, it should\nirrigation and be noted that the\ndrainage services, measures will affect\nlower salinity and O&M funding in\nwaterlogging, and irrigated agricultural\nimproved farm regions, which are\nproductivity, acting relatively non-poor\nto increase labor use compared with the\non irrigated farms of rain-fed regions.\nall sizes.\nPrices\nAccess for Modestly negative if\nPoor there is any\nreduction in public\nexpenditures for\ntransfers to the poor\nTransfers The measures will Same as the short- Same as short-run No significant\nmore explicitly link run effects and medium-term impacts expected,\nO&M budgets with effects but, viewed\nrevenues presently nationally, the net\nbeing generated from effect of more\nwater fees.

Full recovery of the economic costs of water, which\nwould include the environmental costs of water diverted from the Aral Sea, would entail a\nvery substantial increase in the water fee in some regions of Kazakhstan, but it is assumed\nthat the feasibility of such a cost increase is remote during the medium term.\nNet Impact Neutral to modestly positive. In the long run, the productivity-enhancing impacts of improved\nirrigation and drainage services are assumed to have benefits for the poor, which may be\ncounterbalanced by a slight reduction in public provision of other public services to the poor.\nNarrative In August 1997, the Government issued a regulation on the calculation and collection of fees\nfor surface water. This was intended to be the first step toward a long-term policy of full\nrecovery of the investment and O&M costs of irrigation infrastructure. So far, the water fees\nhave been used as a source of general revenue by oblast administrations rather than being\ndevoted to O&M, which continues to suffer from lack of funding.
