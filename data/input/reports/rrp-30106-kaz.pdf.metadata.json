Technical assistance (TA),\nDeepening  of  Agricultural  Reforms  and  Development\nPrograms, will be provided on approval of the proposal.\n\nKazakhstan\u2019s transitional agriculture sector has reached a\nturning  point.  Major  market  reforms  have  been  adopted,\nbut  many  farms,  although  privatized,  have  yet  to  adopt\nfinancially  viable  management  structures  and  operations\nsuited to a market economy. The banking system provides\nlimited  lending  to  farms.  The  farms  use  minimal  inputs\nacquired  largely  by  barter,  grow  largely  traditional,  low-\nvalued  crops,  and  maintain  excessive  social  obligations.\nAs  a  result,  they  are  not  financially  profitable.  To  achieve\nthe profitability that Kazakhstan\u2019s soils and climate permit,\na  two-pronged  approach  is  required  involving  (i)  advisory\nand  financial  support  to  farms  and  rural  communities\nundergoing  restructuring,  and  (ii)  refinement  and  more\neffective implementation of the policy and legal framework\nfor  agriculture.  The  proposed  Sector  Development\nProgram  (SDP)  will  integrate  (i)  a  project  component  to\ndirectly  support  farm  restructuring  in  East  Kazakhstan\noblast;  and  (ii)  a  policy  component  to  accelerate  the\nGovernment\u2019s  ongoing  efforts  to  strengthen  the  policy,\nlegal,  and \nfarm\nrestructuring  and  commercial  lending  to  agriculture,  with\nthe specific objective of creating a suitable environment for\nimplementation of farm restructuring.\n\nframework  underlying \n\nregulatory \n\nClassification\n\nEconomic growth\n\nEnvironmental Assessment\n\nCategory B\nAn  initial  environmental  examination  was  prepared  and  a\nsummary of the results is presented as an appendix.\n\nThe Sector Development Program\n\nObjective and Scope\n\ninstitutional  development,  and \nfinancially  sustainable \n\nThe  objective  of  the  SDP  is  to  promote  agricultural\nrecovery and rural growth through a combination of policy\nto\nreform, \nfarm  enterprises  and\ndevelop \nagribusinesses,  and  reestablish  and/or  expand  nonfarm\nemployment.  The  policy  reforms  will  be  nationwide  in\ninvestment\ninstitutional  development  and \nscope,  but \nactivities will focus on East Kazakhstan oblast.\n\ninvestment \n\n\fPolicy Framework and\nActions\n\nCapacity Building\n\nThe Investment Project\n\niii\n\nreforms  have \n\nWith  prior  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  support,1  the\nmajor  market-oriented \nlargely  been\nin  Kazakhstan\u2019s  agriculture  sector.  The\ncompleted \nproposed policy component will support the Government\u2019s\ninitiatives to deepen, refine, and more effectively apply the\npolicy  and  legislative  measures  already  undertaken,  with\nthe  specific  objective  of  promoting  effective \nfarm\nrestructuring and viable commercial lending to agriculture.\nThe  SDP's  policy  support  measures  will  (i)  strengthen\nsector monitoring, analysis, and programming; (ii) promote\ntransparent  farm  management  and  secured  lending  to\nagriculture; \nthe  understanding  and\neffectiveness  of  legislation  on,  among  others,  land  and\nfarm  ownership,  accounting,  auditing,  bankruptcy,  and\nmortgages;  (iv)  promote  efficient  agricultural  taxation  and\nuse  of  water  fees;  (v)  facilitate  local  private  initiatives  and\nthe  formation  of  voluntary  rural  associations;  (vi)  promote\nefficient  pricing  of  agricultural  inputs;  and  (vii)  encourage\nprivate investment in agriculture.\n\nimprove \n\n(iii) \n\nKazakhstan\u2019s  transition  to  a  market  economy  requires  a\nmuch  deeper  understanding  of  economics,  finance,  and\ncommercial law than exists at present. A wide range of on-\nthe-job and formal training will be provided to develop the\nnecessary  skill  levels  as  quickly  as  possible.  Training\nto  all  beneficiaries,\nopportunities  will  be  provided \ncommercial  bank  staff,  and \nthe  numerous  public\ninstitutions \nthe  complex  process  of\nrestructuring farms and regenerating rural economies.\n\ninvolved \n\nin \n\nThe  Project  comprises \nthree  basic  components:\ninstitutional  development,  training,  and  credit.  Activities\ninclude the following:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\nA rural advisory unit (RAU) will be established in East\nKazakhstan  oblast  to  provide  advice  and  formal\ntraining  on  the  legal  and  financial  aspects  of  farm\nrestructuring  and  business  management  in  a  market\neconomy.\nThe  process  of  farm  restructuring  will  involve  a\nthe  social\nin  direct  employment  and \nreduction \nobligations borne by the larger farm enterprises. The\nRAU,  working \nlocal\nnongovernment  organizations,  will  support  skills\ntraining  and  the  expansion  of  rural  employment  in\nnonfarm microenterprises.\n\ncooperation  with \n\nin \n\n                                                \n1  Under  Loan  1406-KAZ:  Agriculture Sector Program,  for  $100  million,  approved  on  23  November  1995.  The\n\nProgram was implemented satisfactorily and the second tranche was released in June 1997.\n\n\fiv\n\n(iii)  Farms,  agribusinesses,  and  microenterprises  that\ndemonstrate  a  commitment  to  sound  management\nwill  be  eligible  to  apply  for  credit  at  market  rates  for\nworking  capital  and  longer  term  investment  through\nlocal commercial banks.\n\n(iv) Training  and  capacity  building  in  commercial  banks,\nlocal  public  agencies,  East  Kazakhstan\u2019s  agricultural\nresearch  and  educational \ninstitutions  will  be\nsupported,  and  an  implementation  unit  established\nwithin the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA).\n\nThe  marked  increase  in  rural  poverty  in  Kazakhstan  can\nonly be arrested by a combination of profitable farms, well-\nmanaged  support  services,  and  growth  of  off-farm\nemployment.  The  policy  component  and  the  investment\nProject  provide  specific  interventions  to  mitigate  the\nundesirable  social  impacts  of  farm  restructuring.  The\nProject\u2019s microenterprise component is directly targeted at\nthe  rural  communities  and  social  groups  likely  to  lose\ndirect farm employment as the result of farm restructuring.\nThe  policy  support  measures  will  reinforce  the  project\ninterventions by providing information to rural communities\nabout their rights, obligations, and opportunities, as well as\nstrengthen  the  legal  and  institutional  framework  for  land\nand  farm  ownership,  rural  small  business  development,\nand the formation of voluntary rural associations.\n\nThe  Project\u2019s  net  environmental  impacts  will  be  positive,\nprincipally  by  (i)  removing  marginal  land  from  agricultural\nuse  (ii)  reducing  the  cultivation  of  sloping  land,  and  (iii)\nusing  more  diversified  cropping  patterns  that  improve  soil\nfertility.  With  support  from  the  RAU,  the  responsible\n(i)  ensure  subborrower\nGovernment  agencies  will \ncompliance  with  all  applicable  environmental  assessment\nand  mitigation  requirements,  and  (ii)  monitor  relevant\nenvironmental  parameters  such  as  agrochemical  use  and\nsoil/water effluents.\n\nThe proposed $25 million loan from ADB's ordinary capital\nresources  will  have  a  term  of  15  years,  including  a  grace\nperiod  of  3  years,  with  interest  calculated  in  accordance\nwith ADB\u2019s pool-based variable lending rate system for US\ndollar loans, and a commitment charge of 0.75 percent per\nannum  on  the  undisbursed  portion  of  the  loan.  The\nGovernment  will  pay  ADB  a  front-end  fee  equal  to  1\npercent of the loan. The fee will be capitalized in the loan.\n\nSocial and Environmental\nMeasures\n\nThe Policy Loan\n\nLoan Amount and Terms\n\nProgram Period and \nTranching\n\nThe policy component will be implemented over two years\nfrom  30  November  2000  to  30  November  2002.

ADB  will\nhave the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to\nverify the accuracy of the Government's certification.\n\nThe local currency proceeds to be generated from the loan\nwill be used by the Government to finance (i) the costs of\nimplementing  the  SDP\u2019s  policy  reforms;  and  (ii)  the  local\ncounterpart costs of high-priority development projects and\nTA in the agriculture sector, particularly those financed by\nADB.\n\nThe  proposed  loan  of  $20  million  from  ADB's  ordinary\ncapital resources will have a term of 25 years, including a\nin\ngrace  period  of  5  years,  with \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  pool-based  variable  lending  rate\nsystem  for  US  dollar  loans,  and  an  annual  commitment\ncharge  of  0.75  percent.

Consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.\n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  five  years  with\ncompletion expected on or about 31 November 2005.\n\nOver five years, the Project will restore crop and livestock\nproductivity to competitive levels on a core group of farms\ncovering some 400,000 hectares. The Project will support\nthe  development  of  agroprocessing  enterprises  and\npromote  nonfarm  microenterprise  employment  to  stabilize\nincomes  in  communities  affected  by  farm  restructuring.\nFinancial  internal  rates  of  return  for  indicative  farm  and\nagribusiness  restructuring  and  investment  initiatives  are\nestimated  to  be  between  33  and  38  percent,  while\neconomic returns range from 36 to 48 percent.\n\nThe TA grant of $800,000 will serve two distinct purposes:\n(i)  facilitate  SDP  implementation  by  assisting  MOA  and\nother  concerned  agencies  in  evaluating  and  refining\nagricultural  policies  and  legislation;  and  (ii)  support  the\nProject  by  developing  a  program  of  applied  agricultural\nresearch  and  technology  dissemination,  focusing  on  East\nKazakhstan.  The  TA  will  be  financed  by  ADB  from  the\nJapan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan.\n\nGiven  Kazakhstan\u2019s  institutional  transition  and  frequent\nchanges  in  key  Government  personnel,  the  SDP\u2019s  major\nrisk  is  that  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  full  program\nimplementation falters. However, the reforms supported by\nthe SDP build directly on the constraints identified in farm\nand  rural  community  consultations,  as  well  as  the  sector\nanalyses  and  medium-term  strategic  agenda  prepared  by\nMOA  and  other  agencies.  Stakeholders\u2019  support  for  the\nreforms  is  expected  to  continue.  Kazakhstan\u2019s  budgetary\nconstraints and some uncertainty in the exchange rate and\n\n\fvii\n\nfinancial sector are likely to persist for at least the next one\nor  two  years.  These  circumstances  lead  to  risks  of\ncounterpart funding shortfalls, as well as to greater caution\namong  commercial  banks  in  lending  to  agriculture.  The\nGovernment has initiated endeavors to improve the public\nexpenditure  program.  The  policy  component  of  the  SDP\nhas  been  designed  to  encourage  greater  commercial\nlending  to  agriculture  by  leveling  the  playing  field  for  the\nbanks  in  respect  of  the  legal  framework  for  secured\nlending, \nliquidation,  and\nbankruptcy.  The  investment  Project  faces  a  number  of\nrisks for which safeguards have been built into the Project\nto minimize the risks. These risks mainly involve the timely\ndevelopment  of  business  skills  suited  to  the  needs  of  a\nrural  market  economy,  the  adoption  of  improved  crop\ntechnology, and the development of credit discipline.\n\nfarm  accounting/auditing, \n\n\fviii\n\n\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL\n\n1.\nI submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on two proposed\nloans to the Republic of Kazakhstan for the Farm Restructuring Sector Development Program\n(SDP).  The  report  also  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Deepening  of\nAgricultural  Reforms  and  Development  Programs,  and  if  the  proposed  loans  are  approved  by\nthe Board, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, shall approve the TA.\n\nII.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nDuring \n\nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Country  Programming  Mission \n\n2.\nto\nKazakhstan in 1996, the Government requested TA to prepare a project to help farmers adapt\nto  the  postprivatization  environment.  The  Farm  Restructuring  and  Development  TA1  was\nconducted  in  two  phases  during  May  1997\u2013January  1998.  The  first  phase  (i)  reviewed  the\nperformance  of  the  agriculture  sector;  (ii)  assessed  Kazakhstan's  comparative  advantage  in\nselected  agricultural  commodities;  (iii)  confirmed  the  need  to  establish  advisory  services  for\nprivatized  farms  and  rural  enterprises,  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  commercial  banks,  and\nimprove the accessibility of working and investment capital for farmers who are adapting to the\npostprivatization  environment;  and  (iv)  developed  criteria  for  the  selection  of  regions  (oblasts)\nsuitable  for  a  project  that  would  respond  to  these  needs.  During  the  TA's  second  phase,\ndetailed  preparation  of  a  farm  restructuring  project  was  conducted  in  East  Kazakhstan  oblast.\nThe TA's extensive consultations with farmers, rural communities, and Government agencies at\nthe  local  and  national  levels  indicated  the  need  to  combine  project  financing  with  additional\nsupport  for  the  refinement  of  the  policy  and  legal  framework  underlying  farm  privatization  and\nrestructuring.  The  Appraisal  Mission  visited  the  project  area  during  May-June  1999.2  The  main\nfindings  of  the  Appraisal  Mission  were  updated  in  June  2000.  This  report  is  based  on  the\nconsultants'  studies;  the  findings  of  the  missions;  and  discussions  with  the  national  and  local\ngovernment agencies, the potential participating banks, and farmers in the project area.\n\nA.\n\nMacroeconomic Context\n\nIII.\n\nTHE SECTOR\n\n3.\nRecent  economic  and  social  trends  in  Kazakhstan  have  underscored  the  need  to\naccelerate growth by diversifying the mix of productive activities, employment, and trade. Five\ndifficult  years  of  macroeconomic  disarray  followed  Kazakhstan\u2019s  separation  from  the  former\nSoviet Union (FSU) in 1991. Gross domestic product (GDP) declined by about 50 percent, then\nbegan  stabilizing  in  1995.  The  hyperinflation of 1992-1994 was reduced to about 17 percent in\n1997 and to about 2 percent in 1998. GDP grew positively, albeit modestly, at about 1.5 percent\nannually  during  1996-1997,  but  in  1998,  the  economy  contracted  by  2.5  percent  due  to  the\ncombined  effects  of  lower  international  prices  for  Kazakhstan\u2019s  primary  exports  (oil,  copper,\nzinc, and grain); the economic crisis in the Russian Federation,3 which accounts for 46 percent\nof Kazakhstan\u2019s trade; and the ongoing East Asian recession. GDP grew by about 1.7 percent\nin  1999,  and  is  expected  to  grow  by  7  percent  in  2000,  spurred  by  higher  world  commodity\n\n                                                \n1  TA 2737-KAZ: Farm Restructuring and Development Project, for $1.2 million, approved on 31 December 1996.\n2  The  Appraisal  Mission  comprised  F.  Roche,    Senior  Project  Economist  and  Mission  Leader;  H.  Wang,  Senior\nEconomist and Resident Representative, Kazakhstan Resident Mission; N. Bestari, Project Economist; O. Tiwana,\nCounsel; L. Wu, Economist; and R. Gaynor, Legal Specialist and Staff Consultant. The report was updated by F.\nRoche, N. Bestari, and P. Kamayana, Programs Officer.\n\n3  For  details,  see  IN.289.98:  The Impact of the Russian Economic Crisis on the Central Asian Republics,  9\n\nDecember 1998.\n\n\f2\n\nprices  and  a  significant  increase  in  industrial  production.  Nonetheless,  despite  this  growth,\nKazakhstan\u2019s GDP will remain at about two thirds of its 1989 level.\n\nin \n\nThe  upsurge \n\nindustrial  production \n\n4.\nis  encouraging,  because  Kazakhstan\u2019s\nmacroeconomic  performance  during  the  last  three  years  illustrates  how  the  narrow  productive\nbase\u2014energy,  minerals,  grain,  and  construction\u2014and  continued  interdependence  with  FSU\ncountries  make  the  economy  vulnerable  to  external  shocks.  In  April  1999,  in  the  face  of\ndeclining competitiveness because of exchange rate depreciation in neighboring countries, the\nNational  Bank  of  Kazakhstan  (NBK)  ceased  its  managed  float  of  the  tenge,  leading  to  a\ndevaluation  of  33  percent  and  consequent  inflationary  pressure.  Inflation  was  estimated  to  be\nabout 18 percent in 1999, but should be much lower in 2000. Since late 1999, the tenge-dollar\nexchange rate has been stable.\n\n5.\nAlthough the signs are positive, Kazakhstan\u2019s macroeconomic recovery is fragile. Since\nindependence,  the  Government  has  been  committed  to  a  sound  stabilization  framework  and\nmarket-oriented  reforms  in  the  policies,  laws,  and  institutions  regulating  the  economy.  This\ncommitment  was  reconfirmed  in  December  1999,  when  the  Government  and  the  International\nMonetary Fund agreed on economic guidelines for the next three years. The guidelines focus on\nprudent  monetary  policy,  consolidation  of  public  finances,  and  continued  structural  reform.\nGreater  foreign  investment  to  expand  the  industrial  base  is  being  actively  encouraged.  These\nefforts must be broadened to other sectors if growth is to accelerate and be more broadly felt.\nFiscal constraints will severely limit the level of direct public investment during the medium term.\nThe  Government  is  committed  to  ensuring  high  efficiency  and  cost  recovery  in  its  investments,\nwhich, in turn, necessitates a high degree of beneficiary participation and ownership.\n\n1.\n\nSocial Issues\n\n6.\nThe major social issues in Kazakhstan directly reflect the impacts of the macroeconomic\ndisarray. Real wages fell precipitously as a result of hyperinflation during 1992-1994; the decline\nwas  exacerbated  by  delayed  wage  payments  in  many  sectors,  including  agriculture.  Formal\nemployment declined by 30 percent between 1994 and 1997, although this was offset to some\ndegree by growing economic activity in the private sector, which Kazakhstan\u2019s statistical system\ndoes not yet fully capture. As the command economy collapsed and many industries (including\nagriculture)  were  privatized,  Kazakhstan\u2019s  formerly  well-developed  social  services  and  safety\nnets went into a steep decline. The problem of pensions has received the highest attention of\nthe Government; ADB4 and the World Bank have supported pension system reform. Health care\nand  education  services  provided  directly  by  state  enterprises  under  the  command  economy\nwere  transferred  to  local  governments,  which  typically  have  inadequate  financial  resources  to\nbear the responsibility.\n\nAccording  to  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme,  about  43  percent  of  the\n7.\npopulation  lived  in  poverty  in  1998,  reflecting  a  sharp  rise  since  1992.  As  measured  by\nmonetary income, the incidence of poverty is 48 percent in rural areas and 39 percent in urban\nareas.5  At  the  same  time,  rural  households  almost  universally  own  small  plots  that  are\nintensively cultivated, while farm shareholders also usually have access to grain and livestock\nfeed.  Together,  these  resources  provide  a  degree  of  food  security  that  the  urban  poor  do  not\nenjoy.  However,  rural  households  are  at  a  distinct  disadvantage  in  terms  of  access  to  health\n\n                                                \n4  Under Loan 1589-KAZ: Pension Reform Program,  for $100 million, approved on 16 December 1997.\n5  United  Nations  Development  Programme.  1999.

Kazakhstan\u2019s economic transition\nhas been accompanied by increasing inequality of income. The share of income received by the\nlowest three quintiles of the population fell by 19 percent between 1989 and 1997, a decline that\nwas almost exactly counterbalanced by the 21 percent increase in the share of the top quintile.\nRegionally, the incidence of poverty is far higher in the southern and eastern oblasts than in the\nfar north and west.\n\n2.\n\nIncidence of Poverty\n\n8.\nThe  existence  of  poverty  was  never  officially  acknowledged  by  the  FSU,  which,  in  any\nevent,  had  well-established  safety  nets  in  place.  Thus,  in  response  to  the  postindependence\nsocial  trends,  the  Government  has  had  to  develop  the  capacity  to  monitor  poverty  among\nvulnerable  groups,  including  the  unemployed,  households  with  many  dependent  children,\npensioners,  and  invalids.  The  Government\u2019s  strategy  for  poverty  reduction  focuses  on\nemployment  generation,  supplemented  by  programs  providing  monthly  cash  allowances  to\npeople who are unable to work. In 1998, a presidential decree established the National Fund for\nSupport  of  Low-Income  Citizens  to  provide  subsidized  microcredits  of  up  to  $400  equivalent  for\nsmall, largely rural, enterprises. In the same year, the Agency in Support of Small Business was\ncreated to support small-scale, private entrepreneurial initiatives. However, in 1999, financing for\nthese  programs  was  severely  curtailed  by  the  growing  budgetary  crisis.  Technical  and  other\nadvisory  services  to  encourage  employment-generating  activities  remain  scarce,  while  the\nlegislative basis for pro-poor activities such as voluntary cooperative organizations needs to be\nstrengthened.\n\nIn  April  2000,  the  ministries  of  economy,  and  labor  and  social  protection  drafted  the\n9.\nNational  Program  for  Fighting  Poverty  and  Unemployment  2000-2002.  ADB  and  the  United\nNations  Development  Programme  provided  short-term  consulting  services  to  assist  the\nGovernment  to  formulate  this  program,  which  has  the  specific  objective  of  reducing\nunemployment from 13 percent to 9 percent over three years. The Government estimates that\naccomplishing this goal will require resources equivalent to 0.8 percent of GDP in 2000 and 1\npercent  in  2001  and  2002.  However,  the  program  does  not  address  many  aspects  of  poverty\nthat  are  not  income-based.  Nor  was  the  program  discussed  widely  enough  to  gain  strong\nstakeholder  ownership,  including  by  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  and  the  private\nsector, to support its effective implementation. In its most recent country assistance plan, ADB\ncommitted  to  participating  fully  with  the  Government  in  its  poverty  reduction  efforts,  including\nprovision of TA in 2000 to assist the Government in preparing a more comprehensive medium-\nterm poverty reduction strategy. The strategy will consider the full range of human, income, and\ngovernance  dimensions  of  poverty  in  Kazakhstan.  The  strategy  will  be  prepared  in  a  manner\nthat  ensures  strong  stakeholder  ownership  and  will  be  implemented  during  2003-2010.  Based\non the strategy, ADB's operational strategy for future assistance to Kazakhstan, with a principal\nfocus on poverty reduction, will also be updated in 2001.\n\nB.\n\nSector Description and Recent Performance\n\nAgriculture presently accounts for about 10 percent of GDP, 14 percent of employment,\n10.\nand  10  percent  of  export  earnings.  Kazakhstan's  rural  areas  are  home  to  about  47  percent  of\nthe  country's  population  and  a  majority  of  the  poor.  Agriculture  encompasses  extensive  grain\nand livestock production primarily in the northern and central oblasts, and more intensive cotton\nand  cereal  production  in  irrigated  areas  of  the  south.  The  dry  continental  climate  and  short\ngrowing  season  generally  restrict  agriculture  to  a  single  crop  each  year.  Timely  and  judicious\nmanagement of soil, labor, and other farm resources are critical in all farming systems. The rain-\n\n\f4\n\nfed areas are cultivated under severe moisture constraints that limit productivity, increase risk,\nand by comparison with most ADB developing member countries, necessitate very large-scale,\ncapital-intensive farm operations.\n\nSince becoming independent of the FSU, the Government has, with ADB support under\n11.\nthe  Agriculture  Sector  Program  (ASP),6  initiated  major  policy,  legal,  and  institutional  reforms\nintended to accelerate the transition to a market economy. In the agriculture sector, almost all of\nthe  former  state-owned  farms  and  agribusinesses  have  been  privatized;  most  subsidies\neliminated,  together  with  direct  national  interventions  in  input  and  output  markets;  and  a  legal\nframework  for  market-led  growth  introduced.  The  progress  in  farm  privatization  has  been\ndramatic.  State  enterprises  now  account  for  less  than  10  percent  of  the  cultivated  area,\ncomprising  primarily  agricultural  research  institutes  and  agricultural  subsidiaries  of  state\nindustrial  enterprises.  Three  basic  types  of  private  farms  have  come  into  existence:  (i)\nproduction  cooperatives:  2,380  units  nationwide  as  of  April  1999,  averaging  14,000  hectares\n(ha) per farm; (ii) corporate partnerships and joint-stock companies: 2,790 units and averaging\n8,500  ha;  and  (iii)  the  relatively  small,  so-called  peasant  farms:  approximately  85,000  units\naveraging  450  ha.7  Overall,  it  is  estimated  that  production  cooperatives  occupy  about  43\npercent  of  the  cultivated  area,  partnerships  and  joint-stock  companies  about  30  percent,  and\npeasant  farms  about  16  percent.  While  the  large  farms  have  generally  retained  management\nand  operational  practices  similar  to  those  of  the  FSU  period,  the  peasant  farms  constitute  an\nentirely new class of independent units, created with shares of land and other assets redeemed\nfrom the former state farms.\n\n12.\nThe country\u2019s macroeconomic disequilibrium and the breakdown of formerly secure FSU\nmarkets  have  complicated  the  transformation  of  state  farms  into  viable  private  enterprises.  The\nelimination of subsidies initially contributed to a sharp decline of the agriculture sector's terms of\ntrade.  Cultivated  areas,  input  use,  wage  payments,  and  productivity  of  almost  all  crops  and\nlivestock declined sharply during the immediate postindependence years. Irrigation systems were\npoorly  maintained,  while  farm  machinery  and  other  capital  assets  depreciated  as  a  result  of\nphysical  deterioration  and  lack  of  spare  parts.  The  rural  financial  system,  originally  developed\nprimarily to direct subsidized credits to state farms, floundered as a result of accumulating arrears\nand  poor  management.  Social  services  formerly  provided  by  the  farms  deteriorated  because  of\nthe  contraction  of  farm  income  and  the  inability  of  the  national  (Republican)  and  local\ngovernments to fund these services through budgetary resources.\n\n13.\nBecause of the loss of FSU markets and the nascent entrepreneurial capacity of many of\nthe  newly  privatized  farmers,  competitive  forces  and  market-led  growth  have  emerged  slowly.\nAgronomic  and  economic  potential  for  diversification  exists  in  the  country\u2019s  better  endowed\nregions,  but  most  farms  continue  to  rely  on  a  narrow  range  of  crops  and  livestock  largely\nunchanged  since  the  FSU  period.  Inherent  agroclimatic  variability  affects  rain-fed  agriculture  in\nmost of Kazakhstan. Grain production, which accounts for about two thirds of agricultural output,\ndeclined by 28 percent between 1991 and 1995, but showed encouraging gains of 18 percent in\n1996  and  10  percent  in  1997  as  a  result  of  good  weather  and  improved  prices.  However,  in\n1998, drought, compounded by a sharp decline in international wheat prices, led to a 19 percent\ndrop  in  the  total  value  of  agricultural  output.  Grain  production  declined  by  about  30  percent,\n\n                                                \n6  Loan 1406-KAZ: Agriculture Sector Program, for $100 million, approved on 23 November 1995, was implemented\n\nsatisfactorily and the second tranche was released in June 1997.\n\n7 The average figures obscure the considerable regional heterogeneity of farm size associated with land productivity.\nPeasant farms as small as 10-15 ha are common in the irrigated areas of southern Kazakhstan, but peasant farms\ncan be as large as several thousand ha in the rain-fed, grain-producing regions, where the production cooperatives\nand other corporate entities may be as large as 80,000 ha.\n\n\f5\n\nwhile  the  livestock  economy,  most  noncereal  crops,  and  many  agroprocessing  industries\ncontinued to stagnate.8 Agriculture experienced a bumper year in 1999, despite serious locust\ndamage  in  some  localities.  Due  in  part  to  favorable  weather  during  the  growing  and  harvest\nperiods,  grain  production  more  than  doubled  as  compared  with  1998.  Equally  encouraging,\nprivate investment in agriculture, mainly in postharvest processing, has increased rapidly during\nthe past two years, albeit from a small base. However, these developments are now threatened\nby  a  growing  problem  with  locusts  that  reflects,  in  part,  a  decline  of  the  standard  of  farm\ncultivation practices and weaker public sector capacity to directly support agriculture.\n\n14.\nIf the sector\u2019s performance can be sustained, Kazakhstan can solidify its position as an\nefficient  agricultural  exporter.  During  the  medium  term,  there  will  be  growing  opportunities  to\nexport  competitive  grain,  livestock  products,  oilseeds,  and  commercial  crops  to  emerging\nmarkets  in  Central  Asia,  the  Middle  East,  and  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China.  However,  the\nagronomic  potential  varies  considerably  by  region,  generally  being  highest  in  the  southern\nirrigated  areas  and  in  the  northern  and  eastern  regions  where  there  are  relatively  fertile  soils\nand  reliable  rainfall.  In  Kazakhstan\u2019s  arid  steppes,  conditions  for  agriculture  are  marginal  and\nthe distance to markets is a formidable economic barrier. Many farms\u2014created by fiat under the\nFSU  rather  than  in  response  to  market  forces\u2014will  have  great  difficulty,  even  with  good\nmanagement,  in  becoming  financially  viable  in  a  market  economy.  Recognizing  this,  the\nGovernment has focused on measures to facilitate the transition and ease its social costs in its\nrecent strategy formulation for the agriculture sector. The Government also recognizes that the\nfirst, and comparatively easy, phase of legally privatizing farms is over, while a second and more\ncomplicated  phase  has  been  initiated  in  which  support  services  must  be  provided  to  directly\nencourage  the  establishment  of  truly  viable  farm  enterprises.  This  new  phase  will  require  the\nrefinement  of  policy  reforms  at  the  national  level,  and  equally  important,  the  more  effective\nunderstanding and application of policies and legislation at the oblast and district (raion) levels.\n\nC.\n\nConstraints and Issues\n\n15.\nDespite  the  reforms  and  signs  of  stabilization  in  grains,  the  problems  of  Kazakhstan's\nagriculture sector are reflected starkly in average output and incomes that are well below their\npotential,  the  limited  diversification  and  commercial  orientation,  and  the  precarious  financial\nposition  of  many  farms.  Overall,  the  sector  has  been  trapped  in  a  lingering  equilibrium  of  low\ninputs, low productivity, and low income, in which barter has become the predominant form of\nexchange. Privatization and market liberalization alone have not been sufficient to bring about\nrecovery and growth. Three major groups of constraints have been addressed in the design of\nthe Farm Restructuring SDP.\n\n1.\n\nInefficient Farm Management and Operations\n\nThere  is  an  emerging  core  of  relatively  well-managed  farms,  but  the  great  majority  of\n16.\nfarm  managers  and  shareholders  have  yet  to  adapt  their  farms  to  the  realities  of  a  market\neconomy. The essence of farm restructuring is to take the necessary steps to\n\n(i) \n\nadopt  clear,  stable,  and  legally  sound  ownership  structures  that  are  consistent\nwith Kazakhstan\u2019s laws;\n\n                                                \n8 As  a  result  of  unrecorded  production  and  sales,  particularly  among  the  smaller,  individually  managed  farms,\nagricultural  output  may  be  significantly  underestimated  in  official  statistics.  For  example,  the  Food  and  Agriculture\nOrganization concluded that cereal production was underestimated by about 26 percent in 1996.\n\n\f6\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nensure independent financial viability in the absence of subsidies by rationalizing\nfarm costs and shedding unprofitable activities;\nrespond  to  market  opportunities  by  adopting  more  diversified,  commercially\noriented farming systems; and\nparticularly  for  the  larger  corporate  farms,  form  a  medium-term  farm  (3-5  year)\nbusiness  development  plan  encompassing  debt \nimproved\nmanagement and cash flow; and new investment, primarily in machinery stock.\n\nresolution;9 \n\nEven on the best lands, many of Kazakhstan\u2019s large, corporately owned farms typically\n17.\nbear  an  unaffordable  burden  of  labor  and  social  obligations  held  over  from  the  command\neconomy era. The dilemma is that wage and social costs must often be reduced drastically if the\nfarms are to become financially viable, so attention must simultaneously be given to the creation\nof sustainable new employment for the redundant workforce.\n\n18.\nOccupying the largest share of the cultivated area, the country\u2019s production cooperatives\npresent the greatest challenge for future farm restructuring efforts. Despite being fully privatized,\nmost  of  these  farms  have  retained  essentially  unchanged  management  structures.  Originally\nconceived as a convenient vehicle for facilitating the initial transition from state ownership, the\nlegal framework underlying production cooperatives complicates their internal management and\nmakes  them  inherently  unstable  enterprises  that have great difficulty attracting commercial\ncredit  and  outside  investment.10  The  alternative  forms  of  corporate  farm  ownership\u2014limited\nliability partnerships and joint-stock companies\u2014have come about more recently and constitute\na  step  up  the  evolutionary  ladder  by  providing  a  clearer  and  more  flexible  legal  structure.\nHowever,  even  among  these  farms,  the  farming  systems  are  dominated  by  traditional  cereal\ncrops  and  livestock,  produced  with  minimal  inputs  for  markets  that  no  longer  exist.  This  even\noccurs  in  regions  where  soil  and  water  availability  would  permit  more  intensive,  diversified\nproduction.\n\nThe  individually  managed  peasant  farms  have  grown  rapidly  in  number  and  are\n19.\ngrappling  with  a  different  set  of  problems.  Peasant  farm  owners\u2014for  example,  former  tractor\ndrivers\u2014often  have  little  farm  management  experience;  unfortunately,  suitably  tailored\nextension  and  support  services  do  not  exist.  Owners  also  face  difficulties  because  the  basic\nrural facilities on which they depend\u2013-irrigation, roads, household utilities, and social services\u2014\nwere  designed  to  suit  the  needs  of  the  former  state  farms.  Because  of  their  small  scale,  they\nhave difficulty obtaining inputs and marketing outputs. The scope for assisting peasant farms is\nconsiderable and includes forming agricultural cooperatives and other voluntary associations for\nactivities such as credit, input provision, marketing, and irrigation management.\n\n20.\nOn  both  large  and  small-scale  farms,  farmers  typically  cite  the  lack  of  working  and\ninvestment capital, and the rapidly deteriorating condition of their farm equipment as the major\nconstraints to profitable operation. Fuel, agrochemicals, and machinery are available in markets,\nbut  the  financial  capacity  of  the  farms  to  purchase  these  inputs  is  extremely  limited,  and  at\n                                                \n9 As of April 1999, the aggregate outstanding debt of Kazakhstan\u2019s corporate farms was estimated by the Ministry of\nAgriculture  at  about  $800  million  equivalent,  or  approximately  $150,000  per  farm.  This  seemingly  onerous  figure\nworks  out  to  less  than  $10  per  ha  on  average.  It  should  readily  be  within  the  capacity  of  well-managed  farms  in\nKazakhstan\u2019s  better  endowed  areas  to  resolve  such  debt,  a  large  part  of  which  has  been  rescheduled  by\nGovernment  decrees.  Nonetheless,  there  is  considerable  variation  in  the  debt  burden  and  repayment  capacity\namong regions, which is contributing to the accelerated liquidation of nonviable farms in marginal areas.\n\n10 Kazakhstan\u2019s  law  requires  that  all  shareholders  in  a  production  cooperative  must  also  be  employed  on  the\ncooperative:  this  inhibits  outside  investment  by  nonshareholders.  Management  decisions  may  be  subject  to\nunpredictable  shareholder  votes,  while  the  land  and  assets  owned  are  subject  to  sudden  change  when\nshareholders opt to establish independent peasant farms.\n\n\f7\n\ntimes, complicated by the unresolved debts inherited from the former state farms.11 Few farms\npresently use fertilizer and other agrochemicals, and farm machinery and equipment has rarely\nbeen  replaced  during  the  past  several  years.  Assuring  the  necessary  timeliness  of  farm\noperations has become increasingly difficult.\n\n2.\n\nLimited Commercial Lending to Agriculture\n\n21.\nUnder the guidance of NBK, considerable progress has been made over the past three\nyears  in  strengthening  Kazakhstan\u2019s  financial  system.  In  1994,  there  were  more  than  200\ncommercial banks, composed of remnants of the former Soviet system and small, often family-\nmanaged start-up operations of dubious financial health. Through the strict application of NBK\u2019s\nprudential  requirements  and  a  guided  process  of  mergers  and  closures,  this  number  was\nreduced  to  102  in  late  1996  and  to  63  as  of  late  1999.  A  core  group  of  private  banks  now\noperates on market-based principles in Kazakhstan\u2019s second tier financial system.12\n\n22.\nHowever,  with  the  principal  exception  of  Kazagroprom  Bank,  the  former  state-owned\ninstitution  most  active  in  the  agriculture  sector,  the  commercial  banks  provide  little  credit  to\nfarms  at  present.  The  banks  are  cautious  about  lending  to  farms  and  agricultural  enterprises\nbecause  of  the  risks  arising  from  (i)  the  farms'  often  uncertain  ownership  structures  and\nmanagement  capacity;  (ii)  the  inherent  agroclimatic  and  biological  variability  of  agriculture;  (iii)\nthe incomplete legal framework for secured lending, bankruptcy, and debt resolution;13 and (iv)\nweak markets for land and other collateral assets.\n\n23.\nLoan amounts and terms are almost entirely determined by the collateral offered rather\nthan  the  projected  financial  performance  of  the  farms\u2019  proposed  investments.  Collateral\nrequirements\u2014ranging from 150 to 200 percent of the value of requested loans\u2014are difficult for\nfarms to meet, particularly since land and other immovable farm property are rarely accepted.\nAlthough most farmers presently possess certificates of long-term or permanent land use rights,\nthe slow development of a land market effectively reduces the level of bankable credit demand.\nCollateral  requirements  are  particularly  onerous  for  the  small  peasant  farmers  who  inherited\nland from the former state farms, but typically few other capital assets.\n\nAside  from  Kazagroprom,  the  agricultural  portfolios  of  the  major  commercial  banks  are\n24.\nlimited to short-term loans, largely to agribusiness and agroprocessing enterprises. Agricultural\nloans make up less than 5 percent of their total lending. Even Kazagroprom tightened its farm\ncredit  policy  in  the  face  of  the  macroeconomic  uncertainty  and  rising  loan  arrears  in  1999.\nBecause  of  the  perceived  risks  and  to  avoid  frequent  interference  by  oblast  and  raion\nadministrations  in  private  business  affairs,14  responsibility  for  credit  approval  in  the  regional\nbank branches now rests predominantly with headquarters in Almaty.\n\n                                                \n11 Given  the  scarcity  of  credit,  the  farms  have  resorted  to  a  variety  of  means  to  secure  fuel,  seed,  and  machinery\nservices.  The  most  common  arrangement  is  forward  contracting  of  a  crop  in  exchange  for  inputs,  often  at  low\nrealized crop prices. The smallest farms often finance seasonal production costs through the sale of livestock and\nother assets, and the largely informal sharing of farm machinery with neighbors and farms.\n\n12 These banks include TuranAlem Bank, Kazkommerts Bank, Halyk Savings Bank, and Centre Credit Bank.\n13 The Government has adopted legislation governing mortgage and pledging of property, but operational guidelines\nand procedures are not yet fully applied. Kazakhstan\u2019s bankruptcy law, passed originally in 1997 and amended in\n1998, gives considerable authority to public agencies in both instituting bankruptcy proceedings and administering\nthese proceedings, whether or not the Government is a major creditor.\n\n14 Interference in the affairs of private farms and rural businesses takes many forms, e.g., efforts to ensure local food\nsecurity  by  encouraging  the  planting  of  food  crops;  aggressive  tax  collection,  including  abrupt  seizure  of  bank\naccounts;  mediation  between  farms  and  creditors  in  regard  to  overdue  debts;  and  solicitation  of  voluntary\ncontributions from successful enterprises for local poverty reduction programs.\n\n\f8\n\nIn  the  eyes  of  commercial  bank  personnel,  farms  are  generally  perceived  as  poorly\n25.\nmanaged  and  largely  insolvent,  but  the  banks'  reluctance  to  lend  exacerbates  financial\ndifficulties faced by the farms. In turn, given the lack of commercial credit, farmers have come to\nfulfill  most  of  their  working  capital  requirements  through  barter  trade  and  forward  contracting\nwith  input  suppliers  and  commodity  traders.  The  opaque,  informal  nature  of  barter  trade\ncomplicates  the  assessment  of  the  financial  capacity  of  potential  borrowers  and  acts  as  a\ndisincentive for lending by the banks.15\n\nThe  uncertainty  associated  with  the  depreciation  of  the  tenge  led  the  banks  to\n26.\nincreasingly  resort  to  dollar-based  lending.  In  the  tight  monetary  environment  triggered  by\nKazakhstan\u2019s  financial  crisis  in  1999,  interest  rates  rose  to  14-18  percent  per  annum  in  dollar\nterms, reflecting the rising opportunity cost of funds for the banks.16 Currently, most lending is\nfor  short-term  working  capital  for  periods  no  greater  than  six  months  and  limited  largely  to\nestablished trading,  service, and manufacturing enterprises. Commercial bank personnel have\nserious  doubts  about  the  capacity  of  farms  and  rural  enterprises  to  service  dollar-equivalent\ndebts on these terms, especially given the significant foreign exchange risk that is borne by the\nborrowers. Overall, these conditions have significantly curtailed the demand for long-term loans.\nSince  many  farms  have  become  discouraged  about  their  prospects  for  obtaining  loans,  the\nvolume  of  loan  applications  currently  reported  by  the  banks  reflects  only  a  small  share  of  the\ndemand that exists.\n\n27.\nSimply augmenting the supply of funds for credit will not solve these problems. The risks\nof  lending  to  agriculture  are  a  more  fundamental  constraint  than  bank  liquidity;  Kazakhstan\u2019s\ncommercial  banks  have  limited  experience  in  critically  appraising  and  managing  agricultural\nloans in a market economy. Suitable training and capacity building in the rural financial sector\nare  necessary  to  encourage  banks  to  gradually  move  from  collateral-based  to  performance-\nbased  lending.  This  capacity  building  must  be  accompanied  by  support  to  establish  a  core\ngroup of successful farms that demonstrate that performance-based lending can be prudent and\nprofitable.\n\n3.\n\nLack of Understanding of Agriculture in a Market Economy\n\nFor farms, rural communities, banks, and rural public agencies, equitable rural growth is\n28.\nconstrained  by  lack  of  information  and  knowledge.  The  information  gap  encompasses  two\ndimensions: (i) lack of understanding\u2014among rural communities and local administrations\u2014of\nlegal  rights  and  opportunities,  and  (ii)  lack  of  knowledge  about  business  management  in  a\nmarket  economy.  Kazakhstan  now  has  a  reasonably  comprehensive  body  of  legislation  on\nmatters  such  as  land  and  property  rights,  farm  ownership,  taxation,  secured  lending,  and\nbankruptcy.  While  refinements  of  this  legislation  are  needed,  the  major  challenge  is  to  ensure\nthat the legal framework is correctly understood and applied at the local level. The process of\nprivatization  involved  little  or  no  provision  of  information  and  guidance  to  rural  communities\nabout  their  legal  options,  rights,  and  obligations.  During  1996  and  1997,  many  rural  families,\nencouraged  by  the  former  state  farm  managers,  and  often  by  oblast  and  raion  administrations,\ntransferred their shareholding rights to the farm managers in exchange for legally undocumented\n\n                                                \n15 Although  lending  to  farms  has  been  scaled  back,  the  banks  have  increased  their  lending  to  food  processing\nindustries,  which,  in  turn,  often  extend  seasonal  loans  to  farms  under  forward  contracts.  Although  no  data  are\navailable  on  the  extent  of  this  onlending,  these  arrangements  are  accepted  by  the  banks  because  the  risks  are\nborne by the processing enterprises.\n\n16 Short-term dollar-based deposit rates for up to 12 months also increased to 10-15 percent per annum in late 1999.\nIn tenge terms, the interest rates rose to 25-30 percent per annum by late 1999, and declined to 18-21 percent by\nJuly 2000.\n\n\f9\n\npromises  of  continued  employment,  dividends,  and  in-kind  services.  In  1997  and  1998,  the\nMinistry of Agriculture (MOA) organized oblast-level seminars to explain the new policy and legal\nframework for agriculture. But, in a country as vast as Kazakhstan, much greater effort is needed\nto ensure that the necessary information reaches the rural communities.\n\n29.\nThe pace and equity of the transition to a market economy will depend critically on the\ndepth  of  understanding  of  market  economics,  finance,  and  commercial  law  at  all  levels  of\nsociety.  Farm  restructuring  cannot  succeed  without  a  significant  upgrading  of  agribusiness\nmanagement skills to international standards. Farmers need new knowledge on subjects such\nas farm business planning and accounting; recent developments in markets; crop and livestock\nproduction  technology;  and  the  formation  of  voluntary,  cooperative  organizations.  At  present,\nthere  is  little  of  the  necessary  expertise  in  these  areas  at  the  local  level.  Competent  technical\nspecialists  are  often  available,  but  there  is  a  need  to  supplement  their  skills  with  knowledge\nabout recent advances in production technologies, as well as basic market economy principles.\n\nD.\n\nGovernment Expenditure\n\n30.\nAfter  Independence,  and  with  the  termination  of  subsidies  from  the  FSU,  public\nexpenditures  fell  sharply  from  33  percent  of  GDP  in  1990  to  18  percent  in  1994,  and  ranged\nfrom 19 percent in 1995 to 21 percent in 1999. Government budgetary operations in agriculture\namounted  to  T7.2  billion  in  1995,  T6.7  billion  in  1996,  T6.5  billion  in  1997,  and  T4.8  billion  in\n1999  (all  in  1995  prices).  Almost  half  of  the  Republican  budget  for  MOA  in  1999  consisted  of\ninvestment  projects  that  were  partly  financed  by  external  sources  of  funds.  In  1999,  local\ngovernment  budgets  for  agriculture,  forestry  and  fishery  amounted  to  T1.6  billion  in  current\nterms, representing less than 18 percent of the total public spending on agriculture. Compared\nwith  public  spending  on  other  sectors,  public  expenditures  on  agriculture  are  small.  With  tight\nfiscal  constraints  and  significant  reduction  in  subsidies,  Government  spending  on  agriculture\ndecreased from 3.5 percent of the total public expenditures in 1995 to 1.9 percent in 1999.\n\nE.\n\nGovernment Objectives and Strategy\n\n31.\nThe  Government  has  given  considerable  attention  to  the  agriculture  sector  in  its  long-\nterm  strategic  planning.  MOA,  in  cooperation  with  the  Agency  for  Strategic  Planning  (AgSP),\nrecently  prepared  a  medium-term  strategy  for  the  accelerated  completion  of  reforms  in  the\nagriculture  sector.17  This  strategy  includes  measures  to  (i)  complete  the  process  of  farm\nrestructuring, in part by applying, when required, bankruptcy procedures specific to the needs of\nagriculture; (ii) develop market infrastructure and market information services; (iii) stimulate the\nformation  of  cooperatives  and  voluntary  farmer  associations;  (iv)  enhance  access  to  financial\nservices; and (v) stimulate domestic and foreign private investment in the sector. The objectives\nand scope of the SDP are fully consistent with this medium-term strategy.\n\n32.\nThe Republican Working Committee was formed in February 1998 to analyze progress\nin  farm  restructuring,  focusing  on  the  country\u2019s  remaining  production  cooperatives.  The\ncommittee  recommended  steps  to  (i)  legally  register  all  shares  in  such  cooperatives,  and  (ii)\nencourage  their  restructuring  into  more  financially  viable  farm  structures.  The  committee  also\nrecommended action to monitor and strengthen the financial performance of the country\u2019s large\n\n                                                \n17 In  November  1997,  the  Government  issued  a  long-run  strategic  statement,  Kazakhstan  2030.  Government  line\nagencies, including MOA, have collaborated closely with AgSP to draft medium-term plans to realize this vision at\nthe sector level.\n\n\f10\n\ncorporate  farms,  and  to  provide  information  to  farm  shareholders  on  their  farm  restructuring\noptions. These efforts will be enhanced under the proposed SDP.\n\n33.\nAlthough medium-term fiscal constraints will severely limit the Government's capacity for\ndirect investment in the sector, including that financed through external borrowing, MOA has, in\npart  with  ADB  assistance,18  strengthened  its  efforts  to  monitor  and  support  the  agriculture\nsector,  recently  conducting  a  nationwide  survey  and  analysis  of  the  operational  and  financial\nperformance of Kazakhstan's relatively large-scale, corporately owned farm enterprises. In early\n1999,  MOA  was  reorganized  to  consolidate  its  capacities  to  (i)  analyze  national  and\ninternational market developments, (ii) refine and more effectively implement market economic\nreforms,  (iii)  provide  technical  support  services  and  facilitate  the  provision  of  credit,  and  (iv)\nencourage  private  sector  investment.  Activities  proposed  under  the  SDP  will  complement  and\nreinforce MOA\u2019s institutional strengthening efforts.\n\n34.\nThe  Government\u2019s  strategy  has  increasingly  addressed  the  need  to  generate  new\nemployment in rural areas. In addition to the National Fund for Support of Low-Income Citizens\n(para.  8),  the  Small  Business  Development  Fund  was  created  in  1997  to  provide  investment\ncredits  to  small-  and  medium-size  nonfarm  enterprises.19  The  Government  is  preparing  a  new\nnational  program  for  fighting  poverty  and  unemployment  2000-2002  (para.  9).  To  further  the\ngoals of the newly established Agency in Support of Small Business, the Government issued a\ndecree  in  1998,  clarifying  the  legal  rights  of  citizens  for  freedom  of  business  activity.  The\nproposed SDP will enhance the effectiveness of these efforts.\n\nF.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n35.\nBesides ADB, several international financial agencies and bilateral sources are assisting\nKazakhstan\u2019s  agriculture  sector.  The  SDP  was  prepared  in  close  coordination  with  these\norganizations.  Of  most  direct  relevance  to  the  SDP  are  the  programs  financed  by  the  World\nBank,  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development,  the  European  Union's\nTechnical Assistance for the Confederation of Independent States (EU-TACIS), and the United\nStates.  In  1997,  the  World  Bank  approved  the  Real  Estate  Registration  Pilot  Project  for  $10\nmillion, followed in 1998 by the Agricultural Post-Privatization Support Project for $15 million.20\nThe  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development  and  the  United  States  Government\nare financing credit lines for onlending to micro, small, and medium-size enterprises, including\nthose in the agriculture sector. Access of SDP beneficiaries to these funds as an alternative to\nproject financing will be explored, where appropriate, during project implementation.\n\n36.\nEU-TACIS has implemented three pilot projects for the restructuring of privatized farms\nand  agribusinesses  into  more  profitable  units.21  In  1998,  EU-TACIS  commenced  the\n\n                                                \n18 ADB-financed TA has supported MOA\u2019s institutional strengthening, including TA No. 2356-KAZ: Strengthening the\nImplementation of Agriculture Sector Reforms,  for  $600,000,  approved  on  4  July  1995;  and  TA  No.  2448-KAZ:\nStudy on Market Reforms in the Agriculture Sector,  for  $1.044  million,  approved  with  the  ASP  on  23  November\n1995.  TA  2449-KAZ:  Study on Rural Credit and Savings,  for  $0.47  million,  approved  on  23  November  1995,\nprovided a comprehensive analysis of the rural financial sector.\n\n19 The Small Business Development Fund has been financed, in part, with second-tranche proceeds of the ASP.\n20 Both  projects  are  being  implemented  in  the  oblasts  of  Akmola  and  Almaty.  The  SDP's  farm  restructuring\ncomponent  and  the  Agricultural  Post-Privatization  Support  Project  have  similar  objectives  (although  different\ndesign) and will logically share common implementation arrangements within MOA. A follow-on to the Real Estate\nRegistration Pilot Project is presently under preparation and will extend the Government\u2019s real estate registration\nsystem into two new oblasts, including East Kazakhstan.\n\n21 These include (i) Support to Food Processing in Aktubinsk Oblast, (ii) Private Farmers Organizational Support, and\n\n(iii) Pilot Development of Private Farming and Food Processing in Akmola Oblast.\n\n\f11\n\nimplementation  of  a  project,  Support  to  Rural  Credit  Improvement,  that  will  provide  technical\nadvice  and  training  to  commercial  bank  staff  in  Almaty  and  Akmola  oblasts.  The  Agricultural\nManagement  and  Market  Information  System  Project,  completed  in  mid-1998,  developed  a\ncomprehensive database on prices and markets for nationally disseminated publications. During\nthe  coming  few  years,  MOA  intends  to  expand  this  system  so  that  it  provides  more  regionally\ndisaggregated  information  in  high-priority  agricultural  oblasts.  Finally,  in  2000,  EU-TACIS\ninitiated a two-year project, Support to Establish a Vertical Market Structure, with objectives to\n(i)  establish  assembly  markets,  possibly  including  input  supply;  (ii)  strengthen  oblast  market\ninformation systems and link these to the national system; (iii) strengthen farmer cooperatives;\nand  (iv)  promote  efficient  competition  among  agricultural  traders  and  business  persons.  All  of\nthe EU-TACIS-supported projects are highly complementary to the objectives of the SDP, and\nformal linkages to their activities will be made where appropriate.\n\n37.\nThe United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is financing a variety\nof  projects  that  are  highly  complementary  to  the  SDP.  Of  particular  relevance  are  the\nCommercial  Law  and  Accounting  Reform  projects,  which  are  helping  the  ministries  of  justice\nand  finance  (MOJ/MOF)  and  other  agencies  (i)  prepare  the  legal  framework  for  private  sector\ninvestment  and  (ii)  develop  private  financial  institutions,  including  legislation  related  to\nmortgage, accounting, auditing, and bankruptcy. The Fiscal Reform Project is providing training\nand  policy  advice  in  support  of  the  efforts  of  MOF  to  rationalize  and  improve  the  efficiency  of\nKazakhstan\u2019s  tax  system.  If  fully  implemented,  the  recommendations  of  this  project  will\nsubstantially  improve  the  transparency  and  equity  of  the  tax  burden  borne  by  farms.  USAID\u2019s\nKazakhstan  Community  Loan  Fund  is  presently  setting  up  the  country's  first  credit  union  in  a\npilot project that is being monitored closely by NBK. In the area of environment, USAID-financed\nprojects  have  assisted  MOA's  Committee  for  the  Management  of  Water  Resources  in  forming\npilot  water  user  associations  (WUAs)  and  in  drafting  legislation  on  water  pricing.  USAID\u2019s\nFarmer-to-Farmer Program and the joint USAID/Israeli Cooperative Development Program are\nproviding  TA,  training,  and  farm  demonstration  activities  in  animal  husbandry,  greenhouse\nfarming, irrigation, crop production, and food processing.\n\nG.\n\nADB\u2019s Operations and Strategy in the Sector\n\nThe  objectives  of  ADB's  operational  strategy  for  Kazakhstan  include  (i)  encouraging  the\n38.\ntransition to a market economy, (ii) promoting rehabilitation of the environment, (iii) strengthening\nthe  long-term  potential  for  sustainable  growth  through  investment  in  physical  infrastructure  and\nhuman  resources,  and  (iv)  encouraging  private  sector  investment.  Since  commencing  lending\noperations  in  Kazakhstan  in  1995,  ADB  has  been  a  major  source  of  external  finance  and\nadvisory TA in the agriculture sector. The SDP is a logical step in ADB\u2019s phased sequence of (i)\nsupport \nin  sustainable,\nenvironmentally sound projects to promote growth. The proposed loans would be the fourth and\nfifth  for  ADB  in  the  agriculture  sector,  after  the  ASP  (footnote  6)  and  the  Water  Resources\nManagement and Land Improvement Project.22 ADB is also preparing assistance to strengthen\nthe Government\u2019s capacity to deal with the recent upsurge of locusts in Kazakhstan\u2019s northern\ngrain-producing regions.23\n\nfor  market-oriented  policy  reforms,  and  (ii)  direct \n\ninvestment \n\n                                                \n22 Loans  1592/1593(SF)-KAZ:  Water  Resources  Management  and  Land  Improvement  Project,  for  $40  million,\n\napproved on 17 December 1997.\n\n23 Under  TA  3442-KAZ: Preparation of the Locust Management Project,  for  $100,000,  approved  on  19  May  2000.\nBased  on  the  outcome  of  the  TA  and  a  request  from  the  Government,  ADB  will  provide  a  separate  technical\nassistance in 2001 to Kazakhstan to help MOA and other agencies formulate and implement an environmentally\nsound strategy for locust management.\n\n\f12\n\nAlthough  ADB\u2019s  experience  in  implementing  agriculture  sector  projects  is  relatively\n39.\nlimited in Kazakhstan, several important lessons have been applied in formulating of the SDP.\nFirst, the situation in the sector may be depressed, but it is hardly static. There has been and\nwill continue to be significant dynamism in the institutional and policy framework, as well as in\nthe domestic and external economic environment. Hence, projects and TAs must be designed\nwith enough flexibility to respond proactively to changes and emerging opportunities. To ensure\nthat this occurs, there must be sustained monitoring and evaluation of the impacts of policies,\nlaws, and economic incentives. More importantly, in a country as large as Kazakhstan, central\nguidance must ensure that national policies and laws are properly understood and implemented\nat  the  local  level.24  Second,  because  of  the  major  downsizing  of  national  agencies  during  the\nlast few years, as well as the country\u2019s fiscal constraints, project and TA design requires a high\ndegree  of  decentralization  to,  and  ownership  by,  the  local  agencies  and  beneficiaries  who  will\nbear most of the responsibility for cost recovery. The SDP and its investment Project reflect the\nfindings  of  extensive  consultations  with  farmers  and  rural  communities  about  the  financial,\ninstitutional,  and  technical  constraints  to  rural  employment  and  income  growth.25  Third,  the\nGovernment has made a major effort during the past two years to recruit a new generation of\nenergetic,  reform-minded  personnel,  but  this  has  not  been  sufficient  to  overcome  the  lack  of\nknowledge  about  managing  agriculture  in  a  market  economy.  While  experience  has  been\ngained in the administrative procedures of ADB and other international institutions, the roster of\npersonnel in public agricultural agencies has been in constant transition. Training and capacity\nbuilding  will  continue  to  be  needed  in  areas  such  as  market  economics,  project  management,\nand environmental assessment.\n\nIV. \n\nTHE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\n40.\nKazakhstan\u2019s  transitional  agriculture  sector  has  reached  a  turning  point.  Major  market\nreforms  have  been  adopted,  but  widespread  understanding  of  the  reforms  has  not  been\nachieved and their expected impacts have not fully materialized at the oblast level. The farms\nhave been privatized and almost fully separated from state support systems, but most have yet\nto adopt financially viable management structures and operations suited to a market economy.\nUnder NBK supervision, the rural banking system is being strengthened, but only limited lending\nis available to farms. The farms, in turn, use minimal inputs that are acquired largely by barter;\ngrow primarily traditional, relatively low-value crops; and maintain excessive social obligations.\nAs a result, most are not financially profitable. To escape this moribund equilibrium and achieve\nthe  profitability  that  Kazakhstan's  soil  and  climate  would  permit,  a  two-pronged  approach  is\nrequired: (i) provision of information, and advisory and financial support to the farms and rural\ncommunities  that  undergo  restructuring;  and  (ii)  refinement  and  more  effective  implementation\nof the policy and legal framework for agriculture. Thus, the SDP will integrate (i) an investment\nproject component to directly support farm restructuring; and (ii) a policy component to support\nand  accelerate  the  Government\u2019s  ongoing  efforts  to  strengthen  the  comprehensiveness,\nunderstanding,  and  application  of  the  policy,  legal,  and  regulatory  framework  underlying  farm\nrestructuring  and  commercial  lending  to  agriculture.  The  reforms  supported  by  the  policy  loan\nwill  be  instrumental  in  creating  a  suitable  environment  for  the  implementation  of  the  Project.  In\nthe absence of such interventions, the future will see continuing stagnation of many farms and\n\n                                                \n24 IN.206-99: Agriculture Sector Program, August 1999.\n25 These  consultations  were  conducted  throughout  Kazakhstan's  major  agricultural  oblasts  during  the  first  phase  of\nthe  project  preparatory  TA  (para.  2)  and  subsequently  focused  on  the  project  area  as  the  SDP's  design  was\nfinalized.\n\n\f13\n\nincreasing rural unemployment despite the agronomic and economic potential for regeneration\nand growth.\n\nB.\n\nObjective and Scope\n\n41.\nThe  SDP\u2019s  objective  is  to  promote  agricultural  recovery  and  rural  growth  by  (i)  refining\nthe  policy,  legal,  and  institutional  framework  for  market-led  agriculture;  (ii)  providing  public\ninformation and education on agriculture nationwide; (iii) directly supporting the development of\nfinancially  sustainable  farm  enterprises  and  agribusinesses;  (iv)  directly  supporting  the\nreestablishment  and/or  expansion  of  nonfarm  employment  and  income-generating  activities  in\nrural  communities;  and  (v)  strengthening  capacity  in  local  government  agencies  and\nparticipating  commercial  banks  (PCBs)  so  that  they  can  better  serve  the  needs  of  agriculture\nand  the  rural  communities.  Appendix  1  presents  the  logical  framework  for  the  Farm\nRestructuring SDP.\n\nC.\n\nPolicy Framework and Actions\n\n42. With  prior  ADB  assistance  under  the  ASP,  the  major  market-oriented  reforms  for  the\nagriculture  sector  have  been  largely  completed  at  the  national  level.  Since  the  release  of  the\nsecond  tranche  of  the  ASP  in  June  1997,  the  Government  has  endeavored  to  improve  its\nmonitoring,  analysis,  and  response  to  the  identified  problems  of  agriculture,  even  though  its\nfinancial and human resources are very limited relative to the country\u2019s size. As detailed in the\ndevelopment  policy  letter  (Appendix  2)  and  the  policy  matrix  (Appendix  3),  the  Government\u2019s\ninitiatives have included the following:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nsince  1997,  (a)  continued  strengthening  of  MOA\u2019s  capacity  for  market  analysis\nand  information  provision;  (b)  substantial  efforts  to  deepen  the  legal  and\nregulatory  framework  for  property  rights,  mortgage,  secured  lending,  farm\naccounting,  auditing,  and  agricultural  bankruptcy;  (c)  initial  efforts  to  promote\nwider public understanding of the legal and policy framework for agriculture; and\n(d) the promotion of simplified and more transparent agricultural taxation;\nsince 1998, (a) an ongoing nationwide survey of the financial status of corporate\nfarms;  (b)  efforts  to  promote  restructuring  of  production  cooperatives  into  more\nstable, efficient farm structures; and (c) efforts to directly promote and protect the\nrights of microenterprises and small private businesses;\nin 1999, (a) reorganization and rationalization of the functions of MOA and other\ncentral  ministries  concerned  with  agriculture;  and  (b)  passage  of  the  Law  on\nRural Consumer Cooperatives; and\nalso  in  1999,  the  submission  to  Parliament  of  a  draft  land  law  to  replace  the\nexisting  Presidential  Decree  on  Land  (No.  2717  of  1995).  Among  other\nmeasures,  the  draft  land  law  provided  for  conversion  of  land  use  rights  to\nownership  rights  by  individual  citizens.  With  Government  encouragement,  the\ndraft  land  law  was  widely  publicized  within  Kazakhstan.  In  the  ensuing  public\ndiscussion,  widespread  concern  was  expressed  that  Kazakhstan  was  not  yet\nready to cede permanent land ownership rights to private individuals. As a result,\nthe land law was withdrawn from Parliament for amendment and resubmission at\na later date. Although public opinion does not yet favor full land ownership, this\nexperience illustrates the Government\u2019s intent to deepen the reform process and\n\n\f14\n\nits  increasing  efforts  to  involve  the  public  in  the  consideration  of  major  policy\nissues.26\n\n43.\nThe SDP was formulated in the light of the Government\u2019s commitment to market reforms\ndespite  severe  public  resource  constraints.  Rather  than  requiring  dramatic  new  reforms,  the\npolicy component is evolutionary and will support the Government\u2019s initiatives to deepen, refine,\nand more effectively apply the institutional, legislative, and policy measures already undertaken,\nwith  the  specific  objective  of  promoting  effective  farm  restructuring  and  viable  commercial\nlending  to  agriculture.  Thus,  the  policy  component  is  fully  consistent  with  the  Government\u2019s\nagriculture sector strategy, and will enhance eight areas of reform:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe policy component will deepen MOA\u2019s efforts to strengthen sector monitoring,\nanalysis, and programming. MOA\u2019s surveys of sector and farm performance will\nbe expanded in coverage, a system of computerized market information centers\nwill  be  established,  and  with  support  from  the  accompanying  TA  (para.  94),\ndomestic agricultural research programs will be strengthened.\nThe growth of agriculture will be promoted by creating a stronger collateral basis\nfor  commercial  lending  to  farms,  and  supported  by  expanding  the  system  for\nregistering  rights  to  immovable  property  into  East  Kazakhstan  and  at  least  one\nother high-priority oblast.\n\n(iv) \n\n(iii)  More transparent farm management and a stronger legal framework for secured\nlending  will  be  promoted  through  the  adoption  by  MOF  of  international\naccounting  and  auditing  standards,  and  the  application  of  suitable  accounting\nand  auditing  standards  to  farms  and  agribusiness  enterprises  that  are  legal\nentities.  With  TA  support,  the  Government  will  also  evaluate  and  refine,  as\nnecessary, legislation on agricultural bankruptcy, and on the pledging of movable\nproperty and mortgage of immovable property.\nThrough  a  nationwide  public  information  campaign,  the  policy  component  will\ndirectly promote greater understanding of agriculture in a market economy. Using\nmass  media,  publications,  training  courses,  and  seminars,  the  campaign,  to  be\nprepared with TA support, will include the legal rights, obligations, and economic\nand  financial  opportunities  associated  with  alternative  forms  of  land  tenure  and\nfarming  structures;  pledging  of  movable  and  immovable  property;  agricultural\ntaxation;  bankruptcy;  formation  of  voluntary  farmer  associations;  and  conflict\nresolution, including conflicts that arise from interference by local administrations in\nfarm decisions.\nTo  promote  more  efficient  collection  of  agricultural  taxes  and  use  of  water  fees,\nthe  Government  will  continue \ntax  policy  and\nadministration. In addition, based on the findings of ongoing ADB-financed TA,27\nthe Government will improve procedures to collect water fees and rationalize the\nallocation  of  these  fees  between  oblast  administrations  and  the  national\nGovernment.  Starting  in  2002,  a  line  item  in  the  Republican  budget  will  provide\nfunding  for  operation  and  maintenance  of  drainage  and  irrigation  infrastructure,\ntaking into account the level of collection of water fees for past years.\n\nits  reforms  of  agricultural \n\n(v) \n\n                                                \n26 From the standpoint of the SDP, the legal framework for land tenure embodied in the 1995 Presidential Decree on\nLand provides adequate incentives for the development of competitive agriculture as it allows long-term land use\nrights to be bought, sold, exchanged, bequeathed, leased, and mortgaged.\n\n27 TA  2946-KAZ: Institutional Development and Policy Reforms for Improving Water Management,  for  $600,000,\napproved on 17 December 1997 attached to Loan 1592/1593 (SF)-KAZ: Water Resources Management and Land\nImprovement Project, for $40 million, approved on 17 December 1997.  The TA commenced in June 2000.\n\n\f15\n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nThe  policy  component  will  encourage  local  private  initiative  through  measures  to\nreduce interference by local administrations in farm and rural business affairs, and\nto  facilitate  the  formation  of  voluntary  rural  associations,  including  cooperatives\nand water user groups. With TA support for critical reviews of the Civil Code and\nother  existing  laws  governing  voluntary  associations,  new  or,  as  appropriate,\nrevised legislation will be prepared to facilitate the establishment and functioning\nof such associations. A specific goal is to establish clear legal procedures for the\ntransfer of irrigation and drainage systems to water users.\nEfficient pricing of agricultural inputs, a key thrust of the ASP, will be continued.\nThe  Government\u2019s  programs  for  subsidized  farm  and  microenterprise  credits,\nsuspended since late 1998, will not be reintroduced except as specifically agreed\nupon by the Government, ADB, and World Bank. In addition, except as otherwise\nagreed,  the  Government  will  continue  its  policy  of  not  subsidizing  meat,  wool,\nfertilizer, and other production inputs used in agriculture.\n\n(viii) Recognizing that encouraging foreign private investment will facilitate the market-\nled  diversification  of  agriculture,  the  Government  will  conduct  a  survey  of\npotential  foreign  investors,  and  prepare  and  implement  recommendations  to\nimprove  foreign  investment  incentives.  Domestic  oilseed  processing  is  a  key\nsubsector  in  which  a  sharp  decline  in  capacity  over  the  past  seven  years  now\nconstrains  potential  crop  diversification  by  farmers.  Hence,  as  part  of  the  policy\ncomponent, MOA will review the recent developments in oilseed production and\nprocessing,  and  prepare  recommendations  to  encourage  the  efficient  revival  of\nthis industry.\n\nD.\n\nCapacity Building\n\n44.\nTraining of trainers and beneficiaries is an indispensable part of the SDP. Staff of farm\nenterprises,  rural  businesses,  private  farmer  associations,  and  participating  NGOs  will  be\nprovided with a range of training opportunities to achieve the necessary skill levels as quickly as\npossible.  On-the-job  and  formal  training  financed  by  the  investment  Project  will  include  (i)\nagriculture  and  farm  management  in  a  market  economy;  (ii)  awareness  training  for  all\nbeneficiaries; (iii) agricultural law; (iv) microenterprise development, including bookkeeping and\naccounting  in  addition  to  vocational  and  marketing  skills;  and  (v)  cooperative  development.  In\naddition,  formal  linkages  will  be  developed  with  relevant  capacity  building  efforts  of  other\nexternal agencies, particularly EU-TACIS and USAID (paras. 36-37).\n\nThe investment Project will provide a variety of training opportunities for microenterprise\n45.\ndevelopment  workers  and  business  owners  in  areas  such  as  credit  delivery,  business\naccounting and management,  marketing and product development, and specialized vocational\nskills. The Project will also support training and capacity building within the participating banks.\nA  long-term  agricultural  credit  specialist  (Appendix  4)  will  advise  the  banks,  other  financial\nintermediaries, and the concerned public agencies on the organization of agricultural and small-\nscale  lending  activities  at  the  oblast  and  raion  levels,  including  the  formulation  of  procedures\nand methods for rural credit appraisal and loan monitoring.\n\n46.\nNumerous  public  and  private  institutions  will  be  involved  in  the  complex  process  of\nrestructuring  farms  and  regenerating  rural  economies.  These  include  the  national,  oblast,  and\nraion  offices  of  MOA,  the  PCBs,  oblast  administration  personnel  responsible  for  poverty\nreduction  programs,  and  the  agricultural  research  and  training  institutions,  together  with  local\noffices  of  MOJ,  the  courts,  and  the  State  Committee  for  Land  Tenure  and  Land  Relations\n(Goskomzem). On-the-job and formal training will be provided to ensure that these agencies are\n\n\f16\n\nprepared  to  implement  and  manage  the  Project,  to  sustain  the  activities  beyond  the  period  of\nADB  financing,  and  to  independently  replicate  the  project  approach  elsewhere  in  Kazakhstan.\nThe  key  inputs  for  accomplishing  these  tasks  will  include  (i)  long-term  consulting  advisers  in\nfarm and agribusiness management and agricultural credit; (ii) short-term specialists, recruited\nas needed, to strengthen skills in diverse areas such as farm machinery and equipment, project\nmanagement, and water and environmental management (Appendix 4); and (iii) the institutional\nstrengthening support to be provided under the accompanying TA (para. 94).\n\nE.\n\nThe Investment Project\n\n1.\n\nThe Project Area\n\nEast Kazakhstan oblast occupies the northeastern corner of the country, and is bordered\n47.\non the north by the Russian Federation and on the east by the People\u2019s Republic of China. The\noblast\u2019s  population  of  1.6  million  people  is  43  percent  rural.  The  oblast  covers  some  288,000\nsquare  kilometers  and  is  characterized  mainly  by  three  distinct  agroecological  zones:  (i)\nmountainous  areas  in  the  south  and  north,  where  annual  precipitation  is  greater  than  500\nmillimeters (mm); (ii) the relatively fertile upper foothills and lower-lying floodplains in the center,\nwhich have precipitation of 350-500 mm and receive significant growing-season runoff from the\nmountains; and (iii) the semiarid steppes in the west, where annual precipitation usually is below\n300  mm.  Overall,  the  agricultural  potential  of  the  foothills  and  floodplains  is  considerable,  far\nexceeding that of the steppes. The lower mountain areas also have good agricultural potential,\nbut require suitable soil conservation techniques.\n\nThe  selection  of  East  Kazakhstan  for  inclusion  in  the  Project  was  based  on  careful\n48.\nconsideration  of  a  variety  of  criteria,  including  (i)  nature  and  potential  of  the  agricultural\neconomy; (ii) farming structure, including the need and scope for restructuring; (iii) level of farm\nindebtedness;  (iv)  availability  of  potential  participating  bank  branches  in  rural  areas;  (v)\nreceptiveness  and  capacity  of  local  agricultural  agencies,  including  research  and  training\ninstitutions;  and  (vi)  socioeconomic  characteristics.28  East  Kazakhstan  has  a  large  rural\npopulation in a predominantly agricultural oblast. Its agroecological zones are representative of\nKazakhstan\u2019s  high  potential  rain-fed  areas.  Farm  debt  levels  in  the  oblast  are  generally\nmanageable,  while  the  basic  capacities  of  the  public  institutions  and  banks  are  judged  to  be\nabove  average.  Local  farmers  and  public  agency  personnel  have  expressed  considerable\ninterest and commitment to the proposed activities of the Project.\n\nNot  all  of  East  Kazakhstan\u2019s  15  raions  have  the  required  agroclimatic  potential  for\n49.\nfinancially  sustainable  growth  in  a  market  economy.  The  foothill  areas  of  highest  potential  are\nconcentrated in the oblast\u2019s northern, northeastern, and east central regions. These areas cover\na total of eight to nine of the oblast\u2019s raions and will, initially at least, be the primary focus of the\nProject.  Areas  of  low  potential  include  the  upper  mountains,  steppes,  and  semideserts  where\nthe  low  rainfall  and  short  growing  season  are  formidable  constraints  to  financially  viable\nagriculture.  Subject  to  the  availability  of  project  resources,  these  low-potential  regions  may  be\ncovered by the Project beginning about two years after its commencement.\n\n                                                \n28 The first phase of project preparation involved a detailed study of all of Kazakhstan\u2019s major agricultural regions and\n\na systematic ranking of oblasts based on these selection criteria.\n\n\f17\n\n2. \n\nProject Activities\n\nThe  Project  comprises  three  basic  components:  institutional  development,  credit,  and\n\n50.\ntraining. The logical sequence of the project activities is as follows:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nA rural advisory unit (RAU) will be established in Ust-Kamenogorsk, the capital of\nEast  Kazakhstan  oblast,  to  provide  advice  and  formal  training  in  the  legal  and\nfinancial  aspects  of  farm  restructuring  and  business  management  in  a  market\neconomy,  as  well  as  the  technical  and  marketing  skills  required  for  farm\ndiversification.\nThe  revitalization  of  input  supplies  and  agroprocessing  facilities  is  essential  to\nencourage  more  productive,  diversified  farming  systems.  Hence,  the  RAU  will\nalso provide training and advisory services to selected agribusinesses that have\nstrong  forward  and  backward  linkages  to  the  farms.  In  East  Kazakhstan,\ncandidate enterprises for such support may include machinery repair and custom\nhire  services,  medium-scale  processing  of  sunflower  and  other  oilseeds,  and\nsmall-scale dairy processing.\nThe process of farm restructuring has involved a significant reduction in the direct\nemployment provided by the larger farm enterprises. This loss of employment is\nexpected  to  continue  during  the  restructuring  of  the  farms  that  are  the  primary\ntarget group of the Project. To counteract this, the RAU, working in cooperation\nwith  local  NGOs,  will  complement  the  Government\u2019s  antipoverty  efforts  with\nsupport  for  skills  training  and  the  expansion  of  employment  in  rural  nonfarm\nmicro  and  small  business  enterprises  that  build,  to  the  maximum  degree\npossible, upon existing skills and other resources in the oblast.\nFarms,  agribusinesses,  and  microenterprises  that  adopt  viable  business  plans\nand  demonstrate  their  commitment  to  sound  management  practices  will  be\neligible to apply for credit at market rates under the Project for seasonal working\ncapital  and  longer  term  investment  through  the  local  commercial  banks.  Both\nbanks  and  borrowers  will  make  significant  contributions  to  the  investment\nfinancing. Potential subborrowers will be able to approach the banks directly for\nrelatively  small  working  capital  loans,  but  all  applications  for  large  investment\nloans must be accompanied by a detailed farm restructuring plan, and will need\nto be reviewed and cleared by the RAU. Thus, the RAU will serve as a linkage\nbetween the large rural enterprises and the PCBs.\nSince  these  banks  need  stronger  abilities  to  appraise  and  manage  rural  loans,\nthe  Project  will  provide  consulting  services  and  training  to  build  capacity  in  the\nrural \nthe  Government\u2019s\nmicroenterprise  program,  support  for  the  establishment  of  joint  liability  lending\nwill be explored to widen the Project\u2019s potential borrower base.\nFinally,  the  Project  will  support  (a)  training  and  capacity  building  in  local  public\nagencies;  (b)  strengthening  of  applied  agricultural  research,  education,  and\noutreach  capacity  within  East  Kazakhstan;  and  (c)  development  of  project\nimplementation capacity within MOA, which will be responsible for recruitment of\nconsultants  and  procurement,  project  monitoring  and  evaluation,  coordination\nwith  other  Government  agencies,  ensuring  that  ADB  procedures  are  followed,\nand routine reporting to ADB.\n\nfinancial  system.

These  surveys\nconfirmed  that  nationwide  unemployment,  low  and  declining  incomes,  and  deteriorating  social\nservices  are  also  significant  social  problems  in  the  area.  Potentially  vulnerable  groups  include\nhouseholds  with  no  stable  employment,  those  that  never  received  or  those  that  transferred\nfarmland  and  property  shares,  and  pension-dependent  families,  particularly  those  headed  by\nwomen.  A  marked  share  of  the  rural  population  in  the  working  age  group,  including  a\ndisproportionately  large  share  of  women,  has  lost  formal  employment  as  a  result  of  farm\nprivatization, restructuring, and the collapse of economic activity in rural Kazakhstan. The loss\nof direct farm employment is expected to continue as an inevitable part of the processes of farm\nrestructuring and the rationalization of production costs.\n\n54.\nThe  investment  Project\u2019s  microenterprise  development  initiatives  will  mitigate  this\nproblem by providing training, advisory support, and financing aimed at adding value to readily\navailable, largely agricultural, raw materials that provide a source of cash income. The activities\nwill  focus  on  farm  communities  that,  with  project  support,  commence  a  process  of\ncomprehensive  restructuring  involving  a  significant  rationalization  of  costs.  Over  time,  and\ndepending  on  demand,  the  microenterprise  development  may  expand  to  other  areas  of  the\noblast and is expected to have particular benefits for women.\n\n55.\nThe microenterprise development will complement the oblast\u2019s ongoing microenterprise\nprograms managed by NGO Microcredit and the Regional Fund for Support to the Low-Income\nPopulation.29 The Project will build upon the experience gained and clientele base established\nunder these programs, working to help poor families that have successfully established an initial\ncredit record to graduate to larger loans on commercial terms. The subloans for microenterprise\ndevelopment  will  likely  fall  within  the  range  of  $1,000\u2013$10,000  equivalent,  with  lending\narrangements similar to those described in paras. 80-81 for farm and agribusiness enterprises.\n\n2.\n\nImpact on Poverty\n\nThe increase in rural poverty can only be arrested by a combination of profitable farms,\n56.\nwell-managed  farm  support  services,  and  growth  of  off-farm  employment.  These  are  the  main\nfocus  of  the  Project.  The  SDP  and  the  Project,  in  particular,  provide  specific  interventions  to\nmitigate  the  undesirable  social  impacts  of  farm  restructuring.  The  Project\u2019s  microenterprise\ndevelopment is directly targeted at rural communities and social groups most likely to lose direct\nfarm  employment  as  the  result  of  farm  restructuring.  The  project  activities  are  intended  to  be\nboth  sustainable  and  replicable.  In  addition,  the  SDP's  policy  support  measures  will  reinforce\nthe  project  interventions  by  providing  information  to  rural  communities  about  their  rights,\nobligations, and opportunities, as well as by strengthening the legal and institutional framework\n\n                                                \n29 These programs operate under the umbrella of the National Fund for Support of Low-Income Citizens (para. 8) and\noffer  credits  of  up  to  $400  equivalent,  largely  to  underemployed  rural  households,  for  the  establishment  or\nexpansion  of  microenterprises.  State  funding  of  the  programs  was  suspended  in  late  1998  due  to  budgetary\nconstraints. Unemployed women, particularly those in households with a large number of children, were a specific\ntarget group of these programs, and will receive attention under the Project.\n\n\f20\n\nfor land and farm ownership, rural small business development, and the formation of voluntary\nrural associations.\n\n3.\n\nEnvironment\n\nIndeed, \n\nimpacts. \n\nincorporated.  Accordingly,  an \n\n57.\nThe  Project  was  classified  by  ADB  as  environmental  category  B,  meaning  that\npotentially  adverse  environmental  impacts  must  be  assessed,  and  if  required,  appropriate\nmitigation  measures \ninitial  environmental  examination,\nsummarized  in  Appendix  6,  was  conducted  during  project  preparation.  It  concluded  that  the\nProject  would  cause  no  significant  adverse  environmental \nthe  net\nenvironmental  impacts  are  expected  to  be  positive,  principally  through  (i)  the  removal  of\nmarginal  land  from  agricultural  use;  (ii)  a  reduction  in  the  cultivated  area,  especially  sloping\nland; (iii) the use of more diversified cropping patterns to promote soil fertility and biodiversity,\nand prevent the buildup of plant diseases; and (iv) reduced use of inefficient energy-consuming\ntechnologies. Only modest incremental fertilizer and agrochemical use by farms is expected as\na result of the Project. East Kazakhstan\u2019s pump irrigation systems were capable of functioning\nonly under conditions of heavily subsidized energy costs. In the present economic environment,\nthese systems will certainly continue to decline in area even as farm profitability recovers. The\nProject will focus predominantly on rain-fed agriculture and will have no significant implications\nfor  on-farm  water  use.30  Finally,  the  agribusiness  and  microenterprise  investments  envisioned\nunder  the  Project\u2014for  example,  machinery  services,  oilseed  and  dairy  processing,  and  small\nhousehold crafts and services\u2014will entail negligible increases in effluents and wastes. Hence, a\nfull  environmental  impact  assessment  was  not  required  for  the  Project.  Nonetheless,  the  RAU\nand  participating  staff  of  the  oblast  Department  of  Agriculture  (DOA)  will  coordinate  with  the\noblast  Department  of  Environment  and  Natural  Resources  to  (i)  monitor  subborrower\ncompliance  with  the  applicable  environmental  assessment  and  mitigation  requirements  of  the\nGovernment  and  ADB,  and  (ii)  monitor  relevant  environmental  parameters  such  as\nagrochemical  use  and  soil  and  water  effluents.  Submission  of  an  initial  environmental\nexamination  in  accordance  with  ADB  guidelines  will  be  a  condition  for  ADB  clearance  of  all\nagroprocessing subloans in excess of $100,000 in value. Agroprocessing investments financed\nby  subloans  below  $100,000  must  be  in  compliance  with  applicable  Government  and  ADB\nenvironmental guidelines, and certification of such compliance will be maintained as part of PCB\nloan records.\n\nV. \n\nTHE LOANS\n\nA.\n\nThe Policy Loan\n\n1.\n\nAmount of Loan, Terms, and Source of Funds\n\nImplementation of the SDP's policy reforms (para. 43) will include substantial costs for (i)\n58.\na nationwide public information and education campaign on agriculture; (ii) the expansion of the\nsystem  for  registering  rights  to  immovable  property;  (iii)  a  market  information  system;  (iv)\nimplementation  and  monitoring  of  new  accounting  and  auditing  requirements,  (v)  a  national\nsurvey  of  farm  financial  performance,  cropping  patterns,  and  profitability;  and  (vi)  various\nstudies and evaluations required to the legal framework. To support the implementation of the\n                                                \n30 At  present,  the  main  potential  for  irrigation  development  exists  in  low-lying  regions  of  the  oblast,  where  soil  and\nwater  table  characteristics  make  groundwater  irrigation  feasible.  This  development  will  not  be  financially  justified\nwith  the  present  mix  of  largely  low-value  cereal  crops,  but  the  viability  of  the  investment  may  improve  as  farm\nrestructuring  and  diversification  occur.  Should  farmers  show  interest,  the  RAU    will  assist  them  in  evaluating\nfinancially and environmentally sound technologies and promote WUAs.\n\n\f21\n\nSDP's  policy  component,  a  loan  of  $25  million  is  proposed  from  ADB's  ordinary  capital\nresources,  with  a  term  of  15  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  interest  calculated  in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  pool-based  variable  lending  rate  system  for  US  dollar  loans,  and  a\ncommitment  charge  of  0.75  percent  per  annum  on  the  undisbursed  portion  of  the  loan.  The\nGovernment will pay to ADB a front-end fee equal to 1 percent of the loan amount. The fee will\nbe capitalized in the loan.\n\n2.\n\nImplementation Arrangements and Executing Agency\n\n59.\nThe policy component will be implemented over two years from 30 November 2000 to 30\nNovember  2002.  MOF  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  policy  loan  and  will  take  overall\nresponsibility  for  the  policy  component  implementation,  which  will  be  jointly  monitored  by  a\nsteering committee to be established immediately after the policy loan becomes effective. The\ncommittee  will  be  composed  of  senior  personnel  of  MOA,  AgSP,  MOJ,  and  the  Ministry  of\nEconomy.\n\n3.\n\nProcurement and Disbursement\n\n60.\nThe proceeds of the policy loan will be disbursed against a broad range of imports with\nthe exclusion of items contained in a short negative list and imports financed by other bilateral\nand  multilateral  sources.  Disbursement  will  be  in  accordance  with  the  simplified  disbursement\nprocedures  and  related  requirements  for  program  loans.  The  Government  will  be  required  to\nsubmit with each withdrawal application a certificate that the volume of eligible imports exceeds\nthe amount of ADB's projected disbursements under the loan in a given period. ADB will have\nthe right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the Government's\ncertification.\n\n4.\n\nCounterpart Funds\n\n61.\nThe counterpart funds to be generated from the proceeds of the loan will be used by the\nGovernment to finance (i) the costs of implementing the SDP\u2019s policy reforms; and (ii) the local\ncounterpart  costs  of  high-priority  development  projects  and  TA  in  the  agriculture  sector,\nparticularly those financed by ADB.\n\n5.\n\nMonitoring and Tranching\n\nMOF will be responsible for monitoring the implementation of all measures contained in\n62.\nthe policy matrix, and for semiannual reporting of progress to ADB. The proceeds of the loan will\nbe utilized over 24 months and released in two equal tranches of $12.5 million. The first tranche\nwill be released upon loan effectiveness. Release of the second tranche is expected to occur in\nNovember 2001 upon satisfactory completion of the following Government actions:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nprepare a phased plan, in a manner satisfactory to ADB, and submit a proposal\nto  Parliament  in  the  draft  law  on  the  Republican  budget  for  2002  to  finance  a\nsystem  of  computerized  market  information  centers  that  routinely  disseminate\nprice and other market information to farms;\naccept  the  application  of  either  the  international  accounting  standards  of  the\nInternational  Accounting  Standards  Committee  or  equivalent  standards\nsatisfactory  to  ADB;  and  adopt  a  timetable  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the\nimplementation of the accounting standards;\n\n\f22\n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nprepare  and  commence  implementation,  in  a  manner  satisfactory  to  ADB,  of  a\nphased plan to apply internationally accepted auditing and accounting standards,\nor  equivalent  standards  satisfactory  to  ADB,  to  farms  and  agribusiness\nenterprises that are legal entities;\npropose  to  Parliament  in  the  draft  law  on  the  Republican  budget  for  2002  the\nprovision  of  a  budget,  in  an  amount  to  be  agreed  upon  by  ADB,  to  finance  the\nnationwide  public  information  and  education  program  on  agriculture,  which  will\ndisseminate  knowledge \n(newspapers,\ntelevision, and radio), and training courses and seminars;\nevaluate  the  impact  of  oblast  and  raion-level  administration  interference  in  the\ndecisions  of  private  farmers  on  land  use,  cropping  patterns,  and  input-output\nmarketing,  including  the  adequacy  of  grievance  procedures;  and  based  on  the\nresults  of  this  review,  submit  to  the  President\u2019s  Administration,  for  approval,\nmeasures  necessary  to  reduce  administrative  interference  in  the  activities  of\nprivate farms and agribusinesses; and\nsubmit  to  Parliament  a  draft  law  on  WUAs,  or  adopt  a  regulation  on  WUAs,\nspecifying  procedures  for  the  transfer  of  irrigation  and  drainage  systems  to\nWUAs, and removing any legal obstacles to WUA formation.\n\nthrough  publications,  mass  media \n\nB.\n\nThe Investment Loan\n\n1.\n\nAmount of Loan, Terms, and Source of Funds\n\n63.\nA loan of $20 million from ADB's ordinary capital resources is proposed, with a term of\n25  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  and  with  interest  calculated  in  accordance  with\nADB\u2019s  pool-based  variable  lending  rate  system  for  US  dollar  loans,  and  an  annual  commitment\ncharge of 0.75 percent. The Government will pay to ADB a front-end fee equal to 1 percent of\nthe loan amount. The fee will be capitalized in the loan.\n\n2.\n\nImplementation Arrangements and Executing Agency\n\na.\n\nOrganization and Financing of the RAU\n\n64.\nThe RAU will be staffed initially by domestic and international specialists, together with a\nsmall  number  of  oblast  administration  personnel,  with  suitable  experience  in  farm  and\nagribusiness management, microenterprise development, agricultural training, accounting, law,\nmarketing, and other required specialties on an as-needed basis. The RAU will be headed by a\nlong-term,  locally  recruited  director  with  suitable  experience  in  farm  and  agribusiness\nmanagement,  and  detailed  knowledge  of  the  legal  and  financial  aspects  of  farm  privatization\nand  restructuring.  It  will  have  an  advisory  board,  comprising  representatives  of  the  oblast\nadministration, DOA, participating banks, NGOs, and farmers, and will be supervised by MOA.\nThe advisory board will set general policies and strategies for the RAU, and review the progress\nand impacts of the onlending and other project activities, but the RAU\u2019s director and staff must\nretain autonomy in their day-to-day operations, including all decisions to endorse onlending. It\nwill  be  critical\u2014as  MOA  and  the  oblast  administration  have  agreed\u2014for  the  RAU  to  be  an\nobjective organization that fairly and transparently applies strict eligibility and financial criteria in\nidentifying, appraising, and endorsing subloans.\n\nDuring  its  first  two  years  of  operation,  the  RAU  will  be  fully  financed  by  the  Project\n65.\nthrough the contributions of the ADB loan (80 percent) and the Republican budget (20 percent).\nAt  the  end  of  the  second  year,  the  Government  and  ADB  will  undertake  a  comprehensive\n\n\f23\n\nmidterm review (para. 89), during which the performance of the RAU and the participating farms\nwill be evaluated, and a phased plan for RAU cost recovery through user fees will be prepared\nand  initiated.  Thereafter,  the  RAU  will  continue  as  a  permanent,  independent  organization\nfunded increasingly through user fees for the services provided, with a corresponding decrease\nin  funding  by  the  Project.  Besides  the  borrowing  farms  and  enterprises,  possible  financial\ncontributors  include  the  commercial  banks,  agricultural  input  supply  and  agroprocessing  firms,\nand other organizations with a stake in a profitable agriculture sector.\n\nb.\n\nStructure and Characteristics of Participating Farms\n\n66.\nAs of late 1999, East Kazakhstan oblast had a total of 7,085 farms: 6,869 peasant farms\nwith a median size of about 300 ha, and the remainder much larger corporate entities averaging\nabout  21,000  ha.  The  process\u2014rather  than  the  discrete  event\u2014of  the  restructuring  of  the\nformer state farms constitutes a dynamic element of social change in the project area. The total\nnumber  of  peasant  farms  has  grown  by  about  20  percent  since  mid-1998  as  the  result  of  the\nliquidation  and  reform  of  bankrupt  corporate  entities,  and  the  entrepreneurial  desire  to\nundertake  private  farming.  This  desire  has  been  fueled  by  a  variety  of  forces,  including  the\ndeclining  work  hours  and  wages  on  the  corporate  farms;  the  market  reforms  that  have  freed\ncrop  and  input  prices,  and  limited  nonfarm  job  opportunities;  and  a  reassertion  of  the  basic\nindependence and initiative of individual rural households.\n\n67.\nNonetheless,  although  the  large  corporate  units  comprise  just  3  percent  of  the  farms,\nthey collectively account for more than 50 percent of the oblast\u2019s agricultural area.31 The April\n1999  survey  of  the  oblast\u2019s  corporate  farms  conducted  by  MOA  and  DOA  concluded  that  36\npercent  were  performing  profitably  (group  I),  33  percent  were  in  need  of  fundamental\nrehabilitation and restructuring (group II), and 31 percent would likely face liquidation (group III).\nIn  contrast,  as  of  mid-1998,  only  4  percent  of  the  peasant  farms  were  judged  to  be  bankrupt,\nwhile 70 percent were performing profitably. These results are indicative of the efforts already\nbeing made by MOA and DOA to categorize and target specific types of farms, and also show\nthat  it  is  the  large  corporate  farms  that  are  most  frequently  in  need  of  restructuring  support.\nGroup  II  farms  constitute  the  primary  target  group  for  the  RAU\u2019s  farm  restructuring  advisory\nsupport. In general, group III farms, whether corporate or peasant, will not be eligible for project\nsupport  until  the  outcome  of  liquidation/bankruptcy  proceedings  is  clear.  Group  I  farms,\nparticularly  the  smaller  peasant  units,  should  find  it  relatively  easy  to  access  credit  without\nadditional restructuring, but much will depend on the precise circumstances of each farm. Some\ngroup  I  farms,  although  structurally  stable  and  deemed  profitable,  may  not  be  able  to  meet\ncommercial bank lending criteria for major investments unless there are fundamental changes in\nmanagement  practices.  Such  farms  will  also  be  assisted  by  the  RAU  if  they  wish  to  access\nsignificant investment credit under the Project.\n\nThe  Project  will  seek  to  assist  a  core  group  of  farms  that  are  (i)  committed  to\n68.\nrehabilitation  and  restructuring;  (ii)  have  a  sound \nfarm  development  plan;  (iii)  have\ndemonstrated  ability  to  produce  a  strong  cash  flow,  repay  loans,  and  resolve  any  outstanding\ndebt ; and (iv) have the ability to meet other commercial bank criteria, such as collateral (with or\nwithout  any  risk  cover).  However,  the  RAU  will  have  limited  human  (advisory)  and  financial\n\n                                                \n31 The  size  distribution  of  peasant  farms  is  skewed  by  the  1  percent  of  this  class  that  are  essentially  production\ncooperatives averaging 2,400 ha. The large peasant units were formed to avoid the more complicated registration\nand tax procedures for corporate farms that must register as legal entities. If the large peasant farms are added to\nthe corporate farms, then East Kazakhstan\u2019s largest farms comprise 4 percent of total farms, but occupy almost 70\npercent of the farm area.\n\n\f24\n\nresources  relative  to  the  oblast\u2019s  overall  need.  To  make  the  most  effective  use  of  those\nresources, only 50-60 corporate farms will be targeted for detailed restructuring over five years.\nWith  careful  selection,  this  number  of  farms,  although  small,  will  represent  a  significant\nproportion of the oblast\u2019s agricultural resources, covering more than 400,000 ha of agricultural\nland, of which about 200,000 ha are arable and 10,000-20,000 ha are irrigated.\n\n69.\nThe farms, agribusiness enterprises, and commercial banks must meet a detailed set of\neligibility criteria if they are to receive advisory support and significant credit access under the\nProject. These eligibility criteria are discussed in Appendix 7.\n\nc.\n\nRoles and Responsibilities of the Oblast Administration\n\nIn  1998  the  East  Kazakhstan  DOA  was  actively  involved  in  the  national  Republican\n70.\nWorking  Committee's  survey  of  farm  financial  performance,  and  in  the  screening  and\nsubsequent endorsement to local commercial banks of farm applications for the Government\u2019s\n1998/99  subsidy  program  for  interest  charges  on  agricultural  loans.32  Although  the  Project's\nlending arrangements and terms will differ, this activity is essentially similar to the function that\nwill  be  performed  by  the  RAU.  In  addition,  given  East  Kazakhstan\u2019s  enormous  size  and  the\nRAU\u2019s staff constraints, it is inevitable that the RAU will depend heavily on the oblast and raion-\nlevel DOAs to facilitate communications and project activities. For the past two years, the staff\nof  the  oblast  governor  have  been  involved  in  implementing  the  Government\u2019s  small-  and\nmedium-size  enterprise  development  programs,  an  activity  that  also  closely  parallels  the\nProject\u2019s  support  for  community  microenterprise  development.  These  considerations  make  it\nlogical to establish a formal role for the administration\u2019s personnel in RAU operations. As part of\nits contribution to the Project, DOA will assign at least one suitably qualified staff member with\nexperience in farm management, finance, and lending to work with the RAU on a full-time basis.\nIn addition, at least one suitably qualified staff from the oblast administration will be assigned,\non at least a part-time basis, to support the Project\u2019s microenterprise development.\n\n71.\nThe  direct  involvement  of  oblast  personnel  will  allow  the  project  activities  to  be\ncoordinated  closely  with  the  Government\u2019s  related  programs,  and  will  ensure  that  these\npersonnel  benefit  from  the  project  training  and  institutional  development  activities.  However,\ndespite  this  involvement,  it  is  understood  that  the  RAU  must  retain  autonomy  for  selecting\npotential  subborrowers,  providing  advice  on  restructuring  and  other  matters,  and  providing\nonlending recommendations to the PCBs. This independence will be critical if the RAU is to gain\ntrust as an objective, credible partner of the farms and participating banks.\n\n72.\nDOA will coordinate the Project at the oblast level and will take responsibility for reporting\nprogress  to  MOA  and  MOF\u2019s Department for External Loans at  intervals  and  in  a  format  to  be\nagreed  upon  by  the  Government  and  ADB.  The  Project  will  be  supervised  by  an  oblast\ncoordination  committee,  to  be  established  within  one  month  following  effectiveness  of  the\ninvestment loan. The committee will comprise the oblast governor as chairperson, the directors\nof DOA and the RAU, oblast and raion-level representatives of the PCBs, the participating farms\nand NGOs, and key private sector representatives involved in input and output marketing.\n\n                                                \n32 Under this program, the Government contributed interest-free matching funds to those of the commercial banks for\nsmall- and medium-size farm loans that were used largely for working capital. The bulk of such loans extended by\nthe  East  Kazakhstan  Kazagroprom  branch  in  1998  was  in  the  range  of  $5,000-$20,000  equivalent.  Due  to\nbudgetary constraints, this program was suspended in the second half of 1998, and, in accord with the conditions\nof the SDP\u2019s policy component, it will not be reintroduced.\n\n\f25\n\nd.\n\nRoles and Responsibilities of Other Oblast Organizations\n\ni.\n\nRaion Agriculture Departments\n\nOne officer in each of the selected raion offices of DOA (para. 49) will be nominated as\n73.\nfarm  restructuring  coordinator,  and  will  be  assigned  the  responsibilities  of  (i)  disseminating\ninformation about the Project and RAU support services; (ii) assisting rural enterprise managers\nin  communicating  with  the  RAU;  preparing  the  information  that  will  be  required  for  RAU\nscreening of the farm\u2019s legal, financial, and operational status; and assessing the need for, and\nappropriateness  of,  detailed  RAU  assistance;  (iii)  helping  prepare  subloan  application\ndocuments;  and  (iv)  monitoring  the  use  of  subloan  funds,  the  enterprise\u2019s  operational  and\nfinancial performance, and subloan repayment.\n\n74.\nDuring  the  first  three  months  of  project  implementation,  the  farm  restructuring\ncoordinators will be provided with initial training about the Project, including enterprise selection\ncriteria and financial assessment methods. Later in the Project, the coordinators, together with\nselected  oblast  staff,  will  receive  more  detailed  training  in  areas  related  to  agriculture  in  a\nmarket  economy,  including  farm  economics,  finance,  and  management;  agronomy,  livestock,\nhorticulture, and rangeland management; and marketing and cooperative development.\n\nii.\n\nParticipating Banks\n\n75.\nDuring  SDP  preparation,  Kazakhstan\u2019s  main  commercial  banks  were  approached,  and\ntheir interest and capacity for participating in the Project determined. Their participation will be\nsubject  to  ADB  approval  and  to  their  meeting  the  eligibility  criteria  outlined  in  Appendix  7,\nincluding: (i) full compliance with NBK prudential requirements; (ii) sound governance, financial\nmanagement,  and  loan  tracking  systems;  (iii)  annual  audited  financial  statements,  prepared  in\naccordance  with  international  accounting  standards;  (iv)  an  adequate  branch  network  and\nhuman resources to serve the rural areas in East Kazakhstan; and (v) commitment to contribute\nat  least  15  percent  of  the  capital  to  subloans  over  the  project  period  and  to  participate  in\ncapacity-building  activities.  Following  approval  of  the  SDP,  the  PCBs  will  be  evaluated  and\nselected by MOF in close consultation with ADB.\n\n76.\nKazagroprom  has  confirmed  its  interest  in  participating  in  both  the  farm  onlending\nactivities and the project\u2019s training and capacity-building programs, and is expected to formally\napply  for  consideration  as  a  PCB  following  approval  of  the  SDP.33  Two  additional  banks\u2014\nKazkommerts  and  TuranAlem\u2014have  also  expressed  strong  interest  in  participating  in  the\nProject.  Other  banks  are  expected  to  formally  express  interest  once  the  Project  is  under  way\nand  the  RAU  is  established.  Such  participation  will  be  actively  sought  to  improve  the\ncompetitiveness of onlending. The mix of banks meeting the Project\u2019s selection criteria will have\nan  impact  on  the  types  of  subloans.  Consistent  with  its  corporate  identity  and  strategy,\nKazagroprom  would  likely  concentrate  on  subloans  to  farms  and  microenterprises,  whereas\nKazkommerts  and  TuranAlem  would  focus  more  on  loans  to  agroprocessing  enterprises,  with\nwhich they have greater experience.\n\n                                                \n33 The  East  Kazakhstan  branch  of  Kazagroprom  is  presently  managing  a  modest  agricultural  loan  portfolio  that  will\naccommodate the relatively small microenterprise loans to be provided under the Project. In addition, this bank has\nexpressed  interest  in  exploring  the  formation  of  borrower  groups  for  joint  liability  lending  during  the  Project\u2019s\nimplementation as a means of reducing both the risks and transaction costs of lending to small borrowers.\n\n\f26\n\niii.\n\nNongovernment Organizations\n\n77.\nA  significant  part  of  the  training  and  community  preparation  for  the  Project\u2019s\nmicroenterprise  activities  will  be  subcontracted  to  a  suitably  qualified  NGO  or  NGOs.  NGO\nparticipation will ensure that appropriate services are provided to the Project on a cost-effective\nbasis.  Fieldwork  and  consultations  under  the  1997  project  preparatory  TA  (footnote  1)  and\nduring  loan  processing  in  1998/99  demonstrated  that  several  NGOs  are  already  successfully\nworking  in  rural  small-scale  employment  activities  in  East  Kazakhstan.  The  NGOs  visited\nexpressed keen interest in participating in the Project's outreach and capacity-building activities.\nSince  that  time,  the  number  of  active  NGOs  has  grown  rapidly.34  In  light  of  this  growth,  the\nexperience  and  capacities  of  the  NGO  community  will  be  recanvassed  early  during  project\nimplementation. Participating NGOs will then undergo formal evaluation and recruitment through\ncompetitive tender by MOA in consultation with DOA and ADB.\n\niv.\n\nEast Kazakhstan Scientific Research Institute for Agriculture\n\nSymptomatic  of  the  agriculture  sector\u2019s  incomplete  adjustment  to  the  postprivatization\n78.\neconomic  environment,  most  of  Kazakhstan\u2019s  farms  still  rely  on  a  narrow  range  of  crop  and\nlivestock  activities  essentially  unchanged  since  the  FSU  period.  Overall,  there  has  been  little\nmarket-led  diversification  of  agriculture.  Crops  with  strong  market  potential  that  can  be\nsuccessfully  integrated  into  Kazakhstan\u2019s  farming  systems  must  be  identified.  To  accomplish\nthis, the East Kazakhstan Scientific Research Institute for Agriculture, in close coordination with\nthe  RAU,  will  participate  in  the  Project  by  undertaking  a  program  of  field  trials  and  economic\nevaluation  of  potentially  profitable,  environmentally  sustainable  new  crops.35  To  strengthen  its\ncapacity for economic analysis and its linkages to the international agricultural research system,\nthe institute will be supported under the Project\u2019s associated TA (para. 94).\n\nv.\n\nTraining Institutions\n\n79.\nTo  ensure  sustainability  and  replicability,  the  training  strategy  will  focus  initially  on\nstrengthening  the  skills  of  staff  at  East  Kazakhstan  Agricultural  College,  the  oblast\u2019s  leading\ninstitution,  in  critically  deficient  areas  such  as  agricultural  economics,  farm  management,\nmarketing,  and  cooperative  development,  as  well  as  upgrading  disciplines  such  as  crop,\nlivestock,  and  rangeland  management  in  a  market  economy.36  Following  this,  the  college  is\nexpected  to  take  on  the  major  responsibility  for  implementing  the  RAU\u2019s  training  programs  for\nfarmers and public agency personnel.\n\ne.\n\nFlow of Funds and Onlending Arrangements\n\n80.\nMOF  will  onlend  the  loan  proceeds,  together  with  the  Government\u2019s  financing  share  of\nthe credit line, to the PCBs under subsidiary loan agreements (SLAs) with market-based terms\nand  conditions  satisfactory  to  ADB.  Execution  of  an  SLA  between  MOF  and  each  PCB,  on\n\n                                                \n34 The  NGO  Confederation  of  Kazakhstan  reported  in  June  2000  that  the  country  now  has  a  total  of  about  1,000\nofficially registered NGOs (including some 110 in East Kazakhstan), and estimated that 2,000 NGOs have not yet\nofficially registered. In 1997, fewer than 250 NGOs were estimated to exist nationwide.\n\n35 The research program will focus initially on nitrogen-fixing crops with good market prospects such as soybeans and\nother legumes. Other crops that have regional or international export potential, short-season annual forage crops\nthat would utilize residual soil moisture, and medicinal plants will be studied as the program evolves.\n\n36 There  is  scope  for  collaboration  in  training  and  curriculum  development  between  East  Kazakhstan  Agricultural\nCollege  and  strong  national  institutions  such  as  the  Kazakhstan  Institute  for  Management,  Economics,  and\nPlanning, and the Institute of Agribusiness Economics, both located in Almaty.\n\n\f27\n\nterms and conditions satisfactory to the ADB, will be required prior to disbursement of funds to\nthe relevant PCB. Conditions for the proportional allocation of subloans between working capital\nand investment and for the rollover of project funds will be specified as part of each SLA. The\nPCBs  will  onlend  the  funds  to  eligible  subborrowers  under  suitable  subloan  agreements.  The\nterms and conditions for relending to the PCBs will be similar to those of the Loan Agreement\nbetween ADB and the Government, but with a maximum 15-year term and 3-year grace period,\nand  reflecting  the  cost  of  ADB  funds,  plus  an  assessed  level  of  administrative  costs  and  risk\nallowance. The onlending interest rates to be charged by the PCBs will be market-based. Loans\nto  subborrowers  will  be  made  either  in  US  dollars  or  tenge,  depending  on  the  purpose  of  the\nloan.  The  risks  of  foreign  exchange  and  interest  rate  fluctuations  will  be  borne  by  the\nsubborrowers or the PCBs concerned in accordance with arrangements satisfactory to ADB.\n\nDue  to  (i)  the  RAU\u2019s  resource  constraints,  (ii)  the  expected  high  demand  by  farms  for\n81. \nrelatively  small  loans  for  seasonal  working  capital,  and  (iii)  the  generally  satisfactory\nperformance  of  the  agriculture  sector  loan  portfolio  of  East  Kazakhstan\u2019s  potential  PCBs,  it  is\nneither  necessary  nor  desirable  for  the  RAU  to  closely  scrutinize  and  endorse  all  subloan\napplications. Therefore, it is envisioned that applicants for loans of up to $50,000 equivalent and\n12 months\u2019 duration will be able to approach the PCBs directly without review and endorsement\nby  the  RAU.  For  loans  greater  than  $50,000  equivalent,  and  for  all  investment  loans  with  a\nrepayment period exceeding 12 months, the subborrower will need to (i) prepare, in consultation\nwith the RAU, an appropriate medium-term enterprise restructuring and development plan; and\n(ii) obtain endorsement of the loan application from the RAU. In addition to RAU endorsement,\nall subloans in excess of $350,000 will be reviewed by ADB prior to approval by the PCBs. In\naddition, ADB clearance will be required for the first five subloans under the Project, regardless\nof their size.\n\nf.\n\nProject Supervision\n\nMOA  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project.  In  Astana,  MOA  will  establish  an\n82.\nadequately  staffed  project  office,  headed  by  a  suitably  qualified  director  selected  with  ADB\nagreement. In Ust-Kamenogorsk, MOA will establish a coordinating office for the Project, headed\nby  an  office  manager.  MOA  will  (i)  ensure  that  the  Project  is  implemented  in  a  manner\nconsistent with its objectives and complies with all applicable ADB guidelines and procedures;\n(ii)  coordinate  intergovernment  activities  associated  with  the  Project  in  liaison  with  MOF's\nDepartment  for  External  Loans;  (iii)  monitor  and  evaluate  PCB  lending  operations,  the  RAU\u2019s\nactivities, and consultant performance; (iv) monitor compliance with environmental assessment\nand impact mitigation measures; (v) maintain appropriate expenditure accounts and supporting\ndocumentation  for  project-related  activities;  and  (vi)  prepare,  with  inputs  from  the  PCBs,\nDepartment  for  External  Loans,  and  the  RAU,  quarterly  progress  reports  and  other  project\nreports, in formats agreed to by ADB.\n\n83.\nProject supervision at the national level will be provided by an interministerial coordination\ncommittee to be established within three months of loan effectiveness and comprising the minister\nof agriculture (chair); the project and RAU directors; and appropriate senior personnel from MOF,\nthe Ministry of Economy, AgSP, the PCBs, and the East Kazakhstan oblast administration. The\nProject monitoring and reporting responsibilities of MOA and MOF are described in paras. 85-87.\nProject coordination at the oblast level is described in para. 72.\n\n\f28\n\ng.\n\nDisbursement, Accounts, Audits, and Reports\n\n84.\nAn imprest account will be established immediately after loan effectiveness, at a bank to\nbe agreed upon by the Government and ADB. Initially $200,000 will be deposited; this is based on\nan estimate of expenditures to be incurred during the first six months of project implementation. At\nthe  option  of  the  PCB  concerned,  the  Government  may  establish  a  separate  imprest  account\n(PCB imprest account) for disbursements to each PCB for financing subprojects under the credit\ncomponent  of  the  investment  Project.  The  initial  amount  to  be  deposited  into  the  PCB  imprest\naccount  will  not  exceed  $350,000.  The  imprest  accounts  will  be  established,  managed,\nreplenished,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook  and  other\nprocedures  agreed  upon  between  the  Government,  ADB,  and  the  PCBs  concerned.  ADB\u2019s\nstatement of expenditure procedures may be used for reimbursement of eligible expenditures and\nliquidation  of  advances  to  the  imprest  accounts.  Any  individual  payment  to  be  reimbursed  or\nliquidated  under  the  statement  of  expenditure  procedures  will  not  exceed  the  equivalent  of\n$50,000.\n\nMOA  will  maintain  separate  accounts  and  financial  statements  for  the  Project,  covering\n85.\nseparately  the  activities  of  the  RAU  and  the  project  office,  which  will  be  audited  annually  by\nindependent auditors acceptable to ADB. Certified copies of the audited financial statements will\nbe submitted to ADB by MOA through MOF within nine months after the end of the fiscal year to\nwhich  they  relate.  MOF  will  submit  to  ADB  consolidated  statements  on  the  Project\u2019s  credit\ncomponent and the activities of the PCBs within a similar time period. In addition, the PCBs will\nsubmit  audited  annual  financial  statements  to  ADB,  through  MOF.  The  auditor's  report  will  also\ninclude  the  auditor's  opinion  on  use  of  the  imprest  accounts  and  the  statement  of  expenditure\nprocedure. Both the financial statements and auditor's report will be in the English language. The\nGovernment  and  MOA  were  informed  of  a  new  ADB  policy  on  submission  of  audited  accounts,\nwhich  covers  failure  to  submit  audited  accounts  and  financial  statements  within  the  due  time.  A\nformal warning will be issued for accounts more than six months overdue and disbursements will\nbe suspended for accounts that are 12 months overdue.\n\n86.\nMOA  will  provide  ADB  with  quarterly  progress  reports  on  project  implementation,  to  be\nsubmitted  within  one  month  after  the  end  of  the  quarter  to  which  they  relate,  and  such  other\nreports and information relating to the Project as ADB may reasonably request. In addition, within\nthree months after physical completion of the Project, MOA will submit to ADB, through MOF, a\nproject  completion  report  including  information  on  project  implementation,  use  of  the  loan\nproceeds, and the extent to which the project objectives have been achieved.\n\nThe Appraisal Mission judged MOA's capacity to manage the Project to be acceptable.37\n87.\nMOA has gained implementation experience during the past three years with projects financed\nby  ADB  and  the  World  Bank.  To  ensure  compliance  with  ADB  procedures  and  policies,  the\nProject provides for short-term consultants and training on an as-needed basis in areas such as\naccounting, project management, and environmental assessment.\n\nh.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n88.\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  five  years,  2000-2005,  with  completion  expected\non  or  about  30  November  2005.  The  initial  year  will  be  devoted  primarily  to  (i)  setting  up  the\n\n                                                \n37 An  assessment  of  MOA\u2019s  capabilities  will  be  undertaken  during  the  loan  inception  mission  in  line  with  ADB's\ninternal  guidelines  for  assessment  of  borrower/executing  agency  internal  control,  accounting  system,  and\ncapabilities for the use of imprest account and statement of expenditures procedures.\n\n\f29\n\nRAU,  including  recruitment  of  staff  and  consultants;  (ii)  establishing  consultative  linkages\nbetween  the  RAU  and  PCBs;  (iii)  finalizing  subcontracts  with  NGOs  based  on  an  analysis  of\nneeds in key communities; and (iv) arranging for foreign and domestic training programs. Initial\nadvisory  services  will  be  provided  to  a  core  group  of  farms  identified  during  loan  preparation.\nThe  initial  extension  of  credit  is  expected  to  occur  in  time  for  the  2002  planting  season.  From\nyear 2 the RAU will be in full operation. An average of 10-15 large farms each year will receive\ndetailed  restructuring  analyses  and  advice,  while  a  larger  group  of  smaller  farms  will  receive\ntraining  and  guidance  on  agrarian  law,  taxation,  marketing,  and  farm  business  management.\nAppendix 8 shows the envisioned implementation plan in detail.\n\ni.\n\nMidterm Review\n\nIn  addition  to  regular  review  missions,  the  Government  and  ADB  will  undertake  a\n89.\ncomprehensive  midterm  review  at  the  end  of  the  second  year  of  project  implementation  to\nscrutinize progress and achievements, identify any problems and constraints, and recommend\nmidcourse  corrections  that  may  be  warranted  to  achieve  all  objectives.  In  assessing\nperformance, the midterm review will give particular attention to (i) the realization of monitorable\nindicators;38  (ii)  impacts  of  the  policy  and  legal  reforms,  and  (iii)  the  effectiveness  of  the\nassociated TA (para. 94). The review of the Project will focus on (i) the operations of the RAU\n(relevance  and  quality  of  its  services;  numbers  of  farms  served  and  the  demand  for  RAU\nservices;  views  of  farm  managers,  rural  communities,  and  oblast  agencies  on  the  work  of  the\nconsultants;  and  prospects  for  cost  recovery);  (ii)  progress  in  farm,  agribusiness,  and\nmicroenterprise  lending,  including  appraisal  procedures,  loan  utilization,  monitoring,  and\nrepayment; and (iii) the anticipated economic and social impacts of the Project.\n\nj.\n\nBenefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n\n90.\nA  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  (BME)  system  to  monitor  progress  in  farm\nrestructuring, farm and agribusiness performance, and rural microenterprise activities will, within\nsix  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  be  established  within  the  RAU  with  the  assistance  of  the\nproject consultants. BME will include (i) the farms, agribusinesses, and microenterprises served\nby the RAU; (ii) crop and livestock productivity; (iii) farm and nonfarm employment of men and\nwomen; (iv) farm financial performance and profitability; (v) loan utilization and repayment; (vi)\nproject  environmental  impacts;  (vii)  average  incomes  and  the  incidence  of  poverty  at  the  farm\nand  community  level;  and  (viii)  the  gender-specific  impacts  of  farm  restructuring  and  the\ninterventions  supported  by  the  Project.  The  BME  system  will  be  integrated  with  the  MOA  and\nDOA  databases  used  in  the  1998  survey  of  farm  financial  performance  and  databases  to  be\nestablished as part of the market information system under the SDP.\n\n3.\n\nProcurement and Consulting Services\n\n91.\nTwo types of procurement will occur under the Project: (i) procurement by subborrowers,\nand (ii) procurement by Government agencies. Goods and services procured by subborrowers\n\n                                                \n38 Verifiable  indicators  of  SDP  performance  will  include  (i)  establishment  and  operation  of  oblast-level  information\nservices,  real  estate  registration  offices,  and  programs  for  crop  agronomic  improvement;  (ii)  comprehensiveness\nand  quality  of  studies  and  evaluations  of  property  registration,  bankruptcy,  extralegal  interventions  by  local\nadministrations,  small  business  development,  and  foreign  investment,  together  with  the  legislation  adopted  and\nother actions taken on the basis of these studies/evaluations; (iii) coverage, quality, and impact of the nationwide\npublic information and education campaign for agriculture; (iv) progress in farm restructuring, farm profitability, and\ncommercial  lending  to  agriculture,  both  nationwide  and  in  East  Kazakhstan;  and  (iv)  budgetary  expenditures  for\nirrigation operation and maintenance, credit, and agricultural inputs in the agriculture sector.\n\n\f30\n\nwill  include  agricultural  inputs  (seed,  fuel,  agrochemicals),  farm  machinery,  spare  parts,\nequipment for microenterprises, and small- and medium-size agroprocessing equipment. Such\ngoods and services will typically be procured directly in local markets by the subborrowers. The\nPCBs will be required to (i) demonstrate that the procurement procedures are appropriate in the\ncircumstances;  (ii) ensure that goods and services financed by such subloans are purchased at\na reasonable price, taking account of factors such as time of delivery, suitability and reliability of\nthe  goods,  availability  of  maintenance  facilities  and  spare  parts,  and  in  the  case  of  services,\ntheir quality and the competence of the parties rendering them; and (iii) ensure and certify that\nall  goods  procured  have  satisfied  ADB\u2019s  country-of-origin  and  eligibility  requirements.\nDepending  upon  demand,  bulk  procurement  of  inputs  and  machinery  may  prove  to  be  an\nefficient  option  and  could  be  facilitated  and  coordinated  by  the  RAU  at  the  option  of  the\nsubborrowers,  in  which  case  procurement  will  be  competitive  and  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement.\n\n92.\nProcurement by Government agencies will be limited largely to equipment and materials\nrequired  for  the  project  offices,  training,  and  vehicles  required  for  project  implementation  and\nmonitoring.  All  procurement  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for\nProcurement. Procurement of vehicles with an estimated total value in excess of $100,000 will be\nundertaken  using \ninternational  shopping  procedures.  Other  procurement  contracts  by\nGovernment  agencies  are  expected  to  cost  well  below  $100,000,  primarily  for  equipment  and\nmaterials. Since such contracts are unlikely to be of interest to international suppliers and will be\nfor  goods  that  are  available  locally  at  competitive  prices,  local  competitive  bidding  procedures\nacceptable  to  ADB  or  direct  purchase  will  be  used.  MOA  will  be  responsible  for  supervising  all\nprocurement.\n\n93.\nThe  Project  will  require  76  person-months  of  international  consulting  and  360  person-\nmonths  of  domestic  consulting  services  for  the  RAU,  and  training  and  capacity  building  in  the\nrural communities, participating banks, educational institutions, and government agencies. MOA\nwill recruit these consultants, including specialists engaged through NGOs, in collaboration with\nthe East Kazakhstan DOA and in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants\nand  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  To\nensure  that  the  best  qualified  people  are  selected,  MOA  has  agreed  that  recruitment  of  RAU\nprofessional  staff  will  involve  a  well-publicized  nationwide  search  to  be  undertaken  in\nconsultation  with  ADB.  Appendix  4  summarizes  the  terms  of  reference  for  the  international\nconsultants and for the director of the RAU.\n\nVI. \n\nTHE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\n\n94.\nThe Government asked ADB to finance advisory TA, Deepening of Agricultural Reforms\nand  Development  Programs.  The  TA  will  serve  two  distinct  purposes  in  furthering  the  SDP\u2019s\nobjectives.  It  will  (i)  facilitate  SDP  implementation  by  providing  assistance  to  MOA  and  other\nconcerned agencies (AgSP, MOF, and MOJ) with the evaluation and refinement of agricultural\npolicies  and  legislation,  and  the  design  and  preparation  of  the  market  information  system  and\nthe public information and education campaign on agriculture; and (ii) complement the Project\nby developing a program of applied agricultural research and technology dissemination focusing\non East Kazakhstan, and strengthening linkages between East Kazakhstan Scientific Research\nInstitute  for  Agriculture,  other  domestic  agricultural  research  institutions,  and  international\ninstitutes such as the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center and the International\n\n\f31\n\nCenter for Agricultural Research on Dry Areas.39 MOA will be the Executing Agency for the TA,\nwhich will be supervised by a steering committee comprising representatives from MOJ, MOF,\nMinistry of Science and Higher Education, and AgSP. The TA will require 20 person-months of\ninternational consulting and 28 person-months of domestic consulting, provided over 24 months\nestimated  to  begin  in  April  2001.  All  consultants  will  be  recruited  by  ADB  in  accordance  with\nADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the\nengagement  of  domestic  consultants.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $1,140,000  equivalent,  of\nwhich $800,000 will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded\nby the Government of Japan, and $340,000 equivalent will be provided by the Government for\nin-kind  support  and  the  costs  of  data  compilation,  land  and  materials  for  the  field  crop  trials,\ncounterpart  travel  and  per  diem,  use  of  state  television  and  radio  facilities  for  the  public\ninformation campaign, and contingencies. The Government has given assurance that adequate\nbudgetary provision for these financial costs will be made so that the TA can be implemented\nexpeditiously. Appendix 9 provides the detailed rationale, terms of reference, and costs of the\nTA.\n\nVII. \n\nBENEFITS AND RISKS\n\nA.\n\nExpected Impacts\n\n1.\n\nFinancial and Economic Analyses\n\n95.\nEmerging  private  farms  have  been  caught  in  a  low  input-low  output  equilibrium.  Most\nfarms  have  abandoned  the  use  of  fertilizers  and  agrochemicals,  and  are  unable  to  undertake\ntimely farm operations, with the result that reported yields have declined to 60-70 percent of pre-\nIndependence  levels.40  Profitability  has  worsened  for  many  farms  as  they  continue  to  face\nexcessive  labor  costs  and  social  obligations,  high  administrative  costs,  disproportionate\nmanagement  and  overhead  costs,  and  excessive  machinery  maintenance  and  repairs  due  to\naging  equipment.  With  poor  access  to  commercial  banks,  farms  have  increasingly  relied  on\nsuppliers and traders to finance their working capital requirements in exchange for farm outputs\nat  harvest.  While  these  barter  arrangements  appear  to  provide  guaranteed  markets  for  farm\noutputs, the costs of this form of financing are opaque and probably high.\n\n96.\nThe Project aims to enable private farms to improve farm productivity and achieve higher\nincome by (i) emphasizing measures to improve their commercial viability, and (ii) helping them\nformulate  viable  business  plans  that  can  be  used  when  applying  to  commercial  banks  for\nworking capital and investment loans. Farms will have to undertake several initiatives to improve\ntheir commercial and financial viability, including (i) restoring productivity rapidly; (ii) performing\nbenefit-cost analyses to guide their financial decisions; (iii) eliminating activities that contribute\nto losses; (iv) streamlining the workforce to reduce labor costs; (v) rationalizing farm machinery\noperations to reduce maintenance and repair costs; (vi) making management more efficient and\nmarket-responsive;  (vii)  introducing  a  needs-based  approach  to  minimize  administration  and\noverhead  costs;  and  (viii)  preparing,  implementing,  and  abiding  by  an  investment  and\noperational  plan  to  improve  productivity  and  realize  cost  savings.  The  negative  impacts  of  the\n\n                                                \n39 These  two  international  institutes  have  a  keen  interest  in  extending  their  programs  in  Central  Asia.  The\nInternational  Maize  and  Wheat  Improvement  Center  opened  a  country  representational  office  in  Almaty  in  June\n1998.\n\n40 The decline in productivity is real, but it must also be noted that an unknown share of the apparent yield decline is\ndue to the combined effects of (i) incomplete statistical coverage of privatized farms; (ii) difficulty recording output\ntraded under barter arrangements; and (iii) farmer reluctance to report actual production, which is taxable.\n\n\f32\n\nloss  of  direct  farm  employment  will  be  ameliorated  by  the  Project\u2019s  closely  related  support  for\nthe development of rural microenterprises.\n\nFour  indicative  models  were  developed  for  the  purpose  of  illustrating  the  financial  and\n\n97.\neconomic viability of the Project\u2019s farm and agribusiness initiatives:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\na  rain-fed  arable  farm  with  landholdings  of  4,000  ha,  consisting  of  1,920  ha  of\narable land and 2,080 ha of extensive pastures (in any given year, 20 percent of\nthe arable land is left fallow); the farm also has 100 head of beef cattle;\na rain-fed arable farm with landholdings of 10,000 ha, consisting of 5,500 ha of\narable land and 4,500 ha of extensive pastures (in any given year, 20 percent of\nthe arable land is fallow); the farm has 200 head of beef cattle;\na  beef  cattle  fattening  farm  starting  with  a  herd  of  100  head,  and  using  feed\nrations of mixed concentrates and crop by-products; and\na wheat flour mill, with an installed processing capacity of two tons of grain per\nhour, operating on two eight-hour shifts per day over 260 days a year.\n\n98.\nFinancial  internal  rates  of  return  (FIRRs)  for  farm  restructuring  and  investment  are\nestimated to be at 34.4 percent for the 4,000 ha farm, 33.4 percent for the 10,000 ha farm, and\n37.4  percent  for  the  beef  fattening  farm.  These  farms  are  anticipated  to  generate  economic\ninternal rates of return (EIRRs) of 47.5 percent (4,000 ha), 45.6 percent (10,000 ha), and 41.8\npercent (beef fattening farm). International wheat prices fell by about 15 percent in 1999. While\nwheat prices are projected to rise over the next five years, they are expected to decline over the\nlong  run.  When  a  wheat  price  decline  of  10  percent  is  applied  across  these  projections,  the\nEIRRs  fall  to  31.3  percent  (4,000  ha)  and  31.1  percent  (10,000  ha).  However,  the  FIRRs  are\nless  robust,  and  decline  to  20.2  percent  and  20.3  percent,  respectively.  When  the  projected\nyields  of  all  crops  are  reduced  by  10  percent  simultaneously,  the  FIRRs  of  these  farms  are\nreduced  to  5.1  percent  (4,000  ha)  and  4.1  percent  (10,000  ha),  although  their  EIRRs  remain\nattractive at 16.8 percent (4,000 ha) and 16.0 percent (10,000 ha). Such reductions in yield are\nunlikely if fertilizers and agrochemicals are applied at the modest levels used in the model, but\nthe  sensitivity  of  yields  reinforces  the  need  for  close  RAU  guidance  of  the  participating  farms\nand for project support to applied agronomic and economic research in East Kazakhstan.\n\n99.\nThe  viability  of  farm  restructuring  very  much  depends  on  the  overall  financial  and\ncommercial viability of the restructuring initiatives. Given the short growing season and moisture\nconstraints of the project area, successful farm restructuring must combine astute financial and\nbusiness  planning  with  sound  crop  agronomy  and  farm  management.  While  FIRRs  on\ninvestment  are  expected  to  be  well  above  the  cost  of  capital,  the  level  of  loan  financing  and\nrepayment schedules must be determined on a case-by-case basis to match the overall earning\ncapacity and cash flows of the farms. The FIRRs are sensitive to decreases in benefits and to\nincreases  in  operating  costs,  but  less  sensitive  to  increases  in  investment  costs.  A  9  percent\nincrease  in  operating  costs  would  reduce  the  FIRR  of  the  cattle  fattening  farm  to  12  percent.\nSimilarly, the FIRRs of both the 4,000 ha and 10,000 ha farms would fall to 12 percent when the\noperating costs of these farms rise by about 10 percent.\n\n100. Under the base scenario, the wheat flour mill generates an FIRR of 35.4 percent and an\nEIRR of 36.7 percent. The FIRR is moderately robust for declines in output and prices of wheat\ngrains  and  wheat  flour,  and  for  increases  in  investment  and  operating  costs.  The  FIRR  is\nsensitive  to  price  fluctuations  of  wheat  flour  when  prices  of  wheat  grains  remain  constant.\nAlthough this scenario is unlikely, the FIRR is reduced to 12 percent when benefits decline by\n7.0 percent, a case when flour prices alone decline by 7.0 percent without a similar drop in the\n\n\f33\n\nprice  of  wheat  grains.  Similarly,  the  EIRR  falls  to  31.1  percent  when  output  declines  by  10\npercent,  and  to  28.3  percent  when  wheat  grain  and  wheat  flour  prices  simultaneously  drop.\nDetails on financial and economic viability and results of the sensitivity analysis are presented in\nAppendix 10.\n\n2.\n\nImpact on Poverty\n\n101.\nThe poverty impact assessment (Appendix 11) concluded that the measures supported\nunder  the  SDP  will,  on  balance,  have  modest  net  benefits  for  the  poor,  primarily  through  the\nmechanisms  of  (i)  better  access  to  commercial  credit;  (ii)  better  informed  decision  making  on\nagriculture  through  improved  access  to  information  about  the  legal,  policy,  and  economic\nenvironment;  (iii)  more  transparent  procedures  for  farm  accounting,  property  registration,\nsecured  lending,  and  bankruptcy;  and  (iv)  greater  private  initiative  in  small  businesses  and\nvoluntary rural associations. At the same time, it must be recognized that the SDP is intended,\nfirst and foremost, to encourage market-led growth. The SDP will reinforce irreversible long-run\ntrends  in  Kazakhstan\u2019s  agriculture  that  are  inherent  in  the  country\u2019s  transition  to  a  market\neconomy,  particularly  the  rationalization  of  farm  ownership  structures  and  costs,  the  exit  from\nagriculture  of  financially  unsustainable  farms  and  redundant  labor,  and  the  elimination  of\nsubsidies  for  irrigation  and  other  inputs.  The  positive  impacts  of  this  transition  are  likely  to  be\ngreatest  and  most  rapidly  felt  in  relatively  nonpoor  regions  that  have  high  potential  for\nagricultural growth due to factors such as irrigation, soil quality, length of the growing season,\nand accessibility to markets. In contrast, the negative impacts of the transition on the poor will\nbe  largest  among  marginal  regions  and  farms.  The  Government  is  fully  cognizant  of  these\nnegative  impacts,  and  within  its  presently  severe  resource  constraints,  is  committed  to\nameliorating them. To this end, the SDP will, in coordination with the activities of other external\nassistance  agencies,  strengthen  the  Government\u2019s  capacity  to  monitor,  evaluate,  and  refine\nboth  the  content  and  the  application  of  agricultural  policies  and  legislation,  with  the  intent  of\nimproving transparency, effectiveness, and equity.\n\n102. Given the necessary scale and capital intensity of financially sustainable farming in the\nrain-fed areas of East Kazakhstan, it is inevitable that the process of farm restructuring will, at\nleast during the short run, have adverse impacts on employment in potentially vulnerable rural\ncommunities.41 But in the long run in a market economy, the creation of financially healthy farms\nis  the  only  sustainable  way  to  ensure  household  food  security  and  access  to  social  services.\nThe Project\u2019s microenterprise development initiatives will directly address the antipoor impacts\nof  the  market  transition.  The  microenterprise  activities  will,  in  the  first  instance,  be  specifically\ntargeted  at  the  communities  dependent  on  large  farms  that  initiate  a  significant  program  of\nrestructuring and downsizing of their labor force. Thus, the Project will prevent rural households\nfrom slipping into poverty. In addition, to the extent warranted by bankable demand and project\nresources, the microenterprise activities will expand to cover other regions of East Kazakhstan\nthat suffered employment losses through farm restructuring and bankruptcy prior to the Project.\nOver  the  life  of  the  Project,  it  is  envisioned  that  at  least  200  microenterprises  and  small\nbusinesses  including  craft  industries  and  women\u2019s  groups  will  be  supported  in  over  60  rural\ncommunities.  The  Project  will  train  about  50  community  development  workers  and  200\napprentices  in  craft  and  services  industries.  A  quick  start-up  for  this  component  is  assured\n\n                                                \n41 Although there will be loss of direct employment, most rural households will continue to own shares in the farms.\nHence, during the medium term, the loss of direct labor income should be at least partially offset by the increasing\ndividends paid to shareholders as the farms become more profitable. Alternatively, households that are successful\nin finding new nonfarm employment may opt to sell their farm shares.\n\n\f34\n\nbecause it has been designed to complement and build on the oblast\u2019s ongoing Regional Fund\nfor Support to the Low-Income Population.\n\nB.\n\nRisks and Safeguards\n\n103. Given  Kazakhstan\u2019s  rapid  macroeconomic  and  institutional  transition  and  frequent\nchanges  in  key  Government  personnel,  the  SDP\u2019s  major  risk  is  that  the  Government\u2019s\ncommitment  to  full  program  implementation  falters.  However,  the  ASP  (footnote  6)  was\nimplemented  successfully  during  a  similar  period  of  rapid  change  (footnote  24).  More\nimportantly, the reforms supported by the SDP build directly on the constraints identified in farm\nand  rural  community  consultations,  as  well  as  the  sector  analyses  and  medium-term  strategic\nagenda prepared by MOA and other agencies. Nonetheless, several SDP measures\u2014budgets\nfor  the  agricultural  information  initiatives  and  for  irrigation  operation  and  maintenance\nfinancing\u2014depend  on  approval  by  Kazakhstan\u2019s  Parliament,  thus,  there  is  an  element  of\npolitical uncertainty.\n\nThe  investment  Project  faces  a  number  of  macro  and  micro  risks  to  successful\n104.\nimplementation  and  the  attainment  of  anticipated  benefits.  Kazakhstan\u2019s  macroeconomic\ndifficulties\u2014entailing  budgetary  constraints  and  some  uncertainty  in  the  exchange  rate  and\nfinancial  sector\u2014are  likely  to  persist  for  at  least  the  next  one  or  two  years.  These  difficulties\nlead to risks of counterpart funding shortfalls, as well as to greater caution among commercial\nbanks in lending to risky sectors like agriculture. It is beyond the scope of the Project to directly\naddress such risks, but at the same time, they are considered manageable and worth taking.42\nThe  Government  has  provided  assurances  that  adequate  counterpart  funding  will  be  provided\nfor the Project. Recently the Government has (i) initiated endeavors to improve the quality of the\npublic expenditure program; (ii) limited new external borrowing within the ceiling established by\nthe International Monetary Fund under the enhanced fund facility; and (iii) initiated a review of\nongoing  foreign-funded  projects,  in  order  to  cancel  projects  that  do  not  meet  criteria  for\nimpact/effectiveness,  return  on  investment,  and  sustainability.  At  a  time  of  great  pressure  on\nforeign exchange reserves, rationing of dollars is a risk, but NBK has consistently reiterated the\nGovernment\u2019s  commitment  to  a  freely  traded  tenge.  Indeed,  the  depreciation  of  the  tenge  will\nbring  significant  benefits  to  sectors  like  agriculture,  which  produce  tradable  goods.  Finally,\ndespite  the  financial  sector  uncertainty,  several  commercial  banks  have  expressed  strong\ninterest  in  participating  in  the  Project,  and  more  are  expected  to  do  so  once  the  Project  is\nactually under way.\n\nThe  micro  risks  were  addressed  in  the  project  design.  Given  the  scarcity  of  rural\n105.\nbusiness  skills  suited  to  the  needs  of  a  market  economy,  it  is  unlikely  that  a  credit  line  alone\nwould  be  either  disbursed  or  utilized  efficiently.  Hence,  the  Project  provides  a  package  of\nmutually  complementary  advisory  and  financial  support.  Nonetheless,  there  are  risks  that  the\nrural  enterprises  may  not  perform  as  expected  if  they  do  not  implement  agreed-upon\nmanagement practices, including land use, cropping patterns, and inputs. The Project\u2019s financial\nand  economic  analyses  assume  conservative  yields,  well  below  the  potential  of  good  farm\nmanagement  in  the  project  area.  The  Project  and  the  associated  TA  will  initiate  and  support\nefforts  to  locally  adapt  and  extend  improved  crop  technology  to  the  farms.  It  is  believed  that\nproductivity can be readily improved if farming operations are performed correctly with modest\nlevels  of inputs.  The farms will  be required to adopt and implement agreed upon restructuring\nprograms  on  a  phased  basis;  failure  to  do  so  will  result  in  termination  of  credit  facilities.  The\n\n                                                \n42 There are significant risks in doing nothing. Continuing farm and rural stagnation are to be expected in the absence\n\nof public support to restore productivity and promote growth.\n\n\f35\n\nRAU  will  have  responsibility  for  monitoring  the  restructuring  and  onlending  processes,  and\nkeeping  financial  institutions  informed.  Financing  institutions  may  also  be  required  to  provide\ncrop insurance.\n\n106. Although  the  RAU  will  be  established  within  agencies  of  the  oblast  administration,  its\ncredibility in the eyes of participating farms and the commercial banks will depend critically on\nits  objectivity  and  strict  application  of  the  eligibility  and  financial  criteria  for  the  identification,\nappraisal,  and  endorsement  of  subloans.  The  importance  of  the  RAU\u2019s  independence  is\nacknowledged by both national and local authorities, whose commitment to this independence\nwas  reconfirmed  during  the  Appraisal  Mission,  when  a  framework  and  timetable  for  the  legal\nestablishment of the RAU was agreed upon. Intensive monitoring by ADB is required during the\nProject\u2019s  first  year  of  implementation  to  get  the  RAU  up  and  running,  to  ensure  smooth\nconsultant recruitment and mobilization, and to advise on the terms and execution of SLAs with\nthe commercial banks.\n\n107. Even if the expected productivity is achieved, lack of credit discipline by borrowers could\ncontribute to poor loan repayment. To reduce this risk, borrowers will be carefully assessed and\nrequired  to  contribute  an  equity  share  in  any  investment.  The  RAU  must  contribute  to  an\nobjective,  rigorous  analysis  of  potential  loans  by  applying  strict  financial  and  economic  criteria\nthat have been missing from the farm privatization process to date. This approach is designed\nto ensure the recovery of costs that is central to the Government's borrowing strategy.\n\n108.\nThe commercial banks will contribute their own resources to the onlending and bear the\nrisk  of  loan  default.  Thus,  disbursement  under  the  Project  will  be  slowed  if  the  banks  prove\nexcessively  cautious  in  lending.  The  training  and  capacity  building  provided  to  bank  staff,  and\nthe  RAU\u2019s  roles  in  encouraging  the  formation  of  stable  farm  structures  and  in  screening  large\nloans are intended to reduce this risk. Moreover, the policy component is specifically designed\nto encourage greater commercial lending to agriculture by leveling the playing field for the banks\nin respect of the legal framework for secured lending, farm accounting and auditing, liquidation,\nand bankruptcy.\n\n109. Some farmers may not wish to become involved with the Project if it means rationalizing\nor  divesting  of  their  traditional  activities.  This  is  the  prerogative  of  the  farm  managers  and\nshareholders. While the SDP, including the Project, include measures to inform shareholders of\ntheir options and the benefits of farm restructuring, the Project will only support farms and rural\ncommunities that are motivated and willing to accept the proposed changes.\n\n110.\nThe provision of working capital should enable farm enterprises to free themselves from\nbarter deals and trade freely for cash. However, farmers may not wish to do so if there is a risk\nof tax authorities seizing cash in bank accounts. While the Project will require the use of a bank\naccount,  the  policy  component  will  require  the  adoption  of  sound,  transparent  accounting  and\nauditing practices, as well as continued reform of tax policy and administration. The Project will\nwork primarily with farms that have revenue-generating potential to repay any outstanding debt;\nif successful, these farms will face reduced risk of having their bank deposits seized.\n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances\n\nVIII.\n\nASSURANCES\n\nThe Government has given the following specific assurances, in addition to the standard\n\n111.\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents.\n\n\f(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n36\n\n1.\n\nFor the policy loan, assurances include the following:\n\nThe  policies  adopted  and  actions  taken  as  detailed  in  the  development\npolicy  letter  will  continue  throughout  the  implementation  period  of  the\npolicy component and subsequently.\nThe  policies  and  actions  set  out  in  the  development  policy  letter  will  be\ncarried out in accordance with the schedule of policy reforms detailed in\nthe policy matrix (Appendix 3).\nThe counterpart funds generated from the proceeds of the policy loan will\nbe  used  by  the  Government  to  finance  the  implementation  of  the  SDP\u2019s\npolicy reforms.\n\n2. \n\nFor the investment loan, assurances include the following:\n\nPrior  to onlending by PCBs of the investment loan proceeds (a) the first\nfive  subloans  and  all  subloans  greater  than  $350,000  will  be  reviewed\nand  approved  by  ADB;  (b)  an  acceptable  summary  initial  environmental\nexamination,  in  accordance  with  ADB  guidelines,  will  be  submitted  to\nADB for all agroprocessing subloans in excess of $100,000.\nThe Project will be accorded high priority and included as a specific line\nitem  for  annual  budgetary  allocations,  and  such  annual  budgetary\nallocations will be made available on a timely basis.\nDuring  project  implementation,  the  RAU  will  be  organized  and  managed\nto promote maximum autonomy and independence in its decision-making,\nadministrative,  and  operational  activities  and  will  have  adequate\nresources and staff to carry out its assigned activities in an effective and\ntimely manner.\nEmployees of public agencies who receive training under the Project will\nbe obligated to remain in service for at least one year after such training,\neither  in  their  originally  assigned  positions  under  the  Project  or  in  a\ncapacity relevant to the training provided.\n\nfarm  and  agribusiness  performance,  and \n\n(v)  Within  six  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  a  BME  system  satisfactory  to\nADB  will  be  established  within  the  RAU  to  monitor  progress  in  farm\nrestructuring, \nrural\nmicroenterprise activities supported by the Project.

During  project  implementation,  specific  attention  will  be  given  to  management  of\nagroprocessing  wastes,  and  to  improved  soil  and  water  quality.  By  and  large,  current  farming\nsystems  are  financially  unsustainable.  To  be  eligible  for  project  support,  farms  will  implement\nsound  financial  practices  and  more  sustainable  management  of  soils,  water,  and  the\nlandscape.1 Higher productivity levels will increase the incomes of farms, farm employees, and\nshareholders. Families losing direct farm employment will be given the opportunity to establish\nalternative  income-generating  activities.  The  enhanced  welfare  of  rural  communities  will  slow\nthe migration to urban areas and even the total abandonment of some villages. Finally, higher\nrural  incomes  will  reduce  pressure  on  natural  resources.  Table  A6  summarizes  the  Project\u2019s\nmain  potential  environmental  impacts  and  the  corresponding  monitoring  and  mitigation\nmeasures.  A  more  detailed  assessment  is  presented  in  the  supplementary  Summary  Initial\nEnvironmental Examination report, which is available on request.\n\nTable A6: Summary of Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n\nProject Activity and Potential Impacts\n\nMonitoring and Mitigation Measures\n\nFarm Restructuring and Development\nAgrochemical use is projected to rise from very low\nlevels  at  present  to  moderate  levels  as  a  result  of\nthe  Project,  e.g.,  to  about  50  kilograms  of  nutrient\nequivalent per hectare of all fertilizers, and modest\namounts of environmentally sound herbicides.\n\nSoil  erosion  caused  by  wind  and  water  runoff  is  a\nrisk  in  steeply  sloping  areas  due  to  inappropriate\ncultivation practices. Since 1994, there has been a\nmarked  deterioration  in  the  observance  of  various\nsoil-conserving  recommendations.  The  generally\npoor profitability of farms has led to a breakdown of\nrotations,  and  cultivation  has  not  been  timely.  All\nhave contributed to reduced soil cover.\n\nWater management is not a significant issue since\nirrigation is a very minor input in East Kazakhstan\u2019s\nagriculture. However, the technical potential for\ngroundwater irrigation exists in some low-lying\nregions and may become financially justifiable as\nthe result of farm diversification and improved\nprofitability.\n\nThe Rural Advisory Unit (RAU) will monitor the use\nof  agrochemicals  and  other  environmental  aspects\nas  part  of  the  Project\u2019s  benefit  monitoring  and\nevaluation  system.  The  RAU  will  assist  the  oblast\nDepartment  of  Ecology  and  Bioresources \nin\nmonitoring \nGovernment\nregulations on permissible herbicides.\n\ncompliance \n\nwith \n\nSlope  and  soil  quality  will  be  used  as  subproject\nselection  criteria.  Farmland  not  meeting  these\ncriteria  will  be  excluded  from  project  support.  The\nProject  will  reintroduce  the  use  of  sustainable\nrotations.  The  adoption  of  more  diverse  cropping\nsystems,  minimum  tillage  technologies,  and  sound\nrotations  will  also  help  restore  and  maintain  soil\nfertility,  and  reduce  the  incidence  of  weeds,  crop\npests,  and  diseases.  Overall,  the  use  of  marginal\nland  for  annual  cultivation  is  expected  to  decline\nsignificantly as a result of the Project.\n\nIf  farmer  demand  exists  and  is  financially  and\nenvironmentally  justified,  the  RAU  will  advise  on\nthe  evaluation  of  sound  technologies  and  on\nformation  of  a  model  water  user  association  to\ndevelop  and  manage  a  small  pump  irrigation\nsystem  in  one  of  the  oblast\u2019s  well-suited  regions.\nMonitoring  of  water  quality  will  also  be  undertaken\nin \nany \nconcerned  with  water\nmanagement.\n\nsubproject \n\n1 Appendix 7 provides a description of enterprise and subloan eligibility criteria.\n\n\f64\n\nAppendix 6, page 2\n\nProject Activity and Potential Impacts\n\nMonitoring and Mitigation Measures\n\nAgribusiness Support\nWaste disposal. Increased wastes and effluents are\npossible as a result of subloans for agroprocessing\nand farm machinery services.\n\nSubloan  proposals  will  be  reviewed  by  the  RAU,\nand  will  include  provisions  for  environmentally\nsound waste disposal. In many cases, by-products\nwill have their own markets, e.g., for livestock feed.\nSubmission of an initial environmental examination\nin accordance with Asian Development Bank (ADB)\nguidelines  will  be  required  for  ADB  clearance  of\nagroprocessing  subloans  in  excess  of  $100,000.\nOther  agroprocessing  subloans  will  comply  with\napplicable  Government  and  ADB  environmental\nguidelines.  Certification  of  such  compliance  will  be\nmaintained  as  part  of \nloan  records.  Effluent\ndisposal  will  be  subject  to  monitoring  to  prevent\ndischarge of untreated effluent into watercourses.\n\nThe  small-scale  and  dispersed  nature  of \nthe\nmicroenterprise  activities  is  expected  to  preclude\nany  significant  increase  in  waste  and  effluent\nproblems. Barnyard wastes are presently the major\nsource  of  fertilizer.  The  RAU  will  monitor  the\nutilization and impact of microenterprise subloans.\n\nMicroenterprise Component\nWaste disposal. Increased wastes and effluents are\npossible as a result of microenterprise subloans for\nactivities  such  as  livestock  raising  on  household\nplots and small-scale craft industries.\n\n\f65\n\nAppendix 7, page 1\n\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR PARTICIPATING COMMERCIAL BANKS,\nFARMS, AND AGRIBUSINESS ENTERPRISES\n\nA.\n\nEligibility Criteria for Participating Commercial Banks\n\n1.\nThrough participating commercial banks (PCBs), the Project will provide a credit line to\nprivate farms and agribusiness enterprises that can demonstrate financially viable farming and\ncommercial  activities.

The  country  is  capable  of  producing  for  a  population\nfar larger than the domestic market. At present, however, the sector is performing well below its\npotential because of the farms\u2019 incomplete adjustment to the postprivatization environment and\nthe  failure,  so  far,  to  establish  strong  linkages  to  new  markets  outside  of  the  former  Soviet\nUnion.  Crops  with  market  potential  that  can  be  successfully  integrated  into  Kazakhstan\u2019s\nfarming  systems  must  be  identified.  However,  the  country\u2019s  agricultural  research  system__in\ndisarray for several years__will need support if it is to contribute to the transition. The process of\nreestablishing  the  research  system  must  focus  on  the  new  opportunities  offered  by  domestic\nand  international  markets.  Equally  important  is  the  need  to  encourage  more  widespread\nknowledge and understanding within rural communities of the legal basis and options for farm\nrestructuring  and  other  rural  economic  activities.  Finally,  the  Government  needs  assistance  in\ncarefully evaluating the implementation and impact of the market reforms, in order to refine, as\nappropriate, the policy and legislative framework for market-led agriculture. The objective of the\ntechnical assistance (TA) is to assist the Government in undertaking all of these tasks.\n\nB. \n\nDescription of Tasks\n\n1.\n\nProgram for Agronomic Field Trials for High-Potential Crops\n\n2.\nThis  component  of  the  TA  will  (i)  identify  opportunities  for  crop  development  and  the\ndiversification  of  cropping  systems  in  Kazakhstan;  (ii)  strengthen  linkages  between  national\nagricultural research agencies and relevant institutions associated with the Consultative Group\nfor  International  Agricultural  Research  (CGIAR);  and  (iii)  upgrade  national  applied  agricultural\nresearch  skills  by  participating  in  a  crop  trials  program  and  training  at  selected  international\ninstitutes.  The  component  will  be  implemented  over  two  years  and  will  include  (i)  review  of\nrecent  agricultural  research  in  Kazakhstan,  (ii)  implementation  of  an  agronomic  and  economic\nevaluation  program  for  selected  crops  in  East  Kazakhstan  oblast,  and  (iii)  development  of  a\nmedium-term  (3-5  years)  program  for  applied  research,  information  diffusion,  and  institutional\ndevelopment  for  the  national  agricultural  institutes  in  cooperation  with  relevant  CGIAR\ninstitutions.1  The  TA  will  be  coordinated  by  a  field  crop  agronomist  and  an  economist  in\ncollaboration  with  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  (MOA),  the  Kazakhstan  Academy  of  Sciences'\nNational Academic Center for Agrarian Research, and its satellite institute, the East Kazakhstan\nScientific Research Institute for Agriculture (EKSRIA), which is located in Ust-Kamenogorsk and\nhas extensive experimental sites around the oblast. The specific tasks of the experts include the\nfollowing.\n\n                                                \n1  These  might  include  the  International  Maize  and  Wheat  Improvement  Center  (CIMMYT)  and  the  International\nCenter  for  Agricultural  Research  on  Dry  Areas  (ICARDA),  both  of  which  have  keen  interest  in  extending  their\nprograms in Central Asia. CIMMYT opened a country representational office in Almaty in June 1998.\n\n\f70\n\nAppendix 9, page 2\n\na. \n\nCrop Trials Program\n\n3.\n\nThe tasks include\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nreview  the  farming  systems  and  agricultural  practices  in  East  Kazakhstan,\nidentifying the major agronomic constraints to higher productivity;\nwith  the  assistance  of  the  Rural  Advisory  Unit  (RAU),  and  oblast  and  raion\ndepartments of agriculture, identify a short list of possible crops and varieties that\ncould potentially be integrated into the existing farming systems;2 and\ndesign and implement a two-year program of field trials, analyze the results, and\npresent the findings in a technical report.\n\nb. \n\nEconomic Assessment\n\n4.\n\nThe consultants will\n\nrelate the crop trial results to current and potential farming systems and, with the\nassistance of the RAU, assess the economic prospects for adoption;\nprovide  a  detailed  economic  justification  for  any  recommendations  to  promote\nparticular crops, focusing on their market potential and suitability for the existing\nfarming systems;\nassess  the  capacity  of  the  research  institute  to  undertake  similar  work,  and\nformulate  detailed  recommendations  on  the  need,  design,  and  resource\nrequirements of follow-on applied research programs that could be implemented\nlargely by oblast agricultural agencies; and\nprepare a summary report for the Government and the Asian Development Bank\n(ADB).\n\nc. \n\nInstitutional Development\n\n5.\n\nTasks include\n\narrange  short-term  training  for  domestic  research  staff  at  selected  international\nagricultural  research  institutes  to  become  familiar  with  their  research  programs\nand to establish cooperative links;\nassess EKSRIA\u2019s capacity to sustain the field trial program and, consistent with\npresent  budgetary  realities  in  Kazakhstan;  and  prepare  recommendations  for\nskills upgrading, facilities development, and realistic financing mechanisms; and\nexplore and promote within the funding community interest in contributing to this\ndevelopment.\n\n2.\n\nRefining and Promoting Understanding of Agricultural Legislation\n\n6.\nNationwide  in  scope,  this  TA  component  will  promote  wider  understanding  within\nKazakhstan\u2019s  rural  communities  of  the  new  legal  and  institutional  environment  for  agriculture,\nand  will  contribute  to  the  refinement  of  legislation  related,  among  others,  to  farm  and  land\n\n                                                \n2 These crops include  various legumes and medicinal plants such as camomile, fennel, and calendula; other crops\nthat have regional or international export potential based on CGIAR experience; and short-season annual forage\ncrops.\n\n\f71\n\nAppendix 9, page 3\n\nownership,  secured  lending,  agricultural  bankruptcy,  the  legal  rights  of  farms  and  small\nbusinesses, and the formation of voluntary rural associations.\n\na.\n\nInformation Dissemination\n\n7.\nThis  component  will  assist  the  Government  in  designing,  preparing,  and  evaluating  a\nnationwide  public  information  and  education  campaign  on  the  legal  and  policy  framework  for\nagriculture,  which  will  disseminate  knowledge  through  publications,  state  and  private  mass\nmedia (newspapers, television, and radio), and training courses and seminars.

Background\n\n1.\nThe  Project  aims  to  enable  private  farms  to  improve  productivity  and  achieve  higher\nincomes by (i) promoting measures to improve their commercial viability, and (ii) assisting these\nfarms in formulating viable business plans for submission to commercial banks so as to obtain\nworking  capital  and  investment  loans  to  be  provided  under  the  Project.  Although  it  is  not\npossible  to  predetermine the  types  and  composition  of  investment  plans  that  will  be  financed\nthrough  the  line  of  credit,  the  approach  adopted  for  the  financial  and  economic  analyses  is  to\npresent indicative farm and agribusiness models that represent potential and typical situations in\nEast Kazakhstan. Four indicative models were developed (details presented in Supplementary\nAppendix E).\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nA rain-fed farm with landholdings of 4,000 hectares (ha), consisting of 1,920 ha\nof arable land and 2,080 ha of extensive pastures. In any given year, 20 percent\nof the arable land is left fallow. The farm also has 100 beef cattle.\nA rain-fed farm with landholdings of 10,000 ha, consisting of 5,500 ha of arable\nland  and  4,500  ha  of  extensive  pastures.  In  any  given  year,  20  percent  of  the\narable land is left fallow. The farm also has 200 beef cattle.\nA  beef  cattle  fattening  farm,  starting  up  with  a  herd  of  100,  with  feed  rations\nutilizing mixed concentrates and crop by-products.\nA wheat flour mill, with an installed processing capacity of 2 tons (t) of grain per\nhour, operating on two eight-hour shifts per day over 260 days a year.\n\nB.  Major Assumptions\n\nWithout the Project, the cropping pattern is expected to continue with winter and spring\n2.\nwheat  (48  percent),  other  cereals  (25  percent),  and  sunflowers  (7  percent).  With  the  Project,\nonly minor changes in cropping patterns are expected, with more timely farm operations to allow\nfor a modest increase to 15 percent for sunflowers. Also with the Project, only minor medium-\nterm  changes  in  cropping  patterns  are  expected.  As  the  result  of  improved  capacity  for  more\ntimely farm operations, winter wheat would tend to substitute for spring wheat, in turn permitting\nlarger areas to be planted to relatively profitable sunflowers. Without the Project, crop yields are\nexpected  to  remain  low,  on  average  below  1.0  t/hectare  without  significant  applications  of\nfertilizers.  With  low  rainfalls,  only  small  amounts  of  fertilizers  (10-25  kg  of  Nitrogen  and\nPhosphorus nutrient contents) are needed. With the Project, crop yields are expected to level off\nby  year  3:  winter  wheat,  1.8  t/ha;  spring  wheat,  1.7  t/ha;  barley,  1.7  t/ha;  winter  rye,  1.7  t/ha;\nbuckwheat, 0.9 t/ha; peas, 0.8 t/ha; and sunflowers, 1.3 t/ha.\n\n3.\nLocal inflation is projected at 10 percent per year for 2000-2002, and 6 percent per year\nfrom  2003.  Foreign  inflation  is  assumed  to  follow  the  World  Bank\u2019s  projection  of  the\nmanufacturing unit value indices (MUV). Foreign inflation is projected 2.5 percent in year 2000,\n2.3 percent in 2005, and 2.48 percent in 2010.\n\n4.\nBoth  financial  and  economic  analyses  are  conducted  over  10  years  in  2000  constant\nprices and in the local currency, tenge (T). Year 1 represents 2001, the year in which the Project\nis expected to commence. The exchange rate is assumed at T144 to $1.00 (actual, July 2000).\nAdjusting  for  inflation,  projected  profit  and  loss  statements,  cash  flows,  and  debt  service\ncalculations are presented in current terms.\n\n\f76\n\nAppendix 10, page 2\n\nWheat  and  fertilizer  prices  are  projected  using  the  World  Bank\u2019s  commodity  price\n5.\nprojections  (January  2000).  Various  adjustments  for  transport,  handling,  storage,  insurance,\nmarketing margins, and physical losses are made to determine farm-gate prices. The economic\nand financial farm-gate prices of urea and phosphate, as derived on an import parity basis, are\nexpressed in terms of nitrogen and phosphorus nutrient contents.\n\n6.\nKazakhstan  is  a  wheat  exporting  country.  Its  wheat  exports  to  the  Russian  Federation\ncompete with wheat exports from the United States and Canada. Faced with low international\nwheat prices, vast distances to major markets, and high intermediary costs, financial farm-gate\nprices  of  wheat  of  average  grades  are  expected  to  remain  at  about  $60/t  in  2000.  However,\nwheat  prices  are  expected  to  strengthen  over  the  next  five  years.  In  local  markets,  farm-gate\nprices of barley and rye are priced 10 percent lower than wheat prices. Prices of wheat flour of\ngrade 1 (premium) and grade 2 qualities at the mill-gate are projected at 200 and 160 percent,\nrespectively,  of  wheat  prices  at  the  elevators  gate.  Wheat  prices  at  the  mill-gate  include\ntransport,  drying,  storage,  losses,  and  elevator's  margin.  Sunflower  seeds  are  anticipated  to\nremain  firm  at  about  T27,500  ($190.97)  per  ton  in  2000  at  farm  gate.  Sunflower  prices  are\nclosely correlated with international prices of soybeans.\n\n7.\nThe economic analysis is based on the world price level numeraire. Adjustments mainly\nreflect  removal  of  taxes,  duties,  and  debt  service  charges,  and  the  application  of  a  standard\nconversion factor (SCF) of 0.95 on nontraded inputs and outputs. Farm wages in mid-2000 in\nEast Kazakhstan are estimated to vary from T165/day for seasonal unskilled labor to T440/day\nfor  skilled  labor.  Given  a  situation  where  there  is  less  than  full  employment  in  the  rural  areas,\nand that farms are expected to restructure, operate more efficiently, and employ less people, a\nshadow wage rate factor of 0.9 is applied. Consequently, a conversion factor of 0.855 is applied\non labor costs.\n\nC.  Incomes and Rates of Return\n\n1.\n\nRain-Fed Farm (4,000 ha)\n\n8.\nWithout restructuring, the farm would incur net operating losses in constant 2000 terms\nof  about  T2.1  million  in  year  1,  T1.4  million  in  year  2,  and  T1.2  million  in  year  3.  Apart  from\nagronomic  improvements  and  adjustments  to  the  cropping  pattern,  key  restructuring  initiatives\nassumed in the model are the following:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nRationalize fuel consumption by introducing disciplinary measures to restrict use\nof  tractors  and  vehicles  to  farming  purposes  only.  Fuel  savings  of  about  15\npercent can be realized over five years.\nIncrease labor productivity so that labor requirements during peak periods can be\nreduced  by  about  18  percent  over  five  years,  from  a  workforce  of  45  to  37\npeople.  A  15-20  percent  reduction  in  the  workforce  is  considered  modest,  as\nemerging private farms still grapple with an underutilized permanent workforce.\nRationalize the labor force, minimize redundant labor, reduce social obligations,\nand engage seasonal workers for peak seasons.\nReduce  management  and  administration  costs,  including  the  cost  of  surplus\nlabor, by more than 40 percent over three years \u2014 T770/ha to T440/ha in 2000\nconstant  terms.  Management  and  administrative  costs  are  frequently  excessive\nprimarily due to overstaffing and privileges enjoyed by managers and staff.\nImprove discipline on preventive maintenance, and undertake an investment plan\nto  replace  and  recondition  machinery  and  equipment.  Maintenance  and  repair\n\n\f77\n\nAppendix 10, page 3\n\ncosts  of  equipment  could  reasonably  be  reduced  by  about  28  percent  over  two\nyears from $18/ha of arable land to $13/ha in constant 2000 terms.\n\n9.\nAn  initial  investment  of  about  T31  million  in  2000  terms  ($215,000)  was  broadly\nestimated for the farm. This investment plan is assumed to be phased over three years: $90,000\nin year 1, $72,000 in year 2, and $53,000 in year 3. These initial investments are indicative in\nnature,  and  primarily  include  urgent  replacement  of  aging  farm  equipment  and  provisions  for\nspare parts. Farms of this size are assumed to have existing fixed assets, which are revalued\nconservatively at T15 million. Additionally, the farm is expected to spend T16 million ($111,000)\nin 2000 terms for further equipment replacements over a period of four years from year 7.\n\n10. With  the  above  restructuring  initiatives,  including  measures  to  improve  crop  yields  and\nlivestock  performance,  the  farm  can  potentially  generate  a  net  operating  income,  in  constant\n2000 terms, of T3.2 million in year 1, T6.5 million in year 2, and T9.1 million in year 3. By year 3,\nthe  farm  would  be  able  to  produce  1,650  t  of  wheat,  98  tons  of  barley,  98  t  of  rye,  104  t  of\nbuckwheat,  56  t  of  peas,  and  374  t  of  sunflower  seeds.  However,  net  operating  incomes  are\nexpected to decline, in constant 2000 terms, from about T9.9 million in year 6 to T8.3 million in\nyear 10. This decline is primarily due to projected shifts in input and output prices.\n\n11.\nTo estimate financial internal rates of return (FIRR) on investments before financing, and\neconomic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRR),  incremental  operating  incomes  are  projected  under\ntwo scenarios:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nCase  1.  In  this  scenario,  without  the  Project,  the  farm  is  allowed  to  incur  net\noperating  losses  for  a  maximum  period  of  three  years,  after  which  the  farm\nceases  to  operate.  Continuing  losses  are  not  sustainable.  Estimation  of\nincremental benefits due to the Project includes forgone financial losses of these\nthree years only.\nCase 2. In this scenario incremental benefits due to the Project exclude the Case\n1 forgone losses. Without restructuring initiatives as proposed under the Project,\nthe  farm  ceases  to  operate  immediately,  and  therefore  net  operating  income\nwithout the Project is assumed at zero level.\n\n12.\nCase  1  illustrates  an  upper  limit  for  deriving  benefits  that  can  be  attributed  to  project\ninitiatives. Farms may in fact sustain operating losses over a period longer than three years by\nselling  off  its  assets  and  relying  heavily  on  mounting  debts  and  arrears  to  their  creditors,\nincluding their workers through unpaid wages. The prevalent barter trade also complicates the\nassessment of continuing financial insolvency. Conservatively, for the purpose of this analysis, a\nthree-year limit to operating losses is considered the maximum for the without-project scenario.\n\nUnder  Case  1,  the  FIRR  before  financing  is  estimated  at  46.8  percent.  Assuming  an\n13.\nopportunity  cost  of  capital  of  12  percent  per  annum,  the  financial  net  present  value  (NPV)\namounts  to  T18.0  million.  Correspondingly,  the  EIRR  is  estimated  at  52.1  percent  and  the\neconomic NPV at T22.3 million. The FIRR and EIRR are considerably high mainly because of\nthe  incremental  benefits  due  to  forgone  losses.  Under  Case  2,  when  forgone  losses  are\nexcluded  from  the  incremental  benefits,  the  FIRR  and  financial  NPV  are  estimated  at  34.4\npercent and T14.1 million, respectively. The EIRR and the economic NPV are at 47.5 percent\nand  T21.2  million,  respectively.  Under  both  cases,  the  FIRRs  before  financing  are  significant.\nFarms  of  this  size  in  East  Kazakhstan  generally  have  significant  underutilized  resources.  The\nproposed  investment  plan  is  complementary  to  existing  assets.  This  incremental  capital\ninvestment,  combined  with  small  increases  in  direct  expenses  in  the  form  of  fertilizers,\n\n\f78\n\nAppendix 10, page 4\n\nagrochemical,  and  improved  seeds,  enables  these  farms  to  capture  significant  benefits  from\nrapid increases in crop yields and cost savings induced by the restructuring initiatives.\n\n2. \n\nRain-Fed Farm (10,000 ha)\n\n14.\nSimilar  restructuring  measures  can  be  introduced  to  large  farms  10,000  ha  in  size.\nWithout restructuring, farms of this size would suffer from unsustainable net operating losses of\nabout T7.4 million in constant 2000 terms over three years. An initial investment of about T90.7\nmillion  in  2000  constant  terms  ($630,000)  over  three  years  is  required:  $282,000  in  year  1,\n$198,000 in year 2, and $150,000 in year 3. This investment includes replacement of equipment\nand  spare  parts.  The  farm  is  assumed  to  have  existing  fixed  assets  of  about  T30  million.  The\nfarm  can  potentially  generate  net  operating  incomes,  expressed  in  constant  2000  terms,  of\nabout T10.2 million in year 1, T19.5 million in year 2, and T26.7 million in year 3. However with\nunfavorable  shifts  in  input  and  output  prices,  net  operating  incomes  are  expected  to  decline\nfrom about T29.0 million in year 6 to T24.4 million in year 10.\n\nSimilar  to  the  4,000  ha  model,  FIRRs  before  financing  and  EIRRs  on  investments  are\n15.\nestimated  under  two  cases,  although  in  reality  there  is  a  continuum  of  possibilities  between\nthese two cases. Under the case 1 assumption, the FIRR before financing is estimated at 39.7\npercent with a financial NPV of T43.7 million, while the EIRR is higher at 44.6 percent with an\neconomic NPV of T55.4 million. Under case 2, when forgone financial losses are excluded from\nthe  incremental  benefits,  the  FIRR  declines  to  33.4  percent  with  a  financial  NPV  of  T37.6\nmillion.  However,  the  EIRR  in  case  2  is  not  lower  than  that  in  case  1.  When  converted  into\neconomic prices, the farm (without the Project) does not incur economic net operating losses.\nInstead, the farm generates economic net operating incomes of about T2.2 million in constant\n2000  terms  over  the  three  years.  Consequently,  the  EIRR  of  45.6  percent  in  case  2  is  higher\nthan  that  in  case  1.  At  an  opportunity  cost  of  capital  of  12  percent  per  annum,  the  economic\nNPV is estimated at T57.0 million.\n\n3. \n\nBeef Cattle Fattening Farm\n\n16.\nThe model examines the benefits and costs of maintaining a beef fattening operation on\nan existing rain-fed farm to generate additional returns by maximizing the use of available crop\nby-products  that  are  presently  underutilized.  With  modest  investments  for  new  equipment  and\nimprovements to the existing stable and storage facilities, the farm\u2019s herd size with the Project is\nprojected to increase by 40 head from 99 to 139 over five years. Without such investments, the\nfarm\u2019s herd could increase by 8 head over the same period.\n\n17.\nLivestock mortality rate (age 6-24 months) is presently 5 percent per annum. This rate is\nanticipated  to  decline  over  five  years  to  3  percent.  With  simultaneous  improvements  in\nsanitation, health care, and feed rations, the mortality rate is expected to decline to 3 percent in\nyear 1 with the Project, and stabilize at 2 percent from year 3. Calves of about 12 months old\nand 120 kg/head are purchased and kept for a year, and sold as heifers and bulls at an average\nlive weight of 420 kg/head (with the Project) and at 350 kg/head (without the Project).\n\n18. With  incremental  investments  of  T1.3  million  (constant  2000),  the  beef  fattening\noperation is expected to yield an FIRR before financing of 37.4 percent and a financial NPV of\nT0.8  million.  The  model  also  shows  that  the  incremental  investment  and  improvements  could\ntap the existing potential of the farm, and generate an EIRR of 41.8 percent and an economic\nNPV of T0.9 million.\n\n\f79\n\nAppendix 10, page 5\n\n4. \n\nWheat Flour Mill\n\n19.\nA  flour  mill  with  a  processing  capacity  of  2  t  of  grain  per  hour  requires  an  initial\ninvestment of T50.3 million in 2000 constant prices. The mill produces two grades of flour: grade\n1  (premium)  and  grade  2.  By-products  are  sold  as  livestock  fodder.  On  average,  processing\noutputs  against  wheat  grain  inputs  are  assumed  to  comprise  39  percent  of  grade  1  flour,  31\npercent of grade 2 flour, 28 percent fodder and 2 percent losses including dust. As a base case,\nthe flour mill operates on two eight-hour shifts over 260 days per year. The mill is anticipated to\noperate for 10 years. It requires four operators per shift, a loading crew of three persons, and a\nmanager. Electricity consumption is rated at 135 kilowatts per hour of operations. The mill has\nan  effective  processing  capacity  of  90  percent  of  the  installed  capacity.  While  the  present\nelectricity  tariff  is  at  T4.4  per  kilowatt-hour  (kWh),  the  long-run  marginal  cost  of  electricity  is\nestimated at $0.06 per kWh. Production expenses mainly include (i) wheat grains, (ii) electricity,\n(iii) wages and benefits, (iv) maintenance of machinery and building facilities, (v) packaging, and\n(vii) handling and transport.\n\nOn the basis of 4,160 operating hours per year, a total of 7,488 t of wheat can be milled\n20.\nto produce 2,920 t of grade 1 flour, 2,321 t of grade 2 flour, and 2,097 t of fodder. Net operating\nincomes, before financing and income taxes, are expected to range from T17.0 million in year 2\nto T20.9 million in year 7. Variation is due to anticipated fluctuations of wheat and flour prices.\nUnder a base case scenario, these net operating incomes generate an FIRR of 35.4 percent on\nthe  invested  capital,  and  a  financial  NPV  of  T48.1  million.  The  investment  is  expected  to\ngenerate an EIRR of 36.7 percent and an economic NPV of T46.1 million.\n\nD.  Net Incomes, Cash Flows, and Debt Service Capacity\n\n21.\nFor projection purposes, the farms require an investment loan to finance 85 percent of\nthe proposed investment costs, and a working capital loan to cover 50 percent of the annual and\nseasonal direct expenses of the farms. To estimate profitability and debt service, the following\nassumptions are made.\n\n(i) \n\nFor  simplicity,  and  based  on  prevailing  rates  in  mid-2000,  the  nominal  interest\nrates  for  working  capital  and  investment  loans  are  projected  at  20  percent  per\nannum, in tenge. This interest rate, after adjusting for expected local inflation in\n2000,  is  equivalent  to  10  percent  per  annum  in  real  terms.  In  dollar  terms,  the\nnominal interest rate is about 12 percent per annum.\n\n(iii) \n\n(ii)  Working  capital  loans  are  for  an  average  period  of  seven  months.  The\ninvestment loan is for seven years, applicable to loan withdrawals of each year,\nwith a one-year grace period on loan principal repayment. Interest charges are to\nbe serviced during the grace period.\nDepreciation of fixed assets, excluding land, is calculated on a straight-line basis\nover 10 years.\nAn income tax rate of 10 percent is applied against taxable income (net operating\nincome less depreciation allowance and interest charges).\nNo provision is made for payment of dividends to shareholders. This assumption\nis made to show cash balances that reflect full retained earnings.\n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n1.\n\nRain-Fed Farm (4,000 ha)\n\n22.\nNet income after tax is projected to steadily rise in current terms from no profits in year 1\nto T3.6 million in year 5 and T5.9 million by year 10. In 2000 constant terms, net income after\n\n\f80\n\nAppendix 10, page 6\n\ntax rises to T2.6 million in year 5 and T3.2 million by year 10. The debt service coverage ratio1 is\nprojected to be healthy, averaging 2.0 over the 10-year period; and it is not expected to average\nbelow  1.2  over  any  two  consecutive  years.  Although  the  farm  has  a  potentially  strong  debt\nrepayment capacity, borrowing and loan repayment terms should be designed to suit  the farm\u2019s\nearning  capacity  and  cash  flows.  While  the  investment  plan  developed  for  this  model  is\nindicative  in  nature,  the  farm  would  be  able  to  borrow  and  repay  an  investment  loan  of  about\nT30 million and leave enough room to maintain healthy cash balances during debt service. The\nfarm\u2019s end-of-year cash balance is expected to rise in current terms from T0.9 million in year 1\nto T8.0 million in year 5 and T20.3 million by year 10. In constant 2000 terms, this cash balance\nsteadily rises from T0.9 million in year 1 to T5.7 million in year 5 and T10.8 million by year 10.\n\n2.\n\nRain-Fed Farm (10,000 ha)\n\n23.\nThe debt service coverage ratio is projected to be healthy, averaging 2.0 during the 10-\nyear  period.  This  ratio  is  not  expected  to  average  below  1.2  over  any  two  consecutive  years.\nThe  farm  has  a  potentially  strong  debt  repayment  capacity,  provided  that  borrowing  and  loan\nrepayment terms are designed to match the farm\u2019s earning capacity and cash flows. The farm\nwould be able to borrow and repay an investment loan of about T87.1 million and still maintain\nadequate  cash  balances  during  debt  service.  Net  income  after  tax  is  projected  to  be  steadily\nrising in current terms from T3.2 million in year 1 to T13.4 million in year 5 and T19.3 million by\nyear 10. In 2000 constant terms, net income after tax rises more modestly from a profit of T3.1\nmillion in year 1 to T9.5 million in year 5 and T10.3 million by year 10. The farm\u2019s end-of-year\ncash  balance  is  expected  to  rise  rapidly  in  current  terms  from  T2.3  million  in  year  1  to  T23.1\nmillion in year 5 and T42.8 million by year 10. In constant 2000 terms, this cash balance rises\nsteadily from T2.2 million in year 1 to T16.5 million in year 5 and T22.8 million by year 10.\n\nE.  Sensitivity Analysis\n\nThe  FIRRs  and  EIRRs  of  the  three  farm  models  are  moderately  robust.  Table  A10.1\n24.\nshows the impacts of yield reduction, output price decreases, and increases in investment and\noperating costs on these rates of return. Wheat prices are projected to be recovering and stable,\nafter  experiencing  a  15  percent  decline  over  the  last  year.  In  constant  2000  terms,  the  World\nBank\u2019s  commodity  price  projections  (January  2000)  show  that  American  wheat  prices2  are\nexpected to reach $115/t in 2000, $134/t in year 2005, and $126/t in year 2010. When a further\nprice decline of 10 percent is applied across these projections, the FIRRs of the 4,000 ha and\n10,000 ha farms are reduced to 20.2 percent and 20.3 percent, respectively. Nevertheless, the\nEIRRs remain attractive at 31.3 percent for the 4,000 ha farm, and 31.1 percent for the 10,000\nha farms.\n\n25.\nIn an unlikely event, when projected yields are reduced by 10 percent throughout the 10-\nyear  period,  the  FIRRs  of  these  farms  are  reduced  to  5.1  percent  (4,000  ha)  and  4.1  percent\n(10,000  ha),  although  the  respective  EIRRs  remain  attractive  at  16.8  percent  for  the  4,000  ha\nfarm  and  16.0  percent  for  the  10,000  ha  farm.  Such  reductions  in  yields  are  highly  unlikely  if\nfertilizers and agrochemicals are applied to the crops of arable farms in zones III and IV.\n\n26.\nThe  viability  of  the  farm  very  much  depends  on  the  overall  financial  and  commercial\nviability of the restructuring initiatives. Switching values, for rates of return not to fall below 12\n\n                                                          \n1 The  ratio  of  net  income  (excluding  depreciation,  noncash  charges,  interest,  and  other  charges  on  debt)  against\n\ndebt service (including long-term loan principal repayments and interest charges on all debts).\n\n2 US No. 1 hard red winter wheat, free-on-board basis, US Gulf Port.\n\n\f81\n\nAppendix 10, page 7\n\npercent,  are  presented  in  Table  A10.2.  Although  there  is  room  for  absorbing  unfavorable\nimpacts,  these  results  show  that  farm  restructuring  requires  astute  financial  management,\nbusiness planning, and farm management. While FIRRs on investments may show to be above\nthe cost of capital, the level of loan financing and its repayment schedules should be evaluated\nto match the overall earning capacity and projected cash flows of the farms.\n\n27.\nThe  FIRRs  of  these  farms  are  sensitive  to  decreases  in  benefits.  In  the  event  benefits\nare  reduced  by  7-8  percent  across  all  projected  years,  the  FIRRs  fall  to  12  percent,  a  level\nassumed to be the opportunity cost of capital. Similarly, the FIRRs are also sensitive to overall\nincreases  in  operating  costs.  The  FIRRs  would  again  fall  to  12  percent  when  operating  costs\nrise  by  about  10-11  percent.  However,  the  FIRRs  are  less  sensitive  to  increases  in  the\ninvestment costs. The FIRR of the cattle fattening model is sensitive to increases in operating\ncosts. A 9 percent increase in the operating costs (with the Project) would reduce the FIRR of\nthe cattle fattening farm to 12 percent.\n\n28.\nIn the case of the flour mill, the base FIRR is moderately robust to declines in output and\nprices  of  wheat  grains  and  wheat  flour,  and  to  increases  in  investment  and  operating  costs.\nTable  A10.1  shows  that  the  FIRR  is  reduced  to  29.9  percent  when  output  declines  by  10\npercent,  and  to  27.8  percent  when  prices  of  wheat  grains  and  wheat  flour  decline\nsimultaneously by 10 percent.  For the FIRR to fall to 12 percent, the investment costs must rise\nby 107 percent or the operating costs must increase by 64.3 percent. The FIRR is sensitive to\nprice  fluctuations  of  wheat  flour  when  prices  of  wheat  grains  remain  constant.  Although  this\nscenario is unlikely, the FIRR is reduced to 12 percent when benefits decline by 7.0 percent, a\ncase when flour prices alone decline by 7.0 percent without a similar drop in the price of wheat\ngrains. Similarly, the EIRR falls to 31.1 percent when output declines by 10 percent, and to 28.3\npercent when wheat grain and wheat flour prices simultaneously drop by 10 percent. The EIRR\nis  reduced  to  12  percent  when  (i)  investment  costs  rise  by  114  percent;  (ii)  operating  costs\nincrease by 56.0 percent; or (iii) benefits drop by 6.6 percent. The FIRR and EIRR will also fall\nto 12 percent when the operating hours of the mill are reduced from 4,160 hours (2 shifts) by\nabout 39 percent.\n\n29.\nThe  sensitivity  of  the  FIRRs  to  depreciation  of  the  local  currency  equivalent  to  the  US\ndollar  was  tested  (Table  A10.3).  In  the  event  the  tenge  experiences  a  further  20  percent\ndepreciation,  from  T144.00/$1  to  T188.00/$1,  the  FIRRs  are  expected  to  rise  to  47.8  percent\n(4,000  ha),  43.4  percent  (10,000  ha),  45.8  percent  (cattle  fattening),  and  38.8  percent  (flour\nmill). Depreciation of the tenge would cause prices of tradable inputs (equipment) and outputs\n(grains and sunflower) in tenge to rise to maintain their dollar equivalents, while prices in tenge\nof nontradable inputs would lag behind. Nontradable inputs and outputs are estimated to have\n50 percent foreign content, while transport costs have up to 80 percent foreign content. As the\noverall  prices  of  farm  outputs  are  more  sensitive  than  nontraded  input  prices  in  general  to\nfluctuations  of  the  foreign  exchange  rate,  the  net  effect  of  local  currency  depreciation  on  the\nFIRRs is favorable.\n\n\f82\n\nAppendix 10, page 8\n\nTable A10.1: Sensitivity of Rates of Return to Declines in Yields and Prices,\nand Cost Increases\n\nModels\n\nBase Case a\n\n10% Decline\nin All Yields or\noutput\n\n10 % Wheat Price\nDecline\n\n10 % Increase\nin Investment\nCosts\n\n10% increase in\nOperating Costs\n\nNPV\nT '000\n12%\n\nFinancial\n\n   4,000 ha\n 10,000 ha\n Beef farm\nFlour mill\n\n14,110\n37,572\n754\n48,096\n\nEconomic\n\n   4,000 ha\n 10,000 ha\n Beef farm\nFlour mill\n\n21,238\n56,966\n850\n46,091\n\nIRR\n%\n\n34.4\n33.4\n37.4\n35.4\n\n47.5\n45.6\n41.8\n36.7\n\nNPV\nT '000\n12%\n\n(4,065)\n(12,401)\n(329)\n35,832\n\n2,942\n6,643\n(233)\n34,765\n\nIRR\n%\n\n5.1\n4.1\n0.3\n29.9\n\n16.8\n16.0\n3.7\n31.1\n\nNPV\nT '000\n12%\n\n5,145\n14,342\n__\n31,318b\n\n11,962\n32,927\n__\n\n29,190\n\nIRR\n%\n\n20.2\n20.3\n__\n27.8b\n\n31.3\n31.1\n__\n\n28.3\n\nNPV\nT '000\n12%\n\n10,974\n27,920\n649\n43,602\n\n18,103\n47,314\n750\n42,038\n\nIRR\n%\n\n28.1\n26.8\n31.6\n31.7\n\n39.4\n37.4\n35.5\n32.9\n\nNPV\nT '000\n12%\n\n482\n1,009\n(104)\n40,622\n\n8,155\n21,691\n34\n37,852\n\nIRR\n%\n\n12.8\n12.6\n8.5\n32.1\n\n24.8\n24.4\n13.2\n32.6\n\n__ = not applicable, IRR = internal rate of return, NPV = net present value.\na\n\nIn the sensitivity analysis on 4,000 ha and 10,000 ha farm models, the forgone net operating losses (without the Project) are not\ncaptured as incremental benefits due to the Project.

The pro-poor impact of the information\ncampaign would be enhanced by a focus on the needs of relatively disadvantaged rural\ngroups, e.g., farms and rural communities in marginal agroclimatic zones, and by widening the\nscope of the campaign\u2019s messages to cover topics such as microenterprise development and\nnonfarm employment opportunities.\nImproved information and knowledge about the legal and policy framework for agriculture is\nexpected to contribute to (i) consolidation of land- holdings, farm shares, and land tenure and\nownership rights into legally sound farm structures; (ii) greater demand for commercial credit\nbased on pledging of property; (iii) greater use of bankruptcy as a tool for farm restructuring;\n(iv) formation of cooperatives and voluntary organizations; and (v) greater willingness by farm\ncommunities and small businesses to resist extralegal interventions in their affairs by local\nadministrations.

In addition, explicit\npublic support is desirable to promote and nurture the development of cooperatives and\nWUAs. Care must be taken that transfer of irrigation management responsibilities does not\nexceed the capacities of the newly created WUAs. Support will be provided under (i) the\nProgram\u2019s public information campaign on agriculture, (ii) TA 2946-KAZ: Institutional\nDevelopment and Policy Reforms for Improving Water Management,a and (iii) related TA\nfinanced by the United States Agency for International Development.\nPositive\nMarket access and efficiency are presently key constraints to the growth of agriculture, so\nthere are major potential benefits to be gained from rural cooperative organizations for input\nsupply, marketing, and other purposes. However, the social capital for these activities was\nnot developed during the Soviet period, when production and marketing decisions were\nmade centrally. Although Kazakhstan\u2019s Civil Code presents few legal barriers to private\nbusiness initiative and the formation of cooperatives, additional explicit legislative support is\nwarranted. Similarly, explicit support for the formation and functioning of WUAs is urgently\nneeded to arrest the deterioration of water resources infrastructure that accompanied the\nbreakup of the state farms and the breakdown of O&M services provided under the\ncommand economy.\n\na Approved  by  the  Board  on  17  December  1997,  for  $600,000,  together  with  Loans  1592/1593-KAZ:  Water\n\nResources Management and Land Improvement Project, for $40 million.\n\nE.\n\nIntroduce More Effective Financing of O&M in Public Irrigation\n\n5.\nThe  principal  measures  will  (i)  improve  procedures  for  collection  of  water  fees  and\nrelated user charges; (ii) establish procedures for annual allocation of such fees between oblast\nadministrations  and  the  national  Government  to  finance  the  costs  of  O&M  of  drainage  and\nirrigation  infrastructure;  and  (iii)  institutionalize  explicit  routine  national  budgeting  for  O&M  in\nbalance with the revenues generated by water fees.\n\n\fChannel\nDemand for\nUnskilled\nLabor\n\nPrices\nAccess for\nPoor\n\nTransfers\n\nCrucial\nVariables &\nAssumptions\n\nNet Impact\n\nNarrative\n\n89\n\nAppendix 11, page 6\n\nShort-Run/Direct\n\nMacro\n\nMedium-Term\nIndirect\nOver time, improved\nfinancing of O&M will\nlead to more reliable\nirrigation and\ndrainage services,\nlower salinity and\nwaterlogging, and\nimproved farm\nproductivity, acting\nto increase labor use\non irrigated farms of\nall sizes.\n\nNonpoor\n\nNo significant\nimpacts expected.\nHowever, it should\nbe noted that the\nmeasures will affect\nO&M funding in\nirrigated agricultural\nregions, which are\nrelatively non-poor\ncompared with the\nrain-fed regions.\n\nModestly negative if\nthere is any\nreduction in public\nexpenditures for\ntransfers to the poor\nSame as short-run\nand medium-term\neffects\n\nSame as the short-\nrun effects\n\nNo significant\nimpacts expected,\nbut, viewed\nnationally, the net\neffect of more\nexplicit linkage of\nwater fee revenues\nand O&M may be to\nreduce Government\nfunding of other\nservices to\nKazakhstan\u2019s\nrelatively poor\nregions and social\ngroups.\n\nThe measures will\nmore explicitly link\nO&M budgets with\nrevenues presently\nbeing generated from\nwater fees. In the\nshort run, this will\naffect the allocation of\npublic revenues, not\ntheir magnitude. To\nthe extent this\nreduces the diversion\nof water fee revenues\nto uses other than\nO&M, it may entail a\nreduction in public\nfunding of social\nservices and direct\ntransfers to the poor.\nIn and of themselves, the measures will have no impact on the cost of water to farmers. The\npresent water fees are modest in size__slightly more than $1 per hectare per year__in light of\nthe limited financial capacity of farms. Full recovery of the economic costs of water, which\nwould include the environmental costs of water diverted from the Aral Sea, would entail a\nvery substantial increase in the water fee in some regions of Kazakhstan, but it is assumed\nthat the feasibility of such a cost increase is remote during the medium term.\nNeutral to modestly positive. In the long run, the productivity-enhancing impacts of improved\nirrigation and drainage services are assumed to have benefits for the poor, which may be\ncounterbalanced by a slight reduction in public provision of other public services to the poor.\nIn August 1997, the Government issued a regulation on the calculation and collection of fees\nfor surface water. This was intended to be the first step toward a long-term policy of full\nrecovery of the investment and O&M costs of irrigation infrastructure. So far, the water fees\nhave been used as a source of general revenue by oblast administrations rather than being\ndevoted to O&M, which continues to suffer from lack of funding. The program\u2019s measures will\nrationalize the budgetary relationship between water fees and publicly financed O&M.\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS\n(as of 16 October 2000)\n", "Currency Unit\nT1.00\n$1.00\n", "__\n", "=\n=\n", "Tenge (T)\n$0.007008\nT142.70\n", "Until  April  1999,  the  exchange  rate  of  the  tenge  was  determined  under  a  system  of\nmanaged float through periodic foreign exchange auctions.
