It  will  contribute  to  the  creation  of  85,000  tourism-related  jobs  in  Viet  Nam  by  \n(i)  paving  45  kilometers  of  rural  roads  to  open  new  areas  for  private  tourism  investment,  and \nimprove  access  to  markets  and  social  services  for  about  30,000  residents;  (ii)  improving \nenvironmental  services  in  areas  important  for  cross-border  tourism  to  reduce  public  health \nhazards  for  21,000  residents  and  8.8  million  annual  visitors  beginning  in  2019;  and  \n(iii)  facilitating  business  support  services  and  access  to  microfinance  for  at  least  560  micro-, \nsmall,  and  medium-sized  enterprises. 3 The  project  will  strengthen  regional  cooperation  and \nintegration by implementing harmonized regional tourism standards, promoting multicountry tour \ncircuits, and supporting structured policy dialogue to reduce nonphysical barriers to travel. The \nproject investment plan is in line with the GMS Tourism Sector Strategy4 and the government\u2019s \nStrategy for Tourism Development in Viet Nam until 2020, Vision to 2030.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nRegional  context.  Among  country  groupings  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific,  the  GMS  has  a \nstrong  comparative  advantage  in tourism  as  a result  of  its  diverse  cultural  and natural  assets, \ngood  international  air  and  land  transport  connections  between  gateway  destinations,  and \nsurging  demand  for  intraregional  leisure  travel.  International  tourist  arrivals  are  growing  by \n12.4% per year; in 2012 arrivals reached an all-time high of 44.8 million, generating $44.3 billion \nin  receipts.  Tourism  supports  7  million  jobs  and  creates  positive  economic  impacts  in  other \nservice  and  productive  sectors.  About  one-third  of  international  arrivals  visit  at  least  two \ncountries while travelling in the GMS, and millions of residents cross borders each year for day \ntrips.  GMS  countries  are  eager  to  strengthen  subregional  tourism  cooperation  and  recently \nreaffirmed  their  commitment  to  promote  cross-border  tourism  under  the  GMS  Economic \nCooperation  Program  Strategic  Framework,  2012\u20132022. 5\n Nevertheless,  underinvestment  in \npublic  infrastructure  beyond  the  major  gateways  remains  a  critical  constraint  to  expanding \nprivate tourism enterprises and dispersing benefits to less-developed areas.6 \n \n4. \nNational priorities. Viet Nam received 6.84 million international tourists in 2012, a 14% \nincrease from 2011 and about 15% of total GMS arrivals. Tourism directly contributes  4.5% to \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.

Manila. \n\nImplementation of the strategy is estimated to cost $430 million, of which 83% is allocated for infrastructure.  \n\n5   Asian Development Bank. 2011. Greater Mekong Subregion Economic Cooperation Program Strategic Framework, \n\n6  Sector  Assessment  (Summary):  Tourism  in  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \n\n2012\u20132022. Manila.  \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n\fgross  domestic  product  and  sustains  2.3  million  jobs  or  9.4%  of  total  employment. 7  The \ngovernment\u2019s strategy and vision for tourism development is consistent with the GMS Tourism \nSector  Strategy,  emphasizing  tourism  infrastructure  and  facility  upgrades,  human  resource \ndevelopment,  marketing  and  promotion,  and  policy  enhancement  to  improve  the  business \nenabling environment for tourism. Strategic objectives are to (i) develop tourism into a  leading \neconomic  sector;  (ii)  improve  tourism  quality  and  competitiveness;  (iii)  attract  more  high-\nspending  international  visitors;  (iv)  promote  domestic  tourism;  and  (v)  protect  cultural,  historic, \nand  natural  resources.  The  national  strategy  forecasts  10.5  million  international  arrivals,  \n48 million domestic tourists, and tourism receipts equivalent to $19 billion in 2020.  \n \n5. \nKey  issues.  Despite  a  rich  inventory  of  cultural  and  natural  features  with  good \ndevelopment  potential,  most  tourism  activity  is  concentrated  in  Da  Nang,  Ha  Long,  Hanoi,  Ho \nChi Minh City, or Hue\u2013Hoi An, which account for over one-third of hospitality investment.8 While \nwomen  comprise  about  60%  of  tourism  workers,  many  are  employed  in  lower-skilled  jobs \npaying lower wages, and are underrepresented in tourism management. At least 30% of tourism \nreceipts leave the country as tourism-related imports because of weak market linkages between \nthe  tourism  supply  chain  and  other  economic  sectors.  The  key  impediments  to  more  inclusive \nand  geographically  dispersed  growth  are  insufficient  last-mile  transport  infrastructure  in \nsecondary destinations, limited institutional capacity to promote local tourism-related enterprise \ndevelopment,  and  ineffective  marketing.  A  few  areas  such  as  Ba  Den  Mountain  in  Tay  Ninh \nprovince  have  had  a  surge  in  visitors  following  improvements  to  the  GMS  transport  corridors, \nhowever sanitary conditions are quickly being degraded due to inadequate management of solid \nwaste  and  wastewater.  Together  with  low  service  standards,  this  situation  suppresses  tourist \nlength of stay, reduces spending, and threatens future prospects for sustainable growth.  \n \n6. \nTo  remove  these  constraints  and  engender  a  more  equitable  pattern  of  tourism \ndevelopment, the project will upgrade access roads that link rural tourist attractions with urban \ncenters,  improve  environmental  infrastructure  and services  in areas  important for  tourism,  and \nsupport  capacity  building  for  local  entrepreneurs  and  destination  management  organizations.9 \nProject  investments  are designed to  catalyze  private  investment  in  tourism  superstructure  and \nservices,  boost  tourist  spending  and  job  creation  in  underdeveloped  areas,  and  ensure  that \ntourism growth is environmentally and socially sustainable.10 \n \n7. \nRelated  policies  and  strategies.  The  project  is  aligned  with  Viet  Nam\u2019s  Socio-\nEconomic  Development  Strategy,  2011\u20132020,  which  aims  to  transform  the  country  into  a \nmodern  industrialized  nation  by  (i)  improving  socialist-oriented  market  economy  institutions,  \n(ii)  developing  human  resources,  and  (iii)  improving  transportation  networks  and  urban \ninfrastructure.  Promotion  of  cultural  heritage  and  tourism  features  prominently.  The  focus  on \ncreating jobs for women and ethnic minorities living in underdeveloped areas; improving urban\u2013\nrural  connectivity;  expanding  the quality  and coverage of  environmental services;  and  building \ncapacity to sustainably manage tourism overlap with the three pillars of the country partnership \nstrategy  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  Viet  Nam:  inclusive  growth,  enhanced \neconomic efficiency, and environmental sustainability.11 The project reinforces regional efforts to \nincrease cross-border tourism and investment flows, develop the GMS corridors into economic \ncorridors, and promote the Mekong as a single tourist destination. \n\n                                                \n7  World Travel and Tourism Council. 2013.

Senior  GMS  tourism  officials  and  ADB  co-chair  the  semiannual  working \ngroup meetings, which guide GMS Tourism Sector Strategy implementation and identify policy \nissues for discussion at the annual GMS tourism ministers meeting and triennial GMS summit. \nIn  Viet  Nam,  the  Ministry  of  Culture,  Sports  and  Tourism  (MCST)  coordinates  tourism  sector \nassistance.  Other  development  partners  engaged  in  tourism  are  the  European  Union,  the \nInternationale \nGerman  development  cooperation \nZusammenarbeit,  Japan \nthe \nGovernment of New Zealand.12  \n \n9. \nLessons.  ADB\u2019s  GMS  tourism  sector  assistance  program  and  completed  tourism \nprojects  in  Viet  Nam  are  rated  successful.13 Project  lessons  include  the  need  to  (i)  analyze \ntourism  demand  in  project  areas  to  guide  selection  of  infrastructure  investments,  (ii)  improve \ncross-sector  coordination  and build synergies with other  ADB  assistance,  (iii)  provide  capacity \nbuilding  for  project  management  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M),  and  (iv)  promote \ntourism-related  private  enterprise  development  alongside  infrastructure  to  expand  income-\ngenerating  opportunities  for  local  residents.  The  project\u2019s  infrastructure  subprojects  are  based \non robust market analysis and complementarities with ADB assistance for urban development, \nwater  supply  and  sanitation,  and  tourism.  Capacity  building  for  entities  responsible  for \ninfrastructure O&M, and parallel support for small enterprises led by women and ethnic groups \nwill enhance sustainability of project outputs and ensure benefits reach vulnerable groups. The \ninterventions will connect lower-income groups to basic services and markets, and enable them \nto access tourism employment, education, health care, and other opportunities. \n \nSpecial features. The project will (i) strengthen collaboration between government, the \n10. \nprivate sector, civil society, and local communities to improve tourism destination management, \n(ii) demonstrate how tourist entry fees and charges can help finance the maintenance of public \ngoods  such  as  heritage  sites,  roads,  and  environmental  services,  (iii)  strengthen  knowledge \npartnerships  among  GMS  and  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  members,  and  \n(iv) leverage service sector opportunities to accelerate widening of GMS corridors into economic \ncorridors by linking secondary tourism destinations with increasingly affluent regional markets. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n11. \nThe  impact  of  the  project  will  be  increased  tourism  employment  for  people  living  in \nunderdeveloped  segments  of  GMS  corridors  in  Viet  Nam.  The  outcome  will  be  increased \ntourism receipts in Dien Bien, Ha Tinh, Kien Giang, Lao Cai, and Tay Ninh. By 2019, aggregate \nannual tourism receipts in the project provinces will increase to $480 million, helping to stimulate \nthe  creation  of  85,000  additional  tourism-related  jobs  by  2025.  Based  on  current  workforce \nparticipation rates, it is expected that 60% of these jobs will be held by women. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n12. \nThe  outputs  are  (i)  last-mile  tourism  access  infrastructure  improved,  (ii)  environmental \nservices in cross-border tourism centers improved, (iii) institutional capacity to promote inclusive \ntourism  growth  strengthened,  and  (iv)  effective  project  implementation  and  management. \nCriteria guiding subproject selection include (i) infrastructure constraints; (ii) location in a GMS \ncorridor  with  good  tourism  and  economic  development  potential;  (iii)  location  in  a  multicountry \n                                                \n12  Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n13  ADB.  2009.

Overall  project  coordination  and  regional \ncooperation  activities  will  be  led  by  a  project  coordination  unit  (PCU)  embedded  in  MCST\u2019s \nPlanning and Finance Department. The PCU will report to the MCST deputy minister, who will \nbe the permanent chairperson of the national steering committee and represent Viet Nam on the \nsubregional  steering  committee.  DCSTs  in  each  participating  province  will  establish  a  project \nimplementation  unit  (PIU)  staffed  with  multidisciplinary  teams  to  oversee  day-to-day  project \nimplementation.  The  PIUs  will  report  to  the  deputy  chairperson  of  the  provincial  people\u2019s \ncommittees and the PCU, which will consolidate quarterly progress reports for submission to the \nnational  steering  committee  and  ADB.  The  PIUs  and  the  PCU  will  share  consultant  resources \nand attend steering committee meetings to ensure all project activities are well-coordinated.  \n \n20. \nThe  project  will  work  directly  with  community-based  organizations  and  business \nassociations, which will appoint local focal points to ensure good coordination between the PIUs \nand project beneficiaries. If no community-based organizations or business associations exist in \nproject areas, the PIUs will extend assistance to form them. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\n21. \nThe project will (i) upgrade rural roads to ease access to tourist attractions; (ii) construct \nfacilities  to  treat  wastewater  and  temporarily  store  solid  waste;  and  (iii)  construct  public \namenities  such  as  tourist  information  centers  and  markets  to  create  favorable  conditions  for \nenterprise  development  by \nlocal  residents,  particularly  women  and  ethnic  minorities. \nEngineering  solutions  are  technically  feasible  and  consider  cost,  durability,  affordability,  and \nclimate resilience. All civil works designs are compatible with standard parameters and the O&M \ncapacity  of  local  authorities.  Contract  packaging  will  attract  suitably  qualified  contractors  and \nensure  efficient  procurement.  Capacity-building  programs  will  help  small  entrepreneurs  to \nbecome more competitive and improve the business enabling environment. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nThe  economic  analysis  for  all  infrastructure  subprojects  followed  ADB  guidelines. 18 \n22. \nBenefits  quantified  are  increased  tourism  receipts  arising  from  an  increase  in  tourists  visiting \nproject-supported  destinations  and  staying  0.4\u20130.8  days  longer,  and  vehicle  operating  cost \nsavings from reductions in road roughness. Economic benefits identified but not quantified are \nincreased  land  values  for  property  owners,  increased  agricultural  production  and  income  for \nfarmers  living  along  the  improved  rural  roads,  and  health  benefits  arising  from  better \nenvironmental services. The base-case results indicate all subprojects are economically viable \nwith an estimated economic internal rate of return exceeding the assumed economic opportunity \ncost of capital of 12%. Returns range from 15.3% for the Ta Phin\u2013Ban Khoang access road to \n49.4%  for  the  Dien  Bien  Phu  Cultural  Exchange  and  Tourist  Information  Center.  The  findings \nare consistent with the performance of other ADB-financed public tourism infrastructure in Viet \nNam;  when  similar  assumptions  were  applied,  the  infrastructure  generated  internal  rates  of \nreturn of 28.4% to 82.2%.19 All subprojects remain viable under all adverse scenarios tested.20  \n\n                                                \n18  Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n19  ADB. 2011.

Manila. \n\n20  1-year implementation delay or costs are 10% higher or benefits 10% lower than the base case. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fThe  financial  analysis  followed  ADB  guidelines. 21  Road  subprojects  are  considered \n23. \nnonrevenue  generating.  The  financial  sustainability  analysis  of  the  provincial  departments  of \ntransportation  (DOTs)  responsible  for  O&M  is  based  on  historical  income  and  expenditure \nstatements.  It  found  that  Kien  Giang  DOT  will  have  sufficient  budget  and  revenue  to  cover \nincremental  O&M  of  the  access  roads  at  Da  Dung  Cave  and  Phu  Tu  Tourism  Zone,  but  Dien \nBien  and  Lao  Cai  DOTs  will  require  additional  funds  for  periodic  maintenance  of  the  Muang \nPhang and Ta Phin\u2013Ban Khoang access roads. The government, through an assurance in the \nloan agreement, has committed to provide the DOTs with sufficient funds for this purpose. The \nanalysis for other project-developed infrastructure under the responsibility of the DCSTs found \nthat tourist user fees will generate sufficient revenue to cover O&M costs of all facilities.22 \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n24. \nThe  assessment  of  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies\u2019  capacity  for  financial \nmanagement  envisaged  under  the  project,  including  the  use  of  statement  of  expenditure  and \nimprest  fund  procedures,  suggests  the  implementation  arrangements  and  internal  control \nsystems are suitable. Measures to mitigate risks identified, such as the potential for corruption \nfrom  weak  procurement  oversight  and  low  financial  management  capacity  of  PIUs,  will  be \naddressed  by  applying  standard  ADB  bidding  documents  and  providing  intensive  start-up \ntraining in ADB procurement, financial management, and disbursement procedures. Consultants \nwith financial management expertise will be embedded in the PCU and PIUs to provide on-the-\njob training and prepare a project-specific financial management manual. Compliance with ADB \nfinancial  reporting  and  external  audit  requirements  will  be  monitored  by  review  missions  and \nnormal  project  supervision.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \nexplained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  MCST.  The  specific  policy  requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual.  \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n25. \nThe  project  will  benefit  about  490,000  residents  (50%  women  and  girls)  in  the  five \nparticipating provinces. Poverty rates in project areas range from 6% in Tay Ninh to 33% in Lao \nCai and Dien Bien due to limited assets, low productivity, and poor access to markets and social \nservices.  Project  investments  to  improve  access  infrastructure  and  environmental  services, \nstrengthen  tourism  destination  management,  and  provide  micro-  and  small  enterprises  with \nbusiness  support  services  are  designed  to  overcome  these  constraints  and  expand  economic \nopportunities to benefit poor and lower-income households. The project is categorized effective \ngender  mainstreaming.  It  will  improve  women\u2019s  access  to  economic  opportunities  and  strategic \ndecision making. The gender action plan specifies women will hold 60% of tourism-related jobs \ncreated  by  the  project  and  comprise  60%  of  training  participants,  50%  of  participants  in \ncommunity consultations, 40% of leadership positions in destination management organizations, \nand 30% of project management and technical staff.23 The project will reduce the vulnerability of \nwomen  and  children  to  HIV/AIDS  transmission,  human  trafficking,  and  other  forms  of \nexploitation  by  conducting  awareness  programs  and  promoting  collaboration  between  private \nenterprises, nongovernment organizations, and law enforcement agencies.24  \n \n\n                                                \n21  Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n22  Institutional Analysis and Arrangements for O&M of Project Facilities (accessible from the list of linked documents \n\nin Appendix 2). \n\n23  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n24   The  project  will  collaborate  with  the  Child  Safe  Tourism  Campaign  (active  in  Cambodia,  the  Lao  PDR,  and  Viet \n\nNam) in cooperation with World Vision, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, and Interpol. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n26. \nAll  safeguards  documents  were  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguards  Policy \nStatement  (2009)  and  are  posted  on  the  ADB  website  in  compliance  with  disclosure \nrequirements.25 The  safeguards  categorization  for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and \nindigenous  peoples  is  B.  Initial  consultations  with  male  and  female  residents,  government \nofficials, and civil society confirm broad support for the project.  Consultation with these groups \nwill continue throughout the project cycle, following the consultation and participation plan and \nstakeholder  communications  strategy. 26 The  project  includes  resources  to  help  counterparts \neffectively  implement  social  and  environmental  safeguards.  Monitoring  requirements  and \nappropriate grievance redress mechanisms are in the safeguards documents. \n \nAn initial environmental examination was prepared in the context of the project\u2019s area of \n27. \ninfluence  and  based  on  current  information. 27 The  potential  environmental  impacts  are  not \nirreversible,  diverse,  or  unprecedented.  Expected  impacts  and  risks  are  site-specific  and \nappropriate  mitigating  measures  are  incorporated  into  subproject-specific  environmental \nmanagement plans. Works in sensitive environments and near physical cultural resources such \nas pagodas  and caves were  designed  in  consultation with the  DCSTs  and  in  accordance  with \ninternational  good  practice  and  national  laws  and  regulations.  The  initial  environmental \nexamination (IEE) and environmental management plans (EMPs) will be updated and finalized \nat  the  detailed  design  stage  with  the  involvement  of  tourism  planners,  heritage  management \nexperts, and environment specialists. Updated versions of the documents will be cleared by the \ngovernment  and  ADB,  posted  to  the  ADB  website,  and  form  part  of  bidding  documents.  The \nfinal IEE and EMPs will guide construction supervision and the preparation of site management \nplans with environmentally sensitive O&M guidelines. \n \n28. \nLand  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts  involve  7  severely  affected  households  with \n34  affected  persons, minor  land  acquisition from  247 households with 1,219  affected  persons, \ntemporary  disruption  of  118  businesses  with  583  affected  persons,  and  18  households  with \noutstanding  claims  for  compensation  payments  for  loss  of  land  and  other  assets  at  Phu  Tu \ntourism zone in Kieng Giang province. Resettlement plans were prepared for each subproject, \ncommensurate  with  the  extent  and  degree  of  the  expected  impacts.28 Corrective  actions  are \nincluded  in  the  resettlement  plan  for  Kieng  Giang.  Initial  costs  of  land  acquisition  and \ncompensation  are  estimated  at  $1.07  million,  and  are  considered  adequate  based  on  the \ncensus  and  inventory  of  losses  prepared  in  consultation  with  affected  persons.  Project \ninformation  was  disclosed  to  all  affected  persons;  a  cutoff  date  for  their  inclusion  in  the \nresettlement  plans  was  established  during  resettlement  consultations.  The  project  information \nbooklet will be updated and disseminated during the detailed measurement survey.  \n \n29. \nAn  ethnic  minority  development  plan  was  prepared  in  consultation  with  Dao,  Hmong, \nKhmer, and Thai ethnic minorities in the project areas. 29 The project will benefit these groups by \n(i) formalizing community management of tourist attractions in ancestral territories, (ii) promoting \ncultural industries to create income-generating opportunities, and (iii) improving physical access \nto markets  and social  services. The  plan  specifies that  ethnic  minorities  will  be  represented  in \ntourism  destination  management  organizations  and  includes  measures  to  protect  intangible \n\n                                                \n25  ADB. 2011.
