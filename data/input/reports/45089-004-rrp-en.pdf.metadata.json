To  maintain  this  growth,  structural \nchanges in the local economy and rapid technological changes in the global economy must be \nmet with a workforce equipped with an appropriate set of advanced skills and knowledge. The \ngovernment recognizes that human capital development is crucial for enhancing competitiveness, \nsustaining  growth,  and  promoting  inclusion.  The  Philippine  Development  Plan,  2017\u20132022 \nemphasizes equalizing human development opportunities  by improving access to quality basic \nand tertiary education, particularly for the poor.4 The overarching strategic framework for basic \neducation calls for (i) the full implementation of the K to 12  Program, (ii) continuing curriculum \nreforms, (iii) enhancing teacher competency, (iv) developing and improving interventions to keep \nstudents in school, and (v) strengthening inclusion programs.5 \n \nThe K to 12 Program, introduced in 2013, aims to equip youth with foundational and life \n4. \nskills to prepare them for tertiary education and employment. The K to 12 Program\u2019s secondary \neducation component includes an additional 2-year senior high school (SHS) level; a curriculum \nto  meet  21st  century  skills  requirements,  including  problem  solving  and  information  and \ncommunication technology; a TVL track for job-ready skills; and expanded use of public\u2013private \npartnerships in education financing, including the junior high school (JHS) Educational Service \nContracting (ESC) and the SHS voucher program.6 \n\n                                                \n1  The K to 12 Program covers kindergarten, primary (grades 1\u20136), and secondary education. Secondary education \n\ncomprises four years of junior high school (grades 7\u201310) and two years of senior high school (grades 11\u201312). \n\n2  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2014.

The SHS voucher program is for JHS completers who opt to study SHS in a non-Department \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n   \n5. \nDespite the gains in enrollment and completion compared with 1990 levels, the country\u2019s \nsecondary education system continues to face access challenges. In school year (SY) 2015/16, \nthe JHS net enrollment rate was only 68% and the completion rate was 74%. In the same school \nyear,  only  six  out  of  10  children  of  secondary  school  age  belonging  to  the  poorest  20%  of \nhouseholds were in JHS, compared with nine in the richest 20%. Only 15% of secondary school \nage  children  from  the  poorest  20%  of  households  were  in  SHS  compared  with  52%  from  the \nrichest quintile.7 Girls continue to outperform boys in most JHS indicators based on SY2015/16 \nsex-disaggregated  data:  net  enrollment  rate  (female:  79.9%,  male:  68.8%),  completion  rate \n(female: 78.5%, male: 69.7%), and dropout rate (female: 6.5%, male: 6.6%).  In addition, more \nneeds to be done to improve students\u2019 learning outcomes. In SY 2014/15, less than half of the \nstudents obtained a mean percentage score (MPS) greater than 50% in the National Achievement \nTest (NAT).8   \n \n6. \nThe  government  has  identified  the  next  set  of  development  constraints.    Subject \nspecialists  and SHS  teachers  have  noted  (i)  difficulties in completing the  new  SHS  curriculum \nwithin the allocated instructional time, reflecting the need to review its scope and sequence, and \n(ii)  poor  alignment  with  community  and  industry  needs.  For  example,  many  Department  of \nEducation  (DepEd)  secondary  schools  offer  TVL  specializations  that  are  not  necessarily \nresponsive  to  local  industry  requirements  or  students\u2019  preferences.  Moreover,  the  shortage  of \nlicensed  guidance  counselors  has  reduced  schools\u2019  ability  to  provide  good  career  guidance. \nDepEd\u2019s Alternative Learning System (ALS) Program has been addressing the learning needs of \nout  of  school  youth.  With  the  adoption  of  a  new  K  to  12  curriculum,  the  rollout  of  a  K  to  12 \ncompliant ALS curriculum needs to be accelerated.  \n  \n7. \nIn  addition,  teacher  quality  needs  to  improve.  Many  secondary  schools  do  not  have \nenough specialized teachers in core subjects because of difficulties in recruiting and deploying \nsubject specialists. The shortage of specialized teachers and the challenge of retaining them in \nthe  system  partly  result  from  the  absence  of  a  clear  teacher  career  pathway  and  inadequate \nprofessional  development  opportunities  to  address  training  needs.  Key  priorities  to  improve \nteacher quality include: (i) alignment of both pre-service education and in-service training with the \nK  to  12  curriculum  and  the  Philippine  Professional  Standards  for  Teachers;  (ii)  improving  the \nmatching  of  teacher  specialization  with  subject  taught;  and  (iii)  developing  a  more  responsive \nteacher career pathing policy, including an increase in the number of master teacher9 positions.  \n \n8. \nWhile  budget  allocation  for  basic  education  has  increased  significantly  following  recent \neducation reforms, the DepEd\u2019s utilization of its budget has only started to improve and needed \nincreases in specific budget items remain. The school maintenance and other operating expenses \nbudget increased by more than 50% during 2011\u20132015, but this has been inadequate to meet \nspecific needs at both JHS and SHS levels. These shortages are exacerbated by DepEd\u2019s chronic \nunderutilization of its budget. Inadequate equipment, tools, and learning materials limit the ability \n\n                                                \n\nof Education (DepEd) SHS (i.e., private schools or state and local university and college). The assistance defrays \n(either partly or in full) the school fees charged by the non-DepEd SHS provider. \n\n7  Philippine Statistics Authority. 2016. Annual Poverty Indicators Survey. Manila. \n8  The students\u2019 performance progress and least mastered competencies could not be ascertained in SY2015/16 and \nSY2016/17 since the NAT was not administered due to procurement issues in the printing of the test instruments.  \n9  Master teacher refers to teaching positions in the DepEd system whose qualification standards for teachers in the \nacademic track and core subjects include (i) at least a master\u2019s degree in the relevant strand or subject, (ii) at least \n4 years of relevant teaching or industry experience, and (iii) at least 8 hours of training relevant to the subject area \nspecialization. \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nof  teachers  (and  students)  to  teach  (and  learn)  specialized  subjects.  This  is  partly  caused  by \ndelays in the centralized procurement of these critical inputs. The JHS ESC and SHS voucher \nprograms  provide  increased  options  to  male  and  female  students  to  choose  their  secondary \nschool.  However,  the  subsidy  programs\u2019  effectiveness,  cost,  equity  of  access,  and  quality \nassurance  processes  need  careful  examination  to  maximize  positive  outcomes.  Finally,  two \ndecades  of  school-based  management  (SBM)  implementation  in  the  country  show  that  key \nstakeholders need to be actively involved to continuously improve student learning outcomes.10 \nThe  establishment  of  school  governance  councils  could  provide  a  strong  mechanism  to  foster \ncommunity engagement and strategic partnerships. The previous system of assessing the SBM \npractice of each school needs to be invigorated, given its important link to improving schools and \nstudent learning outcomes. \n \nB. \n \n9. \nThe  program  will  complement  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  SHS  Support  Program  (footnote  2)  by \nsupporting reforms at the JHS level and addressing emerging issues in SHS. The program aligns \nwith ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the Philippines 2018\u20132023, which supports improved \naccess to quality secondary education.11 It will complement ADB support to the conditional cash \ntransfer program, which provides education grants to secondary school children belonging to poor \nfamilies; and the JobStart Philippines Program, which focuses on getting youth from education to \nemployment.12 The program is also aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 (Table 1).13 \n \n\nProgram Rationale \n\nTable 1: Alignment with Strategy 2030 \n\nStrategy 2030 Priorities \n1.

This includes (i) \nintegrating gender in the secondary education curriculum and in the analysis of \ntest results, (ii) deploying qualified male and female master teachers, and \n(iii) mobilizing female and male career advocates in secondary schools. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n10. \nPerformance of current results-based lending program. The SHS Support Program \nincreased  whole-of-government  support  and  resources  to  achieve  results  and  implement  the \nreforms  and  innovations  embedded  in  the  results  indicators.  The  SHS  Support  Program  also \nsupported the establishment and smooth rollout of the SHS level, starting with the development \nof the SHS curriculum. The SHS Support Program supported key results including the hiring of \n47,000  science  and  math  teachers,  which  allowed  DepEd  to  achieve  its  minimum  service \nstandard  for  the  number  of  qualified  teachers  per  student  in  DepEd  SHSs.  The  SHS  Support \nProgram was instrumental in the development and effective implementation of the SHS voucher \n\n                                                \n10  F.  Yamauchi.  2014.

Strong government ownership of \nthe results has ensured continued commitment despite leadership changes. Technical assistance \n(TA) provided by ADB improved DepEd\u2019s capacity to rigorously monitor the implementation of the \noverall SHS Support Program.14  \n \n11. \nLessons  learned.    ADB  has  applied  lessons  learned  from  the  SHS  Support  Program \nengagement in designing the proposed program. First, there should be strong commitment and \nsupport  at  all  levels  of  the  executing  agency  to  achieve  the  results  and  sustain  reform \nimplementation. Second, there is a need to provide TA to strengthen government systems and \nsupport  the  achievement  of  the  agreed  results.  Third,  the  use  of  an  interagency  program \ncoordination  committee  improves  implementation  and  addresses  operational  bottlenecks. \nBuilding on these lessons, program preparation involved extensive consultation with DepEd and \nother stakeholders to align with government priorities, capacity, resources, and commitment. \n  \n12. \nProgram  modality.    Based  on  the  experience  and  successes  of  the  SHS  Support \nProgram,  the  use  of  the  results-based  lending  (RBL)  modality  was  selected  for  the  proposed \nprogram. The government\u2019s secondary education reform agenda, which the program will support, \nis  extensive\u2014covering  8,751  DepEd  schools,  5,210  private  schools,  293,086  public  school \nteachers,  223  schools  divisions,  17 regions,  and  10.6  million  learners.  The  RBL  modality  is \nappropriate to support the government\u2019s reform agenda because it focuses on critical results and \nsystem reforms, rather than specific transactions and expenditures as in the case of the project \nmodality. The RBL modality will leverage resources to advance key systemic and policy reforms \nand  catalyze  increased  government  and  development  partner  resources  to  support  the \nachievement of the program results. Given that the program\u2019s systems are applied, and reforms \nare implemented by government staff, the RBL modality will strengthen internal systems, enhance \nsustainability, and institutionalize good practices and initiatives. \n \n13. \nADB  value  addition.  ADB\u2019s  pioneering  support  for  Philippine\u2019s  secondary  education \nhelped achieve key  reforms,  including  the  recent  transition to a  K to 12 basic  education  cycle. \nADB has provided direct support to the DepEd in the design and implementation of the ALS and \nthe  SHS  voucher  program  and  will  continue  to  mobilize  support  to  improve  the  programs\u2019 \neffectiveness. Reforms on teacher development, curriculum development, student assessment, \nand  technical-vocational  education  will  be  supported,  given  ADB\u2019s  extensive  engagement  and \nexperience  in  implementing  similar  reforms  in  several  Asian  countries.    Financing  and \nengagement  from  the  private  sector  and  key  partners  will  be  leveraged  by  improving \nimplementation  of  the TVL  track  and  SBM.  Institutional  and  capacity  development  on financial \nmanagement (FM), procurement, and career guidance will be provided through ADB TA support \n(footnote 3). \n \nC. \n \n14. \nThe  program  will  support  the  development  and  implementation  of  reforms  under  the \ngovernment\u2019s  secondary  education  program from  2019  to  2023.  Following the  RBL  policy,  the \nprogram will not include high-value procurement contracts and packages.15 \n\nProgram Scope \n\n \n \n\n                                                \n14 ADB.  2015.

The \noutcome will be improved secondary level student learning outcomes and completion rates.  The \nprogram  will  primarily  benefit  current  and  future  students  who  will  gain  increased  access  to  a \nhigher quality and more relevant secondary education that is aligned to 21st century labor market \nneeds. Teachers will also benefit from the increased professional development opportunities and \na clear career advancement pathway. Of the six disbursement-linked indicators (DLIs), DLI 1 will \nassess the achievement of the outcome by the improved performance of students in the NAT and \nin the SHS TVL national competency assessment. The rest of the DLIs are grouped into three \nprogram  outputs  and  described  in  paras.  16\u201318.  The  DLIs  are  summarized  in  Table  3  and \nAppendix 3, Table A3.1.16  \n \nOutput 1: Quality and relevance of the secondary education program improved. This \n16. \noutput  will  strengthen  the  secondary  education  curriculum  and  assessment  system,  which  is \nexpected to equip approximately 10.6 million learners currently in the system, and an additional \n2 million grade 7 entrants each year during 2019-2023 with essential competencies for lifelong \nlearning and employability. To address the learning needs of some 2.5 million out-of-school youth \nwho are not able to attend SHS formal education, the SHS-level ALS curriculum will be aligned \nwith the K to 12 curriculum (DLI 2, program action plan [PAP] 1.1)17 and pilot tested in a few areas \n(DLI  2). The  scope and sequence  of the math,  science,  and  English  curriculum  guides  will  be \nreviewed and revised to make them responsive to learners\u2019 needs, the labor market, and issues \naffecting youth (e.g., teenage pregnancy, substance abuse) (DLI 2). Grades 10 and 12 summative \ntests will be strengthened, and the results disseminated and analyzed (including from a gender \nperspective) to drive teaching and learning improvements. The DepEd schools division office staff \n\n                                                \n16 A detailed description of the DLI indicators and the corresponding verification protocols are in Appendix 3. \n17 Program Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nwill be trained to analyze the test results to initiate needed adjustments in the teaching process \n(DLI 2, PAP 1.5). The TVL specializations offered in DepEd schools will be reviewed to align with \nstudent preferences, community needs, industry requirements, and labor market demand (DLI 3, \nPAP1.3). A tracking system will be developed to measure the national competency passing rate \nof TVL students (DLI 3). \n \n17. \nOutput  2:  Quality  of  secondary  education  teachers  improved.  Recognizing  the \nimportance of teacher quality in engendering better learning outcomes, this output will support \nmeasures  to  enhance  teacher  motivation,  increase  teacher  proficiency  through  professional \ndevelopment  and  career  advancement  opportunities,  and  increase  the  number  of  qualified \nteachers.  A  policy  which  establishes  career  paths  for  teachers  will  be  adopted  to  provide \nincentives  that  will  attract  qualified  male  and  female  candidates  into  teaching,  retain  qualified \nteachers, and improve the link between teachers\u2019 professional development needs and training \nprograms (DLI 4). Vacant master teacher positions will be filled in line with the teachers\u2019 career \npath requirements (DLI 4, PAP 2.3), and more teachers will be hired to meet the minimum service \nstandards  for  teacher\u2013student  ratios  in  math,  science,  and  Filipino  (DLI  4).  A  comprehensive \nprofessional  development  program  will  be  developed  and  implemented  to  improve  teacher \nproficiencies in line with the teacher professional standards (DLI 4). The current 293,086 public \nsecondary  education teachers  and  additional teachers  who  will  be  hired during  2019-2023  will \nbenefit from the improved teaching practice, content knowledge and quality of instruction, which \nwill ultimately redound to improved student learning outcomes. \n \n18. \nOutput  3:  Secondary  education  sector  management  strengthened.  To  support \nDepEd\u2019s financial management reforms, institutional arrangements, including the establishment \nof the DepEd financial management reform committee, will be implemented (DLI 5, PAP 3.1). The \nprogram will ensure that schools receive their maintenance and other operating expenses budget \non time (DLI 5, PAP 3.3). The budget for tools, equipment, and school furniture will be released \nto  schools  division  offices  to facilitate timely  procurement  and delivery  to schools  (DLI  5,  PAP \n3.4). The program will assess the effectiveness of subsidy programs (ESC and voucher program), \nand improvements will be adopted to improve implementation of these programs (DLI 5). Output \n3 will also support measures to strengthen SBM to empower schools and their key partners to \ntake a more active role in improving student learning outcomes and alignment to labor market \ndemands.  School  governance  councils  (with  gender-balanced  representation  among  parents, \nstudents, and teachers) will be established (DLI 6, PAP 3.9). The SBM assessment framework \nwill  be  revised  to  strengthen  stakeholder  engagement  and  accountability  and  promote  a \nconducive and safe learning environment (DLI 6, PAP 3.12). The financial management and SBM \nreforms  are  expected  to  improve  spending  efficiency,  reduce  bottlenecks  especially  at  the \nfinancing  level,  and  ensure  better-informed  school  plans  and  actions.  The  reforms  will  benefit \n8,751  public  secondary  schools  and  223  schools  division  offices,  while  improvements  in  the \nsubsidy programs will benefit close to 1 million students and 5,210 private schools. \n \n\nTable 3: Disbursement-Linked Indicators  \n\nIndicator \nOutcome \nDLI 1   Learning outcomes for male and female secondary education students \nimproved \nOutputs \nDLI 2   Secondary education curriculum and assessment strengthened \nDLI 3   Quality and relevance of TVL education in secondary schools improved \nDLI 4   Quality of teachers in secondary education improved \nDLI 5   Secondary education financing system strengthened \n\n \n\n \n\n40.0 \n\n60.0 \n32.5 \n65.0 \n62.5 \n\n13.33 \n\n20.00 \n10.84 \n21.67 \n20.83 \n\nDisbursement \nAllocated \n($ million) \n\nShare of Total \nADB \nFinancing (%) \n\n\f7 \n\nDLI 6   School-based management in secondary schools strengthened \n\nTotal \n\n40.0 \n300.0 \n\n13.33 \n100.00 \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, DLI = disbursement-linked indicator, TVL = technical-vocational-livelihood. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nAchievement of DLIs will be verified based on a rigorous verification protocol, agreed with \n19. \nthe government and performed by outside entities independent of the DepEd.

The  government  will  finance  $23,777.4  million  (98.8%)  of  the \n$24,077.4  million  cost  of  implementing  the  program.  To  address  government\u2019s  financing \nrequirements, and to support DLI achievement, advance financing of up to 25% of the total loan \namount can be provided. Financing of prior results achieved not more than 12 months before loan \nsigning will be allowed (up to 20% of the total loan amount). However, disbursements can only be \nmade once the program is effective. The combined outstanding balance of advance financing and \nfinancing for prior results cannot exceed 30% of the total loan amount. \n \n22. \nThe  government  has  requested  a  regular  loan  of  $300,000,000  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance the program. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on the annuity method \nwith 10% discount factor, the average maturity is 18.31 years and the maturity premium payable \nto ADB is 0.20% per year. \n \n23. \n \n\nThe financing plan is summarized in Table 5. \n\nTable 5: Program Financing Plan \n\nSource \nGovernment \nAsian Development Bank \n \n\nOrdinary capital resources (regular loan) \n\nTotal \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nAmount ($ million) \n23,777.4 \n\nShare of Total (%) \n\n \n300.0 \n24,077.4 \n\n98.8 \n \n\n1.2 \n100.0 \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nCapacity Development and Program Action Plan \n\n \n24. \nDisbursement arrangements. Except for advance financing, which will be based on the \nachievement  of  future  DLIs,  ADB  disbursement  will  be  made  following  achievement  and \nverification of DLIs (Appendix 3). Disbursements will be allowed for early or late achievement of \nDLIs.  Partial  disbursements  will  be  allowed  for  some  DLIs.  Disbursements  will  not  depend  on \nevidence  of  expenditure  or  transactions.  The  government  will  ensure  that  total  program \nexpenditures  are  equal  to,  or  exceed,  the  total  amount  of  the  loan  withdrawn.  Before  the \ndisbursement of loan proceeds, the Department of Finance will submit a withdrawal application, \nalong  with  evidence  verifying  DLI  achievement  in  accordance  with  the  verification  protocol.  In \ncase advance financing was utilized, the government will refund any outstanding advance within \n6  months  of  program  completion  if  DLIs  are  not  achieved  by  program  completion.  The  loan \nproceeds will be disbursed to an account specified by the government. \n \nF. \n \n25. \nThe  PAP  will  support  capacity  development  in  program  areas,  including  review  of  the \ncurriculum,  education  assessment,  collection  of  sex-disaggregated  data  to  assess  student \nlearning, teacher proficiency, gender analysis, and SBM. It will also support the implementation \nof DepEd\u2019s financial management and procurement reforms. \n \nG. \n \n26. \nDepEd will be the executing agency and will implement the program through its central, \nregional,  schools  division  offices,  and  secondary  schools.  DepEd\u2019s  Executive  Committee  will \nserve  as  the  program  steering  committee  and  will  set  strategic  directions  and  provide  overall \noperational  guidance.18 A  program  implementation  and  coordination  committee,  composed  of \nDepEd  implementing  units,  will  coordinate  implementation  of  DLI  and  PAP,  and  address \noperational bottlenecks. An expanded program implementation and coordination committee will \ninclude  key  officials  from  the  Departments  of  Finance  and  Budget  and  Management,  and  the \nNational Economic and Development Authority; and will discuss key implementation requirements \nthat need their support or intervention. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements  \n\nIII. \n\nSUMMARY OF ASSESSMENTS \n\nProgram Technical Assessments \n\n \nA. \n \nThe DLIs and PAP, which have been selected, prioritized, and vetted through a rigorous \n27. \nconsultation process with government, directly respond to key secondary education issues and \nchallenges. The results and planned actions are designed to improve learning outcomes and will \ncontribute  directly  to the  secondary  education graduates\u2019  increased  productivity,  employability, \nand  readiness  to  pursue  further  education.  The  DLIs  and  PAP  are  underpinned  by  the \ngovernment\u2019s reform agenda and priorities in secondary education. These are based on extensive \nanalyses  undertaken  by  ADB  and  the  government.  The  targeted  results  are  likely  to  be \nsustainable  in  the  medium-term  since  they  will  increase  spending  efficiency  and  gain  strong \nstakeholder support once in place. Overall, the program has sound design and implementation \narrangements,  and  a  well-designed  results  framework.  The  DLIs  are  critical  indicators  for \nachieving the program results. \n \n\n                                                \n18 The secretary of education chairs the Executive Committee, and all undersecretaries and assistant secretaries are \n\nmembers. \n\n\f9 \n\nAs  part  of  the  government\u2019s  secondary  education  program,  the  program  will  improve \n28. \nemployment  opportunities  and  incomes  of  graduates  in  two  ways:  (i)  by  equipping  them, \nespecially  those  taking  the  TVL  track,  with  sufficient  competencies  to  qualify  them  for  good-\nquality, higher-paying jobs even if they do not intend to pursue further studies; and (ii) by preparing \nthem  to  pursue  higher  education.  This  means  that  the  program  will  contribute  to  raising  their \nincomes closer to levels earned by post-secondary technical-vocational graduates (about 30% \nhigher, on average, based on data from the Labor Force Survey), and even higher (about 86%) if \nthey are able to complete college.19 \n\n29. \nThe poor, who are mainly enrolled in DepEd schools or its nonformal education program, \nwill  have  greater  access  to  better  and  more  affordable  education  because  of  the  proposed \nprogram. They will also have better opportunities to pursue post-secondary education and training \nor  improve  their  chances  of  getting  better  jobs  and  raising  their  incomes.  The  program  will \nencourage  the  poor,  who  would  otherwise  not  have  completed  high  school,  to  complete  high \nschool. These outcomes can be attributed to the improved quality of secondary education. \n\nProgram Systems Assessments \n\nThe program is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. It aims to achieve gender \n30. \nequality results through actions that are gender-sensitive and responsive to the needs of female \nand male learners. The following key gender elements and actions are embedded in the DLIs: (i) \nintegration of gender perspective in the analysis of NAT results; (ii) youth-relevant issues such as \nsubstance abuse, sexual and reproductive health, and teenage pregnancy, adequately addressed \nthrough  curriculum  revision;  (iii)  having  two  teachers  (preferably  one  female  and  one male)  in \neach secondary school trained, certified, and designated as  career advocates  to provide career \nguidance to students free of gender bias and stereotypes ; and (iv) monitoring the progress and \nperformance of a conducive and safe learning environment (free of gender-based discrimination \nand violence, and bullying), and making this an integral part of the SBM assessment framework. \n \nB. \n \n31.  Monitoring and evaluation system. DepEd\u2019s existing monitoring and evaluation systems \nare robust and will allow timely reporting and monitoring of implementation and results. However, \nfurther improvements are required, including establishing protocols to regularize data collection \n(e.g.,  passing rates  of completers  in  the  national  competency  assessment),  encoding the  data \ninto the enhanced basic education information system, and improving the link between the learner \ninformation  system  and  the  ESC  and  voucher  monitoring  systems.  DepEd\u2019s  program \nmanagement  service  will  be  responsible  for  consolidating  reports  from  DepEd\u2019s  implementing \nunits and ensuring the timely submission of progress reports to ADB and DepEd. \n \n32. \nFiduciary systems. The FM assessment of DepEd concluded that overall pre-mitigation \nFM  risk  is  substantial.  DepEd\u2019s  FM  has  improved  from  2014  to  2017,  but  some  weaknesses \nremain, such as the limited number and weak capacity of internal audit staff. An action plan to \naddress  these  issues  has  been  formulated  with  DepEd  (PAP  3.1,  3.2,  3.3,  3.6,  and  3.7).  A \nprocurement  capacity  assessment  of  DepEd  indicates  that  its  procurement  system  has  the \ninstitutional  arrangements  to  implement  reforms,  but  it  also  has  key  challenges.  Procurement \nplanning and compliance monitoring are weak. This causes delays in procurement and delivery \nof  critical  inputs  to  end-users.  Risk  mitigating  measures  include  capacity  building  of  field-level \nstaff on procurement planning and hiring additional qualified staff to handle major procurement \nactivities. \n\n                                                \n19 Government  of \n\nhttps://psa.gov.ph/statistics/survey/labor-and-employment/labor-force-survey (accessed 21 October 2018). \n\nthe  Philippines,  Philippine  Statistical  Authority.  2017.

The  program  is  categorized  C  for  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples.  Therefore,  no  program  safeguards  system  assessment \nwas  undertaken.  No  construction  or  renovation  activities  will  occur,  and  no  land  acquisition  or \nrestriction of land use will trigger any of ADB\u2019s safeguards policy principles. Indigenous peoples \ncommunities will not be specifically targeted. No differential impacts are expected. \n \nC. \n \n35.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  described  in  detail  in  the  integrated  risk \nassessment and mitigating measures.21 Risks include (i) unanticipated economic slowdown which \nreduces  school  participation  rates  and  government\u2019s  fiscal  capacity  to  provide  services;  (ii) \nchange  in  government  leadership,  leading  to  a  change  of  priorities  and  weakened  support  to \nreforms  embedded  in  the  program\u2019s  results  framework;  (iii)  insufficient  funding  for  proper \nimplementation of the SHS TVL track, which requires substantial investment in equipment and \nlaboratories; (iv) limited number and weak capacity of DepEd\u2019s internal audit service staff; and (v) \nweak procurement capacity at central and subnational levels, leading to delays in procurement of \ncritical inputs. Risk mitigating measures include (i) integrating efficiency and cost-effectiveness \nmeasures in FM reforms; (ii) broadening support by mobilizing multi-stakeholder engagement at \nnational  and  local  levels;  (iii) ensuring full  implementation  of the  basic  education medium-term \nexpenditure plan, 2019\u20132023, which includes the TVL track; (iv) strengthening audit procedures \nand  training  DepEd\u2019s  internal  audit  staff;  and  (v)  conducting  procurement  training  of  Bids  and \nAwards Committee and procurement staff, with a focus on procurement planning. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nThe government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the RBL program, which \n\n \n36. \nare set forth in the loan agreement. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n37. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  results-based  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nloan  of  $300,000,000  to  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines  for  the  Secondary  Education  Support \nProgram, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in regular terms, with interest to be determined \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term \nof  25  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement  presented  to  the \nBoard. \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n \n24 April 2019 \n\n                                                \n20 ADB. 2013.
