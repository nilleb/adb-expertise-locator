The  EARR  will  rehabilitate  and  reconstruct \neducation, water supply, and water resources infrastructure; ports and an airport.  \n \n2. \nIn line with the Master Plan for Recovery and Reconstruction for Central Sulawesi (the \nMaster Plan), 1 the EARR will support the Government of Indonesia in building back better 2 critical \ninfrastructure damaged by the devastating disasters in Central Sulawesi Province in September \n2018, where a 7.4-magnitude earthquake triggered a near-field tsunami, landslides, and major \nliquefaction.  The  proposed  EALs  respond  to  the  government\u2019s  formal  request  to  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) made on 3 May 2019, for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of critical \ninfrastructure in Central Sulawesi. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE \n\n \nA. \n \n\nRationale \n\n1. \n\nDisaster Risk, Recent Disasters, and Damage and Losses \n\n \n3. \nDisaster risk in Indonesia. Indonesia is exposed to a wide range of natural hazards\u2014\nearthquake, liquefaction, 3 tsunami, volcanic eruptions, landslides, floods, and droughts. Disasters \ntriggered  by  natural  hazards  cause  significant  loss  of  life  and  destruction  to  physical  assets. \nBetween  2005  and  2017,  these  disasters  affected  the  lives  of  more  than  11  million  people. \nDisaster  risk  modeling  estimates  show  that,  over  a  longer  period,  Indonesia  experiences  an \naverage annual loss of about $9.2 billion as a consequence of natural hazards, mostly from floods, \nvolcanic  eruptions,  and  earthquakes. 4  These  numbers  are  expected  to  increase  as  a  result  of \nclimate  change  and  rapid  uncontrolled  development  which  will  likely  intensify  the  exposure  of \nassets to hazards. \n \n4. \nRecent disasters. On 28 September 2018, a 7.4-magnitude earthquake struck Central \nSulawesi  Province  in  Indonesia. 5  The  earthquake  triggered  a series  of  cascading  events: (i)  a \nnear-field  tsunami,  which  struck parts  of the  coasts  in  the  city  of  Palu  and the  districts  of  Sigi, \nDonggala,  and  Parigu  Moutong;  (ii)  landslides;  and  (iii)  major  liquefaction,  which  affected \n1.4 million people. A total of 2,081 people died, 1,309 were missing, 4,438 injured, and more than \n200,000 people displaced. 6 \n                                                 \n1  National  Development  Planning  Ministry  (BAPPENAS).  2018.

Jakarta. \n\n2  The term \u201cbuild-back-better\u201d refers to the use of recovery, rehabilitation, and reconstruction phases after a disaster \nto  increase  the  resilience  of  nations  and  communities  by  integrating  disaster  risk  reduction  measures  into  the \nrestoration of physical infrastructure and societal systems, and into the revitalization of livelihoods, economies, and \nthe environment.

Geneva. \n5   On 5 August 2018, a 7.0 magnitude earthquake hit Lombok in West Nusa Tenggara Province which resulted in 515 \ndeaths,  over  7,700  injuries,  and  displacement  of  over  430,000  people.  As  government  resources  are  used  for \nreconstruction of Lombok, the EARR will cover rehabilitation and reconstruction of Central Sulawesi Province only.  \n6  ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management. 2018. Situation Update No.15. \n\nJakarta. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\nDamages and losses. The National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) identified severe \n5. \ndamage to housing, infrastructure, and livelihoods. Government estimates show that the damage \nand losses from the Central Sulawesi disasters reached Rp24.11 trillion ($1.70 billion equivalent); \nthe heaviest damage was to housing, water supply, irrigation, roads, bridges, airport, and ports. \nTable 1 summarizes the damage, losses, and needs for public and private assets. 7 The damage \nis  higher  than  the  losses,  highlighting  the  physical  destruction  of  assets  and  the  need  for \nrehabilitation and reconstruction. \n \n\nTable 1: Damage, Losses, and Needs (Central Sulawesi, 2018) \n(Rp million) \nLosses \nSector \n1,659,407 \nSettlements \n1,194,287 \nInfrastructure \n84,572 \nSocial \n1,900,059 \nEconomic \n17,840 \nCrosscutting \n   Total \n4,856,165 \nSources:  Government  of  Indonesia,  National  Disaster  Mitigation  Agency \n(BNPB), and United Nations Development Programme. \n\nNeeds \n 7,621,751 \n18,386,649 \n4,848,030 \n3,860,825 \n1,514,258 \n36,231,513 \n\nTotal \n8,821,886 \n6,594,108 \n2,057,274 \n6,254,175 \n379,685 \n24,107,128 \n\nDamage \n7,162,479 \n5,399,822 \n1,972,702 \n4,354,117 \n361,845 \n19,250,965 \n\n2. \n\nImpact on Economy, Poverty, and Gender \n\n \n6. \nMacroeconomic  impact.  The  gross  regional  domestic  product  for  Central  Sulawesi  is \nexpected to fall by 4.5% and the economy is not likely to recover to pre-disaster levels until 2021. 8 \nADB estimates suggest a potential negative impact on the national growth rate as high as 0.1% \nof gross regional domestic product for 2019, representing losses of Rp16.2 trillion ($1.1 billion \nequivalent). \n \n7. \nImpact on poverty. In March 2018, before the disasters, the percentage of the population \nliving below the poverty  line  was 14.0% in Central Sulawesi\u2014high compared with the national \naverage of 9.82%. 9 The poverty gap is also substantially higher than the national average. This \nsuggests that the poor are likely to be pushed deeper into poverty because of the disasters. ADB \nestimates  suggest  an  increase  in  the  poverty  incidence  from  14.0%  before  to  16.6%  after  the \ndisasters in Central Sulawesi. \n \n8. \nGender impact. The impact of the disasters is particularly acute for women and girls. The \nInternational  Organization  for  Migration  estimated  that  more  than  half  of  the  Central  Sulawesi \ninhabitants  internally  displaced  because  of the  disasters  are  women. Of the  1.4  million  people \naffected by the disasters, more than 350,000 are women of reproductive age at increased risk of \nsexual and gender-based violence; and 45,300 were pregnant during the time of the disasters. \nFollowing  the  disasters,  the  burden  of  work  on  women  and  the  time  spent  on  household  and \ncaring responsibilities are likely to have increased. If women are involved in leading the recovery \nand reconstruction, they can become important agents of change. \n \n\n                                                 \n7  Damage is the replacement costs of physical assets and infrastructure totally or partially destructed in the affected \nareas; losses are changes in economic flows arising from the disaster which continue until the achievement of full \nrecovery and reconstruction; and needs is the amount of finance required to reconstruct the damaged infrastructure \nand  physical  assets  to  higher  standards  of  resilience.

The  disasters  damaged  public \nbuildings  (government  buildings,  schools,  hospitals,  and  health  centers);  private  housing;  and \nurban infrastructure facilities (water supply and sanitation system): \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nAbout 68,200 houses were partially damaged or destroyed across Palu, Donggala, \nSigi, and Parigu Moutong, leading to significant displacement. Since reconstruction \nis impossible in the liquefaction-affected areas, new sites need to be identified for \nthe relocation of affected households. \nAbout  1,500  educational  institutions  were  damaged,  of  which  318  were  severely \ndamaged.  The  damages  in  educational  institutions  resulted  in  losses,  including \ndisruption in the academic calendar because of school closures and arrangements \nfor temporary schools. \n67 health centers and 17 hospitals were damaged in Central Sulawesi, hampering \nhealth service delivery and the response to the expected outbreak of diseases, such \nas dengue and malaria. \n\n(iv)  Prior to the disasters, about 23,000 households in Palu city were connected to a \npiped water system. As a result of damage to water intakes, water treatment plants, \nand  the  water  supply  network,  it  is  estimated  that  currently,  only  about  10,000 \nhouseholds  are  connected  to  a  piped  water  system,  resulting  in  increased \ndependence on groundwater sources that could be contaminated by the corpses of \nvictims buried in liquefaction sites. \n\n \n10.  Water  resources  and  associated  infrastructure.  About  42  km  of  the  Palu\u2013Sigi\u2013\nDonggala (PASIGALA) raw water transmission was damaged, compromising water supply to all \nthree centers. In addition, the Gumbasa irrigation system, supplying a command area of 8,180 \nhectares, was destroyed, leaving 5,000 farmers without access to irrigation water for the 2019 \nplanting season. The farmers lost their 2018 harvest and harvests for the next two seasons are \ncompromised, with an estimated yield loss of 48,000 tons per harvest. The damages to 16 km of \nriver ways and 20 km of coastal protection exposed about 30,000 households to flood risks.  \n \n11. \nConnectivity and transport infrastructure. The disasters damaged at least 100 km of \nroad network and 11 bridges in Central Sulawesi. The 2,500-meter runway at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri \nAirport, the main airport in Central Sulawesi, suffered significant damage along its entire length, \nleaving  only  a  2,250-meter  section  of  runway  available  for  aircraft  operations.  The  airport\u2019s \nterminal building, warehouse, control tower, and other structures suffered serious damage and \nnow pose safety risks to occupants. Damage to marine facilities, backup and storage areas, and \nbuildings  significantly  reduced  operations  at  the ports  of  Pantoloan,  Donggala,  and Wani. The \ndamaged transportation infrastructure severely limits rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts. \n \n\n4. \n\nRehabilitation and Reconstruction Strategy \n\n \n12. \nGovernment\u2019s  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  strategy.  The government finalized \nthe Master Plan in December 2018; the National Development Planning Ministry (BAPPENAS) \nled the process in coordination with other line agencies, including the Ministry of Public Works \nand Housing (MPWH), the Ministry of Agrarian Affairs and Spatial Planning, the Ministry of Energy \nand  Mineral  Resources,  BNPB,  and  the  Geospatial  Information  Agency.  Recognizing  that  the \nliquefaction-prone areas in Central Sulawesi are not suitable for reconstruction, the Master Plan \nidentifies the relocation sites for planning by the MPWH. \n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fDevelopment  partner  coordination. While  an  early  recovery  cluster  led  by  the  BNPB \n13. \nand  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme  supported  the  provincial  government  in \nassessing the post-disaster and recovery needs, BAPPENAS took the lead in coordinating with \nthe  main  development  partners\u2014including  ADB,  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency \n(JICA),  German  development  cooperation  through  KfW,  and  the  World  Bank\u2014to  finance  the \nlarger rehabilitation and reconstruction needs.

The  government  extended  the  emergency  phase  twice, \nand the transition to the reconstruction phase did not occur until 24 April 2019. The extensions \nwere justified by the complexity of the disaster impacts including complications from liquefaction, \nrequiring  coordination  between  central  and  local  government  agencies  on  exposure  to  future \nnatural disasters, damage assessments, response options, and alignment of the Master Plan for \nreconstruction; and coordination and consolidation of the assistance packages proposed by the \ndevelopment financing agencies involved.  \n \n17.  Modality. The proposed EALs use the sector lending approach, which is considered most \nappropriate because it (i) will support the government in implementing the sector priorities of the \nMaster Plan; (ii) is designed to provide assistance to ease the transition from recovery to normal \ndevelopment through quick support for reconstruction; and (iii) will allow a quick response and \nmaximum flexibility in selecting multiple priority subprojects within the agreed criteria. 17  \n \n\n5. \n\nStrategic Alignment and Value Addition \n\n \n18. \nLessons  from  post-disaster  reconstruction.  A  review  of  ADB-wide  experience  with \nemergency assistance indicates the following lessons: (i) projects must be prepared in line with \nthe  government\u2019s  reconstruction  planning  process  and  timeline,  and  should  focus  on  priority \ninfrastructure;  (ii)  as  implementation  places  a  heavy  burden  on  executing  and  implementing \nagencies, strong consulting support and ADB supervision are needed during implementation; (iii) \nthe criteria for subproject selection should permit simple prioritization of subprojects and demand \nshort implementation periods; and (iv) reconstruction should feature build-back-better principles. \n \n19. \nAlignment  with  ADB\u2019s  strategy.  The  EARR  contributes  to  the  objectives  of  ADB\u2019s \ncountry  partnership  strategy  for  Indonesia,  2016\u20132019. 18  It  is  consistent  with  the  operational \npriorities  of  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030\u2014poverty  alleviation,  gender  equality,  climate  change \nadaptation, disaster resilience and environmental sustainability, and promoting rural development \nand food security. 19 The EARR also promotes a stronger, faster, and integrated response based \non prior experience and knowledge of disaster response approaches, and is delivered through a \nOne ADB team. 20 \n \n20. \nValue  addition  of  ADB\u2019s  engagement.  By  effectively  using  ADB  knowledge  solutions \nand partnerships (footnote 16), the EARR will promote build-back-better principles by (i) designing \ndisaster-resilient infrastructure in consideration of international good practices, new technology, \nand alternative construction materials; (ii) strengthening the capacity of national and subnational \nagencies for constructing disaster- and climate-resilient infrastructure; (iii) strengthening capacity \n                                                 \n17 Subprojects to be selected should meet the following criteria: (i) it should be listed in the Master Plan for Recovery \nand  Reconstruction  for  Central  Sulawesi;  (ii)  it  will  involve  reconstructing,  retrofitting,  or  repairing  damaged \ninfrastructure consistent with the EARR output descriptions; (iii) it will involve restoring, improving or building back \nbetter  damaged  facilities  to  pre-disaster  conditions;  (iv)  it  will  not  include  financing  deferred  operation  and \nmaintenance activities; and (v) it will not be assessed as category A for safeguards. \n\n18 Government  of  Indonesia.  2015.

The national electronic public \nprocurement system may be used, provided the system accommodates necessary modifications \nto comply with ADB requirements. Post review (sampling) will be applied for most procurement \npackages.  All  procurement  packages  under  MOT  and  all  contract  packages  above  $40 million \nand all first packages under the MPWH will follow ADB prior review. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \nA. \n\nTechnical \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nEARR  will  consider  disaster  risk,  climate  hazards,  build-back-better  principles,  and \n36. \ngender-sensitive and inclusive features. Development control regulations and building codes will \nconsider flooding, tsunami, and seismic hazards. Disaster preparedness plans will be developed \nin  consultation  with  the  respective  stakeholders.  Subproject  selection  will  follow  the  agreed \nselection criteria (footnote 17), and the design will (i) consider technical alternatives and select \noptions based on least lifecycle cost and economic viability; (ii) maximize support to communities \nand minimize adverse environmental and social impacts; and (iii) optimize implementation period. \n \nB. \n \n37. \nThe EARR is likely to generate significant social and economic benefits to the affected \npopulation by restoring access to education facilities, water supply services, irrigation, ports, and \nthe airport. However, because of the short time between receiving the financing request from the \ngovernment  and  processing  the  EARR,  it  was  not  possible  to  collect  data  and  undertake  full \neconomic  due  diligence  prior  to  seeking  the  ADB  Board  of  Directors  approval.  Therefore, \neconomic due diligence will be conducted on all subprojects during EARR implementation in line \nwith ADB guidelines on economic analysis to ensure that the subprojects are economically viable. \n \n38. \nEARR-restored infrastructure will be maintained using the respective ministries\u2019 recurrent \nbudget.  The  EARR  will  ensure  that  O&M  processes  and  capacity  are  in  place  to  optimize \ninvestment  sustainability.  Financial  due  diligence,  including  detailed  cost  estimates,  financing \nplan, and financial analysis (recurrent cost analysis for nonrevenue-generating subprojects), will \nbe conducted for each subproject as per the requirements listed in the PAMs. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f30\n\nGovernance \n\nC. \n \n39. \nThe  EARR  implementation  and  financial  management  will  be  aligned  with  the \ngovernment\u2019s  standard  operating  procedures.  The  overall  procurement  classification  for  the \nEARR is medium risk (category medium). The premitigated financial management risk level for \nthe  EARR  is  high  because  of  the  complex  implementation  arrangements  and  the  limited \nexperience of some implementing agencies with management of ADB projects. \n \nFollowing a financial management assessment, risks were identified and are addressed \n40. \nthrough  mitigation  measures  in  the  Financial  Management,  Internal  Control,  Risk  Assessment \nand  Mitigating  Action  Plan, F\nP  which  will  be  closely  monitored  during  EARR  implementation. \nOverall,  EARR  has  a  high  risk  of  not  applying  adequate  financial  management  systems  and \ncontrols  because  of  its  focus  on  quick  implementation.  The  executing  agencies  will  assign  a \nfinancial management specialist to provide support and oversight during implementation and to \nensure that risks and mitigation activities are identified and executed in a timely fashion. \n \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  and  ADB's Integrity  Principles \n41. \nand  Guidelines  were  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government. 31  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAMs (footnote 29). \n \nD. \n \n42. \nBy restoring access to critical infrastructure, the EARR is expected to help mitigate the \nadverse  poverty,  social  and  gender  impacts  of  the  disasters  on  the  affected  population. While \noutputs  under component  1  will  help  restore  livelihoods  and  address food  security  and  health, \noutputs under component 2 will help rehabilitate key infrastructure to support access to markets \nand facilitate trade.  \n \n43. \n\nThe EARR is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming at entry, and its GAP 32 will: \npromote  local  consultations  with  women  (45%  women\u2019s  participation)  in  the \n(i) \nrehabilitation and reconstruction process; \nintegrate gender-responsive and inclusive physical design features and/or safety \nmeasures  for  women,  children,  the  elderly,  and  people  with  disabilities  in  the \nrehabilitated or reconstructed infrastructure; and \ndevelop  safety  standards  for  disaster-resilient  infrastructure  and/or  disaster \npreparedness and response plans. \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n(iii) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n44. \nThe  GAP  was  prepared  to  support  BNPB  Regulation  No.  13  Year  2014  on  Gender \nMainstreaming  in  Disaster  Management,  which  mandates  gender-responsive  planning  and \nbudgeting during rehabilitation and reconstruction. \n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n30 Included in the Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 ADB. 2015.

Subprojects \nclassified as category A for environment, involuntary resettlement, or indigenous people are not \neligible for financing by the proposed EALs. 34 \n \nEnvironment  (category  B).  An  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework \n46. \n(EARF) 35  was  prepared  and  disclosed  on  29  May  2019,  following  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement as well as government laws and regulations. Subprojects in protected areas, including \nthose either legally protected or officially proposed for protection, will not be considered. 36 Initial \nenvironmental examinations and environmental management plans will be prepared consistent \nwith the EARF, and will be incorporated in contract documents to be implemented by contractors \nand monitored by the implementing agencies. \n \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  B).  A  Resettlement  and  Customary  Communities \n47. \nDevelopment Framework (RCCDF) 37 that combines the involuntary resettlement framework with \nthe indigenous people\u2019s development framework was prepared and disclosed on 29 May 2019 \nfollowing  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  as  well  as  government  laws  and  regulations. \nResettlement plans and indigenous people\u2019s development plans will be prepared consistent with \nthe RCCDF. The start of civil works and/or restrictions to the use of land resources will not be \nallowed unless customary communities are fully compensated, and all entitlements provided. 38 \n \nIndigenous people (category B). The EARR will ensure that indigenous people affected \n48. \nby  the  disasters  will  receive  culturally  appropriate  social  and  economic  benefits,  participate \nactively in the EARR, and not suffer adverse impacts as a result of the EARR. 39 \n \nThe EARR consultants will  include environment and resettlement specialists to support \n49. \nsafeguard  screening,  preparation,  and  implementation  of  safeguard  plans  consistent  with  the \nEARF  and  the  RCCDF.  Consultants  supporting  the  PIUs  will  collate  and  submit  semiannual \nmonitoring reports (one for the environment and one for involuntary resettlement) that describe \nprogress of safeguard implementation, compliance issues, and corrective actions. Reports will be \nposted  on  the  executing  agencies\u2019  websites  and  made  accessible  to  affected  people.  The \nexecuting  agencies  will  establish  a grievance  redress mechanism to facilitate  the  resolution  of \ncomplaints relating to safeguards. \n \n\n                                                 \n33 ADB.
