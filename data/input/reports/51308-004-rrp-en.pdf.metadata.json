The  project  will  enhance  the  institutional  capacity  of  Meghalaya  Power \nDistribution  Corporation  Limited  (MePDCL)  by  (i)  supporting  the  preparation  of  a  distribution \nsector road map and financial road map to improve MePDCL\u2019s planning capability, and financial \nperformance and sustainability; (ii) introducing innovative components in project design; and (iii) \nbuilding MePDCL\u2019s capacity to monitor project implementation, including the environmental and \nsocial impacts of projects. The project will also support pilot testing of gender and socially inclusive \nrenewable mini grid energy systems, which have the potential for future replication. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3.  \nThe state economy. Meghalaya is a state in northeastern India with a population of about \n3 million that shares its border on the north and east with the state of Assam, and on the south \nand  west  with  Bangladesh.  Meghalaya  has  the  highest  rainfall  in  India,  recording  an  annual \naverage  of  12,000  millimeters.  About  70%  of  the  state  is  covered  with  forest.  Meghalaya  has \nsome of the densest tropical rainforests in the country, and therefore constitutes one of the most \nimportant ecotourism destinations in India. Meghalaya\u2019s economy is predominantly agrarian and \nhas a significant commercial forestry-based industry. The state has abundant natural resources, \nincluding  mineral  deposits  (such  as  coal,  limestone,  granite,  and  clay),  and  offers  significant \nopportunities  for  investment.  In  fiscal  year  (FY)  2019,  the  primary  sector  (agriculture,  forestry, \nmining, and quarrying) contributed 25.92% of gross state domestic product; the secondary sector \n(hydropower,  agro-based  and  food  processing,  chemicals,  and  allied  industries)  contributed \n16.83%; and the tertiary sector, which is the fastest-growing sector, driven by trade, hotels, real \nestate,  finance,  insurance,  transport,  communication,  and  other  services,  contributed  the \nremaining  57.25%.1  Despite  its  rich resource  endowments  and  tourism  potential,  industry  in  the \nstate  continues  to  lag  behind  other  states  because  of  its  poor  infrastructure  facilities.  With  an \naverage annual per capita income of \u20b990,213, Meghalaya is one of the poorest states in the country \nand in the northeastern region.2 Meghalaya is also one of the few states in India that, despite having \nsurplus availability, have low per capita electricity consumption of 832 kilowatt-hours (kWh) against \nthe national average of 1,122 kWh in 2017.3 \n \n4. \nPower sector overview. Under the Meghalaya Power Sector Reforms Transfer Scheme \n2010, the state government unbundled the Meghalaya State Electricity Board into four separate \ncompanies along with their physical assets, properties, liabilities, obligations, and staff. The four \nsuccessor  companies  are  (i)  Meghalaya  Energy  Corporation  Limited  (MeECL),  the  holding \n\n \n\n1  India Brand Equity Foundation. 2019. Meghalaya: Abode of Clouds. Delhi. \n2  Statistics Times. 2019. Indian States by GDP per Capita. According to 2017\u20132018 data, only five states\u2014Assam, \n\nBihar, Jharkhand, Manipur, and Uttar Pradesh\u2014have lower per capita incomes than Meghalaya. \n\n3  EnergySector.in. State-wise per Capita Consumption of Electricity in India.  \n\n \n\n\fcompany;  (ii)  Meghalaya  Power  Generation  Corporation  Limited,  the  generation  utility;  (iii) \nMeghalaya Power Transmission Corporation Limited, the transmission utility; and (iv) Meghalaya \nPower Distribution Corporation Limited (MePDCL), the distribution utility. Although the companies \nwere officially unbundled, the lack of independent finance and administrative functions, together \nwith  poor  financial  management  and  planning  capacity  of  subsidiaries,  hinders  them  from \nprogressing towards financial sustainability. \n \n5. \nMeghalaya had a total installed generating capacity of 613 megawatts (MW) in June 2018, \nof which 426 MW was generated from hydropower (355 MW4 owned by the state utility and 71 \nMW from the central allocation), and the remaining 187 MW was from thermal-based generation \ncapacity from the central government allocation to Meghalaya State.5 Meghalaya draws upon this \ncentral allocation to meet winter season deficits due to low generation from its hydropower plants. \nPeak  demand  in  FY2017  reached  399  MW  and  is  expected  to  reach  470  MW  in  FY2021. \nAdditional generation capacity is required to achieve Meghalaya\u2019s 24X7 Power for All initiative, \nwhich aims to bring an uninterrupted supply to each consumer in the state, even under the normal \nload-growth scenario.6 Meghalaya has surplus generation capacity during summer because of high \nhydropower availability and low demand, but it experiences a capacity deficit in winter because of \nhigh demand and low hydropower availability. \n \n6. \nPower distribution issues. Although Meghalaya achieved 100% electrification for rural \nand urban households (635,802 consumers) in February 2019, the voltage at consumer premises \ndrops below the allowable limit of 6% of the rated voltage during peak load periods. Further, power \ninterruptions of more than 6 hours per day are common in remote rural networks. The average \naggregate  technical  and  commercial  (AT&C)  losses  of  the  distribution  network  in  2017  were \n32.65%.7 AT&C losses attributable to three of the six circles of the Meghalaya distribution network \n(Central, East Garo Hills, and West Garo Hills) are estimated to be more than 50%. Further, the \nexisting  distribution  network  is  overloaded.  Most  of  the  33/11  kilovolt  (kV)  substations  in  rural \nareas have outdated technology and lack control rooms, making it difficult to operate the system, \nparticularly during heavy rains and mist that are prevalent year-round in many parts of the state. \nMePDCL\u2019s billing efficiency is only 67.35% as about 75% of the consumer meters installed by \nMePDCL are outdated, resulting in high commercial losses. High AT&C losses, aged distribution \nassets, and subsidized tariffs for the poor and agricultural consumers are the major reasons for \nthe below-cost revenue recovery that has led to the poor financial state of the distribution utility. \nThe huge capital requirements to develop the aged infrastructure, and the subsidized tariff in rural \nareas  make  rural  electrification  less  attractive  to  the  private  sector.  The  proposed  project  will \nimprove the reliability of distribution network, reduce AT&C losses, and improve financial viability \nand sustainability of MePDCL which may enable private sector participation and competition in \nthe state\u2019s retail distribution business in the future. \n \n7. \nGovernment programs for the distribution sector. 24X7 Power for All Meghalaya was \na joint initiative of the Government of India and the state government of Meghalaya to provide an \nuninterrupted,  quality,  reliable,  and  affordable  power  supply  to  all  domestic,  commercial, \nagricultural, and industrial consumers (footnote 6). MePDCL also signed an agreement with the \nMinistry of Power and the state government of Meghalaya under the Ujwal DISCOM Assurance \n\n \n\n4  Approximately 90% of hydropower plants are run of the river types without storage and hence depend heavily on \n\nimports during winter and low monsoon periods.   \n\n5  Data were obtained from Meghalaya State Load Dispatch Centre in June 2018 during project preparation. \n6   Government of India and Government of Meghalaya. 2015. 24X7 Power for All Meghalaya. Delhi.  \n7  The AT&C losses and billing efficiency data are from a detailed project report prepared by MePDCL. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fYojana  (UDAY)8  scheme  to  reduce  its  AT&C  losses  from  34.76%  in  FY2015  to  15.00%  by \nFY2020. This was to be achieved through various central government supported schemes, such \nas  (i)  the  Integrated  Power  Development  Scheme;9  (ii)  Deen  Dayal  Upadhyaya  Gram  Jyoti \nYojna;10 and (iii) Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana (Saubhagya).11 Although Meghalaya \nachieved 100% electrification through the Saubhagya scheme, the state was not able to achieve \nthe envisaged loss reduction target of 15% and the AT&C losses were at 34.8% in FY 2019. The \nimplementation of identified measures for AT&C loss reduction are progressing slowly because \nof  lack  of  sufficient  funds.  The  project  will  help MePDCL  implement  some  of  these  measures, \nsuch as metering, network strengthening, and billing efficiency improvement to reduce the AT&C \nlosses.  \n \n8. \nImpact  of  coronavirus  disease.  The  global  pandemic  resulting  from  the  novel \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) has significantly impacted the country\u2019s economy. The energy \nsector has not been spared, with the finances of state utilities detrimentally affected by reduced \ndemand from remunerative industrial and commercial consumers. The real toll of the pandemic, \nhowever, is much higher, with livelihoods affected by the shutdown of tourism in the state. The \nelectricity distribution works proposed in the project are essential activities to improve access to \nelectricity in rural areas. These will also create construction-related jobs for the local community, \nincluding  returning  migrant  workers  who  lost  jobs,  which  will  remain  valid  in  a  post  COVID-19 \nrecovery phase. \n \n9. \nAlignment with ADB and country priorities. The project is well aligned with the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) Strategy 2030 operational priorities of (i) promoting rural development \nand food security, and addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities by improving access \nto electricity and creating economic opportunities in rural areas; (ii) accelerating progress in gender \nequality by creating gender and socially inclusive income-generating activities using renewable mini \ngrids;  (iii)  tackling  climate  change,  building  climate  and  disaster  resilience,  and  enhancing \nenvironmental  sustainability  by  reducing  AT&C  losses  and  ensuring  efficient  distribution  of \nindigenous renewable hydropower; and (iv) strengthening institutional capacity by providing support \nin  improving  planning  capability  and  financial  performance.12  The  proposed  investment  is  also \naligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for India, 2018\u20132022 for inclusive infrastructure in \nhinterlands and low-income states, and support for economic growth in the less-developed regions \nof  the  country.13  The  project  will  support  India\u2019s  Nationally  Determined  Contribution  goals14  of \nemission reduction by lowering distribution losses, and United Nations Sustainable Development \n\n \n\n8  Government of India, Ministry of Power.

The project will have the following outcome: efficiency, reliability, and quality of power supply \nto consumers at distribution level in Meghalaya improved.15 \n \n11. \nOutput  1:  Distribution  network  in  Central,  East  Garo  Hills,  and  West  Garo  Hills \nstrengthened  and  modernized.  To  improve  the  reliability  of  power  supply  to  rural  electricity \nconsumers and reduce technical losses, the project will (i) construct 23 new 33/11 kV substations, \nand renovation and modernization of 45 33/11 kV substations, including control room equipment \nand protection systems; (ii) install 136 auto-reclosers and 597 fault passage indicators at 11 kV \nand 33 kV lines; (iii) install and upgrade 2,214 kilometers (km) of 33 kV and 11 kV distribution lines; \nand (iv) renovate the rural distribution network to support mini grid in generation in three selected \nvillages. \n \n12. \nOutput  2:  System  for  meter  reading,  billing,  and  collection  improved.  To  reduce \ncommercial losses, the project will replace existing outdated electromechanical meters with smart \nmeters targeting about 180,000 households (about 29% of consumers), and a new meter-testing \nlaboratory will be installed and commissioned. The project will also implement a smart metering \nscheme  with  online  meter  reading,  billing,  and  collection  with  automatic  disconnection  and \nreconnection of services for up to 75,000 consumers. The project will also be used to evaluate \nthe technical and commercial feasibility for MePDCL in extending smart metering across the state \nin the future. \n \n13. \nOutput 3: Capacity of executing agency to plan and implement distribution sector \nprojects strengthened. This will include support for (i) preparation of a distribution sector road \nmap that will outline immediate, medium-term, and long-term investments, strategies, and policies \nto  systematically  develop  the  distribution  sector  to  meet  future  system  demands  and  service \nstandards;  (ii)  preparation  of  a  financial  road  map  to  support  MePDCL  in  achieving  financial \nsustainability \nin  meeting  UDAY  Financial \nimprovement  action  plans \nRestructuring  Plan  (FRP)  targets,  separating  the  financial  and  human  resources  functions  of \nMePDCL from MeECL, and strengthening their internal audit systems; and (iii) implementation \nsupport to effectively monitor the project and ensure its technical, procurement, and safeguard \ncompliances as required. The road maps and implementation support aim to develop MePDCL\u2019s \ntechnical  and  financial  capacity  to  systematically  plan,  design,  and  manage  the  distribution \nnetworks. \n \n14. \nOutput 4: Efficient and productive use of gender- and socially-inclusive mini grid \nenergy systems pilot-tested and promoted. Renewable energy mini grids will be pilot-tested in \nthe three villages (Lower Jambal, Dilma Ading, and Kosigre), and in three selected schools in the \nvillages.16 The mini grids will improve power quality and support income generation, especially for \nwomen  and  other  socially  disadvantaged  groups,  using  indigenous  energy  resources.  The \nvillagers will be engaged in income-generating activities and provided with relevant skills training, \nstart-up  capital,  and  support  for  market  linkage.  The  project  will  conduct  awareness-raising \n\nfinancial \n\nthrough \n\n15 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n16 The selected schools will be in East Garo Hills and West Garo Hills distribution circles. \n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fValue Added by ADB \n\nsessions for villagers and students on mini grids and their productive use. The activities under \noutput 4 will be supported by JFPR grant.   \n \nC. \n \n15. \nThis  project  will  be  ADB\u2019s  first  energy  sector  intervention  in  Meghalaya.  ADB  has  rich \nfinancing experience in India through previous projects in other states, including in the northeastern \nstate of Assam. ADB will be able to share the lessons and experiences gained from distribution \nimprovement and strengthening projects in Madhya Pradesh and Sri Lanka, and rural electrification \nprojects in Bangladesh and Nepal, and translate these experiences into robust project design and \nimplementation.  ADB  will  help  MePDCL  establish  a  dedicated  project  management  unit  for \nimplementing the project. In addition, ADB has assisted MePDCL in improving its procurement and \nsafeguards  monitoring  capacity  to  meet  the  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \n(2009) and the procurement policy for ADB-financed investments. It is expected that MePDCL will \nmainstream the good practices embedded in ADB policies.  \n \nA  comprehensive  smart  meter  component  incorporating  online  meter  reading  and  billing \n16. \nwith meter fault detection and monitoring feature will be implemented with the potential to expand \ncoverage  across  the  entire  state  in  the  future.  ADB\u2019s  experience  in  developing  mini  grid \ninterventions17  using  local  energy  resources  to  support  gender-  and  socially-inclusive  income-\ngenerating activities in the underdeveloped and poor remote villages will also be explored. ADB has \nalso assisted MePDCL in carrying out (i) surveys, (ii) geographic information system mapping of \ndistribution  networks,  and  (iii)  network  simulation  in  selected  areas  to  ensure  the  design  of  the \nproposed project is optimal. Several distribution components with technology improvements18 will \nbe introduced under the project to modernize their distribution system, adapt to extreme weather, \nand improve the robustness of the system. These project components will also reduce the power \noutages, and the operation and maintenance cost of the distribution system. \n \nD. \n \n17. \nThe project is estimated to cost $168.0 million (Table 1). The project team reviewed the \nimpact  of  COVID-19  on  the  project  and  concludes  that  no  significant  impact  is  expected  on \nimplementation timeline and costs. The labor required for construction of distribution projects is \nlocally available, and no restriction is imposed on supply of materials for essential services such \nas electricity distribution works.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n \n\n17  Some  of  the  similar  interventions  in  South  Asia  region  include:  ADB.  2016.

Medium-level risks associated with climate change impacts affecting \nthe  project  area  include damage  to  distribution  lines  and  substation  facilities  because  of  more \nfrequent  and  more  severe extreme  events  (floods,  storms,  and  lightning).  The  detailed  project \ndesign has incorporated elements to address these risks, including siting of facilities away from \nflood-prone areas, construction of retaining walls, and installation of lightning protection. \n \nB. \n \n25. \nEconomic  viability.  The economic  analysis  was  carried  out  in accordance  with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects.21  Without  the  project,  the  aged  and  low-\nefficiency distribution network would aggravate the current high losses and lead to poor-quality \nservice  in  remote  hilly  areas.  The  project\u2019s  interventions  would  reduce  distribution  line  losses, \nexpand  network  capacity,  and  improve  access  to  electricity  in  rural  areas  of  Meghalaya.  The \neconomic analysis indicates an economic internal rate of return of 19.6% in constant 2019 prices. \nGiven a hurdle rate of 9%, the project is deemed economically viable based on risk and sensitivity \nanalyses.22 \n \n26. \nFinancial viability. A financial cost\u2013benefit analysis was conducted in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects.23  With  the  project, \ncommercial  losses  would  be  reduced  by  preventing  theft,  illegal  connections,  and  meter \ntampering; and by replacing defective meters. The project will also result in a significant reduction \nin technical losses, allowing MePDCL to buy less power to meet the same level of demand. The \n\n \n21 ADB. 2017.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\fresults, confirmed through sensitivity analysis, indicate a financial internal rate of return of 11.0%, \nwhich is  above the  weighted average  cost  of capital  of  8.2%;  therefore, the  project  is  deemed \nfinancially viable. \n \n\nSustainability \n\nThe  retail  supply  tariff  will  be  priced  based  on  the  principles  set  by  the  jurisdictional \n27. \nregulator, the Meghalaya State Electricity Regulatory Commission, which allows full cost recovery \nthrough  a  tariff.24  The  project  would  generate  significant  operating  cash  flows  to  MePDCL  by \nAT&C losses reduction and achieving loss reduction target set by regulator for tariff revision. The \nfinancial  internal  rate  of  return  for  the  proposed  distribution  investment  was  calculated  in  real \nterms on an after-tax basis using 2019 constant prices. \n \nC. \n \n28.  MePDCL  faces  critical  financial  and  operational  sustainability  challenges.  In  FY2016\u2013\nFY2019, it recorded negative profits while its borrowings doubled, mainly because of high AT&C \nlosses and insufficient tariffs. Meghalaya has a weak industrial base and a large share of domestic \nconsumers living below the poverty line. Moreover, industry consumers that pay high tariffs have \nbeen  decreasing.  Furthermore,  Meghalaya\u2019s  geographical  disadvantages  for  grid  electricity \npenetration lead to high losses. MePDCL\u2019s weak financial position should therefore be understood \nin the context of these inherent limitations. \n \n29. \nTo  achieve  financial  turnaround,  the  government  and  MePDCL  have  taken  various \nactions,  which  include  implementing  a  financial  restructuring  plan  (FRP)  and  improving \noperational  efficiency  under  the  UDAY  scheme  (footnote  8).  Under  the  UDAY  FRP,  MePDCL \nshould meet the efficiency improvement target. This includes reducing AT&C losses to 15% by \nFY2020, which MePDCL has yet to achieve because of insufficient investment in the distribution \nsystem.25 Reducing AT&C losses and sustainably improving billing efficiency are the fundamental \nand immediate actions needed for MePDCL to achieve financial sustainability as per UDAY FRP. \nHence, for the financial sustainability of Meghalaya\u2019s power sector, immediate implementation of \nthe project is needed. \n \nD. \n \n30. \nAs part of the power sector reforms in the state, the former Meghalaya State Electricity \nBoard was unbundled in March 2010 into four companies: MeECL and its three subsidiaries (para \n4).  The  financial  management  of  MeECL  and  its  three  subsidiaries  is  plagued  by  the  lack  of \nadministrative  and  financial  autonomy  of  the  subsidiaries  to  manage  their  revenues  and \nexpenditures. The assessed pre-mitigation financial management risk of MePDCL is substantial \nmainly  because  of  the  absence  of  a  separate  and  independent  finance  and  administrative \nfunction,  significant  delay  in  finalizing  accounts,  lack  of  an  effective  budgetary  planning  and \ncontrol system, incomplete fixed asset management, and a weak internal audit system. \n \n31. \nTo  address  these  issues,  MeECL  and  MePDCL  have  agreed  on  comprehensive \ngovernance measures, including ADB\u2019s support to enhance corporate governance and financial \nmanagement.26 The financial road map to be prepared under this project will outline measures to \n\nGovernance \n\nRegulations.

ADB\u2019s \n32. \nAnticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the \ngovernment, MeECL, and MePDCL. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 19).  \n \n33. \nThe procurement capacity assessment of MePDCL was conducted as part of due diligence. \nStrategic procurement planning was conducted to maximize the value for money, and the following \nproject procurement arrangements were chosen to lower transaction costs and realize economy \nand transparency: (i) strategic contract packaging by grouping dozens of sub packages of identical \nnature into one package for each circles; (ii) use of the borrower\u2019s e-procurement system; and (iii) \nqualification criteria based on lowest evaluated cost. \n \nE. \n \n34. \nThe project is located in areas where the majority of residents are poor (poverty target: \ngeneral intervention). Access to a reliable electricity supply will help poor, vulnerable consumers, \nespecially  women,  including  those  who  lack  or  have  limited  access  to  power.  Electricity \nconsumers  in the  state\u2019s  rural  areas  and  the  urban  area  will  be  the  primary  beneficiaries.  The \nproject will contribute to improving the reliability of power supply for existing consumers, and will \nhelp provide an uninterrupted electricity supply for social infrastructure. \n \n35. \nThe project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming and a gender action plan has \nbeen  prepared.  The  JFPR  intervention  is  being  developed  with  an  objective  to  establish \nsuccessful  pilot  for  augmenting  community-led  income  generation  activities  using  renewable \nenergy.  The  project  also  incorporates  gender  indicators  and  targets  to  promote  women\u2019s \nparticipation  in  rural  parts  of  Meghalaya  and  supporting  capacity  development  of  MeECL  and \nMePDCL including gender equality and social inclusion aspects of the energy sector. The loan \nagreements  will  include  standard  assurances  on  core  labor  standards  to  be  complied  with  by \ncontractors. \n \nF. \n \n36. \ncategories are as follows.28 \n \nEnvironment  (category  B).  Given  the  nature,  scale,  and  location  of  the  project \n37. \ncomponents, their potential direct, indirect, cumulative, and induced impacts are anticipated to be \nminor,  site-specific,  generally  reversible,  and  readily  mitigated.  An  initial  environmental \nexamination (IEE) has been undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \nand an  environmental management  plan (EMP) developed.

Most \nproject impacts and risks are of temporary duration during construction.30 Pollution, health, and \nsafety risks to workers and the community will remain during operation and maintenance works. \nMitigation  and  monitoring  measures  reflecting  international  good  practice  are  included  and \nbudgeted  for  (about  $0.5  million  plus  contractor  costs)  in  the  EMP  along  with  performance \nindicators  to  be  achieved,  such  that  no  residual  significant  impacts  are  anticipated.  Given  the \nimplementation,  a  project \nlimited  capacity  of \nimplementation consultant will provide training and support the project management units in EMP \nimplementation. Meaningful consultation,31 including with women, has been and will continue to \nbe undertaken, as detailed in the IEE, which was disclosed locally and on the ADB website on 16 \nApril 2020. \n \n38. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  B).  Potential  impacts  of  distribution  infrastructure \nand JFPR components on land acquisition and involuntary resettlement are not anticipated to be \nsignificant. The project will involve the construction of 23 new 33/11 kV substations, each requiring \na  small  plot  of  land.  About  5.75  hectares  (ha)  of  land  in  total  will  be  required  for  distribution \nsubstations and all the required land for the substations will be acquired through willing-buyer, \nwilling-seller arrangements, and voluntary donation from communities. There should not be any \ncoercion or threat of use of eminent domain in the process. Existing substations will be upgraded \nwithin their existing premises. Construction of 33 kV (771 km) and 11 kV (669 km) new distribution \nlines  will  pass  mostly  along  the  existing  right-of-way  of  roads.  The  distribution  lines  are  pole-\nbased, which do not require land acquisition.  \n \n39. \nFor the JFPR components (output 4), a total of 3,031 square meters of land is required for \nthe  solar  photovoltaic  systems  with  agricultural  processing  units  in  three  villages.  Meaningful \nconsultations have been undertaken, including with women. A combined draft resettlement and \nindigenous peoples plan (RIPP) has been prepared based on the assessment for the MePDCL \nand JFPR components, and in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and national \nregulations. MePDCL and MNREDA will need to secure the budget for RIPP implementation and \nprovide the funds in a timely manner. \n \n40. \nIndigenous peoples (category B). Meghalaya is predominantly a tribal state with about \n86% of total population belonging to a scheduled tribe. The project falls in the territory of East \nGaro Hills, West Garo Hills, and Khasi Hills, which belong to tribal areas according to the Sixth \nSchedule of the Constitution of India. Major tribes found in the project area are the Garo, Khasi, \nand Jaintia. The construction of substations, low-voltage lines, and the JFPR components will not \naffect the dignity, human rights, livelihood systems, or culture of the people, and all other impacts \nwill be mitigated. There will be no involuntary land acquisition or resettlement of people from the \nscheduled  tribes.  Consent  letters  are  being  obtained  for  project  installations,  and  all  land \nacquisition  will  be  completed  before  civil  works  contracts  are  awarded.  There  is  no  targeted \nintervention  for  indigenous  peoples,  and  the  project  impacts  are  addressed  by  implementing \nresettlement measures, thus a combined draft RIPP has been prepared. \n\nCOVID-19 related heath protocols. \n\n \n\n29 Corrective actions required relate to improving substation pollution, health, and safety risk management including \n\n30 These include disturbance to land and communities as project infrastructure is installed; and pollution, health, and \nsafety risks to workers and the community in proximity to works if the construction activities are not well managed. \n31  This involved holding 23 consultation meetings for the distribution components attended by 345 persons in total, and \n3 consultation meetings for the JFPR components attended by 29 persons in total.

Revenue from incremental sales of electricity from \nreduced commercial losses, especially electricity theft, will improve \nthe financial viability of the project and MePDCL. The commercial \nand industrial customers represent only 20%\u201325% of total revenue, \nhence a reduction in demand would not affect MePDCL severely. \nMoreover, demand from domestic consumers is expected to grow \nat a higher rate during this period because of work from home \narrangements and returning migrant workers.  \nThe ongoing technical assistance and loan will assist in the \npreparation of financial statements to facilitate the process. Also, \nMePDCL will augment the accounts personnel in each division. \n\nSignificant delay in finalizing accounts \nleads to corresponding delays in filing of \ntruing-up petitions before MSERC as well \nas disallowance of expenditure by MSERC. \nAT&C = aggregate technical and commercial, MePDCL = Meghalaya Power Distribution Corporation Limited. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n42. \nThe Government of India, the state government of Meghalaya, and MeECL have assured \nADB  that  implementation  of  the  project  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  requirements, \nthose  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement, \nincluding \nconsulting services, financial management, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAM \nand loan documents. \n \nThe Government of India, the state government of Meghalaya, and MeECL have agreed \n43. \nwith ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the draft loan agreement and \nproject agreement. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n44. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan of $132,800,000 \nto  India  for the Meghalaya  Power  Distribution  Sector Improvement  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary \ncapital resources, in regular terms, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 20 years including a grace period \nof 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in the draft loan and project agreements presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\nMasatsugu Asakawa \nPresident \n\n9 October 2020 \n\n32 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n12 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f13  \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nRisks \n\n \nExtreme weather \nconditions beyond design \nassumptions destroy the \ndistribution systems \nconstructed by the project.  \n\n \nIncreases in prices of \nequipment and materials \nexceed contingency and \ninflation forecasts, \nresulting in cost overruns \nand delays in project \ncompletion. \n\nImpact the Project is Aligned with \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\n24x7 power for all households, industries, commercial businesses, public needs, and other electricity \nconsuming entities achieved (24X7 Power for All Meghalaya)a \n\n \n\nPerformance Indicators with \nTargets and Baselines \n\nBy 2026: \na.
