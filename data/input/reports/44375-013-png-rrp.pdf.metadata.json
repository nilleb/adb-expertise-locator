The  reliance  of  coastal \ncommunities  on  shipping  services  is  amplified  by  the  country\u2019s  limited  land-based  transport \nnetwork.  It  is  not  possible  to  travel  by  land  between  most  provinces,  and  most  of  the \n6,500 kilometers  of  coastline  in  the  country\u2019s  maritime  provinces  are  accessible  only  by  sea. \nFurther,  for  many  coastal  communities,  the  development  of  land-based  transport  links  is  not \nfeasible because of remoteness, rugged or inaccessible terrain, and high cost.  \n \n4. \nThe  safety  and  efficiency  of  PNG\u2019s  coastal  transport  infrastructure  directly  affects  the \naccess  of  coastal  communities  to  economic  opportunities  and  key  public  services  such  as \neducation and health facilities, and thus has a significant impact on the inclusiveness of PNG\u2019s \ncontinuing high rates of economic growth.4 The PNG National Household Survey of 1996 shows \nthat  65%  of  the  country\u2019s  poor  live  in  the  coastal  regions  of  Momase,  Islands,  and  Central \nprovinces.5\n  PNG\u2019s  maritime  transport  system  plays  an  integral  part  in  PNG\u2019s  transport  sector \nand facilitates social and economic connectivity, linking to road and aviation transport networks.  \n \n5. \nPNG\u2019s  coastal  transport  infrastructure  also  has  a  significant  role  in  supporting  the \nefficiency of regional shipping services. In 2010, there were about 3,100 international voyages \nbetween  PNG,  the  Australian  east  coast  ports,  and  Asian  ports  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of \nChina,  Japan,  and the Republic  of  Korea. The number  was  about  half of  total  sea  voyages  in \nPNG. 6\n  Although  the  vessels  on  major  routes  usually  carry  radar  and  a  global  positioning \nsystem,  there  are  safety  risks  of  straying  outside  key  passages  and  channels  that  require \nreliance on local knowledge augmented navaids due to high traffic volume and groups of atolls. \n \n6. \nTo  establish  a  safe  and  efficient  maritime  transport  environment  for  international, \nregional, and national traffic, it is necessary to continue to improve the network of navaids in the \ncountry.  Navaids  reduce  risks  such  as  groundings  and  blockage  of  channels  that  can  cause \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   Includes hazard markers and channel markers. \n3   The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.

Childhood \nstunting, a key indicator of nutritional status and poverty, was estimated to be as high as 40.1% of the population in \nthe rural areas of PNG\u2019s island provinces in 2010. This effect is particularly pronounced for females, with 43.4% of \ngirls suffering from stunting.  \n\n5   ADB. 2012. Papua New Guinea: Critical Development Constraints.

Navaids  also  allow \nshipping  operators  to  take  safe  and  economic  shipping  routes  by  recognizing  hazards  along \nroutes, thus increasing the efficiency of transport services.    \n   \n7. \nPrior  to  the  involvement  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  in  the  maritime  sector, \nmany  of  the  country\u2019s  navaids  had  deteriorated  because  of  insufficient  maintenance,  weather \ndamage, volcanic damage, and theft. The ADB-funded Rehabilitation of the Maritime Navigation \nAids  System  Project  improved  the  maritime  transport  environment  by  repairing,  upgrading,  or \nconstructing 211 navaids as public assets along mainly international shipping routes by March \n2008.7\n \n \nBy  late  2005,  the  previous  project  had  also  contributed  to  establishing  the  National \n8. \nMaritime  Safety  Authority  (NMSA)  as  the  agency  responsible  for  navaids  maintenance  and \noperation. Under NMSA\u2019s community engagement program, community lighthouse committees \n(CLCs) have been established at all navaid sites to monitor lights, provide security, and conduct \nbasic  maintenance  using  community  land  lease  fees  and  maintenance  funding  provided  by \nNMSA.  The  program  contributes  to  reducing  theft  and  increasing  community  ownership  of \nnavaids by providing socially centered activities for community welfare and income generation, \nas well as gender equity.8\n The operational status of the navaids provided by the previous project \nis generally good. \n \n9. \nTo build on the successes of the previous project, NMSA seeks to scale up its network \nof  navaids,  increase  the  coverage  of  safety  information,  and  replicate  the  success  of  the \ncommunity engagement program in remote and rural communities. It has identified the need for \n99  navaid  replacements  as  well  as  33  new  navaid  installations  along  PNG\u2019s  coastlines. \nAdditional  navaids  will  help  shipping  operators  guide  their  vessels  through  PNG\u2019s  system  of \nwaterways.  NMSA  has  also  identified  the  need  for  an  improved  traffic  control,  monitoring  and \nsurveillance system; tide gauges; and wider coverage of hydrographic charts to reduce the risks \ndescribed in para. 6 and contain the costs of shipping services as traffic volume increases.9\n To \noperate the new systems and expand the coverage of the charts, it is necessary for NMSA to \nupgrade technical and management skills for more rigorous and quantitative monitoring.    \n \n10. \nBy  improving  the  environment  for  safe  and  economic  maritime  transport,  the  proposed \nproject will produce benefits for rural and remote populations, the wider national population, and \nregional stakeholders in the PNG maritime transport sector. Coastal shipping will be safer and \nmore efficient, risks will be lowered, and vessel accidents and losses will decrease. Passenger \ncapacity will  increase, and delivery of goods and services to coastal communities that depend \non  maritime  transport  will  improve,  because  of  safer  and  potentially  more  frequent  vessel \nservices. The project will have significant benefits for the 65% of PNG\u2019s poor who live in coastal \nregions  through  improved  passenger  and  cargo  services;  easier  access  to  health,  education, \nand  other  services;  and  direct  support  to  communities  in  cash  and  services  provided  by  the \nproject. In addition, the project will benefit international and regional transport services because \n\n                                                \n7 ADB. 2000. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to Papua New \n\nGuinea for the Rehabilitation of the Maritime Navigation Aids System Project. Manila. \n\n8 Community  awareness  programs  focusing  on  small  boat  safety  and  the  importance  of  navaids  structures  were \nprovided.  Also,  20%  of  the  maintenance  fees  paid  to  each  committee  were  dedicated  to  funding  activities  of \nwomen\u2019s groups.  \n\n9 The risk of accidents increased as statistics show 48% increase of traffic volume from 4.68 million tons in 1998 to \n6.94 million tons in 2010 in terms of cargo throughput. On 3 February 2012, MV Rabaul Queen sank off east coast \nand 246 people were rescued while more than 110 people were missing.  \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fof  the  improved  navaids  network,  better  maritime  safety  information  and  hydrographic  charts, \nand  more  effective  search  and  rescue  capacity  with  improved  monitoring  and  surveillance \nsystems.  \n \nThe proposed project will support the government\u2019s Development Strategic Plan 2010\u2013\n11. \n2030,10 and National Transport Strategy to be launched in early 2013 (footnote 6), both of which \nidentify  the  improvement  of  existing  maritime  and  waterways  transport  infrastructure,  as  a \nnational  priority.  Further,  the  project  is  consistent  with  the  strategic  priority  of  the  transport \nsector in ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy 2011\u20132015.11\n \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  impact  will  be  safer  and  enhanced  access  to  socioeconomic  opportunities  by \n12. \ncommunities  in  PNG  and  regional  and  international  stakeholders.  The  project  is  expected  to \nproduce  benefits  for  rural  and  remote  populations  as  well  as  the  national  and  international \npopulations.  The  outcome  will  be  an  environment  for  safe  and  economic  shipping  routes \nprovided by NMSA. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\ninfrastructure;  (iii) \n\nOutput  1:  Replaced, \n\nOutputs  include  (i)  replaced,  installed,  and  maintained  navaids;  (ii)  improved  safety \nimproved  maritime  safety  practice  of  communities;  and \n\n13. \ninformation \n(iv) efficient project management and capacity development. \n \n14. \ninstalled,  and  maintained  navaids.  NMSA  will  replace \n99 existing navaids  and install 33  additional  navaids. These  are  outlined  in  NMSA\u2019s  work  plan \nwith site selection criteria in the project administration manual (PAM).12 To determine priorities, \nthe plan uses engineering aspects, including relationships with PNG\u2019s existing navaids network, \nship traffic density, and environmental conditions. The proposed project will conduct a feasibility \nstudy  that  includes  investigation  of  the  navaids\u2019  local  environment  and  due  diligence \nassessments.  Where  a  need  is  identified,  engineering  design  will  incorporate  measures  for \nadapting to climate change impacts to ensure sustainable maintenance.13\n The project will help \nNMSA  establish  a  sustainable  maintenance  scheme  and  conduct  periodic  maintenance  of \nreplaced  and  installed  navaids  based  on  the  scheme.  Communities  will  participate  in  a \ncommunity engagement program to monitor and secure good condition of navaids based on the \npractice of the previous project (footnote 7). \n \n15. \nOutput 2: Improved safety information infrastructure. NMSA will contract out a large-\nscale hydrographic survey and provide survey data to the Australian Hydrographic Service14 to \nproduce  nautical  charts  and  electronic  navigational  charts  for  seven  ports,  and  recompile \nexisting PNG navigational chart portfolios.15\n NMSA will also extend the automatic identification \nsystem (AIS) network by installing AIS transponders and base stations in at least five sites and \nrelocating three existing stations. The project will confirm the details and configuration of each \nsite  prior  to  commencement  of  works. Tide gauges  will  also  be  installed  in four major  ports  to \nmeasure  changes  in  sea  level  and  contribute  to  the  growing  database  of  climate  change  and \n\n                                                \n10 Government of PNG. 2010.

NMSA  will  provide \nmaritime safety awareness activities for the public and in targeted rural and remote communities \nto change people\u2019s perceptions of maritime safety and improve small craft safety practices. The \nactivities will include a well-planned media campaign and production of high-quality information \nmaterials  aimed  at  different  audiences  (e.g.,  children  and  adults).  Small  craft  safety  training \nactivities  and  materials  for  women  will  be  designed  with  advice  from  the  NMSA  Women  in \nMaritime Association. \n \n17. \nOutput 4: Efficient project management and capacity development. The project will \nhelp NMSA establish a project implementation unit (PIU) to implement and manage all activities \nfunded by the project. The PIU will be staffed by NMSA personnel and new recruits if necessary, \nand  supplemented  by  consultants  to  support  the  PIU  and  to  provide  required  expertise  to \nproduce  outputs  described  above.

A project steering committee will be formed and chaired by NMSA to \noversee and monitor project implementation, including policy and coordination, technical design \nand tendering, progress reports, and audited accounts.  \n \n22. \nThe PIU will be established in NMSA to oversee design and day-to-day implementation, \nfinancial  management,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation.  To  complement  the  PIU\u2019s  limited \ntechnical  staff  resources,  consultants  will  be  retained  for  these  services,  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Outline \nterms  of  reference  are  in  the  PAM  (footnote  12).  The  PIU  will  be  integrated  in  NMSA\u2019s \nmanagement structure with the government\u2019s professional and technical staff.  \n \n23. \nNMSA  will  procure civil  works  and goods  and  equipment  under  procurement  packages \nthrough  international  and  national  competitive  bidding  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n24. \nthe PAM (footnote 12). \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects \n\nArrangements \n\nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date  30 September 2018 \nManagement \n\nApril 2013\u2013March 2018 \n\n(i)   Oversight body \n\nMaritime and Waterways Safety Project Steering Committee \nNMSA (chair) \nADB,  Department  of  Community  Development,  Department  of  Finance, \nDepartment  of  Local  Government  and  Provincial  Affairs,  Department  of \nNational  Planning  and  Monitoring,  Department  of  Treasury,  Department  of \nTransport,  PNG  Ports  Corporation,  PNG  Women  in  Maritime  Association \n(members) \nDepartment  of  Defense,  Department  of  Agriculture  and  Livestock, \nAustralian Agency for International Development, Telikom PNG (observers)  \nNMSA \nNMSA \n\nProject  implementation  unit  in  NMSA:  NMSA,  10  staff;  international \nconsultants  about  153.5  person-months;  additional  consultants  will  be \nmobilized as required. \nInternational competitive bidding \nNational competitive bidding \nShopping \nQuality- and cost-based \nselection 80:20, full technical \nproposal \nAdvance action for recruitment of consultants for implementation assistance \nwill be applied.

Both types would be protected from corrosion and have a design life of at least \n20 years. Where a need is identified, designs will incorporate measures for adapting to climate \nchange impacts to ensure sustainable maintenance (footnote 13). \n  \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fNMSA  investigated  various  possible  sites  for  future  expansion  of  the  AIS  network  with \n27. \nthe assistance of its contractor and by means of radio simulations. Currently, five antenna sites \nare earmarked for additional base stations, while three existing antenna stations shall be moved \nto better locations in the areas. For the tide gauge network installment, NMSA has decided this \nshould  be  based  on  radar  tide  gauge  recorders  and  sensors  with  data  acquisition  systems. \nThese will be linked via a mobile or landline network to a central Tide Gauge Center at NMSA \nHeadquarters  in  Port  Moresby  for  reception  of  real-time  data  of  sea  level  variations.  While \nseven  to  eight  stations  were  considered  necessary  to  cover  the  whole  archipelago,  only  three \nfacilities  were  commissioned  in  the  previous  project.  Project  preparatory  technical  assistance \nverified NMSA\u2019s information infrastructure plan. \n \n28. \nNMSA  selected  seven  ports  based  on  traffic  volume  and  tourism  activities  to  conduct \nhydrographic  surveys.  The  survey  collects  data  in  digital  format  required  to  meet  International \nHydrographic Organization standards. The data are to be given to the Australian Hydrographic \nService  for  production  of  paper  charts  and  electronic  navigational  charts  under  a  partnership \nwith Australia.   \n  \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n29. \nThe project is viable from an economic perspective, according to the economic analysis \ncarried  out  on  the  proposed  replacement  of  99  existing  navaids  and  construction  of  33  new \nnavaids. The proposed installations were estimated to yield an economic internal rate of return \nof  14.7%.  The  sensitivity  analysis  also  found  results  to  be  robust,  exceeding  12%  under  a \nnumber of scenarios.17\n  \n \nIn  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects  guidelines,  \n30. \nan assessment was undertaken of the financial sustainability of the project.18 NMSA will need to \nimprove  its  revenue  collection  efficiency,  particularly  on  navaids,  to  cover  the  increased \nrecurrent cost for the maintenance of navaids. Since navaids levies form the majority of NMSA \nrevenues, it is imperative that NMSA improve its revenue collection efficiency under the NMSA \nAct, 2003. NMSA will also need to review its current tariff policy to determine if there is a need \nto  increase  tariff  rates  further  or  change  the  basis  of  tariffs.  In  addition,  NMSA  will  have  to \nstrengthen  its  enforcement  capability  to  increase  domestic  vessel  registration.  Although \nmaintenance costs will be covered by the ADB loan during the project, with the project\u2019s support, \nNMSA will establish a mechanism to ensure maintenance financing after the project completion \nby  improving  the  collection  of  navaids  levies  through  addressing  the  issues  of  tariff  rates, \npayment collection, and registration by the end of 2018 as described in the loan agreement.19\n\n   \n\n \nGovernance  \n\nC. \n\nFinancial management. A financial management assessment was completed for NMSA, \n31. \nincluding  a  review  of  the  accounting  and  reporting  system,  internal  and  external  auditing \npractices,  fund  disbursement,  and  information  systems.  The  risks  associated  with  NMSA  are \nassessed  to  be  medium  and  relate  to  project  management  and  revenue  collection  efficiency. \nNMSA has not been involved in the management of ADB-funded loan projects and will require \ntraining on ADB procedures to ensure that project funds are managed in accordance with ADB \npolicy.  \n\n                                                \n17 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 ADB. 2005.

A  procurement  capacity  assessment 20\n\n  was  completed  for  NMSA  and \n32. \nindicated  that  procurement  capacity  within  NMSA  remains  weak.  A  procurement  specialist  will \nassist NMSA in procuring goods, works, and consulting services.   \n \nAnticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \n33. \nto  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  NMSA.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 12). \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n\n34. \nBenefits. The project is expected to generate widespread social and economic benefits \namong  rural  coastal  communities.  Direct  benefits  from  the  navaids  improvements  include \nimproved  quality  of  life  of  the  communities  through  improved  safety  for  small  passenger  craft, \nsafer access to health and education services and markets, as well as access to training in HIV \nprevention.  Navaid  lights  will  enable  safer  fishing  at  night  and  when  out  of  sight  of  land,  thus \npotentially  increasing  catches  and  rural  incomes.  In  addition,  CLCs  will  be  established  to \nmonitor lights and provide security, for which service an annual fee will be provided by NMSA. \nThe  CLC  agreement  stipulates  that  this  must  be  used  for  small  development  projects,  which \nmitigate poverty or improve conditions for women and girls.  \n \nGender.  The  project  is  categorized  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  A  gender  action \n35. \nplan has been prepared to guide implementation of the project. The key activities under the plan \ninclude (i) women\u2019s participation in community consultations regarding the design, location, and \nmaintenance of navaids; (ii) a land investigation process incorporating the recognition of women \nmembers  of  landowning  groups  and  protection  of  their  land  inheritance  rights;  (iii)  inclusion  of \nwomen  in  the  CLCs  with  a  40%  target  and  earmarking  at  least  20%  of  CLC  payments  for \nwomen\u2019s  and  girls\u2019  activities;  (iv)  involvement  of  both  men  and  women  in  safety  awareness \ntraining;  and  (v) capacity  development  of  NMSA  and  the  PIU  on  gender  awareness  and \ninstitutional  strengthening  plans.  NMSA  agreed  to  adopt  the  plan  for  the  project\u2019s  community \nengagement and training components. \n  \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nImpacts  on  the  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples  were \n\n36. \nassessed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).  \n \nEnvironment.  Proposed  navaid  installations  and  rehabilitation  works  will  not  result  in \n37. \nany  significant  adverse  environmental  impact.  All  potential  environmental  impacts  can  be \nadequately  mitigated and managed,  and  will  be monitored.  An  environmental  assessment  and \nreview  framework  has  been  prepared  for  the  project  and  an  initial  environmental  examination, \nincorporating  an  environmental  management  and  monitoring  plan,  has  been  prepared  for  the \ntwo  sites (covering  up  to  eight  installations).21\n The  assessment  procedures  comply  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement requirements. The project is classified category B for environment. \n \nLand  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  project  is  expected  to  involve  minor  land \n38. \nacquisition but is unlikely to have displacement impacts, as most subprojects will be undertaken \nin  the  sea  and  within  the  existing  locations.  New  installations  are  mainly  sited  in  the  sea,  on \n                                                \n20  Procurement  Capacity  Assessment  and  Recommendations  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \n\n21 Initial Environmental Examination and Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list \n\nAppendix 2). \n\nof linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\frocky  headlands,  or  on  other  uninhabited  coastal  or  foreshore  sites.  If  any  subprojects  or \nactivities  involve  minor  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts,  resettlement  plans  will  be \nprepared  according  to  the  project\u2019s  resettlement  framework.22  A  resettlement  plan  for  sample \nsubprojects  has  also  been  prepared.23\n  The  project\u2019s  involuntary  resettlement  classification  is \ncategory B. \n \n39. \nIndigenous peoples. Melanesians are the indigenous people of PNG and comprise the \nvast  majority  of  its  population.  Disadvantaged  and  vulnerable  groups  exist  in  all  parts  of  the \ncountry  but  are  not  defined  by  their  ethnicity  or  tribal  affiliation;  rather,  by  their  geographic \nlocation, education, and access to services. The project covers a wide geographic spread, and \nis  not  expected  to  have  adverse  impacts  on  or  target  any  particular  group.  While  a  separate \nindigenous peoples\u2019 planning framework and plan are not needed or appropriate for the project, \nall  subprojects  will  be  implemented  in  a  culturally  appropriate  and  participatory  manner.  The \nproject  will  implement  a  stakeholder  consultation  and  participation  strategy  and  a  community \nengagement  program  to  mobilize  local  communities  in  providing  security  and  monitoring  of \ninfrastructure. Agreements with communities regarding use of local customary land or foreshore \nfor subprojects, if needed, will be included in the resettlement planning documents for relevant \nsubprojects. The project\u2019s classification is category C on indigenous peoples. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n40.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.24\n  \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nSafety and \nsecurity instability \n\nInsufficient \nimplementation \ncapacity \n\nSustainable \nmaintenance of \nthe project \nnavaids \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe  PIU  will  frequently  monitor  project  safety  and  security  at  the  national  and \ncommunity levels through  consultation  with NMSA staff in provinces. All information \nwill be shared with contractors to prepare a work plan and an emergency evacuation \nplan. Contractors will submit the plans to the PIU prior to community consultation and \nworks. The PIU and contractors will hold periodical security briefings.      \n\nNMSA will form and chair a project steering committee to oversee and monitor \nproject implementation. International consultants will be engaged to provide support \nto NMSA staff in the PIU and ensure efficient and effective project implementation \nthrough on-the-job training. NMSA staff will be trained in procurement, monitoring, \nand disbursements. \n\nInternational consultants for institutional development and financial management will \nassist NMSA in addressing issues related to tariff rates, payment collection, and \nregistration to secure budget for recurrent costs. The government, NMSA, ADB, and \ndevelopment partners will discuss and seek an opportunity to implement consultants\u2019 \nrecommendations. NMSA is committed to retain the required budget for operation \nand maintenance of the project navaids.   \n\nLandowners will be consulted during pre-site condition surveys to ensure support \nexists for navaids rehabilitation, installment, and maintenance. The PIU will confirm \nlandownership at subproject sites and facilitate an agreement with landowners for \nuse of land at navaids sites prior to the award of civil works contracts. NMSA will \nresolve any outstanding past occupancy fee for proposed navaid sites before \n\nDelayed \ncommencement \nof civil works \ncaused by lack of \nagreement with \n                                                \n22 Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fRisks \nlandowners \n\nsubproject selection.  \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nClimate change \n\nThe PIU will design navaids while considering possible climate change risks, such as \nsea level rise and an increase in the intensity of severe events.   \nADB = Asian Development Bank, NMSA = National Maritime Safety Authority, navaid = navigational aid, PIU = project \nimplementation unit. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and project preparatory technical assistance consultants.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n41. \nThe government and NMSA have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n42. \nwhich are set forth in the loan agreement.  \n \n\nThe government and NMSA have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n43. \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies equivalent to SDR26,979,000 to Papua New Guinea for the Maritime and Waterways \nSafety Project, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% \nper  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  for  a  term  of  32  years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n26 November 2012 \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nDesign Summary \n\nImpact \nSafer and enhanced \naccess to \nsocioeconomic \nopportunities by \ncommunities in PNG \nand by regional and \ninternational \nstakeholders \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nPerformance Targets and \nIndicators with Baselines \nBy 2020  \nNumber of passengers of \nmarine and waterways \ntransport increases from \n620,500  in 2012 to \n720,000  \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms \n \nBaseline  survey  and \nmonitoring  survey  at \ninception,  midterm,  and \ncompletion \nNMSA \nannual reports \n\n \n\nFreight volume of marine \nand waterways transport \nincreases from 8 million \ntons in 2012 to 12 million \ntons \n\n \n\nOutcome \nEnvironment for safe \nand economic \nshipping routes \nprovided by NMSA \n\nBy 2018 \nAnnual value of vessel \ndamage and lost cargo \ndecline from K7.5 million in \n2012 to K3.5 million  \n\n \nCommunity consultation \n\nNMSA annual reports \n\nAnnual loss of life caused \nby maritime accidents \nreduced from 25 in 2012 to \n10 \n\nOutputs \n1.
