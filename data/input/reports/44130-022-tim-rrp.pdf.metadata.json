The outputs of the \nproject  are  (i)  rehabilitation  and  expansion  of  water  supply  systems  in  Manatuto  and  Pante \nMacasar  by  the  National  Directorate  for Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  (NDWSS),  (ii)  increased \nknowledge of efficient use of water and safe hygiene practices in project areas, (iii) sustainable \noperation and maintenance (O&M) of urban water systems by the district department for water \nsupply and sanitation (DDWSS), (iv) sustainable secured water resources in Lehumo Lake, and \n(v) efficient management of the project by the Ministry of Infrastructure (MOI) and NDWSS.2  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nUnsafe  water  and  inadequate  hygiene  are  two  of  the  main  causes  of  poor  health  in \nTimor-Leste and the primary causes of diarrhea. \u2015The two most significant causes of infant and \nchild  mortality  in  Timor-Leste\u2014lower  respiratory  infection  and  diarrheal  disease\u2014are  directly \nrelated to lack of water supply and poor sanitation and hygiene.\u20163 The under-5 mortality rates in \nManatuto and Oecusse districts are higher than the national average; this is attributed in part to \nthe low percentage of their populations with access to safe drinking water.4 In Pante Macasar, \nthe district capital of Oecusse, and in Manatuto, the dilapidated state of water supply assets and \nthe  lack  of  institutional  capacity  within  DDWSS  have  resulted  in  unsafe  and  unreliable  water \nsupply  systems.5 In  Pante  Macasar,  51%  of  households  access  water  for  only  a  few  hours \nseveral  times  per  week  in  both  the  wet  and  dry  seasons.  In  Manatuto,  73%  of  households \naccess water for only a few hours several times per week during the wet season; however, in \nthe  dry  season,  59%  report  no  access  to  water  from  the  DDWSS  system.  With  37%  of  the \npopulation  of  Pante  Macasar  and  42%  of  Manatuto  never  having  accessed  water  from  the \nDDWSS  system,  the  gap  in  service  provision  is  considerable.6 The  water  provided  by  these \nsystems  is  not  safe  for  human  consumption  due  to  lack  of  continuous  service,  low  system \npressure, and poor maintenance of treatment and chlorination facilities. Residents of Manatuto \nand Pante Macasar currently boil and store water obtained from the system or shallow wells, but \ntheir storage methods lead to contamination and result in negative health impacts. \n \n4. \nPoor  hygiene  is  exacerbating  the  negative  health  impacts  caused  by  lack  of  access  to \nsafe and reliable water supply. Eighty-eight percent of households in Pante Macasar and 98% in \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance (TA): ADB. 2010. Technical \nAssistance  to  Democratic  Republic  of  Timor-Leste  for  Preparing  the  Oecusse  and  Ermera  Water  Rehabilitation \nProject.  Manila  (TA  7649-TIM,  for  $700,000,  approved  on 17  November).  Additional  assistance  was  provided  by \nthe subproject Preparing Gender-Inclusive Community Participation for Oecusse and Ermera Water Rehabilitation \nProject  under  ADB.  2003.

Manila \n(September). \n\n6  Socioeconomic survey carried out by project preparatory consultants in June 2011 under the TA for Preparing the \n\nOecusse and Ermera Water Rehabilitation Project. Available upon request. \n\n\f2 \n\nManatuto treat water; boiling is the most common method. While 94% had soap or detergent in \nthe  house,  actual  hand-washing  practice  was  not  as  high.  Only  30%  in  both  districts  reported \nwashing  their  hands  before  eating  (footnote  6).  In  Oecusse,  up  to  36%  of  the  population \npracticed open defecation; in Manatuto, a town with higher population density, this was as low \nas  11%.  Consequently,  the  incidence  of  water-related  disease  is  higher  than  the  national \naverage  in  both  district  capitals.7 In  addition  to  the  direct  health  impact  on  residents,  lack  of \naccess  to  safe  water  contributes  significantly  to  the  workload  of  women  because  of  the  time \nspent  managing  the  household  water  supply  as  well  as  caring  for  children  affected  by  water-\nrelated  diseases  (a  burden  generally  assumed  by  women). 8 By  increasing  access  to  water \nsupply and safe hygiene practices, the project will improve the health of residents in  Manatuto \nand Pante Macasar, particularly children, and will lessen the workload of women. \n \n5. \nThe government requested urgent assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nto  rehabilitate  Lehumo  Lake  to  restore  water  resources  in  Ermera  District.  The  existing  lake \nembankments  are  in  poor  condition,  do  not  retain  the  water,  and have  been  eroded. This  has \nlowered the lake\u2019s water level, devastating the small-scale fishing relied upon by the community, \nand  putting  its  wetland  ecosystem  in  danger.9 The  rehabilitation  of    Lehumo  Lake  will  restore \nwater levels, and stop erosion along the banks of the lake, which has led to a significant loss of \nland that is vital to farming activities. These water resource management measures will improve \na  key  livelihood  source  for  farming  and  fishing-reliant  communities,  which  are  among  the \npoorest in the country.  \n \n6. \nTimor-Leste\u2019s  Strategic  Development  Plan  2011\u20132030  targets  the  achievement  of  six \ngoals by 2030, including (i) elimination of child mortality as a consequence of inadequate water \nsupply,  malnutrition,  and  lack  of  health  care;  and  (ii)  eradication  of  extreme  poverty  through \n\u2015universal access to public services, ample job opportunities, and economic development in all \nregions.\u201610 These  goals  are  directly  dependent  on  access  to  water  supply  and  sanitation  and \nimproved  water  resources  management,  and  are  closely  linked  with  the  achievement  of  the \nMDGs. 11  ADB\u2019s  2011\u20132015  country  partnership  strategy  for  Timor-Leste  focuses  on  the \nprovision of infrastructure, including urban water supply and sanitation.12 ADB, together with the \nJapan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), has been investing in urban water supply since \n2002. This project will continue ADB support to the urban water supply sector by  rehabilitating \nand  upgrading  two  urban  water  supply  systems,  ensuring  their  sustainable  management,  and \nfacilitating  the  development  of  public\u2013private  partnerships  (PPPs)  for  service  provision,  in  line \nwith  the  Timor-Leste  PPP  policy  and  the  draft  law  developed  with  ADB  technical  assistance \n(TA) support.13  \n\n7. \nSince  2000,  ADB  has  provided  three  project  grants  amounting  to  $11  million  and  two \nTAs  amounting  to  $1.2 million  to  develop  the  water  and  sanitation  sector  in  Timor-Leste.

Manila (TA 7430-\n\nREG). \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3 \n\nmain  development  partners  in  the  sector  are  the  Australian  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment,  JICA,  and  the  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development. 14  Most \nsupport from these agencies is focused on rural areas. In Oecusse and Manatuto regions, the \nUnited  States  Agency  for  International  Development  with  its  District Water  and  Sanitation  and \nHygiene Program and Oxfam International have ongoing water supply and sanitation projects in \nrural communities, but the towns of  Manatuto and Pante Macasar are considered urban areas \nand cannot receive assistance under these initiatives. This is the case for all district capitals in \nTimor-Leste, which are classified as urban irrespective of their size and population density. This \nproject  will  build  on  previous  urban  water  supply  projects  undertaken  by  ADB  and  JICA  while \ncoordinating with rural water supply projects funded by other agencies as needed. \n \nLessons  from  previous  projects  and  evaluation15 in  Timor-Leste  highlight  the  need  to  \n8. \n(i)  provide  greater  technical  and  managerial  support  to  agencies  involved  in  water  supply,  \n(ii)  increase  the  O&M  capacity  of  water  operators,  (iii)  support  sector  reforms  to  reintroduce \ntariffs  and  an  efficient  management  structure  for  NDWSS,  and  (iv)  ensure  appropriate \ninstitutional  capacity  is  in  place  prior  to  increasing  private  sector  involvement  in  water  supply. \nThis  project  incorporates  these  lessons  by  providing  institutional  support  to  NDWSS  in \ninvestment  and  asset  management  planning,  and  piloting  a  phased  PPP  approach  to \nrehabilitation  and  O&M.  In  addition,  due  to  the  current  status  of  Timor-Leste  as  fragile  and \nconflict-affected,  the  project  includes  elements  of  the  2007  ADB  approach  to  engaging  with \nweakly  performing  countries,  such  as  a  strong  focus  on  extensive  community  involvement \nthrough  consultations,  strong  support  to  all  levels  of  government  agencies,  and  frequent \nmonitoring to accommodate implementation adjustments as deemed necessary.16  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n9. \nThe project will ensure that more people have access to an improved supply of drinking \nwater  in  Timor-Leste;  this  will  contribute  to  reducing  the  high  incidence  of  water-related \ndiseases, particularly for children under 5. By the end of the project,  NDWSS will provide safe \nand reliable water supply to the district capitals of Manatuto and Pante Macasar (outcome), and \nwill  lessen  the  workload  of  women.  In  addition,  the  Ermera  community  will  properly  manage \ntheir water resources. The project comprises a first step in the government\u2019s plan to provide 24-\nhour access to safe drinking water in all district capitals.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nOutput  1.  NDWSS  rehabilitates  and  expands  Manatuto  and  Pante  Macasar  water \n10. \nsupply  systems,  including  (i)  rehabilitation  and  improvement  of  the  existing  intakes  of  both \nsystems  to  maximize  gravity-fed  sources;  (ii)  in  Pante  Macasar,  development  of  a  new \ngroundwater  source  to  be  used  during  the  dry  season;  (iii)  rehabilitation  and  improvement  of \nexisting  storage  and  treatment  facilities;  (iv)  rehabilitation  of  existing  distribution  systems  and \nconstruction of new water distribution systems in four aldeias of Pante Macasar and four sucos \n\n                                                \n14 Risk  Assessment  and  Risk  Management  Plan  provides  a  list  of  other  development  partners  active  in  the  Timor-\n\nLeste water and sanitation sector (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n15 ADB.  2004.

Households  in  Manatuto  and  Pante  Macasar  have  increased  knowledge  of \nefficient  use  of  water  resources  and  safe  hygiene  practices.  The  project  will  implement  an \nintensive 6-month  campaign  for  individuals  and households, followed  by  a  6-month  reinforcing \ncampaign at multiple levels. The project will adapt the methodology developed in Manatuto and \nOecusse  under  the  rural  water  program  to  the  urban  context.  The  training  will  cover  \n(i)  hand  washing; (ii)  proper  handling  and  storage  of  drinking  water;  (iii) efficient  use  of  water, \nincluding  understanding  of  payment  for  water  and  metering;  (iv)  safe  disposal  of  wastewater; \nand (v) use of latrines by all household members, including children.  \n\n12. \nOutput  3.  DDWSS  utilizes  sustainable  O&M  of  water  systems  in  district  capitals.  The \nproject will pilot a PPP approach by packaging the rehabilitation of the systems with their O&M \nfor 2 years, preparing bid documents and model contracts that focus on performance standards, \npreparing  a  manual  for  system  O&M,  and  providing  DDWSS  personnel  with  on-the-job  and \nexternal  training  to  operate  and  maintain  the  system  and  to  monitor  contract  implementation. \nDuring this period, the government, in line with its PPP policy and with support from the project \nteam  and ADB,  will  explore  a  long-term  PPP  arrangement for the O&M  of  urban  water  supply \nsystems.  In  addition,  local  residents  will  be  sponsored  to  receive  vocational  training  on  urban \nwater supply and sanitation. \n\n13. \nOutput 4. Water resources in Lehumo Lake will be secured in a sustainable manner. To \nrestore  water  resources  in  the  lake,  the  project  preparatory  TA  piloted  labor-intensive, \ncommunity-led works to rehabilitate the lake, with more than 30% of the workers being women. \nThe project will continue this approach and will (i) stop erosion through the use of gabions and \nthe planting of trees, (ii) secure reasonable impermeability of the two embankments through  a \nborehole-grouting  technique,  (iii)  raise  the  embankments  and  secure  them  with  concrete,  and \n(iv) rehabilitate the broken spillway in the western embankment. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n14. \nOutput  5.  MOI  and  the  implementing  agencies  provide  efficient  project  management \nand  monitoring  services.  The  project  will  provide  support  to  MOI;  NDWSS;  the  National \nDirectorate  for  Roads,  Bridges,  and  Flood  Control  (NDRBFC);  and  the  communities  to \nsupervise  project  implementation  and  PPP  contract  monitoring.  The  project  will  provide \nconsulting  services  to  assist  NDWSS  in  preparing  a  preliminary  investment  plan  for  the \nrehabilitation and expansion  of  urban  water  supply  systems for the remaining  district  capitals. \nThe government and ADB can use this plan to make decisions regarding additional financing.  \n \nD. \n \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $14.32  million,  including  taxes  and  duties  of  $0.20 \n15. \nmillion.

MOI  will  be  the  executing  agency.  NDWSS  will  be  the  implementing  agency  for \ncomponents related to water supply and hygiene (outputs one, two, three, and five). NDRBFC \nwill be the implementing agency for the restoration of Lehumo Lake in Ermera District (output 4). \nA national steering committee, comprising MOI, NDWSS, NDRBFC, the district administrators of \nManatuto and Oecusse, the secretary of state for the Autonomous Region of Oecusse, and the \nDirectorate  for  Aid  Effectiveness  (MOF),  will  guide  project \nimplementation.  A  project \nimplementation  unit  (PIU)  will  be  established  to  lead  implementation  of  the  outputs  related  to \nwater supply and hygiene and the ongoing Dili Urban Water Supply Sector Project.19 The chief \nof  District  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  of  NDWSS  and  the  chief  of  Dili  Water  Supply  and \nSanitation  of  NDWSS  will  lead  the  PIU,  and  the  district  manager  of  DDWSS  of  Manatuto  and \ndistrict manager of DDWSS of Oecusse will be members. Should the government adopt a new \nPPP  law  in 2011,  a PPP  unit  will  be  formed  to assist  the  PIU  in monitoring  implementation  of \nproject contracts. The project management unit, already established for ADB road projects, will \nsupport  NDRBFC  in  tendering,  contracting,  and  monitoring  for  the  Lehumo  Lake  component. \nThe  implementation  arrangements  are  summarized  in  Table  3  and  described  in  detail  in  the \nproject administration manual (PAM).20 \n \nADB and the government may provide additional financing to expand the project to other \n18. \ndistrict  capitals.

High \nhardness  and  biological  contamination  in  the  river  sources  for  both  Manatuto  and  Pante \nMacasar mean treatment is necessary before distribution and is included in the project. In Pante \nMacasar, the total water demand for the next 20 years is 2,701 cubic meters per day, which can \nbe met through a combination of groundwater sources (production wells) in the dry season and \nsurface water sources in the rainy season. In Manatuto, the demand for water will be 26.61 liters \nper  second  by  2031  for  which  the  Laclo  River  has  sufficient  supply.  In  both  district  capitals, \ngravity-fed water supply systems are the preferred option when possible, as they are easier and \ncheaper to maintain over time than pumped systems. \n \n20. \nIn  Ermera,  community-led,  small-scale  civil  works  were  piloted  during  the  project \npreparatory  TA  to rehabilitate  the  lake  and  stop  the  erosion gully  from  increasing  in  size.  The \ncommunity  demonstrated  sufficient technical  and management  skills to undertake  some  of the \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7 \n\nremaining  works,  including  installing  gabions  and  planting  trees.  The  contractors  will  conduct \nother major works such as grouting and building a concrete wall. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nEconomic analysis indicates demand for the project as the need for water by Manatuto \n21. \nand Pante Macasar residents in 2031 cannot be met by the current water supply systems. The \nestimated  mean  willingness  to  pay  for  usage  is  $2.29  per  month  in  Manatuto  and  $1.71  per \nmonth  in  Oecusse.  Usage  tariffs  are  affordable  when  they  do  not  exceed  5%  of  monthly \nhousehold incomes with 13\u201314 cubic meters per month consumed. The monthly water cost to \nhouseholds,  including  for  low-income  families,  remains  below  the  affordability  limit  of  5%  of \nhousehold  income  at  current  tariffs.  Benefits  will  arise  from  the  project  through  economic  and \nhealth  benefits:  cost  of  illness  (24%  of  total  annual  benefits),  savings  in  income  loss  (58%  of \ntotal  annual  benefits),  time  savings  (15%  of  total  annual  benefits),  and  treatment  cost  savings \n(3%  of total  annual  benefits).  Further  benefits that  could not  be readily  quantified  include land \nvalue  appreciation  in  the  area  and  environmental  improvement.  The  project  has  an  economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) of 17%, which is higher than the assumed 12% discount rate. This \nis  notwithstanding  the  fact  that  other  benefits  relating  to  the  environment  could  not  be \nrealistically  quantified  and,  therefore,  have  not  been  accounted  for  in  the  EIRRs.  The  EIRR \nremains above 12% for the following sensitivity tests: increase in capital cost by 10%, increase \nin operating cost by 10%, decrease in benefits by 10%, and a 2-year delay in implementation. \n \n22. \nFinancial  analysis  of  project  components  was  undertaken  to  determine  the  capacity  of \nthe  NDWSS  to  cover  project  costs.21 The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  was  calculated  for \nrevenue-generating components, namely the two water supply components and is 1.9% for the \nManatuto water  supply  component  and  1.8% for Pante Macasar. These figures are above the \nweighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  0.59%.  The  two  components  are  sensitive  to  revenue \ndecreases  and  cost  increases.  Efforts  must  be  made  during  project  implementation  to  avoid \nsuch  cost  increases  and  the government  must  ensure tariff reintroduction  to  all  customers. To \nhelp  the  district  capitals  achieve  these  targets,  the  project\u2019s  civil  works  contractor  will  provide \nO&M for 2 years and develop appropriate maintenance plans to ensure sustainability. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n23. \nA financial management assessment concludes that the financial management capacity \nof  the  implementing  agencies  is  not  adequate  for  project  implementation.  Training  will  be \nprovided  in  ADB  procedures  for  procurement,  disbursement,  project  management,  and \naccounting systems. Assistance from the PIU consultants will be provided to the  implementing \nagencies for (i) budget preparation and oversight; (ii) preparation of an annual training program \non financial  management  and skills  upgrading;  (iii)  strengthening  of the  internal  audit function; \n(iv)  establishment  of  data  safeguard  systems;  (v)  development  of  a  financial  policy  and \nprocedures  manual  to  cover  financial  management,  reporting,  and  related  administrative \nactivities; and (vi) provision of training in disbursement and project and financial management. \n \nThe  good  governance  and  anticorruption  provisions  include  (i)  enhancing  construction \n24. \nquality  control  and  the  supervision  of  effective  work;  (ii)  introducing  a  dual-signing  system;  \n(iii) periodically inspecting contractor activities related to fund withdrawals and settlements; and \n(iv)  in  consultation  with  relevant  government  ministries,  updating  the  rules  and  regulations  on \n\n                                                \n21 The rehabilitation of Lehumo Lake in Ermera District will be fully financed by ADB and maintained thereafter by the \n\ncommunities. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nlocal  and  corporate  governance  and  anticorruption,  and  enhancing  transparency  of  the \nimplementing agency operations. \n \n25. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith MOI, NDWSS, and NDRBFC. MOI, NDWSS, and NDRBFC have previous experience with \nADB  procurement;  they  will  be  supported  by  the  PIU  and  MOI  procurement  advisers.  Specific \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 20). \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n26. \nThe  rehabilitated  water  supply  systems  will  have  the  capacity  to  provide  clean  and \npotable  water  to  about  30,500  people,  including  about  5,200  household  connections.  Safe, \nreliable,  and  affordable water  is  a  basic  need; fulfilling  this  need  will  directly  reduce  poverty  in \nthe two district capitals. Increasing access to safe water reduces poverty by (i) improving public \nhealth and reducing malnutrition, resulting in reduced expenditure on health and reduced work \ndays  lost  from  morbidity;  and  (ii)  increasing  time  savings  from  water  collection,  storage,  and \nboiling,  particularly  for  women  and  girls.  The  project  will  provide  (i)  access  to  metered \nhousehold  water  connections,  (ii)  24-hour  per  day  water  service,  and  (iii)  awareness  of  safe \nhygiene  practices  to  households  in  two  district  capitals  of  Manatuto  and  Pante  Macasar.  In \nErmera,  the  project  will  reduce  erosion  in  Lehumo  Lake,  restoring  the  lake  to  its  previous \ncondition. This will reinstate small-scale fishing relied upon by the surrounding communities and \nwill  open  up  the  potential  for  ecotourism  to  develop\u2014two  livelihood  opportunities  for  reducing \npoverty in Ermera. \n \nParticipation is a key element of the project\u2019s approach to poverty reduction. The project \n27. \nwill provide opportunities to form new and empower existing community-based organizations. A \ncoordinating  committee  will  be  established  in  each  district  capital  to  bring  together  suco  and \naldeia chiefs, civil society representatives, water and sanitation office officials, and project team \nto  guide  the  project,  and  to  ensure  residents\u2019  viewpoints  are  considered  during  project \nimplementation  and  that  they  are  involved  in  project  monitoring.  At  least  30%  of  members  of \neach coordinating committee will be women. Project investments will be available to all district \ncapital households as the existing tariff scheme allows poor households to pay their connection \nfee over 1 year. In Ermera, a coordinating committee will also be established to guide activities \nsurrounding the lake and a local  nongovernment organization will be engaged to mobilize and \ntrain community labor to undertake small-scale civil works. \n \nThe project is categorized as gender equity theme. In Manatuto and Pante Macasar, the \n28. \nproject will maximize benefits for women22 by (i) involving them in decision making through the \ncoordinating  committees,  (ii)  encouraging  contractors \nlabor-intensive \nconstruction  jobs,  and  (iii)  targeting  women  in  project  hygiene  awareness  campaigns  and \nvocational training. Women do the vast majority of water collection, storage, and treatment\u2014the \nneed for which will be reduced once households are connected to a safe, 24-hour per day water \nsupply. In addition, women are the main caregivers of children, who are most affected by water-\nrelated diseases. The physical and emotional burden of caring for sick children will be eased in \nproject  areas.  In  Ermera,  the  project  will  (i)  involve  women  in  decision  making  through \ncoordinating  committees,  and  (ii)  provide  cash  employment  to  women  through  community-led \ncivil  works  during  project  implementation.  The  project  includes  measures  to  include  gender \nquotas  in  labor-intensive  contracts,  ensure  equal  pay  for  men  and  women,  and  avoid \nconstruction camps. A gender action plan was prepared and will be implemented for the project. \n \n\nto  hire \n\nthem \n\nfor \n\n                                                \n22 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f \n\nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n \n\n9 \n\nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The \n\n29. \nEnvironment.  The  project  is  categorized  as  environment  category  B,  and  an  initial \nenvironmental  examination  with  a  detailed  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  was \nprepared \ninitial \nenvironmental  examination  concludes  that  no  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  are \nanticipated.23 The  project\u2019s  significant  environmental  benefits  will  include  reduced  erosion  in \nErmera,  and  better  water  supply  and  water  treatment  facilities;  reduced  water  losses  from  the \ncurrently inefficient water distribution systems; and improved hygiene and sanitary conditions in \nManatuto and Pante Macasar. \n \n30. \nIn  Manatuto  and  Pante  Macasar,  the  project  will  introduce  minor  short-term  negative \nenvironmental  disturbances  associated  with  construction,  which  will  be  mitigated  by  the \noperating  procedures  and  monitoring  plans  detailed  in  the  EMP.  NDWSS  will  implement  and \nmonitor  the  EMP  with  the  assistance  of  the  PIU,  which  will  be  responsible  for  preconstruction \nand operation phase elements, and by the civil works contractors, which will be responsible for \nconstruction phase elements of the EMP. \n \n31. \nThe project will have positive environmental impacts on the Lehumo Lake area and will \nenhance the lake\u2019s status among the \u2015wetlands of national significance\u2016 for the conservation of \nendangered  and  near-endangered  birds  in  Timor-Leste.24 Basic  environmental  procedures  will \nbe  incorporated  in  the  contracts  of  individual  contractors  to  manage  minor  environmental \ndisturbances  during  construction.  The  supervising  engineer  will  undertake  day-to-day \nimplementation  and  compliance  with  ADB  and  government  environmental  and  safeguards \nregulations and policy for the Lehumo Lake output. \n \n32. \nSocial.  The  project  is  categorized  as  indigenous  peoples  category  C  and  involuntary \nresettlement category C, so a resettlement plan was not prepared. In Pante Macasar, based on \ninitial  surveys  and  public  consultations,  no  private  land  acquisition  will  be  necessary  for  the \ndevelopment  works.  The  proposed  new  location  for  the  Santa  Rosa  storage  and  treatment \nfacilities,  which  is  just  100  meters  off  the  existing  site,  is  government-owned  land  and  will  be \nprovided to the project at no cost. Private land acquisition is also not required for the Lehumo \nLake  and  Manatuto  components.  Cultural  traditions  for  the  use  of  water  sources  will  be \nrespected and are included in the consultation and participation plan. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n33.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.25 The integrated benefits and impacts of the \nproject are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\n                                                \n23 Construction-related impacts relate to dust generation and risk of erosion from excavation activities; and increased \nvibrations,  noise,  fumes,  and  traffic  disruption  during  construction  activities.  Good  engineering  design  and \nmanagement  plans  will  minimize  these  impacts  as  well  as  any  impacts  associated  with  operations.  All  effluent \ndischarge will comply with national standards. Worker safety provisions will be included in contractors\u2019 contracts. \n\n24 Bird Life International. 2007.
