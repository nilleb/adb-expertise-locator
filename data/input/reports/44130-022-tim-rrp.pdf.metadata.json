I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste for the District Capitals Water Supply Project.1 \n \n2.  The project will support the Government of Timor-Leste\u2019s efforts to meet the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), particularly improved health of children under 5. The outputs of the \nproject are (i) rehabilitation and expansion of water supply systems in Manatuto and Pante \nMacasar by the National Directorate for Water Supply and Sanitation (NDWSS), (ii) increased \nknowledge of efficient use of water and safe hygiene practices in project areas, (iii) sustainable \noperation and maintenance (O&M) of urban water systems by the district department for water \nsupply and sanitation (DDWSS), (iv) sustainable secured water resources in Lehumo Lake, and \n(v) efficient management of the project by the Ministry of Infrastructure (MOI) and NDWSS.2  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Unsafe water and inadequate hygiene are two of the main causes of poor health in \nTimor-Leste and the primary causes of diarrhea. \u2015The two most significant causes of infant and \nchild mortality in Timor-Leste\u2014lower respiratory infection and diarrheal disease\u2014are directly \nrelated to lack of water supply and poor sanitation and hygiene.\u20163 The under-5 mortality rates in \nManatuto and Oecusse districts are higher than the national average; this is attributed in part to \nthe low percentage of their populations with access to safe drinking water.4 In Pante Macasar, \nthe district capital of Oecusse, and in Manatuto, the dilapidated state of water supply assets and \nthe lack of institutional capacity within DDWSS have resulted in unsafe and unreliable water \nsupply systems.5 In Pante Macasar, 51% of households access water for only a few hours \nseveral times per week in both the wet and dry seasons. In Manatuto, 73% of households \naccess water for only a few hours several times per week during the wet season; however, in \nthe dry season, 59% report no access to water from the DDWSS system. With 37% of the \npopulation of Pante Macasar and 42% of Manatuto never having accessed water from the \nDDWSS system, the gap in service provision is considerable.6 The water provided by these \nsystems is not safe for human consumption due to lack of continuous service, low system \npressure, and poor maintenance of treatment and chlorination facilities. Residents of Manatuto \nand Pante Macasar currently boil and store water obtained from the system or shallow wells, but \ntheir storage methods lead to contamination and result in negative health impacts. \n \n4.  Poor hygiene is exacerbating the negative health impacts caused by lack of access to \nsafe and reliable water supply. Eighty-eight percent of households in Pante Macasar and 98% in \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance (TA): ADB. 2010. Technical \nAssistance to Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste for Preparing the Oecusse and Ermera Water Rehabilitation \nProject. Manila (TA 7649-TIM, for $700,000, approved on 17 November). Additional assistance was provided by \nthe subproject Preparing Gender-Inclusive Community Participation for Oecusse and Ermera Water Rehabilitation \nProject  under  ADB.  2003.

Available upon request. ", "2 \nManatuto treat water; boiling is the most common method. While 94% had soap or detergent in \nthe house, actual hand-washing practice was not as high. Only 30% in both districts reported \nwashing  their  hands  before  eating  (footnote  6). In Oecusse,  up  to  36%  of the  population \npracticed open defecation; in Manatuto, a town with higher population density, this was as low \nas  11%.  Consequently,  the  incidence  of  water-related  disease  is  higher  than  the  national \naverage in both district capitals.7 In addition to the direct health impact on residents, lack of \naccess to safe water contributes significantly to the workload of women because of the time \nspent managing the household water supply as well as caring for children affected by water-\nrelated diseases (a burden generally assumed by women).8 By increasing access to water \nsupply and safe hygiene practices, the project will improve the health of residents in Manatuto \nand Pante Macasar, particularly children, and will lessen the workload of women. \n \n5.  The government requested urgent assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nto rehabilitate Lehumo Lake to restore water resources in Ermera District. The existing lake \nembankments are in poor condition, do not retain the water, and have been eroded. This has \nlowered the lake\u2019s water level, devastating the small-scale fishing relied upon by the community, \nand putting its wetland ecosystem in danger.9 The rehabilitation of  Lehumo Lake will restore \nwater levels, and stop erosion along the banks of the lake, which has led to a significant loss of \nland that is vital to farming activities. These water resource management measures will improve \na  key  livelihood  source  for  farming  and  fishing-reliant  communities,  which  are  among  the \npoorest in the country.  \n \n6.  Timor-Leste\u2019s Strategic Development Plan 2011\u20132030 targets the achievement of six \ngoals by 2030, including (i) elimination of child mortality as a consequence of inadequate water \nsupply, malnutrition, and lack of health care; and (ii) eradication of extreme poverty through \n\u2015universal access to public services, ample job opportunities, and economic development in all \nregions.\u201610 These goals are directly dependent on access to water supply and sanitation and \nimproved water resources management, and are closely linked with the achievement of the \nMDGs.11 ADB\u2019s  2011\u20132015  country  partnership  strategy  for  Timor-Leste  focuses  on  the \nprovision of infrastructure, including urban water supply and sanitation.12 ADB, together with the \nJapan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), has been investing in urban water supply since \n2002. This project will continue ADB support to the urban water supply sector by rehabilitating \nand upgrading two urban water supply systems, ensuring their sustainable management, and \nfacilitating the development of public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) for service provision, in line \nwith the Timor-Leste PPP policy and the draft law developed with ADB technical assistance \n(TA) support.13  \n7.  Since 2000, ADB has provided three project grants amounting to $11 million and two \nTAs amounting to $1.2 million to develop the water and sanitation sector in Timor-Leste.

", "    3 \nmain  development  partners  in  the  sector  are  the  Australian  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment,  JICA,  and  the  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development.14 Most \nsupport from these agencies is focused on rural areas. In Oecusse and Manatuto regions, the \nUnited States Agency for International Development with its District Water and Sanitation and \nHygiene Program and Oxfam International have ongoing water supply and sanitation projects in \nrural communities, but the towns of Manatuto and Pante Macasar are considered urban areas \nand cannot receive assistance under these initiatives. This is the case for all district capitals in \nTimor-Leste, which are classified as urban irrespective of their size and population density. This \nproject will build on previous urban water supply projects undertaken by ADB and JICA while \ncoordinating with rural water supply projects funded by other agencies as needed. \n \n8.  Lessons from previous projects and evaluation15 in Timor-Leste highlight the need to  \n(i) provide greater technical and managerial  support to agencies involved in water supply,  \n(ii) increase the O&M capacity of water operators, (iii) support sector reforms to reintroduce \ntariffs  and  an  efficient  management  structure  for  NDWSS,  and  (iv)  ensure  appropriate \ninstitutional capacity is in place prior to increasing private sector involvement in water supply. \nThis  project  incorporates  these  lessons  by  providing  institutional  support  to  NDWSS  in \ninvestment  and  asset  management  planning,  and  piloting  a  phased  PPP  approach  to \nrehabilitation and O&M. In addition, due to the current status of Timor-Leste as fragile and \nconflict-affected, the project includes elements of the 2007 ADB approach to engaging with \nweakly performing countries, such as a strong focus on extensive community involvement \nthrough  consultations,  strong  support  to  all  levels  of  government  agencies,  and  frequent \nmonitoring to accommodate implementation adjustments as deemed necessary.16  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The project will ensure that more people have access to an improved supply of drinking \nwater  in  Timor-Leste;  this  will  contribute  to  reducing  the  high  incidence  of  water-related \ndiseases, particularly for children under 5. By the end of the project, NDWSS will provide safe \nand reliable water supply to the district capitals of Manatuto and Pante Macasar (outcome), and \nwill lessen the workload of women. In addition, the Ermera community will properly manage \ntheir water resources. The project comprises a first step in the government\u2019s plan to provide 24-\nhour access to safe drinking water in all district capitals.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n10.  Output  1.  NDWSS  rehabilitates  and  expands  Manatuto  and  Pante  Macasar  water \nsupply systems, including (i) rehabilitation and improvement of the existing intakes of both \nsystems  to  maximize  gravity-fed  sources;  (ii)  in  Pante  Macasar,  development  of  a  new \ngroundwater source to be used during the dry season; (iii) rehabilitation and improvement of \nexisting storage and treatment facilities; (iv) rehabilitation of existing distribution systems and \nconstruction of new water distribution systems in four aldeias of Pante Macasar and four sucos \n                                                \n14 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan provides a list of other development partners active in the Timor-\nLeste water and sanitation sector (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 ADB. 2004.

Households in Manatuto and Pante Macasar have increased knowledge of \nefficient use of water resources and safe hygiene practices. The project will implement an \nintensive 6-month campaign for individuals and households, followed by a 6-month reinforcing \ncampaign at multiple levels. The project will adapt the methodology developed in Manatuto and \nOecusse  under  the  rural  water  program  to  the  urban  context.  The  training  will  cover  \n(i) hand washing; (ii) proper handling and storage of drinking water; (iii) efficient use of water, \nincluding understanding of payment for water and metering; (iv) safe disposal of wastewater; \nand (v) use of latrines by all household members, including children.  \n12.  Output 3. DDWSS utilizes sustainable O&M of water systems in district capitals. The \nproject will pilot a PPP approach by packaging the rehabilitation of the systems with their O&M \nfor 2 years, preparing bid documents and model contracts that focus on performance standards, \npreparing a manual for system O&M, and providing DDWSS personnel with on-the-job and \nexternal training to operate and maintain the system and to monitor contract implementation. \nDuring this period, the government, in line with its PPP policy and with support from the project \nteam and ADB, will explore a long-term PPP arrangement for the O&M of urban water supply \nsystems. In addition, local residents will be sponsored to receive vocational training on urban \nwater supply and sanitation. \n13.  Output 4. Water resources in Lehumo Lake will be secured in a sustainable manner. To \nrestore  water  resources  in  the  lake,  the  project  preparatory  TA  piloted  labor-intensive, \ncommunity-led works to rehabilitate the lake, with more than 30% of the workers being women. \nThe project will continue this approach and will (i) stop erosion through the use of gabions and \nthe planting of trees, (ii) secure reasonable impermeability of the two embankments through a \nborehole-grouting technique, (iii) raise the embankments and secure them with concrete, and \n(iv) rehabilitate the broken spillway in the western embankment. \n14.  Output 5. MOI and the implementing agencies provide efficient project management \nand  monitoring  services.  The  project  will  provide  support  to  MOI;  NDWSS;  the  National \nDirectorate  for  Roads,  Bridges,  and  Flood  Control  (NDRBFC);  and  the  communities  to \nsupervise  project  implementation  and  PPP  contract  monitoring.  The  project  will  provide \nconsulting  services  to  assist  NDWSS  in  preparing  a  preliminary  investment  plan  for  the \nrehabilitation and expansion of urban water supply systems for the remaining district capitals. \nThe government and ADB can use this plan to make decisions regarding additional financing.  \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n15.  The project is estimated to cost $14.32 million, including taxes and duties of $0.20 \nmillion. The total cost includes physical and price contingencies. The project investment plan is \nin Table 1. \n \n16.  The government has requested a grant not exceeding $11 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources to finance 77% of the project cost. The grant will cover civil works, materials, \nequipment, vehicles, project management, and capacity building.18 The government will finance \ntaxes and duties and partly finance civil works and materials.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n19.  The rehabilitated water supply systems in Manatuto and Pante Macasar are expected to \nprovide efficient and reliable water service to their beneficiaries over a 20-year period. High \nhardness  and  biological  contamination  in  the  river  sources  for  both  Manatuto  and  Pante \nMacasar mean treatment is necessary before distribution and is included in the project. In Pante \nMacasar, the total water demand for the next 20 years is 2,701 cubic meters per day, which can \nbe met through a combination of groundwater sources (production wells) in the dry season and \nsurface water sources in the rainy season. In Manatuto, the demand for water will be 26.61 liters \nper second by 2031 for which the Laclo River has sufficient supply. In both district capitals, \ngravity-fed water supply systems are the preferred option when possible, as they are easier and \ncheaper to maintain over time than pumped systems. \n \n20.  In  Ermera,  community-led,  small-scale  civil  works  were  piloted  during  the  project \npreparatory TA to rehabilitate the lake and stop the erosion gully from increasing in size. The \ncommunity demonstrated sufficient technical and management skills to undertake some of the ", "    7 \nremaining works, including installing gabions and planting trees. The contractors will conduct \nother major works such as grouting and building a concrete wall. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n21.  Economic analysis indicates demand for the project as the need for water by Manatuto \nand Pante Macasar residents in 2031 cannot be met by the current water supply systems. The \nestimated mean willingness to pay for usage is $2.29 per month in Manatuto and $1.71 per \nmonth  in Oecusse.  Usage tariffs  are  affordable  when  they  do  not  exceed  5%  of monthly \nhousehold incomes with 13\u201314 cubic meters per month consumed. The monthly water cost to \nhouseholds, including for low-income families, remains below the affordability limit of 5% of \nhousehold income at current tariffs. Benefits will arise from the project through economic and \nhealth benefits: cost of illness (24% of total annual benefits), savings in income loss (58% of \ntotal annual benefits), time savings (15% of total annual benefits), and treatment cost savings \n(3% of total annual benefits). Further benefits that could not be readily quantified include land \nvalue appreciation in the area and environmental improvement. The project has an economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) of 17%, which is higher than the assumed 12% discount rate. This \nis  notwithstanding  the  fact  that  other  benefits  relating  to  the  environment  could  not  be \nrealistically quantified and, therefore, have not been accounted for in the EIRRs. The EIRR \nremains above 12% for the following sensitivity tests: increase in capital cost by 10%, increase \nin operating cost by 10%, decrease in benefits by 10%, and a 2-year delay in implementation. \n \n22.  Financial analysis of project components was undertaken to determine the capacity of \nthe NDWSS to cover project costs.21 The financial internal rate of return was calculated for \nrevenue-generating components, namely the two water supply components and is 1.9% for the \nManatuto water supply component and 1.8% for Pante Macasar. These figures are above the \nweighted average cost of capital of 0.59%. The two components are sensitive to revenue \ndecreases and cost increases. Efforts must be made during project implementation to avoid \nsuch cost increases and the government must ensure tariff reintroduction to all customers. To \nhelp the district capitals achieve these targets, the project\u2019s civil works contractor will provide \nO&M for 2 years and develop appropriate maintenance plans to ensure sustainability. \n \nC.  Governance \n23.  A financial management assessment concludes that the financial management capacity \nof  the  implementing  agencies  is  not  adequate  for  project  implementation.  Training  will  be \nprovided  in  ADB  procedures  for  procurement,  disbursement,  project  management,  and \naccounting systems. Assistance from the PIU consultants will be provided to the implementing \nagencies for (i) budget preparation and oversight; (ii) preparation of an annual training program \non financial management and skills upgrading; (iii) strengthening of the internal audit function; \n(iv)  establishment  of  data  safeguard  systems;  (v)  development  of  a  financial  policy  and \nprocedures  manual  to  cover  financial  management,  reporting,  and  related  administrative \nactivities; and (vi) provision of training in disbursement and project and financial management. \n \n24.  The good governance and anticorruption provisions include (i) enhancing construction \nquality control and the supervision of effective work; (ii) introducing a dual-signing system;  \n(iii) periodically inspecting contractor activities related to fund withdrawals and settlements; and \n(iv) in consultation with relevant government ministries, updating the rules and regulations on \n                                                \n21 The rehabilitation of Lehumo Lake in Ermera District will be fully financed by ADB and maintained thereafter by the \ncommunities. \n ", "8 \nlocal  and  corporate  governance  and  anticorruption,  and  enhancing  transparency  of  the \nimplementing agency operations. \n \n25.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith MOI, NDWSS, and NDRBFC. MOI, NDWSS, and NDRBFC have previous experience with \nADB procurement; they will be supported by the PIU and MOI procurement advisers. Specific \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 20). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n26.  The rehabilitated water supply systems will have the capacity to provide clean and \npotable water to about 30,500 people, including about 5,200 household connections. Safe, \nreliable, and affordable water is a basic need; fulfilling this need will directly reduce poverty in \nthe two district capitals. Increasing access to safe water reduces poverty by (i) improving public \nhealth and reducing malnutrition, resulting in reduced expenditure on health and reduced work \ndays lost from morbidity; and (ii) increasing time savings from water collection, storage, and \nboiling,  particularly  for  women  and  girls.  The  project  will  provide  (i)  access  to  metered \nhousehold water connections, (ii) 24-hour per day water service, and (iii) awareness of safe \nhygiene practices to households in two district capitals of Manatuto and Pante Macasar. In \nErmera, the project will reduce erosion in Lehumo Lake, restoring the lake to its previous \ncondition. This will reinstate small-scale fishing relied upon by the surrounding communities and \nwill open up the potential for ecotourism to develop\u2014two livelihood opportunities for reducing \npoverty in Ermera. \n \n27.  Participation is a key element of the project\u2019s approach to poverty reduction. The project \nwill provide opportunities to form new and empower existing community-based organizations. A \ncoordinating committee will be established in each district capital to bring together suco and \naldeia chiefs, civil society representatives, water and sanitation office officials, and project team \nto  guide  the  project,  and  to  ensure  residents\u2019  viewpoints  are  considered  during  project \nimplementation and that they are involved in project monitoring. At least 30% of members of \neach coordinating committee will be women. Project investments will be available to all district \ncapital households as the existing tariff scheme allows poor households to pay their connection \nfee over 1 year. In Ermera, a coordinating committee will also be established to guide activities \nsurrounding the lake and a local nongovernment organization will be engaged to mobilize and \ntrain community labor to undertake small-scale civil works. \n \n28.  The project is categorized as gender equity theme. In Manatuto and Pante Macasar, the \nproject will maximize benefits for women22 by (i) involving them in decision making through the \ncoordinating  committees,  (ii)  encouraging  contractors  to  hire  them  for  labor-intensive \nconstruction  jobs,  and  (iii)  targeting  women  in  project  hygiene  awareness  campaigns  and \nvocational training. Women do the vast majority of water collection, storage, and treatment\u2014the \nneed for which will be reduced once households are connected to a safe, 24-hour per day water \nsupply. In addition, women are the main caregivers of children, who are most affected by water-\nrelated diseases. The physical and emotional burden of caring for sick children will be eased in \nproject  areas.  In  Ermera,  the  project  will  (i)  involve  women  in  decision  making  through \ncoordinating committees, and (ii) provide cash employment to women through community-led \ncivil works during project implementation. The project includes measures to include gender \nquotas  in  labor-intensive  contracts,  ensure  equal  pay  for  men  and  women,  and  avoid \nconstruction camps. A gender action plan was prepared and will be implemented for the project. \n \n                                                \n22 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "    9 \nE.  Safeguards \n29.  Environment. The project is categorized as environment category B, and an initial \nenvironmental  examination  with  a  detailed  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  was \nprepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  initial \nenvironmental examination concludes that no significant adverse environmental impacts are \nanticipated.23 The project\u2019s significant environmental benefits will include reduced erosion in \nErmera, and better water supply and water treatment facilities; reduced water losses from the \ncurrently inefficient water distribution systems; and improved hygiene and sanitary conditions in \nManatuto and Pante Macasar. \n \n30.  In Manatuto and Pante Macasar, the project will introduce minor short-term negative \nenvironmental  disturbances  associated  with  construction,  which  will  be  mitigated  by  the \noperating procedures and monitoring plans detailed in the EMP. NDWSS will implement and \nmonitor the EMP with the assistance of the PIU, which will be responsible for preconstruction \nand operation phase elements, and by the civil works contractors, which will be responsible for \nconstruction phase elements of the EMP. \n \n31.  The project will have positive environmental impacts on the Lehumo Lake area and will \nenhance the lake\u2019s status among the \u2015wetlands of national significance\u2016 for the conservation of \nendangered and near-endangered birds in Timor-Leste.24 Basic environmental procedures will \nbe  incorporated  in  the  contracts  of  individual  contractors  to  manage  minor  environmental \ndisturbances  during  construction.  The  supervising  engineer  will  undertake  day-to-day \nimplementation  and  compliance  with  ADB  and  government  environmental  and  safeguards \nregulations and policy for the Lehumo Lake output. \n \n32.  Social. The project is categorized as indigenous peoples category C and involuntary \nresettlement category C, so a resettlement plan was not prepared. In Pante Macasar, based on \ninitial surveys and public consultations, no private land acquisition will be necessary for the \ndevelopment works. The proposed new location for the Santa Rosa storage and treatment \nfacilities, which is just 100 meters off the existing site, is government-owned land and will be \nprovided to the project at no cost. Private land acquisition is also not required for the Lehumo \nLake  and  Manatuto  components.  Cultural  traditions  for  the  use  of  water  sources  will  be \nrespected and are included in the consultation and participation plan. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n33.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.25 The integrated benefits and impacts of the \nproject are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n                                                \n23 Construction-related impacts relate to dust generation and risk of erosion from excavation activities; and increased \nvibrations,  noise,  fumes,  and  traffic  disruption  during  construction  activities.  Good  engineering  design  and \nmanagement plans will minimize these impacts as well as any impacts associated with operations. All effluent \ndischarge will comply with national standards. Worker safety provisions will be included in contractors\u2019 contracts. \n24 Bird Life International. 2007. Important Bird Areas in Timor-Leste: Key Sites for Conservation.
