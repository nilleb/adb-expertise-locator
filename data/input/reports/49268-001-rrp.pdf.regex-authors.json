THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nof up to $200,000,000 to IndusInd Bank Limited for the Supporting Access to Finance for \nWomen in Less-Developed States Project in India.  \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY  \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n2.  Finance  sector  overview. The Indian finance sector is still developing, with banks \ndominating  the  sector.  At  the  end  of  FY2016,  the  sector  comprised  216  banks,  including \n149 scheduled commercial banks. The total deposits of all banks stood at Rs99.3 trillion and \ntotal  loans  outstanding  amounted  to  Rs77.2  trillion.1 In  addition,  11,682 nonbank  financial \ncompanies were registered with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), with estimated total loans \noutstanding of Rs13.0 trillion.2 Notwithstanding the size of the finance sector and the significant \nstrides the government is making in this sector, including the successful Pradhan Mantri Jan \nDhan Yojana scheme (Prime Minister\u2019s People Money Scheme),3 access to finance in India \nremains a key issue. Gross nonperforming assets (NPAs) for the banking subsector (according \nto  the  RBI\u2019s  definition)  worsened  from  4.6%  in  FY2015  to  7.6%  in  FY2016.  The  capital \nadequacy ratio (CAR) of the banking subsector has decreased slightly in recent years, from \n14.0% in FY2013 to 13.2% in FY2016. \n \n3.  Microfinance industry. At the end of FY2016, the Indian microfinance industry had \nprovided microcredit to 33.2 million customers through 9,736 branches, disbursing 34.7 million \nloans  amounting  to  Rs670  billion,  with  an  average  loan  size  of  $265.4 The  number  of \ndisbursements grew 78.2% in FY2016, while aggregate gross loan portfolio grew by 91.0% \nduring the same period. Since FY2013, the industry has seen a compound annual growth rate \nof  88.6%  in  disbursements  and  a  93.7%  compound  annual growth  rate  in the gross  loan \nportfolio.5 CRISIL Research, a ratings agency, expects the aggregate microfinance institution \n(MFI) loan portfolio to grow by 30%\u201334% annually until the end of FY2021. Problem loans \namong MFIs have seen a steadily decreasing trend, falling from 0.5% in FY2013 to 0.3% in \nFY2016 for 30 days past due.  \n \n4.  The  Government  of  India  continues  to  support  the  microfinance  industry  and  has \nencouraged banks to provide further support for micro and small enterprise (MSE) financing. \nThe RBI\u2019s 2013 circular defines MSEs as manufacturing or service businesses subject to certain \nsizes of investment or machinery amounts.6 MSEs are eligible for priority sector lending (PSL)\u2014\nan RBI requirement to support financial inclusion that obliges commercial banks to lend at least \n40% of their adjusted net bank credit of the previous year to specified priority sectors, with a \nfocus on underserved and rural borrowers.7 Given the operational difficulties of reaching this \n                                                \n1  Reserve Bank of India, 2016.

Frequently Asked Questions: Priority Sector Lending Targets and Classification.  \n  http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FAQView.aspx?Id=87 \n ", "2   \n \nmarket, many commercial banks\u2019 wholesale lend to MFIs or create originating relationships with \nMFI business correspondents, whereby banks work effectively with these institutions to increase \nfinancing in the underserved MSE segment and meet PSL targets. \n    \n5.  Business correspondents model to drive financial inclusion. Policy makers in India \nknow the ramifications of leaving a large section of the population out of the development \nprocess. Therefore, they are designing policies for financial inclusion that will increase the \navailability of financial services to the poor and marginalized segments of society, and have \nbeen encouraging banks to prepare a road map to cover all unbanked villages with populations \nof less than 2,000. To achieve sustainable rural operations, banks are considering alternate low-\ncost channels for delivery of banking services. The RBI has encouraged them to improve the \noutreach  of  banking  services  through  the  business  facilitator  and  business  correspondent \nmodels. The recommendations of the Nachiket Mor Committee also include accelerating the \nflow of credit to the poor and enlarging business correspondents\u2019 catchment areas, including the \nuse of new entities as business correspondents.8  \n \n6.  The RBI has collated best practices with respect to business correspondent lending and \nissued guidelines to commercial banks on the use of the business correspondent lending model, \nincluding cash management practices.9 A business correspondent can help banks mobilize \ndeposits and drive credit penetration in rural and semi-urban areas. A business correspondent \ncan be an individual (such as a grocery store owner), MFI, or agent of a corporate business \ncorrespondent.10 The transaction cost for a business correspondent is estimated to be 1/15th \nthe transaction cost in a rural branch.11 The lower costs are primarily enabled by technology, \nwhich allows real-time transactions. To increase the profitability of rural operations, banks are \nexpected to expand their reliance on this model. CRISIL Research estimates that 8%\u201312% of \nrural transactions are done through business correspondents, and this is projected to increase \nto 25%\u201330% by 2018\u20132019 (footnote 11). \n \n7.  Investment rationale. Given the continued need to address access to finance issues for \nmany customer segments in India, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has sought to identify \nfinancial institution partners that have demonstrated the ability to reach underbanked segments \nwhile maintaining profitability and good asset quality. In 2014, ADB approved a project with two \nprivate banks in India to address access to funding gaps for agri-lending.12 In 2015, it approved \na  project  with  another private  bank  to  support financial  inclusion  in India.13 In  2016,  ADB \napproved  a  project  to  support  microfinance  lending  to  women  borrowers  and  sanitation \nfinancing.14 To build on ADB\u2019s initiatives to promote financial inclusion in India, ADB met with a \nnumber of private banks that are reaching underbanked segments and seeking to expand their \noperations in this area. IndusInd Bank Limited (IndusInd) is ADB\u2019s partner as a local currency \n                                                \n8  RBI. 2013.

In FY2016, IndusInd\u2019s priority sector \nadvances reached out to more than 2 million poor households, including almost 1.5 million \nagriculturalists, across 25 states and 395 districts. About 40% of the loans were for agriculture \nand animal husbandry (covering such areas as vegetable cultivation, borewell digging, pump \nsets, livestock loans for buffalo, cow and sheep rearing, and kitchen poultry units); and the \nbalance was for other microenterprises (including saree trading, street vendors, milk vendors, \nfruit and vegetable businesses, cycle repair shops, weavers, bangle vendors, tea stalls, and \ntailoring). These types of microenterprise activities are also the subject of IndusInd\u2019s business \ncorrespondent model lending.     \n \n8.  ADB\u2019s funding will help support IndusInd\u2019s financial inclusion program, enabling it to \nreach a wider geographic segment of the underbanked and unbanked. IndusInd has a strong \nand  expanding  footprint  in  underserved  regions  of  India,  and  focuses  on  maximizing \ndevelopment impact by reaching a large number of women borrowers to whom ADB cannot \nlend directly. This shows clear alignment with ADB\u2019s development objectives. IndusInd has \nbeen identified as an excellent partner for a direct ADB funding initiative as it provides a unique \nopportunity to expand work with a bank that has a strong ongoing commitment to inclusive \nfinance, having built it profitably as a core business.16  \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n9.  IndusInd is a private sector bank in India that was incorporated in 1994. It offers a full \nrange of banking services and is the fifth-largest private sector bank in India by total assets and \n33rd largest bank overall. The bank operates across four divisions: (i) corporate and commercial \nbanking, (ii) consumer banking, (iii) global markets group, (iv) and transaction banking. It has a \ndiversified loan book and services the spectrum of customers including individuals; micro, small, \nand medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs); and corporate groups. IndusInd has a strong deposit \nfranchise, mobilizing customer deposits through 1,000 branches and 1,800 ATMs spread across \nthe country. It has a long-term debt rating of AA+ from ICRA (Moody\u2019s), India Ratings and \nResearch (Fitch), and CARE Ratings. \n \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n \n10.  Ownership.  Integrity  due  diligence  has  been  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nIntegrity Due Diligence Guidelines for Nonsovereign Operations. No significant or potentially \nsignificant  integrity  issues  were  identified.  IndusInd  is  promoted  by  IndusInd  International \nHoldings Limited and its subsidiary Indusind Limited. Both are entities established by non-\nresident Indians led by S. P. Hinduja. IndusInd International Holdings Limited and IndusInd \nLimited collectively hold 16.7% of all shares and is the largest shareholding group. IndusInd is \nlisted on the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd.  \n \n                                                \n15 ADB. 2010. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Microfinance Risk \nParticipation Program. Manila.  \n16 IndusInd has won several awards and has been recognized internationally for its inclusive financing and corporate \nsocial responsibility (CSR) practices. These awards include the Best Financial Inclusion Initiative at the India \nBanking Association Awards in 2016, the Best Rural Outreach Award at the Sustainability Leadership Awards 2014 \nin Dubai, Top CSR Advocates in Asia at the Asia Corporate Excellence and Sustainability Awards 2014 in \nSingapore, and the Financial Inclusion and Payment Systems Award 2014 for the bank\u2019s partnership program \nunder its business correspondent model.  \n ", "4   \n \n11.  Management. IndusInd\u2019s senior management team has full executive powers and is \nresponsible for the day-to-day operations of the bank. It includes an experienced team of \nprofessionals, led by Romesh Sobti who has 34 years of banking experience, having worked at \nABN Amro and ANZ Grindlays, and consists of 12 other senior managers who head individual \nbusiness lines and associated support functions, as well as an independent risk function. \n \n12.  Governance  structure.  As  a  listed  company,  IndusInd  must  comply  with  the \ngovernance requirements of the exchanges on which it is listed. The bank is supervised by a \nboard of directors consisting of nine members, with board membership approved by the RBI. Of \nthe nine board members, six are considered independent under Indian law.  \n \nD.  Financial Performance \n \n13.  Capital. IndusInd has a CAR under Basel III guidelines of 15.5% and Tier 1 CAR of \n14.9% at the end of FY2016. This compares with a CAR of 12.1% and Tier 1 CAR of 11.2% at \nthe end of FY2015. The bank has a demonstrated record of mobilizing equity capital at regular \nintervals to support its growth. Total capital at the end of FY2016 was Rs180 billion, against \nRs107 billion in FY2015. In July 2015, the bank raised Rs43.3 billion through the placement of \nshares with institutional investors, as well as Rs7.5 billion from the promoters to enable them to \nretain their 16.7% stake.  \n \n14.  Loan portfolio. At the end of FY2016, IndusInd had total assets of Rs1,400 billion and \nthe loan portfolio reached Rs884 billion. This represented loan growth of 29% during FY2016 \n(against  25%  in  FY2015).  The  bank\u2019s  loan  portfolio  in  FY2016  was  split  59:41  between \ncorporate banking and consumer finance (59:41 in FY2015).   \n \n15.  Asset quality. IndusInd\u2019s asset quality is sound, with a gross NPA ratio of 0.87% under \nRBI guidelines at the end of FY2016. This was a slight increase from the FY2015 level of 0.81%. \nThe asset quality of the bank has remained stable in recent years, although  gross NPAs \nincreased slightly during FY2014 in line with industry trends as a result of slippages in the \ncommercial vehicle segment. This has since stabilized as growth has slowed in this segment. \nNPAs across other portfolio segments have been decreasing. The bank\u2019s very limited exposure \nto stressed sectors such as infrastructure, power, iron and steel, and textiles has helped its \nasset quality. Net NPAs were a low 0.36% at the end of FY2016 (0.31% in FY2015).  \n  \n16.  Earnings. The bank has continued to increase profitability since 2010, returning net \nprofit after tax of Rs22.9 billion in FY2016, a 27% increase over FY2015 net profit of Rs17.9 \nbillion; (FY2014: Rs14.1 billion). This resulted in sound profitability metrics for FY2016\u2014a return \non assets of 1.9% and return on average equity of 16.8% (FY2015: return on assets of 1.9%; \nreturn on average equity of 18.6%). The decrease in return on average equity was due to the \nsignificant capital raised during FY2016.  \n \n17.  Funding. IndusInd\u2019s liability funding is diversified, with deposits to total liability funding \nstanding at 76% at the end of FY2016. The remaining funding consists of a mix of domestic \nbank and institutional borrowings and subordinated debt, the majority of which has a maturity of \nless than 3 years. The bank has seen steady improvement in its deposit base following a \nstrategy of new product launches and expanding its branch network. This contributed to the \n25% increase in deposits during FY2016.  \n \n \n ", "5 \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n18.  ADB will provide a senior loan of up to $200 million for up to 7 years to IndusInd to help \nsupport its microfinance activities under its business correspondent model. The objective is to \ndrive financial inclusion17 by providing credit to significantly underserved market segments, \npredominantly women in rural areas of India\u2019s less-developed states. ADB also expects to \nprovide capacity building technical assistance (TA) in an amount of up to $1 million, which will \naccompany  the  ADB  funding  and  will  target  financial  inclusion  initiatives  that  IndusInd  is \nimplementing or developing. This includes financial and legal literacy programs for women, and \ndigitized processing and product development initiatives.18 \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  ADB  will  carry  out  project  monitoring.  IndusInd  will  provide  ADB  with  reports  at \npredetermined regular intervals including (i) unaudited financial statements on a quarterly basis; \n(ii) audited financial statements on an annual basis; (iii) compliance certificates for financial \ncovenants; (iv) reporting on the inclusive finance and business correspondent loan portfolio; \n(v) reporting on selected development indicators agreed between ADB and IndusInd, including \nthe gender action plan; and (vi) compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).  \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n20.  Support to financial inclusion. ADB\u2019s funding will help IndusInd to grow and reach \nsignificantly underserved customer segments in India. Additional funding will enable it to meet \nand exceed PSL targets\u2014a key government objective. By providing long-term funding support \nto a leading private bank focused on financial inclusion, ADB has the opportunity to support PSL \ninitiatives and promote financial inclusion to women in less developed areas in India.  \n \n21.  Access to long-term funding. Banks in India largely lend from short-term, less stable \ndeposits because of difficulties in sourcing sufficient long-term financing. Bond markets in India \nare not well developed, except for raising short- to medium-term paper (up to 3\u20135 years), \nthereby restricting wholesale sources of medium- to long-term funds. Increasing competition for \ndeposits and the Basel III requirement for more stable funding sources requires banks to borrow \nfrom diversified sources to fill large funding gaps, including international financial institutions. \nADB\u2019s loan will provide scarce long-term funds to IndusInd to help support the expansion of its \ndedicated financial inclusion business. \n \n22.  Gender equity theme. Only 29.4% of women compared with 43.8% of men have formal \nsavings, and only 11.3% of women against 15.8% of men have access to credit.19 Lack of land \ntitle\u2014exacerbated by other constraints, including lack of collateral needed to obtain credit, low \n                                                \n17 The RBI defines financial inclusion as \u201cthe process of ensuring access to financial services and timely and \nadequate credit where needed by vulnerable groups such as weaker sections and low income groups at an \naffordable cost.\u201d S.P.

The \nfinancial and legal literacy training programs of the bank are expected to provide a basic \nknowledge of savings, investments, and loans to women borrowers; and introduce successful \nwomen entrepreneurs as mentors. \n \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n23.  Impact. The project will enhance financial inclusion in India.  \n \n24.  Outcome. The outcome will be improved and sustainable financial intermediation to \nmicro-borrowers, with a specific focus on women.  \n \n25.  Output. The project\u2019s output will be IndusInd\u2019s increased financial capacity to service \nwomen microfinance borrowers under its inclusive finance business operations.  \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n \n26.  Under the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020, ADB aims to strengthen the finance sector \nby promoting inclusive growth.21 Inclusive finance will be supported by the focus on rural areas \nwhere productivity is low and the potential for income generation is high. The assistance is also \nconsistent with the country partnership strategy, 2013\u20132017 for India, which highlights the \nimportance of inclusive growth through inclusive financial systems.22 ADB will assist IndusInd to \nexpand its services to low-income women in less-developed states, which is consistent with the \ngovernment\u2019s efforts as emphasized in the Nachiket Mor Committee Report and the fourth pillar \nof the RBI\u2019s framework to guide development and regulatory measures focused on financial \ninclusion.23 The project is also aligned with ADB\u2019s Gender Equality and Women\u2019s Empowerment \nand Operational Plan, 2013\u20132020.24 It is designed to have a gender equity theme and will \ndirectly target the provision of financial services to women.  \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n   \n27.  The investment is classified category FI treated as C for impacts on the environment, \ninvoluntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. IndusInd\u2019s existing and likely future portfolios \nwere assessed for potential environmental and social impacts, as well as its commitment to and \ncapacity for  environmental  and  social management. The bank\u2019s  inclusive  finance  business \nactivities have minimal or no adverse environmental impacts, and are unlikely to entail impacts \non  the  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  financial \nintermediary will apply ADB\u2019s prohibited investment activities list; exclude all projects classified \ncategory  A  or  B  for  environment,  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples;  and  ensure  that \ninvestments using ADB funds abide by applicable national laws and regulations. IndusInd will \n                                                \n20 ADB. 2013. India: Gender Equality Diagnostic of Selected Sectors. Manila.  \n21 ADB. 2014.

Anticorruption Policy  \n \n28.  IndusInd was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating \nto combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism.
