THE PROPOSAL\n \n \n1.  I  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nprogrammatic approach for the Decentralized Public Service and Financial Management Sector \nDevelopment Program, (ii) a proposed policy-based loan for subprogram 1, and (iii) a proposed \nproject loan for subprogram 1 of the Decentralized Public Service and Financial Management Sector \nDevelopment Program to the Kingdom of Cambodia. The report also describes proposed capacity \ndevelopment  technical  assistance  (CDTA)  for  Decentralized  Public  Service  and  Financial \nManagement, and if the Board approves the proposed programmatic approach, policy-based loan, \nand loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the CDTA.1 \n \n2.   The program seeks to improve public service delivery by supporting the development of \nefficient and accountable subnational administrations. The program comprises policy-based lending \nand project lending. In close alignment with the Government of Cambodia\u2019s subnational democratic \ndevelopment reforms, the program will (i) assist in the development of the policy and regulatory \nframework for decentralization, (ii) provide selected rural districts with offices for their operations, \nand (iii) contribute to the development of financial management capacity in central and subnational \npublic administrations.2   \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.   Uneven distribution of economic growth and large disparities in poverty reduction. \nTerritorial development disparities across Cambodia are partly the result of the country\u2019s narrow \nbase for economic growth and a historical deficit of infrastructure investment in rural areas, but are \nalso a result of weak service delivery mechanisms. Robust economic growth between 1998 and \n2007  has resulted  in  substantially  reduced  poverty  rates, from  47%  in  1993 to  30%  in  2007. \nHowever,  in  a  pattern common  to  other  Southeast  Asian  nations,  economic growth  has  been \naccompanied  by  significant  increases  in  income  inequality  and  an  uneven  distribution  of \ndevelopment gains. In 2007 rural areas of Cambodia displayed poverty rates of about 35% and \naccounted for 91% of the poor. By comparison, only about 9% of the poor live in urban areas, with \naverage poverty rates of 22% (less than 1% of the population in Phnom Penh is poor).3  \n \n \n4.   Weak  service  delivery  mechanisms  and  a  fledging  culture  of  local  participatory \ndemocracy.  Greater  disparities  are  observed  in  access  to  basic  services.  The  percentage  of \nfamilies with access to safe drinking water varies from 92% in Phnom Penh to less than 30% in \nMondul  Kiri  Province. The  average  distance from  a  village to  a  health  center  in  Stung Treng \nProvince is 25 kilometers (km), compared with a national average of less than 5 km. Largely as a \nresult of limited access to services, human development indicators for rural areas lag behind those \nof urban areas. Infant mortality rates are about three times higher in rural areas (64 deaths per \n1,000 children) than urban areas (22 deaths per 1,000 children).4An inefficient mix of centralized \n \nand deconcentrated mechanisms limits the capacity of government to match service delivery to local \nneeds.5Local planning and budget formulation systems do not yet fully incorporate the needs and \n \npreferences of local constituencies. This limits the capacity of local populations to hold subnational \nadministrations  (SNAs)  accountable  for  their  performance.  In  addition,  there  is  a  lack  of  both \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided policy and advisory TA.

Improved  living  standards  through  subnational  democratic  development.  The \ngovernment is committed to tackling local development disparities by creating democratically elected \nSNAs that meet locally defined priorities in service delivery. The policy framework for reforms is \ncontained in the National Program for Subnational Democratic Development (NP-SNDD) 2010\u2013\n2019.6  Efforts  toward  subnational  democratic  development  in  Cambodia  began  with  the  2001 \nOrganic  Law  on  Commune/Sangkat  Administrative  Management,  which  allowed  for  the  direct \nelection  of  councilors.  Since  2002,  commune  councils  have  gained  legitimacy  as  the  local \nrepresentatives, and their share of expenditure has increased from 1.5% of domestic revenues to \n2.7% by 2008. The current wave of reforms\u2014initiated in 2008 with the Organic Law on Capital, \nProvinces,  Municipalities,  Districts,  and  Khans\u2014extends  subnational  democratic  development \nreforms  to the  district and  municipal  level  of administration.  Having established  democratically \nelected SNAs, the policy reform focus is on the regulatory framework for intergovernmental fiscal \nrelations, and on administrative decentralization. District and municipal councils lack clear functional \nresponsibilities,  an  adequate  financing  system,  and,  often,  even  premises  to  operate  from.  In \naddition, SNAs need substantial capacity development to ensure their efficient operation.  \n \n6.   Lessons  learned  from  Asian  Development  Bank  sector  experience.  The  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) initiated its assistance to subnational democratic development reforms in \nCambodia through the Commune Council Development Project.7 Under the two phases of the \nproject,  697  commune  centers  were  built,  capacity  development  for  commune  councils  was \nprovided, and a civil registration system was implemented. The centers have facilitated good local \ngovernance at the commune level. The project delegated procurement and contract implementation \nresponsibilities to the commune councils, helping build their project management skills and assisting \nlocal  ownership.8 ADB  has  supported  the  development  of  the  regulatory  framework  for \n \nintergovernmental fiscal relations in Cambodia.9 Technical assistance has been provided for the \n \npreparation of the Subnational Finance Law 2011, the District Municipal Transfer Fund, and the \nSub-Decree  on  Functional  Assignments,  among  other  regulations.  Coordination  of  activities \nbetween the National Committee for Democratic Development at the Subnational Level Secretariat \n(NCDD-S), the Ministry of Interior (MOI), and the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) has been \nessential for  efficient  delivery  of  advisory  assistance.  ADB\u2019s TA  has also  underlined  the  large \ncapacity development needs of SNAs, and the importance of providing adequate support to the line \nministries that will pilot future functional assignments to SNAs. Support for subnational democratic \ndevelopment reforms has been identified as a crosscutting theme by ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy 2012\u20132015.10 The reforms will impact many other parallel efforts assisted by ADB, such as \npublic  financial  management  reforms,11  and  may  also  aid  work  in  sectors  such  as  education, \nagriculture, and rural development. \n                                                \n6    The  Strategic  Framework   for  Decentralization  and  Deconcentration   Reforms  2005  provided  an  earlier  policy \nreference. \n7   ADB. 2006.

Manila (Grant 0066-CAM, for  $7.80 \nmillion, approved on 12 December). \n8  The design of the project under subprogram 1 draws heavily on other best practices from the Commune Council \nDevelopment Project, in particular with regard to implementation arrangements (i.e., project delegation to ADB\u2019s \nresident mission, disbursement of block grants to SNAs through private financial institutions, community participation in \nproject monitoring, and others).  \n9    ADB.  2009.

The comprehensive nature of the subnational \ndemocratic development policy reforms needs to be supported by adequate investments on public \ninfrastructure and institutional capacity that allow district administrations to assume their future \nresponsibilities  in  service  delivery.  The  sector  development  program  lending  modality  best \narticulates  these  needs  while  offering  a  framework  for  ADB\u2019s  long-term  support  to  reforms. \nCoordination  with  development  partners  has  been  fruitful.  The  policy  matrix  has  received \ndevelopment partner contributions through several meetings of the donors\u2019 working group, currently \ncochaired by ADB. The program has been discussed with civil society organizations, benefiting from \ntheir inputs on areas such as project implementation arrangements and management of grievances. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The expected impact of the program is improved access to and coverage of basic services \nacross the  country.12  The  expected  outcome  is  an  efficient  system  of  intergovernmental fiscal \nrelations that assists service delivery by SNAs.13 The proposed subprogram includes a policy-based \nloan and a project loan. The policy-based loan includes 29 reform actions (10 triggers and 19 \nmilestones)  that  the  government  completed  during  2010\u20132012.  The  project  loan  will  provide \nassistance to the construction of rural district offices and institutional and capacity development for \nlocal public financial management.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n1.  Policy-Based Loan Outputs \n \n9.  The policy-based loan is structured around seven major outputs covering all key areas of \nreform:  \n(i)  development and regular update of a gender-sensitive policy and regulatory framework   \nfor decentralization, \n(ii)  establishment  of  institutions  for  efficient  coordination  of  subnational  democratic \ndevelopment policies, \n(iii)  definition of clear service delivery responsibilities of SNAs, \n(iv)  assignment of efficient tax and nontax revenue sources to SNAs, \n(v)  implementation of fiscal transfers that ensure comparable levels of service delivery \nacross SNAs,  \n(vi)  development of capacities for efficient decentralized public financial management, and  \n(vii)  design  and  implementation  of  accountability  mechanisms  for  SNAs  to  their \nconstituencies.  \n \n10.  Each of the outputs includes triggers and milestones that are drawn from the Three-Year \nImplementation  Plan  (IP3)  for  the  NP-SNDD.  Accomplishment  of  several  of  the  triggers  and \nmilestones included in subprogram 2 is expected as early as late 2012, effectively sequencing \nreforms during the full subprogram period. \n \n11.  Development and regular update of gender-sensitive policy and regulatory framework \nfor decentralization. The government has made substantive progress in developing an efficient \npolicy and regulatory framework for reforms where gender considerations are mainstreamed. The \nNP-SNDD (2010\u20132019) has been approved, together with the first IP3. The IP3 mainstreams gender  \nin  subnational  democratic  development  reforms  and gender experts have  been appointed at  the  \nNCDD-S. Subprogram 2 of the cluster will assist development of the second gender-responsive IP3 \n A\n(2014\u20132016) and the preparation of midterm reviews.    p\np\n  e\nn\nd\nix\n                                                  4  \n12   Including basic health and sanitation services, rural road rehabilitation, and agricultural extension.   3 \n \n13  The impact and outcome statements are common to the policy-based loan and the project loan of subprogram 1. \n \n ", "4    \n12.  Establishment  of  institutions  for  efficient  coordination  and  policy  design  of \nsubnational  democratic  development  policies.  The  Subdecree  on  the  Establishment  and \nFunctioning of the NCDD-S was approved in December 2011 in order to (i) establish the mandate of \nthe NCDD-S to generate decentralization and deconcentration policy, (ii) reorganize divisions \nand offices to better align them with the NP-SNDD, and (iii) create permanent civil service positions. \nAll subcommittees of the NCDD-S are fully appointed and hold meetings as required. A draft \nstrategy for gender-responsive human resource management at the subnational level has been \nprepared and is being discussed by the NCDD-S subcommittee on personnel. Subprogram 2 will \nsupport the development of a civil service code for SNAs that strives for gender equity in civil service \nrecruitment and the strengthening of the NCDD-S as the lead agency for decentralization and \ndeconcentration reforms. \n \n13.  Definition of clear responsibilities for service delivery of subnational administrations. \nThe government has approved a subdecree on a strategy for functional assignments and, with \npriority ministries, is piloting manuals for gender-responsive functional mapping and reviews. The \nNCDD subcommittee on functional assignments and resources is in operation. Subprogram 2 will \nassist the piloting of the first functional assignments to SNAs, once functional mapping and review \nprocesses in priority ministries are completed. \n \n14.  Assignment  of  efficient  tax  and  nontax  revenue  sources  to  subnational \nadministrations.  With  the  introduction  of  Ministerial  Order  371  of  2011,  the  government  has \nauthorized  the  collection  of  property  tax  at  the  provincial  level.  The  government  continues  to \nevaluate potential sources of own revenues for SNAs. Subprogram 2 will support the development \nof a subdecree on revenue assignments (tax and nontax to SNAs).  \n \n15.  Implementation of fiscal transfers that ensure comparable levels of service delivery \nacross subnational administrations. The government has approved the creation of the District \nand Municipal Fund. The fund includes the definition of a formula-based development component for \ndiscretionary expenditure of districts and municipalities. For subprogram 2, the government will \ndesign the system of conditional grants for delegated functions to SNAs. In addition, the government \nwill establish the Subnational Investment Facility (SNIF), a complementary element of the financing \nsystem of SNAs. The SNIF will aim to mobilize financial resources for local investment projects in \nkey  development  sectors.  A  competitive  project  selection  system  will  reward  good  project \npreparation, and capacity development assistance will be provided to weaker SNAs.  \n \n16.  Development of capacities for efficient decentralized public financial management. \nThe government has approved the Law on Financial Regime and Property Management of Sub-\nNational  Administrations  that  provides  the  structure  of  intergovernmental  fiscal  relations.  The \nimplementation of the law is assisted by the Sub-Decree on Financial Management procedures and \nassociated regulations. Subprogram 2 will assist the further implementation of the subdecree with \nthe approval of regulations for the subnational budget classification and chart of accounts; the \nguidelines for budget preparation, execution, and audit; and accounting and payment procedures. In \naddition, the capacity of the National Audit Authority for SNA audit and the capacities of local \nfinancial officers and central government departments on SNA financial management systems will \nbe strengthened.  \n \n17.  Design  and  implementation  of  accountability  mechanisms  for  subnational \nadministrations to their constituencies. The government has finalized and is piloting technical \nmanuals on SNA council meetings and public forums that promote the equal participation of men \nand women. In addition, the government has conducted the first training of trainers for 79 facilitators \nto assist dissemination of the manuals to all districts and municipalities. The NCDD-S has developed \na district charter template, which will be piloted in the second half of 2012, providing a guideline for \nthe preparation of district charters as stipulated by the Organic Law of 2008. Subprogram 2 will \n ", "5 \nsupport further implementation of coaching and mentoring systems and the adoption of  district \ncharters by these SNAs. \n \n2.  Project Loan Outputs \n \n18.  Output  1:  Construction  of  district  offices  in  rural  areas.14  The  project  will  provide \napproximately 40 selected rural districts with basic premises. The districts will be selected on the \ncriteria of poverty, population, and state of premises. The project will not entail any land acquisition. \nOnly public land, upon presentation of the land title, will be used for construction. Upon signing of a \nblock allocation agreement between the district authorities and the MOI, district authorities will take \nfull  responsibility  for  procurement,15  contract  implementation,  and  processing  interim  payments \nbased on progress at sites. Initial orientation and procurement training will be provided to selected \ndistricts to ensure their capacities are built.16  \n \n19.  Output  2:  Efficient  system  of  intergovernmental  fiscal  relations  developed; \nexpenditure  and  revenue  assignments  and  fiscal  transfers  designed  and  implemented. \nAdvisory assistance provided to the MEF will include support to the development of a medium- and \nlong-term strategic road map for fiscal decentralization in Cambodia, the definition of tax and nontax \nrevenue assignments to SNAs, and the review and design of conditional and unconditional transfers. \nConsultants will be recruited using ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time). \n \n20.  Output 3: Development of the Subnational Investment Facility. The project will support \nthe development of the SNIF, designed to mobilize resources for local investment projects through \ncompetitive procedures. The package of outputs will include, as required, technical support to draft \nthe regulations on the SNIF, its operational guidelines, the terms of reference for the facility\u2019s staff, \nand advisory services for pilot testing and initial implementation. The government is committed to \nensure the SNIF is in full operation by 2014. \n \n21.   Output  4:  Capacities  for  efficient  decentralized  public  financial  management \ndeveloped. The project will enhance the financial management oversight, monitoring, and support \ncapacity of SNAs by the MEF and its provincial departments. The project will build the knowledge \nbase and analytical foundations on fiscal decentralization and local public financial management at \nthe Local Finance Department of the MEF. It will provide analytical inputs, training and training \nsupport, systems development, and capacity development to relevant MEF departments, provincial \ndepartments, and provincial administrations.   \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n22.  Subprogram 1 is estimated to cost $38.46 million equivalent (Table 1).

The  MOI  will  be  the \nimplementing agency for output 1 and the MEF will be the implementing agency for outputs 2\u20134. \nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the project \nadministration manual (PAM).19 A project technical cell will be established at the MOI to assist with \nimplementation  of  output  1.  The  cell  will  provide  orientation  and  capacity  building  to  district \nadministrations in procurement and contract implementation, and will act as coach on technical \n                                                \n17  The proceeds of the policy-based loan will be disbursed in accordance with provisions set out in ADB. 1998.

The loan proceeds will be used to \nfinance the cost (excluding local taxes and duties) of items produced and procured in ADB member countries, \nexcluding ineligible items. \n18  Inclusion of taxes and duties on ADB-financed project expenditures is consistent with the current country partnership \nstrategy. Financing of taxes and duties does not represent an excessive share of the project cost and it is material to \nthe success of the project. \n19   Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nmatters.

In  response  to  the  government  request,  ADB  incorporates  the  proposed  capacity \ndevelopment TA for Decentralized Public Service and Financial Management for subprogram 2 for \napproval with subprogram 1. The CDTA is estimated to cost $800,000 equivalent, which will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB's Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The government \nwill contribute with office space, transport, national staff per diem, and communications within the \npossibilities of the budget of the NCDD-S. Assets required for TA implementation will be procured \nunder ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). 20 \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n27.  The set of policy reforms and project initiatives proposed may conservatively add $300 \nmillion to gross domestic product, or approximately 2.5 percentage points, over the duration of the \nprogram.21  The  policy  adjustment  costs  to  the  government  are  conservatively  estimated  as  a \ndiscounted present value lump sum of $139.5 million. These include the administrative, investment, \n A\nand fiscal costs to the government in implementing the reforms. As a result, the expected net benefit    p\np\ne\nn\nd\n                                                 ix\n20 Capacity Development Technical Assistance for Decentralized Public Service and Financial Management (accessible   4  \n \nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  7\n \n21 Estimates of benefits extend to 2017, while present value sum of costs incorporates recurrent costs for the next    \ndecade   of reform implementation.  \n ", "8    \nfrom the program is estimated at some $160 million.22 The size of the program loan is based on a \nnumber of factors. The key considerations include the potential importance of the sector to the \neconomy, as subnational public expenditure is expected to reach close to 20% of total government \nexpenditure over the life of the NP-SNDD. The reform program includes several politically sensitive \nand complex policy and institutional reforms. To support the reforms, the program loan provides \nleverage to the executing and implementing agencies to support implementation. The program loan \nalso reflects the government\u2019s development financing needs as well as the need to conform to the \noverall financing requirement from the country partnership strategy period.  \n \nB.  Governance \n \n28.  An  assessment  of  the  country\u2019s  financial  management  systems  was  conducted  to \nunderstand fiduciary risks and determine appropriate fiduciary arrangements for the purposes of this \noperation.23 On the basis of these evaluations, the country\u2019s public financial management systems \nhave been found adequate. An external assessment of the NCDD-S was undertaken to evaluate its \ncapacity to manage decentralized reforms. The report concluded that internal control is not fully \nestablished or operational in the secretariat, whereas accounting and external audit functions and \nprocurement  systems  are  well  established  and  operate  to  a  satisfactory  degree.24  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the \ngovernment,  NCDD-S,  MEF,  and  MOI.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 19). \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n29.  Subnational democratic development reforms in Cambodia are expected to assist economic \ngrowth and poverty reduction through a variety of channels: (i) higher economic growth through \nallocative efficiency in the delivery of public services to the poor, (ii) productive efficiency in service \ndelivery,  and  (iii)  providing  incentives  for  improved  revenue  collection  and  public  expenditure. \nEfficiency gains in public spending from reassignment of expenditure functions to local government \nmay boost growth and reduce inequality. Local economic development can also be assisted if local \ngovernments increase the scope and improve the quality of public infrastructure spending, and as \nnew financing instruments for investment, such as the SNIF, are implemented. The second channel \nis through the impact of potentially higher productive efficiency in the delivery of basic services at \nthe local level. The use of local contractors and local materials for delivery of local services may \noffer important savings in public expenditure. Finally, the third channel refers to the incentives for \nrevenue  mobilization  (and  thus  local  public  expenditure) from the  assignment  of  own  revenue \nsources to SNAs. Local populations may be more willing to contribute from tax and nontax sources if \nthey know those revenues will be used for local service delivery.  \n \n30.  Gender  and  subnational  democratic  development.  The  program  is  categorized  as \neffective gender mainstreaming. The key gender impacts of the program include increased women\u2019s \nparticipation in planning and administrative functions in district and municipal structures; greater \nintegration of women\u2019s needs and priorities in the development of legislation, policies, and programs \nrelated to subnational democratic development; strengthened gender awareness and capacities of \nmale and female civil servants; and gender-sensitive development planning and resource allocation \nto support the delivery of services which address the specific needs and interests of men and \nwomen  in  the  community.  The  policies  supported  by  subprogram  1  ensure  that  (i)  gender  is \n                                                \n22  The Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents) provides detailed information on the \nestimates of benefits and costs. \n23  The fiduciary assessment relies on the recent substantive diagnostic work including the Cambodia governance risk      \nassessment and risk management plan, public finance management assessment based on the public expenditure \nfinancial accountability framework, and external review of the government\u2019s Financial Management Reform Program. \n24  European Commission Development and Cooperation. 2011. Assessment Concerning Decentralized Management.   \nPhnom Penh. \n ", "9 \nmainstreamed into the IP3 and gender functions are integrated in the annual work plans and \nbudgets of the six implementing agencies; (ii) the NCDD-S is supported by gender experts, (iii) a \ndraft gender-responsive human resource strategy is developed to increase women\u2019s entry and \npromotion  within  the  civil  service,  (iv)  manuals  developed  for  functional  mapping  and  reviews \nintegrate  gender  mainstreaming  needs  in  the  priority  ministries,  and  (v)  guidelines  for  council \ndeliberations promote gender-sensitive processes and all women councilors are trained on the \ntools.25  \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n31.  Safeguards due diligence and review of the policy matrix show that policy actions will have \nno impacts on the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. Similarly, due \ndiligence and review show that the project will not have impacts on the environment, involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples. The project is categorized C for all safeguards. \n  \n32.  There will be no land acquisition as subproject works are restricted to existing government \nland. All land to be used will have clear titles and be free of all encumbrances. These lands are not \noccupied or productively used by legal or nontitled occupants. The subproject selection criteria \nensure that any proposed subproject with any involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples \nimpacts will not be included as part of the project. The subproject selection criterion also requires \nthat proposed subprojects have no environmental impacts other than minimal adverse impacts.  \n \n33.  The implementing agencies will categorize all proposed subprojects to ensure that they are \ncategory  C  for  all  safeguards.  Review  and  field  visits  for  sample  subprojects  confirm  that \nenvironmental implications are limited to standard small-scale impacts of constructing single or two-\nstory  administration  buildings  for  50\u201380  persons,  and  provision  of  equipment.  Environmental \nmanagement plans containing environmental guidelines were developed during program processing \nto  establish  rules,  procedures,  and  institutional  arrangements  to  be  undertaken  with  regard  to \nidentifying,  monitoring,  and  mitigating  adverse  environmental  impacts  due  to  small  civil  works \nactivities. The guidelines include a construction site checklist, environmental design criteria, and \nstandardized  environmental  management  plans.  The  guidelines  will  be  implemented  by  the \nimplementing agency supported by the project implementation unit. Consultations were undertaken \nwith stakeholders during program processing, including consulting with women to ascertain their \nviews on appropriate design of administration buildings. Since the program is categorized C for all \nsafeguards, no safeguards documents are required to be disclosed on ADB\u2019s website.  \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n34.  Major risks and mitigating measures include losing reform momentum, and lack of adequate \nfinancial and institutional support to the NCDD-S. The reforms are complex from a technical point of \nview, comprehensive in their approach, and involve most central government agencies and all levels \nof  administration.  Through  the  attached  TA,  the  recently  created  NCDD  will  receive  advisory \nassistance on several of the key reforms outlined for subprogram 2 of the programmatic approach, \nsupplemented by continued policy dialogue with ADB. Greater detail on fiduciary risks to efficient \nprogram implementation is provided in the risk assessment and risk management plan.26 Among \nthem,  development  and  implementation  of  the  regulation  for  subnational  public  financial \nmanagement systems (including budget formulation and audit processes) is of key importance. The \nattached TA will assist the dissemination of new regulations and the training of subnational staff on \nsuch procedures. A comprehensive governance and fiduciary risk assessment of the SNIF will be   A\n  p\nprepared during design to ensure that (i) the proposed facility is aligned with the reform objectives  p\ne\nn\nand  national  and  local  development  priorities,  (ii)  the  SNIF  does  not  incorporate  risks  to  the  d\nix\n4 \n  \n                                                 9 \n \n25  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10    \nmacroeconomic stability of the country,27 and (iii) the selection and financing of projects under the \nfacility  follow  accountable  and  transparent  mechanisms  in  line  with  best  public  financial \nmanagement practices. Efficient reforms will also require adequate MEF capacity for oversight and \nmonitoring of local finances, which the program will support through the institutional and capacity \nbuilding component of the project loan.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n35.  The government and NCDD-S have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in \nthe PAM and loan documents. The government and NCDD-S have also agreed with ADB on certain \ncovenants for the program, which are set forth in the loan agreements.  \n \n36.  The government has agreed that the project loan amount for output 1 will not be disbursed \nuntil: a) the process of establishing the project technical cell has been initiated as detailed in the \nproject  loan  agreement  and  b)  the  instructions  for  the  creation  of  the  procurement  review \ncommittees and bid evaluation committee for Project Districts are approved. The government has \nalso agreed that the loan will not be declared effective until the government, through the NCDD-S, \nhas fulfilled all conditions for the subprogram 1 policy-based loan as set out in the policy matrix in \nAppendix 4. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION\n \n \n37.
