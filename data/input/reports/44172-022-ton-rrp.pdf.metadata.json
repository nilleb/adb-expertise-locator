Main economic activities include \nfishery,  agriculture,  and  tourism.  Tonga\u2019s  small  size  and  distance  from  large  markets  do  not \nallow the people to exploit economies of scale. A narrow resource base and small market have \nresulted  in  a  highly  undiversified  economy.  Before the  recent  financial  crisis,  remittances  from \nabout 100,000 Tongans overseas account for an estimated 30% of the gross domestic product \n(GDP).  As  the  global  economic  slowdown  affected  the  principal  remittance-sending  countries \n(Australia, New Zealand, and the United States), remittances fell by 10.2% in FY2010, following \na  decline  of  13.6%  in  FY2009.5 Lack  of  economic  opportunity  within  the  country  resulted  in \nmigration from rural to urban areas, and overseas.  \n \n4. \nTonga\u2019s  isolation  and  other  constraints  to  economic  development  may  be  mitigated  in \npart  by  improved  access  to  and  more  affordable  telecommunications,  especially  high-speed \n(broadband)  internet,  which  offers  new  economic  opportunities  domestically,  as  well  as \nconnections  to  larger  markets,  and  new  avenues  for  delivery  of  services,  nationally  and \ninternationally.  A  recent  World  Bank  study  indicates  that  a  10%  increase  in  broadband \npenetration  results  in  a  1.38%  increase  in  GDP  growth  in  low  and  middle  income  countries.6 \nSuch impacts result from (i) reduced transaction costs for business, government, and household \ncommunications;  (ii)  new  business  opportunities  such  as  investments  in  e-commerce  and \nbusiness process outsourcing facilities; and (iii) improved public service delivery, in particular to \nsupport  e-education  and  e-health  services.  Affordable  high  speed  internet  services  will  help \nTongans maintain social cohesion with their relatives residing abroad and improve disaster risk \nmanagement. \n \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   ADB  provided  project  preparatory  TA,  complementing  preparatory  activities  by  the  World  Bank  and  the  Tonga \nCable  Limited  (ADB.  2010.

Extending  Reach  and  Increasing  Impact:  Information  &  Communication  Technology  for \n\nDevelopment. Washington DC. \n\n\fis  projected  to \n\nTonga  was  the  first  country  in  the  Pacific  to  liberalize  its  telecommunications  sector. \n5. \nSince  2002,  access  to  basic  telecommunications  has  increased  significantly.  Mobile  tele-\ndensity,7 at about 60%, is among the highest in the region; and local and international call tariffs \nare  among  the  lowest  in  the  Pacific.  Internet  penetration,  however,  remains  low  with  about \n2,500 subscribed  broadband  internet  users.  This  is  because  of  the  high  cost  and  limited \navailability  of  international  bandwidth,  resulting  in  congestion.  Internet  service  is  open  for \ncompetition and five internet service providers (ISPs) have been licensed. However, because of \nthe  high  cost  of  satellite  infrastructure  and  capacity  leases,  only  two  telecommunications \noperators are operational ISPs.   \n \n6. \nThe limited capacity and high cost of international bandwidth is the principal constraint to \nhigher  internet  penetration,  the  introduction  of  new  telecommunications  services,  and  new \nmarket entrants. This is due to Tonga\u2019s total dependence on satellite connectivity.  The current \nmarket price for two-way satellite capacity is about $3,600 per megabit per second (Mbps) per \nmonth.  With  normal  growth,  Tonga\u2019s  bandwidth  demand \nincrease  to \n1.243 gigabits per second (Gbps) by 2032.8 With the current satellite capacity and price, it would \nbe impossible to meet the growing demand.  \n \n7. \nThe  government  and  telecommunications  industry  in  Tonga  have  considered  several \noptions to improve access and reduce the international connectivity cost. The preferred option is \nto  invest  in  a  new  submarine  fiber  optic  cable  linking  to  the  Southern  Cross  Cable  Network \n(SCCN)  in  Fiji.  This  will  provide  substantially  higher  initial  capacity  of  10  Gbps  and  reduce \ninternational connectivity costs by more than 60%. Currently, the cheapest broadband internet is \naround  $60  per  month,  which  is  about  28%  of  monthly  income  approximated  with  GDP  per \ncapita  in  2010.  The  submarine  cable  system  will  stimulate  increased  take-up  of  broadband \ninternet by reducing the price rapidly. \n \n8. \nIn addition to the positive socioeconomic impact in Tonga, the submarine cable system \nfrequency  and  quality  of \nIt  will \nwill  contribute \ncommunications  among  the  countries  in  the  region,  thus  increasing  trade  in  services  (tourism \nand back-office functions) and  allowing the region to form a sizable market for  digital products \nand services. It will also strengthen the existing regional public goods and encourage new ones \nby  allowing  countries  to  share  the  limited  knowledge  and  human  resources  available  in  the \nPacific. \n \n9. \nDespite the submarine cable\u2019s perceived benefits, investment in submarine cable in the \nPacific has been limited. The requirement of a large upfront capital investment, a long period of \nreturn  on  investment,  and  commercial  risks  from  rapid  changes  in  technology  and  business \nenvironment  has  led  to  a  market  failure.  A  meager  private  sector  in  Tonga  cannot  mobilize  a \nlarge  investment  for  a  cable.  The  cable\u2019s  long-term  public  benefits  far  exceed  private  sector \ninvestment return, and therefore, the government considers it as a public investment priority. \n \n10. \nThe project responds to the Pacific Islands Forum leaders\u2019 call for improved international \nconnectivity  for  the  islands  member  countries.9 ADB\u2019s  Pacific  Approach  2010\u20142014  stresses \nconnectivity  through  improved  information  and  communication  technology  as  a  driver  of \nchange. 10  It  also  supports  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  in  Tonga  by  contributing  to \n\nto  regional \n\nintegration. \n\nincrease \n\nthe \n\n                                                \n7   The number of subscribers per 100 inhabitants. \n8   World Bank. 2010.

The  outcome  is  that  the  population  of  Tonga  will  have  access  to  good  quality \nbroadband internet services at a lower price.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nOutput  2  will  ensure  efficient  and  effective  project  management  services  by  TCL.  This \n\n12. \nOutput  1  of  the  project  is  the  establishment  and  efficient  operation  of  the  Tonga \nsubmarine cable system by Tonga Cable Limited (TCL), a company established in late 2009 to \ndevelop  submarine  cable  options  for  Tonga.  The  submarine  cable  system  will  comprise \ninstallation  of  an  827-kilometer  cable  link  between  Nuku\u2019alofa  (Tonga)  and  Suva  (Fiji)  and \nconstruction of a landing station in Tonga. In  Fiji, the cable will use an existing landing station \nwhere the Tonga cable is connected to the SCCN for data traffic to Australia, the United States, \nand  the  rest  of  the  world.  TCL  will  procure,  own,  and  operate  the  cable;  and  it  will  be  sole \nwholesaler of the cable capacity to the retail service providers. Output 1 will be jointly financed \nby ADB and the World Bank.  \n  \n13. \noutput will mainly be financed by TCL, with some parallel financing from the World Bank.  \n \n14. \nSince  TCL  will  be  a  sole  wholesaler  with  dominant  market  power  for  international \nconnectivity, it needs to be regulated to maintain cost-based pricing and open and fair access to \nall  retail  service  providers,  thus  maximizing  market  competition.  In  parallel  to  the  project,  the \nWorld  Bank  will  provide  TA  to  support  the  regulator,  the  Ministry  of  Information  and \nCommunications  (MIC),  to  improve  telecommunications  policy  and  the  legal  and  regulatory \nenvironment  for  internet  access  and  e-transactions.  The  TA  will  also  support  MIC\u2019s  capacity \ndevelopment.  It  will  be  financed  by  the  World  Bank  and  the  Government  of  Australia  through \nPRIF.  The  regulatory  and  capacity  development  of  the  MIC  is  critical  to  achieve  the  outcome \nenvisaged  from  the  ADB-financed  outputs.  Close  collaboration  between  ADB  and  the  World \nBank  will  be  maintained during  the  development  of the regulatory framework  and the  capacity \ndevelopment  of  MIC  through  joint  review  of  both  agencies  on  the  terms  of  reference,  inputs, \nreports and recommendations of the consultants. \n \nD. \n \n15. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $32.8  million.  The  investment  plan  is  summarized  in \nTable  1.

Tonga  is  at  high  risk  of  debt  distress  and  cannot  afford  to  take  on \nmore  borrowing  as  its  public  debt  is  projected  to  reach  58.5%  of  gross  domestic  product  in \nFY2011.14 Therefore,  grant  financing  has  been  sought.  TCL  will  provide  counterpart  financing \nequivalent to $6.6 million to fund (i) construction of a landing station, including the land lease; (ii) \nenvironmental management and legal expenses; (iii)  consulting services for cable construction \nsupervision; (iv) taxes and duties; and (v) recurrent costs during construction.  \n \nThe government will make the proceeds of the grants from the cofinanciers available to \n17. \nTCL, against the issuance of shares in the capital of TCL,  under a share purchase agreement \non terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB. The share purchase agreement will require TCL to \nfinance  the  submarine  cable  system  from  the  proceeds  of  the  grants.  The  share  purchase \nagreement will value shares in TCL at the nominal amount contributed by the government and \nTCL\u2019s current sole shareholder, Tonga Communications Corporation (TCC).

The  World  Bank  and  the  Government  of  Tonga \nacknowledge that ADB cannot finance the submarine cable system contract under the currently \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fproposed  arrangements  if  the  Board  of  Directors  does  not  approve  the  project  or  grant  the \nnecessary waiver. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n21. \nThe  project  is  expected  to  benefit  the  population  of  Tonga,  as  the  submarine  cable \nsystem  and  improved  regulations  will  lead  to  low  cost  and  high  quality  broadband  internet \nservice. It will contribute to the economy\u2019s efficiency and bring new business opportunities that \ncan  leverage  Tonga\u2019s  well-educated  young  population  and  diaspora  in  developed  countries.  It \nwill also enable the government to provide better education and health services. Due diligence \nwas  based  on  detailed  technical,  regulatory,  environmental,  and  social  assessments,  and \nconsultations with the stakeholders in Tonga. \n \nA. \n\nTechnical  \n\n22. \nFor the submarine cable system, a technical assessment included the alternative cable \nroutes and different technical options, cable landing station selection, and legal and regulatory \nissues  involved  in  the  cable  system  development  and  operation.  Alternative  cable  routes \nexamined  are  summarized  in  Table  4.  Considering  the  lifespan,  capacity,  and  capital  and \noperational expenses, a new cable to Fiji has been selected as the most feasible and least-cost \noption.  Several  cable  landing  sites  in  Tonga  were  examined,  and  a  site  in  Sopu  area  was \nselected based on its proximity to the shore, availability of land, and minimum disruption to the \nmarine environment and human activities. The landing station building and auxiliary facilities will \nbe designed and built to adapt to cyclones and the rising sea level.   \n \n\nTable 4: Different Route Options for Tonga Submarine Cable \n\nNew cable \n\n \nType of Cable \n\n \nCapex \n($ million) \n42 \n20  \n62  \n29  \n\n \nPoint of \nConnection \nSamoa  \nNew Zealand   Secondhand cable \nNew Zealand   New cable \nFiji \nNew cable \nCapex  =  capital  expenditure,  Gbps  =  gigabits  per  second,  Mbps  =  megabits  per  second,  Opex  =  operating \nexpenditure. \na Samoa has a submarine cable link to American Samoa, which is linked to Hawaii with a recovered (secondhand)    \ncable.

Some modifications made by the Asian Development Bank. \n \n23. \nAt Suva, the cable will land on the existing cable station of SCCN, managed by the Fiji \nInternational  Telecommunications  Limited  (FINTEL).  TCL  will  have  a  landing  party  agreement \nwith  FINTEL  for  collocation  services  and  interconnection  with  SCCN.  As  per  the  landing  party \nagreement, FINTEL will facilitate the necessary permits and authorization from the relevant Fiji \nauthorities, i.e., agencies responsible for communication, land, marine affairs, environment, and \nindigenous  people\u2019s  issues.  The  Fiji  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Department  of  Communications \nhave indicated their support for the project. At Nuku\u2019alofa, TCL will obtain all permits. Once the \ndetailed  cable  route  is  confirmed  by  a  marine  survey,  the  government  will  declare  the  cable \npassing area as a special management area under the Fisheries Management Act to avoid any \ndisrupting fishing practices like trawling. The government will also adopt any other legislation or \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fregulations  required  to  ensure  adequate  protection  of  the  submarine  cable  system  in  its \nterritorial water.  \n  \nB. \n\nFinancial and Economic  \n\n24. \nA financial analysis of the submarine cable system confirmed its financial viability, as its \nfinancial  internal  rate  of  return  (13.63%)  far  exceeded  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital \n(0.02%).  A  sensitivity  analysis  shows  that  the  financial  return  is  more  sensitive  to  demand \ndecrease.  Therefore,  it  is  essential  to  encourage  demand  growth  by  lowering  consumer  price \nthrough competition among retail service providers. A cash flow projection was prepared based \non the revenue projection and the proposed share purchase agreement, and it shows that TCL \ncan  achieve  a  positive  net  cash  flow  from  2013.  This  confirms  that  TCL\u2019s  operation  become \nsustainable during the lifespan of the submarine cable.   \n \n25. \nThe submarine cable system and improved regulatory environment will allow faster and \ncheaper  communications  services,  especially  broadband  internet,  and  exert  a  positive  social \nand economic impact through cost savings, efficiency gains, and better public services, among \nothers.  However,  such  an  impact  is  difficult  to  quantify.  The  economic  analysis  included  only \nquantifiable benefits of the project: (i) incremental benefits, including revenue from the sales of \ncable  capacity  and  consumer  surplus  from  the  additional  internet  subscribers  caused  by  the \nlower  internet  price;  and  (ii)  savings from  replacing  satellite  capacity  with  the  submarine  cable \nfor international bandwidth, and savings by existing internet subscribers as a result of the lower \ninternet price. The economic internal rate of return is 17.3%, which exceeds 12%, the economic \nopportunity  cost  of  capital.  A  sensitivity  analysis  concluded  that  the  project  will  remain \neconomically viable unless TCL revenue falls by 40%.15      \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nthere  are  no  detailed  procedures  or \n\nAnalyses  included  existing  and  proposed  legislation,  regulations,  and  institutional \n26. \nstructures for sector planning and management. Tonga has a good overall framework for sector \nmanagement\u2014the  Communications  Act  2000\u2014which  covers  important  issues  including \nconsumer  protection,  tariff  management,  fixed  licensing  terms  with  opportunities  for  renewal, \nuniversal-service policy, anticompetitive policies, and arbitration. However, it lacks the detailed \nregulations and procedures to guide the  regulator  and the  industry  in an increasingly  complex \nsector  environment.  For  example, \ntransparency \nrequirements  for  licensing.  Established  on  1  May  2009,  the  MIC  is  responsible  for  the  overall \nregulatory  management  of  the  sector,  but  it  lacks  technical  and  human  resource  capacity  to \nfulfill its mandate.  \n \n27. \nThe  government,  the  World  Bank,  and  PRIF  have  agreed  on  a  TA  for  capacity \ndevelopment  and  regulatory  reform  activities.  These  will  include  legal  and  regulatory  reforms \nnecessary  to  incorporate  into  national  law  (i)  Tonga\u2019s  specific  commitments  regarding \ntelecommunications to the World Trade Organization; and (ii) international best practices in the \nfield  of \nto  creating  an  enabling \ntelecommunications and information and communication technology environment; and (b) cyber \nlegislation. The World Bank and PRIF funded TA will also support the government to develop a \nroad map and policy framework to address any remaining medium- and longer-term regulatory \nneeds,  such  as  the  possible  establishment  of  an  independent  regulatory  institution  for  the \ntelecommunications sector.  \n\nregulation,  with  a  view \n\n(a) telecommunications \n\n                                                \n15  Financial and Economic Analyses (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nAs  the  regulatory  reform  and  capacity  development  will  take  time,  the  government  will \n28. \nensure TCL\u2019s operational requirements are well defined within a license. It will be a wholesale \nlicense, and its terms and conditions will require TCL to set cost-based pricing and provide fair \nand open access to the cable capacity for any interested retail service providers. Once issued, \nthe license information will be publicly available through MIC and TCL websites.    \n \n29. \nIn  November  2009,  TCL  was  established  as  a  limited  liability  company  following  the \nCompanies  Act  (Amendment)  2009.  It  became  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  TCC,  a  state-\nowned enterprise, with the intention to offer 20% of TCL\u2019s share capital to private investors after \nthe  cable  system  becomes  operational.  On  the  one  hand,  TCC\u2019s  involvement  and  financial \ncontribution  to  the  project  so  far  has  been  crucial  because  there  is  limited  technical  capacity \nwithin  the  country  for  large-scale  telecommunication  infrastructure  development.  On  the  other \nhand, TCL is a wholesale business and will sell capacity to all retail service providers including \nTCC.  TCC\u2019s  dominant  ownership  of  TCL  could  undermine  TCL\u2019s  ability \nto  operate \nindependently.  \n \nIn  March  2011,  the  government  therefore  decided  to  turn  TCL  into  a  separate  public \n30. \nenterprise,  and  developed  a  transition  plan  for  the  board  composition  and  management \narrangement. To do so, the government will make available to TCL the grants from ADB and the \nWorld Bank against the issuance of shares in the capital of TCL pursuant to the proposed share \npurchase  agreement.  TCL  will  use  the  grants  to  procure  the  submarine  cable  system.  As  a \nresult,  the  government  will  own  approximately  80%  of  TCL\u2019s  shares  while  TCC  will  own \napproximately  20%.16 After  the  cable  system  starts  generating  revenue,  but  before  the  project \nimplementation period ends, the government intends to sell 20% of its shares in TCL to private \nsector investors. During the cable system installation period, two TCC board members will also \nserve  on  TCL\u2019s  board.  The  interim  managing  director,  who  also  serves  as  TCC  board \nchairperson,  will  remain.  At  the  end  of  the  installation  period,  TCL  will  submit  for  cabinet \napproval its application to become a public enterprise in accordance with the Public Enterprises \nAct  2002,  as  amended.  Pursuant  to  this  Act,  a  new  board  will  be  appointed  and  a  new \nmanagement will be recruited under a competitive and transparent process.  \n \n31. \nA  governance  risk  assessment  has  been  completed  in  accordance  with  the  Second \nGovernance and Anticorruption Action Plan.17 Separate financial and procurement assessments \nby  the  World  Bank  concluded  that  the  overall  risk  of  the  project  is  medium,  but  it  can  be \nmitigated to low through capacity development of TCL in procurement, close monitoring of the \nprocurement  process  by  ADB  and  the  World  Bank,  direct  payment  to  the  contractor,  and \nquarterly  financial  statement  reviews.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended to date) \nwas  explained  to  and  discussed  with  MFNP  and  TCL.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n\n32. \nAbsolute or extreme poverty is rare in Tonga.  Poverty and hardship mainly means lack \nof opportunity for cash income and access to quality education and health services. In addition \nto the efforts to encourage private sector business activities, technical and vocational education \nand  training  is  a  priority  for  the  government  to  prepare  its  young  population  to  be  a  more \n                                                \n16 The share purchase agreement will value the shares in TCL at nominal value, which means that the actual ratio of \nshareholding will be adjusted once the actual value of the cable system contract (and, therefore, the government \ncontribution) is known. \n\n17 ADB.  2006.

Internet  penetration  is  about  20%,  with  the  highest  rate  in  Nuku\u2019alofa \n(32%). Rural areas of Tongatapu and other islands have penetration of 18%. Across all island \ngroups, female users (55%) outnumbered male users. Lowering the cost of internet service can \ncreate  new  job  opportunities,  enhance  education  and  health  services,  and  increase  available \nknowledge for the economy.  A competitive market structure has brought an increase in internet \npenetration  in  the  rural  areas  of  Tongatapu  and  other  islands,  and  lower  cost  international \nconnectivity through the submarine cable will accelerate the service expansion. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n33. \nEnvironment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples  impacts were assessed \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). Proposed cable laying and minor \ncivil  works  will  not  result  in  any  significant  adverse  environmental  impact,  and  all  potential \nenvironmental  impacts  can  be  adequately  mitigated  and  monitored.  An  initial  environmental \nexamination,  incorporating  an  environmental  management  and  monitoring  plan,  has  been \nprepared  for  each  stage  of  the  project. 18  The  government  and  World  Bank  assessment \nprocedures  are  compatible  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  requirements.  The  project \nhas  incorporated  additional  strengthening  of  TCL\u2019s  capacity  to  monitor  compliance  of  the \nenvironmental management plan. The project is categorized environmental category B. \n \nThe project does not involve any land acquisition, and no indigenous people issues have \n34. \nbeen identified. Potential impacts on fishing and oyster aquaculture will be avoided while laying \nthe cable. In case any project activity unavoidably involves such impacts during implementation, \nthe  project  will  follow  the  resettlement  framework  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  and  World  Bank\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement.19 The  project  is  categorized \ninvoluntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples  category  C.  The  safeguard  documents  have \nbeen endorsed by the government and posted on TCL and ADB websites.    \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n35.
