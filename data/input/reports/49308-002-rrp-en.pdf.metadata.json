The report also describes proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA) for Support for the Guangxi Modern Technical and Vocational Education \nand  Training  Development,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA.1 \n \n2. \nThe program will provide, in 2017\u20132022, timely and essential support for the establishment \nof a technical and vocational education and training (TVET) system that provides graduates with \nbetter employment opportunities in  industries in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (GZAR) \nby  enhancing  the  industry  relevance  of  TVET,  improving  the  quality  of  TVET,  increasing  the \ninclusiveness of TVET, and expanding the role of TVET in regional economic development.2 The \nproposed results-based lending (RBL) program is critical for GZAR to implement a comprehensive \nTVET system reform package with a focus on results and system improvements, in accordance \nwith  the  GZAR\u2019s  Thirteenth  Five-Year  Plan,  2016\u20132020,  which  is  in  the  second  year  of \nimplementation.  It  is  expected  to  create  strong  synergetic  effects,  together  with  the  Guangxi \nRegional  Cooperation  and  Integration  Promotion  Investment  Program,  on  cross-border \ncooperation and training, particularly benefiting bordering Viet Nam.3    \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nStrategic Context \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe  economic  structure  of  GZAR  has  undergone  significant  change  since  2000,  with \nprimary  industry  shrinking  and  secondary  industry  expanding,  supported  by  steady  economic \ngrowth.  The  gross  domestic  product  growth  rate  recorded  in  2015  was  8.1%,  higher  than  the \nnational average of 6.9%. Yet GZAR remains one of the poorer provinces, with per capita gross \ndomestic product of CNY37,712, ranking 27th out of 31 provinces. About 9.9% of the population \nis living below the poverty line compared with the national average of 5.2%. A significant part of \nGZAR is mountainous and it has the largest ethnic minority population in the PRC\u2014accounting \nfor 37.1% of GZAR\u2019s total population in 2015. Nevertheless, GZAR\u2019s growth prospects are robust \nbecause of its strategic location, and it aspires to become the PRC\u2019s gateway to the Association \nof Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), a strategic pivot in the opening up and development of the \nwestern and central regions, and an important pathway connecting the Silk Road Economic Belt \nand the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road (Belt and Road Initiative).  \n \n4. \nHowever, concern is growing that shortages of labor, especially skilled labor, constrain the \nsocioeconomic  development  of  GZAR.  With  low  production  costs  and  improvements  in \ninfrastructure,  logistics,  and  transport  systems,  enterprises  in  other  parts  of  the  PRC  started \ninvesting  in  GZAR,  transforming  it  into  a  burgeoning  production  and  processing  base.  As  the \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided program preparatory TA for Guangxi Modern Technical and Vocational \n\nEducation and Training Development Program (TA 9096-PRC). \n\n3   ADB.  2016.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Multitranche \nFinancing Facility to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Guangxi Regional Cooperation and Integration Promotion \nInvestment  Program.  Manila; Government of  the  People\u2019s Republic of  China,  Guangxi  Development and  Reform \nCommission.  2015.  Thirteenth  Five-Year  Plan  on  Guangxi  Zhuang  Autonomous  Region  Economic  and  Social \nDevelopment Plan, 2016\u20132020. Nanning.   \n\n\f2 \n\nGZAR government promotes the development of \u201c14+10\u201d industries (14 key traditional industries \nand 10 emerging and strategic industries that require intermediate- and high-level skills) for the \nThirteenth  Five-Year  Plan  period,  2016\u20132020,  skilled  labor  shortages  are  becoming  acute. 4 \nAlthough TVET has been a source of skilled labor supply, students typically do not opt for TVET \nin GZAR because of its poor relevance and quality.5 Dropout rates at secondary TVET schools in \nGZAR are high. Completion and employment data indicate that not all TVET students graduate \nwith  the  necessary  competencies  in  the  areas  in  which  they  were  trained  (67%  in  2016). \nConsequently,  even  though  about  95%  of  TVET  graduates  are  guaranteed  employment  in \nindustries  nearby  upon  graduation,  over  half  of  them  (51%  in  2016)  leave  their  first  job  within \n6 months.  \n  \n5. \nThe  underlying  issue  is  the  poor  relevance  and  quality  of  TVET.  The  TVET  system  in \nGZAR, comprising 313 secondary TVET schools, 36 tertiary TVET colleges, and 12 application-\noriented  universities,  is  under-resourced  and  supply-driven. 6  Course  offerings  at  TVET \ninstitutions, the teaching and learning environment and materials, and practical training facilities \ndo not adequately match the economic structure of GZAR, and TVET provision is not well aligned \nwith  the  needs  of  GZAR\u2019s  priority  industries.  Although  school\u2013enterprise  cooperation  has \nincreased,  the  involvement  of  employers  and  industry  in  the  development  of  curriculum  and \ntraining  materials,  establishment  of  practical  training facilities,  and  delivery  of  practical  training \nhas been largely ineffective without clearly defined competencies required for graduates, which \nreduces the relevance of TVET.  \n \n6. \nMoreover, TVET institutions, especially secondary TVET schools in rural counties, lag in \nquality, and no system is in place to ensure consistent quality across TVET institutions. As the \nPRC  does  not  have  a  national  qualifications  framework,  provincial  education  departments  are \nexpected to develop detailed quality standards for TVET institutions in line with strategic directions \nset  by  the  Ministry  of  Education  for  quality  assurance.  Qualified  teachers  are  in  short  supply, \nresulting in high student\u2013teacher ratios and low proportions of technical teachers with a teaching \nlicense and industry experience.  \n \n7. \nSuch  poor  relevance  and quality  of  TVET  have  been  the main  cause  of  dropouts  from \nsecondary TVET schools, followed by financial difficulties faced by students from poor families. \nThis  has  negative  impacts  on  poverty  reduction,  since  the  percentage  of  students  from  poor \nfamilies is as high as 80% in some TVET institutions, and dropouts often end up with low paying, \nunstable,  and  vulnerable  employment.  Although  GZAR  is  one  of  the  five  ethnic  minority \nautonomous regions in the PRC, TVET has not contributed much to promote and rejuvenate its \nrich  ethnic  culture  and  traditions.  Additionally,  despite  its  strategic  location,  exchanges  and \nregional cooperation activities between TVET institutions in GZAR and ASEAN countries have \nbeen limited in scope and effectiveness, lacking a long-term strategy to encourage cross-border \ntrade and investment, and technology transfer.  \n \n\n                                                \n4  \u201c14+10\u201d industries refer to 14 industries with an annual output value of over CNY100 billion each (food; automobile; \npetrochemical; electric power; nonferrous metal; metallurgy; machinery; building materials; paper making; electronic \ninformation; pharmaceutical manufacturing; textile clothing and leather; biology; and ship building, repair, and ocean \nengineering equipment) and 10 emerging and strategic industries (new materials; new energy; energy-saving and \nenvironmental protection; marine economy; biopharmaceutical; new information technology; new energy vehicles; \nbiological agriculture; advanced equipment manufacturing; and regimen, longevity, and health).  \n5   In 2015 the average years of schooling for people aged 15\u201364 years old in GZAR was 8.60 years. \n6   Application-oriented  means  having  engineering  and  applied  science  specializations,  and  practical  training \n\norientation.  \n\n \n\n\ftechnology,                        \n\nincluding \n\n(i)  use  of \n\nProgram Rationale \n\ninformation  and  communication \n\nTo establish a modern TVET system, the GZAR government  issued the GZAR Modern \n8. \nTVET  System  Development  Plan,  2015\u20132020  and  associated  10  implementation  plans.  The            \n10  implementation  plans  cover  priority  areas  identified  in  the  GZAR  Modern  TVET  System \nDevelopment  Plan, \n(ii) infrastructure development, (iii) quality improvement, (iv) enhancement of technical teachers\u2019 \nindustry  experience,  (v) increase  in  courses  of  study  and practical  training facilities in GZAR\u2019s \npriority industries, (vi) TVET group development, (vii) TVET park development, (viii) use of TVET \nto support poverty alleviation, (ix) ethnic culture inheritance and innovation, and (x) regional and \ninternational cooperation.   \n \nB. \n \nThe program builds on the experience of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other \n9. \ndevelopment  partners  with lending  and nonlending  operations  for TVET,  including  RBL,  in the \nPRC, and will support the implementation of the GZAR Modern TVET System Development Plan.7 \nLessons have been reflected in the program, including the importance of sustained incremental \nadjustments and improvements to the existing system based on national and international good \npractices,  rather  than  introducing  new  practices  in  a  fragmented  manner,  and  the  need  for \ninstitutional mechanisms to engage industries in TVET. The program is aligned with two of the \nstrategic  priorities  set  out  in  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  the  PRC,  2016\u20132020: \nsupporting inclusive economic growth, and promoting regional cooperation and integration.8  \n \n10. \nThe  use  of  the  RBL  modality  is  proposed  for  the  program  because  the  wide  range  of \ninterventions  required  to  establish  a  modern  TVET  system  needs  a  clear  focus  on  overall \nresults\u2014increased TVET graduates who entered stable employment in GZAR\u2019s industries\u2014and \nsystem improvements, rather than a limited number of discrete interventions designed for specific \nTVET  institutions.  The  program  will  involve  265  public  TVET  institutions  spread  across \n14 municipalities of GZAR, which would be difficult if the conventional investment lending modality \nwere  used.  RBL has the  potential to expand  the  development  impact  of ADB  financing,  which \naccounts for only 2.5% of the total program financing (Table 4). The GZAR government has strong \nownership of  the  program,  and  demonstrates  deep  commitment  to results-based  planning  and \nmanagement as opportunities for system improvements and institutional capacity development. \nRBL  also  provides  a  platform  for  development  coordination,  relying  on  sector-wide  and \nprogrammatic  approaches.  ADB  and  German  development  cooperation  through  KfW  will \ncofinance  the  program  based  on  a  common  program  results  framework,  disbursement-linked \nindicator (DLI) matrix, program action plan (PAP), and program implementation document.9 Due \ndiligence assessments provide assurance for effective achievement of results through RBL, with \nmeasures to strengthen government plans and program systems built into the program design.  \n \n11. \nADB\u2019s involvement in the government program will add value by (i) facilitating access to \nknowledge, expertise, and national and international good practice in quality assurance, industry \npartnership, and skills and knowledge transfer cooperation between TVET institutions in GZAR \n\n                                                \n7  ADB. 2015.

The outcome will be a TVET system that provides \ngraduates  with  better  employment  opportunities  in  GZAR\u2019s  industries  established.  TVET \ngraduates  who  entered  stable  employment  will  increase  (DLI  1),  as  will  those  with  dual \ncertification,  i.e.,  certificates  issued by the  (i) TVET institution,  and  (ii)  authorized  occupational \nskills  assessment  and  certification  agency.  The  program  will  have \nfour  outputs.  \n \n14. \nOutput  1:  Industry  relevance  of  technical  and  vocational  education  and  training \nenhanced. The program will provide support for industry steering committees to improve TVET \nprovision based on industry needs (DLI 2). It will also support, on a pilot basis, new methods of \nengaging industries in defining competencies and developing curriculum, training materials and \nmethods, and assessments to increase courses of study being offered using competency-based \ntraining (DLI 3). The methods pilot tested will be evaluated to explore the possibility of scaling up. \nThe  program  will  assist  the  establishment  of  practical  training  facilities  in  GZAR\u2019s  priority \nindustries, in cooperation with enterprises (DLI 4). Modern apprenticeship programs being pilot \ntested by three tertiary TVET colleges will be scaled up. TVET groups will be strengthened as a \nmechanism for promoting partnerships between TVET institutions, enterprises, and industries.11  \n \nOutput 2: Quality of technical and vocational education and training improved. The \n15. \nprogram  will  support  TVET  institutions,  especially  at  the  secondary  level,  in  undertaking  self-\nimprovement projects to meet comprehensive provincial standards for model TVET institutions. \nThe  provincial  standards  cover  the teaching  and learning  environment  and materials,  practical \ntraining  facilities,  teachers,  the  relevance  and  quality  of  course  offerings,  and  employment \noutcomes (DLI 5). The program will also improve student\u2013teacher ratios, especially in secondary \nTVET, by recruiting more teachers and providing various opportunities for training. Concurrently, \nit  will  support  the  introduction  of  a  new  policy  and  framework  to  increase  full-time  teachers  in \ntechnical  fields  with  industry  experience  (DLI  6).  The  delivery  of  TVET  will  be  informed  by \nimproved monitoring and reporting of TVET institutions in a phased manner, following both the \nnational and provincial guidelines for improved monitoring and reporting and based on the Ministry \nof Education\u2019s information system (DLI 7).  \n \n16. \nOutput  3:  Inclusiveness  of  technical  and  vocational  education  and  training \nincreased. The program will reduce dropouts through improvements in the relevance and quality \nof  TVET.  In  addition  to  the  PRC  and  GZAR  governments\u2019  poverty  alleviation  programs,  TVET \nstudents  from  poor  families  receiving  financial  assistance  will  be  provided  with  other  types  of \nsupport  (e.g.,  counseling,  career  guidance,  employment  services)  to  complete  TVET  and  find \nemployment or self-employment after graduation. The program will support the establishment of \nTVET bases to promote ethnic culture inheritance and innovation.12  \n \n17. \nOutput  4:  Role  of  technical  and  vocational  education  and  training  in  regional \neconomic  development  expanded.  The  program  will  support  regional  cooperation  and \nintegration in TVET between GZAR and ASEAN countries by promoting partnership agreements \nfor  long-term  cooperation  between  TVET  institutions  and  enterprises  in  GZAR  and  ASEAN \ncountries, and increasing the number of participants in partnership training and other cross-border \n\n                                                \n11  TVET groups comprise TVET institutions that offer similar courses of study in an industry, enterprises operating in \n\nthe industry, and research institutes.  \n\n12  It aims to develop new generations of successors of ethnic culture and traditions (e.g., Chinese medicines, traditional \n\nfolk crafts, ethnic art, food, and architecture) to prevent them from disappearing and rejuvenate them.   \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\ftraining  programs  between  TVET  institutions  and  enterprises  in  GZAR  and  ASEAN  countries \n(DLI 8). It will also increase the number of students from ASEAN countries who receive vocational \neducation certificates from TVET institutions in GZAR.  \n \nTo focus on the main elements of a modern TVET system, eight DLIs have been selected. \n18. \nLarge portions of ADB financing will be allocated to DLIs 1, 4, and 5. An increased number of \nTVET graduates who attain stable employment is the key outcome of any modern TVET system \n(DLI 1). By the end of the program, the percentage of TVET graduates who stay in their first job \nfor more than 6 months will increase from 49% to 54% (about 74,500 graduates over the program \nperiod). This indicates an improved TVET system that has established mechanisms for producing \nTVET graduates with competencies relevant to employers. Enhancing practical training facilities \nin  GZAR\u2019s  priority  industries  (DLI  4)  is  indispensable  in  addressing  the  increasingly  acute \nshortages of skilled labor, while raising the number of TVET institutions that meet comprehensive \nstandards for model TVET institutions is essential for ensuring the quality of TVET (DLI 5).

Disbursement  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements \nagreed between the government and ADB. The loan proceeds will be disbursed to a dedicated \naccount  to  be  opened  by  the  government  based  on  the  verified  achievement  of  DLIs.  The \ngovernment  will  ensure  that  the  total  program  expenditures  exceed  the  total  loan  amount \nwithdrawn. Advance financing is allowed to address financing requirements. The government will \nrefund  any  advance  financing  amount  outstanding  if  DLIs  are  not  achieved.  The  outstanding \nadvance will not exceed the ceiling of 25% of the loan amount. Financing of prior results achieved \nnot more than 12 months before loan signing is allowed to support the government in initiating \nactions required to achieve the first year\u2019s DLIs. The total amount of such financing will not exceed \n\n                                                \n13 Tertiary  TVET  institutions  sometimes  seek  loans  from  commercial  banks  if  they  cannot  obtain  funds  from  the \n\ngovernment.   \n\n14  Financial sustainability analysis confirmed that the government can provide funds if needed (para. 26).  \n15  ADB and KfW signed a cofinancing memorandum of understanding on 5 May 2017. KfW received an official request \n\nfor the loan from the government on 23 June 2017.  \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nTechnical Assistance \n\nCapacity Development and Program Action Plan \n\n20% of the loan amount. The combined outstanding balance of advance financing and amount of \nfinancing for prior results must not exceed 30% of total ADB financing. Partial disbursements are \nallowed for DLIs 4 and 6 upon achievement of agreed percentages of the target values, because \nthe DLI targets require efforts of all the TVET institutions rather than a limited number of TVET \ninstitutions in GZAR, and are difficult to achieve. Disbursements are also allowed for early or late \nachievement of DLIs. Before the disbursement of loan proceeds, GED will prepare and submit, \nthrough  Guangxi  Finance  Department,  a  withdrawal  application,  along  with  evidence  verifying \nachievement of the DLIs in accordance with the verification protocols.  \n \nF. \n \n23. \nThe program will strengthen the capacity of the TVET system in GZAR to develop and \nimplement key interventions related to model TVET institutions; practical and in-company training \nmechanisms for TVET teachers; monitoring and reporting of TVET institutions; industry steering \ncommittees;  industry  partnerships  in  the  definition  of  competencies  and  development  of \ncurriculum, training materials and methods, and assessment; modern apprenticeship programs \nand  TVET  groups;  and  cooperation  between  TVET  institutions  and  enterprises  in  GZAR  and \nASEAN countries. It will also improve monitoring and evaluation (M&E), fiduciary, and safeguards \nsystems, as well as gender and social inclusion. Capacity development activities are in the PAP.16   \n \nG. \n \nTA is attached to the program.17 The TA is estimated to cost $700,000, of which $600,000 \n24. \nwill  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-other \nsources).  The  TA  will  have  four  outputs:  (i)  mechanisms  for  ensuring  the  quality  of  TVET               \n(e.g.,  monitoring  and  reporting  of  TVET  institutions,  practical  and  in-company  training \narrangements  for  TVET  teachers)  improved;  (ii)  measures  to  strengthen  TVET  groups  and \nmodern  apprenticeship  programs  developed;  (iii)  new  cooperation  models  between  TVET \ninstitutions and enterprises in GZAR and ASEAN countries developed; and (iv) capacity of TVET \nadministration to provide guidance and supervision for TVET institutions and manage the program \nstrengthened by establishing systems for managing and monitoring environment, resettlement, \nand  social  impacts;  and  improving  operating  procedures,  financial  management,  and  M&E. \nIndependent third-party verification of DLIs will be performed, and baseline and follow-up surveys \nfor an impact evaluation study will be conducted under the TA. GED is the executing agency. The \ngovernment  will  support  the  TA  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office  and  meeting  space, \ncoordination  support,  data,  information,  and  other  in-kind  contributions.  The  TA  will  be \nimplemented upon approval of the loan until 31 December 2022.  \n \nH. \n \nThe GZAR government is the executing agency. Through ADB-financed multicomponent \n25. \nurban development projects and two ongoing TVET projects, it has developed and demonstrated \nsolid capacity to manage and implement challenging projects. GED is the principal implementing \nagency and will implement the program through its program management office. A leading group \nfor  the  utilization  of  foreign  loans,  comprising  Guangxi  Finance  Department,  Guangxi \nDevelopment  and  Reform  Commission,  GED,  and  other  departments  with  responsibilities  for \nTVET  institutions,  has  been  established  to  provide  strategic  guidance  and  direction  in \nimplementing  the  program.

The program \nwas assessed as financially sustainable, since the GZAR government reports revenue surplus \nannually, and TVET budget accounts for only about 2% of the GZAR government revenue.   \n \n27. \nEconomic benefits of the program include (i) higher wages expected for graduates owing \nto  the  improved  relevance  and  quality  of  TVET,  and  (ii)  wage  differentials  between  unskilled \nworkers and additional numbers of graduates who have been prevented from dropping out or who \nhave chosen TVET over work because of financial assistance and other types of support provided \nfor students from poor families. The program is deemed economically viable, with an economic \ninternal  rate  of  return  at  11.16%.  It  has  a  strong  poverty  focus,  as  TVET  enrolls  a  higher \npercentage  of  students  from  poor  families,  disadvantaged  backgrounds,  and  rural  areas  than \nacademic education because of its lower entry requirements and affordability. Gender analysis \nrevealed that girls tend to perform better academically than boys and enroll less in TVET than \nacademic  education;  and  female  teachers  generally  enjoy  fewer  opportunities  for  training, \npromotion, and managerial responsibilities. The program is designed with some gender elements. \nSpecific  gender  targets  and  actions  for  teacher  and  manager  training,  students  who  receive \npoverty-related subsidies, and students from ASEAN countries who receive vocational education \ncertificates have been included in the PAP.  \n \nB. \n \n28.  Monitoring and evaluation systems. Assessment of the M&E system found that it has \nthe potential to generate most of the information required to monitor the program. The following \nweaknesses  were  identified:  (i)  information  on  some  indicators  rely  on  self-reporting  by  TVET \ninstitutions, which could compromise quality and accuracy; (ii) lack of socioeconomic information \nto assess the impacts of TVET; (iii) limited availability of data disaggregated by sex, ethnicity, and \npoverty  status  at  GED;  (iv)  limited  availability  of  data  on  application-oriented  universities \nsegregated from those on academic colleges and universities; and (v) fragmented data collection \nand reporting mechanisms for skills and knowledge transfer activities between TVET institutions \nand enterprises in GZAR and ASEAN countries. The PAP contains actions to strengthen GED\u2019s \nM&E systems.   \n \n\nProgram Systems Assessments \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fFiduciary  systems.  The  program  will  use  the  country\u2019s  program  systems  for  financial \n29. \nmanagement,  procurement,  and  anticorruption.  Financial  management  assessment  confirmed \nthat the GZAR government and TVET institutions have adequate financial management systems, \nand staff capacity was found to be relatively strong. Weaknesses identified include inadequate \nstaff  capacity  for  internal  audit  at  GED  and  TVET  institutions,  and  generally  lower  financial \nmanagement capacity at county TVET institutions. Procurement assessment concluded that the \nprocurement  framework  is  aligned  with  the  principles  of  competition,  efficiency,  economy, \ntransparency,  fairness,  and  equal  opportunities.  Weaknesses  found  include  lack  of  qualified \nprocurement staff and training opportunities, and a lack of technical skills at TVET institutions to \nprepare technical specifications and cost estimates. Procurement involving high-value contracts \nwill  be  excluded  from  ADB  financing. 18  Actions  to  strengthen  financial  management  and \nprocurement systems have been included in the PAP and attached TA. The Guidelines to Prevent \nor  Mitigate  Fraud,  Corruption,  and  Other  Prohibited  Activities  in  Results-Based  Lending  for \nPrograms were explained to and discussed with the PRC and the GZAR governments.19 \n \n30. \nSafeguard  systems.  The  program  is  categorized  B  for  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples  safeguards.  Outputs  1  and  2  will  involve  civil  works  on \nexisting  campuses  or  reserved  lands  that  may  have  some  temporary  and  site-specific \nenvironmental  impacts, and potential  involuntary  resettlement  impacts.  Any  physical  activity  of \nthe  program  that  may  be  classified  category  A  for  the  ADB  environment  and  involuntary \nresettlement safeguards is excluded from the program scope. Output 3 will support students from \npoor ethnic minority families and ethnic culture inheritance and innovation. Gaps identified include \n(i)  inadequate  disclosure  of  environmental  monitoring  reports  and  public  engagement  during \nconstruction,  and  some  difference  in  categorization  criteria  for  civil  works  and  related \nenvironmental impact assessment requirements; (ii) on involuntary resettlement safeguards, lack \nof  identification  of  the  poor  and  vulnerable  groups  during  the  screening  process,  lack  of \ndocumentation  of  the  consultation  and  information  disclosure  activities,  and  grievances \nreceived, and inadequate institutional arrangements, monitoring, and reporting arrangements; \nand  (iii)  lack  of  an  effective  monitoring  and  reporting  system  to  analyze  the  performance  of \nstudents from ethnic minority groups other than the Zhuang. Actions to address safeguard system \ngaps have been identified in the PAP and included in the attached TA.  \n \nC. \n \n31.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5.
