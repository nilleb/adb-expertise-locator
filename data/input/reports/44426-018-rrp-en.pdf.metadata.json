About  300  million  citizens  have  no  access  to  electricity, \nwhile  some  areas  face  daily  power  outages  because  of  supply  shortages  and  transmission \nbottlenecks.4 The  government  is  scaling  up  investments  in  the  generation,  transmission,  and \ndistribution subsectors to address these issues. India is also promoting increased use of clean \nrenewable  energy,  universal  electricity  access,  and  energy  self-sufficiency  by  supplementing \nconventional power-generation sources (oil, gas, and coal). This includes ambitious renewable \nenergy  targets  in  the  electricity-generation  mix.  As  of  31  July  2015,  India  had  an  installed \ngenerating  capacity  of  275.9  GW,  of  which  36.5  GW  was  renewable  energy.5 In  2015,  the \nMinistry  of  New  and  Renewable  Energy  (MNRE)  announced  state-level  renewable  energy-\ncapacity targets for 2022 with a national aggregate of 175 GW. About 90% will come from solar \nand wind sources.6 \n \nGreen  Energy  Corridor  initiative.  In  2012,  MNRE  and  the  Forum  of  Regulators 7 \n4. \ncommissioned  POWERGRID  to  conduct  a  green  energy  corridor  study  to  identify  nationwide \ntransmission investments required to accommodate the additional renewable energy-generation \ncapacity. 8  Almost  60%  of  this  renewable  energy  capacity  is  located  in  six  states\u2014Andhra \nPradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, and Tamil Nadu. To facilitate the transfer \nof power from these renewable energy-rich states to others, as well as address the absorption \n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n2   Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2015.

Report on  Green  Energy  Corridors\u2013Transmission  Plan  for  Envisaged  Renewable  Capacity. \n\nGurgaon.  \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nof  power  and  the  intermittency  and  timing  differences  of  renewable  energy,  POWERGRID \nidentified  $7  billion  in  investments to  be  undertaken  in  phases,  starting under  the Twelfth  Five \nYear  Plan.  These  include  (i)  intrastate  transmission  investments  of  about  $3.6  billion  within \nrenewable energy-rich states and (ii) phased interstate investments of more than $3.4 billion to \nenable power flows across states over long distances. \n \n5. \nExpanded interregional connectivity.  India\u2019s national transmission grid is divided into \nfive  regions. 9  Synchronous  interconnectivity  previously  existed  only  between  the  northern, \nregions.  On  31  December  2013,  POWERGRID \neastern,  western,  and  northeastern \ncommissioned  an  interconnection  between  the  southern  and  western  regions,  which  enabled \nsynchronous  operation  of  an  interconnected  national  power  grid. This  not  only  augmented the \ninterregional  power  transfer  capacity  of  southern  states,  but  also  relieved  congestion  in  some \ntransmission corridors. Southern states, including Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu, \nhave been particularly troubled by power shortages. A more resilient regional and interregional \ngrid  is  essential  in  facilitating  power  transfers  among  states  and  regions.  Furthermore,  daily \npeak power demand does not occur simultaneously in all regions. One state or region may have \na  power  surplus  while  another  faces  a  deficit.  Hence,  an  integrated  national  grid  facilitates  (i) \npower  transfers from  areas  with  a  surplus  to those  with a  deficit, (ii)  optimization of  the  power \nsystem by integrating the electricity market and encouraging power trading, and (iii) competitive \nelectricity  prices  and  improved  power  supply  mix  through  greater  use  of  renewable  energy. \nInterregional power transfer capacity as of 31 December 2014 was 46.5 GW and is envisaged \nto increase to 72.3 GW by 2017.10  \n \n6. \nBorrower.  POWERGRID,  India\u2019s  national  power  transmission  company,  is  responsible \nfor  planning,  developing,  and  operating  the  high-voltage  interstate  and  interregional  power \ntransmission  network. 11  POWERGRID  operates  about  90%  of  the  country\u2019s  interstate  and \ninterregional \n(km)  of \ntransmission  lines  and  197  transmission  substations  with  a  transformation  capacity  of  about \n239,424 megavolt-amperes  as of 31 July 2015\u2014and provides nondiscriminatory open access \nto its transmission system for any licensed utility or generating company.12 POWERGRID has a \nsound  implementation  record  in  upgrading  and  strengthening  the  national  high-voltage \ntransmission  network,  with  consistently  good  operational  performance  as  evidenced  by \ntransmission network availability of above 99% for the past 5 years.  \n \n7. \nProject  design.  POWERGRID\u2019s  immediate  investment  plans  consist  of  the  Green \nEnergy  Corridor  initiative\u2019s  interstate  portions,  including  a  high-capacity  transmission  corridor \nconnecting  major  renewable  energy  pockets  from  Gujarat  in  the  western  region  through \nRajasthan  to  Punjab  state  in  the  northern  region.  This  project  will  fund  a  portion  of  these \ninterstate investments, consisting of two 765 kV alternating current transmission lines, one 400 \nkV  alternating  current  transmission  line,  and  one  765/400  kV  substation  in  Rajasthan  state \nconnecting  to  a  765/400  kV  substation  in  Punjab  state,  including  a  real-time  system  for \nmeasuring  and  monitoring  power  flows.  Other  portions  of  the  initiative  are  funded  by  German \ndevelopment cooperation through KfW for \u20ac500 million (about $556 million equivalent) that will \nbe recognized through a memorandum of understanding as parallel collaborative cofinancing.13 \n                                                \n9  The five regions are the northern, eastern, southern, western, and northeastern regions. \n10 Government of India, Ministry of Power. Creation of a National Grid. New Delhi.           \n    (http://powermin.nic.in/transmission-0) \n11 As of 30 June 2015, the Government of India owned 57.9% of POWERGRID, which makes the company majority \n\ntransmission  networks\u2014consisting  of  117,679  circuit  kilometers \n\nstate-owned and therefore a public sector undertaking. \n\n12 POWERGRID. Our Network.  \n\nhttp://www.powergridindia.com/_layouts/PowerGrid/User/ContentPage.aspx?PId=80&LangID=English. \n\n13 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f3 \n \n\nA separate project component will further increase interregional transmission capacity between \nthe  western  and  the  southern  regional  grids  as  part  of  a  high-priority  HVDC  transmission  link, \nsince the southern region has an 11.3% overall deficit and a 19.8% peak power deficit, while the \nwestern region  is  in surplus. The  envisaged  southern  region generation-capacity  additions  are \nnot  sufficient,  and  increased  transmission  capacity  is  therefore  required.  This  component \nconsists of two 800 kV HVDC terminals\u2014one in Chhattisgarh (western region) and the other in \nTamil  Nadu  (southern  region)\u2014and  two  320  kV  HVDC  terminals  connecting  Kerala  and  Tamil \nNadu.  This  will  expand  western\u2013southern  interconnectivity  from  10  GW  to  16  GW  between \nChhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu, and the portion between Tamil Nadu and Kerala will have 2 GW \ncapacity.  The  adoption  of  HVDC  transmission  technology  improves  power  transfer  efficiency \nand  reduces  transmission  losses  over  long  distances.  It  is  thus  a  least-cost  solution  and  low-\ncarbon investment option well suited for high-capacity interregional power transfers.  \n \n8. \nAlignment  with  ADB  strategy  and  operations.    Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nsupport for the Green Energy Corridor initiative and financing transmission networks to increase \ninterregional  power  flows  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020  and  Energy  Policy14 which \nadvocate  the  promotion  of  renewable  energy,  increased  energy  efficiency,  improved  energy \nsecurity, and facilitation of the country\u2019s transition to a low-carbon economy. It is also consistent \nwith  India  country  partnership  strategy,  2013\u2013201715 which  supports  (i)  clean  and  renewable \nenergy  expansion;  (ii)  enhanced  energy  efficiency;  (iii)  promotion  of  advanced  high-voltage \ntransmission technology, including HVDC transmission lines to increase transmission efficiency; \nand (iv) grid integration of renewable energy.  \n \n9. \nSince  1995,  the  ADB  has  provided  POWERGRID  seven  sovereign-guaranteed  loans \nand  one  nonsovereign  operation  (NSO)  loan  to  strengthen  its  transmission  system  nationally. \nThe projects have a good implementation history and high ratings. Among these, ADB provided \ntwo  loan  facilities  in  2011  consisting  of  an  NSO  loan  and  a  sovereign-guaranteed  loan  in  a \nsingle financing package.16 The NSO loan represented POWERGRID\u2019s first transaction without \nsovereign support, and helped POWERGRID diversify its financing sources.  \n \nB. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance  \n\nRenewable  energy-based  power  generation  is  still  more  expensive  than  conventional \n10. \ncoal-fired  power  generation  in  India  and  poses  an  additional  cost  burden  due  to  its  power \nintermittency.  The  government\u2019s  intervention  through  the  Electricity  Act,  2003,  the  National \nAction Plan on Climate Change, and the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission has created \nthe necessary legal and regulatory frameworks and incentives to attract private investments into \nthe  sector,  thereby  capturing  the  environmental  benefits  of  renewable  energy  projects. \nHowever,  the  public  sector  is  responsible  for  ensuring  timely  investments  in  transmission \nnetworks to  allow  for  increased  renewable energy  penetration.  In this  context,  POWERGRID\u2019s \nnear-term  funding  needs  for  the  interstate  green  energy  corridor  exceed  $3.4  billion,  whereas \nenhanced  overall  interregional  connectivity\u2014critical  not  just  for  renewable  energy  but  for  bulk \npower  evacuation  and  power  sector  optimization\u2014will  require  a  further  $10  billion. 17  The \nprevious  ADB  sovereign  and  NSO  loans  helped  POWERGRID  diversify  its  funding  sources. \n                                                \n14 ADB.  2008.

New Delhi. http://powermin.nic.in/overview-\n\n1 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nPOWERGRID will continue to access all available sources, including domestic and international \nbanks,  capital  markets,  and  multilateral  and  other  development  financial  institutions,  including \nADB,  to fund its  capital  investment  plans.  To  maintain affordability,  POWERGRID  must  match \nits  funding  sources\u2019  tenors  more  closely  to  the  transmission  assets  it  constructs,  owns,  and \noperates, which have 35-year cost recovery periods inherent in transmission tariff regulations.  \n \n11. \nADB\u2019s  assistance  thus  plays  an  important  role  in  financing  India\u2019s  power  transmission \ncomponents that are critical in achieving the government\u2019s renewable energy targets, as well as \nincreasing  overall  interregional  interconnection  capacity.  Without  this,  (i)  significant  additional \ngeneration  capacity  cannot  be  transferred,  (ii)  renewable  and  conventional  energy  project \nbankability  becomes  a  challenge,  (iii)  power  trading  will  not  expand,  and  (iv)  continued \nincreases in access to affordable power  will not materialize. The proposed loans are attractive \nto  POWERGRID  because  (i)  the  sovereign  loan  provides  long-term,  low-cost  financing  that \nhelps keep  transmission  tariffs  at reasonable levels,  while the  additional financing provided by \nthe  NSO  loan  at  attractive  terms  also  includes  a  long  tenor;  (ii)  ADB\u2019s  presence  on  both  the \nsovereign  and  NSO  side  provides  comfort  to  potential  commercial  cofinanciers  and  risk \nparticipants; and (iii) ADB has the ability to deliver multisource financing and hybrid solutions to \ncompanies  like  POWERGRID  by  accessing  the  combined  knowledge  and  experience  of  its \nregional, country, and private sector operations. \n \nC. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n12. \nThe  impact  will  be  increased  overall  efficiency  of  the  Indian  power  system,  expanded \naccess to  electricity,  increased  private  investment  in renewable energy,  and  enhanced  energy \nsecurity in India. The outcome will be improved and more reliable transmission system capacity \nin the northern, western, and southern regions of India. \n \nD. \n\nOutputs \n\n13. \n\nThese will be achieved by 2020 through the following outputs:  \n(i)  Green energy corridor system expansion in the northern region: \n\n(a)  765 kV double circuit transmission line from Ajmer to Bikaner (263 km); \n(b)  765 kV double circuit transmission line from Bikaner to Moga (366 km); \n(c)  400 kV double circuit (Quad) transmission line from Bikaner (new substation) to \n\nBikaner (existing substation)  (26 km); \n\n(d)  765/400 kV substation with 2x1500 megavolt-ampere transformers at Bikaner; \n(e)  extensions of the existing Ajmer and Moga substations by adding two line bays \n\nto each; and \nreal-time measurement and monitoring equipment. \n\n(f) \n\n(ii)  Transmission \n\ninterconnection  capacity  expansion  between \n\nthe  western  and \n\nsouthern regions: \n(a) \n\n800 kV HVDC terminal stations at Raigarh in Chhattisgarh and Pugalur in \nTamil Nadu; and \n320 kV voltage source converter HVDC terminal stations at Pugalur inTamil \nNadu; and North Trichur in Kerala. \n\n(b) \n\n \nE. \n \n14. \n \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $2,581.3 million (Table 1). \n\n\f5 \n \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\n \n\nAmount  \n\nGreen energy corridor (ADB-funded portion of interstate) \nWestern\u2013southern HVDC interconnection terminals \nSubtotal (A) \n\nBase Costa \n1.  \n2.  \n \nContingenciesb \nFinancing Charges During Implementationc \nTotal (A+B+C) \n \n\nItem \nA.  \n \n \n \nB.  \nC.  \n \nNote: Numbers may not sum precisely due to rounding. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, HVDC = high-voltage direct current. \na  In mid-2015 prices.

POWERGRID\u2019s  green \nenergy  corridor  study  (footnote  8)  identified  the  required  investments  and  estimated  capital \nexpenditure to ensure adequate capacity and system reliability to meet India\u2019s demand growth. \nThe  Ministry  of  New  and  Renewable  Energy,  the  Forum  of  Regulators,  and  the  Central \nElectricity  Authority  reviewed  data  from  state  transmission  utilities  and  the  Central  Electricity \nRegulatory  Commission.  The  study  also  included  power  demand  projections  taken  from  the \n18th Electric Power Survey (2013) of the Central Electricity Authority.  \n \n20. \nThe  800  kV  HVDC  transmission  system  is  state-of-the-art,  commercially  proven \ntechnology, and is the most cost-effective means of transmitting bulk power over long distances. \nFor  high-capacity,  point-to-point  transmission,  HVDC  is  economically  preferable  for  system \nlengths  exceeding  700\u2013800  km.  The  project  will  enhance  energy  efficiency  by  reducing \ntransmission  losses  to  about  3%  below  levels  of  typical  conventional  alternating  current \ntransmission systems. Screening for climate risks was conducted, and risks were assessed as \nlow. Such risks are considered in the project design.  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n21. \nThe project\u2019s financial internal rate of return, calculated on a real basis, is 5.76%\u2014higher \nthan  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  3.66%\u2014and  remains  as  such  in  the  various \nadverse sensitivity scenarios.19 Its economic internal rate of return is estimated to be 16.60%,20 \nhigher  than  the  social  discount  rate  of  10%.  The  project  is  thus  financially  viable  and \neconomically sustainable. \n \n22. \nThe  government  has  awarded  POWERGRID  \u201cNavratna\u201d  status,  which  gives  public \nsector  undertakings  a  degree  of  managerial  and  financial  autonomy  despite  their  majority-\ngovernment ownership. 21 POWERGRID maintains an international long-term issue credit rating \nof  BBB\u2013  (Outlook:  Stable)  from  both  Standard  &  Poor\u2019s  and  FitchRatings,  and  enjoys  the \nhighest  domestic  credit  rating  of  AAA. 22 Based  on  the  cost-plus  nature  of  the  tariff-setting \nprocess  coupled  with  its  operating  efficiency,  POWERGRID  has  increased  revenues  and  net \nprofits  consistently,  maintaining  a  robust  financial  position  with  stable  cash  flows  to  cover  its \ncosts,  capital  investment,  and  debt  payments.  Over  the  past  3  years,  it  achieved  a  post-tax \nreturn  on  net  worth  of  more  than  10.0%  and  an  average  debt  service  coverage  ratio  of  1.5 \n                                                \n19 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The nominal financial internal rate \n\nof return is 10.72%, higher than the nominal weighted average cost of capital of 7.78%. \n\n20 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 Navratna-status public sector undertakings may invest up to the lesser of (i) Rs10 billion or (ii) 15% of net worth on \n\na single project or 30% of net worth in a single year, without having to seek the government\u2019s permission. \n\n22 Since  2001,  POWERGRID\u2019s  domestic  bonds  have  been  rated  AAA  by  the  Credit  Rating  Information  Services  of \nIndia Limited and AAA by the Investment Information and Credit Rating Agency of India Limited. Since 2008, Credit \nAnalysis and Research has also given these bonds an AAA rating. \n\n\f7 \n \ntimes. In FY2015, the return on net worth rose to 13.1%23 and the debt service coverage ratio \nimproved  to  2.0  times.24 POWERGRID\u2019s  debt\u2013to\u2013equity  ratio  has  remained  at  about  70:30. \nAlthough  POWERGRID  has  an  aggressive  investment  plan  and  a  large  need  for  additional \nborrowings,  financial  projections  show  it  has  a  sound  financial  position  even  under  stress \nscenarios. \n\n \nGovernance \n\nC. \n\nAs  a  publicly  listed  company,  POWERGRID  is  subject  to  several  strong  governance \n23. \nmeasures  imposed  by  India\u2019s  Securities  and  Exchange  Board,  which  enhance  accountability, \ntransparency,  and  predictability  of  its  financial  governance  through  information  disclosure  to \nshareholders,  investment  professionals,  and  the  public.  POWERGRID  has  an  advanced \naccounting system using computerization with confidentiality and integrity at various levels. The \nfinancial management risk is thus low.

The \nproject  will  avoid  or  minimize  negative  impacts  on  affected  people.25 Social  design  features \ninclude (i) compensation for loss of crops and trees at market value, (ii) additional assistance for \naffected  vulnerable  households,  and  (iii)  equal  opportunities  to  access  employment  and  equal \npay for men and women under civil works contracts. \n \nE. \n \nThe  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  environment,  category  B  for  involuntary \n25. \nresettlement, and category C for indigenous people. In accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009), the project\u2019s potential environmental and social impacts and risks have been \nidentified. Measures to avoid, mitigate, and compensate for adverse environmental impacts are \nincorporated  in  the  initial  environmental  examination,  which  includes  the  environmental \nmanagement  plan.26 Environmental  impacts  of  transmission  lines  can  be  minimized  by  careful \nroute  selection.  One  of  the  lines  passes  through  about  0.7  km  of  degraded  forest  land. \nCompensatory  afforestation  required  by  the  government  to  offset  this  impact  is  budgeted. \nPrivate  land  will  be  required  for  the  HVDC  terminal  in  Pugalur,  Tamil  Nadu,  and  is  being \nacquired  on  a  willing-buyer,  willing-seller  basis  and  through  negotiated  settlement. 27  The \nremaining  substations  are  on  government  or  POWERGRID-owned  land.  Due  diligence  has \nconfirmed there are no encroachers or informal settlers and that the land is  free of claims and \ndisputes.  For  the  transmission  towers  and  lines,  impacts  are  temporary  and  will  occur  during \n\n                                                \n23 POWERGRID. 2015.
