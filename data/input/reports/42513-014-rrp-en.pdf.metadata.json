It  will  involve \nupgrading  of  identified  state  highways  to  two-  and  four-  lane  widths  with  paved  shoulders, \ndepending  on traffic  requirements,  and  reconstruction,  widening,  and  strengthening  of  culverts \nand bridges. Contracts will be based on a hybrid-annuity model with a 7-year annuity period, post-\nconstruction  (para.  8). The project  will  carry  out  a road safety  audit  to  identify  critical  accident \nspots  across  state  highways  on  the  CRN,  and  implement  suitable measures  to  improve these \naccident spots. The project will also strengthen institutional capacity and efficiency in Karnataka \nPublic Works, Ports, and Inland Water Transport Department (KPWD). \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nState context. Karnataka state in southwest India has an area of about 192,000 km2 and \n3. \na  population  of  about  64  million.1 Economically,  Karnataka  is  one  of  India\u2019s  better-performing \nstates\u2014the per capita net income is about 50% above the national average, and grew at over \n10% per year during fiscal year (FY) 2012 - FY2016. 2 The population density is lower than the \nnational average, and the sex ratio (number of females to males) is 968 per 1,000 males, vs. the \nnational average of 940.3 The unemployment and poverty rates are also lower than the national \naverages,  and  the  state receives substantial foreign direct  investment (third-highest  nationally, \nafter the National Capital Region and Maharashtra). \n \n4. \nTransport network. The state\u2019s topography, particularly the terrain along the western hill \nranges,  makes  the  road  network  a  critical  element  of  the  transport  infrastructure.  Consultants \nsupported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) technical assistance for the Karnataka State \nHighway  Network  Improvement  Strategy  completed  a  study  identifying  the  CRN,  which  totals \nabout 24,000 km.4 In comparison to the road network, the state\u2019s rail network is sparse, with only \nabout 3,000 route km, most of which is single line. East\u2013west rail connectivity is limited to one \nline\u2014from  Hassan  in  the  hinterland  to  Mangalore  on  the  west  coast\u2014emphasizing  the \ndependence on the road network.  \n \nGovernment strategy. Although economic development in Karnataka has been stronger \n5. \nthan the national average, it has also been uneven, being focused around the capital region of \nBengaluru and Mysuru, and the coastal towns of Mangaluru and Udupi. Karnataka\u2019s road network \nserves to link the rural and urban economies. In its state road policy (2009), the Government of \nKarnataka  (GOK)  recognizes  the  importance  of  road  development  as  an  engine  of  economic \ngrowth, and proposed developing all state highways to a two-lane width.5 GOK has used various \nmeans\u2014including  financing  through  the  state  budget,  public\u2013private  partnerships  (PPPs),  the \n                                                \n1  Government of Karnataka (GOK), Directorate of Economics and Statistics.

Karnataka Road Sector Policy (2009). Bengaluru. \n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nWorld Bank, and ADB\u2014to improve state roads. The first project financed by a multilateral agency \nwas approved by the World Bank in 2001.6 The second project is ongoing, and comprises a loan \nfrom ADB approved in 2010 and a loan from the World Bank approved in 2011.7 Further details \nof the road sector in Karnataka are given in the Summary Sector Assessment.8 The government\u2019s \nkey  objective  is  to  upgrade  the  capacity  and  condition  of  the  state  highway  system,  improve \nmaintenance, and increase road safety. Achieving these goals also requires that the state build \nthe institutional capacity of the road agencies for planning, preparing, and implementing projects. \n \nRoad institutions. KPWD is the main GOK institution responsible for state roads. The \n6. \nKarnataka Road Development Corporation, Ltd. established KPWD in 1999 to promote surface \ninfrastructure by taking up specific road works and bridges, and take up projects with PPPs. In \naddition,  a  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  for  the  Karnataka  State  Highways  Improvement \nProject (footnote 6) was established to undertake projects financed by multilateral agencies. The \nPIU, acting on behalf of GOK, will implement the present project. \n \n7. \nPriority  road  corridors.  The  government\u2019s  strategy  calls  for  state  highways  to  be \nimproved to at least a two- or four-lane standard, depending on traffic. The CRN study initially \nprioritized roads across the state. The PIU subsequently commissioned a prefeasibility study to \ncategorize and prioritize projects in the CRN. Based on these studies, the PIU identified nine key \nroad corridors, portions of which could be taken up for upgrading on a priority basis. The corridors \nwere chosen based on economic returns, connectivity to industrial and tourist centers, and other \ncriteria. A feasibility study further assessed these roads and chose specific priority road sections, \nfollowing which consultants recruited by the PIU prepared detailed project reports for these roads, \nwhich have now been proposed to ADB for financing. \n \n8. \nValue  added  by  ADB  assistance.  The  project  will  continue  and  strengthen  ADB \nengagement in the state and benefit the state\u2019s road program with continuity and consistency. \nThe continued contribution by ADB to the development of the state\u2019s roads sector will increase \ninclusiveness by improving access to markets and basic services. The project is in line with the \nobjective in the ADB country partnership strategy for India, 2018\u20132022 regarding development of \nthe  state  CRN,  with  the  objective  of  increased,  more  efficient,  and  sustainable  movement  of \npeople  and  goods. 9 ADB  would  also  add  value  through  the  proposed  use  of  hybrid-annuity \ncontracts to improve the sustainability of capital investments. Under hybrid-annuity contracts, 75% \nof the project cost would be paid to the contractor on a milestone basis during construction. The \nbalance of the project cost and the cost of maintenance would be paid in specified semiannual \npayments over a period of 7 years following completion of construction. This approach shifts from \ntraditional construction contracts to contracts focused on output delivery and sustainable asset \nmaintenance. ADB participation will give comfort to the private sector with regards to the reliability \nof  the  contract  regime  and  encourage  partial  private  financing  of  construction.  The  project  will \nalso conduct a road safety audit on all CRN state highways, and implement measures to improve \nidentified accident black spots to improve road safety. KPWD field and headquarters units are \nmanaging road projects of increasing scale, leading the government to improve KPWD\u2019s quality \nmonitoring and management systems, including its environment management systems. ADB will \nsupport  the  assessment  and  process  requirements  for  KPWD  offices  to  attain  conformity  with \n                                                \n6   World Bank. 2001.

At least 419 km of state highways will be upgraded \n10. \nunder  hybrid-annuity  contracts,  designed  to  standard  specifications  of  two  lanes  with  paved \nshoulders  or  four  lanes,  depending  on  traffic  volumes.  These  contracts  will  include  7-year \nperformance-based maintenance obligations. \n \nOutput 2: Road safety measures on state highways installed. Road safety audits will \n11. \nbe  conducted  on  all  state highways  in the  CRN to identify  critical  accident spots,  with  suitable \nmeasures implemented to improve these accident spots. \n \n12. \nOutput 3: Institutional capacity and efficiency of the Karnataka Public Works, Ports, \nand  Inland  Water  Transport  Department  improved.  ISO  9001:2015  and  ISO  14001:2015 \ncertifications will be processed for the division and subdivision levels in KPWD across Karnataka. \nFor the project, a public response system and a complaint handling mechanism will be instituted. \n \nD. \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plans \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $655 million (Table 1).13 \n\n13. \n \n14.

The financing plans are made on the assumptions, discussed in detail with PIU \nand KPWD, that 75% of the estimated project cost would be met by ADB financing, and the balance of 25% would \nbe through hybrid annuity contract payments over 7 years, post-construction. \n\n14 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\ncosts. \n\na  Includes  taxes  and  duties  of  about  $27  million.  The  government  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will \nfinance taxes and duties of $27 million by cash contribution for civil works to upgrade state highways and improve \nroad safety. The taxes and duties to be financed by ADB (i) are within the reasonable threshold identified during \nthe country partnership strategy preparation process, (ii) represent only 4% of the investment plan, (iii) apply only \nto ADB-financed expenditures, and (iv) are considered material and relevant to the success of the project. \n\nb  In mid-2017 prices as of January. \nc  Physical  contingencies  computed  at  2%  for  civil  works.

The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The government \nhas requested that repayment will follow the straight-line repayment option. Based on the straight-\nline method, the average loan maturity is 15.25 years, and the maturity premium payable to ADB \nis 0.10% per annum.15 \n \n16.  \nThe  summary  financing  plan  is  in  Table  2.  ADB  will  finance  expenditures  related  to \nimprovement of state highways, procurement, and consulting services (53% of the project cost). \nGOK has allocated counterpart financing for 31% of the cost, and the private sector contractors \nwill contribute 16% through the hybrid annuity contract structure. \n \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \n     Ordinary capital resources (regular loan) \nGovernment of Karnataka \nPrivate sector \n\nTable 2: Summary Financing Plan \nAmount \n($ million) \n \n346.00 \n202.00 \n107.00 \n655.00 \n\nTotal \n\nSources: Government of Karnataka and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nShare of Total \n(%) \n \n53.00 \n31.00 \n16.00 \n100.00 \n\n \n17.

Based on this, the Government of India requested retroactive financing for all \nproject components. Up to 20% of the loan proceeds will be eligible for retroactive financing for \nexpenditures incurred on works, equipment, and consulting services for the project, in accordance \nwith agreed procedures, and during the 12-month period before the signing of the loan agreement. \nThe  government  has  been  informed  that  approval  of  advance  contracting  and  retroactive \nfinancing does not in any way commit ADB to finance the project. \n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nThe PIU has prior experience working with ADB and the World Bank, and the performance \n20. \nhas been satisfactory. However, learning from previous projects indicated that delays in project \nimplementation resulted from (a) finalizing project studies  and procurement after approval; and \n(b) delays in land acquisition. This learning has been incorporated in substantial prior preparation \nfor this project in terms of technical, procurement, and land acquisition related activities. The PIU \nengaged a consortium of consultants to prepare detailed design documents for roads proposed \nfor ADB financing, incorporating requirements of economic, social, and environmental studies. \n \nADB  engaged  a  consortium  of  international  and  national  consultants  under  project \n21. \npreparatory technical assistance to conduct due diligence on various aspects of the project design \nand  financial  structure,  and  to  ensure  that  work  of  the  PIU  consultants  complies  with  ADB \nrequirements. 16 The reviews included technical, environmental and social safeguards; economic \nassessment; procurement; and financial assessment. The engineering designs were prepared to \nimprove  geometry;  address  social  and  environmental  impacts,  including  bypassing  congested \nsettlements;  address  road  safety;  and  minimize  climate  change  risks.  The  key  climate  risk  in \nKarnataka is increased temperature, by an average of 1.8\u00b0C\u20132.2\u00b0C during 2021\u20132050.17 Rainfall \nis expected to decrease over the monsoon season in northeastern and southwestern parts of the \nstate  and  increase  in  others.  To  address  climate  risks  to  the  roads,  several  adaptation \nmeasures\u2014e.g.,  increased  embankment  height,  improved  bridges,  and  increased  longitudinal \nand cross drains\u2014are included in project design. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n22. \nEconomic analysis. The project\u2019s economic evaluation followed the standard practice of \ncomparing life cycle costs in with- and without-project scenarios, using a 9% discount rate and \nthe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  as  decision  criteria  in  accordance  with  ADB \nguidelines.18 The  economic  analysis  was  conducted  using  the  highway  development  model  4 \n(HDM-4), which estimates road agency costs and road user costs to assess the economic viability \nof project roads using input data on traffic, road geometry, pavement structure and condition, road \nmaintenance and improvement costs, and vehicle operating costs. Value added from improved \ntransport links, resulting in new industries and employment, are captured through benefits from \ngenerated traffic. The EIRR of the overall project is estimated to be about 21.4%, and ranges from \n17.7% to 24.4% for the project roads. \n \n23. \nSensitivity  analysis  was  carried  out  to  investigate the  project\u2019s  economic  viability  in the \nface  of  adverse  changes  in  costs,  benefits,  and  key  economic  evaluation  parameters.  The \nfollowing scenarios were assessed: (i) construction cost increased by 20%; (ii) vehicle operating \ncost and travel time savings reduced by 20%; (iii) construction cost increased by 20%, and vehicle \noperating cost and travel time savings reduced by  20%; (iv) a 2-year delay in construction; (v) \nvalue of time decreased by 20%; and (vi) considering carbon dioxide emissions in the analysis. \nThe EIRR of all project roads remains above 9% in all cases, demonstrating the overall robustness \nof the project, which is economically viable with adverse variations in costs and benefits. \n \n\n                                                \n16 ADB. 2014.

Maintenance  norms \n24. \nrequire about $1,500 annually per lane-km for state highways and $1,000 per lane-km for major \ndistrict roads,19 including routine maintenance (35%), periodic maintenance (50%), and special \nmaintenance (15%).20 During FY2016, the budget allocated to KPWD for routine maintenance of \nroads and bridges was about $390 million, of which about $190 million was for the maintenance \nof state highways and major district roads. The annual maintenance requirements in Karnataka \nare  estimated  at  about  $950  million  per  year,  in  line  with  actual  expenditures  for  routine  and \nspecial maintenance. The annual average incremental recurrent costs of the project are otherwise \nestimated to represent about 1.0% of the maintenance budget of KPWD, and it is reasonable to \nexpect that the budget allocated will be sufficient to meet the maintenance costs of the project. In \naddition, the project contracts are on a hybrid-annuity model, and the contracts include 7 years of \npost-construction operation and maintenance that meets key performance targets for the project \nroads.  The  project  thus  promotes sustainable maintenance  of  the  project  roads  by  the  private \nsector, under the supervision of KPWD. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n25. \nInstitutional capacity. The PIU was set up to implement a World Bank project (footnote \n6),  and  has  continued  as  a  special-purpose  entity  to  implement  multilateral  bank  projects. \nAlthough  a  division  of  the KPWD  and  not  an  incorporated  entity, the  PIU  operates  reasonably \nautonomously. It falls under the jurisdiction of the minister for KPWD, and administratively under \nthe KPWD principal secretary. It is headed by a chief project officer from the Indian Administrative \nServices, supported by a project director with a rank of chief engineer. Substantive PIU decisions \nare  made  through  a  two-level  process  involving  a  steering  committee  headed  by  the  KPWD \nprincipal secretary and a project governing board headed by the chief secretary of the state of \nKarnataka. While  the  decision  structure  is  more  complex  and  distributed  than  an  independent \nincorporated entity might be, it has more power than a direct government department would, and \nis  better  suited  to  implementing  multilateral  projects.  The  PIU  has  experience  with  multilateral \nprojects, good technical capacity, and an established decision-making structure. \n \n26. \nFinancial  management.  The  PIU  is  quite  familiar  with  ADB  and  World  Bank \nrequirements.  Fund  flows  are  entirely  through  the  budgetary  process  and  the  government \ntreasury.  All  transactions  are  recorded  by  government  accounting  systems,  and  ultimately \nreflected in the state government accounts. These are subject to statutory audit by the comptroller \nand auditor general (CAG) of India in line with India\u2019s constitutional provisions. Audited accounts \nare  placed  before  the  state  legislature.  In  addition,  transaction  audits  are  also  carried  out \nperiodically  during  the  year  by  the  state  accountant  general  to  ensure  relevant  codes  and \nstandards are conformed with. The PIU also prepares quarterly and annual financial statements \nfor individual multilateral agency projects. A financial management system based on Tally (off-\nthe-shelf accounting software) is used. A firm of chartered accountants has been appointed to \ncarry  out  internal  audit  in  line  with  World  Bank  and  ADB  requirements.  Annual  statements  of \nproject accounts are subject to audit by the accountant general (an arm of the CAG at the state \nlevel) as per the auditing standards promulgated by the CAG. A review of the audits from FY2013 \nto FY2016 indicates no major adverse audit comments. However, an identified weakness is that \nthe financial  oversight  positions  in  the  PIU  (intended to  be  staffed by government  officers)  are \nvacant. Assurances will be included for filling these vacancies prior to project commencement. \nThe financial management risk is rated moderate under the circumstances. \n \n\n                                                \n19 Calculated based on bill of quantities, and 2016 unit rates, and on guidelines from the Indian Road Congress.

The PIU is experienced with procurement and consultant recruitment for \n27. \nADB and World Bank projects, as well as in the use of various forms of PPPs for road projects. \nGoods and works will be procured in accordance with ADB Procurement Guidelines. All hybrid-\nannuity  contracts for roads will  be  procured  through  international  competitive bidding,  using  e-\nprocurement processes. All consulting firms will be recruited in accordance with ADB Guidelines \non  the  Use  of  Consultants  using  quality-  and  cost-based  selection,  with  a  quality\u2013cost  ratio  of \n80:20.  Advance  procurement  actions  for  the  three  works  contracts  packages  commenced  in \nFebruary 2017, while recruitment of the independent engineering consultants (IECs) commenced \nin June 2016. The procurement plan for the project is in the PAM. \n \n28. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  GOK.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nPoverty. The project\u2019s zone of influence includes 12 districts with a population of about \n29. \n28.4 million, living mostly in rural areas. In 2011, 8% to 25% of the population in these districts \nlived in poverty.21 Agriculture, business, and wage labor are the main sources of livelihood in the \nproject area. Most households have access to electricity and piped water, and most (70%\u201390%) \nregularly use public transport (e.g., buses and taxis); although many (15%\u201340%, depending on \ncommunity) own a motorcycle, less than 4% have a private vehicle.  Residents living along the \nroads  indicated  that  the  lack  of  adequate  footpaths,  lighting,  and  blind  curves  were  important \nsafety  hazards,  especially  at  night.  The  project  will  improve  the  safety  of  road  users  and \npedestrians and provide residents, especially the poor and vulnerable, with improved access to \neconomic opportunities and social service facilities, such as government agencies, health centers, \nand schools. An efficient road network linking villages, towns, and cities will provide stronger links \nbetween remote, poor regions, and more developed markets and urban hubs. \n \n30. \nGender.  The  project  is  categorized  as  having  some  gender  elements.  Overall,  gender \nindicators in Karnataka surpass national-level indicators, including the sex ratio (para 3), maternal \nmortality rate (144 per 100,000 births in 2010\u20132012, compared with 178 nationally), and female \nliteracy  rate  (68%,  compared  with  65%  nationally).  During  project  preparation,  women  were \nactively consulted, with 130 women participating in focus group discussions on all roads. These \ninteractions confirmed that most women use public transportation regularly and perceived it as a \nsafe transport mode. Women highlighted the need for safer roads and more frequent and reliable \npublic transportation. Public transportation does not fall under the scope of the project,  but the \nproject will construct bus shelters and waiting areas. Pedestrian- and gender-friendly elements \ninclude: (i) proper signage, marked crossings, footpaths, and bus shelters; (ii) ensuring at least \n40%  of  participants  in  community  awareness  activities  (human  trafficking  and  HIV/AIDS \nprevention,  and  road  safety)  and  consultations  are  women  and  girls;  and  (iii)  monitoring  the \nemployment of women in construction and maintenance activities. \n \n31. \nHIV/AIDS.  The  project  is  expanding  existing  corridors,  and  is  thus  not  expected  to \nsignificantly  increase  the  incidence  of  HIV/AIDS,  sexually  transmitted  infections,  and  human \ntrafficking. However, given that the prevalence of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking in Karnataka \nis high relative to the rest of India, community awareness campaigns on HIV/AIDS and human \ntrafficking  prevention  will  be  carried  out  by  the  resettlement  nongovernment  organizations \n(NGOs), and prevention and assistance programs will be put in place by the contractors for their \n\n                                                \n21 Government  of  Karnataka,  Planning,  Programme  Monitoring  and  Statistics  Department.  Millennium  Development \n\nGoals, Report of Karnataka. 2014. Bengaluru. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fworkers,  in  coordination  with  existing  local  programs.  Karnataka  is  one  of  five  states  with  the \nhighest  HIV/AIDS  prevalence  rate  (0.52  among  adults  aged  15-49  years,  compared  with  a \nnational  average  of  0.27).  Human  trafficking  is  an  important  problem  in  Karnataka,  which  had \n10% of the reported cases in India in 2014. \n \n32. \nRoad safety awareness. Safety features and warning signs are included in the technical \ndesign.  In  addition,  the  project  will  include  a  community  road  safety  awareness  campaign  to \nsensitize  the  communities  and  high-risk  groups  along  the  corridor  about  the  dangers  for \npedestrians and drivers. This will be conducted by the resettlement NGOs. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\n33. \ncategories are as follows. 22  \n  \n34. \nEnvironment  (category  B).  The  project  scope  involves  improvement  of  existing  state \nhighways to standard two-lane width, with some four-lane sections. The project roads do not pass \nthrough  environmentally  sensitive  areas,  and  no  significant  and  irreversible  environmental \nimpacts  are  expected.  Five  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  reports,  including  an \nenvironmental  management  plan  (EMP),  have  been  prepared  for  the  five  project  roads  and \ndisclosed on the ADB website. Approximately 16,000 trees, including 866 considered large and \nold, will be removed. Best efforts (through measures such as eccentric widening) have been made \nto minimize removal of large old trees in the project design. Compensatory afforestation of 68,455 \ntrees will be carried out. Other anticipated environmental impacts during construction entail typical \nroad  construction-related  issues,  such  as  generation  of  dust,  noise,  exhaust,  and  waste  from \nconstruction  and worker  camps;  water  contamination;  occupational  health and safety;  erosion; \nand siltation. Key operational impacts are increased noise levels and safety issues. To address \nthese, noise barriers have been proposed and appropriate road safety features included in the \nproject  design.  Mitigation  measures  to  address  all  construction-  and  operation-related  impacts \nhave been included in the EMPs, which are part of the bidding documents, with implementation \nmandatory for the contractor. The project includes innovative environmental measures such as \nthe use of plastic waste in the bitumen mix in urban road sections, where feasible. Meaningful \nconsultations  have  been  conducted  during  project  preparation,  and  all  concerns  voiced  by \naffected  persons  and  stakeholders  have  been  incorporated  in  the  project  design.  The  existing \ngrievance redress mechanism being used by the PIU will be followed under this project. \n \nInvoluntary resettlement (category A). The project will require the acquisition of 544.63 \n35. \nhectares of land, including 463.58 hectares of private land. A total of 5,684 households (24,224 \npersons) will be affected. Most (75%) of affected households are titleholders, with about 60% of \naffected households below poverty level.  \n \n36. \nThe  project  will  use  direct  purchase  to  acquire  private  land  and  assets  based  on  the \nprovisions of national law and the ADB Safeguard Policy Statement; should negotiations fail, land \nand assets will be acquired in accordance with the same law and policy.23 Resettlement plans \nwere prepared for all five roads and disclosed on the ADB website; they address identified impacts \nand  reflect  lessons  from  previous  projects,  including  measures  to  ensure  compensations  at \nreplacement cost, utility shifting and reconstruction assistance, special measures for vulnerable \n\n                                                \n22  ADB.

The roads do not cross customary or tribal land. The social impact assessment and census \nsurvey  confirmed  that  5.5%  of  affected  households  are  scheduled  tribes,  and  that  these \nhouseholds hold similar occupations and religious beliefs as the wider society. \n \n38. \nImplementation aspects. The PIU EMP implementation unit will oversee implementation \nof project environment safeguards, with support from the implementation support consultant. The \nPIU Social Development and Resettlement Cell has 17 staff and will conduct direct purchase and \nresettlement activities, supported by three NGOs and social experts from the IECs; the latter will \ninclude a team of environmental, resettlement and social development specialists to supervise \nimplementation of the EMP by the contractor and the resettlement plans. Details on safeguard \nimplementation  arrangements  and  key  positions  are  in  the  PAM.  The  PIU  is  familiar  and \nexperienced with international resettlement and environmental standards. An initial coordination \nand training safeguards workshop will be carried out by ADB and the IECs, prior to construction, \nfor PIU staff and the contractors. If required, training will also be conducted during construction. \n \nF.  \n \n39.  Major risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and \nrisk  management  plan.25 The  assessment  categorizes  all  risks  as  moderate  or  low,  with  the \nintegrated benefits and impacts expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nIV.  \n\nASSURANCES  \n\n \n\n \n\nThe  government  and  GOK  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project  shall \n40. \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents.  \n \n41. \nwhich are set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \n \n\nThe government and GOK have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \n\nV.  \n\nRECOMMENDATION  \n\n42. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$346,000,000  to  India  for  the  Karnataka  State  Highways  Improvement  III  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary  capital  resources,  in regular  terms,  with interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  for  a  term  of  25  years, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft loan and project agreements presented to the Board. \n \n \n\n16 November 2017 \n                                                \n24 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n25 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\fImpact the Project is Aligned with \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nMobility and access to economic opportunities improved (Three-Year Action Agenda)a \n\nResults Chain \nOutcome \nRoad transport \nefficiency and safety \nin Karnataka \nimproved \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nData Sources and \nReporting \nMechanisms \n\n \na.\u2013d.
