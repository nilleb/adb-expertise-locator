The  report  also  describes \nproposed  administration  of  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  supporting  the  implementation  of  the \nProgram, and if the Board approves the proposed programmatic approach and policy-based loan, \nI, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. 1\n  \n \n2. \nDuring the  Asian  Development  Bank (ADB)  country  programming mission for  Viet  Nam  in \nMay  2008,  the  Government  of  Viet  Nam  requested  ADB  for  a  microfinance  sector  development \nprogram loan. The requested loan was included in ADB's country operations business plan, 2009\u2013\n2011  for  Viet  Nam2 as  well  as  the  project  preparatory  TA  for  the  program  loan.3\n The  proposed \nprogram will support the government\u2019s policy reform agendas to improve the quality, accessibility, \nefficiency,  and  competitiveness  of  microfinance  in  line  with  the  Viet  Nam  Microfinance \nDevelopment Strategy, 2011\u20132020. The government\u2019s development policy letter is in Appendix 3. \n \nThe  program  will  support  the  development  of  market-oriented  microfinance  to  increase \n3. \naccess to formal financial services for the poor, especially in rural areas. The program will focus on \npolicy  and  regulatory  reforms,  supervisory  capacity  building,  operational  and  institutional \ndevelopment, and financial infrastructure development. Planned policy and regulatory reforms will \nbe  anchored  by  the  integration  of  microfinance  into  the  formal  financial  market,  encouraging \ninvestment in microfinance. Strengthening operational and supervisory capacities will improve the \nsustainability and outreach of microfinance operations. State-owned financial institutions engaged \nin  lending  to  low-income  households  and  microenterprises funded  by  the  government  budget  will \nbe  guided  to  a  reform  aiming  for  self-sustaining  financial  institutions  operating  based  on  market \nprinciples.  Finally,  the  program  seeks  to  develop  financial  infrastructure  supporting  formal \nmicrofinance training, the advocacy of financial literacy on sustainable microfinance and customer \nprotection, and credit information exchange systems.  \n \n\nII.  \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n4. \nMicrofinance as a poverty reduction measure. In Viet Nam, about 72% of the population \nlive in rural areas, where agriculture is the economic mainstay (accounting for 54% of the national \nworkforce) and where 94% of the nation\u2019s poor people reside. The government\u2019s national poverty \nreduction program focuses on modernizing agriculture and value-added agroprocessing, promoting \nnonfarm  household  businesses,  and  increasing employment  opportunities  through geographically \ndispersed  industrialization  and  promoting  small-  and  medium-sized  enterprises.  The  results  have \nbeen remarkable, with poverty reduced from 58% in 1993 to 12% in 2009, and Viet Nam is poised \nto  meet  most  of  its  Millennium  Development  Goals  by  2015.  Among  the  major  constraints  on \nachieving the Goals is the lack of responsive microfinance services. \n \n5. \nFiscal  burden  of  supporting  the  Vietnam  Bank  for  Social  Policies.  The  direct \nintervention of the government in microcredit delivery through the Vietnam Bank for Social Policies \n(VBSP)  has  crowded  out  private  sector  players  and  hampered  the  growth  of  diverse  market-\n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2008. Country Operations Business Plan. Viet Nam, 2009-2011. Manila. \n3  ADB.  2010.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  Preparing  the  Microfinance  Sector \n\nDevelopment Program. Manila (TA 7499-VIE).  \n\n\foriented microfinance providers.4\n This, in turn, has  limited the choices of the vast majority of low-\nincome rural households in accessing a wide range of accommodative financial services including \ncredit, savings, money transfer, and insurance. The VBSP\u2019s state-funded microcredit has marginal \ndirect financial benefit to a borrowing household (estimated at D34,000 per household per month, \nor 0.7% of an average monthly household income) relative to market-based microloans offered by \nprivate  microfinance  providers.  This  cannot  justify  the  increasing  fiscal  burden  that  results  from \nsupporting the VBSP, which was estimated to grow at an annual average rate of 32% from 2003 to \n2009, and stood at D23,580 billion in 2009, or 1.4% of gross domestic product. The fiscal load is \naggravated by population growth, inflation, and a surge in student loans in recent years, expanding \nthe  VBSP's social  policy  lending  financed  through  state-mobilized  funds.  Under  the  program,  the \nDevelopment  Strategy  for  the  VBSP  towards  2020  (drafted  to  help  the  VBSP  become  a \nsustainable market-oriented financial institution) will be approved for implementation. The strategy \nfocuses on institutional reform, improved banking skills, and awareness raising of stakeholders on \nmarket-oriented microfinance.  \n \n6. \nCentral  People\u2019s  Credit  Fund.  The  Central  People\u2019s  Credit  Fund  (CCF)  is  an  apex \ninstitution  for  people\u2019s  credit  funds  (PCFs),  which  are  financial  cooperatives  in  Viet  Nam. \nGovernment ownership of the CCF is unique to Viet Nam; elsewhere, apex institutions are wholly \nowned and managed by member primary cooperatives to support \u201cself-help, mutual assistance and \ndemocratic autonomy in the operation of their cooperatives\u201d5\n As a result, close to 50% of the CCF \nloan  portfolio  is  outside  the  PCF  network,  with  loans  to  state-owned  enterprises,  small-  and \nmedium-sized enterprises, and entities and individuals who are not PCF members. To achieve its \npotential  to  become  an  effective  member-based  cooperative  bank  and  better  serve  its  member \nPCFs,  the  CCF  is  set  to  be  transformed  by  the  government  into  a  cooperative  bank  widely \nsupported by PCFs with adequate institutional and operational capacities. The program will support \ngovernment  efforts  to  promote  greater  PCF  ownership  of  the  CCF  and  strengthen  the  CCF\u2019s \ncapacity to improve its service to PCFs. \n \nPeople\u2019s  credit  funds. There were 1.7 million PCF members as of the end of 2010, with \n7. \nan average of 1,700 members per PCF. Since 1997, the number of PCF members has increased \nat an average annual rate of 1%, and 10% of all national communes are reached. Given that over \n94% of PCFs are more than 10 years old, the overall membership growth is not remarkable. Aside \nfrom the government policy that limits the number of PCFs to one in each commune, the oligarchic \nownership structure of PCFs has hindered growth of new members that could have strengthened \nthe  capital  base  of  PCFs.  Typically,  PCFs  have  less  than  50  core  members  from  higher-income \nhouseholds, who have the exclusive right to be board members. There is a strong incentive to set \nbarriers to entry for new members, thereby securing a higher return on equity for the original core \nmembers.  To  deepen  financial  inclusion  by  utilizing  a  viable  financial  cooperative  system,  the \nprogram will support a recently launched government initiative to improve the governance structure \nand strengthen institutional and operational capacities of PCFs in a cohesive manner.  \n \n8. \nMicrofinance  institutions. The development of microfinance institutions (MFIs) has been \nconstrained  by  the  lack  of  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  necessary  for  establishing  formal \nMFIs.  Since  1991,  only  one  MFI  has  attained  a  membership  of  over  130,000,  two  have  about \n40,000, and three have about 20,000 clients, which in total account for over 60% of the clients of \n                                                \n4  \u201cThe delivery of microfinance services is still widely perceived among government officials and the public as a social \nmission  to  be  financed  and  carried  out  by  the  government  rather  than  as  a  sustainable  financial  business  geared \ntoward  the  poor.\u201d  B.  Nguyen  and  R.  Vogel.  2011.  Rural  and  Microfinance  in  the  Lower  Mekong  Region:  Policies, \nInstitutions, and Market Outcomes. Manila: ADB.

The International Co-operative Alliance. 1995. Statement on the Co-operative Identity. Manchester. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fthe  top  50  MFIs.  To  help  MFIs  grow,  the  government\u2014with  ADB  assistance\u2014has  prepared  the \nlegal  and regulatory framework  to  allow  formal MFIs  to  take  deposits  under  the  prudential  norms \nand license of the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) (para. 11). So far, two leading MFIs\u2014Tinh Thuong \nOne  Member  Limited  Liability  Microfinance  Institution,  commonly  known  as  TYM  and  M7-\nMicrofinance Institution Limited, commonly known as M7\u2013MFI\u2014have been licensed, while several \nothers are applying for a license. Formalization with the SBV\u2019s license will help MFIs improve their \ngovernance structure and strengthen their overall capacity to offer competitive financial services\u2014\nincluding savings and credit products\u2014against the VBSP, PCFs to be supported by a cooperative \nbank  (transformed  from  the  CCF),  and  the  expansion  of  other  credit  institutions  and  banks  into \ninformation technology (IT)-enhanced microfinance operators. The program will further promote the \ngrowth  of  formal  MFIs  through  increased  capacity  building  activities  for  both  operators  and \nregulators. \n \n9. \nGovernment  commitment  to  market-oriented  sector  reform. Recognizing the vital role \nof  microfinance  as  a  potent  tool  to  reduce  poverty,  the  Vietnam  Microfinance  Development \nStrategy,  2011\u20132020  was formulated  with  ADB  assistance6 and  approved by  the  prime minister,7\n \nwith the aim of  \n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nestablishing the legal, policy, regulatory, and supervisory frameworks;  \nstrengthening policy formulation and regulatory and supervisory capacity;  \nincreasing the operational capacity of MFIs;  \nimproving  the  institutional  and  financial  capacities  of  the  VBSP,  and  helping  to \nimplement  its  development  strategy  toward  self-sustaining  and  market-oriented \noperations;  \ndeveloping financial infrastructure including training institutes and credit information \nbureaus; and  \npromoting a national financial literacy campaign.  \n\n(vi) \n\n(v) \n\n \n10. \nThe national microfinance strategy demonstrates government commitment to microfinance \nsector reform, aiming to gradually transform the sector currently dominated by the social protection \nschemes into a robust financial market supported by vibrant operations based on market principles \nto better cater to the diverse needs of clients for safe and accommodative financial services.8 The \ngovernment  has  also  formulated  various  laws  and  regulations  to  support  sector  growth  and \nsustainability,  thus  providing  responsive  financial  services  to  the  poor  and  low-income  market. \nAmong  the  most  significant  landmark  legislation  promulgated  is  the  Credit  Institutions  Law,  2010 \n(CIL), which took effect in January 2011. The CIL, for the first time, recognized microfinance as a \nformal  financial  service,  and  mandates  the  SBV  to  impose  prudential  norms  over  financial \ninstitutions  engaged  in  microfinance.9\n The  CIL  is  also  expected  to  further  broaden,  deepen,  and \nstrengthen the microfinance sector, supporting the national microfinance strategy. The program will \n\n                                                \n6   The  TA  for  Preparing  the  Microfinance  Sector  Development  Program  contributed  to  the  formulation  of  the  national \nmicrofinance  strategy  by  completion  of  a  sector  assessment  and  a  development  plan  and  by  consultation  with \nstakeholders through a workshop.  \n\n7  Prime Minister\u2019s Decision No. 2195/2011/QD-TTg dated 6 December 2011. \n8   Viet Nam Microfinance Development Strategy, 2011\u20132020 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n\n2). \n\n9  Under the CIL, MFIs and cooperative credit institutions comprising cooperative banks and PCFs are placed under the \nsupervision and regulation of the SBV. The CIL also covers policy banks (including the VBSP), which will continue to \nimplement  state  socioeconomic  policies  on  a  not-for-profit  basis  and  will  remain  under  the  organizational  and \noperational control of the government. However, all policy banks are now required to implement internal control and \naudits;  develop  and  issue  internal  procedures  applicable  to  their  operations;  and  adopt  statistical,  operational,  and \npayment activity reports in accordance with stipulations of the SBV.  \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fsupport  the  government  in  implementing  the  national  microfinance  strategy  and  help  formulate \ndetailed implementing rules and regulations (IRRs) of CIL provisions relating to microfinance. \n \n11. \nADB  assistance.  ADB  has  supported  the  government\u2019s  initiative  to  establish  the  formal \nMFI sector with two TA grants supporting the preparation of the microfinance legal framework.10 As \na  result,  in  March  2005,  Decree  No.  28  on  the  organization  and  operation  of  microfinance \ninstitutions  in  Viet  Nam  was  issued,  followed  by  Decree  No.  165  issued  in  November  2007  to \nsupplement Decree No. 28. In 2009, ADB approved a Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) \ngrant11\n to support the implementation of the decrees. The grant provides technical assistance and \nsupplementary  matching  funds  to  assist  the  transformation  of  semiformal  microfinance  programs \ninto  formal  regulated  MFIs.  The  program  is  designed  to  further  support  the  government  in \nformulating  a  policy  and  regulatory  environment  supportive  of  market-oriented  operations  and \nprivate sector innovations. Lessons from past assistance by ADB and other development partners \nto  the  sector  in  Viet  Nam  and  the  region  include  the  importance  of  (i) integrating  microfinance \nregulation  in  general  banking  law  and  harmonizing  it  with  microfinance-specific  regulations  to \npromote fair competition among diverse financial institutions; and (ii) the government focusing on \ncreating  an  enabling  environment  to  support  private  sector  development  in  microfinance  rather \nthan being directly involved in microfinance operations. Both of these aspects were bases used in \ndesigning the program. \n \nLink  to  country  partnership  strategy.  ADB,  in  its  country  partnership  strategy  for  Viet \n12. \nNam 12,  supports  the  Viet  Nam  Socioeconomic  Development  Plan,  2011\u20132015,  which  aims  to \ntransform  the  country  into  a  modern,  productive,  and  equitable  economy.  ADB\u2019s  new  country \npartnership  strategy  will  pursue  inclusive  growth  by  improving  the  poor's  access  to  opportunities \nincluding  infrastructure,  microfinance,  rural  development,  and  social  services,  and  also  economic \nefficiency  through  support  to  economic  restructuring  and  related  reforms  focusing  on  public \ninvestment  planning  and  financial  sector  deepening.  It  is  in  this  context  that  the  program  was \nformulated  to  support  government  efforts  in  improving  the  overall  quality  and  capacity  of \nmicrofinance,  focusing  on  an  improved  policy  and  regulatory  environment,  increased  operational \nand  supervisory  capacities,  and  financial  infrastructure  development  along  with  the  national \nmicrofinance  strategy. The  program  will  address  the  existing  constraints on  nationwide  access  to \nformal  financial  services,  and  thus  (i)  develop  an  equitable  economy  by  promoting  a  robust \nmicrofinance sector with an improved policy and regulatory environment supportive of the growth \nof  private  sector  operations,  (ii)  promote  wide  adoption  of  microfinance  best  practices,  and  (iii) \nincrease  financial  infrastructure  development.  It  will  enhance  financial  inclusion  by  improving \naccess to financial services for traditionally underserved poor households, and supporting inclusive \ngrowth in line with ADB\u2019s financial sector operational plan.13\n \nB. \n \n13. \nThe impact will be greater financial inclusion and a deepened finance sector. The outcome \nwill  be  increased  access  of  poor  women  and  men  to  sustainable  and  affordable  microfinance \nservices. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \n\n                                                \n10 ADB. 2001.

To  support  government  initiatives \ntoward a vibrant microfinance industry in line with the national microfinance strategy and the CIL, \nthe  program  will  seek  to  encourage  diverse  financial  institutions  to  contribute  toward  deepening \nfinancial inclusion. It will finalize the draft IRRs prepared by the SBV to formulate (i) SBV licensing \nrequirements and prudential norms for MFIs based on performance standards, credit classification, \nand provision standards; and (ii) audit and reporting requirements applicable to the VBSP, PCFs, \nand other microfinance operating credit institutions to secure the integrity and transparency of MFI \noperations. The branching guideline has been revised to facilitate the expansion of MFIs' business. \nFurther,  fiscal  incentives  and  regulatory  requirements  for  all  operating  microfinance  credit \ninstitutions will be considered to promote service outreach, especially in rural areas.  \n \n16. \nConsumer safeguard measures will be established, promoted, and ensured by formulating \nIRRs  of  the  CIL  provisions  on  consumer  protection,  which  will  be  disseminated  to  the  public.  In \nresponse to the growing needs for microinsurance, greater involvement of credit institutions in the \nprovision  of  insurance  services/products  is  facilitated  and  promoted  in  a  prudent  manner.  IT-\nenhanced  banking  service  will  be  facilitated  through  the  issuance  of  IRRs  to  reduce  transaction \ncosts and expand access to services for microfinance clients in rural and remote areas. The IRRs \nmay  include  incentives  to  promote  new  entry  into  microfinance  through  e-banking.  To  promote \nnational gender equality targets, licensed MFIs will be required by a newly formulated regulation to \nreport gender-specific client data to the SBV. \n \n17. \nOutput  2:  Strengthening  the  supervisory  and  regulatory  capacities  of  microfinance \nsector  regulators.  Because  the  MFI  license  applications  have  only  recently  emerged,  there  are \nfew qualified regulators to provide effective supervision of the microfinance sector. The SBV needs \nto increase its regulatory capacity, focusing on the special features of microfinance,14 including the \nwidely  accepted  MFI  performance  standards 15  and  proven  best  practices  not  applicable  to \ncommercial  banking  operations.16\n The  lack  of  qualified  regulators  will  be  further  aggravated  as  a \ngrowing  number  of  MFIs  will  be  licensed  and  the  number  of  PCFs  will  increase  in  line  with  the \nexpansion  plan;  1,700  PCFs  are  expected  to  be  operating  by  2020,  increasing  from  the  current \n1,060.  The  program  will  help  the  government  strengthen  the  overall  supervisory  and  regulatory \ncapacity  and  oversight  authority  of  the  SBV  over  microfinance  credit  institutions  and  that  of  the \nMinistry  of  Finance  over \nthe  oversight  agencies\u2019 \nthe  VBSP.  To  effectively  strengthen \nsupervisory/regulatory  capacity,  the  draft  manual  of  supervision  with  performance  standards \nprepared by an ADB project (footnote \n \n18. \nOutput  3:  Strengthening  credit  institutions  involved  in  microfinance  to  provide \naffordable  and  sustainable  services  to  the  poor.

Draft  IRRs  for  ownership  and \ngovernance of PCFs, as well as its banking services to nonmembers, will be formulated to promote \nthe  growth  of  active  member  participation,  especially  from  among  low-income  households.  The \nSBV will finalize IRRs to promote membership expansion of PCFs and effective service delivery. \n \n21. \nOutput 4: Supporting development of the infrastructure for the microfinance sector. \nAs  recognized  credit  institutions  under  the  CIL,  MFIs  and  PCFs  need  core  banking  knowledge \nincluding  basic  banking  principles,  financial  governance,  risk  management,  prudential  standards, \nand IT-enhanced products and services, as well as updated technical know-how on best practices \nfor microfinance and financial cooperative operations. To ensure quality and sustainable capacity \nbuilding  services,  the  program  will  help  the  SBV\u2019s  Banking  Academy18\n establish  a  microfinance \ncenter  to  provide  training,  research,  consultancy,  and  other  services  related  to  the  microfinance \nsector.  Training  modules  will  be  developed  through  capacity  building  needs  analysis,  and  will  be \ndesigned  to  combine  classroom  lectures  with  on-the-job/onsite  practical  training  used  by \nparticipating model credit institutions. Expertise will be drawn from microfinance training institutes \n(both at home and overseas), microfinance operating credit institutions, and other national partners \nto ensure optimum coverage of the knowledge areas required for microfinance operations.  \n \n22. \nThe  VBSP\u2019s  operations  are  conducted  through  savings  and  credit  groups  nationwide \nengaged in savings and credit administration as partners and receiving VBSP services as clients at \nthe  same  time.  A  financial  literacy  program  focusing  on  microfinance  will  be  conducted  for  the \nVBSP  savings  and  credit  groups,  PCFs,  VBSP  and  CCF  management  and  staff,  concerned \ngovernment agencies, and mass organizations. To support reform processes of the VBSP and the \nPCF/CCF  system,  the  financial  literacy  program  will  facilitate  understanding  on  market-oriented \nmicrofinance  and  its  benefits,  clients\u2019  rights  and  responsibilities,  customer  protection,  and  other \nsubjects related to sustainable microfinance. \n \nThere is strong anecdotal evidence of multiple financing of microborrowers in areas where \n23. \nthe VBSP, the Vietnam Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development, PCFs, and MFIs all operate. \nWith  the  VBSP  covering  almost  all  communes,  future  expansion  of  PCFs  and  MFIs  and  the \npossible  entry  of  commercial  banks  into  the  microfinance  market  using  e-banking  will  inevitably \nincrease  the  risks  of  financing  duplication  and  over  indebtedness,  known  as  credit  pollution.  The \nVBSP,  PCFs,  and  MFIs  are  presently  not  providing  microfinance  credit  information  to  the  SBV \nCredit Information Center (CIC), a nationwide credit bureau. Their full participation is made difficult \nby  the  huge  volume  of  microcredit  information  that  cannot  be  captured  by  their  current  systems, \ntheir commune-level operations, and the low level of IT use in their operations. To support effective \nmicrocredit  information  management,  an  IT-based  credit  information  exchange  system  will  be \ndeveloped at the CIC.  \n                                                \n17 SBV Decision No. 6136 issued in 2007. \n18 The Banking Academy was organized in 1961 by the SBV to provide professional training and research in the fields of \n\neconomics, finance, and banking. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fDevelopment Financing Needs  \n\nD. \n \n24. \nThe  program  is  a  programmatic  approach  comprising  two  single-tranche  subprograms. \nSubprogram 1 comprises a single tranche loan of SDR25,919,000 covering April 2008\u2013June 2012. \nSubprogram 2, with an indicative amount of $50 million subject to further discussion between ADB \nand  the  government  and  the  availability  of  Asian  Development  Fund  resources,  will  be \nimplemented for July 2012\u2013September 2014. Subprogram 2 will be submitted for Board approval \nupon completion of the policy triggers. The policy matrix given in Appendix 4 indicates the program \nframework including the government actions taken prior to Board consideration for subprogram 1, \nproposed policy actions for subprogram 2, and medium-term direction.  \n \n25. \nThe government has requested a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR25,919,000 \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance subprogram 1. The loan will have a 24\u2013year \nterm,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  an  interest  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan  agreement.  The  government  will  use  the  local  currency  counterpart  funds  generated  by  the \nloan proceeds to meet program expenditures and associated costs of reform, and will provide the \nnecessary  budget  appropriations  to  finance  the  structural  adjustment  costs  relating  to  the \nimplementation of reforms under the program. \n \n26. \nThe  program  programmatic  approach  will  support  reforms  outlined  in  the  development \npolicy  letter  and  policy  matrix.  The  loan  amount  is  determined  by  the  significance  of  the \nmicrofinance  sector  to  the  overall  economy,  the  expected  development  impact  of  the  policy \npackage, the adjustment costs, and the development financing needs of the government, including \ncosts  for  (i)  developing  the  formal  MFI  sector  to  expand  its  outreach  to  clients;  (ii)  assisting  the \nVBSP  to  achieve  operational  and  financial  self-sustainability  in  line  with  its  development  strategy \ntoward  2020;  (iii) initiating  the  transformation  of  the  CCF  into  a  cooperative  bank  and  the \nrestructuring of the CCF/PCF network into a member-based financial cooperative system; and (iv) \nhelping the Banking Academy establish a microfinance center to provide capacity building services \nto the microfinance sector. \n \nE. \n \nThe  SBV  will  be  the  executing  agency.  It  will  establish  a  steering  committee  to  provide \n27. \ngeneral  policy  direction  and  overall  coordination  for  implementation  of  the  program.  The  steering \ncommittee  will  be  chaired  by  the  SBV  deputy  governor,  with  high  officials  representing  the \nconcerned  stakeholders  including  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  VBSP,  CCF,  CIC  and  the  Banking \nAcademy  as  members.  The  SBV  will  also  establish  a  program  management  unit  to  provide \ntechnical  support  to  the  steering  committee.  The  unit  will  oversee  loan  implementation,  including \ntaking  and  confirming  policy  actions,  coordinating  TA  activities  among  implementing  agencies, \nundertaking  program  administration,  and  communicating  with  ADB  on  behalf  of  the  government. \nThe  implementing  agencies  will  be  Ministry  of  Finance,  VBSP,  CCF,  CIC,  and  the  Banking \nAcademy,  each  of  which  will  be  responsible  for  program  reporting  and  discussing  implementing \nissues with the SBV.

The TA will be financed on a grant basis \nby the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) in the amount of $500,000 and administered by \nADB.  The SBV, the Ministry of Finance, and the CIC will provide counterpart support in the form of \noffice  space,  counterpart  staff,  and  other  support  facilities.    The  TA  will  (i)  support  the \nimplementation of the program by achieving a medium-term reform agenda in microfinance, and (ii) \nprovide the government with policy advice. The TA scope includes: (i) formulation of draft IRRs of \nthe new CIL provisions on microfinance; (ii) the study and recommendation of fiscal and regulatory \nincentives for microfinance operating credit institutions; (iii) the planning, development, and training \nfor a microfinance credit information exchange system at the CIC; and (iv) review and improvement \nof the current insurance regulations to support the development of microinsurance.  \n \nThe executing agency for the TA will be the SBV. The implementing agencies for the TA will \n29. \nbe the SBV, the Ministry of Finance, and the CIC. The TA will begin in September 2012 and will be \nimplemented  over  18 months  ending  in  February  2014. The TA  will  provide  10  person-months of \ninternational  consulting  services  and  12  person-months  of  national  consulting  services.  The \nconsultants  will  work  on  an  intermittent  basis  and  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Disbursements under \nthe  TA  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook \n(2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Equipment  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nProcurement Guidelines  (2010,  as  amended from  time to  time). The TA  expenditures  will  comply \nwith  JFPR  guidelines.  A  full  description  of  the  TA,  including  implementation  arrangements, \nconsultant  terms  and  conditions,  cost  estimates,  and  financing  plan,  is  included  as  a  linked \ndocument.19\n \n\n  \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE  \n\nProgrammatic Approach \n\n \nA. \n \n30. \nThe  mission  team  has  undertaken  a  due  diligence  assessment  in  consultation  with  the \ngovernment  to  evaluate  the  policy  actions  that  could  trigger  subprogram  1.  In  formulating \nsubprogram  2,  the  mission  team  and  consultant  team  will  focus  on  technical  viability,  economic \n\n                                                \n19  Policy and Advisory Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fSafeguards \n\nThe program is classified category C for all safeguard categories (environment, involuntary \n\nand  financial  viability  and  sustainability,  prudential  requirement  and  customer  protection,  poverty \nand social impact, and the safeguard policy aspects.  \n \n31. \nGovernance and anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nwas explained to and discussed with the government and the SBV. The government is  taking an \nactive  approach  against  corruption,  including  the  enactment  of  the  Anti-Corruption  Law,  2005.  \nA legal framework has been established to protect and reward whistle-blowers. \n \nB. \n \n32. \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples).  \n \nC. \n \n33. \nThe  program  is  categorized  as  providing  some  gender  benefits.  Traditionally,  there  has \nbeen  strong  participation  of  women  in  the  Viet  Nam  microfinance  sector;  however,  not  enough \ngender-related data is available. Improved data collection would ensure that microfinance plays a \nsignificant catalytic role in promoting women\u2019s economic empowerment. The program will formulate \nrules and regulations to require licensed MFIs to report sex-disaggregated microfinance client data.  \n \nD. \n \n34. \nThe  program  assumes  political  stability  in  the  country  and  continued  adoption  of  sound \nmacroeconomic  policies.  Despite  the  sound  track  record  of  Viet  Nam,  implementation  of  the \nprogram is still subject to the risks described in Table 2. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nGender \n\nRisk \nExogenous, \ninternational \nfinancial shock \nand \nmacroeconomic \ninstability \nPolitical \nresistance and \nvested interest \nagainst the \nreform \n\nPoor governance \nand corruption \n\n \nTable 2: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nThe government is strengthening its monetary policy framework, expanding the tax \nbase, and strengthening public expenditure management with the assistance of \ndevelopment partners including ADB. ADB and other development partners in Viet Nam, \nincluding the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, hold regular consultative \nmeetings with the government on the macroeconomic policy and the stability and \ndevelopment of the finance sector.  \nThe government has shown strong commitment to the reform agenda. Government \ncommitment is also manifested in the scope of legal and regulatory reforms \nimplemented across the finance sector. The Microfinance Development Program \nreduces this risk by focusing policy actions on a small number of important reforms, \nwhich will have a high impact, with firm and wide support from the government and the \nconcerned stakeholders. \nThe government is increasingly adopting a tougher stance on corruption and has \nrecently taken measures, including enacting the Anti-Corruption Law, 2005 and setting \nup a steering committee against corruption. Results of investigations against corruption \noverseen by the government inspectorate have been disclosed, and a legal framework \nis established to protect and reward whistle-blowers. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\n35. \n The government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to all \napplicable ADB policies  including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, gender, \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fprocurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the loan agreement. \nThe  government  has  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants,  which  are  set  forth  in  the  loan \nagreement. \n\n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n36. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  programmatic  approach  and  policy-based  loan  would \ncomply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the \nabsence of the President, under the provisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, \nI recommend that the Board approve \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\nthe programmatic approach for the Microfinance Development Program, and \nthe loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR25,919,000 to the Socialist Republic \nof  Viet  Nam  for  subprogram  1  of  the  Microfinance  Development  Program,  from \nADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources,  with  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per \nannum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  for  a  term  of  24 \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as \nare  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement \npresented to the Board. \n\n \n \nBindu Lohani \nVice President \n\n13 June 2012 \n \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nAssumptions and \nRisks \nAssumptions \n\nMacroeconomic and \npolitical stability is \nmaintained. \n\nEconomic growth \nremains positive in \n2011\u20132014. \n\nRisk \n\nEffects of external \nshocks are not \naddressed amicably and \nthus affect the overall \neconomy.  \n\nAssumptions \n\nThe government \nremains committed to \nmicrofinance \ndevelopment. \n\nCoordination among \nconcerned government \nagencies is maintained \nfor sector development. \n\nRisk \n\nResistance persists \nagainst reform \nmeasures. \n\nAssumption \n\nAdequate resources are \nallocated for the \nformulation of \nregulations. \n\n \n\nDesign Summary \nImpact \n\n \n\nGreater financial \ninclusion and deepened \nfinance sector  \n\nOutcome \n\nIncreased access of \npoor women and men to \nsustainable and \naffordable microfinance \nservices  \n\nOutputs \n \n1.
