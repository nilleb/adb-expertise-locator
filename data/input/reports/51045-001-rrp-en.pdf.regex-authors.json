I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup  to  $2,500,000  to  Sughdneft  Limited  Liability  Company  (Sughdneft)  for  the  Sughdneft \nExpansion Project in Tajikistan. \n \n2.   The proposed loan will provide long-term US dollar debt that is currently unavailable in \nthe market. Providing a long tenor loan will enable the company to amortize the up-front costs of \nits retail network expansion over longer periods, given the long asset life of the facilities. ADB\u2019s \nparticipation will also support better standards in respect of accounting, transparency, technical \nsafety and environmental and social management systems at Sughdneft. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n1.  Project Identification \n \n3.  Tajikistan has sustained high economic growth since its civil war ended in 1997. Driven \nmainly by agriculture and services, real gross domestic product (GDP) grew by an average of \n7.2% a year during 1997\u20132014.1 The post-conflict recovery was strong, aided by significant \nincreases  in  remittance  inflows  and  a favorable  external  environment,  especially  the  rapid \neconomic development in the Russian Federation. The country moved from low-income to lower \nmiddle-income status in July 2015, and its per capita gross national income (Atlas method) was \n$1,280 in 2015.  \n  \n4.  Despite strong economic results, Tajikistan remains one of the poorest countries in Central \nAsia, with an estimated 29.3% of the population living below the national poverty line in 2016.2 \nHigh  economic  growth  has  not  translated  into  high  private  investment  and  employment \nopportunities. Outputs and exports are constrained by limited production and low value added. \nThe economy has remained largely agrarian, with the agriculture sector absorbing 67% of the \nlabor force, but the sector still suffers from low productivity.  \n \n5.  Remittance-financed consumption is the main source of growth. Remittances have played \na significant role in poverty reduction, but they are dependent on external factors affecting \ncountries hosting Tajik migrant workers, so relying on them to sustain high growth is a significant \nrisk. About 1 million Tajiks work abroad, mostly in the Russian Federation, which provides 95% \nof all remittance inflows.3 Remittances rose from 6.4% of GDP in 2002 to a peak of 49.6% in 2013. \nThey have since fallen to 32.6% of GDP in 2016, as the plunge in the Russian ruble and the sharp \nrecession in the Russian Federation contributed to a 43% decline in remittances in United States \n(US) dollar terms since 2014.4 The decline in remittances also reflects the return of many Tajik \nmigrant workers because of more restrictive laws and continuing recession in the Russian \nFederation. From 2013 to 2016, the number of Tajik migrant workers in the Russian Federation \n                                                \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2016.

Some 333,391 Tajiks have been banned from working in the Russian Federation \nfor up to 5 years. \n  \n6.  Tajikistan has a poor record of providing small and medium-sized enterprises with access \nto finance. In its Doing Business 2017 report,5 the World Bank ranks Tajikistan 118th out of \n190 countries for access to credit, down from 109th in 2016. Since 2014, Tajikistan\u2019s banking \nsystem has recorded losses, and a sharp rise in nonperforming loans has reduced bank capital, \nreducing their appetite to do more business. High interest rates and short loan maturities have \ndiscouraged many small and medium-sized enterprises from undertaking long-term productive \ninvestments\u2014hindering job creation and compounding the economic problems of an already \nfragile economy.  \n \n7.  Further, with more than 70% of loans denominated in foreign currency, businesses bear \nthe risk of currency mismatch. Because of these factors, credit to the private sector dropped by \n13% in 2016. On top of a business slowdown, the depreciation of the somoni by nearly 50% since \nthe beginning of 2015 has resulted in a sharp rise in nonperforming loans, from 29.9% at the end \nof 2015 to 54.7% at the end of September 2016. This resulted in the average ratio of bank capital \nto risk-weighted assets falling to 5.4%, less than half the regulatory requirement of 12.0%. Four \nbanks faced possible insolvency, limiting access to deposits and preventing the timely settlement \nof payments and tax liabilities. To maintain confidence in the banking system, the Government of \nTajikistan recapitalized these four banks in December 2016 at a cost of nearly $500 million, equal \nto 7.1% of GDP. \n \n8.  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  has  been  exploring  opportunities  in \nTajikistan since 2007, and has benefited from reforms undertaken by ADB\u2019s Central and West \nAsia Department\u2014especially work to improve the investment climate by reducing the cost of \ndoing  business,  strengthening  the  protection  of  doing  business,  and  increasing  business \ninnovation  and  productivity.6 ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  has  focused  on \nidentifying projects poised for expansion, which have high potential for job creation. This is based \non (i) the nascent private sector; (ii) the conservative view adopted by local commercial banks, \nwhich only provide working capital and/or short-term loans (stunting long-term investment and \nleading to high opportunity costs, resulting in the loss of jobs and tax revenues); and (iii) the \nincrease in the unemployment rate, as thousands of migrant workers return from the Russian \nFederation. It is within this context that the project was identified.  \n \n9.  Sughdneft is engaged in wholesale and retail operations of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), \npetrol, diesel, oil, and lubricants; and owns and operates six retail fuel stations (RFSs) in the \nSughd province. It plans to expand its retail footprint in the region by adding seven new RFSs and \nassociated petroleum handling and storage facilities, and by increasing its distribution fleet and \nmobile testing labs during the period 2017 \u2013 2021. Sughdneft approached the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) for financial support for its business expansion plan and to provide long-tenor \nfinancing that matches its long-fixed asset life, since only working capital finance or short-term \nloans are available at present, which cannot be used for expansion financing because of the \nasset\u2013liability mismatch. \n \n \n                                                \n5  World Bank.

The project would contribute to ensuring energy security and efficient use of \nenergy which remains a strategic goal of the National Development Strategy.8 \n \n15.  Outcome. The project will have the following outcome: increased availability of fuel in \nSughd province. Sughdneft\u2019s business expansion plan requires new employees for the operation \nof RFSs, and Sughdneft\u2019s business expansion has the potential to create direct jobs, including \njobs for women. \n \n16.  Output. Successful implementation will result in the expansion of fuel distribution capacity \nin the Sughd province. The construction activities for new RFSs will create temporary direct and \nindirect employment opportunities.9 \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n17.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is consistent with \nADB\u2019s  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020,  which  identifies  poverty  reduction  and  inclusive \neconomic growth and infrastructure development as two of the four strategic priorities of ADB \noperations.10 The project is also aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Tajikistan, \n2016\u20132020, which highlights investment climate reforms and skills development to increase \nproductive employment.11 \n \n18.  Consistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The project facilitates \nimproved access to longer tenor financing, which matches the asset life of the company\u2019s \nfacilities. Under a recent country diagnostic study for Tajikistan,12 ADB identified limited access \nto finance and its high costs as the most important factor inhibiting private investment and job \ncreation. The proposed financing will help address some of the challenges to growth identified in \nthe country diagnostic study. \n  \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2003.

THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n22.  ADB will provide a senior secured corporate finance loan of up to $2,500,000 with a tenor \nof up to 7 years, including a grace period of 2 years. The loan will carry an interest rate (as well \nas fees) as determined by ADB\u2019s Investment Committee. (Confidential information redacted). \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance  \n \n23.  ADB\u2019s participation will provide Sughdneft with a long-term US dollar loan currently \nunavailable in the market. In Tajikistan, limited access to finance and high finance costs are major \nconstraints to private investment. Providing Sughdneft with a long tenor loan will enable the \ncompany to amortize the up-front costs of its retail network expansion over longer periods, aligned \nwith the long asset life of the facilities. ADB\u2019s engagement will show case to other companies in \nTajikistan the viability and benefits of such funding thereby stimulating other transactions and \nconsequently economic growth. ADB\u2019s participation will also support better standards in respect \nof accounting, transparency, technical safety and environmental and social management systems \nat Sughdneft. \n \nC.  Risks \n \n24.  (Confidential information redacted). \n \nD.  Technical Assistance \n \n25.  (Confidential information redacted).  \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n26.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified as \ncategory B for environment, and category C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. \nThe requirements for general corporate finance will apply for this project. A compliance audit of \nthe corporate and facility level environmental and social management practices of Sughdneft was \nundertaken by a qualified and experienced external expert. The audit recommended corrective \nactions to ensure that procedures and operations are adequate and comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement and other social requirements. The potential environmental and social impacts ", "  5 \nof the project have been identified and effective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and \ncompensate for the adverse impacts are incorporated in the safeguard reports and plans. \nSughdneft will adopt an ESMS satisfactory to ADB before the first ADB disbursement. Sughdneft \nwill designate qualified environmental and social staff and train staff on the ESMS to enhance \nimplementation of the ESMS. \n \n27.  Environment.  Sughdneft  does  not  have  specific  corporate  codes  for environmental \nmanagement, but follows the requirements of local legislation and ensures compliance with all \nrelevant permissions and authorizations. It also provides safety training for all staff in accordance \nwith regulatory requirements. Impacts associated with the construction of the RFSs are expected \nto be temporary and of short duration, such as increased ambient dust and noise level, waste \ngeneration, vegetation clearing, and risks associated with occupational health and safety. These \ncould be minimized by implementing best practices in construction engineering and planning. \nPotential operational impacts may occur from petrol leaks of underground storage tanks and the \npiping system, which may result in soil and groundwater contamination. Petrol and LPG vapor \nreleases  from  operations  may  form  a  flammable  atmosphere  if  mixed  with  air  in  certain \nproportions,  and  may  result  in  unsafe  conditions  on  RFSs  and  in  nearby  communities. \nInternational  best  practices  and  guidelines  (e.g.,  the  International  Finance  Corporation\u2019s \nEnvironment, Health, and Safety Guidelines for Retail Petroleum Networks)13 will be adopted at \nthe engineering design and operational stages of the project, to minimize potential environmental \nand safety impacts. An oil and water separator will be installed for the new RFSs to achieve the \ndesired water treatment result. The environmental management plan will include monitoring for \nleakage and spillage, emissions, effluent, and occupational hazards. \n \n28.  Involuntary resettlement. Sughdneft\u2019s lands for its current facilities were allocated from \nstate land or through the purchase of land use rights from former land users. The audit found no \noutstanding land issues in Sughdneft\u2019s handling terminal and six RFSs covered by the audit. For \nthe proposed development of new RFSs, Sughdneft will apply to the government for the allocation \nof unencumbered state-owned land plots or purchase existing RFSs from private entities. The \nland procurement for the RFSs is not expected to entail involuntary resettlement impacts. \nSughdneft will conduct the planned land and assets procurement in accordance with the ESMS, \naligned with the requirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement.  \n \n29.  Indigenous peoples. The 2010 census of Tajikistan showed that the country has more \nthan  80  ethnic  groups  (nationalities)\u201484.2%  Tajiks  and  13.9%  Uzbeks,  with  other  ethnic \nnationalities such as Kyrgyz, Russians, Turkmens, and Tatars making up the balance. This \npattern is similar in the Sughd province, where 84% are Tajiks, and the remainder are Uzbeks, \nKyrgyz, Russians, Tatars, Turkmens, and others. All these ethnic nationalities settled in the region \nmany years ago; are fully integrated with the Tajiks; and have the same access to land and natural \nresources, health and education systems, and social security status. The development of new \nRFSs in Sughd province will not have impacts on indigenous peoples. \n \n30.  Other social dimensions. The project is categorized as having no gender elements. \nSughdneft  offers  equal  employment  opportunities  to  men  and  women.  Sughdneft  and  its \ncontractors will comply with national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy \n                                                \n13 International Finance Corporation. 2017.

Information disclosure and consultation \nwith affected people will be conducted in accordance with ADB requirements.15 \n  \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n31.  Sughdneft was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating \nto combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.

Assurances \n \n33.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),16 \nADB  will proceed with the proposed assistance upon establishing that the Government of \nTajikistan has no objection to the proposed assistance to Sughdneft. ADB will enter into suitable \nfinance documentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the \nproposed assistance by the ADB Board of Directors. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n34.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan of up to \n$2,500,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to Sughdneft Limited Liability Company for the \nSughdneft Expansion Project in Tajikistan, with such terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in this report and as may be reported to the Board. \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n13 December 2017 \n                                                \n14 ADB. 2003.
