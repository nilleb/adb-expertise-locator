(IL&FS)\nand Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI).\n\nGuarantor\n\nIndia\n\nProject Description\n\nto \n\nThe proposed Private Sector Infrastructure Facility at State\nLevel  (PSIF  II)  consists  of  two  components  (i)  two\nseparate  loans  to  the  participating  financial  institutions\n(PFIs)  in  equal  amounts  and  on  identical  terms  for\ninfrastructure  projects \nonlending \nspecified\nin \ninfrastructure  sectors \nIndian  states:\nfour  selected \nAndhra  Pradesh,  Gujarat,  Karnataka,  and  Madhya\nPradesh; and (ii) technical assistance to the four selected\nIndian states that will receive PSIF II financing, to enhance\nprivate sector participation in infrastructure development in\ntheir respective states.\n\nin \n\nIncorporated  in  the  PSIF  II  design  are  components  to\naddress  the  key  constraints  of  infrastructure  development\nat the state level in India.\n\nThe  PSIF  II  is  focused  to  provide  assistance  only  to  four\nselected  Indian  states  that  are  generally  considered\nthat  provide  an  environment\nreform-oriented  and \nconducive  to  private  investments.  It  aims  to  demonstrate\nhow constraints at the state level may be addressed based\non  the  collective  experiences  of  these  four  states  and  on\nbest practice. It also aims to underscore state performance\nas  a  key  factor  in  (i)  lending  and  investing  by  financial\ninstitutions  in  India;  (ii)  providing  a  Government  of  India\nguarantee \nlending;  (iii)\nto  enable  performance-based \ncatalyzing  the  flow  of  resources  into  performing  states,\nstarting  with  the  four  selected  states;  and  consequently,\n(iv) establishing an appropriate incentive structure for other\nIndian states to improve performance.\n\nTo  address  identified  gaps  in  capacity  at  the  state  level,\nthe  PSIF  II  seeks  to  partner  national  PFIs  with  state\ngovernments  to  undertake  infrastructure  projects  that\ncould be offered for private sector participation, particularly\nfor  structuring,  developing,  and  engineering  the  financing\nof projects.\n\nTo strengthen the public-private interface and facilitate the\nprocessing  of  infrastructure  projects,  the  PSIF  II  supports\nthe  adoption  of  formal  legislation,  sector  policies  and\nregulatory \nthat  address  private  sector\nformal  structures  with\nconcerns, \nstatutory  mandates  at  the  state  level,  and  operational\nmechanisms for dealing with the private sector.\n\nframeworks \nthe  organization  of \n\n\fSubloans\n\nClassification\n\nEconomic growth\n\nEnvironmental Assessment\n\nRationale\n\niii\n\nFinally,  the  PSIF  II  will  provide  the  anchor  loans,  with\nmaturities that more appropriately fit the long gestation and\npayback periods of infrastructure projects, which pose the\ngreatest  financial  risk  to  these  projects.  Parallel  initiatives\nare  to  be  undertaken  to  meet  related  risks  in  undertaking\nprivate investments in infrastructure projects.\n\nThe  PSIF  II  is  also  targeted  to  support  reform  efforts  in\nidentified  infrastructure  sectors  where  reforms  are  being\nundertaken  by  providing  financing  to  projects  in  these\nsectors,  including  power  transmission  and  distribution\nprojects  for  privatization  and  those  that  may  be  set  up  by\nprivate  sponsors;  modernization  and  upgrading  of  private\npower  generation  plants;  minor  ports  under  private\nconcessions;  state  roads  on  build-own-operate,  build-\noperate-transfer,  and  similar  arrangements;  optic  fiber\ncable connections for privately owned telecommunications\nfacilities;  airports  under  private  management;  urban  mass\ntransit systems that will be privately run; water supply and\nsewerage  services  under  private  concession;  cyberparks;\nand  special  economic  zones  where  private  sector\ncompanies are to operate.\n\nCategory B. Environmental impact assessments or initial\nenvironmental examinations will be undertaken for\nsubloans to be financed.\n\nfor  private \n\nThe  anticipated  demand \ninfrastructure\ninvestments  has  not  materialized  as  few  infrastructure\nprojects  are  reaching  financial  closure.  Several  reasons\naccount for this: (i) reforms have not been progressing as\nfast  as  anticipated,  (ii)  present  governance  structures  are\nnot suited for the broad participation by the private sector\nin infrastructure envisaged in a liberalized environment, (iii)\nthe \nsubstantial\ninterface \nstrengthening,  and  (iv)  it  remains  difficult  to  disaggregate\nand  allocate  risks  in  the  domestic  capital  market.  These\nconstraints are particularly pronounced at the state level.\n\npublic/private \n\nneeds \n\nThe  PSIF  II,  in  its  design,  attempts  to  help  Indian  states\naddress  these  constraints  by  providing  a  policy  and\noperational framework for attracting private participation in\nincentive\ninfrastructure;  establishing  an  appropriate \npenalize\nstructure \nand \nnonperformance; \ninitiatives,\nfinancing  of\naddressing \ninfrastructure projects.\n\nperformance \nthrough \n\nrisks  associated  with \n\nvarious \nthe \n\nreward \nand \n\nto \n\n\fLoan Amount and Terms\n\niv\n\nTwo loans of $100 million each to IL&FS and IDBI will be\nprovided  under  the  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  of  the\nAsian Development Bank (ADB). The loans will have a 20-\nyear term, including a grace period of 5 years; an interest\nrate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB's  LIBOR-based\nlending  facility;  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75  percent  per\nannum; a front end fee of 1.0 percent; conversion options\nthat may be exercised in accordance with the terms of the\ndraft Loan Agreements, the Loan Regulations, and ADB's\nterms  and\nConversion  Guidelines;  and  such  other \nconditions set forth in the draft Loan Agreements.\n\nRelending Terms\n\nAt  prevailing  market \nto\nrates \nsubborrowers.  The  ADB  loans  are  to  be  hedged  against\nforeign exchange risk by the PFIs and  relent in rupees.\n\nrupees \n\nIndian \n\nfor \n\nInstrumentation\n\nThe  PFIs  will  purchase  marketable  securities \nsubborrowers as evidence of their loans.\n\nfrom\n\nUtilization of\n\n            Loan Proceeds\n\nSubloan Size\n\nProcurement\n\nBenefits and Beneficiaries\n\nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  direct  and\nindirect foreign exchange costs of equipment and services,\nincluding  civil  works.  Subject  to  sectoral  limits,  loan\nproceeds may be utilized to finance local currency costs of\neligible  projects.  To  facilitate  the  timely  implementation  of\nprojects,  up  to  10  percent  of  the  loan  proceeds  may  be\nused  to  finance  eligible  expenditures  incurred  180  days\nprior to the date the loans become effective.\n\n25 percent of the total project cost or the single exposure\nlimit  of  the  PFI  whichever  is  lower,  but  in  no  case  to\nexceed a maximum absolute amount of $75 million.\n\nFor  contracts  for  the  supply  and  installation  of  equipment\nvalued  at  $10  million  or  more,  and  for  civil  works  of  $20\nmillion  or  more, \ninternational  competitive  bidding\nprocedures  in  accordance  with  the  ADB  Guidelines for\nProcurement  will  be  followed.  In  the  case  of  a  build-\noperate-transfer  project  and  variants,  the  project  sponsor\nor engineering, procurement, and construction contractor if\nselected  through  competitive  bidding  among  international\nentities in accordance with procedures acceptable to ADB,\nmay  apply  its  own  procedures  for  procurement  provided\nthat  such  procurement  is  for  goods  and  works  supplied\nfrom, or produced by ADB member countries.\n\nto \n\nidentify  and  resolve  gaps \n\nThe  PSIF  II  will  benefit  the  state  sector  by  promoting\nprivate  participation  in  infrastructure  at  the  state  level.  By\nthe  policy\nhelping \nenvironment,  operating \ninstitutional\ncapacity, the PSIF II aims to facilitate infrastructure project\ndevelopment  in  the  four  selected  states.  By  promoting\ninfrastructure development at the state level, the PSIF II is\nensuring  that  appropriate  policies  are  in  place  to  mitigate\n\nin \nframework,  and \n\n\fRisks\n\nv\n\nthe \n\nagainst  the  possible  social  and  environmental  risks  of\nlocal\ninfrastructure  development,  and  protect \npopulation,  particularly  the  affected  segments  of  society.\nThe  PSIF  II  will  catalyze  a  larger  flow  of  resources  to  the\nfour selected states and make much needed infrastructure\nfour  states  have\nservices  more  accessible.  The \nconsiderable  potential  for  industrial  development  that  can\nonly  be  realized  with  adequate  infrastructure  support;  by\nstimulating  economic  growth,  poverty  reduction  will  be\nenhanced.  By  emphasizing  state  performance  as  a  key\nfactor  for  project  financing,  the  PSIF  II  aims  to  promote\nstate reforms by redirecting credit flows to deserving states\nand  by  establishing  an  appropriate  performance  based\nincentive structure. The PSIF II also encourages the cross-\nideas  among  states.  States  are  very\nfertilization  of \ntheir  counterparts  are\nfinding  out  how \ninterested \nin \naddressing \ninfrastructure\nspecific \ndevelopment. Selected states, among themselves, are now\nlearning  from  their  collective  and  individual  experiences\ntheir\nand \ninfrastructure  sectors.  The  Government  of  India  will  also\nbenefit in terms of reduced assistance needed because of\nincreased  private  provision  for  infrastructure,  and  savings\nfrom improved efficiencies arising out of structural reforms\nand    private  sector  management  based  on  commercial\nprinciples.\n\napproaches \n\ndeveloping \n\ninnovative \n\ndifficulties \n\nto \n\nin \n\nLack  of  commitment  and  cooperation  on  the  part  of  the\nselected states could undermine the objectives of the PSIF\nII. However, the four selected states are acutely aware of\nthe need to establish an environment conducive to private\ninvestment and to compete for scarce resources, and have\nbeen  closely  watching \nthe  progress  of  neighboring\ncountries;  thus,  their  relative  advances  in  reforming  their\ninfrastructure\nrespective \ndevelopment.  Furthermore,  the  PSIF  II  is  designed  to\npromote  competition.  States  able  to  develop  suitable\ninfrastructure projects for financing can access the facility.\nThe  four  selected  states  are  also  aware  that  other  Indian\nstates have expressed strong interest in participating in the\nPSIF II.\n\npromoting \n\nstates \n\nand \n\nInfrastructure  projects  typically  have  long  gestation  and\npayback  periods.  Project  preparation  is  difficult  in  the\ncurrent  environment  due  to  the  myriad  agencies  involved\nand  in  dealing  with  cumbersome  procedures.  To  facilitate\nproject  preparation  and  processing, \nis\nsupporting  the  development  of  formal  structures  with\nstatutory  mandates  at  the  state  level  to  deal  with  the\nprivate  sector,  to  essentially  serve  as  one-stop  facilities.\nMoreover, \nto  enhance  project  preparation  and  build\nownership, the PSIF II seeks to partner the PFIs with state\nthe  project\ngovernments.  The  PFIs  could  provide \n\nthe  PSIF \n\nII \n\n\fTechnical Assistance\n\nvi\n\ndevelopment  and  financial  engineering  expertise  required\nto  bring  projects  to  financial  closure.  With  close  state\ngovernment  involvement  and  immediate  feedback  on\nproblems,  project  preparation  is  expected  to  accelerate,\nand  problems  that  arise,  addressed  more  promptly.  Long\npayback  periods,  and  the  uncertainty  associated  with  it,\ncan  be  covered  by  matching  long-term  financing  that  the\nPSIF II will provide. Other risks could be covered through\ninnovative  instruments  that  the  PFIs  will  design  to  meet\nthe  risks  of  infrastructure  financing.  State  guarantees  are\nto be targeted more appropriately to meet noncommercial\nrisks  and  allow  disaggregation  of  risks  and  proper  risk\nallocation in the Indian environment.\n\nin \n\nTechnical  assistance  is  proposed  to  be  provided  to  the\nfour  selected  states  to  assist  them  in  addressing  specific\nthe  enabling\nconstraints \nthe  development  of \nenvironment for private sector participation in infrastructure\nto  make  the  effort  sustainable  and  to  facilitate  the\nprocessing of eligible projects within these selected states\nfor PSIF II financing.\n\nExperts  will  be  fielded  to  identify  priority  areas  in  each\nselected  state  that  require  assistance  and  provide  the\nneeded advisory assistance to enable the selected state to\nmeet  pre-agreed  measures  with  ADB  for  broadening\nprivate sector involvement in infrastructure development.\n\n\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL\n\n1.\nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  Report  and  Recommendation  on  (i)  two\nproposed  loans,  one  to  Infrastructure  Leasing  &  Financial  Services  Limited  (IL&FS),  and  the\nother  to  Industrial  Development  Bank  of  India  (IDBI),  each  to  be  guaranteed  by  India,  for  the\nPrivate Sector Infrastructure Facility at State Level Project (PSIF II); and (ii) proposed technical\nassistance  (TA)  for  Enhancing  Private  Sector  Participation  in  Infrastructure  Development  at\nState Level.\n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n2.\nOngoing  reviews  of  the  development  of  India\u2019s  infrastructure  sectors  and  experience\ngained  under  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)-funded  Private  Sector  Infrastructure  Facility\n(PSIF  I)1,  noted  that  the  private  sector  was  not  responding  as  expected  to  earlier  initiatives.\nConsequently,  as  part  of  an  ADB  TA,2  state  constraints  to  infrastructure  development  and\nfinancing  were  examined  and  possible  ADB  responses  considered.  The  state  focus  was\nappropriate as state governments are fully responsible for reforms that are key to determining\nthe  nature  and  extent  of  state \ninfrastructure\ndevelopment  appears  to  have  stalled  due  to  waning  private  sector  interest  as  difficulties  in\ndeveloping  infrastructure  projects  started  to  emerge.

Consequently, the PSIF I was targeted at\nenhancing financial intermediation and developing the domestic capital market. However, today\nfew  infrastructure  projects  are  actually  materializing,  despite  the  continuing  large  demand  for\ninfrastructure and relative availability of domestic funds.3\n\nThe  February  2001  Reconnaissance  Mission4  examined  possible  approaches  to  assist\n4.\nIndian  states  address  emerging  infrastructure  bottlenecks.  After  consultations  within  India  and\nADB, the Fact-Finding Mission5 was fielded in April 2001. During fact-finding, the measures for\nstrengthening  the  enabling  environment  for  private  sector  participation  in  state  infrastructure\ndevelopment;  the  possible  partnership  arrangements  between  the  selected  states  and\nparticipating  financial  institutions  (PFIs);  and  the  design,  scope,  and  mechanics  of  the  project\nfacility  were  defined  and  discussed  in  detail.  Subsequently,  the  August  2001  Preappraisal\n\n                  \n\n1  Loan  1480-IND:  Private Sector Infrastructure Facility  to ICICI Ltd.

In  connection  with  the  formulation  of  a  suitable\nfinancial sector development strategy for India and as an important aspect of India\u2019s reform priorities, a  review of\nsate-level  constraints  to  infrastructure  finance  and  Asian  Development  Bank  Strategy  was  conducted,  at  the\nsuggestion of the Government of India.\n\n3  Banking  institutions  report  current  holdings  of  some  $2.0  billion  in  excess  statutory  liquidity  reserves.  However,\navailable debt funds in the domestic funds market are short to medium-term in character, ranging from 5 to 7 years.\nMaturities of 10 years and beyond are still rare.\n\n4  The Mission comprised R.

The project framework\nis shown in Appendix 1.\n\nA. \n\nSector Description\n\nIII.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n1. \n\nPrivate Sector Participation in Infrastructure Development\n\n5.\nState  government  finances  deteriorated  throughout  the  1990s.  The  combined  fiscal\ndeficit  of  all  states  in  India  increased  from  2.3  percent  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in\nFY1994  to  4.3  percent  in  FY1999,  and  4.6  percent  in  FY2000;6  but  narrowed  down  to  4.3\npercent  in  FY2001  due  to  a  higher  growth  in  receipts  compared  with  expenditures.  The\noutstanding debt of the states is estimated to exceed 23 percent of GDP in FY2001, from just\n18.6 percent in FY1994. In FY2001, the fiscal deficit of the national Government and the states\ntaken together decreased, but remained high at 9.1 percent from 9.4 percent in FY2000.7\n\ninvestments. \n\ninadequate  public \n\nThis deterioration in fiscal health of state governments over the years directly contributes\n6.\nto \nin  both  public  and  private\ninfrastructure,  on  the  other  hand,  constrain  industrial  growth.  In  particular,  the  failure  of  state\ngovernments to provide basic infrastructure severely undermines the long-term growth potential\nof  the  economy  as  it  is  prevented  from  obtaining  the  full  benefits  of  market  reforms  and\nliberalization. Moreover, with rising deficits, the states are forced to cut back not only on capital\nexpenditures  but  on  expenditures  in  essential  social  sectors,  impacting  on  the  drive  to  reduce\npoverty.\n\ninvestments \n\nInsufficient \n\n7.\nADB has therefore been providing assistance for public sector resource management at\nthe  state  level.8  However,  public  resources  are  clearly  inadequate  for  meeting  infrastructure\nneeds.  Greater  private  sector  participation,  including  foreign  investments,  will  be  needed  if\nIndia\u2019s  targeted  economic  growth  rate  of  8-9  percent  per  year  is  to  be  achieved.  More\nimportantly, well-regulated private management is needed to improve efficiency and productivity\nin \nthe  waste  associated  with\nnoncommercial operation of basic infrastructure services.\n\ninfrastructure  and  eliminate  much  of \n\nthe  provision  of \n\n2. \n\nLimited Response in Provision of Infrastructure\n\nAccounting  for  inflation,  only  about  30  percent  of  projected  financing  for  infrastructure\n8.\nfrom private sources has actually materialized since 1994/95 based on the assessments earlier\n\n                  \n\n6 Despite efforts at fiscal consolidation, the present level of the Government's fiscal deficit is 5.9 percent (7.0 percent\nunder the old definition that includes small savings collections passed on to the states), slightly higher than the 5.6\npercent registered in the previous year.\n\n7 Reserve Bank of India. 2001.

The  World  Bank  has  been  encouraging  fiscal  reform  in  individual  states  (like\nAndhra  Pradesh,  Karnataka,  Orissa,  Rajasthan,  and  Uttar  Pradesh)  and  is  providing  financial  support  for  fiscal\nreform programs now in process in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.\n\n\f3\n\nmade  by  the  Expert  Group  on  the  Commercialisation  of  Infrastructure  Projects  (the  Expert\nGroup).9\n\n9.\nIn the power sector, new generating capacity during the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1992/97)\nfell short of target by almost 50 percent, principally due to inadequate investments by the states.\nOf  this,  independent  power,  including  captive  power,  producers  contributed  barely  1,430\nmegawatt  (MW)  of  the  total  16,422  MW  in  additional  capacity.  The  Ninth  Plan  (1997/2002),\noriginally estimated that 40,425 MW of power would be added with about 44 percent of this to\nbe  privately  produced.  This  has  been  revised  during  the  midterm  review  to  28,097  MW,  and\nfurther, based on a more recent update, to 20,891 MW with the private sector expected to take\nup 32 percent of the capacity augmentation. Under the Ninth Plan up to December 2000, a total\nof  14,227  MW  was  completed  with  the  private  sector  contributing  3,915  MW  (about  27.5\nimmediately  preceding  year,  FY1999/2000,  private  sector\npercent).  However, \nparticipation declined sharply with only 553 MW added by private producers. Under the 10th and\n11th plan periods, the Central Electricity Authority projects capacity augmentation of 55,000 MW\nand 51,500 MW, of which the private sector is expected to take up about 40 percent.\n\nthe \n\nin \n\n10.\nSimilarly,  for  the  road  sector,  only  $3.2  billion  has  been  provided  for  state  and  major\ndistrict roads, against the requirement of $5.5 billion under the Eighth Plan. Of this, about $211\nmillion has been undertaken with private sector participation, mainly bridges and bypasses. The\nExpert Group estimated the total requirements for state highways from 1996/2006 to be about\n$10.2 billion.10 The private sector was expected to contribute about $1.3 billion.\n\nFor  ports,  projected  requirements  are  $5.3  billion11  to  meet  the  expected  increase  in\n11.\ndemand and cargo handling capacity to 400 million tons by 2000/01 and to 650 million tons by\n2005/06.  However,  the  plan  allocation  during  1990/97  was  only  $905  million.  Under  the  Ninth\nPlan, an additional 122 million tons capacity is envisaged at an estimated cost of Rs175 billion\n(about $3.7 billion). However, only 46 percent of the requirement is expected to be met by the\nmajor ports through borrowings and internal generation. About 11.5 percent is to be raised from\nexternal sources including multilateral agencies. The balance is proposed to be met through the\ndevelopment of minor state ports and investments in captive facilities by user industries and the\nprivate  sector.  Thus  far,  port  projects  from  private  sector/captive  users  of  about  Rs39  billion\n($816 million) have been approved and are at various stages of construction.\n\n12.\nThe  Airports  Authority  of  India  manages  92  airports,  of  which  5  are  international\ngateways.12  Presently,  the  various  airlines  are  operating  from  only  61  airports.  The  rest  are\nunutilized,  handling  occasional  aircraft.  Given  the  volume  of  air  traffic,13  the  need  for  new\ninternational  airports  is  not  immediate,  although  forecasts  by  different  organizations  reflect  an\nincrease  in  domestic  passenger  traffic  of  8.5  percent  and  international  passengers  by  6.0\npercent  annually  from  now  until  2004/05.14  However,  in  1998/99,  51  percent  of  airport  traffic\nwas  handled  at  Delhi  and  Mumbai.  The  apparent  need  is  to  reduce  congestion  and  upgrade\nairport  services.  For  this  purpose,  the  Airport  Authority  proposed  an  expenditure  of  Rs34.2\nbillion ($715 million) under the Ninth Plan for airport infrastructure. A large proportion of this is\nexpected to be raised from the private sector. Thus far, one airport has been inaugurated under\n\n                  \n\n9 Ministry of Finance. 1996.

Under  the  Eighth  Plan,  $1.2  billion  was  provided.  To  cover  the  resource  gap,  the\nGovernment  resorted  to  build-operate-transfer  (BOT)  schemes  with  the  private  sector  for  bulk\nwater supply. However, inefficiencies in water distribution made new investments in the water\nsector unviable and led to the failure of most of the private sector participation schemes. Under\nthe Ninth Plan, investments of $6.1 billion for urban water and $9.3 billion for rural water supply\nare envisaged. Funding will be a crucial issue.\n\n3. \n\nReasons Behind Weak Private Sector Response\n\n14.\nAt  the  root  of  the  difficulty  is  the  slow  development  of  an  enabling  environment  for  the\nprivate sector. More specifically, why the response by the private sector to the liberalization of\nIndia\u2019s  infrastructure  sectors,  particularly  at  the  state  level,  fell  below  expectations  may  be\nattributed to the confluence of several major factors: (i) the progress of reforms has been slower\nthan earlier anticipated; (ii) governance structures are not suited for the broad participation by\nthe  private  sector  in  infrastructure  in  a  liberalized  environment,  (iii)  the  public/private  interface\nrequire substantial strengthening, and (iv) inability to unbundle and allocate risk in the domestic\ncapital market (Appendix 2).\n\na. \n\nProgress of Reforms Not as Fast as Anticipated\n\n15.\nPower.  In  the  power  sector,  the  impaired  financial  condition  of  most  state  electricity\nboards (SEBs), the major purchasers of power, has resulted in the marked slowdown of private\ninvestments in power generation.15 The poor financial state of SEBs, on the other hand, is due\nto several major causes: (i) revenue losses16 arising from subsidies to the agriculture sector and\nother domestic users, not compensated for by the state; (ii) high level of leakages,17 particularly\nfrom  distribution  mainly  due  to  theft,  and  inaccurate  metering;  and  (iii)  poor  collection  of\nreceivables.18\n\n16.\nThis poor state of SEBs is also hampering privatization. When a SEB is privatized, the\nstate  government  has  to  bear  the  up-front  costs  of  reform.  If  the  SEB  has  raised  loans  with  a\nstate guarantee, the cost of meeting these commitments can be formidable. Other costs include\nunfunded pension liabilities; contractual obligations, such as unpaid dues to suppliers; voluntary\nretirement  schemes  for  reducing  excess  staff  to  place  the  SEB  on  commercially  viable  terms;\nand environmental liabilities, if any.\n\n                  \n\n15 To  cover  the  risk  of  nonpayment  by  SEBs,  financial  institutions  resorted  to  escrow  arrangements  appropriating\ncash flows coursed through an escrow account for payment of power purchases. However, estimates show that the\ncurrent  escrowable  capacity  is  no  longer  sufficient  to  cover  commitments  under  signed  power  purchase\nagreements  or  awarded  projects.  State  guarantees  have  also  been  provided.  For  large  fast-track  projects,\nsovereign guarantees have been given.\n\n16 To illustrate the order of magnitude, the ratio of tariff to cost was about 74 percent in 1999/2000.\n17 Official estimates of transmission and distribution (T&D) losses put them at 21 to 25 percent. However, in states\nstarting to implement power reform, actual T&D losses are being found to be much higher. For example, in Orissa,\nthe increase was from 23 percent to 51 percent. In Haryana, a recent World Bank study revealed that the actual\nlevel  of  T&D  losses  is  about  47  percent  instead  of  36  percent.  Moreover,  recent  analyses  of  power  utilization\npatterns  in  Andhra  Pradesh,  Gujarat,  and  Haryana  indicate  that  a  substantial  portion  of  power  consumption\nattributed to farmers has actually been utilized by unauthorized nonagricultural users.\n\n18 Average receivables position of SEBs is about 30 percent of revenues.\n\n\f5\n\nAmong  the  states,  only  Orissa,  with  World  Bank  support,  has  separated  power  into\n17.\ngeneration,  transmission,  and  distribution,  and  subsequently  privatized  generation  and\ndistribution.19  Furthermore,  only  nine  states  have  complied  with  an  agreement  reached  four\nyears  ago  among  state  chief  ministers  to  charge  a  minimum  tariff  of  Rs0.50  to  the  agriculture\nsector.  This  was  to  be  raised  to  50  percent  of  the  average  cost  of  supply  within  three  years\nending  in  1999.20  Little  progress  on  this  has  apparently  been  made.21  Worse,  many  state\ngovernments  are  not  compensating  SEBs  for  the  subsidies  extended  to  agricultural  and\ndomestic users.22 However, the implementation of more comprehensive structural reforms with\nassistance  from  bilateral  and  multilateral  aid  agencies  suffered  significant  delays  due  to\napprehensions  by  countries  extending  financial  assistance  over  the  uncertainty  that  clouded\nIndia\u2019s nuclear policy. In Gujarat, power sector reforms had to be moved back about two and a\nhalf  years  from  what  was  originally  planned;  while  in  Andhra  Pradesh  (AP),  power  sector\nreforms were initiated about one and a half to two years behind schedule.\n\n18.\nIn  addition,  of  total  energy  generated,  only  about  55  percent  is  billed  while  only  41\npercent  is  actually  collected,  and  of  the  unbilled  accounts,  theft  accounts  for  20  percent  and\ncommercial  losses  for  4  percent.  Stopping  theft  and  improving  billing  and  collection  could\neliminate  the  current  SEB  losses.  Losses  from  generation  and  high  voltage  transmission  are\nestimated  to  be  12\u201313  percent  while  losses  stemming  from  distribution  operations  are  about\n40\u201345  percent.23  Consequently,  serious  consideration  is  now  being  given  to  privatizing  power\ndistribution, an area  that has been relatively neglected.\n\n19.\nRoads. An immediate problem is lack of reliable demand estimates. Precise estimates\nof demand are difficult particularly for new toll roads where alternative slower but toll-free routes\nare  available.  Without  reliable  traffic  projections,  determining  the  commercial  viability  of  tolled\nroads  is  difficult.  Moreover,  the  acceptable  level  of  tolls  and  willingness  to  pay  have  yet  to  be\nestablished. Consequently, only small bridges and bypasses have been privately financed.\n\nFurthermore, in developing a road project, particularly with a component for commercial\n20.\nland development, apart from the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MORTH)24 and its\narm, the National Highways Authority of India, numerous other agencies are involved, such as\nurban planning authorities, local municipalities, and zoning and state revenue authorities.25 The\nDelhi-Noida  toll  bridge  project  took  six  years  to  bring  to  financial  closure.  The  Vadodara-Halol\nroad project took four years to commission.\n\nHowever, \n\n21.\nin  road\ndevelopment  would  provide  sound  project  management.  Furthermore,  professional\n\nthat  private  sector  participation \n\nthe  governments  recognize \n\n                  \n\n19 Andhra Pradesh is in the process of privatizing its distribution companies.\n20 The low tariff for agriculture is cross-subsidized leading to exorbitant rates for commerce and industry. As a result,\n\nindustries are either moving to captive power generation or changing states.\n\n21 Gujarat  has  raised  agricultural  tariffs  by  more  than  400  percent  and  average  tariff  levels  for  other  consumer\n\n22 Andhra  Pradesh  recently  reimbursed  its  Transmission  Company  for  the  tariff  subsidy  as  determined  by  its\n\ncategories by 15 percent.\n\nregulatory agency.\n\n23 From the Agenda Notes of the Conference of Chief Ministers/Prime Ministers, 3 March 2001.\n24 A  previous  key  ministry,  Ministry  of  Surface  Transport,  was  reorganized  in  November  2000  into  two  ministries:\nMORTH, and Ministry of Shipping and Ports (MOSP). MORTH's duties relate to the development and maintenance\nof national highways, and policies on road transport. In addition, it coordinates state roads and issues guidelines on\nhighway  planning,  design,  and  construction.  MOSP  is  responsible  for  major  ports,  inland  water  transport,  and\nshipping.\n\n25 National  highways  are  administered  by  the  central  Government.  All  other  roads,  i.e.,  state  highways,  and  district\n\nand village roads, are within the responsibility of the state and local bodies.\n\n\f6\n\nmanagement could also contribute significantly to improving road repair and maintenance, aside\nfrom  raising  service  levels,  for  example,  for  emergency  assistance  for  accidents  and  stalled\nvehicles, as well as for road safety.\n\nPorts.  Amendments  to  the  Indian  Ports  Act,  190826  to  enable  privatization,  and  the\n22.\nMajor Ports Trust Act, 196327 to facilitate corporatization have been identified but are yet to be\npassed.28 The port sector is governed by a plethora of acts. In addition to the two preceding acts\nare  the  Dock  Workers\u2019  Act  (1948)  and  the  Merchant  Shipping  Act  (1958).  Investors  are\ncompelled  to  examine  these  and  other  acts  in  detail,  raising  the  complexity  and  riskiness  of\ndealing with port projects.\n\n23.\nThere  is  a  patent  need  to  develop  an  integrated  plan  for  capacity  development  by  the\ncentral and state governments to facilitate private initiatives in port development. For example,\neight  coastal  states  have  announced  plans  to  develop  minor  ports  in  their  respective  areas.\nHowever,  these  minor  ports  are  in  close  proximity  to  each  other  and  to  some  major  ports.\nMapping  out  regional  growth  patterns  and  cargo  trends  to  forecast  required  investments  that\ntake into account possible buildup of excess capacity as well as connectivity requirements and\nhinterland development would facilitate and mitigate risks for private sector participation in ports.\n\nThe labor issue needs to be addressed. Existing labor contracts and laws29 still do not\n24.\npermit termination of labor except through prohibitive voluntary retirement schemes.30 The cost\nof  overstaffing  is  a  serious  deterrent  to  private  sector  involvement.  Moreover,  the  terms  of\nemployment are quite rigid with wages and job classifications highly specified. Attempts to link\nwages to productivity have had limited success. Consequently, ports that have been offered to\nthe private sector are principally new ports.\n\n25.\nPorts targeted for development need associated infrastructure that the private sector, by\nitself, would be unable to provide, such as connecting roads, railway linkages, power facilities,\ncontainer yards, and customs administration.\n\n26.\nThe main problem for Indian ports is low productivity leading to an average turnaround\ntime of 5.9 days.31 This is due to congestion and poor multimodal interface infrastructure. Three\nof the oldest ports (Chennai, Kolkata,32 and Mumbai) are located in city centers. They need to\nbe decongested by developing additional ports that provide needed berthing capacity and easier\nmodal  interface  access.  Moreover,  container-handling  costs  are  comparatively  much  higher\nthan in other countries in the Asian region. For example, the India Infrastructure Report 200133\n\n                  \n\ngovernments.\n\n26 This  governs  the  operations  of  148  intermediate  and  minor  ports  that  are  administratively  under  the  state\n\n27 This  governs  the  operations  of  India\u2019s  11  major  ports  for  which  responsibility  rests  with  the  central  Government\n\nthrough the Ministry Of Shipping and Ports.\n\n28 Existing provisions in the Major Ports Trust Act permit private sector participation in ports based on an opinion laid\n\ndown by the Ministry of Law and Justice, Department of Legal Affairs. This is to be clarified in the law.\n\n29 Dock Labour Board Act and conditions under the contract of the Port Trusts.\n30 Almost all major ports are believed to have excess labor. Some estimates place excess labor at Mumbai at about\n\n35,000, at Kolkata 13,000, and at Chennai 11,000.\n\n31 Against a benchmark of two days at international ports; turnaround time in Singapore is about 6 to 8 hours.\n32 Formerly Calcutta.\n33 Raghuram.

The  policy  adopted  in  December  1997  endorsing  private  sector  participation\nmust now be implemented. New private sector airports at Bangalore in Karnataka, Hyderabad in\nAP,  and  Panaji  in  Goa  have  been  sanctioned.  Approval  has  also  been  given  to  privatizing\nairport  services  at  Chennai,  Delhi,  Kolkata,  and  Mumbai.  However,  as  exemplified  by  the\nattempt to build a new airport in Bangalore, difficulties are anticipated. As part of the conditions,\nthe  private  sector  parties  stipulated  closure  of  the  existing  airport.  After  initial  agreement  and\nmuch  wrangling,  the  state  government  refused  to  carry  this  out.  The  process  has  since  been\nrevived.  The  Karnata  Government  has  rebid  the  airport  project,  selected  a  new  partner;  and\nagreed  to  close  the  existing  airport  to  all  civil  aviation  flights.  The  policy  on  airports  must  be\nconsidered  in  conjunction  with  the  policy  framework  for  the  entire  civil  aviation  sector.  Further\nliberalization of civil aviation could have a palpable impact on air travel in India. The public has\nresponded favorably to the decision to privatize Air India and Indian Airlines\n\n28. Water  Supply  and  Sewerage.  Urban  water  supply  and  sewerage  services  are\nadministered by water supply boards in various states. Water supply is generally considered a\nsocial  obligation  and  is  subsidized.  Consequently,  this  approach  has  introduced  systemic\ninefficiencies  relating  to  wastage,  theft,  high  leakage  rates,  and  poor  collection.  To  attract\nprivate  sector  investment,  pricing  will  need  to  be  rationalized.  Subsidies  that  may  be  provided\ndue  to  affordability  issues  should  be  reimbursed  by  the  state  through  budgetary  support.  The\npresent differential in tariff structures among Indian cities ranges from $0.10 to $2 per kiloliter.\nLocal  governments  usually  revise  water  tariffs  every  five  years.  The  imposed  price  increases\nare consequently large and typically are resisted by consumers. Nonetheless, certain state have\nhad  some  success  in  this  area.  The  AP  state  government  revised  the  water  tariffs  for  house\nservice connection recently from $0.47 US to a minimum charge of $1.00 per month. This 100\npercent  increase  was  imposed  after  seven  years.  A  more  pragmatic  approach  was  taken  by\nKerala, which successfully established a program of automatic annual water tariff increases of\nup to 15 percent.\n\n29.\nInefficiencies  in  water  supply  distribution  need  to  be  addressed,  including  high  water\nleakage. Water loss through distribution systems is estimated to range from 20 to 40 percent of\nthe total flow. Furthermore, although most large towns have meters, in certain cases up to 50\npercent of all meters operate poorly. In many areas, the existing infrastructure is poor due to low\npriority  usually  accorded  to  system  maintenance  resulting  from  lack  of  finances;  inadequate\ndata,  designs,  and  survey  plans;  inadequate  training  of  personnel;  and  lack  of  proper\nmonitoring.  The  sewerage  situation  is  even  worse,  with  many  cities  not  having  sewerage\nsystems.\n\nb. \n\nUnsuitable Governance Structures\n\n30.\nAs  an  offshoot  of  past  policies,  the  operation  and  development  of  infrastructure  have\nbeen  the  responsibility  of  the  central  and  state  governments.  Consequently,  the  governments\nhave  been  the  policymakers,  regulators,  and  operators  all  rolled  into  one.  Services  provided\nwere  basically  considered  public  goods,  and  thus,  stakeholders  were  rarely  involved,  nor  did\nstakeholders  ask  to  be  involved  if  the  services  were  provided  at  affordable  cost,  even  if  the\nquality of the service and long-term sustainability were in question. Public dialogue was seldom\n\n                  \n\n34 Yet  in  Gujarat,  ports  under  the  Gujarat  Maritime  Board  charge  slightly  less  than  $140  per  twenty-foot  unit.  The\n\nvariance in cost compared with Mumbai apparently points to a difference in efficiency levels.\n\n\f8\n\nheld  on  critical  economic  issues  or  on  the  promulgation  of  formal  policy.  Moreover,  with\nregulation also the responsibility of the operator, the level of accountability was low.\n\n31.\nHowever,  with  liberalization  and  the  drive  to  attract  private  sector  participation  in\ninfrastructure  operation  and  development,  past  philosophies  have  been  gradually  changing.\nThis  past  role  is  now  being  reexamined  in  the  different  infrastructure  sectors  with  a  view  to\nseparating  this  monolithic  structure  into  various  roles  to  ensure  predictability,  institute\nappropriate  checks  and  balances,  promote  fair  competition  and  more  effective  regulation  and\nsupervision, and address most of the uncertainties that often discourage broader private sector\nparticipation \u2014 all crucial factors for sustainable private sector engagement. More importantly,\nshifting  infrastructure  operation  and  development  to  a  market  orientation  would  promote\nefficiency and productivity, both crucial to the long-term soundness and sustainability of India\u2019s\ninfrastructure sectors. However, this process is still evolving.\n\n32.\nFew  states  have  adopted  formal  policies  for  private  sector  participation  or  defined  the\nrules  and  terms  under  which  private  sector  entry  and  participation  would  be  allowed  and  with\nwhat  incentives.  Moreover,  while  the  Expert  Group\u2019s  early  recommendations  considered  the\nneed  for  separate  autonomous  regulatory  agencies  for  the  various  infrastructure  sectors,\nrecognition of this need has been slow.\n\nFor  instance,  in  the  power  sector,  the  Electricity  Regulatory  Commissions  Act  was\n33.\npassed only in 1998 enabling states to set up their own regulatory agencies, the state electricity\nregulatory commissions (SERCs). This was intended to bring about power tariff rationalization in\nan  objective  manner  and  make  government  subsidy  policies  transparent.  Of  28  states35,  15\nhave set up SERCs, of which 12 are now functional but only 8 have issued tariff orders.\n\n34.\nNo  separate  national  or  state  regulators  exist  for  roads.  The  uncertainty  for  private\nbidders is increased by the multiplicity of agencies that may invite tenders for the same route.\nWith the same ministry responsible for licensing and operating road projects also regulating the\nsector, the possibility of the private sector not receiving fair and equal treatment vis-\u00e0-vis public\noperators  remains  a  concern.  The  regulatory  framework  for  ports  also  lacks  clarity  without  a\nseparate  dedicated  regulator.  For  instance,  no  standards  are  in  place  for  measuring\nproductivity,  and  tariffs  are  not  anchored  on  economic  costs.  Prudential  norms  for  port  trusts,\nwhich  manage  the  major  ports,  vary  considerably.  Major  ports  are  covered  by  the  tariff\nrestrictions  imposed  by  the  Tariff  Authority  for  Major  Ports,  while  minor  ports  are  at  liberty  to\ndetermine their tariff levels.\n\n35.\nFor  airports,  the  central  Government  formulated  a  policy  on  airport  infrastructure\ndevelopment  in  1997  to  permit  up  to  74  percent  foreign  equity  participation  on  automatic\napproval  and  up  to  100  percent  with  special  dispensation.  It  also  proposed  an  independent\nto  evolve.  Accordingly,  economic  and\nregulatory  board.  Regulations, \nenvironmental  considerations  have  yet  to  be  addressed  concerning  questions  about  location\nand  connectivity  to  urban  centers,  land  acquisition  and  local  resistance,  pricing  of  services,\nperformance  norms,  time  and  space  allocations,  and  noise  and  emission  standards,  among\nothers.  Similarly  for  water  and  sewerage,  regulatory  bodies  are  needed  at  the  state/municipal\nlevel to facilitate private sector participation by overseeing the various concession agreements\nand setting standards for quality and performance.\n\nthus,  are  still \n\n                  \n\n35 The three new states of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, and Uttaranchal were created only in November 2000 as a result\n\nof the bifurcation of the existing states of Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, and Uttar Pradesh, respectively.\n\n\f9\n\nc. \n\nNeed to Strengthen Public-Private Interface\n\n36. With the absence of formal or enunciated state policy on private sector participation, few\nstates are organized to deal with the private sector and privatizations, as they lack appropriate\ninstitutional  structures  and  processes,  established  systems  and  procedures,  and  capable\ndedicated staff. Delays are common in (i) seeking approvals for projects; (ii) obtaining permits\nand  clearances;  (iii)  processing,  negotiating,  and  finalizing  contracts;  and  (iv)  bringing\ninfrastructure  projects  to  financial  closure.  Due  to  inexperience,  capacity  for  promoting  and\ndeveloping  infrastructure  projects  is  limited.  Thus,  priority  areas  for  private  sector  participation\nare  not  identified  early  and  feasible  projects  are  not  developed  for  bidding.  Lack  of  adequate\naccess to required data is a serious constraint. For example, developing a pipeline of bankable\nprojects for private sector investments in roads against a defined plan rather than dealing with\nprojects  on  an  individual  stand-alone  basis  has  proved  to  be  a  more  cost-effective  approach.\nFurthermore, under its enunciated policy, the central Government, as well as the states, agreed\nto provide support for preparing detailed feasibility studies, identifying land for right-of-way and\nenroute facilities; and providing land, as well as environmental clearances including relocation of\nutilities and resettlement and rehabilitation of affected people/establishments. Equally important\nis  the  need  to  develop  bankable  projects.  Lack  of  financial  engineering  expertise  poses\ndifficulties  in  packaging  projects  that  could  be  successfully  offered  for  financing.  Project\ndevelopment is proving to be a very risky and costly exercise.\n\n37.\nInvariably,  infrastructure  projects  attract  public  interest  litigation.  Many  are  avoidable  if\nconsumers  are  appropriately  sensitized  to  user  charges  and  to  the  positive  effects  of\nprivatization. The recent privatization of the Bharat Aluminium Company located in Chhattisgarh\nis a case in point. At the outset, the privatization met with strong labor resistance and objections\nfrom  the  state  government.  Since  India  is  undertaking  privatization  in  a  systemic  fashion,  the\nimpacts  of  privatization  on  all  affected  parties  need  to  be  identified  early,  and  ways  by  which\nsuch  impacts  are  to  be  mitigated  determined.  Experience  shows  that  obtaining  environmental\nclearances from various national and state bodies has led to avoidable delays, arising from local\nresistance and cost overruns.\n\n38.\nMoreover,  the  absence  of  credible  mechanisms  for  settling  disputes  and  well-defined\nbases  for  settling  disputes  also  contribute  to  protracted  debates  over  terms  of  agreements.\nStandard  concession  agreements  have  been  prepared  to  guide  negotiations  for  a  few\ninfrastructure sectors. Model concession agreements have been drafted recently for roads and\nlargely  address  lenders  concerns.  However,  they  have  yet  to  be  tested  for  bigger  projects.\nMoreover,  at  the  state  level,  the  bankability  of  concession  agreements  is  an  issue  since  the\nmodel  concession  agreement  is  not  being  used,  rather  standard  construction  contracts  are\nfrequently utilized. Similarly, bidding procedures need to be streamlined and enhanced to bring\nthem  in  line  with  international  practices.  For  roads,  for  example,  the  eligibility  criteria  for\nawarding projects on a BOT basis do not seem to depart significantly from regular road works\ncontracts. As a result, even small poorly capitalized firms can bid for contracts leading to lengthy\nselection processes.\n\nd. \n\nInability to Disaggregate and Allocate Risk\n\n39.\nOne of the major constraints to private infrastructure financing in India is the inability of\nproject  sponsors  to  identify  separately  and  allocate  risk  of  infrastructure  projects.  Available\nsources  of  supplemental  equity  (in  addition  to  sponsors\u2019  funds)  and  long-term  debt  that  can\nmatch the long gestation and payback periods of most infrastructure projects are limited, despite\n\n\f10\n\na large stock market. Thus, domestic financial institutions risk large mismatches in their books\nto finance large-scale infrastructure projects, facing both liquidity as well as interest rate risks.\nRisk from foreign exchange exposure is also difficult to hedge due to a still relatively thin swap\nmarket.  As  recourse \ninnovative  credit  enhancement\nmechanisms, instruments, and arrangements need to be developed. Escrows have reached the\nlimits  of  available  cash  flows  from  SEBs,  while  states  have  restricted  issuances  of  state\nguarantees because of a Reserve Bank of India (RBI) cap on such guarantees.\n\nto  available  collateral \n\nlimited, \n\nis \n\nDomestic  financial  institutions  view  the  risks  and  costs  during  construction  as  major\n40.\ndeterrents. Insurance companies in India are just starting to liberalize and finance infrastructure\nprojects, and still do not provide insurance cover for a variety of risks such as nonperformance\non  technical  contracts  or  risks  during  construction.  For  foreign  sponsors,  sovereign  risk\nparticularly at the state level remains a major consideration.\n\nB. \n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\nRecognizing  the  precipitous  slide  in  the  growth  of  infrastructure36  and  the  need  for  an\n41.\nimmediate response, the Government constituted the Special Subject Group (Subject Group) on\nInfrastructure  within  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Council  on  Trade  and  Industry  to  suggest  ways  to\nenhance \nthe  quickest  way  possible.  The  summary\nrecommendations and composition of the Subject Group are given in Supplementary Appendix\nA.\n\ninfrastructure \n\ninvestments \n\nin \n\nin \n\n42.\nIn general, the recommendations follow two general principles: (i) infrastructure services\nmust be offered in the most efficient, low-cost manner to best meet community needs, and (ii)\nusers  must  pay  for  actual  costs  of  infrastructure  services  plus  a  reasonable  return  on\ninvestment.  To  accomplish  these,  six  major  common  policy  actions  are  identified  for  each\ninfrastructure  sector:  (i)  separate  the  regulator  from  the  operator;  (ii)  corporatize  existing\ngovernment  operating  entities  to  provide  better  autonomy  to  these  entities  and  have  them\noperate  along  commercial  lines;  (iii)  privatize,  where  appropriate,  corporatized  entities  (except\nstrategic  assets);  (iv)  promote  competition  in  sectors  that  are  not  natural  monopolies;  (v)\nestablish  enabling  regulations  e.g.,  for  rights-of-way  and  environmental  clearances;  and  (vi)\nimplement  full  cost  recovery  for  infrastructure  services,  e.g.,  tariff  for  agriculture  sector  and\nresidential consumers, tariff for local calls in the telecommunications sector, and water charges\nin cities.\n\nPower. An electricity bill introduced in Parliament, will: (i) mandate state governments to\n43.\nreplace SEBs with separate generation, transmission, and distribution companies or generation\nand  combined  transmission  and  distribution  companies  with  a  proviso  to  create  more\ndistribution  companies  if  the  state  government  so  decides;  (ii)  raise  the  agricultural  tariff  to  a\nminimum of Rs0.50 per unit, and in not more than three years, raise this again to 50 percent of\nthe  cost  of  supply  of  power  as  in  earlier  agreements;  (iii)  require  states  that  have  not  set  up\nelectricity  regulatory  commissions  to  set  one  up  within  three  months;  and  (iv)  require  strict\nenforcement of metering equipment as stipulated by the Central Electricity Authority. The view is\nto  consider  private  distribution  of  power  as  an  independent  economic  activity  rather  than  as  a\nlicensed operation on terms determined by the SEBs. This will help create a more predictable\ninvestment environment.\n\n36 Growth in infrastructure slowed to 5 percent of GDP in FY2001, from 8 percent in FY1999.\n\n                  \n\n\f11\n\nAs  an  incentive,  the  Government  has  offered  a  one-time  settlement  of  SEB  dues  to\n44.\ncentral  public  sector  undertakings  of  approximately  Rs260  billion  ($5.4  billion)  in  return  for  a\ntime-bound  program  of  reforms.  Memorandums  of  understanding  between  the  central  and\nconcerned state governments were signed in March 2001 to this effect. Except for the states of\nPunjab and Tamil Nadu, all others agreed to charge a minimum agricultural tariff of Rs0.50 per\nunit.  The  governments  also  agreed  that  all  states  would  achieve  commercial  viability  of  their\nSEBs within two years. Each state may follow different routes, but essentially will create profit\ncenters  with  full  accountability  and  may  choose  to  hand  over  local  distribution  to  the  private\nsector. A consultative group37 recently completed its study formulating a strategy for the capital\nrestructuring of SEBs. Incentives for restructuring of about Rs15 billion ($314 million) to SEBs\nare provided in the current budget and are expected to be provided on an annual basis under\nthe  Accelerated  Power  Development  Programme  with  an  enhanced  allocation  of  power  from\ncentral  sector  power  companies,  along  the  lines  agreed  to  by  the  central  and  various  state\ngovernments.\n\n45.\nTransmission  projects,  which  are  a  government  monopoly,  have  traditionally  been\nfinanced  from  internal  accruals  and  state  budgets.  For  the  past  decade  or  so,  development\nfinance  institutions  such  as  the  Power  Finance  Corporation  and  multilateral  agencies  have\nfinanced the sector. The Power Finance Corporation has identified transmission and distribution\nas a high priority sector for financing. However, funding sources have proven inadequate, more\nso with the SEBs not being financially equipped to execute projects on their own. To overcome\nthese constraints, private participation in the sector has been invited with the amendment of the\nElectricity  Supply  Act,  1948,  to  enable  private  investment  in  the  sector.  However,  so  far  no\nprivate  sector  enterprise  has  invested.  Karnataka  and  Madhya  Pradesh  were  among  the  first\nstates to invite private participation in the transmission sector. Karnataka formed a joint venture\nwith National Grid of the United Kingdom to evacuate power from two power generation projects\nproposed  to  be  set  up  at  Mangalore.  However,  with  both  generation  projects  encountering\ndifficulties,  the  transmission  project  has  not  made  any  progress.  Madhya  Pradesh  also  had\nplans to set up over 20 private transmission projects, mainly to evacuate power from the many\nindependent  power  producers  proposed  in  the  state.  With  the  independent  power  producers\nembroiled  in  disputes  on  availability  of  escrow  cover  from  the  SEB,  the  transmission  projects\nhave  been  delayed.  Demand  for  private  sector  participation  is  expected  to  improve  with  the\nresolution of the generation issues and implementation of independent power producers.\n\n46.\nIn April 2001, the Power Grid Corporation of India also announced plans to tender $2.6\nbillion in six transmission projects under international competitive bidding norms38 using a tariff-\nbased formula intended to select the bidder with the lowest tendered tariff. These projects will\nbe developed on a build-own-operate-transfer basis.\n\n47.\nThe  states  of  AP,  Delhi,  Haryana,  Karnataka,  Orissa,  Rajasthan,  and  Uttar  Pradesh\nhave enacted their respective electricity reform acts. The Madhya Pradesh legislative assembly\nhas passed an electricity reform bill. A similar electricity reform bill has been drafted by Gujarat\nand is awaiting approval by the legislative assembly.39 Average power tariffs have increased by\n5  to  20  percent  in  several  states  (AP,  Gujarat,  Haryana,  Karnataka,  Madhya  Pradesh,\n\n                  \n\n37 Headed by M.S. Ahluwahlia, former finance secretary.\n38  ADB  is  assisting  Power  Grid  Corporation  to  prepare  bidding  documents  to  invite  the  private  sector  to  implement\ntransmission  projects  and  to  select  suitable  developers  under  TA  3380-IND:  Private  Sector  Participation  in\nElectricity Transmission, for $600,000, approved on 28 December 1999.\n\n39 Loans 1803/1804-IND: Gujarat Power Sector Development Program, for $350 million, approved on 13 December\n\n2000.\n\n\f12\n\nMaharashtra,  and  Orissa)  following  tariff  orders  by  their  SERCs.  The  states  of  AP,  Delhi,\nKarnataka, and Rajasthan, are scheduled to initiate the process of privatization of distribution in\n2001/02, with Haryana likely to follow.\n\nRoads.  The  Central  Road  Fund  Ordinance,  2000  was  promulgated  on  1  November\n48.\n2000.  An  amount  of  Rs25  billion  ($523  million  approximately)  was  appropriated  from  the  cess\non diesel fuel to invest in rural connectivity, while Rs9.6 billion (about $201 million) is being set\naside  from  the  cess  on  diesel  and  petrol  to  develop  state  roads.  To  facilitate  private  sector\nparticipation,  model  concession  agreements  for  major  projects  costing  more  than  Rs1  billion\nand for projects below Rs1 billion to be undertaken on a BOT basis have been finalized.\n\n49.\nThe total outlay for the road sector was enhanced by 93 percent to Rs87.3 billion (about\n$1.8  billion).  The  National  Highway  Authority  is  setting  up  wholly  owned  special  purpose\nvehicles for implementing certain projects on a nonrecourse or partial recourse basis, such as\nthe  Ahmedabad-Vadodara  Expressway,  Moradabad  Bypass,  and  Palset-Panagarth  Road\nproject.  A  10-year  tax  holiday  during  the  first  20  years  of  operation  is  proposed  for  road\ndevelopment.\n\n50.\nPorts. While privatizations have yet to be implemented, Ministry Of Shipping and Ports\nhas issued guidelines for inviting private sector participation in defined areas. These include (i)\nlease  of  existing  assets;  (ii)  construction/creation  and  operation  of  additional  assets  such  as\ncontainer  terminals,  multipurpose  and  specialized  cargo,  berths,  and  container  freight  stations\nand  storage  facilities;  (iii)  pilotage;  and  (iv)  captive  facilities  for  port-based  industries.  Some\nstate  governments  have  begun  formulating  BOT  and  similar  arrangements  for  private  sector\nentry  and  participation.  States  such  as  AP,  Gujarat,  Maharashtra  and  Orissa  have  issued\ntenders/ awards for the development of select minor ports.\n\n51.\nA 10-year tax holiday is also proposed for ports development. It can be availed of within\nthe first 15 years of operation. The rates of depreciation for ships and inland water vessels have\nbeen increased from 20 to 25 percent per annum.\n\n52.\nAirports.  One  of  the  earliest  areas  to  be  liberalized  in  India  was  civil  aviation.  Even\nbefore  a  policy  on  airline  infrastructure  had  been  formulated,  private  participation  in  domestic\nairlines was already permitted. Private airlines today provide stiff competition to Indian Airlines,\ncapturing an estimated more than 40 percent of domestic air traffic. The current policy permits\n40  percent  ownership  by  foreign  investors  in  domestic  airlines.40  Fares  and  schedules  have\nbeen  deregulated,  but  domestic  airlines  are  required  to  service  smaller  city  routes  under  the\npolicy.  Cargo  traffic  is  fully  accessible  in  both  domestic  and  international  routes.  Private\nchartered  planes  have  also  been  allowed  to  operate  freely,  offering  services  to  tourists  and\nentrepreneurs.\n\n53. Water  and  Sewerage.  At  the  national  level,  the  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  is\nresponsible for laying down policy guidelines and programs for the development of the country\u2019s\nwater  resources.  The  recommended  strategy  under  the  Ninth  Plan  for  improving  urban  water\nsupply and sewerage is to decentralize water production and distribution systems by devolving\nresponsibility  to  municipal  governments  including  promoting  inter-municipal  coordination  and\nenhancing the role of civil society associations. The strategy also seeks to promote privatization\nand  greater  community  participation  in  managing  and  maintaining  services,  and  leveraging\npublic  resources  and  exploiting  innovative  ways  to  improve  access  to  finance.  Currently,  the\n\n40 For unclear reasons, foreign airlines are not allowed to have any ownership in these domestic airlines.\n\n                  \n\n\f13\n\nmain sources of financing for this sector are budgetary allocations from national, state, and local\ngovernments (about 70 percent), loans and grants from bilateral and multilateral agencies, and\ninstitutional  lending  by  Life  Insurance  Corporation  of  India  and  the  Housing  and  Urban\nDevelopment Corporation.\n\nUnder  the  74th  Constitutional  Amendment  passed  in  1992,  service  provision  for  water\n54.\nand  sewerage  is  to  be  decentralized  to  the  various  municipalities  based  on  greater  powers\ndelegated to local governments. However, the municipal laws required to bring them in line with\nthe  constitutional  provisions  are  yet  to  be  enacted.  In  practice,  implementing  decentralization\nfaces  many  constraints.  The  World  Bank  identified  these  as  including,  lack  of  standard\ninstitutional  arrangements  between  the  states  and  municipal  bodies  for  providing  water  and\nsanitation  services;  lack  of  arrangements  for  the  transfer  of  resources  from  the  state  to  the\nmunicipalities;  considerable  political  interference  in  operations,  decision  making,  and  tariff\nsetting;  weak  capacity  at  the  municipal  levels;  fragmentation  of  municipal  functions,  lack  of\npublic  service  orientation;  limited  creditworthiness  due  to  nontransparent  financial  and\naccounting  systems,  and  weak  treasury  management.  Given  the  systemic  nature  of  these\nproblems, the World Bank proposes that the central Government in partnership with the states\nand  their  cities  undertake  systematic  institutional,  fiscal,  and  financial  reforms  to  develop\ncreditworthy cities in line with urbanization and the devolution of political and economic powers.\n\nFiscal Responsibility Act. Concerned about the burgeoning fiscal imbalances and the\n55.\nrapid buildup in public debt, the Government constituted the Committee on Fiscal Responsibility\nin January 2000 to look into the various aspects of the fiscal system and to draft legislation on\nfiscal responsibility. This was followed by a pronouncement in the 2000/01 budget to bring the\nlegislative  proposal  forward  and  adopt  concrete  mechanisms  to  implement  its  provisions.\nAccordingly,  the  Fiscal  Responsibility  and  Budget  Management  Bill  2000  was  introduced  in\nParliament  in  December  2000  and  subsequently  referred  to  the  Parliamentary  Standing\nCommittee.\n\n56.\nThe  proposed  law  binds  the  Government  itself  to  observe  prudent  guidelines,  achieve\nspecified  targets  in  the  conduct  of  fiscal  policy,  and  thereby  promote  greater  macroeconomic\nstability. The proposed Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Bill will provide a legal\nand  institutional  framework  to  reduce  the  fiscal  deficit,  contain  the  growth  of  public  debt,  and\nstabilize debt as a proportion of GDP over the medium term. It binds future governments to a\nprespecified  path  of  fiscal  consolidation.  This  covers  only  the  finances  of  the  central\nGovernment. The matter regarding similar legislation at the state level will be pursued by the\nrespective  state  governments.  The  bill  proposes  to  eliminate  the  revenue  deficit  and\nprogressively  reduce  the  fiscal  deficit  to  not  more  than  2  percent  of  GDP  within  five  years\nfollowing the promulgation of the law. It will also contain public indebtedness by specifying that\nwithin  10  years,  the  total  liabilities  (including  external  debt  at  current  exchange  rate)  will  not\nexceed 50 percent of GDP. The Government will also cease any form of direct borrowing from\nRBI  after  three  years  except  in  specified  emergencies.  The  Government  will  also  not  extend\nguarantees to projects beyond 0.5 percent of GDP in any given financial year. Fiscal reform will\nhave crucial implications for the sustainability of infrastructure development in the country.\n\n57.\nLabor  Reform.  Labor  concern  is  one  of  the  major  constraints  to  privatization  and\ngreater  private  sector  participation  in  infrastructure  and  industry  in  India,  but  is  being  given\nserious  attention  apparently  only  now.  The  finance  minister,  in  a  recent  speech,  noted  that\nlabor  market  rigidity  needs  to  be  addressed  in  order  to  promote  industrial  investments.\nConsequently,  the  scope  for  permitting  termination  of  workers  is  to  be  expanded  by  allowing\n\n\f14\n\nemployers of specified industrial establishments with 1,000 or more employees, instead of the\nearlier  100,  to  lay  off,  retrench,  or  effect  business  closure  following  a  prescribed  procedure\nsubject  to  prior  Government  approval.  In  parallel,  the  separation  compensation  is  to  be\nincreased  from  15  days  to  45  days  for  every  completed  year  of  service.  Furthermore,  use  of\ncontract  labor  is  being  liberalized  by  allowing  unrestricted  outsourcing  of  activities.  In\nexchange, protection will be extended to workers by defining compensation for health, safety,\nwelfare,  and  social  security,  including  larger  compensation  for  retrenchment  based  on  last\ndrawn wages for every year of service. In March 2001, the Prime Minister stated that, although\ndifficult, the Government will push for the proposed labor reforms in the Union Budget as the\nmajority of the people desire it. The proposed amendments to the labor laws are expected to\nbe  introduced  in  Parliament.  Labor  market  reforms  have  favorable  implications  for  increased\nprivate sector activity and expansion.\n\nC. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n58.\nIndia is the World Bank\u2019s single largest borrower. The World Bank\u2019s cumulative lending\nto India as of June 2000 was over $47 billion in market-based loans from the International Bank\nfor  Reconstruction  and  Development  and  development  credits \nInternational\nDevelopment  Association.  Of  its  existing  portfolio  of  79  ongoing  projects  amounting  to  $11.5\nbillion, infrastructure, including energy, projects comprise 20 percent.\n\nfrom \n\nthe \n\n59.\nJapan and Germany are the other major contributors in the sector. Official development\nassistance  loan  commitments  by  Japan  have  steadily  increased  since  1990.  Japan  has\nemerged  as  the  largest  source  of  bilateral  assistance  to  India.  However,  due  to  economic\nmeasures in place since May 1998, only one new loan has been committed for the Bakreswar\nThermal  Power  Station  Unit\u20133  Extension  Project,  an  extension  of  the  ongoing  project.  As  of\nMarch  2000,  a  total  of  143  official  development  assistance  loans  had  been  committed  by  the\nJapan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  for  a  total  of  Y1,642  billion  (about  $13.7  billion).41\nInfrastructure support comprises about 61 percent of total commitment, with power and gas as\nthe main beneficiaries.\n\n60.\nThe  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau  (KfW)  has  extended  DM14  billion  (about  $6.5\nbillion)42 to India; India has become the largest partner for German financial cooperation funds.\nKfW\u2019s investments in infrastructure include assistance to SEBs for power sector reforms, Indian\nRailways,  and  minor  irrigation  schemes.  Lending  to  the  power  sector  totals  DM1,383  million\n(about  $631  million).  For  the  environment,  KfW  has  assisted  the  Indian  Renewable  Energy\nDevelopment Agency Ltd. with financing of renewable energy projects.\n\n61.\nThe  United  Kingdom's.  Department  for  International  Development  is  cofinancing  the\nWorld Bank\u2019s Economic Restructuring Program in AP and is looking at ADB\u2019s Public Resource\nManagement  Program  in  Madhya  Pradesh  for  possible  cofinancing.  Sweden\u2019s  assistance  to\ninfrastructure  is  through  a  combination  of  grants  and  loans  comprising  $70  million  for  one\nhydropower  project  and  $100  million  for  a  transmission  line  project.  Dutch  development\nassistance in infrastructure has been mainly for port development, water supply and sanitation,\npollution,  and  sewerage  treatment  facilities.  Currently,  assistance  is  being  provided  to  three\nstates in India: AP, Gujarat, and Kerala.\n\n                  \n41 $1=\u00a5 119.74 as of 1 October 2001.\n42 $1=DM2.1486 as 1 October 2001.\n\n\f15\n\nThe United States Agency for International Development's Financial institutions Reform\n62.\nand Expansion Project includes an element to enhance debt markets for municipal finance and,\nin this regard, provided TA for the issuance of municipal bonds to some municipal governments.\nThe  International  Finance  Corporation  recently  issued  a  guarantee  for  the  local  currency\nborrowings of the privatized distribution companies in Orissa.\n\nD. \n\nLessons Learned\n\nThe PSIF I was ADB's first facility established for private sector infrastructure financing\n63.\nand  development  through  Indian  financial  institutions.43  Much  of  the  analyses  and  findings  in\nthis report were gathered from feedback and dialogue with the participating and other financial\ninstitutions in India engaged in infrastructure financing.\n\n64.\nThrough  this  intervention,  financial  intermediaries  involved  were  anticipated  to  develop\ncapacity  to  undertake  the  financing  of  infrastructure  projects,  help  mobilize  resources  for\ninfrastructure development, develop innovative instruments and mechanisms for mitigating risks\nin  infrastructure  financing,  and  thereby  facilitate  private  sector  participation  in  infrastructure\nprojects in India.\n\n65.\nAmong Indian financial institutions, the two financial institutions involved under the PSIF\nI, ICICI and IFCI, together with the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) emerged as the\nlargest  financiers  of  infrastructure  in  India  since  1994,  with  the  most  rapid  growth  occurring\nbetween 1996 and 1998. Total disbursements during 1994/99 were approximately Rs206 billion\n(about  $4.3  billion),  of  which  power  projects  accounted  for  65  percent,  roads  and  ports  for  20\npercent, and telecommunications projects for 15 percent.44\n\n66.\nThe PSIF I has been 96 percent committed for eight ICICI projects (three in power, three\nin telecommunications, one in ports and one in roads) and for five IFCI projects (four in power\nand one in ports). Of the projects financed by ICICI, five have been completed, while three are\nin progress. For IFCI, three have been commissioned, while two are under implementation.\n\n67.\nAs required under the PSIF I, both ICICI and IFCI have set up separate dedicated units\nfor  infrastructure.  The  one  for  ICICI  was  set  up  in  1996  and  focuses  on  projects  in  power,\ntelecommunications, transport, and urban infrastructure. It has about 33 professionals in these\nsectors now undertaking various functions.\n\nToday, these infrastructure groups provide a complete range of financial services, from\n68.\nproject  identification  to  the  structuring  of  complex  project  finance  transactions.  Aside  from\nlending,  they  help  arrange  and  provide  advice  to  infrastructure  projects.  They  conduct  due\ndiligence  over  projects  to  be  financed,  and  help  identify  and  mitigate  project  risks.  Beyond\nproject  financing,  they  carry  out  policy  dialogue  with  the  central  and  state  governments\nregarding  issues  affecting  the  various  infrastructure  sectors.  ICICI,45  in  particular,  was\n\n                  \n\n43 The World Bank also provided a credit line under its Private Infrastructure Finance (IL&FS) Project  for $200 million\nin March 1996 for financing private urban infrastructure (water supply and sanitation and roads) projects. Out of the\ntotal line, only $30 million was reportedly disbursed. A number of reasons appear to account for this: (i) the limited\nnumber of eligible infrastructure sectors; (ii) more difficult environment for water supply and sanitation and the late\nreforms in roads, particularly the difficulty with land acquisition and long gestation period involved; and (iii) the more\nrigid structure of the credit line, as it can only be used as a loan, and all loans were subject to prior World Bank\napproval including requests for proposals.\n\n44 World Bank. 2000.

ICICI also set up special purpose vehicles in Kerala and West\nBengal to help develop infrastructure projects in partnership with the state governments but with\nunfavorable results.46\n\nICICI  was  actively \n\nin  preparing \n\ninvolved \n\n69.\nThe  PSIF  I  was  to  be  used  to  finance  debentures  issued  by  infrastructure  projects  to\nencourage  the  development  of  an  active  secondary  market  for  infrastructure  securities.  All\nfinanced eligible projects under the PSIF I have issued debentures. However, a market for these\nsecurities cannot be created until the infrastructure projects attain stable commercial operations.\nThe underlying securities of start-up infrastructure projects have to undergo \u201cseasoning\u201d prior to\nmarket  distribution.  The  existing  secondary  market  in  debt  securities  in  India  are  primarily  for\nAAA or at least AA+ rated securities at this time (a rating these infrastructure securities are not\nlikely  to  obtain  at  this  stage  as  they  are  still  perceived  to  be  high  risk).  Furthermore,  unrated\npapers are required to carry a 20 percent additional spread in the market in accordance with the\nstipulation  of  the  Fixed  Income  Money  Market  and  Derivatives  Association  based  on  their\nvaluation guidelines. Nonetheless, ICICI has been able to sell the debentures of some assisted\ninfrastructure  projects47  utilizing  pass-through  certificates  (PTCs)  issued  by  a  special  purpose\nvehicle  configured  as  a  trust,  typically  used  in  securitization  arrangements.  Nonetheless,  a\nstipulation  is  included  in  ICICI  and  IFCI\u2019s  loan  agreements  requiring  infrastructure  projects\nfinanced to list their debentures at the stock exchanges within two to three years from the start\nof regular commercial operations.\n\nICICI  is  today  active  in  the  corporate  debt  market.  It  has  a  trading  desk  with  an\n70.\naggregate  turnover  of  Rs37  billion  from  April  2000\u2013March  2001  and  average  outstanding  of\nRs4.6  billion.  It  has  been  engaged  in  constructive  dialogue  with  various  government  agencies\nand  has  provided  representation  in  various  committees  dealing  with  issues  on  capital  market\ndevelopment.\n\n71.\nHowever,  India\u2019s  long-term  debt  market  remains  underdeveloped  and  suffers  from  a\nnumber of impediments. It is still characterized by a small number of players, with very limited\nparticipation  by  long-term  market  participants  such  as  provident  funds  and  insurance\ncompanies;48  weak  secondary  market,49  hence  relatively  illiquid  market;  absence  of  a\nbenchmark yield curve; and inadequate support infrastructure.\n\nGiven  current  market  imperfections,  weak  capacity  and  lack  of  the  regulatory  and\n72.\ninstitutional structures, and standardized systems and processes at the state level, a project-to-\nproject  approach  to  infrastructure  development  is  not  likely  to  advance  private  sector\nparticipation significantly, certainly not to the extent that present Government plans envision.\n\n                  \n\n46 Many believe this outcome was the result of poor choice of states. Both Kerala and West Bengal had, at that time,\n\ncommunist-led governments with probably the least conducive environments for private sector investments.\n\n47 Jindal  Tractabel  Power  Company  Ltd.,  for  Rs650  million  and  for  Nandi  Highway  Developers  Ltd.,  two  issues  for\n\nRs324 million and Rs100 million.\n\n48 ADB is providing TA for development of provident funds and insurance systems under  TA 3367-IND: Reform of\nthe  Private  Pension  and  Provident  Funds  System  and  the  Employees\u2019  Provident  Fund  Organization,  for\n$1,000,000,  approved  on  26  December  1999;  and  TA  3460-IND: Policy and Operational Support and Capacity\nBuilding for the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority, for $800,000, approved on 22 June 2000.\n\n49 A  study  is  also  being  undertaken  by  ADB  under  TA  3473-IND:  Development of Secondary Debt Market,  for\n\n$600,000, approved on 28 July 2000.\n\n\fE. \n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n\n17\n\n73.\nIndia\u2019s  economic  success  over  the  medium  term  will  depend  in  large  part  on  the\nGovernment\u2019s  ability  to  address  structural  weaknesses,  particularly  in  the  infrastructure  sector\nand in public finances. In key areas of the economy, particularly in power, roads, and transport,\ninvestments have failed to keep pace with economic need and their apparent lack is impeding\nthe transition to a more sustainable and poverty reducing growth path. Given the considerable\nresource  requirement  in  infrastructure  and  the  significant  recurring  drain  on  public  finances  of\ninefficient public structures in various infrastructure sectors, the central and state governments\nwill need to (i) promote greater private sector involvement and encourage commercialization by\nevolving  the  long-term  framework  and  policy  incentive  mechanism  for  private  initiatives  and\ninvestment,  (ii)  strengthen  policy  coordination  among  government  agencies,  and  (iii)  enhance\nthe  availability  of  long-term  domestic  funding.  The  objectives  and  design  of  the  PSIF  II  are\nconsistent  with  ADB\u2019s  sector  strategy.  ADB  assistance  in  infrastructure  to  India  is  shown  in\nAppendix 3.\n\nF. \n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\n74.\nPolicy dialogue has been active in all areas of infrastructure sector involvement by ADB,\nboth  at  the  national  and  state  levels.  This  is  carried  out  by  various  missions  and  ADB\u2019s  India\nResident Mission. State operations have allowed ADB to interact closely with state governments\nin  pursuing  reforms  and  in  bringing  ADB\u2019s  cross-cutting  concerns  to  the  forefront.  Periodic\nreviews  have  been  carried  out  under  PSIF  I  and  the  results  of  these  missions  have  been\ndiscussed  with  the  financial  institutions  involved  and  the  Government.  Concerns  by  ICICI  and\nIFCI relating to policy and public-private interface issues discussed with ADB arising out of their\ninfrastructure operations and capital market activities have been relayed to and discussed with\nthe Government.\n\nIn particular, ADB\u2019s role in capital market development has led to its close involvement in\n75.\nimportant  areas  of  capital  market  operations,  such  as  provident  funds  reform  and  insurance\nsector liberalization; in the recent past, these were highly protected areas.\n\nThe  PSIF  II  was  closely  coordinated  with  various  donor  agencies  engaged  in\n76.\ninfrastructure financing in India, particularly the World Bank that has been cooperating with ADB\non state level interventions. Based on these consultations, there appeared to be a high level of\nsupport for ADB assistance to private infrastructure in India. ADB has been a major provider of\ndevelopment assistance for promoting private sector participation in infrastructure development.\n\nIV. \n\nTHE PARTICIPATING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS\n\nTwo national financial institutions will be the Borrowers for the PSIF II: IL&FS and IDBI.\n77.\nBoth  institutions  have  solid  backgrounds  in  infrastructure  financing.  The  two  PFIs  can  easily\nabsorb the loans being provided. IDBI has a long history of dealings with ADB, while IL&FS, in\nparticular,  is  specifically  mandated  to  promote  infrastructure  projects  in  India  on  a  commercial\nbasis. During PSIF II effectiveness, both PFIs will comply with prudential norms to ensure their\ncontinued sound operation. These prudential norms will include (i) a capital adequacy ratio of 9\npercent based on guidelines, as amended from time to time, established by the RBI; (ii) a debt\nservice  coverage  ratio  of  not  less  than  1.1  times;  and  (iii)  compliance  with  the  prudential\nguidelines of RBI, and those laid down from time to time, in particular, regarding the recognition\nof income, classification of assets, and debt provisioning.\n\n\f18\n\nA. \n\nInfrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Limited\n\n78.\nIL&FS  has  been  quite  active  at  the  state  level  and  has  existing  memorandums  of\nagreement with various state governments to implement specific projects: in AP, in partnership\nwith  the  AP  Industrial  Infrastructure  Corporation,  the  nodal  agency  for  dealing  with  the  private\nsector;  in  Gujarat,  under  a  technical  collaboration  with  the  Gujarat  Industrial  Investment\nCorporation  and  agreements  to  undertake  various  toll  road  projects;  in  Madhya  Pradesh,  to\nundertake  various  toll  road  and  water  supply  projects  (the  Rau-Pithampur  road  In  Madhya\nPradesh was one of the first projects to be undertaken by IL&FS). It has existing arrangements\nin Bihar, Orissa, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, and Uttar Pradesh for various projects. It has (i) taken\na number of new intiatives to facilitate the financing of infrastructure, among them, the setting up\nof a project development fund in May 2000 to assist with project development; (ii) partnered with\nthe  states  using  a  strategic  alliance  format  it  calls  project  development  and  promotion\npartnership; and (iii) pioneered the use of new instruments for raising financing for infrastructure\nprojects such as deep discount bonds and cumulative convertible preference shares. Among its\nshareholders are the International Finance Corporation, ORIX Corporation of Japan, and Credit\nCommercial de France. IL&FS had total assets of Rs33.6 billion (about $703 million) in FY2001,\nan  increase  from  about  Rs15.4  billion  (about  $322  million)  in  FY1996.  Net  worth  rose  from\nRs3.7  billion  (about  $77  million)  to  Rs6.4  billion  (about  $134  million)  during  the  same  period.\nCapital  adequacy  stood  at  16.3  percent  as  of  31  March  2001.  More  detailed  background  on\nIL&FS is given in Supplementary Appendix B.\n\nB. \n\nIndustrial Development Bank of India\n\nIDBI is a statutory organization operating under its own act. In 1994, IDBI was permitted\n79.\nto  float  its  shares  in  the  market  and  as  of  June  2000,  the  central  Government  decreased  its\nshareholdings to 58.0 percent; the rest were held by the public as IDBI is publicly listed. It is one\nof the largest infrastructure financiers in India. It has approved 51 independent power projects\nwith a total capacity of 20,049 MW. In telecommunications, it has provided financial support to\n11 cellular operators and four basic operators. It has financed private road and port projects in\nAP,  Gujarat,  Karnataka,  Maharashtra,  Orissa,  Rajasthan,  Tamil  Nadu,  and  Uttar  Pradesh.\nHowever,  unlike  IL&FS,  it  is  less  actively  engaged  in  direct  initiatives  at  the  state  level  on\ninfrastructure financing and development. Nonetheless, it has agreed to work closely with IL&FS\nand  the  selected  states  participating  under  the  PSIF  II.  At  the  national  level,  it  organizes\nworkshops on infrastructure issues constraining the flow of investments to infrastructure sectors.\nIDBI has been the premier long-term financing institution in India for several decades. Many of\nthe key officers of other financial institutions in India were trained at IDBI. It has sponsored the\norganization  of  a  number  of  major  institutions  in  the  financial  markets;  it  played  a  key  role  in\nforming  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India  (the  capital  market  regulator),  National\nStock Exchange, National Securities Depository Ltd., the OTC Exchange of India, etc. It is also\none  of  the  promoters  of  IDFC.  IDBI  is  undergoing  restructuring  and  is  positioning  itself  to\nbecome a universal bank to improve its future competitiveness, both by enhancing its ability to\naccess  lower  cost  deposit  funds  and  expanding  its  products,  services,  and  network.  IDBI  has\nretained the services of Boston consulting group to prepare a detailed plan for organization and\nbusiness  restructuring  to  transform  it  into  a  globally  competitive  universal  bank.  IDBI  has  also\nretained  the  services  of  Arthur  Andersen,  as  consultants,  to  advise  it  on  asset-liability\nmanagement policies and procedures based on international best practices. ADB's association\nwith IDBI dates to November 1987 when the first ADB loan of $100 million was sanctioned for\nonlending  to  small-and  medium-sized  industries.  In  December  1994,  ADB  approved  a  second\nline for $150 million to improve the energy efficiency of selected industries in India by upgrading\n\n\f19\n\nand modernizing technology. Both projects have been satisfactorily implemented. IDBI had total\nassets  of  approximately  Rs718  billion  (about  $15  billion)  as  of  31  March  2001  compared  with\nRs444  billion  (about  $9  billion)  in  FY1996.  Net  worth  increased  from  Rs65  billion  (about  $1.4\nbillion)  to  Rs92  billion  (about  $2  billion)  in  FY2001.  However,  in  view  of  the  current  economic\ndownturn, net profit declined to Rs6.9 billion (about $144 million) from Rs9.5 billion (about $200\nmillion) in the previous year, partly due to a rising level of nonperforming assets that rose as a\npercentage of total assets at 14.8 percent as of 3 March 2001. Capital adequacy nonetheless\nremains satisfactory at 15.8 percent. (Supplementary Appendix C provides more details)\n\nV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE\n\nA. \n\nProposed Financing\n\n80.\nThe PSIF II comprises two separate loans of $100 million each to IL&FS and IDBI. Each\nPFI will use the funds to finance infrastructure projects, that are 51 percent majority owned by\nthe  private  sector,  in  specified  sectors  in  four  selected  states  (see  paras.103-105)  at  market\nrates  corresponding  to  rupee  loans.  Each  PFI  is  required  to  hedge  the  foreign  currency\nproceeds  of  the  PSIF  II  to  cover  the  foreign  exchange  risk,  and  provide  financing  to\ninfrastructure projects in local currency.\n\nFurthermore,  due  to  difficult  market  conditions  and  the  need  to  tailor-fit  financial\n81.\npackages to suit individual projects and to meet varying risk requirements, the PSIF II may be\nutilized flexibly to finance different types of debt instruments (marketable securities) other than\nequity  shares,  such  as  subordinated  and  convertible  debentures50  and  deep  discount  bonds.\nThe  PFIs  have  effectively  utilized  such  hybrid  instruments.  The  proceeds  from  the  sale  or\nredemption  of  long-term  securities  issued  by  infrastructure  projects  financed  through  subloans\nunder  the  PSIF  II  will  be  used  to  purchase  other  long-term  securities  of  eligible  infrastructure\nprojects within the terms of the facility. However, during the interim period prior to reinvestment\nof  proceeds,  such  proceeds  may  be  temporarily  reinvested  in  government  securities,  reserve-\neligible  securities,  prime  commercial  banks,  or  AAA-rated51  securities.  If  the  PFI  is  unable  to\nreinvest  such  proceeds  in  any  eligible  infrastructure  project  within  24  months,  the  loan  will  be\nprepaid to ADB subject to the terms of ADB's Libor-based lending facility.\n\nB. \n\nRationale\n\n82.\nUntil  purely  market-based  solutions  become  feasible  in  India,  a  proactive  approach\nwithin an integrated framework to create an enabling environment for private sector participation\nin infrastructure development will be required based on public-private partnerships involving no\nless than the state governments, and state and national financial institutions.\n\nFurthermore,  attempts  to  resolve  the  constraints  to  infrastructure  development  on  a\n83.\nnational scale in India would be unrealistic. Instead, the PSIF II proposes to demonstrate how\nthese  constraints  may  be  addressed  at  the  state  level  based  on  the  experiences  of  selected,\nmore progressive Indian states in infrastructure development and on best practice. By focusing\nassistance to a few selected states, the PSIF II could help institutionalize state performance as\na  key  factor  in  credit  evaluation  by  Indian  financial  institutions,  in  the  credit  rating  of\ninfrastructure  and  industrial  projects  (particularly,  those  backed  by  state  guarantees),  in  the\n\n                  \n\n50 The conversion of a debenture issue into equity will be treated as a sale under the facility and an equal amount of\n\nfunds will be allocated to finance other qualified infrastructure projects.\n\n51 Indicating highest investment grade and safety.\n\n\f20\n\nprovision  of  central  Government  guarantees  for  state  obligations,  and  consequently,  in\ncatalyzing  the  flow  of  resources  to  progressive,  performing  states,  and  in  helping  establish  an\nappropriate  incentive  structure  for  other  Indian  states  to  improve  performance,  and  hopefully,\npursue required reforms. The PSIF II also promotes the cross-fertilization of ideas among Indian\nstates  for  each  state  to  benefit  from  the  experiences  and  innovative  approaches  that  have\nproved  effective  in  developing  the  infrastructure  sectors  of  progressive  states.  It  also  helps\nthese  states  rationalize  incentives.  Competing  on  the  basis  of  nonperformance-based  tax\nincentives, for example, has only led to losses in tax revenues without any significant gains in\nadditional  investments  for  certain  states.  ADB  assistance  has  also  been  targeted  to  support\ngreater private sector involvement in infrastructure sectors where reforms are being undertaken.\n\nC. \n\nMechanics of the Facility\n\n84.\nThe  market  for  long-term  debt  securities  and  the  market  for  hedging  foreign  exchange\nrisk are at the early stages of development. Nonetheless, a number of alternative approaches\nare  open  to  the  PFIs  for  meeting  ADB's  requirement  of  applying  the  PSIF  II  proceeds  to\npurchase  marketable  securities  issued  by,  and  hedging  the  foreign  exchange  exposure  of,\ninfrastructure projects. These would, however, necessarily involve flexible arrangements.\n\n1. \n\nMechanisms for Issuing Marketable Securities\n\n85.\nOption  1.  The  PFI  swaps  the  PSIF  II  foreign  exchange  proceeds  into  rupees  with  an\navailable  counterparty  and  uses  the  rupees  to  purchase  an  equivalent  amount  of  marketable\nsecurities from infrastructure projects. These securities will be denominated in local rupees and\npriced according to market rates for rupee securities. This would require repricing or refinancing\nof the securities every seven years or so, as swaps do not stretch beyond these periods in the\ncurrent swap market in India. This is the procedure illustrated in Figure 1.\n\nOption 2. The PFI provides the PSIF II foreign exchange proceeds to the infrastructure\n86.\nproject  as  a  loan.52  To  comply  with  the  ADB  requirement,  a  parallel  issue  of  rupee  securities\n(managed by the PFI) is made for an amount equivalent to the PSIF loan. Such rupee securities\ncan  be  made  mainly  from  the  local  debt  component  of  the  total  financing  requirement  of  the\ninfrastructure  project.  Since  most  projects  would  have  a  significant  local  debt  component,  this\noption  would  not  pose  an  implementation  problem.  The  only  constraint  would  be  the  credit\nexposure  limit  of  the  PFI  to  single  borrowers  if  the  PFI  is  unable  to  sell  the  securities  in  the\nsecondary market and ends up holding the securities itself. Under this option, in the event that\nthe rupee securities are redeemed within three years from the date of issue, the PFI is obligated\nto redeploy the proceeds of the redemption to purchase other long-term securities from eligible\ninfrastructure projects.\n\n52 The infrastructure project may arrange its own foreign exchange swap or a suitable foreign exchange cover itself at\n\n                  \n\na later date.\n\n\fFigure 1: Mechanics of the PSIFII\n\nGovernment\n\nGuarantee\n\nG\n\nu\nara\n\nnte\n\ne F\ne\n\ne\n\n     Swap\nCounterparty\n\nn   P r o\n\na\n\no\n\nS I F   L\n\nP\n\ns\n\nd\n\ne\n\ne\n\nc\n\ns\n\n I n   R\n\nIn Rs\n\nAsian\nDevelopment\nBank\n\nPSIF Loan Proceeds\n\nPSIF Repayment\n\nParticipating\n  Financial\n Institutions\n\nInfrastructure\n     Project\n\nMarketable Securities\n\n2\n1\n\n      Rs\nInvestment\n\n      Rs\nMarketable\nSecurities\n\nInvestor\n\nIndicative Cost Structure (%)\nSix-Month LIBOR     2. 64*\nADB Spread             0 .60\nFont-End fee             0.10\n                                 3.34\nGovernment\nGuarantee Fee        0.60\n                                3.94\n\nPFI Spread              3.00\n   6.94\n\nSwap Rate              6.00 (long-run estimate)\nTotal                     12.94\n\nADB        = Asian Development Bank\nLIBOR     = London interbank offered rate\nPFI          = participating financial institutions\nPSIF II    = Private Sector Infrastructure Facility at State Level\nRs           = Indian Rupee\n\n* as of 1 October 2001.\n\n\f22\n\nOption  3.  The  PFI  lends  the  PSIF  II  foreign  exchange  proceeds  to  infrastructure\n87.\nprojects, against which the infrastructure projects issue rupee securities. Foreign exchange risk\nwill be borne by the infrastructure projects.53 Any difference arising from exchange fluctuations\n(on  principal  and  interest)  between  the  foreign  currency-denominated  loan  and  the  rupee\nsecurities will be repaid by the infrastructure project to the PFI separately at every due date. The\nPFI  can  price  the  rupee  securities  on  the  basis  of  discounts  against  the  rate  on  the  foreign\ncurrency-denominated loan in the secondary market.\n\nOption 4. The PFI provides a foreign exchange or rupee loan to an infrastructure project\n88.\nto  finance  project  construction,  but  the  project  may  be  relatively  unknown  in  the  market  and\nwould be unable to obtain an acceptable credit rating for its securities issue during this period.\nThe  PFI  may  trade  the  securities  on  the  secondary  market  on  a  with-recourse  basis  (i.e.,\nagainst the guarantee of the PFI), or the PFI may securitize the loan after the project achieves\nnormal operation and is able to obtain an acceptable rating.\n\n89.\nOption  5.  The  PFIs  can  sell  the  debentures  of  assisted  infrastructure  projects  utilizing\nPTCs issued by a special purpose vehicle configured as a trust, typically used in securitization\narrangements. PTCs are issued to investors in return for revocable contributions made by them\nto the special purpose vehicle. The PTCs are essentially in the form of zero coupon instruments\nand are issued at a discount to face value and redeemed at par. The PTCs represent beneficial\ninterest  by  the  investors  in  the  cash  flows  arising  from  the  debentures.  Nonetheless,  a\nstipulation  will  be  included  in  the  loan  agreements  that  would  require  infrastructure  projects\nfinanced to list their debentures at the stock exchanges within two to three years from the start\nof regular commercial operations.\n\n2. \n\nHedging Mechanisms\n\nOption  A.  Obtain  a  forward  cover.  Large  commercial  banks  provide  forward  covers,\n\n90.\nlimited as to amount and tenor.\n\n91.\nOption  B.  Swap  the  foreign  exchange  liability.  India  has  a  nascent  market  for  this\nproduct, with a great deal of interest in such structures. Pricing is still on a negotiated basis in\nthe  absence  of  dealers  or  market-makers.  Nevertheless,  a  bidding  process  normally  ensures\nfine  pricing.  Counterparties  are  confined  to  highly  rated  entities.  The  existing  swap  market  is\nlimited to seven years, which means the interest rate will have to be reset every seven years or\nthe  period  of  each  swap.  Nonetheless,  most  projects  envisaged  would  have  income  streams\nthat would adjust with inflation. Hence, interest rate resetting may be offset over time and should\nnot pose considerable risk.\n\n92.\nOption  C.  Use  an  Internal  swap.  The  PFI  will  switch  the  use  of  the  foreign  exchange\nproceeds  to  clients  requiring  foreign  exchange  with  available  hedges  (i.e.,  exporters)  and\nprovide a matching loan in rupees to the infrastructure project.\n\n93.\n\nOption D. In some cases, a combination may be required.\n\n94.\nOn the secondary market, the securities can be sold to various investors under a variety\nof  terms  that  can  meet  diverse  requirements,  such  as  (i)  on  agreements  to  repurchase  for\ninvestors  that  may  wish  to  have  the  securities  redeemed  and  funds  available  at  some  future\n\n                  \n\n53 Until a foreign exchange swap or cover is arranged. In most cases, contractual arrangements by subloans allow\n\nrecovery of reasonable costs arising from currency devaluation.\n\n\f23\n\ndate to meet temporary liquidity needs; (ii) on a with-recourse basis, to substitute the PFIs credit\nfor  the  credit  of  the  underlying  infrastructure  project  if  investors  are  unfamiliar  with  the\ninfrastructure  project;  and  (iii)  on  straight-to-maturity,  without-recourse  basis  to  mutual  funds,\ninsurance  companies,  and  other  financial  institutions  that  have  the  capacity  for  holding  these\nsecurities on a long-term basis. Under prevailing requirements, debt securities with more than\n18 months maturity publicly offered in India's capital market require a credit rating.54 This would\nadd to the safety of these instruments to be floated on the secondary market. The PFI may also\nissue its own negotiable long-term promissory notes or bonds or other form of securities on the\ncapital market to refinance outstanding securities of infrastructure subloans depending upon its\ncapital  adequacy  ratio.  As  has  been  done,  PTCs  may  be  utilized  through  special  purpose\nvehicles for tapping domestic funds (para. 69)\n\n3. \n\nThe Incentive Structure\n\n95.\nPerformance-based  criteria  are  incorporated  in  the  design  of  the  PSIF  II:  (i)  eligibility\ncriteria were formulated (Appendix 4) to select the four specific states, (ii) Access Criteria to the\nPSIF  II  were  identified  for  the  selected  states  to  ensure  commitment  to  sustained  support  for\nprivate sector participation and development of the enabling environment (Appendix 5), and (iii)\nContinued  Access  Criteria  to  the  PSIF  II  benchmark  progress  of  state  policy  reforms  in\ndeveloping the enabling environment for private sector participation (Appendix 6). These criteria\nwill  form  the  basis  of  ADB  policy  dialogue  with  the  selected  states  to  promote  infrastructure\ndevelopment,  increase  private  sector  participation,  and  ensure  that  infrastructure  projects\nmaterialize that will allow the PSIF II to be effectively utilized.\n\nTo  encourage  the  selected  states  to  accelerate  reforms,  the  PSIF  II  will  be  made\n96.\navailable as a two-tranche facility. The first tranche will be made available upon fulfillment of the\nAccess Criteria and will be a preallocated amount of $20 million dedicated for the financing of\nqualified infrastructure projects in each of the four selected states comprising 40 percent of the\nfacility (para. 125). A midterm review on or about two years from the date of loan effectiveness\nwill be undertaken by ADB with the participation of the selected states and PFIs concerning the\nprogress in fulfilling the Continued Access Criteria and continuing pipeline of bankable projects\nin each state. Any uncommitted portion of the preallocated amounts in the first tranche after the\nmidterm review will revert back to the funds facility pool comprising the balance of the loans to\neach PFI. These funds will become available to other selected states. The second tranche will\nbe unallocated and will be provided on a competitive basis upon satisfactory review by ADB of\nsubstantial progress by selected states in meeting the Continued Access Criteria. The proposed\nADB  TA  (see  paras.160-162)  will  provide  expert  support  to  help  each  selected  state  pursue\npolicy and operational changes envisaged under the Continued Access Criteria.\n\n97.\nHowever,  as  the  PSIF  II  is  a  project  facility,  release  of  the  second  tranche  will  be\naccelerated if projects materialize more quickly than expected. The operation of private sector-\nled  projects  should  take  priority  as  they  are  of  considerable  value  in  demonstrating  the\neffectiveness of commercially run operations in improving sector efficiency and in advancing the\npublic-private  interface.  If,  on  the  other  hand,  funds  remain  unutilized  and  market  feedback\nindicates the PFIs and selected states are making no progress in bringing infrastructure projects\nto financial closure, ADB can accelerate the midterm review and take corrective steps of either\nexpanding the number of selected states and/or increasing the sectoral scope of the facility. On\nthe other hand, during the midterm review, if ADB\u2019s review reveals that the Continued Access\n\n                  \n\n54 India has three credit-rating agencies: Credit Rating and Information Services of India Ltd., in which the ADB has\nan equity investment; Investment Information and Credit Rating Agency of India Ltd.; and Credit and Research Ltd.\n\n\f24\n\nCriteria have not been substantially met and/or sectoral policy reforms55 have been reversed or\nsubstantially  diluted,  then  in  consultation  with  the  PFIs,  ADB  may,  after  the  midterm  review,\nadmit other Indian state(s) to participate under the PSIF II if they meet the eligibility criteria, fulfill\nthe  Access  Criteria,  and  commit  to  undertake  the  Continued  Access  Criteria  or  substitute  any\nselected state with such other eligible state(s). If necessary, ADB may also expand the scope of\nthe  eligible  sectors  for  financing  after  the  midterm  review.  This  is  also  designed  to  provide\nflexibility to the facility and address concerns by the PFIs that continue to pay commitment fees\non  their  loans,  should  infrastructure  projects  in  selected  states  prove  slow  in  materializing.\nAppendix 7 provides the design of the incentive structure of the PSIF II.\n\n98.\nAccordingly,  funds  under  the  PSIF  II  allocated  under  the  first  tranche  will  be  made\navailable for two years for commitment and for five years for disbursement for each state from\nthe  date  of  loan  effectiveness  and  any  uncommitted  balance  under  the  first  tranche  will  be\nreallocated  to  the  funds  project  facility  pool  after  the  lapse  of  two  years.  The  second  tranche,\nwhose  use  may  be  accelerated  depending  upon  the  speed  with  which  the  PFIs  and  selected\nstates  are  able  to  execute  private  infrastructure  projects,  will  have  a  term  not  exceeding  four\nyears for commitment and five years for disbursement from the date of loan effectiveness.\n\n99.\nThe PSIF II will concentrate on only four states because (i) resources of the PFIs under\nthe  PSIF  II  are  limited  and  increasing  the  number  of  states  would  spread  their  resources  too\nthinly;  (ii)  other  states  apparently  at  a  low  state  of  readiness  are  to  accommodate  the  criteria\nspecified  under  the  PSIF  II;  (iii)  the  size  of  the  facility  is  limited  relative  to  state  financing\nrequirements to make it attractive for states to participate; and (iv) effective supervision of the\nPSIF II must be ensured.\n\n100.\nTo improve the public-private interface and facilitate project processing, each state has\nidentified  formal  structures56  mandated  to  deal  with  the  private  sector  and  act  as  one-stop\nfacilities  that  could  provide  clearances  for,  approve,  license,  and  grant  incentives  to\ninfrastructure projects in coordination with line ministries. The same entity would interface with\nproject  developers  and  sponsors  by  (i)  identifying  priority  sectors  and  specific  projects  for\ndevelopment, (ii) conducting bidding, and (iii) awarding projects.\n\n101.  The  PSIF  II  will  be  coursed  through  two  national  level  financial  institutions,  IL&FS  and\nIDBI  (see  paras.  77-79  and  supplementary  appendixes  B  and  C  provide  descriptions  of  their\noperations).57  IL&FS  and  IDBI  were  not  participating  financial  institutions  under  PSIF  I.  Their\nparticipation in the PSIF II will hopefully help spread the benefits of ADB assistance. The choice\nof  national  financial  institutions  rather  than  state  financial  institutions  to  implement  the  project\nfacility was prompted by (i) the need to mobilize resources on a larger and wider scale to meet\nlarge  infrastructure  development  requirements  and  (ii)  by  their  greater  absorptive  capacities.\nUnder the PSIF II, the PFIs are asked to seek an active partnership with state governments in\nundertaking  infrastructure  projects.  In  particular,  to  provide  support  for  the  structuring,\ndevelopment, and financial engineering of infrastructure projects. Often the problem is not lack\nof  projects  (the  shelf  of  projects  for  development  is  substantial)  but  lack  of  bankable  projects\nthat  financial  institutions  are  prepared  to  finance  or  invest  in,  and  that  private  sponsors  find\n\n                  \n\n55 Essentially as defined in policy reform programs with ADB and the World Bank.\n56 The Gujarat Infrastructure Development Board, which carries out these functions in Gujarat was established with\nADB assistance under TA 2716-IND: Institutional Strengthening of the Gujarat Infrastructure Development Board,\nfor $850,000, approved on 18 December 1996.\n\n57 The  Infrastructure  Development  Finance  Company  also  considered  participating  but  could  not  justify  additional\n\nborrowings even of longer maturity, at this time as it has excess funds (estimated at about $300 million).\n\n\f25\n\nattractive from a risk-return standpoint. This will help accelerate the transfer of technology due\nto the low level of capacity of state institutions to undertake project development.\n\n102.\nFunding for project development is a major constraint. IL&FS has established a project\ndevelopment  fund  that  operates  like  a  venture  capital  fund  and  asked  ADB  to  consider\nparticipating.  Other  initiatives  are  being  undertaken  to  fill  identified  financing  gaps.  In  Gujarat,\nIDFC  together  with  the  AIG  Group  of  the  United  States  and  the  Gujarat  Industrial  Investment\nCorporation  Ltd.  have  formed  an  asset  management  company  that  is  now  in  the  process  of\nsetting up equity and debt funds to invest in and finance infrastructure projects58 that will be set\nup in Gujarat. To cover identified market risks, IDFC in discussions with ADB indicated it would\nlike to pursue the setting up of a guarantee fund with ADB dedicated to infrastructure projects59\n(Supplementary  Appendix  D  provides  the  proposed  structure  for  promoting  private  sector\nparticipation at the state level under the PSIF II).\n\n4. \n\nScope of the Facility\n\nThe choice of Infrastructure sectors to be financed aims to support reforms and reflects\n\n103.\nthe projected infrastructure demand at the state level to facilitate loan utilization:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nin the power sector, power distribution and transmission projects for privatization\nand  privately  sponsored  projects,  including  the  modernization  and  upgrading  of\nexisting privately owned power projects including generation;\nstate  roads  on  build,  own,  operate  (BOO);  BOT;  and  similar  arrangements  with\nidentified provision for maintenance;\nprivately run urban mass transit systems;\n\n(iii) \n(iv)  minor ports under private concession where connectivity is clear;\n(v) \n\nthat  are  privately \n\nfiber  cable  connections \n\noptic \ntelecommunication projects where commercial financing is readily available;\nairports, with services under private management or for privatization;\nprivatized water supply and sanitation services or services that are under private\nconcessions;\ncyberparks for private companies; and\nspecial economic zones.\n\nfunded  but  not  private\n\n(vi) \n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n(ix) \n\n104.\nIncluded  within  the  scope  of  the  PSIF  II  for  financing  are  infrastructure  and\ninfrastructure-related projects considered priorities by the selected states. These include urban\nmass  transit  systems,  optic  fiber  cable  connections,  cyberparks,  and  special  economic  zones\n(SEZs).  India  has  23  metropolitan  cities  and  the  number  is  likely  to  increase  to  40.  Citywide\nstudies  were  carried  out  on  how  to  relieve  congestion  and  improve  efficiency  of  transport  in\nAhmedabad,  Bangalore,  Bhubaneswar,  Chennai,  Cuttack,  Delhi,  Hyderabad,  Jaipur,  Jammu,\nKolkata,  Lucknow,  Mumbai,  Nagpur,  Surat,  and  Vijayawada.  Private  investment  in  mass  rapid\ntransit  systems  is  being  sought.  Due  to  the  prohibitive  cost  of  such  systems  and  affordability\nissues,  planned  systems  are  rail-based  using  existing  rail  right-of-way  based  on  electrical\npower. AP, Gujarat, and Karnataka are pursuing initiatives to set up these mass transit systems\n\n                  \n\nat the state level.\n\n58 ADB was also asked to participate. International Finance Corporation indicated interest in considering equity funds\n\n59 In terms of disaggregating project risks, this vehicle was suggested by ADB to be worth exploring to cover the risk\nof  infrastructure  projects  during  the  period  of  preparation  and  construction,  typically  the  first  five  years,  that\nfinancial institutions were reluctant to take. Financial institutions were willing to take the commercial risks once the\nproject becomes operational.\n\n\f26\n\nin  their  capital  cities  at  Ahmedabad,  Bangalore,  and  Hyderabad.  Optic  fiber  connections  by\nlaying  undersea  cables  are  being  contemplated  in  AP  to  connect  to  Malaysia  and  will  be\nspearheaded by Malaysian strategic partners. Traffic between India and the West is substantial,\nbut  traffic  to  the  East  is  still  not  as  developed.  The  development  of  cyberparks  is  part  of  the\ninformation  technology  policy  of  AP  and  Karnataka.  As  software  leaders  in  India,  more\ncyberparks  are  being  contemplated  where  infrastructure  development  would  be  substantial.  In\nthe same vein, SEZs are being set up in AP, Gujarat, Karnataka, and Madhya Pradesh with the\nrelated  private  infrastructure.  In  May  2000,  the  Government  has  announced  a  new  policy\nframework  for  SEZs  designed  to  compete  for  benefits  from  foreign  investments.  Studies  have\nbeen  conducted  on  SEZs  operating  successfully  in  other  countries,  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of\nChina,  in  particular.  These  SEZs  are  also  being  established  in  concert  with  port  development\nplans.  Supplementary  Appendix  G  provides  the  pipeline  project  likely  to  be  available  for\nfinancing under the PSIF II during 2001-03.\n\n5. \n\nSelected States\n\nThe  four  selected  states  for  the  PSIF  II  are  AP,  Gujarat,  Karnataka,  and  Madhya\n105.\nPradesh.  Selection  was  based  on:  (i)  the  feedback  received  by  ADB  missions  from  various\nsectors,  including  credit-rating  agencies  and  PFIs;  (ii)  ADB  missions'  own  assessments  and\ninternal  consultations;  (iii)  findings  of  a  World  Bank  survey60  being  undertaken  with  the\nConfederation of Indian Industry on State Investment Climate; and (iv) results of a recent survey\n\u2014 The Best States to Invest In\u2014undertaken by the Business Times of India61 .\n\n106. Gujarat  and  Maharashtra62  are  considered  to  be  the  \"best\"  states.  However,  many  felt\nthat reforms have been faltering in Maharashtra. The Enron Dhabol Power Project dispute has\nbeen cited as a factor. Business Times cited the deterioration of Maharashtra\u2019s revenue, which\nis  now  in  deficit  of  Rs80  billion  vis-\u00e0-vis  a  revenue  surplus  in  1994/95.  The  next  best  states\ncomprise  AP,  Karnataka,  and  Tamil  Nadu  (in  the  World  Bank  survey)  plus  Kerala  and\nPondicherry63 (in the Business Times survey). Kerala is a focal state for ADB, but reforms have\nyet to progress and the scope is limited for private infrastructure investments at this time. Tamil\nNadu,64 on the other hand, was one of two states that refused to revise the power tariff for its\nagriculture sector.\n\n107. Madhya  Pradesh's  experience  in  program  implementation  is  regarded  as  very\ninnovative.  Mainly  due  to  the  initiatives  of  its  chief  minister,  the  state  has  implemented\n\n                  \n\n60 Initial findings were discussed by David Dollar (World Bank) in his presentation on Trade, Growth and Poverty for\nthe Asia and Pacific Forum on Poverty, Asian Development Bank. February 2001. The World Bank survey covers a\nsample size of 1,032 firms, with 300 more to be added. It contains 152 questions but generally asks which the best\nand worst states are for investment and what the cost advantages and disadvantages are for moving into the best\nand worst states. It also seeks to clarify perception versus reality by measuring actual investments and undertaking\ntotal factor productivity studies. The final draft is targeted for the last quarter of 2001.\n\n61 The Business Times-Gallup survey started in 1995 is based on the responses of chief executive officers (CEOs) of\nmanufacturing  and  service  companies.  The  survey  has  two  objectives:  (i)  identify  and  rank  the  parameters\nemployed by corporations to determine which state to locate their projects in, and (ii) to use these parameters to\nrank Indian states regarding their investment attractiveness. In 1997, Business Times expanded the methodology\nby including objective data that now includes fiscal performance and degree of financial development in the state.\nData  for  five  broad  categories  are  collected  (i)  physical  infrastructure,  (ii)  governance,  (iii)  labor,  (iv)  financial\ninfrastructure, and (v) social infrastructure.\n\n62 Also Goa in the Business Times-Gallup survey, but the state has limited scope for infrastructure.\n63 Pondicherry was not considered  in any of the discussions.\n64 Tamil Nadu expressed interest in participating in the PSIF II and did not out rule future reforms in its infrastructure\n\nsectors.\n\n\f27\n\nnumerous  innovations  in  its  delivery  of  poverty-oriented  services  and  the  state's  development\nmodel  is  a  subject  of  worldwide  study.  ADB  has  an  ongoing  program  to  strengthen  public\nresource  management.65  A  brief  overview  of  the  enabling  environment  for  private  sector\nparticipation  in  infrastructure  development  and  satisfaction  of  the  Access  Criteria  in  each\nselected state are presented in Appendix 8, Matrix on Enabling Environment for Private Sector\nParticipation in Infrastructure Development in Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, and Madhya\nPradesh.\n\n108. Andhra  Pradesh.  The  Andhra  Pradesh  Government  has  an  ambitious  vision  for  the\neconomic and social development of the state, and identified construction and infrastructure as\nthe  growth  engines  for  their  role  in  employment  creation  and  in  catalyzing  other  productive\ninvestments.  For  this  purpose,  the  government  developed  a  comprehensive  economic  plan,\nVision  2020,  that  aims  to  improve  the  quality  of  life  in  AP  by  accelerating  economic  growth,\nincreasing  social  spending,  adopting  good  governance  practices,  and  achieving  fiscal\nsustainability. AP has identified 31 mega projects for implementation by the private sector under\nits  Vision  2020.  Projects  of  about  $1.73  billion  have  been  identified  for  implementation  by  the\nprivate sector by 2003.\n\n109. On  20  September  2001,  this  was  supplemented  by  enactment  of  the  Infrastructure\nDevelopment  Enabling  Act,  as  well  as  with  sector  policies  for  private  sector  participation  in\ninfrastructure  projects.  Under  the  act,  an  infrastructure  authority  is  to  be  created  to  handle\nregulation and dispute resolution. Procurement processes and authority levels to negotiate and\naward contracts necessary for a transparent and conducive investment climate for private sector\nparticipation  in  infrastructure  projects  are  defined.  AP  Industrial  Infrastructure  Corporation\n(APIIC), on the other hand, will undertake privatization and project development in collaboration\nwith  different  experts  in  the  field  such  as  IL&FS.  It  is  also  setting  up  an  infrastructure  fund\ndesigned to meet project development expenses with the state government initially contributing\nRs50 million. However, other funding has yet to materialize.\n\n110. AP launched a comprehensive program of economic and structural reforms with World\nBank  support.66  The  AP  Electricity  Reforms  Act  (October  1998)  took  effect  in  February  1999.\nTwo  months  later,  an  independent  regulatory  authority  was  established  and  tariff  orders  were\nissued.  The  first  tariff  order  was  for  a  16  percent  average  tariff  increase,  which  is  for  full  cost\nrecovery  and  beyond  what  the  state  transmission  company  had  sought.  AP  has  also  already\nseparated  generation  from  transmission  and  distribution  of  its  SEB.  Four  wholly  owned\ndistribution  companies  have  been  formed  and  joint  venture  partners  are  now  being  sought.\nPrivatization is expected to be completed by next year. Model concession agreement is being\nprocessed for ports, and proposed for roads, information technology, and SEZs. The Rights to\nInformation Act provides for right of access to information to the citizens of the state to promote\nopenness,  transparency,  and  accountability  in  administration;  while  the  Right  to  Transparency\nAct  provides  for  transparency  in  public  procurement  of  goods  and  services.  Supplementary\nAppendix E provides a more detailed economic profile.\n\n                  \n\n65 Loan  1717-IND:  Madhya Pradesh  Public Resource Management Program,  for  $250  million  approved  on  14\nDecember  1999.  Madhya  Pradesh  has  satisfied  the  conditions  of  the  program  supported  by  the  ADB  loan  and\nrelease of second tranche is being recommended.\n\n66  The  World  Bank  supported  power  sector  reforms  under  its  adjustable  program  lending.  In  addition,  it  is  also\nsupporting AP's Public Enterprise Reform and Fiscal Reform Program through its Economic Restructuring Project.\n\n\f28\n\n111. Gujarat.  One  of  India's  most  industrialized  states,  Gujarat  maintains  a  variety  of\nindustries, contributes almost 11 percent of India\u2019s industrial output, and accounts for 10 percent\nof its private consumption.\n\n112. Gujarat was the first state chosen for ADB\u2019s state-level operations and a loan supporting\na  public  resource  management  program  was  approved  in  1996.67  ADB  assistance  so  far  has\nfocused  on  improving  public  resource  management,  reforming  the  power  sector,  and\nestablishing  the  Gujarat  Infrastructure  Development  Board  as  the  first  infrastructure  project\ndevelopment  facility  of  its  kind  in  India.  Prior  to  the  January  2001  earthquake,68  the  state  was\ndeemed to be a possible candidate for self-sustaining development in the near future.\n\n113. Gujarat  has  taken  significant  steps  to  attract  private  sector  participation  in  its\ninfrastructure sectors. Gujarat has enacted the Gujarat Infrastructure Development Act (Gujarat\nAct  No.  11  of  1999).  The  act  was  designed  to  provide  a  framework  for  participation  in  the\nfinancing, construction, maintenance, and operation of infrastructure projects. The act describes\nwho  can  participate  in  the  projects,  what  their  participation  will  be  and  the  procedure  for\nconcession  agreements.  In  parallel,  the  Gujarat  Infrastructure  Development  Board  was\nestablished to promote private participation in projects, to advise the state government on policy\nmatters,  to  interface  with  national  and  international  financial  institutions,  and  to  coordinate\nprojects  undertaken  by  the  state.  The  board  has  prepared  a  master  plan  for  infrastructure\ndevelopment, the Gujarat Infrastructure Development Agenda 2010, identifying 383 projects in\nvarious  sectors  with  a  projected  required  investment  of  Rs1,170  billion  (approximately  $24.5\nbillion) over 10 years, the first Indian state to do so.\n\nIn \n\nthe  power  sector,  Gujarat  already  has  an  operational  electricity  regulatory\n114.\ncommission, set up under earlier ADB program assistance. It is pursuing power sector reforms\nunder the Power Sector Development Program69 assisted by ADB. It also has formulated roads\nand ports policies, and identified projects for development. It has developed a model concession\nagreement for private sector participation in roads, the first among Indian states, as well as for\nports.  Gujarat  has  initiated  actions  for  establishing  regulatory  frameworks  for  water  supply,\nurban  infrastructure,  ports,  SEZs,  and  roads.  Gujarat  has  also  set  up  a  task  force  to  examine\nthe  requirements  for  setting  up  a  dispute  resolution  authority.  Gujarat  Industrial  Investment\nCorporation, with the AIG Group, and IDFC, have set up an asset management company and\nare  now  in  the  process  of  establishing  equity  and  debt  funds.  Gujarat  has  been  pressing  for\nADB  assistance  for  its  infrastructure  sectors  after  undertaking  the  reforms  specified  under  its\npolicy  reform  program  with  ADB.  Supplementary  Appendix  E  provides  a  more  detailed\neconomic profile of the state.\n\n115. Karnataka.  The  Karnataka  government  has \nto  strengthen\ninfrastructure  facilities  and  create  an  atmosphere  for  rapid  industrial  development  in  the  state,\nrapid  economic\nthereby  creating  additional  employment  opportunities  and  enabling \ndevelopment.\n\ninitiated  measures \n\n116. Cognizant  of  the  crucial  role  power  has  in  facilitating  unhindered  growth  and  poverty\nreduction, the state government committed to time-bound reform and restructuring of the sector\n\n67 Loan  1506-IND:  Gujarat  Public Sector Resource Management Program,  for  $250,000,000,  approved  on  18\n\n                  \n\n68  Loan  1826-IND:  Gujarat Earthquake Rehabilitation & Reconstruction,  for  $500,000,000,  approved  on  26  March\n\nDecember 1996.\n\n2001.\n\n69 Loan 1804-IND: Gujarat Power Sector Program Loan, for 150,000,000, approved on 13 December 2000.\n\n\f29\n\nwith  World  Bank  assistance,  the  Karnataka  Power  Sector  Reform  and  Restructuring  Program.\nThe  Electricity  Reforms  Act  was  passed  in  1999,  and  the  Karnataka  Electricity  Board  was\nsubsequently  corporatized.  The  Karnataka  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission  has  also  been\nconstituted  and  passed  its  first  tariff  order  raising  the  average  tariff  by  26  percent.  The  state\ngovernment  also  signed  a  memorandum  of  agreement  with  the  national  Ministry  of  Power,\ncommitting to a time-bound reform and restructuring program for its power sector, undertaking\nto separate transmission and distribution, and privatize distribution. It targets to accomplish this\nby June 2002.\n\n117. Karnataka  has  an  infrastructure  policy  contained  in  a  Government  order.  This  is\nsupported by formal policies in various infrastructure sectors. It also has procedures established\nfor  transparent  tendering  of  projects.  It  has  designated  the  Infrastructure  Development\nDepartment  of  the  Ministry  of  Industry  and  Commerce  to  serve  as  a  single  window  for  private\ninvestors  in  infrastructure  projects.  It  has  also  formed  a  partnership  with  IDFC  called  i-Deck\n[Infrastructure Development Corporation (Karnataka) Ltd.] to establish priorities in infrastructure\ndevelopment,  conceptualize  and  develop  commercially  viable  infrastructure  projects,  and\nprepare model concession agreements. The state government will contribute Rs2 billion to this\neffort. Karnataka has projects in the pipeline that could be implemented by 2003 of about $520\nmillion in roads, ports, airport, and urban mass transit system.\n\n118. Roads  are  the  dominant  mode  of  transport,  and  Karnataka  has  a  model  concession\nagreement  for  the  road  sector.  The  state  is  a  preferred  destination  for  information  technology\nindustries, and proposes to soon have the biggest information technology incubation center in\nIndia.  The  industry  has  not  shown  signs  of  any  negative  effects  from  the  global  economic\nslowdown thus far, and most of the companies continue to show about 50\u201380 percent growth.\nSupplementary Appendix E provides a more detailed economic profile.\n\n119. Madhya Pradesh. The Madhya Pradesh government has initiated steps to improve the\nenabling environment for private sector investment in the state. Assisted by the ADB program\nloan,  the  state  developed  private  sector-oriented  policies  for  roads,70  housing,  and  power,\nkeeping  in  mind  environmental  concerns  and  raising  awareness  for  the  social  and  economic\nimpacts of projects on displaced persons.\n\n120.\nThe  state  government  recently  introduced  a  power  sector  reform  package  that  has\nalready  brought  into  force  a  regulatory  framework  for  the  power  sector  and  has  instituted\nseveral  key  reforms.71  The  MP  Vidjut  Sudhar  Vidheyak,  2000,  approved  by  the  MP  legislative\nassembly  in  November  2000,  in  addition  to  subsuming  and  expanding  the  powers  of  the\nMadhya Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission, provides for (i) restructuring of the Madhya\nPradesh  Electricity  Board,  (ii)  metering  of  all  consumers,  (iii)  rationalization  of  tariffs  so  all\nclasses  of  consumers  will  pay  at  least  75  percent  of  cost  of  supply,  (iv)  a  budget  for  Madhya\nPradesh  State  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission  (MPSERC)  for  the  next  five  years,  and  (v)\narbitration with the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission. The MPSERC issued its first tariff\norder on 26 September 2001.\n\nThe  state  has  an  economic  development  policy  in  place  that  stresses  infrastructure\n121.\ndevelopment  through  public-private  sector  participation.  While  certain  departments,  such  as\nenergy  and  urban  administration  already  have  clear  policies  regarding  participation  of  the\n\n                  \n\n70 Reform of state roads sector is envisioned under a proposed State Roads Project scheduled for 2002.\n71 The  proposed  Madhya  Pradesh  Power  Sector  Development  Program,  scheduled  for  Board  consideration  in\n\nDecember 2001 will support comprehensive restructuring of the power sector.\n\n\f30\n\nprivate sector in infrastructure development, action has been initiated to develop similar policies\nfor other infrastructure departments. The state's Economic Development Board is headed by the\nchief minister, and gives clearances for large infrastructure projects. In addition, the Committee\nof  Senior  Secretaries,  headed  by  the  principal  secretary  (finance),  provides  clearances  for\nconcessions  to  be  granted  on  a  project  to  project  basis.  The  infrastructure  projects  are\ngenerated by the respective line departments and are evaluated by the Madhya Pradesh State\nIndustrial  Development  Corporation  (MPSIDC)  for  eventual  clearance  from  the  Economic\nDevelopment  Board.  To  facilitate  the  preparation  of  projects,  the  state  proposes  to  have  an\nInfrastructure  Initiative  Fund  to  be  set  up  as  a  revolving  fund  for  preparation  of  projects.  The\nstate's  Right  to  Information  Act  and  Act  for  Investment  in  Infrastructure  Projects  provide\ntransparency  in  all  bidding  and  awarding  of  contracts.  Besides  the  pipeline  projects  in  power\ngeneration,  the  state  is  planning  projects  for  about  $625  million  for  road  development  through\nBOT, water supply, cyberparks and special economic zones implemented by 2003.\n\n122. A new state road policy was developed, which seeks to encourage private participation\nin  infrastructure  investment.  The  first  private  sector  toll  road  in  India  was  implemented  in  the\nstate  through  the  funding  and  technical  support  from  the  Madhya  Pradesh  State  Industrial\nDevelopment Corporation Ltd. (MPSIDC) and IL&FS. The state has already implemented tolling\non  approximately  1,000  kilometers  of  state-maintained  roads  to  finance  operation  and\nmaintenance.  The  state  has  also  undertaken  an  ambitious  road  construction  program  to\nimprove connectivity in rural and urban areas. The state government has directed the Madhya\nPradesh  State  Bridge  Corporation  to  develop  14  projects  on  a  BOT  basis  with  private  sector\nparticipation.  The  corporation  has  begun  preparatory  work  for  seven  of  these  projects.72  The\nstate  has  developed  a  standard  concession  agreement  for  roads  and  is  in  the  process  of\ndeveloping  draft  standard  concession  agreements  for  other  sectors.  An  environmental  policy\nwas  adopted  in  1999  and  the  state  is  actively  engaged  in  implementing  an  action  plan  for\nenvironmental  protection  with  the  support  of  ADB  TA.73  A  comprehensive  draft  policy  to  deal\nwith  resettlement  issues  has  been  reviewed  by  the  cabinet.  Please  see  Supplementary\nAppendix E for a more detailed economic profile.\n\nD. \n\nMain Terms and Conditions\n\n1. \n\nThe Loans\n\n123. PSIF II will comprise two loans of $100 million each to IL&FS and IDBI for relending to\ninfrastructure projects in the specified sectors (para. 103) in the four selected states. Each loan\nwill be guaranteed separately by India.\n\n124. Each loan will be documented on the basis of a separate loan agreement between ADB\nand  the  concerned  PFI,  including  ADB's  standard  terms  and  conditions  for  such  lending  and\nsuch  other  provisions,  including  financial  covenants,  as  are  set  out  in  more  detail  in  this\nReport.74\n\n                  \n\n72 Madhya  Pradesh  Government:  Policy Thrust for Economic Development of Madhya Pradesh.  Report  of  the\n\nInfrastructure/Road Chapter. Feedback Strategy.\n\n73TA 3423-IND (Cluster): Environmental Management at the State Level, for $3,620,000, approved on 1 March 2000.\n74 Unless otherwise stated, the specific loan terms and conditions set out in this report will apply to each PFI under\n\nthe two separate loan agreements.\n\n\f31\n\na. \n\nTranching\n\n125.\nFor the first tranche, the PFIs will allocate $20 million to each selected state for use with\nqualified  private  infrastructure  projects  in  the  specified  sectors  that  they  may  sanction  to\noperate. However, should infrastructure projects materialize faster than anticipated, the second\ntranche can be accelerated. After two years, ADB will conduct a review and assess progress of\nimplementation  against  the  Continued  Access  Criteria,  in  coordination  with  the  PFIs  and\nselected states. Uncommitted funds for the first tranche will automatically be made available for\nthe second tranche. No preallocation of funds will be made for the second tranche, and funds\ncan be accessed on a purely competitive basis (paras. 95-98).\n\nb. \n\nMain Terms and Conditions\n\n126.\nThe  PFIs  have  requested  a  loan  of  $100  million  each  from  ADB's  ordinary  capital\nresources under the PSIF II. The loans will each have a 20-year term, including a grace period\nof 5 years; an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB's LIBOR-based loan facility; a\ncommitment  charge  of  0.75  percent  per  annum;  a  front-end  fee  of  1.0  percent;  conversion\noptions that may be exercised in accordance with the terms of the Loan Agreement, the Loan\nRegulations, and ADB's Conversion Guidelines, and such other terms and conditions set forth in\nthe  Loan  Agreement.  The  Government  of  India  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  the\nPFIs' decision to borrow under ADB's LIBOR-based loan facility on the basis of these terms and\nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were the PFIs' own independent decision\nand not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB.\n\nc. \n\nPeriod of Utilization\n\n127.\nThe  loans  will  be  available  for  four  years  for  commitment  and  five  years  for\ndisbursements. For the first tranche, funds allocated will be made available for commitment for\neach state for two years and for disbursement for five years from the date of loan effectiveness.\nHowever,  should  projects  materialize  more  quickly  than  anticipated,  release  of  the  second\ntranche  may  be  accelerated  to  support  private  sector  initiatives.  Consequently,  the  second\ntranche  would  be  available  for  commitment  for  four  years  and  for  disbursement  for  five  years\nfrom the date of loan effectiveness.\n\nd. \n\nMaximum Subloan Size and Free Limit\n\nThe  maximum  size  of  subloans  allowed  under  the  PSIF  II  will  be  25  percent  of  the\n128.\nproject cost or $75 million,75 whichever is lower. The PFIs may, however, finance subloans on a\njoint basis provided such financing in the aggregate does not exceed the foregoing limitation for\nindividual  projects.  No  total  project  size  limitation  has  been  stipulated  to  provide  sufficient\nflexibility in utilizing the funds due to the limited number of projects being finalized and the weak\nresponse by investors. ADB support will help catalyze the flow of funds even for large projects.\nThe  maturity  of  each  subloan  will  be  for  a  minimum  of  10  years.  Each  PFI  will  be  required  to\nfinance at least two infrastructure projects, each in different subsectors and each in a different\nselected  state,  to  disperse  the  benefits  of  the  facility  and  to  diversify  the  PFI's  portfolio  and\nexperience  in  infrastructure  financing.  To  develop  know-how  and  experience  in  state-level\nfinancing, prior ADB approval is required for subloans under the PSIF II.\n\n75 Conforms to the increase in maximum size of subloans under ADB's private sector window.\n\n                  \n\n\f32\n\ne. \n\nUtilization of Loan Proceeds\n\n129.\nThe loan proceeds loans will be used by infrastructure projects to finance the cost, and\ninsurance and freight costs, of imported materials and equipment, as well as the indirect foreign\nexchange  cost  of  locally  manufactured  equipment,  including  civil  works.  In  addition,  due  to\nserious  limitations  in  the  availability  of  matching  long-term  funds,  to  facilitate  disbursement,  a\nportion of the loan proceeds is earmarked to finance the local currency costs of goods, services,\nand civil works of eligible projects; this is estimated at (i) 20 percent of ADB financing for any\neligible subloan in power; and (ii) 70 percent of ADB financing for any eligible project for roads,\nwater  supply,  urban  mass  transit,  or  ports  where  costs  are  predominantly  for  local  goods  and\nservices.  Nevertheless,  such  local  currency  cost  financing  may  not  be  used  for  payment  of\ntaxes  and  duties,  cost  of  land  acquisition  and  payment  for  right-of-way,  working  capital,  and\ninterest expenses and financial charges. Furthermore, to facilitate the timely implementation of\nprojects,  retroactive  financing  for  eligible  expenditures  incurred  180  days  prior  to  the  date  of\nloan  effectiveness  will  be  allowed.  The  amount  of  retroactive  financing  may  not  exceed  10\npercent of the ADB loan to each PFI.\n\n130. Prior  to  requesting  withdrawals,  the  PFI  concerned  will  submit  an  application  for\napproval of any subloan. Such application will include the following: (i) the terms and conditions\nof  the  proposed  subloan;  (ii)  a  detailed  appraisal  and  financial  analysis  for  the  proposed\ninfrastructure project to which each subloan relates, including assessment of economic viability;\ntechnical  feasibility;  financial  profitability;  management  capability;  operational  efficiency,  and\nprojected economic and financial rates of return; (iii) a detailed description of the procurement\nterms, conditions, and procedures to be applied; (iv) a detailed analysis and assessment of all\napplicable  environmental  and  social  considerations  in  accordance  with  the  terms,  conditions,\nand procedures required by applicable environmental regulations and legislation in India, ADB's\nenvironmental procedures and ADB's involuntary resettlement policy;76 (v) a detailed proposed\nfinancing  package,  including  identification  of  all  financing  sources,  in  accordance  with  the\nsubloan financing criteria; (vi) detailed estimates of projected expenditures to be incurred by the\nproposed infrastructure project; and (vii) other information that ADB may reasonably request.\n\nf. \n\nProcurement\n\nIn accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement (para. 3.09), ADB will encourage\n131.\nthe  PFIs  to  require  their  subborrowers  to  adopt  international  competitive  bidding  procedures\nwhen  the  amount  of  the  investment  is  unusually  large  and  economy  and  efficiency  can  be\ngained by following such procedures. Nonetheless, for contracts totaling $10 million or more for\nthe  supply  and  installation  of  equipment,  and  $20  million  or  more  for  civil  works,  international\ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  following  ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement  will  be  required.\nFor goods and services procured below this threshold, the PFI will satisfy itself that procurement\nprocedures are appropriate in the circumstances, that goods and services obtained are suitable\nfor  the  subloan,  that  the  price  paid  is  reasonable,  and  that  fair  canvasing  has  been  done  in\nselecting  suppliers.  It  should  also  consider  other  relevant  factors  such  as  eligibility,  prompt\ndelivery,  conformity  with  specified  standards  for  quality,  and  availability  of  spare  parts  and\nsupport facilities; and in the case of services, the reliability and competence of party or parties\nrendering  the  service.  For  BOT  project  and  variants,  if  the  project  sponsor  or  engineering,\nprocurement,  and  construction  contractor  is  selected  through  competitive  bidding  among\ninternational entities in accordance with procedures acceptable to ADB, such project sponsor or\ncontractor may apply its own procedures for procurement provided that such procurement is for\n\n76 ADB. 1998.

Manila.\n\n                  \n\n\fgoods  and  works  supplied  from,  or  produced  in,  member  countries  of  ADB.  Moreover,  such\nproject sponsors or contractors must only be nationals of ADB member countries.\n\n33\n\n2. \n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\na. \n\nState Level Coordination\n\n132. Each  selected  state  will  be  asked  to  submit  an  undertaking  committing  to  fulfill  the\nContinued  Access  Criteria  agreed  to  with  ADB  contained  in  a  Letter  of  Intent  and  to  provide\nnecessary  assistance  to  ADB  consultants.  Each  state  has  designated  an  executing  and/or\nimplementing  agency77  to  coordinate  with  ADB  and  the  PFIs,  and  to  be  the  focal  points  for\nefforts to meet the Continued Access Criteria under the PSIF II. Each selected state, through its\nexecuting  and/or  implementing  agency,  will  submit  to  ADB  prior  to  its  review  of  the  PSIF  II,\nabout three months before the end of the second year of implementation of the project facility, a\nreport  concerning  the  implementation  progress  of  developing  an  enabling  environment  for\nprivate  sector  participation  in  each  selected  state  and  sector  policy  reforms  in  the  covered\ninfrastructure sectors.\n\nb. \n\nReporting Requirements\n\n133. Each PFI will have its accounts and financial statements audited annually, in accordance\nwith  generally  accepted  accounting  and  auditing  standards,  by  independent  external  auditors\nacceptable to ADB. Immediately after completion of the audit, but not later than six months after\nthe  close  of  the  fiscal  year,  each  PFI  will  furnish  to  ADB  copies  of  its  audited  financial\nstatements,  and  certification  by  the  auditors  of  the  status  of  PFI  compliance  with  prudential\nnorms specified in para. 77. In addition, the PFI will submit to ADB, on or before 15 December\nof each year, a schedule indicating the projected disbursement of the PSIF II proceeds for each\nquarter of the succeeding calendar year; and within six months after the end of each fiscal year,\na  financial  projection  of  its  operations  and  capital  expenditure  program  detailing  effects  on  its\nincome  statement,  balance  sheet,  and  cash  flow  for  the  next  three  years.  On  a  semiannual\nbasis, not later than three months from the end of each fiscal semiannual period, each PFI will\nfurnish ADB its unaudited financial statements; performance and results of operations; progress\nof  PSIF  II  implementation,  until  the  PSIF  II  is  fully  disbursed  or  withdrawal  from  the  PSIF  II  is\nclosed;  trading  of  marketable  securities  generated  from  the  PSIF  II;  reapplication  of  funds\ngenerated from the initial sale of marketable securities from subloans; and developments in the\ndomestic  debt  market,  in  particular,  policy  issues  that  may  arise,  including  problems\nencountered  and  steps  being  taken  to  remedy  these  problems.  Each  PFI  will  enable  ADB  to\ndiscuss  the  PFI's  financial  statements  and  financial  affairs  with  its  auditors,  if  needed,  and\nprovide data or information it may require to conduct due diligence under the PSIF II.\n\nFor  individual  projects,  the  PFI  will  enable  ADB  or  its  authorized  representative  to\n134.\ninspect  any  project,  the  goods  financed  out  of  the  proceeds  of  the  PSIF  II,  and  any  relevant\nrecords  and  documents  maintained  by  the  PFI.  Within  six  months  after  the  completion  of  an\ninfrastructure  project,  the  PFI  will  prepare  and  provide  ADB  with  a  completion  report,  in  such\nform  and  detail  as  ADB  may  reasonably  request,  including  the  utilization  of  PSIF  II  proceeds,\nthe  execution  of  the  project,  costs,  and  any  other  relevant  matters.  After  the  closing  of\n\n                  \n\n77 The Executing Agencies will be the Infrastructure Authority for AP, ministry of finance for Gujarat, and the finance\ndepartments for Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh. The Implementing Agencies will be the APIIC for AP, the Gujarat\nInfrastructure  Development  Board  for  Gujarat,  the  line  departments  for  Karnataka,  and  MPSIDC  for  Madhya\nPradesh.\n\n\f34\n\nwithdrawals from the PSIF II, each PFI will promptly, not later than six months from the closing\ndate, provide ADB with a report on the utilization of the PSIF II portion administered by the PFI,\nthe execution and performance of projects, the performance of the PFI under the PSIF II, and\naccomplishment of the PSIF II purposes. The report will include the consolidation of individual\nreports furnished earlier to ADB. After the closing of withdrawals, each PFI will provide ADB, on\na semiannual basis, with a report on the payment performance of each project, and will report\nany  problems,  financial  or  operational,  that  may  have  arisen  in  the  meantime  and  the  steps\nbeing taken to resolve them. Further, on an annual basis, within 90 days from the end of each\nfiscal year, the PFI will inform ADB of the status and performance of each project in an agreed\nupon  format.  Each  PFI  will  furnish  ADB,  as  it  may  reasonably  request,  all  such  reports  and\ninformation  concerning  (i)  the  PSIF  II  and  its  utilization;  (ii)  the  projects;  (iii)  the  marketable\nsecurities;  (iv)  reapplication  of  proceeds  from  resale  of  the  marketable  securities;  (v)  the\nmanagement, operation, and financial condition of the PFI; and (vi) matters relating to the PSIF\nII purposes. All reports and statements will be in English.\n\nc. \n\nPeriodic Reviews\n\n135. ADB will, at its discretion, conduct reviews of the management, financial, and operational\nperformance of the PFIs and infrastructure projects financed under the PSIF II, initially after the\nclosing  of  withdrawals.  The  review  will  include  procurement  procedures  utilized  by  all  PSIF  II\nfinanced  infrastructure  projects.  Such  reviews  will  be  conducted  at  five-year  intervals,  unless\nearlier reviews are indicated, until the maturity of the PSIF II. A final review will be carried out\nwith the Government and the PFIs after the maturity of the PSIF II, and include assessment of\nthe  impact  of  the  PSIF  II,  whether  the  PSIF  II  objectives  have  been  achieved,  and  lessons\nlearned from the implementation of the project facility.\n\nd. \n\nBenefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n\n136. Each  PFI  will  monitor  and  evaluate  the  benefits  of  subloans  financed  after  their\ncompletion  and  in  accordance  with  a  schedule  to  be  mutually  agreed  upon  with  ADB.  Such\nbenefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  procedures  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB's  project\nperformance  and  monitoring  system.  For  this  purpose,  the  PFIs  can  utilize  the  computerized\nsystem for collecting and analyzing benefits data developed by ADB for financial intermediaries.\nADB, if deemed necessary, may provide staff training to the concerned PFI on operation of the\nsystem.\n\nE. \n\nCofinancing\n\n137. KfW  representatives  joined  the  ADB  Preappraisal  and  Appraisal  Missions.  KfW  has,  in\nprinciple,  agreed  to  cofinance  the  PSIF  II  up  to  EUR162  million  (about  $147  million)78\ncomprising  concessional  funds  of  EUR25.5  million  (about  $23  million),  market  borrowings\nguaranteed  by  the  German  Government  of  EUR103.5  million  (about  $94  million),  and\nunguaranteed  market  borrowing  of  EUR33  million  (about  $30  million).  In  addition,  KfW  is\nconsidering  a  grant  of  EUR2.25  million  (about  $2  million)  to  be  used  for  project  development\npurposes.  This  is  subject  to  the  formal  approval  of  the  German  Government  as  well  as  the\noutcome of the Indo-German governments' negotiations scheduled for the last quarter of 2001.\nBased on current market rates, the average interest rate for the KfW financing will be about 4.4\npercent. If the KfW cofinancing is approved, the KfW loans will provide a preallocated amount of\n10 percent of the KfW facility to each selected state equivalent to EUR16.2 million (about $15\n\n                  \n78 $1=EUR1.10 as of 1 October 2001.\n\n\f35\n\nmillion) per state. Drawdowns from the ADB and KfW loans will be made on pro rata basis by\nthe PFIs for infrastructure projects. KfW has agreed to adhere to ADB's procurement guidelines\nand in its loan agreement for the PSIF II, include a cross-default provision with the ADB loans.\n\nF. \n\nSocial and Environmental Aspects\n\n138. Each  PFI  will  ensure  that  the  impact  of  any  subloan  on  vulnerable  groups  will  be\nadequately  considered.  Sensitive  social  issues  that  may  arise  in  the  course  of  project\npreparation  will  be  brought  to  the  attention  of  ADB  at  an  early  stage.  Each  state  has  been\nrequired  to  adopt  formal  policies  on  resettlement.  Consultants  for  the  proposed  ADB  TA  will\nassist each state government to adopt appropriate policies.\n\nFurthermore,  each  PFI  will  be  required  to  ensure  compliance  of  subloans  with  the\n139.\nrequirements of social and environmental legislation and regulations of the country at national\nand  state  levels;  and  each  PFI  and  the  subloans  should  conform  with  ADB's  social  and\nenvironmental procedures and resettlement requirements, including its Involuntary Resettlement\nPolicy.  The  subloans  financed  under  the  PSIF  II  are  expected  to  require  social  and\nenvironmental  assessments.  Such  assessments  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  review  and\nclearance before approval of any subloan by the PFI.\n\n1. \n\nPoverty Impact\n\n140.\nInadequate  Infrastructure  is  a  key  constraint  to  industrial  development  and  more  rapid\neconomic growth in India. Evidence suggests that growth is an essential ingredient for sustained\npoverty  reduction.  In  India  particularly,  the  gains  to  the  rural  poor  since  the  1970s  have  been\nclearly demonstrated during times of economic prosperity.\n\n141. Private sector participation in infrastructure in India thus assumes greater significance as\nfiscal sustainability of infrastructure investments is in question. Aside from facilitating growth by\nremoving  impediments  to  infrastructure  development,  the  poverty  impact  of  private  sector\ninvestments  in  infrastructure  may  be  assessed  from  two  other  perspectives:  (i)  in  terms  of\nopportunity  cost  of  government  expenditure  (freed  for  investment  in  social  sectors),  and  (ii)\ndirect and indirect effects of infrastructure investment on poverty reduction.79\n\n142.\nInvestment  in  infrastructure  will  directly  generate  employment  and  improve  incomes.\nInvestment in power generates employment in the building, operation, and maintenance of such\nsystems  and  supports  industrial  development,  and  thus  results  in  significant  employment.\nInvestments  in  transport,  particularly  road  construction,  lead  to  substantial  job  creation  for\nsemiskilled  and  unskilled  workers  particularly  in  rural  areas.  SEZs  enhance  marketability  of\nexports that employ large numbers of low and semiskilled workers.\n\n143.\nIndirect  effects,  would  largely  be  via  improved  cost  efficiencies  and  quality  of  service\nthrough  the  private  operation  of  infrastructure  and  provision  of  infrastructure  services  to  the\nextent that these translate to cost reduction that benefit the poor, such as by reducing prices of\nessential commodities, reducing time spent for travel, mitigating congestion, reducing pollution\nand  accidents,  helping  develop  poorer  areas,  and  improving  quality  of  life.  The  urban  poor\nbenefit  most  from  improved  access  to  good  infrastructure  because  the  poor  are  typically\nsituated in settlements with unsanitary conditions, open to hazardous emissions, and prone to\n\n                  \n\n79 These  are  being  reviewed  in  more  detail  in  two  sectors  under  ADB  TA  5947-REG:  Assessing the Impact of\n\nTransport and Energy Infrastructure on Poverty Reduction, for $800,000, approved on 25 October 2000.\n\n\f36\n\naccidental  risks.80  Even  facilities  like  airports  that  primarily  benefit  the  well-to-do  have  indirect\neffects  on  the  poor  by  increasing  tourism  where  the  rate  of  employment  is  high.  The\ndevelopment of power and roads also have an indirect impact on the expansion of the nonfarm\nsector,  which  could  have  a  considerable  upward  impact  on  wages  in  the  agriculture  sector,\nwhere a large part of the poor reside.81\n\n144. On  the  other  hand,  improved  regulatory  and  supervisory  capacity  of  the  central\nGovernment and state governments and the conduct of public policy, as their role as regulator\nrather than direct operators of infrastructure projects assumes greater importance, will be critical\nto ensure that the negative impacts on the poor, even in the short term, of the private provision\nof infrastructure services, arising from, job losses, increased costs from higher tariffs, etc., are\nproperly mitigated. The summary poverty impact assessment is in Appendix 9.\n\n2. \n\nEnvironment\n\n145.\nThe  state  governments  involved,  the  PFIs,  and  the  infrastructure  projects  financed  will\nbe  required  to  comply  with  the  relevant  environmental  laws  and  regulations  of  India  at  the\nnational and state levels, particularly the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974;\nthe Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1982; the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986;\nthe  Notification  on  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  of  Development  Projects,  1994;  and\nForest (Conservation) Act, 1980. They will also be required to comply with ADB\u2019s environmental\nrequirements.  Each  state  has  been  requested  to  adopt  formal  policies  and  guidelines  on  the\nenvironment based legislation and regulations of the country. The expert(s) under the proposed\nADB TA will assist each state government in this regard.\n\n146.\nIL&FS has a satisfactory organizational setup and appropriate environmental policy and\nprocedures.  The  institutional  capacity  of  IDBI,  on  the  other  hand,  to  currently  deal  with\nenvironmental  issues  and  concerns  under  the  PSIF  II  is  deemed  to  be  still  inadequate.  To\naddress  such  inadequacy,  the  following  steps  are  required  for  IDBI  (i)  IDBI  will  adopt\nappropriate  environmental  policies  and  guidelines,  that  particularly  address  the  environmental\nissues  and  requirements  relating  to  the  PSIF  II;  and  (ii)  during  project  implementation,  the\ninstitutional  capacity  of  IDBI  to  effectively  deal  with  the  related  environmental  issues  will  be\nstrengthened.  IDBI  will  consider  establishing  an  environmental  unit  within  its  organization,\nand/or  retain  the  services  of  a  reputable  local  environmental  consulting  firm(s)  acceptable  to\nADB.  The  officials  involved  in  infrastructure  projects  will  be  regularly  trained  under  a\ncomprehensive  training  program  on  environmental  impact  assessment  procedures  and\nenvironmental management systems.\n\n147.\nFor  each  subloan  under  the  PSIF  II,  the  two  PFIs  will  submit  to  ADB  an  initial\nenvironmental  examination  report  for  their  respective  subloans  for  ADB  clearance.  Depending\non  the  findings  and  conclusions,  an  environmental  impact  assessment  report  for  the  subloans\nwith significant environmental impacts will be submitted to ADB for review and clearance. The\nreports will follow, as closely as possible, ADB's annotated formats.\n\nThe  environmental  monitoring  for  the  subloans  will  be  conducted  by  the  PFIs  or  their\n148.\ndesignated  environmental  expert(s)  on  a  semiannual  basis  during  project  implementation  to\nensure the subloans do not cause any significant adverse environmental impacts. The PFIs will\n\n                  \n\n80 World Bank. 1994. World Development Report.\n81  Sharif,  Abusalleh.  2001.  Role of Rural Nonfarm Employment in Poverty Alleviation.

On  the  basis  of  current  practice,  for  projects  less  than  Rs500  million,  environmental\nclearance  is  sought  from  the  state  government,  while  projects  equal  to  or  more  than  Rs500\nmillion  must  seek  environmental  clearance \nIn  seeking\nenvironmental  clearance  for  a  project,  an  environmental  impact  assessment  report  and  an\nenvironmental management plan will be prepared by an inspector in the district office close to\nthe  project  site  and  submitted  to  the  ministry  of  environment  and  forests.  After  review  of  the\ndocuments  and  a  public  hearing,  and  if  the  project  is  deemed  in  compliance  with  the  existing\nguidelines, a consent for establishment (for choice of location) and a consent for operation are\ngranted. These consents may take anywhere from 13 days to 8 months to be issued (depending\non  the  nature  of  the  industry,  and  whether  issued  at  state  or  national  level).  The  consent  for\noperation is time-bound and needs to be renewed periodically, although the time frame for the\nrenewal  is  determined  by  each  state.  For  instance,  in  Karnataka,  the  renewal  period  for  the\nconsent  for  operation  is  based  on  the  nature  of  the  industry  in  question  (e.g.,  green  versus\nhazardous industries), whereas in AP, the consent needs to be renewed every three years for\nany project. During implementation, the project owner(s) are also required to submit semiannual\nstatus reports to the district offices about the project and its environmental impact. The district\nofficers review the reports and conduct on-site reviews of the projects, if and when necessary.\n\n3. \n\nResettlement and Rehabilitation\n\n150.\nThe  PSIF  II  will  finance  subloans  that  may  require  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.\nOne  such  subloan  has  been  identified  and  a  resettlement  plan  prepared.  The  summary  plan\n(Appendix 10) provides a sample for all subloans involving land acquisition and resettlement. A\nresettlement  policy  framework  was  also  prepared  as  a  guide  for  resettlement  planning,\nimplementation,  and  monitoring  for  all  future  subloans  that  will  be  financed  under  the  PSIF  II.\nThe summary framework is in Appendix 11.\n\n151.\nThe sample resettlement plan for the Ahmedabad-Mehsana Toll Road Project in Gujarat\nwas prepared by IL&FS with World Bank assistance and meets ADB's involuntary resettlement\npolicy  requirements.  The  project  involves  construction  of  a  52-kilometer  two-lane  road  and\nacquisition  of  a  60-meter  right-of-way  encompassing  an  area  of  12  hectares  of  predominantly\nprivate agricultural land. A total of 79 families will be affected; the majority (75 percent) will lose\nless than 15 percent of their landholding; 13 encroaching residential structures and 4 residential\nsquatters  will  also  be  affected.  All  will  be  provided  with  compensation  and  rehabilitation\nassistance. The 13 vulnerable families will receive special income restoration assistance.\n\n152.\nThe  resettlement  policy  framework  was  been  prepared  by  IL&FS  and  will  apply  to  all\nPSIF II subloans with land acquisition and resettlement. The framework is based on the IL&FS\nEnvironmental  and  Social  Safeguard  Policy,  developed  in  1995  with  World  Bank  guidance.\nIL&FS  is  among  the  first  financial  institutions  in  India  to  recognize  the  importance  of\nenvironmental  and  social  safeguards  in  the  development  of  infrastructure  projects.  To\nimplement  the  Environmental  and  Social  Safeguard  Policy,  IL&FS  has  a  well-established\nEnvironmental  and  Social  Management  Group  staffed  with  well-qualified  environmental  and\nsocial  specialists,  complemented  by  a  cadre  of  consultant  specialists.  IDBI  has  agreed  to\nconsider establishing a similar environmental and social unit and developing in-house capacity\nand to apply the resettlement policy framework to all of their subloans involving land acquisition.\n\n\f38\n\n153. As  part  of  their  overall  project  coordination  and  financing  responsibility,  each  PFI  will\noversee subloan preparation and implementation of resettlement plans by the special purpose\nvehicles.  The  PFIs  will  forward  the  subloan  resettlement  plans  to  ADB  for  approval.  The\napproved resettlement plan for a subloan will be implemented before award of contract for that\nparticular subloan. (Supplementary Appendix F, Capacity Assessment of PFIs).\n\n154. With  a  view  to  improving  and  streamlining  the  land  acquisition  process,  the  four\nparticipating  states  of  AP,  Gujarat,  Karnataka,  and  Madhya  Pradesh  have  each  agreed  to\nconsider  a  formal  state  resettlement  and  rehabilitation  policy  at  international  standards.  The\ngovernments  of  AP,  Karnataka,  and  Madhya  Pradesh  have  already  drafted  such  policies  in\nresponse  to  their  respective  state's  requirements;  the  policies  are  expected  to  be  formalized\nshortly.  The  proposed  ADB  TA  will  assist  each  state  to  draft  and  finalize  state  R&R  policies\nsatisfactory  to  ADB.  ADB  support  has  also  been  sought  by  the  PFIs  for  training  and\ndevelopment of PFI social staff.\n\nG. \n\nRisks and Safeguards\n\n155.\nLack of commitment on the part of selected states could undermine the objectives of the\nPSIF  II.  However,  each  state  has  and  is  pursuing  reform  programs  either  with  ADB  or  World\nBank,  and  central  Government  support.  They  have  also  demonstrated  through  past  efforts  a\nstrong  desire  to  advance  their  economic  agenda  based  on  a  program  of  liberalization  and\nincreased  private  sector  participation  in  the  domestic  economy,  particularly,  infrastructure\ndevelopment. They have formalized these intentions in legislation and state policies, and have\norganized  for  dealing  with  the  private  sector.  More  importantly,  they  have  established  formal\nprograms and plans that identify the specific sectors and projects for development.\n\n156. Moreover,  these  efforts  are  reinforced  under  the  PSIF  II  by  a  system  of  incentives  (by\nmarking  selected  states  as  progressive  states,  earmarking  funds  only  for  the  four  selected\nstates,  catalyzing  the  flow  of  resources  to  each  state82)  and  penalties  (by  withholding  access\nshould reform criteria not be achieved, losing investors should they fail, and losing out to other\neligible states), and through competitive pressure.\n\nInfrastructure projects are difficult to develop and administer owing to their long gestation\n157.\nand  payback  periods.  Project  preparation  could  be  a  daunting  task.  To  facilitate  project\npreparation and processing, the PSIF II is supporting the establishment of formal structures with\nstatutory  mandates  at  the  state-level  to  deal  with  the  private  sector  and  facilitate  approval,\nlicensing,  and  clearances.  To  enhance  bankability  of  developed  projects,  the  PSIF  II  is\npromoting  partnerships  between  state  governments  and  the  PFIs  to  provide  the  needed\nfinancial  engineering  expertise  and  ability  to  mobilize  resources  on  a  large-scale  for\ninfrastructure projects.\n\n158. Moreover,  TA  is  being  provided  to  address  specific  processing  issues  concerning\nbidding  procedures  and  the  awarding  of  contracts,  drafting  of  model  concession  agreements,\nand adoption of policies concerning environmental protection and resettlement, among others.\nThese  are  critical  issues  that  often  constrain  infrastructure  development  and  private  sector\nparticipation.\n\n82  Based  on  a  25  percent  loan  limit,  the  PSIF  II,  excluding  cofinancing,  should  help  raise  at  least  $800  million  in\n\n                  \n\nresources for the four selected states.\n\n\f39\n\nFinally,  private  sector  initiatives  are  being  encouraged  to  address  different  risks  posed\n159.\nby infrastructure investments and the development of innovative instruments to mitigate various\ntypes of risks.\n\nH. \n\nTechnical Assistance\n\n160.\nThe proposed TA is being provided to the four selected states to (i) help the individual\nselected states address specific constraints in the enabling environment for the private sector to\nmake the effort sustainable, and (ii) to facilitate the processing of infrastructure projects that are\npriority projects of the individual states eligible for PSIF II financing.\n\n161.\nThe total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,875,000 equivalent, comprising $1,260,000 in\nforeign  exchange  costs  and  $615,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  costs.  ADB  will  provide\n$1,500,000 equivalent to cover the foreign exchange costs and $240,000 equivalent of the local\ncurrency  costs.  The  TA  will  be  financed  by  ADB  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  ADB-funded  TA\nprogram. The balance of the local currency costs will be provided by the Government of India.\nThe Executing Agencies for the TA will be the Infrastructure Authority in AP, ministry of finance\nin Gujarat, and the finance departments for Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh. The implementing\nagencies  will  be  the  Andhra  Pradesh  Industrial  Infrastructure  Corporation  in  AP,  the  Gujarat\nInfrastructure Development Board in Gujarat, the line departments concerned in Karnataka, and\nthe Madhya Pradesh State Industrial Development Corporation Ltd. in Madhya Pradesh.\n\n162.\nInternational and domestic consultants will be engaged to form a team to implement the\nTA.  The  consultants  will  be  selected  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of    domestic\nconsultants.  An  estimated  total  of  59  person-months  of  consulting  services  will  be  required,\nincluding  43  person-months  of  international  and  16  person-months  of  domestic  consulting\nservices.  TA  implementation  is  expected  to  commence  in  March  2002  and  be  completed  by\nNovember 2002. The TA is described in detail in Appendix 12.\n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES\n\n163.

Adoption of an\noverall\ndevelopment\npolicy setting the\nterms and\nconditions for\nprivate sector\nparticipation in\ninfrastructure\ndevelopment.\n\nAndhra Pradesh (AP) enacted\nthe Infrastructure Development\nEnabling Act (IDEA) in\nSeptember 2001. The act\nprovides for the accelerated\ndevelopment of infrastructure in\nAP; attraction of private sector\nparticipation in the designing,\nfinancing, construction,\noperation; and maintenance of\ninfrastructure projects in AP;\nand provides a legislative\nframework for reducing\nadministrative and procedural\ndelays, details various\nincentives; and lays down\nprocedures for reconciliation\nand disputes.\n\nGujarat has adopted legislation on\nprivate sector participation in\ninfrastructure development through\nthe Gujarat Infrastructure\nDevelopment Act, 1999 (GIDA). The\nGIDA provides a framework for\nprivate sector participation in the\nfinancing, construction,\nmaintenance and operation of\ninfrastructure projects and for that\npurpose established the Gujarat\nInfrastructure Development Board\n(GIDB).\n\nKarnataka has issued a government\norder for a state policy on\ninfrastructure. This is expected to\nprovide the basis for an enabling\nbuild-operate-transfer (BOT) act.\nKarnataka is studying both the GIDA\n(Gujarat) as well as IDEA (AP) for\nestablishing a state-level BOT act.\nConsequently, Karnataka proposes to\nsubmit draft legislation for a BOT act\nby March 2002.\n\nMadhya Pradesh (MP) has\nan economic development\npolicy that stresses on\ninfrastructure development\nthrough public-private\npartnership. Individual\nsector policies covered\nunder the economic\ndevelopment policy are\npower, roads, urban\ninfrastructure, information\ntechnology, industrial\nestates, and special\neconomic zones. This\npolicy is proposed to\nprovide the basis for an\nenabling BOT act.\nConsequently, MP is\npreparing to submit draft\nlegislation for the enabling\nBOT act by end of 2001.\n\n5\n1\n\n2. Establishment\nof an institutional\nframework to\nfacilitate private\nsector participation\nin infrastructure\nthat provides a\nformal mandate to\ndeal with the\nprivate sector on\nmatters\nconcerning private\nsector\nparticipation.\n\nAP has established an\ninstitutional framework as part\nof IDEA for facilitating private\nsector participation. At the\ncenter of this framework is the\nInfrastructure Authority created\nunder IDEA. Either the\nInfrastructure Authority or the\nconcerned line department can\nidentify or conceptualize any\ninfrastructure project. The\ngovernment agency or the line\ndepartment will provide all\nfacilities for obtaining statutory\nclearances at state level.\n\nGIDB was established with a formal\nmandate to deal with the private\nsector. Its functions include:\n(i) draw up the state infrastructure\nagenda; (ii) identify potential\nprojects, prepare feasibility reports,\nand conduct bidding for projects;\nand (iii) act as one-stop facility for\napprovals, licenses and incentives\nconcerning infrastructure projects.\n\nKarnataka has designated the\nDepartment of Industry and\nCommerce as the focal state agency\nto facilitate private sector participation\nin infrastructure. Within the\nDepartment of Industry and\nCommerce is the Infrastructure\nDevelopment Department that\nfacilitates project development and the\nimplementation of infrastructure\nprojects. The infrastructure projects\nare executed by the individual line\ndepartments such as the Karnataka\nPower Corporation Ltd.for power,\nKarnataka Urban Infrastructure\nDevelopment Corporation for urban\n\nEstablished a high\npowered Economic\nDevelopment Board,\nheaded by the chief\nminister, to give clearances\nfor large private sector\ninfrastructure projects. The\nprincipal secretary (finance)\nheads the Economic\nEmpowered Committee\ncomposed of senior\nsecretaries to provide\nclearances for concessions\nto be granted on a project\nto project basis.

The\nAMC is a joint venture between\nGIIC (48%), IDFC (26%), and\nCapital India Private Ltd, the\ninvestment banking and financial\nadvisory services arm in Asia of the\nAmerican International Group.\n\nFurther constituting this\nframework are:\n\nThe AP Industrial Infrastructure\nCorporation (APIIC), nodal\nagency that undertakes\nprivatization and the\ndevelopment of other\ninfrastructure projects.\n\nProject Specific SPVs that have\na technical collaboration with\nIL&FS for project development\nand access to IL&FS Project\nDevelopment Fund.\n\nAPIIC has also entered into a\ntechnical collaboration with\nFeedback Ventures, a small but\nwell regarded Delhi-based\nventure capital company, for\nproject development.\n\nThe AP Infrastructure Fund, for\nmeeting project development\nexpenses initially capitalized at\nRs250 million with the AP\nGovernment contributing  Rs50\nmillion. However, thus far,\ninvestments from other sources\nhave yet to materialize.\nThe Infrastructure Authority will\nbe composed of the Chief\nSecretary, Government of AP\nas the Chairman and other\nmembers not exceeding 15, of\nwhich 7 have to be appointed\nby the Government of AP, and\nthe balance will be experts\ndrawn from various fields. The\nInfrastructure Authority will take\nover the activities of the Task\nForce for infrastructure projects\nearlier appointed by the state.\nThe Infrastructure Authority\npolicy activities will include,\n\n3. Establishment\nof a formal\ngovernment\nsupported\norganizational\nstructure that will\nserve as a one-\nstop facility for\nsecuring\napprovals,\nlicenses, and\nclearances for\nprivate\ninfrastructure\nprojects.\n\nSet up through the GIDB under\nGIDA. GIDB is composed of the\nchairman, vice-chairman, member-\nsecretary appointed by the state\ngovernment and other members,\nnot exceeding 15 appointed by the\nGovernment. The functions of GIDB\nare, to (i) promote private\nparticipation in financing,\nconstruction, maintenance, and\noperation of infrastructure projects\nby the private sector; (ii) advise the\nGovernment on (i) above; (iii) lay\ndown priorities of projects to be\nundertaken by the private sector in\n\ninfrastructure, and Karnataka Road\nDevelopment Corporation for the road\nsector. The state is also studying the\ninstitutional framework of the other\nselected states to consider whether it\nwould be appropriate in its case to\nalso organize a separate, autonomous\nbody for dealing with private sector\ninfrastructure projects.\n\nInfrastructure Development\nCorporation (Karnataka) Ltd. (iDeck)\nwas formed to help the state\ngovernment establish state priorities in\ninfrastructure, conceptualize and\ndevelop commercially viable\ninfrastructure projects, and prepare\nmodel contracts and agreement.\nIDeck is owned by the state\ngovernment (49%), IDFC (49.5%) and\nHousing Development Finance\nCorporation (1.5%). The state\ngovernment is to extend one-time\nsupport by investing Rs2billion as\nequity and debt to be raised from the\ninfrastructure cess of 5 percent being\nlevied under the Excise Act, Motor\nvehicles Taxation Act, Taxation Act,\nSales Tax Act and Stamp Act..\n\nThe State Department of Industries\nand Commerce has a single clearance\nwindow that acts as the one-stop\nfacility for securing approvals,\nlicenses, and clearances for private\ninfrastructure projects. A high level\ncommittee chaired by the minister of\nlarge and  medium industries\napproves all investment proposals\nabove Rs500 million while the state\nlevel single window agency considers\napproval of projects up to Rs500\nmillion.\n\nprojects for private sector\nparticipation, MP proposes\nto have an infrastructure\ninitiative fund to provide\nnoncommercial seed funds\nfor project development\nprocess. Madhya Pradesh\nState Industrial and\nInfrastructure Development\nCorporation (MPSIDC) has\nbeen appointed as the\nimplementing and\nfacilitating agency for\npublic-private partnerships\nby the Economic\nDevelopment Board. MP\nhas also enacted the\nInfrastructure Investment\nFund Board Act to raise\nfunds under state\nguarantee to be provided\nas grant for leveraging\nprivate sector participation\nin the road sector.\n\nEstablished through the\nEconomic Powered\nCommittee under the\nEconomic Development\nBoard, the concerned line\ndepartment prepares the\ninfrastructure projects and\nMPIDC has been\nmandated to evaluate the\nprojects and have them\ncleared by the Economic\nDevelopment Board.

The Gujarat Roads and\nBuilding Department identified\nseven projects to be undertaken by\nthe private sector. The Gujarat\nState Road Development\nCorporation was incorporated to\nmanage funds and ensure efficiency\nof investments. Two toll road\nprojects has since been\ncommissioned by the private sector.\nThe government has developed a\nmodel concession agreement for\nprivate sector participation in roads.\n\nzone, airports, and information\ntechnology. Karnataka is in the\nprocess of revising its sector polices\nthrough a new infrastructure policy\nwhich is expected by end 2001.\n\nfor power, road, urban\ninfrastructure, information\ntechnology, and special\neconomic zones.\n\nThe enabling legislation for road policy\nand operation in the state is the\nMeasure Highways Act (1964) and the\nMeasure Highways Rules, 1965.  As\nmodified by the Karnataka Highways\n(Amendment Act) (1988). The body\nlegislation covers principles, rules and\nprocedures for compensation for\nexpropriated lands, encroachment\nlevying of tolls, levying of betterment\ncharges and penalties. To encourage\nprivate participation, the state\ngovernment will offer projects under\nthree options namely, BOO, BOT, and\nBOOT schemes without government\nguarantee. Projects marginally viable\nwill have government participation as\nrequired, projects which are not\ncommercially viable would be taken\nup by the state government.\nInfrastructure policy was announced\nfor private sector participation in road,\nbridges, and flyovers projects. The\nKarnataka Road Development\nCorporation was established in July\n1999 to construct and facilitate BOT\nand BOOT projects.

However, huge development challenges\nremain with India\u2019s low per capita income and a population of around 1 billion. More than 300\nmillion  people  live  below  the  poverty  line,  and  physical  and  social  infrastructure  remain\ninadequate.\n\n2.\nThe  latest  National  Sample  Survey  (NSS)  2000  in  India  reveals  a  sharp  decline  in  the\npercentage of population living below the poverty line to 26 percent compared with 36 percent in\n1993/94.  (The  NSS  2000  results  may  not  be  fully  comparable  with  earlier  surveys  due  to\nmethodological  changes.)  This  improvement  is  also  reflected  in  the  focal  states  of  the  Asian\nDevelopment Bank (ADB) (viz., Gujarat, Kerala, and Madhya Pradesh). For example, poverty in\nGujarat  declined  from  24  percent  in  1993/94  to  14  percent  in  1999/2000,  in  Kerala  from  27\npercent to about 13 percent, and in Madhya Pradesh from 43 percent to 37 percent.\n\n3.\nHowever, the number of poor remains high due to the continued increase in population.\nWhile  the  proportion  of  population  living  below  the  poverty  line  has  dropped  considerably,  the\nabsolute  number  of  poor  increased  to  over  300  million  reflecting  India\u2019s  continued  high\npopulation  growth.  Substantial  interstate  and  intrastate  variations,  and  urban-rural  disparities\ncharacterize this increase. These disparities are also reflected in the limited access of the poor\nto social services, compounding intergenerational poverty.\n\n4.\nGeographically, the poor are mainly concentrated in the eastern and central parts of the\ncountry,  with  the  highest  incidence  in  Bihar,  Orissa,  Uttar  Pradesh,  and  Madhya  Pradesh.  In\nrural  areas,  which  account  for  75  percent  of  the  population,  about  37  percent  live  below  the\npoverty  line  compared  with  about  32  percent  in  urban  areas  in  1993/94.  Moreover,  poverty  in\nrural Bihar and Assam was 3-5 times as widespread (58 percent and 45 percent, respectively)\nas  in  rural  Pujab  (12  percent).  While  urban  poverty  is  highly  concentrated  in  a  few  states\nincluding Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan, the incidence of urban poverty is\nalso high in the larger metropolitan areas such as Kolkata and Mumbai. Economic groups most\nprone  to  poverty  are  rural  households  (mainly  agricultural  laborers),  urban  casual  labor\nhouseholds, and the self-employed.\n\nWhile  other  countries  have  the  bulk  of  their  poor  residing  in  rural  areas,  in  India  large\n5.\nnumbers of poor live both in rural and urban areas. Twenty seven percent of the population in\nrural areas are poor compared with about 24 percent in urban areas.\n\nUrban  centers,  such  as  Mumbai  and  Kolkata,  face  huge  challenges  in  the  future  as\n6.\nthese megacities continue to grow. In rural areas, agricultural laborers and small-scale farmers\nbear  the  brunt  of  poverty.  Lack  of  access  to  arable  land,  limited  opportunities  for  wage  labor,\nlack of education, shortage of capital, and poor management of natural resources, has proven\nto be fundamental causes of poverty.\n\nB. \n\nGovernment Challenges\n\nThe  Government  of  India  recognizes  that  poverty  is  much  more  than  lack  of  income.\n7.\nApart  from  the  incidence  of  income  poverty,  limited  access  of  the  poor  to  social  services  and\ncontinued  high  levels  of  illiteracy  (the  literacy  rate  was  54  percent  in  1997)  have  perpetuated.\n\n\f62\n\nAppendix 9 page 2\n\nThe  wider  dimensions  of  poverty  including  vulnerability,  powerlessness,  and  social  exclusion\nare  also  factors  affecting  the  poor.  Increasing  the  ability  of  the  poor  to  fully  participate  in\ndecisions, which affect their lives, is being reflected in the Government supporting the increased\ndevolution  of  authority  and  responsibility  from  the  states  to  rural  and  urban  local  bodies.\nStrengthening  institutional  and  decision-making  processes  involving  civil  society  and  the  poor\nare key Government priorities.\n\n8.\nThese  will  also  be  reflected  in  the  Government\u2019s  preparations  of  the  approach  to  the\n10th  Five-Year  Plan  (2002-2007).  The  High-Level  Forum  and  Poverty  Reduction  Partnership\nAgreement will be linked with the Government\u2019s plan preparation and thus will ensure that the\nkey  priorities  of  the  country  strategy  and  program  (CSP)  and  ADB\u2019s  country  focus  are  fully\nconsistent  with  India\u2019s  developmental  needs  as  well  as  ADB\u2019s  strategic  emphasis  on  poverty\nreduction.\n\n9.\nAchieving  sustainable  poverty  reduction  through  generation  of  productive  employment\nopportunities  and  increased  incomes  resulting  from  faster  and  broad-based  economic  growth\nremains an important factor.\n\n10.\nEconomic  growth  success  will  depend  on  the  Government\u2019s  ability  to  address  the\ncountry\u2019s  structural  weaknesses  particularly  in  the  infrastructure  sector  and  public  finances.  It\nwill  also  be  essential  that  support  for  social  infrastructure  and  human  development  be\nstrengthened to make the reform process sustainable. Investments are needed in key areas of\nthe  economy,  particularly,  power,  roads,  and  transportation,  to  assist  in  keeping  pace  with\ndevelopments  in  the  overall  economy  and  to  create  an  environment  that  is  conducive  to  a\nsustainable  poverty-reducing  growth  plan.  Given  the  enormous  resource  requirements  for\nimprovements  in  infrastructure,  one  of  the  challenges  will  be  Government  efforts  to  promote\ngreater private sector investments, long-term frameworks and policy incentive mechanisms, and\ncoordination  of  different  government  agencies  for  developing  and  implementing  major\ninfrastructure programs.\n\nThe  Government  is  continuing  its  efforts  to  implement  its  priority  reform  program\n11.\nfocusing  on  macroeconomic  and  structural  reforms, \nincluding  developing  an  enabling\nenvironment  for  private  sector  development,  financial  sector  and  capital  market  reforms,  and\ndecentralization.\n\nC.\n\nMeasuring  Impacts  Under  the  Private  Sector  Infrastructure  Facility  at  State  Level\nProject\n\n12.\nPrivate  sector  provision  for  infrastructure  has  great  potential  to  improve  infrastructure\naccess  for  the  poor.  Common  features  of  private-public  partnership  arrangements  include\nexclusivity provisions, universal service obligations, uniform service standards, and reliance on\nsubsidies  to  cover  affordability  gaps.  For  the  poor,  where  public  infrastructure  access  is\ninadequate, and the poor have few means to quality and reliability of service, they must rely on\nother means of infrastructure access, for example, through small private owners of mini buses\nor other vehicles.\n\n13.\nTaking into account the vulnerability dimension of infrastructure investment would mean\nlooking not only at their average impact on the poor but on their impact on the different sectors\nof the poor population.\n\n\f63\n\nAppendix 9 page 3\n\nTable  A9:  Summary  of  Marcoeconomic  Linkages  between  Increased  Private  Sector\n\nInvestment in Infrastructure and Poverty\n\nMacroeconomic Effect\n\nLong-Term Effects\n\nEconomic Growth\n\nShort-Term Expected\nImpacts on Poverty\nFacilitates slowing of rural-\nurban migration\n\nDevelopment of nonfarm\nincomes in rural areas\n\nImproved regulation and\nenhanced competition,\nreduced inequality, more\nequitable treatment and\nimproved public\naccountability\n\nMitigation of negative\nimpacts of transition to\nprivate provision of\ninfrastructure services\nWorkforce often increased\nafter new investments\n\nReduced inflationary\npressures through lower\ncosts of goods and services\nas a result of better\ninfrastructure and improved\nefficiencies\nGreater commercial\noptions and opportunities\nfor infrastructure provision\nand frees up public sector\nfunds for investments in\neducation, health and other\nantipoverty measures\n\nOver the medium to long\nterm, increased private\ninvestment in infrastructure\nshould contribute to growth.\n\nParticular mix of\ninfrastructure investments\nat state level creates\ndemand for goods and\nservices.\nMore efficient management\nand equitable distribution of\nresources\n\nWages may also be\nstandardized or increased\nas employers seek larger\nskill base.\n\nBetter mechanism for\nprovision and management\nof infrastructure creates\ncommercially viable\nopportunities\n\nGovernance\n\nLabor Market\n\nPrices\n\nReallocation of Government\nexpenditures\n\nTotal Net Affect\n\nPositive\n\n\f64\n\nAppendix 10, page 1\n\nSUMMARY OF RESETTLEMENT AND REHABILITATION ACTION PLAN\nAHMEDABAD-MEHSANA TOLL ROAD PROJECT\n\nA.\n\nIntroduction and Scope\n\nThe  Ahmedabad-Mehsana  Toll  Road  is  part  of  Gujarat  State  Highways  (SH-41)  which  is\n1.\n51.6  kilometers  (km)  long  with  a  two-lane  highway  and  60-meter  (m)  right  of  way  (ROW).  The\nproject  is  proposed  to  upgrade  and  widen  the  road  to  four  lanes  of  divided  highway  with  service\nlanes  on  both  sides.  The  project  scope  also  includes  improvements  and  access  to  11.5  km  long\nspur road. Traffic on the main road will be tolled, while the service roads and the spur road will be\ntoll-free.\n\n2.\nAs  part  of  the  detailed  feasibility  study  of  the  project,  a  detailed  social  assessment  was\nundertaken.  The  assessment,  with  an  objective  to  minimize  the  adverse  social  impacts  and  the\nnumber  of  persons  affected,  as  the  first  step,  also  examined  alternate  alignments  for  congested\nroad sections. As a result of this, a 2.08 km bypass is proposed at Sertha village.\n\nSubsequently,  as  part  of  project \n\nthe  detailed  Resettlement  and\n3.\nRehabilitation  Action  Plan  (RRAP)  was  prepared  based  on  a  100  percent  census  and  household\nlevel socioeconomic survey of affected persons and inventory of all the losses due to the project.\nThis is a summary of that RRAP.\n\nimplementation \n\nB.\n\nROW Acquisition - Extent and Impacts\n\n4. \nSummary  Land  Requirement:  The  existing  ROW  of  60  meters  (m)  is  sufficient  for\nconstruction  and  upgrading  of  the  project  road,  except  at  Sertha  village  where  a  bypass  is\nproposed as an alternative. The bypass passes through 72 revenue plots encompassing an area of\n12.1067 hectares (ha) comprising predominantly private agricultural lands. Of the 72 plots, 65 are\nprivate  lands  owned  by  49  titleholders  comprising  of  79  families.  The  rest  of  the  plots  belong  to\nSertha  Grampanchayat,  Gandhinagar  Collectorate,  and  others.  The  land  acquisition  from  private\nparties amounts to 8.8557 ha.\n\n5.\nImpacts Due to Loss of Agricultural Land: Total private agricultural land being acquired\ndue to this project is 8.8553 ha comprising 65 plots, affecting 79 families, the majority of whom (59)\nwill lose less than 15 percent of their landholding. However, 39 families will be left with less than\nthe minimum economic landholding (MEL)1 after land acquisition (LA).\n\nLoss of Structures and Utilities: The land acquisition for the bypass will affect private and\n6.\ncommunity structures and utilities: three private defunct irrigation wells and one farmhouse with a\nsmall  temple,  as  well  as  a  community  cattle  drinking  water  trough.  In  addition,  16  temples,  5\nroadside drinking water posts, 3 toilet blocks, and 15 bus stops in the existing ROW of the road will\nneed to be relocated.\n\n8. \nEncroachers  and  Squatters:  The  clearing  of  existing  ROW  will  affect  13  residential\nstructures  encroaching  into  the  ROW  and  4  residential  squatters  located  within  the  ROW.  The\nROW  clearance  will  render  the  13  squatters  homeless,  necessitating  relocation.  However,  the\nresidences encroaching the ROW will only be partially affected.\n\n                                                     \n1  MEL: Minimum economic landholding is the size of plot that enables the cultivator to maintain an economic status just\nabove the poverty line, where the poverty line is pegged at Rs30,000. The MEL in the project area is estimated as 1\nha. of irrigated land or 2 has. of unirrigated land based on income from agriculture land.\n\n\f65\n\nAppendix 10, page 2\n\nC.\n\nEntitlement Framework and the RRAP\n\n10.\nEnvironmental  and  Social  Policy  for  Resettlement  and  Rehabilitation  of  the  Ahmendabad-\nMehsana  Toll  Road  Company  Limited  is  based  on  the  Environmental  and  Social  Report  of\nInfrastructure  Leasing  &  Financial  Services  and  the  Private  Sector  Infrastructure  Facility  at  State\nLevel Project, and follows the three principles:\n\n(i)\n(ii)\n(iii)\n\nPrevent adverse social situations.\nMitigate possible adverse social impacts.\nEnhance the quality of life in and around the project.\n\nEntitlement  for  Loss  of  Agricultural  Lands.  The  \"land  for  land\"  option  for  affected\n11.\nfamilies having valid title or customary or usufruct right for their acquired land is considered as the\nmost  appropriate  way  to  compensate  the  agricultural  families.  However,  unavailability  of  surplus\nagricultural land in the project village makes this option difficult to implement. Also, the small plots\nacquired from individual families cannot be replaced due to lack of contiguous lands to supplement\nthe land lost and purchase of such small plots at different places would not be economically viable.\nIn  such  cases,  compensating  for  the  loss  of  land  at  replacement  value  is  considered  appropriate\nand is acceptable to the families. The finalized entitlement package is presented in Table A10, the\nsalient aspects considered while arriving at the entitlement include the\n\nReplacement  Value. The  registered  values  for  the  lands  are  generally  lower  than  their\n12. \nreplacement values. Therefore, the  compensation rates determined by  the government based on\nthe registration value are also lower than the replacement value. The affected families, therefore,\ndo not get adequate compensation to replace their lost assets. Since the lands have already been\nacquired by the government and compensation paid for adequate replacement of their assets, the\nproject provides the difference between the replacement value and the government compensation,\nas rehabilitation assistance (RA). The payment of RA will however be subject to handing over the\nlands to the project company, free from any title litigation and court cases against the award by the\nLand Acquisition Officer. A final replacement value of Rs850,000/ha2, has been at arrived through\npublic information and consultations (PIC) and surveys.\n\nVulnerable  Groups: The  families  living  below  the  poverty  line  (pre  as  well  as  post  LA),\n13. \nfamilies  headed  by  women  and  families  with  physically  or  mentally  handicapped  members  are\nconsidered as vulnerable groups. They need to be provided with special guidance to use the RA\neffectively to establish suitable income generation activities that bring the family above the poverty\nline. The incentives proposed are presented in Table A10.\n\n                                                     \n2  Rs159,000 per ha. has already been paid by the government as part of the LA procedure. Therefore, the RA per ha.\n\nworked out to Rs691,000.\n\n\fTable A10 : Entitlement Package for Affected Agricultural Families\n\n66\n\nAppendix 10, page 3\n\nCategory\n\n%  Loss \nin\nSize of Land\nHolding\n\nPostacquisition\nLandholding\n\nPost L.A Income\nfrom all Sources\n\nEntitlement Package\n\n>PL 3\n\n>PL\n\n<PL\n\n1\n\n<15%\n\n>2MEL\n\n>2PL\n\n>2PL\n\n>1PL <2PL\n\nBetween  1 \nMEL\n\nto  2\n\n2\n\n>15%\n\n>1PL <2PL\n<PL\n\n>MEL\n\n<MEL\n\n<MEL\n\nin \n\ncash  +\nRehabilitation  assistance \ntechnical  guidance  and  other  interventions\nare visualized to increase land productivity .\nRehabilitation  assistance \ncash  +\ntechnical  guidance  and  other  interventions\nland4\nto \nare \nproductivity.\n\nvisualized \n\nincrease \n\nin \n\nincome  generation  activity\nProvision  of \n(IGA)  using  part  or \nfull  amount  of\nrehabilitation  assistance  (RA  remaining\nafter  providing  IGA  will  be  paid  in  cash)  to\ngenerate  PL/4 \nincome  +  maintenance\nallowance for an year @ Rs350/ family per\nmonth for an year.

All  the  community  structures  evaluated  by  engineers  will  be  replaced  with\nnecessary care and public participation.\n\nCommercial  Squatters: The  squatters  prefer  a  self-relocation  option  in  a  nearby\nii. \nplace  with  necessary  shifting  allowance,  therefore  a  self-relocation  measure  will  be\nprovided, where market value of the land occupied by the squatter will be paid in addition to\na shifting allowance. The maximum assistance for self-relocation is estimated at Rs5,000. If\nthe  structures  are  beyond  the  formation  width  of  the  project  road  and  or  amenable  for\nshifting beyond the formation width of the road, the structure will be allowed to remain.\n\nResidential  Squatters/Encroachers:  The  13  residential  structures  encroaching\niii.\nonto the ROW will dismantle their structures and move back onto their own remaining land\nbehind the ROW, and will be compensated at replacement cost for the entire structures. For\nthe  4  squatter  residences,  the  affected  families  opted  for  self-relocation  on  payment  of\ncompensation for the structures currently occupied by them. The compensation for squatter\nfamilies will be paid once they identify structures for self-relocation.\n\nD.\n\nPublic Information and Consultation\n\n13. \nFocus  group  meetings  and  informal  meetings  and  public  information  and  consultation\nmeetings with advance notices were held at different stages of the project development process to\narrive at a meaningful practical and implementable RRAP.

The framework is based on the\nEnvironmental  and  Social  Report  (ESR)  of  Infrastructure  Leasing  &  Financial  Services  Ltd.\n(IL&FS). IL&FS is among the first financing institutions in India to recognize the importance of\nenvironmental  and  social  issues  in  development  of  infrastructure  projects.  Internalization  of\nenvironmental and social considerations in project development has been one of the major\nachievements  of  IL&FS.  The  framework  consists  of  a  well-defined  social  assessment\nprocess, which defines the procedural guidelines to follow as an integral part of the project\ndevelopment cycle. The social assessment process also consists of a detailed framework for\nresettlement  and  rehabilitation  of  project  affected  communities.  These  procedures  will  be\napplicable for all subprojects implemented by various special purpose vehicles (SPVs) for all\nsubloans under PSIF II.\n\nB. \n\nResettlement Policy Framework\n\nthe \n\nThe \n\nto  (i)  address \n\nframework  commits \n\n2.\nlegitimate  concerns  of  relevant\nstakeholders,  especially  persons  affected  by  the  project;  (ii)  avoid  or  minimize  resettlement\ndue to land acquisition through appropriate technical and management measures, involving\nthe  affected  communities;  (iii)  ensure  protection  of  marginalized  and  vulnerable  groups,\nincluding  the  economically  and  socially  disadvantaged,  the  elderly,  women,  children,\nphysically  handicapped,  and  indigenous  people;  and  (iv)  ensure  responsible  resettlement\nand  rehabilitation  of  affected  persons  through  sustainable  livelihood  options  that  at  least\nrestore, if not improve, their standard of living.\n\nThe  framework  stipulates  eligibility  and  entitlement  for  seven  categories:  (i)  loss  of\n3.\nland;  (ii)  loss  of  structure;  (iii)  loss  of  livelihood,  trade,  occupation,  (iv)  loss  of  access  to\ncommon  resources  and  facilities;  (v)  loss  of  standing  crops  and  trees;  (vi)  losses  during\ntransition  of  displaced  persons/establishments;  and  (vii)  losses  to  host  communities.  The\nentitlements  for  the  loss  categories  will  be  appropriately  compensated  in  cash  or  kind\nconsidering the replacement value. The provision of necessary measures for subprojects will\nmitigate impacts on common resources and facilities, host communities, etc.\n\nIn  respect  of  people  losing  land,  the  \u201cland  for  land\u201d  option  will  be  the  first  option\n4.\nconsidered.  However,  unavailability  of  surplus  agricultural  land  is  one  of  the  major\nconstraints in implementing this option. Also this option will not be practical in case of linear\nprojects, as the small plots acquired from individual affected families cannot be replaced due\nto  lack  of  contiguous  lands  to  supplement  the  land  lost.  Purchase  of  such  small  plots  at\ndifferent places would not be economically viable for cultivation. Therefore, compensating for\nthe loss of land at replacement value will be considered as an appropriate option.\n\nThe lands for project development are mostly acquired by government agencies and\n5.\nthe  compensation  paid  is  based  on  registered  values  of  the  land,  which  is  generally  much\nlower than the replacement value. The SPVs will, therefore, evaluate the replacement value\nof the land lost for the subprojects, reach consensus with the affected families and pay the\ndifference in amount as rehabilitation assistance. Because of their vulnerability, families living\nbelow  the  poverty  line,  families  headed  by  women  and  families  with  physically  or  mentally\nhandicapped  members  will  be  considered  for  economic  rehabilitation  establishing  income\n\n\f69\n\nAppendix 11, page 2\n\ngeneration  schemes  (IGS)  using  the  RA.  The  IGS  will  also  have  a  financial  incentive\nmechanism for families to achieve the target income.\n\n6.\nThe loss of structures will be compensated either by providing alternative structures\nor by cash compensation if the family prefers self-relocation. For commercial structures, the\nrelocation  options  considered  will  ensure  that  the  family's  source  of  income  will  not  be\nadversely  affected,  if  need  be  by  providing  economic  rehabilitation.  In  case  of  residential\nstructures,  the  families  will  be  provided  with  an  alternative  house,  which  meets  minimum\nnational  housing  norms.1.  The  constructed  area  and  the  homestead  land  lost  in  excess  of\nstandards will be compensated in cash at replacement value.\n\n7.\nAs  part  of  project  implementation,  the  framework  also  emphasizes  adoption  of\nmeasures  that  enhance  social  conditions  in  project  areas  and  meet  the  objective  of  social\ndevelopment.\n\nC. \n\nSocial Assessment Process (SAP)\n\nThe social assessment process requires the following for a subproject: (i) initial social\n8. \nscreening,  (ii)  scoping  of  social  assessment,  (iii)  analysis  of  project  alternatives  and\nminimization of social impacts, (iv) carrying out detailed social assessment and preparation\nof  a  draft  resettlement  and  rehabilitation  action  plan  (RRAP),  (iv)  preparation  and\nimplementation  of  detailed  RRAP  after  technical  design  and  prior  to  implementation  of  the\nproject.\n\n9. \nThe  social  assessment  process  and  outputs  for  a  subproject  will  be  audited  on  a\nyearly basis, as part of an environment and social audit. The process of social assessment\nwill  be  integrated  with  the  project  development  process  by  the  SPVs,  overseen  by  the\nparticipating financial institutions (PFIs), reviewing the outputs at each of the identified steps.\nFinalizing  an  implementable  RRAP  and  disbursements  will  be  subjected  to  approval  of  the\nAsian Development Bank (ADB).\n\nD. \n\nInstitutional Responsibilities\n\n10. \nThe overall project coordination and financing responsibility lie with the PFIs. As part\nof this responsibility, the PFIs will review the outputs prepared by the SPVs from time to time\nand  approve  the  same  in  compliance  with  social  assessment  process  and  the  framework.\nThe SPV developing and implementing the subprojects will be responsible for implementing\nthe  agreed-upon  RRAPs  including  (i)  identifying  the  people  affected  and  assets  lost  to  the\nsubproject,  (ii)  valuing  assets,  (iii)  identifying  vulnerable  groups,  (iv)  formulation  of\nentitlement  packages  through  effective  public  consultations,  (v)  preparing  implementation\nschedules, (vi) allocating budget for implementation of the RRAP, (vii) publicly disclosing an\nimplementable  RRAP,  (viii)  disbursing  entitlements,  and  (ix)  providing  grievance  redressal.\nThe SPV implementing the project will submit progress reports to the relevant PFI on agreed\nfrequency depending on the nature of the RRAP.\n\n11. \nThe  PFI  will  monitor  and  evaluate  the  progress  of  RRAP  implementation  on  a\npreassigned frequency for a subproject. Through this mechanism, it will be made certain that\nthe  RRAP  objectives  are  completely  achieved.  The  monitoring  will  also  ensure  that  the\nentitlements are disbursed prior to commencement of construction activities on the ground.\n\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)\n1  If the policy objective of improving the socioeconomic status of the family requires, higher entitlement may be\n\nconsidered on a case-to-case basis.\n\n\f70\n\nAppendix 11, page 3\n\nE. \n\nConsultation, Disclosure, and Grievance Redressal\n\n12. \nThe  public  participation  in  the  form  of  informal  meetings,  focus  group  discussions,\nand  public  information  consultation  meetings,  as  applicable  and  necessary,  will  be\ninternalized  at  each  stage  of  project  development.  The  process  will  also  identify  an\ninstitutional mechanism where public grievance will be addressed on a responsive basis as\npart of project implementation.\n\n13. \nThe SPV will translate the RRAP into vernacular language and place it in the project\noffice  disclosing  it  to  the  affected  communities  and  other  interested  parties  through\nadvertisements in local news papers.\n\nF.\n\nMonitoring and Evaluation\n\n14. \nThe  objectives  of  monitoring  and  evaluation  will  be  to  (i)  ensure  consistency  of\nimplementation  with  the  approved  RRAP  and  adherence  to  agreements;  (ii)  check  for\nunforeseen social impacts, respond to public concerns, and undertake corrective measures;\nand  (iii)  review  the  progress  of  IGS  and  provide  necessary  midcourse  corrections  if\nnecessary.  Typically  (i)  and  (ii)  require  short-term  monitoring  if  these  responsibilities  are\naccomplished  during  RRAP  implementation,  which  generally  takes  a  year,  whereas,  the\nsuccess  of  IGS  implementation  and  economic  rehabilitation  may  extend  up  to  three  years.\nTherefore, the overall monitoring and evaluation, if required, would extend up to three years\nfrom the start date of RRAP implementation.\n\n15. \nAs stated, the PFIs will monitor and evaluate the progress of RRAP implementation\non a  preassigned frequency for  a subproject depending on the complexities of the RRAPs.\nThe  schedule  and  indicators  for  monitoring  will  be  specified  in  the  implementation  and\nmonitoring plan depending on the type of project and conditions prevailing. This function also\nincludes  identification  of  unforeseen  negative  impacts  and  taking  corrective  measures\nimmediately. This will ensure that the project is not jeopardized due to lack of timely action\non social issues. The monitoring reports will be shared with ADB for review and approvals.\n\nF. \n\nRRAP Budget\n\nThe  complete  cost  of  implementing  the  RRAP  will  form  part  of  the  subprojects\n16. \ndeveloped  by  the  SPV.
