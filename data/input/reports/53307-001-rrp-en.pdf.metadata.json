The  report  also  describes \nproposed technical assistance (TA) for Capacity Building for Rural Finance Development, and if \nthe Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, \napprove the TA.1 \n \nThe project will enhance access to finance for rural cottage and small industries (CSIs), \n2. \nthereby increasing rural employment and promoting economic development. The project focuses \non (i) expanding collateral-based rural CSI financing through Bhutan Development Bank (BDB), \nBhutan\u2019s key rural finance intermediary; (ii) extending, through BDB, non-collateral-based group \nloans  to  rural  CSIs  that  lack  assets;  (iii)  strengthening  BDB\u2019s  institutional  capacity,  including \nenhancement for rural CSI financing operations; and (iv) providing financial literacy training and \nbusiness  development  support  to  rural  CSIs,  in  particular  CSIs  owned  by  small  and  marginal \nfarmers and women. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nEconomy.  During  2010\u20132019,  Bhutan\u2019s  economy  grew  more  than  6%  annually  on \naverage largely owing to hydropower revenue, which accounts for about a quarter of the gross \ndomestic product (GDP).2 Because of the capital-intensive nature of growth, the economy is not \nwell diversified and unable to create sufficient employment opportunities, especially for youth and \nthe  rural  population.  The  unemployment  rate  was  2.7%  in  2019,  with  youth  unemployment  at \n11.9%.3 Out of a total population of about 807,600, 62.2% live in rural areas where agriculture is \nthe  primary  source  of  livelihood. 4 In  rural  areas,  opportunities  for  both  on-farm  and  off-farm \nemployment are extremely limited and farmers mostly depend on subsistence production of crops \nand  livestock  for  their  living.5 The  government\u2019s  Twelfth  Five  Year  Plan,  2018\u20132023,  aims  to \ndiversify the economy by creating jobs and promoting the private sector, including rural CSIs.6 \n \n4. \nIn 2020, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has caused significant adverse \nimpacts on Bhutan\u2019s economy. Tourism, agriculture, and construction have been particularly hard-\nhit because of labor shortages, decreased external demands, and input supply disruptions. Pre-\npandemic GDP growth was projected at 5.2% for fiscal year (FY) 2020 and 5.8% for FY2021.7 \nHowever, because of the pandemic, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has revised the GDP \n\n \n\n1  Financing partner: the Government of Luxembourg. \n2  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2020.

ADB estimated that about 23,000 \njobs are at risk because of the pandemic. Due to the pandemic\u2019s effect, additional 2,176\u201312,362 \npeople will result in living on less than $1.90 a day (adjusted for purchasing power parity).9  \n \n5. \nGovernment policy. The government\u2019s Twelfth Five Year Plan, 2018\u20132023 specifically \nfocuses on creating income-generating opportunities for vulnerable populations and enhancing \nthe rural economy by promoting CSIs and improving access to finance for CSIs, including startups \nand informal CSIs (footnote 6). The government\u2019s National Financial Inclusion Strategy, 2018\u2013\n2023 envisions enhancing access to affordable formal financial services for all Bhutanese.10 The \nstrategy  specifically  aims  to  enhance  financing  to  (i)  strengthen  priority  economic  activities, \nparticularly agricultural and nonagricultural CSIs; and (ii) promote innovative credit mechanisms \nand alternative sources of financing. \n \n6. \nCottage and small industries. CSIs are micro and small enterprises that are primarily \ninvolved  in  production  of  crops  and  livestock  (on-farm  enterprises),  as  well  as  small-scale \nmanufacturing and services such as retail shops, transport, and restaurants (off-farm enterprises) \n(footnote  5).  Most  CSIs  are  rural-based  cottage-sized  on-farm  enterprises  with  the  investment \nsize below Nu500,000 and run by household members.11 In Bhutan, CSIs constitute more than \n90% of total enterprises and employ about 99,288 people, with 22,064 registered CSIs in 2019. \nIn  addition  to  registered  CSIs,  there  are  many  informal  CSIs.  CSIs  face  various  constraints, \nincluding poor access to finance and bureaucratic hurdles related to labor regulation, taxation, \nand registration. Among these, access to finance is the largest constraint.12 Men- and women-\nowned CSIs face similar challenges; however, these challenges are often greater for women, who \nsuffer from low literacy, low self-confidence, and a lack of education, training, and entrepreneurial \nand technical skills.13 Other key constraints for women-owned CSIs include labor shortages and \ninadequate  business  premises.  As  a  result  of  these  constraints, most  women-owned  CSIs  are \nunable to scale up their businesses, and therefore remain at subsistence level. \n \n7. \nRural  finance.  Bhutan\u2019s  finance  sector  comprises  six  banks,  four  nonbank  financial \ninstitutions  (two  insurance  companies,  one  reinsurance  company,  and  one  pension  fund),  and \nfive microfinance institutions. The six banks are further categorized into four commercial banks, \n\n \n\n8  ADB. 2020. Asian Development Outlook 2020 Supplement: Lockdown, Loosening, and Asia\u2019s Growth Prospects. \nManila.

Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n12 In an enterprise survey conducted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs in 2011, more than 80% of CSIs identified \naccess  to  finance  as  a  major  constraint.

Many CSI owners are illiterate or \nsemiliterate  and  have  limited  financial  literacy, therefore  lack the  capacity  to  develop  business \nproposals, which are needed for financing from formal financial institutions. Commercial banks \nlack  business  expertise  in  CSI  financing  and  impose  stringent  collateral  requirements,  as  per \nstandard  commercial  banking  risk  management  practices.  This  generally  excludes  them  from \nlending  to  CSIs,  most  of  which  do  not  own  sufficient  physical  collateral.  BDB,  the  key  formal \nfinancial  intermediary  with  a  CSI  financing  mandate,  offers  collateral-based  loans  to  CSIs  by \nmostly accepting rural land; however, the value of rural land is difficult to assess. As a result, it \ndoes not facilitate an effective CSI credit risk management. Further, BDB has funding constraints \nand weak financial and operational performance in extending financial services to rural CSIs. BDB \nneeds to improve its credit appraisal methodology to effectively mitigate risks in lending to CSIs. \n \n9. \nBhutan Development Bank. BDB was incorporated in January 1988 with support from \nADB to function as a development finance institution.15 BDB obtained its banking license in March \n2010. The government owns 97% of the total paid-up capital. BDB\u2019s key function is to provide \nfinancial services to agricultural, commercial, and industrial enterprises, especially CSIs. BDB is \nthe  most  important  rural  finance  intermediary  in  the  country,  accounting  for  95%  of  the  total \nagriculture loan portfolio and 84% of the CSI loan portfolio in 2019.16 In 2019, BDB\u2019s total gross \nloans  amounted  to  Nu20  billion,  with  50,501  rural  CSI  borrowers,  of  which  41%  were  women. \nBDB\u2019s funding sources are limited\u201484% of BDB\u2019s funding comes from customer deposits, 5% \ncomprises  borrowing  from  other  commercial  banks,  1%  is  derived  from  investments,  and  the \nremainder is equity. BDB also provides non-collateral-based group loans (group loans) to enable \nCSIs with no or little collateral to access to finance. However, group loans constitute only about \n1% of BDB\u2019s total loan portfolio.17 \n \n10. \nBDB\u2019s  financial  performance,  in  particular  its  capital  adequacy,  asset  quality,  and \nprofitability,  is  weak  (Table  1).  ADB\u2019s  financial  due  diligence  and  financial  management \nassessment  found  that  BDB  does  not  fully  meet  ADB  eligibility  criteria  for  financial \nintermediaries.18 BDB  is  undercapitalized  and  its  capital  adequacy  ratio  is  below  the  minimum \ncapital  adequacy  ratio  of  12.5% set  by  the  Royal  Monetary  Authority  (RMA), the  central  bank. \nBDB\u2019s  financial  sustainability  is  weakened  by  nonperforming  loans  (NPLs)\u2014its  NPL  ratio  was \n\n \n\n14 National CSI Bank was established in February 2020 by converting the Rural Enterprise Development Corporation \nLimited, a microfinance institution established by the government in 2016. Based on ADB\u2019s financial due diligence \nand financial management assessment and because of its small size (about 0.2% of the total finance sector portfolio), \nNational CSI Bank was not considered for financing under the project. \n\n15 ADB. 1988. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the Kingdom \n\nof Bhutan for the Bhutan Development Finance Corporation Project. Manila. \n\n16 Rural finance is defined as financial services in rural areas. Rural CSI financing is a subset of rural finance. However, \nin Bhutan, most rural clients of financial intermediaries are CSIs. Accordingly, rural finance and rural CSI financing \nare largely synonymous. \n\n17 Under group loans, loans are made to individual group members and members guarantee other members\u2019 loans. \n18 ADB. 2003.

The key eligibility criteria include \n(i) financial soundness; (ii) adequate credit and risk management policies, operating systems, and procedures; (iii) \ncompliance with prudential regulations; and (iv) acceptable corporate and financial governance.

This  high  NPL  ratio  largely  stemmed  from  BDB\u2019s  inadequate  credit  appraisal \nmethodology for rural CSIs, as well as natural calamities\u2014heavy rainfall and flooding in 2016 led \nto a nearly 100% increase in NPLs in 2017, as most of BDB\u2019s CSI loans are agriculture-related. \nHowever, the NPL ratio of 23.16% for 2019 does not present an accurate picture of BDB\u2019s portfolio \nquality because BDB carries loans classified as loss for more than 3 years\u2014legacy NPLs\u2014on its \nbalance sheet. 19 If legacy NPLs were written off, BDB\u2019s estimated NPL ratio would have been \n16.22%  in  2019.  COVID-19  response  measures  by  the  RMA  to  relief  affected  borrowers  by \nrelaxing some repayment obligations negatively affected BDB\u2019s portfolio quality further in 2020.20 \nTo  address  these  deficiencies,  ADB  and  BDB  have  agreed  to  a  time-bound  BDB  institutional \nstrengthening plan.     \n \n\nTable 1: Bhutan Development Bank Key Financial and Operational Indicators \n2020b \n\n2019a \n\n2018 \n\n2016 \n\n2017 \n\nParticulars \n\nCAR (%) \nTotal gross loan  \n(Nu million) \nNPL ratio (%) \n\nROAE (%) \n\n16.60 \n\n10.40 \n\n12.50 \n\n11.56 \n\n10.41 \n\n16,546.66 \n\n18,498.52 \n\n18,613.00 \n\n19,655.71 \n\n19,749.62 \n\n12.47 \n\n9.27 \n\n22.72 \n\n-33.27 \n\n20.72 \n\n9.06 \n\n23.16c \n\n7.74 \n\n37.00c \n\n-2.67 \n\n1.42 \n\nROAA (%) \n\n-29.31 \n-3.95 \nCAR = capital adequacy ratio, NPL = nonperforming loan, ROAA = return on average assets, ROAE = return on \naverage equity. \na  As of September 2019. \nb   Projections. \nc  Including legacy NPLs; if legacy NPLs are written off, the NPL ratio would be 16.22% in 2019. \nSources: Bhutan Development Bank, Annual Reports, various years, Thimphu; and Asian Development Bank \nestimates. \n\n0.50 \n\n0.88 \n\n \n11. \nKey  issues.  Key  constraints  for  the  overall  rural  finance  sector  are  summarized  as  (i) \nBDB\u2019s weak operational and financial performance, including inadequate institutional capacity in \nCSI financing; (ii) BDB\u2019s insufficient operationalization of non-collateral-based loans for CSIs that \nlack  assets;  (iii)  CSIs\u2019  limited  financial  literacy;  (iv)  CSIs\u2019  lack  of  skills  to  develop  adequate \nbusiness proposals; and (v) BDB\u2019s limited funding sources. \n \nProposed solution. The project will provide financing support to BDB to expand its rural \n12. \nCSI  financing  outreach  under  ADB\u2019s  financial  intermediation  loan  modality.  The  project  will \nprovide credit lines to BDB for (i) collateral-based rural CSI financing, and (ii) non-collateral-based \ngroup  loans.  For  collateral-based  rural  CSI  financing,  BDB  will  adopt  collateral  requirements \nestablished by BDB using a credit appraisal methodology acceptable to ADB. For non-collateral-\nbased  group  loans,  BDB  will  mainly  target  rural  CSIs  that  are  owned  by  small  and  marginal \nfarmers and women who do not own sufficient physical assets for collateral. The attached TA will \ndevelop BDB\u2019s capacity to provide nonfinancial services essential to rural CSI clients, including \nfinancial  literacy  training  and  business  development  support.  The  financial  intermediation  loan \nmodality was chosen to achieve the dual objectives of (i) expanding financing outreach to rural \nCSIs, and (ii) strengthening BDB\u2019s capacity to ensure operational sustainability. \n\n \n\n19 The major constraints that prevent BDB from expediting write-off of its legacy NPLs are (i) lengthy legal process, (ii) \ndifficulties disposing rural collateral, and (iii) issues related to income tax provisions. BDB can legally write off legacy \nNPLs,  but  requires  a  prior  approval  from  the  RMA.  The  IMF  recommends  that  the  RMA  issues  guidelines  to \nencourage banks to write off legacy NPLs. IMF. 2018. Article IV Consultation\u2014Press Release; Staff Report; and \nStatement by the Executive Director for Bhutan. Washington, DC. \n\n20 On 14 April 2020, the RMA announced monetary measures in response to COVID-19 including (i) deferment of loan \nrepayments, (ii) waiving interest rates on outstanding loans, (iii) extension of grace period, (iv) soft working capital \nloans for tourism-related businesses, and (v) subsidized loans to CSIs through National CSI Bank. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fThe project will strengthen BDB\u2019s institutional capacity by supporting the implementation \n13. \nof  BDB  institutional  strengthening  plan.  Selected  institutional  strengthening  milestones  are  set \nforth  in  the  project  administration  manual  (PAM). 21 BDB\u2019s  weaknesses  can  be  improved  with \nstructured  interventions  focusing  on  governance,  portfolio  quality  including  NPL  management, \nand  internal  control  and  risk  management,  among  others.  ADB  established  that  BDB  has \nadequate capacity, organizational structure, and human resources to implement the plan. BDB \nhas commenced implementation of the plan and has (i) established a dedicated NPL resolution \nunit;  (ii)  developed  a  comprehensive  NPL  resolution  framework;  (iii)  adopted  a  new  credit \nappraisal  system  that  incorporates  subproject-specific,  risk-based  analysis;  and  (iv)  initiated \nintensified  portfolio  monitoring.  Through  those  measures,  BDB  can  effectively  control  portfolio \nquality, resolve NPLs, and improve its financial performance. Specifically, intensifying BDB\u2019s debt \nrecovery litigation and asset auctioning capacity under the NPL resolution framework will enable \nBDB to expedite NPL write-offs, including legacy NPLs. With the improved credit appraisal system, \nBDB can substantially reduce credit risks and prevent new NPLs. Furthermore, BDB will adopt \nappropriate  institutional  operational  policies,  including  improved  credit  manuals  and  a \ncomprehensive internal control and compliance framework, by December 2021, and an enhanced \naccounting policy and financial administration by-laws by June 2022. \n \n14. \nADB\u2019s sector experience and lessons. The project builds on ADB\u2019s successful finance \nsector project experience in Bhutan. In 2007, ADB approved the Micro, Small, and Medium-Sized \nEnterprises  Sector  Development  Program. 22  The  program  successfully  facilitated  BDB\u2019s \nreorientation  toward  micro,  small,  and  medium-sized  enterprise  lending.  ADB  approved  the \nFinancial Market Development Program (subprogram 1) in 2019 and subprogram 2 in 2020, which \nwill strengthen mobilization of resources and enhance stability and inclusiveness in the finance \nsector. 23 \n \n15. \nAlignment with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030. The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 \noperational  priorities  of  (i)  addressing  remaining  poverty  and  reducing  inequalities,  (ii) \naccelerating  progress  in  gender  equality,  and  (iii)  strengthening  governance  and  institutional \ncapacity. 24  The  project  will  promote  rural  employment  generation  and  poverty  reduction  by \nenhancing  rural  CSI  financing.  The  project  will  have  a  visible  impact  on  gender  equality  by \nextending access to finance to at least 31,857 CSIs owned by women by 2024. The project will \nstrengthen BDB\u2019s institutional capacity and have a sustainable rural development impact. \n \nB. \n \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: productive and gainful rural employment \n16. \nopportunities generated (footnote 6).

The \n17. \nproject will finance a $15 million credit line for BDB to expand collateral-based loans to rural CSIs. \nBDB  will  finance  rural  CSIs  that  are  engaged  in  small-scale  enterprise  activities  such  as  crop \ncultivation,  livestock  production,  retail  shops,  and  restaurants.  Eligible  subborrowers  are  rural \nCSIs with an investment size of less than Nu10 million. The maximum rural CSI subloan amount \nis Nu7.5 million. With this credit line, BDB can leverage its rural CSI financing from Nu11.5 billion \nand 50,501 borrowers (of which 41% were CSIs owned by women) in 2019, to Nu17.3 billion with \n63,714 borrowers (of which 50% are CSIs owned by women) by 2024. \n \n18. \nOutput 2: Non-collateral-based rural cottage and small industry financing expanded. \nTo meet the needs of marginal rural CSIs lacking sufficient physical collateral to access financing \nfrom  commercial  banks,  the  project  will  finance  a  $5  million  credit  line  for  BDB  to  extend  non-\ncollateral-based group loans to rural CSIs. Group-loan subborrowers will be limited to rural CSIs \nengaged  in  micro-scale  enterprises,  with  an  investment  size  of  less  than  Nu1  million,  that  are \nsmaller than rural CSI financing subborrowers and have few or no tangible assets that can qualify \nas collateral. Group-loan subborrowers need to show their willingness to join a group and guarantee \nother group members\u2019 loans. The maximum group-loan amount is Nu500,000. With this credit line, \nBDB will reach at least 4,996 group-loan subborrowers, of which 65% are women, by 2024. \n \n19. \nOutput  3:  Bhutan  Development  Bank\u2019s  institutional  capacity  strengthened.  To \naddress  BDB\u2019s  operational  and  financial  weaknesses,  in  particular  its  high  level  of  NPLs,  the \nproject will strengthen BDB by supporting the implementation of BDB\u2019s institutional strengthening \nplan.  The  plan\u2019s  objective  is  to  bring  structural  and  operational  changes  to  improve  BDB\u2019s \nperformance and outreach, especially to rural CSIs. The BDB institutional strengthening plan is \nfocused on, but is not limited to (i) strengthening corporate governance, (ii) improving portfolio \nquality  and  resolving  NPLs,  (iii)  initiating  new  credit  appraisal  methodologies,  (iv)  improving \nmanagement information systems, and (v) strengthening internal control and risk management. \nTo  ensure  that  BDB\u2019s  performance  improves,  key  institutional  strengthening  milestones  and \nperformance targets are included in the PAM (footnote 21). BDB will provide quarterly reports to \nADB on progress in the institutional strengthening plan\u2019s implementation, including achievement \nof  milestones  and  targets,  and  the  government  will  ensure  that  BDB  implements  remedial \nmeasures in case of non-achievement.

The government will relend the loan proceeds to BDB pursuant to a subsidiary \n23. \nloan  agreement.  The  government  expects  to  structure  the  subsidiary  loan  as  follows:  (i)  $15 \nmillion of the subsidiary loan as a subordinated debt;28 and (ii) $5 million of the subsidiary loan as \nan unsubordinated debt. Tentatively, the subsidiary loan of $15 million subordinated debt will have \na 10-year term with no grace period, interest rate of 5.0% per year; and such other terms and \nconditions to be set forth in the subsidiary loan agreement between the government and BDB; \nand the subsidiary loan of $5 million unsubordinated debt will have a 10-year term with no grace \nperiod, an interest rate of 4.0% per year, and such other terms and conditions to be set forth in \nthe subsidiary agreement between the government and BDB. The final subsidiary loan terms and \nconditions  for  relending  will  be  determined  in  the  subsidiary  loan  agreement  between  the \ngovernment and BDB. BDB will use the subsidiary loan proceeds to sub-lend to eligible rural CSIs \nunder  the  two  credit  lines: (i)  collateral-based rural  CSI  financing,  and (ii)  non-collateral-based \ngroup loans \u2500 established under outputs 1 and 2 of the project. \n \n24. \nCSI subborrowers based on each credit line\u2019s eligibility criteria and terms and conditions: \n\nSublending. BDB will sublend the subsidiary loan proceeds from the government to rural \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nCollateral-based  rural  CSI  financing.  An  eligible  rural  CSI  subborrower  (a)  is  an \nenterprise  with  an  investment  size  of  less  than  Nu10  million;  (b)  is  composed  of \nindividuals who are no younger than 18 years old; (c) is borrowing subloans against \nwhich  fixed  or  financial  assets  are  pledged,  based  on  collateral  requirements \nestablished by BDB using a credit appraisal methodology acceptable to ADB; (d) or its \nmembership have no record of NPLs with BDB or other financial institutions; and (e) \nhas demonstrated experience relevant to its proposed subproject. Rural CSI subloan \ninterest rates and maturity vary depending on types of activities and underlying risks \nof rural CSI subprojects. However, subloan interest rates should be adequate to cover \nall costs and risks associated with subprojects and ensure an adequate margin. \nNon-collateral-based  group  loans.  An  eligible  group-loan  subborrower  (a)  is  an \nenterprise with an investment size of less than Nu1 million; (b) has demonstrated that \nit  cannot  offer  fixed  or  financial  assets  against  which  to  borrow  subloans;  (c)  is \ncomposed of individuals who are no younger than 18 years old; (d) has completed all \nnecessary  preparatory  work  prior  to  applying  for  a  subloan,  including  requirements \nestablished  by  BDB \nfor  demonstrating  collective  membership;  and  (e)  has \ndemonstrated that its membership has participated in group sensitization and training \nactivities  regarding  the  obligations  of  the  qualified  enterprise  and  its  individual \nmembers. The indicative sublending terms and conditions are an interest rate of 10% \nper annum, with a maturity of up to 5 years for group term loans, and up to 1 year for \ngroup seasonal loans.29 \n\n25. \nRevolving fund (at BDB). The subloans repaid by subborrowers will be maintained at a \nseparate rural CSI financing account and group-loan fund account established at BDB. BDB will \nsublend to eligible subborrowers under the project\u2019s same onlending terms and conditions. The \nsame subborrower eligibility criteria will apply to rural CSI financing and group loans. \n\n28 In a bank\u2019s capital, a subordinated debt is qualified as a part of capital. The government\u2019s subordinated debt to BDB \n\nwill help improve BDB\u2019s capital adequacy. \n\n29 Group term loans are mainly for investments and group seasonal loans are mainly for working capital. \n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fImplementation Arrangements \n\nE. \n \nThe implementation period for the project is 4 years (January 2021\u2013December 2024).

The TA has two outputs, which are aligned with the project: (i) BDB\u2019s institutional \ncapacity  strengthened,  and  (ii)  financial  literacy  training  and  business  development  support \nextended to rural CSIs. \n \n28. \nADB  will  administer  the  TA.  ADB\u2019s  South  Asia  Department  will  select,  supervise,  and \nevaluate the consultants. ADB will recruit international and national consultants using individual \nconsultant selection. ADB will procure consulting services following the ADB Procurement Policy \n(2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  the  staff  instructions  for  ADB-administrated \nconsultants.30 The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, of which $750,000 will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6); and $250,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by Financial Sector Development Partnership Special Fund.31 \n \n\n \n\n30 The required consultant inputs include (i) international technical advisor to BDB (6 person-months), (ii) international \nbank restructuring specialist (16 person-months), (iii) international bank capacity development specialist (16 person-\nmonths), (iv) international rural finance specialist (16 person-months), (v) national core banking system specialist (9 \nperson-months), (vi) national environmental and social safeguards specialist (3 person-months), and (vii) national \ngender  specialist  (5  person-months).

The attached TA addresses this constraint by assisting the government in developing and \nimplementing  the  BDB  institutional  strengthening  plan.  BDB\u2019s  expertise  in  rural  enterprise \nfinancing  is  also  limited.  The  attached  TA  will  support  capacity  building  of  BDB  in  rural  CSI \nfinancing  especially  for  non-collateral-based  group  loans  by  updating  group-loan  manuals  to \ninclude improved credit underwriting processes, and developing a group-loan operational plan. \n \nB. \n \n30. \nThe  unmet  financial  need  for  rural  CSIs  is  estimated  at  Nu24.89  billion  (about \n$331.91 million). 32  The  project  will  result  in  enhanced  access  to  finance  for  rural  CSIs  that \notherwise would only have access to informal sources of finance.33 The project will directly benefit \nat least 63,714 rural CSI borrowers, of which 50% are owned by women by 2024, by providing \nreliable and affordable institutional finance. \n \nC. \n \n31. \nBDB has a sustainability risk because of high NPLs. The BDB institutional strengthening \nplan  has  a  special  focus  on  resolving  and  controlling  NPLs.  The  credit  line  for  the  $15  million \nsubordinated debt from the government to BDB is qualified as tier 2 capital, thus contributing to \nthe  improvement  of  BDB\u2019s  capital  adequacy  ratio  and  financial  sustainability. 34  The  BDB \ninstitutional strengthening plan implementation especially in relation to NPL management will be \nclosely monitored by ADB through quarterly reports and periodical review missions. \n \nD. \n \n32. \nfinancial  management,  procurement,  and \nenvironmental and social safeguards were discussed and agreed with the government and BDB \nand  incorporated  in  the  project  design.  Procurement  of  goods,  works,  and  non-consultancy \nservices  will  follow  the  ADB  Procurement  Policy  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time), \nProcurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time), and relevant \nstaff instructions. Procurement will be undertaken by the individual beneficiary; fitness for purpose \ncan be achieved by using established private sector and commercial practices. \n \n33. \nThe  overall  financial  management  risk  for  the  project  is  assessed  high.  BDB  has  (i) \ninadequate  financial  management  practices  and  lacks  an  accounting  policy  and  financial \nmanagement guidelines, (ii) weak internal control systems, (iii) poor portfolio management and \nhigh  NPL  ratio,  and  (iv)  limited  institutional  expertise  to  undertake  rural  CSI  financing.  ADB\u2019s \nintegrity  due  diligence  found  that  BDB\u2019s  weak  management  information  systems  and  internal \ncontrols and the lack of an appropriate supervision and oversight accountability mechanism pose \nsignificant integrity risks.

Informal money lenders typically charge \n\nannual interest rates of more than 120%. \n\n34 Tier 2 capital is the second layer of capital that a bank must keep as part of its required reserves. This tier comprises \n\nrevaluation reserves, general provisions, subordinated term debt, and hybrid capital instruments. \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\fPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nof  terrorism  (AML/CFT)  system  also  pose  a  significant  integrity  risk. 35  ADB\u2019s  financial  due \ndiligence  identified  cases  of  misappropriation,  embezzlement,  unauthorized  sanctions  and \ndisbursements,  overwriting  of  field  receipts,  backdating  errors  in  field  receipts,  and  failure  of \nupdating account records of funds collected in fields. BDB has initiated measures to improve its \ninternal controls. The BDB institutional strengthening plan will enhance internal audit and fraud \ncontrol. Furthermore, BDB committed to undertaking measures to address the risks outlined in \nTable 6. The significant integrity risks are mitigated through the attached TA, which will support \nthe  development  of  BDB\u2019s  internal  control  and  compliance  framework,  including  AML/CFT.36 \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment  and  BDB.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM.  \n \nE. \n \n34. \nThe project will have positive economic empowerment impacts on rural small and marginal \nfarmers and women. The project\u2019s non-collateral-based group loans will be gender-inclusive and \nthe financial literacy training and business development support will focus on women. This will \nresult in increased financial access for at least 31,857 rural CSIs owned by women, including at \nleast 3,247 women group-loan borrowers by 2024. The project is classified gender equity as a \ntheme.37 \n \nF. \n \n35. \ncategories are as follows: 38 \n \n36. \nEnvironment  (category  FI),  involuntary  resettlement  (category  FI-C),  indigenous \npeoples (category FI-C). BDB will not finance subprojects with significant environmental impacts \n(category A), involuntary resettlement impacts (category A or B), or indigenous peoples impacts \n(category A or B).39 For subprojects with environmental impacts that are not significant (category \nB), BDB will prepare an initial environmental examination and environmental management plan, \nand submit the appropriate plan for ADB\u2019s approval before the subproject is financed. \n  \n37. \nBDB  has  an  environmental  and  social  safeguard  policy,  but  lacked  a system to screen \nprojects.40 BDB has adopted an environmental and social management system (ESMS), which \nwas agreed by ADB.
