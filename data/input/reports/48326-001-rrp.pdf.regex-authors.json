THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \ngrant  and  (ii)  a  proposed  grant  and  administration  of  such  grant  to  be  provided  by  the \nAfghanistan Infrastructure Trust Fund (AITF),1 to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for the \nNorthern Flood-Damaged Infrastructure Emergency Rehabilitation Project.2 \n \n2.  The project will assist the government in rehabilitating irrigation and road infrastructure \ndamaged  by  severe  flooding  in  northern  Afghanistan  during  April\u2013June  2014.  It  will  help \nrehabilitate selected (i) traditional irrigation and rural road infrastructure in the 15 worst-affected \nprovinces, based on the damage and needs assessment (DNA) undertaken by the Ministry of \nRural Rehabilitation and Development (MRRD); 3 and (ii) formal irrigation system infrastructure \nin three provinces, based on the DNA completed by the Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW).4  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Afghanistan is classified as the world\u2019s second most flood-prone country, after Bhutan, \non  the  basis  of  average  annual  number  of  flood-related  deaths  per  million  people.5 The \ntopography, climate, and land cover of the mountainous regions result in the mountain valleys \nbeing prone to flooding. Typically, heavy rain in the spring and early summer combined with \nsnow and glacier melt cause flash flooding and damage to villages, roads, and farming areas \nclose to the rivers. Flooding is exacerbated by the narrow valleys, which channel the floodwater \nthrough  villages,  destroying  homes  and  livelihoods.  Significant  losses  also  result  from \ninundation of crops and irrigation facilities, and the deposit of silt, rocks, and debris in canals \nand fields. \n \n4.  During April\u2013early June 2014, heavy rains over many parts of northern Afghanistan \nresulted in severe flash floods, causing widespread destruction and loss of life. By 22 May 2014, \n125,000 people residing in 123 districts in 27 provinces had been affected. While flooding is \ncommon in most years, the 2014 northern floods were exceptionally severe and are regarded \nlocally as a 1 in 100-year event.  \n   \n1.  Damage, Loss, and Needs Assessment \n5.  The Afghanistan National Disaster Management Authority is the lead agency responsible \nfor disaster management in the country. With provincial disaster management agencies, the \nauthority coordinated disaster relief efforts financed by central and line agency governments, \nnongovernment organizations, and multilateral funds. A comprehensive DNA, inclusive of key \ndevelopment  partners  and  government  agencies,  was  not  possible  due  to  poor  security \nconditions. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) estimated flood losses at over $800 million. ADB \n                                                \n1  Financing partners: the governments of Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  Provinces include Badakhshan, Baghlan, Balkh, Bamyan, Daikundi, Faryab, Ghor, Jowzjan, Kunar, Laghman, \nNuristan, Panjshir, Samangan, Sar-e-pul, and Takhar. \n4  Provinces include Balkh, Jowzjan, and Samangan. \n5  United Nations Development Programme, Bureau for Crisis Prevention and Recovery. 2004. Reducing Disaster \nRisk: A Challenge For Development. New York. \n ", "2   \nestimated  the  cost  of  damage  in  four  provinces,6 based  on  multi-agency  consultations,  at \naround $240 million, with 70% of losses from housing, crop and livestock losses, and deaths. \nSince many families have sustained damage to or loss of their homes and in many cases their \nlivestock, they require urgent humanitarian and economic assistance. During the ADB DNA and \nfact-finding mission, extensive losses to rural infrastructure significantly impacting the livelihood \nof thousands of people were observed.  \n \n6.  On 4 August 2014, the government requested an emergency assistance grant to assist \nwith repairing or reconstructing damaged village connectivity and irrigation infrastructure, and \nrepairing farm to market roads. \n \n7.  MRRD has estimated the cost to repair small-scale irrigation infrastructure at $19.6 \nmillion in 15 provinces (mainly to canals, intakes, and other structures; retaining walls; and land). \nIt has estimated the repair or reconstruction costs of village roads and bridges at $12.3 million, \nwith village roads particularly being severely affected.  \n \n8.  MEW has estimated the cost to repair larger-scale irrigation infrastructure in need of \nearly repair at $6.3 million in Balkh, Jowzjan, and Samangan provinces. This includes the \nreconstruction of the Hacha Qala weir servicing extensive irrigation areas in Jowzjan province, \nand many subprojects comprising canal bank protection and repair.  \n \n9.  The ADB fact-finding mission verified damage to a sample of assets. The  damage \nassessment estimates provided by MRRD and MEW, totaling $38.15 million, formed base cost \nestimates for infrastructure rehabilitation (Table 1). \n \n2.  Government and Development Partner Response \n10.  The national response to the northern flood disaster has been limited due to financial \nresource  constraints.  The  National  Emergency  Fund  receives  an  annual  contribution  of  \nAF900 million ($16 million) from the government, much of which has been applied to the \nnorthern  flood  humanitarian  relief  in  2014.  Local  government  agencies  have  helped \ncommunities\u2019  complete  temporary  repair  of  irrigation  facilities  through  the  provision  of \nexcavators and sandbags.  \n \n11.  The on-the-ground humanitarian response was generally prompt and effective through \nseveral  government  departments  and  provincial  agencies,  United  Nations  agencies,  and \nnumerous nongovernment organizations.7 The United Nations Office for the Coordination of \nHumanitarian  Affairs  is  coordinating  support  for  house  reconstruction.  The  World  Bank  is \nproviding  a grant  of  $20  million  under  its  ongoing  Irrigation  Restoration  and  Development \nProject  to  repair  previously  rehabilitated  infrastructure.  ADB  investments  to  repair  village \neconomic infrastructure and rural connectivity will complement the large humanitarian efforts of \nthe government and its development partners. \n \n12.  With its support for agriculture and natural resources, including irrigation infrastructure, \nthe project is to contribute to the achievement of government and Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) development outcomes, as outlined in the interim country partnership strategy, 2014\u2012\n2015 for Afghanistan. For national planning, the project is directly supportive of the agriculture \n                                                \n6  Balkh, Faryab, Jowzjan, and Sar-e-pul. \n7  See details in Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "3 \nand rural development, and infrastructure development clusters of the government\u2019s national \npriority programs. The project will contribute to ADB\u2019s commitment under the Midterm Review of \nStrategy 2020 to strengthen integrated disaster risk management to reduce vulnerability to \nnatural and environmental hazards. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The project impact will be improved community welfare in flood-affected project areas. \nThe project outcome will be restoration of irrigated agriculture and access to markets. \n \nC.  Outputs \n14.  The project outputs will be (i) selected flood-damaged infrastructure rehabilitated, and \n(ii) project management. The  project will help communities and MEW to repair damaged \nirrigation structures and land, including protecting land from further erosion with retaining walls \nwhere required, and returning assets to production as soon as possible. Investments in village \nroads  and  bridges  will  allow  rural  connectivity  to  be  restored.  The  infrastructure  to  be \nrehabilitated will be subject to selection criteria set out in the project administration manual \n(PAM).8 Key criteria include that (i) assets were damaged by the 2014 floods; and (ii) repairs \nare technically feasible, cost-effective, financially sustainable, and economically viable.  \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n15.  The project is estimated to cost $57.24 million (Table 1). \nTable 1:  Project Investment Plan ($ million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.

The government has requested a grant not exceeding $40 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources to help finance the project. The AITF will cofinance, through a $16.66 million \ngrant, the defined outputs of the project. ADB will administer the AITF funds. ADB and AITF \nfinancing will support civil works, consultancies, goods, security, recurrent costs, and taxes and \nduties (including business receipts tax).9 ADB has been financing project taxes and duties in \n                                                \n8  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n9  Taxes and duties include the business receipt tax, estimated at 2%; fixed tax on imports of 2%\u20137%; and custom \nduties of 2.5%\u201316%. They do not represent an excessive share of the financing plan and are within applicable \ncountry  partnership  strategy  parameters.  ADB. 2005.

For output 1, MRRD will implement rehabilitation \nof traditional irrigation and rural roads assets, and MEW the rehabilitation of government-owned \nirrigation schemes. MRRD will make extensive use of community participation for contracting \nand implementing subprojects. Since 2001, MRRD has successfully executed more than 50,000 \ncommunity participation contracts through the National Solidarity Program, with a total value of \naround $4 billion. The flagship national program for rural reconstruction is largely funded by a \nWorld  Bank-managed  multi-donor  trust  fund.  MRRD  will  use  the  four  existing  project \nimplementation  units  (PIUs)  under  the  Community-Based  Irrigation  Rehabilitation  and \nDevelopment Project,11 and will establish two additional PIUs in Bamyan and Takhar to support \nproject implementation. The project will add less than 10% to the typical annual community \nparticipation contract implementation workload for MRRD. For output 1, MEW will implement the \nrehabilitation of formal irrigation schemes, most of which it manages. It will utilize the project \nmanagement  office  (PMO)  and  project  implementation  office  (PIO)  established  under  the \ntranche  1  project  of  the  Water  Resources  Development  Investment  Program,12 with  the \nproposed project financing any incremental staff. MEW is currently implementing three ADB \nprojects. A national firm of consultant engineers will be contracted to provide construction \nsupervision, and will also report to ADB. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n10 ADB. 2012.

MRRD will contract communities to undertake rehabilitation works \nin  approximately  506  villages  or  groups  of  villages.  MRRD  will  manage  the  community \nparticipation contracting process in line with the management guidelines detailed in the PAM. \nPriority subprojects identified by MEW and MRRD are listed in the PAM (footnote 11).  \n \n20.  An emergency assistance grant normally has a 2-year implementation period. In the \nAfghan post-conflict situation where security issues and various constraints can cause delays, a \n3-year project implementation period is more appropriate.  \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n \n21.  At fact-finding, security limitations constrained the conduct of due diligence for damaged \nirrigation and rural roads assets. Extensive damage was noted in a wide geographic area; a \ncommon theme was that failed assets had been built to lower engineering standards. More \nrecent construction built to higher standards and intended to be resilient to more extreme \nweather events survived the floods intact.  \n \n22.  Damaged infrastructure will be repaired or replaced with a \u201cbuild-back-better\u201d philosophy \nto improve flood resilience through better infrastructure design, building materials, construction \nmethods,  and  supervision.  This  is  within  the  skills  set  of  the  implementing  agencies  and \nconstruction teams as assets built more recently have survived recent flood events. Community \ndevelopment councils (CDCs) will be used for all traditional irrigation and rural road construction \nwork, and therefore operation and maintenance will be within their capacity. MEW will manage \nlarger irrigation infrastructure using existing irrigation system management mechanisms.  \n \n23.  MRRD\u2019s ability to recruit sufficient engineers of adequate ability to design and supervise \nsubproject  implementation  will  be  key  to  the  success  of  output  1.  MRRD\u2019s  provincial \ndepartments already employ numerous engineers recruited from their own province or other \nprovince; discussions in Balkh and Samangan indicate a sufficient pool of engineers on which to \ndraw. All CDCs have experience in managing and constructing village infrastructure on their \nown  account  and  under  the  National  Solidarity  Program.  During  fact-finding,  all  CDCs \nexpressed confidence in the availability of sufficient skilled and unskilled laborers in their own \nand/or adjoining villages to complete subprojects to a high standard. MEW is competent and \nexperienced, and the work envisaged is within their technical capacity. Subproject selection \ncriteria defined in the PAM requires an assessment of technical feasibility for all subprojects. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n24.  In accordance with ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy (2004), economic \nanalysis  for  the  subprojects  will  be  conducted  by  MRRD  and  MEW  before  subproject \nimplementation. The analysis will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the \nEconomic Analysis of Projects,14 and will ensure that subproject classes have an economic \ninternal rate of return of at least 12% prior to implementation. \n                                                \n13 ADB. 2004.

The project will reduce incremental recurrent costs through the replacement of damaged \nassets with improved quality structures using the build-back-better approach. The majority of \nassets will be rebuilt using community participation contracts, and will be owned and maintained \nby the communities in the future. The communities will provide at least 7% in kind contribution \non average for all contracts procured with community participation. \n   \nC.  Governance \n \n26.  Anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto and discussed with the government. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. ADB reserves the right to investigate, audit, and examine \nthe records and accounts of MRRD and MEW directly or through its agents, for any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the project. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) are \nincluded in the grant agreements and the bidding documents under the project. \n \n27.  Financial management. MRRD and MEW are currently implementing ADB projects and \nhave  financial  management  skills  that  satisfy  ADB  requirements.  The  current  financial \nmanagement  system  of  the  ministries  is  capable  of  (i)  recording  the  required  financial \ntransactions and balances, (ii) providing regular and reliable financial statements and monitoring \nreports during project implementation, (iii) safeguarding financial assets, and (iv) preparing \nrequired financial documents to audit acceptable to ADB. The MRRD PIUs and MEW PIO are \nstaffed with experienced personnel familiar with ADB\u2019s Handbook for Borrowers on the Financial \nManagement  and  Analysis  of  Projects  (2005).  MOF  has  adequate  financial  management \ncapacity  to  satisfy  ADB  requirements  for  an  executing  agency,  records  required  financial \ntransactions and balances, provides regular and reliable financial statements and monitoring \nreports,  safeguards  financial  assets,  and  submits  the  required  financial  documents  in  an \nauditable form and format.  \n \n28.  Project  performance  management  system.  A  project  performance  management \nsystem will be established within 3 months of grant effectiveness.15 MEW will adapt the MRRD-\nmanaged system for its use. The database will be updated and monitored monthly. MRRD will \nprovide quarterly reports to ADB. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n29.  In most cases, full irrigation would not be feasible for several years in the absence of the \nproject,  causing  widespread  hardship  and  hunger.  The  post-flood  emergency  repairs \nundertaken by the villages are not durable and will likely be lost again in the next flood, probably \nduring 2015. Consequently, in the absence of the project, agricultural production will be severely \nlimited. In these circumstances, and where substantial areas of land can be brought back into \nproduction in 1\u20132 years, financial returns are likely to be high. \n \n30.  The damage and loss assessment estimates that the irrigation outputs will benefit more \nthan 112,000 flood-affected households and the village road outputs will benefit 87,000 flood-\naffected households (with some overlap between the two categories). This equates to almost 1 \nmillion  affected  people  in  15  of  the  most  severely  flood-affected  provinces.  The  main \n                                                \n15 The short time frame is considered feasible, since the project performance management system will be similar to \nthat used for the Community-Based Irrigation Rehabilitation and Development project (footnote 14). \n ", "8   \nbeneficiaries will be farming families previously benefiting from irrigation systems, and village \npeople who will be able to have continued access to markets and regional centers. \n \n31.  The implementation modality for the traditional irrigation and rural roads activities is \nsimilar to the National Solidarity Program, enabling farmers and local laborers to undertake the \nconstruction under the guidance of MRRD engineers. Local communities will therefore benefit \nfrom both infrastructure and construction income, which can be immediately applied to cope \nwith  damaged  housing  and  economic  assets.  The  project  utilizes  an  inclusive  design  for \ncommunity engagement to encourage peace building in a post-conflict environment. \n \n32.  The role of women in the project area is dictated by tradition, with women largely \nengaged in unpaid work within the house compound. Women have expressed concerns about \nlack of food, income, work opportunities, health facilities, and potable water. Gender roles in the \nproject area are unlikely to change. Apart from improving irrigation water supplies, which has an \nimpact on household food security, the project will have a limited gender impact. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n33.  Land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  project  is  categorized  C  for  involuntary \nresettlement.  As  it  proposes  to  reconstruct  and  rehabilitate  existing  flood-damaged \ninfrastructure, the project team is confident that land acquisition and physical and economic \ndisplacement and/or any other negative impacts are not required under the project and its \noutputs. The project will not support any subprojects that require land acquisition or involuntary \nresettlement.   \n \n34.  Indigenous peoples. The project is categorized C in relation to indigenous peoples. \nAfghanistan  is  inhabited  by  ethnic  groups  across  its  34  provinces.  None  are  considered \nindigenous peoples as defined  by the ADB Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) for  project \noperation purposes. Afghan minority ethnic groups (mainly comprising Kuchi and Hazara) are \nnot found in the subproject areas, hence will not be impacted by subprojects in any manner. \n \n35.  Environment. The  project  is  categorized  B for  environment.  A  rapid  environmental \nassessment checklist will be used at the time of subproject identification to determine the level \nof  study  required.  Subprojects  with  potential  significant  environmental  impacts  and  risks \n(category  A)  will  be  excluded  from  financing.  An  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework for the project was prepared and disclosed on the ADB website on 12 August 2014. \nThe  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  (i)  specifies  the  requirements  for \nsubproject selection, screening and categorization, assessment, consultation and participation, \nand environmental planning; (ii) assesses MRRD and MEW capacity for implementing national \nenvironmental laws and ADB requirements; (iii) describes monitoring and reporting procedures; \nand  (iv)  specifies  implementation  procedures  and  responsibilities.  Adverse  environmental \nimpacts such as noise, air and water pollution, and soil erosion could occur during construction. \nHowever,  these  are  site-specific  and  temporary  in  nature,  and  will  be  mitigated  through \nimplementation  of  environmental  management  plans.  An  initial  environmental  examination, \nincluding environmental management plans, will be prepared for any category B subproject. The \ninitial  environmental  examinations  and  relevant  environmental  monitoring  reports  will  be \ndisclosed on the ADB website.  \n \n \n \n \n ", "9 \nF.  Security \n \n36.  Poor security in the project provinces can delay project activities. Before implementation \ncommences, discussions will be held with local security agencies, particularly the police and the \nAfghanistan National Army. These consultations will continue on a regular basis. Relatively few \nsecurity problems are envisaged due to the positive contribution of the project to economic \ndevelopment in the project areas. Communication links will be established with every CDC, \nwhich will provide early warning of any security issue. Adequate security to allow subproject \nimplementation is a selection criterion. Where security prevents adequate design or supervision \nduring project implementation, subprojects may need to be put on hold or cancelled. A national \nproject security officer will be appointed to advise all PIUs on security matters. A budget of \n$749,000 has been provided to meet security needs.  \n \nG.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n37.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4, and described together \nwith  the  procurement  risk  assessment  and  risk  mitigation  action  plan  in  the  overall  risk \nassessment and risk management plan.16 The integrated benefits and impacts are expected to \noutweigh the costs. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisk Description  Mitigation Measures or Risk Management Plan \nSecurity problems delay  Security is a significant issue in much of rural Afghanistan. The project design \nimplementation  mitigates security risks through the use of community participation in \nimplementation and the use of nationals for field supervision functions. A \nbudget is provided to meet security needs. The project will withdraw from \nareas on the advice of its security adviser. \nFurther flooding sufficient to damage The project is adopting a build-back-better approach, which will ensure that \nrepaired structures   assets are less likely to be damaged by future floods. \nSlow construction delays completion Measures include (i) recruiting many engineers to design and supervise \nunder the Ministry of Rural  subprojects, (ii) using community participation processes to construct \nRehabilitation and Development   subprojects, and (iii) moving engineers between provinces to support \nprograms that are experiencing time delays. \nFinancial malfeasance or corruption  Among other things, collusion of contractors is possible, this will be closely \nmonitored through the use of third party monitoring and supervision \nconsultants and frequent review missions. \nDifficulty in attracting quality  All packages of the Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW) except one are over \nconsulting and construction firms to  $100,000 and should attract qualified contractors.  \nbid  \nDelayed award of contracts  Close supervision of procurement activities by ADB through Afghanistan \nResident Mission staff and resident mission consultants.
