THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nof up to $350 million without government guarantee for the Tangguh Liquefied Natural Gas \nProject in the Republic of Indonesia.  \n \nII.  INTRODUCTION \n \n2.  Indonesia  started  exporting  LNG  in  1977  and  is  currently  the  world\u2019s  largest  LNG \nexporter with a market share of nearly 20%. LNG export is a significant earner of foreign \nexchange for the country. In 2004, it comprised $7.8 billion, or 10.8% of the nation\u2019s total \nexports. Indonesia has supplied natural gas for conversion to LNG from two primary centers: \nArun in Aceh province and Bontang in East Kalimantan province. Arun\u2019s natural gas reserves \nare widely recognized to be depleting, and Arun is likely to cease to be an important source of \nnatural gas by 2012 or soon thereafter. Bontang production recently experienced a shortfall due \nto operational constraints.  \n \n3.  The Project is expected to be the Indonesia\u2019s third primary LNG center and the largest \nprivate sector financing in Indonesia. Following the discovery of a total of seven gas fields in \nBintuni Bay in Irian, the Project is being developed to implement the upstream development of \nthe  gas  fields  and  the  subsequent  processing  of  this  feed  gas  into  LNG  for  export.  In \nanticipation of the development of this valuable resource located in one of Indonesia\u2019s most \nrugged and backward regions, in 1997 the Project was named \u201cTangguh,\u201d which in Bahasa \nmeans \u201cstrong and resilient.\u201d \n \nIII.  BACKGROUND \n \nA.  The Liquified Natural Gas Subsector  \n \n1.  Overview \n \n4.  Indonesia has 2.56 trillion cubic meters (m3) of \u201cproven\u201d natural gas reserves, the 13th \nlargest in the world and the largest in Asia and the Pacific. The proven gas reserves are \nequivalent to three times Indonesia\u2019s oil reserves and can supply the country for 35 years at \ncurrent production rates. If the \u201cpossible\u201d gas reserves are included, future supply could be \nlonger than 50 years. However, not all of these reserves are commercially viable and not all of \ntheir gas is exportable, due to gas quality and distance to market.  \n \n5.  Indonesia\u2019s natural gas production reached 73,300 million m3 in 2004, 8th largest in the \nworld and largest in Asia and the Pacific. The country\u2019s gas exports have grown 60-fold from 661 \nmillion m3 in 1977, when LNG exports started, to 39,600 million m3 in 2004. Indonesia\u2019s natural \ngas exports have traditionally been in the form of LNG. Indonesia presently is the largest LNG \nproducer in the world with nearly a 20% market share. In 2004, Indonesia\u2019s LNG was exported to \nJapan (63.3%), Republic of Korea (21.8%), and Taipei,China (14.9%).  \n \n6.  LNG exports are the country\u2019s main energy export, and thus a principle source of revenue. \nLNG exports averaged 9.5% of the country\u2019s total exports during 1998\u20132004. During the same \n ", "2   \n \n \nperiod, the contribution of LNG to the country\u2019s gross domestic product averaged 3.5%. However, \nIndonesia\u2019s  two  primary  LNG  centers,  Arun  in  Aceh  and  Bontang  in  East  Kalimantan  are \nreportedly facing various production constraints. Arun\u2019s gas production is now in steady decline \nafter peaking in 1995; 90% of Arun\u2019s gas resources are now considered depleted, and committed \nreserves will run out entirely in 2018. Bontang began experiencing LNG shortfalls in 2004 due to \nunderproduction as a result of poor maintenance, accidents, and low field performance. The \nproduction constraints faced by Arun and Bontang underline the importance of developing the \nProject, the third LNG center, in order to maintain the country\u2019s leadership in the world LNG \nmarket and to secure stable revenues from LNG exports in the future. The LNG subsector in \nIndonesia is described in Appendix 2. \n \n2.  Sector Regulations \n \n7.  As part of a wider program for deregulation, the Government announced reforms in the \noil and gas subsector in a letter of intent signed in January 2000. Subsequently, in 2001 then \nPresident Megawati Sukarnoputri signed a new oil and gas law providing a new framework for \nthe oil and gas industry: Law of the Republic of Indonesia (Number 22 of 2001) Concerning \nNatural Oil and Gas (the new oil and gas law). It recognizes the importance of a certain and \ntransparent legal environment in which to conduct business activities, and contemplates the \nestablishment  of  upstream  and  downstream  environments  with  an  appropriate  regulatory \nframework for each. LNG plants may be flexibly considered as either upstream or downstream \nactivities depending on their commercial objectives. Historically, all of Indonesia\u2019s LNG projects \nhave been integrated with gas production arrangements, and are thus considered an upstream \nactivity. The new oil and gas law also provides for the creation of the Indonesian Oil and Gas \nUpstream Regulatory Body (BPMIGAS), a nonprofit state-owned legal entity, to be responsible \nfor upstream activities taking over rights and obligations of PERTAMINA, the former National Oil \nand Gas Company of Indonesia. Accordingly, PERTAMINA's supervisory role in the upstream \nand its downstream monopoly have ceased.  \n \nB.  Asian Development Bank Operations \n \n1.  Country Strategy \n \n8.  The new country strategy currently under preparation for Indonesia states that ADB will \nbe guided by the Government\u2019s five priority areas to achieve sustainable economic growth, \nwhich is needed to absorb the large number of entrants to the labor market annually and to \nreduce poverty. The five areas are (i) job creation and poverty reduction; (ii) macroeconomic \nstability; (iii) increase of investments, exports, and tourism; (iv) human resource improvements; \nand (v) infrastructure development by improving the efficiency of services and increasing private \nsector participation.  \n \n9.  To support the Government\u2019s goal and drawing on lessons learned, ADB will focus on (i) \ndevelopment  of  infrastructure,  (ii)  promotion  of  decentralization,  (iii)  reduction  of  regional \ndisparities, (iv) enhancement of natural resource management, and (v) reform of the financial \nsector. \n \n10.  ADB  has  played  a  significant  role  in  the  development  of  the  gas  transmission \ninfrastructure, and in developing the regulatory capacity for the oil and gas sector in Indonesia. \nADB\u2019s Loan 1357-INO: Gas Transmission Project in Sumatra supported the construction of the \ntrans-Sumatra gas pipeline that not only enhanced domestic utilization of natural gas but also \nestablished an important segment of the trans-ASEAN gas grid promoting regional energy \n ", "  3\ncooperation.1 An important policy covenant under the ADB loan required the conversion of \nPerusahaan Gas Negara (PGN) from a state corporation to a limited liability company which \nwas  completed  in  1996.  ADB  conducted  extensive  and  high-level  policy  dialogue  on  the \nparticipation  of  the  private  sector.  As  a  result,  a  subsidiary  with  a  40%  private  sector \nparticipation was formed to own, and operate the transmission system comprising the Grissik-\nDuri line completed in 1998 and the Grissik-Sakernan-Batam-Singapore pipelines completed in \n2004  and  the  Batam  distribution  network  completed  in  2005.  ADB  has  provided  several \ntechnical  assistances  (TAs)  to  support  the  establishment  of  the  regulatory  framework  and \nrestructuring  of  the  gas  sector,  development  of  the  gas  sector  master  plan,  and  for  gas \ndistribution and utilization.2 An ongoing TA supports the development of the least cost option for \ngas supply to meet the growing energy demand in Java.3\n \n2.  Energy Sector Strategy \n \n11.  ADB\u2019s energy sector strategy supports, as operational priorities, (i) poverty reduction, \nincluding by creating energy infrastructure for sustainable economic growth; (ii) promotion of \nprivate  sector  involvement  by  restructuring  the  energy  sector,  and  creating  an  enabling \nenvironment for the private sector; (iii) addressing regional and global environment impacts by \nsupporting measures to address acid rain problems and use of clean energy; and (iv) promotion \nof regional cooperation.  \n \n12.  The Project supports and contributes to the promotion of ADB\u2019s operational priorities, \nparticularly  by  (i)  generating  substantial  financial  benefits  for  both  the  central  and  local \ngovernments to enable sustainable economic growth, which can reduce poverty, as well as \ndirectly assisting various poverty reduction initiatives in Irian; (ii) supporting government policy \nof restructuring the oil and gas subsector with the largest private sector investment since the \nfinancial crisis in 1997; (iii) supplying clean energy to countries in the region, e.g., the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC), where serious environmental degradation including acid rain have \nresulted from the overuse of coal as a primary fuel; and (iv) promoting regional cooperation \nthrough increased energy trade in the region. \n \n3.  ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations \n \n13.  To  support  the  Government\u2019s  goal  of  reducing  poverty  by  achieving  sustainable \neconomic growth, ADB proposes to revitalize its private sector operations in Indonesia to serve \nas a catalyst for the return of private sector investments in infrastructure, especially in the \nenergy and transport sectors. During its January 2005 Infrastructure Summit, the Government \nidentified 91 projects totaling $22.7 billion for possible private sector participation to enhance \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 1995.

THE PROJECT \nA.  Background \n \n14.  As part of Indonesia\u2019s economic policies of maintaining the security of LNG supply and \nencouraging the development of projects earning foreign exchange, the Project is designated as \na national project and its realization is recognized by the Government as a national priority. \n \nB.  Investors \n \n15.  Interests in the Project are held by subsidiaries of major oil and gas companies: BP; \nChina National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC); Mitsubishi Corporation; INPEX Corporation; \nNippon Oil Exploration, Ltd.; Japan Oil, Gas, and Metals National Corporation (JOGMEC); \nKanematsu Corporation; Overseas Petroleum Corporation; and LNG Japan Corporation. The \ninvestors\u2019 corporate profiles are in Appendix 3. \n \nC.  Project Description \n \n16.  The Project is a major greenfield development to extract natural gas from gas fields in \nthe Berau and Bintuni bay area of Irian, and to liquefy it into LNG for shipping to export markets.  \n \nD.  Environmental Aspects and Social Dimensions \n \n1.  Environment, Safety, and Health \n \n17.  The Project will meet high standards in responsible resource development through the \nenvironmental and social impact assessment (AMDAL) process, which was carried out during \n2000\u20132002 using Indonesian regulations and standards. Many aspects of relevant international \nstandards were also considered. The assessments produced three documents required under \nthe regulation: (i) Environmental and Social Impact Analysis (ANDAL), (ii) Environmental and \nSocial Impact Management Plan (RKL), and (iii) Environmental and Social Impact Monitoring \nPlan (RPL). As the Project includes components subject to different government jurisdictions, \nthe  Central  AMDAL  Evaluation  Commission  of  the  Ministry  of  Environment  undertook  the \nAMDAL  using  an  integrated  approach.  The  environment  minister  confirmed  environmental \napproval of the Project on 25 October 2002. \n \n18.  ADB  has  classified  the  Project  as  environmental  category  A.  The  summary \nenvironmental impact assessment was prepared and posted on the ADB website on 8 July \n2005. The assessment used the ANDAL, RKL, and RPL as source documents and includes \ninformation not required under the Indonesian system. Details of the final project design and the \nresults of additional studies undertaken since the original AMDAL documents were prepared \nand are reflected in the summary environmental impact assessment. \n \n19.  Key environmental issues include the need to protect air and water quality, and effects \non terrestrial, freshwater aquatic, intertidal, and marine ecosystems. Extensive and intensive \nenvironmental inputs were included in project planning. The Project, as designed, minimizes the \nrisk of adverse environmental impacts. A wide range of environmental protection measures and \n ", "  5\nsafeguards  have  been  incorporated  to  protect  against  adverse  impacts  to  the  physical, \nbiological, and social components of the environment. With the implementation of the RKL  and \nRPL, the Project will comply fully with all Indonesian and ADB environmental requirements. The \nRPL presents emission/discharge standards based on the strictest of Indonesian, World Bank, \nand World Health Organization guidelines. Covenants related to the RKL and RPL will be set \nout in the financing documents. \n \n20.  Health and safety aspects feature prominently as a major BP corporate policy. Health \nand safety management measures are included in the construction contracts for implementation \nby the contractors. During the operation of project facilities, health and safety management will \nrigorously adopt standard measures and practices well-established in the gas industry. The \nenvironmental monitoring program includes health and safety aspects to ensure the compliance \nrequired as part of the environmental management plan. \n \n2.  Resettlement  \n \n21.  Land acquisition and physical relocation of 127 households from within the LNG plant \nsite was completed by mid-2004. Resettlement was undertaken in accordance with a Tangguh \nProject Land Acquisition and Resettlement Plan (LARAP) which forms part of the Government \napproved AMDAL for the Project. The AMDAL LARAP was prepared in accordance with the \nGovernment  legislation  and  World  Bank  standards.  Amongst  other  issues,  national  and \ninternational NGOs expressed some concerns about resettlement and compensation aspects of \nthe  Project  during  the  AMDAL  process.  A  \u2018due  diligence\u2019  of  those  resettlement  activities \ncompleted  prior  to  ADB\u2019s  involvement  was  undertaken.  Some  gaps  were  identified. 4  \nSubsequently, with guidance from ADB, the Project has prepared a second LARAP referred to \nas the \u201cImplementation LARAP\u201d. This addresses gaps identified during the \u2018due diligence\u2019 and \nprovides additional detail on livelihood restoration for affected people. The \u2018Implementation \nLARAP\u2019 is in accordance with ADB policy and operation requirements. \n \n22.  For the LNG terminal, a 3,266 ha site was acquired through negotiated agreements with \nseveral clans of the Simuri tribe, which held customary (adat) rights to the land, and with the \nTanah Merah community who occupied it. A further 200 ha of land, also belonging to the Simuri, \nwas acquired for a replacement village and garden plots for the Tanah Merah resettlers. 127 \nhouseholds (694 people) from the village of Tanah Merah were relocated from within the site. \nThe  standard  of  replacement  housing,  community  facilities  and  supporting  infrastructure \nprovided to resettlers is high. ADB\u2019s due diligence study found that resettlers are very satisfied \nwith  their  replacement  living  conditions.  Well  resourced  livelihood  restoration  programs  for \naffected people are underway and will be supported by the Project until 2009. The due diligence \nassessed the resettlement program as well planned and executed, and in conformance with \nADB requirements. An appraisal mission was conducted in early November 2005 to review \namongst  other  matters  (i)  progress  with  resettlement  implementation;  (ii)  the  adequacy  of \naffected  people\u2019s  access  to  replacement  forest  and  coastal  resources;  and,  (iii)  relations \nbetween clans following resources reallocation. Progress was assessed by the Mission as \nsatisfactory. \n \n                                                 \n4  Gaps with respect to ADB\u2019s involuntary resettlement policy included: (i) lack of an explicit basis for compensation \nfor loss of use of coastal resources and fishing grounds resulting from Project safety exclusion zones; and, (ii) an \ninconsistent approach to compensating for certain plantations within the LNG site.  The Project has included \ncommitments to address these gaps in the \u2018Implementation LARAP\u2019. ", "6   \n \n \n23.  Total  affected  population  is  249  households  (1,165  people).  This  consists  of  the \nrelocated village (127 households), and two host communities, Onar (28 households), and \nSaengga (94 households). The host villages will benefit through renovation of housing and \ninfrastructure by the project. The host communities will experience some intensification of use of \ntheir coastal resources as a result of the need to share with resettler households. All villagers \nwill experience some loss of access to fishing area as a result of restrictions around the LNG \nplant, subsea pipelines and offshore platforms. An endowment trust and livelihood programs \nhave been set-up to offset livelihood coastal resources and fishing grounds affected by Project \nmarine safety exclusion zones. \n \n3.  Indigenous Peoples Development Plan \n \n24.  The Project has prepared and is implementing an indigenous peoples development plan \nprepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Indigenous Peoples Policy. Two related indigenous peoples \nsafeguards documents were prepared for the Project. The first document is the Integrated \nSocial Program (ISP), which is the equivalent of an Indigenous Peoples Development Plan, to \naddress anticipated indigenous peoples' issues and other social development issues during \nproject construction period and transition to the project operations period (2006-2010). The ISP \nsets out principles for (i) informing and promoting participation of local indigenous peoples in \nproject preparation and implementation; (ii) delivering benefits to local indigenous people; and, \n(iii) safeguarding them from adverse Project impacts. Principal Project impacts and risks for \nindigenous  people  have  been  identified.  The  plan  was  prepared  within  the  context  of  the \nPapuan  Special  Autonomy  Law  (1999)  which  obligates  the  Government  of  Papua  to \nacknowledge, protect, empower, and develop the rights of indigenous communities.  Enabling \nlegislation has now been passed for formation of a Papua People\u2019s Assembly (Majelis Rakyat \nPapua) which includes indigenous representation. The second document is the Indigenous \nPeoples Development Framework (IPDF), which is to address unanticipated indigenous peoples \nissues and other possible social development issues over the lifetime of the Project. IPDF is \nrequired in recognition that (i) the project lifespan and project loan maturity extends beyond the \ncurrent ISP planning period, and (ii) the long-term socio-economic environment, in which the \nproject is being developed, is relatively unpredictable. \n \n25.  The ISP has the following components: (i) a diversified growth strategy (DGS) developed \nin partnership with UNDP and the Government to reduce impacts of population influx, to support \ndevelopment of a regional development plan and to increase the capacity of local government; \n(ii) a community mobilization and development program developing small social and physical \ninfrastructure projects in nine villages in the immediate vicinity of the Project; (iii) a basic health \nprogram focusing on maternal and child health, malaria control, TB detection and treatment and \nHIV/AIDs  prevention;  (iv)  establishment  of  a  community-based  security  network;  (v) \nmicrofinance  and  SME  development  program  (in  collaboration  with  USAID);  and,  (vi) \nstrengthening of adat institutions and local civil society. Mechanisms and forums to facilitate \ninformation dissemination, consultation, grievance and dispute resolution have been defined. \nISP expenditure to date is $18.7 million. A further $58.3 million is budgeted for 2006-2010. \nAccording to IPDF, beyond 2010 the Project, together with the Government, will provide on-\ngoing support to social-economic development initiatives based on an assessment of needs and \nrisks. \n \n4.  Development Impacts \n \n26.  The Project will build a facility to serve as the third LNG primary center in Indonesia. Its \nLNG exports will earn revenue in foreign currency, which will be shared by the private sector \n ", "  7\ninvestors and the Government based on the PSCs. In accordance with the Indonesian Autonomy \nLaw, these revenues will be shared between the central and provincial governments. The Project \nsupports  the  Government\u2019s  goal  to  achieve  sustainable  economic  growth  to  reduce  poverty \nthrough macroeconomic stability and infrastructure development with private sector participation.  \n \n27.  The Project will increase the supply of clean energy to importing countries such as the \nPRC, which is endeavoring to reduce air pollution caused by the overuse of coal and to diversify \nenergy sources while achieving sustainable economic growth. The Project contributes to regional \ncooperation by energy trading.  \n \n5.  Development Effectiveness \n \n28.  Based on the standards being contemplated by ADB for implementation of the Good \nPractice  Standards  for  Evaluation  of  Private  Sector  Investment  Operations,  the  Project  is \nassessed  and  described  within  the  design  and  monitoring,  and  development  effectiveness \nframeworks  (Appendix  1).  The  Project  is  deemed  to  be  developmentally  effective,  and  its \nperformance measurable. A brief summary discussion follows on each of the three parameters.  \n \na.  Project Performance \n \n29.  The  Project  will  be  assessed  against  its  specific  investment  capital,  construction, \noperational, and financial objectives. Essentially, effectiveness will be measured against how \nsuccessfully the Project attracts private sector capital (both debt and equity); how the Project \nsecures fixed construction costs and contracting arrangements for on-time construction, within \nbudget and within specifications; and how the Project secures suitable operational arrangements \nto enable optimal production of LNG for export. The Project will be also measured by financial \nprofitability and sustainability through timely debt repayment capacity and investor returns. \n   \n  b.   Economic Sustainability \n \n30.  The Project will be assessed, from an economic sustainability point of view, on its ability to \nprovide Indonesia with new LNG production and export capacity, supply LNG at competitive \nprices, and contribute to economic growth by generating additional revenue to the central and \nlocal governments. Additional employment created as a result of project implementation will be \ntaken into account. The Project\u2019s successful implementation will promote the Government\u2019s sector \nreform. \n   \n  c.   Private Sector Development \n \n31.  The  Project  will  be  assessed  and  measured  on  how  it  contributes  to  private  sector \ndevelopment. The focus of this assessment is on the Project\u2019s commercial and financial viability, \nand its demonstrative and catalytic effect on future private sector investments in the energy \nsector, and the broader economy as a whole. \n \nV.  THE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Loan \n \n1.  Nature and Amount \n \n32.  ADB assistance for the Project will comprise a loan of up to $350 million  ", "8   \n \n \n \nB.  Justification for ADB Assistance \n \n33.  The Project merits ADB support for the following reasons: \n \n(i)  By generating financial benefits to both central and local governments in the long \nterm, the Project, the first phase of the nation\u2019s third LNG center, will contribute \nsignificantly to the Government\u2019s goal of achieving sustainable economic growth \nand thus reduce poverty, as supported in the ADB country strategy.  \n \n(ii)  The  Project  will  supply  natural  gas  at  competitive  prices  and  promote  as  a \npriority, as the ADB energy strategy designates, environmental improvements in \nother countries such as the PRC, which are endeavoring to lessen environmental \ndegradation and broaden their energy mix. The Project will contribute to regional \ncooperation  by  energy  trade,  another  priority  designated  in  the  ADB  energy \nstrategy. \n \n(iii)  Success of the Project will demonstrate resumption of private sector confidence \nin Indonesia and in the Government\u2019s reform initiatives to promote deregulation \nand improve transparency in the critical energy sector. \n   \n(iv)  The Project is the first phase of a large LNG project, which will contribute, in the \nlong  term,  by  increasing  energy  supply  to  alleviate  energy  price  hikes  and \nfluctuations, the main challenge that developing member countries are facing for \nsustainable economic development. \n \n(v)  By participating in the Project, ADB will indicate its strong commitment to help \ndevelop the energy infrastructure sector in Indonesia, which requires a large \namount of private sector investment. \n \n(vi)  ADB\u2019s participation in the Project is critical to reassuring project participants (the \nGovernment,  private  investors,  LNG  purchasers,  and  financiers)  that  this \nIndonesian national project is structured, financed, implemented, and operated in \nline with international standards and best practices with critical environment and \nsocial requirements being fully satisfied. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n \n34.  A framework agreement relating to ADB\u2019s status, privileges, and immunities with respect \nto its equity investments and lending operations in the private sector is in effect between the \nGovernment and ADB. Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development \nBank (the Articles of Agreement), the Government will be requested to confirm that it has no \nobjection to the proposed assistance to the Project. No funding will be disbursed until ADB \nreceives  such  confirmation.  In  addition,  ADB  will  enter  into  suitable  loan  and  guarantee \ndocumentation on terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB which will include, without limitation, \nprovisions addressing anti-corruption, anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism matters.  \n \n \n \n ", "  9\nVII.    RECOMMENDATION \n \n35.

Gas Reserves \n \n1.  Indonesia has 2.56 trillion cubic meters (m3) of proven natural gas reserves, the 13th \nlargest in the world and the largest in the Asia and Pacific region. Gas reserves are equivalent \nto three times Indonesia\u2019s oil reserves and can supply the country for 35 years at current \nproduction rates. If the possible reserves are included, supply would be longer than 50 years. \nAccording to the Government, over 71% of natural gas reserves are located offshore, with the \nlargest reserves found on Natuna Island (34.4%), East Kalimantan (30.2%), Irian Jaya (15.1%), \nAceh (6.8%), and South Sumatra (6.4%). However, not all of these reserves are commercially \nviable nor is the gas exportable, due to both the quality of the gas as well as its distance to \nmarket.  \n \nB.  Liquefied Natural Gas Production and Export \n \n2.  Indonesia\u2019s natural gas production has steadily increased, rising to 73,300 million m3 in \n2004, the world\u2019s 8th largest and Asia and Pacific\u2019s largest, followed by Malaysia, the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC), and Australia. Indonesia\u2019s gas exports have grown from 661 million \nm3 in 1977, when the export of liquefied natural gas (LNG) started, to 20,342 million m3 in 1986, \na 31-fold increase, and to 39,600 million m3 in 2004, a 60-fold increase. Natural gas exports \nfrom Indonesia have traditionally been in the form of LNG. Export by pipeline commenced to \nSingapore upon completion of a subsea pipeline in 2001. Indonesia presently remains the \nlargest LNG producer in the world, with almost a 20% market share. In 2004, Indonesia\u2019s LNG \nwas exported to Japan (63.3%); Republic of Korea (21.8%); and Taipei,China (14.9%). While \nnatural gas export by pipelines is expected to increase, LNG exports will remain the majority \ndue to the geographic distance between Indonesia and large gas demand centers in the region. \nFigure A2.1 presents Indonesia\u2019s natural gas production and export during 1986-2004. \n \nFigure A2.1: Natural Gas Production and Export\n80,000\n70,000\n60,000\nm3) 50,000\nn \no\nmilli\nn ( 40,000\no\nucti\nod 30,000\nPr\n20,000\n10,000\n0\n1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004\nYear\nLNG Export Natural Gas Export Marketed Production\nSource: Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.

In  2004,  LNG  exports  generated  revenues  of  $7.8  billion \nrepresenting 10.8% of the nation\u2019s exports and 3.1% of its gross domestic product. LNG exports \nrepresented an average of 9.5% of the country\u2019s total exports in 1998\u20132004.

To maintain reserves and production for oil and gas, Indonesia will require $49 billion of \ninvestment capital through 2020, of which more than $46 billion will be needed for oil and gas \nexploration, processing, and petrochemical installations. However, annual investment reported \nin  2001\u20132003  was  only  $1.2  billion  on  average.  Historically,  substantial  financing  for \ndevelopment of the energy sector has come from government, export credit agencies, and the \nprivate  sector  (mostly  foreign).  Among  export  credit  agencies,  Japan  Export  Import  Bank \n(presently, Japan Bank for International Cooperation) has played a leading role. \n \nC.  LNG Demand \n \n5.  The fastest growing component of world energy consumption is expected to be natural \ngas according to the International Energy Agency. Currently, natural gas accounts for 23% of \ntotal energy consumption, but this is projected to increase to 28% by 2020. The growth of \nnatural gas consumption in developing countries is expected to be significantly greater than in \nthe rest of the world, averaging 5.3% per year, as compared with 2.4% per year for developed \ncountries. Gas  importing  countries  and  regions  include Japan;  France;  Republic of  Korea; \nSpain; Taipei,China; and the United States.  \n \n6.  The largest increments in natural gas use are expected to be in developing Asia and \nNorth America. Natural gas consumption in Australia, Japan and New Zealand is projected to ", "      Appendix 2     15 \nincrease by 1.9% per year from 1999 to 2020; however, in the rest of Asia, gas consumption is \nexpected  to  increase  6.1%  per  year  over  the  same  time  period.  Among  the  developing \neconomies, the PRC will be one of the most prominent LNG purchasers in Asia in the future. \nWhile it is currently the world\u2019s second largest energy market, the PRC\u2019s energy consumption \nper  capita  remains  low.  To  maintain  rapid  economic  growth  and  lessen  environmental \ndegradation, the PRC government is strongly promoting the use of natural gas. By 2020, natural \ngas is predicted to increase to 12% of the PRC\u2019s total energy mix from only 2.5% in 2000. The \nprojected increase of natural gas consumption will create a demand-supply gap for the PRC in \nnatural gas of 24 billion m3/annum by 2010, which is predicted to grow to 100 billion m3/annum \nby 2020. The PRC government plans to meet the demand-supply gap by importing LNG through \nnewly constructed LNG terminals as well as by transporting natural gas from the western region \nby pipelines. \n \nD.  Emerging Challenges \n \n7.  Indonesia\u2019s LNG production commenced in late 1970s at two primary LNG centers: Arun \nin Aceh province and Bontang in East Kalimantan province. The two primary LNG centers are \nreportedly facing various production constraints. Arun\u2019s gas production is now on a steady \ndecline after peaking in 1995. Ninety percent of Arun\u2019s gas resources are now considered to be  \ndepleted, and its committed reserves will run out entirely in 2018. As Indonesia\u2019s largest LNG \ncenter,  Bontang  produces  about  20  million  tons/annum  of  LNG.  However,  Bontang  began \nexperiencing LNG shortfalls in 2004 due to underproduction resulting from poor maintenance, \naccidents, or low field performance. These production constraints faced by Arun and Bontang \nhave underlined the importance for Indonesia of developing the Project as the third LNG center \nin order to maintain its leadership in the world LNG market and secure stable revenue from LNG \nexports in the future. \n \n8.  In recent years, new LNG producers in Australia, Malaysia, Russia Federation, and \nQatar, are challenging Indonesia\u2019s leading position in the LNG market by increasing supply and \noffering more flexible and competitive sales contracts. Indonesia\u2019s LNG exports have been \nunder long-term contracts between PERTAMINA and its LNG purchasers. However, Indonesia\u2019s \nkey LNG markets in Japan and Republic of Korea are exploring new sources of LNG, offering \nlower prices and more flexible contracts. In addition, these buyers are starting to rely more on \nthe spot market for their LNG supply as part of their fuel management and procurement strategy. \nConsequently, Indonesia is exploring alternative marketing opportunities in the PRC and the \nUnited States. \n \nE.  Regulatory Frameworks \n \n9.  The new Indonesian Oil and Gas Law No. 35/2004 was promulgated on 14 October \n2004 replacing Oil and Gas Law 44/1960 and Law 8/1971 on PERTAMINA. It provides a new \nframework for the oil and gas industry. The law recognizes the importance of a certain and \ntransparent legal environment in which to conduct the business activity of Indonesia's oil and \ngas industry.1 It contemplates the establishment of upstream and downstream environments \nwith  an  appropriate  regulatory  framework  for  each.  It  aims  to  (i)  open  all  sectors  of  the \npetroleum  industry  to  competition,  (ii)  lower  costs  through  increased  transparency  and \nefficiency, (iii) allow market mechanisms to determine prices, (iv) create legal certainty to raise \n                                                 \n1  Indonesia supports the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative proposed by United Kingdom Prime Minister \nTony Blair. \n ", "16     Appendix 2 \ninvestor confidence, and (v) end PERTAMINA\u2019s control of upstream activities and monopoly of \nthe downstream sector. \n \n10.  Under the new law, investors conduct (i) upstream activities under cooperation contracts \nwith the state-owned implementing agency (BPMIGAS) or (ii) downstream activities under a \nbusiness  license  issued  by  the  state-owned  regulatory  agency.  LNG  plants  may  be  flexibly \nconsidered as either upstream or downstream activities depending on their commercial objectives. \nHistorically, all of Indonesia\u2019s LNG projects have been integrated with production-sharing contract \nassets, and are thus considered an upstream activity.2   \n \n11.  In January 2001, the new Fiscal Decentralization Law was promulgated. Under the new \nrevenue-sharing formulas, 15% of the Government\u2019s net oil revenues and 30% of its net natural \ngas  revenues  are  directed  to  provincial  and  district  governments.  The  Government\u2019s  net \nrevenues can be realized as profit after cost recovery and deduction of the production-sharing \ncontractor\u2019s share. Of the 15% of the Government\u2019s net oil revenue flowing to the regions, 6% \nwill go to the region of origin, 6% will be shared among the other districts in the province, and \n3% will go to the provincial government. In the case of the Government\u2019s net gas revenues, \n12% goes to the region of origin, 12% will be shared among the other districts in the province, \nand 6% will go to the provincial government. However, special autonomy provisions for Aceh \nand Irian give those two provinces 70% of net oil and gas profits, with the remaining 30% going \nto the central Government. \n \n                                                 \n2  Noting the success of past projects and the familiarity of all parties with the upstream structure for LNG plants (both    \nfrom a development and a financing standpoint), the Project is pursuing an upstream designation.   \n ", "Appendix 3   1  7  \nCORPORATE PROFILE OF INVESTORS \n \n \nA.
