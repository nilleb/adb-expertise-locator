This will be accomplished by\ntapping additional water resources from the Melamchi River,\nincreasing the water treatment capacity, enhancing access to\nwater, and optimizing the use of existing water resources.  The\nProject will also improve the living conditions of the people in\nthe project area by mitigating direct and indirect project impacts\nand  channeling  benefits  to  the  beneficiaries  on  a  long-term\nbasis,  with  particular  emphasis  on  social  and  environmental\naspects. The Project will introduce institutional reforms with a\nview to ensuring sustainability of services.\nClassification Primary:  Human Development\nSecondary: Environment\nEnvironment Assessment Category: A\nA summary environmental impact assessment was circulated to\nthe Board on 23 August 2000.\nRationale Kathmandu Valley, an area of 500 square kilometers and home\nto about 1.5 million people, is the country\u2019s single largest urban\neconomy and is critical to Nepal\u2019s economic growth.  Water is\ncentral to the well-being of the population and the key to its\nproductive  capacities.  However,  current  water  services  are\ngrossly inadequate and unreliable; many people must resort to\ntankered supplies, bottled water, and both deep and shallow\nwells. This trend has led to serious environmental concerns as\nshallow  wells  are  becoming  increasingly  polluted  and  deep\naquifers are being mined to secure additional water.  Poor water\nquality impacts sharply on public health. In terms of access to\nwater (in the dry season) and quality of water, almost all the\npopulation suffer, but the effects are greatest on the health of\nthe poor.\nIn addition, a strong and effective utility is needed to manage\nwater in Kathmandu Valley.  Nepal Water Supply Corporation's\noperational and financial situation has been precarious, mainly\ndue  to  lack  of  autonomy,  lack  of  water  to  distribute  and\ninefficient use of existing resources. The existing institutional\nframework needs to be comprehensively overhauled to meet the\nvalley\u2019s water and wastewater requirements.\nThe Government has recognized that, with external assistance a\ncomprehensive,  but  least-cost  solution  has  to  be  found  to\nmitigate the capital city\u2019s most serious socioeconomic problem.\nThe Project provides the required opportunity to address both\nthe  acute  socioeconomic  distress  caused  by  the  lack  of\nadequate safe water to Kathmandu Valley residents, and the", "iii\ninstitutional  challenges  to  provide  water  and  wastewater\nmanagement services on a sustainable basis.\nObjectives and Scope The main objectives of the Project are to alleviate the chronic\nwater shortage in Kathmandu Valley on a sustainable, long-term\nbasis,  and  to  improve  the  health  and  well-being  of  its\ninhabitants. The Project also seeks to develop a comprehensive\ninstitutional framework for water resource management within\nthe valley. The Project involves the transfer of water from the\nMelamchi  Valley  into  Kathmandu  Valley  through  a  diversion\nscheme with a 26-kilometer tunnel.\nThe Project comprises four parts: (i) infrastructure development,\n(ii) social and environmental support; (iii) institutional reforms,\nand  (iv)  project  implementation  support.  Infrastructure\ndevelopment will include the Melamchi diversion scheme, water\ntreatment plant, bulk distribution system, distribution networks,\nwastewater  system,  and  a  shallow  groundwater  well-field  in\nManohara. Social and environmental support will include a social\nuplift program to mitigate project impacts and channel benefits to\nbeneficiaries. A resettlement action plan and an environmental\nmanagement plan will be implemented to reduce and monitor any\nadverse social and environmental impacts. It will also include\nhygiene education, and public awareness programs. Institutional\nreforms  include  establishing  a  regulatory  body,  introducing  a\nprivate sector lease contract, and setting up a Kathmandu Valley\nwater authority for comprehensive water resource management\nand  establishing  groundwater  licensing  in  Kathmandu  Valley.\nProject  implementation  support  will  assist  the  Government  in\nimplementing the Project.\nCost Estimates The total cost of the Project is estimated at $464 million, including\ncontingencies and taxes.

THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on (i) a proposed\nloan to the Kingdom of Nepal for the Melamchi Water Supply Project, and (ii) the proposed\nadministration by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) of a loan for the Project to be provided by\nthe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Fund for International Development\n(OPEC Fund).\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2. In April 1996, His Majesty\u2019s Government of Nepal asked ADB to take the lead role in\nassisting the Government to prepare the Project. Recognizing the urgent need to augment\nwater supplies in Kathmandu Valley, ADB advised the Government that investment in physical\ninfrastructure  should  be  accompanied  by  major  reform  of  the  institutional  and  policy\nenvironment governing water supply in the valley. Accordingly, technical assistance (TA) to\naddress urban water supply reforms in the valley was provided in March 1998.1 Subsequently,\nin November 1998, an engineering loan was approved by ADB2 to assist in preparing detailed\ndesigns for the bulk distribution system component of the Project; provide project management\nsupport; assess project justification in economic, financial, environmental and social terms; and\nundertake pilot work for artificial groundwater recharge in the valley. The work under this loan is\nexpected to be completed by June 2001.\n3. The Fact-Finding Mission visited Nepal from 3-24 July 2000 to work with the Melamchi\nWater Supply Development Board (MWSDB) and to develop a consensus with the Government\nand  external  agencies  on  the  scope,  cost  estimates,  financing,  and  implementation\narrangements  for  the  Project.  Subsequently,  the  Appraisal  Mission3  visited  Nepal  from  17\nSeptember to 4 October 2000 and confirmed various project- and sector-related agreements\nand arrangements. This report is based on the findings of ADB missions, consultations with\nproject  beneficiaries,  reports  prepared  by  the  TA  and  loan  consultants,  discussions  with\nGovernment  ministries  and  departments,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and\nconsultations with external agencies involved in the Project. Appendix 1 presents the project\nframework.\nIII.  BACKGROUND\nA.  Sector Description\n1. Demographic Setting\n4. Nepal is divided into three ecologically distinct regions: mountains, hills, and the Terai.4\nThese regions are diverse in climate and topography, as well as in socioeconomic conditions\nand cultural practices. Over the past five decades, Nepal has been gradually urbanizing as a\nresult of the expansion of the nation\u2019s road network, the development of market centers, rural-\nurban migration, and the natural process of population growth and development. In less than 44\nyears, the population has increased from 8 million to nearly 22 million. In contrast, the urban\npopulation increased tenfold(cid:190) from 238,000 to nearly 2.3 million. Although the urban population\nremains  relatively  small  compared  with  the  rural  population,  urban  growth  rates,  which\n                                                          \n1  TA 2998-NEP:  Urban Water Supply Reforms in Kathmandu Valley, for $800,000, approved on 16 March 1998.\n2  Loan 1640-NEP(SF):  Melamchi Water Supply (Engineering) Project, for $5 million, approved on 10 November\n1998.\n3  The Mission comprised A. C. McIntosh, Senior Project Engineer and Mission Leader; B. Fawcett, Senior Programs\nOfficer; A. Goswami, Counsel; K. Julian, Programs and Implementation Officer; A. Perdiguero, Project Economist;\nS. Tanaka, Social Development Specialist; C. Vita, Associate Operations Analyst; and I. Walker, Financial Analyst\nand Staff Consultant.\n4  Terai is the southern plain area bordering India.", "2\nincreased  the  urban  population  five  times  over  the  last  three  decades,  are  significant.\nKathmandu Valley, with an estimated 1 million urban dwellers and half a million rural dwellers, is\nleading the way in urbanization with an estimated annual growth rate of 4 percent.\n5. The country\u2019s socioeconomic structure is based on subsistence agriculture with high\nunderemployment and low agricultural productivity. Over the last two decades, average life\nexpectancy in Nepal increased by 13.5 years, to 57 years, which is the lowest in South Asia.\nThe life expectancy rate for women is lower than that for men. Infant mortality continues to be\nhigh, with one of every 10 children dying in infancy. Infants in rural areas are exposed to a\nhigher risk of death than those in urban areas, and infants in the mountainous region are more\nthan twice as likely to die as those in the hilly and lowland regions.5 The incidence of maternal\nmortality is one of the highest in the world; the maternal morbidity rate is also high. Malnutrition\nis widespread, with over half of all households suffering from some degree of food insecurity.\n6. On average, food expenditure accounts for 62 percent of household income, leaving\ninsufficient income to pay for health, education, and other necessities. Although legislation on\nwomen's property rights has been drafted for consideration by Parliament, the gender disparity\nin income is currently acute and results from the control of income by the male head of the\nhousehold and the near total lack of property rights for women. The disparity in assets and\nincome often has a detrimental effect on household health, nutrition, education, and overall\nstandard of living.\n2. Poverty in the Kathmandu Valley\n7. Concern is increasing about the persistence of the high poverty incidence among the rural\npopulation  despite  the  Government\u2019s  large  development  expenditures,  assisted  by  external\nfunding agencies. The recent estimate indicates that 42 percent of the country\u2019s total population\nare living below the official poverty line. According to the Human Development Report of the\nUnited Nations Development Programme for 2000, Nepal ranks 144th of 174 countries, with its\nhuman development index estimated at 0.474. The poverty incidence is highest in rural areas and\nremote  districts.  Against  this  background,  poverty  reduction  is  the  primary  objective  of  the\nGovernment\u2019s development policy, as indicated in the Government's Ninth Development Plan\n(1997-2002).\n8. Nepal\u2019s poverty is characterized by social exclusion based on ethnicity, and gender.\nOccupational castes are found among the poorest, while women suffer more from being in\npoverty than men due to deprivation of access to education, health, productive assets and\nresources, and decision-making opportunities.\n9. Although no official estimates of the extent of poverty in Kathmandu Valley are available,\ndata derived from the Nepal Living Standards Survey of 1995/96 indicates that based on a\npoverty threshold of NRs9,000 per capita per annum, equivalent to about $122, the extent of the\nurban poor ranges from 10 to 13 percent. However, given that rents and other costs are higher\nin  Kathmandu  than  in  other  urban  areas  of  the  country,  12  to  15  percent  would  be  a\nconservative estimate of urban poverty in Kathmandu Valley. Nevertheless, income poverty\nalone is insufficient to understand the extent of poverty in the valley.\n10. Most of Kathmandu\u2019s poor live in very low quality houses, squatter settlements, or rented\naccommodation. Rental accommodation is occupied by a range of low-income groups, such as\ndaily wage earners, hawkers, and partly skilled laborers. Squatters live mainly on marginal\ngovernment-owned land; their population has grown considerably and is now estimated at\n                                                          \n5 United Nations Development Programme. 1998. Nepal Human Development Report, 1998, Nepal South Asia\nCenter, Kathmandu.", "3\n18,000. Overall, most poor live in small settlements in the midst of higher\u2013income housing and,\nconsequently, are not very visible.\n11. Access  to  reliable  water  supplies  is  a  problem  for  most  low-income  communities.\nReliance on public supplies from the Nepal Water Supply Corporation (NWSC) is minimal; most\nurban poor depend on private or traditional sources of supply. Shallow tubewells are a popular\nsource but these are usually contaminated and responsible for a variety of waterborne diseases.\nAbout 67 percent of the population believe that the quality of water supplied by NWSC is poor;\nalmost 72 percent of households in Kathmandu Valley treat their water before consumption.\nBoiling and filtering, the most common means of treatment, involve considerable expense and\nimpact mainly on the poor. Based on a 1999 survey undertaken during project preparation, 36\npercent of the households suffer from water-related diseases. Diarrhea, stomach ailments, and\ndysentery are the dominant health problems and impact significantly on productivity and income\nbecause of working days lost and treatment expenses. Although no data is officially available,\ndiarrhea is a leading cause for child mortality throughout Nepal, and Kathmandu Valley in\nparticular.\n12. The hardships in accessing water in Kathmandu Valley are severe. With piped water\nsupplies limited to two hours every alternate day, most consumers, and particularly the poor,\nrely  on  secondary  sources.6  Although  the  time  spent  by  the  poor  in  accessing  water  for\ndomestic use varies, approximately an hour is required. A number of domestic functions are\nundertaken at the water point to minimize the volume of water to be carried home. Women are\npredominantly the carriers of water. Residents of low-income areas carry home only about 10\nliters per person of water every day. This is insufficient to maintain basic hygiene and sanitation\nstandards, and is a prime cause of the high levels of morbidity and mortality.\n13. The project area also covers a large part of Sindhupalchok District and a small part of\nKabhre Palanchok District, both of which are predominantly rural despite their proximity to\nKathmandu. The poverty incidence in Sindhupalchok District is high at about 50-55 percent.\nEighty-five percent of the population lives at subsistence levels. Small landholding size (0.6\nhectare on average), physical remoteness due to topography and lack of roads, low agricultural\nproductivity, and poor access to health and education services perpetuate poverty in the district.\n3. National Context of Water Supply\n14. Nepal has abundant water resources. It possesses about 2.3 percent of the world\u2019s\nwater resources with less than 0.4 percent of the world\u2019s population. However, drinking water\nsupplies in most rural and urban areas are inadequate due partly to lack of investment in\nimproved  services,  but  also  as  a  result  of  failure  to  develop  sustainable  operation  and\nmanagement of those services. Coverage of adequate water supplies and sanitation in rural\nareas is estimated at 66 percent and 18 percent respectively; similar coverage in urban areas is\nestimated at 66 percent and 67 percent.\n4. Situation in Kathmandu Valley\n15. Kathmandu  Valley,  which  includes  the  three  major  urban  centers  of  Kathmandu,\nBhaktapur, and Lalitpur has serious problems with water resources. Due to deforestation of\ncatchments, rapid runoff of rainfall occurs in the short wet season (June to August) and an acute\nshortage of water flow is experienced in the rivers during the longer dry season. This results in\nsevere  environmental  pollution  of  the  rivers,  particularly  the  Bagmati,  which  runs  through\nKathmandu. In recent years, as a result of the seasonal shortage of water, industries and the\nwater utility itself, have resorted to extracting groundwater. Unfortunately, due to the number of\n                                                          \n6 Based on a 1999 survey undertaken during project preparation, 86 percent of the sampled NWSC consumers were\nusing secondary sources.", "4\nclay layers interspersed in the aquifer, most of the groundwater is not recharged naturally during\nthe heavy rainfalls in the wet season. A number of in-valley alternatives such as damming of\ntributary rivers and further development of groundwater have been explored. But these are\nconstrained by social and technical issues, and fail to provide a long-term response to the\nmatter of increasing water demand.  While water use in Kathmandu Valley must be optimized,\nthe long-term solution must lie in developing out-of-valley resources.\n16. One of the most serious concerns of the water supply situation in Kathmandu Valley is\nthe unsanitary conditions created partly by the water shortage and partly by the apparent\nignorance of most people about the connection between water, sanitation hygiene, and their\nhealth. Ninety percent of the people surveyed do not think they frequently suffer from water-\nrelated diseases, but 36 percent are in fact experiencing these.\n17. The current piped water supply demand in Kathmandu Valley is about 150 million liters\nper day (MLD), but the combined supply of groundwater and surface water in the dry season\nvaries between 65 and 85 MLD. Even in the wet season, the supply only reaches 140 MLD.\nMany people resort to tankered water, costing at least $1.00 per cubic meter. Average daily\nconsumption is around 70 liters per capita as compared with figures of around 150 liters per\ncapita elsewhere in the region, i.e., the demand is constrained by the availability of water. The\npiped water supply system is not only handicapped by inadequate water resources, treatment\ncapacity is insufficient and the bulk distribution system is inadequate. Water losses, which\ncannot be accurately measured due to the absence of 24-hour supply and nonfunctioning\nmeters, are estimated to range from 30 to 40 percent of production depending on the season.\nAnother consequence of the current situation is the exploitation of consumers (and the poor in\nparticular) by both the formal and informal providers of water in terms of price and availability.\n18. Of  the  seven  sewage  treatment  plants  (STPs)  in  Kathmandu  Valley,  four,  with  a\ncombined capacity of 19 MLD, need rehabilitation. A new STP with a capacity of 17 MLD is\nunder construction. Another STP treats about 100 truckloads per day of septage from septic\ntanks. The sewer system is a combined one, taking storm water, septic tank effluent, and raw\nsewage. Many of these sewers discharge directly into the Bagmati River.\n5. Institutional Arrangements and Sector Issues\n19. The Ministry of Physical Planning and Works (MPPW) is responsible for all water supply\nand sanitation in the country. It reviews and approves sector plans, policies, and development\nbudgets. It also supervises several sector institutions, including the Department of Water Supply\nand Sewerage (DWSS), NWSC, the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Fund Board, and the\nTown Development Fund. MPPW also oversees the MWSDB, which was set up in 1998 to\nimplement the Project.\n20. NWSC has been responsible for most of the water supplies and sewerage in Kathmandu\nValley. Unfortunately, although having autonomy in terms of its legislation, in practice NWSC\nhas not been allowed to exercise it, either as a water utility or as an executing agency for the\nimplementation of major projects to improve water supplies and sewerage. Lack of political will\nto approve tariff increases, combined with an ever-deteriorating level of service, has meant that\nNWSC is no longer servicing its debts, which mostly derived from a number of loans from the\nWorld Bank over the last 30 years. NWSC has suffered from having four different general\nmanagers over the last four years, and is overstaffed. Staff morale is low and the level of skills\nexhibited by its operation and maintenance (O&M) staff is poor. Furthermore, its budget has\nbeen inadequate to undertake proper maintenance. The need for NWSC to improve its service\nquality has been evident for several years. Recently, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City has been\nactive  in  developing  its  own  small  STPs  and  some  sewers.  The  Government  has  now", "5\nrecognized  that  some  form  of  private  involvement  in  Kathmandu  Valley\u2019s  water  supply\nmanagement is needed to improve service delivery.\n21. DWSS is concerned mainly with rural water supply and sanitation, and in operating a few\nurban water supply systems outside Kathmandu Valley. It is increasingly cognizant of its role to\nfacilitate rather than implement water and sanitation projects. Communities are involved in the\nplanning, design, construction, O&M, and financing of water supply and sanitation schemes.\nHowever, more needs to be done to provide the right set of incentives for DWSS to effectively\norient itself to help local communities meet their water and sanitation needs.\n22. Key sector issues relate to good governance, private sector participation, cost recovery\nand sustainability, and conservation of natural resources. The absence of a clearly defined\npolicy for urban water supply and sewerage has handicapped sector progress, and prevented a\nregulatory body being established to oversee and guide the provision and delivery of quality and\naffordable water services to consumers. Given the current status of water supply in Kathmandu\nValley, such a body is badly needed. A related sector issue is private participation, which is\nessential to improve service quality and efficiency, and to demonstrate the value that could be\nadded by involving the private sector in the discharge of public responsibilities.\n23. With regard to cost recovery, the current situation in Kathmandu Valley, comprising the\nabsence of adequate water resources and poor delivery, does not provide incentives for either\nthe supplier or the consumer to ensure that the costs of an inadequate service are met. This\nsituation is compounded by the absence of a clear statement on tariff policy. Also, the objective\nof providing equitable service to the poor remains unmet. The Government must take steps to\noutline a tariff policy based on full cost recovery, that ensures specific access to water for and\naffordability to the urban poor, and promotes demand management.\n24. Water is in short supply in the valley. Conserving water through a set of policies that\nprovide  for  optimizing  water  use  and  ensuring  its  holistic  management  is  a  paramount\nconsideration.  The  sector  cannot  hope  to  develop  without  a  strong  conservation  bias.\nGroundwater  licensing  would  prevent  further  damage  to  the  depleted  aquifers  and  enable\nrecharge. Industries that pollute water sources and are water intensive need to be relocated\noutside the valley so that scarce resources are optimally used. Also, consumers within the\nvalley need to develop greater consciousness of the economic value of water. To this end,\nconsumers need to agree with the residents of Melamchi Valley on the payment of a levy for the\nuse of water from the Melamchi River. In institutional terms, the absence of a body to coordinate\nand guide water use within Kathmandu valley is inhibiting the holistic management of all water\nresources. A valleywide water authority is needed to manage water allocation and use.\nB.  Government Policies and Plans\n25. The Government\u2019s Ninth Development Plan  calls for sustainable development, effective\nservice delivery, and equitable access to water supply and sanitation services. Specifically, the\nninth plan advocates (i) mobilizing local resources for the supply of safe drinking water; (ii)\nprotecting existing water sources; (iii) giving priority to the underprivileged; (iv) encouraging\nactive  involvement  of  user  groups;  (v) integrating  sanitation  programs  and  water  supply\nactivities;  (vi)  developing  simple  low-cost  technologies;  (vii)  redefining  the  roles  and\nresponsibilities of existing institutions for effective and efficient service delivery and facilitation of\ndecentralized operational modalities; (viii) developing NGOs, community-based organizations,\nand the private sector as partner organizations for overall sector development; (ix) making user\ngroups and local authorities responsible for project formulation, implementation and O&M; and\n(x) developing technical and institutional capabilities to reduce water leakage and waste in\nurban areas.", "6\n26. In April 1998, the Government approved a national water supply and sanitation policy,\nwith  the  main  objectives  of  extending  service  coverage,  maximizing  health  benefits,  and\naddressing gender concerns. While most of the policy statements are similar to those made in\nthe ninth plan, the newly established sector policy emphasizes that (i) Government agencies\nshould act as facilitators rather than implementers of water supply and sanitation projects, and\nsuch facilitation should take place at decentralized levels; (ii) the benefits of water supply and\nsanitation projects are to be measured in terms of improved health and reduced suffering for\nwomen and disadvantaged groups; (iii) the Government must retain certain roles to safeguard\nthe  public  interest,  such  as  coordinating  sector  activities,  regulating  water  resource  use,\nmonitoring water quality, and conducting certain aspects of utility operations; (iv) community-\nbased and private sector approaches to the provision of water supply and sanitation services\nare the most efficient and cost effective; and (v) water supply and sanitation is sustainable only\nif beneficiaries meet O&M needs.\n27. The Government, with the assistance of the World Bank and the Canadian International\nDevelopment  Agency  (CIDA),  has  been  formulating  a  national  water  sector  strategy.  For\nKathmandu Valley, the Government has developed a specific water supply and wastewater\nsector strategy (Appendix 2) based on integrating the needs of the people, and land and water\nuse. The vision for the next 30 years embraces a population of between 2.6 and 3.7 million\nwhich is restricted by planning and the provision of services. The relocation of polluting and\nwater-intensive industries, such as the carpet factories, outside of the valley will help. Likewise\nthe development of small towns, including their water supplies, will help to stem the flow of\nurban migration to Kathmandu Valley. Strict adherence to an agreed land-use plan will be\nneeded to allow the population density to be controlled. This in turn, will lead to a better quality\nof life.\n28. Water demand in Kathmandu Valley is estimated to reach 600 MLD by 2030, inclusive of\nindustrial water use. This is likely to be met from about 150 MLD of surface and groundwater\nresources within the valley and 450 MLD from surface waters in the Melamchi, Yangri, and\nLarke  river  basins.  Conjunctive  use  of  surface  and  groundwater  is  envisaged,  where  the\nsustainable yield of groundwater inside the valley is not exceeded. Part of the sector strategy is\nto  optimize  the  use  of  water  within  the  valley.  This  will  entail  development  of  rainwater\nharvesting, farmers' trading water rights, and demand management by pricing and awareness;\nreduction of piped water losses; wastewater recycling and storage of wet season water for dry\nseason use. For wastewater, the development vision includes, in the short term, an accent on\nrehabilitating existing facilities; increasing numbers of public toilets; improving operation of on-\nsite  sanitation,  including  desludging  and  treatment  of  septage;  and  introducing  wetlands\ntreatment of grey water.\n29. Fundamental  to  the  valley  sector  strategy,  is  the  concept  of  comprehensive  water\nresource management under a future Kathmandu Valley water authority (KVWA), which will\nrepresent  the  local  authorities  and  be  responsible  for  the  conservation,  development,  and\nmanagement of all surface water and groundwater, including use for water supply and irrigation,\nand disposal of wastewater including pollution control. The authority will be encouraged to use\nthe private sector to manage and develop water supply and wastewater services.  A water\nsupply and sanitation regulatory body will be established initially for Kathmandu Valley and later\nfor the whole of Nepal. The strategy for cost recovery for water supply services in the valley is\nthat full cost recovery, including revenues from tariffs covering all future investments, will be\nphased  in  by  2010.  For  wastewater  disposal,  in  the  near  future  only  O&M  costs  will  be\nrecovered  through  tariffs,  but  this  will  be  extended  to  include  debt  servicing  and  greater\nrecovery of investment costs in a phased manner. Groundwater licensing will be introduced in\nthe immediate future and major industrial users will be required to pay for water consumed on a\nvolume basis.", "7\nC.  External Assistance to the Sector\n30. Major external assistance for rural water supply and sanitation started in the 1970s and\naccelerated in the 1980s with the launch of the International Water Supply and Sanitation\nDecade (1980-1990). Earlier, the World Bank and, more recently, ADB have been the lead\nexternal funding agencies. ADB has provided four loans since 1984 for a total of $63 million,\ncovering about 3 million rural population in the Eastern, Midwestern and Far Western regions.\nOf the four ADB financed-projects, three are completed and the fourth is progressing well. Apart\nfrom ADB, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund and the governments of Finland, Switzerland,\nand the United Kingdom have also provided assistance for the development of rural water\nsupply and sanitation. More recently, the World Bank assisted in establishing a rural water\nsupply  and  sanitation  development  fund  board,  which  has  been  active  in  implementing\ncommunity-based and demand-responsive rural water supply and sanitation schemes.\n31. In September 2000, ADB approved a loan for the Small Towns Water Supply and\nSanitation Sector Project.7 The project will improve water supply and sanitation conditions in 40-\n50 small towns with an average population of 12,000 per town. Water users will contribute 50\npercent of subproject costs in cash and kind. The project represents a special effort by ADB to\npromote participatory development and the Government\u2019s decentralization agenda.8\n32. In the urban water supply and sanitation sector, the World Bank has been providing\ncredits  to  NWSC  since  the  late  1970s.  Much  of  this  assistance  has  centered  on  Greater\nKathmandu water supply and sanitation, and is expected to continue with support to the Project\nthrough the proposed private sector lease contract, distribution rehabilitation, and distribution\nexpansion. The Government of Japan has also provided much development assistance to the\nsector, including support for the construction of two water treatment plants in Kathmandu Valley.\nDetails of external assistance to the sector are presented in Appendix 3.\nD.  Lessons Learned\n33. Valuable lessons have been learned from ADB's assistance to the country and sector.\nCountrywide lessons are reported in the 1999 Country Synthesis of Evaluation Findings.9 The\nkey lessons include the following:\n(i)  Participation  of  local  communities  during  both  design  and  implementation  is\ncrucial for project sustainability and success.\n(ii)  Project  design  should  institute  appropriate  O&M  mechanisms  and  properly\ndelineate responsibilities.\n(iii)  Good governance and anticorruption measures contribute to a more favorable\nproject implementation environment.\n(iv) Private sector participation should be encouraged, especially in the marketing,\ndistribution, and maintenance of project outputs.\n34. The lessons learned from World Bank experience in the sector in Kathmandu Valley are\nprimarily that legislating autonomy for an institution such as NWSC does not necessarily make it\na  good  water  utility,  nor  a  good  executing  agency,  if  no  political  support  exists  for  that\n                                                          \n7  Loan 1755-NEP: Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project, for $35 million, approved on 12\nSeptember 2000.\n8 At the request of the Government, and in line with ADB's sector strategy, ADB is also preparing an urban\nenvironmental improvement project aimed at Kathmandu Valley satellite towns.\n9  ADB, 1999. Nepal: 1999 Country Synthesis of Evaluation Findings, Manila.", "8\nautonomy. Also, investment in physical infrastructure needs to be properly sequenced with\ninstitutional  reform.  Trying  to  achieve  reforms  in  parallel  with  investment  did  not  prove\nsuccessful,  as  the  implementing  agency's  focus  was  on  setting  physical  targets,  while\ninstitutional change was marginalized. The lessons learned have been incorporated in project\ndesign by ensuring that (i) a transparent and pro-poor tariff policy will be endorsed by the\nGovernment, (ii) a water supply and sanitation regulatory body will be established to implement\npolicy in the valley, and (iii) a private sector contract will be awarded to manage water supply\nand sewerage in the valley. However, major investments in the distribution system will be\nsubject to satisfactory performance of the lease contract.\n35. Lessons that ADB has learned from its experience in the urban water supply sector\nelsewhere in Asia can also be applied to this Project. Tariffs are the lifeblood of a utility. Tariffs\nensure revenues that translate into the ability to provide and maintain high-quality service to\nconsumers. The notion that the poor cannot pay for water is a myth. Invariably, the poor pay\nmore for water on a unit basis than the more affluent, because they must procure water by the\ncontainer rather than through a piped supply to their homes. The scarcity of water in Kathmandu\nValley illustrates that water is an economic good. Tariffs that recover full costs ensure that water\nconsumption is controlled, and the burden of subsidy on the Government is reduced.\nE.  ADB's Sector Strategy\n36. The primary objective of ADB\u2019s operational strategy in Nepal is to achieve sustainable\npoverty reduction. To achieve this, ADB interventions aim to improve efficiency, predictability,\ntransparency, and accountability in key institutions responsible for delivering services, while\nreducing  poverty  through  equitable  access  to  basic  social  services  to  enhance  human\ndevelopment. ADB\u2019s sector strategy for water supply and sanitation supports the Government\u2019s\nstrategy.  The  most  important  elements  are  (i)  establishing  comprehensive  water  resource\nmanagement of river basins; (ii) establishing transparent government policy; (iii) implementing\nregulatory control of the sector, especially for levels of service, cost recovery, and maintenance;\n(iv) using the private sector for both development and management; and (v) taking care of the\nurban poor. ADB will continue to support rural and small towns water supply and sanitation.\nInvestments in wastewater may be considered for Kathmandu Valley during 2006-2008 to\nsupport the private sector managed utility in attaining self-sufficiency. ADB is also providing\nregional TA to support (i) the establishment of regulatory systems and networking of water\nutilities and regulatory bodies, and (ii) private sector delivery of water supply and sanitation\nservices  (and  solid  waste  disposal)  to  the  urban  poor.  ADB  and  CIDA  are  considering\ncofinancing a TA grant to study optimizing water use in Kathmandu Valley.\nF.  Policy Dialogue\n37. In the course of project preparation, ADB staff actively engaged the Government in\npolicy  dialogue.  The  dialogue  focused  on  four  areas:  good  governance,  private  sector\nparticipation, cost recovery, and conservation of natural resources.\n1. Good Governance\n38. Policy dialogue has led to (i) the establishment of MWSDB as an autonomous body to\nimplement the Project; (ii) the acceptance of an independent regulatory body to administer\nGovernment policy on water supply and sanitation in Kathmandu Valley; and (iii) the acceptance\nof KVWA to be responsible to local authorities for comprehensive water resource management\nof Kathmandu Valley. These reforms support the national process of civil service reform and\ngood governance being implemented in parallel through other ADB operations, as governance\nis  being  devolved  to  local  authorities  and  the  private  sector,  and  more  transparency  and\naccountability is being introduced. Furthermore, the private sector will be given the opportunity", "9\nto show how it can implement development more efficiently than the Government. Because of\nthis,  a  lease  contract  rather  than  a  pure  management  contract  will  be  introduced  for  the\nmanagement of the Kathmandu Valley urban water supply and sewerage. The policy dialogue\nto set up KVWA has been ongoing as the concept was first introduced under TA 2998-NEP\n(footnote 1), which was implemented from January 1999 to July 2000. Stakeholder participation\nhas been a feature of the process.\n39. ADB has strongly promoted good governance in the sector through (i) clear definition of\ngovernment  policy;  (ii)  an  independent  regulatory  body  to  implement  that  policy;  (iii)\ncomprehensive water resource management at the local authority level; and (iv) implementation\nof policy and plans, and O&M by the private sector. ADB has recommended that at least one of\nthe members of the regulatory body to be a female. A strong effort has been made to move\naway from regulation by contract to having a regulatory body in place prior to award of any\nprivate sector contract. The main emphasis will be on implementation of tariff policy and service\nstandards.\n2. Private Sector Participation\n40. Private sector participation was a prerequisite for ADB's involvement in the Project. A\nprivate  sector  lease  of  10  years  for  the  Kathmandu  Valley  water  supply,  treatment,  and\ndistribution is due for award in September 2001. The Project facilities are also expected to be\nmanaged by the private sector operator from 2006. While private sector participation in general\nhas been a project precondition by external funding agencies, the nature of the contract has\nbeen crafted through a participatory approach in which Government, NWSC, the private sector,\nand the external funding agencies have been able to contribute to a common goal. ADB's main\nconcerns have centered on the objectives of the lease contract and matching performance to\nthose objectives. One of those objectives is the equitable distribution of water, this entails\nensuring that the poor have equal access to water and are not disadvantaged in terms of unit\ncost.\n3. Cost Recovery and Sustainability\n41. In South Asia, the concept of water as a social good prevails over that of water as an\neconomic good. The transition from one to another generally comes about as a result of water\nshortage as is now the case in Kathmandu Valley. The Government has embraced the concept\nof full cost recovery for the water supplies to be phased in with the Project. Its agreement to a\n50:50 loan-grant ratio for relending of funds to the utility can be compared with the same terms\nfor a much better-off water and drainage utility in Sri Lanka. Tariff principles agreed with the\nGovernment include the need for cost recovery, demand management, specific access to water\nfor and affordability to the urban poor, and easy means for payment of water bills. Cost recovery\nwill mean all O&M costs are recovered pre-Project and all O&M plus debt service costs are\nrecovered post-Project. In the policy dialogue, ADB agreed with the Government that the private\noperator will not be allowed to sell water in bulk where the resale by vendors is at a unit cost\nmore than would be paid by the more affluent with house connections.\n4. Conservation of Natural Resources\n42. Policy dialogue has led to acceptance of (i) groundwater licensing and charging in\nKathmandu Valley; (ii) the payment of a levy by Kathmandu Valley consumers to the people of\nMelamchi Valley for use of their water; (iii) allowing KVWA to holistically manage all the water in\nKathmandu Valley, and thus preserve the quality and quantity of the resource; (iv) promotion of\nthe relocation of polluting and water intensive industries outside of Kathmandu Valley; and (v)\nthe policy to optimize water use in Kathmandu Valley as a necessary step to be taken before\nand in tandem with the use of water from the Melamchi River. These are all major reforms in", "10\nterms of what is being done elsewhere in Asia. The Government\u2019s readiness to embrace these\nreforms adds credence to its commitment to the Project and the sector. Groundwater licensing\nis necessary to ensure long-term sustainability of this resource while used conjunctively with\nsurface sources. The levy on the water tariff for consumers in Kathmandu Valley is a visible\nacknowledgement by the Government that it is unfair to take from one area of the country and\ngive to another without appropriate compensation. Consensus-building dialogue will be needed\nbetween the Government, and the people of Melamchi Valley during 2001 to reach agreement\non the amount of the levy. Establishing KVWA is an ambitious reform measure, but as agreed\nwith the Government this can be phased in progressively so that KVWA\u2019s functions increase\nwith time. ADB will also provide (together with CIDA) TA for optimizing water use in Kathmandu\nValley\u2014whereby new sources of supply (such as rainwater harvesting) will be developed, and\ndata on sources and demand will be continually refined under a computerized model so that the\nconjunctive use of surface and groundwater can be carefully managed.\nG. Project History\n43. The  Project\u2019s  history  dates  to  1988  when  a  prefeasibility  study  was  undertaken  to\ninvestigate  out-of-valley  water  resources.  It  examined  several  options  and  three  types  of\nschemes, i.e., gravity, pumped, and storage. The Melamchi Valley had the best combination of\neconomy  and  yield  to  meet  the  design  target  of  2  cubic  meter  (m3)/second  (s)  and  be\nexpandable\u2014all based on gravity supply. From a plain reading of the map, diverting water from\nthe Indrawati River, the closest water source to Kathmandu Valley, appears logical. However,\nthis option was ruled out because the elevation of the river is about 500 meters below the valley\nand  would  involve  high-pumping  costs  in  perpetuity.  In  1992,  a  full  feasibility  study  was\ncompleted showing that the development of the Melamchi River, followed by later developments\nof the adjacent Yangri and Larke rivers, was technically, socially, environmentally, economically,\nand financially feasible and the least-cost solution to providing water to Kathmandu Valley in the\nforeseeable future.\n44. Between 1996 and 1999, options to include hydropower in the Project were considered\nbut were finally rejected in 2000 on environmental grounds. In-valley alternatives that were\nseriously considered include (i) damming of in-valley rivers\u2014rejected due to low yield and\ncommunity objections, (ii) major in-valley storage\u2014rejected due to technical problems of water\nretention  and  public  safety,  and  (iii)  trading  of  water  rights\u2014rejected  on  social  grounds.\nAppendix 4 gives more details of the Project\u2019s history.\nIV. THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA.  Rationale\n45. Kathmandu Valley, an area of 500 square kilometers (km) and home to about 1.5 million\npeople, is the country\u2019s single largest urban economy and critical to Nepal\u2019s economic growth.\nOver 86 percent of its residents are engaged in urban-based employment with 55 percent being\nself-employed. About 15 percent of the urban population is poor and income disparities are\nhigh. Population growth is increasing at an annual rate of approximately 4 percent. This coupled\nwith an increase in incomes, is imposing extraordinary demands on basic water supplies and\nwastewater management services.\n46. Water is central to the well-being of the valley\u2019s population and the key to its  productive\ncapacity.  Currently, water services are grossly inadequate and unreliable. Water supplies to\nregistered consumers (about 86 percent of the population) are no more than two hours every\nalternate day in the dry season.  About 35 of the 112 municipal wards do not get any water in\nthe last 2-3 months of the dry season. Only about a third of NWSC\u2019s consumers have fully\nplumbed facilities; the rest rely on yard taps and shared facilities such as standposts. Recent", "11\nstudies show that without individual connections, the scope for improvements in public health is\nlimited. In the dry season, many consumers have to resort to tankered supplies (at costs up to\n$1.00 per cubic meter [m3]), bottled water, and deep wells. Serious environmental problems are\nemerging because of the shortages, as shallow wells are becoming increasingly polluted and\ndeep aquifers are being mined in an effort to secure additional water.\n47. Poor water quality impacts sharply on public health. Surveys show that the incidence of\ndiarrhea  is  almost  50  percent,  stomach  pain  23  percent,  and  dysentery  15  percent.  Skin\ndiseases, hepatitis, and malaria are also common.  While details are not available, empirical\nevidence suggests that the impact of water-borne diseases on morbidity and mortality rates is\nhigh.  Productivity is affected by sick time lost on account of water-borne diseases.\n48. The  shortage  of  water  impacts  particularly  on  the  poor.  While  access  in  terms  of\ndistance and time of availability is inadequate, the quality of water from various sources has the\nmost serious impacts on the health of the poor. Almost 50 percent of the water sources are\ncontaminated by fecal coliforms. Poor water management produces severe hardships for low-\nincome groups.  The average time spent on water collection in informal settlements is one hour\nper trip. Households in these settlements often have to collect water between 1 and 15 times a\nday. Individual low-income renters are particularly disadvantaged as they depend on landlords\nfor water services and are not supported by the community.\n49. Coupled  with  the  lack  of  adequate  water  supplies  and  wastewater  facilities  is  the\nabsence of a strong and effective public utility to serve the valley\u2019s needs.  NWSC has been in a\nprecarious operational and financial situation due mainly to a lack of autonomy, lack of water to\ndistribute and inefficient use of existing resources. The current institutional framework to meet\nand  manage  Kathmandu  Valley\u2019s  water  and  wastewater  requirements  needs  to  be\ncomprehensively overhauled.\n50. The Government has recognized that an urgent, comprehensive, but least-cost solution\nhas to be found to mitigate the capital city\u2019s most serious socioeconomic problems and has\narticulated  a  strategic  approach  to  meet  the  challenge.  Its  essential  components  are  (i)\noptimization of water use in Kathmandu Valley; (ii) development of new water sources outside\nthe  valley;  (iii)  developing  an  institutional  framework  for  comprehensive  water  resource\nmanagement and private sector operations; (iv) ensuring sustainability through full cost recovery\nand demand management; (v) integrating improvements in water services with other urban\nsector developments in the valley; and (vi) adopting a people-based approach where public\nawareness, public relations, and hygiene education are continuing activities.\n51. The Project provides the required opportunity to address both the acute socioeconomic\ndistress caused by the lack of adequate safe water to valley residents, and the institutional\nchallenges to providing water and wastewater management services on a sustainable basis to\nthe valley\u2019s population. External assistance is needed to support the Government\u2019s plans and\nstrategies to augment the supply of water to the valley, improve water supply and wastewater\nmanagement  services,  and  build  institutional  arrangements  that  will  effectively  sustain  the\nservices.\nB. Objectives and Scope\n52. The  main  objectives  of  the  Project  are  to  alleviate  the  chronic  water  shortage  in\nKathmandu Valley on a sustainable, long-term basis, and to improve the health and well-being\nof its inhabitants, particularly the poor. The Project also seeks to develop a comprehensive\ninstitutional framework for water resource management within the valley. The Project comprises\nfour parts.", "12\n1. Infrastructure Development\n53. The Melamchi Diversion Scheme (MDS) will bring 170 MLD of raw water from the\nMelamchi River into Kathmandu Valley through a 26 km tunnel.  About 25 km of access roads\nwill be built and 29 km of existing roads upgraded to facilitate construction and maintenance of\nthe project facilities.  A water treatment plant (WTP) with an initial capacity of 170 MLD, but with\nprovision for expansion to 510 MLD will be built to treat the water diverted from the Melamchi\nRiver into Kathmandu Valley.  A bulk distribution system (BDS) will be established comprising\nservice reservoirs strategically located in the valley and bulk supply pipelines to the reservoirs\nfrom the WTP. Distribution networks will be rehabilitated and improved at primary, secondary,\nand tertiary levels. Wastewater system improvements will also be undertaken in a phased\nmanner. A shallow groundwater well field will be developed at Manohara within the valley to\nextract, treat, and distribute 15 MLD of water in the dry season and 25 MLD in the wet season.\n2. Social and Environmental Support\n54. A social uplift program (SUP) will be undertaken to mitigate direct and indirect project\nimpacts, and to channel benefits to Melamchi Valley on a long-term basis to improve the living\nconditions of the people in the area. It will include buffer zone development, rural electrification,\nhealth, education, and income generation and community development. Separately, hygiene\neducation, and public awareness and relations programs will be developed and implemented.  A\nresettlement action plan (RAP), estimated to cost $15.8 million, was developed and will be\nimplemented in conjunction with the Project. An environmental management plan will also be\nimplemented to mitigate any adverse environmental impacts and to monitor progress. A third\nparty monitoring program will closely monitor implementation of the RAP and environment\nmanagement plan. A hygiene education and promotion program (HEPP) will be provided in\nKathmandu Valley. A groundwater monitoring program to ensure that the valley\u2019s groundwater\nresources are sustainably tapped has been designed and is being implemented. A web-site will\nbe developed in the local language to make project information available to the general public.\n3.  Institutional Reforms\n55. The Project provides an opportunity to introduce major institutional reforms for enhanced\nefficiencies in the management of water and wastewater in Kathmandu Valley. A regulatory\nbody for water supply and sanitation will be established, having at least one female member,\ninitially for the valley and later for the country. Private sector management of urban water\nsupplies from source to consumer, and sewerage from consumer to outfall will be introduced\nthrough an initial 10-year lease contract. KVWA will be established to provide comprehensive\nwater  resource  management  in  the  valley  including  that  for  groundwater,  surface  water,\ndomestic water supply, and irrigation. KVWA will be a small, professional body that lets out\ncontracts to the private sector for implementation of its policies and plans. When the private\noperator's lease contract is renegotiated after 5 years, KVWA will be a counter-party to the\ncontract. Finally, groundwater licensing will be introduced in Kathmandu Valley to facilitate the\ncontrolled extraction of groundwater.\n4. Project Implementation Support\n56. This  will  comprise  establishing  a  project  management  unit  (PMU)  with  government\ncounterpart staff, and international and domestic consultants. The MWSDB will be responsible\nfor  overall  project  management,  coordinating  the  work  under  the  various  components.\nConsultants  will  support  the  PMU  in  carrying  out  various  project  administration  activities\nincluding monitoring of construction supervision, social and environmental activities, contract\nadministration, and project accounting. About 234 person-months of international consulting\nsupport and 846 person-months of domestic consulting support will be provided.", "13\nC. Technical Justification\n57. Water is acutely short in Kathmandu Valley. In the dry season, the combined surface\nand groundwater production for public use is as low as 65 MLD, amounting to an average\nconsumption for the 1 million people connected to the piped supply of about 46 liters per capita\nper day (lpcpd) after accounting for system losses. In the wet season, production can increase\nto 120 MLD, but losses increase to at least 40 percent of production, implying that average\nconsumption from the piped water supply is still only about 72 lpcpd. Also, water is not equitably\ndistributed, so at least one quarter of the people connected to the piped water supply system\nnever get piped water in the dry season. Another disturbing factor in the present situation is that\nmore than half of the production comes from groundwater, yet it has an average sustainable\nyield of only about 15 MLD from deep tubewells. This means most of the groundwater extraction\nis mining. Other cities in Asia have learned that this can lead to serious land subsidence\nproblems.\n58. Three interlinked solutions to the problem are available. First, a transparent Government\npolicy on tariffs made known to the consumers, the funding agencies, and the utility is required.\nSecond,  an  independent  regulatory  body  should  be  established  to  monitor  policy\nimplementation, and in particular decide if tariff revisions requested by the utility conform with\nthe policy. Third, a legal contract with the private sector to manage the water supplies should be\nput in place. The Project is designed around the three identified solutions. Phasing of the project\nfunding10 will provide leverage to ensure that the solutions are properly implemented.\n59. With regard to the harnessing of additional water, use of water in the Kathmandu Valley\nmust be optimized. This is possible through (i) damming some of the rivers that feed into the\nvalley to store wet season flows for use in the dry season, (ii) excavating shallow Sri Lankan\nstyle tanks for the same purpose, (iii) trading water rights with farmers, (iv) harvesting rainwater,\nand (v) recycling wastewater. These possibilities were examined in the context of least-cost\nalternatives, current and anticipated social and political realities, and the likely speed of reforms.\nWhen out-of-valley alternatives were looked at, the Melamchi option was identified as the most\npromising. However, the pursuit to optimize water use should not be postponed; the Project\nallows more time to fully study the possibilities. Meanwhile, demand management, crucial to\noptimizing water use, will be introduced using relatively high tariffs, post-Project, which will\nmake demand price elastic.\n60. Following the visit of a panel of experts (POE), agreement was reached that the MDS\ntunnel would be best operated as a pressure tunnel with provision for periodic desilting and\nadequate air vents. For both hydraulic and construction purposes, the minimum tunnel cross-\nsectional area will be 10.7 square meters (m2). Drill and blast methods for tunnel boring will be\nemployed. The intake is best located where the weir crest is at 1,425 m due to the poor geology\nand the topography at the slightly higher intake site.\n61. The water treatment plant is expected to be of conventional design. Land acquisition will\nbe  minimized  even  though  a  future  design  capacity  of  510  MLD  is  assumed.  Stable  and\ncontinuous water supply for the WTP will be taken into account in terms of tunnel maintenance.\n62. The bulk distribution system was designed for 255 MLD capacity because it will take not\nonly the Melamchi water (170 MLD) but also existing supplies of 85 MLD. The BDS will be\nduplicated at the time of harnessing the Yangri River. The design incorporates potential for\nclosing  the  bulk  distribution  to  make  a  complete  ring  main;  this  will  improve  distribution\nefficiency and reliability.\n                                                          \n10The World Bank will consider providing an additional $65 million for the Project in 2003 subject to satisfactory\nimplementation of policy and institutional reforms and good progress on the private sector lease contract.", "14\n63. Improvements to the distribution system await the appointment of the private operator in\n2001. Effective metering of all consumers is needed as is mapping of the distribution network.\nThe private operator will be expected to undertake considerable training of the utility staff, as\ninadequate staff capacity was identified as a serious constraint. Also it will be necessary for the\ncontractor to link any new connections with increases in production capacity and reduction of\nlosses. By fixing visible leaks coverage of 24-hour supply may be available pre-Project, but full\ncoverage with a 24-hour supply is not expected until project completion.\n64. Three factors will influence the nature and extent of wastewater improvements to be\neffected under this Project. The first is the need to make what has already been put in place\nwork well. That includes rehabilitating existing STPs and sewers, and ensuring proper collection\nand treatment of septage from septic tanks. The second is the need to look at more on-site\nsanitation and natural treatment of wastewater. The third is that large-scale sewerage schemes\nwith more STPs would be too costly for the Government to implement simultaneously with the\nProject.\nD. Cost Estimates\n65. The Project is estimated to cost $464 million including contingencies, interest during\nconstruction, and taxes and duties. Foreign exchange costs are estimated at 59 percent of total\ncosts; local currency costs at 41 percent. The main cost items (base costs) are the MDS\n($74.29  million),  WTP  ($39.33  million),  BDS  ($48.47  million),  and  the  distribution  network\nimprovements ($65.95 million). Table 1 gives a summary of the estimated costs; details are in\nAppendix 5.\nTable 1: Cost Estimates\n($ million)\nItem Foreign Local Total\nExchange Currency Cost\nA. Base\n1.

Financing Plan\n66. The project components are at various stages of preparation, partly because of earlier\nfinancing constraints and partly because of their relevance to the critical path for commissioning.\nTable 2 shows the financing plan; details are in Appendix 5. An ADB loan for $120 million is\nproposed to finance costs relating to the MDS, SUP, BDS, wastewater system improvements,\nproject management, and other social and environmental improvements. The loan will finance\nabout 26 percent of the total project cost, including 34 percent of foreign exchange costs ($93\nmillion), and 14 percent of the local currency costs ($27 million). It will be provided from ADB\u2019s\nSpecial Funds resources, be repayable over 32 years including 8 years of grace, carry interest\nat 1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent thereafter.\n67. The local cost financing being provided by ADB for the Project is justified on country and\nproject considerations. Nepal relies on development assistance for about 50 percent of its\nannual development expenditures. While the budget deficit remains stable from year to year at\nabout 3.9 percent of gross domestic product, the inflow of aid funds is required to finance the\nforeign and local cost components of development projects. The proposed level of local cost\nfinancing is justified based on the Government\u2019s weak revenue generation capacity and the\nneed  for donor assistance to meet financing requirements, particularly for large infrastructure\nprojects. The Government accords top priority to the Project as it will alleviate the acute water\nshortage in Kathmandu Valley and reduce the incidence of disease caused by poor water\nquality.  Local  currency  costs  account  for  41  percent  of  total  project  costs,  of  which  the\nGovernment is providing 61 percent. However, local financing assistance by external project\ncofinanciers is required to supplement the Government\u2019s contribution, and is justified given the\nlarge domestic cost component of the Project.\nTable 2:  Financing Plan\n($ million)\nSource Foreign Local Total Percent\nExchange Currency Cost\nADB 93  27 120 25.9\nWorld Bank 61 19 80 17.2\nJBIC 46 6 52 11.2\nNORAD 23 5 28 6.0\nSida 20 5 25 5.4\nNDF 8 1 9 1.9\nOPEC Fund 8 6 14 3.0\nJapan 14 4 18 3.9\nGovernment 0 118 118 25.4\n       Total 273 191 464 100.0\n       ADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  JBIC  =  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation,  NDF  =  Nordic\nDevelopment Fund, NORAD = Norwegian Agency for International Development, OPEC = Organization of\nPetroleum Exporting Countries, Sida = Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency.\n68. The Government is expected to finance approximately 25 percent of the project cost; its\ncash contribution is estimated at $46.6 million (10 percent of the total cost), net of taxes and\nduties, and interest during construction. The Government is expected to be able to meet the\naverage  annual  contribution  of  counterpart  funds  estimated  between  $5  and  $12  million.\nConcurrently with NWSC signing a private sector lease contract for the leased assets with the\nPO, the Government will transfer the leased assets to the utility and enter into a subsidiary loan\nagreement upon terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB. The terms of repayment of the loan\nfor purchasing the leased assets will be on a 50 percent grant, 50 percent loan basis, and for\nthe loan portions, will include an annual interest rate of 8 percent, with principal repayable over", "16\n20 years inclusive of a 7-year grace period. The Government will assume the foreign exchange\nrisk on all sums due and owing under the subsidiary loan agreement.\n69. The World Bank is expected to provide a credit of about $15 million in 2001 (for the\nprivate sector lease contract and urgently needed rehabilitation of the distribution network). The\nprovision  of  an  additional  credit  of  about  $65  million  in  2003  (for  the  distribution  network\nimprovements) will be contingent upon satisfactory performance under the initial credit and the\noverall progress of the Government in implementing the reform agenda. The Japan Bank for\nInternational  Cooperation  (JBIC)  will  fund  about  $52  million  in  2001  (for  the  WTP).  The\nNorwegian Agency for International Development (NORAD) will provide a grant equivalent to\n$28 million in 2001 ($25 million to meet the tunnel costs, and $3 million previously committed for\nMDS design). The Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) has agreed\nin principle to provide funds matching those of NORAD, equivalent to $25 million in mixed\ncredits in 2001 (for part financing of the tunnel). The Nordic Development Fund (NDF) will fund\n$9 million in 2001 (to finance the construction supervision for the MDS). The OPEC Fund will\nfinance about $13.7 million in 2001 (for the access roads). The Government has asked the\nJapanese Government to finance the shallow groundwater development in Manohara for about\n$18  million  on  a  grant  basis.11  All  cofinancing  is  on  a  parallel  basis,  including  the  ADB-\nadministered  OPEC  Fund.  The  terms  and  conditions  of  financing  of  the  various  funding\nagencies are shown in Appendix 5.\nF. The Executing Agency\n70. MPPW  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project,  and  MWSDB  will  be  the\nImplementing  Agency.  MWSDB  members  include  the  MPPW  secretary  as  chairperson,\nmembers  at  the  joint  secretary  level  from  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Ministry  of  Water\nResources,  and  the  mayor  of  Kathmandu  Metropolitan  City  and  the  executive  director  as\nmember Secretary, who will also be the project director. The full time executive director, also at\nthe joint secretary level, will be appointed from MPPW. MWSDB has about 40 staff of which 20\nare professionals. It has been successfully executing the ADB-funded Melamchi Water Supply\n(Engineering) Project.12 It has also demonstrated autonomy in decision making, which was the\nmain objective when it was established. The Government will ensure continued non-interference\nwith MWSDB's autonomy of decision making.\nG. Implementation Arrangements\n1. Project Management Unit\n71. A high-level steering committee comprising the ministers of Ministry of Finance, Ministry\nof Water Resources, MPPW and the vice-chairman of the NPC will be established to deal with\nmajor issues affecting the Project. The PMU will be established within the responsibility of the\nMWSDB and will be responsible for the day-to-day management of the Project. The PMU will be\nheaded  by  the  project  director,  who  will  be  a  senior  officer  at  joint  secretary  level.  Its\ngovernment  counterpart  staff  will  be  supported  by  a  team  of  domestic  and  international\nconsultants.  The  PMU  will  have  six  divisions:  (i)  an  information  division  comprising  public\nrelations,  management  information  system,  reporting,  and  planning  and  scheduling;  (ii)  an\nengineering  division  for  specifications,  drawings,  construction  supervision,  and  quality  and\nsafety monitoring; (iii) a social and environment division to cover resettlement, compensation,\nsocial  mobilization,  gender,  hygiene  education,  NGO  coordination,  consensus  building,\nenvironmental management, and benefit monitoring; (iv) a procurement division addressing\nlegal aspects, claims, consultants, suppliers, and contractors; (v) an administration division\n                                                          \n11The amount will be firmed up during the basic design study to be carried out over a period of six months\ncommencing in November 2000.\n12Loan 1640-NEP: Melamchi Water Supply (Engineering) Project, for $5 million, approved on 10 November 1998.", "17\nresponsible for personnel, transport, records, communication, and payroll; and (vi) a finance\ndivision for budget, loan administration, accounts, auditing, and disbursement. The Government\nagreed to exert its best endeavors to ensure that, subject to satisfactory performance, the\ninitially appointed project director and PMU division heads will be maintained in the positions for\na minimum of three years during project implementation and will seek ADB's concurrence for\nany change of those appointments. Preliminary organization charts for the Project in general\nand the PMU in particular are given in Appendix 6.\n72. The external funding agencies involved in the Project and the Government have agreed\non a special coordination mechanism. MWSDB will convene a meeting every two months in\nKathmandu at which external funding agencies, together with the Government, will review\nimplementation progress and assist the Government in taking any corrective action needed.\nSeparately, ADB will undertake two review missions each year; these will be of two weeks\nduration and representatives of external funding agencies will join them for at least a week\neach. At the end of the review mission, the MOF will convene a meeting of donors, MWSDB and\nGovernment  officials.  Every  four  months,  MWSDB  will  submit  progress  reports  to  the\nGovernment and the external funding agencies.\n73. The consultants for the various project components (including the access roads, MDS,\nSUP, WTP, and BDS) will report to the PMU. The PMU will be responsible for preparing\ndisbursement projections and budgeting allocations for counterpart funds. Also reporting to the\nPMU will be a social and environmental monitoring unit. Two panels of experts will be used to\nsupplement consulting services provided under the construction supervision contracts and the\nPMU. Specific disciplines identified include hydraulics, geotechnical engineering and tunnel\ncontracting for the technical POE, and sociology, environmental management, and consensus\nbuilding and dispute resolution for the social and environmental POE. The POEs will visit twice\na year to examine and provide advice on specific issues and identify any potential issues. They\nwill report to the project director who will make the final decision on the event of any conflict\nbetween  any  of  the  consultants.  The  construction  supervision  consultants  for  the  various\ncomponents will provide monthly reports to the PMU.\n2. Implementation Schedule\n74. The Project is expected to be commissioned by September 2006. Tunnel and intake\ndesign and tendering will be completed in 2001. Access roads will be completed mid-2002.\nTunnel construction, which is on the critical path, will take about four and a half years including\nmobilization of the contractor. Construction of the WTP and BDS are expected to commence in\n2003, and each component will be completed simultaneously with the MDS to conduct a test run\noperation of the WTP. The private operator (PO) is expected to commence operations in\nJanuary 2002. The implementation schedule is given in Appendix 7.\n3. Procurement\n75. Procurement of goods and services financed by ADB will be done in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines on Procurement. Contracts for civil works estimated to cost more than $1.0\nmillion equivalent will be carried out using international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures\nwhile those contracts estimated to cost $1.0 million equivalent or less will be under local\ncompetitive bidding (LCB) procedures. To the extent possible, the procurement of goods will be\ngrouped into packages larger than $500,000 to be suitable for ICB procedures. Miscellaneous\nminor goods that cannot be grouped into larger contracts and cost less than $500,000 per\ncontract will be procured through international shopping (IS) procedures. Minor items, costing\nless  than  the  equivalent  of  $100,000  per  contract  may  be  purchased  directly.  Indicative\nprocurement packaging is shown in Appendix 8.", "18\n76. The MDS will be bid as three separate contracts, one for power lines, the second for the\nintake and part of the tunnel, and the third for the remainder of the tunnel. The second one will\nbe funded by ADB using ICB procedures. The BDS will be funded by ADB and will consist of\ntwo contracts for civil works (one for the north and the other for the south pipe-laying and\nreservoir construction); and three contracts for the supply of pipes, valves, (ICB procedures),\nand flowmeters (IS procedures). The main wastewater improvement procurement packages\n(under ICB procedures) will be for the supply and installation of interceptor sewers, and for the\nrehabilitation and extension of several wastewater treatment plants. Other smaller packages,\nsuch as for septage trucks, sewer cleaning equipment, public toilets, and the septage treatment\nplant  will  be  procured  under  IS  procedures.  The  procurement  of  vehicles  and  office  and\ncomputer equipment for the PMU will follow IS procedures. Supply of equipment and civil works\nfor the SUP will be through very small contracts and will follow LCB procedures encouraging the\nparticipation of local community-based organizations in association with local firms.\n77. Several external agencies will finance additional goods and services for the Project.  The\npart of the tunnel not covered by ADB financing and the power lines, will be financed by NORAD\nand Sida. It will follow NORAD and Sida procurement procedures. It will be competitively bid\namong Norwegian and Swedish consortia. The access roads will be bid as three contracts. The\nfirst two, adit access roads and public road upgrading, will be financed by the OPEC Fund using\nICB procedures in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Procurement. Construction of the main\naccess road will be financed by the Government using LCB procedures. The WTP will be bid as\none contract for civil works, including the supply and installation of mechanical and electrical\nequipment. It will follow ICB procedures in accordance with JBIC procurement guidelines. Four\ndistribution network improvement contracts to be financed by the World Bank will follow ICB\nprocedures in accordance with World Bank procurement guidelines. The specific packaging is\nexpected to include one contract for rehabilitation and one for the supply of pipes and fittings\nduring the first phase, and two additional contracts, during the second phase, one for civil works\nand one for pipes and fittings.\n4. Consulting Services\n78. The selection and engagement of all consulting services financed by ADB will be in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  and  other  arrangements\nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. A team of international and\ndomestic consultants, based at the PMU, will assist in implementing, managing and monitoring\nproject activities. A total input of 234 person-months of international consulting, and 846 person-\nmonths of domestic consulting is planned.\n79. For the BDS, only construction supervision consulting is needed. This includes 113\nperson-months of international consulting, and 750 person-months of domestic consulting. In\naccordance with ADB guidelines and subject to a satisfactorily negotiated contract, the BDS\ndesign consultants will be retained for construction supervision. The design and construction\nsupervision consulting for the wastewater improvements component will also be funded by ADB\nand  will  include  35  person-months  of  international  consulting  and  188  person-months  of\ndomestic consulting.\n80. The SUP will require 12 person-months of international consulting and 396 person-\nmonths of domestic consulting in addition to NGO inputs for the following components: buffer\nzone, health, education, income generation, and rural electrification. For the HEPP, an NGO will\nbe engaged for 132 person-months of domestic consulting services to prepare and implement a\npublic hygiene awareness project in Kathmandu Valley. The third-party monitoring agent, a\ncapable NGO, will provide 80 person-months of domestic consulting services to carry out\nexternal monitoring of implementation of the RAP and the environment management plan.  The\npublic awareness component will require 12 person-months of international consulting and 160", "19\nperson-months of domestic consulting. The training component will require 8 person-months of\ninternational consulting. For the POE, 60 person-months of international consulting is provided\nover the whole of the implementation period. Consulting services to be financed by ADB are\ngiven in Appendix 9.\n81. Additional consulting services will be financed by other external funding agencies. The\ndesign  and  construction  supervision  of  the  MDS  will  be  financed  by  NORAD  and  NDF,\nrespectively.  For  the  WTP,  design  and  construction  supervision  is  expected  to  include\napproximately  150  person-months  of  international  consulting,  and  600  person-months  of\ndomestic consulting and will be funded by JBIC. The PO will advise on the design of the\ndistribution improvements and the WTP where feasible.\n82. Activities supporting institutional development (as distinct from institutional reforms) have\nbeen incorporated in the Project. It will be the responsibility of all consulting teams to transfer\ntheir knowledge and skills to government counterpart staff and communities wherever possible\nthrough a structured training program as well as on the job training. Under the SUP, the\ninstitutional structure of the Local Governance Program will be used to build the capacity of\nDDCs and VDCs. The PO will be required to increase the skills of the utility staff.\n5. Advance Action\n83. Advance action has been approved for recruiting consultants for Project management\nand for procurement actions prior to bid evaluations including issuance of invitations to bid and\nprequalification of contractors for the construction of access roads.  Initial activities are under\nway.\n6. Operation and Maintenance\n84. The PO will be responsible for the O&M of all project facilities including the adit access\nroads. Processing is under way, and an action plan to effect award of contract by 30 September\n2001,  and  mobilization  by  January  2002,  has  been  agreed  to  by  World  Bank  and  the\nGovernment. The regulatory body will be established before a contract is awarded to the private\noperator. The Government is represented in the contract processing by the private sector\nparticipation committee. The World Bank has employed consultants to support the processing.\nCoordination is being maintained with both MWSDB and ADB. The PO's performance will be\nmonitored against predetermined targets related to achieving the objectives of the contract. The\nstated objectives of the lease contract and performance-related areas will include (i) reduction of\nphysical  and  commercial  losses,  (ii)  equitable  distribution  of  water  on  a  daily  basis,  (iii)\nmaintenance of computerized consumer accounts and management information systems, (iv)\nincrease in number of connections, (v) maximization of revenue collection, (vi) increase in public\nawareness of water use including hygiene, (vii) improvement of sanitation services, (viii) training\nof  personnel  involved  in  water  management,  (ix)  customer  service  performance  indicators\n(including hours of supply and water quality), and (x) mapping of the physical system.\n7. Disbursement Procedures\n85. The MWSDB will be responsible for preparing disbursement projections and requesting\nbudgetary allocations for counterpart funds. It will establish an imprest account for the Project.\nThe initial amount will be no more than a six-month projected disbursement. The imprest\naccount  will  be  established,  managed,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Loan\nDisbursement Handbook. The MWSDB will coordinate in the timely release of funds to the\ncontractors.", "20\n8. Reports, Accounts, and Audit\n86. The MWSDB, with assistance from the consultants, will submit project progress reports\nto ADB every four months in a format and detail acceptable to ADB. These reports will include\n(i) consolidation and analysis of monthly reports from the construction supervision consultants,\n(ii) project schedule, critical path activities, project accounts, commitments and disbursements,\nland acquisition, resettlement and compensation, and (iii) public relations activities. Annual\nmonitoring reports will also be submitted on social and environmental issues and groundwater.\nMWSDB will submit a project completion report to the Government and ADB within three\nmonths of physical completion of the Project. The report will  emphasize the development\nimpacts achieved.\n87. The MWSDB will set up the project accounts in accordance with Government guidelines.\nSeparate  accounts  will  be  maintained  for  each  external  funding  agency.  Accounts  will  be\nmaintained  on  the  basis  of  international  accounting  standards.  All  accounts,  including  the\nimprest  accounts  and  the  financial  statements  of  MWSDB,  will  be  audited  by  auditors\nacceptable to ADB. Assisted by the consultant, the PMU will prepare the required information\nfor audit in accordance with ADB's project auditing requirements. The project audit will be\ncarried out annually, and audited statements of project accounts and financial statements will be\nsubmitted to ADB within 12 months of the close of the Government's fiscal year.\n88. An audited annual report of the utility under the control of the PO will be submitted to\nADB no later than six months after the end of each fiscal year. The report will include the\ncomplete  and  audited  financial  statements  of  the  utility  in  accordance  with  international\naccounting standards.\n9. Monitoring and Evaluation\n89. MWSDB will finalize Project performance indicators and establish baseline conditions in\nconsultation with the POEs for the purposes of Project monitoring and evaluation (M&E). M&E\nindicators and procedures will be tested for data availability and other constraints, revised if\nnecessary,  and  institutionalized  in  the  MWSDB  and  MPPW,  which  shall  ultimately  be\nresponsible for maintaining the M&E systems. Indicative performance indicators will be agreed\nbetween MWSDB and ADB. The benefit monitoring and evaluation will also take due account of\nthe approaches and guidance provided under ADB's \"Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation: A\nHandbook for Bank Staff, Staff of the Executing Agencies and Consultants.\"\nH. Environmental and Social Measures\n1. Environment\n90. Measures to mitigate adverse environmental impacts have been incorporated in the\nproject design. The hydropower component was excluded on primarily environmental grounds.\nThese aspects include less water in the river at the intake site, more spoil to dispose of from the\ntunnel, longer access roads, transfer of large quantities of water from one river basin to another,\nand future development necessary inside a national park.\n91. The most critical environmental issue for the people of Melamchi Valley is the  amount of\nwater to be taken from the Melamchi River and whether it will affect current irrigation use. The\nwater withdrawal not only will not affect existing uses, but a guarantee will be provided that in\nthe dry season a minimum of 30 percent of natural flow will be left in the river. All of the water\nabstracted will be used after treatment for water supply purposes and will not be used for\nflushing the Bagmati River except in connection with the periodic cleaning of the tunnel. In\naddition, when water flows from the Melamchi Valley to the Kathmandu Valley a levy will be paid", "21\non all abstraction volumes as measured at the WTP by Kathmandu Valley water consumers to\nthe inhabitants of the Melamchi Valley via a mechanism which is to be agreed between the\nGovernment and the inhabitants. The levy will be used to fund activities determined by the\ninhabitants, and the continuation and maintenance of SUP activities.\n92. An approved environmental management plan will mitigate against construction impacts.\nConstruction  phase  impacts  will  be  controlled  by  appropriate  clauses  in  the  construction\ncontracts. In Melamchi Valley, this is expected to mitigate environmental impacts associated\nwith (i) cutting down of trees and wildlife hunting by the construction workforce, (ii) damage to\nthe water quality of local waterways, (iii) increased erosion, (iv) damage to rivers and fish due to\npoor spoil and topsoil management, (v) deterioration of air quality along haul roads and at\nconstruction  plant  sites,  and  (vi)  failure  to  rehabilitate  land  temporarily  occupied  by  the\ncontractor\u2019s facilities. Along the access roads and at adits, this will help mitigate environmental\nimpacts associated with slope stability and soil erosion. For the BDS, mitigation measures will\nbe similar to those in Melamchi Valley, but in addition several pipeline river crossings are\nprovided. Constructing bridges and inverted siphons will temporarily create conditions similar to\noperation of borrow areas in river beds.\n93. Construction supervision consultants will be responsible for ensuring that contractors\nfollow contract specifications, particularly for environmental mitigation. In addition, the Social\nand Environmental Division of the PMU will monitor compliance. A final check on compliance\nwith sound environmental practices will be made through an independent assessment by a\nsocial and environmental monitoring domestic NGO. The results of this assessment will be\nreported to ADB.\n94. During the operational phase, the main impact in Melamchi Valley will be on fish that live\nduring the dry season in the reaches of the Melamchi River immediately below the proposed\nintake. Over the long-term, the lower dry season flows may result in species more tolerant of\nlow-flow conditions displacing the current fish life. Environmental measures included in the SUP\ninclude (i) a catchment management and tourism promotion program, (ii) an environmental\nawareness  program  for  buffer  zone  residents,  and  (iii)  an  afforestation  program  with  the\nestablishment of forest-user groups and a cultural preservation program for one village. A by-\nproduct of the water treatment process is sludge. The designer of the WTP will liaise with the\nPO over environmentally acceptable methods of sludge disposal. Numerous large trees along\nthe pipeline route and in reservoir areas will have to be cut down. One reservoir and its supply\nand  delivery  pipelines  will  be  in  Gokarna  Forest  affecting  trees  there.  Wherever  feasible,\nreplacement  trees  will  be  planted  on  adjacent  land.  A  summary  environmental  impact\nassessment report was circulated to the ADB Board of Directors on 23 August 2000.\n2. Social\n95. The location and design of infrastructure has been carefully considered to minimize, if\nnot avoid, land acquisition and resettlement. Permanent land acquisition is expected for the\nMDS (main access road and access roads to adits), WTP, and BDS (reservoirs and pipeline\nroute),  the  distribution  network  (pipeline  route),  and  the  sewerage  system  improvements\namounting to about 131 ha, mostly agricultural land. Temporary land acquisition of 101 ha is\nalso expected for construction camps, borrow pits, and other construction-related activities.\nApproximately 98 structures of 91 households will be affected either partially or wholly, and\nabout 25 households will be displaced. To ensure smooth operation, the Government has\nagreed that no civil works contracts will be awarded until all land acquisition is complete. Some\ncommunity  facilities  and  common  property  resources  (irrigation  channel,  community  forest,\ncommunity hall) will also be affected. Loss of income directly due to the Project (e.g., loss of\ncrops and commercial business) will be compensated, and rehabilitation assistance will be\nprovided for severely affected persons. The RAP developed for the Project and its policy", "22\nframework were agreed to by MWSDB and ADB. The overall cost of the RAP is estimated at\n$15.8 million, of which $12.0 million is for land acquisition.  A summary RAP is in Appendix 10.\n96. The SUP will be implemented in Melamchi Valley to mitigate indirect adverse impacts. It\nwill  include  development  activities  covering:  buffer  zone  development,  rural  electrification,\nhealth, education, and income generation and community development. Women\u2019s special needs\nfor  reproductive  health,  adult  literacy,  skills  development  and  income  generation,  legal\nawareness raising, and antitrafficking measures (for women and girls) will also be addressed.\nTo ensure ownership and sustainability, the SUP will (i) take a participatory approach through\ncommunity mobilizers; (ii) utilize the institutional structure of the ongoing Local Governance\nProgram; and (iii) be sustained in the long term by levies paid by the water users in Kathmandu\nValley in the postconstruction stage (2007 and beyond).\n97. The Project has been prepared with extensive participation of stakeholders, including\nbeneficiaries, adversely affected people, VDCs and ward representatives, DDC and Municipality\nofficials and representatives, ministries concerned and MWSDB, the private sector, external\nfunding agencies, NGOs, and consultants. The Project will address the direct participation of\nbeneficiaries through (i) SUP implementation, (ii) representation of adversely affected people in\nthe  compensation  determination  committee,  and  (iii)  representation  of  Kathmandu  Valley\nbeneficiaries in a water users association. The Project will also undertake consensus building at\nall  levels  on  issues  such  as  water  services,  environmental  and  social  mitigation  and\ncompensation, and employment. For adversely affected communities in the Melamchi Valley,\nlocal consultative groups will be established in each affected wards and VDC. Prior to 31\nDecember 2001, a consultative committee will be established representing the inhabitants of the\nMelamchi  Valley  and  will  include  representatives  of  the  MWSDB  and  the  chairperson.\nMemoranda  of  understanding  will  be  signed  between  this  consultative  committee  and  the\nGovernment. To ensure that women's participation and gender concerns are fully addressed, a\ngender strategy will be developed and implemented. Apart from this, it has been agreed that at\nleast one of the members of the regulatory body will be female.\n98. Project preparation involved extensive consultations with NGOs. Their main concerns\nrelated to (i) volume of water extracted from the Melamchi River, (ii) privatization of water\nsupplies, (iii) prospective tariffs, (iv) transparency of and access to information, (v) explanation\nof  assurances  sought  by  external  agencies,  and  (vi)  involvement  in  the  dissemination  of\ninformation. NGOs will be included in the consensus building activity between the Government\nand Melamchi Valley residents. The assurances provided by the Government will be explained\non  the  project  web-site.  They  will  also  be  employed  in  the  public  relations  contract  for\ndissemination of information about the Project. Overall, they will form the backbone of SUP\nimplementation in Melamchi Valley.\n99. HEPP will be one of the most important social measures to be taken by the Project for\npeople  living  in  Kathmandu  Valley.  The  greatest  need  is  now,  before  the  Project  is\ncommissioned. Initially a pilot program will be developed; to be upscaled when proven effective.\nWithin six months of the award of the contract, the Government will ensure that this program will\nbe taken over by the PO of the water supplies.\n100. Special measures are being taken to ensure that the introduction of the private operation\nof the water supplies will especially benefit the poor. These include access to good quality\nbottled  water,  assured  connections  to  piped  water  (where  the  cost  of  the  connection  is\nrecovered over time through the tariff), targeted hygiene education and promotion programs,\nand  an  affordable  tariff  based  on  basic  needs  consumption  and  targeted  environmental\nsanitation improvements. Women\u2019s participation will be highlighted, especially in the formation\nof  water  users  groups.  Equitable  distribution  of  water  will  be  one  of  the  PO  measurable", "23\nperformance targets. The PO will not be allowed to sell bulk water to a third party who sells the\nwater at a price higher than the PO's average tariff imposed for piped water.\n101. To  support  the  introduction  of  privately  operated  water  supplies,  a  public\nawareness/relations unit will be established in the PMU. This unit will ensure that stakeholders\nare kept informed about the Project and are given an opportunity to express their views. The\npublic relations program will be a proactive campaign that will identify any potential conflict area\nat an early stage, assist in consensus building between the Project and the local communities,\nand manage public expectations on compensation and the SUP.\nV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n102. The  Project  will  provide  a  least-cost  solution  to  mitigate  the  socioeconomic  stress\ncaused by the inadequate supply of safe water on Kathmandu Valley residents by optimizing\nwater use in the valley as well as developing new water sources outside the valley. This will\nbenefit  180,000  households  in  the  valley  by  improving  water  supply  services,  in  terms  of\nquantity, quality, and timeliness of supply, as well as more equitable distribution. About 20\npercent of these households live in poverty, with incomes less than NRs6,000 per month. The\nimpact ratio for the poor has been estimated to be four times that for the not-so-poor. The\nProject will also provide socioeconomic benefits to about 40,000 residents of Melamchi Valley\nby increasing incomes from improved access and expanded markets, reduced workload for\nwomen, better education for children, and reduced incidence of trafficking of women.  These\nbenefits have not been quantified and, to that extent, the economic benefits are understated.\nA.  Financial and Economic Analyses\n1. Financial Analysis\n  a. Supply and Demand\n103. Water supply projections assume that in the preproject period, supply may increase as a\nresult of a gradual reduction of losses, and rehabilitation or expansion of groundwater and\nsurface water sources. Projections of demand assume a population of 1.5 million in Kathmandu\nValley in 2000, and a growth rate of 4 percent from 2001 falling to 2.8 percent in 2016 and\nthereafter.  Utilization of Melamchi water is expected to be about 73 percent in 2007, and\napproach 100 percent by 2011.  Accordingly, about 80 percent of the population will be served\nupon  commissioning  of  the  Project,  rising  to  about  95  percent  in  2016.    With  careful\nmanagement and relocation of key industries out of the valley, further investments may be\ndeferred.\nb. Cost Recovery Policy and Assumptions\n104. During the preproject period, average tariffs are expected to rise from NRs6.9/m3 in 2000\nto NRs12.8/m3 in 2006 (in 2000 prices) to meet cash O&M costs as well as private operator and\nregulatory costs. The financial projections assume (i) improved collection efficiency; (ii) metered\nstandpipes charged at the lifeline rate; (iii) users meeting payment obligations; (iv) groundwater\ncharges for nondomestic consumers; and (v) wastewater charged as a 50 percent surcharge on\nthe water tariff. Post-Project, average tariffs will be NRs23.0/m3 by 2008, adequate to cover\nO&M,  debt  servicing,  regulatory,  and  private  operator  costs.  All  nondomestic  use  of\ngroundwater is assumed to cease by 2008.\nc. Affordability and Willingness-to-Pay\n105. For low-income households consuming 60 lpcpd (or 9.2 m3 per month), Kathmandu\nValley water tariffs as a percentage of household income are expected to increase from 0.7", "24\npercent in 2000 to 1.1 percent in 2006, and 1.9 percent by 2009 and onward. Where a low-\nincome household is also connected to the sewerage system, affordability peaks at 2.8 percent\nin  2008.    For  median-income  households  consuming  125  lpcpd  (or  19.1  m3  per  month),\naffordability is expected to rise from 1.2 percent of household income in 2000 to 1.9 percent in\n2006, and 3.2 percent in 2009 and onward. This is equivalent to NRs550 per month per\nhousehold. Where such households are also connected to the sewerage system, tariffs will rise\nfrom  1.8  percent  in  2000  to  2.8  percent  in  2006,  and  4.8  percent  in  2008  and  onward.\nCommercial consumers will be charged the same as domestic consumers, but consumption\nover 30 m3 per month will attract the highest tariff level of NRs77 per m3 in 2009 and may be\ncompared with the average incremental financial cost tariff of NRs88 per m3. A recent survey\nshows 90 percent of households are willing to pay NRs500 per month for a 24-hour supply of\npiped potable water. This compares with a current average of NRs150 per month.  On average,\nless than 5 percent of disposable household income will be spent on water; this is in line with\ncurrent global norms.\nd. Financial Internal Rate of Return\n106. The overall financial internal rate of return for the Project is 4.7 percent. This may be\ncompared with a weighted average cost of capital for the Project of 0 percent, where the\nonlending rate is 8 percent and domestic inflation is 8 percent resulting in a real interest rate of\n0 percent. Similar to other urban water supply projects, the financial internal rate of return\nshowed sensitivity to increases in capital costs and revenues. A summary of financial analysis is\nprovided in Appendix 11; details are available in Supplementary Appendix A.\ne. Financial Performance of NWSC\n107. Over the past five years, the financial performance of NWSC has been poor due to high\nwater losses, poor service, low tariffs, and low collection efficiencies. Accounts receivable have\nrisen to 311 days equivalent of sales in 2000.  Consequently, NWSC has only been able to\nmaintain a positive cash flow by deferring debt service payments to the Government.  At the\ncurrent levels of net profit and operating losses, NWSC will not be able to meet any ongoing\ncapital expenditure out of retained earnings.\n108. NWSC\u2019s poor financial performance has led to the proposal to engage a private operator\nto manage water supply and sewerage systems in Kathmandu Valley. This is expected to result\nin improved operational performance and a reduction in water losses and improved collection\nefficiencies. Financial projections and assumptions for water supplies in the valley are set out in\nSupplementary Appendix A.\n2.  Economic Analysis\na. With and Without the Project\n109. The without-project option offers a very bleak scenario for Kathmandu Valley. Since\nNWSC would be unable to meet demand, piped water delivery would continue to be limited to\nless than 2 hours every two days, pressures and water quality would be poor, and inequality\nwould persist for water distribution. Therefore, the economic price of water would rise from\nNRs40/m3 currently to NRs110/m3 in 2012.\n110. A number of alternative options, including in-valley storages were considered, but were\nfound to be impractical because of various shortcomings, such as high financial and social\ncosts, low yield, and other problems associated with population density and land use. The\nproposed design involves a low-level tunnel, no impoundment storage, and no hydropower, and\nwas considered a least-cost and least environmentally disruptive option. Furthermore, it retains", "25\nthe option for low-cost gravity expansion of supply from the Yangri and Larke rivers and in-\nvalley storage in the future.\nb. Economic Benefits\n111. The project benefits accrue from (i) the saving of time and cost in fetching, carrying,\npumping, purchasing, storing, and treating water; (ii) reduced risk of health problems; and (iii)\nreduced overexploitation of groundwater.  Additional benefits accrue from the increased supply\nof water available. The economic analysis uses demand curves and associated income and\nprice parameters to evaluate annual nonincremental and incremental benefits. The approach\ninternalizes the benefits associated with health, welfare, and convenience.\nc. Economic Internal Rate of Return\n112. The economic evaluation assumes base economic costs of $322 million and incremental\nO&M costs at 1 percent of total costs plus $0.04/m3 of water production. A standard conversion\nfactor of 0.9 is assumed. Total costs are high because of the need to provide a sound basis for\nfuture expansion. Benefits are estimated at NRs1,500 million/year initially and increase to about\nNRs6,000 million/year in subsequent years.\n113. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Project (with 170 MLD capacity) is\n13.5 percent, while the EIRR for the full development is 15.3 percent. The EIRR was tested for\nsensitivity to tariff levels, water losses, income growth, nondomestic tariffs, and capital costs.\nThe EIRR is estimated to be 10.1 percent at the current water loss figure of 40 percent, 11.9\npercent with real income growth reduced to 1 percent per year, 12.9 percent with a 50 percent\ndecrease in the nondomestic tariffs, and 12.6 percent with a 10 percent increase in capital\ncosts. A summary of the economic analysis is provided in Appendix 11; details are available in\nSupplementary Appendix B.\nd. Tariffs\n114. The principles of a tariff policy were developed by the Government and incorporated in\nthe water supply and wastewater sector strategy for the Kathmandu Valley (Appendix 2). The\ntariff will build on the principles of demand management, cost recovery, services to the poor,\nand easy payment of water bills. It will be aimed at the staged recovery of all O&M costs,\nregulatory fees, debt servicing needs, levy for water abstraction from Melamchi River, and a\nportion of future investments. The tariffs will be maintained in real terms by periodically adjusting\nfor inflation. Commercial groundwater abstraction will be licensed and metered and charged\nvolumetrically. Based on these principles, and on the results of ongoing studies supported by\nthe World Bank, the Government is expected to determine an appropriate tariff structure for\nKathmandu Valley early in 2001.\ne. Subsidies\n115. While the Government has agreed to phase in full cost recovery in financial terms for the\nwater supplies in Kathmandu by 2010, some subsidies will be provided in the interim. These\ninclude (i) funds to develop the Project that will be passed on to the utility in an equal mix of\ngrant and loan; (ii) subsidy for all capital works for wastewater improvements; (iii) subsidy to\nusers of groundwater; (iv) subsidy provided to farmers who use current water resources for\nirrigation; (v) subsidy provided to industries that pollute the waterways and environment to\nenable them to convert to clean technologies; (vi) cross-subsidy provided by other water users\nto the urban poor to ensure equitable access to water; and (vii) subsidy provided to the PO for\nthe first three years. Subsidies related to the Project and wastewater improvements are in line\nwith those currently provided elsewhere in Asia.  All subsidies will be phased out during the", "26\nproject period except for the two relating to wastewater improvements and the cross-subsidy\nprovided by other water users. These can be supported because the full cost recovery of\nwastewater tariffs is not expected to be achievable at affordable tariffs. Cross-subsidy of the\nurban poor through a lifeline block for a minimum quantity of water is also supportable on the\ngrounds that it ensures that health and related sanitation benefits are available to the whole\ncommunity. These costs result in public benefits that arise from reduced health care-related\ncosts and fewer work days lost due to ill health from water-borne diseases.\nB. Environment\n1.  Physical Environment\n116. Access roads, transmission lines, and construction camps will be built. Potential road\ngrade and affected area instability will be improved by reducing the slopes of embankments,\nuse of upslope and downslope gabions, proper drainage, and stabilization by grass planting.\nRoad construction, spoil disposal, and borrow material sites have been identified and tested,\nand  locally  required  smaller  ones  will  be  confirmed  during  detailed  road  design.  Road\nconstruction spoil will not be dumped along the roadside or into rivers or ravines. If the local\npeople require fill materials, they will be permitted to take road spoil on a \"take-for-free\" basis.\nAfter MDS construction, the main access and adit roads will improve access to the upland and\nnear-river  areas  along  the  Melamchi  River  with  an  estimated  2,000  households  benefiting\ndirectly or indirectly. Likewise, tunnel spoil will also be made available to the local people for use\nas road or track fill, fencing, house foundations, and walls.\n117. Upon completion, the MDS will divert 2 m3/sec of water from the Melamchi River to the\nWTP. In the dry season from February to April, approximately 55 percent of the Melamchi River\nflow, upstream of the first major irrigation intake, will be diverted leaving about 45 percent as\nresidual flow. During the rest of the year, a much larger percentage of environmental flows will\nbe retained in the Melamchi River. This is particularly important for the May-June and October-\nNovember periods when fish migration occurs. All existing water demands for the Melamchi\nRiver for irrigation, water mills, and domestic purposes can be met safely on a year-round basis.\n118. The BDS and distribution network will be constructed within the semiurban and urban\nareas  of  Kathmandu  Valley.  Trenches  will  be  dug  along  road  rights-of-way  and  across\nintervening sections of mainly agricultural land. All reservoir construction will be located on\neither rural or semiurban open land.\n2. Biological Environment\n119. The number of trees to be cut due to the construction of the various adit access roads,\nportal and spoil disposal sites, and borrow areas has yet to be determined in detail due to\nalterations to MDS configuration. Most of the trees affected are located in degraded community\nforests. Once road centerlines and construction works area boundaries are determined by the\nupdating studies on the MDS, all affected trees whether on private or public property will be\nproperly inventoried, and owners compensated. Any replacement afforestation required by the\nDepartment of Forestry will be negotiated and implemented during the construction phase as\nmitigation. Of note, several ongoing community forest use groups are operating with bilateral\nand NGO assistance in the Melamchi area; they will be used, as appropriate, to implement\nforestry-related mitigation.\n120. The  operation  of  the  Melamchi  diversion  weir  will  only  marginally  affect  the  fish\npopulation. Long and middle distance fish migration does not occur in the Melamchi River\nupstream of the Timbu River because of the presence of natural barriers. Reductions in water\nflow will occur between the intake and the confluence of the Indrawati River, but residual flows", "27\nin the critical periods for fish breeding in the main areas will be adequate to maintain suitable\nhabitats  similar  to  existing  ones.  Under  the  Project,  a  river,  water  use,  and  fisheries\nmanagement program will be designed and implemented, involving local user groups including\nirrigators, water-mill owners, fisherfolk, and local community-based organizations.\n121. Approximately 40 trees will be removed from the agricultural land to be cleared for the\nWTP. However, a riverbank buffer zone is proposed for the east bank of the Bagmati River and\nwill be planted with trees. In addition the WTP site boundary zone will be landscaped with larger\ntrees, as both aesthetic and noise buffering mitigation.\n122. Construction of the BDS will require numerous nonindigenous trees to be cut, most are\neither poplars or eucalyptus along the Ring Road and other public road rights-of-way. In several\nlocations affected by the BDS pipelines, these fast-growing species are causing problems due\nto wind breakage with resulting damage to frontage road properties, so their removal and\nreplacement with more suitable species will be locally acceptable. Tree cutting at the reservoir\nsites will be limited. To mitigate this impact, the Project will replace all trees as required by, and\nas agreed with, the relevant authorities such as the Department of Roads, DDCs, VDCs, or\ncommunity-based organizations involved in their establishment and maintenance, as some\nareas are indicated to be under \"locally sponsored projects.\" An assessment of environmental\nimpacts and mitigation measures is in Appendix 12.\nC. Social Dimensions\n123. Kathmandu Valley. The primary beneficiaries of the Project are 1.5 million people\n(180,000 households) in Kathmandu Valley (1.25 million direct beneficiaries and 0.25 million\nindirect). Improved water supply services with better water quality, more water (and reduced\nunaccounted  for  water)  and  timely  supply,  extended  service  areas,  more  equitable  water\ndistribution, and better customer services will benefit them through (i) reduced anxiety about the\nunreliable water supply; (ii) improved health by reducing water-related diseases and better\nhygiene practices, especially for children; (iii) reduced burden, time saved, and cost of water\ncollection, storage, and boiling and other treatment of water, especially for women and female\nchildren; (iv) more safety for women in water collection as night-time water collection is not\nnecessary; and (v) reduced burden and time saved to deal with service agents. Such benefits\nonly materialize if the better water supply services go hand in hand with increased public health,\nhygiene and environmental awareness, and improved sanitation facilities and maintenance.\nOverall, these benefits will also have a significant positive impact on the next generation and the\nrest of the country as the Kathmandu Valley case sets a good practice model. The issue of the\npotential negative impact of the raised water tariff on low-income households will be addressed\nthrough an equitable tariff structure under the privately operated facilities.\n124. Melamchi Valley.  Several socioeconomic and poverty reduction benefits will accrue to\nthe population (40,000) in the 14 VDCs in Melamchi Valley through the project infrastructure\nconstruction  and  the  SUP.  These  include  (i)  improved  access  to  Kathmandu  and  within\nMelamchi Valley using the access roads; (ii) increased incomes from the expanded market and\nupgraded skills; (iii) availability of electric power; (iv) reduced workload for women; (v) increased\ngender awareness in the community; (vi) increased adult literacy rates; (vii) better educated\nchildren; (viii) greater health and family planning awareness and improved health conditions,\nespecially for women and children; and (ix) reduced incidence in trafficking of girls. A full\nassessment of the social dimensions of the Project is given in Appendix 13.\n125. Resettlement and Land Acquisition. Some direct adverse social impacts are also\nenvisaged  (see  SEIA  for  environmental  aspects)  and  adequate  mitigation  measures  and\ngrievance  mechanisms,  based  on  consultations  with  the  affected  population,  are  in  place.\nPotential indirect adverse social impacts could include (i) social disruption caused by the influx", "28\nof outside workers, including sexually transmitted diseases; (ii) loss of employment or income\ndue to changes in the economic structures; (iii) increased trafficking of women and girls, and (iv)\nincreased child labor. These will be addressed through the SUP.  An antichild labor clause will\nbe included in the contract document. No specific ethnic or caste groups will be especially\nadversely affected, but the vulnerable groups (e.g., severely affected persons, households\nheaded by women) have been identified for special assistance.\nD. Impact on Poverty\n126. Socioeconomic surveys conducted during project preparation suggest that about 20\npercent of households in Kathmandu Valley live in poverty, with incomes less than NRs6,000\nper month. The major project benefits are savings and incremental benefits accruing to water\nusers and to the economy, from the improved water supply and management. An examination\nof the demand curves indicates that the net benefit accruing to a poor household (benefit less\ntariff paid) is about the same as that accruing to a not-so-poor household, but the composition of\nthe benefits is different. The poor household has a small absolute savings benefit and a large\nabsolute incremental benefit.  Assuming a single rate tariff, the distribution of the net benefits to\nconsumers is about equal to the distribution of the population. However, the relative impact on\nthe poor is better, with impact ratios of net benefit over income estimated at 1.6 for the poor and\n0.4 for the not-so-poor.  Assuming a stepped tariff structure, the impact ratio for the poor\nincreases to 1.8, while that for the not-so-poor decreases to 0.3.\nE. Risks\n127. ADB staff assessed the main Project risk as follows: One of the main risks is lack of\ncommunity support. If the community is not kept adequately informed of project intentions,\nactivities, and progress, work may be disrupted. Compensation expectations in Melamchi Valley\nwill need to be managed sensitively. To address this risk, numerous public consultations have\nalready been held. In the PMU, a special social and environmental division is being established.\nConsensus-building activities will be conducted under the guidance of a dispute resolution\nexpert.\n128. A significant amount of land must be acquired in the Melamchi and Kathmandu valleys.\nDelays are possible and resettlement may be problematic. However, the RAP was prepared and\nthe census survey, already under way, will be completed once the exact location and design of\nthe project infrastructure is known. A clear grievance procedure has been established and\nadvertised. The Government has also agreed to complete land acquisition before awarding any\ncivil works contracts.\n129. Hydrological data on the Melamchi Khola spans a relatively short period. During the dry\nseason, the stream may not be able to consistently supply the design flow of water and still\nmaintain residual flows. To address this aspect, methods to optimize water use in Kathmandu\nValley will be studied in 2001. Conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water is also\nproposed.\n130. The private operator must be allowed to function in an environment that is free of\npolitical pressures; and to determine its own staffing, tariffs, and operational system. Otherwise,\nthe  existing  unsatisfactory  state  of  water  supply  could  continue.  The  establishment  of  a\nregulatory body will greatly minimize this risk. However, if interference still occurs, future support\nfrom the World Bank for the distribution network improvements will be jeopardized, as indeed\nwill further ADB funding.\n131. A team of international consultants also undertook a risk analysis of the Project during\nNovember 2000. The approach used was a structured method for risk management which", "29\nrecognizes uncertainties as representing both risks as well as opportunities. The focus was on\ncost  and  time  schedule.  For  the  cost  element,  the  main  uncertainties  identified  were  (i)\ndistribution of water, (ii) quality of project management, (iii) rock conditions in the tunnel, (iv) the\nlimited preparation stages for some components, and (v) the market conditions for bidding\ncontracts. The consultants concluded that as against the current cost estimate ($464 million) the\nmost likely cost was $494 million. For the time element, the main uncertainties identified were (i)\nrock conditions in the tunnel, (ii) local people involvement, (iii) distribution of water, and (iv)\nstrong project management. The consultants concluded as against the current projection of 70\nmonths that the most likely time for completion would be 86 months.\n132. It was recommended that sharper focus be given to the strategic objective of the Project\nas a whole as well as the individual component objectives and targets. Special attention must\nbe given to the geological conditions, project management, the distribution system and people's\nparticipation.  It  is  necessary  to  closely  monitor  developments  effecting  expenditure  and\nprogress. Contingency plans need to be in place to cater for cost over-runs and delay in project\nimplementation. Risk analysis and management should be seen as an on-going activity. These\nrecommendations will be addressed through more investigation drilling, the terms of reference\nof the PMU, the ADB's Project Administration Memorandum, loan review missions and the visits\nof the POEs.\nVI. ASSURANCES\nA. Specific Assurances\n133. The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents.\n(i) The Government will within six months of loan effectiveness, or a date otherwise\nagreed  by  ADB,  ensure  that  the  recent  amendments  to  the  NWSC  Act  are\npromulgated.\n(ii) The  Government  will,  within  six  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  or  at  a  date\notherwise agreed by ADB, ensure that the Drinking Water Supply Act and/or\nother relevant legislation has been promulgated or amended to establish an\nenabling environment for the private operator to operate the leased assets, bill\nand collect water charges, withdraw service from defaulters, and be insulated\nfrom external interference.\n(iii) The  Government  will,  within  12  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  or  at  a  date\notherwise  agreed  by  ADB,  obtain  a  grant  of  about  $18  million  from  the\nGovernment of Japan, or equivalent funds from other sources.\n(iv) The  Government  will  obtain  a  second  IDA  credit  of  about  $65  million,  or\nequivalent funds from other sources, by 30 June 2004.\n(v) The Government will approve a policy on groundwater abstraction, monitoring,\nand licensing in Kathmandu Valley, satisfactory to ADB, by 31 December 2001.\n(vi) The Government will approve and the MPPW publicly notify the approval of the\nKathmandu Valley urban development sector strategy by 31 December 2001.\nThe Government will formulate and begin to implement land use planning and\ncontrols in Kathmandu Valley by 31 December 2003.", "30\n(vii) The Government will approve and the MPPW publicly notify the approval of the\npolicy on a Kathmandu Valley levy for Melamchi Valley by 31 December 2001.\nThe  Government  will  ensure  by  31  December  2002,  that  legislation  will  be\nenacted  to  require  the  payment  of  a  levy  by  the  water  consumers  of  the\nKathmandu Valley to the inhabitants of Melamchi, Yangri and Larke valleys for\nthe payment of water taken from those valleys.\n(viii) The  Government  will  designate  MWSDB  as  the  Implementing  Agency  and\nensure that it effectively carries out its responsibilities.

Background\n1. The  acute  drinking  water  shortage  situation  in  Kathmandu  Valley  is  a  result  of\ndeficiencies  in  sources,  weaknesses  in  system  capacity,  and  inadequate  management\nefficiency. To achieve efficient, effective, and equitable service delivery short and long-term\nstrategies must be developed, specific to Kathmandu Valley, in areas related to\n(i) effective sector planning and continued infrastructure improvement\u2014to manage\ndemand and augment system capacity;\n(ii) establishing  a  nonconflicting  and  nonoverlapping  institutional  setup\u2014to\ncontribute to improved organizational autonomy and organizational efficiency;\n(iii) enacting  service  delivery  standards  defining  acceptable  service  levels\u2014to\npromote equitable supply of potable water, easy access, continuity, and reliability\nat affordable prices;\n(iv) legal framework\u2014to create an enabling environment in the sector and for the\nservice operator;\n(v) cost recovery and tariff structure\u2014to achieve long-term financial sustainability of\nthe  sector  with  simple  mechanisms  for  tariff  administration  and  within  the\naffordable limits of various consumer segments;\n(vi) access to services for financially disadvantaged groups; and\n(vii) transparency and consultation with consumers.\n2. These strategies will be in accordance with the broader National Water Supply and\nSanitation Sector Policy, 1998.\nB. National Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Policy\n3. Decentralization of services and utility management; users involvement; private sector\nparticipation in management and development of utilities; implementation of an appropriate cost\nrecovery mechanism; and formulation of necessary acts, rules, and regulations, etc. are the\nmajor highlights of the National Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Policy, 1998. The sector\npolicy fully supports the current plan of establishing a private operator for the operation and\nmaintenance of the Kathmandu Valley water supply system and a regulatory organization to\nmonitor the operator.\nC. Objectives\n4. Development and long-term sustainability of adequate and affordable water supply and\nsanitation services for Kathmandu Valley are the main objectives of this strategy.\nD. Strategies\n1. Sector Planning and Infrastructure Improvement\na. Water Demand Management\n5. A water use optimization study will be conducted for Kathmandu Valley in 2001. This will\nrefine the analysis related to population, migration, use of sources, and water demand. It will\nalso explore possibilities of demand management through rainwater harvesting, wet season\nstorage, recycling of wastewater, trading of water rights, public awareness, etc., and analyze the\ninvestment timings for the Yangri and Larke diversions. The study will establish a dynamic", "38\nAppendix 2, page 2\ncomputer-based model for monitoring the water resources and their use against the population\nand  demand  changes.  The  demand  management  strategy  will  analyze  technical,  social,\neconomic, financial and institutional aspects of various alternatives, to set priorities and describe\ntheir sequencing and implementation. They include\n(i) conjunctive use of surface and groundwater sources, to ensure sustainability of\nyield from groundwater sources;\n(ii) interbasin transfer of water from surrounding areas, which comprise the diversion\nof Melamchi, Yangri, and Larke rivers of the Indrawati basin; the first phase of\nthis program, which involves diversion of about 170 million liters of water per day\nfrom the Melamchi River is expected to be commissioned in 2006;\n(iii) reduced system losses;\n(iv) optimizing water use by increasing public awareness as well as appropriate\npricing for domestic, industrial, and commercial uses and volumetric pricing of\nconsumption;\n(v) nonconventional measures like relocation of water from agriculture to urban use,\nrainwater harvesting at the household and community level, wet season storage,\nwastewater recycling; and\n(vi) effective enactment of economic and regulatory instruments to manage industrial\nwater demand and water pollution abatement, as well as to provide incentives for\nrelocating water intensive and water polluting industries outside of Kathmandu\nvalley.\nb. Groundwater Management\n6. The groundwater use in Kathmandu valley will be primarily conjunctive with surface\nwater use. After considerable augmentation of the public water supply by surface source is\nrealized to meet the demand in the post-Melamchi period, an abstraction ceiling for groundwater\nwill be defined and abstraction permits issued only within this ceiling.\n7. A monitoring system will be developed to properly monitor the abstraction, the water\ntable,  and  the  water  quality  in  both  shallow  aquifers  and  deep  aquifers.  All  deep  aquifer\nextractions and commercial extractions from shallow aquifers will be licensed, metered, and\ncharged. A driller\u2019s license will be introduced in 2002 to regulate drilling practices.\nc. Sanitation Services\n8. Activities will include the following:\n(i) The number and capacity of the existing treatment plants will be increased, and\nthe laying and extension of interceptors, collector mains, and collector laterals\nwill be undertaken in a phased manner.\n(ii) Onsite systems and treatment plants employing natural treatment technology will\nbe promoted at community levels in peri-urban areas, possibly coupled with small\nbore community sewers, to intercept the wastewater near the origin.\n(iii) Industries will be required to install pretreatment units. The quality and quantity of\neffluent  and  sludge  discharges  to  land  and  natural  watercourses  will  be\nmonitored against predefined standards.\n(iv) Public  toilets  will  be  promoted  with  due  care  in  maintenance.  Municipalities\nconcerned will participate actively in the provision and maintenance of such\nservices. Private sector participation will be encouraged in managing collection,\ntreatment,  and  disposal  of  on-site  system  sludge  and  in  construction  and\nmaintenance of public toilets.", "39\nAppendix 2, page 3\n(v) Public  awareness  campaigns  will  be  undertaken  for  water  conservation  and\nhygiene education.\n2. Service Delivery Standards\n9. Service delivery levels will be continuously upgraded to attain increased coverage of 24-\nhour  potable  piped  water  supply  under  adequate  pressure.  Individual  connections  will  be\npromoted to allow increased access to services. National water quality standards will be defined\nand  enacted  by  2002.  In  the  post-Melamchi  period  these  will  be  considered  mandatory\nstandards  and  an  adequate  monitoring  and  surveillance  mechanism  will  be  developed  to\nmonitor compliance by the operator with these standards.\n10. The operator will be required to publish annual operations report for the public review\nand will be specifically monitored against service delivery indicators including\n(i) reduction of physical and commercial water losses,\n(ii) equitable distribution of water,\n(iii) maintenance of computerized consumer accounts,\n(iv) increase in number of connections,\n(v) maximization of revenue collection,\n(vi) increase in public awareness,\n(vii) improvement of sanitation services,\n(viii) training of personnel,\n(ix) customer service performance indicators, and\n(x) mapping of the physical system.\n11. Discharge standards will be defined and monitored for industrial discharges. The quality\nand  quantity  of  effluent  and  sludge  discharges  to  land  and  natural  watercourses  will  be\nmonitored.  Appropriate  and  cost-effective  technology  will  be  promoted,  such  as  sewerage\nsystems in dense urban areas and on-site systems and small-bore community sewers coupled\nwith natural treatment technologies in peri-urban and other low-density areas.\n3. Institutional Framework Reorganization\n12. The present institutional framework will be revisited to clarify and separate the policy\nformulation, planning, service provision, and regulatory functions in the water sector, with the\naim of improving coordination and organizational efficiency, which will be measured against\nexplicitly defined performance indicators. A comprehensive study will be undertaken in 2001.\nThe  proposed  framework  will  incorporate  organizational  autonomy  and  will  be  allowed  to\noperate  under  appropriate  incentive  regimes.  Responsibilities  of  each  organization  will  be\nclearly delineated to avoid duplication and conflict in work spheres.\n13. An enabling environment will be created to allow the management of the water and\nsanitation services through a private operator. Required legislative reforms will be undertaken to\nprovide the operator with required autonomy for operating the system, billing and collecting\nwater charges, withdrawing services from defaulters, and insulation from external interference.\na. Ministry of Physical Planning and Works\n14. The Ministry of Physical Planning and Works (MPPW) will be the central agency for\ncoordination, policy formulation, standard-setting, and monitoring at the national level. The\nproposed study will define the appropriate asset-holding organization, and MPPW will assume\nthe asset-holding function until an organization as prescribed by the study is set up.", "40\nAppendix 2, page 4\nb. Kathmandu Valley Water Authority\n15. An independent and autonomous Kathmandu Valley Water Authority (KVWA) will be\nestablished.  The  KVWA  board  will  primarily  be  constituted  with  local  government\nrepresentatives and some line ministry representatives. It will be responsible for comprehensive\nwater resources management, including allocation, use, and protection of water resources, and\nthe introduction of river basin management approaches in Kathmandu Valley. The proposed\ninstitutional  study  will  define  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  KVWA  as  a  planning,\nimplementing,  monitoring,  and  management  agency,  but  not  an  operating  agency.  It  will\nmaintain a small professional staff and let contracts to consultants for related works.\nc. Private Operator\n16. The frontline operation and management of the water and wastewater services in the\nurban areas of Kathmandu Valley will be contracted to a private operator, on the basis of\ncompetitive bidding as a lease contract, initially for 10 years starting 2001.  The contract will be\ncontinued  as  a  lease  or  extended  as  a  concession  contract  after  this  period  through  a\ncompetitive bidding process.\n17. The private operator will act as an implementing agency to undertake rehabilitation and\nimprovements  related  to  the  production  and  distribution  of  drinking  water  and  wastewater\ndisposal in Kathmandu Valley. The Melamchi water supply system from source to consumer will\nbe operated and maintained by the operator after its commissioning.\nd. National Water Supply Regulatory Body\n18. A national water regulatory body (NWRB) will be established, prior to the award of the\nlease contract, to protect the consumer interests and monitor the performance of the operator\nagainst set performance indicators. The NWRB will monitor contract compliance by the private\noperator and will approve the tariff adjustments in accordance with the predefined tariff policy of\nthe Government. It will also annually undertake consumer surveys and publicize the results. The\nNWRB will initially be established to monitor the Kathmandu Valley supply, but it may expand its\nactivities to regulate other water supply and sanitation systems in the country.\n4. Legal Framework\n19. Legal frameworks will be enacted for\n(i) private  sector  management  of  drinking  water  and  wastewater  services  and\nutilities;\n(ii) establishment and functioning of KVWA;\n(iii) establishment and functioning of NWRB;\n(iv) definition, monitoring, and surveillance of standards of drinking water quality,\ngroundwater quality, and wastewater discharges;\n(v) licensing and charging of groundwater abstractions; and\n(vi) payment of a levy by the water consumers of Kathmandu Valley to the peoples of\nMelamchi, Yangri, and Larke valleys for the use of their water.\n5. Cost Recovery and Tariff\n20. To  allow  public  transparency  in  tariffs  and  to  minimize  the  use  of  discretion,  the\nGovernment will announce a tariff policy, to define the terms for setting the tariffs.  The tariff", "41\nAppendix 2, page 5\npolicy will build in the principles of (i) demand management, (ii) cost recovery, (iii) services to\nthe poor, and (iv) easy payment of water bills:\n(i) The tariff structure for water supply will, on commissioning of the Melamchi water\nsupply project, be based on recovering all operation and maintenance costs and\ndebt  service.  By  2010,  it  will  cover  all  operation  and  maintenance  costs,\nregulatory fees, debt servicing needs, any levy to be paid for water abstraction,\nand a portion of the future investments. The tariff policy will adopt full metering\nand volumetric pricing concepts with due considerations to the welfare of the\nurban poor.\n(ii) The capital investments for Melamchi will be calculated for recovery on the basis\nof 50 percent loan and 50 percent grant ratio.\n(iii) Tariffs for nondomestic uses will be charged at uniform rates on volumetric basis\nof consumption and will take into account the costs of alternatives.\n(iv) Nondomestic  groundwater  abstraction  will  be  licensed  and  metered,  and\nvolumetrically charged at levels that will encourage connections to the public\nwater supply system.\n(v) Wastewater  will  be  charged  to  attain  financial  sustainability  for  at  least  the\noperation and maintenance of facilities plus 10 percent of capital cost recovery.\n(vi) Wastewater charges for industries will be progressively enforced according to the\npolluter pays principle.\n(vii) Tariffs will be maintained in real terms by periodically adjusting for inflation.\n6. Access to services for the financially disadvantaged\n21. Access  to  the  connections  will  be  simplified  by  allowing  incentives  for  connection\ncharges  and  payment  schedules.  Connection  requirements  will  be  simplified,  and  the\ndistribution network expanded to reach the poor. Incentives will be built into the operator's\ncontract to motivate the operator to address financially disadvantaged households and groups.\nBulk selling of water to smaller independent vendors will be allowed provided the price to the\nend consumer  is not  higher than the rates for the piped water supply.\n7. Transparency and Consultation with Consumers\n22. Transparency and participation will be promoted by adopting a consultative process,\nrecognizing the importance of people's participation and the value of their role in ensuring a\nwell-functioning water sector. This will ensure the full and timely disclosure of information,\nincluding reporting of key performance indicators to the press each year, and consultation with\nall socioeconomic groups in Kathmandu Valley.", "42\nAppendix 3\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION SECTOR\n1990 - 1999\nProject Name Type of Source Year Amount\nAssistance Start End $ million\nA.

To satisfy the ever-increasing demand for water in Kathmandu Valley, the Government\ncommissioned the preparation of a water supply and sewerage master plan. Prepared in 1973,\nit was followed by several development projects involving sources of water inside the valley. For\nvarious reasons, water supply remained inadequate and further studies were commissioned.\n2. Prefeasibility  Study.  This  study  (undertaken  in  1988)  investigated  three  types  of\nsurface  water  supply  schemes:  pumped,  storage,  and  gravity,  and  studied  20  schemes.\nPumping schemes would involve high operating costs with stringent maintenance criteria, while\nstorage schemes would be feasible, but would have a higher operating cost than Melamchi and\nless  economic  expansion  opportunity.  Of  the  gravity  options,  Melamchi  had  the  best\ncombination of economy and yield to meet the design target of 2 cubic meter (m3)/s (second)\nand be expandable.  The basic Melamchi concept was to have a low diversion weir (no storage)\non the Melamchi Khola and divert through a tunnel to a storage area in the Kathmandu Valley.\nThe initial idea was to have a 5 million m3 storage on the flood plain just below the proposed\nwater treatment plant. Subsequently, the World Bank proposed the modified Melamchi proposal,\nwhich involves a 15 million m3 flood plain storage, eliminating the need for construction of the\nexpensive 27 kilometers (km) transfer tunnel. The study, however, recommended adoption of\nthe basic Melamchi scheme to provide 2 m3/s with expansion to tap the Yangri and Larke kholas\nto give a total of 5 m3/s. This scheme included water treatment at Mahankal and a bulk\ndistribution system to serve Kathmandu and Lalitpur.\n3. Feasibility Study. The basic Melamchi scheme was adopted as the basis of the full\nfeasibility  study  in  1992.  The  study's  objective  was  to  assess  feasibility  of  the  basic  and\nmodified Melamchi schemes and recommend a preferred option. Citing the danger of founding a\nsignificant  dam  on  the  floodplain  sediments  in  a  highly  earthquake-prone  region,  Snowy\nMountain Engineering Corporation (SMEC) proposed the Sundarimai Dam inside the Shivapuri\nWatershed  and  Wildlife  Reserve.  The  economic  analysis  showed  Sundarimai  Dam  to  be\nexpensive for its yield, and therefore, it does not enter into the water resource expansion plan\nuntil after the Yangri and Larke sources are tapped. The scheme comprising an intake at\nNakotegaon, tunnel to Sundarimai, pipeline to Sundarijal, and a water treatment plant and bulk\ndistribution was determined to be the most desirable option. The study recommends: (i) carrying\nout an investigation to show whether Sundarimai Dam would enter the least cost expansion plan\nafter tapping the Larke Khola; (ii) if not, investigating a lower level tunnel alignment; (iii) subject\nto  the  findings,  proceeding  to  the  detailed  design  of  the  adopted  scheme;  and  (iv)  only\nconsidering in-valley storage if there is confidence that downstream irrigators will not be able to\nincrease their water use at the expense of municipal customers.\n4. Bankable Feasibility Study. Bhutwal Power Corporation's (BPC) study (1996) covered\nthe access roads, the intake on the Melamchi Khola, the transfer tunnel, and a 15 megawatt\nsurface power station at the downstream end of the tunnel. The intake was slightly upstream\nfrom the site chosen by SMEC. BPC adopted a free-flow tunnel with dimensions 3 m high and\n2.8 m wide giving a cross-sectional area of 7.6 m2. BPC proposed a public-private partnership to\nfinance the scheme, and to minimize costs, Nepali construction methods were to be used.", "Appendix 4, page 2\n44\n5. The  Melamchi  Water  Supply  Development  Board.  The  board  was  formed  in\nSeptember 1998 to implement the Melamchi Water Supply Project. Its board members comprise\nthe secretary of the Ministry of Physical Planning and Works as chair, a representative from\neach of the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Water Resources, the mayor of Kathmandu\nMetropolitan City, and a full-time executive director. Its specific functions are to (i) execute the\nMelamchi Drinking Water Project,; (ii) make project-specific policy decisions,; (iii) approve the\nprogram and budget, and (iv) report to the Government through MPPW.\n6. Melamchi Water Supply (Engineering) Project (February 1999).  Funded by the\nAsian Development Bank (ADB), the project's objective was to assist in preparing an investment\nproject. The components included (i) 170,000 m3/d diversion works on the Melamchi Khola, (ii) a\n7.5 m2 and 28 km long tunnel to Sundarijal, (iii) a 15 megawatt hydropower station, (iv) a\n170,000 m3/d water treatment plant, (v) a bulk distribution system, and (vi) distribution network\nimprovements. There were three tasks: (i) project management including financial, economic,\nenvironmental,  and  social  analyses  of  the  investment  project;  (ii) engineering  for  the  bulk\ndistribution system; and (iii) implementation of a groundwater artificial recharge pilot project.\n7. Diversion Scheme Final Design Study. The Norplan terms of reference required the\noptimization of the water transfer system as a dual-purpose water supply and hydropower\nscheme. Norplan retained the pressure tunnel concept but proposed a deeper tunnel profile.\nThe tunnel size was increased to 12 m2 for about half the tunnel and to 16 m2 for the rest of the\ntunnel with steeper grades. Norplan also proposed an underground power station. The study\n(1999) reported negligible economic advantage by adding the hydropower component.\n8. Review  of  Melamchi  Diversion  Final  Design  Study.  Nippon  Koei  reviewed  the\nNorplan report (2000) and concluded that a water supply only project with an 8 m2 free-flow\ntunnel and a lower intake on the Melamchi Khola would be more economical. The advantages\nwere (i) a greater catchment area; (ii) elimination of a tunnel construction adit and its access\nroad; (iii) shorter access roads; (iv) easier inspection and maintenance of a free-flow tunnel; and\n(v) reduced environmental impact.\n9. ADB Mission Recommends Exclusion of Hydropower (April 2000).  A high-level\nmission from ADB visited Nepal to discuss with the Government the possibility of excluding the\nhydropower component. Based on the additional adverse environmental impacts associated\nwith hydropower, which included the increased depletion of water from the river and the major\nquantities of water to be transferred from Melamchi Khola to the Bagmati River, the Government\ndecided to exclude hydropower from the Project.", "45\nAppendix 5, page 1\nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN\nTable A5.1: Detailed Cost Estimates\n($ million)\nItem Foreign Local Total\nExchange Currency Cost\nA.

The Project involves diverting water from the Melamchi River by gravity to Kathmandu\nValley at Mahankal (Sundarijal). This will involve construction of a tunnel, access roads, and\ntransmission lines in the Melamchi Valley, and a water treatment plant, reservoir sites, and a\nbulk distribution system in Kathmandu Valley. Pipelines will be run along road rights-of-way\n(ROW) and across private land. An estimated 40,913 persons will be variously affected by the\nProject.\nTable A3:1:  Households Affected by Loss of Agricultural Land and Residential\nand Commercial Structures\nProject Agricultural Structures House/Shop Shops on Total Families\nComponent Land on Private on Public Public and Persons\nLand Land Land Affected\nPAF SPAF SPAF SPAF SPAF PAFs PAPs\nMDS\nPermanent 1,295 200 118 7 1,620 9,072\nTemporary 502 502 2,811\nBDS\nPermanent 1,555 478 127 230 2,390 13,384\nTemporary 2,684 2,684 15,030\nWTP\nPermanent 30 48 1 79 616\nTotal 6,066 726 246 7 230 7,275 40,913\nBDS = bulk distribution system, MDS = Melamchi Diversion Scheme, PAF = project-affected families, SPAF - severely\nproject-affected families; WTP = water treatment plant.\nSource:  Consultant Reports.\n2. The overall impact of the Project is limited.  The majority (83 percent) of project-affected\nfamilies (PAFs) will be marginally affected by loss of agricultural land, while only 10 percent (726\nhouseholds) will be severely affected by loss of agricultural land.  Three percent of PAFs (253\nhouseholds) will lose their houses, 7 of which have shops attached.  Another 3 percent (230\nvendors) have encroached into road ROW along the bulk distribution system pipeline route.\n3. A total of 253 households, or 1,428 project affected persons (PAPs) will be displaced\nwhen their houses are affected. The incomes of 230 households (1,288 persons) will be affected\nwhen their temporary shops are cleared from public ROW.\n4. The resettlement action plan (RAP) identifies the (i) extent of losses; (ii) number of PAPs\nin various categories; (iii) policies and legal framework applicable; (iv) arrangements made for\ncompensation payments, relocation, and income restoration assistance; and (v) responsibilities\nfor delivering and monitoring the implementation measures.\nB. Socioeconomic Impacts on the Affected People\n5. A census survey of 100 percent of affected households is being carried out as detailed\ndesigns become available for each component.  This survey will serve as the cut-off date for\neligibility for entitlements.  The census survey combines an inventory of losses, ownership, and\nland tenure status with a collection of baseline socioeconomic data on each household as well\nas preferences for compensation and rehabilitation assistance.", "60\nAppendix 10, page2\nC. Objectives, Legislation, Policy Framework, and Entitlements\n6. Land acquisition for public purposes in Nepal is largely governed by the Land Acquisition\nAct 2034 (1977), which sets out compensation standards and benefits such as compensation\nfor lost assets at market value, provision for alternative land, and compensation for standing\ncrops and trees. However, the provisions are inadequate. To cover resettlement-related needs\nof  the  PAPs,  Melamchi  Water  Supply  Development  Board  (MWSDB)  has  prepared  a\nresettlement policy framework that was approved by the Government. The framework provides\nbenefits to nontitled persons such as encroachers and squatters, displacement allowances for\nrelocation,  and  income  restoration  assistance.    In  summary,  the  policy  framework  for\nresettlement  affecting  the  Project  is  similar  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank's  policy  on\nresettlement. Basic principles of the project resettlement policy include (i) avoidance of land\nacquisition and involuntary resettlement where feasible or minimization to the extent possible\nthrough the incorporation of social considerations into project design options, and (ii) where\npopulation displacement is unavoidable, payment of full compensation and assistance to people\nlosing assets, livelihood, and other resources so that they can improve or at a minimum restore\ntheir former economic and social conditions.\n7. The RAP contains 11 compensation categories: for land, crops and trees, loss of house\nand/or  commercial  enterprises,  compensation  for  damages  caused  during  construction,\nmitigation for loss of water due to diversion of the Melamchi River, displacement allowances,\nrehabilitation measures, loss of community facilities and resources, and group losses.  These\ncategories are listed in an entitlement matrix.\nD. Consultation, Participation, and Grievance Mechanism\n8. Public consultation for the Project began with the census survey of each PAF during\nwhich  focus  group  discussions  have  served  as  a  forum  for  participation  and  consultation.\nCoordination meetings were also held with local nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and\nlocal governments. MWSDB senior management have carried out an information campaign and\nconsultation with area residents in the Melamchi Valley.\n9. A public relations consultant is being hired by MWSDB to keep project area residents\nfully informed about the Project and to make sure that public concerns are communicated to\nMWSDB. The Board will prepare and distribute brochures outlining the resettlement policy and\ncompensation packages for PAPs and will involve community-based organizations and PAPs in\nthe information campaign, and implementation and monitoring of the resettlement plan.\n10. The PAPs and other people in the project areas will be able to make complaints or\nqueries to MWSDB and know that they will be heard and addressed fairly. The field office of the\nProject in the Melamchi valley and the Resettlement and Social Development Division of the\nProject Management Unit will be responsible for handling initial grievances of the PAPs, with the\nassistance  of  the  local  consultative  groups  and  particularly  the  local  community  liaison\nassistants who will help the PAFs to file their complaints and concerns to the MWSDB.\nE. Relocation of Housing and Settlements\n11. A total of 253 houses will be displaced and require relocation, as well as 230 shops with\nvery temporary structures of bamboo poles and plastic roofs.  The house owners prefer to\nreceive cash, and they will make their own arrangements to rebuild, either on their remaining\nland or elsewhere. Group resettlement sites will not be required. For the vendors whose shops\nare illegally encroaching within the ROW, MWSDB will assist the local governments to find\npermanent market sites in which they can rent stalls.", "61\nAppendix 10, page3\nF. Income Restoration Strategies\n12. Severely project-affected families (SPAFs), including households fully affected by loss of\nhouses  and/'or  commercial  establishments,  and  households  severely  affected  by  loss  of\nagricultural land, will be entitled to allowances to restore their household incomes during the\ntransition period. They will also be assisted to restore their income levels in the longer term\nthrough skills training, assistance to establish new income-generating activities, and access to\nmicrofinance.  SPAFs  and  vulnerable  groups  (e.g.,  households  headed  by  women,  ethnic\nminorities, disabled, elderly, and special interest groups) will be given priority in all income\nrestoration or creation measures. SPAF farmers will be provided with agricultural extension\nservices to increase productivity on their remaining land.\nG. Institutional framework\n13. The implementation of the RAP will be carried out by the Social and Environmental\nDivision  of  the  Project  Management  Unit,  assisted  by  the  compensation  determination\ncommittees and local consultative groups at the ward level. MWSDB will be responsible for\nensuring the necessary cooperation of contractors, government departments, and PAPs.\nH. Resettlement Budget and Financing\n14. The estimated cost of land acquisition and resettlement is about $15.80 million. The\nresettlement cost estimate includes all costs related to resettlement including compensation,\nrelocation, transfer costs, displacement allowances, rehabilitation costs, administrative costs,\nresettlement training, and costs of monitoring and evaluation.  MWSDB will allocate appropriate\nfunds  on  the  basis  of  construction  priorities  and  resettlement  needs  for  the  different\ncomponents.\nI. Implementation Schedule\n15. An implementation schedule for the RAP has been prepared to ensure the completion of\nresettlement  activities  before  the  beginning  of  the  relevant  civil  works  of  the  Project.\nResettlement preparation activities have started. Land acquisition has already begun and will\ncontinue until the end of 2004. Monitoring and evaluation of the impacts of RAP implementation\nwill continue into 2005.\nJ. Monitoring and Evaluation Plan\n16. The resettlement process will be monitored both internally and externally. The Social\nand  Environmental  Division  will  be  responsible  for  internal  monitoring  and  preparation  of\nmonthly  and  trimesterly  progress  reports  on  the  progress  of  resettlement  implementation.\nMWSDB  will  hire  a  qualified  independent  external  monitoring  agency  to  conduct  external\nmonitoring annually during Project implementation. The monitoring and evaluation process will\ninvolve the participation of affected people, communities, and/or NGOs. A postresettlement\nevaluation  will  be  carried  out  by  the  external  monitoring  agency  to  assess  whether  the\nresettlement  objectives  have  been  met,  and  lessons  learned  identified  for  future  policy\nformulation and planning.", "62\nAppendix 11, Page 1\nSUMMARY OF THE FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSES\nA. Financial Analysis\n1. Supply Assessment\n1. Water supply projections assume that in the preproject period supply may increase as a\nresult of a reduction of losses and some rehabilitation or expansion of groundwater and surface\nwater sources. Current losses of 40 percent are assumed to decrease to 35 percent by 2007, to\n30 percent by 2011, and to 25 percent by 2021. An extra 21 million liters per day (MLD) is\nassumed to come from Manohara from 2004. The Project will supply an average 180 MLD,\nbringing the total availability of supply in 2007 to 304 MLD as compared with 111 MLD in 2000.\nThe water supply projections do not consider the timing of the Yangri and Larke river water\nsupply options from valleys adjoining the Melamchi, but these additional water supplies may be\nrequired during 2012 to 2021.\n2. Demand Assessment\n2. Projections of water demand assume a population of 1.5 million in 2000 and a growth\nrate of 4.0 percent in 2001, falling to 2.8 percent in 2016, and remaining steady at that level\nthereafter. From project commissioning, 80 percent of the population is assumed to be served,\nrising to 95 percent in 2021. Estimates of household demand based on a weighted average\nincrease range from 62 liters per capita per day (lpcpd) in 2000 to 95 lpcpd in 2007, and to\n105 lpcpd in 2011. This assumes demand management by pricing (and public awareness).\nHouseholds with full plumbing are assumed to increase from 26 percent currently, to 46 percent\nin 2007, and to 68 percent in 2021. The proportion of households using standposts is expected\nto decline from 22 percent currently, to 14 percent in 2007, and to 2 percent in 2021. The\nbalance are assumed to have yard taps and represent 52 percent in 2000, 40 percent in 2007,\nand 30 percent in 2021. The majority of households are assumed to have full plumbing and\nhigher water consumption by 2021. Projections of commercial, industrial, and institutional piped\nwater supply demand as a proportion of domestic demand increases from 5 percent currently to\n14 percent in 2007, but then declines to 12 percent by 2011 and remains at this level thereafter\ndue in part to assumed relocation of industry outside Kathmandu Valley.\n3. Relending to Utility\n3. Relending terms in local currency (NRs) from the Government to the Nepal Water\nSupply Corporation (NWSC) are assumed to be on the basis of 50 percent grant and 50 percent\nloan. The loan will be at an interest rate of 8 percent per annum, over 20 years with a grace\nperiod on principal repayments up to 2008.\n4. Cost Recovery Policy and Assumptions\n4. Based on the objective for the sector to meet cash expenses up to 2006, average tariffs\npre-Project rise from NRs6.6/m3 in 2000 to around NRs12.8/m3 in 2006. This is based on a\npolicy of meeting cash operating and maintenance costs as well as private sector contracting\nand regulatory costs. Over this period, tariffs are not expected to recover investment costs or\nservice debt on past investments. The financial projections assume that the private sector\nmanagement contract will improve collection efficiency from the current 75 percent of billings to\n97.5 percent of billings by 2005. Standpipes will be metered and charged at the lifeline rate.\nGroundwater charges for commercial and industrial consumers will be at 50 percent of the", "63\nAppendix 11, Page 2\nmaximum rate for piped water supply users. Wastewater will continue to be charged at 50\npercent surcharge on water tariff for those households connected to a sewer.\n5. In the postproject period, the objective is to meet operation and maintenance costs\nincluding those from source to consumer for the Project, debt servicing costs of the lease funds\nre-lent to the utility, the regulatory costs, and the private sector lease contract on-going costs.\nTariffs are set to meet a debt service ratio (DSR) of 1.1 in 2007 and 1.2 in 2010 and each year\nthereafter. All commercial and industrial use of groundwater is assumed to cease with such\nusers connecting to the piped water supply over 2007 and 2008. The average tariff post-Project\nin FY2009 is estimated at NRs23/m3 (in 2000 prices) based on 50:50 loan:grant relending. The\nrecommendation is to keep the 50:50 loan:grant relending, but debt servicing would commence\nin FY2007 with interest payments and principal payments phased over 2008 and 2009. The\naverage tariff would be NRs18/m3 in 2007, rising to NRs23/m3 in 2009. In practice, the increase\nover 2006 to 2009 could be smoothed and would require real increases of 21 percent per\nannum for three years.\n5. Affordability\n6. Median household income in Kathmandu Valley is estimated at NRs14,000 per month,\nand the lowest quartile median at NRs6070 per month. Prior to project commissioning, water\ntariffs as a percentage of household income for a low income household consuming 60 lpcpd\nincreases from 0.7 percent of household income in 2000 to 1.1 percent in 2006. Post-Project\nthis rises to 1.9 percent in 2009  and remains around that level. Where a low-income household\nis also connected to the sewerage system, affordability represents 2.8 percent of household\nincome in 2008.\n7. For a median income household, water tariffs as a percentage of household income in\n2000  and  assuming  125  lpcpd  consumption  will  amount  to  1.2  percent.  Where  they  are\nconnected to the sewerage system this will be about 1.8 percent of household income. By 2006,\nthis will have increased to 1.9 percent of household income for a water only connection and 2.9\npercent  of  household  income  incorporating  the  sewerage  surcharge.  Following  project\ncommissioning, the water only tariff would equate to 2.6 percent of household income in 2007\nrising to 3.2 percent in 2009. Adding the sewerage surcharge, in 2009 tariffs are equivalent to\n4.8 percent of household income; it  remains at this level over the balance of the forecast period\nto 2012.\n8. Commercial consumers will pay the same charges as domestic consumers, but above\n30 m3 per month all consumption will be charged at the highest rate. This means that by 2008\nmost commercial consumers will be paying around NRs77/m3 for their water requirements and\nan additional NRs39/m3 for sewerage. These charges are in line with the average incremental\nfinancial cost of NRs88/m3 at 12 percent discount rate.\n6. Willingness-to-Pay\n9. A survey conducted in August 2000 of 100 potential consumers from all cross-sections\nof society, showed 90 percent willing to pay NRs500 per month for a 24-hour supply of piped\npotable water. This compares with a current average of NRs150 per month. The financial\nprojections assume a monthly charge of NRs555 per month (in 2000 prices) for 19.1 m3. This\nwould be 39 percent more water than is being received by average fully plumbed customer at\nthe present time.", "Appendix 11, Page 3\n64\n7. Financial Internal Rate of Return\n10. The overall financial internal rate of return (FIRR) for the Project is 4.7 percent. This may\nbe compared with a weighted average cost of capital of 0 percent, where the onlending rate is 8\npercent  and  domestic  inflation  is  8  percent  resulting  in  a  real  interest  rate  of  0  percent.\nSensitivity analysis shows the FIRR falling to 3.4 percent when capital costs increase by 10\npercent and revenue decreases by 10 percent. The FIRR for this Project is not dissimilar to\nthose for many other urban water supply projects in developing countries.\n8. Past Financial Performance of NWSC\n11. Over the past five years, the NWSC's performance has been characterized by high\nwater losses (estimated at 40 percent of production), poor service (often only 1-2 hours every\nother  day),  low  tariffs  (around  1  to  2  percent  of  household  income)  and  low  collection\nefficiencies.  Debtors  have  risen  to  the  level  of  311  days  of  sales  equivalent  in  2000.\nConsequently, NWSC has only been able to maintain a positive cash flow by deferring debt\nservice payments to Government.\n12. This has resulted in a weak financial position with NWSC unable to generate sufficient\nfunds to carry out adequate levels of repairs and maintenance, let alone meet its debt service\nobligations or make any meaningful contribution to the sector's capital requirements. In fact the\nfirst two World Bank (IDA) credits have been converted to equity, while NWSC is unable to meet\ninterest payments on the IDA Third Water Supply and Sewerage Project with no schedule\nagreed for loan repayment.  In the case of the fourth IDA credit, which has been rescheduled\nand reduced in size and scope from some $60 million to $38 million, it had been agreed that 65\npercent will be passed on to NWSC  as a grant, with 35 percent to be onlent and repaid by\nNWSC .\n13. Past financial performance of NWSC shows that net profit has declined steadily from\nNRs40 million in FY1995 to a loss of NRs42 million in FY1999, and a provisional loss in FY2000\nof NRs72 million. Also over this period, while the results provided for the payment of interest to\nthe  Government,  no  interest  was  actually  paid.  However,  there  was  some  offset  of  the\nGovernment revenues owing on stand posts with interest owed by NWSC.\n14. At the current levels of net profit and operating losses, NWSC will not be able to meet\nany ongoing capital expenditure out of retained earnings. In practice, the level of operating and\nmaintenance costs has not been sufficient to keep the NWSC water and sewerage systems\noperating properly.\n15. This poor financial performance has led to proposals to have Kathmandu water supplies\nmanaged by a private operator through a lease arrangement. The proposed lease is for 10\nyears, and the private operator is assumed to be in place by September 2001, prior to the\nfinalizing of the Melamchi tunnel contract. This is expected to result in improved operational\nperformance and a reduction in water losses and improved collection efficiencies. Financial\nprojections and assumptions for inside Kathmandu Valley for a Kathmandu water utility and\nprivate operator are set out in Supplementary Appendix A.", "Appendix 11, Page 4\n65\nB.  Economic Analysis\n1. Demand Assessment\n16. The economic analysis uses demand curves based on income and price to evaluate\nnonincremental and incremental benefits. The concepts underlying the curves were originally\ndeveloped in Kathmandu studies (SMEC 1992) and further refined with analysis of information\nfrom the ADB Water Utilities Data Book for the Asian and Pacific Region (November 1993).\n2. Without Project\n17. The without-project option has been considered. Without an increase in water availability\nand without improvement in management, the water scenario for Kathmandu is bleak. NWSC is\nunable to meet demand. Delivery is limited to less than two hours every two days. Pressures\nare poor and water quality is poor. Tariffs are low, encouraging high demand from those who do\nget water. Many consumers at high elevations or distant points receive little or no water. NWSC\nrevenues are too low to sustain the system, let alone expand to meet the demands of a growing\npopulation. Shallow wells are becoming increasingly polluted and the deep aquifers mined. The\nrisk of serious health problems is increasing. The poor suffer the most \u2014 fetching and carrying,\nusing shallow wells and polluted streams, or relying on public standpipes. Many only get water\nin  the  middle  of  the  night  or  rely  on  purchasing  it  from  their  neighbors.  Higher  income\nconsumers are relying on tanker deliveries, bottled water purchase, and deep wells. If nothing is\ndone, the situation will continue to deteriorate. Income, welfare, and the environment suffer. The\nincreasing economic cost of shortage in the without-project case is illustrated by the economic\nprice of water rising from about NRs40/m3 currently to about NRs110/m3 in 2012.\n3. Alternative Designs\n18. Options to augment water supply in Kathmandu Valley have been studied at length for\nthe last two decades. In-valley surface water options include storage and reallocation of water\nuse. In-valley storage in the foothills has high cost and low yield because of the steep slopes\nand limited catchments. Storage lower in the valley have high social costs and water quality\nproblems due to population density and land use. In-valley options do not compete with the\nMelamchi in terms of cost or social disruption. The possibility of reallocating water from low\neconomic  value  to  water  supply  has  been  considered  but  is  subject  to  social  and  legal\ndifficulties. Alternative sources from outside the valley have been considered at length but\neliminated on the grounds of high pumping costs and/or low capacity for future expansion.\nAlternative arrangements for the Melamchi have been examined including high and low tunnels,\nwith and without reservoir, and with and without hydropower. The arrangement now proposed,\nwith low level tunnel, no impoundment storage, and no hydropower is the least cost and least\nenvironmentally disruptive. Furthermore, the option for low cost gravity expansion of supply from\nthe Yangri and Larke rivers and in-valley storage in the future is retained.\n4. Subsidies\n19. The Government has agreed that full cost recovery for the water supplies in Kathmandu\nwill be phased in by 2010, which is about three years after commissioning of the Project.\nNevertheless, a number of subsidies are provided despite the full cost recovery concept:", "Appendix 11, Page 5\n66\n(i)  Subsidy provided to NWSC. The funds to develop the Project are passed on to\nthe NWSC as 50 percent grant and 50 percent loan. This is comparable to the\ncurrent policy for capital works in Greater Colombo Water Supply, but it is expected\nto be terminated in consideration of any new water supply works necessary for\nKathmandu Valley after 2010.\n(ii)  Subsidy for all capital works for wastewater improvements.  This  is  being\nprovided as a grant. This follows policy adopted elsewhere in Asia and in many\nparts of the developed world.\n(iii)  Subsidy  to  users  of  groundwater  in  Kathmandu  Valley.  Industrial  and\ncommercial  users  in  particular  take  this  water  for  free,  although  the  cost  of\nextraction by pumping is significant. By December 2002, this subsidy is expected\nto  be  phased  out  with  the  introduction  of  licensing  and  charging  for  major\ngroundwater extraction.\n(iv)  Subsidy to farmers within Kathmandu Valley. This is a social issue that will be\naddressed  over  the  next  few  years  under  the  Project  as  part  of  a  technical\nassistance optimizing water use in Kathmandu Valley.\n(v)  Subsidy to industries in Kathmandu Valley. This subsidy will be phased out\nthrough legislation and institutional controls introduced under the Project whereby\nthe polluting industries will be given assistance to relocate and provide appropriate\ntreatment of their effluents.\n(vi)  Cross-subsidy. Perhaps the most important, this is the subsidy provided by other\nwater users to the urban poor to enable them to have equitable access to adequate\nand clean water. Ideally, this should be paid to the NWSC by the Government as a\nseparate  social  subsidy;  but  as  all  water  users  enjoy  some  subsidies,  it  is\nreasonable to accept the concept of a cross-subsidy whereby the better-off users\nsubsidize the poor.\n(vii)  Subsidy to a private operator  to manage the water supply. This is expected to\nbe  eliminated  after  the  first  three  years  of  the  lease  contract  when  sufficient\nrevenues from tariffs should be generated to cover these costs.\n5. Economic Internal Rate of Return\n20. For the economic evaluation of the Project, costs with the Project less costs without the\nProject, have been taken as $322 million and a standard conversion factor of 0.9 applied.\nIncremental operation and maintenance costs are considered to be 1 percent of the Melamchi\ncosts plus $0.04/m3 of water produced. Economic benefits are evaluated using the demand\ncurves  and  associated  income  and  price  parameters  to  calculate  nonincremental  and\nincremental benefits for each year. To the extent that the consumer recognizes the benefits and\nthis is reflected in the price paid for water, the approach internalizes the benefits associated with\nhealth, welfare, and convenience. It shows benefits of around NRs1500 million per year in the\nfirst years after the Project is commissioned. The benefits then increase to about NRs6000\nmillion per year from 2020.", "67\nAppendix 11, Page 6\n21. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Project is 13.5 percent. The EIRR for\nthe Project at full development is 15.3 percent. The total cost of the Project is high because of\nthe need to provide a sound basis for expansion in the future. Much of the costs now will reduce\nfuture expansion costs. Sensitivity analysis of the EIRR shows that it is sensitive to the level of\ntariff. If real tariff levels remain unchanged, the EIRR would be 8.9 percent. If water loss remains\nat 40 percent, the EIRR would be 10.1 percent. If real income growth were to be only 1 percent\nper year, the EIRR would be 11.9 percent. Due to the price elasticity of demand, increasing the\nnondomestic tariff by 50 percent lowers the EIRR to 12.9 percent. If capital costs are 10 percent\nhigher than estimated, the EIRR will fall to 12.6 percent. The EIRR is not sensitive to delays in\nimplementation.  The detailed economic analysis is set out in Supplementary Appendix B.", "68\nAppendix 12, page 1\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES\nActions Beneficial Adverse Impacts Mitigation Measures\nImpacts\n1.

Methodology\n1.  The Project\u2019s social assessment derives from many different sources. As part of project\npreparation, it comprises (i) resettlement census/surveys for the Melamchi diversion scheme main\naccess road (i.e. Sindhupalchok District, 114 households, 1999), Mahankal water treatment plant\narea  (56  affected  households,  1999),  and  bulk  distribution  system  (2000);  (ii)  socioeconomic\nsurveys in Kathmandu Valley (128,000 households in 1996/97 and another 1,100 households in\n1999); (iii) surveys, participatory rural appraisals, and public consultations in the Melamchi Valley;\n(iv) nongovernment organization (NGO) consultations in Melamchi and Kathmandu valleys; and (v)\nhygiene surveys (550 households) and PRA exercises (20 sites) in Kathmandu Valley. Major\noutside sources include a study on the water supply and sanitation services for the urban poor by\nthe World Bank/United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Water and Sanitation Program,\nand other statistics and studies.\nB.  Socioeconomic and Poverty Profiles of Project Impact Areas\n1.  Kathmandu Valley\n2. Demographic Profile. Kathmandu Valley (500 square kilometer) with a population of 1.5\nmillion comprises five municipalities, including the three major ones (i.e. Bhaktapur, Kathmandu,\nand Lalitpur).  Its population grew by 2.4 times over the last two decades (5.0 percent per annum).\nThe average household size is 7.1 with variation among municipalities (6.7 in Lalitpur and 8.3 in\nBhaktapur).  In terms of ethnicity/caste, the Newars are dominant (72 percent), followed by the\nBrahmins (13 percent), the Chhetris (8 percent), and many other groups. The Project will not\nadversely impact on a specific ethnic/caste group.\n3. Socioeconomic Profile. The livelihood pattern in Kathmandu Valley is that of urban; 86\npercent of the households are engaged in urban-based employment (31 percent employed, 55\npercent self-employed) such as manufacturing, construction, commerce, transport, communication,\nfinance, and other businesses. Only 10 percent work in agriculture. Most households have more\nthan one income source. Access to health, education, services, and basic infrastructure is better\nthan the national average, although overcrowding and poor maintenance and deterioration of\nfacilities are widely observed.\n4. Poverty.  About  45  percent  of  the  population  in  Nepal  live  below  poverty  line,  using\nNRs4,400 per capita per annum as the poverty threshold. The country is ranked 144th among 174\ncountries in the UNDP\u2019s 1997 human development index, reflecting its low performance in the\nhuman development sector. Poverty incidence in Kathmandu Valley is unclear, but the most recent\nestimate shows around 12-15 percent (Water and Sanitation Program, 2000). Average income\nlevel also varies across municipalities; 41 percent of total households in Kathmandu municipality\nhave monthly incomes of NRs12,000 and above, whereas only 22 percent of households in\nBhaktapur municipality have this much income.\n5. Kathmandu Valley has many pockets of poverty, mostly found in slums (established legal\nsettlements), squatter settlements,2 or rented accommodation.  Of these, the poor living in the\nslums are generally low caste, while the squatter population tends to be more heterogeneous. \nRental  accommodation  is  occupied  by  a  range  of  low-income  groups  such  as  day  laborers,\nhawkers, and un/semiskilled factory workers. The poor usually live in small settlements scattered\n                    \n1  For project impacts, see the main text, paras. 123-125 and Appendix 10 (Summary Resettlement Plan).\n2  A 1996 survey by an NGO, Lumanti, found 47 squatter settlements with 1,783 households, 20 percent of which were\nheaded by women.", "72\nAppendix 13, page 2\naround the valley, adjacent to higher-income settlements, and therefore, it is difficult to locate\nthem, especially individual low-income renters.  Street children are also a growing concern for their\nvulnerability.\n2.  Melamchi Valley\n6. Demographic Profile. The Project\u2019s zone of impact in Melamchi Valley includes 14 village\ndevelopment committees (VDCs) in Sindhupalchok (79 VDCs altogether; 11 directly affected and\nthree  indirectly  affected)  and  three  VDCs  in  Kabhre  Palanchok  District  (marginally  indirectly\naffected). The population of the direct impact zone in Sindhupalchok District is about 40,000, with\nan average household size of 6.8 persons. The districtwide ethnic/caste composition is: Tamangs\n(33 percent) who are dominant in the hills, Chhetris (19 percent) and Brahmins (12 percent) who\nare dominant in the valleys and lowlands, Newars (12 percent), and others. Among them, the\nTamangs (usually marginal landholders) and lower castes (usually landless) are economically\ndisadvantaged.\n7. Poverty and Livelihood. The poverty incidence of Sindhupalchok District is estimated to\nbe 50-55 percent. The economy is predominantly rural, with 90 percent of the population engaged\nin  farming  and  fishing  activities,  and  85  percent  living  at  subsistence  level.  The  average\nlandholding size in the district is small at 0.62 ha, and the land fragmentation and the topography\nin the hills, combined with lack of access to agricultural inputs, extension, technology, credit, and\nmarkets, are impediments to improving agricultural productivity.  In much of the Project zone of\nimpact, there is a lack of basic educational facilities and teachers. The illiteracy rate in direct\nimpact zone was 11 percent for males and 25 percent for females (NORPLAN, 1999).  The health\nsituation  and  sanitary  condition  in  the  zone  of  impact  is  poor,  and  malnutrition  is  common\nespecially among women of reproductive age and children. Basic health facilities are lacking. \nWomen are disproportionately affected by the daily hardship of poverty due to their multiple tasks\nin the domestic and productive arenas.\n8. Trafficking of girls. Sindhupalchok District, especially Tamang communities, is historically\nknown  for  trafficking  of  girls.  The  push  factors  are  complex,  encompassing  the  established\nrecruitment syndicate over time, alleged backing by high-ranking officials and politicians, specific\nexotic appearance of certain ethnic groups favored by the market, poverty, cultural perceptions and\nlow status of women, and lack of awareness by the communities.  Over the last five years or so,\nassistance agencies and NGOs have made significant investments in antitrafficking activities. The\nresults to date are mixed; while the level of community awareness appears to have been raised,\nthe actual prosecution cases are still limited (about 5 percent). In addition, a number of NGOs are\nworking in a poorly coordinated manner, though efforts are being made by the district development\ncommittee (DDC) Task Force to improve the situation.  \nC.  Practices, Perceptions and Needs\n1.  Kathmandu Valley3\n9. Access  to  Water  Supply.  The  present  water  supply  by  the  Nepal  Water  Supply\nCorporation (NWSC) shows that an average person in the valley receives only 40 percent of their\npotential demand in the dry season and 60 percent in the wet season. Currently, 86 percent of\nKathmandu Valley population are the registered customers of NWSC-supplied water, through\nabout 100,000 private connections and/or 1,300 community standposts; 76 percent have meters.\n                    \n3 This section draws heavily from the Nippon Koei survey (1999). Analysis of the urban poor primarily draws upon:\nMeeting the Water and Sanitation Needs of the Kathmandu Poor: Issues and Options for Service Delivery (Water and\nSanitation Program \u2013 South Asia, June 2000).", "73\nAppendix 13, page 3\nAmong them, only one third of customers have fully plumbed household connections and most rely\non a shared supply (i.e., yard tap and standpost). In the dry season many have to resort to\nexpensive tankered supply. Moreover, 82 percent of the NWSC customers are dissatisfied with the\ncurrent NWSC services, due to (i) insufficient quantity; (ii) poor quality; (iii) unreliability of supply,\nespecially in the dry season (on average 2 hours per day, every other day); 35 out of 112 wards in\nthe valley not having any NWSC water supply in the last two to three months of the dry season);\nand (iv) difficulties paying water bills (e.g., cumbersome procedures, long lines). However, 55\npercent of survey respondents thought the cost was reasonable. Twenty percent took away the\nwater meter, a sign of refusal to pay bills. Most (86 percent) NWSC customers also use diverse\nsecondary sources, including (from the highest) tubewell/rowing pump, well, Hiti (traditional spring\nfed water spout), neighbor, water vendor, public standpipe, and others. The most common storage\ntype is roof tank (52 percent), followed by pumped underground tank (34 percent), complemented\nby pots and buckets.\n10. Non-NWSC Water Supply. Non-NWSC customers (14 percent of population) in general\nbelong to lower income groups than the customers. Fifty-two percent claimed that they do not have\naccess to enough water. The major water sources used by the noncustomers are similar to those\nby the customers, though reliance on public stand pipe is the highest (54 percent in the wet and 36\npercent  in  the  dry  seasons).  Water  vending  is  not  an  option  due  to  the  high  cost.  For\nnoncustomers, the frequency of water collection is four times a day on average.\n11. Poverty and Gender. The most disadvantaged group in terms of access to water are the\nindividual low-income renters, as they depend on their landlords for water services and are not\nsupported by community services. On the other hand, poverty/income level does affect the pattern\nof water and sanitation management practices. Hardship in water management is more severe\namong  the  poorer  households,  and  mostly  among  women  who  bear  the  predominant\nresponsibilities of water collection, storage, and treatment.  The average time spent on water\ncollection in squatter and slum settlements in the same study was 58 minutes. NWSC water supply\nis often at odd hours (e.g., midnight to 3 a.m.), which could jeopardize women\u2019s safety; some\ncases of young women being attacked by local gangs while collecting water from the community\ntaps have been reported.\n12. Hygiene and Sanitation.4 Water-borne diseases due to the poor water quality are common\nin Kathmandu Valley, especially among children; diarrhea, stomach pain, dysentery, skin diseases,\neye infections, hepatitis, malaria are widely observed.  However, 90 percent of the population did\nnot think they were frequently suffering from water-related disease, indicating a need for hygiene\nawareness raising. Water quality is worsened by contamination from polluted shallow groundwater\nand leaky distribution pipes. Seventy-two percent reported the practice of domestic water treatment\nbut boiling was only 20 percent. Of those who did not use any treatment, 87 percent thought it\nunnecessary. The prevalence of latrines is low: according to United Nations Children's Fund\n(UNICEF) estimates: 16 percent in rural and 51 percent in urban Kathmandu Valley in 1996/97.\nThe reasons for not having a toilet were costs, lack of space, no water, no sewer, and no perceived\nneed. Among water users, only 27 percent are connected to the sewage system, most of which\ndischarges straight into the Bagmati River. The valley has a limited capacity of sewage treatment.\nDrainage is poorly developed, which causes frequent flooding of septic tanks and other sanitation\nfacilities. Kathmandu Valley\u2019s solid waste problem is well known. Of the households surveyed, 26\npercent reported disposing of solid waste in the street.  Much of it is also disposed of along river\nbanks, contributing to water contamination.  Hygiene is also poor; for example, 29 percent of\nsurvey respondents did not know that the poor water quality was harmful to health.\n                    \n4 Mainly drawing from Hygiene Survey (Nippon Koei, 2000).", "74\nAppendix 13, page 4\n13. Sanitation  for  the  Poor.    Among  the  low-income  communities,  latrine  coverage  is\nincreasing with the assistance of local authorities and NGOs, but toilets tend to be unhygienic\nespecially in squatter settlements.  Where pay-and-use toilets are found, they are relatively well\nfunctioning and maintained.  Solid waste disposal is a great concern, though there is a case for\ncommunity-based service functioning on a user payment basis.  Drainage is a major problem in\nmany low-income settlements.  With NGO support, there are also cases of savings and credit,\nproviding  potential  for  user  investment  in  sanitation  infrastructure  upgrading.    As  in  water\nmanagement, hygiene management is also considered a primary responsibility for women.\n14. Water  Supply.    Results  from  various  surveys  and  studies  indicate  strong  needs  and\ndemands among the current NWSC customers for better water services with more quantity, better\nquality, more reliability (i.e., every day, whole day supply) and user-friendliness (e.g., methods of\npayment, service agents\u2019 attitudes). Among the non-NWSC customers, 63 percent responded that\nthey would like to be registered with NWSC. The reasons for not registering include availability of\nother water sources, costs, poor service of NWSC, and no water distribution pipe.  In general,\nNWSC does not project a good corporate image among customers and noncustomers. A high\ninterest in the formation of water user committees was expressed (83 percent).\n15. Willingness  to  Pay.  About  82  percent  of  all  respondents  (both  customers  and\nnoncustomers of NWSC service) showed willingness to pay more, on average NRs167 per month,\nranging from NRs93 per month (for the income group below NRs3,999 per month) to NRs229 per\nmonth (for the income group above NRs12,000 per month), on condition that they are given\nsufficient information on what the supply will be like. The willingness to pay for public standpipes\nwas much lower at 43 percent. \n16. Hygiene and Sanitation.  Both the awareness and practice of basic hygiene were low;\nthese  influence  and  are  influenced  by  the  inadequacy  of  sanitation-related  infrastructure  and\nsystems (e.g., latrines, drainage, sewage, solid waste management) and weak commitment and\nconsensus  by  the  public  administration  on  the  investment  in  such  infrastructure/service\nimprovement.  However, experience elsewhere shows that beneficiaries, including the poor, have\nthe capacity of maximizing the benefits of improved infrastructure and services, if they are provided\nwith intensive awareness raising support involving not only public campaigns but also community-\nbased participatory learning.  Nevertheless, awareness raising is only effective if it goes with the\nactual improvement of water supply and sanitation services.\n2. Perceptions and Needs of the Melamchi Valley\n17. In general, Melamchi Valley will be an environmentally (e.g., reduced water for irrigation\nand  domestic  use,  noise  and  pollution  by  the  construction,  negative  impact  on  biological\nenvironment) and socially (e.g., resettlement and land acquisition, potential conflict with incoming\noutsiders) adversely affected area by the Project, although improved infrastructure (e.g. access\nroads) and the expanded local markets with the incoming construction and other workers will also\nbenefit its population. \n18. From the early stage of project conceptualization, the local communities and leaders have\nraised concerns of such adverse impacts.  A series of public consultations and NGO consultation\nworkshops  have  taken  place  to  identify  the  perceptions  and  needs  of  Melamchi  Valley\ncommunities and explore ways to transform the mitigation measures into sustainable development\nopportunities.  A  major  concern  of  the  communities  is  not  the  project  design  itself  but  the\nGovernment\u2019s  commitment  to  deliver,  including  the  compensation  and  mitigation  packages. \nAffected communities of the valley wish to see tangible service delivery and the Government\u2019s", "75\nAppendix 13, page 5\nphysical  presence  (instead  of  consultants)  in  the  affected  areas  so  they  can  confirm  the\nGovernment\u2019s sincerity and commitment. Therefore, the Project identified the importance of (i)\nsequencing assistance (i.e., simple physical assistance such as school rehabilitation first, under\nthe social uplift program [SUP]); (ii) starting the land acquisition/compensation process without\ndelays; and (iii) ensuring Melamchi Water Supply Development Board (MWSDB) representation in\nall consensus building meetings.\nD. Social and Poverty Strategy\n19. Resettlement Action Plan and Social Uplift Program. Social mitigation and rehabilitation\nmeasures will be implemented under the RAP and the SUP. The SUP will include development\nactivities for the Melamchi Valley covering five areas: buffer zone development, rural electrification,\nhealth, education, and income generation/community development. Women\u2019s special needs for\nreproductive health, adult literacy, skills development and income generation, legal awareness\nraising, and antitrafficking of women and girls will also be addressed. To ensure ownership and\nsustainability, the SUP will (i) take a participatory approach through community mobilizers; (ii)\nutilize the institutional structure of the ongoing Local Governance Program whereby capacity\nbuilding for DDC and VDCs will be conducted through the programs, assisted by experts; and (iii)\nbe run by the levy paid by Kathmandu Valley water users in the postconstruction stage.\n20. Stakeholder Participation.  The Project has been prepared with extensive participation of\nstakeholders from all sides, including beneficiaries, adversely affected people, VDC and ward\nrepresentatives,  DDC/municipality  officials  and  representatives,  concerned  ministries  and\nMWSDB, NGOs, the private sector, financing agencies, and consultants. The Project will address\ndirect  participation  of  beneficiaries  through  (i)  the  SUP  implementation  (through  community\ngroups);  (ii)  representation  of  adversely  affected  people  in  the  compensation  determination\ncommittee; (iii) representation of Kathmandu Valley beneficiaries in final environmental impact\nassessment stakeholder meeting; (iv) water user groups and forest user groups in both valleys;\nand (v) implementation of the hygiene education and promotion program.\n21. Consensus Building. Consensus building is necessary at all levels, especially at the start\nof the Project. Key issues for consensus building include: the amount of the water levy, access to\nwater (e.g., quantity, distribution), water tariff, private sector management, environmental and\nsocial mitigation, compensation, and employment. A dispute resolution expert, to be assisted by\nPMU and other project staff, consultants and NGOs, will be hired to facilitate this process.  For\nadversely impacted communities, local consultative groups will be established in each affected\nVDC.  The signing of a memorandum of understanding between the affected VDCs and the Project\nwill be a condition for the civil works contract award.\n23. NGO Participation Plan.  An NGO participation plan was developed in close consultation\nwith NGOs working in the Melamchi and Kathmandu valleys. NGOs will act as facilitators to\nstrengthen the capacity of local government bodies by implementing the SUP, hygiene awareness\nraising in Kathmandu Valley, and project monitoring and evaluation. An inventory of 56 NGOs has\nbeen made and the selection criteria developed. Independently from the NGO participation plan, a\nthird  party  will  be  contracted  to  undertake  external  monitoring  for  the  resettlement  and\ncompensation activities.\n24. Employment Strategy.  Based on the consultations and review of existing studies, it was\ndecided that setting a quota for local employment for construction works would be very difficult,\ndue to the contractors\u2019 unwillingness because of the higher wages demanded by the local laborers\nand their unavailability throughout the year (because of agricultural and other demands). However,\npeople severely affected by the Project and the identified vulnerable groups will have highest\npriority access to such employment opportunities, as part of their entitlement.", "76\nAppendix 13, page 6\n25. Hygiene Education and Promotion Program (HEPP).  The program was developed\nbased on the survey, PRAs, and a good practice model in urban Nepal (e.g., Pokhara, Bhaktapur).\nComprehensive hygiene awareness raising activities will be conducted in two phases: a pilot\nphase (10 sites for one year) and a full-fledged stage (valley-wide for two years).\n26. Water Supply and Sanitation for the Poor.  Under the private sector lease contract,\nvarious targeted mechanisms are currently proposed on financial (e.g., affordable user charge,\nequitable tariff structure), institutional (e.g., NGO support, user groups), and technical (e.g., better\naccess to piped water, appropriate technology, easy maintenance) aspects. Discussions with\nstakeholders will determine specific approaches taken by the Project. These include the formation\nof a low-income customer service and education unit.\n27. Public Relations. The Project will launch a proactive public relations campaign, given the\nProject\u2019s high profile and potential public concerns that could jeopardize project implementation. \nThe campaign will (i) inform the beneficiaries and affected people about the Project to counter\nmisinformation; (ii) develop public support for the Project; (iii) identify any potential conflict area at\nan  early  stage  (to  feed  into  the  consensus  building  activities);  (iv)  assist  in  problem  solving\nbetween the Project and local communities; and (v) manage public expectation on compensation\nand the SUP.
