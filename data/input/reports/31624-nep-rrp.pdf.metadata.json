This  will  be  accomplished  by\ntapping  additional  water  resources  from  the  Melamchi  River,\nincreasing  the  water  treatment  capacity,  enhancing  access  to\nwater, and optimizing the use of existing water resources.  The\nProject  will  also  improve  the  living  conditions  of  the  people  in\nthe project area by mitigating direct and indirect project impacts\nand  channeling  benefits  to  the  beneficiaries  on  a  long-term\nbasis,  with  particular  emphasis  on  social  and  environmental\naspects.  The  Project  will  introduce  institutional  reforms  with  a\nview to ensuring sustainability of services.\n\nClassification\n\nPrimary: \nSecondary: Environment\n\nHuman Development\n\nEnvironment Assessment\n\nA\n\nCategory:\nA  summary  environmental  impact  assessment  was  circulated  to\nthe Board on 23 August 2000.\n\nRationale\n\nKathmandu Valley, an area of 500 square kilometers and home\nto about 1.5 million people, is the country\u2019s single largest urban\neconomy  and  is  critical  to  Nepal\u2019s  economic  growth.    Water  is\ncentral  to  the  well-being  of  the  population  and  the  key  to  its\nproductive  capacities.  However,  current  water  services  are\ngrossly  inadequate  and  unreliable;  many  people  must  resort  to\ntankered  supplies,  bottled  water,  and  both  deep  and  shallow\nwells. This trend has led to serious environmental concerns as\nshallow  wells  are  becoming  increasingly  polluted  and  deep\naquifers are being mined to secure additional water.  Poor water\nquality  impacts  sharply  on  public  health.  In  terms  of  access  to\nwater  (in  the  dry  season)  and  quality  of  water,  almost  all  the\npopulation  suffer,  but  the  effects  are  greatest  on  the  health  of\nthe poor.\n\nIn  addition,  a  strong  and  effective  utility  is  needed  to  manage\nwater in Kathmandu Valley.  Nepal Water Supply Corporation's\noperational  and  financial  situation  has  been  precarious,  mainly\ndue  to  lack  of  autonomy,  lack  of  water  to  distribute  and\ninefficient  use  of  existing  resources.  The  existing  institutional\nframework needs to be comprehensively overhauled to meet the\nvalley\u2019s water and wastewater requirements.\n\nThe Government has recognized that, with external assistance a\ncomprehensive,  but  least-cost  solution  has  to  be  found  to\nmitigate  the  capital  city\u2019s  most  serious  socioeconomic  problem.\nThe  Project  provides  the  required  opportunity  to  address  both\nthe  acute  socioeconomic  distress  caused  by  the  lack  of\nadequate  safe  water  to  Kathmandu  Valley  residents,  and  the\n\n\fObjectives and Scope\n\nCost Estimates\n\nFinancing Plan\n\niii\n\ninstitutional  challenges \nmanagement services on a sustainable basis.\n\nto  provide  water  and  wastewater\n\nto \n\nimprove \n\nThe  main  objectives  of  the  Project  are  to  alleviate  the  chronic\nwater shortage in Kathmandu Valley on a sustainable, long-term\nbasis,  and \nits\ninhabitants. The Project also seeks to develop a comprehensive\ninstitutional  framework  for  water  resource  management  within\nthe  valley.  The  Project  involves  the  transfer  of  water  from  the\nMelamchi  Valley  into  Kathmandu  Valley  through  a  diversion\nscheme with a 26-kilometer tunnel.\n\nthe  health  and  well-being  of \n\nsupport. \n\n(iv)  project \n\nimplementation \n\nThe  Project  comprises  four  parts:  (i)  infrastructure  development,\n(ii)  social  and  environmental  support;  (iii)  institutional  reforms,\nInfrastructure\nand \ndevelopment  will  include  the  Melamchi  diversion  scheme,  water\ntreatment  plant,  bulk  distribution  system,  distribution  networks,\nwastewater  system,  and  a  shallow  groundwater  well-field  in\nManohara. Social and environmental support will include a social\nuplift program to mitigate project impacts and channel benefits to\nbeneficiaries.  A  resettlement  action  plan  and  an  environmental\nmanagement plan will be implemented to reduce and monitor any\nadverse  social  and  environmental  impacts.  It  will  also  include\nhygiene education, and public awareness programs. Institutional\nreforms  include  establishing  a  regulatory  body,  introducing  a\nprivate sector lease contract, and setting up a Kathmandu Valley\nwater  authority  for  comprehensive  water  resource  management\nand  establishing  groundwater  licensing  in  Kathmandu  Valley.\nProject  implementation  support  will  assist  the  Government  in\nimplementing the Project.\n\nThe total cost of the Project is estimated at $464 million, including\ncontingencies and taxes.  The total foreign exchange cost is $273\nmillion  (59  percent)  and  the  local  currency  cost  is  $191  million\nequivalent (41 percent).\n\nSource\n\n  Foreign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal\nCost\n\nPercent\n\nADB\nWorld Bank\nJBIC\nNORAD\nSida\nNDF\nOPEC Fund\nJapan\nGovernment\n\nTotal\n\n($ million)\n27\n19\n6\n5\n5\n1\n6\n4\n118\n191\n\n93\n61\n46\n23\n20\n8\n8\n14\n0\n273\n\n120\n80\n52\n28\n25\n9\n14\n18\n118\n464\n\n25.9\n17.2\n11.2\n6.0\n5.4\n1.9\n3.0\n3.9\n25.4\n100\n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  JBIC  =  Japan  Bank  for  International\nCooperation, NDF = Nordic Development Fund, NORAD = Norwegian Agency\nfor  International  Cooperation,  OPEC  Fund  =  OPEC  Fund  for  International\nDevelopment,  Sida  =  Swedish \nInternational  Development  Cooperation\nAgency.\n\n\fLoan Amount and Terms\n\niv\n\nA  loan  for  SDR  93,253,000.00  ($120.0  million  equivalent)  is\nproposed  to  be  provided  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank's\n(ADB)  Special  Funds  resources  with  a  term  of  32  years,\nincluding a grace period of 8 years, and an interest charge of 1\npercent per annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per\nannum  thereafter.

Recognizing  the  urgent  need  to  augment\nwater supplies in Kathmandu Valley, ADB advised the Government that investment in physical\ninfrastructure  should  be  accompanied  by  major  reform  of  the  institutional  and  policy\nenvironment  governing  water  supply  in  the  valley.  Accordingly,  technical  assistance  (TA)  to\naddress urban water supply reforms in the valley was provided in March 1998.1 Subsequently,\nin November 1998, an engineering loan was approved by ADB2 to assist in preparing detailed\ndesigns for the bulk distribution system component of the Project; provide project management\nsupport; assess project justification in economic, financial, environmental and social terms; and\nundertake pilot work for artificial groundwater recharge in the valley. The work under this loan is\nexpected to be completed by June 2001.\n\nthe  scope,  cost  estimates, \n\nThe Fact-Finding Mission visited Nepal from 3-24 July 2000 to work with the Melamchi\n3.\nWater Supply Development Board (MWSDB) and to develop a consensus with the Government\nand  external  agencies  on \nimplementation\narrangements  for  the  Project.  Subsequently,  the  Appraisal  Mission3  visited  Nepal  from  17\nSeptember  to  4  October  2000  and  confirmed  various  project-  and  sector-related  agreements\nand  arrangements.  This  report  is  based  on  the  findings  of  ADB  missions,  consultations  with\nproject  beneficiaries,  reports  prepared  by  the  TA  and  loan  consultants,  discussions  with\n(NGOs),  and\nGovernment  ministries  and  departments,  nongovernment  organizations \nconsultations  with  external  agencies  involved  in  the  Project.  Appendix  1  presents  the  project\nframework.\n\nfinancing,  and \n\nIII. \n\nBACKGROUND\n\nA. \n\nSector Description\n\n1.\n\nDemographic Setting\n\nNepal is divided into three ecologically distinct regions: mountains, hills, and the Terai.4\n4.\nThese  regions  are  diverse  in  climate  and  topography,  as  well  as  in  socioeconomic  conditions\nand  cultural  practices.  Over  the  past  five  decades,  Nepal  has  been  gradually  urbanizing  as  a\nresult of the expansion of the nation\u2019s road network, the development of market centers, rural-\nurban migration, and the natural process of population growth and development. In less than 44\nyears,  the  population  has  increased  from  8  million  to  nearly  22  million.  In  contrast,  the  urban\npopulation increased tenfold(cid:190)\nfrom 238,000 to nearly 2.3 million. Although the urban population\nremains  relatively  small  compared  with  the  rural  population,  urban  growth  rates,  which\n                                                          \n1  TA 2998-NEP:  Urban Water Supply Reforms in Kathmandu Valley, for $800,000, approved on 16 March 1998.\n2    Loan  1640-NEP(SF):   Melamchi Water Supply (Engineering) Project,  for  $5  million,  approved  on  10  November\n\n1998.\n\n3  The Mission comprised A. C. McIntosh, Senior Project Engineer and Mission Leader; B. Fawcett, Senior Programs\nOfficer; A. Goswami, Counsel; K. Julian, Programs and Implementation Officer; A. Perdiguero, Project Economist;\nS. Tanaka, Social Development Specialist; C. Vita, Associate Operations Analyst; and I. Walker, Financial Analyst\nand Staff Consultant.\n\n4  Terai is the southern plain area bordering India.\n\n\f2\n\nincreased  the  urban  population  five  times  over  the  last  three  decades,  are  significant.\nKathmandu Valley, with an estimated 1 million urban dwellers and half a million rural dwellers, is\nleading the way in urbanization with an estimated annual growth rate of 4 percent.\n\n5.\nThe  country\u2019s  socioeconomic  structure  is  based  on  subsistence  agriculture  with  high\nunderemployment  and  low  agricultural  productivity.  Over  the  last  two  decades,  average  life\nexpectancy  in  Nepal  increased  by  13.5  years,  to  57  years,  which  is  the  lowest  in  South  Asia.\nThe life expectancy rate for women is lower than that for men. Infant mortality continues to be\nhigh,  with  one  of  every  10  children  dying  in  infancy.  Infants  in  rural  areas  are  exposed  to  a\nhigher risk of death than those in urban areas, and infants in the mountainous region are more\nthan twice as likely to die as those in the hilly and lowland regions.5 The incidence of maternal\nmortality is one of the highest in the world; the maternal morbidity rate is also high. Malnutrition\nis widespread, with over half of all households suffering from some degree of food insecurity.\n\nOn  average,  food  expenditure  accounts  for  62  percent  of  household  income,  leaving\n6.\ninsufficient  income  to  pay  for  health,  education,  and  other  necessities.  Although  legislation  on\nwomen's property rights has been drafted for consideration by Parliament, the gender disparity\nin  income  is  currently  acute  and  results  from  the  control  of  income  by  the  male  head  of  the\nhousehold  and  the  near  total  lack  of  property  rights  for  women.  The  disparity  in  assets  and\nincome  often  has  a  detrimental  effect  on  household  health,  nutrition,  education,  and  overall\nstandard of living.\n\n2.\n\nPoverty in the Kathmandu Valley\n\n7.\nConcern is increasing about the persistence of the high poverty incidence among the rural\npopulation  despite  the  Government\u2019s  large  development  expenditures,  assisted  by  external\nfunding agencies. The recent estimate indicates that 42 percent of the country\u2019s total population\nare  living  below  the  official  poverty  line.  According  to  the  Human  Development  Report  of  the\nUnited Nations Development Programme for 2000, Nepal ranks 144th of  174  countries, with its\nhuman development index estimated at 0.474. The poverty incidence is highest in rural areas and\nremote  districts.  Against  this  background,  poverty  reduction  is  the  primary  objective  of  the\nGovernment\u2019s  development  policy,  as  indicated  in  the  Government's  Ninth  Development  Plan\n(1997-2002).\n\n8.\nNepal\u2019s  poverty  is  characterized  by  social  exclusion  based  on  ethnicity,  and  gender.\nOccupational  castes  are  found  among  the  poorest,  while  women  suffer  more  from  being  in\npoverty  than  men  due  to  deprivation  of  access  to  education,  health,  productive  assets  and\nresources, and decision-making opportunities.\n\n9.\nAlthough no official estimates of the extent of poverty in Kathmandu Valley are available,\ndata  derived  from  the  Nepal  Living  Standards  Survey  of  1995/96  indicates  that  based  on  a\npoverty threshold of NRs9,000 per capita per annum, equivalent to about $122, the extent of the\nurban poor ranges from 10 to 13 percent. However, given that rents and other costs are higher\nin  Kathmandu  than  in  other  urban  areas  of  the  country,  12  to  15  percent  would  be  a\nconservative  estimate  of  urban  poverty  in  Kathmandu  Valley.  Nevertheless,  income  poverty\nalone is insufficient to understand the extent of poverty in the valley.\n\n10.\nMost of Kathmandu\u2019s poor live in very low quality houses, squatter settlements, or rented\naccommodation. Rental accommodation is occupied by a range of low-income groups, such as\ndaily  wage  earners,  hawkers,  and  partly  skilled  laborers.  Squatters  live  mainly  on  marginal\ngovernment-owned  land;  their  population  has  grown  considerably  and  is  now  estimated  at\n\n                                                          \n5 United Nations Development Programme. 1998. Nepal Human Development Report, 1998, Nepal South Asia\n\nCenter, Kathmandu.\n\n\f3\n\n18,000. Overall, most poor live in small settlements in the midst of higher\u2013income housing and,\nconsequently, are not very visible.\n\n11.\nAccess  to  reliable  water  supplies  is  a  problem  for  most  low-income  communities.\nReliance on public supplies from the Nepal Water Supply Corporation (NWSC) is minimal; most\nurban poor depend on private or traditional sources of supply. Shallow tubewells are a popular\nsource but these are usually contaminated and responsible for a variety of waterborne diseases.\nAbout 67 percent of the population believe that the quality of water supplied by NWSC is poor;\nalmost  72  percent  of  households  in  Kathmandu  Valley  treat  their  water  before  consumption.\nBoiling and filtering, the most common means of treatment, involve considerable expense and\nimpact mainly on the poor. Based on a 1999 survey undertaken during project preparation, 36\npercent of the households suffer from water-related diseases. Diarrhea, stomach ailments, and\ndysentery are the dominant health problems and impact significantly on productivity and income\nbecause of working days lost and treatment expenses. Although no data is officially available,\ndiarrhea  is  a  leading  cause  for  child  mortality  throughout  Nepal,  and  Kathmandu  Valley  in\nparticular.\n\n12.\nThe  hardships  in  accessing  water  in  Kathmandu  Valley  are  severe.  With  piped  water\nsupplies  limited  to  two  hours  every  alternate  day,  most  consumers,  and  particularly  the  poor,\nrely  on  secondary  sources.6  Although  the  time  spent  by  the  poor  in  accessing  water  for\ndomestic  use  varies,  approximately  an  hour  is  required.  A  number  of  domestic  functions  are\nundertaken at the water point to minimize the volume of water to be carried home. Women are\npredominantly  the  carriers  of  water.  Residents  of  low-income  areas  carry  home  only  about  10\nliters per person of water every day. This is insufficient to maintain basic hygiene and sanitation\nstandards, and is a prime cause of the high levels of morbidity and mortality.\n\nThe  project  area  also  covers  a  large  part  of  Sindhupalchok  District  and  a  small  part  of\n13.\nKabhre  Palanchok  District,  both  of  which  are  predominantly  rural  despite  their  proximity  to\nKathmandu.  The  poverty  incidence  in  Sindhupalchok  District  is  high  at  about  50-55  percent.\nEighty-five  percent  of  the  population  lives  at  subsistence  levels.  Small  landholding  size  (0.6\nhectare on average), physical remoteness due to topography and lack of roads, low agricultural\nproductivity, and poor access to health and education services perpetuate poverty in the district.\n\n3.\n\nNational Context of Water Supply\n\n14.\nNepal  has  abundant  water  resources.  It  possesses  about  2.3  percent  of  the  world\u2019s\nwater  resources  with  less  than  0.4  percent  of  the  world\u2019s  population.  However,  drinking  water\nsupplies  in  most  rural  and  urban  areas  are  inadequate  due  partly  to  lack  of  investment  in\nimproved  services,  but  also  as  a  result  of  failure  to  develop  sustainable  operation  and\nmanagement  of  those  services.  Coverage  of  adequate  water  supplies  and  sanitation  in  rural\nareas is estimated at 66 percent and 18 percent respectively; similar coverage in urban areas is\nestimated at 66 percent and 67 percent.\n\n4.\n\nSituation in Kathmandu Valley\n\nKathmandu  Valley,  which  includes  the  three  major  urban  centers  of  Kathmandu,\n15.\nBhaktapur,  and  Lalitpur  has  serious  problems  with  water  resources.  Due  to  deforestation  of\ncatchments, rapid runoff of rainfall occurs in the short wet season (June to August) and an acute\nshortage of water flow is experienced in the rivers during the longer dry season. This results in\nsevere  environmental  pollution  of  the  rivers,  particularly  the  Bagmati,  which  runs  through\nKathmandu.  In  recent  years,  as  a  result  of  the  seasonal  shortage  of  water,  industries  and  the\nwater utility itself, have resorted to extracting groundwater. Unfortunately, due to the number of\n                                                          \n6 Based on a 1999 survey undertaken during project preparation, 86 percent of the sampled NWSC consumers were\n\nusing secondary sources.\n\n\f4\n\nclay layers interspersed in the aquifer, most of the groundwater is not recharged naturally during\nthe  heavy  rainfalls  in  the  wet  season.  A  number  of  in-valley  alternatives  such  as  damming  of\ntributary  rivers  and  further  development  of  groundwater  have  been  explored.  But  these  are\nconstrained  by  social  and  technical  issues,  and  fail  to  provide  a  long-term  response  to  the\nmatter of increasing water demand.  While water use in Kathmandu Valley must be optimized,\nthe long-term solution must lie in developing out-of-valley resources.\n\n16.\nOne of the most serious concerns of the water supply situation in Kathmandu Valley is\nthe  unsanitary  conditions  created  partly  by  the  water  shortage  and  partly  by  the  apparent\nignorance  of  most  people  about  the  connection  between  water,  sanitation  hygiene,  and  their\nhealth.  Ninety  percent  of  the  people  surveyed  do  not  think  they  frequently  suffer  from  water-\nrelated diseases, but 36 percent are in fact experiencing these.\n\n17.\nThe current piped water supply demand in Kathmandu Valley is about 150 million liters\nper  day  (MLD),  but  the  combined  supply  of  groundwater  and  surface  water  in  the  dry  season\nvaries  between  65  and  85  MLD.  Even  in  the  wet  season,  the  supply  only  reaches  140  MLD.\nMany  people  resort  to  tankered  water,  costing  at  least  $1.00  per  cubic  meter.  Average  daily\nconsumption  is  around  70  liters  per  capita  as  compared  with  figures  of  around  150  liters  per\ncapita elsewhere in the region, i.e., the demand is constrained by the availability of water. The\npiped  water  supply  system  is  not  only  handicapped  by  inadequate  water  resources,  treatment\ncapacity  is  insufficient  and  the  bulk  distribution  system  is  inadequate.  Water  losses,  which\ncannot  be  accurately  measured  due  to  the  absence  of  24-hour  supply  and  nonfunctioning\nmeters, are estimated to range from 30 to 40 percent of production depending on the season.\nAnother consequence of the current situation is the exploitation of consumers (and the poor in\nparticular) by both the formal and informal providers of water in terms of price and availability.\n\nOf  the  seven  sewage  treatment  plants  (STPs)  in  Kathmandu  Valley,  four,  with  a\n18.\ncombined  capacity  of  19  MLD,  need  rehabilitation.  A  new  STP  with  a  capacity  of  17  MLD  is\nunder  construction.  Another  STP  treats  about  100  truckloads  per  day  of  septage  from  septic\ntanks. The sewer system is a combined one, taking storm water, septic tank effluent, and raw\nsewage. Many of these sewers discharge directly into the Bagmati River.\n\n5.\n\nInstitutional Arrangements and Sector Issues\n\n19.\nThe Ministry of Physical Planning and Works (MPPW) is responsible for all water supply\nand sanitation in the country. It reviews and approves sector plans, policies, and development\nbudgets. It also supervises several sector institutions, including the Department of Water Supply\nand  Sewerage  (DWSS),  NWSC,  the  Rural  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Fund  Board,  and  the\nTown  Development  Fund.  MPPW  also  oversees  the  MWSDB,  which  was  set  up  in  1998  to\nimplement the Project.\n\nNWSC has been responsible for most of the water supplies and sewerage in Kathmandu\n20.\nValley.  Unfortunately,  although  having  autonomy  in  terms  of  its  legislation,  in  practice  NWSC\nhas not been allowed to exercise it, either as a water utility or as an executing agency for the\nimplementation of major projects to improve water supplies and sewerage. Lack of political will\nto approve tariff increases, combined with an ever-deteriorating level of service, has meant that\nNWSC is no longer servicing its debts, which mostly derived from a number of loans from the\nWorld  Bank  over  the  last  30  years.  NWSC  has  suffered  from  having  four  different  general\nmanagers over the last four years, and is overstaffed. Staff morale is low and the level of skills\nexhibited  by  its  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  staff  is  poor.  Furthermore,  its  budget  has\nbeen inadequate to undertake proper maintenance. The need for NWSC to improve its service\nquality has been evident for several years. Recently, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City has been\nactive  in  developing  its  own  small  STPs  and  some  sewers.  The  Government  has  now\n\n\f5\n\nrecognized  that  some  form  of  private  involvement  in  Kathmandu  Valley\u2019s  water  supply\nmanagement is needed to improve service delivery.\n\n21.\nDWSS is concerned mainly with rural water supply and sanitation, and in operating a few\nurban water supply systems outside Kathmandu Valley. It is increasingly cognizant of its role to\nfacilitate rather than implement water and sanitation projects. Communities are involved in the\nplanning,  design,  construction,  O&M,  and  financing  of  water  supply  and  sanitation  schemes.\nHowever, more needs to be done to provide the right set of incentives for DWSS to effectively\norient itself to help local communities meet their water and sanitation needs.\n\nKey sector issues relate to good governance, private sector participation, cost recovery\n22.\nand  sustainability,  and  conservation  of  natural  resources.  The  absence  of  a  clearly  defined\npolicy for urban water supply and sewerage has handicapped sector progress, and prevented a\nregulatory body being established to oversee and guide the provision and delivery of quality and\naffordable water services to consumers. Given the current status of water supply in Kathmandu\nValley,  such  a  body  is  badly  needed.  A  related  sector  issue  is  private  participation,  which  is\nessential to improve service quality and efficiency, and to demonstrate the value that could be\nadded by involving the private sector in the discharge of public responsibilities.\n\n23. With regard to cost recovery, the current situation in Kathmandu Valley, comprising the\nabsence of adequate water resources and poor delivery, does not provide incentives for either\nthe  supplier  or  the  consumer  to  ensure  that  the  costs  of  an  inadequate  service  are  met.  This\nsituation is compounded by the absence of a clear statement on tariff policy. Also, the objective\nof providing equitable service to the poor remains unmet. The Government must take steps to\noutline a tariff policy based on full cost recovery, that ensures specific access to water for and\naffordability to the urban poor, and promotes demand management.\n\n24. Water  is  in  short  supply  in  the  valley.  Conserving  water  through  a  set  of  policies  that\nprovide  for  optimizing  water  use  and  ensuring  its  holistic  management  is  a  paramount\nconsideration.  The  sector  cannot  hope  to  develop  without  a  strong  conservation  bias.\nGroundwater  licensing  would  prevent  further  damage  to  the  depleted  aquifers  and  enable\nrecharge.  Industries  that  pollute  water  sources  and  are  water  intensive  need  to  be  relocated\noutside  the  valley  so  that  scarce  resources  are  optimally  used.  Also,  consumers  within  the\nvalley  need  to  develop  greater  consciousness  of  the  economic  value  of  water.  To  this  end,\nconsumers need to agree with the residents of Melamchi Valley on the payment of a levy for the\nuse of water from the Melamchi River. In institutional terms, the absence of a body to coordinate\nand guide water use within Kathmandu valley is inhibiting the holistic management of all water\nresources. A valleywide water authority is needed to manage water allocation and use.\n\nB. \n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\nThe Government\u2019s Ninth Development Plan  calls for sustainable development, effective\n25.\nservice delivery, and equitable access to water supply and sanitation services. Specifically, the\nninth  plan  advocates  (i)  mobilizing  local  resources  for  the  supply  of  safe  drinking  water;  (ii)\nprotecting  existing  water  sources;  (iii)  giving  priority  to  the  underprivileged;  (iv)  encouraging\nactive  involvement  of  user  groups;  (v) integrating  sanitation  programs  and  water  supply\nactivities;  (vi)  developing  simple \nthe  roles  and\nresponsibilities of existing institutions for effective and efficient service delivery and facilitation of\ndecentralized  operational  modalities;  (viii)  developing  NGOs,  community-based  organizations,\nand the private sector as partner organizations for overall sector development; (ix) making user\ngroups and local authorities responsible for project formulation, implementation and O&M; and\n(x)  developing  technical  and  institutional  capabilities  to  reduce  water  leakage  and  waste  in\nurban areas.\n\ntechnologies;  (vii)  redefining \n\nlow-cost \n\n\f6\n\n26.\nIn  April  1998,  the  Government  approved  a  national  water  supply  and  sanitation  policy,\nwith  the  main  objectives  of  extending  service  coverage,  maximizing  health  benefits,  and\naddressing gender concerns. While most of the policy statements are similar to those made in\nthe  ninth  plan,  the  newly  established  sector  policy  emphasizes  that  (i)  Government  agencies\nshould act as facilitators rather than implementers of water supply and sanitation projects, and\nsuch  facilitation should  take place at decentralized levels; (ii) the benefits of water supply and\nsanitation  projects  are  to  be  measured  in  terms  of  improved  health  and  reduced  suffering  for\nwomen and disadvantaged groups; (iii) the Government must retain certain roles to safeguard\nthe  public  interest,  such  as  coordinating  sector  activities,  regulating  water  resource  use,\nmonitoring  water  quality,  and  conducting  certain  aspects  of  utility  operations;  (iv)  community-\nbased  and  private  sector  approaches  to  the  provision  of  water  supply  and  sanitation  services\nare the most efficient and cost effective; and (v) water supply and sanitation is sustainable only\nif beneficiaries meet O&M needs.\n\nThe Government, with the assistance of the World Bank and the Canadian International\n27.\nDevelopment  Agency  (CIDA),  has  been  formulating  a  national  water  sector  strategy.  For\nKathmandu  Valley,  the  Government  has  developed  a  specific  water  supply  and  wastewater\nsector strategy (Appendix 2) based on integrating the needs of the people, and land and water\nuse.  The  vision  for  the  next  30  years  embraces  a  population  of  between  2.6  and  3.7  million\nwhich  is  restricted  by  planning  and  the  provision  of  services.  The  relocation  of  polluting  and\nwater-intensive industries, such as the carpet factories, outside of the valley will help. Likewise\nthe  development  of  small  towns,  including  their  water  supplies,  will  help  to  stem  the  flow  of\nurban  migration  to  Kathmandu  Valley.  Strict  adherence  to  an  agreed  land-use  plan  will  be\nneeded to allow the population density to be controlled. This in turn, will lead to a better quality\nof life.\n\n28. Water demand in Kathmandu Valley is estimated to reach 600 MLD by 2030, inclusive of\nindustrial  water  use.  This  is  likely  to  be  met  from  about  150 MLD  of  surface  and  groundwater\nresources  within  the  valley  and  450  MLD  from  surface  waters  in  the  Melamchi,  Yangri,  and\nLarke  river  basins.  Conjunctive  use  of  surface  and  groundwater  is  envisaged,  where  the\nsustainable yield of groundwater inside the valley is not exceeded. Part of the sector strategy is\nto  optimize  the  use  of  water  within  the  valley.  This  will  entail  development  of  rainwater\nharvesting, farmers' trading water rights, and demand management by pricing and awareness;\nreduction of piped water losses; wastewater recycling and storage of wet season water for dry\nseason use. For wastewater, the development vision includes, in the short term, an accent on\nrehabilitating existing facilities; increasing numbers of public toilets; improving operation of on-\nsite  sanitation,  including  desludging  and  treatment  of  septage;  and  introducing  wetlands\ntreatment of grey water.\n\n29.\nFundamental  to  the  valley  sector  strategy,  is  the  concept  of  comprehensive  water\nresource  management  under  a  future  Kathmandu  Valley  water  authority  (KVWA),  which  will\nrepresent  the  local  authorities  and  be  responsible  for  the  conservation,  development,  and\nmanagement of all surface water and groundwater, including use for water supply and irrigation,\nand disposal of wastewater including pollution control. The authority will be encouraged to use\nthe  private  sector  to  manage  and  develop  water  supply  and  wastewater  services.    A  water\nsupply and sanitation regulatory body will be established initially for Kathmandu Valley and later\nfor the whole of Nepal. The strategy for cost recovery for water supply services in the valley is\nthat  full  cost  recovery,  including  revenues  from  tariffs  covering  all  future  investments,  will  be\nphased  in  by  2010.  For  wastewater  disposal,  in  the  near  future  only  O&M  costs  will  be\nrecovered  through  tariffs,  but  this  will  be  extended  to  include  debt  servicing  and  greater\nrecovery of investment costs in a phased manner. Groundwater licensing will be introduced in\nthe immediate future and major industrial users will be required to pay for water consumed on a\nvolume basis.\n\n\fC. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n7\n\nMajor external assistance for rural water supply and sanitation started in the 1970s and\n30.\naccelerated  in  the  1980s  with  the  launch  of  the  International  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation\nDecade  (1980-1990).  Earlier,  the  World  Bank  and,  more  recently,  ADB  have  been  the  lead\nexternal  funding  agencies.  ADB  has  provided  four  loans  since  1984  for  a  total  of  $63  million,\ncovering about 3 million rural population in the Eastern, Midwestern and Far Western regions.\nOf the four ADB financed-projects, three are completed and the fourth is progressing well. Apart\nfrom  ADB,  the  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  and  the  governments  of  Finland,  Switzerland,\nand  the  United  Kingdom  have  also  provided  assistance  for  the  development  of  rural  water\nsupply  and  sanitation.  More  recently,  the  World  Bank  assisted  in  establishing  a  rural  water\nsupply  and  sanitation  development  fund  board,  which  has  been  active  in  implementing\ncommunity-based and demand-responsive rural water supply and sanitation schemes.\n\nIn  September  2000,  ADB  approved  a  loan  for  the  Small  Towns  Water  Supply  and\n31.\nSanitation Sector Project.7 The project will improve water supply and sanitation conditions in 40-\n50 small towns with an average population of 12,000 per town. Water users will contribute 50\npercent of subproject costs in cash and kind. The project represents a special effort by ADB to\npromote participatory development and the Government\u2019s decentralization agenda.8\n\n32.\nIn  the  urban  water  supply  and  sanitation  sector,  the  World  Bank  has  been  providing\ncredits  to  NWSC  since  the  late  1970s.  Much  of  this  assistance  has  centered  on  Greater\nKathmandu water supply and sanitation, and is expected to continue with support to the Project\nthrough  the  proposed  private  sector  lease  contract,  distribution  rehabilitation,  and  distribution\nexpansion. The Government of Japan has also provided much development assistance to the\nsector, including support for the construction of two water treatment plants in Kathmandu Valley.\nDetails of external assistance to the sector are presented in Appendix 3.\n\nD. \n\nLessons Learned\n\n33.\nValuable  lessons  have  been  learned  from  ADB's  assistance  to  the  country  and  sector.\nCountrywide  lessons  are  reported  in  the  1999  Country  Synthesis  of  Evaluation  Findings.9  The\nkey lessons include the following:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv)\n\nParticipation  of  local  communities  during  both  design  and  implementation  is\ncrucial for project sustainability and success.\n\nProject  design  should  institute  appropriate  O&M  mechanisms  and  properly\ndelineate responsibilities.\n\nGood  governance  and  anticorruption  measures  contribute  to  a  more  favorable\nproject implementation environment.\n\nPrivate  sector  participation  should  be  encouraged,  especially  in  the  marketing,\ndistribution, and maintenance of project outputs.\n\n34.\nThe lessons learned from World Bank experience in the sector in Kathmandu Valley are\nprimarily that legislating autonomy for an institution such as NWSC does not necessarily make it\na  good  water  utility,  nor  a  good  executing  agency,  if  no  political  support  exists  for  that\n\n                                                          \n7  Loan  1755-NEP:  Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project,  for  $35  million,  approved  on  12\n\nSeptember 2000.\n\n8 At  the  request  of  the  Government,  and  in  line  with  ADB's  sector  strategy,  ADB  is  also  preparing  an  urban\n\nenvironmental improvement project aimed at Kathmandu Valley satellite towns.\n\n9  ADB, 1999. Nepal: 1999 Country Synthesis of Evaluation Findings, Manila.\n\n\f8\n\nautonomy.  Also,  investment  in  physical  infrastructure  needs  to  be  properly  sequenced  with\ninstitutional  reform.  Trying  to  achieve  reforms  in  parallel  with  investment  did  not  prove\nsuccessful,  as  the  implementing  agency's  focus  was  on  setting  physical  targets,  while\ninstitutional  change  was  marginalized.  The  lessons  learned  have  been  incorporated  in  project\ndesign  by  ensuring  that  (i)  a  transparent  and  pro-poor  tariff  policy  will  be  endorsed  by  the\nGovernment, (ii) a water supply and sanitation regulatory body will be established to implement\npolicy in the valley, and (iii) a private sector contract will be awarded to manage water supply\nand  sewerage  in  the  valley.  However,  major  investments  in  the  distribution  system  will  be\nsubject to satisfactory performance of the lease contract.\n\nLessons  that  ADB  has  learned  from  its  experience  in  the  urban  water  supply  sector\n35.\nelsewhere in Asia can also be applied to this Project. Tariffs are the lifeblood of a utility. Tariffs\nensure  revenues  that  translate  into  the  ability  to  provide  and  maintain  high-quality  service  to\nconsumers.  The  notion  that  the  poor  cannot  pay  for  water  is  a  myth.  Invariably,  the  poor  pay\nmore for water on a unit basis than the more affluent, because they must procure water by the\ncontainer rather than through a piped supply to their homes. The scarcity of water in Kathmandu\nValley illustrates that water is an economic good. Tariffs that recover full costs ensure that water\nconsumption is controlled, and the burden of subsidy on the Government is reduced.\n\nE. \n\nADB's Sector Strategy\n\n36.\nThe  primary  objective  of  ADB\u2019s  operational  strategy  in  Nepal  is  to  achieve  sustainable\npoverty  reduction.  To  achieve  this,  ADB  interventions  aim  to  improve  efficiency,  predictability,\ntransparency,  and  accountability  in  key  institutions  responsible  for  delivering  services,  while\nreducing  poverty  through  equitable  access  to  basic  social  services  to  enhance  human\ndevelopment. ADB\u2019s sector strategy for water supply and sanitation supports the Government\u2019s\nstrategy.  The  most  important  elements  are  (i)  establishing  comprehensive  water  resource\nmanagement  of  river  basins;  (ii)  establishing  transparent  government  policy;  (iii)  implementing\nregulatory control of the sector, especially for levels of service, cost recovery, and maintenance;\n(iv) using the private sector for both development and management; and (v) taking care of the\nurban  poor.  ADB  will  continue  to  support  rural  and  small  towns  water  supply  and  sanitation.\nInvestments  in  wastewater  may  be  considered  for  Kathmandu  Valley  during  2006-2008  to\nsupport  the  private  sector  managed  utility  in  attaining  self-sufficiency.  ADB  is  also  providing\nregional  TA  to  support  (i)  the  establishment  of  regulatory  systems  and  networking  of  water\nutilities  and  regulatory  bodies,  and  (ii)  private  sector  delivery  of  water  supply  and  sanitation\nservices  (and  solid  waste  disposal)  to  the  urban  poor.  ADB  and  CIDA  are  considering\ncofinancing a TA grant to study optimizing water use in Kathmandu Valley.\n\nF. \n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\n37.\nIn  the  course  of  project  preparation,  ADB  staff  actively  engaged  the  Government  in\npolicy  dialogue.  The  dialogue  focused  on  four  areas:  good  governance,  private  sector\nparticipation, cost recovery, and conservation of natural resources.\n\n1.\n\nGood Governance\n\n38.\nPolicy dialogue has led to (i) the establishment of MWSDB as an autonomous body to\nimplement  the  Project;  (ii)  the  acceptance  of  an  independent  regulatory  body  to  administer\nGovernment policy on water supply and sanitation in Kathmandu Valley; and (iii) the acceptance\nof KVWA to be responsible to local authorities for comprehensive water resource management\nof  Kathmandu  Valley.  These  reforms  support  the  national  process  of  civil  service  reform  and\ngood governance being implemented in parallel through other ADB operations, as governance\nis  being  devolved  to  local  authorities  and  the  private  sector,  and  more  transparency  and\naccountability is being introduced. Furthermore, the private sector will be given the opportunity\n\n\f9\n\nto show how it can implement development more efficiently than the Government. Because of\nthis,  a  lease  contract  rather  than  a  pure  management  contract  will  be  introduced  for  the\nmanagement of the Kathmandu Valley urban water supply and sewerage. The policy dialogue\nto  set  up  KVWA  has  been  ongoing  as  the  concept  was  first  introduced  under  TA  2998-NEP\n(footnote 1), which was implemented from January 1999 to July 2000. Stakeholder participation\nhas been a feature of the process.\n\n39.\nADB has strongly promoted good governance in the sector through (i) clear definition of\ngovernment  policy;  (ii)  an  independent  regulatory  body  to  implement  that  policy;  (iii)\ncomprehensive water resource management at the local authority level; and (iv) implementation\nof policy and plans, and O&M by the private sector. ADB has recommended that at least one of\nthe  members  of  the  regulatory  body  to  be  a  female.  A  strong  effort  has  been  made  to  move\naway  from  regulation  by  contract  to  having  a  regulatory  body  in  place  prior  to  award  of  any\nprivate sector contract. The main emphasis will be on implementation of tariff policy and service\nstandards.\n\n2.\n\nPrivate Sector Participation\n\nPrivate  sector  participation  was  a  prerequisite  for  ADB's  involvement  in  the  Project.  A\n40.\nprivate  sector  lease  of  10  years  for  the  Kathmandu  Valley  water  supply,  treatment,  and\ndistribution is due for award in September 2001. The Project facilities are also expected to be\nmanaged by the private sector operator from 2006. While private sector participation in general\nhas  been  a  project  precondition  by  external  funding  agencies,  the  nature  of  the  contract  has\nbeen crafted through a participatory approach in which Government, NWSC, the private sector,\nand the external funding agencies have been able to contribute to a common goal. ADB's main\nconcerns  have  centered  on  the  objectives  of  the  lease  contract  and  matching  performance  to\nthose  objectives.  One  of  those  objectives  is  the  equitable  distribution  of  water,  this  entails\nensuring that the poor have equal access to water and are not disadvantaged in terms of unit\ncost.\n\n3.\n\nCost Recovery and Sustainability\n\n41.\nIn  South  Asia,  the  concept  of  water  as  a  social  good  prevails  over  that  of  water  as  an\neconomic good. The transition from one to another generally comes about as a result of water\nshortage as is now the case in Kathmandu Valley. The Government has embraced the concept\nof full cost recovery for the water supplies to be phased in with the Project. Its agreement to a\n50:50 loan-grant ratio for relending of funds to the utility can be compared with the same terms\nfor  a  much  better-off  water  and  drainage  utility  in  Sri  Lanka.  Tariff  principles  agreed  with  the\nGovernment include the need for cost recovery, demand management, specific access to water\nfor and affordability to the urban poor, and easy means for payment of water bills. Cost recovery\nwill  mean  all  O&M  costs  are  recovered  pre-Project  and  all  O&M  plus  debt  service  costs  are\nrecovered post-Project. In the policy dialogue, ADB agreed with the Government that the private\noperator will not be allowed to sell water in bulk where the resale by vendors is at a unit cost\nmore than would be paid by the more affluent with house connections.\n\n4.\n\nConservation of Natural Resources\n\n42.\nPolicy  dialogue  has  led  to  acceptance  of  (i)  groundwater  licensing  and  charging  in\nKathmandu Valley; (ii) the payment of a levy by Kathmandu Valley consumers to the people of\nMelamchi Valley for use of their water; (iii) allowing KVWA to holistically manage all the water in\nKathmandu Valley, and thus preserve the quality and quantity of the resource; (iv) promotion of\nthe relocation of polluting and water intensive industries outside of Kathmandu Valley; and (v)\nthe  policy  to  optimize  water  use  in  Kathmandu  Valley  as  a  necessary  step  to  be  taken  before\nand  in  tandem  with  the  use  of  water  from  the  Melamchi  River.  These  are  all  major  reforms  in\n\n\f10\n\nterms of what is being done elsewhere in Asia. The Government\u2019s readiness to embrace these\nreforms adds credence to its commitment to the Project and the sector. Groundwater licensing\nis  necessary  to  ensure  long-term  sustainability  of  this  resource  while  used  conjunctively  with\nsurface  sources.  The  levy  on  the  water  tariff  for  consumers  in  Kathmandu  Valley  is  a  visible\nacknowledgement by the Government that it is unfair to take from one area of the country and\ngive to another without appropriate compensation. Consensus-building dialogue will be needed\nbetween the Government, and the people of Melamchi Valley during 2001 to reach agreement\non the amount of the levy. Establishing KVWA is an ambitious reform measure, but as agreed\nwith  the  Government  this  can  be  phased  in  progressively  so  that  KVWA\u2019s  functions  increase\nwith time. ADB will also provide (together with CIDA) TA for optimizing water use in Kathmandu\nValley\u2014whereby new sources of supply (such as rainwater harvesting) will be developed, and\ndata on sources and demand will be continually refined under a computerized model so that the\nconjunctive use of surface and groundwater can be carefully managed.\n\nG.\n\nProject History\n\n43.\nThe  Project\u2019s  history  dates  to  1988  when  a  prefeasibility  study  was  undertaken  to\ninvestigate  out-of-valley  water  resources.  It  examined  several  options  and  three  types  of\nschemes, i.e., gravity, pumped, and storage. The Melamchi Valley had the best combination of\neconomy  and  yield  to  meet  the  design  target  of  2  cubic  meter  (m3)/second  (s)  and  be\nexpandable\u2014all based on gravity supply. From a plain reading of the map, diverting water from\nthe  Indrawati  River,  the  closest  water  source  to  Kathmandu  Valley,  appears  logical.  However,\nthis option was ruled out because the elevation of the river is about 500 meters below the valley\nand  would  involve  high-pumping  costs  in  perpetuity.  In  1992,  a  full  feasibility  study  was\ncompleted showing that the development of the Melamchi River, followed by later developments\nof the adjacent Yangri and Larke rivers, was technically, socially, environmentally, economically,\nand financially feasible and the least-cost solution to providing water to Kathmandu Valley in the\nforeseeable future.\n\nBetween 1996 and 1999, options to include hydropower in the Project were considered\n44.\nbut  were  finally  rejected  in  2000  on  environmental  grounds.  In-valley  alternatives  that  were\nseriously  considered  include  (i)  damming  of  in-valley  rivers\u2014rejected  due  to  low  yield  and\ncommunity objections, (ii) major in-valley storage\u2014rejected due to technical problems of water\nretention  and  public  safety,  and  (iii)  trading  of  water  rights\u2014rejected  on  social  grounds.\nAppendix 4 gives more details of the Project\u2019s history.\n\nIV.\n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\n45.\nKathmandu Valley, an area of 500 square kilometers (km) and home to about 1.5 million\npeople, is the country\u2019s single largest urban economy and critical to Nepal\u2019s economic growth.\nOver 86 percent of its residents are engaged in urban-based employment with 55 percent being\nself-employed.  About  15  percent  of  the  urban  population  is  poor  and  income  disparities  are\nhigh. Population growth is increasing at an annual rate of approximately 4 percent. This coupled\nwith  an  increase  in  incomes,  is  imposing  extraordinary  demands  on  basic  water  supplies  and\nwastewater management services.\n\n46. Water is central to the well-being of the valley\u2019s population and the key to its  productive\ncapacity.    Currently,  water  services  are  grossly  inadequate  and  unreliable.  Water  supplies  to\nregistered  consumers  (about  86  percent  of  the  population)  are  no  more  than  two  hours  every\nalternate day in the dry season.  About 35 of the 112 municipal wards do not get any water in\nthe  last  2-3  months  of  the  dry  season.  Only  about  a  third  of  NWSC\u2019s  consumers  have  fully\nplumbed  facilities;  the  rest  rely  on  yard  taps  and  shared  facilities  such  as  standposts.  Recent\n\n\f11\n\nstudies show that without individual connections, the scope for improvements in public health is\nlimited. In the dry season, many consumers have to resort to tankered supplies (at costs up to\n$1.00 per cubic meter [m3]), bottled water, and deep wells. Serious environmental problems are\nemerging  because  of  the  shortages,  as  shallow  wells  are  becoming  increasingly  polluted  and\ndeep aquifers are being mined in an effort to secure additional water.\n\nPoor water quality impacts sharply on public health. Surveys show that the incidence of\n47.\ndiarrhea  is  almost  50  percent,  stomach  pain  23  percent,  and  dysentery  15  percent.  Skin\ndiseases,  hepatitis,  and  malaria  are  also  common.    While  details  are  not  available,  empirical\nevidence suggests that the impact of water-borne diseases on morbidity and mortality rates is\nhigh.  Productivity is affected by sick time lost on account of water-borne diseases.\n\n48.\nThe  shortage  of  water  impacts  particularly  on  the  poor.  While  access  in  terms  of\ndistance and time of availability is inadequate, the quality of water from various sources has the\nmost  serious  impacts  on  the  health  of  the  poor.  Almost  50  percent  of  the  water  sources  are\ncontaminated  by  fecal  coliforms.  Poor  water  management  produces  severe  hardships  for  low-\nincome groups.  The average time spent on water collection in informal settlements is one hour\nper trip. Households in these settlements often have to collect water between 1 and 15 times a\nday. Individual low-income renters are particularly disadvantaged as they depend on landlords\nfor water services and are not supported by the community.\n\n49.\nCoupled  with  the  lack  of  adequate  water  supplies  and  wastewater  facilities  is  the\nabsence of a strong and effective public utility to serve the valley\u2019s needs.  NWSC has been in a\nprecarious operational and financial situation due mainly to a lack of autonomy, lack of water to\ndistribute and inefficient use of existing resources. The current institutional framework to meet\nand  manage  Kathmandu  Valley\u2019s  water  and  wastewater  requirements  needs \nto  be\ncomprehensively overhauled.\n\n50.\nThe Government has recognized that an urgent, comprehensive, but least-cost solution\nhas  to  be  found  to  mitigate  the  capital  city\u2019s  most  serious  socioeconomic  problems  and  has\narticulated  a  strategic  approach  to  meet  the  challenge.  Its  essential  components  are  (i)\noptimization of water use in Kathmandu Valley; (ii) development of new water sources outside\nthe  valley;  (iii)  developing  an  institutional  framework  for  comprehensive  water  resource\nmanagement and private sector operations; (iv) ensuring sustainability through full cost recovery\nand  demand  management;  (v)  integrating  improvements  in  water  services  with  other  urban\nsector  developments  in  the  valley;  and  (vi)  adopting  a  people-based  approach  where  public\nawareness, public relations, and hygiene education are continuing activities.\n\n51.\nThe Project provides the required opportunity to address both the acute socioeconomic\ndistress  caused  by  the  lack  of  adequate  safe  water  to  valley  residents,  and  the  institutional\nchallenges to providing water and wastewater management services on a sustainable basis to\nthe  valley\u2019s  population.  External  assistance  is  needed  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  plans  and\nstrategies to augment the supply of water to the valley, improve water supply and wastewater\nmanagement  services,  and  build  institutional  arrangements  that  will  effectively  sustain  the\nservices.\n\nB.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n52.\nThe  main  objectives  of  the  Project  are  to  alleviate  the  chronic  water  shortage  in\nKathmandu Valley on a sustainable, long-term basis, and to improve the health and well-being\nof  its  inhabitants,  particularly  the  poor.  The  Project  also  seeks  to  develop  a  comprehensive\ninstitutional framework for water resource management within the valley. The Project comprises\nfour parts.\n\n\f1.\n\nInfrastructure Development\n\n12\n\nThe  Melamchi  Diversion  Scheme  (MDS)  will  bring  170  MLD  of  raw  water  from  the\n53.\nMelamchi River into Kathmandu Valley through a 26 km tunnel.  About 25 km of access roads\nwill be built and 29 km of existing roads upgraded to facilitate construction and maintenance of\nthe project facilities.  A water treatment plant (WTP) with an initial capacity of 170 MLD, but with\nprovision for expansion to 510 MLD will be built to treat the water diverted from the Melamchi\nRiver into Kathmandu Valley.  A bulk distribution system (BDS) will be established comprising\nservice reservoirs strategically located in the valley and bulk supply pipelines to the reservoirs\nfrom  the  WTP.  Distribution  networks  will  be  rehabilitated  and  improved  at  primary,  secondary,\nand  tertiary  levels.  Wastewater  system  improvements  will  also  be  undertaken  in  a  phased\nmanner.  A  shallow  groundwater  well  field  will  be  developed  at  Manohara  within  the  valley  to\nextract, treat, and distribute 15 MLD of water in the dry season and 25 MLD in the wet season.\n\n2.\n\nSocial and Environmental Support\n\n54.\nA  social  uplift  program  (SUP)  will  be  undertaken  to  mitigate  direct  and  indirect  project\nimpacts, and to channel benefits to Melamchi Valley on a long-term basis to improve the living\nconditions of the people in the area. It will include buffer zone development, rural electrification,\nhealth,  education,  and  income  generation  and  community  development.  Separately,  hygiene\neducation, and public awareness and relations programs will be developed and implemented.  A\nresettlement  action  plan  (RAP),  estimated  to  cost  $15.8  million,  was  developed  and  will  be\nimplemented  in  conjunction  with  the  Project.  An  environmental  management  plan  will  also  be\nimplemented  to  mitigate  any  adverse  environmental  impacts  and  to  monitor  progress.  A  third\nparty  monitoring  program  will  closely  monitor  implementation  of  the  RAP  and  environment\nmanagement  plan.  A  hygiene  education  and  promotion  program  (HEPP)  will  be  provided  in\nKathmandu Valley. A groundwater monitoring program to ensure that the valley\u2019s groundwater\nresources are sustainably tapped has been designed and is being implemented. A web-site will\nbe developed in the local language to make project information available to the general public.\n\n3. \n\nInstitutional Reforms\n\n55.\nThe Project provides an opportunity to introduce major institutional reforms for enhanced\nefficiencies  in  the  management  of  water  and  wastewater  in  Kathmandu  Valley.  A  regulatory\nbody  for  water  supply  and  sanitation  will  be  established,  having  at  least  one  female  member,\ninitially  for  the  valley  and  later  for  the  country.  Private  sector  management  of  urban  water\nsupplies  from  source  to  consumer,  and  sewerage  from  consumer  to  outfall  will  be  introduced\nthrough  an  initial  10-year  lease  contract.  KVWA  will  be  established  to  provide  comprehensive\nwater  resource  management  in  the  valley  including  that  for  groundwater,  surface  water,\ndomestic  water  supply,  and  irrigation.  KVWA  will  be  a  small,  professional  body  that  lets  out\ncontracts  to  the  private  sector  for  implementation  of  its  policies  and  plans.  When  the  private\noperator's  lease  contract  is  renegotiated  after  5  years,  KVWA  will  be  a  counter-party  to  the\ncontract. Finally, groundwater licensing will be introduced in Kathmandu Valley to facilitate the\ncontrolled extraction of groundwater.\n\n4.\n\nProject Implementation Support\n\n56.\nThis  will  comprise  establishing  a  project  management  unit  (PMU)  with  government\ncounterpart staff, and international and domestic consultants. The MWSDB will be responsible\nfor  overall  project  management,  coordinating  the  work  under  the  various  components.\nConsultants  will  support  the  PMU  in  carrying  out  various  project  administration  activities\nincluding  monitoring  of  construction  supervision,  social  and  environmental  activities,  contract\nadministration,  and  project  accounting.  About  234  person-months  of  international  consulting\nsupport and 846 person-months of domestic consulting support will be provided.\n\n\fC.\n\nTechnical Justification\n\n13\n\n57. Water  is  acutely  short  in  Kathmandu  Valley.  In  the  dry  season,  the  combined  surface\nand  groundwater  production  for  public  use  is  as  low  as  65  MLD,  amounting  to  an  average\nconsumption for the 1 million people connected to the piped supply of about 46 liters per capita\nper day (lpcpd) after accounting for system losses. In the wet season, production can increase\nto  120  MLD,  but  losses  increase  to  at  least  40  percent  of  production,  implying  that  average\nconsumption from the piped water supply is still only about 72 lpcpd. Also, water is not equitably\ndistributed,  so  at  least  one  quarter  of  the  people  connected  to  the  piped  water  supply  system\nnever get piped water in the dry season. Another disturbing factor in the present situation is that\nmore  than  half  of  the  production  comes  from  groundwater,  yet  it  has  an  average  sustainable\nyield of only about 15 MLD from deep tubewells. This means most of the groundwater extraction\nis  mining.  Other  cities  in  Asia  have  learned  that  this  can  lead  to  serious  land  subsidence\nproblems.\n\nindependent \n\n58.\nThree interlinked solutions to the problem are available. First, a transparent Government\npolicy on tariffs made known to the consumers, the funding agencies, and the utility is required.\nto  monitor  policy\nSecond,  an \nimplementation,  and  in  particular  decide  if  tariff  revisions  requested  by  the  utility  conform  with\nthe policy. Third, a legal contract with the private sector to manage the water supplies should be\nput in place. The Project is designed around the three identified solutions. Phasing of the project\nfunding10 will provide leverage to ensure that the solutions are properly implemented.\n\nregulatory  body  should  be  established \n\n59. With regard to the harnessing of additional water, use of water in the Kathmandu Valley\nmust  be  optimized.  This  is  possible  through  (i)  damming  some  of  the  rivers  that  feed  into  the\nvalley  to  store  wet  season  flows  for  use  in  the  dry  season,  (ii)  excavating  shallow  Sri  Lankan\nstyle tanks for the same purpose, (iii) trading water rights with farmers, (iv) harvesting rainwater,\nand  (v)  recycling  wastewater.  These  possibilities  were  examined  in  the  context  of  least-cost\nalternatives, current and anticipated social and political realities, and the likely speed of reforms.\nWhen out-of-valley alternatives were looked at, the Melamchi option was identified as the most\npromising.  However,  the  pursuit  to  optimize  water  use  should  not  be  postponed;  the  Project\nallows  more  time  to  fully  study  the  possibilities.  Meanwhile,  demand  management,  crucial  to\noptimizing  water  use,  will  be  introduced  using  relatively  high  tariffs,  post-Project,  which  will\nmake demand price elastic.\n\n60.\nFollowing  the  visit  of  a  panel  of  experts  (POE),  agreement  was  reached  that  the  MDS\ntunnel  would  be  best  operated  as  a  pressure  tunnel  with  provision  for  periodic  desilting  and\nadequate  air  vents.  For  both  hydraulic  and  construction  purposes,  the  minimum  tunnel  cross-\nsectional area will be 10.7 square meters (m2). Drill and blast methods for tunnel boring will be\nemployed. The intake is best located where the weir crest is at 1,425 m due to the poor geology\nand the topography at the slightly higher intake site.\n\n61.\nThe water treatment plant is expected to be of conventional design. Land acquisition will\nbe  minimized  even  though  a  future  design  capacity  of  510  MLD  is  assumed.  Stable  and\ncontinuous water supply for the WTP will be taken into account in terms of tunnel maintenance.\n\n62.\nThe bulk distribution system was designed for 255 MLD capacity because it will take not\nonly  the  Melamchi  water  (170  MLD)  but  also  existing  supplies  of  85  MLD.  The  BDS  will  be\nduplicated  at  the  time  of  harnessing  the  Yangri  River.  The  design  incorporates  potential  for\nclosing  the  bulk  distribution  to  make  a  complete  ring  main;  this  will  improve  distribution\nefficiency and reliability.\n                                                          \n10 The  World  Bank  will  consider  providing  an  additional  $65  million  for  the  Project  in  2003  subject  to  satisfactory\n\nimplementation of policy and institutional reforms and good progress on the private sector lease contract.\n\n\f14\n\n63.\nImprovements to the distribution system await the appointment of the private operator in\n2001. Effective metering of all consumers is needed as is mapping of the distribution network.\nThe  private  operator  will  be  expected  to  undertake  considerable  training  of  the  utility  staff,  as\ninadequate staff capacity was identified as a serious constraint. Also it will be necessary for the\ncontractor  to  link  any  new  connections  with  increases  in  production  capacity  and  reduction  of\nlosses. By fixing visible leaks coverage of 24-hour supply may be available pre-Project, but full\ncoverage with a 24-hour supply is not expected until project completion.\n\n64.\nThree  factors  will  influence  the  nature  and  extent  of  wastewater  improvements  to  be\neffected  under  this  Project.  The  first  is  the  need  to  make  what  has  already  been  put  in  place\nwork well. That includes rehabilitating existing STPs and sewers, and ensuring proper collection\nand  treatment  of  septage  from  septic  tanks.  The  second  is  the  need  to  look  at  more  on-site\nsanitation and natural treatment of wastewater. The third is that large-scale sewerage schemes\nwith more STPs would be too costly for the Government to implement simultaneously with the\nProject.\n\nD.\n\nCost Estimates\n\n65.\nThe  Project  is  estimated  to  cost  $464  million  including  contingencies,  interest  during\nconstruction, and taxes and duties. Foreign exchange costs are estimated at 59 percent of total\ncosts;  local  currency  costs  at  41  percent.  The  main  cost  items  (base  costs)  are  the  MDS\n($74.29  million),  WTP  ($39.33  million),  BDS  ($48.47  million),  and  the  distribution  network\nimprovements ($65.95 million). Table 1 gives a summary of the estimated costs; details are in\nAppendix 5.\n\nTable 1: Cost Estimates\n($ million)\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal\nCost\n\nItem\n\nA. Base\n\n1.

An  ADB  loan  for  $120  million  is\nproposed to finance costs relating to the MDS, SUP, BDS, wastewater system improvements,\nproject  management,  and  other  social  and  environmental  improvements.  The  loan  will  finance\nabout 26 percent of the total project cost, including 34 percent of foreign exchange costs ($93\nmillion), and 14 percent of the local currency costs ($27 million). It will be provided from ADB\u2019s\nSpecial Funds resources, be repayable over 32 years including 8 years of grace, carry interest\nat 1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent thereafter.\n\n67.\nThe local cost financing being provided by ADB for the Project is justified on country and\nproject  considerations.  Nepal  relies  on  development  assistance  for  about  50  percent  of  its\nannual development expenditures. While the budget deficit remains stable from year to year at\nabout 3.9 percent of gross domestic product, the inflow of aid funds is required to finance the\nforeign  and  local  cost  components  of  development  projects.  The  proposed  level  of  local  cost\nfinancing  is  justified  based  on  the  Government\u2019s  weak  revenue  generation  capacity  and  the\nneed    for  donor  assistance  to  meet  financing  requirements,  particularly  for  large  infrastructure\nprojects. The Government accords top priority to the Project as it will alleviate the acute water\nshortage  in  Kathmandu  Valley  and  reduce  the  incidence  of  disease  caused  by  poor  water\nquality.  Local  currency  costs  account  for  41  percent  of  total  project  costs,  of  which  the\nGovernment  is  providing  61  percent.  However,  local  financing  assistance  by  external  project\ncofinanciers is required to supplement the Government\u2019s contribution, and is justified given the\nlarge domestic cost component of the Project.\n\nSource\n\nPercent\n\nTable 2:  Financing Plan\n($ million)\nForeign\nExchange\n93\n61\n46\n23\n20\n8\n8\n14\n0\n273\n       ADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  JBIC  =  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation,  NDF  =  Nordic\nDevelopment  Fund,  NORAD  =  Norwegian  Agency  for  International  Development,  OPEC  =  Organization  of\nPetroleum Exporting Countries, Sida = Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency.\n\nADB\nWorld Bank\nJBIC\nNORAD\nSida\nNDF\nOPEC Fund\nJapan\nGovernment\n       Total\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n 27\n19\n6\n5\n5\n1\n6\n4\n118\n191\n\nTotal\nCost\n120\n80\n52\n28\n25\n9\n14\n18\n118\n464\n\n25.9\n17.2\n11.2\n6.0\n5.4\n1.9\n3.0\n3.9\n25.4\n100.0\n\n68.\nThe Government is expected to finance approximately 25 percent of the project cost; its\ncash  contribution  is  estimated  at  $46.6  million  (10  percent  of  the  total  cost),  net  of  taxes  and\nduties,  and  interest  during  construction.  The  Government  is  expected  to  be  able  to  meet  the\naverage  annual  contribution  of  counterpart  funds  estimated  between  $5  and  $12  million.\nConcurrently with NWSC signing a private sector lease contract for the leased assets with the\nPO, the Government will transfer the leased assets to the utility and enter into a subsidiary loan\nagreement upon terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB. The terms of repayment of the loan\nfor purchasing the leased assets will be on a 50 percent grant, 50 percent loan basis, and for\nthe loan portions, will include an annual interest rate of 8 percent, with principal repayable over\n\n\f16\n\n20 years inclusive of a 7-year grace period. The Government will assume the foreign exchange\nrisk on all sums due and owing under the subsidiary loan agreement.\n\n69.\nThe  World  Bank  is  expected  to  provide  a  credit  of  about  $15  million  in  2001  (for  the\nprivate sector lease contract and urgently needed rehabilitation of the distribution network). The\nprovision  of  an  additional  credit  of  about  $65  million  in  2003  (for  the  distribution  network\nimprovements) will be contingent upon satisfactory performance under the initial credit and the\noverall  progress  of  the  Government  in  implementing  the  reform  agenda.  The  Japan  Bank  for\nInternational  Cooperation  (JBIC)  will  fund  about  $52  million  in  2001  (for  the  WTP).  The\nNorwegian  Agency  for  International  Development  (NORAD)  will  provide  a  grant  equivalent  to\n$28 million in 2001 ($25 million to meet the tunnel costs, and $3 million previously committed for\nMDS design). The Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) has agreed\nin  principle  to  provide  funds  matching  those  of  NORAD,  equivalent  to  $25  million  in  mixed\ncredits in 2001 (for part financing of the tunnel). The Nordic Development Fund (NDF) will fund\n$9  million  in  2001  (to  finance  the  construction  supervision  for  the  MDS).  The  OPEC  Fund  will\nfinance  about  $13.7  million  in  2001  (for  the  access  roads).  The  Government  has  asked  the\nJapanese Government to finance the shallow groundwater development in Manohara for about\n$18  million  on  a  grant  basis.11  All  cofinancing  is  on  a  parallel  basis,  including  the  ADB-\nadministered  OPEC  Fund.  The  terms  and  conditions  of  financing  of  the  various  funding\nagencies are shown in Appendix 5.\n\nF.\n\nThe Executing Agency\n\n70.\nMPPW  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project,  and  MWSDB  will  be  the\nImplementing  Agency.  MWSDB  members  include  the  MPPW  secretary  as  chairperson,\nmembers  at  the  joint  secretary  level  from  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Ministry  of  Water\nResources,  and  the  mayor  of  Kathmandu  Metropolitan  City  and  the  executive  director  as\nmember Secretary, who will also be the project director. The full time executive director, also at\nthe joint secretary level, will be appointed from MPPW. MWSDB has about 40 staff of which 20\nare professionals. It has been successfully executing the ADB-funded Melamchi Water Supply\n(Engineering) Project.12 It has also demonstrated autonomy in decision making, which was the\nmain objective when it was established. The Government will ensure continued non-interference\nwith MWSDB's autonomy of decision making.\n\nG.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1.\n\nProject Management Unit\n\n71.\nA high-level steering committee comprising the ministers of Ministry of Finance, Ministry\nof Water Resources, MPPW and the vice-chairman of the NPC will be established to deal with\nmajor issues affecting the Project. The PMU will be established within the responsibility of the\nMWSDB and will be responsible for the day-to-day management of the Project. The PMU will be\nheaded  by  the  project  director,  who  will  be  a  senior  officer  at  joint  secretary  level.  Its\ngovernment  counterpart  staff  will  be  supported  by  a  team  of  domestic  and  international\nconsultants.  The  PMU  will  have  six  divisions:  (i)  an  information  division  comprising  public\nrelations,  management  information  system,  reporting,  and  planning  and  scheduling;  (ii)  an\nengineering  division  for  specifications,  drawings,  construction  supervision,  and  quality  and\nsafety  monitoring;  (iii)  a  social  and  environment  division  to  cover  resettlement,  compensation,\nsocial  mobilization,  gender,  hygiene  education,  NGO  coordination,  consensus  building,\nenvironmental  management,  and  benefit  monitoring;  (iv)  a  procurement  division  addressing\nlegal  aspects,  claims,  consultants,  suppliers,  and  contractors;  (v)  an  administration  division\n                                                          \n11 The  amount  will  be  firmed  up  during  the  basic  design  study  to  be  carried  out  over  a  period  of  six  months\n\ncommencing in November 2000.\n\n12 Loan 1640-NEP: Melamchi Water Supply (Engineering) Project, for $5 million, approved on 10 November 1998.\n\n\f17\n\nresponsible  for  personnel,  transport,  records,  communication,  and  payroll;  and  (vi)  a  finance\ndivision for budget, loan administration, accounts, auditing, and disbursement. The Government\nagreed  to  exert  its  best  endeavors  to  ensure  that,  subject  to  satisfactory  performance,  the\ninitially appointed project director and PMU division heads will be maintained in the positions for\na  minimum  of  three  years  during  project  implementation  and  will  seek  ADB's  concurrence  for\nany  change  of  those  appointments.  Preliminary  organization  charts  for  the  Project  in  general\nand the PMU in particular are given in Appendix 6.\n\n72.\nThe external funding agencies involved in the Project and the Government have agreed\non  a  special  coordination  mechanism.  MWSDB  will  convene  a  meeting  every  two  months  in\nKathmandu  at  which  external  funding  agencies,  together  with  the  Government,  will  review\nimplementation  progress  and  assist  the  Government  in  taking  any  corrective  action  needed.\nSeparately,  ADB  will  undertake  two  review  missions  each  year;  these  will  be  of  two  weeks\nduration  and  representatives  of  external  funding  agencies  will  join  them  for  at  least  a  week\neach. At the end of the review mission, the MOF will convene a meeting of donors, MWSDB and\nGovernment  officials.  Every  four  months,  MWSDB  will  submit  progress  reports  to  the\nGovernment and the external funding agencies.\n\nThe  consultants  for  the  various  project  components  (including  the  access  roads,  MDS,\n73.\nSUP,  WTP,  and  BDS)  will  report  to  the  PMU.  The  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  preparing\ndisbursement projections and budgeting allocations for counterpart funds. Also reporting to the\nPMU will be a social and environmental monitoring unit. Two panels of experts will be used to\nsupplement  consulting  services  provided  under  the  construction  supervision  contracts  and  the\nPMU.  Specific  disciplines  identified  include  hydraulics,  geotechnical  engineering  and  tunnel\ncontracting for the technical POE, and sociology, environmental management, and consensus\nbuilding and dispute resolution for the social and environmental POE. The POEs will visit twice\na year to examine and provide advice on specific issues and identify any potential issues. They\nwill  report  to  the  project  director  who  will  make  the  final  decision  on  the  event  of  any  conflict\nbetween  any  of  the  consultants.  The  construction  supervision  consultants  for  the  various\ncomponents will provide monthly reports to the PMU.\n\n2.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\nThe  Project  is  expected  to  be  commissioned  by  September  2006.  Tunnel  and  intake\n74.\ndesign  and  tendering  will  be  completed  in  2001.  Access  roads  will  be  completed  mid-2002.\nTunnel construction, which is on the critical path, will take about four and a half years including\nmobilization of the contractor. Construction of the WTP and BDS are expected to commence in\n2003, and each component will be completed simultaneously with the MDS to conduct a test run\noperation  of  the  WTP.  The  private  operator  (PO)  is  expected  to  commence  operations  in\nJanuary 2002. The implementation schedule is given in Appendix 7.\n\n3.\n\nProcurement\n\n75.\nProcurement  of  goods  and  services  financed  by  ADB  will  be  done  in  accordance  with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines on Procurement.  Contracts  for  civil  works  estimated  to  cost  more  than  $1.0\nmillion  equivalent  will  be  carried  out  using  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedures\nwhile  those  contracts  estimated  to  cost  $1.0  million  equivalent  or  less  will  be  under  local\ncompetitive bidding (LCB) procedures. To the extent possible, the procurement of goods will be\ngrouped into packages larger than $500,000 to be suitable for ICB procedures. Miscellaneous\nminor  goods  that  cannot  be  grouped  into  larger  contracts  and  cost  less  than  $500,000  per\ncontract  will  be  procured  through  international  shopping  (IS)  procedures.  Minor  items,  costing\nless  than  the  equivalent  of  $100,000  per  contract  may  be  purchased  directly.  Indicative\nprocurement packaging is shown in Appendix 8.\n\n\f18\n\n76.\nThe MDS will be bid as three separate contracts, one for power lines, the second for the\nintake and part of the tunnel, and the third for the remainder of the tunnel. The second one will\nbe  funded  by  ADB  using  ICB  procedures.  The  BDS  will  be  funded  by  ADB  and  will  consist  of\ntwo  contracts  for  civil  works  (one  for  the  north  and  the  other  for  the  south  pipe-laying  and\nreservoir  construction);  and  three  contracts  for  the  supply  of  pipes,  valves,  (ICB  procedures),\nand  flowmeters  (IS  procedures).  The  main  wastewater  improvement  procurement  packages\n(under ICB procedures) will be for the supply and installation of interceptor sewers, and for the\nrehabilitation  and  extension  of  several  wastewater  treatment  plants.  Other  smaller  packages,\nsuch as for septage trucks, sewer cleaning equipment, public toilets, and the septage treatment\nplant  will  be  procured  under  IS  procedures.  The  procurement  of  vehicles  and  office  and\ncomputer equipment for the PMU will follow IS procedures. Supply of equipment and civil works\nfor the SUP will be through very small contracts and will follow LCB procedures encouraging the\nparticipation of local community-based organizations in association with local firms.\n\nSeveral external agencies will finance additional goods and services for the Project.  The\n77.\npart of the tunnel not covered by ADB financing and the power lines, will be financed by NORAD\nand  Sida.  It  will  follow  NORAD  and  Sida  procurement  procedures.  It  will  be  competitively  bid\namong Norwegian and Swedish consortia. The access roads will be bid as three contracts. The\nfirst two, adit access roads and public road upgrading, will be financed by the OPEC Fund using\nICB procedures in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Procurement. Construction of the main\naccess road will be financed by the Government using LCB procedures. The WTP will be bid as\none  contract  for  civil  works,  including  the  supply  and  installation  of  mechanical  and  electrical\nequipment. It will follow ICB procedures in accordance with JBIC procurement guidelines. Four\ndistribution  network  improvement  contracts  to  be  financed  by  the  World  Bank  will  follow  ICB\nprocedures  in  accordance  with  World  Bank  procurement  guidelines.  The  specific  packaging  is\nexpected  to  include  one  contract  for  rehabilitation  and  one  for  the  supply  of  pipes  and  fittings\nduring the first phase, and two additional contracts, during the second phase, one for civil works\nand one for pipes and fittings.\n\n4.\n\nConsulting Services\n\n78.\nThe  selection  and  engagement  of  all  consulting  services  financed  by  ADB  will  be  in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements\nsatisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  A  team  of  international  and\ndomestic consultants, based at the PMU, will assist in implementing, managing and monitoring\nproject activities. A total input of 234 person-months of international consulting, and 846 person-\nmonths of domestic consulting is planned.\n\n79.\nFor  the  BDS,  only  construction  supervision  consulting  is  needed.  This  includes  113\nperson-months  of  international  consulting,  and  750  person-months  of  domestic  consulting.  In\naccordance  with  ADB  guidelines  and  subject  to  a  satisfactorily  negotiated  contract,  the  BDS\ndesign  consultants  will  be  retained  for  construction  supervision.  The  design  and  construction\nsupervision consulting for the wastewater improvements component will also be funded by ADB\nand  will  include  35  person-months  of  international  consulting  and  188  person-months  of\ndomestic consulting.\n\n80.\nThe  SUP  will  require  12  person-months  of  international  consulting  and  396  person-\nmonths  of  domestic  consulting  in  addition  to  NGO  inputs  for  the  following  components:  buffer\nzone, health, education, income generation, and rural electrification. For the HEPP, an NGO will\nbe engaged for 132 person-months of domestic consulting services to prepare and implement a\npublic  hygiene  awareness  project  in  Kathmandu  Valley.  The  third-party  monitoring  agent,  a\ncapable  NGO,  will  provide  80  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services  to  carry  out\nexternal monitoring of implementation of the RAP and the environment management plan.  The\npublic awareness component will require 12 person-months of international consulting and 160\n\n\f19\n\nperson-months of domestic consulting. The training component will require 8 person-months of\ninternational consulting. For the POE, 60 person-months of international consulting is provided\nover  the  whole  of  the  implementation  period.  Consulting  services  to  be  financed  by  ADB  are\ngiven in Appendix 9.\n\n81.\nAdditional  consulting  services  will  be  financed  by  other  external  funding  agencies.  The\ndesign  and  construction  supervision  of  the  MDS  will  be  financed  by  NORAD  and  NDF,\nrespectively.  For  the  WTP,  design  and  construction  supervision  is  expected  to  include\napproximately  150  person-months  of  international  consulting,  and  600  person-months  of\ndomestic  consulting  and  will  be  funded  by  JBIC.  The  PO  will  advise  on  the  design  of  the\ndistribution improvements and the WTP where feasible.\n\n82.\nActivities supporting institutional development (as distinct from institutional reforms) have\nbeen  incorporated  in  the  Project.  It  will  be  the  responsibility  of  all  consulting  teams  to  transfer\ntheir knowledge and skills to government counterpart staff and communities wherever possible\nthrough  a  structured  training  program  as  well  as  on  the  job  training.  Under  the  SUP,  the\ninstitutional  structure  of  the  Local  Governance  Program  will  be  used  to  build  the  capacity  of\nDDCs and VDCs. The PO will be required to increase the skills of the utility staff.\n\n5.\n\nAdvance Action\n\n83.\nAdvance  action  has  been  approved  for  recruiting  consultants  for  Project  management\nand for procurement actions prior to bid evaluations including issuance of invitations to bid and\nprequalification  of  contractors  for  the  construction  of  access  roads.    Initial  activities  are  under\nway.\n\n6.\n\nOperation and Maintenance\n\n84.\nThe PO will be responsible for the O&M of all project facilities including the adit access\nroads. Processing is under way, and an action plan to effect award of contract by 30 September\n2001,  and  mobilization  by  January  2002,  has  been  agreed  to  by  World  Bank  and  the\nGovernment. The regulatory body will be established before a contract is awarded to the private\noperator.  The  Government  is  represented  in  the  contract  processing  by  the  private  sector\nparticipation committee. The World Bank has employed consultants to support the processing.\nCoordination  is  being  maintained  with  both  MWSDB  and  ADB.  The  PO's  performance  will  be\nmonitored against predetermined targets related to achieving the objectives of the contract. The\nstated objectives of the lease contract and performance-related areas will include (i) reduction of\nphysical  and  commercial  losses,  (ii)  equitable  distribution  of  water  on  a  daily  basis,  (iii)\nmaintenance  of  computerized  consumer  accounts  and  management  information  systems,  (iv)\nincrease in number of connections, (v) maximization of revenue collection, (vi) increase in public\nawareness of water use including hygiene, (vii) improvement of sanitation services, (viii) training\nof  personnel  involved  in  water  management,  (ix)  customer  service  performance  indicators\n(including hours of supply and water quality), and (x) mapping of the physical system.\n\n7.\n\nDisbursement Procedures\n\n85.\nThe MWSDB will be responsible for preparing disbursement projections and requesting\nbudgetary allocations for counterpart funds. It will establish an imprest account for the Project.\nThe  initial  amount  will  be  no  more  than  a  six-month  projected  disbursement.  The  imprest\naccount  will  be  established,  managed,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Loan\nDisbursement Handbook.  The  MWSDB  will  coordinate  in  the  timely  release  of  funds  to  the\ncontractors.\n\n\f8.\n\nReports, Accounts, and Audit\n\n20\n\nThe MWSDB, with assistance from the consultants, will submit project progress reports\n86.\nto ADB every four months in a format and detail acceptable to ADB. These reports will include\n(i) consolidation and analysis of monthly reports from the construction supervision consultants,\n(ii) project schedule, critical path activities, project accounts, commitments and disbursements,\nland  acquisition,  resettlement  and  compensation,  and  (iii)  public  relations  activities.  Annual\nmonitoring reports will also be submitted on social and environmental issues and groundwater.\nMWSDB  will  submit  a  project  completion  report  to  the  Government  and  ADB  within  three\nmonths  of  physical  completion  of  the  Project.  The  report  will    emphasize  the  development\nimpacts achieved.\n\n87.\nThe MWSDB will set up the project accounts in accordance with Government guidelines.\nSeparate  accounts  will  be  maintained  for  each  external  funding  agency.  Accounts  will  be\nmaintained  on  the  basis  of  international  accounting  standards.  All  accounts,  including  the\nimprest  accounts  and  the  financial  statements  of  MWSDB,  will  be  audited  by  auditors\nacceptable  to  ADB.  Assisted  by  the  consultant,  the  PMU  will  prepare  the  required  information\nfor  audit  in  accordance  with  ADB's  project  auditing  requirements.  The  project  audit  will  be\ncarried out annually, and audited statements of project accounts and financial statements will be\nsubmitted to ADB within 12 months of the close of the Government's fiscal year.\n\n88.\nAn  audited  annual  report  of  the  utility  under  the  control  of  the  PO  will  be  submitted  to\nADB  no  later  than  six  months  after  the  end  of  each  fiscal  year.  The  report  will  include  the\ncomplete  and  audited  financial  statements  of  the  utility  in  accordance  with  international\naccounting standards.\n\n9.\n\nMonitoring and Evaluation\n\n89.\nMWSDB will finalize Project performance indicators and establish baseline conditions in\nconsultation with the POEs for the purposes of Project monitoring and evaluation (M&E). M&E\nindicators  and  procedures  will  be  tested  for  data  availability  and  other  constraints,  revised  if\nnecessary,  and  institutionalized  in  the  MWSDB  and  MPPW,  which  shall  ultimately  be\nresponsible for maintaining the M&E systems. Indicative performance indicators will be agreed\nbetween MWSDB and ADB. The benefit monitoring and evaluation will also take due account of\nthe  approaches  and  guidance  provided  under  ADB's  \"Benefit  Monitoring  and  Evaluation:  A\nHandbook for Bank Staff, Staff of the Executing Agencies and Consultants.\"\n\nH.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1.\n\nEnvironment\n\nMeasures  to  mitigate  adverse  environmental  impacts  have  been  incorporated  in  the\n90.\nproject design. The hydropower component was excluded on primarily environmental grounds.\nThese aspects include less water in the river at the intake site, more spoil to dispose of from the\ntunnel, longer access roads, transfer of large quantities of water from one river basin to another,\nand future development necessary inside a national park.\n\n91.\nThe most critical environmental issue for the people of Melamchi Valley is the  amount of\nwater to be taken from the Melamchi River and whether it will affect current irrigation use. The\nwater withdrawal not only will not affect existing uses, but a guarantee will be provided that in\nthe dry season a minimum of 30 percent of natural flow will be left in the river. All of the water\nabstracted  will  be  used  after  treatment  for  water  supply  purposes  and  will  not  be  used  for\nflushing  the  Bagmati  River  except  in  connection  with  the  periodic  cleaning  of  the  tunnel.  In\naddition, when water flows from the Melamchi Valley to the Kathmandu Valley a levy will be paid\n\n\f21\n\non all abstraction volumes as measured at the WTP by Kathmandu Valley water consumers to\nthe  inhabitants  of  the  Melamchi  Valley  via  a  mechanism  which  is  to  be  agreed  between  the\nGovernment  and  the  inhabitants.  The  levy  will  be  used  to  fund  activities  determined  by  the\ninhabitants, and the continuation and maintenance of SUP activities.\n\n92.\nAn approved environmental management plan will mitigate against construction impacts.\nConstruction  phase  impacts  will  be  controlled  by  appropriate  clauses  in  the  construction\ncontracts.  In  Melamchi  Valley,  this  is  expected  to  mitigate  environmental  impacts  associated\nwith (i) cutting down of trees and wildlife hunting by the construction workforce, (ii) damage to\nthe water quality of local waterways, (iii) increased erosion, (iv) damage to rivers and fish due to\npoor  spoil  and  topsoil  management,  (v)  deterioration  of  air  quality  along  haul  roads  and  at\nconstruction  plant  sites,  and  (vi)  failure  to  rehabilitate  land  temporarily  occupied  by  the\ncontractor\u2019s facilities. Along the access roads and at adits, this will help mitigate environmental\nimpacts associated with slope stability and soil erosion. For the BDS, mitigation measures will\nbe  similar  to  those  in  Melamchi  Valley,  but  in  addition  several  pipeline  river  crossings  are\nprovided. Constructing bridges and inverted siphons will temporarily create conditions similar to\noperation of borrow areas in river beds.\n\nConstruction  supervision  consultants  will  be  responsible  for  ensuring  that  contractors\n93.\nfollow  contract  specifications,  particularly  for  environmental  mitigation.  In  addition,  the  Social\nand  Environmental  Division  of  the  PMU  will  monitor  compliance.  A  final  check  on  compliance\nwith  sound  environmental  practices  will  be  made  through  an  independent  assessment  by  a\nsocial  and  environmental  monitoring  domestic  NGO.  The  results  of  this  assessment  will  be\nreported to ADB.\n\n94.\nDuring the operational phase, the main impact in Melamchi Valley will be on fish that live\nduring  the  dry  season  in  the  reaches  of  the  Melamchi  River  immediately  below  the  proposed\nintake.  Over  the  long-term,  the  lower  dry  season  flows  may  result  in  species  more  tolerant  of\nlow-flow conditions displacing the current fish life. Environmental measures included in the SUP\ninclude  (i)  a  catchment  management  and  tourism  promotion  program,  (ii)  an  environmental\nawareness  program  for  buffer  zone  residents,  and  (iii)  an  afforestation  program  with  the\nestablishment  of  forest-user  groups  and  a  cultural  preservation  program  for  one  village.  A  by-\nproduct of the water treatment process is sludge. The designer of the WTP will liaise with the\nPO  over  environmentally  acceptable  methods  of  sludge  disposal.  Numerous  large  trees  along\nthe pipeline route and in reservoir areas will have to be cut down. One reservoir and its supply\nand  delivery  pipelines  will  be  in  Gokarna  Forest  affecting  trees  there.  Wherever  feasible,\nreplacement  trees  will  be  planted  on  adjacent  land.  A  summary  environmental  impact\nassessment report was circulated to the ADB Board of Directors on 23 August 2000.\n\n2.\n\nSocial\n\nThe  location  and  design  of  infrastructure  has  been  carefully  considered  to  minimize,  if\n95.\nnot  avoid,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  Permanent  land  acquisition  is  expected  for  the\nMDS  (main  access  road  and  access  roads  to  adits),  WTP,  and  BDS  (reservoirs  and  pipeline\nroute),  the  distribution  network  (pipeline  route),  and  the  sewerage  system  improvements\namounting  to  about  131  ha,  mostly  agricultural  land.  Temporary  land  acquisition  of  101  ha  is\nalso  expected  for  construction  camps,  borrow  pits,  and  other  construction-related  activities.\nApproximately  98  structures  of  91  households  will  be  affected  either  partially  or  wholly,  and\nabout  25  households  will  be  displaced.  To  ensure  smooth  operation,  the  Government  has\nagreed that no civil works contracts will be awarded until all land acquisition is complete. Some\ncommunity  facilities  and  common  property  resources  (irrigation  channel,  community  forest,\ncommunity  hall)  will  also  be  affected.  Loss  of  income  directly  due  to  the  Project  (e.g.,  loss  of\ncrops  and  commercial  business)  will  be  compensated,  and  rehabilitation  assistance  will  be\nprovided  for  severely  affected  persons.  The  RAP  developed  for  the  Project  and  its  policy\n\n\f22\n\nframework  were  agreed  to  by  MWSDB  and  ADB.  The  overall  cost  of  the  RAP  is  estimated  at\n$15.8 million, of which $12.0 million is for land acquisition.  A summary RAP is in Appendix 10.\n\n96.\nThe SUP will be implemented in Melamchi Valley to mitigate indirect adverse impacts. It\nwill  include  development  activities  covering:  buffer  zone  development,  rural  electrification,\nhealth, education, and income generation and community development. Women\u2019s special needs\nfor  reproductive  health,  adult  literacy,  skills  development  and  income  generation,  legal\nawareness  raising,  and  antitrafficking  measures  (for  women  and  girls)  will  also  be  addressed.\nTo  ensure ownership  and sustainability, the SUP will (i) take a participatory approach through\ncommunity  mobilizers;  (ii)  utilize  the  institutional  structure  of  the  ongoing  Local  Governance\nProgram; and (iii) be sustained in the long term by levies paid by the water users in Kathmandu\nValley in the postconstruction stage (2007 and beyond).\n\n97.\nThe  Project  has  been  prepared  with  extensive  participation  of  stakeholders,  including\nbeneficiaries, adversely affected people, VDCs and ward representatives, DDC and Municipality\nofficials  and  representatives,  ministries  concerned  and  MWSDB,  the  private  sector,  external\nfunding  agencies,  NGOs,  and  consultants.  The  Project  will  address  the  direct  participation  of\nbeneficiaries through (i) SUP implementation, (ii) representation of adversely affected people in\nthe  compensation  determination  committee,  and  (iii)  representation  of  Kathmandu  Valley\nbeneficiaries in a water users association. The Project will also undertake consensus building at\nall  levels  on  issues  such  as  water  services,  environmental  and  social  mitigation  and\ncompensation,  and  employment.  For  adversely  affected  communities  in  the  Melamchi  Valley,\nlocal  consultative  groups  will  be  established  in  each  affected  wards  and  VDC.  Prior  to  31\nDecember 2001, a consultative committee will be established representing the inhabitants of the\nMelamchi  Valley  and  will  include  representatives  of  the  MWSDB  and  the  chairperson.\nMemoranda  of  understanding  will  be  signed  between  this  consultative  committee  and  the\nGovernment. To ensure that women's participation and gender concerns are fully addressed, a\ngender strategy will be developed and implemented. Apart from this, it has been agreed that at\nleast one of the members of the regulatory body will be female.\n\n98.\nProject  preparation  involved  extensive  consultations  with  NGOs.  Their  main  concerns\nrelated  to  (i)  volume  of  water  extracted  from  the  Melamchi  River,  (ii)  privatization  of  water\nsupplies, (iii) prospective tariffs, (iv) transparency of and access to information, (v) explanation\nof  assurances  sought  by  external  agencies,  and  (vi)  involvement  in  the  dissemination  of\ninformation. NGOs will be included in the consensus building activity between the Government\nand Melamchi Valley residents. The assurances provided by the Government will be explained\non  the  project  web-site.  They  will  also  be  employed  in  the  public  relations  contract  for\ndissemination  of  information  about  the  Project.  Overall,  they  will  form  the  backbone  of  SUP\nimplementation in Melamchi Valley.\n\n99.\nHEPP will be one of the most important social measures to be taken by the Project for\npeople  living  in  Kathmandu  Valley.  The  greatest  need  is  now,  before  the  Project  is\ncommissioned. Initially a pilot program will be developed; to be upscaled when proven effective.\nWithin six months of the award of the contract, the Government will ensure that this program will\nbe taken over by the PO of the water supplies.\n\n100. Special measures are being taken to ensure that the introduction of the private operation\nof  the  water  supplies  will  especially  benefit  the  poor.  These  include  access  to  good  quality\nbottled  water,  assured  connections  to  piped  water  (where  the  cost  of  the  connection  is\nrecovered  over  time  through  the  tariff),  targeted  hygiene  education  and  promotion  programs,\nand  an  affordable  tariff  based  on  basic  needs  consumption  and  targeted  environmental\nsanitation  improvements.  Women\u2019s  participation  will  be  highlighted,  especially  in  the  formation\nof  water  users  groups.  Equitable  distribution  of  water  will  be  one  of  the  PO  measurable\n\n\f23\n\nperformance targets. The PO will not be allowed to sell bulk water to a third party who sells the\nwater at a price higher than the PO's average tariff imposed for piped water.\n\nthe \n\nTo  support \n\n101.\nintroduction  of  privately  operated  water  supplies,  a  public\nawareness/relations unit will be established in the PMU. This unit will ensure that stakeholders\nare  kept  informed  about  the  Project  and  are  given  an  opportunity  to  express  their  views.  The\npublic relations program will be a proactive campaign that will identify any potential conflict area\nat an early stage, assist in consensus building between the Project and the local communities,\nand manage public expectations on compensation and the SUP.\n\nV.\n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\n102.\nThe  Project  will  provide  a  least-cost  solution  to  mitigate  the  socioeconomic  stress\ncaused  by  the  inadequate  supply  of  safe  water  on  Kathmandu  Valley  residents  by  optimizing\nwater  use  in  the  valley  as  well  as  developing  new  water  sources  outside  the  valley.  This  will\nbenefit  180,000  households  in  the  valley  by  improving  water  supply  services,  in  terms  of\nquantity,  quality,  and  timeliness  of  supply,  as  well  as  more  equitable  distribution.  About  20\npercent of these households live in poverty, with incomes less than NRs6,000 per month. The\nimpact  ratio  for  the  poor  has  been  estimated  to  be  four  times  that  for  the  not-so-poor.  The\nProject will also provide socioeconomic benefits to about 40,000 residents of Melamchi Valley\nby  increasing  incomes  from  improved  access  and  expanded  markets,  reduced  workload  for\nwomen,  better  education  for  children,  and  reduced  incidence  of  trafficking  of  women.    These\nbenefits have not been quantified and, to that extent, the economic benefits are understated.\n\nA. \n\nFinancial and Economic Analyses\n\n1.\n\n \n\nFinancial Analysis\n\na.\n\nSupply and Demand\n\n103. Water supply projections assume that in the preproject period, supply may increase as a\nresult  of  a  gradual  reduction  of  losses,  and  rehabilitation  or  expansion  of  groundwater  and\nsurface water sources. Projections of demand assume a population of 1.5 million in Kathmandu\nValley  in  2000,  and  a  growth  rate  of  4  percent  from  2001  falling  to  2.8  percent  in  2016  and\nthereafter.    Utilization  of  Melamchi  water  is  expected  to  be  about  73  percent  in  2007,  and\napproach 100 percent by 2011.  Accordingly, about 80 percent of the population will be served\nupon  commissioning  of  the  Project,  rising  to  about  95  percent  in  2016.    With  careful\nmanagement  and  relocation  of  key  industries  out  of  the  valley,  further  investments  may  be\ndeferred.\n\nb.\n\nCost Recovery Policy and Assumptions\n\n104. During the preproject period, average tariffs are expected to rise from NRs6.9/m3 in 2000\nto NRs12.8/m3 in 2006 (in 2000 prices) to meet cash O&M costs as well as private operator and\nregulatory costs. The financial projections assume (i) improved collection efficiency; (ii) metered\nstandpipes charged at the lifeline rate; (iii) users meeting payment obligations; (iv) groundwater\ncharges for nondomestic consumers; and (v) wastewater charged as a 50 percent surcharge on\nthe  water  tariff.  Post-Project,  average  tariffs  will  be  NRs23.0/m3  by  2008,  adequate  to  cover\nO&M,  debt  servicing,  regulatory,  and  private  operator  costs.  All  nondomestic  use  of\ngroundwater is assumed to cease by 2008.\n\nc.\n\nAffordability and Willingness-to-Pay\n\nFor  low-income  households  consuming  60  lpcpd  (or  9.2  m3  per  month),  Kathmandu\n105.\nValley  water  tariffs  as  a  percentage  of  household  income  are  expected  to  increase  from  0.7\n\n\f24\n\npercent  in  2000  to  1.1  percent  in  2006,  and  1.9  percent  by  2009  and  onward.  Where  a  low-\nincome household is also connected to the sewerage system, affordability peaks at 2.8 percent\nin  2008.    For  median-income  households  consuming  125  lpcpd  (or  19.1  m3  per  month),\naffordability is expected to rise from 1.2 percent of household income in 2000 to 1.9 percent in\n2006,  and  3.2  percent  in  2009  and  onward.  This  is  equivalent  to  NRs550  per  month  per\nhousehold. Where such households are also connected to the sewerage system, tariffs will rise\nfrom  1.8  percent  in  2000  to  2.8  percent  in  2006,  and  4.8  percent  in  2008  and  onward.\nCommercial  consumers  will  be  charged  the  same  as  domestic  consumers,  but  consumption\nover 30 m3  per month will attract the highest tariff level of NRs77 per m3  in  2009  and may  be\ncompared  with  the  average  incremental  financial  cost  tariff  of  NRs88  per  m3.  A  recent  survey\nshows 90 percent of households are willing to pay NRs500 per month for a 24-hour supply of\npiped potable water. This compares with a current average of NRs150 per month.  On average,\nless than 5 percent of disposable household income will be spent on water; this is in line with\ncurrent global norms.\n\nd.\n\nFinancial Internal Rate of Return\n\n106.\nThe  overall  financial  internal  rate  of  return  for  the  Project  is  4.7  percent.  This  may  be\ncompared  with  a  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  for  the  Project  of  0  percent,  where  the\nonlending rate is 8 percent and domestic inflation is 8 percent resulting in a real interest rate of\n0  percent.  Similar  to  other  urban  water  supply  projects,  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return\nshowed sensitivity to increases in capital costs and revenues. A summary of financial analysis is\nprovided in Appendix 11; details are available in Supplementary Appendix A.\n\ne.\n\nFinancial Performance of NWSC\n\n107. Over the past five years, the financial performance of NWSC has been poor due to high\nwater losses, poor service, low tariffs, and low collection efficiencies. Accounts receivable have\nrisen  to  311  days  equivalent  of  sales  in  2000.    Consequently,  NWSC  has  only  been  able  to\nmaintain  a  positive  cash  flow  by  deferring  debt  service  payments  to  the  Government.    At  the\ncurrent  levels  of  net  profit  and  operating  losses,  NWSC  will  not  be  able  to  meet  any  ongoing\ncapital expenditure out of retained earnings.\n\n108. NWSC\u2019s poor financial performance has led to the proposal to engage a private operator\nto manage water supply and sewerage systems in Kathmandu Valley. This is expected to result\nin  improved  operational  performance  and  a  reduction  in  water  losses  and  improved  collection\nefficiencies. Financial projections and assumptions for water supplies in the valley are set out in\nSupplementary Appendix A.\n\n2. \n\nEconomic Analysis\n\na.\n\nWith and Without the Project\n\n109.\nThe  without-project  option  offers  a  very  bleak  scenario  for  Kathmandu  Valley.  Since\nNWSC would be unable to meet demand, piped water delivery would continue to be limited to\nless  than  2  hours  every  two  days,  pressures  and  water  quality  would  be  poor,  and  inequality\nwould  persist  for  water  distribution.  Therefore,  the  economic  price  of  water  would  rise  from\nNRs40/m3 currently to NRs110/m3 in 2012.\n\n110. A number of alternative options, including in-valley storages were considered, but were\nfound  to  be  impractical  because  of  various  shortcomings,  such  as  high  financial  and  social\ncosts,  low  yield,  and  other  problems  associated  with  population  density  and  land  use.  The\nproposed design involves a low-level tunnel, no impoundment storage, and no hydropower, and\nwas considered a least-cost and least environmentally disruptive option. Furthermore, it retains\n\n\fthe  option  for  low-cost  gravity  expansion  of  supply  from  the  Yangri  and  Larke  rivers  and  in-\nvalley storage in the future.\n\n25\n\nb.\n\nEconomic Benefits\n\n111.\nThe  project  benefits  accrue  from  (i)  the  saving  of  time  and  cost  in  fetching,  carrying,\npumping,  purchasing,  storing,  and  treating  water;  (ii)  reduced  risk  of  health  problems;  and  (iii)\nreduced overexploitation of groundwater.  Additional benefits accrue from the increased supply\nof  water  available.  The  economic  analysis  uses  demand  curves  and  associated  income  and\nprice  parameters  to  evaluate  annual  nonincremental  and  incremental  benefits.  The  approach\ninternalizes the benefits associated with health, welfare, and convenience.\n\nc.\n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return\n\nThe economic evaluation assumes base economic costs of $322 million and incremental\n112.\nO&M costs at 1 percent of total costs plus $0.04/m3 of water production. A standard conversion\nfactor of 0.9 is assumed. Total costs are high because of the need to provide a sound basis for\nfuture expansion. Benefits are estimated at NRs1,500 million/year initially and increase to about\nNRs6,000 million/year in subsequent years.\n\n113.\nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  for  the  Project  (with  170  MLD  capacity)  is\n13.5 percent, while the EIRR for the full development is 15.3 percent. The EIRR was tested for\nsensitivity  to  tariff  levels,  water  losses,  income  growth,  nondomestic  tariffs,  and  capital  costs.\nThe  EIRR  is  estimated  to  be  10.1  percent  at  the  current  water  loss  figure  of  40  percent,  11.9\npercent with real income growth reduced to 1 percent per year, 12.9 percent with a 50 percent\ndecrease  in  the  nondomestic  tariffs,  and  12.6  percent  with  a  10  percent  increase  in  capital\ncosts. A summary of the economic analysis is provided in Appendix 11; details are available in\nSupplementary Appendix B.\n\nd.\n\nTariffs\n\n114.\nThe principles of a tariff policy were developed by the Government and incorporated in\nthe  water  supply  and  wastewater  sector  strategy  for  the  Kathmandu  Valley  (Appendix  2).  The\ntariff  will  build  on  the  principles  of  demand  management,  cost  recovery,  services  to  the  poor,\nand  easy  payment  of  water  bills.  It  will  be  aimed  at  the  staged  recovery  of  all  O&M  costs,\nregulatory  fees,  debt  servicing  needs,  levy  for  water  abstraction  from  Melamchi  River,  and  a\nportion of future investments. The tariffs will be maintained in real terms by periodically adjusting\nfor  inflation.  Commercial  groundwater  abstraction  will  be  licensed  and  metered  and  charged\nvolumetrically.  Based  on  these  principles,  and  on  the  results  of  ongoing  studies  supported  by\nthe  World  Bank,  the  Government  is  expected  to  determine  an  appropriate  tariff  structure  for\nKathmandu Valley early in 2001.\n\ne.\n\nSubsidies\n\n115. While the Government has agreed to phase in full cost recovery in financial terms for the\nwater  supplies  in  Kathmandu  by  2010,  some  subsidies  will  be  provided  in  the  interim.  These\ninclude  (i)  funds  to  develop  the  Project  that  will  be  passed  on  to  the  utility  in  an  equal  mix  of\ngrant  and  loan;  (ii)  subsidy  for  all  capital  works  for  wastewater  improvements;  (iii)  subsidy  to\nusers  of  groundwater;  (iv)  subsidy  provided  to  farmers  who  use  current  water  resources  for\nirrigation;  (v)  subsidy  provided  to  industries  that  pollute  the  waterways  and  environment  to\nenable them to convert to clean technologies; (vi) cross-subsidy provided by other water users\nto the urban poor to ensure equitable access to water; and (vii) subsidy provided to the PO for\nthe first three years. Subsidies related to the Project and wastewater improvements are in line\nwith  those  currently  provided  elsewhere  in  Asia.    All  subsidies  will  be  phased  out  during  the\n\n\f26\n\nproject  period  except  for  the  two  relating  to  wastewater  improvements  and  the  cross-subsidy\nprovided  by  other  water  users.  These  can  be  supported  because  the  full  cost  recovery  of\nwastewater  tariffs  is  not  expected  to  be  achievable  at  affordable  tariffs.  Cross-subsidy  of  the\nurban poor through a lifeline block for a minimum quantity of water is also supportable on the\ngrounds  that  it  ensures  that  health  and  related  sanitation  benefits  are  available  to  the  whole\ncommunity.  These  costs  result  in  public  benefits  that  arise  from  reduced  health  care-related\ncosts and fewer work days lost due to ill health from water-borne diseases.\n\nB.\n\nEnvironment\n\n1. \n\nPhysical Environment\n\n116. Access  roads,  transmission  lines,  and  construction  camps  will  be  built.  Potential  road\ngrade  and  affected  area  instability  will  be  improved  by  reducing  the  slopes  of  embankments,\nuse  of  upslope  and  downslope  gabions,  proper  drainage,  and  stabilization  by  grass  planting.\nRoad  construction,  spoil  disposal,  and  borrow  material  sites  have  been  identified  and  tested,\nand  locally  required  smaller  ones  will  be  confirmed  during  detailed  road  design.  Road\nconstruction  spoil  will  not  be  dumped  along  the  roadside  or  into  rivers  or  ravines.  If  the  local\npeople require fill materials, they will be permitted to take road spoil on a \"take-for-free\" basis.\nAfter MDS construction, the main access and adit roads will improve access to the upland and\nnear-river  areas  along  the  Melamchi  River  with  an  estimated  2,000  households  benefiting\ndirectly or indirectly. Likewise, tunnel spoil will also be made available to the local people for use\nas road or track fill, fencing, house foundations, and walls.\n\n117. Upon completion, the MDS will divert 2 m3/sec of water from the Melamchi River to the\nWTP. In the dry season from February to April, approximately 55 percent of the Melamchi River\nflow,  upstream  of  the  first  major  irrigation  intake,  will  be  diverted  leaving  about  45  percent  as\nresidual flow. During the rest of the year, a much larger percentage of environmental flows will\nbe retained in the Melamchi River. This is particularly important for the May-June and October-\nNovember  periods  when  fish  migration  occurs.  All  existing  water  demands  for  the  Melamchi\nRiver for irrigation, water mills, and domestic purposes can be met safely on a year-round basis.\n\n118.\nThe  BDS  and  distribution  network  will  be  constructed  within  the  semiurban  and  urban\nareas  of  Kathmandu  Valley.  Trenches  will  be  dug  along  road  rights-of-way  and  across\nintervening  sections  of  mainly  agricultural  land.  All  reservoir  construction  will  be  located  on\neither rural or semiurban open land.\n\n2.\n\nBiological Environment\n\n119.\nThe number of trees to be cut due to the construction of the various adit access roads,\nportal  and  spoil  disposal  sites,  and  borrow  areas  has  yet  to  be  determined  in  detail  due  to\nalterations to MDS configuration. Most of the trees affected are located in degraded community\nforests. Once road centerlines and construction works area boundaries are determined by the\nupdating  studies  on  the  MDS,  all  affected  trees  whether  on  private  or  public  property  will  be\nproperly inventoried, and owners compensated. Any replacement afforestation required by the\nDepartment  of  Forestry  will  be  negotiated  and  implemented  during  the  construction  phase  as\nmitigation.  Of  note,  several  ongoing  community  forest  use  groups  are  operating  with  bilateral\nand  NGO  assistance  in  the  Melamchi  area;  they  will  be  used,  as  appropriate,  to  implement\nforestry-related mitigation.\n\nThe  operation  of  the  Melamchi  diversion  weir  will  only  marginally  affect  the  fish\n120.\npopulation.  Long  and  middle  distance  fish  migration  does  not  occur  in  the  Melamchi  River\nupstream of the Timbu River because of the presence of natural barriers. Reductions in water\nflow will occur between the intake and the confluence of the Indrawati River, but residual flows\n\n\f27\n\nin  the  critical  periods  for  fish  breeding  in  the  main  areas  will  be  adequate  to  maintain  suitable\nhabitats  similar  to  existing  ones.  Under  the  Project,  a  river,  water  use,  and  fisheries\nmanagement program will be designed and implemented, involving local user groups including\nirrigators, water-mill owners, fisherfolk, and local community-based organizations.\n\n121. Approximately 40 trees will be removed from the agricultural land to be cleared for the\nWTP. However, a riverbank buffer zone is proposed for the east bank of the Bagmati River and\nwill be planted with trees. In addition the WTP site boundary zone will be landscaped with larger\ntrees, as both aesthetic and noise buffering mitigation.\n\n122. Construction of the BDS will require numerous nonindigenous trees to be cut, most are\neither poplars or eucalyptus along the Ring Road and other public road rights-of-way. In several\nlocations affected by the BDS pipelines, these fast-growing species are causing problems due\nto  wind  breakage  with  resulting  damage  to  frontage  road  properties,  so  their  removal  and\nreplacement with more suitable species will be locally acceptable. Tree cutting at the reservoir\nsites will be limited. To mitigate this impact, the Project will replace all trees as required by, and\nas  agreed  with,  the  relevant  authorities  such  as  the  Department  of  Roads,  DDCs,  VDCs,  or\ncommunity-based  organizations  involved  in  their  establishment  and  maintenance,  as  some\nareas are indicated to be under \"locally sponsored projects.\" An assessment of environmental\nimpacts and mitigation measures is in Appendix 12.\n\nC.\n\nSocial Dimensions\n\n123. Kathmandu  Valley.  The  primary  beneficiaries  of  the  Project  are  1.5  million  people\n(180,000  households)  in  Kathmandu  Valley  (1.25  million  direct  beneficiaries  and  0.25  million\nindirect).  Improved  water  supply  services  with  better  water  quality,  more  water  (and  reduced\nunaccounted  for  water)  and  timely  supply,  extended  service  areas,  more  equitable  water\ndistribution, and better customer services will benefit them through (i) reduced anxiety about the\nunreliable  water  supply;  (ii)  improved  health  by  reducing  water-related  diseases  and  better\nhygiene  practices,  especially  for  children;  (iii) reduced  burden,  time  saved,  and  cost  of  water\ncollection, storage, and boiling and other treatment of water, especially for women and female\nchildren;  (iv)  more  safety  for  women  in  water  collection  as  night-time  water  collection  is  not\nnecessary; and (v) reduced burden and time saved to deal with service agents. Such benefits\nonly materialize if the better water supply services go hand in hand with increased public health,\nhygiene  and  environmental  awareness,  and  improved  sanitation  facilities  and  maintenance.\nOverall, these benefits will also have a significant positive impact on the next generation and the\nrest of the country as the Kathmandu Valley case sets a good practice model. The issue of the\npotential negative impact of the raised water tariff on low-income households will be addressed\nthrough an equitable tariff structure under the privately operated facilities.\n\n124. Melamchi Valley.  Several socioeconomic and poverty reduction benefits will accrue to\nthe  population  (40,000)  in  the  14  VDCs  in  Melamchi  Valley  through  the  project  infrastructure\nconstruction  and  the  SUP.  These  include  (i)  improved  access  to  Kathmandu  and  within\nMelamchi Valley using the access roads; (ii) increased incomes from the expanded market and\nupgraded skills; (iii) availability of electric power; (iv) reduced workload for women; (v) increased\ngender  awareness  in  the  community;  (vi)  increased  adult  literacy  rates;  (vii)  better  educated\nchildren;  (viii)  greater  health  and  family  planning  awareness  and  improved  health  conditions,\nespecially  for  women  and  children;  and  (ix)  reduced  incidence  in  trafficking  of  girls.  A  full\nassessment of the social dimensions of the Project is given in Appendix 13.\n\n125. Resettlement  and  Land  Acquisition.  Some  direct  adverse  social  impacts  are  also\nenvisaged  (see  SEIA  for  environmental  aspects)  and  adequate  mitigation  measures  and\ngrievance  mechanisms,  based  on  consultations  with  the  affected  population,  are  in  place.\nPotential indirect adverse social impacts could include (i) social disruption caused by the influx\n\n\f28\n\nof  outside  workers,  including  sexually  transmitted  diseases;  (ii)  loss  of  employment  or  income\ndue to changes in the economic structures; (iii) increased trafficking of women and girls, and (iv)\nincreased child labor. These will be addressed through the SUP.  An antichild labor clause will\nbe  included  in  the  contract  document.  No  specific  ethnic  or  caste  groups  will  be  especially\nadversely  affected,  but  the  vulnerable  groups  (e.g.,  severely  affected  persons,  households\nheaded by women) have been identified for special assistance.\n\nD.\n\nImpact on Poverty\n\n126. Socioeconomic  surveys  conducted  during  project  preparation  suggest  that  about  20\npercent  of  households  in  Kathmandu  Valley  live  in  poverty,  with  incomes  less  than  NRs6,000\nper  month.  The  major  project  benefits  are  savings  and  incremental  benefits  accruing  to  water\nusers and to the economy, from the improved water supply and management. An examination\nof the demand curves indicates that the net benefit accruing to a poor household (benefit less\ntariff paid) is about the same as that accruing to a not-so-poor household, but the composition of\nthe benefits is different. The poor household has a small absolute savings benefit and a large\nabsolute incremental benefit.  Assuming a single rate tariff, the distribution of the net benefits to\nconsumers is about equal to the distribution of the population. However, the relative impact on\nthe poor is better, with impact ratios of net benefit over income estimated at 1.6 for the poor and\n0.4  for  the  not-so-poor.    Assuming  a  stepped  tariff  structure,  the  impact  ratio  for  the  poor\nincreases to 1.8, while that for the not-so-poor decreases to 0.3.\n\nE.\n\nRisks\n\n127. ADB  staff  assessed  the  main  Project  risk  as  follows:  One  of  the  main  risks  is  lack  of\ncommunity  support.  If  the  community  is  not  kept  adequately  informed  of  project  intentions,\nactivities, and progress, work may be disrupted. Compensation expectations in Melamchi Valley\nwill need to be managed sensitively. To address this risk, numerous public consultations have\nalready been held. In the PMU, a special social and environmental division is being established.\nConsensus-building  activities  will  be  conducted  under  the  guidance  of  a  dispute  resolution\nexpert.\n\n128. A significant amount of land must be acquired in the Melamchi and Kathmandu valleys.\nDelays are possible and resettlement may be problematic. However, the RAP was prepared and\nthe census survey, already under way, will be completed once the exact location and design of\nthe  project  infrastructure  is  known.  A  clear  grievance  procedure  has  been  established  and\nadvertised. The Government has also agreed to complete land acquisition before awarding any\ncivil works contracts.\n\n129. Hydrological data on the Melamchi Khola spans a relatively short period. During the dry\nseason,  the  stream  may  not  be  able  to  consistently  supply  the  design  flow  of  water  and  still\nmaintain residual flows. To address this aspect, methods to optimize water use in Kathmandu\nValley  will  be  studied  in  2001.  Conjunctive  use  of  groundwater  and  surface  water  is  also\nproposed.\n\nThe  private  operator  must  be  allowed  to  function  in  an  environment  that  is  free  of\n130.\npolitical pressures; and to determine its own staffing, tariffs, and operational system. Otherwise,\nthe  existing  unsatisfactory  state  of  water  supply  could  continue.  The  establishment  of  a\nregulatory body will greatly minimize this risk. However, if interference still occurs, future support\nfrom  the  World  Bank  for  the  distribution  network  improvements  will  be  jeopardized,  as  indeed\nwill further ADB funding.\n\n131. A team of international consultants also undertook a risk analysis of the Project during\nNovember  2000.  The  approach  used  was  a  structured  method  for  risk  management  which\n\n\f29\n\nrecognizes uncertainties as representing both risks as well as opportunities. The focus was on\ncost  and  time  schedule.  For  the  cost  element,  the  main  uncertainties  identified  were  (i)\ndistribution of water, (ii) quality of project management, (iii) rock conditions in the tunnel, (iv) the\nlimited  preparation  stages  for  some  components,  and  (v)  the  market  conditions  for  bidding\ncontracts. The consultants concluded that as against the current cost estimate ($464 million) the\nmost likely cost was $494 million. For the time element, the main uncertainties identified were (i)\nrock  conditions  in  the  tunnel,  (ii)  local  people  involvement,  (iii)  distribution  of  water,  and  (iv)\nstrong project management. The consultants concluded as against the current projection of 70\nmonths that the most likely time for completion would be 86 months.\n\nIt was recommended that sharper focus be given to the strategic objective of the Project\n132.\nas a whole as well as the individual component objectives and targets. Special attention must\nbe given to the geological conditions, project management, the distribution system and people's\nparticipation.  It  is  necessary  to  closely  monitor  developments  effecting  expenditure  and\nprogress. Contingency plans need to be in place to cater for cost over-runs and delay in project\nimplementation.

To  achieve  efficient,  effective,  and  equitable  service  delivery  short  and  long-term\nstrategies must be developed, specific to Kathmandu Valley, in areas related to\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\n(v)\n\n(vi)\n(vii)\n\ninstitutional  setup\u2014to\n\neffective  sector  planning  and  continued  infrastructure  improvement\u2014to  manage\ndemand and augment system capacity;\nestablishing  a  nonconflicting  and  nonoverlapping \ncontribute to improved organizational autonomy and organizational efficiency;\nenacting  service  delivery  standards  defining  acceptable  service  levels\u2014to\npromote equitable supply of potable water, easy access, continuity, and reliability\nat affordable prices;\nlegal  framework\u2014to  create  an  enabling  environment  in  the  sector  and  for  the\nservice operator;\ncost recovery and tariff structure\u2014to achieve long-term financial sustainability of\nthe  sector  with  simple  mechanisms  for  tariff  administration  and  within  the\naffordable limits of various consumer segments;\naccess to services for financially disadvantaged groups; and\ntransparency and consultation with consumers.\n\nThese strategies will be in accordance with the broader National Water Supply and\n\n2.\nSanitation Sector Policy, 1998.\n\nB.\n\nNational Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Policy\n\n3.\nDecentralization  of  services  and  utility  management;  users  involvement;  private  sector\nparticipation in management and development of utilities; implementation of an appropriate cost\nrecovery  mechanism;  and  formulation  of  necessary  acts,  rules,  and  regulations,  etc.  are  the\nmajor  highlights  of  the  National  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector  Policy,  1998.  The  sector\npolicy  fully  supports  the  current  plan  of  establishing  a  private  operator  for  the  operation  and\nmaintenance  of  the  Kathmandu  Valley  water  supply  system  and  a  regulatory  organization  to\nmonitor the operator.\n\nDevelopment and long-term sustainability of adequate and affordable water supply and\n\n4.\nsanitation services for Kathmandu Valley are the main objectives of this strategy.\n\nC.\n\nObjectives\n\nD.\n\nStrategies\n\n1.\n\nSector Planning and Infrastructure Improvement\n\na.\n\nWater Demand Management\n\n5.\nA water use optimization study will be conducted for Kathmandu Valley in 2001. This will\nrefine  the  analysis  related  to  population,  migration,  use  of  sources,  and  water  demand.  It  will\nalso  explore  possibilities  of  demand  management  through  rainwater  harvesting,  wet  season\nstorage, recycling of wastewater, trading of water rights, public awareness, etc., and analyze the\ninvestment  timings  for  the  Yangri  and  Larke  diversions.  The  study  will  establish  a  dynamic\n\n\fAppendix 2, page 2\ncomputer-based model for monitoring the water resources and their use against the population\nand  demand  changes.  The  demand  management  strategy  will  analyze  technical,  social,\neconomic, financial and institutional aspects of various alternatives, to set priorities and describe\ntheir sequencing and implementation. They include\n\n38\n\nconjunctive  use  of  surface  and  groundwater  sources,  to  ensure  sustainability  of\nyield from groundwater sources;\ninterbasin transfer of water from surrounding areas, which comprise the diversion\nof  Melamchi,  Yangri,  and  Larke  rivers  of  the  Indrawati  basin;  the  first  phase  of\nthis program, which involves diversion of about 170 million liters of water per day\nfrom the Melamchi River is expected to be commissioned in 2006;\nreduced system losses;\noptimizing  water  use  by  increasing  public  awareness  as  well  as  appropriate\npricing  for  domestic,  industrial,  and  commercial  uses  and  volumetric  pricing  of\nconsumption;\nnonconventional measures like relocation of water from agriculture to urban use,\nrainwater harvesting at the household and community level, wet season storage,\nwastewater recycling; and\neffective enactment of economic and regulatory instruments to manage industrial\nwater demand and water pollution abatement, as well as to provide incentives for\nrelocating  water  intensive  and  water  polluting  industries  outside  of  Kathmandu\nvalley.\n\nb.\n\nGroundwater Management\n\n6.\nThe  groundwater  use  in  Kathmandu  valley  will  be  primarily  conjunctive  with  surface\nwater  use.  After  considerable  augmentation  of  the  public  water  supply  by  surface  source  is\nrealized to meet the demand in the post-Melamchi period, an abstraction ceiling for groundwater\nwill be defined and abstraction permits issued only within this ceiling.\n\n7.\nA  monitoring  system  will  be  developed  to  properly  monitor  the  abstraction,  the  water\ntable,  and  the  water  quality  in  both  shallow  aquifers  and  deep  aquifers.  All  deep  aquifer\nextractions  and  commercial  extractions  from  shallow  aquifers  will  be  licensed,  metered,  and\ncharged. A driller\u2019s license will be introduced in 2002 to regulate drilling practices.\n\nc.\n\nSanitation Services\n\n8.\n\nActivities will include the following:\n\nThe number and capacity of the existing treatment plants will be increased, and\nthe  laying  and  extension  of  interceptors,  collector  mains,  and  collector  laterals\nwill be undertaken in a phased manner.\nOnsite systems and treatment plants employing natural treatment technology will\nbe promoted at community levels in peri-urban areas, possibly coupled with small\nbore community sewers, to intercept the wastewater near the origin.\nIndustries will be required to install pretreatment units. The quality and quantity of\neffluent  and  sludge  discharges  to  land  and  natural  watercourses  will  be\nmonitored against predefined standards.\nPublic  toilets  will  be  promoted  with  due  care  in  maintenance.  Municipalities\nconcerned  will  participate  actively  in  the  provision  and  maintenance  of  such\nservices.  Private  sector  participation  will  be  encouraged  in  managing  collection,\ntreatment,  and  disposal  of  on-site  system  sludge  and  in  construction  and\nmaintenance of public toilets.\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n(iv)\n\n(v)\n\n(vi)\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\n\f(v)\n\nAppendix 2, page 3\nPublic  awareness  campaigns  will  be  undertaken  for  water  conservation  and\nhygiene education.\n\n39\n\n2.\n\nService Delivery Standards\n\nService delivery levels will be continuously upgraded to attain increased coverage of 24-\n9.\nhour  potable  piped  water  supply  under  adequate  pressure.  Individual  connections  will  be\npromoted to allow increased access to services. National water quality standards will be defined\nand  enacted  by  2002.  In  the  post-Melamchi  period  these  will  be  considered  mandatory\nstandards  and  an  adequate  monitoring  and  surveillance  mechanism  will  be  developed  to\nmonitor compliance by the operator with these standards.\n\nThe  operator  will  be  required  to  publish  annual  operations  report  for  the  public  review\n\n10.\nand will be specifically monitored against service delivery indicators including\n\n(i)\n(ii)\n(iii)\n(iv)\n(v)\n(vi)\n(vii)\n(viii)\n(ix)\n(x)\n\nreduction of physical and commercial water losses,\nequitable distribution of water,\nmaintenance of computerized consumer accounts,\nincrease in number of connections,\nmaximization of revenue collection,\nincrease in public awareness,\nimprovement of sanitation services,\ntraining of personnel,\ncustomer service performance indicators, and\nmapping of the physical system.\n\n11.\nDischarge standards will be defined and monitored for industrial discharges. The quality\nand  quantity  of  effluent  and  sludge  discharges  to  land  and  natural  watercourses  will  be\nmonitored.  Appropriate  and  cost-effective  technology  will  be  promoted,  such  as  sewerage\nsystems in dense urban areas and on-site systems and small-bore community sewers coupled\nwith natural treatment technologies in peri-urban and other low-density areas.\n\n3.\n\nInstitutional Framework Reorganization\n\n12.\nThe  present  institutional  framework  will  be  revisited  to  clarify  and  separate  the  policy\nformulation,  planning,  service  provision,  and  regulatory  functions  in  the  water  sector,  with  the\naim  of  improving  coordination  and  organizational  efficiency,  which  will  be  measured  against\nexplicitly  defined  performance  indicators.  A  comprehensive  study  will  be  undertaken  in  2001.\nThe  proposed  framework  will  incorporate  organizational  autonomy  and  will  be  allowed  to\noperate  under  appropriate  incentive  regimes.  Responsibilities  of  each  organization  will  be\nclearly delineated to avoid duplication and conflict in work spheres.\n\n13.\nAn  enabling  environment  will  be  created  to  allow  the  management  of  the  water  and\nsanitation services through a private operator. Required legislative reforms will be undertaken to\nprovide  the  operator  with  required  autonomy  for  operating  the  system,  billing  and  collecting\nwater charges, withdrawing services from defaulters, and insulation from external interference.\n\na.\n\nMinistry of Physical Planning and Works\n\n14.\nThe  Ministry  of  Physical  Planning  and  Works  (MPPW)  will  be  the  central  agency  for\ncoordination,  policy  formulation,  standard-setting,  and  monitoring  at  the  national  level.  The\nproposed study will define the appropriate asset-holding organization, and MPPW will assume\nthe asset-holding function until an organization as prescribed by the study is set up.\n\n\fb.\n\nKathmandu Valley Water Authority\n\n40\n\nAppendix 2, page 4\n\nAn  independent  and  autonomous  Kathmandu  Valley  Water  Authority  (KVWA)  will  be\n15.\nestablished.  The  KVWA  board  will  primarily  be  constituted  with \nlocal  government\nrepresentatives and some line ministry representatives. It will be responsible for comprehensive\nwater resources management, including allocation, use, and protection of water resources, and\nthe  introduction  of  river  basin  management  approaches  in  Kathmandu  Valley.  The  proposed\ninstitutional  study  will  define  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  KVWA  as  a  planning,\nimplementing,  monitoring,  and  management  agency,  but  not  an  operating  agency.  It  will\nmaintain a small professional staff and let contracts to consultants for related works.\n\nc.\n\nPrivate Operator\n\nThe  frontline  operation  and  management  of  the  water  and  wastewater  services  in  the\n16.\nurban  areas  of  Kathmandu  Valley  will  be  contracted  to  a  private  operator,  on  the  basis  of\ncompetitive bidding as a lease contract, initially for 10 years starting 2001.  The contract will be\ncontinued  as  a  lease  or  extended  as  a  concession  contract  after  this  period  through  a\ncompetitive bidding process.\n\n17.\nThe private operator will act as an implementing agency to undertake rehabilitation and\nimprovements  related  to  the  production  and  distribution  of  drinking  water  and  wastewater\ndisposal in Kathmandu Valley. The Melamchi water supply system from source to consumer will\nbe operated and maintained by the operator after its commissioning.\n\nd.\n\nNational Water Supply Regulatory Body\n\n18.\nA  national  water  regulatory  body  (NWRB)  will  be  established,  prior  to  the  award  of  the\nlease contract, to protect the consumer interests and monitor the performance of the operator\nagainst set performance indicators. The NWRB will monitor contract compliance by the private\noperator and will approve the tariff adjustments in accordance with the predefined tariff policy of\nthe Government. It will also annually undertake consumer surveys and publicize the results. The\nNWRB will initially be established to monitor the Kathmandu Valley supply, but it may expand its\nactivities to regulate other water supply and sanitation systems in the country.\n\n4.\n\nLegal Framework\n\n19.\n\nLegal frameworks will be enacted for\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n(iii)\n(iv)\n\n(v)\n(vi)\n\nprivate  sector  management  of  drinking  water  and  wastewater  services  and\nutilities;\nestablishment and functioning of KVWA;\nestablishment and functioning of NWRB;\ndefinition,  monitoring,  and  surveillance  of  standards  of  drinking  water  quality,\ngroundwater quality, and wastewater discharges;\nlicensing and charging of groundwater abstractions; and\npayment of a levy by the water consumers of Kathmandu Valley to the peoples of\nMelamchi, Yangri, and Larke valleys for the use of their water.\n\n5.\n\nCost Recovery and Tariff\n\n20.\nTo  allow  public  transparency  in  tariffs  and  to  minimize  the  use  of  discretion,  the\nGovernment  will  announce  a  tariff  policy,  to  define  the  terms  for  setting  the  tariffs.    The  tariff\n\n\fAppendix 2, page 5\npolicy  will  build  in  the  principles  of  (i)  demand  management,  (ii)  cost  recovery,  (iii)  services  to\nthe poor, and (iv) easy payment of water bills:\n\n41\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\n(v)\n\nThe tariff structure for water supply will, on commissioning of the Melamchi water\nsupply project, be based on recovering all operation and maintenance costs and\ndebt  service.  By  2010,  it  will  cover  all  operation  and  maintenance  costs,\nregulatory fees, debt servicing needs, any levy to be paid for water abstraction,\nand  a  portion  of  the  future  investments.  The  tariff  policy  will  adopt  full  metering\nand  volumetric  pricing  concepts  with  due  considerations  to  the  welfare  of  the\nurban poor.\nThe capital investments for Melamchi will be calculated for recovery on the basis\nof 50 percent loan and 50 percent grant ratio.\nTariffs for nondomestic uses will be charged at uniform rates on volumetric basis\nof consumption and will take into account the costs of alternatives.\nNondomestic  groundwater  abstraction  will  be  licensed  and  metered,  and\nvolumetrically  charged  at  levels  that  will  encourage  connections  to  the  public\nwater supply system.\nWastewater  will  be  charged  to  attain  financial  sustainability  for  at  least  the\noperation and maintenance of facilities plus 10 percent of capital cost recovery.\n\n(vi) Wastewater charges for industries will be progressively enforced according to the\n\npolluter pays principle.\nTariffs will be maintained in real terms by periodically adjusting for inflation.\n\n(vii)\n\n6.\n\nAccess to services for the financially disadvantaged\n\nAccess  to  the  connections  will  be  simplified  by  allowing  incentives  for  connection\n21.\ncharges  and  payment  schedules.  Connection  requirements  will  be  simplified,  and  the\ndistribution  network  expanded  to  reach  the  poor.  Incentives  will  be  built  into  the  operator's\ncontract to motivate the operator to address financially disadvantaged households and groups.\nBulk  selling  of  water  to  smaller  independent  vendors  will  be  allowed  provided  the  price  to  the\nend consumer  is not  higher than the rates for the piped water supply.\n\n7.\n\nTransparency and Consultation with Consumers\n\n22.\nTransparency  and  participation  will  be  promoted  by  adopting  a  consultative  process,\nrecognizing  the  importance  of  people's  participation  and  the  value  of  their  role  in  ensuring  a\nwell-functioning  water  sector.  This  will  ensure  the  full  and  timely  disclosure  of  information,\nincluding reporting of key performance indicators to the press each year, and consultation with\nall socioeconomic groups in Kathmandu Valley.\n\n\f42\n\nAppendix 3\n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION SECTOR\n\nProject Name\n\n1990 - 1999\n\nType of\nAssistance\n\nSource\n\nYear\n\nStart\n\nEnd\n\nAmount\n$ million\n\nA.

Prepared in 1973,\nit was followed by several development projects involving sources of water inside the valley. For\nvarious reasons, water supply remained inadequate and further studies were commissioned.\n\n2.\nPrefeasibility  Study.  This  study  (undertaken  in  1988)  investigated  three  types  of\nsurface  water  supply  schemes:  pumped,  storage,  and  gravity,  and  studied  20  schemes.\nPumping schemes would involve high operating costs with stringent maintenance criteria, while\nstorage schemes would be feasible, but would have a higher operating cost than Melamchi and\nless  economic  expansion  opportunity.  Of  the  gravity  options,  Melamchi  had  the  best\ncombination  of  economy  and  yield  to  meet  the  design  target  of  2  cubic  meter  (m3)/s  (second)\nand be expandable.  The basic Melamchi concept was to have a low diversion weir (no storage)\non the Melamchi Khola and divert through a tunnel to a storage area in the Kathmandu Valley.\nThe  initial  idea  was  to  have  a  5  million  m3  storage  on  the  flood  plain  just  below  the  proposed\nwater treatment plant. Subsequently, the World Bank proposed the modified Melamchi proposal,\nwhich involves a 15 million m3 flood plain storage, eliminating the need for construction of the\nexpensive  27  kilometers  (km)  transfer  tunnel.  The  study,  however,  recommended  adoption  of\nthe basic Melamchi scheme to provide 2 m3/s with expansion to tap the Yangri and Larke kholas\nto  give  a  total  of  5  m3/s.  This  scheme  included  water  treatment  at  Mahankal  and  a  bulk\ndistribution system to serve Kathmandu and Lalitpur.\n\n3.\nFeasibility  Study.  The  basic  Melamchi  scheme  was  adopted  as  the  basis  of  the  full\nfeasibility  study  in  1992.  The  study's  objective  was  to  assess  feasibility  of  the  basic  and\nmodified Melamchi schemes and recommend a preferred option. Citing the danger of founding a\nsignificant  dam  on  the  floodplain  sediments  in  a  highly  earthquake-prone  region,  Snowy\nMountain Engineering Corporation (SMEC) proposed the Sundarimai Dam inside the Shivapuri\nWatershed  and  Wildlife  Reserve.  The  economic  analysis  showed  Sundarimai  Dam  to  be\nexpensive for its yield, and therefore, it does not enter into the water resource expansion plan\nuntil  after  the  Yangri  and  Larke  sources  are  tapped.  The  scheme  comprising  an  intake  at\nNakotegaon, tunnel to Sundarimai, pipeline to Sundarijal, and a water treatment plant and bulk\ndistribution was determined to be the most desirable option. The study recommends: (i) carrying\nout an investigation to show whether Sundarimai Dam would enter the least cost expansion plan\nafter tapping the Larke Khola; (ii) if not, investigating a lower level tunnel alignment; (iii) subject\nto  the  findings,  proceeding  to  the  detailed  design  of  the  adopted  scheme;  and  (iv)  only\nconsidering in-valley storage if there is confidence that downstream irrigators will not be able to\nincrease their water use at the expense of municipal customers.\n\n4.\nBankable Feasibility Study. Bhutwal Power Corporation's (BPC) study (1996) covered\nthe  access  roads,  the  intake  on  the  Melamchi  Khola,  the  transfer  tunnel,  and  a  15  megawatt\nsurface  power  station  at  the  downstream  end  of  the  tunnel.  The  intake  was  slightly  upstream\nfrom the site chosen by SMEC. BPC adopted a free-flow tunnel with dimensions 3 m high and\n2.8 m wide giving a cross-sectional area of 7.6 m2. BPC proposed a public-private partnership to\nfinance the scheme, and to minimize costs, Nepali construction methods were to be used.\n\n\f44\n\nAppendix 4, page 2\n\nThe  Melamchi  Water  Supply  Development  Board.  The  board  was  formed  in\n5.\nSeptember 1998 to implement the Melamchi Water Supply Project. Its board members comprise\nthe  secretary  of  the  Ministry  of  Physical  Planning  and  Works  as  chair,  a  representative  from\neach  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Ministry  of  Water  Resources,  the  mayor  of  Kathmandu\nMetropolitan City, and a full-time executive director. Its specific functions are to (i) execute the\nMelamchi  Drinking  Water  Project,;  (ii)  make  project-specific  policy  decisions,;  (iii)  approve  the\nprogram and budget, and (iv) report to the Government through MPPW.\n\nMelamchi  Water  Supply  (Engineering)  Project  (February  1999).    Funded  by  the\n6.\nAsian Development Bank (ADB), the project's objective was to assist in preparing an investment\nproject. The components included (i) 170,000 m3/d diversion works on the Melamchi Khola, (ii) a\n7.5  m2  and  28  km  long  tunnel  to  Sundarijal,  (iii)  a  15  megawatt  hydropower  station,  (iv)  a\n170,000 m3/d water treatment plant, (v) a bulk distribution system, and (vi) distribution network\nimprovements.  There  were  three  tasks:  (i)  project  management  including  financial,  economic,\nenvironmental,  and  social  analyses  of  the  investment  project;  (ii) engineering  for  the  bulk\ndistribution system; and (iii) implementation of a groundwater artificial recharge pilot project.\n\n7.\nDiversion  Scheme  Final  Design  Study.  The  Norplan  terms  of  reference  required  the\noptimization  of  the  water  transfer  system  as  a  dual-purpose  water  supply  and  hydropower\nscheme.  Norplan  retained  the  pressure  tunnel  concept  but  proposed  a  deeper  tunnel  profile.\nThe tunnel size was increased to 12 m2 for about half the tunnel and to 16 m2 for the rest of the\ntunnel  with  steeper  grades.  Norplan  also  proposed  an  underground  power  station.  The  study\n(1999) reported negligible economic advantage by adding the hydropower component.\n\nReview  of  Melamchi  Diversion  Final  Design  Study.  Nippon  Koei  reviewed  the\n8.\nNorplan  report  (2000)  and  concluded  that  a  water  supply  only  project  with  an  8  m2  free-flow\ntunnel and a lower intake on the Melamchi Khola would be more economical. The advantages\nwere  (i)  a  greater  catchment  area;  (ii)  elimination  of  a  tunnel  construction  adit  and  its  access\nroad; (iii) shorter access roads; (iv) easier inspection and maintenance of a free-flow tunnel; and\n(v) reduced environmental impact.\n\n9.\nADB  Mission  Recommends  Exclusion  of  Hydropower  (April  2000).  A  high-level\nmission from ADB visited Nepal to discuss with the Government the possibility of excluding the\nhydropower  component.  Based  on  the  additional  adverse  environmental  impacts  associated\nwith hydropower, which included the increased depletion of water from the river and the major\nquantities of water to be transferred from Melamchi Khola to the Bagmati River, the Government\ndecided to exclude hydropower from the Project.\n\n\f45\n\nAppendix 5, page 1\n\nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN\n\nTable A5.1: Detailed Cost Estimates\n($ million)\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal\nCost\n\nItem\n\nA.

Pipelines  will  be  run  along  road  rights-of-way\n(ROW) and across private land. An estimated 40,913 persons will be variously affected by the\nProject.\n\nTable A3:1:  Households Affected by Loss of Agricultural Land and Residential\n\nand Commercial Structures\n\nProject\nComponent\n\nAgricultural\nLand\n\nStructures\non Private\nLand\n\nHouse/Shop\non Public\nLand\n\nShops on\nPublic\nLand\n\nTotal Families\nand Persons\nAffected\n\nPAF SPAF\n\nSPAF\n\nSPAF\n\nSPAF\n\nPAFs\n\nPAPs\n\nMDS\nPermanent\nTemporary\nBDS\nPermanent\nTemporary\nWTP\nPermanent\nTotal\n\n1,295\n502\n\n1,555\n2,684\n\n200\n\n118\n\n478\n\n127\n\n30\n6,066\n\n48\n726\n\n1\n246\n\n7\n\n7\n\n1,620\n502\n\n2,390\n2,684\n\n79\n7,275\n\n9,072\n2,811\n\n13,384\n15,030\n\n616\n40,913\n\n230\n\n230\n\nBDS = bulk distribution system, MDS = Melamchi Diversion Scheme, PAF = project-affected families, SPAF - severely\nproject-affected families; WTP = water treatment plant.\nSource:  Consultant Reports.\n\nThe overall impact of the Project is limited.  The majority (83 percent) of project-affected\n2.\nfamilies (PAFs) will be marginally affected by loss of agricultural land, while only 10 percent (726\nhouseholds) will be severely affected by loss of agricultural land.  Three percent of PAFs (253\nhouseholds)  will  lose  their  houses,  7  of  which  have  shops  attached.    Another  3  percent  (230\nvendors) have encroached into road ROW along the bulk distribution system pipeline route.\n\n3.\nA  total  of  253  households,  or  1,428  project  affected  persons  (PAPs)  will  be  displaced\nwhen their houses are affected. The incomes of 230 households (1,288 persons) will be affected\nwhen their temporary shops are cleared from public ROW.\n\n4.\nThe resettlement action plan (RAP) identifies the (i) extent of losses; (ii) number of PAPs\nin various categories; (iii) policies and legal framework applicable; (iv) arrangements made for\ncompensation payments, relocation, and income restoration assistance; and (v) responsibilities\nfor delivering and monitoring the implementation measures.\n\nB.\n\nSocioeconomic Impacts on the Affected People\n\n5.\nA census survey of 100 percent of affected households is being carried out as detailed\ndesigns  become  available  for  each  component.    This  survey  will  serve  as  the  cut-off  date  for\neligibility for entitlements.  The census survey combines an inventory of losses, ownership, and\nland tenure status with a collection of baseline socioeconomic data on each household as well\nas preferences for compensation and rehabilitation assistance.\n\n\f60\n\nAppendix 10, page 2\n\nC.\n\nObjectives, Legislation, Policy Framework, and Entitlements\n\n6.\nLand acquisition for public purposes in Nepal is largely governed by the Land Acquisition\nAct  2034  (1977),  which  sets  out  compensation  standards  and  benefits  such  as  compensation\nfor  lost  assets  at  market  value,  provision  for  alternative  land,  and  compensation  for  standing\ncrops and trees. However, the provisions are inadequate. To cover resettlement-related needs\nof  the  PAPs,  Melamchi  Water  Supply  Development  Board  (MWSDB)  has  prepared  a\nresettlement policy framework that was approved by the Government. The framework provides\nbenefits to nontitled persons such as encroachers and squatters, displacement allowances for\nrelocation,  and  income  restoration  assistance.    In  summary,  the  policy  framework  for\nresettlement  affecting  the  Project  is  similar  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank's  policy  on\nresettlement.  Basic  principles  of  the  project  resettlement  policy  include  (i)  avoidance  of  land\nacquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement  where  feasible  or  minimization  to  the  extent  possible\nthrough  the  incorporation  of  social  considerations  into  project  design  options,  and  (ii)  where\npopulation displacement is unavoidable, payment of full compensation and assistance to people\nlosing assets, livelihood, and other resources so that they can improve or at a minimum restore\ntheir former economic and social conditions.\n\n7.\nThe RAP contains 11 compensation categories: for land, crops and trees, loss of house\nand/or  commercial  enterprises,  compensation  for  damages  caused  during  construction,\nmitigation  for  loss  of  water  due  to  diversion  of  the  Melamchi  River,  displacement  allowances,\nrehabilitation  measures,  loss  of  community  facilities  and  resources,  and  group  losses.    These\ncategories are listed in an entitlement matrix.\n\nD.\n\nConsultation, Participation, and Grievance Mechanism\n\n8.\nPublic  consultation  for  the  Project  began  with  the  census  survey  of  each  PAF  during\nwhich  focus  group  discussions  have  served  as  a  forum  for  participation  and  consultation.\nCoordination  meetings  were  also  held  with  local  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  and\nlocal governments. MWSDB senior management have carried out an information campaign and\nconsultation with area residents in the Melamchi Valley.\n\n9.\nA  public  relations  consultant  is  being  hired  by  MWSDB  to  keep  project  area  residents\nfully  informed  about  the  Project  and  to  make  sure  that  public  concerns  are  communicated  to\nMWSDB. The Board will prepare and distribute brochures outlining the resettlement policy and\ncompensation packages for PAPs and will involve community-based organizations and PAPs in\nthe information campaign, and implementation and monitoring of the resettlement plan.\n\n10.\nThe  PAPs  and  other  people  in  the  project  areas  will  be  able  to  make  complaints  or\nqueries to MWSDB and know that they will be heard and addressed fairly. The field office of the\nProject  in  the  Melamchi  valley  and  the  Resettlement  and  Social  Development  Division  of  the\nProject Management Unit will be responsible for handling initial grievances of the PAPs, with the\nassistance  of  the  local  consultative  groups  and  particularly  the  local  community  liaison\nassistants who will help the PAFs to file their complaints and concerns to the MWSDB.\n\nE.\n\nRelocation of Housing and Settlements\n\n11.\nA total of 253 houses will be displaced and require relocation, as well as 230 shops with\nvery  temporary  structures  of  bamboo  poles  and  plastic  roofs.    The  house  owners  prefer  to\nreceive  cash,  and  they  will  make  their  own  arrangements  to  rebuild,  either  on  their  remaining\nland or elsewhere. Group resettlement sites will not be required. For the vendors whose shops\nare  illegally  encroaching  within  the  ROW,  MWSDB  will  assist  the  local  governments  to  find\npermanent market sites in which they can rent stalls.\n\n\f61\n\nAppendix 10, page 3\n\nF.\n\nIncome Restoration Strategies\n\n12.\nSeverely project-affected families (SPAFs), including households fully affected by loss of\nhouses  and/'or  commercial  establishments,  and  households  severely  affected  by  loss  of\nagricultural  land,  will  be  entitled  to  allowances  to  restore  their  household  incomes  during  the\ntransition  period.  They  will  also  be  assisted  to  restore  their  income  levels  in  the  longer  term\nthrough skills training, assistance to establish new income-generating activities, and access to\nmicrofinance.  SPAFs  and  vulnerable  groups  (e.g.,  households  headed  by  women,  ethnic\nminorities,  disabled,  elderly,  and  special  interest  groups)  will  be  given  priority  in  all  income\nrestoration  or  creation  measures.  SPAF  farmers  will  be  provided  with  agricultural  extension\nservices to increase productivity on their remaining land.\n\nG.\n\nInstitutional framework\n\n13.\nThe  implementation  of  the  RAP  will  be  carried  out  by  the  Social  and  Environmental\nDivision  of  the  Project  Management  Unit,  assisted  by  the  compensation  determination\ncommittees  and  local  consultative  groups  at  the  ward  level.  MWSDB  will  be  responsible  for\nensuring the necessary cooperation of contractors, government departments, and PAPs.\n\nH.\n\nResettlement Budget and Financing\n\n14.\nThe  estimated  cost  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  is  about  $15.80  million.  The\nresettlement  cost  estimate  includes  all  costs  related  to  resettlement  including  compensation,\nrelocation,  transfer  costs,  displacement  allowances,  rehabilitation  costs,  administrative  costs,\nresettlement training, and costs of monitoring and evaluation.  MWSDB will allocate appropriate\nfunds  on  the  basis  of  construction  priorities  and  resettlement  needs  for  the  different\ncomponents.\n\nI.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n15.\nAn implementation schedule for the RAP has been prepared to ensure the completion of\nresettlement  activities  before  the  beginning  of  the  relevant  civil  works  of  the  Project.\nResettlement  preparation  activities  have  started.  Land  acquisition  has  already  begun  and  will\ncontinue until the end of 2004. Monitoring and evaluation of the impacts of RAP implementation\nwill continue into 2005.\n\nJ.\n\nMonitoring and Evaluation Plan\n\n16.\nThe  resettlement  process  will  be  monitored  both  internally  and  externally.  The  Social\nand  Environmental  Division  will  be  responsible  for  internal  monitoring  and  preparation  of\nmonthly  and  trimesterly  progress  reports  on  the  progress  of  resettlement  implementation.\nMWSDB  will  hire  a  qualified  independent  external  monitoring  agency  to  conduct  external\nmonitoring annually during Project implementation. The monitoring and evaluation process will\ninvolve  the  participation  of  affected  people,  communities,  and/or  NGOs.  A  postresettlement\nevaluation  will  be  carried  out  by  the  external  monitoring  agency  to  assess  whether  the\nresettlement  objectives  have  been  met,  and  lessons  learned  identified  for  future  policy\nformulation and planning.\n\n\f62\n\nAppendix 11, Page 1\n\nSUMMARY OF THE FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSES\n\nA.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\n1.\n\nSupply Assessment\n\n1.\nWater supply projections assume that in the preproject period supply may increase as a\nresult of a reduction of losses and some rehabilitation or expansion of groundwater and surface\nwater sources. Current losses of 40 percent are assumed to decrease to 35 percent by 2007, to\n30  percent  by  2011,  and  to  25  percent  by  2021.  An  extra  21  million  liters  per  day  (MLD)  is\nassumed  to  come  from  Manohara  from  2004.  The  Project  will  supply  an  average  180  MLD,\nbringing the total availability of supply in 2007 to 304 MLD as compared with 111 MLD in 2000.\nThe  water  supply  projections  do  not  consider  the  timing  of  the  Yangri  and  Larke  river  water\nsupply options from valleys adjoining the Melamchi, but these additional water supplies may be\nrequired during 2012 to 2021.\n\n2.\n\nDemand Assessment\n\n2.\nProjections  of  water  demand  assume  a  population  of  1.5  million  in  2000  and  a  growth\nrate  of  4.0  percent  in  2001,  falling  to  2.8  percent  in  2016,  and  remaining  steady  at  that  level\nthereafter. From project commissioning, 80 percent of the population is assumed to be served,\nrising  to  95  percent  in  2021.  Estimates  of  household  demand  based  on  a  weighted  average\nincrease  range  from  62  liters  per  capita  per  day  (lpcpd)  in  2000  to  95  lpcpd  in  2007,  and  to\n105 lpcpd  in  2011.  This  assumes  demand  management  by  pricing  (and  public  awareness).\nHouseholds with full plumbing are assumed to increase from 26 percent currently, to 46 percent\nin 2007, and to 68 percent in 2021. The proportion of households using standposts is expected\nto  decline  from  22  percent  currently,  to  14  percent  in  2007,  and  to  2 percent  in  2021.  The\nbalance are assumed to have yard taps and represent 52 percent in 2000, 40 percent in 2007,\nand  30  percent  in  2021.  The  majority  of  households  are  assumed  to  have  full  plumbing  and\nhigher water consumption by 2021. Projections of commercial, industrial, and institutional piped\nwater supply demand as a proportion of domestic demand increases from 5 percent currently to\n14 percent in 2007, but then declines to 12 percent by 2011 and remains at this level thereafter\ndue in part to assumed relocation of industry outside Kathmandu Valley.\n\n3.\n\nRelending to Utility\n\nRelending  terms  in  local  currency  (NRs)  from  the  Government  to  the  Nepal  Water\n3.\nSupply Corporation (NWSC) are assumed to be on the basis of 50 percent grant and 50 percent\nloan.  The  loan  will  be  at  an  interest  rate  of  8  percent  per  annum,  over  20  years  with  a  grace\nperiod on principal repayments up to 2008.\n\n4.\n\nCost Recovery Policy and Assumptions\n\n4.\nBased on the objective for the sector to meet cash expenses up to 2006, average tariffs\npre-Project  rise  from  NRs6.6/m3  in  2000  to  around  NRs12.8/m3  in  2006.  This  is  based  on  a\npolicy  of  meeting  cash  operating  and  maintenance  costs  as  well  as  private  sector  contracting\nand  regulatory  costs.  Over  this  period,  tariffs  are  not  expected  to  recover  investment  costs  or\nservice  debt  on  past  investments.  The  financial  projections  assume  that  the  private  sector\nmanagement contract will improve collection efficiency from the current 75 percent of billings to\n97.5  percent  of  billings  by  2005.  Standpipes  will  be  metered  and  charged  at  the  lifeline  rate.\nGroundwater  charges  for  commercial  and  industrial  consumers  will  be  at  50  percent  of  the\n\n\f63\n\nAppendix 11, Page 2\n\nmaximum  rate  for  piped  water  supply  users.  Wastewater  will  continue  to  be  charged  at  50\npercent surcharge on water tariff for those households connected to a sewer.\n\n5.\nIn  the  postproject  period,  the  objective  is  to  meet  operation  and  maintenance  costs\nincluding those from source to consumer for the Project, debt servicing costs of the lease funds\nre-lent to the utility, the regulatory costs, and the private sector lease contract on-going costs.\nTariffs are set to meet a debt service ratio (DSR) of 1.1 in 2007 and 1.2 in 2010 and each year\nthereafter.  All  commercial  and  industrial  use  of  groundwater  is  assumed  to  cease  with  such\nusers connecting to the piped water supply over 2007 and 2008. The average tariff post-Project\nin FY2009 is estimated at NRs23/m3 (in 2000 prices) based on 50:50 loan:grant relending. The\nrecommendation is to keep the 50:50 loan:grant relending, but debt servicing would commence\nin  FY2007  with  interest  payments  and  principal  payments  phased  over  2008  and  2009.  The\naverage tariff would be NRs18/m3 in 2007, rising to NRs23/m3 in 2009. In practice, the increase\nover  2006  to  2009  could  be  smoothed  and  would  require  real  increases  of  21  percent  per\nannum for three years.\n\n5.\n\nAffordability\n\n6.\nMedian household income in Kathmandu Valley is estimated at NRs14,000 per month,\nand  the  lowest  quartile  median  at  NRs6070  per  month.  Prior  to  project  commissioning,  water\ntariffs  as  a  percentage  of  household  income  for  a  low  income  household  consuming  60  lpcpd\nincreases  from  0.7  percent  of  household  income  in  2000  to  1.1  percent  in  2006.  Post-Project\nthis rises to 1.9 percent in 2009  and remains around that level. Where a low-income household\nis  also  connected  to  the  sewerage  system,  affordability  represents  2.8  percent  of  household\nincome in 2008.\n\n7.\nFor a median income household, water tariffs as a percentage of household income in\n2000  and  assuming  125  lpcpd  consumption  will  amount  to  1.2  percent.  Where  they  are\nconnected to the sewerage system this will be about 1.8 percent of household income. By 2006,\nthis will have increased to 1.9 percent of household income for a water only connection and 2.9\npercent  of  household  income  incorporating  the  sewerage  surcharge.  Following  project\ncommissioning, the water only tariff would equate to 2.6 percent of household income in 2007\nrising to 3.2 percent in 2009. Adding the sewerage surcharge, in 2009 tariffs are equivalent to\n4.8 percent of household income; it  remains at this level over the balance of the forecast period\nto 2012.\n\nCommercial  consumers  will  pay  the  same  charges  as  domestic  consumers,  but  above\n8.\n30 m3 per month all consumption will be charged at the highest rate. This means that by 2008\nmost commercial consumers will be paying around NRs77/m3 for their water requirements and\nan additional NRs39/m3 for sewerage. These charges are in line with the average incremental\nfinancial cost of NRs88/m3 at 12 percent discount rate.\n\n6.\n\nWillingness-to-Pay\n\nA survey conducted in August 2000 of 100 potential consumers from all cross-sections\n9.\nof  society,  showed  90  percent  willing  to  pay  NRs500  per  month  for  a  24-hour  supply  of  piped\npotable  water.  This  compares  with  a  current  average  of  NRs150  per  month.  The  financial\nprojections assume a monthly charge of NRs555 per month (in 2000 prices) for 19.1 m3. This\nwould be 39 percent more water than is being received by average fully plumbed customer at\nthe present time.\n\n\f64\n\nAppendix 11, Page 3\n\n7.\n\nFinancial Internal Rate of Return\n\n10.\nThe overall financial internal rate of return (FIRR) for the Project is 4.7 percent. This may\nbe compared with a weighted average cost of capital of 0 percent, where the onlending rate is 8\npercent  and  domestic  inflation  is  8  percent  resulting  in  a  real  interest  rate  of  0  percent.\nSensitivity  analysis  shows  the  FIRR  falling  to  3.4 percent  when  capital  costs  increase  by  10\npercent  and  revenue  decreases  by  10 percent.  The  FIRR  for  this  Project  is  not  dissimilar  to\nthose for many other urban water supply projects in developing countries.\n\n8.\n\nPast Financial Performance of NWSC\n\nOver  the  past  five  years,  the  NWSC's  performance  has  been  characterized  by  high\n11.\nwater losses (estimated at 40 percent of production), poor service (often only 1-2 hours every\nother  day),  low  tariffs  (around  1  to  2  percent  of  household  income)  and  low  collection\nefficiencies.  Debtors  have  risen  to  the  level  of  311  days  of  sales  equivalent  in  2000.\nConsequently,  NWSC  has  only  been  able  to  maintain  a  positive  cash  flow  by  deferring  debt\nservice payments to Government.\n\n12.\nThis has resulted in a weak financial position with NWSC unable to generate sufficient\nfunds to carry out adequate levels of repairs and maintenance, let alone meet its debt service\nobligations or make any meaningful contribution to the sector's capital requirements. In fact the\nfirst two World Bank (IDA) credits have been converted to equity, while NWSC is unable to meet\ninterest  payments  on  the  IDA  Third  Water  Supply  and  Sewerage  Project  with  no  schedule\nagreed for loan repayment.  In the case of the fourth IDA credit, which has been rescheduled\nand reduced in size and scope from some $60 million to $38 million, it had been agreed that 65\npercent  will  be  passed  on  to  NWSC    as  a  grant,  with  35  percent  to  be  onlent  and  repaid  by\nNWSC .\n\n13.\nPast  financial  performance  of  NWSC  shows  that  net  profit  has  declined  steadily  from\nNRs40 million in FY1995 to a loss of NRs42 million in FY1999, and a provisional loss in FY2000\nof NRs72 million. Also over this period, while the results provided for the payment of interest to\nthe  Government,  no  interest  was  actually  paid.  However,  there  was  some  offset  of  the\nGovernment revenues owing on stand posts with interest owed by NWSC.\n\n14.\nAt the current levels of net profit and operating losses, NWSC will not be able to meet\nany ongoing capital expenditure out of retained earnings. In practice, the level of operating and\nmaintenance  costs  has  not  been  sufficient  to  keep  the  NWSC  water  and  sewerage  systems\noperating properly.\n\nThis poor financial performance has led to proposals to have Kathmandu water supplies\n15.\nmanaged  by  a  private  operator  through  a  lease  arrangement.  The  proposed  lease  is  for  10\nyears,  and  the  private  operator  is  assumed  to  be  in  place  by  September  2001,  prior  to  the\nfinalizing  of  the  Melamchi  tunnel  contract.  This  is  expected  to  result  in  improved  operational\nperformance  and  a  reduction  in  water  losses  and  improved  collection  efficiencies.  Financial\nprojections  and  assumptions  for  inside  Kathmandu  Valley  for  a  Kathmandu  water  utility  and\nprivate operator are set out in Supplementary Appendix A.\n\n\f65\n\nAppendix 11, Page 4\n\nB. \n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n1.\n\nDemand Assessment\n\n16.\nThe  economic  analysis  uses  demand  curves  based  on  income  and  price  to  evaluate\nnonincremental  and  incremental  benefits.  The  concepts  underlying  the  curves  were  originally\ndeveloped in Kathmandu studies (SMEC 1992) and further refined with analysis of information\nfrom the ADB Water Utilities Data Book for the Asian and Pacific Region (November 1993).\n\n2.\n\nWithout Project\n\nThe without-project option has been considered. Without an increase in water availability\n17.\nand without improvement in management, the water scenario for Kathmandu is bleak. NWSC is\nunable  to  meet  demand.  Delivery  is  limited  to  less  than  two  hours  every  two  days.  Pressures\nare poor and water quality is poor. Tariffs are low, encouraging high demand from those who do\nget water. Many consumers at high elevations or distant points receive little or no water. NWSC\nrevenues are too low to sustain the system, let alone expand to meet the demands of a growing\npopulation. Shallow wells are becoming increasingly polluted and the deep aquifers mined. The\nrisk of serious health problems is increasing. The poor suffer the most \u2014 fetching and carrying,\nusing shallow wells and polluted streams, or relying on public standpipes. Many only get water\nin  the  middle  of  the  night  or  rely  on  purchasing  it  from  their  neighbors.  Higher  income\nconsumers are relying on tanker deliveries, bottled water purchase, and deep wells. If nothing is\ndone, the situation will continue to deteriorate. Income, welfare, and the environment suffer. The\nincreasing economic cost of shortage in the without-project case is illustrated by the economic\nprice of water rising from about NRs40/m3 currently to about NRs110/m3 in 2012.\n\n3.\n\nAlternative Designs\n\n18.\nOptions to augment water supply in Kathmandu Valley have been studied at length for\nthe last two decades. In-valley surface water options include storage and reallocation of water\nuse.  In-valley  storage  in  the  foothills  has  high  cost  and  low  yield  because  of  the  steep  slopes\nand  limited  catchments.  Storage  lower  in  the  valley  have  high  social  costs  and  water  quality\nproblems  due  to  population  density  and  land  use.  In-valley  options  do  not  compete  with  the\nMelamchi  in  terms  of  cost  or  social  disruption.  The  possibility  of  reallocating  water  from  low\neconomic  value  to  water  supply  has  been  considered  but  is  subject  to  social  and  legal\ndifficulties.  Alternative  sources  from  outside  the  valley  have  been  considered  at  length  but\neliminated  on  the  grounds  of  high  pumping  costs  and/or  low  capacity  for  future  expansion.\nAlternative arrangements for the Melamchi have been examined including high and low tunnels,\nwith and without reservoir, and with and without hydropower. The arrangement now proposed,\nwith low level tunnel, no impoundment storage, and no hydropower is the least cost and least\nenvironmentally disruptive. Furthermore, the option for low cost gravity expansion of supply from\nthe Yangri and Larke rivers and in-valley storage in the future is retained.\n\n4.\n\nSubsidies\n\n19.\nThe Government has agreed that full cost recovery for the water supplies in Kathmandu\nwill  be  phased  in  by  2010,  which  is  about  three  years  after  commissioning  of  the  Project.\nNevertheless, a number of subsidies are provided despite the full cost recovery concept:\n\n\f66\n\nAppendix 11, Page 5\n\n(i)  Subsidy provided to NWSC. The funds to develop the Project are passed on to\nthe  NWSC  as  50  percent  grant  and  50  percent  loan.  This  is  comparable  to  the\ncurrent policy for capital works in Greater Colombo Water Supply, but it is expected\nto  be  terminated  in  consideration  of  any  new  water  supply  works  necessary  for\nKathmandu Valley after 2010.\n\n(ii)  Subsidy  for  all  capital  works  for  wastewater  improvements.  This  is  being\nprovided  as  a  grant.  This  follows  policy  adopted  elsewhere  in  Asia  and  in  many\nparts of the developed world.\n\n(iii)  Subsidy  to  users  of  groundwater  in  Kathmandu  Valley.  Industrial  and\ncommercial  users  in  particular  take  this  water  for  free,  although  the  cost  of\nextraction by pumping is significant. By December 2002, this subsidy is expected\nto  be  phased  out  with  the  introduction  of  licensing  and  charging  for  major\ngroundwater extraction.\n\n(iv)  Subsidy to farmers within Kathmandu Valley. This is a social issue that will be\naddressed  over  the  next  few  years  under  the  Project  as  part  of  a  technical\nassistance optimizing water use in Kathmandu Valley.\n\n(v)  Subsidy  to  industries  in  Kathmandu  Valley.  This  subsidy  will  be  phased  out\nthrough legislation and institutional controls introduced under the Project whereby\nthe polluting industries will be given assistance to relocate and provide appropriate\ntreatment of their effluents.\n\n(vi)  Cross-subsidy. Perhaps the most important, this is the subsidy provided by other\nwater users to the urban poor to enable them to have equitable access to adequate\nand clean water. Ideally, this should be paid to the NWSC by the Government as a\nseparate  social  subsidy;  but  as  all  water  users  enjoy  some  subsidies,  it  is\nreasonable to accept the concept of a cross-subsidy whereby the better-off users\nsubsidize the poor.\n\n(vii)  Subsidy to a private operator  to manage the water supply. This is expected to\nbe  eliminated  after  the  first  three  years  of  the  lease  contract  when  sufficient\nrevenues from tariffs should be generated to cover these costs.\n\n5.\n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return\n\n20.\nFor the economic evaluation of the Project, costs with the Project less costs without the\nProject,  have  been  taken  as  $322  million  and  a  standard  conversion  factor  of  0.9  applied.\nIncremental operation and maintenance costs are considered to be 1 percent of the Melamchi\ncosts  plus  $0.04/m3  of  water  produced.  Economic  benefits  are  evaluated  using  the  demand\ncurves  and  associated  income  and  price  parameters  to  calculate  nonincremental  and\nincremental benefits for each year. To the extent that the consumer recognizes the benefits and\nthis is reflected in the price paid for water, the approach internalizes the benefits associated with\nhealth, welfare, and convenience. It shows benefits of around NRs1500 million per year in the\nfirst  years  after  the  Project  is  commissioned.  The  benefits  then  increase  to  about  NRs6000\nmillion per year from 2020.\n\n\f67\n\nAppendix 11, Page 6\n\nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Project is 13.5 percent. The EIRR for\n21.\nthe Project at full development is 15.3 percent. The total cost of the Project is high because of\nthe need to provide a sound basis for expansion in the future. Much of the costs now will reduce\nfuture expansion costs. Sensitivity analysis of the EIRR shows that it is sensitive to the level of\ntariff. If real tariff levels remain unchanged, the EIRR would be 8.9 percent. If water loss remains\nat 40 percent, the EIRR would be 10.1 percent. If real income growth were to be only 1 percent\nper year, the EIRR would be 11.9 percent. Due to the price elasticity of demand, increasing the\nnondomestic tariff by 50 percent lowers the EIRR to 12.9 percent. If capital costs are 10 percent\nhigher than estimated, the EIRR will fall to 12.6 percent. The EIRR is not sensitive to delays in\nimplementation.  The detailed economic analysis is set out in Supplementary Appendix B.\n\n\f68\n\nAppendix 12, page 1\n\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES\n\nAdverse Impacts\n\nMitigation Measures\n\n\u2022  No inundated area involved due\n\nto steep river gradient\n\n\u2022  Existing demands of water for\nirrigation, water mills, and\ndomestic use can be met in the\ndry season.\n\n\u2022  Water extraction volume will be\ncontrolled, and water will be\nused for water supply purposes\nonly.\n\n\u2022  Social uplift program will be\nimplemented in Melamchi\nValley during construction and\nmaintained permanently\nthrough a royalty payment from\nthe KV consumers.\n\n\u2022  Permanent river water use and\nfisheries management program\n\n\u2022  Balanced cut and fill design;\nspoil will be compacted and\nstabilized by planting; upslope\nand downslope gabions will be\nused; careful attention will be\npaid to drainage\n\n\u2022  Compensation will be paid\n\u2022  Replacement trees will be\n\nplanted\n\n\u2022  Limited construction hours and\nwatering of dust-prone areas\n\u2022  Royalty from KV consumers will\npay for road maintenance\n\u2022  Preparation of spoil site to\naffect stable foundation on\nstable geology\n\n\u2022  Compaction of spoil and\n\neffective drainage of spoil site\n\u2022  Landscaping of completed site\n\u2022  Site selection of barren land\n\nwhere feasible\n\nActions\n\n1.

As  part  of  project\npreparation, it comprises (i) resettlement census/surveys for the Melamchi diversion scheme main\naccess road (i.e. Sindhupalchok District, 114 households, 1999), Mahankal water treatment plant\narea  (56  affected  households,  1999),  and  bulk  distribution  system  (2000);  (ii)  socioeconomic\nsurveys  in  Kathmandu  Valley  (128,000  households  in  1996/97  and  another  1,100  households  in\n1999); (iii) surveys, participatory rural appraisals, and public consultations in the Melamchi Valley;\n(iv) nongovernment organization (NGO) consultations in Melamchi and Kathmandu valleys; and (v)\nhygiene  surveys  (550  households)  and  PRA  exercises  (20  sites)  in  Kathmandu  Valley.  Major\noutside sources include a study on the water supply and sanitation services for the urban poor by\nthe World Bank/United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Water and Sanitation Program,\nand other statistics and studies.\n\nB. \n\nSocioeconomic and Poverty Profiles of Project Impact Areas\n\n1. \n\nKathmandu Valley\n\n2.\nDemographic  Profile.  Kathmandu  Valley  (500  square  kilometer)  with  a  population  of  1.5\nmillion  comprises  five  municipalities,  including  the  three  major  ones  (i.e.  Bhaktapur,  Kathmandu,\nand Lalitpur).  Its population grew by 2.4 times over the last two decades (5.0 percent per annum).\nThe  average  household  size  is  7.1  with  variation  among  municipalities  (6.7  in  Lalitpur  and  8.3  in\nBhaktapur).    In  terms  of  ethnicity/caste,  the  Newars  are  dominant  (72  percent),  followed  by  the\nBrahmins  (13  percent),  the  Chhetris  (8  percent),  and  many  other  groups.  The  Project  will  not\nadversely impact on a specific ethnic/caste group.\n\n3.\nSocioeconomic  Profile.  The  livelihood  pattern  in  Kathmandu  Valley  is  that  of  urban;  86\npercent  of  the  households  are  engaged  in  urban-based  employment  (31  percent  employed,  55\npercent self-employed) such as manufacturing, construction, commerce, transport, communication,\nfinance,  and  other  businesses.  Only  10  percent  work  in  agriculture.  Most  households  have  more\nthan  one  income  source.  Access  to  health,  education,  services,  and  basic  infrastructure  is  better\nthan  the  national  average,  although  overcrowding  and  poor  maintenance  and  deterioration  of\nfacilities are widely observed.\n\n4.\nPoverty.  About  45  percent  of  the  population  in  Nepal  live  below  poverty  line,  using\nNRs4,400 per capita per annum as the poverty threshold. The country is ranked 144th among 174\ncountries  in  the  UNDP\u2019s  1997  human  development  index,  reflecting  its  low  performance  in  the\nhuman development sector. Poverty incidence in Kathmandu Valley is unclear, but the most recent\nestimate  shows  around  12-15  percent  (Water  and  Sanitation  Program,  2000).  Average  income\nlevel  also  varies  across  municipalities;  41  percent  of  total  households  in  Kathmandu  municipality\nhave  monthly  incomes  of  NRs12,000  and  above,  whereas  only  22  percent  of  households  in\nBhaktapur municipality have this much income.\n\n5.\nKathmandu Valley has many pockets of poverty, mostly found in slums (established legal\nsettlements),  squatter  settlements,2  or  rented  accommodation.    Of  these,  the  poor  living  in  the\nslums  are  generally  low  caste,  while  the  squatter  population  tends  to  be  more  heterogeneous. \nRental  accommodation  is  occupied  by  a  range  of  low-income  groups  such  as  day  laborers,\nhawkers, and un/semiskilled factory workers. The poor usually live in small settlements scattered\n\n                    \n1  For project impacts, see the main text, paras. 123-125 and Appendix 10 (Summary Resettlement Plan).\n2  A 1996 survey by an NGO, Lumanti, found 47 squatter settlements with 1,783 households, 20 percent of which were\n\nheaded by women.\n\n\f72\n\nAppendix 13, page 2\n\naround  the  valley,  adjacent  to  higher-income  settlements,  and  therefore,  it  is  difficult  to  locate\nthem, especially individual low-income renters.  Street children are also a growing concern for their\nvulnerability.\n\n2. \n\nMelamchi Valley\n\n6.\nDemographic Profile. The Project\u2019s zone of impact in Melamchi Valley includes 14 village\ndevelopment committees (VDCs) in Sindhupalchok (79 VDCs altogether; 11 directly affected and\nthree  indirectly  affected)  and  three  VDCs  in  Kabhre  Palanchok  District  (marginally  indirectly\naffected). The population of the direct impact zone in Sindhupalchok District is about 40,000, with\nan average household size of 6.8 persons. The districtwide ethnic/caste composition is: Tamangs\n(33 percent) who are dominant in the hills, Chhetris (19 percent) and Brahmins (12 percent) who\nare  dominant  in  the  valleys  and  lowlands,  Newars  (12  percent),  and  others.  Among  them,  the\nTamangs  (usually  marginal  landholders)  and  lower  castes  (usually  landless)  are  economically\ndisadvantaged.\n\n7.\nPoverty  and  Livelihood.  The  poverty  incidence  of  Sindhupalchok  District  is  estimated  to\nbe 50-55 percent. The economy is predominantly rural, with 90 percent of the population engaged\nin  farming  and  fishing  activities,  and  85  percent  living  at  subsistence  level.  The  average\nlandholding size in the district is small at 0.62 ha, and the land fragmentation and the topography\nin the hills, combined with lack of access to agricultural inputs, extension, technology, credit, and\nmarkets,  are  impediments  to  improving  agricultural  productivity.    In  much  of  the  Project  zone  of\nimpact,  there  is  a  lack  of  basic  educational  facilities  and  teachers.  The  illiteracy  rate  in  direct\nimpact zone was 11 percent for males and 25 percent for females (NORPLAN, 1999).  The health\nsituation  and  sanitary  condition  in  the  zone  of  impact  is  poor,  and  malnutrition  is  common\nespecially  among  women  of  reproductive  age  and  children.  Basic  health  facilities  are  lacking. \nWomen are disproportionately affected by the daily hardship of poverty due to their multiple tasks\nin the domestic and productive arenas.\n\nTrafficking of girls. Sindhupalchok District, especially Tamang communities, is historically\n8.\nknown  for  trafficking  of  girls.  The  push  factors  are  complex,  encompassing  the  established\nrecruitment  syndicate  over  time,  alleged  backing  by  high-ranking  officials  and  politicians,  specific\nexotic appearance of certain ethnic groups favored by the market, poverty, cultural perceptions and\nlow status of women, and lack of awareness by the communities.  Over the last five years or so,\nassistance agencies and NGOs have made significant investments in antitrafficking activities. The\nresults to date are mixed; while the level of community awareness appears to have been raised,\nthe actual prosecution cases are still limited (about 5 percent). In addition, a number of NGOs are\nworking in a poorly coordinated manner, though efforts are being made by the district development\ncommittee (DDC) Task Force to improve the situation.  \n\nC. \n\nPractices, Perceptions and Needs\n\n1. \n\nKathmandu Valley3\n\n9.\nAccess  to  Water  Supply.  The  present  water  supply  by  the  Nepal  Water  Supply\nCorporation (NWSC) shows that an average person in the valley receives only 40 percent of their\npotential  demand  in  the  dry  season  and  60  percent  in  the  wet  season.  Currently,  86  percent  of\nKathmandu  Valley  population  are  the  registered  customers  of  NWSC-supplied  water,  through\nabout 100,000 private connections and/or 1,300 community standposts; 76 percent have meters.\n\n                    \n3  This  section  draws  heavily  from  the  Nippon  Koei  survey  (1999).  Analysis  of  the  urban  poor  primarily  draws  upon:\nMeeting the Water and Sanitation Needs of the Kathmandu Poor: Issues and Options for Service Delivery (Water and\nSanitation Program \u2013 South Asia, June 2000).\n\n\f73\n\nAppendix 13, page 3\n\nAmong them, only one third of customers have fully plumbed household connections and most rely\non  a  shared  supply  (i.e.,  yard  tap  and  standpost).  In  the  dry  season  many  have  to  resort  to\nexpensive tankered supply. Moreover, 82 percent of the NWSC customers are dissatisfied with the\ncurrent NWSC services, due to (i) insufficient quantity; (ii) poor quality; (iii) unreliability of supply,\nespecially in the dry season (on average 2 hours per day, every other day); 35 out of 112 wards in\nthe valley not having any NWSC water supply in the last two to three months of the dry season);\nand  (iv)  difficulties  paying  water  bills  (e.g.,  cumbersome  procedures,  long  lines).  However,  55\npercent  of  survey  respondents  thought  the  cost  was  reasonable.  Twenty  percent  took  away  the\nwater  meter,  a  sign  of  refusal  to  pay  bills.  Most  (86  percent)  NWSC  customers  also  use  diverse\nsecondary sources, including (from the highest) tubewell/rowing pump, well, Hiti (traditional spring\nfed water spout), neighbor, water vendor, public standpipe, and others. The most common storage\ntype is roof tank (52 percent), followed by pumped underground tank (34 percent), complemented\nby pots and buckets.\n\n10.\nNon-NWSC  Water  Supply.  Non-NWSC  customers  (14  percent  of  population)  in  general\nbelong to lower income groups than the customers. Fifty-two percent claimed that they do not have\naccess to enough water. The major water sources used by the noncustomers are similar to those\nby the customers, though reliance on public stand pipe is the highest (54 percent in the wet and 36\npercent  in  the  dry  seasons).  Water  vending  is  not  an  option  due  to  the  high  cost.  For\nnoncustomers, the frequency of water collection is four times a day on average.\n\nPoverty and Gender. The most disadvantaged group in terms of access to water are the\n11.\nindividual  low-income  renters,  as  they  depend  on  their  landlords  for  water  services  and  are  not\nsupported by community services. On the other hand, poverty/income level does affect the pattern\nof  water  and  sanitation  management  practices.  Hardship  in  water  management  is  more  severe\nthe  predominant\namong \nresponsibilities  of  water  collection,  storage,  and  treatment.    The  average  time  spent  on  water\ncollection in squatter and slum settlements in the same study was 58 minutes. NWSC water supply\nis  often  at  odd  hours  (e.g.,  midnight  to  3  a.m.),  which  could  jeopardize  women\u2019s  safety;  some\ncases of young women being attacked by local gangs while collecting water from the community\ntaps have been reported.\n\nthe  poorer  households,  and  mostly  among  women  who  bear \n\nHygiene and Sanitation.4 Water-borne diseases due to the poor water quality are common\n12.\nin Kathmandu Valley, especially among children; diarrhea, stomach pain, dysentery, skin diseases,\neye infections, hepatitis, malaria are widely observed.  However, 90 percent of the population did\nnot think they were frequently suffering from water-related disease, indicating a need for hygiene\nawareness raising. Water quality is worsened by contamination from polluted shallow groundwater\nand leaky distribution pipes. Seventy-two percent reported the practice of domestic water treatment\nbut  boiling  was  only  20  percent.  Of  those  who  did  not  use  any  treatment,  87  percent  thought  it\nunnecessary.  The  prevalence  of  latrines  is  low:  according  to  United  Nations  Children's  Fund\n(UNICEF)  estimates:  16  percent  in  rural  and  51  percent  in  urban  Kathmandu  Valley  in  1996/97.\nThe reasons for not having a toilet were costs, lack of space, no water, no sewer, and no perceived\nneed.  Among  water  users,  only  27  percent  are  connected  to  the  sewage  system,  most  of  which\ndischarges straight into the Bagmati River. The valley has a limited capacity of sewage treatment.\nDrainage is poorly developed, which causes frequent flooding of septic tanks and other sanitation\nfacilities. Kathmandu Valley\u2019s solid waste problem is well known. Of the households surveyed, 26\npercent reported disposing of solid waste in the street.  Much of it is also disposed of along river\nbanks,  contributing  to  water  contamination.    Hygiene  is  also  poor;  for  example,  29  percent  of\nsurvey respondents did not know that the poor water quality was harmful to health.\n\n                    \n4 Mainly drawing from Hygiene Survey (Nippon Koei, 2000).\n\n\f74\n\nAppendix 13, page 4\n\n13.\nSanitation  for  the  Poor.    Among  the  low-income  communities,  latrine  coverage  is\nincreasing  with  the  assistance  of  local  authorities  and  NGOs,  but  toilets  tend  to  be  unhygienic\nespecially  in  squatter  settlements.    Where  pay-and-use  toilets  are  found,  they  are  relatively  well\nfunctioning  and  maintained.    Solid  waste  disposal  is  a  great  concern,  though  there  is  a  case  for\ncommunity-based  service  functioning  on  a  user  payment  basis.    Drainage  is  a  major  problem  in\nmany  low-income  settlements.    With  NGO  support,  there  are  also  cases  of  savings  and  credit,\nproviding  potential  for  user  investment  in  sanitation  infrastructure  upgrading.    As  in  water\nmanagement, hygiene management is also considered a primary responsibility for women.\n\n14. Water  Supply.    Results  from  various  surveys  and  studies  indicate  strong  needs  and\ndemands among the current NWSC customers for better water services with more quantity, better\nquality, more reliability (i.e., every day, whole day supply) and user-friendliness (e.g., methods of\npayment, service agents\u2019 attitudes). Among the non-NWSC customers, 63 percent responded that\nthey would like to be registered with NWSC. The reasons for not registering include availability of\nother  water  sources,  costs,  poor  service  of  NWSC,  and  no  water  distribution  pipe.    In  general,\nNWSC  does  not  project  a  good  corporate  image  among  customers  and  noncustomers.  A  high\ninterest in the formation of water user committees was expressed (83 percent).\n\n15. Willingness  to  Pay.  About  82  percent  of  all  respondents  (both  customers  and\nnoncustomers of NWSC service) showed willingness to pay more, on average NRs167 per month,\nranging from NRs93 per month (for the income group below NRs3,999 per month) to NRs229 per\nmonth  (for  the  income  group  above  NRs12,000  per  month),  on  condition  that  they  are  given\nsufficient information on what the supply will be like. The willingness to pay for public standpipes\nwas much lower at 43 percent. \n\nHygiene  and  Sanitation.    Both  the  awareness  and  practice  of  basic  hygiene  were  low;\n16.\nthese  influence  and  are  influenced  by  the  inadequacy  of  sanitation-related  infrastructure  and\nsystems  (e.g.,  latrines,  drainage,  sewage,  solid  waste  management)  and  weak  commitment  and\nconsensus  by  the  public  administration  on  the  investment  in  such  infrastructure/service\nimprovement.  However, experience elsewhere shows that beneficiaries, including the poor, have\nthe capacity of maximizing the benefits of improved infrastructure and services, if they are provided\nwith intensive awareness raising support involving not only public campaigns but also community-\nbased participatory learning.  Nevertheless, awareness raising is only effective if it goes with the\nactual improvement of water supply and sanitation services.\n\n2.\n\nPerceptions and Needs of the Melamchi Valley\n\nIn  general,  Melamchi  Valley  will  be  an  environmentally  (e.g.,  reduced  water  for  irrigation\n17.\nand  domestic  use,  noise  and  pollution  by  the  construction,  negative  impact  on  biological\nenvironment) and socially (e.g., resettlement and land acquisition, potential conflict with incoming\noutsiders)  adversely  affected  area  by  the  Project,  although  improved  infrastructure  (e.g.  access\nroads) and the expanded local markets with the incoming construction and other workers will also\nbenefit its population. \n\n18.\nFrom the early stage of project conceptualization, the local communities and leaders have\nraised concerns of such adverse impacts.  A series of public consultations and NGO consultation\nworkshops  have  taken  place  to  identify  the  perceptions  and  needs  of  Melamchi  Valley\ncommunities and explore ways to transform the mitigation measures into sustainable development\nopportunities.  A  major  concern  of  the  communities  is  not  the  project  design  itself  but  the\nGovernment\u2019s  commitment  to  deliver,  including  the  compensation  and  mitigation  packages. \nAffected communities of the valley wish to see tangible service delivery and the Government\u2019s\n\n\f75\n\nAppendix 13, page 5\n\nphysical  presence  (instead  of  consultants)  in  the  affected  areas  so  they  can  confirm  the\nGovernment\u2019s  sincerity  and  commitment.  Therefore,  the  Project  identified  the  importance  of  (i)\nsequencing  assistance  (i.e.,  simple  physical  assistance  such  as  school  rehabilitation  first,  under\nthe  social  uplift  program  [SUP]);  (ii)  starting  the  land  acquisition/compensation  process  without\ndelays; and (iii) ensuring Melamchi Water Supply Development Board (MWSDB) representation in\nall consensus building meetings.\n\nD.\n\nSocial and Poverty Strategy\n\nResettlement Action Plan and Social Uplift Program. Social mitigation and rehabilitation\n19.\nmeasures  will  be  implemented  under  the  RAP  and  the  SUP.  The  SUP  will  include  development\nactivities for the Melamchi Valley covering five areas: buffer zone development, rural electrification,\nhealth,  education,  and  income  generation/community  development.  Women\u2019s  special  needs  for\nreproductive  health,  adult  literacy,  skills  development  and  income  generation,  legal  awareness\nraising,  and  antitrafficking  of  women  and  girls  will  also  be  addressed.  To  ensure  ownership  and\nsustainability,  the  SUP  will  (i)  take  a  participatory  approach  through  community  mobilizers;  (ii)\nutilize  the  institutional  structure  of  the  ongoing  Local  Governance  Program  whereby  capacity\nbuilding for DDC and VDCs will be conducted through the programs, assisted by experts; and (iii)\nbe run by the levy paid by Kathmandu Valley water users in the postconstruction stage.\n\n20.\nStakeholder Participation.  The Project has been prepared with extensive participation of\nstakeholders  from  all  sides,  including  beneficiaries,  adversely  affected  people,  VDC  and  ward\nrepresentatives,  DDC/municipality  officials  and  representatives,  concerned  ministries  and\nMWSDB, NGOs, the private sector, financing agencies, and consultants. The Project will address\ndirect  participation  of  beneficiaries  through  (i)  the  SUP  implementation  (through  community\ngroups);  (ii)  representation  of  adversely  affected  people  in  the  compensation  determination\ncommittee;  (iii)  representation  of  Kathmandu  Valley  beneficiaries  in  final  environmental  impact\nassessment  stakeholder  meeting;  (iv)  water  user  groups  and  forest  user  groups  in  both  valleys;\nand (v) implementation of the hygiene education and promotion program.\n\n21.\nConsensus Building. Consensus building is necessary at all levels, especially at the start\nof the Project. Key issues for consensus building include: the amount of the water levy, access to\nwater  (e.g.,  quantity,  distribution),  water  tariff,  private  sector  management,  environmental  and\nsocial  mitigation,  compensation,  and  employment.  A  dispute  resolution  expert,  to  be  assisted  by\nPMU  and  other  project  staff,  consultants  and  NGOs,  will  be  hired  to  facilitate  this  process.    For\nadversely  impacted  communities,  local  consultative  groups  will  be  established  in  each  affected\nVDC.  The signing of a memorandum of understanding between the affected VDCs and the Project\nwill be a condition for the civil works contract award.\n\n23.\nNGO Participation Plan.  An NGO participation plan was developed in close consultation\nwith  NGOs  working  in  the  Melamchi  and  Kathmandu  valleys.  NGOs  will  act  as  facilitators  to\nstrengthen the capacity of local government bodies by implementing the SUP, hygiene awareness\nraising in Kathmandu Valley, and project monitoring and evaluation. An inventory of 56 NGOs has\nbeen made and the selection criteria developed. Independently from the NGO participation plan, a\nthird  party  will  be  contracted  to  undertake  external  monitoring  for  the  resettlement  and\ncompensation activities.\n\n24.\nEmployment Strategy.  Based on the consultations and review of existing studies, it was\ndecided  that  setting  a  quota  for  local  employment  for  construction  works  would  be  very  difficult,\ndue to the contractors\u2019 unwillingness because of the higher wages demanded by the local laborers\nand their unavailability throughout the year (because of agricultural and other demands). However,\npeople  severely  affected  by  the  Project  and  the  identified  vulnerable  groups  will  have  highest\npriority access to such employment opportunities, as part of their entitlement.\n\n\f76\n\nAppendix 13, page 6\n\n25.\nHygiene  Education  and  Promotion  Program  (HEPP).    The  program  was  developed\nbased on the survey, PRAs, and a good practice model in urban Nepal (e.g., Pokhara, Bhaktapur).\nComprehensive  hygiene  awareness  raising  activities  will  be  conducted  in  two  phases:  a  pilot\nphase (10 sites for one year) and a full-fledged stage (valley-wide for two years).\n\n26. Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  for  the  Poor.    Under  the  private  sector  lease  contract,\nvarious  targeted  mechanisms  are  currently  proposed  on  financial  (e.g.,  affordable  user  charge,\nequitable tariff structure), institutional (e.g., NGO support, user groups), and technical (e.g., better\naccess  to  piped  water,  appropriate  technology,  easy  maintenance)  aspects.  Discussions  with\nstakeholders will determine specific approaches taken by the Project. These include the formation\nof a low-income customer service and education unit.\n\n27.\nPublic Relations. The Project will launch a proactive public relations campaign, given the\nProject\u2019s high profile and potential public concerns that could jeopardize project implementation. \nThe  campaign  will  (i)  inform  the  beneficiaries  and  affected  people  about  the  Project  to  counter\nmisinformation; (ii) develop public support for the Project; (iii) identify any potential conflict area at\nan  early  stage  (to  feed  into  the  consensus  building  activities);  (iv)  assist  in  problem  solving\nbetween the Project and local communities; and (v) manage public expectation on compensation\nand the SUP. A web site will be developed and maintained.\n\n28.\nTraining.  Various training activities for the project staff, Ministry of Physical Planning and\nWorks,  and  beneficiaries  are  proposed  under  the  Project.    In  addition  to  a  number  of  women-\nspecific training courses, joint (i.e., men and women) training courses will target at least 40 percent\nwomen\u2019s participation.  Gender training will be conducted for the project staff, given the prominent\nrole  played  by  women  in  water  supply  and  sanitation.  The  SUP  will  include  relevant  training,\nincluding  hygiene  education.  Contractors  will  be  required  to  provide  both  operating  manuals  and\nsuitable  training  to  the  operators  of  the  plant  and  equipment  provided  under  their  contract.\nConsultants will be required to provide both structured and on-the-job training to their government\ncounterpart staff.\n\n29.\nImplementation  Arrangements.  To  coordinate  activities  to  ensure  that  the  project\ncomponents  are  implemented  adequately  and  appropriately  and  address  social  concerns,  an\nenvironment  and  social  development  division  will  be  established  in  the  project  management  unit\n(PMU) assisted by various consultants. For community-based activities, NGOs will be mobilized to\nassist local government agencies with implementation. NGO activities in the Melamchi Valley will\nbe managed by the SUP implementation team, to be supervised by the PMU. The panel of experts\n will also include a social expert.\n\n30.\nSocial  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  NGOs  will  be  mobilized  to  monitor  the  progress  of\ncommunity-based  activities.    Benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  indicators  will  be  gender-\ndisaggregated  wherever  possible,  and  also  include  the  poverty  reduction  impact  of  the  SUP  and\nthe water services for the poor in Kathmandu Valley.  Resettlement monitoring will be conducted\nboth  internally  (by  the  Project)  and  externally  (third  party).  Monitoring  of  the  public  relations  and\nconsensus building activities will be by the MWSDB and PMU and the panel of experts.\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS\n(as of 24 November 2000)\n", "Currency Unit\nNre1.00\n$1.00\n", "\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n", "Nepalese (Rupee/s (NR/NRs)\n$0.01040\nNRs74.72\n", "(i)\n", "(ii)\n", "The  Nepalese  rupee  is  pegged  to  the  Indian  rupee  (Re)  at  NRs1.60  to  Re1.00  and  is\nfully convertible on all current account transactions.\nFor  calculations  in  this  report,  an  exchange  rate  $1.00  =  NRs72.00  is  used,  the  rate\nprevailing at appraisal.\n", "ADB\nBDS\nCIDA\nDDC\nDWSS\nEIRR\nHEPP\nICB\nIS\nJBIC\nKVWA \nLCB\nlpcpd\nMDS\nMLD\nMOF\nMPPW\nMWSDB\nNDF\nNGO\nNORAD\nNPC\nNWSC\nO&M\nOPEC\nOPEC Fund\nPMU\nPO\nPOE\nRAP\nSida\nSTP\nSUP\nTA\nVDC\nWTP\n", "\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n-\n\u2013\n\u2013\n", "ABBREVIATIONS\n", "Asian Development Bank\nbulk distribution system\nCanadian International Development Agency\ndistrict development committee\nDepartment of Water Supply and Sewerage\neconomic internal rate of return\nhygiene education and promotion program\ninternational competitive bidding\ninternational shopping\nJapan Bank for International Cooperation\nKathmandu Valley Water Authority\nlocal competitive bidding\nliters per capita per day\nMelamchi Diversion Scheme\nmillion liters per day\nMinistry of Finance\nMinistry of Physical Planning and Works\nMelamchi Water Supply Development Board\nNordic Development Fund\nnongovernment organization\nNorwegian Agency for International Cooperation\nNational Planning Commission\nNepal Water Supply Corporation\noperation and maintenance\nOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries\nOPEC Fund for International Development\nProject Management Unit\nprivate operator\nPanel of Experts\nresettlement action plan\nSwedish International Development Cooperation Agency\nsewage treatment plant\nsocial uplift program\ntechnical assistance\nvillage development committee\nwater treatment plant\n", "NOTE\n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars.\n", "CONTENTS\n", "Page\n", "LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY\n", "MAP\n", "I.\n", "II.\n", "THE PROPOSAL\n", "INTRODUCTION\n", "III.\n", "BACKGROUND\n", "IV.\n", "THE PROPOSED PROJECT\n", "A.\nB.\nC.\nD.\nE.\nF.\nG.\n", "A.\nB.\nC.\nD.\nE.\nF.\nG.\nH.\n", "A.\nB.\nC.\nD.\nE.\n", "Sector Description\nGovernment Policies and Plans\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\nLessons Learned\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\nPolicy Dialogue\nProject History\n", "Rationale\nObjectives and Scope\nTechnical Justification\nCost Estimates\nFinancing Plan\nThe Executing Agency\nImplementation Arrangements\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n", "Financial and Economic Analyses \nEnvironment\nSocial Dimensions\nImpact on Poverty\nRisks\n", "V.\n", "PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n", "VI.\n", "ASSURANCES\n", "VII.\n", "RECOMMENDATION\n", "APPENDIXES\n", "  ii\n", "  vi\n", "   1\n", "   1\n", "   1\n", "   1\n   5\n   7\n   7\n   8\n   8\n 10\n", " 10\n", " 10\n 11\n 13\n 14\n 15\n 16\n 16\n 20\n", " 23\n", " 23\n 26\n 27\n 28\n 28\n", " 29\n", " 32\n", " 33\n"]}
