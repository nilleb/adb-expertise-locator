THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \npackage of up to $100,000,000 equivalent in yuan, comprising (i) an A loan of up to $40,000,000 \nequivalent in yuan; and (ii) a complementary loan of up to $60,000,000 equivalent in yuan to New \nHope Liuhe Co., Ltd. (NHL) for the Integrated and Sustainable Livestock Value Chain Project in \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). \n \n2.  The project will support the expansion of NHL\u2019s integrated livestock business with the \nconstruction of two hog farms and a meat-processing plant. Through this project, the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) will promote a business model for livestock production that is inclusive; \nresource-efficient; and with less impact on the environment, climate change, and public health.   \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n1.  Project Identification \n \n3.  Importance of livestock in the People\u2019s Republic of China. Livestock contributes to \nnearly half of total gross domestic product generated by the agriculture in the PRC.1 Pork is \ntraditionally the most important source of animal protein for PRC consumers and total pork \nconsumption was about 55 million tons in 2018, corresponding to half of global pork consumption. \nHowever, the PRC hog sector is facing severe interrelated issues: biosecurity risks, pollution, \nimpact on climate change, antibiotic overuse, and low productivity.  \n   \n4.  Biosecurity risks. Hog farms in the PRC have historically been exposed to a range of \nanimal diseases, which have caused moderate losses. African Swine Fever (ASF), however, is a \nparticularly big threat as it is lethal for hogs, highly contagious, and incurable. The first reported \nASF case in the PRC occurred in August 2018 and the virus has spread to almost every province. \nASF will reduce the total number of live hogs in the PRC by as much as 50% by the end of 2019. \nSmall hog farmers with inadequate biosecurity management systems are expected to bear most \nof the economic losses. To tackle this pressing challenge, the Government of the PRC intensified \nefforts to develop a vaccine (which would be the world\u2019s first), restricted cross-province transport \nof live hogs, and introduced policies to compensate farms that cull infected hogs (footnote 1).    \n \n5.  Pollution concerns. The PRC hog sector generates about 864 million tons of animal \nwaste per year, equivalent to one-third of total animal waste generated by the PRC livestock \nsector.2 The government has significantly tightened environmental regulations since 2010 to force \nthe hog sector to invest more in waste management treatment.  However, enforcing these \nregulations remains a challenge because small hog farms (with fewer than 500 hogs), which \ncontribute to about half of total hog production in the PRC, are so numerous and unsophisticated.3 \n  \n6.  Climate change impact. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations \nreports that livestock contribute to 14.5% of all human-induced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, \n \n1  Sector Overview (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n2  Guangdong Agricultural Science Journal. 2015. PRC academic document code: 1004-874X (2015) 16-0175-05   \n3  Government of the PRC, Ministry of Agriculture (press conference, 29 September 2017).  \n ", "2   \n \nof which about 81% is attributable to ruminants and only 9% to hogs,4 largely because the GHG \nemission per unit of pork is much lower than that of beef. Hog farming is more efficient in \nproducing animal protein than cattle farming because hog farming requires less feed and water \nper kilogram of animal protein produced, which helps strengthen food security. By encouraging \nthe development of large-scale industrial hog farming, the government seeks to mitigate climate \nchange through greater efficiency in production and waste management, and to adapt to climate \nchange through large farms\u2019 ability to maintain stable and climate-resilient production.   \n \n7.  Antibiotic  overuse.  Antibiotics  are  an  acceptable  veterinary  tool  in treating  animal \ndiseases when used appropriately. However, antibiotic overuse has become an issue among \nsmall hog farmers in the PRC, who typically give the hogs feedstuff mixed with antibiotic additives, \nwhich results in animal wastes contaminated with antibiotic remnants. Animal waste with too much \nantibiotic content cannot be readily used in producing organic fertilizer. Such waste must be \nproperly treated, which can be costly.5 If the waste is not properly treated before being discharged \ninto the natural environment, the antibiotic remnants can contaminate underground water and \ncontribute to growing antimicrobial resistance, posing a significant threat to public health.   \n \n8.  Modernization  to  increase  resource  efficiency.  The  government  promotes  the \nmodernization of hog farming not only to tackle environmental and health concerns but also to \nincrease farming efficiency. As the number of hogs per sow per year increased from 14 to 18 from \n2010 to 2018 in the PRC, the number of sows decreased from 50 million to 30 million. This trend \nwill continue as the percentage of modern farms increases and the number of hogs per sow per \nyear is still lower than in Europe and North America, where it is about 27-30. Since total pork \ndemand in the PRC started to decrease slightly in 2014 and is expected to continue to decrease \nslowly until 2028 (as the middle-class grows and continues to diversify its diet), there is no \npressing need to produce more pork. There is, however, an urgent need to produce better pork \n(as demand for high-quality and traceable pork rises), with much fewer resources; reduced animal \nlosses due to diseases; and less impact on the environment, climate, and public health.  \n \n9.  Project selection. The project team identified NHL as a suitable candidate for ADB\u2019s \nsupport because: (i) as an agribusiness conglomerate that operates along the entire livestock \nvalue chain (i.e. animal feed production, livestock farming, slaughtering, and meat processing), \nNHL is committed to high standards of environmental protection, climate change mitigation, \nanimal health, and food safety; (ii) NHL has a good track record of building and operating \nintegrated hog farms with advanced modern technology to maximize farming efficiency and \nproductivity; and (iii) NHL is willing to partner with ADB to improve its environmental and social \nstandards of its hog farming operations, following ADB\u2019s policies and requirements.  \n \n2.  Project Design \n \n10.  The project includes the construction of: (i) a hog farm in Huanghua, Hebei Province, with \na production capacity of 280,000 hogs per year (Huanghua farm); (ii) a hog farm in Xiangzhou, \nGuangxi Province, with a production capacity of 360,000 hogs per year (Xiangzhou farm); and \n(iii) a meat processing facility in Pinggu district, Beijing, with a processing capacity of 3,000 tons \nof pork meat per year (meat-processing plant). The farms will outsource about 50% of the hog-\nfattening process to about 1,000 small hog farmers within a radius of 100 kilometers of each farm. \n \n4  P.J. Gerber, H. Steinfeld, B. Henderson, A.

Integrated and inclusive hog farming model. NHL started as an animal feed producer \nand gradually expanded to poultry and hog farming and meat production as part of its integrated \nvalue chain strategy. In 2018, NHL produced 2.5 million hogs and 278,000 tons of pork meat. \nNHL adopts a contract hog farming model where NHL supplies weaned piglets and other farming \ninputs (such as feed, medicine, and vaccines) to contract farmers and buys back the hogs at a \nguaranteed minimum fee. The cost of the piglets and farming inputs is deducted from the fee. The \nfee is adjusted based on a set of metrics (such as the feed conversion ratio and the hog mortality \nrate) to incentivize good performance. The fee is also adjusted based on market prices, but not \nlower than the guaranteed minimum. The contract farming model helps farmers mitigate market \nrisk and earn a stable income. NHL provides extension services and financing support for farm \nconstruction and operations to ensure waste management and biosecurity standards and achieve \nan optimal scale of operations.    \n  \n12.  Strong biosecurity management. NHL is well-positioned to ensure a high biosecurity \nstandard because of the integrated nature of its business model. NHL implements biosecurity \nmanagement best practices on all its hog farms, such as (i) designing multiple access zones with \ndifferent quarantine requirements for input suppliers, farm managers, and farm employees; (ii) \nsupplying feed to hog farms from nearby NHL feed mills and selling finisher hogs to NHL slaughter \nhouses; and (iii) using NHL trucks to transport feed to NHL hog farms, and hogs to NHL slaughter \nhouses. For its contract farms, where biosecurity is inherently weaker, NHL has designed a \nstandard operating procedure for its employees to regularly inspect the farms with the aid of smart \nthermometers, which measure the body temperature of live hogs for potential ASF symptoms. \nNHL has also installed surveillance cameras at the contract farms. \n \n13.  Efficient animal waste treatment. NHL employs a waterless technique to collect animal \nwaste. A mechanical scraper system is installed underneath hog barns and separates solid and \nliquid waste. Solid manure is being transferred to storage and turned into organic fertilizer, while \nwastewater is treated in a biogas digester to produce methane gas for heating during winter and \ncanteen cooking on the farms, thereby mitigating climate change. The treated water and fertilizer \ncan be used in nearby crop fields as part of the company\u2019s sustainable circular agricultural system. \n \n14.  Climate change mitigation. NHL will become more efficient because of its integrated \nsupply chain. Mortality will be lower by better biosecurity management and by higher sow fertility \nresulting from the import of productive swine genetics. Less animal waste will be discharged and \nfewer inputs consumed, and greater efficiency will shrink NHL\u2019s carbon footprint. NHL will \nincorporate a biodigester system into its hog farming waste management strategy, which will \nfurther reduce GHG emissions in two ways. First, the biodigester will convert animal waste into \nbiogas and captures methane which would otherwise be released into the atmosphere. Second, \nthe biogas generated will be used in farms to replace electricity or other fuels to heat the facilities.  \n \n15.  Antibiotic-free pork processing. In 2017, NHL signed a partnership agreement with \nCooperl Arc Atlantique (Cooperl), a cooperative of French farmers and one of the largest hog \nproducers in Europe, to establish a 50:50 joint-venture to produce antibiotic-free pork products in \nthe PRC. Housed in NHL\u2019s existing food-processing factories, the proposed meat-processing \nplant is NHL\u2019s first processing plant that will pilot production of antibiotic-free meat. The joint-\nventure will initially import frozen antibiotic-free meat from France, until such time as NHL is able \n ", "4   \n \nto supply antibiotic-free meat from its nearby farm in Zhangjiakou, Hebei Province, which is now \nunder construction and will be operated according to Cooperl\u2019s antibiotic-free standards.6      \n \n3.  The Borrower \n \n16  Founded in 1982 by Liu Yonghao, NHL is a leading integrated animal protein producer in \nthe PRC, with major operations in animal feed production, livestock farming (poultry and hog), \nslaughtering, and meat processing. NHL is the largest animal feed producer in the PRC with an \nannual production capacity of about 16 million tons and a market share of about 8%. It is the \nsecond largest poultry breeder and the largest white-feather chicken farming company in the \nPRC, with annual sales volume of about 800 million chickens. In 2013, NHL started hog farming, \nwhich has since become the company\u2019s the most profitable business. NHL is listed on the \nShenzhen Stock Exchange and had a market capitalization of about $13.5 billion as of November \n2019. The company has more than 500 subsidiaries, with 61,000 employees, and established \noperations in more than 20 countries across Asia, North America, Europe, and Africa. Liu \nYonghao remains the company\u2019s controlling shareholder, with about 29% ownership directly and \nindirectly. In 2013, Liu Yonghao stepped down as chair of NHL. His daughter, Liu Chang, replaced \nhim and is fully responsible for NHL\u2019s management and operations. \n \n17  Integrity due diligence was conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s Integrity Due Diligence \nGuidelines for Nonsovereign Operations.7 No significant or potentially significant integrity risks \nwere identified. No tax integrity due diligence was required.8 \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n18  Impacts. The project is aligned with the key objectives of the PRC\u2019s Thirteenth Five-Year \nPlan (2016 - 2020): (i) development of agricultural production and value chains, and (ii) integration \nof rural areas into regional industry chains and production networks.9    \n \n19  Outcome. The project\u2019s outcome is the scale-up of efficient, inclusive, and sustainable \nagribusiness. The project will (i) improve the resource efficiency of hog farming in the PRC by \nincreasing the number of hogs per sow, improving the feed conversion ratio, and reducing water \nusage; (ii) promote an inclusive business model through an increase in the income of farm workers \nand contract farmers; and (iii) mitigate climate change by adopting waste management systems \nsuch as the biogas digester facility. The project will avoid at least 8,000 tons10 of carbon dioxide \nequivalents per annum starting in 2022. \n \n20  Outputs. The outputs of the project will be: (i) construction of a meat-processing plant \nwith antibiotic-free processing line; (ii) construction of two hog farms with waste management \nfacilities; (iii) generation of local jobs; (iv) support to the local economy; and (v) creation of a safe \nand productive environment for both women and men workers.    \n \n \n6  Antibiotic-free farming is a new concept in the PRC and the market for premium antibiotic-free meat needs to be \ntested. The Zhangjiakou farm will provide enough hogs for the antibiotic-free processing line in the proposed meat-\nprocessing plant. The Huanghua and Xiangzhou farms, which are located farther away, will not be antiotic-free but \nwill adopt best veterinarian practices ensuring an appropriate use of antibiotics as treatment for bacterial infections.  \n7  ADB. 2015.

NHL will engage with small hog farmers located \nnear its hog farms through a contract-farming arrangement. NHL staff members will be \nthe main operators of the meat-processing plant in partnership with Cooperl Arc \nAtlantique (Cooperl). NHL will import antibiotic-free meat from Cooperl France in the \ninitial years. NHL is building a hog farm in Zhangjiakou, which will raise hogs using the \nantibiotic-free farming method. The Zhangjiakou farm will eventually replace Cooperl \nas the supplier of slaughtered meat to the antibiotic-free processing line by 2022. \nAcclimatise AwareTM identified the risk level of climate change as medium. ADB\u2019s \nclimate financing amounts to $0.85 million (adaptation) and $0.78 million (mitigation).a \nPerformance  NHL will report annually on financial and operational KPIs for the group and the project, \nmonitoring  and on safeguard and development indicators (i.e., output and outcome targets).  \na Details of climate financing computation are provided in the Details of Implementation Arrangements linked document. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, KPI = Key performance indicator, NHL = New Hope Liuhe Co., Ltd., PRC = People\u2019s \nRepublic of China. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nF.  Projected Financial and Economic Performance  \n \n[Redacted] \n \nG.  Unique Features \n \n24  The  project  is  ADB\u2019s  first  assistance  to  an  integrated  agribusiness  conglomerate \npioneering an antibiotic-free concept in the livestock sector. The project has a unique combination \nof development themes: inclusive business,16 sustainable environmental management, climate \nchange mitigation, and gender mainstreaming.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance  \n \n25  ADB will provide NHL with a long-term corporate loan package of up to $100,000,000 \nequivalent in yuan, comprising (i) an A loan of up to $40,000,000 equivalent in yuan, and (ii) a \ncomplementary loan of up to $60,000,000 equivalent in yuan. A loan has a tenor of 7 years with \na grace period of 3 years. ADB is exploring the possibility of mobilizing parallel loans from \ndomestic commercial banks and international development finance institutions with an amount of \nup to $70,000,000 equivalent in yuan, as a potential substitute to up to $10,000,000 equivalent in \nyuan of the A loan and to all or part of the complementary loan.    \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n26.  ADB assistance will add value on three fronts: \n(i)  Gender mainstreaming. ADB will help NHL implement a gender action plan.   \n(ii)  Long-term capital. NHL relies primarily on internally generated cash and short \nand  medium-term  debt  to  finance  its  expansion.  ADB  will  provide  long-term \nfinancing which is not readily available from commercial banks.  \n \n16 About 50% of the proposed hog production from the two farms will be undertaken using the contract-farming model. \nMost of the employees and contract farmers are expected to be the \u201cbase of pyramid\u201d population.   \n ", "  7 \n \n(iii)  Safeguard  best  practices.  ADB  will  help  NHL  implement  an  improved \nenvironmental and social management plan following best international safeguard \npractices on biosecurity, waste management, and animal welfare; and monitor the \ncompany\u2019s progress during project implementation.  \n \nC.  Risks  \n \n[Redacted] \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n27  ADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009) as follows: environment (category B), involuntary resettlement (category C) and \nindigenous peoples (category C).  \n \n28  ADB has undertaken due diligence and reviewed the potential environmental and social \nimpacts of the project and the measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the \nadverse impacts in the safeguard reports and plans. The environmental and social measures and \nthe  institutional  capacity  and  commitment  of  NHL  to  manage  the  project\u2019s  social  and \nenvironmental impacts are deemed adequate. Potential risks and impacts during construction are \ngenerally site specific, and short term, and can be effectively managed by good engineering, \nconstruction, and housekeeping practices based on construction environmental management \nplans. No involuntary resettlement or indigenous people issues are envisaged for the project. All \nnew projects will either be constructed within existing premises and facilities or on adjoining land \nbelonging to industrial parks or zones.
