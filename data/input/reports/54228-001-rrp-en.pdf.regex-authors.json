THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach for the Strengthening Health Security Program, and (ii) a proposed \npolicy-based loan to Mongolia for subprogram 1 of the Strengthening Health Security Program. \n \n2.  The proposed program aims to strengthen the health sector\u2019s response to the coronavirus \ndisease (COVID-19) pandemic and expedite the medium-term reforms that will strengthen the \nhealth system and help Mongolia become better prepared to respond to future health crises. The \nprogram\u2019s design draws on the operational knowledge that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nhas gained through its engagement in the health sector in Mongolia since 1993. Through a \nstrategic, coordinated, and well-sequenced set of policy actions, the program will facilitate both \nimmediate and critical medium-term reforms. The provision of a $100 million loan will directly \ncontribute to address the urgent financing needs of the Government of Mongolia. Four reform \nareas identified under the program will focus on (i) strengthening planning and preparedness of \nthe health sector, and ensuring the availability of critical medicines and emergency supplies; \n(ii) improving national pharmaceutical regulation, and increasing hospital autonomy and good \ngovernance;  (iii) enhancing  procurement  in  the  health  sector  to  increase  efficiency,  and \nestablishing a single purchaser for health services; and (iv) safeguarding fiscal sustainability of \nthe government over the medium term (3\u20135 years). \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  Deep economic contraction because of COVID-19. The economy contracted by 5.3% \nin 2020 year-over-year (YoY) reflecting the severe impact of COVID-19 on the Mongolian \neconomy. The mining industry contracted by 9.4% in 2020 because of substantially lower export \ndemand.  This  spilled  over  to  other  sectors,  with  only  agriculture  and  manufacturing  not \ncontracting. On the demand side, private consumption, government consumption, and net exports \nall grew, but investment dragged growth down significantly by 19.1 percentage points. In 2020, \nthe current account deficit fell by 73.3% YoY to 4.4% of gross domestic product (GDP), though \nthe financial account surplus shrank by 48.1% YoY to 10.6% of GDP, resulting in a balance-of-\npayments surplus of $787 million. Revenues will fall by 16.8% for 2020, while expenditure will rise \nby 5.1%. Compared to the pre-COVID-19 plan, the overall fiscal balance will deteriorate to 9.9% \nof the GDP and the structural fiscal balance will deteriorate to 12.5% of the GDP. \n \n4.  Government  remains  committed  to  macroeconomic  reform.  According  to  the \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) assessment letter, Mongolia continues to face three key \nmacroeconomic  challenges:  (i)  high  public  debt,  (ii)  low  foreign  exchange  reserves,  and \n(iii) insufficient capital buffers in banks.1 On the fiscal side, the government reduced the debt-to-\nGDP ratio from 109.1% in 2016 to 79.1% in 2019. Fiscal pressures because of COVID-19 will \nincrease debt by 14.5 percentage points in 2020, but the downward trajectory of the debt-to-GDP \nratio will return with the resumption of growth in 2021. Further, under reform area 4 of the program \n(para. 21), the government has committed to reduce the structural deficit to 5.1% in 2021, in line \nwith the fiscal consolidation plans under the Fiscal Stability Law, 2010. Gross reserves increased \nfrom 2.8 months of goods and services imports at the end of 2016 to 5.8 months at the end of \n2019. According to the IMF, the level of reserves is sufficient to limit the risk of a capital account \ncrisis, but risks relating to upcoming debt repayments remain. The recapitalization of the banking \n \n1  IMF Assessment Letter (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "2 \nsector remains an outstanding issue and has been made worse by the COVID-19 pandemic. The \nappropriate measures taken by the Bank of Mongolia to respond to the pressures of the COVID-\n19 pandemic did limit the burden on firms and households, but it will be important to exit from \nthese measures carefully as the COVID-19 pandemic recedes, closely monitor capital adequacy \nin selected banks, ensure there is a transparent assessment of risks facing the banking sector, \nand act decisively if banks face liquidity pressures again. \n \n5.  Decisive response to COVID-19 pandemic initially prevented large-scale community \ntransmission. The government initiated stringent emergency measures to prevent the spread of \nthe COVID-19 pandemic in Mongolia. These measures included international and national travel \nrestrictions; the closure of nonessential businesses; public awareness campaigns focused on \ncontaining the spread of the virus; preparation of hospitals to manage emergencies in the event \nof a surge in infected patients; restrictions on public gatherings, meetings, and celebrations; and \nthe closure of schools. These actions delayed community spread, and Mongolia only recorded \nthe first case of locally transmitted COVID-19 on 11 November 2020. As of 28 February 2021, the \ntotal number of cases was 2,907, of which 414 were imported, with 4 deaths. Since 12 November \n2020, the country has initiated several national lockdowns as the government undertakes contact \ntracing, testing, and containment policies. The most recent lockdown ended on 23 February 2021. \nSince 23 February 2021, the government has begun the vaccine rollout, prioritizing health workers \nand the most at risk populations. Mongolia is securing vaccines from a combination of sources, \nincluding the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX).2 \n \n6.  Significant progress in improving health outcomes in recent years. The average life \nexpectancy at birth increased to 70 years in 2018, up from 69 in 2016.3 Mongolia achieved its \nMillennium Development Goal targets in 2015 for maternal and child mortality. The infant mortality \nrate decreased to 14 per 1,000 live births in 2018 from 16 per 1,000 live births in 2015, and the \nunder-5 mortality rate decreased to 16 per 1,000 live births in 2018 from 19 per 1,000 live births \nin 2015. Similarly, the maternal mortality ratio decreased to 45 per 100,000 live births in 2017 \nfrom 51 per 100,000 live births in 2013. \n \n7.  Community transmission is straining the health sector. The government estimates \nabout 60% of the population is at high risk of infection. A surge in infections would result in a \nshortage of quarantine facilities, necessary equipment, drugs, and other essential resources. A \n2017 World Health Organization evaluation concluded that Mongolia\u2019s core capacities relating to \npandemic preparedness are limited, suggesting Mongolia is ill prepared for a surge of COVID-19 \nor a similar pandemic.4 Mongolia\u2019s National Emergency Management Agency has a disaster \nmanagement plan, but this plan does not clearly define the roles and responsibilities of other \ninvolved  national  agencies.  The  evaluation  concluded  that  Mongolia  remains  vulnerable  to \nemerging diseases and public health emergencies, and challenges exist in the national system\u2019s \nreadiness to respond to large-scale and complex events in an effective and coordinated way. \nSystemic health sector constraints are also further amplified during health crises. Under reform \narea 1 (para. 18), several policy actions are introduced to strengthen Mongolia\u2019s immediate \n \n2  The Government of Mongolia has received vaccine donations from the Government of India and the Government of \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China. Mongolia joined COVAX facility in July 2020 and will receive vaccines in the first \nround of allocations. \n3  In 2016, female life expectancy was 73.5 years and male life expectancy was 65.3 years. By 2018, female life \nexpectancy was 73.9 and male life expectancy was 65.6 years. World Bank. World Bank Indicators (accessed 20 \nNovember 2020). \n4  World Health Organization. 2017.

A \nnumber of health sector inefficiencies persist that affect the quality of health services provided. \n \n8.  COVID-19  pandemic  accentuates  ineffective  and  inefficient  governance \narrangements around public hospitals that weaken treatment capacities. Rigid line-item \nbudgeting in public hospitals is an important source of inefficiency in the management and \nfinancing of hospitals. Input-based budgeting is poorly linked to the actual costs and volume of \nservices, and hospitals are unable to manage their human resources or reallocate funds between \ncost categories without first requesting approvals from the Ministry of Health (MOH) and Ministry \nof Finance (MOF). Savings at the end of the fiscal year (December) are automatically returned to \nMOF, discouraging hospital managers from pursuing efficiency gains.5 Such systemic issues limit \neffective and efficient hospital treatment as the COVID-19 pandemic continues. Reform area 2 \n(para.19) includes several policy actions that will strengthen existing governance arrangements \nin the health sector. Another area that leads to inefficient governance arrangements in the health \nsector is the absence of an effectively regulated pharmaceutical sector. \n \n9.  Expensive and poor quality medicines, and their inappropriate use, affect health \nsecurity. The prevalence of substandard (10.1%), unregistered (4.3%), and falsified (0.8%) \nmedicines in Mongolia is one of the highest in the world.6 Pharmaceutical regulation is also highly \nfragmented.  Functions  such  as  licensing  and  registration,  pricing,  quality  control,  market \nsurveillance and control, inspection and enforcement, implementation of an integrated regulatory \ninformation system, and enforcing rational drug use are implemented by different agencies \ninstead of one single drug regulatory authority, leading to poor coordination and increased \ninefficiencies. Pharmaceutical inefficiencies also lead to significant constraints as Mongolia rolls \nout its COVID-19 vaccination program. The procurement of medicines in public hospitals is also \ndecentralized, with each hospital being responsible for its own purchasing and drug budgets. This \nsystem increases unit costs of medicines in public hospitals and leads to quality and efficiency \nconstraints in the pharmaceutical sector, which affects health security. Procurement efficiency \ngains and better pharmaceutical regulation in the health sector need to be addressed through \nvarious policy reforms. \n \n10.  Health financing constraints amplified during pandemics. There are three main \nsources of health financing: (i) state budget, (ii) social health insurance, and (iii) out-of-pocket \nexpenditure (OPE). This multi-payer system creates inefficiencies and increases administrative \ncosts. In addition, although 90% of the population is covered by social health insurance, the \nbenefit  package  is  limited,  with  social  health  insurance  covering  mainly  inpatient  services. \nBecause of the gaps in service coverage, OPE accounts for 32% of total health costs, of which \none-third are for medicines, because of high prices and inappropriate use. This inadequate and \ninefficient financing system leads to higher health system costs and hinders Mongolia\u2019s ability to \nrespond to the COVID-19 pandemic. Several policy reforms are needed to significantly streamline \nfinancing arrangements in the health sector. \n \nB.  Policy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n11.  Government initiatives and recent reforms. The government developed the Action Plan \nfor Implementation of the State Policy on Health, 2020\u20132026 (health sector master plan) with the \n \n5  In Mongolia, the fiscal year coincides with the calendar year. \n6  ADB. 2015.

Manila (TA 8967-\nMON). \n ", "4 \nsupport of ADB in 2020.7 This plan defines immediate and medium-term policy objectives and \nstrategies for the health sector under eight policy directions and includes ambitious plans to \nstrengthen health security. The policy directions address (i) public health; (ii) medical services; \n(iii)  human  resources  development;  (iv)  health  care  financing;  (v)  health  technology; \n(vi) pharmaceuticals;  (vii)  information  and  communication  technology;  and  (viii)  sector \nmanagement, organizational arrangements, and transparency. The government is implementing \nthe health sector master plan through programs and policies on prevention and early detection of \nthe most common diseases, public health emergency preparedness and response, efficient \nregulation and rational use of medicines, medicine price regulation, establishment of an integrated \nhealth information management system, greater autonomy for public hospitals, and private health \nsector regulation. \n \n12.  ADB\u2019s value addition and lessons. ADB is one of Mongolia\u2019s long-standing and key \npartners in the health sector. Investments have supported the government in critical health system \nreforms to (i) shift priorities from hospital-based curative services to more efficient and cost-\neffective primary health care; (ii) improve health financing system to support universal health \ncoverage and increase financial protection of people; (iii) rationalize the hospital sector and \nprovide more autonomy for public hospitals to increase efficiency and quality of care; and \n(iv) improve patients\u2019 safety through optimization of health services and provision of medicines.8 \nWith  ADB\u2019s  policy  support,  the  government  has  developed  important  health  sector  policy \ndocuments and amended respective laws and regulations. The program will build on lessons and \nachievements from past ADB projects in the health sector, such as the need to strengthen primary \nhealth  care,  rationalize  hospital  services,  strengthen  policies  around  health  financing \nmechanisms, and improve social health insurance, all of which are closely aligned with the State \nPolicy on Health, 2017\u20132026 and the ADB-supported health sector master plan (footnote 7). \n \n13.  ADB\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. ADB\u2019s support to Mongolia regarding the \nCOVID-19 pandemic includes the following rapid response measures: reallocation of $1.4 million \nunder an existing health sector operation to support the procurement of emergency health \nequipment, a small-scale technical assistance (TA) project for emergency response systems, and \n$2.5 million in grant support from the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Facility (including $1.5 \nmillion from the Government of Japan) to support further procurement of emergency medical \nequipment. It also includes short- and medium-term responses, including a $30 million loan to \nsupport disease control in the health sector, a $26.4 million loan to strengthen social protection \nmeasures for vulnerable groups, and TA resources to strengthen the capacity of the domestic \nviolence response in the country. ADB also repurposed $24 million under ADB\u2019s support to the \nCredit Guarantee Fund to directly support small- and medium-sized enterprises in distress. In \naddition, $100 million was provided under ADB\u2019s Comprehensive Response to the COVID-19 \nPandemic to support the government to manage the economic impact and respond to the health \nand social protection needs the pandemic has created. To facilitate the purchase of screening \nequipment at selected border crossing points, $75,000 was reallocated from ADB\u2019s Regional \n \n7  ADB supported the Government of Mongolia with institutional and human resource capacity to develop the health \nsector\u2019s strategic priorities until 2027, in accordance with Mongolia\u2019s commitments to achieve health-related targets \nunder the Mongolia Sustainable Development Vision 2030.

Alignment with Strategy 2030. The program is aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy for Mongolia, 2017\u20132020 and ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 operational priority 1 (addressing \nremaining poverty and reducing inequalities), with the aim of enhancing human capital and \nachieving better health care for all.11 The program is also aligned with Strategy 2030 operational \npriorities 2 (accelerating progress in gender equality) and 6 (strengthening governance and \ninstitutional capacity), and is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan 2021 for \nMongolia.12 \n \n15.  Development partner coordination. A joint health sector task force led by the United \nNations (UN) and MOH is coordinating the COVID-19 emergency response actions. Task force \nmembers include ADB, European Commission, nongovernment organizations, specialized UN \nagencies, and the World Bank. This task force also has the mandate to coordinate international \nassistance to the health sector. So far, most assistance has been provided by ADB and various \nbilateral agencies, with the Government of Japan providing testing equipment and UN agencies \nfinancing the purchase of protective equipment for the National Emergency Management Agency. \nThe World Bank approved a loan to support the purchase of medical equipment.13 The program \ncomplements these efforts by focusing on immediate and medium-term governance and financing \nconstraints in the health sector, while at the same time responding to financing needs. \n \n16.  Impact on women. Despite the largely successful control of the spread of COVID-19, the \nonset of the pandemic has clearly highlighted Mongolia\u2019s limited capacity to immediately and \neffectively respond to outbreaks of infectious diseases. It has also demonstrated that women are \nfacing  greater  hardship  because  of  the  increased  burden  of  unpaid  care  work  and  their \npredominant role in health care (82% of health care workers are women). Moreover, the crisis \nhas exacerbated gender-based violence, as evidenced by the increase of hotline calls and women \nresorting to shelters. The reform measures under this program will address health system \ninefficiencies with an explicit focus on gender aspects. Finally, gender-responsive budgeting \n(GRB) at the decentralized hospital level will complement ongoing work in this area being \nundertaken by the World Bank and the Canadian International Development Agency. \n \n9  ADB.

The programmatic approach consists of two subprograms, each with a \nsingle tranche. There are seven policy actions in each subprogram to achieve four reform \nobjectives: (i) health sector preparedness and response to COVID-19 pandemic strengthened, \n(ii) governance of health sector operations improved, (iii) sustainability and efficiency of health \nsector resources improved, and (iv) medium-term fiscal stability enhanced. \n \n18.  Reform area 1: health sector preparedness and response to COVID-19 pandemic \nstrengthened. Reform area 1 focuses on strengthening planning capacity and preparedness of \nthe health sector, including the availability of critical medicines and emergency supplies. Policy \nactions under the subprograms are as follows: \n(i)  Subprogram 1. Under subprogram 1, the government developed an integrated \nincident management system that consolidates and coordinates across multiple \nsystems  and  organizational  structures  during  health  emergencies.  The \ngovernment also updated the National Disaster Response Plan (NDRP) for the \nhealth sector and prepared a gender-specific needs analysis of the NDRP for the \nCOVID-19 pandemic for the health sector.14 The government also approved a \nnational plan for the establishment of a fully functional centralized stockpile of \nmedicines and emergency supplies in the event of future health emergencies. \n(ii)  Subprogram 2. Under subprogram 2, the government will develop an inter-\nsectoral management information database that will facilitate data sharing during \ndisasters. This may include information such as (a) inter-sector data collection, (b) \nmapping of available resources, (c) stockpile data, and (d) capacity requirements. \nThe MOH will issue an implementation report on gender related activities carried \nout in connection with the NDRP. Under subprogram 2, the government will also \ndevelop and approve regulations to operationalize the stockpile. A fully functional \ncentralized  stockpile  will  require  regulations  and  protocols,  institutional \nassignments and responsibilities, and budgetary and staffing allocations. \n \n19.  Reform area 2: governance of health sector operations improved. Reform area 2 \naims to strengthen national pharmaceutical regulation and increase hospital autonomy and good \ngovernance. Policy actions under the subprograms are follows: \n(i)  Subprogram 1. Under subprogram 1, the government improved the governance \nand  efficiency  of  public  hospitals  and  the  pharmaceutical  sector.  Under  this \nsubprogram, the government ratified an amendment to the Medicines and Medical \nDevices Law, 2010 that enabled the establishment of a single pharmaceutical \nauthority. The government has also piloted increased managerial and financial \nautonomy in three public hospitals, including the introduction of performance-\nbased contracting of services. The pilot included the development of training \nmodules on gender analysis and GRB for the hospital management and finance \nstaff to help promote gender inclusive health care services in public hospitals. \n(ii)  Subprogram 2. Subprogram 2 will establish a single national pharmaceutical \nregulatory authority, allocate sufficient budget, and approve the charter for this new \nauthority. It will also extend the hospital autonomy pilot to at least five additional \nhospitals. Capacity building sessions on the training modules for gender analysis \nand GRB developed under subprogram 1 will be held in at least five public \n \n14 This may also include disaggregated data by sex, geographic location, and age. \n ", "7 \nhospitals. The program will also provide implementation support to hospitals on \nGRB and prepare a report that will document progress. \n \n20.  Reform area 3: sustainability and efficiency of health sector resources improved. \nReform area 3 aims to enhance procurement in the health sector to increase efficiency and \nestablish a single purchaser for health services. Policy actions under the subprograms are as \nfollows: \n(i)  Subprogram  1.  Under  subprogram  1,  the  government  established  a  pooled \nprocurement arrangement, which reduced the cost of drugs and generated savings \nthrough bulk purchases. To improve health system efficiency, the government \nexpanded an existing pilot on the pooled procurement of essential medicines and \nmedical devices by increasing the number of items procured under the framework \nagreement from 17 to 35. To help ensure the sustainability of the health system, \nthe Parliament of Mongolia amended the key legislation to enable the Health \nInsurance Fund (HIF) to become a single purchaser of health services. To guide \nthe phased transfer of funds to the HIF, a gender- and age-differential baseline \nanalysis of health care service recipients was conducted. \n(ii)  Subprogram 2. Under subprogram 2, the government will further expand the \npooled  procurement  of  essential  medicines  and  include  10%  of  budgeted \nmedicines under the prequalification framework agreement. The government has \nalso committed to the phased transfer of funds from the state budget to the HIF. In \ndoing so, the government shall integrate the results of gender- and age-differential \nanalysis of health care service recipients in the planning and budgeting related to \nthe phased transfer of funds. \n \n21.  Reform area 4: medium-term fiscal stability enhanced. Under reform area 4, the \ngovernment has committed to safeguard fiscal sustainability over the medium term. Policy actions \nunder the subprograms are as follows: \n(i)  Subprogram 1. The government has approved a structural deficit of 5.1% in 2021, \nwhich returns Mongolia to a fiscally sustainable trajectory. This means Mongolia \nhas returned to its pre-COVID-19 fiscal trajectory with only a 1-year time lapse. \n(ii)  Subprogram 2. Under subprogram 2, the government will further decrease the \nstructural deficit to 3.6% in 2022. This will be complemented by revisions to the \n\u201cRegulation  for  Planning,  Financing,  Monitoring,  and  Reporting  for  Public \nInvestment Projects and Activities,\u201d and an upgrade of the public investment \nmanagement information system. Both measures will cut the excessive red tape \nand realize significant efficiency gains in the execution of the capital budget. \n \nC.  Impacts of the Reform \n \n22.  The main development objective of the policy reform is to improve health outcomes in \nMongolia through improvements in the quality and delivery of health services.15 The policy actions \nunder subprogram 1 contributed to the overall objective to strengthen the government\u2019s immediate \ncapacity to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. Subprogram 2 will introduce medium-term reforms \nthat will strengthen key health systems as well as governance and financing arrangements. In \naddition,  Mongolia\u2019s  COVID-19  vaccine  deployment  plan  includes  ensuring  high  regulatory \nstandards for vaccine quality and comprehensive policies to support adequate governance and \npharmacovigilance mechanisms, both of which are areas that will be strengthened through \npharmaceutical regulation under reform area 2. The implementation of reform area 2 is closely \n \n15 Government of Mongolia. 2016. State Policy on Health, 2017\u20132026. Ulaanbaatar. \n ", "8 \nlinked with the proposed ADB APVAX support to procure COVID-19 vaccines and Mongolia\u2019s \nmedium- and long-term vaccine rollout efforts. The main economic impact of the program is \nimproved health security mitigating the adverse effects of COVID-19, avoiding future economic and \nsocial losses. A more sustainable, better coordinated, and more efficient health system will improve \naccess, targeting, and gender considerations in health. Poor and vulnerable communities will \nbenefit, and poverty will be alleviated. Improved health outcomes and a more resilient population \nwill also induce greater private investment in the health sector and health insurance.16 \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n23.  According to the Fiscal Stability Law, 2010 the government must finance the structural \ndeficit, which was 12.5% in 2020, resulting in financing needs of $1,701 million. The government \nwill fund this through domestic financing ($412 million), external borrowing ($1,077 million), and \nother financing ($211 million), including withdrawal from the Stabilization Fund. The government \nobtained $263 million in project financing and $815 million in policy-based financing to meet \nexternal financing needs. In 2021, revenues are expected to increase by 22.4% and expenditures \nexpected to fall by 4.3%, leaving a financing need of 5.1% of the GDP. Subprogram 1 will make \nup 13.2% of the 2021 total financing gap. This will allow the government to maintain a stable level \nof domestic financing while gradually reducing the overall amount of external borrowing received \nin 2020, which was provided by ADB, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the European \nUnion, the Government of Japan, the IMF, and the World Bank.

The government has requested a regular loan of $100 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance subprogram 1. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace \n \n16 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "9 \nperiod of 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on the straight-line \nmethod, the average maturity is 10.9 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. \nSubprogram 2, with an indicative amount of $100 million, will also come from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n25.  The MOF will serve as the executing agency and will establish a working group to oversee \nand coordinate the implementation of the program. The MOH will be the implementing agency. \nADB will assess implementation based on progress reports submitted by the MOF and will field \nmissions  to  confirm  the  fulfillment  of  policy  actions  for  subprograms  1  and  2.  ADB  and \ndevelopment partners will coordinate to prevent duplication of activities during implementation. \n \n26.  Subprogram  1  will  be  disbursed  upon  loan  effectiveness  and  is  linked  to  the  full \ncompliance of the prior actions, as set out in the policy matrix (Appendix 4). The programmatic \napproach will be implemented over a period of 25 months. Subprogram 1 will be implemented \nfrom 1 May 2020 to 14 May 2021 and subprogram 2 will be implemented from 15 May 2021 to \n30 June 2022.17 The proceeds of the policy-based loan will be withdrawn in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n27.  Economic. Avoidable costs of a future pandemic similar to the COVID-19 pandemic range \nfrom $16.0 million to $196.7 million annually. The expected value of economic benefits of better \npreparedness and prevention would be at least $16.0 million per year, well above the estimated \ninvestment of $5.6 million needed per year for prevention and control. Further, potential efficiency \nsavings of $16.7 million per year will fully offset this needed investment. \n \n28.  Safeguards.  No  adverse  environmental,  indigenous  peoples,  and  involuntary \nresettlement impacts under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) have been identified. The \nprogram will not have any differentiated impacts on ethnic groups, as none of the reforms will \ntarget specific ethnic groups. The program is categorized C for environment, indigenous peoples, \nand involuntary resettlement. \n \n29.  Social, poverty, and gender. Despite solid economic growth from 2017\u20132019, impacts \non poverty reduction have not kept pace and 28.4% of the population remain below the poverty \nline ($66.4 per month). Children remain among the most vulnerable (42.0% of poor people are \nchildren under the age of 15). Poverty concentration is growing in urban areas, with reductions in \nrural areas attributable to increased demand for livestock and price increases. The 14.9% of \npeople living just above the poverty line are highly vulnerable to shocks. The program will address \naffordability of medicines, which is a leading cause of OPE, especially for the poor. It will also \naddress  the  poor  quality  of  medicines,  since  32%  of  OPE  goes  to  drugs  that  are  often \nsubstandard.18 In addition, the program will increase the financial and managerial independence \nof public hospitals, which will improve the quality of services provided and patient satisfaction.19 \n \n17 List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 World Bank.

The program will initiate the preparation of a gender-specific analysis of the NDRP for \nthe health sector. The findings of this report will be adopted by the MOH and will shape disaster \nplanning in the health sector in the future. \n \n31.  The program will ensure that some of the most significant reforms in the health sector\u2014\nthe decentralization of budget and managerial authority to hospitals, and the reform of health \nservice financing\u2014will have gender considerations at their core. The introduction of GRB at the \nhospital level offers an opportunity to broaden GRB across the public sector. This program will \nresult in the development of a training module on GRB, which will be used in hospitals that will \nget  increased  budget  authority.  This  offers  a  unique  opportunity  to  operationalize  GRB  in \nMongolia, and subprogram 2 will train hospital staff on GRB and monitor its implementation. \n \n32.  Governance.  Mongolia  has  strong  financial  management  legislation,  governance \nstructures, and public financial management systems, including a treasury single account, a \nunified  chart  of  accounts,  and  an  integrated  government  debt  and  financial  management \ninformation system. There remain areas for improvement related to efficiency, effectiveness, and \ntransparency of public financial management.20 To address these, the MOF adopted a reform \nstrategy, supported by ADB, the European Union, the IMF, and the World Bank.21 Over the \nmedium term, ADB will continue to stay engaged.22 The revised Public Procurement Law, \nadopted in 2013, introduced significant changes in the public procurement system, with local \ngovernments given more responsibility for procurement. The revised law includes provisions to \nmake  procurement  processes  more  transparent  and  participative.  Implementation  of  these \nambitious reforms is ongoing. The Public Procurement Law was amended in 2019 with the aim \nto strengthen transparency and accountability. ADB supported the preparation of the amended \nlaw through TA support.23 Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 2 and \ndescribed in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.24 \n \nTable 2: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nPublic financial management \nHigh level of budget proposals based on  ADB is assisting the government to strengthen its budget \noverestimated revenue forecasts leads to  planning, execution, and monitoring as well as the sound \ndeterioration of budget credibility.  forecasting of revenue sources.a \nLow capital\u2013output ratios because of  ADB will address this in a proposed public finance-focused \ninefficiencies in public expenditure  technical assistance project, with a dedicated component to \nmanagement.  support improvements in expenditure management.b \nProcurement \nLimited use of the GPA and fragmentation of  ADB provides technical assistance to central procurement \nprocurement functions across administration  entities such as the GPA and to local procurement units, uses \nmay lead to misprocurement and distract  these entities for procurement under ADB-funded projects to the \n \n20 World Bank. 2018.
