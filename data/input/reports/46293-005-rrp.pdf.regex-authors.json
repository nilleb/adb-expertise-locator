THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)  Tourism \nInfrastructure  for  Inclusive  Growth  Project.1 Two  complementary  projects  are  proposed  for \nCambodia and the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic.2 \n \n2.  The project will remove physical and capacity constraints impeding tourism development \nin Dien Bien, Ha Tinh, Kien Giang, Lao Cai, and Tay Ninh,  five provinces situated within GMS \ncorridors.  It  will  contribute  to  the  creation  of  85,000  tourism-related  jobs  in  Viet  Nam  by  \n(i) paving 45 kilometers of rural roads to open new areas for private tourism investment, and \nimprove  access  to  markets  and  social  services  for  about  30,000  residents;  (ii)  improving \nenvironmental services in areas important for cross-border tourism to reduce public health \nhazards  for  21,000  residents  and  8.8  million  annual  visitors  beginning  in  2019;  and  \n(iii) facilitating business support services and access to microfinance for at least 560 micro-, \nsmall, and medium-sized enterprises.3 The project will strengthen regional cooperation and \nintegration by implementing harmonized regional tourism standards, promoting multicountry tour \ncircuits, and supporting structured policy dialogue to reduce nonphysical barriers to travel. The \nproject investment plan is in line with the GMS Tourism Sector Strategy4 and the government\u2019s \nStrategy for Tourism Development in Viet Nam until 2020, Vision to 2030.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Regional context. Among country groupings in Asia and the Pacific, the GMS has a \nstrong comparative advantage in tourism as a result of its diverse cultural and natural assets, \ngood  international  air  and  land  transport  connections  between  gateway  destinations,  and \nsurging demand for intraregional leisure travel. International tourist arrivals are growing by \n12.4% per year; in 2012 arrivals reached an all-time high of 44.8 million, generating $44.3 billion \nin receipts. Tourism supports 7 million jobs and creates positive economic impacts in other \nservice  and  productive  sectors.  About  one-third  of  international  arrivals  visit  at  least  two \ncountries while travelling in the GMS, and millions of residents cross borders each year for day \ntrips. GMS countries are eager to strengthen subregional tourism cooperation and recently \nreaffirmed  their  commitment  to  promote  cross-border  tourism  under  the  GMS  Economic \nCooperation  Program  Strategic  Framework,  2012\u20132022.5 Nevertheless,  underinvestment  in \npublic infrastructure beyond the major gateways remains a critical constraint to expanding \nprivate tourism enterprises and dispersing benefits to less-developed areas.6 \n \n4.  National priorities. Viet Nam received 6.84 million international tourists in 2012, a 14% \nincrease from 2011 and about 15% of total GMS arrivals. Tourism directly contributes 4.5% to \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance.

Indicators for inclusive growth are derived from this document.  \n4  Asian  Development  Bank.  2005.  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Tourism  Sector  Strategy,  2005\u20132015.  Manila. \nImplementation of the strategy is estimated to cost $430 million, of which 83% is allocated for infrastructure.  \n5  Asian Development Bank. 2011. Greater Mekong Subregion Economic Cooperation Program Strategic Framework, \n2012\u20132022.

", "2 \ngross  domestic  product  and  sustains  2.3  million  jobs  or  9.4%  of  total  employment.7 The \ngovernment\u2019s strategy and vision for tourism development is consistent with the GMS Tourism \nSector  Strategy,  emphasizing  tourism  infrastructure  and  facility  upgrades,  human  resource \ndevelopment,  marketing  and  promotion,  and  policy  enhancement  to  improve  the  business \nenabling environment for tourism. Strategic objectives are to (i) develop tourism into a leading \neconomic  sector;  (ii)  improve  tourism  quality  and  competitiveness;  (iii)  attract  more  high-\nspending international visitors; (iv) promote domestic tourism; and (v) protect cultural, historic, \nand  natural  resources.  The  national  strategy  forecasts  10.5  million  international  arrivals,  \n48 million domestic tourists, and tourism receipts equivalent to $19 billion in 2020.  \n \n5.  Key  issues.  Despite  a  rich  inventory  of  cultural  and  natural  features  with  good \ndevelopment potential, most tourism activity is concentrated in Da Nang, Ha Long, Hanoi, Ho \nChi Minh City, or Hue\u2013Hoi An, which account for over one-third of hospitality investment.8 While \nwomen comprise about 60% of tourism workers, many are employed in lower-skilled jobs \npaying lower wages, and are underrepresented in tourism management. At least 30% of tourism \nreceipts leave the country as tourism-related imports because of weak market linkages between \nthe tourism supply chain and other economic sectors. The key impediments to more inclusive \nand  geographically  dispersed  growth  are  insufficient  last-mile  transport  infrastructure  in \nsecondary destinations, limited institutional capacity to promote local tourism-related enterprise \ndevelopment, and ineffective marketing. A few areas such as Ba Den Mountain in Tay Ninh \nprovince have had a surge in visitors following improvements to the GMS transport corridors, \nhowever sanitary conditions are quickly being degraded due to inadequate management of solid \nwaste and wastewater. Together with low service standards, this situation suppresses tourist \nlength of stay, reduces spending, and threatens future prospects for sustainable growth.  \n \n6.  To  remove  these  constraints  and  engender  a  more  equitable  pattern  of  tourism \ndevelopment, the project will upgrade access roads that link rural tourist attractions with urban \ncenters, improve environmental infrastructure and services in areas important for tourism, and \nsupport capacity building for local entrepreneurs and destination management organizations.9 \nProject investments are designed to catalyze private investment in tourism superstructure and \nservices, boost tourist spending and job creation in underdeveloped areas, and ensure that \ntourism growth is environmentally and socially sustainable.10 \n \n7.  Related  policies  and  strategies.  The  project  is  aligned  with  Viet  Nam\u2019s  Socio-\nEconomic  Development  Strategy,  2011\u20132020,  which  aims  to  transform  the  country  into  a \nmodern industrialized nation by (i) improving socialist-oriented market economy institutions,  \n(ii)  developing  human  resources,  and  (iii)  improving  transportation  networks  and  urban \ninfrastructure. Promotion of cultural heritage and tourism features prominently. The focus on \ncreating jobs for women and ethnic minorities living in underdeveloped areas; improving urban\u2013\nrural connectivity; expanding the quality and coverage of environmental services; and building \ncapacity to sustainably manage tourism overlap with the three pillars of the country partnership \nstrategy  of  the  Asian Development  Bank (ADB) for  Viet  Nam:  inclusive  growth,  enhanced \neconomic efficiency, and environmental sustainability.11 The project reinforces regional efforts to \nincrease cross-border tourism and investment flows, develop the GMS corridors into economic \ncorridors, and promote the Mekong as a single tourist destination. \n                                                \n7  World Travel and Tourism Council. 2013.

Senior GMS tourism officials and ADB co-chair the semiannual working \ngroup meetings, which guide GMS Tourism Sector Strategy implementation and identify policy \nissues for discussion at the annual GMS tourism ministers meeting and triennial GMS summit. \nIn Viet Nam, the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism (MCST) coordinates tourism sector \nassistance.  Other  development  partners  engaged  in  tourism  are  the  European  Union,  the \nGerman  development  cooperation  through  Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Internationale \nZusammenarbeit,  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  Lux-Development,  and  the \nGovernment of New Zealand.12  \n \n9.  Lessons.  ADB\u2019s  GMS  tourism  sector  assistance  program  and  completed  tourism \nprojects in Viet Nam are rated successful.13 Project lessons include the need to (i) analyze \ntourism demand in project areas to guide selection of infrastructure investments, (ii) improve \ncross-sector coordination and build synergies with other ADB assistance, (iii) provide capacity \nbuilding for project management and operation and maintenance (O&M), and (iv) promote \ntourism-related  private  enterprise  development  alongside  infrastructure  to  expand  income-\ngenerating opportunities for local residents. The project\u2019s infrastructure subprojects are based \non robust market analysis and complementarities with ADB assistance for urban development, \nwater  supply  and  sanitation,  and  tourism.  Capacity  building  for  entities  responsible  for \ninfrastructure O&M, and parallel support for small enterprises led by women and ethnic groups \nwill enhance sustainability of project outputs and ensure benefits reach vulnerable groups. The \ninterventions will connect lower-income groups to basic services and markets, and enable them \nto access tourism employment, education, health care, and other opportunities. \n \n10.  Special features. The project will (i) strengthen collaboration between government, the \nprivate sector, civil society, and local communities to improve tourism destination management, \n(ii) demonstrate how tourist entry fees and charges can help finance the maintenance of public \ngoods such as heritage sites, roads, and environmental services, (iii) strengthen knowledge \npartnerships  among  GMS  and  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  members,  and  \n(iv) leverage service sector opportunities to accelerate widening of GMS corridors into economic \ncorridors by linking secondary tourism destinations with increasingly affluent regional markets. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact of the project will be increased tourism employment for people living in \nunderdeveloped  segments  of  GMS  corridors  in  Viet  Nam.  The  outcome  will  be  increased \ntourism receipts in Dien Bien, Ha Tinh, Kien Giang, Lao Cai, and Tay Ninh. By 2019, aggregate \nannual tourism receipts in the project provinces will increase to $480 million, helping to stimulate \nthe creation of 85,000 additional tourism-related jobs by 2025. Based on current workforce \nparticipation rates, it is expected that 60% of these jobs will be held by women. \n \nC.  Outputs \n12.  The outputs are (i) last-mile tourism access infrastructure improved, (ii) environmental \nservices in cross-border tourism centers improved, (iii) institutional capacity to promote inclusive \ntourism  growth  strengthened,  and  (iv)  effective  project  implementation  and  management. \nCriteria guiding subproject selection include (i) infrastructure constraints; (ii) location in a GMS \ncorridor with good tourism and economic development potential; (iii) location in a multicountry \n                                                \n12  Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n13  ADB. 2009.

Manila. \n ", "7 \nWorking Group will join steering committee meetings to harmonize other tourism assistance. \nMCST  will  be  the  executing  agency  and  the  departments  of  culture,  sports,  and  tourism \n(DCSTs)  will  be  the  implementing  agencies.  Overall  project  coordination  and  regional \ncooperation activities will be led by a project coordination unit (PCU) embedded in MCST\u2019s \nPlanning and Finance Department. The PCU will report to the MCST deputy minister, who will \nbe the permanent chairperson of the national steering committee and represent Viet Nam on the \nsubregional steering committee. DCSTs in each participating province will establish a project \nimplementation unit (PIU) staffed with multidisciplinary teams to oversee day-to-day project \nimplementation.  The  PIUs  will  report  to  the  deputy  chairperson  of  the  provincial  people\u2019s \ncommittees and the PCU, which will consolidate quarterly progress reports for submission to the \nnational steering committee and ADB. The PIUs and the PCU will share consultant resources \nand attend steering committee meetings to ensure all project activities are well-coordinated.  \n \n20.  The  project  will  work  directly  with  community-based  organizations  and  business \nassociations, which will appoint local focal points to ensure good coordination between the PIUs \nand project beneficiaries. If no community-based organizations or business associations exist in \nproject areas, the PIUs will extend assistance to form them. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n21.  The project will (i) upgrade rural roads to ease access to tourist attractions; (ii) construct \nfacilities  to  treat  wastewater  and  temporarily  store  solid  waste;  and  (iii)  construct  public \namenities such as tourist information centers and markets to create favorable conditions for \nenterprise  development  by  local  residents,  particularly  women  and  ethnic  minorities. \nEngineering solutions are technically feasible and consider cost, durability, affordability, and \nclimate resilience. All civil works designs are compatible with standard parameters and the O&M \ncapacity of local authorities. Contract packaging will attract suitably qualified contractors and \nensure  efficient  procurement.  Capacity-building  programs  will  help  small  entrepreneurs  to \nbecome more competitive and improve the business enabling environment. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n22.  The  economic  analysis  for  all  infrastructure  subprojects  followed  ADB  guidelines.18 \nBenefits quantified are increased tourism receipts arising from an increase in tourists visiting \nproject-supported destinations and staying 0.4\u20130.8 days longer, and vehicle operating cost \nsavings from reductions in road roughness. Economic benefits identified but not quantified are \nincreased land values for property owners, increased agricultural production and income for \nfarmers  living  along  the  improved  rural  roads,  and  health  benefits  arising  from  better \nenvironmental services. The base-case results indicate all subprojects are economically viable \nwith an estimated economic internal rate of return exceeding the assumed economic opportunity \ncost of capital of 12%. Returns range from 15.3% for the Ta Phin\u2013Ban Khoang access road to \n49.4% for the Dien Bien Phu Cultural Exchange and Tourist Information Center. The findings \nare consistent with the performance of other ADB-financed public tourism infrastructure in Viet \nNam; when similar assumptions were applied, the infrastructure generated internal rates of \nreturn of 28.4% to 82.2%.19 All subprojects remain viable under all adverse scenarios tested.20  \n                                                \n18  Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n19  ADB. 2011.

Manila. \n20  1-year implementation delay or costs are 10% higher or benefits 10% lower than the base case. \n ", "8 \n23.  The  financial  analysis  followed  ADB  guidelines.21 Road  subprojects  are  considered \nnonrevenue generating. The financial sustainability analysis of the provincial departments of \ntransportation (DOTs) responsible for O&M is based on historical income and  expenditure \nstatements. It found that Kien Giang DOT will have sufficient budget and revenue to cover \nincremental O&M of the access roads at Da Dung Cave and Phu Tu Tourism Zone, but Dien \nBien and Lao Cai DOTs will require additional funds for periodic maintenance of the Muang \nPhang and Ta Phin\u2013Ban Khoang access roads. The government, through an assurance in the \nloan agreement, has committed to provide the DOTs with sufficient funds for this purpose. The \nanalysis for other project-developed infrastructure under the responsibility of the DCSTs found \nthat tourist user fees will generate sufficient revenue to cover O&M costs of all facilities.22 \n \nC.  Governance \n24.  The assessment of the executing and implementing agencies\u2019 capacity for financial \nmanagement envisaged under the project, including the use of statement of expenditure and \nimprest  fund  procedures,  suggests  the  implementation  arrangements  and  internal  control \nsystems are suitable. Measures to mitigate risks identified, such as the potential for corruption \nfrom weak procurement oversight and low financial management capacity of PIUs, will be \naddressed  by  applying  standard  ADB  bidding  documents  and  providing  intensive  start-up \ntraining in ADB procurement, financial management, and disbursement procedures. Consultants \nwith financial management expertise will be embedded in the PCU and PIUs to provide on-the-\njob training and prepare a project-specific financial management manual. Compliance with ADB \nfinancial reporting and external audit requirements will be monitored by review missions and \nnormal  project  supervision.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \nexplained to and discussed with the government and MCST. The specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual.  \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n25.  The project will benefit about 490,000 residents (50% women and girls) in the five \nparticipating provinces. Poverty rates in project areas range from 6% in Tay Ninh to 33% in Lao \nCai and Dien Bien due to limited assets, low productivity, and poor access to markets and social \nservices.  Project  investments to  improve  access  infrastructure  and  environmental  services, \nstrengthen tourism destination management, and provide micro- and small enterprises with \nbusiness support services are designed to overcome these constraints and expand economic \nopportunities to benefit poor and lower-income households. The project is categorized effective \ngender mainstreaming. It will improve women\u2019s access to economic opportunities and strategic \ndecision making. The gender action plan specifies women will hold 60% of tourism-related jobs \ncreated  by  the  project  and  comprise  60%  of  training  participants,  50%  of  participants  in \ncommunity consultations, 40% of leadership positions in destination management organizations, \nand 30% of project management and technical staff.23 The project will reduce the vulnerability of \nwomen  and  children  to  HIV/AIDS  transmission,  human  trafficking,  and  other  forms  of \nexploitation by conducting awareness programs and promoting collaboration between private \nenterprises, nongovernment organizations, and law enforcement agencies.24  \n \n                                                \n21  Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n22  Institutional Analysis and Arrangements for O&M of Project Facilities (accessible from the list of linked documents \nin Appendix 2). \n23  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n24  The project will collaborate with the Child Safe Tourism Campaign (active in Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and Viet \nNam) in cooperation with World Vision, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, and Interpol. \n ", "9 \nE.  Safeguards \n26.  All safeguards documents were prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguards Policy \nStatement  (2009)  and  are  posted  on  the  ADB  website  in  compliance  with  disclosure \nrequirements.25 The safeguards categorization for environment, involuntary resettlement, and \nindigenous  peoples  is  B.  Initial  consultations  with  male  and  female  residents,  government \nofficials, and civil society confirm broad support for the project.  Consultation with these groups \nwill continue throughout the project cycle, following the consultation and participation plan and \nstakeholder communications strategy.26 The project includes resources to help counterparts \neffectively  implement  social  and  environmental  safeguards.  Monitoring  requirements  and \nappropriate grievance redress mechanisms are in the safeguards documents. \n \n27.  An initial environmental examination was prepared in the context of the project\u2019s area of \ninfluence and based on current information.27 The potential environmental impacts are not \nirreversible,  diverse,  or  unprecedented.  Expected  impacts  and  risks  are  site-specific  and \nappropriate  mitigating  measures  are  incorporated  into  subproject-specific  environmental \nmanagement plans. Works in sensitive environments and near physical cultural resources such \nas pagodas and caves were designed in consultation with the DCSTs and in accordance with \ninternational  good  practice  and  national  laws  and  regulations.  The  initial  environmental \nexamination (IEE) and environmental management plans (EMPs) will be updated and finalized \nat the detailed design stage with the involvement of tourism planners, heritage management \nexperts, and environment specialists. Updated versions of the documents will be cleared by the \ngovernment and ADB, posted to the ADB website, and form part of bidding documents. The \nfinal IEE and EMPs will guide construction supervision and the preparation of site management \nplans with environmentally sensitive O&M guidelines. \n \n28.  Land acquisition and resettlement impacts involve 7 severely affected households with \n34 affected persons, minor land acquisition from 247 households with 1,219 affected persons, \ntemporary disruption of 118 businesses with 583 affected persons, and 18 households with \noutstanding claims for compensation payments for loss of land and other assets at Phu Tu \ntourism zone in Kieng Giang province. Resettlement plans were prepared for each subproject, \ncommensurate with the extent and degree of the expected impacts.28 Corrective actions are \nincluded  in  the  resettlement  plan  for  Kieng  Giang.  Initial  costs  of  land  acquisition  and \ncompensation  are  estimated  at  $1.07  million,  and  are  considered  adequate  based  on  the \ncensus  and  inventory  of  losses  prepared  in  consultation  with  affected  persons.  Project \ninformation  was  disclosed  to  all  affected  persons;  a  cutoff  date  for  their  inclusion  in  the \nresettlement plans was established during resettlement consultations. The project information \nbooklet will be updated and disseminated during the detailed measurement survey.  \n \n29.  An ethnic minority development plan was prepared in consultation with Dao, Hmong, \nKhmer, and Thai ethnic minorities in the project areas. 29 The project will benefit these groups by \n(i) formalizing community management of tourist attractions in ancestral territories, (ii) promoting \ncultural industries to create income-generating opportunities, and (iii) improving physical access \nto markets and social services. The plan specifies that ethnic minorities will be represented in \ntourism destination management organizations and includes measures to protect intangible \n                                                \n25  ADB. 2011.
