THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \n(i) policy-based loan (PBL) and (ii) project loan to Georgia for the Sustainable Water Supply and \nSanitation Sector Development Program. The report also describes the proposed administration \nof technical assistance (TA)\u2014Supporting High-Level Technology for Asset Management\u2014to be \nprovided by the High-Level Technology Fund1 and, if the Board approves the proposed loans, I, \nacting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the TA. \n \n2.  The proposed program supports the government\u2019s pursuit of sustainable water supply and \nsanitation (WSS) services and an efficient state-owned enterprise (SOE). The policy actions \nunder the stand-alone multitranche PBL will transform WSS governance and institutions to \nimprove performance and financial sustainability, while ensuring funding for basic services during \na period of fiscal constraints brought on by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The \nproject will (i) strengthen the operation and maintenance (O&M) capacity of United Water Supply \nCompany of Georgia (UWSCG),2 (ii) prepare strategic investment plans for national-scale rural \nWSS development, and (iii) increase public awareness of infection prevention measures in the \ncontext of COVID-19 through a gender-sensitive health, hygiene, and sanitation program. The \nproject will also improve the water supply system in Telavi city, a regional center and employment \ngeneration hub, to enable 24-hour water supply.3 The TA will introduce high-level technology into \nasset management systems to enhance O&M in select cities. \n \nII.  THE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  Macroeconomic context and COVID-19 impacts. Georgia enjoyed a 4.7% average \nannual rate of gross domestic product (GDP) growth and kept its annual fiscal deficit equal to \nabout 1.0% of GDP in 2011\u20132019.4 It halved its poverty rate from 38.8% in 2007 to 20.1% in 2018. \nUnemployment declined from 17.3% in 2011 to 11.6% in 2019. Public debt to GDP stood at 44.5% \nin 2019. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) assessed public debt as remaining sustainable \nin the medium term.5 The inflation forecast for 2020 is adjusted upward to 5% above the central \nbank target of 3% as the lari depreciated rapidly. The government plans for a gradual fiscal \nconsolidation starting in 2021. The National Bank of Georgia will continue to exercise caution in \nits policy stance to balance the impact of the lari depreciation. GDP growth is estimated to drop \nto -5% in 2020 because of the COVID-19-induced economic slowdown.6 Timely budget support \nis critical for (i) imminent fiscal relief and COVID-19 management,7 (ii) structural reforms against \nfiscal risks arising from SOEs, and (iii) substantial development financing needs from the COVID-\n19 impact.8 COVID-19 is expected to reduce UWSCG revenues from commercial customers\u2014an \nessential revenue stream\u2014by up to 30% in 2020. \n \n1  Financing partner: Government of Japan. Administered by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n2  UWSCG is a limited liability company established in January 2010, and the state owns 100% of the shares. \n3  Telavi is the 13th largest city with a population of 20,000. It is 158 kilometers east of the capital, Tbilisi. Adequate \nwater supply is critical for Telavi\u2019s wine and agricultural production, and for tourism. \n4  IMF.

Asian Development Outlook Supplement: Lockdown, Loosening, and Asia\u2019s Growth Prospects. Manila. \n7  ADB. 2020. Georgia: COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support Program. Manila. At least 1.2 million \nfamilies will benefit from subsidized utility bills for water, electricity, and waste management for at least 3 months. \n8  Georgia\u2019s development financing needs is estimated at $1.53 billion in 2020. The government has more than 200 \nongoing WSS works contracts that risk either cancellation or termination. \n ", "2 \n4.  Inadequate provision of water supply and sanitation services. Access to essential \nWSS services varies across the country, and disparities between urban and rural areas are \nincreasing.9 About 92% of urban residents and 64% of rural residents receive piped water, while \n84% of urban and 20% of rural residents have access to sewerage systems. Only 36% of the total \npopulation benefit from wastewater treatment. Water supply is not continuous, ranging nationwide \nfrom 4 hours per day to 24 hours per day, which poses a significant health risk during the COVID-\n19 pandemic. Telavi households, for example, suffer from intermittent water supply of 4 hours per \nday (footnote 3). The quality of service suffers from operational inefficiencies, as evident in a high \nrate of nonrevenue water (NRW), estimated at 66%, and in just 47% of households being metered. \n \n5.  Outdated sector policy and regulations. Georgia lacks a consolidated vision and policy \nto guide urban and rural WSS planning and development. Multiple regulations and strategies \nexist, but without a coherent and integrated approach. The 1997 Water Law, currently in force, \ndoes not align with European Union (EU) legislation for integrated water resources and river basin \nmanagement.10 The 1997 Energy and Gas Law and related regulations apply primarily to the \nenergy sector and lack a focus on WSS. \n \n6.  Inadequate institutional arrangements. Sector planning, development, and monitoring \nare not coordinated, involve multiple stakeholders, and largely exclude the participation of local \ngovernments. The Ministry of Regional Development and Infrastructure (MRDI) is responsible for \nWSS policy formulation, infrastructure development, and the administration of line agencies, \nincluding UWSCG. The Ministry of Environmental Protection and Agriculture is tasked with \nenvironmental regulation; the Ministry of Labor, Health, and Social Affairs monitors the quality of \ndrinking water; and the Georgian National Energy and Water Supply Regulatory Commission \n(GNERC) regulates operators and sets tariffs. The roles and responsibilities of local governments \nin WSS management and regulation are not clearly defined. \n \n7.  Weak  capacity  of  the  key  service  providers.  Local  governments  and  UWSCG \ncollectively  serve  about  68%  of  the  population. 11  UWSCG's  inadequate  O&M  capacity \naccelerated the degradation of its assets and compromises its urban service provision, while rural \nWSS lacks a holistic solution to its multiple challenges. Local governments have limited capacity \nto  undertake  WSS  development  because  of  insufficient  financial  and  technical  resources. \nUWSCG, the sole SOE among WSS providers, is responsible for the largest individual share of \nWSS assets in Georgia, covering 90% of the nation\u2019s geographic area. Its corporate structure, \ncapacity, and resources do not align with increasing services and customer demands.12 Its \ngovernance system does not support organizational autonomy and accountability, and weakens \nits operational and financial performance. Acute skills shortages and mismatches prevail because \nUWSCG management and staff do not have the education and expertise they need. \n \n \n9  Georgia ranked 70th out of 189 countries on the Human Development Index and 75 on the Gini index in 2019. More \nthan 30% of the total population lives in the capital, Tbilisi, which contributed 52% of GDP in 2019. \n10 European Union. 2000. Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a \nframework for the Community action in the field of water policy. Brussels. \n11 Nine WSS service providers cover 56% of the total population, largely in urban areas, while local governments service \n44% of mostly rural residents. Four of the nine providers are private licensees, one is an SOE, and four are municipal \ncompanies. Three licensees are responsible for 92% of urban households: (i) Georgian Water and Power (GWP) \ncovers Tbilisi, Mtskheta, Rustavi, and Gardabani municipalities (serving 1.1 million people); (ii) Batumis Tskali, a \nmunicipal company founded in 2006, operates in the Adjara Autonomous Republic (0.1 million people); and \n(iii) UWSCG operates in 10 regions across the country (0.9 million people). The two largest service providers, GWP \nand UWSCG, cover 83% of the total urban population. \n12 UWSCG provides only 32% of its service centers with 24-hour water supply and has 77% NRW. Its staff productivity \nis low since it has more than 8 staff per 1,000 connections. \n ", "3 \n8.  Sector reforms. The government privatized Georgian Water and Power (GWP) in 2008 \nto provide services in the capital region of Tbilisi, consolidated more than 60 WSS companies \nacross the country, and incorporated UWSCG in 2010 to cover secondary cities in 10 regions. \nThrough UWSCG, the government facilitated access to low-cost capital and pooled resources to \nsupport the sector\u2019s infrastructure needs. From 2011 to 2019, it attracted more than $800 million \nin financial assistance to improve urban WSS infrastructure through UWSCG. The government \nconsiders UWSCG a strategic asset to meet its socioeconomic goals and sees WSS reforms as \na prerequisite for a next generation of physical investments. The immediate needs include \n(i) developing a single WSS policy covering urban and rural areas; (ii) improving the legal, \nregulatory,  and  institutional  environment  to  sustain  investments,  and  enable  private  sector \nparticipation  (PSP)  and  public\u2013private  partnerships  (PPPs);  and  (iii)  strengthening  the \nmanagerial, operational, technical, and financial capacity of key sector stakeholders. \n \n9.  State-owned enterprise reform. In 2020, the government initiated SOE reforms for a \nfaster post-pandemic recovery and increased macroeconomic stability. The Ministry of Finance \n(MOF) selected UWSCG to be one of the first SOEs to implement the national SOE reforms.13 \nThe government classified UWSCG as one of the three high-risk SOEs with liabilities totaling 11% \nof GDP.14 MOF wishes to capture the advantages of private sector engagement for government \nsubsidy reduction and quality services. However, UWSCG covers cities with low population \ndensity and tariff level, which are not attractive to the private sector. The government will pave \nthe way for greater PSP and PPP opportunities by making UWSCG\u2019s operational data more \nreliable,  and  improving  its  operational  performance.  Learning  from  the  GWP  privatization \nexperience, the government intends to pursue a phased approach to privatization in the WSS \nspace and to strengthen its asset quality and governance structure as initial steps.15 UWSCG will \nintroduce (i) robust corporate governance, strategic business and investment plans, and a \nstatement of corporate intent;16 and (ii) greater transparency, accountability, and incentives for \nresults. The policy dialogue of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) with the government further \nidentified the need for (i) restructuring UWSCG; (ii) installing meters and rationalizing tariffs; (iii) \npromoting PSP and PPP; (iv) introducing new technology to systematically improve services; and \n(v) integrating gender, environment, and climate resilience into WSS. \n \n10.  Poverty and gender dimensions. Nearly 35% of the population lives in households \nheaded by women, and female household heads are overrepresented among the poor and the \nbottom 40% of the income distribution. Poor WSS services are particularly hard on women \nbecause they make household chores more difficult and reduce the time for income-generating \nactivities; they also increase the risk of waterborne diseases, lost productive days when taking \n \n13 MOF will complete a fiscal analysis of all SOEs by the second half 2021, publicly disclose all government subsidies \nby 2022, and request SOEs to prepare a subsidy reduction plan for 2023. The government identified inadequate \ncorporate governance as a core weakness of SOEs. \n14 According to the 2018 Budget Law prepared by MOF, the liabilities of the 43 high-risk SOEs reached 12.8% of GDP \nby the end of 2016, and 87% of these liabilities were concentrated in three companies: Marabda\u2013Kartsakhi Railway \nCompany (44% of total), Georgian State Electrosystem (27%), and UWSCG (16%).  \n15  GWP provides services in densely populated Tbilisi, while UWSCG\u2019s service area stretches across 10 regions with \nlow population density, which increases operating costs and lowers efficiency. GWP has underperformed in terms of \nsystem leakage and metering levels but outperformed UWSCG in other areas of operational efficiency, such as \nenergy efficiency and staff productivity. ADB is providing a complementary investment of $35 million in green bonds\u2014\n$17.5 million each from OCR and Leading Asia\u2019s Private Infrastructure Fund (LEAP)\u2014to upgrade GWP\u2019s WSS \nperformance in Tbilisi and nearby municipalities.  \n16 The statement of corporate intent will define the scope of the public corporation\u2019s business and objectives, and the \nstrategies to achieve the objectives. It will include (i) risk limits; (ii) any transfers the public corporation shall receive \nfrom or pay to the budget to compensate for competitive disadvantages and advantages, and to compensate for \nundertaking activities at the government\u2019s explicit direction; and (iii) the consequences of the public corporation\u2019s \nfailure to achieve its objectives or comply with its risk or other obligations. \n ", "4 \ncare  of  sick  household  members,  and  medical  expenses. 17  In  addition,  women  are \nunderrepresented and disadvantaged in the WSS business environment. UWSCG does not have \nexplicit human resources (HR) policies and programs that address gender issues and increase \nwomen's opportunities for career advancement. Of its more than 2,700 employees, only 26% are \nwomen.18 The share of women in managerial positions is less than 20%, and only 1 of 51 service \ncenters is headed by a woman. \n \n11.  ADB engagement and development coordination. ADB is the largest development \npartner in WSS in terms of lending volumes, and has the longest engagement with UWSCG.19 It \nhas been working with UWSCG since 2011 through a multitranche financing facility (MFF) of up \nto  $500  million.20 Among  other  key  achievements,  the  MFF  financed  construction  of  11 \nwastewater treatment plants and introduced biological treatment in the country. Three other \ndevelopment partners are assisting UWSCG with a focus on infrastructure development,21 making \nADB uniquely positioned to support policy reforms in the sector. ADB coordinated with the IMF \nand key development partners on a common set of priorities for sector development.22 ADB will \nalso  explore  stronger  collaboration  with  nongovernment  organizations  in  public-awareness \nprograms. \n \n12.  Lessons. ADB\u2019s long engagement with the government contributed to the formulation of \nthe reform agenda in the proposed program. The key lessons from the ongoing MFF are that \n(i) broader institutional measures are needed to achieve a utility's turnaround, (ii) high-level \nownership and commitment are crucial for institutional reforms, (iii) policy reforms will help sustain \nproject impacts, (iv) project risks can be better managed through good business and investment \nplanning and monitoring, (v) investment in O&M capacity is imperative, and (vi) rural WSS needs \nto be integrated into the government\u2019s policy framework for overall WSS. The design of the \nprogram incorporates three recommendations from ADB\u2019s Independent Evaluation Department: \n(i) develop HR to boost productivity and reduce skills shortages, (ii) incorporate sustainability as \na priority in the project design, and (iii) make greater use of PBLs where ADB has investments \nand experience.23 \n \n13.  Strategic alignment. The program is anchored in the government\u2019s national strategies \nand program,24 notably the broader effort to reform SOEs and the 2020\u20132025 decentralization \nstrategy to devolve more power to local governments.25 The program supports the priorities of \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2019\u20132023 for Georgia and is listed in ADB\u2019s country \n \n17 About 2% of Telavi residents experienced waterborne diseases in the previous 12 months, causing an average of \n7 indisposed days with an average annual medical cost of $9.2 per capita. \n18 Men largely dominate the technical field, where women hold only 5% of technical positions. In the head office, women \naccount for about 40% of the staff but have largely administrative functions. \n19 ADB financed 18 projects in WSS from 2007 to 2019, for a total of $593 million in loans, grants, and TA. \n20 ADB. 2011.

Modality. ADB and the government selected the sector development program modality \nbecause of the parallel needs for development financing, policy reforms, and targeted project \nfinancing. The modality is appropriate because (i) the government has strong demand for sector \nreforms, (ii) UWSCG has experience in implementing ADB projects, (iii) ADB has extensive \nexperience in Georgia\u2019s WSS  environment, and (iv) budget support is necessary to  cover \ndevelopment financing gaps. \n \nB.  Policy Reform Agenda and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n15.  Policy reform agenda. Georgia\u2019s WSS system requires more planning, coordination, and \ndevelopment.  The  government  is  committed  to  strengthening  the  effectiveness  of  WSS \ngovernance  and  institutions,  providing  a  single  policy  and  better  coordination,  reducing \ninefficiencies and reliance on the state budget, and removing key legal and regulatory bottlenecks \nto enable effective WSS management and growth. A successful turnaround of UWSCG will help \nraise its business profile, establish market credibility to foster private sector participation, minimize \nthe potential risks of debt restructuring and loan refinancing, and have an important demonstration \neffect for all operators involved in WSS. \n \n16.  Synergy and balance between policy reform and project. The policy reforms and the \nproject component complement each other to catalyze sector improvements. The policy reforms \nwill build an enabling environment and increase the sustainability of the country\u2019s sector projects, \nincluding those under ADB\u2019s ongoing $500 million MFF; they will also strengthen the performance \nof  SOE  by  fostering  corporate  governance,  commercial  orientation,  and  management \naccountability and autonomy, and by making PSP and PPPs more attractive. \n \n17.  The project components are linked to effectively operationalize policy reforms. The project \nwill build capacity to deal with reform challenges and procure modern O&M equipment, and \nsupport the change process for sustainable O&M and rural WSS development. UWSCG has more \nthan 60 ongoing and planned projects, including the ongoing MFF in 2020 (footnote 20). The \ndesign of the project takes into account its institutional and operational capacity constraints, and \nthe limitations in undertaking additional works. Some of the essential O&M equipment has been \nadvanced and is procured under the ongoing MFF.28 Remaining works under the ongoing MFF \nworks (8 contracts with an estimated undisbursed amount of $87 million at the end of March 2021) \nwere also reflected in scoping the project design. Considering the volume of the ADB\u2019s ongoing \ninvestment  portfolio,  the  distribution  of the  PBL  and  project  loan  amount  is  balanced  and \ncorresponds to the government\u2019s development financing and reform needs. \n \n18.  ADB\u2019s value addition. The program supports the first policy intervention in the WSS \nenvironment and will lay a foundation for new investments and private sector engagement. During \n \n26 ADB. 2019. Country Partnership Strategy: Georgia, 2019\u20132023\u2014Developing Caucasus\u2019s Gateway to the World. \nManila; and ADB. 2019. Country Operations Business Plan: Georgia, 2020\u20132022. Manila. The strategic thrusts of \nthe  country  partnership  strategy  are  transport  corridor  development,  trade  facilitation  at  the  border,  urban \ndevelopment, HR development, regional cooperation and integration, and support to institutional reforms and other \ninterventions for resource mobilization. \n27 ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila.  \n28 The ongoing MFF supported the installation of bulk meters and the procurement of O&M equipment. \n ", "6 \n2017\u20132019, ADB helped the government prepare for WSS reforms with (i) an asset survey and \nvaluation  of  UWSCG, (ii)  a  tariff-setting  methodology  and the  institutional  strengthening  of \nGNERC, and (iii) a PPP law. ADB\u2019s continued engagement will help initiate and implement \nreforms that (i) remove development constraints and support inclusive growth; (ii) enhance \nenvironmental and climate change considerations; (iii) address women\u2019s limited participation in \nboth the community and WSS services; (iv) instill good corporate governance and a performance-\noriented  culture,  and  responsible  and  gender-sensitive  public  communication;  (v) foster \nbehavioral change toward hygiene, sanitation, and water conservation; (vi) support the phased \nengagement with the private sector; and (vii) bring high-level technology solutions to asset \nmanagement. \n \nC.  Impacts of the Reforms \n \n19.  The program is aligned with the following impact: living conditions and public health in \nGeorgia improved.29 The program will have the following outcome: performance and financial \nsustainability of WSS services improved. 30 The PBL will support output 1 by helping strengthen \nWSS governance and institutions, and the project loan will support output 2 by helping increase \nthe operational efficiency of WSS services. The stand-alone multitranche PBL will be delivered in \ntwo tranches to be disbursed in 2020 and 2021 with a post-program partnership framework (P3F) \ncovering 2021\u20132024. \n \n20.  The  reform  impacts  will  extend  beyond  UWSCG  because  the  reforms  support  the \ncountry\u2019s  infrastructure-driven  growth  as  well  as  parallel  assistance  by  other  development \npartners, and catalyze PSP and PPPs. A single government policy and central coordination for \nWSS development will result in better resource allocation and productivity. The planned law on \nwater resources management will prescribe the integrated management of water and river basins \nin line with the EU Water Framework Directive (footnote 10). It will form the legal basis for licensing \nand regulating surface water and groundwater abstraction, wastewater discharge, and allocation \nand distribution of water in the event of user conflict.31 The Energy and Water Supply Law and \nrelated resolutions will provide incentives to utilities for stepping up their operational efficiency; \nimprove their investment appraisal, planning, and monitoring activities; and ensure transparent, \nstable, and fair tariff setting by GNERC.32 \n \n21.  The historical financial performance of UWSCG is poor. In 2019, its operating ratio stood \nat 1.45, and the ratio of total debt to capital increased to 86% to cover large-scale expenditure \nprograms.33 The government provided subsidies to UWSCG to cover its operational losses and \ndebt  obligations.  The  policy  reforms  will  introduce  robust  corporate  governance  practices, \naccountability for results, and hard budget constraints to reduce government subsidies to SOEs, \nwhich will help transform UWSCG into an efficient and self-sustaining company. Partnerships with \nthe private sector will fast-track change and performance. The PBL-linked reforms will generate \ngovernment budget savings of about $100 million over 10 years.34 Through a set of policy actions \nunder the program, UWSCG will be operationally sustainable from 2023, and  generate sufficient \n \n29 Government of Georgia. 2018. Regional Development Program of Georgia 2018\u20132021. Tbilisi. \n30 The updated Design and Monitoring Framework is in Appendix 1. \n31 Stakeholders include the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Agriculture; MRDI; WSS operators such as \nUWSCG  and  municipal  water  companies,  local  governments,  community-based  organizations,  Georgian \nAmelioration, river basin management committees, industries, as well as other water users. \n32 GWP will be the first licensee to be subjected to the new Energy and Water Supply Law and related resolutions on \ninvestment appraisal and tariff methodology in 2020. \n33 UWSCG did not comply with the covenant (under the ongoing MFF) for an operating ratio of 1 or below by fiscal year \n2019 but has approved a timebound financial management action plan to achieve compliance. \n34 Fiscal Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \ncash flow to finance asset maintenance, upgrades, and expansion without external support. It will \nachieve this by (i) reducing physical losses with a related decrease of water production cost and \nenergy consumption, (ii) reducing commercial losses and increasing billings, and (iii) boosting \noperational efficiency. The required tariff increases are expected to be moderate given the utility's \nreduced commercial losses, improved O&M, and better energy and NRW management. \n \n22.  Output 1: Water supply and sanitation governance and institutions strengthened. \nThe PBL will support the government in creating a cohesive policy, legal, and institutional basis \nfor balanced urban and rural WSS development. It features 20 policy actions\u20149 under the first \ntranche and 11 under the second tranche. While the first tranche has fewer policy actions than \nthe  second  tranche,  the  first  nine  represent  the  key  drivers  of  reform,  secure  high-level \ngovernment commitments, and determine the success of the subsequent actions. All policy \nactions for tranche 1 have been completed. \n \n23.  Key  reform  area  1:  Urban  and  rural  water  supply  and  sanitation  governance \nstrengthened. Under the first-tranche policy actions, the PBL will support (i) the national adoption \nof the Energy and Water Supply Law\u2014replacing the 1997 Law on Energy and Gas\u2014and \nassociated resolutions to strengthen the legislative and regulatory framework for WSS through an \nestablished rule for the appraisal of investments and an amended tariff-setting methodology; and \n(ii) the constitution of a WSS steering committee to plan, coordinate, and monitor WSS activities. \n \n24.  Under the second tranche, the PBL will support (i) the submission to Parliament of a draft \nlaw on managing water resources to harmonize Georgia\u2019s environmental legislation under the \nAssociation Agreement with the EU;35 (ii) an integrated urban and rural WSS policy, including a \nwastewater and stormwater management strategy with gender- and climate-change-specific \nprovisions;36 and (iii) a WSS sector development framework for 2021\u20132030 that incorporates \nemerging priorities after the 2011\u20132020 urban WSS sector development plan expires in 2020. \n \n25.  Key reform area 2: Utility's governance and management effectiveness improved. \nArea 2 covers a comprehensive framework for the turnaround of UWSCG. The key corporate \nreforms under the first-tranche policy actions are (i) a supervisory board with at least 30% of \nmembers being women; (ii) a high-powered change management committee to prepare for \ninstitutional transformation and facilitate corporate restructuring; (iii) a corporate strategy for public \ncommunication and a metering program to increase revenues, lower costs, and enhance the \nengagement with the public; (iv) internal staff regulations, an HR management policy, and an HR \nmanagement  committee  to  spearhead  HR  reforms;  and  (v) a  time-bound  action  plan  to \nmainstream outsourcing in UWSCG operations. \n \n26.  The second-tranche policy actions ensure UWSCG\u2019s compliance with the SOE reforms: it \nwill be one of the first pilot SOEs to implement the statement of corporate intent (footnote 16). \nThe PBL will further support (i) a charter amendment to define the responsibilities, rights, and \nobligations of the director of UWSCG, its supervisory board, and other committees set up under \nthe first tranche; (ii) a blueprint for corporate restructuring to streamline operations; (iii) UWSCG\u2019s \nperformance  agreements  with  regional  offices,  and  with  MRDI  including  key  performance \nindicators and incentives; (iv) an asset management policy and NRW reduction strategy for 2021\u2013\n2025, once the metering program has yielded more accurate production and consumption data; \n(v) HR reforms covering an HR policy and development programs, salary and compensation \nreview, performance-based evaluations and incentives, gender equality policy, and workforce \n \n35 Georgia signed an Association Agreement with the EU in 2014. \n36 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nrationalization;  (vi)  a  water  safety  plan  to  guide  emergency  responses  and  disaster  risk \nmanagement; and (vii) a PSP\u2013PPP road map and pipeline. \n \n27.  Post-program partnership framework. A P3F will be implemented during 2021\u20132024. It \nsets the foundation for future engagement with the government and other development partners. \nIt will enable ADB to engage in policy dialogue that supports WSS and SOE reforms, and the \nimplementation of corresponding activities. Through P3F, ADB will assist the government in \nassessing the policy impact and sustainability of its reforms. The government and ADB will jointly \n(i) monitor the reform progress, results, and impacts; (ii) identify strategies to overcome gaps and \nbottlenecks; and (iii) develop a complementary program to support further reforms and future \nengagement. \n \n28.  Output 2: Operational efficiency of water supply and sanitation services increased. \nThe project will (i) provide O&M equipment for and improve UWSCG\u2019s operational capacity in \nabout 57 cities and towns in 10 regions;37 (ii) develop a strategy and investment plan, and build \nlocal capacity for rural WSS development;38 (iii) strengthen project management, monitoring, and \nevaluation, including advisory services for corporate restructuring and PSP and PPP;39 and (iv) \nincrease public awareness of infection prevention measures in the context of COVID-19 and the \nimportance of health, hygiene, and sanitation; as well as awareness of the value of water \nconservation. The project will also rehabilitate transmission mains and the distribution network; \nrepair water intakes, pumps, valves, and treatment units; and provide new reservoirs and wells in \nTelavi.40 It will enable 24-hour water supply, improving from the average daily 4-hour water supply \nnow; achieve 100% metering from 40% now; increase the number of household connections; \nreduce the NRW rate; and improve water supply pressure and energy efficiency. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs, Summary Cost Estimates, and Financing Plan \n \n29.  The overall program is estimated to cost \u20ac136.15 million ($153.50 million equivalent) \n(Table 1). ADB will provide a PBL of \u20ac115.31 million ($130 million equivalent) and a project loan \nof \u20ac17.74 million ($20 million equivalent). The summary financing plan is in Table 2.  The \ngovernment will provide counterpart funding of \u20ac3.10 million ($3.50 million equivalent). Detailed \ncost estimates by expenditure category and by financier for the project are included in the project \nadministration manual (PAM).41 \n \n \n37 O&M improvement support includes an O&M road map and action plan; a baseline survey and gap analysis of \nUWSCG\u2019s field offices; capacity development, especially in wastewater management; and the financing of related \nmodern equipment. \n38 A rural WSS project component will provide a sustainable solution for rural WSS management and operation, \nincluding an institutional framework defining the roles and responsibilities of all key stakeholders in rural WSS; guide \nthe formulation of an investment program; and support capacity building. \n39 The ongoing MFF is supporting advisory services for corporate restructuring and PSP and PPP, and the program \nwill provide additional support, as required. \n40 Telavi is being prioritized for its economic and strategic importance to tourism, agribusinesses, and the wine industry, \nwhich are key contributors to employment and revenue generation. Telavi is listed as a priority city in the Regional \nDevelopment Program of Georgia 2018\u20132021.

Its foreign borrowing \nwill be $1.41 billion in 2020, mainly from international financial institutions and bilateral partners. \nTotal ADB budget support in 2020 amounts to $530 million, or 34.6% of the government\u2019s \nfinancing requirements.42 \n  \n31.  Policy-based loan. The government has requested a regular loan of \u20ac115.31 million \n($130 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. The PBL will be disbursed in two \ntranches, with actions in the second tranche building on actions under the first tranche. The \ndistribution of the PBL between the two tranches is in line with the government\u2019s development \nfinancing needs in 2020 ($1.53 billion) and 2021 ($0.57 billion). The loan will have a 15-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per \nyear (the interest and other charges during construction to be capitalized in the loan); and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on the straight-line \nmethod, the average maturity is 9.25 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. \nThe  first  tranche  of  \u20ac70.96  million  ($80  million  equivalent)  will  be  released  upon  loan \neffectiveness.

In addition, \nbudget support from other development partners in 2020 amounts to $880 million: (i) $205 million from Agence \nFran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement, (ii) $100 million from Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, (iii) $95 million from the \nEU, (iv) $100 million from German development cooperation through KfW, (v) $200 million from the IMF, and (vi) \n$180 million from the World Bank. \n ", "10 \nreleased in 2021, upon full compliance with the conditions of the second tranche. \n \n32.  Project loan. The government has requested a regular loan of \u20ac17.74 million ($20 million \nequivalent) from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to finance the project component of the \nprogram. The loan will have a 23-year term, including a grace period of 14 years; an annual \ninterest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; a commitment \ncharge of 0.15% per year (the interest and other charges during construction to be capitalized in \nthe loan); and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreements. Based on \nthe straight-line method, the average maturity is 18.75 years, and there is an 0.20% maturity \npremium payable to ADB. ADB will finance civil works, goods, consulting and nonconsulting \nservices,  and  related  contingencies  and  financial  charges  during  implementation.  The \ngovernment will finance expenditures related to taxes and duties. \n  \n33.  Climate finance. Climate change mitigation measures, including the promotion of energy \nefficiency and NRW reduction in the policy and project, are estimated to cost $6.5 million. Climate \nadaptation from four key policy actions is estimated to cost $9.9 million. ADB will finance 100% \nof mitigation and adaptation costs.43 \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n34.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe PAM (footnote 41). The government requested advance action and retroactive financing for \nthe procurement of goods and consulting services. All procurement financed under the project \nloan  will  follow  the  ADB  Procurement  Policy  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and \nProcurement Regulation for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  Policy-based loan:  Project loan: \nNovember 2020\u2013December 2021  November 2020\u2013December 2024 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2021   31 December 2024 \nEstimated loans closing date  31 December 2021   30 June 2025 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  WSS steering committee chaired by MRDI minister \nMembers: MRDI, MOESD, MOF, UWSCG within 3 months of the loan \neffectiveness \n(ii)  Executing agency  Policy-based loan: MOF  Project loan: MRDI \n(iii)  Key implementing  Policy-based loan: MRDI and UWSCG  Project loan: UWSCG \nagencies \n(iv)  Implementation unit  IPMO, established by UWSCG \nProcurement  Open competitive bidding  1 contract  $8,610,000 \n(internationally advertised): works  \nOpen competitive bidding  1 contract  $3,720,000 \n(internationally advertised): goods  \nConsulting services  CQS: construction supervision  106 person-months  $850,000  \nconsultant \n  QCBS (90:10): O&M improvement  51 person-months  $1,270,000  \nQCBS (90:10): rural WSS sector  132 person-months  $3,820,000  \ndevelopment \n  LCS: auditor  58 person-months  $112,000 \n  ICS: IPMO staff    $448,000 \n  ICS: public-awareness campaigns    $70,000 \n \n43 Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "11 \nAspects  Arrangements \nRetroactive financing and  Retroactive financing and advance contracting are proposed for the construction \nadvance contracting  of the Telavi water supply system and the construction supervision consultant. \nSuch financing will not exceed 20% of the project loan amount for expenditures \nincurred not more than 12 months prior to the signing of the loan agreement. \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed following ADB's Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements \nagreed between the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CQS = consultant\u2019s qualifications selection, ICS = individual consultant selection, \nIPMO = Investment Program Management Office, LCS = least-cost selection, MOESD = Ministry of Economy and \nSustainable Development, MOF = Ministry of Finance, MRDI = Ministry of Regional Development and Infrastructure, \nO&M = operation and maintenance, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection, UWSCG = United Water Supply \nCompany of Georgia, WSS = water supply and sanitation.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIII.  ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n35.  The TA will introduce an asset management system with high-level technology for water \nsupply in select cities to demonstrate its benefits, which is an innovative approach for Georgia. \nThe TA is estimated to cost $250,000, of which $225,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the \nHigh-Level Technology Fund (footnote 1). ADB will be the executing agency for the TA and will \nassist UWSCG in vetting technology solutions for asset management; it will also ensure its \nfunctional use through capacity building and knowledge sharing. The government will provide \ncounterpart support of about $25,000 in the form of staff, office accommodation, supplies, and \nother in-kind contributions.44 \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n36.  The project is technically viable based on a comprehensive review of UWSCG\u2019s bidding \ndocument for the Telavi water system. ADB appraised the design based on rationale and \nrelevance, benefits, and ease of implementation and operations. The technology selected for the \nrehabilitation of the water supply system is appropriate and compatible with local conditions. The \nproject will optimize the implementation timelines through high project readiness. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n37.  Economic analysis. The project is economically viable with an economic internal rate of \nreturn of 13.6%, above the 9.0% minimum required economic rate of return for ADB investment \nprojects, and an economic net present value of $3.9 million. This mainly reflects the substantial \nbenefits from the project\u2014health benefits from avoided time lost to illness and avoided medical \ntreatment  costs;  and  resource  cost  savings  from  less  time  spent  collecting  water,  lower \ninvestment and O&M costs for water supply, and cost savings from a reduction in NRW. The \neconomic viability is most sensitive to reductions in health benefits and resource costs savings. \nThe sensitivity analyses confirm that the project is expected to remain viable under various \nadverse  scenarios.  The  economic  impact  from  the  PBL-linked  reforms  is  expected  to  be \nsignificant since UWSCG budget savings may be allocated to more productive activities.45 \n \n38.  Financial analysis. The project financial internal rate of return is 1.9% and the financial \n \n44 Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n45 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "12 \nnet present value, when discounted at the weighted average cost of capital of 0.8%, is $4.3 million. \nWater and wastewater tariffs were assumed to increase in real terms by 50% in 2024 once the \nproject is completed, and thereafter increase by 5% every 3 years. Financial benefits from the \nproject consist of (i) additional revenue as a result of a tariff increase; and (ii) a reduction in NRW, \nwhich in turn enables UWSCG to bill more customers and save on energy consumption. The \nfinancial viability remains robust across adverse conditions: a 10% increase in investment costs, \na 10% increase in O&M costs, a 10% decrease in benefits, and a 1-year construction delay. \n \n39.  Tariff. The current tariff is set at GEL0.68 per cubic meter (m3) (or $0.22 per m3). If \nUWSCG were to achieve an operating ratio of 1 in 2019 with all other parameters unchanged, the \naverage tariff would have to be increased to GEL0.99 per m3 (or $0.32 per m3), a one-time \nincrease of 45%. To cover its operational expenditures, including amortization and depreciation, \nand cover debt service obligations, UWSCG requires a tariff of GEL1.95 per m3 (or $0.64 per m3), \nthree times higher than the current one and without any operational enhancement measures. \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n40.  The  project's  sustainability  is rated  high  given  the  policy  actions  on asset  and  HR \nmanagement. More efficient O&M and the attached TA in support of innovative water supply asset \nmanagement will lead to the operational and financial sustainability of UWSCG. \n \n41.  The sustainability of policy reforms is high, considering the government\u2019s commitment to \nreforms with P3F. The government is also working on various complementary reforms to public \ninvestment management and SOEs, and the regulatory frameworks for PSP and PPP. \n \nD.  Governance \n \n42.  The pre-mitigation financial management risk is rated moderate. UWSCG has adequate \nfinancial management systems and adopted international standards for accounting and financial \nreporting. The 2018 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability assessment report noted \nstrong and improved country public financial management systems.46 Georgia has successfully \nimplemented the public financial management reform action plan to strengthen fiscal governance, \ntransparency, budget reliability and execution, and external scrutiny and audit.47 \n \n43.  The procurement risk is low.48 A project procurement risk assessment and strategic \nprocurement planning were undertaken and found that the tender processes are aligned with \ninternational best practices and considered to be among the most transparent in Europe and \nCentral  Asia.49 Major  risks  identified  are  the  low  capacity  for  bid  evaluation  and  handling \nconsulting service contracts, and ineffective implementation of projects. The ADB procurement \ncomplaint system will be used to mitigate the risks. \n \n44.  No significant integrity risks were identified.50 ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \n \n46 EU. 2017.

The project contributes to poverty reduction through the provision of essential services. \nAn inclusive policy, and stronger governance and utility management will increase coverage and \nequity  of  access  to  water  services  across  different  social  groups,  including  low-income \nhouseholds. \n \n46.  The program is classified effective gender mainstreaming. UWSCG has implemented \ngender mainstreaming activities under the ongoing MFF, which will be further reinforced and \nexpanded (footnote 36). The program will help (i) develop a gender-sensitive WSS policy to \nincrease  women\u2019s  participation,  employment,  and  technical  participation  in  WSS; (ii)  boost \nwomen\u2019s representation in decision-making structures; (iii) adopt gender-sensitive HR policies to \ngive women opportunities for career advancement, and protect them from sexual harassment, \namong other gender-based concerns; (iv) involve women in all training sessions for UWSCG; and \n(v) formulate a gender-sensitive public communication strategy. \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n47.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), all safeguard documents \nwere prepared based on consultations with affected people and communities, endorsed by the \ngovernment authorities, and disclosed on the ADB website in accordance with ADB\u2019s Access to \nInformation Policy.51 Grievance redress, monitoring, and reporting procedures were agreed with \nUWSCG and specified in all safeguard documents. The project includes adequate resources to \nimplement and monitor mitigation measures. For the PBL, no significant environmental and social \nimpact is anticipated. \n \n48.  Environment (category B). The project is not within or adjacent to any environmentally \nsensitive areas. It is expected to have temporary and site-specific adverse impacts on the \nenvironment. Adequate mitigation measures were incorporated into the project design and will be \nimplemented through the environmental management plan.52 \n \n49.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). No land acquisition and resettlement impacts \nare expected since the project activities are planned to be carried out on state-owned land not \nused by any person. No physical or economic displacement will occur. A land acquisition and \nresettlement framework was prepared to guide future screening and resettlement planning, if \nany.53 \n \n50.

Site-specific adverse impacts include air pollution, \nsoil erosion, and surface water pollution; noise and vibration; and solid waste generation. Impacts on existing \ninfrastructure, traffic disruptions, and occupational and community health and safety issues may also arise. Public \nconsultations were held in June 2020. \n53 The land acquisition and resettlement framework and social due diligence report were disclosed in July 2020.
