The report also describes the proposed administration \nof technical assistance (TA)\u2014Supporting High-Level Technology for Asset Management\u2014to be \nprovided by the High-Level Technology Fund1 and, if the Board approves the proposed loans, I, \nacting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the TA. \n \n2. \nThe proposed program supports the government\u2019s pursuit of sustainable water supply and \nsanitation  (WSS)  services  and  an  efficient  state-owned  enterprise  (SOE).  The  policy  actions \nunder  the  stand-alone  multitranche  PBL  will  transform  WSS  governance  and  institutions  to \nimprove performance and financial sustainability, while ensuring funding for basic services during \na period of fiscal constraints brought on by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The \nproject will (i) strengthen the operation and maintenance (O&M) capacity of United Water Supply \nCompany of Georgia (UWSCG),2 (ii) prepare strategic investment plans for national-scale rural \nWSS development, and (iii) increase public awareness of infection prevention measures in the \ncontext  of  COVID-19  through  a  gender-sensitive  health,  hygiene,  and sanitation program.  The \nproject will also improve the water supply system in Telavi city, a regional center and employment \ngeneration hub, to enable 24-hour water supply.3 The TA will introduce high-level technology into \nasset management systems to enhance O&M in select cities. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nMacroeconomic  context  and  COVID-19  impacts.  Georgia  enjoyed  a  4.7%  average \nannual  rate  of  gross  domestic  product (GDP)  growth  and  kept  its  annual  fiscal  deficit  equal to \nabout 1.0% of GDP in 2011\u20132019.4 It halved its poverty rate from 38.8% in 2007 to 20.1% in 2018. \nUnemployment declined from 17.3% in 2011 to 11.6% in 2019. Public debt to GDP stood at 44.5% \nin 2019. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) assessed public debt as remaining sustainable \nin the medium term.5 The inflation forecast for 2020 is adjusted upward to 5% above the central \nbank  target  of  3%  as  the  lari  depreciated  rapidly.  The  government  plans  for  a  gradual  fiscal \nconsolidation starting in 2021. The National Bank of Georgia will continue to exercise caution in \nits policy stance to balance the impact of the lari depreciation. GDP growth is estimated to drop \nto -5% in 2020 because of the COVID-19-induced economic slowdown.6 Timely budget support \nis critical for (i) imminent fiscal relief and COVID-19 management,7 (ii) structural reforms against \nfiscal risks arising from SOEs, and (iii) substantial development financing needs from the COVID-\n19 impact.8 COVID-19 is expected to reduce UWSCG revenues from commercial customers\u2014an \nessential revenue stream\u2014by up to 30% in 2020. \n\n \n\n1  Financing partner: Government of Japan. Administered by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n2  UWSCG is a limited liability company established in January 2010, and the state owns 100% of the shares. \n3  Telavi is the 13th largest city with a population of 20,000. It is 158 kilometers east of the capital, Tbilisi. Adequate \n\nwater supply is critical for Telavi\u2019s wine and agricultural production, and for tourism. \n\n4  IMF. Georgia and IMF: Country Data (accessed on 24 August 2020).   \n5  IMF. 2020. IMF Country Report No. 20/149. Washington, DC. \n6  ADB. 2020. Asian Development Outlook Supplement: Lockdown, Loosening, and Asia\u2019s Growth Prospects. Manila. \n7  ADB.  2020.  Georgia:  COVID-19  Active  Response  and  Expenditure  Support  Program. Manila.  At  least  1.2 million \nfamilies will benefit from subsidized utility bills for water, electricity, and waste management for at least 3 months. \n8  Georgia\u2019s development financing needs is estimated at $1.53 billion in 2020. The government has more than 200 \n\nongoing WSS works contracts that risk either cancellation or termination. \n\n \n\n\fInadequate  provision  of  water  supply  and  sanitation  services.  Access  to  essential \n4. \nWSS  services  varies  across  the  country,  and  disparities  between  urban  and  rural  areas  are \nincreasing.9 About 92% of urban residents and 64% of rural residents receive piped water, while \n84% of urban and 20% of rural residents have access to sewerage systems. Only 36% of the total \npopulation benefit from wastewater treatment. Water supply is not continuous, ranging nationwide \nfrom 4 hours per day to 24 hours per day, which poses a significant health risk during the COVID-\n19 pandemic. Telavi households, for example, suffer from intermittent water supply of 4 hours per \nday (footnote 3). The quality of service suffers from operational inefficiencies, as evident in a high \nrate of nonrevenue water (NRW), estimated at 66%, and in just 47% of households being metered. \n \n5. \nOutdated sector policy and regulations. Georgia lacks a consolidated vision and policy \nto  guide  urban  and  rural  WSS  planning  and  development.  Multiple  regulations  and  strategies \nexist, but without a coherent and integrated approach. The 1997 Water Law, currently in force, \ndoes not align with European Union (EU) legislation for integrated water resources and river basin \nmanagement.10 The  1997  Energy  and  Gas  Law  and  related  regulations  apply  primarily  to  the \nenergy sector and lack a focus on WSS. \n \n6. \nInadequate institutional arrangements. Sector planning, development, and monitoring \nare not coordinated, involve multiple stakeholders, and largely exclude the participation of local \ngovernments. The Ministry of Regional Development and Infrastructure (MRDI) is responsible for \nWSS  policy  formulation,  infrastructure  development,  and  the  administration  of  line  agencies, \nincluding  UWSCG.  The  Ministry  of  Environmental  Protection  and  Agriculture  is  tasked  with \nenvironmental regulation; the Ministry of Labor, Health, and Social Affairs monitors the quality of \ndrinking  water;  and  the  Georgian  National  Energy  and  Water  Supply  Regulatory  Commission \n(GNERC) regulates operators and sets tariffs. The roles and responsibilities of local governments \nin WSS management and regulation are not clearly defined. \n \n7. \nWeak  capacity  of  the  key  service  providers.  Local  governments  and  UWSCG \ncollectively  serve  about  68%  of  the  population. 11  UWSCG's  inadequate  O&M  capacity \naccelerated the degradation of its assets and compromises its urban service provision, while rural \nWSS lacks a holistic solution to its multiple challenges. Local governments have limited capacity \nto  undertake  WSS  development  because  of  insufficient  financial  and  technical  resources. \nUWSCG, the sole SOE among WSS providers, is responsible for the largest individual share of \nWSS assets in Georgia, covering 90% of the nation\u2019s geographic area. Its corporate structure, \ncapacity,  and  resources  do  not  align  with  increasing  services  and  customer  demands. 12 Its \ngovernance system does not support organizational autonomy and accountability, and weakens \nits operational and financial performance. Acute skills shortages and mismatches prevail because \nUWSCG management and staff do not have the education and expertise they need. \n \n\n \n\n9  Georgia ranked 70th out of 189 countries on the Human Development Index and 75 on the Gini index in 2019. More \n\nthan 30% of the total population lives in the capital, Tbilisi, which contributed 52% of GDP in 2019. \n\n10 European  Union.  2000.  Directive  2000/60/EC  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  establishing  a \n\nframework for the Community action in the field of water policy. Brussels. \n\n11 Nine WSS service providers cover 56% of the total population, largely in urban areas, while local governments service \n44% of mostly rural residents. Four of the nine providers are private licensees, one is an SOE, and four are municipal \ncompanies. Three licensees are responsible for 92%  of urban households: (i) Georgian Water and Power (GWP) \ncovers  Tbilisi, Mtskheta,  Rustavi,  and  Gardabani  municipalities  (serving 1.1  million  people);  (ii)  Batumis  Tskali, a \nmunicipal  company  founded  in  2006,  operates  in  the  Adjara  Autonomous  Republic  (0.1  million  people);  and \n(iii) UWSCG operates in 10 regions across the country (0.9 million people). The two largest service providers, GWP \nand UWSCG, cover 83% of the total urban population. \n\n12 UWSCG provides only 32% of its service centers with 24-hour water supply and has 77% NRW. Its staff productivity \n\nis low since it has more than 8 staff per 1,000 connections. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fSector reforms. The government privatized Georgian Water and Power (GWP) in 2008 \n8. \nto  provide  services  in the capital  region  of  Tbilisi,  consolidated  more  than  60 WSS  companies \nacross the country, and incorporated UWSCG in 2010 to cover secondary cities in 10 regions. \nThrough UWSCG, the government facilitated access to low-cost capital and pooled resources to \nsupport the sector\u2019s infrastructure needs. From 2011 to 2019, it attracted more than $800 million \nin financial assistance to improve urban WSS infrastructure through UWSCG. The government \nconsiders UWSCG a strategic asset to meet its socioeconomic goals and sees WSS reforms as \na  prerequisite  for  a  next  generation  of  physical  investments.  The  immediate  needs  include \n(i) developing  a  single  WSS  policy  covering  urban  and  rural  areas;  (ii)  improving  the  legal, \nregulatory,  and  institutional  environment  to  sustain  investments,  and  enable  private  sector \nparticipation  (PSP)  and  public\u2013private  partnerships  (PPPs);  and  (iii)  strengthening  the \nmanagerial, operational, technical, and financial capacity of key sector stakeholders. \n \n9. \nState-owned  enterprise  reform.  In  2020,  the  government  initiated  SOE  reforms  for  a \nfaster post-pandemic recovery and increased macroeconomic stability. The Ministry of Finance \n(MOF) selected UWSCG to be one of the first SOEs to implement the national SOE reforms.13 \nThe government classified UWSCG as one of the three high-risk SOEs with liabilities totaling 11% \nof GDP.14 MOF wishes to capture the advantages of private sector engagement for government \nsubsidy  reduction  and  quality  services.  However,  UWSCG  covers  cities  with  low  population \ndensity and tariff level, which are not attractive to the private sector. The government will pave \nthe  way  for  greater  PSP  and  PPP  opportunities  by  making  UWSCG\u2019s  operational  data  more \nreliable,  and  improving  its  operational  performance.  Learning  from  the  GWP  privatization \nexperience,  the  government  intends  to  pursue  a  phased  approach  to  privatization  in the  WSS \nspace and to strengthen its asset quality and governance structure as initial steps.15 UWSCG will \nintroduce  (i)  robust  corporate  governance,  strategic  business  and  investment  plans,  and  a \nstatement  of  corporate intent;16 and  (ii)  greater  transparency,  accountability,  and  incentives  for \nresults. The policy dialogue of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) with the government further \nidentified the need for (i) restructuring UWSCG; (ii) installing meters and rationalizing tariffs; (iii) \npromoting PSP and PPP; (iv) introducing new technology to systematically improve services; and \n(v) integrating gender, environment, and climate resilience into WSS. \n \n10. \nPoverty  and  gender  dimensions.  Nearly  35%  of  the  population  lives  in  households \nheaded by women, and female household heads are overrepresented among the poor and the \nbottom  40%  of  the  income  distribution.  Poor  WSS  services  are  particularly  hard  on  women \nbecause they make household chores more difficult and reduce the time for income-generating \nactivities; they also increase the risk of waterborne diseases, lost productive days when taking \n\n \n\n13 MOF will complete a fiscal analysis of all SOEs by the second half 2021, publicly disclose all government subsidies \nby 2022, and request SOEs to prepare  a subsidy reduction plan for 2023. The government identified  inadequate \ncorporate governance as a core weakness of SOEs. \n\n14 According to the 2018 Budget Law prepared by MOF, the liabilities of the 43 high-risk SOEs reached 12.8% of GDP \nby the end of 2016, and 87% of these liabilities were concentrated in three companies: Marabda\u2013Kartsakhi Railway \nCompany (44% of total), Georgian State Electrosystem (27%), and UWSCG (16%).  \n\n15  GWP provides services in densely populated Tbilisi, while UWSCG\u2019s service area stretches across 10 regions with \nlow population density, which increases operating costs and lowers efficiency. GWP has underperformed in terms of \nsystem  leakage  and  metering  levels  but  outperformed  UWSCG  in  other  areas  of  operational  efficiency,  such  as \nenergy efficiency and staff productivity. ADB is providing a complementary investment of $35 million in green bonds\u2014\n$17.5  million  each  from  OCR  and  Leading  Asia\u2019s  Private  Infrastructure  Fund  (LEAP)\u2014to  upgrade  GWP\u2019s  WSS \nperformance in Tbilisi and nearby municipalities.  \n\n16 The statement of corporate intent will define the scope of the public corporation\u2019s business and objectives, and the \nstrategies to achieve the objectives. It will include (i) risk limits; (ii) any transfers the public corporation shall receive \nfrom or pay to the budget to compensate for competitive disadvantages and advantages, and to compensate for \nundertaking activities at the government\u2019s explicit direction; and (iii) the consequences of the public corporation\u2019s \nfailure to achieve its objectives or comply with its risk or other obligations. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\ncare  of  sick  household  members,  and  medical  expenses. 17  In  addition,  women  are \nunderrepresented and disadvantaged in the WSS business environment. UWSCG does not have \nexplicit human resources (HR) policies and programs that address gender issues and increase \nwomen's opportunities for career advancement. Of its more than 2,700 employees, only 26% are \nwomen.18 The share of women in managerial positions is less than 20%, and only 1 of 51 service \ncenters is headed by a woman. \n \n11. \nADB  engagement  and  development  coordination.  ADB  is  the  largest  development \npartner in WSS in terms of lending volumes, and has the longest engagement with UWSCG.19 It \nhas been working with UWSCG since 2011 through a multitranche financing facility (MFF) of up \nto  $500  million. 20  Among  other  key  achievements,  the  MFF  financed  construction  of  11 \nwastewater  treatment  plants  and  introduced  biological  treatment  in  the  country.  Three  other \ndevelopment partners are assisting UWSCG with a focus on infrastructure development,21 making \nADB uniquely positioned to support policy reforms in the sector. ADB coordinated with the IMF \nand key development partners on a common set of priorities for sector development.22 ADB will \nalso  explore  stronger  collaboration  with  nongovernment  organizations  in  public-awareness \nprograms. \n \n12. \nLessons. ADB\u2019s long engagement with the government contributed to the formulation of \nthe  reform  agenda  in  the  proposed  program.  The  key  lessons  from  the  ongoing  MFF  are that \n(i) broader  institutional  measures  are  needed  to  achieve  a  utility's  turnaround,  (ii)  high-level \nownership and commitment are crucial for institutional reforms, (iii) policy reforms will help sustain \nproject impacts, (iv) project risks can be better managed through good business and investment \nplanning and monitoring, (v) investment in O&M capacity is imperative, and (vi) rural WSS needs \nto  be  integrated  into  the  government\u2019s  policy  framework  for  overall  WSS.  The  design  of  the \nprogram incorporates three recommendations from ADB\u2019s Independent Evaluation Department: \n(i) develop HR to boost productivity and reduce skills shortages, (ii) incorporate sustainability as \na priority in the project design, and (iii) make greater use of PBLs where ADB has investments \nand experience.23 \n \n13. \nStrategic alignment. The program is anchored in the government\u2019s national strategies \nand program,24 notably the  broader  effort to reform  SOEs  and  the  2020\u20132025  decentralization \nstrategy  to  devolve  more  power  to  local  governments.25 The program  supports  the  priorities  of \nADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2019\u20132023  for  Georgia  and  is  listed  in  ADB\u2019s  country \n\n \n\n17 About 2% of Telavi residents experienced waterborne diseases in the previous 12 months, causing an average of \n\n7 indisposed days with an average annual medical cost of $9.2 per capita. \n\n18 Men largely dominate the technical field, where women hold only 5% of technical positions. In the head office, women \n\naccount for about 40% of the staff but have largely administrative functions. \n\n19 ADB financed 18 projects in WSS from 2007 to 2019, for a total of $593 million in loans, grants, and TA. \n20 ADB.  2011.

Modality. ADB and the government selected the sector development program modality \nbecause  of  the  parallel  needs  for  development  financing,  policy  reforms,  and  targeted  project \nfinancing. The modality is appropriate because (i) the government has strong demand for sector \nreforms,  (ii)  UWSCG  has  experience  in  implementing  ADB  projects,  (iii)  ADB  has  extensive \nexperience  in  Georgia\u2019s  WSS  environment,  and  (iv)  budget  support  is  necessary  to  cover \ndevelopment financing gaps. \n \nB. \n \n15. \nPolicy reform agenda. Georgia\u2019s WSS system requires more planning, coordination, and \ndevelopment.  The  government  is  committed  to  strengthening  the  effectiveness  of  WSS \ngovernance  and  institutions,  providing  a  single  policy  and  better  coordination,  reducing \ninefficiencies and reliance on the state budget, and removing key legal and regulatory bottlenecks \nto enable effective WSS management and growth. A successful turnaround of UWSCG will help \nraise its business profile, establish market credibility to foster private sector participation, minimize \nthe potential risks of debt restructuring and loan refinancing, and have an important demonstration \neffect for all operators involved in WSS. \n \n16. \nSynergy and balance between policy reform and project. The policy reforms and the \nproject component complement each other to catalyze sector improvements. The policy reforms \nwill build an enabling environment and increase the sustainability of the country\u2019s sector projects, \nincluding those under ADB\u2019s ongoing $500 million MFF; they will also strengthen the performance \nof  SOE  by  fostering  corporate  governance,  commercial  orientation,  and  management \naccountability and autonomy, and by making PSP and PPPs more attractive. \n \n17. \nThe project components are linked to effectively operationalize policy reforms. The project \nwill  build  capacity  to  deal  with  reform  challenges  and  procure  modern  O&M  equipment,  and \nsupport the change process for sustainable O&M and rural WSS development. UWSCG has more \nthan  60  ongoing  and  planned  projects,  including  the  ongoing  MFF  in  2020  (footnote  20).  The \ndesign of the project takes into account its institutional and operational capacity constraints, and \nthe limitations in undertaking additional works. Some of the essential O&M equipment has been \nadvanced and is procured under the ongoing MFF.28 Remaining works under the ongoing MFF \nworks (8 contracts with an estimated undisbursed amount of $87 million at the end of March 2021) \nwere also reflected in scoping the project design. Considering the volume of the ADB\u2019s ongoing \ninvestment  portfolio,  the  distribution  of  the  PBL  and  project  loan  amount  is  balanced  and \ncorresponds to the government\u2019s development financing and reform needs. \n \n18. \nADB\u2019s  value  addition.

ADB\u2019s  continued  engagement  will  help  initiate  and  implement \nreforms  that  (i)  remove  development  constraints  and  support  inclusive  growth;  (ii) enhance \nenvironmental and climate change considerations; (iii) address women\u2019s limited participation in \nboth the community and WSS services; (iv) instill good corporate governance and a performance-\noriented  culture,  and  responsible  and  gender-sensitive  public  communication;  (v) foster \nbehavioral change toward hygiene, sanitation, and water conservation; (vi) support the phased \nengagement  with  the  private  sector;  and  (vii)  bring  high-level  technology  solutions  to  asset \nmanagement. \n \nC. \n \n19. \nThe  program  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  living  conditions  and  public  health  in \nGeorgia  improved.29 The  program  will  have  the  following  outcome:  performance  and  financial \nsustainability of WSS services improved. 30 The PBL will support output 1 by helping strengthen \nWSS governance and institutions, and the project loan will support output 2 by helping increase \nthe operational efficiency of WSS services. The stand-alone multitranche PBL will be delivered in \ntwo tranches to be disbursed in 2020 and 2021 with a post-program partnership framework (P3F) \ncovering 2021\u20132024. \n \n20. \nThe  reform  impacts  will  extend  beyond  UWSCG  because  the  reforms  support  the \ncountry\u2019s  infrastructure-driven  growth  as  well  as  parallel  assistance  by  other  development \npartners, and catalyze PSP and PPPs. A single government policy and central coordination for \nWSS development will result in better resource allocation and productivity. The planned law on \nwater resources management will prescribe the integrated management of water and river basins \nin line with the EU Water Framework Directive (footnote 10). It will form the legal basis for licensing \nand regulating surface water and groundwater abstraction, wastewater discharge, and allocation \nand distribution of water in the event of user conflict.31 The Energy and Water Supply Law and \nrelated resolutions will provide incentives to utilities for stepping up their operational efficiency; \nimprove their investment appraisal, planning, and monitoring activities; and ensure transparent, \nstable, and fair tariff setting by GNERC.32 \n \n21. \nThe historical financial performance of UWSCG is poor. In 2019, its operating ratio stood \nat 1.45, and the ratio of total debt to capital increased to 86% to cover large-scale expenditure \nprograms.33 The government provided subsidies to UWSCG to cover its operational losses and \ndebt  obligations.  The  policy  reforms  will  introduce  robust  corporate  governance  practices, \naccountability for results, and hard budget constraints to reduce government subsidies to SOEs, \nwhich will help transform UWSCG into an efficient and self-sustaining company. Partnerships with \nthe private sector will fast-track change and performance. The PBL-linked reforms will generate \ngovernment budget savings of about $100 million over 10 years.34 Through a set of policy actions \nunder the program, UWSCG will be operationally sustainable from 2023, and  generate sufficient \n\n \n\n29 Government of Georgia. 2018.

It will \nachieve this by (i) reducing physical losses with a related decrease of water production cost and \nenergy consumption,  (ii) reducing  commercial  losses  and  increasing  billings,  and  (iii)  boosting \noperational efficiency. The required tariff increases are expected to be moderate given the utility's \nreduced commercial losses, improved O&M, and better energy and NRW management. \n \n22. \nOutput 1: Water supply and sanitation governance and institutions strengthened. \nThe PBL will support the government in creating a cohesive policy, legal, and institutional basis \nfor balanced urban and rural WSS development. It features 20 policy actions\u20149 under the first \ntranche and 11 under the second tranche. While the first tranche has fewer policy actions than \nthe  second  tranche,  the  first  nine  represent  the  key  drivers  of  reform,  secure  high-level \ngovernment  commitments,  and  determine  the  success  of  the  subsequent  actions.  All  policy \nactions for tranche 1 have been completed. \n \n23. \nKey  reform  area  1:  Urban  and  rural  water  supply  and  sanitation  governance \nstrengthened. Under the first-tranche policy actions, the PBL will support (i) the national adoption \nof  the  Energy  and  Water  Supply  Law\u2014replacing  the  1997  Law  on  Energy  and  Gas\u2014and \nassociated resolutions to strengthen the legislative and regulatory framework for WSS through an \nestablished rule for the appraisal of investments and an amended tariff-setting methodology; and \n(ii) the constitution of a WSS steering committee to plan, coordinate, and monitor WSS activities. \n \n24. \nUnder the second tranche, the PBL will support (i) the submission to Parliament of a draft \nlaw  on  managing  water  resources  to  harmonize  Georgia\u2019s  environmental  legislation  under  the \nAssociation Agreement with the EU;35 (ii) an integrated urban and rural WSS policy, including a \nwastewater  and  stormwater  management  strategy  with  gender-  and  climate-change-specific \nprovisions;36 and  (iii)  a  WSS  sector  development  framework  for  2021\u20132030  that  incorporates \nemerging priorities after the 2011\u20132020 urban WSS sector development plan expires in 2020. \n \n25. \nKey reform area 2: Utility's governance and management effectiveness improved. \nArea  2  covers  a  comprehensive  framework  for  the  turnaround  of  UWSCG.  The  key  corporate \nreforms  under  the  first-tranche  policy  actions  are  (i)  a  supervisory  board  with  at  least  30%  of \nmembers  being  women;  (ii)  a  high-powered  change  management  committee  to  prepare  for \ninstitutional transformation and facilitate corporate restructuring; (iii) a corporate strategy for public \ncommunication  and  a  metering  program  to  increase  revenues,  lower  costs,  and  enhance  the \nengagement with the public; (iv) internal staff regulations, an HR management policy, and an HR \nmanagement  committee  to  spearhead  HR  reforms;  and  (v) a  time-bound  action  plan  to \nmainstream outsourcing in UWSCG operations. \n \n26. \nThe second-tranche policy actions ensure UWSCG\u2019s compliance with the SOE reforms: it \nwill be one of the first pilot SOEs to implement the statement of corporate intent (footnote 16). \nThe PBL will  further  support (i)  a charter  amendment to  define  the  responsibilities,  rights,  and \nobligations of the director of UWSCG, its supervisory board, and other committees set up under \nthe first tranche; (ii) a blueprint for corporate restructuring to streamline operations; (iii) UWSCG\u2019s \nperformance  agreements  with  regional  offices,  and  with  MRDI  including  key  performance \nindicators and incentives; (iv) an asset management policy and NRW reduction strategy for 2021\u2013\n2025, once the metering program has yielded more accurate production and consumption data; \n(v)  HR  reforms  covering  an  HR  policy  and  development  programs,  salary  and  compensation \nreview,  performance-based  evaluations  and  incentives,  gender  equality  policy,  and  workforce \n\n35 Georgia signed an Association Agreement with the EU in 2014. \n36 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\frationalization;  (vi)  a  water  safety  plan  to  guide  emergency  responses  and  disaster  risk \nmanagement; and (vii) a PSP\u2013PPP road map and pipeline. \n \n27. \nPost-program partnership framework. A P3F will be implemented during 2021\u20132024. It \nsets the foundation for future engagement with the government and other development partners. \nIt  will  enable ADB to  engage  in policy  dialogue  that supports  WSS  and SOE reforms,  and  the \nimplementation  of  corresponding  activities.  Through  P3F,  ADB  will  assist  the  government  in \nassessing the policy impact and sustainability of its reforms. The government and ADB will jointly \n(i) monitor the reform progress, results, and impacts; (ii) identify strategies to overcome gaps and \nbottlenecks;  and  (iii)  develop  a  complementary  program  to  support  further  reforms  and  future \nengagement. \n \nOutput 2: Operational efficiency of water supply and sanitation services increased. \n28. \nThe  project  will  (i)  provide  O&M  equipment  for  and  improve  UWSCG\u2019s  operational  capacity  in \nabout 57 cities and towns in 10 regions;37 (ii) develop a strategy and investment plan, and build \nlocal capacity for rural WSS development;38 (iii) strengthen project management, monitoring, and \nevaluation, including advisory services for corporate restructuring and PSP and PPP;39 and (iv) \nincrease public awareness of infection prevention measures in the context of COVID-19 and the \nimportance  of  health,  hygiene,  and  sanitation;  as  well  as  awareness  of  the  value  of  water \nconservation. The project will also rehabilitate transmission mains and the distribution network; \nrepair water intakes, pumps, valves, and treatment units; and provide new reservoirs and wells in \nTelavi.40 It will enable 24-hour water supply, improving from the average daily 4-hour water supply \nnow;  achieve  100%  metering  from  40%  now;  increase  the  number  of  household  connections; \nreduce the NRW rate; and improve water supply pressure and energy efficiency. \n \nD. \n \n29. \nThe  overall  program  is  estimated  to  cost  \u20ac136.15  million  ($153.50  million  equivalent) \n(Table 1). ADB will provide a PBL of \u20ac115.31 million ($130 million equivalent) and a project loan \nof  \u20ac17.74  million  ($20  million  equivalent).  The  summary  financing  plan  is  in  Table  2.  The \ngovernment will provide counterpart funding of \u20ac3.10 million ($3.50 million equivalent). Detailed \ncost estimates by expenditure category and by financier for the project are included in the project \nadministration manual (PAM).41 \n \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs, Summary Cost Estimates, and Financing Plan \n\n \n\n37 O&M  improvement  support  includes  an  O&M  road  map  and  action  plan;  a  baseline  survey  and  gap  analysis  of \nUWSCG\u2019s field offices; capacity development, especially in wastewater management; and the financing of related \nmodern equipment. \n\n38 A  rural  WSS  project  component  will  provide  a  sustainable  solution  for  rural  WSS  management  and  operation, \nincluding an institutional framework defining the roles and responsibilities of all key stakeholders in rural WSS; guide \nthe formulation of an investment program; and support capacity building. \n\n39 The ongoing MFF is supporting advisory services for corporate restructuring and PSP and PPP, and the program \n\nwill provide additional support, as required. \n\n40 Telavi is being prioritized for its economic and strategic importance to tourism, agribusinesses, and the wine industry, \nwhich are key contributors to employment and revenue generation. Telavi is listed as a priority city in the Regional \nDevelopment Program of Georgia 2018\u20132021.

The government\u2019s financing requirements are expected \nto be $1.53 billion in 2020, to be financed by domestic and foreign sources. Its foreign borrowing \nwill be $1.41 billion in 2020, mainly from international financial institutions and bilateral partners. \nTotal  ADB  budget  support  in  2020  amounts  to  $530  million,  or  34.6%  of  the  government\u2019s \nfinancing requirements.42 \n  \nPolicy-based  loan.  The  government  has  requested  a  regular  loan  of  \u20ac115.31  million \n31. \n($130 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. The PBL will be disbursed in two \ntranches,  with  actions  in  the  second  tranche  building  on  actions  under  the  first  tranche.  The \ndistribution of the PBL between the two tranches is in line with the government\u2019s development \nfinancing needs in 2020 ($1.53 billion) and 2021 ($0.57 billion). The loan will have a 15-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per \nyear (the interest and other charges during construction to be capitalized in the loan); and such \nother  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement.  Based  on  the  straight-line \nmethod, the average maturity is 9.25 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. \nThe  first  tranche  of  \u20ac70.96  million  ($80  million  equivalent)  will  be  released  upon  loan \neffectiveness.

In addition, \nbudget  support  from  other  development  partners  in  2020  amounts  to  $880  million:  (i)  $205  million  from  Agence \nFran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement, (ii) $100 million from Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, (iii) $95 million from the \nEU, (iv) $100 million from German development cooperation through  KfW, (v) $200 million from the IMF, and (vi) \n$180 million from the World Bank. \n\n \n\n\freleased in 2021, upon full compliance with the conditions of the second tranche. \n \n32. \nProject loan. The government has requested a regular loan of \u20ac17.74 million ($20 million \nequivalent)  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  to  finance  the  project  component  of  the \nprogram.  The  loan  will  have  a  23-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  14  years;  an  annual \ninterest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; a commitment \ncharge of 0.15% per year (the interest and other charges during construction to be capitalized in \nthe loan); and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreements. Based on \nthe  straight-line  method,  the  average  maturity  is  18.75  years,  and  there  is  an  0.20%  maturity \npremium  payable  to  ADB.  ADB  will  finance  civil  works,  goods,  consulting  and  nonconsulting \nservices,  and  related  contingencies  and  financial  charges  during  implementation.  The \ngovernment will finance expenditures related to taxes and duties. \n  \n33. \nClimate finance. Climate change mitigation measures, including the promotion of energy \nefficiency and NRW reduction in the policy and project, are estimated to cost $6.5 million. Climate \nadaptation from four key policy actions is estimated to cost $9.9 million. ADB will finance 100% \nof mitigation and adaptation costs.43 \n \nE. \n \nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \n34. \nthe PAM (footnote 41). The government requested advance action and retroactive financing for \nthe procurement of goods and consulting services.

ADB will be the executing agency for the TA and will \nassist  UWSCG  in  vetting  technology  solutions  for  asset  management;  it  will  also  ensure  its \nfunctional  use  through  capacity  building  and  knowledge  sharing.  The  government  will  provide \ncounterpart support of about $25,000 in the form of staff, office accommodation, supplies, and \nother in-kind contributions.44 \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\nEconomic and Financial Viability \n\n \nA. \n \nThe project is technically viable based on a comprehensive review of UWSCG\u2019s bidding \n36. \ndocument  for  the  Telavi  water  system.  ADB  appraised  the  design  based  on  rationale  and \nrelevance, benefits, and ease of implementation and operations. The technology selected for the \nrehabilitation of the water supply system is appropriate and compatible with local conditions. The \nproject will optimize the implementation timelines through high project readiness. \n \nB. \n \nEconomic analysis. The project is economically viable with an economic internal rate of \n37. \nreturn of 13.6%, above the 9.0% minimum required economic rate of return for ADB investment \nprojects, and an economic net present value of $3.9 million. This mainly reflects the substantial \nbenefits from the project\u2014health benefits from avoided time lost to illness and avoided medical \ntreatment  costs;  and  resource  cost  savings  from  less  time  spent  collecting  water,  lower \ninvestment  and  O&M  costs  for  water  supply,  and  cost  savings  from  a  reduction  in  NRW.  The \neconomic viability is most sensitive to reductions in health benefits and resource costs savings. \nThe  sensitivity  analyses  confirm  that  the  project  is  expected  to  remain  viable  under  various \nadverse  scenarios.  The  economic  impact  from  the  PBL-linked  reforms  is  expected  to  be \nsignificant since UWSCG budget savings may be allocated to more productive activities.45 \n \n38. \n\nFinancial analysis. The project financial internal rate of return is 1.9% and the financial \n\n44 Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n45 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\fSustainability \n\nnet present value, when discounted at the weighted average cost of capital of 0.8%, is $4.3 million. \nWater and wastewater tariffs were assumed to increase in real terms by 50% in 2024 once the \nproject is completed, and thereafter increase by 5% every 3 years. Financial benefits from the \nproject consist of (i) additional revenue as a result of a tariff increase; and (ii) a reduction in NRW, \nwhich  in  turn  enables  UWSCG  to  bill  more  customers  and  save  on  energy  consumption.  The \nfinancial viability remains robust across adverse conditions: a 10% increase in investment costs, \na 10% increase in O&M costs, a 10% decrease in benefits, and a 1-year construction delay. \n \nTariff.  The  current  tariff  is  set  at  GEL0.68  per  cubic  meter  (m3)  (or  $0.22  per  m3).  If \n39. \nUWSCG were to achieve an operating ratio of 1 in 2019 with all other parameters unchanged, the \naverage  tariff  would  have  to  be  increased  to  GEL0.99  per  m3  (or  $0.32  per  m3),  a  one-time \nincrease of 45%. To cover its operational expenditures, including amortization and depreciation, \nand cover debt service obligations, UWSCG requires a tariff of GEL1.95 per m3 (or $0.64 per m3), \nthree times higher than the current one and without any operational enhancement measures. \n \nC. \n \n40. \nThe  project's  sustainability  is  rated  high  given  the  policy  actions  on  asset  and  HR \nmanagement. More efficient O&M and the attached TA in support of innovative water supply asset \nmanagement will lead to the operational and financial sustainability of UWSCG. \n \n41. \nThe sustainability of policy reforms is high, considering the government\u2019s commitment to \nreforms with P3F. The government is also working on various complementary reforms to public \ninvestment management and SOEs, and the regulatory frameworks for PSP and PPP. \n \nD. \n \n42. \nThe pre-mitigation financial management risk is rated moderate. UWSCG has adequate \nfinancial management systems and adopted international standards for accounting and financial \nreporting.  The  2018  Public  Expenditure  and  Financial  Accountability  assessment  report  noted \nstrong and improved country public financial management systems.46 Georgia has successfully \nimplemented the public financial management reform action plan to strengthen fiscal governance, \ntransparency, budget reliability and execution, and external scrutiny and audit.47 \n \nThe  procurement  risk  is  low. 48  A  project  procurement  risk  assessment  and  strategic \n43. \nprocurement  planning  were  undertaken  and  found  that  the  tender  processes  are  aligned  with \ninternational  best  practices  and  considered  to  be  among  the  most  transparent  in  Europe  and \nCentral  Asia. 49  Major  risks  identified  are  the  low  capacity  for  bid  evaluation  and  handling \nconsulting service contracts, and ineffective implementation of projects. The ADB procurement \ncomplaint system will be used to mitigate the risks. \n \n44. \n\nNo  significant  integrity  risks  were  identified. 50  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \n\nGovernance \n\n \n\n46 EU. 2017.

UWSCG  has  implemented \ngender  mainstreaming  activities  under  the  ongoing  MFF,  which  will  be  further  reinforced  and \nexpanded  (footnote  36).  The  program  will  help  (i)  develop  a  gender-sensitive  WSS  policy  to \nincrease  women\u2019s  participation,  employment,  and  technical  participation  in  WSS;  (ii)  boost \nwomen\u2019s representation in decision-making structures; (iii) adopt gender-sensitive HR policies to \ngive  women  opportunities  for  career  advancement,  and protect them from  sexual  harassment, \namong other gender-based concerns; (iv) involve women in all training sessions for UWSCG; and \n(v) formulate a gender-sensitive public communication strategy. \n \nF. \n \n47. \nIn compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), all safeguard documents \nwere prepared based on consultations with affected people and communities, endorsed by the \ngovernment authorities, and disclosed on the ADB website in accordance with ADB\u2019s Access to \nInformation Policy.51 Grievance redress, monitoring, and reporting procedures were agreed with \nUWSCG and specified in all safeguard documents. The project includes adequate resources to \nimplement and monitor mitigation measures. For the PBL, no significant environmental and social \nimpact is anticipated. \n \n48. \nEnvironment (category B). The project is not within or adjacent to any environmentally \nsensitive  areas.
