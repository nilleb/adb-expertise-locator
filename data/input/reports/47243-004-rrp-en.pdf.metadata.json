The \nreport  also  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Institutional  Strengthening  of  the \nBangladesh  Rural  Road  Sector  for  Sustainable  Development,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the \nproposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA.  \n\nThe project will improve the road network connecting the rural population to agriculture \n2. \nvalue chain development zones. Investments will be made to (i) upgrade about 1,700 kilometers \n(km) of rural roads to all-weather standards in 34 districts located in five divisions, (ii) improve the \ncapacity of the rural infrastructure agency to address institutional constraints relating to rural road \ndevelopment, and (iii) finance enhancements to the country\u2019s rural road master plan to enable the \nselection of priority rural roads for improvement using a geographic information system covering \nthe entire country.1   \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n3. \nBangladesh, with a population of about 166 million in 2018 and a land area of 147,570 \nsquare kilometers, is among the most densely populated countries in the world, and one of the \ncountries most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Two-thirds of the country is less than \n5  meters  above  mean  sea  level  and  located  in  the  Ganges\u2013Brahmaputra\u2013Meghna  Delta. \nBangladesh has made steady economic progress over the past 6 years since 2012, with annual \ngross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  exceeding  6%  on  average.  In  July  2015,  Bangladesh \nsurpassed lower-middle income threshold.2 The government\u2019s Seventh Five Year Plan, FY2016\u2013\nFY2020 is crafted to sustain the economic growth momentum, aiming to achieve a growth rate of \nat least 7% on average over the plan period.3 It is on track to meet this target, having achieved \nan  annual  GDP  growth  rate  of  7.1%  in  2016  and  7.3%  in  2017.  Moving  forward,  the  Asian \nDevelopment Outlook report on global economic prospects forecasts that Bangladesh will grow \nat an average of 7.7% over FY2018\u2013FY2019 with strong domestic demand and strengthening \nexports.  The  report  projects  that  investments  will  benefit  from  low  interest  rates and  improved \ninfrastructure.4 \n\n4. \nAbout 80% of the country\u2019s population lives in rural areas and depends on agriculture for \ntheir  livelihood.  The  rural  economy,  through  the  farm  and  nonfarm  sectors,  substantially \ncontributes to the national economy. Agriculture constituted about 15.5% of GDP in 2015, which \nis in the same range as that of South Asia as a whole. Although the share of agriculture in GDP \nhas been declining gradually, the agriculture sector still employs, directly or indirectly, about 50% \nof the workforce and is a major contributor to reducing poverty because of rising wages. Growth \nin agriculture was between 3.0% and 3.5% from 2000 to 2015. The country has achieved near \nself-sufficiency  in  cereal  production  with  a  strong  emphasis  on  rice  production,  which  is  rising \nabove  the  population  growth  rate.  Agriculture  development  is  necessary  to  further  reduce  the \nreliance on imported food and other agricultural products, which absorbs 29% of export earnings. \nThe  Seventh  Five  Year  Plan,  FY2016\u2013FY2020  focuses  on  increasing  rural  incomes  and \nagriculture\u2019s  contribution  to  economic  development  by  (i)  maintaining  self-sufficiency  in  cereal \nproduction,  (ii)  diversifying  and  improving  the  quality  of  crops,  (iii)  increasing  productivity,  and \n                                                 \n1   Chattogram, Dhaka, Khulna, Rajshahi, and Rangpur divisions.  \n2   World Bank.

Asian Development Outlook 2018 Update\u2014Maintaining Stability Amid Heightened Uncertainty. Manila. \n\n\f(iv) promoting  agribusiness.  Bangladesh\u2019s  major  agricultural  challenges  include  (i)  the  lack  of \nmodern production technologies, (ii) inadequate food quality, (iii) weak value chains, and (iv) food \ninsecurity.  Insufficient  rural  transport,  inadequate  market  infrastructure,  and  the  impacts  of \nintensifying  floods  and  cyclones  related  to  climate  change  are  major  constraints  to  agriculture \ndevelopment.  Accordingly,  the  plan  has  put  forward  specific  strategies  to  overcome  these \nchallenges and constraints. \n\nto  generating \n\nincreased  agricultural \n\n5. \nRural connectivity underpins rural development in Bangladesh. Roads are the dominant \nmode of transportation, utilized by over 70% of passengers and 60% of freight traffic. Rural roads \ncontribute  significantly \nincomes  and  employment \nopportunities while providing access to economic and social services to the entire rural population. \nThe road network of Bangladesh consists of (i) highways and district roads owned and maintained \nby the Roads and Highways Department, and (ii) rural roads owned and maintained by the Local \nGovernment Engineering Department (LGED). Bangladesh\u2019s total road network spans 374,245 \nkm,  of  which  352,943  km  (94%)  are  rural  roads.  Many  of  these  rural  roads  were  constructed \nduring 1990\u20132010 on earthen embankments. Since 1995, the government, with support from the \ninternational development community, has been expanding and improving the rural road network. \nHowever, rural connectivity in Bangladesh remains unfinished, impeding physical and economic \naccess. Only about 40% of the rural population has access to all-weather roads, and these roads \nmake up only 28% of the total length of rural roads in the country. \n\n6. \nThe Seventh Five Year Plan, FY2016\u2013FY2020 aims to expand the rural road capacity to \nincrease connectivity, provide greater access to social services and markets, and promote the \nagriculture sector. The government\u2019s agricultural strategy under the plan also intends to increase \nagricultural  productivity,  encourage  commercial  agriculture  and  agribusiness  development, \nincrease employment opportunities for rural poor people, and reduce the poverty level. Guided \nby the plan, the government has embarked on a sustained effort to improve the country\u2019s rural \nroad  network,  using  its  own  resources  and  with  assistance  from  its  international  development \npartners. The government has proposed to increase the percentage of rural roads classified as \ngood from 43% in 2016 to 80% in 2020.5 The project will support this plan by improving about \n1,700 km of rural roads to all-weather standards, serving the agriculture sector and 51.5 million \nrural  people  living  in  34  districts  in  five  divisions.  These  roads  are  critical  for  supporting  the \ncountry\u2019s agriculture value chain development zones. All the project-financed rural roads have \nbeen selected from the rural road master plan through robust selection criteria, and have been \nassessed  as  priority.  The  selection  criteria  took  into  consideration  the  population  size,  each \ndistrict\u2019s agricultural potential, the number of agricultural farms and commercial establishments, \neconomic  potential,  access  to  education  facilities,  and  flood-damaged  roads.  In  response  to  a \nrequest from the government on 3 October 2017, roads that were damaged by flashfloods in 2017 \nwill be prioritized.6 While the government resources for rural road improvement is increasing, the \nfunding gap is still large. It is therefore important to develop a system of road prioritization for an \noptimized rural road network planning. The project will support enhancements to the rural road \nmaster plan.7  \n\n7. \nThe  project  will  also  support  the  government\u2019s  commitment  in  the  2017  Vientiane \nDeclaration  on  Sustainable  Rural  Transport  to  promote  inclusive,  affordable,  accessible,  and \n\n                                                 \n5   Good roads comprise both all-weather (paved) and gravel roads. \n6   In 2017, successive heavy rains triggered flashfloods that damaged about 7,000 km of rural roads.  \n7   Under the ongoing ADB-funded TA Bangladesh: Updating the Road Master Plan, the government is updating the \nroad  master  plan  to  cover  highways  and  rural  roads.  The  proposed  project  will  build  on  this  output,  focusing  on \ndeveloping a comprehensive rural road master plan using a geographic information system for road prioritization. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nsustainable rural transport infrastructure and services.8 It is aligned with the country partnership \nstrategy  for  Bangladesh,  2016\u20132020  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  that  intends  to \npromote all-weather access to markets and agribusiness logistics.9 The project is also included \nin the country operations business plan, 2018\u20132020 for Bangladesh.10 \n\n8. \nValue added by ADB assistance. The project builds on the experience and success of \nADB-supported  rural  road  programs  in  India,  Nepal,  and  Sri  Lanka,  which  highlighted  the \nimportance  of  (i)  strengthening  institutional  capacity,  (ii)  designing  rural  roads  to  all-weather \nstandards with climate-resilient and safety features, (iii) using high-level technology to enhance \nroad master planning, and (iv) improving road maintenance.11 The project roads will adopt climate \nresilient  designs  for  (i)  road  elevations  and  cross  and  side  drainage,  (ii)  road  bases  and \npavements,  (iii)  earthworks  and  compaction,  and  (iv)  quality  control.  This  project  will  utilize \n(i) slope protection using bioengineering approaches, (ii) rigid pavements of reinforced concrete \nat  submersible  road  sections  leading  to  cyclone  shelters,  and  (iii)  adequate  cross  and  side \ndrainage. These measures will significantly reduce the ensuing burden of maintaining roads. In \naddition,  civil  works  contracts  for  the  project  roads  will  include  a  provision  for  post-completion \nmaintenance for 5 years to assess the efficacy of adopting long-term maintenance by the private \nsector in Bangladesh and to encourage its use, where appropriate. The possible benefits of long-\nterm maintenance include better life cycle quality assurance and greater operational efficiency, \nwhich can further justify budget allocation for rural road maintenance.  \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n9. \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: connectivity between rural communities, \nproductive agricultural areas, and socioeconomic centers in Bangladesh improved (footnote 3). \nThe  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:  transport  efficiency  and  related  employment \ngenerated in target areas increased.12 \n\nC. \n\nOutputs  \n\n10. \nOutput  1:  Rural  road  conditions  between  selected  rural  communities,  productive \nagricultural areas, and socioeconomic centers improved. The condition of about 1,700 km of \nrural  roads  among  the  selected  rural  communities,  productive  agricultural  areas,  and \nsocioeconomic  centers  will  be  improved  to  all-weather  standards  with  climate  resilience  and \nsafety features.13 The roads will also be covered under contractual maintenance for 5 years after \n\n                                                 \n8   United  Nations  Centre  for  Regional  Development.  2017.

Capacity development will involve (i) training LGED on road asset management, road \nsafety,  contract  management,  financial  management,  and  climate-resilient  road  design  and \nconstruction;  (ii)  improving  awareness  of  road  users  on  road  safety,  human  trafficking,  and \nsexually  transmitted  infection  prevention;  and  (iii)  enhancing  women  workers\u2019  skills  on  road \nconstruction and maintenance. \n\n12. \nOutput 3: Rural road master planning enhanced. The rural road master plan will be \nupgraded  for  the  entire  country  using  a  geographic  information  system  that  includes  the \nidentification  of  agricultural  value  chains,  road  conditions,  and  mechanisms  for  prioritization \napplication. This will help to optimize the use of available resources for effective rural road network \nplanning and improvement to support the growth of farm and nonfarm economies in rural areas. \n\nD. \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $285.3  million  (Table  1).

The economic analysis was carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects. 21 The  principal  benefits  considered  in  the \nanalysis  are  transport  cost  savings  for  vehicle  operating  costs  and  travel  time  savings  for  the \nexisting  and  incremental  flow  of  people  and  goods  over  the  analysis  period.  The  economic \nanalysis indicated that the project is economically viable overall, with an economic internal rate of \nreturn of 18.3% and with all individual road packages having an economic internal rate of return \nabove  the  acceptable  rate  of  9.0%.  Sensitivity  analysis  indicated  that  with  a  10%  increase  in \ncapital costs or a 10% decrease in benefits, the overall investment remains economically viable.  \n\n22. \nFinancial sustainability. LGED is primarily responsible for the maintenance of the rural \nroad network. LGED\u2019s budget allocation for rural road maintenance has been increasing by 15.6% \nper year on average since 2013, from about $95 million in 2012\u20132013 to $185 million in 2017\u2013\n2018.  LGED  has  a  well-established  maintenance  planning  and  budget  allocation  system. \nHowever, only about 20% of the estimated requirement for rehabilitation and maintenance of all \nroads  is  allocated  in  LGED\u2019s  budget  for  each  year.  Most  rural  roads  were  constructed  during \n1990\u20132010. Because of a shortage of funds, there is a significant backlog in maintenance works \nfor  rural  roads.  To  address  this,  the  government  launched  the  Rural  Roads  and  Bridge \nMaintenance Policy in 2013. The policy commits the government to fund road maintenance on an \nincremental  basis.  The  government  has  also  recently  introduced  a  Medium-Term  Expenditure \nFramework  Statement  and  the  concept  of  3-year  rolling  targets  for  expenditure  indicators  to \nprovide greater certainty for multiyear budgeting and the predictability of resources for prioritized \nschemes. \n\n23. \nADB\u2019s work on improving the roads will further reduce the backlog. Other development \npartners such as the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom, the Japan \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency,  and  the  World  Bank  are  also  funding  similar  interventions. \nTogether  they  will  help  sustain  rural  road  maintenance  and  prevent  the  roads  from  going  into \ndisrepair and incurring more costly reconstruction. The project will include pilot maintenance in \ncivil  works  contracts  for  5  years  in  five  districts  to  encourage  LGED  to  adopt  maintenance \ncontracts in future projects to ensure better asset quality and improved maintenance. The project \nwill also strengthen the maintenance planning and asset management through the attached TA. \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n24. \nInstitutional.  LGED,  under  the  Ministry  of  Local  Government,  Rural  Development  and \nCooperatives, is responsible for assisting local governments in the districts with civil engineering \naspects,  including  construction.  Its  mandate  includes  planning  rural  roads,  irrigation,  and  river \ncontrol and constructing bridges, houses, and buildings under the ministry in coordination with \nlocal authorities. LGED is headed by a chief engineer who reports to the secretary of the ministry. \nLGED is experienced in implementing projects funded by development partners such as ADB, \nthe Japan International Cooperation Agency, and the World Bank. \n\nFinancial  management.  The  financial  management  risk  is  moderate.  LGED  has \n25. \nimplemented  28  ADB  projects,  and  7  projects  are  ongoing.  The  department  has  a  dedicated \nfinance  section  with  sufficient  staff  and  adequate  capacity  in  financial  accounting  and  ADB \ndisbursement procedures. However, as project implementation is widely spread to district offices, \na  new  fund  flow  and  monitoring  scheme  will  be  adopted  to  address  potential  risks  of  fund \nmismanagement in the districts. In addition, mitigation measures will be implemented in other risk \n\n                                                 \n21  ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.

A full-time financial management expert will \nbe engaged to assist the capacity building of LGED. \n\n26. \nProcurement  and  anticorruption.  Procurement  will  be  in  accordance  with  the  ADB \nProcurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and the Procurement Regulations for \nADB  Borrowers  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  assessment  of  the  procurement \ncapacity of LGED concluded that it has the capacity to undertake procurement activities under \nthe  project.  The  government  will  publish  project  information  on  LGED\u2019s  website,  including \nbusiness opportunities associated with the project. In October 2012, a National Integrity Strategy \nwas approved and a National Integrity Advisory Committee was formed\u2014chaired by the Prime \nMinister\u2014to  oversee \nthe  strategy.  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the \ngovernment. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the \nproject administration manual (footnote 15). \n\nthe  anticorruption  activities  and \n\nimplement \n\nD. \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n27. \nPoverty reduction and social impact. The project covers 34 districts with a population \nof 51.5 million. Household surveys carried out in the project area reveal that the major income \nsources  are  agricultural  produce,  trade  and  business,  services,  and  overseas  workers\u2019 \nremittances.  Poverty  and  social  assessments  have  been  conducted,  consulting  about  7,835 \npeople living in the project area. The beneficiaries indicated that the project will increase economic \nand employment opportunities. The project will generate an estimated 3.13 million person-days \nof employment over the construction and maintenance periods. \n\nGender.  The  poverty  and  social  analysis  included  a  gender  assessment,  with  2,418 \n28. \nwomen consulted in the project area. Overall, women were supportive of the project because it \nwill give them potential access to economic opportunities and services. The project is categorized \neffective gender mainstreaming. The prepared gender action plan includes the following activities: \n(i) target at least 40% of women participants in project orientation seminars and in the planning \nof project roads; (ii) target at least 20% of women workers to be employed in road improvement \nworks;  (iii)  conduct  awareness  training  on  gender-based  violence,  human  trafficking,  and  the \nprevention of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV, to at least 40% of students, \nteachers, parents, and school management committees along the project roads; (iv) implement \ncore  labor  standards  with  gender-inclusive  provisions  and  women-friendly  work  environments; \nand (v) conduct road safety awareness programs to at least 40% of students, teachers, parents, \nand  school  management  committees  along  the  project  roads.  Gender  experts  will  be  hired  to \nensure effective implementation of the gender action plan. \n\n29. \nSexually transmitted infections and human trafficking. The proportion of the project \nthat requires large and non-local construction workforce is low. Therefore, the risk of spreading \ncommunicable  diseases,  including  STIs,  is  low.  LGED  will  ensure  that  civil  work  contractors \ndisseminate information at worksites on the risks of STIs. The civil work contractors will carry out \nawareness sessions, which national gender experts will monitor, on STIs and human trafficking \nfor their laborers at worksites. \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n30. \ncategories are as follows.22 \n\n                                                 \n22  ADB. Safeguard Categories.  \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nEnvironment  (category  B).  Impacts  from  all  216  roads  were  screened  and  assessed \n31. \nusing an environmental checklist developed in similar projects (footnote 11) and adapted to local \nconditions and road designs.23 From these environmental checklists, a single initial environmental \nexamination report was prepared in line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. All 216 project \nroads exist, and no by-passes or land acquisitions are anticipated. Most of the negative impacts \nare coterminous with the construction stage, site-specific, limited within the construction corridor, \nand easily mitigated. The anticipated environmental impacts include the generation of dust, noise, \nexhausts from haul trucks and hot mix plants; waste from construction and worker camps; water \ncontamination;  and  occupational  health  and  safety  hazards.  Mitigation  measures  for  all \nanticipated impacts have been developed and integrated into construction works by incorporating \na standard environmental management plan in the bidding documents and providing road-specific \nenvironmental  management  plans  in  the  detailed  project  reports.  An  integrated  social  and \nenvironmental  grievance  redress  mechanism  has  been  formed  to  continue  receiving  feedback \nand complaints from affected parties and addressing them during the construction and operation \nstages. The initial environmental examination was disclosed on the ADB and LGED websites. \n\n Involuntary resettlement (category C). The construction will be carried out mostly within \n32. \nexisting  road  corridors  and  rights-of-way,  with  minor  widening  for  road  safety  in  some  cases, \nwhich will require narrow strips of land (less than 5% of total holdings) to be made available. Due \ndiligence identified no major impacts to land and no displacement of structures, private trees, or \ncommunity resource properties. A grievance redress mechanism will be set up in all project areas. \nVoluntary land donation may be used when land is required. Specific procedural requirements for \nland donation, involving comprehensive consultations with the communities, have been included \nin the community participation framework,24 which was developed in similar projects (footnote 11). \nThe government will ensure that land donation is carried out without coercion and documented in \na  transparent  manner  and  will  have  the  process  verified  by  an  independent  monitor.  The \ncommunity participation framework was disclosed on the ADB website and includes a mitigation \nmeasures  matrix,  which  details  the  type  of  support  provided  for  all  types  of  losses,  including \nspecial  assistance  for  vulnerable  households.  Social  safeguards  experts  will  be  engaged  to \ncontinue community consultations during implementation, redress grievances, and monitor social \nsafeguards. \n\nIndigenous peoples (category C). The project will improve existing road corridors and \n33. \nrights-of-way, so it will have no impact on culture, human rights, or livelihood systems. The social \nassessment did not identify the presence of tribes, minor races, ethnic sects and communities in \nany of the project roads. \n\nF. \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \n\n34. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.25 \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nWeak decentralized financial \nmanagement \n\nMitigating Measures \nA new fund flow scheme will be implemented to ensure compliance with \nADB\u2019s disbursement policy; the project management unit will monitor \ncompliance periodically.
