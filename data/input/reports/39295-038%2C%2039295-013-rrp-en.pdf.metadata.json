The additional financing will expand the \ncurrent  project,  which  is  performing  well,  by  supporting  (i)  additional  priority  infrastructure  and \ngovernance improvements in pourashavas covered by the current project, and (ii) infrastructure \nand governance improvements in five more pourashavas.3 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n \nA. \n\nRationale \n \n3. \nUrban  development  challenges  of  pourashavas.  While  Bangladesh\u2019s  economy \ncontinues to grow at a healthy pace,4 the government needs to focus on achieving sustainable \nand inclusive growth while addressing the challenges of rapid urbanization. In 2015, only 32% of \nthe  urban  population  had  piped  water  supply  and  58%  of  the  urban  population  had  access  to \nimproved  sanitation  facilities. 5  Although  sanitation  coverage  is  improving,  fecal  sludge \nmanagement remains a major challenge, especially in urban slums. Drainage is underdeveloped \nand  poorly  maintained,  resulting  in  frequent  water  logging.  Many  urban  roads  are  dilapidated \nbecause of increasing traffic and lack of maintenance. Solid waste management is not systematic, \nand  open  dumping  creates  public  health  risks.  The  urban  challenges  are  even  more  acute  in \npourashavas  because  of  inadequate  governance,  capacity  constraints,  lack  of  community \nparticipation,  and  sustainable  infrastructure  deficiencies.6 The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nhas supported infrastructure and governance improvement in pourashavas through the first and \nsecond  Urban  Governance  and  Infrastructure  Improvement  (Sector)  Projects. 7  Although \nimprovements have been made through these earlier projects, pourashavas still need significant \ninvestment to enhance municipal infrastructure service delivery, strengthen urban climate change \nresilience, and reduce regional disparities across the country.  \n \n4. \nPerformance-based  incentives  for  governance  improvement.  With  limited  but \neffective incentives for pourashavas to improve their governance, the first project introduced a \nperformance-based fund allocation strategy through the Urban Governance Improvement Action \n\n                                                \n1  ADB. 2014. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the People\u2019s \nRepublic of Bangladesh for the Third Urban Governance and Infrastructure Improvement (Sector) Project. Manila. \n2  Bangladesh defines pourashavas per the level of own-source annual revenues, with class A being the highest. As of \n\nJune 2017, the country has 328 pourashavas (class A: 162, class B: 106, and class C: 60). \n\n3  Project preparation and due diligence was done under the current project loan and a technical assistance grant by \nthe Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund under ADB\u2019s Urban Financing Partnership Facility. (ADB. 2015. \nTechnical Assistance for Promoting Urban Climate Change Resilience in Selected Asian Cities. Manila). \n\n4  Country Economic Indicators (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n5  World Health Organization. 2015. Progress on Drinking Water and Sanitation: 2015 Update. New York. \n6  Sector Assessment (Summary): Water and Other Urban Infrastructure and Services (accessible from the list of linked \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n7  The first project (2003\u20132010) provided a loan of $65 million to support 27 pourashavas. The second project (2008\u2013\n2016) provided a loan of $87 million and cofinancing of $40.8 million equivalent to support  51 pourashavas. Major \ninfrastructure achievements under both projects include rehabilitation or new construction of 1,665 kilometers (km) \nof urban roads, 424 km of drains, 44 km of piped water supply, 7 solid waste disposal sites, and 82 municipal facilities. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nProgram  (UGIAP),  effectively  supporting  governance  reforms. 8  This  shaped  the  Local \nGovernment (Pourashava) Act (2009) and other urban development projects supported by ADB \nand  development  partners. 9  Under  the  first  and  second  projects,  targeted  pourashavas \nsignificantly  improved  their  governance  performance  while  receiving  investments  to  meet  their \ninfrastructure needs.10 Major project governance achievements included (i) the establishment of \ntown  coordination  and  ward  committees,  supporting  citizens\u2019  participation, \nincluding \nrepresentation of women and the poor; (ii) the development and implementation of gender action \nplans  (GAPs)  for  pourashavas;  (iii)  computerization  of  tax  and  accounting  records;  and  (iv) \nincreased local revenue generation.11 \n \n5. \nStrengthening urban climate resilience. Climate change is a critical development issue \nfor Bangladesh. Major climate risks for pourashavas include rising temperature, higher intensity \nand frequency of rainfall and wind loads, storm surges, and riverine flooding. Rising sea levels \nmay affect pourashavas in coastal zones and intrude inland, increasing the salinization of both \ngroundwater and surface water. Pourashavas will need to enhance their institutional abilities to \nsustain operation and maintenance (O&M) of infrastructure and services, specifically increasing \nthe resilience of poor and vulnerable people. \n \n6. \nLessons  learned.  Lessons  from  earlier  projects  suggest  that  (i)  governance-led \ninfrastructure  improvement  has  worked  well,  (ii)  the  use  of  a  sector  lending  modality 12  is \nappropriate  for  a  multicomponent  project  with  performance-based  fund  allocations  through  a \nphased approach, and (iii) good quality and front-loaded capacity building and strong institutional \nsupport  is  required  for  pourashavas. 13  Thus,  the  overall  project  (current  project  including \nadditional financing) adopts the sector lending modality.14 Capacity building support was provided \nduring project preparation and continues during implementation. \n \nCurrent  project  design.  The  current  project 15  supports  pourashavas  through  two \n7. \nschemes.  The  first  scheme,  called  window  A,  provides  infrastructure  funds  and  capacity \ndevelopment support for governance improvement in 30 pourashavas with a total population of \n2.2 million. The support is provided in three phases based on compliance with UGIAP criteria.16 \n\n                                                \n8   The  UGIAP  for  the  current  project  covers  (i)  citizen  awareness  and  participation,  (ii)  urban  planning,  (iii)  gender \nequality  and  social  inclusion,  (iv)  local  resource  mobilization,  (v)  financial  management  and  accountability,  (vi) \nadministrative transparency, and (vii) keeping essential pourashava services functional. \n\n9  ADB:  Secondary  Towns  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector  Project  (Bangladesh),  and  Local  Governance \nEnhancement Sector Project (Sri Lanka); World Bank: Municipal Governance and Services Project (Bangladesh); \nJapan  International  Cooperation  Agency:  Inclusive  Governance  Project  (Bangladesh).

Validation Report: Urban Governance and Infrastructure Improvement (Sector) Project in Bangladesh. \n\nManila. Overall validation rating is successful. \n\n14 Sector Development Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15  Loan 3142-BAN (footnote 1), an Asian Development Fund loan of $125 million equivalent (now concessional loan \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources as of 1 January 2017), approved by the ADB Board on 17 July 2014, became \neffective on 4 November 2014; Loan 8285(OFID) for $40 million from the OPEC Fund for International Development \n(OFID) became effective on 9 April 2015. ADB administers procurement and disbursement under the OFID loan. \n16 With fulfillment of entry criteria by all 30 window A pourashavas, priority subprojects have been supported (phase 1). \nBased on substantial progress of such investments and compliance with intermediate criteria, additional subprojects \nare being implemented (phase 2) in all window A pourashavas. Meeting the advanced criteria and progress on the \n\n\fThe second scheme, called window B, allocates funds based on well-defined performance criteria \non a competitive basis to all remaining pourashavas in the country. Funding of up to $2 million for \ninfrastructure improvement will be provided to each of the top 20 pourashavas in the governance \nassessment, which will be conducted twice during implementation.17 \n \n8. \nDemand for expanding the current project\u2019s successful model. In the government\u2019s \nSeventh Five-Year Plan, urban development is a national priority to reduce urban poverty and \nimprove  living  conditions  through  better  city  governance  and  service. 18 Given  the  successful \nperformance  of  the  current  project  and  the  government\u2019s  request  to  include  five  additional \npourashavas  under  window  A,19 additional  financing  of  $200  million  was  included  in  the  latest \ncountry operations business plan.20 \n \nThe proposed additional financing will cover (i) the shortfall from the underestimation of \n9. \nthe investment requirements under the current project21 to enable the continued financing of (a) \npriority infrastructure and governance improvements in 30 window A pourashavas, and climate \nand  disaster  resilience  aspects22 under  output  1;  and  (b)  infrastructure  support  for  qualifying \nwindow  B  pourashavas  under  output  2;  and  (ii)  the  scaling  up  of  the  current  project  by  (a) \nsupporting additional activities under output 1 and (b) adding five window A pourashavas. \n \n10. \nAdditional financing eligibility criteria. The additional financing meets ADB\u2019s eligibility \ncriteria.23 The overall project (i) remains technically feasible, economically viable, and financially \nsound;  (ii)  is  accorded  high  priority  by  the  government;  and  (iii)  is  consistent  with  the  current \nproject\u2019s  development  objectives,  the  government\u2019s  priorities,  and  the  country  partnership \nstrategy,  which  prioritizes  inclusive  and  environmentally  sustainable  growth,  governance \nimprovement, and climate- and disaster-resilient infrastructure and services. The current project \nhas been rated on track since it started, and implementation progress and results are satisfactory. \nAs of 15 June 2017, with 45% of project time elapsed, contracts worth $94.55 million (84% of \nLoan  3142-BAN)  and  disbursement  of  $50.38  million  (45%  of  Loan  3142-BAN)  had  been \nachieved. Overall physical progress stands at 54% overall. 24 The current project  has complied \nwith  safeguard  requirements  and  adequately  managed  risks.  Project  readiness  for  additional \nfinancing is high. The overall project will contribute to Sustainable Development Goal 1125 and is \nin line with ADB\u2019s urban operational plan.26 \n \n                                                \n\nearlier phases 1 and 2 subprojects will make window A pourashavas eligible for investment support in phase 3. As \nallocations  of  less  than  $3  million  per  pourashava  for  infrastructure  improvement  under  earlier  projects  was \ninadequate to meet the demand, window A pourashavas will receive more substantial investment under the overall \nproject, depending upon need and absorption capacity. \n\n17 For window B, a  separate set of  UGIAP criteria using objective and measurable governance indicators has been \nprepared. Based on the first assessment in August 2016, the top 20 pourashavas selected are receiving infrastructure \ninvestment assistance under the current project. \n\n18 Government of Bangladesh, Planning Commission. 2015.

Country Operations Business Plan: Bangladesh, 2017\u20132020. Manila. \n21 The design of the current project envisaged additional financing. Additional financing is even more critical as all 30 \n\nwindow A pourashavas have performed well, meeting the intermediate criteria for phase 2. \n\n22 Project preparation, which followed an  integrated, consultative process to mainstream climate change  adaptation \nand mitigation in pourashavas included (i) climate risk and vulnerability assessments for wards; (ii) updates of urban \nmaster  plans,  incorporating  climate  and  disaster  risks  and  priority  interventions;  (iii)  capacity  building;  and  (iv) \nfeasibility studies for priority subprojects, including climate-responsive engineering designs. \n\n23 ADB. 2011.

The outcome will be municipal service \ndelivery and urban governance in project towns improved.27 The current and aggregated outcome \ntargets as a result of the additional financing are in the revised design and monitoring framework \nin Appendix 1. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n \nBased on the reasons for the proposed additional financing (para 9.), the outputs of the \n\n12. \noverall project will be as described in paras. 13\u201314.28  \n \n13. \nOutput  1:  Municipal  infrastructure  improved  and  made  gender  and  climate \nresponsive.  The  overall  project  will  provide  the  following:  (i)  600  kilometers  (km)  of  roads \nimproved or rehabilitated; (ii) 300 km of drains built or improved; (iii) 180 km of pipes installed or \nupgraded  for  water  supply  with  60,000  individual  meters;  (iv)  slum  improvement  subprojects \ncompleted  in  all  project  towns  with  slums;  (v)  sludge  management  facilities  built  in  14  project \ntowns; (vi) solid waste disposal sites built or improved in 20 project towns (total capacity 200 tons \nper  day);  (vii)  climate  issues  considered  in  designing  80%  of  subprojects  and  incorporated,  if \nnecessary; and (viii) about 15,000 tons per year of carbon dioxide emissions reduced.29 \n \n14. \nOutput 2: Capacity of pourashavas in urban service delivery, planning, and financial \nmanagement improved. The overall project will provide the following: (i) town coordination and \nward committees formed in 35 project towns; (ii) urban master plans developed through gender-\ninclusive processes gazetted in 35 project towns; (iii) standing committees on woman and children \naffairs, poverty reduction, and slum improvement (with 40% women participation) operationalized \nin 35 project towns; (iv) pourashava development plans, GAPs, and poverty reduction action plans \n(PRAPs) approved in 35 project towns; (v) annual O&M plans approved and budget allocated for \nimplementation  in  35  project  towns;  (vi)  computerized  tax  records  and  billing  systems  made \nfunctional  in  35  project  towns;  and  (vii)  top-performing  pourashavas  under  window  B  awarded \nsubproject funding. \n \nSubproject selection criteria. Although selection of subprojects will generally follow the \n15. \npriorities set by each pourashava, the overall project will focus on key infrastructure such as roads, \ndrainage, water supply, and sanitation, including septic tank sludge management, solid waste and \nfecal sludge management, and slum improvements. Other municipal facilities such as markets \nand  bus  terminals  will  be  supported  if  sustainable  O&M  arrangements  are  clearly  established. \nSubprojects in each phase will be stand-alone to avoid the risk of pourashavas not proceeding to \nthe next phase because of poor governance. \n \nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n \n16. \nThe  overall  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $504.1  million,  including  additional  financing  of \n$200.0 million from ADB (Table 1).

Interest during construction for a concessional OCR loan has been computed \nat 2.0% per year.  \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n17. \nThe government has requested a regular loan of $100 million and a concessional loan of \n$100 million, both from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, to help finance the project. The regular \nloan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years;  an  annual  interest  rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe draft loan agreement. Based on the straight-line method, the average maturity is 15.25 years, \nand the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.10% per year.31 The concessional loan will have a \n25-year term, including a grace period  of 5 years; an interest rate of 2.0% per  year during the \ngrace  period  and  thereafter;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan \nagreement. \n \n18. \nThe financing plan is in Table 2. Part of the loan proceeds will be on-lent to pourashavas. \nRevenue-generating  subprojects,  including  water  supply,  bus  terminals,  and  markets,  will  be \nfinanced by a combination of grants and loans, with a grant\u2013loan ratio satisfactory to ADB.

The  same  approach  will  be  followed  for  future  subproject \ndesign in accordance with subproject selection and design criteria, considering climate change, \nextreme  weather,  and  natural  hazards  (footnote  30).  Subprojects  will  be  technically  and \noperationally most appropriate, sustainable and least-cost, and designed based on whole-of-life \nanalysis.33 Engineering designs will take into consideration the impact of climate change (flooding \nand waterlogging and, where relevant, increased salinity and wind loads) on vulnerable people \nand infrastructure systems and services.34 \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n21. \nEconomic  analysis.  The  expected  economic  benefits  are  mainly  (i)  reduced  vehicle \noperating costs and travel time savings; (ii) reduced property damage and loss of income from \nflooding;  and  (iii)  improved  health  and  resource  savings  with  getting  water  from  piped  supply. \nResults  of  economic  and  sensitivity  analyses  confirm  that  two  sample  subprojects  are \neconomically viable, as base economic internal rates of return are 18.2% and 19.5%, respectively, \nwhich are above the economic opportunity cost of capital of 9.0%. Sensitivity analysis results are \nsatisfactory  unless  all  downside  risks  are  combined. 35  Subprojects  to  be  prepared  during \nimplementation will need to meet the economic and financial criteria in the PAM (footnote 30). \n \n22. \nFinancial analysis. A financial analysis was conducted for two sample subprojects with \na cost recovery objective by estimating the incremental costs and revenues over the project life.36 \nThe financial internal rates of return were estimated at 4.2% for the water supply subproject and \n4.4% for the market development subproject, higher than the weighted average cost of capital of \n1.9%,  indicating sufficient financial  returns.  For subprojects that  will  not generate  revenue, the \nanalysis  focused  on  the  pourashava\u2019s  financial  capacity  to  meet  incremental  costs  of  the \nsubprojects.  The  overall  municipal  financial  position  was  projected,  reflecting  incremental \nrevenues and expenditures and debt service. The projection confirmed that the sample subproject \n\n                                                \n33 Refers to the total cost of ownership over the life of an asset. \n34 Project  Climate  Risk  Assessment  and  Management  Reporting  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n35 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n36 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\npourashavas would have adequate financial capacity to meet incremental O&M costs and other \nrequirements to sustain infrastructure and service delivery for the subprojects. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n \n23. \nThe  executing  and  implementing  agencies  were  assessed  on  ADB\u2019s  procurement  and \nfinancial  management  requirements.37 Procurement  contracts  financed  by  ADB  are  subject  to \nADB\u2019s review and include provisions specifying the right of ADB  to audit and examine records \nand  accounts  of  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the additional financing. \n \n24. \nThe financial management risk rating is moderate. An assessment of LGED, DPHE, and \nthe pourashavas indicated that, with support of a dedicated financial management consultant in \nthe project management unit (PMU) and a dedicated accountant in each project implementation \nunit  (PIU),  financial  management  capabilities  and  implementation  support  will  be  adequately \nstrengthened.38 The procurement risk assessment rating is low.39 The LGED has experience in \nprocuring  goods,  works,  and  consulting  services  in  accordance  with  ADB  procedures  and \nrequirements.  The  PMU  and  loan-funded  specialists  will  support  the  PIUs  in  preparing  and \nevaluating  bid  documents.  This  will  be  supplemented  by  regular  training  on  procurement  and \naccounting  for  the  PIUs  and  other  staff.  Other  measures  to  ensure  transparency  include  the \npresentation of procurement information at public meetings to supplement online disclosure. \n \n25. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM (footnote 30). \n \nD. \n \n26.  Men and women, including the poor living in the pourashavas, will benefit from the overall \nproject,  which  is  classified  as  having  a  gender  equity  theme. 40  The  project  will  enhance \ninclusiveness of poor and marginalized groups in municipal decision making by (i) ensuring their \nsufficient representation on town coordination and ward committees; (ii) having each pourashava \nprepare a PRAP and GAP;41 (iii) forming poverty-reduction and slum-improvement committees; \n(iv) improving infrastructure and basic services in slums; and (v) upgrading health, hygiene, and \nthe  environment  through  a  targeted  project  awareness-raising  program.  The  design  of \ninfrastructure  improvements  will  consider  women\u2019s  needs.  Women\u2019s  decision-making  capacity \nand  the  focus  of  services  and  infrastructure  on  women  will  be  enhanced.  Implementation  of \nPRAPs  and  GAPs,  including  the  pourashavas\u2019  budget  allocation,  will  be  monitored.  With  the \nadditional financing, the GAP activities in pourashavas that are included under the current project \nwill be continued, and the five new pourashavas will follow the same gender design as under the \ncurrent project. Adequate resources are allocated for implementation and monitoring. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n                                                \n37 ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly, or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or \n\ncoercive practices relating to the project. \n\n38 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n39 Procurement Risk Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n40 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible form the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n41 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fE. \n\nSafeguards \n \nSafeguards  compliance.  The  current  project\u2019s  compliance  with \n\n27. \nthe  safeguard \nrequirements  has  been  satisfactory  and  risks  have  been  well-managed. 42  A  project-specific \ngrievance redress mechanism has been established and is functional. A corrective action plan \nwas prepared and is being implemented for one reported complaint. \n \n28. \nEnvironmental  and  social  safeguards.  The  project  remains  category  B  for  the \nenvironment and involuntary resettlement, and category C for indigenous peoples. The additional \nfinancing  will  have  no  significant  impacts  on  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and \nindigenous peoples, as subprojects with significant impacts will be excluded in accordance with \nsubproject  selection  criteria. 43  The  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework, \nresettlement framework, and indigenous peoples planning framework of the current project were \nupdated. 44  Five  draft  initial  environmental  examinations,  prepared  for  representative  sample \nsubprojects, confirmed no significant environmental impacts.45 Subprojects are generally small, \nsites  are  outside  sensitive  areas,  and  any  impact  during  construction  and  operation  can  be \navoided or mitigated through proper design, high-quality construction, and O&M practices. Initial \nenvironmental examinations will be part of the bidding and contract documents. No permanent \ninvoluntary land acquisition or physical displacement is identified for sample subprojects in two \npourashavas. 46 Four  acres  of  land  from  five  landowners  will  be  obtained  through  negotiated \nsettlement.47 For the sample road and drainage subprojects, 53 shop owners and/or households \nare expected to temporarily lose access to government lands for economic activities or residence. \nNo  impacts  on  indigenous  people\u2019s  communities  were  identified  in  the  sample  towns,  and \nbeneficiaries\u2019  population  is  completely  urban.  Due  diligence  report  for  a  sample  solid  waste \nsubproject confirmed the absence of involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples impacts. 48 \n \nF. \n \nThe  overall  risk  assessment  is  moderate.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are \n29. \nsummarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in  detail  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management \nplan.49 Intended benefits are expected to outweigh costs. \n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n                                                \n42 The current project\u2019s PMU and PIUs have developed institutional capacity  to implement and monitor  safeguards; \n\nPMU safeguard managers are in place and supported by loan-funded specialists. \n\n43 Potential safeguard category A subprojects with significant safeguard impacts will be excluded. \n44 Environmental Assessment and Review  Framework, Resettlement Framework, and Indigenous Peoples Planning \n\nFramework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n45 Initial Environmental Examination (IEE): Faridpur Water Supply; IEE: Mymensingh Solid Waste Management; IEE: \nGopalganj  Roads;  IEE:  Cox\u2019s  Bazar  Drainage;  and  IEE:  Kushtia  Sanitation  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n46 Resettlement  Plan:  Mymensingh  Roads  and  Drains  and  Resettlement  Plan:  Cox\u2019s  Bazar  Roads  and  Drains \n(accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2),  prepared  in  consultation  with  affected  people,  are \nappropriate  to  the  identified  potential  impacts.

Land acquisition for solid waste \nmanagement subprojects has started and is at an advanced stage for most \nof the pourashavas. \nAwareness-raising programs supported by consultants will aim to change \ncitizens\u2019 attitudes in order to start segregating waste. Collection, \ntransportation, and management of solid waste are a criterion under UGIAP, \nrequiring pourashavas to improve performance. \nUnder UGIAP, the pourashavas are required to improve property tax collection \nefficiency  and  increase  collection  of  indirect  taxes,  fees,  rentals,  and  lease \ncharges  annually.  Preparation  of  pourashava  operation  and  maintenance \nplans, including budget provision, is required. Consultants will provide support \nin achieving UGIAP criteria, and raising public awareness for payment of taxes \nand  other  charges.  Pourashavas  will  be  encouraged  to  consider  service \noutsourcing for better management of revenue-generating facilities. \n\nUGIAP = Urban Governance Improvement Action Program. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the  additional financing shall \n30. \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM (footnote 30) and loan documents.
