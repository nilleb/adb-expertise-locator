This will contribute to diversification \nof energy sources in Armenia and boost efficiency by helping to replace existing aging generation \nassets with modern facilities.   \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nProject Identification and Description \n\nProject identification. Since the start of the 21st century, Armenia\u2019s energy sector has \n3. \nundergone  a  series  of  reforms  that  have  significantly  improved  its  performance.  The  reforms \ninvolved the unbundling of a vertically integrated electricity subsector and the privatization of most \nof  the  generating  companies  and  power  and  gas  distribution  networks.1 However,  the  existing \ngeneration  facilities  are  aging  and  need  replacement.  Generation  in  Armenia  has  dropped \nsubstantially since its peak in 1988. Armenia relies on nuclear and hydropower for about 65% of \nits  power  generation.  Several  thermal  power  plants  have  been  delayed  and  one  of  the  two \nreactors at the Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant (MNPP) has been shut down therefore, requiring \nadditional power generation.  \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n\n \n4. \nSince  2010,  Yerevan  Thermal  Power  Plant  (YTPP),  owned  by  the  Ministry  of  Energy \nInfrastructures  and  Natural  Resources,  has  been  operating  a  270  megawatt  (MW)  gas-fired \ncombined-cycle  cogeneration  power  plant  next  to  the  proposed  project  site.  The  YTPP  was \nfinanced with a concessional loan from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation. Given the \nneed to upgrade ageing power generation facilities in Armenia, Renco S.p.A. proposed 250 MW \nexpansion  next  to  the  YTPP  site  to  the  Government  of  Armenia.  [Confidential  information \ndeleted.] \n \n5. \n \nBorrower. ArmPower will own and operate the project. It is a special purpose company \n6. \nowned 60% by Renco Power (a 75:25 joint venture between Renco and Societ\u00e0 Italiana per le \nImprese all\u2019Estero (SIMEST)); and 40% by Siemens Project Ventures (SPV). \n \nSponsors.  Renco is an Italian company incorporated in 1979. Its core activities are to \n7. \nprovide  consulting  services,  and  engineering  and  construction  services for the  energy,  oil  and \ngas,  and  civil  infrastructures  sectors.  In  addition  to  its  operations  in  Italy,  Renco  operates  in \ncountries  such  as  Armenia,  Congo,  Kazakhstan,  the  Russian  Federation,  and  Tanzania. \n[Confidential information deleted.] \n \n8. \nSIMEST  was  established  in  1991  to  promote  investments  of  Italian  businesses  abroad \nand to provide Italian companies with technical and financial support. Cassa Depositi e Prestiti \nGroup,  82.77%  owned  by  Italy\u2019s  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance,  holds  76%  of  SIMEST\u2019s \n\n                                                \n1  ADB. 2014.

Incorporated  in  1847,  Siemens  is  a  global \nleading technology company in various business segments including power and gas, renewable \nenergy,  energy  management,  and  healthcare.  The  company  is  well-diversified  in  industry  and \ngeography. Siemens has 130 years of experience in the construction of turnkey  power plants, \nand  more  than  1,500  of  the  power  plants  it  constructed  are  in  commercial  operation  globally. \n[Confidential information deleted.] \n \n10. \n \nB. \n\nDevelopment Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n\nConfidential information deleted.  \n\nImpacts. The project will lead to the diversification of Armenia\u2019s primary energy sources.3 \n11. \nThe project will support the energy policy of the Government of Armenia, which aims to ensure \nenergy independence and enhance energy security.  \n \nOutcome. The outcome of the project will be increased availability of reliable and affordably \n12. \npriced  power  to  the  domestic  grid  and  the  CCPP\u2019s  power  generation  of  1,981  gigawatt-hours \nannually, which will help satisfy local electricity demand. The project is expected to provide at least \n80 jobs during operations. \n\n \nOutputs. The outputs will be (i) 250 MW capacity gas-fired CCPP installed and operated \n13. \nby the private sector, (ii) local employment generated from the construction and operation of the \nCCPP, and (iii) local and national economy stimulated. \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n\nConsistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is consistent with \n14. \nthe Midterm Review on Strategy 2020, which includes a focus on private sector development and \noperations,  and  infrastructure  development. 4 ADB\u2019s  support  for  the  project  is  in  line  with  its \ncountry partnership strategy for Armenia, 2014-2018 which supports private sector development \nand energy security by diversifying energy sources.5 \n \nConsistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The project is in line \n15. \nwith ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, particularly with one of its three pillars\u2014promoting energy efficiency \nand renewable energy. Although not a renewable energy source, the project will become the most \nefficient  thermal  power  plant  in  the  country  and  contribute  to  upgrade  of  electricity  sources  in \nArmenia where nuclear and hydropower plants generate about 65% of the electricity.6 This project \nis  also  complements  ADB\u2019s  earlier  financing  to  ENA  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  Armenia\u2019s \nelectricity sector. \n \n\n                                                \n2  SIMEST. 2017.

The project\u2019s sustainability \ndepends on its ability to amortize its up-front capital costs over the period of operation and tenor \nof the loan. The long tenor of the ADB loan is necessary for the project to achieve sound debt \nservice  levels  over  the  life  of  the  project.  The  national  and  international  commercial  financing \nmarket does not provide such loans to the borrower. ADB\u2019s involvement significantly enhances \nenvironmental  and  social  standards  for  the  project.  Successful  project  financing  will  establish \nprecedents  for  future  financings  of  similar  projects,  including  independent  power  producer \nprojects in Armenia, by boosting investor and lender confidence. \n \nC. \n\nRisks  \n\n22. \n \n23. \n\n24. \n\n25. \n\n26. \n\n27. \n\n28. \n\n29. \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n \nConfidential information deleted. \n \nConfidential information deleted. \n \nConfidential information deleted. \n \nConfidential information deleted. \n \nConfidential information deleted. \n \nConfidential information deleted. \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n30. \n \n\n \n\n \nConfidential information deleted. \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\n31. \nIn  compliance with ADB\u2019s  Safeguard Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguards \ncategories are as follows: category A for environment, and category C for involuntary resettlement \nand indigenous peoples. To meet ADB environmental and social requirements for an environment \ncategory  A  project,  an  Environmental  and  Social  Impact  Assessment  was  prepared. 7  The \npotential  environmental  and  social  impacts  of  the  project  have  been  identified  and  effective \nmeasures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse impacts are incorporated \ninto an Environmental and Social Management Plan. The institutional capacity and commitment \nof ArmPower to manage the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts are deemed adequate, \nparticularly given that Renco is already certified under international standards.8 \n \nEnvironment (category A). The site is a former farmland in an industrial area of Yerevan. \n32. \nIt has been subject to previous earthworks through its use as a laydown and storage area for the \nneighboring power station. The soil has been tested for contamination and is suitable for industrial \nland use, but the groundwater has elevated hydrocarbons and heavy metals. Air monitoring for \nsulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and particulate matter 10 micrometers or less in diameter \nfound  that  the  airshed  is  non-degraded.9 Except  for  locations  near  main  roads,  the  site  and \nsurrounding areas generally have low noise levels.10    \n \n33. \nTemporary construction impacts will potentially include noise, dust, traffic, erosion, solid \nand liquid waste generation, hazardous substances management, and health and safety issues. \nNo  construction  camp  is  required.  The  contractor  will  implement  dust  control,  erosion  and \nsediment control, and waste management as part of a construction environmental, health, and \nsafety management plan. No truck movements will be permitted at night. Groundwater is to be \nmanaged by the installation of a clay barrier and sub-surface drainage. The sponsor is engaging \nexperts  to  conduct  a  hydrological  assessment  and  develop  mitigation measures,  which will  be \nreviewed and approved by ADB prior to construction. \n \n34. \nThe plant will have a low nitrogen oxide burner and a 66-meter stack height in compliance \nwith international standards.11 The projected NO2 emissions of 97.9 micrograms (\u00b5g)/cubic meter \n(m3) per hour and 5.1 \u00b5g/m3 per year are well below the national and international NO2 emission \nstandards of 200 \u00b5g/m3 per hour and 40 \u00b5g/m3 per year. Greenhouse gas emissions of 785,000 \n\n                                                \n7  Fichtner. 2018.

Industrial wastewater will be treated via an oil\u2013water separator and \na  biological treatment  system to  international  discharge standards.12 Discharges  of 70 m3/hour \nwill be delivered into an existing discharge pipeline and a series of canals, before entering the \nHrazdan  River  7  kilometers  downstream.  This  provides  sufficient  cooling  so  that  there  are  no \nadverse  effects  on  the  river.  About  14m3/hour  of  sanitary  sewage  will  be  discharged  to  the \nmunicipal network. \n \n35. \nInvoluntary resettlement and indigenous peoples (category C). The project site is in \nan industrial area owned by YTPP. ArmPower entered into the final land purchase agreement in \n2017 to acquire the site. The land does not have any legacy or current risks associated with land \nacquisition and resettlement. The due diligence phase has also assessed that the project does \nnot result in impacts on indigenous peoples. Hence, no involuntary resettlement or indigenous \npeople issues are envisaged for the project. \n \n36. \nArmPower will comply with national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection \nStrategy  (2001),  will  take  measures  to  comply  with  the  internationally  recognized  core  labor \nstandards.13 The client will report regularly to ADB on (i) its and its contractors\u2019 compliance with \nsuch  laws  and  (ii)  the  measures  taken.  Information  disclosure  and  consultation  with  affected \npeople will be conducted in accordance with ADB requirements.14 \n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\n37. \nArmPower was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating \nto combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC. \n\nInvestment Limitations  \n\nThe  proposed  loan  is  within  the  medium-term,  country,  industry,  group,  and  single \n\n38. \nexposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD. \n\nAssurances \n\nConsistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),15 \n39. \nADB will proceed with the proposed assistance upon establishing that the Government of Armenia \nhas no objection to the proposed assistance to ArmPower. ADB will enter into suitable finance \ndocumentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed \nassistance by the Board of Directors. \n \n\n                                                 \n12 IFC. 2008.
